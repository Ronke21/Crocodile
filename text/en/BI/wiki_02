<text>Charles Willson Peale (April 15, 1741 – February 22, 1827) was an American painter, military officer, scientist, and naturalist.

In 1775, inspired by the American Revolution, Peale moved from his native Maryland to Philadelphia, where he set up a painting studio and joined the Sons of Liberty. During the American Revolutionary War, Peale served in the Pennsylvania Militia and the Continental Army, participating in several military campaigns. In addition to his military service, Peale also served in the Pennsylvania State Assembly from 1779 to 1780.

Peale&#x27;s portraits of leading American figures of the late 18th century are some of the most recognizable and prominent from that era. In 1784, he founded the Philadelphia Museum, one of the first American museums. More than two centuries after Peale painted his 1779 portrait &quot;Washington at Princeton&quot;, the painting sold for $21.5 million, the highest price ever paid for an American portrait.

==Early life==




Peale was born on April 15, 1741, in Chester, Maryland. He was the son of Charles Peale (1709–1750) and his wife Margaret Triggs (1709–1791). Peale had a younger brother, James Peale (1749–1831), and was the brother-in-law of Nathaniel Ramsey, who would go on to serve as a delegate to the Congress of the Confederation.

==Career==
Four years after his father&#x27;s death in 1750, Peale, at age 13, became an apprentice to saddle maker Nathan Waters. When he reached maturity, Peale opened his own saddle shop.

In 1764, Peale joined Sons of Liberty, an organization of the Thirteen Colonies that proved influential in organizing and paving the way for the American Revolution. He proved unsuccessful in saddle making as a career and then tried fixing clocks and working with metals, but both of these endeavors also failed. He then took up painting.

Finding that he had a talent for painting, especially portraiture, Peale studied for a time under John Hesselius and John Singleton Copley. John Beale Bordley and friends eventually raised enough money for him to travel to England to take instruction from Benjamin West. Peale studied with West for three years beginning in 1767, afterward returning to North America and settling in Annapolis, Maryland. There, he taught painting to his younger brother, James Peale, who in time also became a noted artist.

===American Revolution===
In 1775, Peale&#x27;s enthusiasm for the American Revolution and the new national government led him to move from Maryland to Philadelphia, then the national capital, where he began painting portraits of notable Americans and visitors from overseas. His estate, now located at La Salle University in Philadelphia, is now open to the public. Peale also recruited troops for the Pennsylvania militia, which ultimately joined with other militias to create the Continental Army, commanded by George Washington. In the Pennsylvania militia, Peale rose to the rank of captain and participated in several battles including the Battle of Trenton and Battle of Princeton. While in combat, he painted miniature portraits of various officers in the Continental Army. He produced enlarged versions of these in later years. After the Revolutionary War, he served in the Pennsylvania state assembly for a year, from 1779 to 1780, and then returned to painting full-time in Philadelphia.

Peale was a prolific artist. He completed portraits of scores of historic figures, including Benjamin Franklin, John Hancock, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, James Mitchell Varnum, and George Washington. In 1771, Washington sat for a portrait with Peale, and he later sat for six additional sittings. Using the seven portraits he painted of Washington, Peale produced close to 60 portraits of Washington. In January 2005, one of them, Peale&#x27;s &quot;Washington at Princeton&quot; sold for $21.3 million (~$ in ), setting a record for the highest price paid for a North American portrait.

In 1794, Peale designed the first state seal of Maryland.

One of his most celebrated paintings is &quot;The Staircase Group&quot; (1795), a double portrait of his sons Raphaelle and Titian, is painted in the &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; style and appears today in the Philadelphia Museum of Art. This painting is said to have fooled even George Washington.

===Philadelphia Museum===

Peale had a great interest in natural history, and organized the first U.S. scientific expedition in 1801. These two major interests combined in his founding of the Philadelphia Museum in 1784. It housed a diverse collection of botanical, biological, and archaeological specimens. In 1786, Peale was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

The museum contained a large variety of birds which Peale himself acquired, and in many instances mounted, having taught himself taxidermy. In 1792, Peale initiated a correspondence with Thomas Hall, of the Finsbury Museum, City Road, Finsbury, London proposing to purchase British stuffed items for his museum. Eventually, an exchange system was established between the two, whereby Peale sent American birds to Hall in exchange for an equal number of British birds. This arrangement continued until the end of the century. The Peale Museum was the first to display a mastodon skeleton (which in Peale&#x27;s time were referred to as mammoth bones; these common names were amended by Georges Cuvier in 1800, and his proposed usage is that employed today) that Peale found in New York. Peale worked with his son to mount the skeleton for display.

The display of the mammoth bones entered Peale into a long-standing debate between Thomas Jefferson and Comte de Buffon. Buffon argued that Europe was superior to the Americas biologically, which was illustrated through the size of animals found there. Jefferson referenced the existence of these &quot;mammoths&quot; (which he believed still roamed northern regions of the continent) as evidence for a greater biodiversity in North America. Peale&#x27;s display of these bones drew attention from Europe, as did his method of re-assembling large skeletal specimens in three dimensions.

The museum was among the first to adopt Linnaean taxonomy. This system drew a stark contrast between Peale&#x27;s museum and his competitors who presented their artifacts as mysterious oddities of the natural world.

The museum underwent several moves during its existence. At various times it was located in several prominent buildings, including Independence Hall and the original home of the American Philosophical Society.

The museum eventually failed, in large part because Peale was unsuccessful at obtaining government funding. After his death, the museum was sold to, and split up by, showmen P. T. Barnum and Moses Kimball.

==Personal life==
In 1762, Peale married Rachel Brewer (1744–1790), who bore him ten children, most of them named for Peale&#x27;s favorite male and female artists. Several of his sons and daughters also pursued careers as painters, including:

* Angelica Kauffman Peale (1775–1853), who was named for Angelica Kauffman, Peale&#x27;s favorite female painter
* Raphaelle Peale (1774–1825), who some consider to be the first professional American painter of still-life
* Rembrandt Peale (1778–1860), portrait painter, inventor, businessman, museum owner/operator in Baltimore. He founded the Gas Light Company of Baltimore in 1817, now Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), and was the father of artist Rosalba Carriera Peale.
* Rubens Peale (1784–1865), museum administrator and artist.
* Sophonisba Angusciola Peale (1786–1859), ornithologist. She married Coleman Sellers (1781–1834) in 1805. She was the mother of Coleman Sellers II.
* Titian Ramsay Peale I (1780–1798), ornithologist. He died at the age of 18.

After Rachel&#x27;s death in 1790, Peale married Elizabeth de Peyster (1765–1804), a descendant of Johannes de Peyster, the next year. With his second wife, he had six additional children, including:

* Charles Linnaeus Peale (1794–1832), who was named for Charles Linnaeus, the Swedish botanist and zoologist
* Elizabeth De Peyster Peale (1802–1857), who married William Augustus Patterson (1792–1833) in 1820
* Franklin Peale (1795–1870), who became the Chief Coiner at the Philadelphia Mint
* Titian Ramsay Peale II (1799–1885), explorer, ornithologist, scientific illustrator, and photographer

In 1805, Peale married Hannah Moore, a Quaker from Philadelphia, who became his third wife. She helped to raise the younger children from his previous two marriages.

Peale&#x27;s slave, Moses Williams, was also trained in the arts while growing up in the Peale household and later became a professional silhouette artist.

In 1810, Peale purchased a farm in Germantown, where he intended to retire. He named this estate Belfield and cultivated extensive gardens there. After Hannah&#x27;s death in 1821, Peale lived with his son Rubens and sold Belfield in 1826. Peale died on February 22, 1827, and was buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Philadelphia alongside his wife Elizabeth DePeyster.

==Expertise==
A Renaissance man, Peale had expertise not only in painting but also in many diverse fields, including carpentry, dentistry, optometry, shoemaking, and taxidermy. In 1802, John Isaac Hawkins patented the second official physiognotrace, a mechanical drawing device, and partnered with Peale to market it to prospective buyers. Peale sent a watercolor sketch of the physiognotrace, along with a detailed explanation, to Thomas Jefferson. The drawing is now held with the Jefferson Papers in the Library of Congress.

Around 1804, Peale obtained the American patent rights to the polygraph from its inventor John Isaac Hawkins, about the same time as the purchase of one by Thomas Jefferson. Peale and Jefferson collaborated on refinements to this device, which enabled a copy of a handwritten letter to be produced simultaneously with the original.

Peale wrote several books. Two of these were &quot;An Essay on Building Wooden Bridges&quot; (1797) and &quot;An Epistle to a Friend on the Means of Preserving Health&quot; (1803).

<doc id="339620" wikidata="Q27663954" url="?curid=339620" title="Temple of the Delians">
<text>The Temple of the Delians is the largest of the three Greek temples dedicated to Apollo within the &quot;temenos&quot; of the Sanctuary of Apollo on the Greek island of Delos. This was one of slightly more than a dozen Panhellenic sanctuaries in Ancient Greek religion and attracted visitors from across the Hellenic world. It is also known as the Great Temple or the Delian Temple of Apollo.

==History==

Construction was funded by the Delian League and began in 476 BC. Construction was interrupted in 454 BC when the Delian Treasury was transferred to Athens. Work resumed during Delos&#x27;s period of independence after 314 BC. The finishing touches and decorative embellishments were never completed. 

The temple was principally destroyed during the Mithridatic Wars and only the lower foundations, stylobate, and fragmented columns remain today.

== Description ==
The Temple of the Delians is a peripteral temple in the Doric order, with 6 columns on each short side and 13 columns along each length. The cella is aligned opening to the west with a pronaos and an opisthodomos, both distyle in antis. The temple foundations measure ca. 30 x 13 meters overall. 

Because construction was suspended, remaining columns display how the ancient Greeks made their fluting. The round stone drums making up the shaft of the column were rather roughly shaped on the ground, with the fluting only done for a few inches on the top and bottom drums, as a guide for the masons. The column was then assembled in place. Normally the masons then used scaffolds to complete the fluting for the rest of the shaft, but in this temple this final stage was never done. 

The temple contained the cult statue of Apollo and centuries of precious offerings. One of the treasures of the temple was a statue of Apollo made by &quot;Angelion and Tektaos, sons of Dionysiodotos&quot;, who depicted the god with three Charites (Graces) in his hand.

The famous Colossus of the Naxians stood in the adjacent courtyard.

==Ancient descriptions==
Strabo describes the myth behind the ancient worship of Apollo and Artemis in Delos: 
:Now the city which belongs to Delos, as also the temple of Apollon, and the Letoion (Temple of Leto), are situated in a plain; and above the city lies Kynthos, a bare and rugged mountain; and a river named Inopos flows through the island - not a large river, for the island itself is small. From olden times, beginning with the times of the heroes, Delos has been revered because of its gods, for the myth is told that there Leto was delivered of her travail by the birth of Apollon and Artemis : &#x27;for aforetime,&#x27; says Pindaros, &#x27;it was tossed by the billows, by the blasts of all manner of winds, but when [Leto] the daughter of Koios in the frenzied pangs of childbirth set foot upon it, then did four pillars, resting on adamant, rise perpendicular from the roots of the earth, and on their capitals sustain the rock. And there she gave birth to, and beheld, her blessed offspring.&#x27; The neighboring islands, called the Kyklades, made it famous, since in its honor they would send at public expense sacred envoys, sacrifices, and choruses composed of virgins, and would celebrate great general festivals there [in honour of Apollon, Artemis and Leto]. 

According to Strabo, Apollo and his twin Artemis were both worshipped as gods of healing and as such also identified with Helios and Selene respectively: 
:Both Milesians [at Didyma] and Delians invoke an Apollo Oulios, that is, as god of &#x27;health and healing,&#x27; for the verb oulein means &#x27;to be healthy&#x27;; whence the noun &#x27;oule&#x27; and the salutation, &#x27;Both health and great joy to thee&#x27;; for Apollon is the god of healing. And Artemis has her name from the fact that she makes people artemeas (Safe and Sound). And both Helios (Sun) and Selene (Moon) are closely associated with these, since they are the causes of the temperature of the air. And both pestilential diseases and sudden deaths are imputed to these gods.

Strabo described the festival of Delos as an occasion of both religious worship as well as commercial opportunities, but also the destruction of the temple: 
:Now although Delos had become so famous, yet the razing of Korinthos to the ground by the Romans increased its fame still more; for the importers changed their business to Delos because they were attracted both by the immunity which the temple enjoyed and by the convenient situation of the harbor; for it is happily situated for those who are sailing from Italy and Greece to Asia. The general festival [of Apollon] is a kind of commercial affair, and it was frequented by Romans more than by any other people, even when Korinthos was still in existence. And when the Athenians took the island they at the same time took good care of the importers as well as of the religious rites. But when the generals of [the Persian] Mithridates, and the tyrant who caused it to revolt, visited Delos, they completely ruined it, and when the Romans again got the island, after the king withdrew to his homeland, it was desolate; and it has remained in an impoverished condition until the present time. It is now held by the Athenians. Rheneia is a desert isle within four stadia from Delos, and there the Delians bury their dead; for it is unlawful to bury, or even burn, a corpse in Delos itself, and it is unlawful even to keep a dog there. In earlier times it was called Ortygia.

Pausanias describes the destruction and sacrilege of the temple by Mithridates: 
:Boiatai [in Lakedaimonia], is sacred to Apollon and called Epidelion. For the wooden image which is now here, once stood in Delos. Delos was then a Greek market, and seemed to offer security to traders on account of the god; but as the place was unfortified and the inhabitants unarmed, [the historical Persian] Menophanes, an officer of Mithridates, attacked it with a fleet, to show his contempt for the god, or acting on the orders of Mithridates; for to a man whose object is gain what is sacred is of less account than what is profitable. This Menophanes put to death the foreigners residing there and the Delians themselves, and after plundering much property belonging to the traders and all the offerings, and also carrying women and children away as slaves, he razed Delos itself to the ground. As it was being sacked and pillaged, one of the barbarians wantonly flung this image into the sea; but the wave took it and brought it to land here in the country of the Boiatai. For this reason they call the place Epidelion. But neither Menophanes nor Mithridates himself escaped the wrath of the god. Menophanes, as he was putting to sea after the sack of Delos was sunk at once by those of the merchants who had escaped; for they lay in wait for him in ships. The god caused Mithridates at a later date to lay hands upon himself, when his empire had been destroyed and he himself was being hunted on all sides by the Romans. There are some who say that he obtained a violent death as a favour at the hands of one of his mercenaries. This was the reward of their impiety.

<text>Tony Fagenson (born July 18, 1978) is a guitarist, producer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist who is best known for his work with rock bands Eve 6 and Dead Posey.

== Eve 6 ==
While attending the University of Southern California at the age of 18, he auditioned for a band from La Crescenta, California called Eleventeen (eventually to become Eve 6) to replace their drummer. A fan at the time of the Fox TV show &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Fagenson and singer Max Collins were inspired to name the band Eve 6 after seeing the &quot;X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Eve&quot; while recording their first album. Fagenson played on and co-wrote the four Eve 6 albums released between 1998 and 2012.

Fagenson announced his departure from Eve 6 via Instagram and Twitter on April 7, 2018 and is now full time playing in his band Dead Posey.

== Producer and songwriter ==
When not spending time on band matters, Fagenson produced and co-wrote songs for artists such as Puddle of Mudd, Emily Osment (of Disney&#x27;s Hannah Montana), The Johnsons &amp; Bryce Vine, Sandra N, Illustrated, Malbec etc. In 2005, Fagenson joined former Eve 6 member Max Collins in forming a new band, The Sugi Tap while Eve 6 was on hiatus.

== Dead Posey ==
In 2018, Fagenson started his current band Dead Posey as guitarist, co-writer &amp; producer with partner Danyell Souza. The band released 3 EP&#x27;s on Sumerian Records / Position Music - Freak Show, Malfunction] &amp; Malfunction X Broken Down. Dead Posey released their debut album &#x27;Are You In A Cult?&#x27; on October 18, 2024.

Dead Posey has played notable festivals Download, Louder Than Life, Aftershock, Shiprocked and Mad Cool Festival as well as touring with bands such as Theory of a Deadman, Palaye Royale, Bones UK and The Birthday Massacre.

Dead Posey&#x27;s music has been heard in Fox&#x27;s &quot;Lucifer&quot;, MTV&#x27;s &quot;Teen Wolf&quot;, Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot;, and Netflix&#x27;s &quot;Jack Whitehall: Travels With My Father&quot;, as well as in ads for Taco Bell, Sony PlayStation, Riot Games’ League of Legends, and more. In 2019 their song &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop The Devil&quot; was the theme song for WWE&#x27;s Elimination Chamber. The band&#x27;s song &quot;Parasite&quot; from the Malfunction EP made the 68 Best Rock Songs of 2020 by Loudwire. Dead Posey has received positive write ups from the likes of Spin, Guitar World, Kerrang! Magazine and has collaborated with Hot Topic on their &quot;I Like Scary Movies Experience&quot; feature. They have also appeared on podcasts such as The Boo Crew, The Fred Minnick Show and She Will Rock You. In June 2022 Dead Posey have made their debut on Kerrang! Radio&#x27;s show Fresh Blood hosted by Alex Baker and were picked as The Featured Artist Of The Week.

== Show One ==
Fagenson is the co-creator of ShowOne, a mobile backing tracks app for musicians.

== Personal life ==
Fagenson is married to bandmate Danyell Souza (Dead Posey). He is the son of the Grammy Award winning producer Don Was.

<text>Kozlovichi Mental Asylum was an institution for the mentally ill in Randilovshchina, near Kozlovichi, Grodno Province, Belarus. The wooden construction housing the building was built in 1905 and destroyed by fire on October 12, 2003. The fire killed thirty patients.

==Fire==
Although President Alexander Lukashenko&#x27;s spokeswoman, Natalya Petkevich, said that a patient (among those who died in the fire), described as a pyromaniac who had twice previously tried to set fire to the building, was responsible for the blaze, government investigators were also looking into staff carelessness as a possible cause. Staff members, some of whom had been sleeping in a separate building on the campus, apparently tried to put the fire out and rescue patients themselves, waiting to call the fire department.

<doc id="339633" wikidata="Q1986297" url="?curid=339633" title="Vaccinia">
<text>The vaccinia virus (VACV or VV) is a large, complex, enveloped virus belonging to the poxvirus family. It has a linear, double-stranded DNA genome approximately 190 kbp in length, which encodes approximately 250 genes. The dimensions of the virion are roughly 360 × 270 × 250 nm, with a mass of approximately 5–10 fg. The vaccinia virus is the source of the modern smallpox vaccine, which the World Health Organization (WHO) used to eradicate smallpox in a global vaccination campaign in 1958–1977. Although &quot;smallpox&quot; no longer exists in the wild, &quot;vaccinia&quot; virus is still studied widely by scientists as a tool for gene therapy and genetic engineering.

Smallpox had been an endemic human disease that had a 30% fatality rate. In 1796, the British doctor Edward Jenner proved that an infection with the relatively mild cowpox virus would also confer immunity to the deadly smallpox. Jenner referred to cowpox as &quot;variolae vaccinae&quot; (smallpox of the cow). However, the origins of the smallpox vaccine became murky over time, especially after Louis Pasteur developed laboratory techniques for creating vaccines in the 19th century. Allan Watt Downie demonstrated in 1939 that the modern smallpox vaccine was serologically distinct from cowpox, and &quot;vaccinia&quot; was subsequently recognized as a separate viral species. Whole-genome sequencing has revealed that &quot;vaccinia&quot; is most closely related to horsepox, and the cowpox strains found in Great Britain are the &quot;least&quot; closely related to &quot;vaccinia&quot;.

== Classification of vaccinia infections ==
In addition to the morbidity of uncomplicated primary vaccination, transfer of infection to other sites by scratching, and post-vaccinial encephalitis, other complications of vaccinia infections may be divided into the following types:
* Generalized vaccinia
* Eczema vaccinatum
* Progressive vaccinia (vaccinia gangrenosum, vaccinia necrosum)
* Roseola vaccinia

==Origin==
Vaccinia virus is closely related to the virus that causes cowpox; historically the two were often considered to be one and the same. The precise origin of vaccinia virus is unknown due to the lack of record-keeping, as the virus was repeatedly cultivated and passaged in research laboratories for many decades. The most common notion is that vaccinia virus, cowpox virus, and variola virus (the causative agent of smallpox) were all derived from a common ancestral virus. There is also speculation that vaccinia virus was originally isolated from horses, and analysis of DNA from an early (1902) sample of smallpox vaccine showed that it was 99.7% similar to horsepox virus.

==Virology==
Poxviruses are unique among DNA viruses because they replicate only in the cytoplasm of the host cell, outside of the nucleus. Therefore, the large genome is required for encoding various enzymes and proteins involved in viral DNA replication and gene transcription. During its replication cycle, VV produces four infectious forms which differ in their outer membranes: intracellular mature virion (IMV), the intracellular enveloped virion (IEV), the cell-associated enveloped virion (CEV) and the extracellular enveloped virion (EEV). Although the issue remains contentious, the prevailing view is that the IMV consists of a single lipoprotein membrane, while the CEV and EEV are both surrounded by two membrane layers and the IEV has three envelopes. The IMV is the most abundant infectious form and is thought to be responsible for spread between hosts. On the other hand, the CEV is believed to play a role in cell-to-cell spread and the EEV is thought to be important for long range dissemination within the host organism.

==Multiplicity reactivation==
Vaccinia virus is able to undergo multiplicity reactivation (MR). MR is the process by which two, or more, virus genomes containing otherwise lethal damage interact within an infected cell to form a viable virus genome. Abel found that vaccinia viruses exposed to doses of UV light sufficient to prevent progeny formation when single virus particles infected host chick embryo cells, could still produce viable progeny viruses when host cells were infected by two or more of these inactivated viruses; that is, MR could occur. Kim and Sharp demonstrated MR of vaccinia virus after treatment with UV-light, nitrogen mustard, and X-rays or gamma rays. Michod et al. reviewed numerous examples of MR in different viruses, and suggested that MR is a common form of sexual interaction in viruses that provides the advantage of recombinational repair of genome damages.

==Host resistance==
Vaccinia contains within its genome genes for several proteins that give the virus resistance to interferons:
* K3L () is a protein with homology to the protein &quot;eukaryotic initiation factor 2&quot; (eIF-2alpha). K3L protein inhibits the action of PKR, an activator of interferons.
* E3L () is another protein encoded by Vaccinia. E3L also inhibits PKR activation, and is also able to bind to double stranded RNA.
* B18R () directly binds to type I interferon to abolish its function; in other words it works as a decoy receptor. It is used in bioengineering, for cells with added nucleic acid might otherwise enter an antiviral state that reduces protein output. It is also used in a Moderna paper to enhance the chance of converting a cell into a induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) using mRNA.
==Treatments==

Dissemination of vaccinia infection is rare due widespread immunization. Immunocompromised patients may be at risk of developing severe infection. The only current FDA-approved treatment is serotherapy (intravenous infusion of anti-anti-vaccinia immunoglobulin).

==Use as a vaccine==

Vaccinia virus infection is typically very mild and often does not cause symptoms in healthy individuals, although it may cause rash and fever. Immune responses generated from a vaccinia virus infection protects the person against a lethal smallpox infection. For this reason, vaccinia virus was, and still is, being used as a live-virus vaccine against smallpox. Unlike vaccines that use weakened forms of the virus being vaccinated against, the vaccinia virus vaccine cannot cause a smallpox infection because it does not contain the smallpox virus. However, certain complications and/or vaccine adverse effects occasionally arise. The chance of this happening is significantly increased in people who are immunocompromised. Approximately 1 to 2 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated could die as a result of life-threatening reactions to the vaccination. The rate of myopericarditis with ACAM2000 is 5.7 per 1,000 of primary vaccinees.

On September 1, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) licensed a new vaccine ACAM2000 against smallpox which can be produced quickly upon need. Manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stockpiled 192.5 million doses of the new vaccine (see list of common strains below).

A smallpox vaccine, Imvanex, which is based on the Modified vaccinia Ankara strain, was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2013. This strain has been used in vaccines during the 2022 monkeypox outbreak.

&quot;Vaccinia&quot; is also used in recombinant vaccines, as a vector for expression of foreign genes within a host, in order to generate an immune response. Other poxviruses are also used as live recombinant vaccines.

==History==
The original vaccine for smallpox, and the origin of the idea of vaccination, was Cowpox, described by Edward Jenner in 1798. The Latin term used for Cowpox was &quot;Variolae vaccinae&quot;, Jenner&#x27;s own translation of &quot;smallpox of the cow&quot;. That term lent its name to the whole idea of vaccination. When it was realized that the virus used in smallpox vaccination was not, or was no longer, the same as cowpox virus, the name &#x27;vaccinia&#x27; was used for the virus in smallpox vaccine. (See OED.) Vaccine potency and efficacy prior to the invention of refrigerated methods of transportation was unreliable. The vaccine would be rendered impotent by heat and sunlight, and the method of drying samples on quills and shipping them to countries in need often resulted in an inactive vaccine. Another method employed was the &quot;arm to arm&quot; method. This involved vaccinating an individual then transferring it to another as soon as the infectious pustule forms, then to another, etc. This method was used as a form of living transportation of the vaccine, and usually employed orphans as carriers. However, this method was problematic due to the possibility of spreading other blood diseases, such as hepatitis and syphilis, as was the case in 1861, when 41 Italian children contracted syphilis after being vaccinated by the &quot;arm to arm&quot; method. Henry Austin Martin introduced a method for vaccine production from calves.

In 1913, E. Steinhardt, C. Israeli, and R. A. Lambert grew vaccinia virus in fragments of pig corneal tissue culture.A paper published in 1915 by Fredrick W. Twort, a student of Willian Bulloch, is considered to be the beginning of modern phage research. He was attempting to grow vaccinia virus on agar media in the absence of living cells when he noted that many colonies of contaminating micrococci grew up and appeared mucoid, watery or glassy, and this transformation could be induced in other colonies by inoculation of the fresh colony with material from the watery colony. Using a microscope, he observed that bacteria had degenerated into small granules that stained red with Giemsa stain. He concluded that &quot;...it [the agent of transformation] might almost be considered as an acute infectious disease of micrococci.&quot;
In 1939 Allan Watt Downie showed that the smallpox vaccines being used in the 20th century and cowpox virus were not the same, but were immunologically related.

===2000–present===
In March 2007, a 2-year-old Indiana boy and his mother contracted a life-threatening vaccinia infection from the boy&#x27;s father. The boy developed the telltale rash over 80 percent of his body after coming into close contact with his father, who was vaccinated for smallpox before being deployed overseas by the United States Army. The United States military resumed smallpox vaccinations in 2002. The child acquired the infection due to eczema, which is a known risk factor for vaccinia infection. The boy was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin, cidofovir, and Tecovirimat (ST-246), a (then) experimental drug developed by SIGA Technologies. On April 19, 2007, he was sent home with no after effects except for possible scarring of the skin.

In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that a woman in Washington had contracted vaccinia virus infection after digital vaginal contact with her boyfriend, a military member who had recently been vaccinated for smallpox. The woman had a history of childhood eczema, but she had not been symptomatic as an adult. The CDC indicated that it was aware of four similar cases in the preceding 12 months of vaccinia infection after sexual contact with a recent military vaccinee. Further cases—also in patients with a history of eczema—occurred in 2012.

==Common strains==
This is a list of some of the well-characterized vaccinia strains used for research and vaccination.
* Lister (also known as Elstree): the English vaccine strain used by Leslie Collier to develop heat stable vaccine in powdered form. Used as the basis for vaccine production during the World Health Organization Smallpox Eradication Campaign (SEC)
* Dryvax (also known as &quot;Wyeth&quot;): the vaccine strain previously used in the United States, produced by Wyeth. Used in the SEC, it was replaced in 2008 by ACAM2000 (see below), produced by Acambis. It was produced as preparations of calf lymph which was freeze-dried and treated with antibiotics.
* EM63: Russian strain used in the SEC
* ACAM2000: The current strain in use in the US, produced by Acambis. ACAM2000 was derived from a clone of a Dryvax virus by plaque purification. It is produced in cultures of Vero cells.
* Modified vaccinia Ankara (also known as MVA): a highly attenuated (not virulent) strain created by passaging vaccinia virus several hundred times in chicken embryo fibroblasts. Unlike some other vaccinia strains it does not make immunodeficient mice sick and therefore may be safer to use in humans who have weaker immune systems due to being very young, very old, having HIV/AIDS, etc.
* LC16m8: an attenuated strain developed and currently used in Japan
* CV-1: an attenuated strain developed in the United States and used there in the late 1960s- 1970s
* Western Reserve
* Copenhagen
* Connaught Laboratories (Canada)

<doc id="339637" wikidata="Q313744" url="?curid=339637" title="Auguste Escoffier">
<text>Georges Auguste Escoffier (; 28 October 1846 – 12 February 1935) was a French chef, restaurateur, and culinary writer who popularised and updated traditional French cooking methods. Much of Escoffier&#x27;s technique was based on that of Marie-Antoine Carême, one of the codifiers of French &quot;haute cuisine&quot;; Escoffier&#x27;s achievement was to simplify and modernise Carême&#x27;s elaborate and ornate style. In particular, he codified the recipes for the five mother sauces. Referred to by the French press as &quot;roi des cuisiniers et cuisinier des rois&quot; (&quot;king of chefs and chef of kings&quot;—also previously said of Carême), Escoffier was a preeminent figure in London and Paris during the 1890s and the early part of the 20th century.

Alongside the recipes, Escoffier elevated the profession. In a time when kitchens were loud, riotous places where drinking on the job was commonplace, Escoffier demanded cleanliness, discipline, and silence from his staff. In bringing order to the kitchen, he tapped into his own military experience to develop the hierarchical &quot;brigade de cuisine&quot; system for organising the kitchen staff which is still standard in many restaurants today. He worked in partnership with hotelier César Ritz, rising to prominence together at the Savoy in London serving the elite of society, and later at the Ritz Hotel in Paris and the Carlton in London.

Escoffier published &quot;Le Guide Culinaire&quot;, which is still used as a major reference work, both in the form of a cookbook and a textbook on cooking. Escoffier&#x27;s recipes, techniques, and approaches to kitchen management remain highly influential today, and have been adopted by chefs and restaurants not only in France, but also throughout the world.

==Early life==
Escoffier was born in the village of Villeneuve-Loubet, today in Alpes-Maritimes, near Nice. The house where he was born is now the Musée de l&#x27;Art Culinaire, run by the Foundation Auguste Escoffier. Despite the early promise he showed as an artist, his father took him out of school at the age of twelve to start an apprenticeship in the kitchen of his uncle&#x27;s restaurant, Le Restaurant Français, in Nice. As an apprentice, Auguste was bullied and swatted by his uncle and his small stature made him even more of a target–he was too short to safely open oven doors. Eventually, he wore boots with built up heels. Escoffier showed such an aptitude for cooking and kitchen management that he was soon hired by the nearby Hôtel Bellevue, where the owner of a fashionable Paris restaurant, Le Petit Moulin Rouge, offered him the position of &quot;commis-rôtisseur&quot; (apprentice roast cook) in 1865 at the age of 19. However, only months after arriving in Paris, Escoffier was called to active military duty, where he was given the position of army chef.

Escoffier spent nearly seven years in the army—at first stationed in various barracks throughout France (including five months in Villefranche-sur-Mer, coincidentally not three miles from his old home in Nice), and later at Metz as &quot;chef de cuisine&quot; of the Rhine Army after the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. His army experiences led him to study the technique of canning food.

Sometime before 1878, he opened his own restaurant, &quot;Le Faisan d&#x27;Or&quot; (The Golden Pheasant), in Cannes.

==Escoffier, César Ritz and the Savoy==
In 1884, Escoffier and his wife moved to Monte Carlo, where Escoffier was employed by César Ritz, manager of the new Grand Hotel, to take control of the kitchens. At that time, the French Riviera was a winter resort: during the summers, Escoffier ran the kitchens of the Grand Hôtel National in Lucerne, also managed by Ritz.

In 1890, Ritz and Escoffier accepted an invitation from Richard D&#x27;Oyly Carte to transfer to his new Savoy Hotel in London, together with the third member of their team, the &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot;, Louis Echenard. Ritz put together what he described as &quot;a little army of hotel men for the conquest of London&quot;, and Escoffier recruited French cooks and reorganised the kitchens. The Savoy under Ritz and his partners was an immediate success, attracting a distinguished and moneyed clientele, headed by the Prince of Wales. Gregor von Görög, chef to the royal family, was an enthusiast of Escoffier&#x27;s zealous organisation. Aristocratic women, hitherto unaccustomed to dining in public, were now &quot;seen in full regalia in the Savoy dining and supper rooms&quot;.

Escoffier created many famous dishes at the Savoy. In 1893, he invented the &quot;pêche Melba&quot; in honour of the Australian singer Nellie Melba, and in 1897, Melba toast. Other Escoffier creations, famous in their time, were the &quot;bombe Néro&quot; (a flaming ice-cream), &quot;fraises à la Sarah Bernhardt&quot; (for Sarah Bernhardt, strawberries with pineapple and Curaçao sorbet), &quot;baisers de Vierge&quot; (meringue with vanilla cream and crystallised white rose and violet petals) and &quot;suprêmes de volaille Jeannette&quot; (a cold jellied chicken breast with foie gras). He also created &quot;salad Réjane&quot;, after Gabrielle Réjane, and (although this is disputed) &quot;tournedos Rossini&quot;, named for Gioachino Rossini.

===Fraud===
In 1897, the Savoy board of directors began noticing company revenues were falling despite business increasing. They discreetly hired an auditing company who in turn hired a private investigation company that began secretively tailing Ritz, Echenard and Escoffier. After a six-month investigation, they made a report to the board which detailed substantial evidence of fraud.

On 8 March 1898, Ritz, Echenard and Escoffier were brought in front of the board and dismissed from the Savoy &quot;for ... gross negligence and breaches of duty and mismanagement&quot;. They were to leave immediately that day. Most of the kitchen and hotel staff were loyal to Ritz and Escoffier and as news spread disturbances in the Savoy kitchens reached the newspapers, with headlines such as &quot;A Kitchen Revolt at The Savoy&quot;. &quot;The Star&quot; reported: &quot;Three managers have been dismissed and 16 fiery French and Swiss cooks (some of them took their long knives and placed themselves in a position of defiance) have been bundled out by the aid of a strong force of Metropolitan police.&quot; The real details of the dispute did not emerge at first. Ritz and his colleagues even prepared to sue for wrongful dismissal.

Eventually, they settled the case privately: on 3 January 1900, Ritz, Echenard and Escoffier &quot;made signed confessions&quot; but their confessions &quot;were never used or made public&quot;. Escoffier&#x27;s confession was the most serious admitting to an actual crime, taking kickbacks from the Savoy&#x27;s food suppliers worth up to 5% of the resulting purchases. The scheme worked by Escoffier ordering, for example, 600 eggs from a supplier; the supplier would pay Escoffier a bribe and make up the difference by delivering a short-count, for example, 450 eggs, with Escoffier&#x27;s complicity. The Savoy&#x27;s losses totalled more than £16,000 of which Escoffier was to repay £8,000 but he was allowed to settle his debt for £500 since that was all the money he possessed. Ritz paid £4,173 but he denied taking part in any illegal activity; he confessed to being overly generous with gifts to favoured guests and staff, the hotel paying for his home food and laundry, and similar infractions.

==The Ritz and the Carlton==
By the time of their dismissal from the Savoy, however, Ritz and his colleagues were on the way to commercial independence, having established the Ritz Hotel Development Company, for which Escoffier set up the kitchens and recruited the chefs, first at the Paris Ritz (1898), and then at the new Carlton Hotel in London (1899), which soon drew much of the high-society clientele away from the Savoy. In addition to the &quot;haute cuisine&quot; offered at luncheon and dinner, tea at the Ritz became a fashionable institution in Paris, and later in London, though it caused Escoffier real distress: &quot;How can one eat jam, cakes, and pastries, and enjoy dinner – the king of meals – an hour or two later? How can one appreciate the food, the cooking, or the wines?&quot;

In 1913, Escoffier met Kaiser Wilhelm II on board the SS &quot;Imperator&quot;, one of the largest ocean liners of the Hamburg-Amerika Line. The culinary experience on board the &quot;Imperator&quot; was overseen by Ritz, and the restaurant itself was a reproduction of Escoffier&#x27;s Carlton Restaurant in London. Escoffier was charged with supervising the kitchens on board the &quot;Imperator&quot; during the Kaiser&#x27;s visit to France. One hundred and forty-six German dignitaries were served a large multi-course luncheon, followed that evening by a monumental dinner that included the Kaiser&#x27;s favourite strawberry pudding, named &quot;fraises Imperator&quot; by Escoffier for the occasion. The Kaiser was so impressed that he insisted on meeting Escoffier after breakfast the next day, where, as legend has it, he told Escoffier, &quot;I am the Emperor of Germany, but you are the Emperor of Chefs.&quot; This was quoted frequently in the press, further establishing Escoffier&#x27;s reputation as France&#x27;s pre-eminent chef.

Ritz gradually moved into retirement after opening The Ritz Hotel, London, in 1906, leaving Escoffier as the figurehead of the Carlton until his own retirement in 1920. He continued to run the kitchens through the First World War, during which time his younger son was killed in active service. Recalling these years, &quot;The Times&quot; said, &quot;Colour meant so much to Escoffier, and a memory arises of a feast at the Carlton for which the table decorations were white and pink roses, with silvery leaves – the background for a dinner all white and pink, &quot;Borscht&quot; striking the deepest note, &quot;Filets de poulet à la Paprika&quot; coming next, and the &quot;Agneau de lait&quot; forming the high note.&quot;

One of his famous students was Akiyama Tokuzō, Japanese imperial chef in the Ritz Hotel in Paris.

In 1928, he helped create the World Association of Chefs&#x27; Societies and became its first president.

==Légion d&#x27;honneur==
In 1919, at the age of 73, Escoffier was made Knight of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur. In 1928, he was presented with the medal of Officer of the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

==Personal life==
Escoffier married Delphine Daffis on 28 August 1878. She has been described as &quot;a French Poet of some distinction and a member of the Academy&quot;. Escoffier apparently won her hand in a gamble with her father, publisher Paul Daffis, over a game of billiards. They had three children, Paul, Daniel (who was killed in World War I), and Germaine. She died on 6 February 1935.

Escoffier died on 12 February 1935, at the age of 88. He is buried in the family vault at Villeneuve-Loubet.

<doc id="339639" wikidata="Q1677899" url="?curid=339639" title="Mobile Servicing System">
<text>The Mobile Servicing System (MSS), is a robotic system on board the International Space Station (ISS). Launched to the ISS in 2001, it plays a key role in station assembly and maintenance; it moves equipment and supplies around the station, supports astronauts working in space, and services instruments and other payloads attached to the ISS and is used for external maintenance. Astronauts receive specialized training to enable them to perform these functions with the various systems of the MSS.

The MSS is composed of three components:

* the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS), known as Canadarm2.
* the Mobile Remote Servicer Base System (MBS).
* the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM, also known as &quot;Dextre&quot; or &quot;Canada hand&quot;).

The system can move along rails on the Integrated Truss Structure on top of the US provided Mobile Transporter cart which hosts the MRS Base System. The system&#x27;s control software was written in the Ada 95 programming language.

The MSS was designed and manufactured by MDA, (previously divisions of MacDonald Dettwiler Associates called MDA Space Missions, MD Robotics, and previously called SPAR Aerospace) for the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s contribution to the International Space Station.

==Canadarm2==

Officially known as the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS).
Launched on STS-100 in April 2001, this second generation arm is a larger, more advanced version of the Space Shuttle&#x27;s original Canadarm. Canadarm2 is when fully extended and has seven motorized joints (an &#x27;elbow&#x27; hinge in the middle, and three rotary joints at each of the &#x27;wrist/shoulder&#x27; ends). It has a mass of and a diameter of and is made from titanium. The arm is capable of handling large payloads of up to and was able to assist with docking the space shuttle. It is self-relocatable and can move end-over-end to reach many parts of the Space Station in an inchworm-like movement. In this movement, it is limited only by the number of Power Data Grapple Fixtures (PDGFs) on the station. PDGFs located around the station provide power, data and video to the arm through either of its two Latching End Effectors (LEEs). The arm can also travel the entire length of the space station truss using the Mobile Base System.

In addition to moving itself around the station, the arm can move any object with a grapple fixture. In construction of the station the arm was used to move large segments into place. It can also be used to capture unpiloted ships like the SpaceX Dragon, the &quot;Cygnus&quot; spacecraft, and Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV) which are equipped with a standard grapple fixture which the Canadarm2 uses to capture and berth the spacecraft. The arm is also used to unberth and release the spacecraft after use.

On-board operators see what they are doing by looking at the three Robotic Work Station (RWS) LCD screens. The MSS has two RWS units: one in the &quot;Destiny&quot; module and the other in the &quot;Cupola&quot;. Only one RWS controls the MSS at a time. The RWS has two sets of control joysticks: one Rotational Hand Controller (RHC) and one Translational Hand Controller (THC). In addition to this is the Display and Control Panel (DCP) and the Portable Computer System (PCS) laptop.

In recent years, the majority of robotic operations are commanded remotely by flight controllers on the ground at Christopher C. Kraft Jr. Mission Control Center, or from the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s John H. Chapman Space Centre. Operators can work in shifts to accomplish objectives with more flexibility than when done by on-board crew operators, albeit at a slower pace. Astronaut operators are used for time-critical operations such as visiting vehicle captures and robotics-supported extra-vehicular activity.

Some time before 12 May 2021 Canadarm2 was hit by a small piece of orbital debris damaging its thermal blankets and one of the booms. Its operation appeared to be unaffected.

Canadarm 2 will also help to berth the Axiom Space Station modules to the ISS.

===Latching End Effectors===
Canadarm2 has two LEEs, one at each end. A LEE has 3 snare wires to catch the grapple fixture shaft. Another LEE is on the Mobile Base System&#x27;s Payload ORU Accommodations (POA) unit. The POA LEE is used to temporarily hold large ISS components. One more is on the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM, also known as &quot;Dextre&quot; or &quot;Canada hand&quot;). Six LEEs have been manufactured and used in various locations on the ISS.

== Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator ==

The Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator, or &quot;Dextre&quot;, is a smaller two-armed robot that can attach to Canadarm2, the ISS, or the Mobile Base System. The arms and their power tools are capable of handling delicate assembly tasks and changing Orbital Replacement Units (ORUs) currently handled by astronauts during spacewalks. Although Canadarm2 can move around the station in an &quot;inchworm motion&quot;, it is unable to carry anything with it unless Dextre is attached. Testing was done in the space simulation chambers of the Canadian Space Agency&#x27;s David Florida Laboratory in Ottawa, Ontario. The manipulator was launched to the station on 11 March 2008 on STS-123.
==Mobile Base System==

The Mobile Remote Servicer Base System (MBS) is a base platform for the robotic arms. It was added to the station during STS-111 in June 2002. The platform rests atop the Mobile Transporter (installed on STS-110, designed by Northrop Grumman in Carpinteria, CA), which allows it to glide 108 metres down rails on the station&#x27;s main truss. Canadarm2 can relocate by itself, but can&#x27;t carry at the same time, Dextre can&#x27;t relocate by itself. The MBS gives the two robotic arms the ability to travel to work sites all along the truss structure and to step off onto grapple fixtures along the way. When &quot;Canadarm2&quot; and &quot;Dextre&quot; are attached to the MBS, they have a combined mass of . Like &quot;Canadarm2&quot; it was built by MD Robotics and it has a minimum service life of 15 years.

The MBS is equipped with four Power Data Grapple Fixtures, one at each of its four top corners. Any of these can be used as a base for the two robots, Canadarm2 and Dextre, as well as any of the payloads that might be held by them. The MBS also has two locations to attach payloads. The first is the Payload/Orbital Replacement Unit Accommodations (POA). This is a device that looks and functions much like the Latching End Effectors of Canadarm2. It can be used to park, power and command any payload with a grapple fixture, while keeping Canadarm2 free to do something else. The other attachment location is the MBS Common Attachment System (MCAS). This is another type of attachment system that is used to host scientific experiments.

The MBS also supports astronauts during extravehicular activities. It has locations to store tools and equipment, foot-restraints, handrails and safety tether attachment points as well as a camera assembly. If needed, it is even possible for an astronaut to &quot;ride&quot; the MBS while it moves at a top speed of about 1.5 meters per minute. On either side of the MBS are the Crew and Equipment Translation Aids. These carts ride on the same rails as the MBS. Astronauts ride them manually during EVAs to transport equipment and to facilitate their movements around the station.

== Enhanced ISS Boom Assembly ==

Installed on May 27, 2011, is a 15.24 meter (50-foot) boom with handrails and inspection cameras, attached to the end of Canadarm2.
==Other ISS robotics==
The station received a second robotic arm during STS-124, the Japanese Experiment Module Remote Manipulator System (JEM-RMS). The JEM-RMS is primarily used to service the JEM Exposed Facility. An additional robotic arm, the European Robotic Arm (ERA) was launched alongside the Russian-built Multipurpose Laboratory Module on July 15, 2021.

Originally connected to &quot;Pirs,&quot; the ISS also has two Strela cargo cranes. One of the cranes could be extended to reach the end of Zarya. The other could extend to the opposite side and reach the end of Zvezda. The first crane was assembled in space during STS-96 and STS-101. The second crane was launched alongside Pirs itself. The cranes were later moved to the docking compartment &quot;Poisk&quot; and &quot;Zarya&quot; module.

<doc id="339643" wikidata="Q82236" url="?curid=339643" title="Flag of Azerbaijan">
<text>The national flag of Azerbaijan (), often referred to as the tricolour flag (), is a horizontal tricolour that features three equally sized bars of bright blue, red, and green; a white crescent; and a centred eight-pointed star. The flag has become the predominant and most recognizable symbol of Azerbaijan. The bright blue represents Azerbaijan&#x27;s Turkic identity, the red represents progress, and the green represents Islam, which is Azerbaijan&#x27;s majority religion.

The Azerbaijani Flag Day, held every year on 9 November, was established by Law No. 595 on 17 November 2009. The day commemorates the first official adoption of the tricolour as a national flag by the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, which occurred on 9 November 1918. The flag was used by the republic until the 1920 Soviet invasion of Azerbaijan. It was reinstated, with slight variations to the colours and size, on 5 February 1991 following the country&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union.

The flag is referred to in the national constitution and mentioned twice in the national anthem, Azərbaycan marşı. On land, the flag is used as the civil, state and war flag; at sea, it is used as the civil, state, naval ensigns, and the naval jack. The Azerbaijani law regulates the flag&#x27;s use and display, protecting it from desecration. The flag also has official status in Nakhchivan, an autonomous republic within Azerbaijan.

== History ==

=== Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (1918–1920) ===
On 28 May 1918, the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic (ADR) declared independence. One of the first actions of the republic was the adoption of national symbols. Taking inspiration from the flag of the Ottoman Empire, the ADR adopted its first state flag on 21 June 1918, which depicted a white crescent and a white eight-pointed star on a red background. The new flag was almost identical to the old Ottoman Empire flag, which also featured an eight-pointed star until 1844 when it was replaced by a five-pointed star. The similarities between the flags reflected the hegemony of the Ottoman Empire at the time, as well as the ethnic kinship between the Turkic populations of ADR and the Ottoman Empire.

Within a few months, the newly adopted flag began to be questioned due to it exclusively representing Turkism. Thus, it was suggested that a new flag be created. The new flag was to reflect three ideas: Turkism, Islamism and the desire for progress. These ideas reflected the official ideology of ADR, which was &quot;Turkicisation, Islamicization, and Modernisation&quot;. The formation of these ideas was influenced by the work of Islamic ideologist Jamal al-Din al-Afghani who, in his books &quot;The Philosophy of National Unity and the True Essence of Religious Unification&quot; and &quot;Islamic Unity&quot;, wrote that the progress of Muslim peoples is possible under the condition of religious consolidation, national unity and the study of the progressive traditions of European statehood.

On 9 November 1918, a draft of an updated state flag was approved. Created by Ali bey Huseynzade, the new flag was a horizontal tricolour of blue, red and green with a white crescent and an eight-pointed star placed in the centre.

On 7 December 1918, the updated state flag was raised over Azerbaijan&#x27;s parliament building. In a speech to the parliament, Mammad Amin Rasulzade, the Azerbaijani National Council chairman who had declared ADR&#x27;s independence, stated: &quot;[...] and for this reason, gentlemen, the National Council has raised this three-coloured flag, which represents Azerbaijan, and this flag, the symbol of Turkic sovereignty, Islamic culture, and modern European power, will always fly above us. This flag, once raised, will never come down again&quot;.

==== Use of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic flag after 1920 ====

After the fall of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic in April 1920 following the Red Army invasion, their flag was used by emigrant organizations outside the Soviet Union. During World War II, the ADR flag was used by the battalions of the Azerbaijani Legion, who were military formations of ethnic Azerbaijanis fighting on the side of Nazi Germany. Depicted on the sleeve emblems of the Azerbaijan Legion&#x27;s uniforms were three horizontal equal stripes of blue, red and green; a white crescent; and a five-pointed star on a red field.

The ADR flag was used during a congress of Azerbaijanis headed by former Soviet Azerbaijani major Abdurrahman Fatalibeyli, held in Berlin, Germany on 6 November 1943. In 1922, Mammad Amin Rasulzade fled from Soviet Russia, through Finland and to Turkey. While there in 1952, he made a copy of the ADR flag, which he later gave to his friend Gulmirza Baghirov. Baghirov secretly brought the flag to Azerbaijan and hung it on his home in Maştağa in 1976. It was given to the National Museum of History of Azerbaijan in July 2003 and has since been kept in the museum.

In 1956, a protester named Jahid Hilaloghlu raised the ADR flag over Maiden Tower in Baku, showing his defiance of Soviet Azerbaijan. Hilaloghlu was sentenced to four years of imprisonment and his supporter Chingiz Abdullayev was institutionalized.

=== Azerbaijan SSR (1920–1991) ===
On 28 April 1920, Azerbaijan became a Soviet republic, as the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic (Soviet Azerbaijan). The state flags of the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic were banned during this period. While under Soviet rule, the Soviet Azerbaijan used eight different flags. Most of the flags only variated slightly. The adaptations were the result of the chaotic early years of the Soviet Union in the Caucasus. The first unofficial Soviet Azerbaijan flag was used during the Soviet conquest of Baku on 28 April 1920.

Soviet Azerbaijan&#x27;s first official flag was adopted on 19 May 1921, in its first constitution under Article 104. At the time, the state language of Soviet Azerbaijan was Azerbaijani Turkic and its alphabet was based on the Arabic script. Therefore, the words &quot;A.S.R.&quot; were written in Arabic. The eighth and final flag of Soviet Azerbaijan was issued on 7 October 1952. The design was similar to the Soviet national flag but included a horizontal blue band on the bottom, which took up a quarter of the flag&#x27;s height. The flag&#x27;s definition was as follows:

=== Republic of Azerbaijan (1991–present) ===

In the late 1980s, during unrest in Soviet Azerbaijan, the tricolour Azerbaijan Democratic Republic flag was used in demonstrations calling for independence. On 17 November 1990, during the first session of the Supreme Assembly of the Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic, the 1918 ADR flag was adopted as the national flag of the autonomous state. This flag was later adopted with the decree, &quot;On change the name and national flag of Azerbaijan SSR&quot;. The decree was issued on 29 November 1990 by the president of Azerbaijan SSR and ratified on 5 February 1991 by the Supreme Soviet of the Azerbaijan SSR. The first constitution since independence was adopted on 12 November 1995 after a national vote; one of the articles described the three-colour flag of the republic.

On 17 November 2007, the Azerbaijani president Ilham Aliyev issued a decree &quot;On creation of the National Flag Square&quot; in Baku. The square had a 162 metre tall flag pole weighing 220 tons. The flag flown on the pole was 35 metres wide and 70 metres long, and weighed 350 kilograms. A museum dedicated to the national flag was also built at the flagpole. On 1 September 2010, the flag was officially raised to open the museum; subsequently becoming the world&#x27;s tallest unsupported flagpole, until being overtaken by Tajikistan 165 metre Dushanbe Flagpole in 2011. The flagpole was dismantled in 2017 due the risks of the structure falling onto Baku Boulevard grounds.

== Design ==

The national flag of Azerbaijan consists of three horizontal stripes of equal width, from top to bottom: light blue, red, and green. A white crescent and an eight-pointed star are in the centre. The basic description of the flag, along with its ratio, is indicated in the Constitution of Azerbaijan:

Further specifications of the flag were detailed in the presidential decree, &quot;On the National Flag of the Republic of Azerbaijan&quot;, issued on 5 February 1991. The ratio was kept at 1:2, which was used during the Soviet era. Each stripe fully extends to one-third of the flag&#x27;s total height. The star and crescent are placed in the centre of the red stripe. The outside diameter of both the crescent and the red inside circle intersects with the diameter of the star. The diameter of the star is one-sixth the height of the flag, while the inscribed circle within the star is one-twelfth the height of the flag.

=== Colour ===
The flag is coloured green, red, sky blue, and white. The exact specifications for its colours were issued in the 2004 decree &quot;On the Rules of the National Flag of the Republic of Azerbaijan&quot;.
The colour scheme used in 1918–1920, and between 1991 and 2013 is as follows:

The colours, updated in 2013 and ratified in 2018 and specified in Pantone, are as follows:

=== Symbolism ===
The bright blue symbolizes the Turkic heritage of Azerbaijan, the red reflects the creation of a modern state and the development of democracy, and green symbolizes Islam. In the centre of the flag, appearing on both the front and the back, there is a crescent and star, comprising a white crescent and an eight-pointed star.

While the crescent and star are typically seen as markers of Islam, some historians and researchers disagree about why the eight-pointed star is on the flag. Fatali Khan Khoyski points to the eight letters in the word &quot;Azerbaijan&quot; (آذربایجان) when written in Arabic. The eight points of the star are also thought to stand for the eight Turkic peoples classified in pre-Soviet times: Azeris, Ottomans (Turks), Jagatais, Tatars, Kipchaks, Seljuks, and Turkomans. It is possible the Kipchaks actually reflect two peoples, the Kazakhs and Kyrgyz, which would make eight.

== Protocol ==

According to Article 2 of Law No. 683 of the Republic of Azerbaijan, dated 8 June 2004 (as amended on 1 September 2005), the national flag must be raised by the following:


The national flag must also be raised over the buildings, military courts and headquarters of military units and naval vessels of the Armed Forces of the Republic of Azerbaijan in the following cases:
* During the public holidays
* During the military oath
* In the case of awarding of military units or military courts
* When a military unit or military vessel is located on the territory of another country

When hanging upright without a flagpole, the Azerbaijani flag must be placed on the wall of the building in a vertical position, so that the green side of the flag appears on the left.

=== Legal protection ===
Flag desecration in Azerbaijan is considered a crime. According to Article 324 Criminal Code of Azerbaijan &quot;Desecration of the State Flag or the State Emblem of the Republic of Azerbaijan&quot; is punishable by restriction of liberties for up to two years or imprisonment for up to one year. Desecration can be expressed in the commission by persons over the age of 16 of a wide variety of active public actions, indicating a disrespectful attitude towards the flag, for example, its destruction, damage, or cynical drawings or inscriptions.

== State Flag Day ==

The Day of the State Flag of Azerbaijan was established by Law No. 595, enacted 17 November 2009 by president Ilham Aliyev. It is held annually on 9 November. The date is considered a non-working day in the country. During his speech at the opening ceremony of the State Flag Square, Ilham Aliyev stated that the reason for signing the order on 17 November was that the ADR flag was reinstated as the state flag of Republic of Azerbaijan on 17 November 1990.

== Influence ==
The expression by Rasulzade (; &quot;The flag once raised will never fall!&quot;) was the rallying cry of Azerbaijani independence in early 20th century. In 1919, Jafar Jabbarly wrote the poem, &quot;To Azerbaijani flag&quot; in dedication to the state symbols of Azerbaijan.

The national flag is also mentioned in the national anthem of Azerbaijan, &quot;Azərbaycan marşı&quot; (), in the fifth and fifteenth sentences. The passages have the following unofficial English translation: &quot;With three colour banner live happily!&quot; and &quot;To hold high your honoured flag.&quot;

<doc id="339646" wikidata="Q1009209" url="?curid=339646" title="Dennis, Massachusetts">
<text>Dennis is a town in Barnstable County, Massachusetts, United States, located near the center of the Cape Cod peninsula. It is a seaside resort town with colonial mansions along the northern Cape Cod Bay coastline and beaches along the southern Nantucket Sound. As of the 2020 census, its population was 14,674. 

The town encompasses five villages, each with its own post office: Dennis (including North Dennis), Dennis Port, East Dennis, South Dennis, and West Dennis.

== History ==
Indigenous peoples have been living in the Cape Cod region for at least 9,000 years. The historic Algonquian-speaking Wampanoag are one of 69 tribes of the original Wampanoag Nation.

After being settled by English colonists of the New Plymouth Colony in 1639 as part of the town of Yarmouth, Dennis became known as the East Precinct. The northern sections of the town were called Nobscussett, Sesuit and Quivet by the original inhabitants.

The town was named after resident minister Reverend Josiah Dennis. Dennis officially separated from Yarmouth in 1793. Lacking farmable land, seafaring became the town&#x27;s major industry in its early history. Beginning around the 1830s, activity in the area centered around the construction of boats in the Shiverick Shipyard.

The Cape Playhouse in northern Dennis, established in 1927, is one of the oldest summer theaters in the United States. Notable past and present Dennis residents include author Mary Higgins Clark, actress Bette Davis, and actress Amy Jo Johnson.

==Geography==

The town of Dennis spans the width of Cape Cod, with Cape Cod Bay to the north, Brewster to the northeast, Harwich to the southeast, Nantucket Sound to the south, and Yarmouth to the west. The town is about east of Barnstable, east of the Sagamore Bridge, and southeast of Boston.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land, and , or 7.88%, is water.

The town lies on the eastern banks of the Bass River, which almost divides the Cape in half. There are several small ponds and lakes in town, as well as Sesuit Harbor to the north and West Dennis Harbor to the south.

The level south side of the town was formed primarily from glacial outwash. Bass River and Swan Pond River were carved in the outwash plain by large flows of water off of Laurentide Ice Sheet of the Wisconsin glaciation.

The north and south shores of the town have many beaches, as well as the Dennis Yacht Club in the north and West Dennis Yacht Club in the south.

===Dennis===

Chapin Memorial Beach, which was previously known as Black Flats for its black sands and extensive tidal flats, was named in honor of George H. Chapin, who was a real estate developer that donated the land to the Town after World War II. Chase Garden Creek empties into Cape Cod Bay at Chapin Beach and serves as a boundary between Dennis and Yarmouth. It was named for the Chase family, settlers who were on the Cape around 1638.

The area leading to Chapin Beach has alternatively been known as Little Italy and Little Taunton for the Italian immigrants who came by way of Taunton, Massachusetts in the late 1800s to build the railroad on Cape Cod. Many streets in the area, such as Squadrilli Way, Dr. Botero Road, Spadoni Road, and Angelo Road, as well as Lombardi Heights, were named for Italians. The area known as New Boston, including a road and a river, was named for a group of Bostonians who settled in the area.

Corporation Beach, which is also sometimes called Nobscussett Beach, was named for the Nobscussett Point Pier Corporation. It is located on the east side of Nobscussett Point. There was once an Indian village at Nobscussett Point and Harbor, which is also called the Bite, a misspelling of bight. Nobscussett is possibly related to the Algonquian word &quot;&#x27;wanashqu&#x27;,&quot; which means at the end of the rock. 

Mayflower Beach, named after the failed Mayflower Beach Condominiums Complex, was acquired by the Town in 1977 by eminent domain. At the other end of Mayflower Beach is Bayview Beach. Hippogriffe Road was named after a 678-ton clipper ship built in 1852 at the Shiverick Yards. 

===Dennis Port===
Dennis Port was named by Thomas Howes, the village&#x27;s first postmaster, in 1850. Previously, it had been known as Crooks Neck, after Samuel Crook, an Indian who sold the land to English settlers in the 17th century. The name changed to Crookers Neck before becoming Dennis Port.

Glendon Road, and the beach named after the street, took their name from Hubert Glendon, a Marine officer who served as the Columbia University rowing coach after World War II, and who donated the beach to the village. To the west is Peter Hagis Beach, which is located on land donated by his widow. Also in the village is Inman Road Beach, named for the Inman family (including Isaiah Inman) who lived on the corner of Lower County Road. Raycroft Beach was named after Louis B. Raycroft, who often summered near Old Wharf Road and Sea Street.

The Plashes, a term which means &quot;a small collection of standing water,&quot; is a conservation area with several small ponds and creeks that connect them. On the Harwich line is White Pond, which is named because of the way the light hits the water. It was formerly known as Aunt Lizzie Robbins Pond, named after a member of the Robbins family of Harwich, who arrived on the Cape in the early 1700s. Swan Pond took its name from the Algonquin word &quot;sowan&quot;, meaning south. It is also known as Jamies Pond, after James Chase.

Depot Street was named for the train station that once existed in the village. Searsville Road was named in honor of the Sears family, which was once prominent in East Dennis.

===East Dennis===
Cold Storage Road, and the beach of the same name, were named after the fish storehouses in the area in the early 1900s. Off of Cold Storage Road is Saltworks Road, named after the salt works built in the 1700s by Captain John Sears. Dennis was once the Cape&#x27;s leader in making salt, but the works closed in 1888 after salt mines in New York were opened. East Dennis was once known as Searsville, for the Sears family.

On the border with Brewster is Quivet Creek, which was once called Bound Brook. The Indians of the area called it Shuckquan, possibly from a word which means &quot;spring fish.&quot; The creek runs next to Crowe&#x27;s Pasture. It was once known as Indian Land as Crowe was a common name for families with white and Indian spouses. It is, along with Chapin Beach, one of two beaches in the town on which vehicles are allowed.

Sesuit Creek runs into Sesuit Harbor, with Sesuit Neck to the west, before emptying into Cape Cod Bay. In the 1800s, Asa Shiverick and his three sons built schooners, brigs, and clipper ships in the harbor. Two of the Clippers weighed more than 1,000 tons. A plaque honoring the shipyard, which closed in the 1860s, was placed in 1924. Shiverick Road near the harbor honors the family. Wild Hunter Road is named after the Shiverick-built clipper, &quot;Wild Hunter,&quot; which sailed as far as China.

===South Dennis===

The area of Scargo Lake and Scargo Hill in Dennis are associated with ancient Native American folklore. When viewed from Scargo Tower atop the hill, Scargo Lake appears to have the shape of a fish. The lake is a glacial kettle pond and the hills on the northern side of the town are moraines, formed from gravel and debris left by the glacier.

There are several legends about the creation of the lake. One says that an Indian named Maushop dug out the pond, and then lit his pipe. The smoke from the pipe attracted dark clouds, from which rain fell and filled the pond. More common is the story of a princess who was given three fish in a pumpkin by a young brave going off to war. He was gone so long that the fish began to outgrow the pumpkin. The princess had the women of the village dig the pond so the fish could survive, and the dirt the women dug out became Scargo Hill. Today it is the highest hill in the mid-Cape area. A stone tower commemorating Thomas Tobey, who settled in Dennis in 1678, was built in 1902. The Tobey family gave the tower to the Town in 1929.

Airline Road was so named because much of it runs in a straight line between Routes 134 and 6A. Nearby side streets also have aeronautical names, including Propeller Lane, Pilot Drive, Wing Lane, and Jet Drive. A series of streets off Kelly&#x27;s Bay, just north of the Mid-Cape Highway, received their name for the supposed visit of Vikings to Cape Cod. Norseman, Lief Ericson, Thorwald, Freydis, Viking, and Vinland Drives are all named for the seafaring Scandinavians. Kelly&#x27;s Bay took its name from David O&#x27;Kelia, who came to Cape Cod from his native Northern Ireland in the late 1600s. It is part of the Bass River. Prince Street is named for Thomas Prence who, as the governor of Plymouth Colony, lived on Cape Cod.

Upstream from Kelly&#x27;s Bay is Follins Pond. Quaker Road, which runs to the pond, is named for the Quakers who built a meetinghouse there. Highbank Road crosses the Bass River into Yarmouth, where the riverbanks are tall. It was once known as the upper bridge, with the lower bridge in West Dennis. Near Wilbur Cove on the river is the Wilbur Preserve, named for Dr. George B. Wilbur, who gave the land to the Town in the 1970s.

Hokum Rock Road, where a drive-in movie theater once stood, is named after a cluster of stones named Hokum Rock. The name may come from the Indian word for &quot;back bend,&quot; &quot;hockanum&quot;, referring to the largest of the rocks which is hooked. The access road leading to the town dump, Theophilus F. Smith Road, was named for the long-time superintendent of the dump.

Flax Pond was named because early residents would soak bundles of flax in the pond until the pulp would separate and could be used to spin linen. Just south at the head of the Bass River is Follins Pond, named for the 17th-century settler Thomas Follins. The &quot;fun&quot; in Funn Pond, at the Dennis Pines golf course, is a shortened version of Funnell, or charcoal burner.

===West Dennis===
Part of West Dennis is known as Baker Town, for the Baker family that once resided on and around Main Street in South and West Dennis. The Bakers sent 29 captains to sea, and the Ezra Baker School and the Baker Park in West Dennis are named after family members. Peter Petlz&#x27;s poem describes the influence the family had in the area:
The English were prolific,

On Cape Cod&#x27;s Sandy shores,

And if you don&#x27;t believe it,

Look at all the Bakers.
Aunt Julia Ann Road, and a beach with the same name, are found on the Bass River, across from the Bass River Golf Club. They are named after Julia Ann Baker, the third wife and widow of Levi Baker. After he died, she kept a supply store for fishermen, Levi&#x27;s Chandlery. Near the beach, on Grand Cove, is Crowell Village. It was named for the Crowell or Crowe family. Henry David Thoreau passed over a toll bridge here during one of his trips to the Cape. The area was once known as Crowe Town and Crowe&#x27;s Neck. Also on the neck is Horsefoot Road, and next to that is Horse foot Cove. Horse foot refers to a horseshoe crab.

West Dennis Beach was once known as Davis Beach, and the road that runs along the length of the beach is called Davis Beach Road. Charles Henry Davis sold the beach to the Town in the early 1900s. At the east end of the beach, on Lighthouse Road, is the Lighthouse Inn where a lighthouse was built in 1855 and was in service until 1914. Recently, the West Dennis Light has been restored as an aid to navigation and operates during the summer months.

Kelly&#x27;s Pond was probably named after David and Elihu Kelly, who lived nearby in the early 1800s. The area between Kelly&#x27;s Pond and the Bass River is known as Wrinkle Point. Wrinkle is another word for periwinkle. Uncle Barney&#x27;s Road, which runs up Wrinkle Point parallel to the Bass River, was named after Barnabas Baker, who had a salt works in the area in the 1800s.

The area between Weir Creek and Swan River was once known as Battletown and Lower County Road was called Battle town Road. It was said by a late 1800s resident of the road, Anthony Gage, that &quot;Men used to raise sons to sender down her to fight.&quot;

South Village was a fishing hamlet in West Dennis during its early days. The name is memorialized by South Village Road, Lane, Circle, Drive, and Beach. At one end of South Village Road is Trotting Park Road, which took its name from the popular race track that was off the street in the late 1800s. At the northern end of the road is a house named Jericho. It was built by Captain Theophilus Baker in 1801 and was purchased in the 20th century by Virginia Gildersleeve and Elizabeth Reynard. They gave the house its present name because its walls were about to come &quot;tumbling down&quot;. Repairs were made and the house was given to the town in 1962.

Some of them have different names for different entrances. On the Northside, Corporation Beach and Howes Street Beach are on the same strip of public beach. The same goes for Mayflower Beach and Bayview* Beach, Cold Storage* Beach, and Sea Street Beach. Chapin Beach and Harborview* Beach are not paired with any other.

With neighboring Yarmouth, Dennis is home to the Yarmouth–Dennis Red Sox, an amateur collegiate summer baseball team in the Cape Cod Baseball League. The team plays at Red Wilson Field and has featured dozens of players who went on to careers in Major League Baseball such as Craig Biggio, Buster Posey, and Chris Sale.

In addition to the beaches, there are several key recreation areas in the town. Johnny Kelley Recreation area in South Dennis provides a hiking/jogging trail, an exercise trail, a Braille trail, playing courts and fields, a playground, and a picnic area. The Nobscussett Conservation Area (usually called &quot;Indian Lands&quot;) provides hiking trails and views along the protected shores of Bass River, where the Nobscussett spent their winters. Crowe&#x27;s Pasture on the north side of the town provides many acres of open land and hiking with water views. Bass River Park in West Dennis offers fine views of Bass River and the boating activity there. Popular children&#x27;s playgrounds are found at the Baker School in West Dennis, at the West Dennis Community Building, and the village green in Dennis Port.

==Transportation==
Dennis is crossed from east to west by Cape Cod&#x27;s three main routes; U.S. Route 6, Massachusetts Route 6A and Massachusetts Route 28. Massachusetts Route 134 crosses the town south to north from Route 28 to Route 6A. East of the Route 134 exit, Route 6 (also known as the Mid-Cape Highway) downgrades from a four-lane divided highway to a two-lane limited access highway, divided only by markers.

Before 2018, the Cape&#x27;s Bay Colony Rail service officially ended in the town just west of Route 134. Although the right of way for this line probably existed, there has long been no railroad bridge over Bass River and therefore no trains have entered the town of Dennis for decades. In approximately 2018, this railway was removed, which allowed for the expansion of the Cape Cod Rail Trail. Construction of the extension included a pedestrian bridge over Bass River, which connected the trail to Yarmouth. The Cape Cod Rail Trail is a paved bicycle trail that runs &quot;down&quot; the Cape to Wellfleet along the former right-of-way of the railway. There are also several other bicycle trails in town. The nearest regional air service is at the Barnstable Municipal Airport, and the nearest national and international air service is at Logan International Airport in Boston.

==Government==
The town of Dennis is governed by an open town meeting form of government and is led by a board of selectmen, which delegates day-to-day operations to a town administrator. The town has a police department, and the fire department is headquartered near the intersection of Routes 28 and 134 with a branch station off of Route 6A. There are libraries in each of the five villages. The central library is located in Dennis Port, and all are a part of the Cape Libraries Automated Materials Sharing library network. The town operates its own landfill, located southeast of the junction of Routes 6 and 134.

Dennis is represented in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in the First Barnstable District. The town is represented in the Massachusetts Senate as a part of the Cape and Islands District, which includes all of Cape Cod (except the towns of Bourne, Falmouth, and Sandwich), and the islands of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket. The town is patrolled by the Second (Yarmouth) Barracks of Troop D of the Massachusetts State Police.

Dennis is in the Massachusetts 9th congressional district and represented by William Keating. The state&#x27;s senior (Class II) member of the United States Senate, elected in 2012, is Elizabeth Warren. The junior (Class I) senator, elected in 2013, is Ed Markey.

==Education==
Dennis shares its school system with Yarmouth to form the Dennis-Yarmouth Regional School District. The town itself operates the Ezra H. Baker School, which serves students from pre-kindergarten through third grade. Students in grades 4 through 7 attend Dennis-Yarmouth Intermediate/Middle School. High school students and 8th graders attend Dennis-Yarmouth Regional High School in Yarmouth. Students are not officially contracted to any vocational high schools; private schools can be found in each of the neighboring towns.

<text>Raúl Alberto Lastiri (11 September 1915 – 11 December 1978) was an Argentine politician who was interim president of Argentina from 13 July 1973 until 12 October 1973. Lastiri, who presided over the Argentine Chamber of Deputies, was promoted to the presidency of the country after Héctor Cámpora and Vicente Solano Lima resigned, he called new elections and delivered the country&#x27;s government to Juan Perón, who won in September with over 60% of the votes.

==Biography==

===Family===
His father, José María Lastiri, was born in Almandoz, Navarre in northern Spain, while his mother, María Ferrari was born in Rome, Lazio in central Italy. He has nine siblings.

===Rise to power and fall===
His brief tenure marked a turn towards right-wing policies and factions within the Peronist Party. His father-in-law, José López Rega, a P2 member and the creator of the paramilitary organization &quot;Triple A&quot;, was confirmed as Minister of Social Welfare. Alberto Juan Vignes replaced Puig in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Benito Llambí took over from Esteban Righi as Minister of Interior. In spite of this, Argentine foreign policy kept a Third World orientation; for example, in August 1973, Argentina granted Cuba a US$ 200 million loan to buy machinery and cars.

José Ber Gelbard, also confirmed as Economy Minister, continued with his previous policy, nationalizing bank deposits and announced a &quot;Triennial Plan&quot; for development.

Anti-government leftist violence experienced sustained growth in the last days of his presidency. On September 25 a Montoneros commando allegedly killed José Ignacio Rucci, Secretary-General of the CGT National trade union center and Perón&#x27;s good friend. The same month, the Ejército Revolucionario del Pueblo (ERP) had assaulted the Army medical unit located at Parque Patricios, a neighbourhood of Buenos Aires, killing an officer. This action served to justify the ERP illegalization and the closedown of the newspaper &quot;El Mundo&quot;.

Lastiri handed over the presidency to Perón on 12 October 1973. He remained as President of the Chamber of Deputies until 17 July 1975 when replaced by Nicasio Sánchez Sorondo. Lastiri&#x27;s links to José López Rega resulted in the end of his political career when the latter marched to exile after being accused of abuse of power and corruption. 

Lastiri was put under house arrest when the military dictatorship took power on 24 March 1976 and died on 11 December 1978. 

====Propaganda Due====
Lastiri was on Licio Gelli&#x27;s list of P2 members, a masonic lodge, discovered in 1980.

==Honours and awards==
===Foreign honours===
* Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (1973)
* Order of the White Lion, 2nd Class (1974)

<doc id="339660" wikidata="Q139979" url="?curid=339660" title="Zaculeu">
<text>Zaculeu or Saqulew is a pre-Columbian Maya archaeological site in the highlands of western Guatemala, about outside the modern city of Huehuetenango. Occupation at the site dates to the Early Classic period (AD 250–600) of Mesoamerican history. Zaculeu was the capital of the Postclassic Mam kingdom, and was conquered by the Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj. It displays a mixture of Mam and Kʼicheʼ style architecture.

In AD 1525 the city was attacked by Spanish conquistadors under Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras during a siege that lasted several months. Kayb&#x27;il B&#x27;alam, the city&#x27;s last ruler, finally surrendered to the Spanish due to starvation.

The site contains a number of temple-pyramids with talud-tablero style architecture and double stairways. The pyramids and governmental palaces are grouped around a series of large public plazas. The site also holds a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame. The site was originally fortified with walls.

The site was restored by the United Fruit Company in the late 1940s. It is open to tourists and includes a small museum.

==Etymology and location==
The name Zaculeu means &quot;white earth&quot; in the Mam, Kʼicheʼ and Q&#x27;anjob&#x27;al languages, from &quot;saq&quot; (adj) meaning &quot;white&quot; and &quot;ulew&quot; (n) meaning &quot;earth&quot;. In the Mam language, the site is also called &quot;Chinabajul.&quot;

The present-day village of San Lorenzo developed around this archeological site, on the outskirts of Huehuetenango city, in the Guatemalan department of Huehuetenango. Zaculeu is the main tourist attraction in the Huehuetenango area. Zaculeu is located at an altitude of above mean sea level, and is bordered by the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes mountain range.

Zaculeu is located in an area of fertile soils close to the Selegua and Viña rivers. The site is situated on a plateau overlooking the Selegua River, which flows to the west of the city. Deep ravines bordering the site to the south and east protected its access. The only access to the site is via a narrow land bridge to the north, which unites the plateau to the general level of the valley floor. The Zaculeu plateau measures 11,178 square varas (4191 square metres).

==History==
Zaculeu was first occupied in the Early Classic Period (AD 250–600), and the buildings from this era show the architectural influence of the great metropolis of Teotihuacán in the Valley of Mexico. The largest constructions date from the Classic Period (AD 250–900). To these were added other plaza groups and buildings in the Early Postclassic (AD 900–1200) and Late Postclassic (AD 1200–1525) in an unbroken history. Zaculeu has been used as a ceremonial site by Mam Maya continuously to the present.

Zaculeu came under the influence of central Mexico again in the Late Classic. The architectural influence is so distinct that it suggests that a foreign Mexican elite may have settled at the city and continued in occupation there until the Kʼicheʼ conquered the site in the Postclassic.

===Kʼicheʼ conquest===
The Kʼicheʼ Kingdom of Qʼumarkaj conquered Zaculeu in the Postclassic. Traditionally that has been calculated as during the 15th century AD based on ethnohistoric accounts. Radiocarbon dating has pushed back the calculations of the Kʼicheʼ conquests by three centuries, and researchers now say their conquest of the Mam kingdoms may have taken place as early as the 12th century. The city was dominated by the Kʼicheʼ until the Spanish Conquest of the early 16th century.
The Kʼicheʼ king Q&#x27;uq&#x27;umatz died in battle against a group of the northern Mam. His son K&#x27;iq&#x27;ab continued where his father had left off and completed the conquest of the people. K&#x27;iq&#x27;ab was ruler when Zaculeu was conquered by the Kʼicheʼ.&#x27; This appears to have been a second Kʼicheʼ conquest of the city, having previously fallen some time earlier. When the Kʼicheʼ conquered another kingdom, its practice was to place the newly subject kingdom under the control of one of the Kʼicheʼ noble lineages. Based on the style of Structure 4, archeologists believe that Zaculeu was likely controlled by the Nija&#x27;ib.&#x27; The Ilocab, who had conquered much of the region, are another possibility. The Kʼicheʼ tended to place their newly installed ruling elite in a mountain-top fortress securing the population in the valleys below. However, substantial portions of the original Mam population remained in place in the plateau area.

The Kʼicheʼ rebuilt over earlier Classic period structures in a distinctively Kʼicheʼ style. The basic Kʼicheʼ layout consists of a westward-facing temple with a steep talud-tablero facade, flanked by two unequally sized wings. This was likely to have been the temple of &quot;Awilix,&quot; patron goddess of the Nija&#x27;ib&#x27; Kʼicheʼ. A longer palace structure lies to the north, facing southwards and the ballcourt to the southwest. This Kʼicheʼ layout was somewhat distorted by the reuse of the earlier architecture, because the typical Mam settlement layout was built along an axis running from southeast to northwest. As the Kʼicheʼ did not completely redesign the entire site along a Kʼicheʼ pattern, the juxtaposition of Mam- and Kʼicheʼ-style complexes demonstrates the fusing of the local and intrusive elite lineages.

Excavations have uncovered examples of metalwork at Zaculeu. These were small ornamental pieces. An example is a representation of a butterfly worked from &quot;tumbaga,&quot; an alloy of gold and copper, dated to the Postclassic period.

===Spanish conquest===
Although hostilities existed between the Mam and the Kʼicheʼ of Qʼumarkaj after the rebellion of the Kaqchikel people against their Kʼicheʼ allies, the arrival of the Spanish conquistadors shifted the political landscape. Conquistador Pedro de Alvarado described how the Mam king Kayb&#x27;il B&#x27;alam was received with great honour in Qʼumarkaj.

At the time of the Spanish Conquest, the main Mam population was situated in Xinabahul (also spelled &quot;Chinabjul&quot;), now the city of Huehuetenango. They retreated to Zaculeu as a refuge during the Spanish attacks because of its fortifications. The refuge was attacked by Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras, brother of conquistador Pedro de Alvarado, in 1525, with 120 soldiers, and some 2,000 Mexican and Kʼicheʼ allies. The city was defended by Kayb&#x27;il B&#x27;alam commanding some 5,000 people (the chronicles are not clear if this is the number of soldiers or the total population of Zaculeu).

After a siege lasting several months, the Mam were reduced to starvation. Kayb&#x27;il B&#x27;alam finally surrendered the city to the Spanish in October 1525. When the Spanish entered the city, they found 1,800 dead Indians, with the survivors eating the corpses of the dead. The Spanish forced the abandonment of Zaculeu after they built the new city of Huehuetenango some away.

===Modern history===
American explorer John Lloyd Stephens and English architect Frederick Catherwood visited the site in 1840, at which time it was a confused jumble of overgrown ruins. Stephens published a description of the archaeological remains a year later. Catherwood did not draw any of the structures due to the poor state of the remains. The two excavated one of the mounds and recovered some ceramic vessels, which Catherwood drew.

On 24 April 1931, Guatemala declared the site as a National Monument under the name of &quot;Tzaculeu&quot;. On 23 February 1946, the site was renamed as Zaculeu. The government gave a license to excavate to the United Fruit Company, which immediately began archaeological excavations and related restorations of the structures under the direction of John M. Dimick. This later included re-coating a number of the buildings with white plaster, as it was known that many were originally finished that way. This has seldom been done in other restorations of Pre-Columbian buildings.

On 12 June 1970 the site was declared a National Precolumbian Monument by accord of the Guatemalan Ministry of Education (MINEDUC).

==Site description==

Zaculeu was likely originally developed because of its proximity to the Seleguá River, providing a permanent water supply and transportation waterway, together with its easily defensible hilltop location. Zaculeu has 43 structures. The majority of construction activity took place in one burst in the Early Classic, with minor alterations thereafter. The smaller platforms situated in the plazas were late additions; they show the influence of central Mexican civilization. The entrance to the site was via a narrow land bridge to the north, which was protected by a fortified structure that occupied three-quarters of the width of the land bridge.

The ceremonial centre of the city consisted of 43 structures clustered in an area of . The architecture at the site includes talud-tablero style buildings with double stairways. The facades of some of the buildings have cylindrical columns, a feature found in other parts of Mesoamerica. Artefacts recovered from the site include items fashioned from turquoise and precious metals. The metal artefacts crafted from gold, silver and copper and their alloys demonstrate the city&#x27;s participation in the wider trade networks of the Postclassic Period. These metal artefacts were either influenced by or imported from Mexico and southern Central America.

The structures at Zaculeu were grouped around small plazas and were generally built from masonry, coated with a thick layer of plaster. Fragments bear floral and geometric designs, indicating the structures were originally brightly painted. Stones were undressed and cemented in adobe mortar. No evidence of corbel vaulting has been found and very little in the way of stone sculpture. The architecture completely lacks stone sculpture. Burials from the Early Classic yielded a rich array of finds, but Late Classic burials were accompanied by a lesser variety of grave offerings.
An Early Classic tomb was inserted under the main pyramid at Zaculeu; it had been tunnelled from the volcanic ash underlying the structure. A broad stairway descended to the tomb from the main plaza. The tomb interior was painted red and the floor was scattered with the remains of more than 100 ceramic vessels. These were crushed when the roof of the tomb collapsed. Also found were the remains of 34 pyrite mirrors of a type similar to those found at Kaminaljuyu. A sizeable quantity of jade was recovered from the tomb, including beads and earplugs. Some of the jade beads had been carved to represent human and parrot faces. The tomb contained the bones of four or more individuals. The ceramic offerings included decorated tripod vessels, polychrome bowls and a polychrome cylindrical vase that had a painted band of hieroglyphs. One ceramic bowl is painted in a negative painting style that is similar to finds from Nebaj.

The site core is laid out around eight plazas. Some of the structures were restored by the United Fruit Company; most of these border Plazas 1 and 2. Structures 1 and 2 are pyramid temples. Structures 4, 6 and 10 are palace structures, long buildings with internal chambers and benches used as residences and for administrative purposes.

===Plazas===
Plaza 1 is the main plaza at the site. It measures and is closed on all four sides by pyramid temples.

Plaza 2 is a large plaza at the southeast of the site core, south of Plaza 1. It is bordered on the southeastern side by Structure 4, on the northeast by Structure 1, on the northwest by the ballcourt and on the southwest by Plaza 3.

Plaza 3 is a small plaza at the southern extreme of the site core, southwest of Plaza 2 and south of the ballcourt.

Plaza 4 is at the northwest side of the site core. It is closed on the northeastern side by Structure 10, on the southeast by Structure 13 and on the southwest by the ballcourt. Plazas 5 and 6 are located immediately to the west.

Plaza 5 is a small plaza immediately west of Plaza 4 and northwest of the ballcourt. It is divided from Plaza 6 to the northwest by Structure 21.

Plaza 6 is another small plaza to the west of Plaza 4. It is enclosed on three sides by a building complex with Structure 21 on the southeast side.

Plaza 7 is a small plaza at the western extreme of the site core, to the west of Plazas 5 and 6.

Plaza 8 is an enclosed plaza to the southwest of the ballcourt. Structure 2, a pyramid, closes the northwest side and Structure 3 closes the southeast side.

===Structures===

Structure 1 is a high pyramid on the southeast side of Plaza 1. It has eight stepped sections topped by a summit shrine. The shrine has three doorways approached via a double stairway rising from the plaza below. The pyramid was rebuilt seven times with the visible remains dating to the Early Postclassic. The earliest phase of construction dates to the Early Classic period.

Structure 2 is a pyramid on the northwest side of the sunken Plaza 8. It is largely unrestored. Structure 3 lies across the plaza to the southeast. It is a platform with a twin stairway facing northwest onto the plaza.

Structure 3 is on the southeast side of Plaza 8, facing onto the plaza opposite Structure 2. It is immediately south of the ballcourt.

Structure 4 is an unusual combination of temple and palace. It is situated on the southeast side of Plaza 2. The structure consists of a central pyramidal base flanked by two attached range structures. The pyramidal base is topped by a shrine containing three rooms, the final room of the three is circular. The temple has three steep stairways flanked by balustrades. The main stairway ascends directly from the plaza, those on either side are perpendicular to the main stairway. The balustrade of each stairway terminates at the top in a vertical panel. The temple facade is in good condition although the roof of the temple is missing. The range structures are unequal in size and each contains a single long room atop a low platform. The facade of each of these rooms once possessed a row of columns although only stumps remain in situ. This temple-palace is Kʼicheʼ in style and has been identified with the Nija&#x27;ib&#x27; lineage of the Kʼicheʼ, being very similar to the Temple of Awilix at Qʼumarkaj. A tomb was excavated in Structure 4, it consisted of a complete skeleton with associated offerings that included two tripod earthenware bowls, one with duck effigies, a tripod incense burner, a flint knife, nine obsidian knives, five jade beads and some fragments of gold.
Structure 6 is a temple on the northeast side of Plaza 1. It rises in stepped sections topped by a summit shrine and was accessed via a stairway from the plaza that divided in two near the summit. Only the lower sections of the walls and columns of the shrine remain.

Structure 9 is a large mound on the northwest side of Plaza 1. The last phase of construction shows evidence of the interruption of construction by the Spanish Conquest. Terraces were absent on three sides of the structure with only the lowest level having been built on the fourth. Early Classic ceramic caches were discovered under Structure 9.

Structure 10 borders the northeast side of Plaza 4 and is unrestored although some original stonework is evident. It is a very long building accessed via three stairways ascending from the plaza. The structure has been investigated by archaeologists and was found to have multiple doorways opening into a single long room.

Structures 11 and 12 are small platforms in the middle of Plaza 1. They have both been restored.

Structure 13 is on the southwest side of Plaza 1, dividing that Plaza from Plaza 2. It was accessed via a double stairway ascending from Plaza 1. This double stairway gave access to the first level of the temple structure only; from there, a wide single stairway continued to the summit shrine. Only the lower sections of the walls and columns of the temple superstructure remain. The earliest phase of construction dates to the Early Classic and consisted of a low platform that supported a perishable superstructure.

Structures 15 and 16 are both low platforms located in Plaza 2, on an axis running directly northwest across the plaza from the central temple of Structure 4.
Structure 17 is a pyramidal base in Plaza 2, to the west of Structures 15 and 16. It supported two rooms accessed via a double stairway on the northwest side of the temple. The entrance to outermost room once had two columns, although now only the lower portions of the walls and columns remain.

Structure 21 is a low platform in Plaza 5, it is partially restored and has a stairway on the northwest side.

The Ballcourt consists of Structures 22 and 23, it was used for the ceremonial Mesoamerican ballgame. It is an I-shaped sunken ballcourt with sloping walls. The two structures forming the sides of the ballcourt once supported buildings, now only the lower sections of their walls remain. The ballcourt is oriented northwest to southeast and is long.

Structure 37 is not associated with any of the eight plazas of the site core, standing about northeast of Structure 4 and a similar distance east of Structure 1. It was investigated by archaeologists but has not been restored, although some of the original stonework and plaster coating is visible.

<doc id="339662" wikidata="Q356751" url="?curid=339662" title="Héctor José Cámpora">
<text>Héctor José Cámpora (26 March 190918 December 1980) was an Argentine politician. A major figure of left-wing Peronism, Cámpora was briefly Argentine president from 25 May to 13 July 1973 and subsequently arranged for Juan Perón to run for president in an election that he subsequently won. The modern left-wing Peronist political youth organization La Cámpora is named after him. He was a dentist by trade.

== Early life ==
Cámpora, affectionately known as &quot;el Tío&quot; (the Uncle), was born as Héctor José Cámpora Demaestre on March 26, 1909, in the city of Mercedes, in the Province of Buenos Aires. He earned a degree in dentistry in Córdoba University and practiced his profession in his hometown before moving to nearby San Andrés de Giles.

== From 1945 to 1970 ==
Cámpora knew General Juan Perón when the latter visited San Andrés de Giles as minister of labour in 1944. After Perón was elected president in 1946, Cámpora led an independent coalition of labourists and radicals and won a seat in the house of representatives, which he presided during the period 1948–1952. He was commissioned for a diplomatic trip through 17 countries as plenipotentiary ambassador in 1953. He was arrested and indicted for corruption and embezzlement by the &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; which overthrew Perón in 1955. After fleeing the country in 1956, he returned three years later when all the charges were dropped.

== From 1971 to July 1973 ==

Perón chose him as his &quot;personal delegate&quot; in 1971. He ran for president in 1973 to circumvent the veto on Perón&#x27;s participation in the election which had been issued by Argentine dictator General Alejandro Lanusse. His running-mate was Vicente Solano Lima. Despite Cámpora&#x27;s own left-leaning tendencies, Solano Lima belonged to the Popular Conservative Party.

Cámpora won the March 1973 election with 49.6% of the votes. The Radical leader, Ricardo Balbín, had arrived second with 21.3%, but it was enough to include him in the runoff with Cámpora, as absolute majority was necessary to avoid a second ballot. However, he resigned his right in order to avoid a political crisis, and recognized his defeat. Cámpora assumed his functions on 25 May 1973, in the presence of Chilean President Salvador Allende and Cuban President Osvaldo Dorticós. A million people gathered on the &quot;Plaza de Mayo&quot; to acclaim the new President.

One of Cámpora&#x27;s first presidential actions was a granting of amnesty to members of terrorist organizations who had carried out political assassinations and terror attacks against military and police personnel and who had been tried and sentenced to prison by judges. Once liberated, these terrorist began executing these judges for revenge.

On 28 May Argentina restored diplomatic relations with Cuba, which then received Argentine aid such as food and industrial products to break the United States embargo against Cuba.

During Cámpora&#x27;s first months of government, approximatively 600 social conflicts, strikes and factory occupations had taken place. The revolutionary left had however suspended armed struggle, joining itself to the participatory democracy process, which created alarms in the Peronist right-wing bureaucracy.

Cámpora&#x27;s ideology set him against the right-wing tendencies of Peronism. When Perón returned to Argentina on 20 June 1973, his plane had to be redirected to a military airport because at the gathering to greet his arrival at Buenos Aires&#x27; main airport, snipers affiliated with the right wing of Peronism attacked and killed a number of left-wing Peronist activists. This event, known as the Ezeiza Massacre, left 13 killed and more than 300 wounded.

José Ber Gelbard, president of the CGE, a small and medium-sized enterprise association, was designated as minister of economics. Gelbard tried to establish a &quot;social pact&quot; among the CGT workers and the &quot;National Bourgeoisie&quot;, including a price freeze and widespread salary hikes.

Finally, on 13 July 1973, Cámpora resigned to allow Juan Perón to return to power. New elections were held on 23 September, twelve days after the Chilean coup. Cámpora was later designated as Argentine ambassador to Mexico.

== July 1973 to 1980 ==

After the March 1976 coup d&#x27;état that displaced Perón&#x27;s successor, his widow Isabel Perón, Cámpora sought refuge at the Mexican embassy in Buenos Aires. Three years later, after being diagnosed with laryngeal cancer, he was allowed to fly to Mexico. Cámpora died in Cuernavaca a few months after his arrival, in December 1980.

<text>Alejandro Agustín Lanusse Gelly (28 August 1918 – 26 August 1996) was the &quot;de facto&quot; president of the Argentine Republic between 22 March 1971 and 25 May 1973, during the military dictatorship of the country called the &quot;Argentine Revolution&quot;.

On 26 March 1971, Lanusse assumed the presidency in a totally unfavorable political climate. Guerrilla violence grew, popular discontent also, the continuity of the military government became difficult to sustain. Lanusse evaluated that the solution to the multiple conflicts was to end the proscription of Peronism and to decree a political opening that allowed a transition towards democracy.

==Early life==
He was born as Alejandro Agustín Lanusse Gelly on 28 August 1918, in Buenos Aires to Luis Gustavo Lanusse Justo and Albertina Gelly Cantilo.

== Career ==
A graduate of the Army Academy (Colegio Militar de la Nación, class of 1938), he served in different Cavalry units before becoming commander of the &quot;Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo&quot; (Regiment of Horse Grenadiers, presidential escort unit). In 1951, he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in an attempted coup to overthrow Juan Perón. He was released in 1955 with the Revolución Libertadora, a military uprising which ousted General Perón and set up a military dictatorship which was in power from 1955 to 1958. In 1956, he was designated Ambassador to the Holy See. 

In 1960, he became assistant director of the Superior Military School and later Commander of the First Armored Cavalry Division. In 1962, he took part in the overthrowing of president Arturo Frondizi, and, in 1966, supported General Juan Carlos Onganía in the ousting of president Arturo Illia. In 1968, he became Commander-in-Chief of the Argentine Army.

==Presidency==

Lanusse became president of Argentina in 1971. During his administration he established diplomatic relations with China and continuously faced political unrest, with an increase in guerrilla activity. Many political opponents were jailed, and Lanusse decided to negotiate with the Montoneros (a Peronist guerrilla movement) for the return of the corpse of Evita (Eva Duarte de Perón), Juan Domingo Perón&#x27;s second wife whose body had been hidden by the &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot;. On 22 August 1971, several imprisoned guerrillas attempted to escape from the Naval Base of Rawson in Patagonia, and were executed without trial in the Trelew massacre. 

In March 1973, presidential elections were held, and won by Hector Cámpora.

==Later years==
In 1985, Lanusse published his autobiography and criticized the human rights violations that took place during the Dirty War, including the state murder of his cousin, diplomat Elena Holmberg. He was placed under house arrest in 1994 for criticizing president Carlos Menem in a magazine interview.

<text>Roberto Marcelo Levingston Laborda (10 January 1920 – 17 June 2015) was an Argentine Army general who was the 36th President of Argentina from 1970 to 1971.

==Early life and education==
Levingston was born in San Luis Province, and graduated from the Colegio Militar de la Nación in 1941.

On 18 December 1943, Levingston married Betty Nelly Andrés (born 4 May 1926) and had two sons and one daughter, Roberto, Maria and Alberto.

==Presidency==

Levingston&#x27;s military expertise included intelligence and counterinsurgency, and he took the presidency of Argentina on 18 June 1970, in a military coup that deposed Juan Carlos Onganía over his ineffective response to the Montoneros and other guerillas. His regime was marked by a protectionist economic policy that did little to overcome the inflation and recession that the country was undergoing at the time, and by the imposition of the death penalty against terrorists and kidnappers. In response to renewed anti-government rioting in Córdoba and to the labor crisis under his leadership, he was deposed on 21 March 1971, by another military junta led by Alejandro Lanusse.

==Death==
He died on 17 June 2015, at the age of 95. He is the longest-lived President of Argentina.

<doc id="339669" wikidata="Q365326" url="?curid=339669" title="Juan Carlos Onganía">
<text>Juan Carlos Onganía Carballo (; 17 March 1914 – 8 June 1995) was President of Argentina from 29 June 1966 to 8 June 1970. He rose to power as dictator after toppling the president Arturo Illia in a coup d&#x27;état self-named &quot;Argentine Revolution&quot;.

Onganía wanted to install in Argentina a paternalistic dictatorship modeled on Francoist Spain. While preceding military coups in Argentina were aimed at establishing temporary, transitional &quot;juntas&quot;, the &quot;Revolución Argentina&quot; headed by Onganía aimed at establishing a new political and social order, opposed both to liberal democracy and to communism, which gave to the Armed Forces of Argentina a leading role in the political and economic operation of the country. Onganía implemented a rigid censorship that reached the press and all cultural manifestations such as cinema, theater and even poetry.

When the Armed Forces replaced the radical president in government with General Juan Carlos Onganía, they interrupted an attempt to set up the republic and led the country to the violence of the 1970s and subsequent decline.

==Family==
Juan Carlos Onganía Carballo was born on 17 March 1914 in Marcos Paz, in the province of Buenos Aires to Carlos Luis Onganía and Sara Rosa Carballo Sosa. Onganía is of Italian ancestry (Lecco and Como). His mother was of distant Portuguese ancestry.

==Presidency==
===Economic and social policies===
While preceding military coups in Argentina were aimed at establishing temporary, transitional &quot;juntas&quot;, the &quot;Revolución Argentina&quot; headed by Onganía aimed at establishing a new political and social order, opposed both to liberal democracy and to communism, which gave to the Armed Forces of Argentina a leading role in the political and economic operation of the country. The political scientist Guillermo O&#x27;Donnell named this type of regime &quot;authoritarian-bureaucratic state&quot;, in reference both to the &quot;Revolución Argentina&quot;, the Brazilian military regime (1964–1985), Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s regime (starting in 1973) and Juan María Bordaberry&#x27;s regime in Uruguay.

While Chief of the Army in 1963, Onganía helped crush the 1963 Argentine Navy Revolt by mobilizing troops that seized rebelling Navy bases. However, he demonstrated a disregard for civil authority when he initially refused to call off his troops after a ceasefire agreement had been approved by President José María Guido and his cabinet, and was only convinced to follow orders after a tense meeting.

As military dictator, Onganía suspended political parties and supported a policy of &quot;Participacionismo&quot; (Participationism, supported by the trade unionist José Alonso and then by the general secretary of the CGT-Azopardo, Augusto Vandor), by which representatives of various interest groups such as industry, labor, and agriculture, would form committees to advise the government. However these committees were largely appointed by the dictator himself. Onganía also suspended the right to strike (Law 16,936) and supported a corporatist economic and social policy, enforced particularly in Cordoba by the appointed governor, Carlos Caballero.

Onganía&#x27;s Minister of Economy, , decreed a wage freeze (amid 30% inflation) and a 40% devaluation, which adversely impacted the state of the Argentine economy (agriculture in particular), favoring foreign capital. Krieger Vasena suspended collective labour conventions, reformed the Fossil Fuels Law which had established a partial monopoly of the &quot;Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales&quot; (YPF) state enterprise and also signed a law facilitating the expulsion of tenants in cases of non-payment of rent.

===Cultural and education policy===
Onganía&#x27;s rule signified an end to university autonomy, which had been achieved by the University Reform of 1918.

Barely a month into his administration, he was responsible for the violation of university autonomy in the so-called &quot;La Noche de los Bastones Largos&quot; (&quot;The Night of the Long Police Batons&quot;) in which he ordered police to invade the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Buenos Aires. Students and professors were beaten up and arrested. Many were later forced to leave the country, beginning a &quot;brain drain&quot; that adversely affects Argentine academia to this day.

Onganía also ordered repression on all forms of &quot;immoralism&quot;, proscribing miniskirts, long hair for boys, and all avant-garde artistic movements. This moral campaign favorized the radicalization of the middle classes, who were very over-represented in universities. In 1969, Ongania dedicated the country to the Immaculate Heart of Mary.

===Protests===
Eventually, this position was opposed by the other factions in the military, which felt that its influence in government would be diminished. At the end of May 1968, General Julio Alsogaray dissented from Onganía, and rumors spread about a possible coup d&#x27;état, Alsogaray leading the conservative opposition to Onganía. Finally, at the end of the month, Onganía dismissed the leaders of the Armed Forces: Alejandro Lanusse replaced Julio Alsogaray, Pedro Gnavi replaced Benigno Varela, and Jorge Martínez Zuviría replaced Adolfo Alvarez. Ongania&#x27;s government was weakened by a popular uprising of workers and students that took place in the whole of the country, in particular in the interior, in cities such as Córdoba in 1969 (known as &quot;El Cordobazo&quot;) or Rosario (the &quot;Rosariazo&quot;).

The dominant military faction, led by General Lanusse, demanded that Onganía resign. When he refused, he was toppled by a military junta.

==Later life==
After his departure from office the general decided to retire definitively to a Buenos Aires estate. He was critical of the human rights violations during the National Reorganization Process, the name given to the military dictatorship of Videla et al between 1976 and 1983.

In 1989 the Constitutional Nationalist Party proposed him to be a candidate, but he did not reach an agreement and remained away from politics. For the 1995 elections he was a candidate for president for the Front for Patriotic Solidarity after criticizing President Carlos Menem for the widespread corruption in his government. Before the election Onganía resigned from the ticket due to health issues, although his name continued to appear on the ballot.

He died of a stroke at the age of 81 on June 8, 1995.

<doc id="339670" wikidata="Q270368" url="?curid=339670" title="Arturo Umberto Illia">
<text>Arturo Umberto Illia (; 4 August 1900 – 18 January 1983) was President of Argentina from 1963 until his overthrow in 1966. He was part of the Radical Civic Union, and the People&#x27;s Radical Civic Union during his presidency.

Illia reached the presidency of the Nation in elections controlled by the Armed Forces in which Peronism was outlawed and while the previous constitutional president Arturo Frondizi was detained. During his government, the national industry was promoted, 23% of the national budget was allocated to education (the highest figure in the history of the country), unemployment fell, the external debt decreased, a literacy plan was carried out and sanctioned the Minimum, Vital and Mobile Salary law and the Medications Laws.

He was noted for his honesty and trustworthiness, an example of this being the fact that Illia lived almost all his life in his humble home in Cruz del Eje, where he devoted himself to medicine, and that he never used his influence to his advantage, to the point such as having to sell his car while in office and refusing to use public funds to finance his medical treatments. After his government, he maintained his active political militancy, rejected the retirement perks he had earned as president, and returned home to continue dedicating himself to medicine.

==Biography==

Arturo Umberto Illia was born in Pergamino, Buenos Aires to Italian immigrants. Martino Illia (1861–1948) was born in Samolaco, province of Sondrio, Lombardy, while his mother Emma Francesconi (1874–1940) was born in Gratacazolo, province of Brescia.

He enrolled in the School of Medicine at the University of Buenos Aires in 1918. That year, he joined the movement for University reform in Argentina (&quot;Reforma Universitaria&quot;), which first emerged in the city of Córdoba, and set the basis for a free, open and public university system less influenced by the Catholic Church. This development changing the concept and administration of higher education in Argentina, and in a good portion of Latin America.

As a part of his medical studies, Illia begun working in the San Juan de Dios Hospital in the city of La Plata, obtaining his degree in 1927.

In 1928 he had an interview with President Hipólito Yrigoyen, the longtime leader of the centrist UCR, and the first freely-elected President of Argentina. Illia offered him his services as a physician, and Yrigoyen, in turn, offered him a post as railroad physician in different parts of the country, upon which Illia decided to move to scenic Cruz del Eje, in Cordoba Province. He worked there as a physician from 1929 until 1963, except for three years (1940–1943) in which he was vice-governor of the province.

=== Family ===
On 15 February 1939, he married Silvia Elvira Martorell, and had three children: Emma Silvia, Martín Arturo and Leandro Hipólito. Martín Illia was elected to Congress in 1995, and served until his death in 1999.

Gabriela Michetti, elected vice president in 2015, is a great-grandniece of Illia.

==Political activities==
Arturo Illia became a member of the Radical Civic Union when he reached adulthood, in 1918, under the strong influence of the radical militancy of his father and of his brother, Italo.
That same year, he began his university studies, with the events of the aforementioned Universitarian Reform taking place in the country.

From 1929 onwards, after moving to Cruz del Eje, he began intense political activity, which he alternated with his professional life. In 1935 he was elected Provincial Senator for the Department of Cruz del Eje, in the elections that took place on 17 November. In the Provincial Senate, he actively participated in the approval of the Law of Agrarian Reform, which was passed in the Córdoba Legislature but rejected in the National Congress.

He was also head of the Budget and Treasury Commission, and pressed for the construction of dams, namely Nuevo San Roque, La Viña, Cruz del Eje and Los Alazanes.

In the elections that took place on 10 March 1940, he was elected Vice-Governor of Córdoba Province, with Santiago del Castillo, who became governor. He occupied this post until the provincial government was replaced by the newly installed dictatorship of General Pedro Ramírez, in 1943.

From 1948 to 1952, Illia served in the Argentine Chamber of Deputies and frequently spoke out against the Peronist regime. Working in a Congress dominated by the Peronist Party, he took an active part in the Public Works, Hygiene and Medical Assistance Commissions.

==Election as President of Argentina==

The election held on 7 July 1963 marked a return to constitutional government in Argentina after a period of political instability and internal strife following the military overthrow of President Arturo Frondizi on 29 March 1962.

===Provisional administration===
Illia&#x27;s predecessor, José María Guido, was installed as head of a nominally civilian administration when Frondizi was deposed. A &quot;virtual captive&quot; of the armed forces during his nineteen months in office, Guido dissolved Congress and annulled the results of the March 1962 mid-term election that had seen Peronists sweep 45 of the 95 Chamber of Deputies seats and 10 of the 14 governorships at stake. However, Guido succeeded in his top priority of convincing military leaders to allow the 1963 elections.

===Military===
The 1963 elections were made possible due to support from the moderate &quot;Blue&quot; faction (&quot;Azules&quot; in Spanish) of the Argentine military led by the head of the Joint Chiefs, General Juan Carlos Onganía and by the Internal Affairs Minister, General Osiris Villegas. The &quot;Azules&quot; defeated an attempted revolt in late 1962 and early 1963 by the rival &quot;Red&quot; faction (&quot;Colorados&quot; in Spanish), which consisted of hard-liners who favored a military dictatorship.

===Ban on Peronism===
Like in most elections after 1955, Peronists were banned from running in the 1963 election.

===Divisions within the Radical Party===
The UCR had been divided since their contentious 1956 convention into the mainstream &quot;People&#x27;s UCR&quot; (UCRP) and the center-left UCRI. The leader of the UCRP, Ricardo Balbín, withdrew his name from the March 10 nominating convention and instead supported a less conservative, less anti-Peronist choice, and the party nominated Dr. Illia for president and Entre Ríos Province lawyer Carlos Perette as his running-mate.

===Election results===
In the electoral college on 31 July 1963, the Illia-Perette ticket obtained 169 votes out of 476 on the first round of voting (70 short of an absolute majority), but the support of three centrist parties on the second round gave them 270 votes, thus formalizing their election.

Illia assumed the presidency on 12 October 1963.

==Presidency==
=== 1963 general election ===
Arturo Illia became president on 12 October 1963, and promptly steered a moderate political course, while remaining mindful of the spectre of a coup d&#x27;état. A UCRP majority in the Senate contrasted with their 73 seats in the 192-seat Lower House, a disadvantage complicated by Illia&#x27;s refusal to include UCRI men in the cabinet (which, save for Internal Affairs Minister Juan Palmero, would all be figures close to Balbín). Illia also refused military requests to have a general put in charge of the Federal District Police, though he confirmed Onganía as head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and named numerous &quot;Blue&quot; generals to key posts.

Illia started his presidency with an attempt to promote reconciliation and stability. His inaugural address included both praise for the armed forces and a call to reduce poverty and income inequality, citing encyclicals issued by then-Pope John XIII, &quot;Mater et Magistra&quot; and &quot;Pacem in Terris&quot;. Countering military objections, however, he made political rights an early policy centerpiece with an emphasis on constitutionality. His first act consisted in eliminating all restrictions over Peronism and its allied political parties, causing anger and surprise among the military (particularly the right-wing &quot;Red&quot; faction). Political demonstrations from the Peronist party were forbidden after the 1955 coup, by the Presidential Decree 4161/56, however, five days after Illia&#x27;s inaugural, a Peronist commemorative act for the 17 October (in honor of the date in 1945 when labor demonstrations propelled Perón to power) took place in Buenos Aires&#x27; Plaza Miserere without any official restrictions.

Illia similarly lifted electoral restrictions, allowing the participation of Peronists in the 1965 legislative elections. The prohibition over the Communist Party of Argentina and the pro-industry MID (which many in the military, then controlled by cattle barons, termed &quot;economic criminals&quot;) was also lifted. Among Illia&#x27;s early landmark legislation was an April 1964 bill issuing felony penalties for discrimination and racial violence, which he presented in an address to a joint session of Congress.

Domestically, Illia pursued a pragmatic course, restoring Frondizi&#x27;s vigorous public works and lending policies, but with more emphasis on the social aspect and with a marked, nationalist shift away from Frondizi&#x27;s support for foreign investment. This shift was most dramatic in Illia&#x27;s controversial petroleum policy.

Yet Illia struggled to reconcile the adversarial social forces that prevailed in Argentina during his term. The UCRP was unable to broaden its electoral base beyond its core middle-class constituency, which left the most powerful interest groups – Peronists, the military, and business leaders – excluded from formal sources of political authority. Illia refused to give the military a direct role in government, which he viewed as a violation of constitutional legality. Meanwhile, Illia&#x27;s reluctance to engage in the clientelism that characterized Argentine politics left him isolated even within his own party. The newspaper &quot;La Nación&quot; would later write of his presidency, &quot;It is not easy to find a president more denigrated and attacked during the exercise of power than Arturo Umberto Illia. Until the end, he remained calm and prudent in governing an intense country.&quot;

===Economic record===
Under the preceding Guido administration, Argentina had endured a sharp two-year recession under an orthodox stabilization program. Once in office, Illia implemented a pro-growth policy characterized by expansionary fiscal and monetary policy and deepening of import substituting industrialization. The result was a strong recovery with annual real GDP growth of nearly 10% in both 1964 and 1965, record agricultural exports, and double-digit growth in manufacturing output. However, Illia&#x27;s opponents credited the boom to record harvests and therefore a &quot;turn of good luck, thanks to the gods or to the pampas.&quot; Illia&#x27;s administration moreover made limited progress in resolving labor unrest, persistent inflation, and foreign exchange shortages – all of which remain challenges for Argentina today. By the time Illia was removed from office in mid-1966, economic stagnation had returned.

==== Economic policy ====
Opponents characterized Illia&#x27;s administration as a &quot;do-nothing regime.&quot; 

With a full term in office, Illia might have made more progress in improving Argentina&#x27;s economic fundamentals. His administration&#x27;s five-year National Development Plan was released in 1965 and was received favorably by economists and foreign officials. However, Illia&#x27;s emphasis on compromise and gradualism frustrated business and military leaders who perceived an urgent need for more drastic restructuring and modernization of the economy.

==== Industrial expansion ====
Industrial production grew by 18.7% in 1964 and 13.8% in 1965, led by capital intensive sectors such as steel, plastics, and chemicals. Motor vehicle production, which increased from 105,000 units in 1963 to 195,000 in 1965, became a highly visible symbol of Argentina&#x27;s industrialization.

==== Agriculture ====
Agriculture returned to growth after two decades of stagnation. Cereals production and cattle stock increased by 60% and 25% respectively between 1963 and 1965, the result of substantial investment after 1955 by the private sector in tractors, irrigation systems, and storage facilities, and by the government in public research and extension services. With favorable prices on world markets in the mid-1960s, Argentina&#x27;s exports reached new records, rising from an average of USD $950 million between 1954 and 1961 to USD $1.6 billion by 1966.

===Fiscal policy===
Illia maintained the expansionary fiscal policy that dated back to the Perón administration. The budget deficit increased by 60% in 1964 to 5.8% of GDP due to his freezing of public utility rates, which reduced government revenue in real terms. Limited progress was made to balance the budget in 1965 with a fiscal deficit of 3.8% of GDP; a steep increase in tax revenue due to the economic recovery and elimination of many tax deductions was more than offset by increased social security benefits and a 50% wage increase for public sector employees.

Losses at state-owned companies remained a burden on public finances despite Illia&#x27;s creation of the Syndicate of State Businesses to encourage efficiency in state-owned companies. The annual subsidy to cover losses at the national railway company accounted for almost 20% of central government expenditures in 1965. Government procurement costs increased due to legislation passed by Illia&#x27;s administration that gave preferential status to domestic vendors in public contracts; by the late 1980s, Argentina&#x27;s Ministry of Public Works found that this system resulted in an additional USD $2 billion in spending per year.

Deteriorating provincial finances similarly consumed a growing proportion of central government resources. Transfers to provincial governments represented 22% of central government revenue in 1964 vs. less than 15% in the mid-1950s.

With the government avoiding additional foreign debt, the fiscal deficit was financed primarily by printing money. The money supply grew by 61% during Illia&#x27;s first 18 months in office alone, contributing to an inflation rate that averaged 25% per year during his presidency.

===Foreign trade and balance of payments===
Due to record agricultural exports, Argentina enjoyed a substantial current account surplus during Illia&#x27;s presidency. The country penetrated new markets such as Italy, Japan, and the Eastern Bloc, and started exporting industrial products, including a small but symbolically important number of motor vehicles to Paraguay, Ecuador, and Guatemala. Illia promoted regional integration with Latin American Free Trade Association (LAFTA) members, issuing Decree 1188 in February 1965 to allow increased imports of auto parts in exchange for compensatory exports to the same countries.

However, Argentina&#x27;s balance of payments were burdened by the country&#x27;s external debt. Although Illia reduced external debt from USD $3.4 billion to USD $2.7 billion, annual servicing costs remained high and were equivalent to 40% of annual exports. Scheduled repayments caused Argentina&#x27;s foreign reserves to fall from USD $280 million in 1963 to only USD $70 million in 1965, requiring negotiations with the Paris Club group of creditors to refinance and defer payments. Resolution of Argentina&#x27;s balance of payments issues were complicated by Illia&#x27;s strained relationship with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. During his election campaign, Illia had denounced the IMF in particular as an economic intruder and refused a meeting with IMF officials upon assuming office.

Relations with the Inter-American Development Bank were more constructive. The Inter-American Development Bank granted Illia&#x27;s government a USD $92.6 million credit for development and educational projects shortly after his inauguration in October 1963, and in early 1965 the Bank approved USD $30 million in funding for Argentine industry.

The expansion of heavy industry during Illia&#x27;s time in office, while impressive at face value, created new burdens on Argentina&#x27;s balance of payments. Import substitution in many cases simply replaced imports of finished goods with imports of capital and intermediate goods. Foreign direct investment brought an influx of external capital (although frequently in the form of second-hand equipment rather than cash investment), technology, and know-how, but subsequently led to capital outflows (profit repatriation, transfer pricing, and royalty payments) from Argentine subsidiaries to U.S. and European parent companies. As result, the Central Bank of Argentina in 1965 estimated that the motor vehicle industry imposed a foreign exchange burden of USD $200 million per year.

Illia&#x27;s administration therefore maintained Argentina&#x27;s current account surplus through strict controls on imports, which had a negative impact on capital investment. By 1965, imports of capital goods had fallen to only a quarter of the level seen during the 1960-1961 investment boom under Frondizi. Given the constant pressures on the country&#x27;s balance of payments, Illia&#x27;s administration tightly controlled access to foreign currency, required exporters to convert their earnings into pesos, and introduced measures to prevent capital flight. Yet Illia&#x27;s exchange rate policy was significantly more flexible than in prior administrations with a &quot;crawling peg&quot; exchange rate that devalued the peso in line with inflation, preventing the overvalued currency that had resulted in prior administrations that used a fixed exchange rate regime. 

===Petroleum policy===
Illia&#x27;s economic record was strongly impacted by his petroleum policy. During his presidential campaign, Arturo Illia promised to dissolve both the Investment Guarantee Agreement, as well as the oil contracts that were made during the Arturo Frondizi government without complying with legal regulations. Once in power, Illia announced that contracts that had been made illegally would be annulled, on 15 November 1963, Illia issued the decrees 744/63 and 745/63, which rendered said oil contracts null and void, for being considered &quot;illegitimate and harmful to the rights and interests of the Nation.&quot; 

Frondizi had begun, during his 1958–62 presidency, a policy of oil exploration based on concessions of oil wells to foreign private corporations, leaving the state oil company Yacimientos Petrolíferos Fiscales (YPF) the sole responsibility of exploration and buying oil from private extractors. Arguing that such contracts were negative for the Argentine state and its people (YPF had to assume all the risks of investing in exploration of new wells, the price of oil had risen steadily since the contracts were negotiated, etc.), Illia denounced the Frondizi policy as negative for national Argentine interests, and promised to render the contracts of concession void, renegotiating them.

Although popular with the Argentine public, Illia&#x27;s petroleum policy created headwinds for the economy and balance of payments. Under Frondizi, oil production had tripled between 1958 and 1962, resulting in self-sufficiency in oil by the end of his administration. However, production stagnated under Illia and oil imports resumed. The annulment of oil contracts created tensions with the United States, which placed a hold on Argentina&#x27;s requests for multilateral assistance, including financing for aircraft imports, housing, and agricultural equipment. As a result, American aid to Argentina decreased from USD $135 million in 1963 to only USD $21 million in 1964, depriving the country of a critical source of foreign currency.

===Labor policy===
On 15 June 1964, the Law 16.459 was passed, establishing a minimum wage for the country.
&quot;&quot;Avoiding the exploitation of workers in those sectors in which an excess of workforce may exist&quot;, &quot;Securing an adequate minimum wage&quot; and &quot;Improving the income of the poorest workers&quot;&quot; were listed among the objectives of the project. With the same aims, the Law of Supplies was passed, destined to control prices of basic foodstuffs and setting minimum standards for pensions.

Since Perón&#x27;s exile, the labor movement functioned as the representation of Peronism in the country. Led by the leader of the powerful metalworkers&#x27; union UOM, Augusto Vandor, the unions deployed a large-scale &quot;Plan de Lucha&quot; (Plan of Struggle). Between May and July of 1964, 3.9 million workers occupied more than 11,000 industrial establishments. Given his sympathy for the working class, Illia refrained from using force to expel the occupiers, leading to charges from the business establishment of leniency toward the labor movement.

Workers benefitted from a rising standard of living during Illia&#x27;s administration. Median real wages grew by 9.6% during 1964 alone, and had expanded by almost 25% by the time of the coup. Unemployment declined from 8.8% in 1963 to 4.6% by the end of 1965.

===Social welfare policy===
Illia modestly expanded Argentina&#x27;s welfare state. The most significant program was the increase in value and coverage of family allowances. The government also opened approximately 250 maternal and infant health care centers and started planning for the Villa Lugano public housing development to replace what was then one of the largest villa miseria slums in Buenos Aires.

===Education policy===
During Illia&#x27;s government, education acquired an important presence in the national budget. In 1963, it represented 12% of the budget, rising to 17% in 1964 and to 23% in 1965. On November 5, 1964, the National Literacy Plan was started, with the purpose of diminishing and eliminating illiteracy (At the time, nearly 10% of the adult population was still illiterate). By June 1965, the program comprised 12,500 educational centers and was assisting more than 350,000 adults of all ages.

===Medical drugs law===

Law 16.462, also known as &#x27;Oñativia Law&#x27; (in honor of Minister of Health Arturo Oñativia), was passed on August 28, 1964. It established a policy of price and quality controls for pharmaceuticals, freezing prices for patented medicines at the end of 1963, establishing limits to advertising expenditures and to money sent outside the country for royalties and related payments. The regulation of this law by Decree 3042/65 also required pharmaceutical corporations to present to a judge an analysis of the costs of their drugs and to formalize all their existing contracts.

=== Foreign policy ===

Argentine foreign policy under Illia was nationalistic and marked by solidarity with nonaligned countries. Relations with the U.S. were frosty due to Illia&#x27;s petroleum policy and refusal to send troops to support U.S. President Lyndon Johnson&#x27;s military intervention in the Dominican Republic in 1965. However, Illia sided with the U.S. in supporting sanctions against Cuba over the objections of Mexico, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Chile at the American Foreign Ministers meeting in Washington, D.C. in July 1964. Illia also sought and received U.S. military aid to quell Cuban-backed guerilla forces in the province of Salta.

Relations with Chile deteriorated under Illia after a tentative rapprochement under Frondizi, who had entered an agreement with then Chilean President Jorge Alessandri in 1959 to increase economic and political integration between the two countries and to use arbitration rather than military conflict to resolve recurring border issues. Illia at first alternated between border incidents and declarations of peaceful intent until he annulled the Frondizi-Alessandri agreements in 1965.

Illia&#x27;s approach to foreign policy combined the old Yrigoyen tradition of Krausist idealism with universalism. The first component was evidenced in the constant references of Illia and his foreign minister Miguel Angel Zavala Ortiz to a peaceful universal order, based on justice and not on the realistic criterion of the balance of power, and Americanism. In turn, the developmental component appeared in their references to the importance of the Alliance for Progress, the need to achieve integration and development at the national and continental level, and the inequality of economic opportunities between developed countries and developing countries as the main cause of global conflict.

Illia pronounced on 12 October 1963 -day of his assumption- before the Legislative Assembly: &quot;Peace no longer consists only in the balance of power of the great powers but also in giving the undeveloped nations the opportunities and the means to eliminate the tremendous humiliation of their inequality and the misery in which their inhabitants live. To universalize peace, progress and well-being must be universalized. America cannot be solely a geographical nomenclature, but must be an active oriented and guiding unit, complementary to a universal order.&quot;

During his government Illia revived the state visit of Charles de Gaulle, Giuseppe Saragat, Eduardo Frei Montalva, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Princess Margrethe, among others.

=== Public image and the media ===
In this climate of democratic fragility, the press mounted an active campaign that contributed to the military coup. They accused the president of being slow and ineffective, they represented him as a turtle or with a dove on his head; at the same time they argued that modernization required overcoming Argentina&#x27;s fractious Congress and portrayed Juan Carlos Onganía as a messianic leader who would bring order.

A campaign against Illia was systematically carried out by Peronist journalists and press groups that supported former populist president Peron, who had been deposed and was currently in exile, and sought to bring him back to power. The defamatory push was spearhead by as Mariano Grondona in Primera Plana, a right-wing Peronist publication. Illia was often portrayed as a turtle and characterized as timid and lacking energy. Protestors reportedly released 200 tortoises in downtown Buenos Aires with the slogan &quot;Long Live the Government&quot; on their backs, to which Illia is said to have responded: &quot;Turtle? Fine. Slow but sure.&quot;

Simultaneously, the personality of military chiefs was highlighted, particularly Juan Carlos Onganía, contrasting him with the image of politicians, encouraging their intervention to &quot;safeguard the Homeland.&quot;

A coup was not only supported by the more conservative sectors, that where aligned with the military, but also by the Peronist movement led by the Justicialist Party along several aligned trade union.

=== March 1965 Congressional elections ===
With 99 of the 192 seats in Argentina&#x27;s Chamber of Deputies up for re-election in March 1965, Illia permitted Peronists under the Unión Popular party to participate in federal elections for the first time since 1954. Illia also tolerated a Peronist political rally two nights before the election. The Union Popular won 31% of the vote with various neo-Peronist candidates winning an additional 7%. The strong Peronist electoral performance emboldened Illia&#x27;s critics who were concerned that he would allow the Peronist party, or even Peron himself, to participate in the 1969 Presidential election.

Yet the political landscape was not entirely favorable towards the Peronists due to the divide between the Unión Popular and neo-Peronists. In the gubernatorial election for the province of Mendoza in April 1966, a conservative candidate won the governorship since Peronists and neo-Peronists presented competing lists, losing the election despite collectively winning a majority of the vote. 

In some ways the 1965 Congressional election can be viewed as a political victory for Illia. Although Illia&#x27;s UCRP lost three seats, its vote share increased to 30% from 25% in the 1963 Presidential election, winning converts primarily from the UDELPA, Progressive Democrat, and Democratic Socialist parties. Most of all, Illia succeeded in conducting a free and fair election with Peronist participation and survival of his constitutional government in spite of strong opposition by the military. 

=== June 1966 coup ===
Rumors of an impending military coup increased in early 1966 as Illia&#x27;s control over his government grew tenuous. The upcoming coup was openly discussed – including logistical plans and even potential dates – in Argentine media, which tended to exaggerate the prospect of social disorder and gave a platform for military leaders to express contempt for Illia. Illia was increasingly unable to secure legislative support; for example, Congress refused to approve his 1966 budget at the time of the coup for a fiscal year that started in January. Meanwhile, a return to economic stagnation in 1966 (real GDP growth would be only 0.6% for the full year) after the 1964-1965 boom led to popular discontent with Illia&#x27;s government.

On 28 June 1966, on a cold winter morning, the military coup took place amid the indifference of the citizens. The military forced Arturo Illia to abandon the presidency and took power again.

General Julio Rodolfo Alsogaray, Brigadier Rodolfo Pío Otero —head of the Casa Rosada Military House—, Colonel Luis Perlinger and a group of officers appeared at the presidential office to request that he leave the Government House, assuring him at all times their physical integrity. He flatly refused and after a heated discussion he told them: &quot;I am the commander in chief of the Armed Forces,&quot; causing the military to leave the office. Faced with the strong refusal, the police officers entered with gas launchers, while the troops completely surrounded the Casa Rosada. Perlinger again asked the president to leave, assuring him that otherwise &quot;he could not guarantee the safety of the people who accompanied him.&quot; Finally, Illia chose to leave the place.

Surrounded by his collaborators, he went down the stairs to the ground floor, crossed the entrance and went to the street, he was able to reach the exit door of the Government House surrounded by a lot of people who kept shouting ... They offered him a car of the presidency, but rejected it. At that he saw the one who had been his Minister of Education, Alconada Aramburú, approaching among the people and telling him to go with him. She followed him and they got into his car. Inside were seven people. Thus we got to his brother&#x27;s house in the Buenos Aires town of Martínez. The following day, General Juan Carlos Onganía took office, calling the coup the Argentine Revolution.
=== Cabinet ===
Throughout his presidency he held the same cabinet members, except for Eugenio Blanco, who died in office, and had to be replaced by Juan Carlos Pugliese in August 1964.

== Subsequent activity and death ==

Illia lost his wife, Silvia Martorell, to cancer in September 1966, the same year he was deposed. For a short while he lived at his brother&#x27;s home in the Buenos Aires suburb of Martínez, though he would make frequent trips to Córdoba. Judging the mild-mannered Illia not to be a threat, the Ongania administration allowed Illia to retire from politics without being held in detention like Frondizi or exiled like Perón. Illia returned to Cruz del Eje, Córdoba where he resumed his medical practice as a rural doctor often attending patients for free.

Illia would occasionally speak out during this period. For instance, after leftist guerrillas attacked the city of Córdoba, Illia called for the resignation of President Isabel Perón as the only solution to the country&#x27;s social and political turmoil at the time.
He died in Cruz del Eje on 18 January 1983, at the age of 82, shortly before the return of democracy. Following a state memorial in Congress, Arturo Umberto Illia was buried in La Recoleta Cemetery, in Buenos Aires.

=== Homages ===

The Arturo Umberto Illia House Museum located at 181 Avellaneda street in the downtown neighborhood of Cruz del Eje, in the Province of Córdoba, Argentina, was declared a National Historic Monument on 27 November 2001, by Law 25,533.

The House-Museum constitutes a unique and relevant heritage, which was established in the center of the town of Cruz del Eje and is the faithful reflection of its owner, Arturo Illia. The house itself is typical middle class, built and Art Deco style, with the balcony above the garage, three bedrooms, dining room, bathroom, kitchen and living room.

<text>José María Guido Cibeira (29 August 1910 – 13 June 1975) was President of Argentina from 29 March 1962 to 12 October 1963, serving as the head of a provisional civilian government after the Argentine military overthrew President Arturo Frondizi. Guido&#x27;s nineteen months in office were characterized by a severe economic recession, open conflict between competing factions within the armed forces, and anti-democratic measures including continued proscription of Peronists from Argentine politics. Yet Guido, with critical support from the &quot;legalist&quot; faction of the military, prevailed in his mission to return Argentina to constitutional government with a general election held on 7 July 1963.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
José María Guido was born in Buenos Aires on 29 August 1910. His father José María Emilio Guido Repetto was born in La Plata with Italian ancestry, while his mother, Carmen Cibeira Mosquera, was born in Piñor, Galicia in northern Spain.

He grew up in the capital&#x27;s San Telmo &quot;barrio&quot; and graduated from the University of La Plata law school in 1940.

=== Early career ===
Prior to his involvement in politics, Guido worked as a lawyer and was a member of the centrist Radical Civic Union (&quot;Unión Cívica Radical&quot; or UCR), the traditional party of Argentina&#x27;s middle class. In 1946, he moved to Viedma, the provincial capital of Río Negro in the Patagonia region to join the law firm of Edgardo Costello. 

Guido&#x27;s career in public service started with his involvement in drafting Law 200 in 1951, which created the (IDEVI), a provincial agency tasked with developing the province&#x27;s hydroelectric resources. Appointed as an advisor to IDEVI, Guido traveled to the U.S. to meet with officials from the Tennessee Valley Authority, a public utility.

Within a decade, Guido had become a national political figure. When the UCR split in 1956, he joined the dissident branch that became the Intransigent Radical Civic Union party (&quot;Unión Cívica Radical Intransigente&quot; or UCRI) and was appointed to its Executive Committee secretariat. In 1958, he was elected to the Argentine Senate representing Río Negro; his former employer Costello won the governorship of Río Negro in the same election. During his time in the Senate, Guido was known to be a skilled negotiator and partnered with Rio Negro Senate colleague José Enrico Gadano of the opposition Popular Radical Civic Union (&quot;Unión Cívica Radical del Pueblo&quot; or UCRP) party to promote hydroelectric development in the region.

Fatefully for Guido, he was also elected by his peers to serve as Senate President, making him next in line for the Presidency upon the resignation of Vice President Alejandro Gómez in November 1958. Guido served as Acting President in January 1959 when then-President Arturo Frondizi made a state visit to the United States. His two weeks in that capacity was notable for his decision to crack down on a general strike protesting Frondizi&#x27;s privatization program. Foreshadowing his later co-optation by military authorities, Guido responded to the strike with repressive measures that included placing employees of Buenos Aires&#x27; public transport system and state oil company YPF under military control, posting military reinforcements throughout the capital, and arresting labor leaders. Public order was restored but Guido’s relationship with the labor movement deteriorated.

==Presidency==
Guido ascended to the Presidency after the military deposed constitutionally elected Frondizi in the early morning hours of 29 March 1962. For over 12 hours after the coup, the Argentine Presidency remained vacant as civilian leaders and their military allies worked to forestall the installation of a dictatorship under Army Commander-in-Chief . Since the Vice Presidency had remained vacant after Gómez&#x27;s resignation, Guido was next in line under Article 75 of the Argentine Constitution and the 1868 Law of Succession (&quot;ley de acefalía&quot; or literally &quot;Law of headlessness&quot;). 

As a Frondizi loyalist, Guido was hesitant to assume the Presidency and agreed to do so primarily at the urging of UCRI party leaders, particularly Frondizi&#x27;s Defense Minister Rodolfo Martínez, who conveyed the ex-President&#x27;s desire for Guido to take office. The UCRP also pledged its support. On the evening of 29 March 1962, Guido was sworn in by the Supreme Court of Argentina and reportedly took his oath on a copy of the Constitution to symbolize the preservation of constitutional procedure and asking that he not be considered a &quot;traitor to his party or to the people.&quot; The following day, Guido&#x27;s swearing-in was reaffirmed in a public ceremony attended by Supreme Court justices and Congressional and military leaders.

Although nominally President, Guido was a &quot;virtual captive&quot; required to &quot;co-govern&quot; with the armed forces, which exercised the &quot;negative power of veto&quot; over civilian authorities. A further complication was the split within the military between the &quot;Azules&quot; (&quot;Blues&quot;), also known as &quot;legalistas&quot; due to their support for a &quot;legalist&quot; transfer of power in accordance with the Constitution, and the &quot;Colorados&quot; (&quot;Reds&quot;) who were eager to install a military dictator. The intense rivalry between the two factions culminated in violent confrontations in late 1962 and early 1963 that brought Argentina to the brink of civil war. The &quot;Azules&quot; emerged victorious in the ensuing battles, enabling Guido to remain in office and paving the way for the return to constitutional government through the July 1963 election that brought Arturo Umberto Illía of the UCRP to power.

=== Economic record and policy ===
In the final years of the Frondizi administration, the Argentine economy had recovered from the economic crisis of 1959 but continued to face high inflation (by historical standards) due to an excessive rate of credit expansion and balance of payments deficits as a severe drought sharply reduced agricultural exports. By March 1962, foreign exchange reserves had fallen to USD $125 million, a 70% decrease from twelve months earlier. 

Pressured by military and agrarian interests, Guido appointed Álvaro Alsogaray as Minister of the Economy. Alsogaray was the architect of orthodox stabilization program under Frondizi and enacted similarly restrictive policies. Foreign exchange controls were liberalized and the peso was devalued by 59%. Monetary and credit conditions were tightened and M2 money supply growth was reduced from an average of 35% per year in 1960–1961 to 23% in 1962 and only 10% in 1963. Fiscal austerity was implemented and Central Bank financing of the budget deficit was virtually eliminated. 

The result was a severe two-year recession. Real GDP decreased by -1.6% in 1962 and -2.4% in 1963. Despite tight fiscal and monetary policy, inflation accelerated from 13% in 1961 to 28% in 1962 and 26% in 1963, driven by the peso devaluation and reduced subsidies for public services. Urban unemployment reached 9% in July 1963, a level that would not be exceeded for thirty years, and bankruptcies hit new records. However, the stabilization program succeeded in its primary goal of averting a balance of payments crisis with foreign exchange reserves increased to USD $320 million by the end of 1963.

Growth and a modest diversification of exports were one of the few bright spots in the economy during Guido&#x27;s term. Exports reached USD $1,385 million in 1963, an increase of over 40% from 1961 and the highest level since 1948, as agricultural production recovered from drought. Beef exports benefitted from penetrating new markets in Italy and Spain and intensive efforts to control an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease that locked Argentina out of the U.S. market. Argentina also experienced an encouraging expansion of non-traditional exports, including sugar, fruit juices, and even manufactured goods such as motor vehicle parts, agricultural machinery, tools, and textiles.

During Guido&#x27;s term, Argentina remained open to foreign direct investment which had been a cornerstone of Frondizi&#x27;s economic policy. In mid-1963, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimated that American companies had invested over USD $1 billion in Argentina and employed over 135,000 local workers in the motor vehicle, petroleum, electric appliances, pharmaceuticals, food and beverage, and consumer products industries. U.S. and European companies contributed to Argentina&#x27;s development by operating training programs, although many of the newly-trained employees subsequently sought to emigrate since their skills were in demand abroad. 

=== Foreign trade and balance of payments ===
Alsogaray&#x27;s stabilization program drove a remarkable turnaround in Argentina&#x27;s current account balance from a USD $572 million deficit in 1961 to a USD $385 million surplus in 1963. In addition to higher exports, Argentina saw a sharp 33% reduction in imports from 1961 to 1963 due to depressed consumer demand and the end of the Frondizi-era capital investment boom. The country also continued to benefit from Frondizi&#x27;s controversial petroleum contracts, which had enabled a reduction in oil imports from USD $250 million in 1958 to only USD $90 million in 1962. 

However, Argentina continued to face significant balance of payments pressures. Political instability and the &quot;serious economic disequilibrium&quot; resulted in an outflow of capital that offset the gains from a narrower merchandise trade deficit.

Dollar shortages and import restrictions also impacted efforts to revive the economy. Petroleum production declined in 1963 because state oil company Yacimientos Petroliferos Fiscales lacked dollars to import equipment and pay foreign oil companies for service contracts signed by Frondizi. 

Argentina received USD $56 million from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development in 1963, and was one of the bank&#x27;s largest recipients that year. On 29 March 1963, Guido secured a USD $322 million credit package that included new loans, foreign exchange agreements, and refinancing existing debts.

One month before the 1963 general election, the U.S. government agreed to lend USD $35.5 million to Argentina at less than 1 percent interest for a housing program and to address balance of payments issues. Unfortunately much of the foreign debt, even official assistance, was short-term in maturity. By mid-1963, it was estimated that half of Argentina&#x27;s USD $2.8 billion of external debt was payable by the end of 1966. Private Argentine companies held USD $532 million in foreign debt, nearly half of which was payable by the end of 1963, setting up continued pressure on the balance of payments.

=== Fiscal policy ===
Determined to avoid deficit monetization at all costs, Alsogaray implemented strict measures to balance the budget, including new taxes such as a 20% income tax surcharge and a 5% levy on imports. Yet in spite of his emphasis on orthodoxy, Alsogaray was responsible for a policy where government employees and contractors were paid partly in bonds rather than cash; recipients who sold their bonds were typically forced to take a discount of up to 40%.

Despite austerity measures, depressed tax revenues meant that the budget deficit actually increased from 5.6% of GDP in 1961 to 7.9% in 1962, before falling to 5.8% of GDP in 1963.

The Guido administration borrowed heavily from multilateral institutions, including a USD $25 million 15 year loan from the Inter-American Development Bank for farm mechanization.

=== Social policy ===
Argentina received aid for low-income housing. However, by mid-1963, U.S. officials decided to wind down its aid program due to Argentina&#x27;s high living standards at the time.
=== Relationship with the military ===
The Argentine armed forces saw themselves as guarantors of democracy and the Constitution. General Benjamin Rattenbach defended intervention &quot;when the opinion of the military prevails in the orientation of the Government over the opinion of the civilian political forces.&quot;

Guido&#x27;s Presidency was defined by the power struggle between the &quot;Azules&quot; and &quot;Colorados&quot; factions in the military, which resulted in violent outbreaks and ultimately a victory for the &quot;Azul&quot; forces and their leader, future military dictator Juan Carlos Onganía. The &quot;Azules&quot; moved first on 20–21 April 1962 with non-violent troop movements led by in the streets of Buenos Aires that successfully forced the resignation of Poggi and Army Secretary Marino Carreras, who were linked to the &quot;Colorados&quot;. 

&quot;Colorado&quot; influence remained strong. By August 1962, rumors were circulating that hard-line factions were planning to replace Guido with a military junta. Open skirmishes took place on 20 September 1962 with the &quot;Colorados&quot; this time reportedly firing first; however, within 72 hours the &quot;Colorados&quot; were defeated. Guido openly allied himself with the &quot;Azules&quot; and appointed Onganía as Army Commander-in-Chief on 22 September&quot;.&quot; 

Tensions peaked with an attempted coup by the &quot;Colorados&quot; on 2–5 April 1963. Although the revolt was led by retired officers from all three branches of the military, support among active duty troops was highest in the Navy and insurgents seized control of the Navy headquarters. For a moment, it appeared that Argentina would be consumed by a civil war. Yet the revolt was doomed when the Air Force and key units of the Army remained loyal to the Guido government and rebel forces surrendered on 5 April. 

Over 200 members of the armed forces were detained for participating in the April 1963 uprising. Fifteen high ranking officers reportedly escaped from prison barracks on 16 June 1963. Hoping to promote reconciliation, Guido issued a general amnesty for the &quot;Colorado&quot; insurgents on 12 September 1963.
=== Foreign policy ===
Under Guido, Argentina pursued closer ties with the U.S. and &quot;proved to be an important Cold Warrior in Latin America&quot; through its hardline stance against Cuba. In August 1962, Argentina blocked Cuba&#x27;s application to join the Latin American Free Trade Association, a clear reversal from Frondizi&#x27;s decision in January 1962 to oppose Cuba&#x27;s expulsion from the Organization of American States (OAS). When the Cuban Missile Crisis broke out in October 1962, Guido was the first Latin American leader to pledge military support to the U.S. and sent two naval destroyers, &quot;Espora&quot; and &quot;Rosales&quot;, to help the Americans enforce a blockade of Cuba. Military officials made their own independent overtures to U.S. contacts, with Brigadier General Cayo Alsina offering Air Force support to his U.S. counterpart and Onganía offering Army support in case of a land deployment. Domestic opposition to Argentina&#x27;s involvement was suppressed; on 27 October 1962, police in Buenos Aires fired tear gas into a &quot;rock-throwing mob of about 400 people.&quot;

Argentina supported an American proposal allowing the OAS to investigate Cuban sponsored subversive activity in any member state even without the member government&#x27;s permission.

U.S. authorities reciprocated. Ambassador Robert McClintock wrote to Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American Affairs Edwin Martin: &quot;The Argentine military, in my judgment, should be regarded as an asset by the United States (if rightly used) and not as a liability as some people in Washington seem to believe.&quot; President Kennedy &quot;expressed warm appreciation for Argentina’s Cuban quarantine cooperation as the first nation to offer material assistance&quot;.

In its 1962 Plan of Action for Argentina, the U.S. State Department established as a key objective to &quot;[c]ooperate with and support the Guido Government in all feasible ways in order to strengthen it vis-à-vis the military.&quot;

Cuba in turn threatened to sponsor uprisings and Castro identified Argentina as among the countries in Latin America that were ready for Cuban-style revolutions.

Argentina played a key role in President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s Alliance for Progress aid program for Latin America. 

Argentina was cited by the American Jewish Committee for anti-Semitism in the wake of Eichmann&#x27;s arrest and alleged that Fascist and anti-Semitic groups &quot;had the secret backing of certain military leaders.&quot; 

Tensions existed with Spain in spite of ideological affinity between the two right-wing &quot;sister republics&quot; due to Perón continued interference in Argentine politics while living in exile in Madrid. Spanish authorities responded that they could restrain Perón&#x27;s public activities but were not able to restrict private contacts, which reportedly included visits from Argentine union and political leaders.

=== Political rights and freedoms under Guido ===
Under pressure from the &quot;Colorados&quot;, Guido enacted a series of anti-democratic measures in the spring of 1962. On 13 April 1962, Guido convened a special session of Congress to amend the Law of Succession to give him 180 days to call for a new election rather than 30 days as the law required. Although the Senate approved the change, Guido was unable to secure approval from the Chamber of Deputies and dissolved the special session on 23 April. On 24 April, Guido annulled the results of the prior month&#x27;s provincial elections and the following day annulled the Congressional election, stating that he would &quot;not consent to a single Peronist occupying a public or elective post at whatever level, municipal, provincial or national.&quot; 

On 20 May, after the UCRP withdrew support for his administration, Guido suspended Congress altogether. 

Guido followed up on 24 July 1962 with decrees establishing the Statute of Political Parties and Law of Elections, both of which were designed to improve the electoral standing of conservative parties. The Statute of Political Parties created minimum thresholds that effectively proscribed the Peronist &quot;Unión Popular&quot; along with dozens of smaller parties, while the Law of Elections enacted proportional representation to break the UCRP and UCRI stronghold on Congressional seats.

However, the media remained relatively free under Guido. For example, &quot;La Nación&quot;, a prominent Buenos Aires newspaper, felt free to publish an editorial commenting that the Law of Succession had been applied &quot;with appreciable elasticity&quot;. 

In June 1963, Guido proscribed Unión Popular candidates from the newly formed multi-party coalition &quot;Frente Nacional y Popular&quot; (National and Popular Front). On 5 July 1963, Perón added to the confusion by ordering his supporters to cast blank ballots. However, the election was carried out peacefully and in a generally &quot;honest&quot; manner on 7 July 1963 with an 85% participation rate, demonstrating Argentines&#x27; commitment to democracy in spite of the electoral restrictions, social and political unrest, and economic stagnation at the time.

==1963 general election==
Tensions were high as the election approached with rumors that either active duty or retired military officials would stage a coup to prevent the elections. Army leaders confined troops to their barracks forestall any coup attempts while Onganía traveled to garrisons to encourage officers to support the election. The electoral tensions occurred against a backdrop of continued social and political turbulence. Two weeks prior to the election, 270,000 teachers nationwide went on strike for higher wages while movie houses shut down to protest restrictions on screening foreign films. A judge ordered the release of Celia de la Serna de Guevara, Che Guevara&#x27;s mother, who was detained for allegedly smuggling in pro-Cuban propaganda from Uruguay.

At first the &quot;Azules&quot; agreed to permit limited participation by Peronists. However, Minister of the Interior General Osiris Villegas issued last-minute decrees that eliminated the seven-party Front and threatened its Presidential candidate Vicente Solano Lima with judicial disqualification. Lima in turn accused Guido of lending &quot;his symbolic figure to this act of tyranny&quot; and warned that the &quot;military are obligated to respect the will of the people.&quot; However, Argentina&#x27;s electoral courts declined to block Lima&#x27;s candidacy, ruling that he had not be accused of an actual offense.

Villegas also disqualified Christian Democratic candidate Raul Matera for his past ties to Perón in a decree issued on 3 July 1963. Rumors circulated that Villegas would participate in a coup to prevent the elections from taking place.

The Argentine Communist party was banned and liquidated on 25 May 1963.

Guido made public appeals for his countrymen to respect the elections and allow a return to constitutional government. However, Guido rejected a demand by the &quot;Confederación General del Trabajo&quot; trade union federation to postpone the election by a week and on 19 April 1963 reluctantly authorized the arrest of 50 UCRI colleagues as ordered by Minister of the Interior General Enrique Rauch.

The general election was held as planned on 7 July 1963 with 70,000 troops deployed to maintain order. As a precautionary measure, police detained almost 400 civilian and labor union leaders across the country prior to the election. Approximately 150 of the prisoners were released by the end of July 1963 and the remainder prior to Illia&#x27;s inauguration in October.

Senators were selected by provincial legislatures and the federal capital&#x27;s electoral college on 29 July 1963.

The UCRI split again when Frondizi, still in detention, formed a new party. UCRI leader Oscar Alende campaigned on continuing Guido&#x27;s economic policies and encouraging foreign investment, although with better opportunities for the working class. Alende ruled out a coalition with the UCRP but agreed to support Illia in the electoral college vote that occurred on 31 July 1963. Argentina&#x27;s Christian Democratic party also agreed to support Illia to prevent the nomination of a compromise candidate from the military. 

The setbacks to both Perón and Frondizi were viewed favorably by &quot;Azul&quot; military leaders and considered a &quot;special triumph&quot; for Onganía. 

Instability did not end with the election. Several weeks after the election, Delia Parodi, a Peronist secretary general, warned that Perón&#x27;s followers would turn to subversion due to continued proscription on participating in Argentine political life. On 11 July 1963, Guido issued a decree that banned 29 groups considered fronts from Communist activity ranging from the Federation of Labor Unions to cultural organizations such as the Institute of Argentine-Russian Cultural Relations and the Federation of Jewish Cultural Organizations.

==Post-Presidency==
After completing his term, Guido returned to Viedma to resume his legal career. He returned to public service by accepting a position at , a state-owned hydroelectric utility established by then-dictator Onganía in 1967. He was appointed as President of Hidronor in 1973 but resigned the following year. 

Guido also played an active role in the formation of the center-right (PRP) party in 1972 under then-governor . The PRP would remain a significant force in provincial politics until the early 1990s. 

Guido died on 13 June 1975 in Buenos Aires and is buried in the city&#x27;s Recoleta Cemetery.

<text>Arturo Frondizi Ércoli (October 28, 1908 – April 18, 1995) was President of Argentina from 1958 until his overthrow in 1962. His government was characterized by an ideological shift, inspired by Rogelio Frigerio, towards a type of developmentalism less promoted by the State and more oriented to the development of heavy industry as a consequence of the installation of multinational companies. Its socio-labor, oil and educational policy had peaks of high conflict, with large demonstrations and strikes by the labor movement and the student movement, as well as numerous attacks against the government for political purposes in which 17 civilians and soldiers were murdered.

The Frondizi government suffered great pressure from the armed forces, which was imposed on it by the liberal Economy Ministers Álvaro Alsogaray and Roberto Alemann, and the retirement of Frigerio as a government advisor. Despite this, Frondizi was able to continue with its development line. He was unable to finish his presidential term, as he was overthrown by a coup on March 29, 1962. That day he was detained by the coup military and a decree of the Executive Power of José María Guido validated his detention without trial for eighteen months, preventing him from participating in the 1963 elections. Frondizi criticized the inauguration and the government of Arturo Illia, who in fact accepted the overthrow of Frondizi as legal and annulled some of his oil contracts. In 1966 he supported the military coup that overthrew Illia, thinking that the &quot;Argentine Revolution&quot; was an opportunity to make an economic revolution. However, he would abandon that idea when Adalbert Krieger Vasena assumed the Ministry of Economy.

On April 18, 1995, Arturo Frondizi died at the age of 86 at the Hospital Italiano in the city of Buenos Aires of natural causes.

== Biography ==

Arturo Frondizi was born on October 28, 1908, in Paso de los Libres, province of Corrientes, Argentina. Son of Isabella Ércoli de Frondizi and Giulio Frondizi.

The couple, shortly after getting married, had arrived in the country in the early 1890s from the Italian town of Gubbio. Giulio achieved a comfortable position for his home as a building contractor.

Arturo was one of 14 sons; his brothers included Silvio, who became a professor of law at the University of Buenos Aires (UBA) and was assassinated in 1974 by the Triple A, and Risieri, who became a philosopher and rector of the University of Buenos Aires. The family relocated to Concepción del Uruguay in 1912, and in 1923 to Buenos Aires.

In the mid-1920s, Frondizi played soccer as a defender in the lower ranks of Club Almagro. On some occasion he claimed to be a fan of said club. In 1926, he suffered a serious injury to his arm as a result of a bad fall.

Arturo and Silvio traveled in 1923 to the province of Buenos Aires accompanied by their father. They attended the Mariano Moreno National School, where later Risieri would also study. In 1925, before completing the last year of high school, Arturo tried to enter the Colegio Militar de la Nación, but was postponed.

During those last years of high school, he turned his life upside down, beginning to worry more about studies, he put aside games and sports. In this way, during the fifth year, his grades began to improve. Already as a distinguished student, he began to contribute to the student newspaper &quot;Estimulen.&quot;

=== Beginnings in politics ===
Frondizi identified with Yrigoyenismo when he was a teenager and studying in high school. Hipólito Yrigoyen had been elected president when he was 8 years old and served his term when he was 14. For the first time in Argentine history, a president had been elected by secret and compulsory vote, in massively attended elections. Despite this, and throughout his university career, Frondizi had a negative view of political activity and vowed never to set foot in a local party.

In 1927, he entered the Law School of the University of Buenos Aires, where he graduated in July 1930. He refused to withdraw his diploma of honor the year after it was issued, due to his refusal to receive it from the hands. of the then &quot;de facto&quot; president José Félix Uriburu, who had overthrown Yrigoyen on September 6 of the previous year.

His opposition to the dictatorship that overthrew Yrigoyen led him to participate in a demonstration on May 8, 1931, during which he was arrested and placed at the disposal of the provisional government.

Frondizi himself has said that this arrest decided him to put aside the career of teacher that he had planned to pursue, to start a career as a politician. At the end of 1932, he was arrested for the second time and after being released he joined the Unión Cívica Radical.

On October 28, 1932, Frondizi got engaged to Elena Luisa María Faggionato, to marry on January 5, 1933. From this union his only daughter, Elena, would be born in 1937. They built a summer cottage in 1935 at the then-secluded seaside resort town of Pinamar. After the birth in 1937 of their daughter, Elena (their only child), the Frondizis named the cottage &quot;Elenita&quot;.

In December 1933, he would be arrested for the third time, suspected of being involved in an uprising against the national government.

He led the Argentine League for the Rights of Man, the nation&#x27;s first recorded human rights organization, upon its founding in 1936. In December of that year, he narrowly escaped an assassination attempt while addressing a crowd.

== Deputy and Radical Civic Union (1946-1958) ==

Frondizi drafted a progressive platform alternative (the 1945 Declaration of Avellaneda) for the UCR before the February 1946 elections. He was elected to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies in 1946. The intransigent current then assumed the leadership of the party, with two of its members being elected, Ricardo Balbín and Arturo Frondizi, respectively, president and vice president of the radical bloc of national deputies, in the so-called Block of 44.

At the beginning of 1948, Frondizi was reelected deputy, imposing the MIR in the internal elections of the Federal Capital. In December Frondizi undertook a tour of Latin America, the United States, Europe and Africa.

=== 1951 presidential election ===

In the 1951 presidential elections, he was nominated by the Radical Civic Union to join the presidential formula as a candidate for vice president of the Nation, accompanying Ricardo Balbín as a candidate for president. The radical formula obtained 31.81% of the votes, being defeated by the Peronist formula, made up of Juan Perón and Hortensio Quijano, who obtained 62.49%.

In 1954, Frondizi was elected president of the National Committee of the UCR.

His multiple political commitments did not prevent him from dedicating himself to intellectual activity, which is how at the end of 1954 he published &quot;Petroleum and Politics&quot;, a book-complaint on the activity of oil companies in Argentina, and spoke of YPF&#x27;s monopoly on the oil sector. The book would become a best-seller the following year, during heated debates over the oil contracts signed by Perón and Standard Oil of California; Thanks to this, Frondizi would position himself in the foreground of the national political scene, reinforcing his fame as an intellectual and his leftist profile.
=== The division of the UCR ===
Parting ways with Balbin, Frondizi formed an &quot;intransigent&quot; wing of the UCR. The UCRI separated from the more conservative and anti-Perónist Ricardo Balbín at the UCR&#x27;s 1956 convention.

On November 9, 1956, the National Convention of the UCR met in Tucumán. The position of the party led by Frondizi, the Intransigence and Renewal Movement, was one of repudiation of the military government; He proposed taking the initiative and putting pressure on him by appointing a presidential formula. The Balbinistas (now separated from the MIR), unionists and sabattinistas, closer to the Liberating Revolution, rejected the proposal, since they were in favor of the military government. The National Convention voted in favor of the intransigent proposal and elected Arturo Frondizi as the candidate for President of the Nation. The unionists, balbinistas and sabattinistas, then left the Convention and on February 10, 1957, they formed a new party, a separate party, the Unión Cívica Radical del Pueblo, known as the conservative wing of the UCR.

The intransigents also split into a party and took the title of Unión Cívica Radical Intransigente. The party quickly defined a position inspired by the Declaration of Avellaneda, but adapted to the postwar situation, attracting a large number of youth and progressive sectors outside the party, such as the socialists Dardo Cúneo and Guillermo Estévez Boero or the forger Raúl Scalabrini Ortiz. These were characterized by a non-anti-Peronist national center-left position, as well as by the developmental thinking supported by Rogelio Frigerio from the magazine Qué !. Furthermore, Frondizi and Frigerio established a close relationship with the newspaper Clarín, to the point that until 1982 the newspaper identified itself with developmentalism and the future MID.

=== 1958 elections ===
The campaign for the 1958 presidential elections had a high level of activism from the militants, who, in addition to doing their usual task of stickers, began to massively paint the walls of buildings with the names of the presidential formula. Such acts did not take long to arouse criticism from the press. It was the most expensive campaign that was made up to that moment in Argentine history. The party ordered the recording of a tango entitled &quot;Frondizi, ¡Primero vos!&quot;, With lyrics and music by Daniel Quiroga.

The military dictatorship decided to ban the Peronist Party in the 1958 elections. It also established that only those provinces that had a constitution in force as of December 1, 1957, could participate in it (the provincial constitutions had been abolished by the dictatorship through the military proclamation of 1956); Due to this, citizens of the provinces of La Pampa and Misiones were not allowed to participate in the election.

Most historians accept that there was some kind of secret understanding between Perón and Frondizi for the proscribed Peronist vote to turn in favor of the UCRI candidate. It is presumed that the pact was made due to a reserved personal management of Rogelio Frigerio, who made contact with John William Cooke or with Perón himself during his exile in Venezuela, agreeing on the conditions in various meetings held, first in Caracas in January 1958 and then in Ciudad Trujillo (Dominican Republic) in March 1958.

The pact would have consisted of Perón ordering his followers to vote for Frondizi, and if he won the elections, he would have to comply with fourteen points that made up the agreement, including normalizing the unions and the CGT, repealing the decrees prohibiting Peronism and order the return to Perón of the personal property that he had left in the country and the dictatorship had confiscated.

The UCRI managed to win in all the provinces where the Frondizi-Gómez formula was presented, with which it was obtained all the governorships, the senate and two thirds of the chamber of deputies, in elections classified as unusual until today. On May 1, General Pedro Eugenio Aramburu handed over command to the president elected by suffrage on February 23, 1958, to Arturo Frondizi.

==Presidency==

His period of government was characterized by adopting developmentalism as a basic government policy, based on the recommendations of ECLAC and the definitions of the so-called dependency theory, developed from the 1950s by intellectuals from all over Latin America. However, frondizista developmentalism differed from Cepalian by resorting mainly to the establishment of multinational companies, rather than to the State, as a driving force behind industrial development. By 1956, Frondizi began to abandon the position of his book &quot;Petroleum and Politics&quot;, and thought that oil contracts with foreign industries could constitute a solution to the energy deficit.

The opening to the world also took place in the cultural field, when certain cultural manifestations that had been buried under Peronism flourished during the Frondizist period. Universities adopted new disciplines such as sociology and psychology.

As president, Frondizi struggled with conservative and military interference over much domestic and international policy. Because of economic problems in the country and a steep rise in consumer prices, the military forced him to impose harsh austerity measures in 1959, which resulted in civil unrest.

Better able to maneuver after the 1959 recession, Frondizi began to see results from his economic policies (known as &quot;desarrollismo&quot; — &quot;developmentalism&quot;); by 1961, he earned the support of much of the country&#x27;s large middle class. He tried to lift the electoral ban on Peronism. In addition, he met with Che Guevara and Fidel Castro to aid in mediating their dispute with the United States. This led the military to withdraw their support from his administration, as it opposed leftist populist movements and Communism.

In this period, most Perónists feared being associated with left-wing figures, and sided with the military in their opposition to the left. Military pressure on Frondizi did not relent. He signed the Conintes Plan in 1960, which banned Communism and suspended civil liberties, but he eschewed doing any implementation. Frondizi tried to negotiate an entente between the U.S. and Cuba with a secret meeting in August 1961 at the Quinta de Olivos residence with the Cuban envoy (and fellow Argentine) Che Guevara. The military scuttled any future talks, and Frondizi adopted a neutral stance afterwards.

=== Economic policy ===

Frondizi sought to strengthen the economy by solving the main economic problems that had haunted Argentina over the last twenty years. These included insufficiency in oil production (60% of the oil had to be imported and 80% of all the oil was used to generate electricity), inadequate steel production, the lack of electricity, and the insufficiency and obsolescence of transport (especially railways). He had inherited economic problems from Perón&#x27;s 1946-55 administration, characterized by budget deficits because of huge railroad subsidies during this period. These subsidies cost the treasury a million dollars a day. In addition, Perón had used much of the US$1.7 billion in budget reserves at the time of his election to nationalize the various private railway companies by buying them from French and British interests. The nationalized companies were modernized and expanded. Critics say they resulted in too many employees and bloated payrolls that have since strained national budgets.

Frondizi assigned economist Rogelio Julio Frigerio to develop a bold plan to make Argentina self-sufficient in motor vehicles and petroleum, as well as to quickly extend the country&#x27;s semi-developed road and electric networks. (In the 1950s, these served less than half the population, and fewer than 20% in the poorer north). Frondizi&#x27;s economic vision was a radical departure from the nationalist one of Perón. To achieve greater investment in industrial development, Frigerio supported passage of the Law of Foreign Investment. This provided foreign corporations with incentives similar to those offered to local ones. It created the Department and Commission of Foreign Investments, which was also designed to give foreign investors more legal recourse when operating in the country.

In 1962, Argentina was richer in terms of GDP per capita than Austria, Italy, Japan, and its former colonial master Spain. Inflation would rise as a result of the investments made in 1958 and 1959 (some of them emerging as regards the energy problem), to such an extent that at the beginning of 1959 it reached 113% per year.

=== Industrial policy ===

Between 1958 and 1963, the historical maximum of foreign investments in Argentina was reached: around 23% of the total for the period between 1912 and 1975. The industrial branches favored in this second stage of the import substitution process were the automotive, the oil and petrochemical, chemical, metallurgical and electrical and non-electrical machinery. Investments were oriented towards taking advantage of the possibilities offered by a protected domestic market.

In 1958, contracts were signed with US oil companies so that they would operate on behalf of YPF. The purpose was to achieve self-sufficiency in hydrocarbons and not have to buy them abroad. In three years of management, an increase of 150% was achieved in the production of oil and natural gas in Argentina. For the first time in history, the country achieved oil self-sufficiency, and Argentina went from being an importer to being an oil exporter.

===Petroleum===
Frondizi&#x27;s development of Argentina&#x27;s sizable petroleum reserves was used to foster nationalism among voters as well as strengthen the economy. When Frondizi came into office in 1958, oil production had not grown significantly since the sometimes abusive Standard Oil was forced out in the 1930s. As Argentina relied more on motor vehicles, oil imports drained the country in foreign exchange. How to achieve increased oil production was a contentious issue by the 1940s. The UCR (Radical Civic Union) favoured a state monopoly, believing it necessary to control the oil reserves. In the Declaration of Avellaneda (a common platform supported by Balbin&#x27;s UCRP—his wing of the UCR—and Frondizi&#x27;s UCRI), the state&#x27;s need to invest in oil exploration and to make Argentina self-sufficient in the short term was expressed as policy.

Frondizi encouraged foreign investment in the sectors that had created chronic trade deficits between 1949 and 1962. 90% of all foreign investment during his term went into oil exploration, oil refineries, the auto industry, steel, and household durables. Ten of the 25 largest projects were for exploration of new oil fields. The record public investment in the petrochemical sector led to a fivefold increase in synthetic rubber production; by 1962, the production of crude oil tripled to 16 million cubic meters. Achieving self-sufficiency in oil freed hundreds of millions of dollars in annual import costs for Argentina. It helped create 13 years of nearly uninterrupted economic growth, particularly in industry.
Thirty-six oil drilling rigs had been purchased for the extraction of oil, the largest purchase made in the history of Argentina. In 1960, more than one hundred of these teams were working for the Administration, twice as many as YPF normally had, thus solving the energy crisis that existed around 1958, and ending the &quot;electric diet&quot; and the blackouts that occurred. the country suffered constantly.

=== Labor policy ===
From 1957, elections were held in the unions, most of them winning Peronism. The unions had been grouped into three groups: the 62 Organizations (Peronists), the 32 Democratic Guilds (socialists and radicals) and the MUCS (communists).

In 1958, through law 14 499, it was established that each retiree would automatically receive an equivalent of 82% of what they received when they worked.

In October 1960, independent Peronist unions formed the Commission of 20 to demand the return of the General Labor Confederation (CGT), which had been intervened by the government since the military coup in 1955. To pressure the government, the Commission of the 20 declared a general strike on November 7, which forced President Frondizi to receive them and finally agree on March 3, 1961, to return the CGT to the Commission of the 20.

=== Educational policy ===

Following the university reform of 1918, Argentine education, especially at university level, became more independent of the government, as well as the influential Catholic Church. The church began to re-emerge in country&#x27;s secular educational system during Perón&#x27;s rule, when catechism was reintroduced in public schools, and parochial institutions began receiving subsidies. A sudden reversal in the policy in 1954 helped lead to Perón&#x27;s violent overthrow, however, after which his earlier, pro-clerical policies were reinstated by Aramburu.

Frondizi initially opposed Aramburu&#x27;s Law 6403 of 1955, which advanced private education generally, and parochial, or more often, Catholic-run schools (those staffed with lay teachers), in particular. Confident the new policy would be upheld, church supporters founded the Argentine Catholic University. The UCRI campaigned against the policy, though when Frondizi took office, he shifted in favor of further, pro-clerical reforms, which he then referred to as &quot;free education.&quot; Opposed by many in his own party, and especially by the President of the University of Buenos Aires (his brother, Risieri), Frondizi was open about his motivation for the policy change, declaring that &quot;I need the support of the church.&quot;

The Educational Freedom Law, signed in early 1959, also freed private universities from limits imposed by the 1885 Avellaneda Law, under which they could not issue official degrees directly, only through a public university. The law led to controversy because most of the new universities and private schools, which would become eligible for state subsidies, were religious. Supporters applauded Frondizi&#x27;s vision of private universities that could co-exist with public ones, and it was seen as a progressive measure. Those in favour of a strictly secular educational system believed the law to be a concession given to the Church in exchange for support, however, and became disillusioned with the pragmatic Frondizi.

Frondizi, however, advanced other educational reforms to dovetail with his economic policy. His administration incorporated the National Workers&#x27; University network of campuses (technical schools inaugurated by Perón in 1948) into the national university aegis, by which he established the UTN system in 1959, and opened numerous new campuses. The UTN became the leading alma mater for Argentine engineers in subsequent decades.

=== International policy ===
Arturo Frondizi maintained a policy of good relations with foreign countries.

The Frondizi presidency began in times of the Cold War and politics exterior embodied by the president sought to be at the service of a national strategy of economic development and integration. They were the beginnings of decolonization, sought to avoid conflicts even though they existed at a lower rank, within the blocks.

The Frondizi government imagined the postwar world in competition economic and peaceful coexistence, factors that replaced the bloc strategy and containment. Against a majority political opinion, he dismissed a new world conflagration. Argentina&#x27;s foreign policy should then serve a national development and integration strategy. The perimidated economic link with the United Kingdom and the need to finance development led to the foreign policy will veer towards relocation within the continent.

Frondizi becomes in more than one country the first Argentine president to set foot on these lands. He maintained strong relations with his Latin American peers, with the United States, European countries and also Asian countries.

=== Latin America ===
While Arturo Frondizi formed his cabinet, he planned a tour of countries in Latin America, with the purpose of promoting bilateral relations. Between April 7–17, 1958, frondizi toured the cities of Montevideo, Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Santiago and Lima.

=== Beagle conflict ===
After the Snipe islet incident in the Beagle Channel, the governments of Argentina and Chile tried to make approaches to solve their border problems. On February 2, 1959, President Arturo Frondizi landed at Los Cerrillos Airport and signed, together with his Chilean counterpart Jorge Alessandri, the Joint Declaration on Arbitration in which both leaders agreed to &quot;immediately enter into negotiations aimed at finding the right formulas appropriate arbitrations, which allow the resolution of existing disputes &quot;. The two presidents had agreed to submit to arbitration by the British government (or in its absence the president of the Swiss Confederation), the border dispute in the area of the Encuentro river and the valleys of Palena and California, while the Beagle dispute would be submitted to the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

A series of diplomatic protocols were signed with Chile in 1960, one of the protocols submitted the Paleina issue to arbitration, another was the Beagle Protocol, in addition to two Agreements: one for navigation through the southern channels and another for permanent arbitration. 

Presidents Frondizi and Alessandri met in Santiago de Chile, where they made a Declaration on the &quot;agreement that contains all the bases for the peaceful solution of pending boundary issues within the two countries&quot; except Antarctica. It was in this agreement that the dispute in the Beagle Channel was intended to be submitted to the decision of the Inter-American Court of Justice in The Hague. On June 12, 1960, they met in Buenos Aires the ambassadors of both countries to sign what became known as the Beagle Protocol and the Navigation Protocol, which allowed, among other things, the passage of Argentine warships through the channel and the Strait of Magellan, in addition, the treaty established limits precise, as for example, a border line that would run along the middle line of the canal leaving the canal divided for both countries. But the treaty like the Navigation Agreement were rejected by the congresses of both nations.

Throughout his entire government, Frondizi had meetings with Latin American figures such as Juscelino Kubitschek, Jânio Quadros, Jorge Alessandri, Manuel Prado Ugarteche, Adolfo López Mateos, Víctor Paz Estenssoro, among others.

=== Europe ===

Throughout the year 1960, President Frondizi carried out a European tour in which he visited Italy, The Vatican, Switzerland, France, Belgium, Germany, Holland, Great Britain and Spain.

Frondizi arrived in Rome where he was received by the President of the Italian Republic Giovanni Gronchi. The Argentine president included a short stay in the city of his ancestors: Gubbio. Frondizi visited the pontiff John XXIII in a private audience that, later, was shared by other members of the Argentine delegation. The Pope stated that the Argentina, born Catholic, sought to bring to the world a message of peace in which the values of the spirit will illuminate understanding among men.
Frondizi visited Bern. Although the Swiss country did not maintain an intense movement trade with Argentina, however it was an opportunity to do business with Swiss industrialists. The Argentine president was received by Max Petitpierre, president of the Confederación, who hailed him as &quot;the rebuilder of the economic stability of Argentina, the new liberal line that you adopted for the new Argentine economy has won the sympathy and trust of our authorities and those who support commercial relations with your country &quot;.

Frondizi arrived in France with knowledge of the discrepancy between the two countries in the United Nations Assembly, on Algeria. In the first interview between Frondizi and de Gaulle, he received him with his hand raised and a question: &quot;How has your country voted in the United Nations against France?&quot; Frondizi will responded: &quot;my country cannot stop showing solidarity with the peoples who fight for theirself-determination &quot;, and added&quot; we learned it from the influence of the French Revolution &quot;.

The Argentine president arrived in Brussels, where he received a &quot;warm reception&quot;; in the speeches the reference to José de San Martín was present, for his residence during some of his years of exile. It was the first time that a president Argentinean visited this country which ranked third in European exports to the Argentina. The Argentine president visited the port of Antwerp and took the opportunity to make contact with businessmen and authorities of the Chamber of Commerce of that city. Jacques van Offelen, Minister of Foreign Trade, was present at the press meeting given by the Argentine president.

Frondizi in Bonn and Bad Godesberg, Bethovenian cities, exalted the German contributions to universal culture. He also visited Cologne, where he met with businessmen, and Essen, a city in North Rhine-Westphalia located in the heart of the industrial region of the Rhur basin, center of the German steel industry. The Argentine president was received by Adenauer, who was accompanied by his finance minister Ludwig Erhard. At the meal offered by Chancellor Adenauer to Frondizi, he called him &quot;a friend of our country &quot;and praised the skill with which he kept the helm:&quot; we continue with interest in the development of Latin America &quot;.

The Argentine president arrived in Amsterdam, where he was received by members of the royal family: Queen Juliana and Prince Bernhard. The Dutch press had greeted to the president who came with favorable headlines. Queen Juliana entertained Frondizi with a meal in which she recalled the cordiality with which Prince Bernhard had been received, on the occasion of attending the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the declaration of Argentine independence. He stressed: &quot;isolation is no longer of our era.&quot;

Frondizi arrived in the United Kingdom, in a trip that aroused great expectations, Upon his arrival he was received by the Prime Minister English Harold Macmillan; complied with the protocol for visiting Queen Elizabeth II, the imposition of the decorations and, immediately afterwards, a meeting awaited him press at the Argentine embassy. In the two interviews with Mac Millan, the Argentine president expressed his hope that Britain would use its influence to channel investment into Argentina. The Argentine president raised the possibility that Argentina could be part of 

the OECE or, at least, have an observer, since in it Latin America it must have his voice.

Spain could not be absent from the European tour of the Argentine president, who was hailed as &quot;professor of humanism.&quot; He was received by General Francisco Franco, remembering the community of language, religion and culture that united both peoples. In the official interview, Frondizi was awarded the Order of Isabel la Catholica and, in turn, imposed on the head of the Spanish government that of the Liberator General San Martin. The two leaders held an interview behind closed doors.

=== United States and Cuba ===

Arturo Frondizi was the first Argentine president to make an official visit to the United States. He was there from January 19 to February 1, 1959. Frondizi met with Eisenhower on January 22 at the White House. The Argentine President would once again highlight the achievements of having been in office for a year, and reiterated that Argentina would need credits for hydroelectric power and producing steel. Then he mentioned the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border conflict, everyone present agreed that the solution to the conflict would be of great importance for the entire continent. Eisenhower then told Frondizi that members of his administration were watching the progress made in Argentina, and they admired the president&#x27;s courage and leadership. During a speech before the OAS Frondizi denounced the deterioration of the terms of trade in the region and supported the Pan-American Operation of President Juscelino Kubitschek, whose goal was the development and formation of capital in Latin America.

The president Eisenhower visited Argentina in February 1960. Both leaders issued the &quot;Declaration of Bariloche&quot; (a treaty on the protection of national parks), with the intention of promoting a better standard of living for the American countries.

Presidents Arturo Frondizi and John F. Kennedy came to have a good personal relationship and even mutual consultation on international issues. Although both had similar positions politically and economically, they defined certain aspects of security in the hemisphere. On the one hand, Kennedy encouraged the Alliance for Progress to counter Cuban influence in order to help underdeveloped countries and favored democratic change in Latin America. However, his administration endorsed a security policy with characteristics opposed to the foreign policy of the Frondizi government, and precisely in February 1962 he delivered a message to the country in which he defended the principle of non-intervention and the right of self-determination of the peoples. 

Kennedy wanted Argentina to be the mediator between the United States and Cuba in the conflict of the &quot;missile crisis&quot;, since these two countries were experiencing a very serious confrontation motivated by the fear of the United States that Cuba could have weapons at its disposal nuclear weapons coming from the Soviet Union pointing towards its territory. Hence, at the request of the US president, a meeting between Frondizi and Ernesto Guevara was encouraged to discuss the thorny issue in addition to trying to direct relations between the two countries after the Americans failed to invade the island. from Cuba.

Thus Frondizi tried to approach as a mediator between both sides in a neutral way, but, due to military pressure, on February 8, 1962, he would be forced to break relations with La Havana.

Four months after the revolution in 1959, Cuba was still part of the Organization of American States (OAS), the island had not yet declared itself a socialist, and the figure of Fidel Castro was even sympathetic to some sectors that would later revile him. On May 1, he arrived at the Ezeiza Airport, and Hermes Quijada was the first to welcome him on behalf of President Arturo Frondizi. He immediately arrived in Buenos Aires, and the following day he gave a famous ninety-minute speech before the Commission of the 21 of the OAS in the building of the Secretariat of Industry, in his speech praised the American democracy, which had welcomed Latin American immigrants with decorum. A group of protesters received the leader of the Cuban revolution. The visit was not welcomed by the Argentine military. During the OAS Conference, meeting in Punta del Este in January 1961, Argentine Foreign Minister Miguel Ángel Cárcano opposed the exclusion of Cuba from the inter-American system. After the conference, Frondizi received Ernesto Guevara, Argentine representative from Cuba, at the Olivos residence.

Of the four possible mediators, Arturo Frondizi argued in favor of Argentina, due to its balance in foreign policy (Brazil and Mexico were closer to third-partyism) and due to the lack of a deep internal contradiction (Chile had a conservative government with opposition communist). In the first polls, both John Kennedy and the Cubans were willing to accept that basis for the talks: Frondizi came very close to achieving a great diplomatic solution, but did not take into account the inconveniences he would encounter on his home front. Preliminary talks were held at the Cuban Embassy in Buenos Aires. Someone who did not belong to the diplomatic service, but who was linked to the Frondizi team, contacted Ernesto Guevara at that time (1961) and let the Argentine president know that the Cuban minister accepted his mediation to try to find a negotiated solution. At the same time, some Argentines such as Horacio Rodriguez Larreta (father) met with Guevara in Punta del Este and participated in the famous meeting he held with Richard Goodwin, an advisor to President Kennedy. After that conference, Guevara let Frondizi know that he was interested in talking with him. 

At that time, Guevara agreed to reach an understanding with the United States to coexist peacefully. When Guevara told Frondizi that he wanted to speak with him and that he was willing to travel to Argentina, he also added that if the news of his visit to Argentina was publicly known, his life was at great risk, and that it would most likely be murdered. Frondizi replied schematically: first, that he was preparing to receive him and considered the interview convenient; second, that if he was determined to travel, he should go to Montevideo Airport (Guevara was in Punta del Este): from that moment on, he would be under the responsibility of the Argentine government. Guevara accepted and Frondizi sent a civilian plane from Buenos Aires to the Uruguayan capital.

The meeting between President Arturo Frondizi and Ernesto Guevara caused Adolfo Mugica to resign twenty days later from his position as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Worship on August 29, 1961. Frondizi&#x27;s attitude towards the Cuban Revolution of 1959, along with the visit of Fidel Castro and Ernesto Guevara ended up weakening the government&#x27;s relationship with the military power, even more than it already was. The army formally protested these meetings with Cuban leaders, and pressured the president to change his policy with respect to Cuba. Cuban exiles in Buenos Aires tried to forge documents with the intention of implicating members of the Government in an alleged Castro plot. Frondizi ordered an investigation, and even the army&#x27;s own report, the famous case of the &quot;Cuban letters,&quot; was nothing more than a lie. Frondizi gave a speech on the national network to try to provide explanations.

=== Asia ===

During a tour of India, Thailand, and Japan, President Frondizi met Rajendra Prasad, King Rama IX and Emperor Hirohito. The objective was to seek new markets, in response to Argentina&#x27;s imperative need to trade and obtain investments, a key to the program development and trade cooperation.

One of the objectives sought with these meetings was to reinforce Argentina&#x27;s non-aligned international position in the face of the Cold War.

=== Israel: kidnapping of Adolf Eichmann ===
At the end of 1952, the fugitive Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann had been located in Argentina thanks to information provided by a friend of the Austrian Nazi hunter of Jewish origin Simon Wiesenthal. Given the difficulty that Israel could obtain the extradition of Eichmann by Argentina (with the consequent danger that the criminal would flee), the Israeli secret services of Mosad designed the kidnapping of the wanted Nazi criminal with the firm support of Israeli Prime Minister David Ben Gurion, thus violating consular assistance treaties and Argentine national sovereignty.

Finally, on May 11, 1960, Eichmann was kidnapped in the middle of the street, getting him into a private car when he was getting off the bus to return home from work. Later, the four men of the Israeli Secret Service transferred him on May 20 from Ezeiza International Airport in Buenos Aires to Israel in a private plane, with another identity and pretending that he was drunk.

Faced with this kidnapping, the Foreign Ministry, through Ambassador Mario Amadeo, complained to the United Nations Security Council for the serious violation of sovereignty. It received support from the international body, but Israel never intended to return the Nazi criminal to Argentina. Diplomats from the United States, Great Britain and France tried to formalize a meeting between President Arturo Frondizi and David Ben Gurion so that both would seek a solution to the Eichmann case, and that diplomatic relations between Argentina and Israel would not be broken as a result. After several contacts, it was agreed that the meeting between the two leaders would be held in Brussels in June 1960, finally frustrating such meeting due to misgivings between the diplomacy of both countries.

Ultimately, Frondizi severed diplomatic relations with Israel, relations that had recently been established by President Juan Perón. A short time later, Frondizi re-established ties with Israel.

On December 11, 1961, Adolf Eichmann was found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to death on December 15, carried out on May 31, 1962. His last words were: &quot;Long live Germany. Long live Austria. Long live Argentina. These are the countries that I identify with the most and I will never forget them. I had to obey the rules of war and those of my flag. I&#x27;m ready &quot;.

=== Antarctic Treaty ===

The Antarctic Conference was inaugurated in Washington, D.C., United States on October 15, 1959, in an atmosphere of uncertainty, attended by representatives of twelve states, of which seven claimed their sovereignty over some fraction of the Antarctic continent, among which were : Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Norway, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. The territorial rights claimed by Argentina, Chile, and the United Kingdom overlapped considerably. Meanwhile, five other countries (Belgium, the United States, Japan, South Africa and the Soviet Union) had carried out explorations in the region without having presented territorial claims. There were aspects of the future regulation for Antarctica that had the general consensus of the nations, such as the pacification of the continent and excluding all activities of a warlike nature, as well as guaranteed access for scientific research for any country that desired to do so. The most complex problem was the consideration of sovereignty claims.

Argentina&#x27;s position was to establish the peaceful use of Antarctica and scientific cooperation within agreed limits, and that the Conference not modify the rights of the parties in the least. Regarding the use of the territory, the Argentine Government maintained the need to put limits on absolute freedom, in order to preserve ecological interests, and to prohibit nuclear tests and the deposit of radioactive waste. The last proposal took the US delegation as well as the Soviet one by surprise, and the Argentine insistence on it came close to causing a crisis in the meeting, not only internationally, but also within the government of Arturo Frondizi.

The treaty was finally signed on December 1, 1959, and was maintained in accordance with the demands of Argentina that activities of a military nature had to be outlawed. The Antarctic Treaty entered into force on June 23, 1961. The pact had some success since the area remained free of conflict. The council also succeeded in internationalizing and demilitarizing the Antarctic continent, where nuclear testing and storing radioactive waste were banned. During the Cold War these activities were carried out with great intensity by the belligerent powers. It was ensured that the region is used for peaceful purposes, including mainly joint exploration and scientific research. The signatory countries obtained free access to the entire region with reciprocal rights to inspect their facilities.

In his speech on May 1, 1960, Frondizi dedicated a paragraph to the Conference on Antarctica, stating that Argentina had been able to include in the treaty its opposition to the internationalization of the area. The principles of freedom and scientific cooperation had also been included in the treaty.

After signing the treaty, Frondizi visited Antarctica. On March 6, 1961, he embarked, along with his entourage, in the Aguirre Bay to go to the Decepción base (Decepción Island). The outward journey was somewhat uncomfortable, as they had to endure severe storms at the crossing of Drake Pass. On March 8 in the afternoon, they anchored in Bahía 1º de Mayo, and then with the icebreaker General San Martín the first tributes were paid to the authorities who disembarked, being transferred by helicopters and boats to the detachment where the honors were repeated. The military vicar Donamin held a mass, and from there Frondizi gave a speech to the country and greeted the members of the National Navy, researchers, scientists and technicians.

==Overthrow==

Around 4:00 in the morning, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army Poggi sent a radiogram to all the military units communicating: &quot;The President of the Republic has been deposed by the Armed Forces. This decision is immovable.&quot;

At 7:45 a.m. on March 29, 1962, Frondizi left the Olivos residence by car accompanied by his usual personal custody and by Captain Eduardo Lockhart, Head of the Military House, heading to the distant Metropolitan Airport a few minutes from trip, where he boarded a Navy plane that took him to Martín García Island where he was detained. Lockhart had personally drawn up the instructions to be delivered to the head of the base - who had already been notified by telegraph of the trip - so that he would receive treatment according to his status as former president.

After ordering the overthrow of Frondizi at 4:30 in the morning, the coup plotters remained without defining who would take over the government. Just at 11:00 am, &quot;with the presidential office vacant for almost eight hours,&quot; the three commanders held the first of many other meetings to evaluate the alternatives.

But Frondizi, aware that he did not have much time left in government, idealized a plan.

=== Frondizi&#x27;s plan ===
Since the previous day, a group of civilians and soldiers had been moving against the clock and in the midst of great difficulties, to carry out Frondizi&#x27;s latest plan, destined to save what could be legally, making Guido swear before the Supreme Court, under of the law of acephalia.

The difficulties to carry out Frondizi&#x27;s plan were many. Guido had no direct contact with Frondizi and his loyalty to the President prevented him from making any decision that Frondizi had not ordered. Martínez, for his part, did not belong to the UCRI, he had assumed as Minister two days ago on the recommendation of Aramburu and did not even know Guido personally.

For that, Guido himself, the members of the Supreme Court, the coup commanders and the leaders of the UCRI had to be convinced. Potash says that four men played the most important roles in this operation: Defense Minister Rodolfo Martínez, Supreme Court President Julio Oyhanarte, Air Force Commander-in-Chief and one of the coup leaders Brigadier Cayo Alsina, and himself Arturo Frondizi.

=== Guido&#x27;s oath before the Supreme Court ===
At 3:55 p.m., when the formalities for Guido&#x27;s oath before the Supreme Court were still being completed, the three coup leaders settled in the Casa Rosada. Aware of the fact and with Guido on his way to court, Martínez went to the Casa Rosada to buy time and prevent the military from formally taking over the government, especially Poggi, who showed a clear intention to assume as president. Shortly after five o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, Guido appeared at the Supreme Court to take the oath, visibly shaken. The oath was carried out in the utmost reserve, with the sole presence of the judges of the Court, Guido, and his private secretary. Minister Martínez had asked General Aramburu to join the small group, but Aramburu did not accept.

Tradition indicated that the oath was taken on the Bible, but due to the urgency and the lack of a Bible in the offices of the Court, the decision was made to take the oath on the text of the Constitution. Immediately afterwards Guido burst into tears and embraced Oyhanarte, asking that he not be considered a &quot;traitor to his party or the people.&quot; Villegas Basavilbaso for his part said - expressing his objections -: &quot;We can say, like Cicero, that we have saved the Republic by violating the law.&quot; It was Colombres who replied: &quot;Cicero is wrong, because whoever saves the Republic can never be breaking a law.&quot;

==Later life==

Frondizi was held in detention until July 1963. After his release and the return of Frigerio from exile, they founded the Integration and Development Movement (MID) on a developmentalist platform. Unable to field candidates in the 1963 elections due to military and conservative opposition, the MID and Perón agreed on a &quot;National Popular Front.&quot; The alliance was scuttled by military pressure, and the MID endorsed a &quot;blank vote&quot; option. Those among Frondizi&#x27;s former allies who objected to this move backed the progressive former Buenos Aires Province Governor, Oscar Alende, an erstwhile Frondizi ally who ran on the UCRI ticket (its last) and finished second.

Following the pragmatic Arturo Illia&#x27;s election, the MID was allowed to participate in the 1965 legislative elections, sending 16 members to the Argentine Chamber of Deputies. Policy differences over Frondizi-era oil contracts, which Illia rescinded, led the MID to oppose him actively. Frondizi initially welcomed the 1966 coup against Illia. Frigerio became a significant shareholder in Argentina&#x27;s largest news daily, &quot;Clarín&quot;, following a 1971 deal made with the news daily&#x27;s owner, Ernestina Herrera de Noble. Her late husband and &quot;Clarín&quot; founder Roberto Noble had supported Frondizi.

With Perón&#x27;s return from exile imminent, Frondizi chose to endorse the aging leader&#x27;s ticket for the 1973 elections. Following seven years of military rule, the reopened Argentine Congress included 12 MID Deputies. Frondizi was given little say in the new Perónist government, and its policy shifted from populism to erratic crisis management measures. The return of peronism exacerbated political tensions in Argentina, and there was an outbreak of violence between factions. In 1973, members of Perón&#x27;s government organized the Triple A, a right-wing death squad. Among its estimated 600 murder victims was Frondizi&#x27;s brother, Law Professor Silvio Frondizi, who had served as chief counsel to the Trotskyist ERP. He was killed in 1974.

Frondizi initially supported the 1976 coup against Perón&#x27;s successor (his inexperienced widow Isabel Perón). He dropped his early support for the regime because it appointed an ultra-conservative Economy Minister, José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz. Numerous MID figures received death threats.

The dictatorship conducted the Dirty War against the political opposition, killing and injuring tens of thousands of political opponents and distantly related suspects in terrorist disappearances, kidnappings and tortures. In 1982 it was defeated in the Falklands War, which further damaged its popular support. Finally the junta allowed return to democracy with elections in 1983. The dictatorship left an insolvent Argentina; business, political and consumer confidence almost shattered; and international prestige damaged because of its years of state terrorism against its population.

Suffering from the early stages of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Frondizi named his friend, Frigerio, the MID nominee for president. Refusing to condemn the regime&#x27;s human rights atrocities, the MID fared poorly on election night. It garnered 4th place (1.5%) and elected no congressmen.
Elected by an ample margin, UCR leader Raúl Alfonsín excluded Frondizi from the economic policy discussions he held before taking office. In 1986 Frigerio succeeded the ailing Frondizi as President of the MID, though the former president remained influential in the party. The MID maintained a considerable following in a number of the less developed Argentine provinces, where voters had fond memories of the Frondizi administration&#x27;s development projects. It helped elect allies within the Justicialist Party (Peronists), in Formosa and Misiones Provinces, as well as Mayoral candidate Néstor Kirchner in Río Gallegos, Santa Cruz Province; Kirchner was elected as governor and, in 2003, President of Argentina.

Frondizi supported Peronist candidate Carlos Menem in the May 1989 elections. His support soured when Menem turned to neo-liberal and free trade policies.

=== Personal life and death ===
Frondizi lost his daughter in 1976, and his wife in 1991. Living in seclusion in his Beruti Street apartment (in Buenos Aires&#x27; northside), Frondizi occasionally received political figures seeking advice.

On April 18, 1995, Arturo Frondizi died at the age of 86 at the Italian Hospital in the city of Buenos Aires for unknown causes. His death went so unnoticed that to this day it is very difficult to find out the exact cause of it. In 2019 his remains, which rested in the Recoleta Cemetery, were transferred to the Concepción del Uruguay.

Three years after his death, in 1998, the Konex Foundation awarded the memory of the former president with the decoration of honor.

=== Theft of the presidential sash and stick ===
On April 3, 2008, almost one hundred years after his birth, and the Casa Rosada museum was being remodeled since January of that year, an employee noticed that the cane and the presidential sash that Frondizi had donated seventeen years earlier to the museum were missing. . No explanations were found for this fact, since there were four security cameras around the museum sector, and to enter it you had to leave a fingerprint, but, apparently, no progress was made in the investigation of this case.

== Tribute and legacy ==

Arturo Frondizi is recognized not only as a lucid and effective politician, but as a statesman, that is, a politician capable of looking beyond the routines of the situation, a consideration that surely includes more or less critical nuances, but with its lights and shadows even his most bitter opponents ponder him. In 1958 Frondizi set out to think the nation in tune with the theoretical and political categories that he considered more modern. Sixty years later Frondizi won its place in history and developmentalism continues to be one of the most interesting and suggestive proposals when it comes to thinking about the national destiny.

Dr. Arturo Frondizi was the democratic president of the Argentines between 1958 and 1962. His prestige, based on personal and political values, has grown over time. He was an intellectual &quot;borrowed&quot; from politics and a builder of examples, prosperity and wealth for his country and his people. He lived with austerity and died surrounded by the affection and recognition of a grateful society. Increasingly, Argentine democracy and Argentines exalt his figure and serve as a role model of the politician with ethical, civic conduct and as a public servant.

On Friday, October 28, 1999, a plaque with the name of the former Argentine president was discovered in a square in the city of Gubbio, in the Italian region of Umbria where Frondizi&#x27;s parents were born, on the occasion of the anniversary of his birth. The mayor of the city, Ubaldo Corazzi and the president of the local Rotary Club, Gaetano Nardelli, represented the Italian officials. On behalf of Argentina, the ambassador to Italy, Félix Borgonovo; the Minister of Education, Manuel García Solá; the head of the Arturo Frondizi Foundation, Dr. Cañete and the former minister and official of the Frondizi government, Antonio Salonia. This is how this square in Gubbio was named «Piazza Arturo Frondizi».

Argentine politicians such as Cristina and Néstor Kirchner, Roberto Lavagna, Ricardo López Murphy and Eduardo Duhalde (among others), claimed to be admirers of Arturo Frondizi&#x27;s management, regardless of their ideology or political party. Many of them considered him one of the best leaders, and also, as the last president with a country project.

Ten years after his death, a tribute was paid at the central headquarters of Banco Nación, on Rivadavia Avenue, in front of the Casa Rosada, where more than one hundred and fifty friends and great followers of him gathered. Frondizi was a great defender of democracy. Through his permanent developmentist affirmation, &quot;he opened a path that Argentines must necessarily travel&quot;, said Raúl Alfonsín, who praised Frondizi in this way despite the fact that they had both belonged to different lines of radicalism, which were very much at odds at that time. The tribute lasted all that day.

On March 6, 2008, the Legislature of the City of Buenos Aires renamed the 9 de Julio Sur Highway with the new name of Autopista Presidente Arturo Frondizi in homage to the former Argentine president.

By municipal ordinance 5465 of October 7, 2008, the name of &quot;President Arturo Frondizi&quot; was imposed on the Junín Industrial Park in homage to the contribution that the ex-president made to the national industry. The corresponding act was carried out on November 7, 2009.

On June 22, 2008, the official courier presented a stamp with the slogan &quot;Arturo Frondizi - 100 years after his birth - 50 years since he became president of the Nation&quot; in the Blue Room of the Palace of the National Congress. On the stamp you can see the face of the former president, and next to it, some oil extraction pumps, all with a light sky blue background.

On October 28, 2008, a statue in homage to the former president was erected in a square that bears his name in Paso de los Libres.

On April 3, 2009, the Argentine Government ordered the issuance of a coin with the image of Arturo Frondizi, in commemoration of the hundredth anniversary of his birth and the fiftieth anniversary of his assumption as president of the Argentine Nation. The measure was made official on March 4, 2009, in Law 26,479, published in the Official Gazette. The regulation bears the signature of Vice President Julio Cobos, that of the President of the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Fellner and that of Parliamentary Secretary Enrique Hidalgo.

On September 29, 2010, the councilors unanimously approved the draft ordinance to name &quot;President Arturo Frondizi&quot; to the La Carlota industrial park. The councilors participated in the Honorable Deliberative Council on September 29. The Justicialista Party supported the project, as did the UCEDE. Radicalism was not present, although Vice President Roberto Gadea stated that: «the important thing is the Industrial Park, therefore, the name is fine; so we also support this agreement.

Frondizi also received an extensive list of decorations and recognitions both nationally and internationally.

# The economic plan was known as Developmentalism. Basically, it consisted in achieving industrialization through foreign investment. This idea came originally from Raul Prebisch from the CEPAL (Economic Commission for Latin America) and was modified by Rogelio Frigerio, the right hand of Frondizi.
# The government created both departments under the orbit of the &quot;Secretary of socio-economic relations&quot; (controlled by Frigerio) on the 21 of July 1958

<text>Amrum (; &quot;Öömrang&quot; North Frisian: &quot;Oomram&quot;) is one of the North Frisian Islands on the German North Sea coast, south of Sylt and west of Föhr. It is part of the Nordfriesland district in the federal state of Schleswig-Holstein and has approximately 2,300 inhabitants.

The island is made up of a sandy core of geestland and features an extended beach all along its west coast, facing the open North Sea. The east coast borders to mudflats of the Wadden Sea. Sand dunes are a characteristic part of Amrum&#x27;s landscape, resulting in a vegetation that is largely made up of heath and shrubs. The island&#x27;s only forest was planted in 1948. Amrum is a refuge for many species of birds and a number of marine mammals including the grey seal and harbour porpoise.

Settlements on Amrum have been traced back to the Neolithic period when the area was still a part of the mainland of the Jutland peninsula. During the Middle Ages, Frisian settlers arrived at Amrum and engaged in salt making and seafaring. A part of the modern population still speaks Öömrang, a dialect of the North Frisian language, and Frisian traditions are kept alive.

With the island hosting many endangered species of plants and animals, its soil being largely unproductive for agriculture and as a popular seaside resort in general, Amrum&#x27;s population today almost exclusively lives from the tourism industry.

== Geography ==

Amrum&#x27;s area measures 20.4 km2, making it the tenth-largest island of Germany (excluding Usedom which is partly Polish territory). Including the large Kniepsand beach on the western shore to the surface area results in a total area of c. 30 km2. Amrum&#x27;s surface area has however been subject to constant change due to land loss and gain caused by the sea. During the 19th century, a 20th part of the area recorded in the beginning of the century had been lost, but in 1913, a net gain was again recorded at the Kniepsand.

Amrum is one of three isles with a geestland core in Nordfriesland. This sandy core is made up of glacial deposits from the Saalian glacial period. To the east, it borders to the Wadden Sea mudflats of the North Sea. The east side is also where the island&#x27;s historic hamlets are situated: Norddorf, Nebel, Süddorf and Steenodde. On the geestland core, one can find extended areas of heath and woodland which form a strip that runs along a north-south line on the axis. West of this woodland strip, a region of is covered with dunes that run all along the island for about 12 km. The maximal width of this area amounts to more than a kilometre. Amrum&#x27;s tallest dune near Norddorf is called &quot;a Siatler&quot; (the settling dune); it reaches 32 m in height. Northward, the dune area extends into a small peninsula called &quot;Odde&quot;. In the south of Amrum, the newest settlement, Wittdün, is located. West of the dunes, the entire shore of Amrum is made up of the &quot;Kniepsand&quot; beach; it counts among northern Europe&#x27;s largest sand beaches. North of Norddorf there is some marshland, another small marsh area can be found between Süddorf and Steenodde. Both of them are protected from the sea by dikes. During low tide it is possible to reach the neighbouring island of Föhr by mudflat hiking.

Amrum&#x27;s population amounts to about 2,300 and the island is divided into three municipalities: Norddorf, Nebel and Wittdün. All are within the &quot;Amt&quot; Föhr-Amrum.

===Villages===

The northernmost settlement is the seaside resort of Norddorf with a decoy pond and a sector light. Amrum&#x27;s largest village, Nebel, is located near the eastern coastline. Notable sights there include the church of St. Clement with its &quot;talking gravestones&quot;, the &quot;Öömrang Hüs&quot; - a museum of local history, a wind mill and the Cemetery of the Homeless. Süddorf, today a district of Nebel, is the island&#x27;s oldest hamlet. The Amrum Lighthouse is located there. Steenodde, also a neighbourhood of Nebel, had long been Amrum&#x27;s only port until Wittdün, founded 1890, had taken over as the island&#x27;s major ferry terminal. Of the three municipalities, Wittdün is most clearly influenced by tourism.

==History==

The oldest traces of settlements in the area date back to the Neolithic with a number of dolmens among them. Also many tomb sites from the Bronze and Iron Ages have been preserved. In the dunes west of the decoy pond, the remainders of an Iron Age hamlet have been found. It is unknown whether the Ambrones, who together with the Cimbri and Teutones threatened Rome around 100 BC, stemmed from this island which back then was still connected to the mainland by a land bridge. In the early Middle Ages the island was colonised by the Frisians. The oldest known record of Amrum island has been found in the &quot;Danish Census Book&quot; of King Valdemar II of Denmark from 1231.

Next to salt making, agriculture, fishery and whaling, merchant shipping was one of the main sources of income for a long time. Hark Olufs, a sailor from Süddorf who had been enslaved by Algerians in 1724, advanced to the rank of a General until he was allowed to return to his native island in 1736. During the late 19th century, tourism became a rapidly emerging business on Amrum and effectively changed the island&#x27;s economy.

During the Middle Ages, Amrum, as well as all of North Frisia proper, belonged to the so-called &quot;Uthlande&quot;, the Outer Lands, which only successively became parts of the Danish realm or the Duchy of Schleswig. After the conflicts between the Danish kings and the counts of Schauenburg about the rule over Schleswig, Amrum and western Föhr became an enclave of Denmark and contrary to neighbouring areas, it was not any longer a part of the Duchy of Schleswig. This state endured until 1864, when Denmark lost Schleswig to Prussia after the Second Schleswig War. For a brief period after that war, Amrum was ruled together by Prussia and Austria, yet in 1867 the island came under Prussian rule and was made a part of the province of Schleswig-Holstein. At first, Amrum formed a municipality within the district of Tondern. In 1920, the Schleswig Plebiscites resulted in a clear majority vote for Amrum staying with Germany, while Tondern fell back to Denmark. Until 1972, Amrum belonged to the &quot;Südtondern&quot; district which then merged into the newly created district of Nordfriesland.

During the 19th century, Amrum still had a considerably lower population than today. Church records from 1821 to 1833 show an average population of 587, a census in 1860 noted 642 inhabitants, and in 1871, the population had dropped to 571. Among other factors, the decrease owed to the fact that large parts of Amrum&#x27;s population had emigrated — mainly to the United States. Today, more people with ancestors from Amrum live in the United States than there are on Amrum proper, and the connections between Amrum and the U.S. are still being cultivated.

Eventually, tourism began only to flourish on the island when a seaside resort was established in Wittdün in 1890, which also led to a rapid increase in population.

On 29 October 1998, the cargo ship &quot;Pallas&quot; ran aground off Amrum, causing a severe oil spill in the region.

==Language and culture==

The main language on Amrum is German. The North Frisian language in the Öömrang dialect is spoken by roughly a third of the population. Those 800 Amrumers are all multilingual. Due to the isolated location of the islands, the North Frisian dialects developed so differently, that &quot;Öömrang&quot; can be understood by people from Föhr, yet is hardly recognisable for those from Sylt or mainland Nordfriesland. Many Amrumers moreover speak Low German, since it had been the language of the coastal sailors. Only a few people speak the Danish language.

Amrum&#x27;s national costume for girls and women is coloured black and white and is amply decorated with silver ornaments. It is mostly worn on confirmation services or at tourist events.

There are two peculiar traditions on Amrum. On February 21 the &quot;Biakendai&quot; is celebrated, where a great bonfire is lit to dispel winter. On the occasion, people blacken each other&#x27;s faces with soot. The festival originates from the old liturgical holiday of Cathedra Petri, which was originally celebrated on February 22. The custom is also popular in other North Frisian municipalities. On New Year&#x27;s Eve the &quot;Hulken&quot; takes place, where groups of mostly young people dress up in costumes and walk from house to house to let others guess their true identity (similar to Halloween). Depending on their age, they are either treated with sweets or alcoholic drinks.

==Economy==
Amrum&#x27;s main branch of economy is tourism. In 2007 the island could provide 12,000 beds. In 2008 approximately 135,000 tourists and 1.3 million lodgings were registered.

Agriculture is also being practised on Amrum and the port hosts a single fisherman.

===Media===
The local newspaper is called &quot;Der Insel-Bote&quot; (The Island Courier) and published by the Schleswig-Holsteinischer Zeitungsverlag. It is the common paper for both Föhr and Amrum.

Moreover, Amrum was the set for many German cinematic and TV films, e.g. &quot;Tod auf Amrum&quot; (1998) or &quot;Sommer&quot; (2008), as well as numerous crime novels. It is also the location that Netflix filmed Black Island.

==Transport==
The island is connected by ferry services to neighbouring Föhr and to the mainland at the harbour of Dagebüll. During the summer season, a fast passenger boat offers services between the ports of Hörnum on Sylt, the Hallig Hooge and the harbour of Strucklahnungshörn on Nordstrand. Amrum&#x27;s terminal is located at Wittdün, the ferries are operated by &quot;Wyker Dampfschiffs-Reederei GmbH (W.D.R.)&quot;. Most tourists will reach Amrum via Dagebüll. From there, the ferry journey takes 90 minutes on a straight route, but the more usual route via a stop at Wyk auf Föhr takes 120 minutes.

The ferry service to the Halligen and the mainland terminal of Schlüttsiel was terminated in 2019 because the port of Schlüttsiel has become too silted up for extended traffic.

On the island, the bicycle is the main means of transport next to cars; compared to other areas of Germany, Amrum provides an excellent network of bicycle routes. Numerous bicycle rental services exist for tourists. A bus service connects Norddorf, Nebel and Wittdün on an hourly schedule (every 30 minutes during the summer season). Like the ferries, the bus service is operated by W.D.R.. A less common form of transport is mudflat hiking between Amrum and Föhr.

From 1893 to 1939, a railway service was operated on Amrum. There is no airstrip on the island because any plans to establish one have so far vehemently been opposed.

==Flora and fauna==
Plants and wild animals on Amrum are marked by the proximity to the sea, but some also distinguish themselves by extreme rarity and a high ecological value worth of protection. This fact was acknowledged by the establishment of two nature reserves and Amrum&#x27;s proximity to the Schleswig-Holstein Wadden Sea National Park.

===Flora===

Amrum&#x27;s vegetation is determined by the sea and by the different types of landscapes on the island, most of which are low in nutrients. In parts of the dune belt and on the &quot;Kniepsand&quot; marram grass or sea wormwood grow, as well as numerous other sand-loving plants like sheep&#x27;s bit which will bloom in sheltered areas between the dunes. Also some stunted pines, bent by the sea wind, and &quot;Salix repens&quot;, the creeping willow can be found there. Until the 1970s, the rare sea holly could still be seen in the dunes.

East of there are heaths and conifer or mixed forests. In some dune slacks, peat bogs can be found which occasionally host the carnivorous plant common sundew. The once abundant marsh gentian vanished during the 1990s.

The Amrum forest was mainly planted in 1948 on an area of heath. Until then only a few forested regions could be found around the decoy ponds. With 180 hectares, Amrum has the largest ratio of forested land of all Germany&#x27;s North Sea islands. Mainly pines, firs and birches can be found here. Meanwhile, the forest has largely lost its artificial nature. So one will encounter numerous plants on all levels and many species of fungi. The &quot;geestland&quot;, east of the forest, is mostly used for farming. Its grassland grows plants such as Harebell (&quot;Campanula rotundifolia&quot;), Sea Thrift (&quot;Armeria maritima&quot;) and Carthusian Pink (&quot;Dianthus carthusianorum&quot;) and several species of hawkweed.

In the small marshlands, some sedges and the ragged robin may be seen. Here is the most nutritious soil on Amrum. Even the soil of Amrum&#x27;s gardens is so low in nutrients that only a few sorts of plants, e.g. hollyhock, will grow there without fertilising.

On the salt marshes along the eastern shore of Amrum, many salt-tolerant species can be found. Pioneer plants such as &quot;Salicornia europaea&quot; and alkali grasses, grow on and stabilize the mudflats.

===Fauna===
Like the vegetation, Amrum&#x27;s wildlife is determined by the island&#x27;s location within the North Sea. Thus there are only a few species of wild mammals on Amrum, such as hares, mice, hedgehogs and bats. In the 12th century, rabbits were introduced as game. Still today they populate the island. A few years ago a pregnant vixen was set free on Amrum. She and her offspring caused severe damage to the island&#x27;s fauna, but since then they have been hunted down. In the sea and on the sand bars off Amrum, thus within the National Park, harbour seals, grey seals and harbour porpoises have their habitats. Occasionally in December and January, young grey seals are washed ashore on Amrum&#x27;s beaches due to storm surges and are thereafter nursed by the adults. In January 2010 the seal shelter station at Friedrichskoog announced that more and more female grey seals were &quot;moving away from less favourable birth sites near Amrum and Sylt to Heligoland.&quot;

Birdlife is particularly plentiful. Amrum counts among the most important hatching areas for seabirds in Germany. It is the only remaining hatching area for the Eurasian curlew in the Wadden Sea, and the main hatching region for the common eider, but also oystercatchers, shelducks, Arctic terns, seagulls like herring gulls, common gull and the lesser black-backed gull, as well as many other species, use to hatch there on the beach, in between the dunes or at the mudflats. Since the dunes of Amrum are a protected nature reserve, they are the only dunes along the west coast of Schleswig-Holstein where seagulls and ducks breed. In other dune areas of the North Sea coast these birds are usually scared off by tourists. Additionally vast flocks of migratory birds will rest on Amrum during the season, e.g. red knot, brent goose or sanderling, all of whom are able to find sufficient food along the coasts of Amrum. Moreover, a number of songbirds can be found and pheasants which were equally introduced as game are common.

Lizards and amphibians, such as moor frog, natterjack toad and smooth newt are other examples of land vertebrata.

In the sea surrounding Amrum numerous fish species typical of the North Sea can be found, like plaice and atlantic herring. A 1940 report mentioned several worms like Nematodes, Archiannelida, Oligochaeta and Turbellaria, crustaceans like ostracods, and ciliate protozoans in the sands of the Kniepsand beach. Since the 1980s, the abundance of harbour porpoises in the sea off Amrum and Sylt has been increasing and a protected marine area was created in 1999 to provide shelter for them.

The number of other marine species is equally great, the hermit crab, the common whelk, and the lugworm are all among them. Of them, mainly the sand shrimps are commercially used by &quot;harvesting&quot; them from the seabed with cutters. The shrimps are then wrongly marketed as &quot;crabs&quot; (&quot;Krabben&quot;).

<text>Sigmoidoscopy (&quot;sigma&quot;, the Greek term for letter &quot;s/ς&quot; + &quot;eidos&quot; + &quot;scopy&quot;: namely, to look inside an &quot;s&quot;/&quot;ς&quot;-like object) is the minimally invasive medical examination of the large intestine from the rectum through to the nearest part of the colon, the sigmoid colon. There are two types of sigmoidoscopy: flexible sigmoidoscopy, which uses a flexible endoscope, and rigid sigmoidoscopy, which uses a rigid device. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is generally the preferred procedure. A sigmoidoscopy is similar to, but not the same as, a colonoscopy. A sigmoidoscopy only examines up to the sigmoid, the most distal part of the colon, while colonoscopy examines the whole large bowel.

== Flexible sigmoidoscopy ==
Flexible sigmoidoscopy enables the physician to look at the inside of the large intestine from the rectum to the left side of the colon, called the sigmoid. Physicians may use the procedure to find the cause of diarrhea, abdominal pain, or constipation. They also use it to look for benign and malignant polyps, as well as early signs of cancer in the descending colon and rectum. With flexible sigmoidoscopy, the physician can see intestinal bleeding, inflammation, abnormal growths, and ulcers in the descending colon and rectum. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is not sufficient to detect polyps or cancer in the ascending or transverse colon (two-thirds of the colon). However, although in absolute terms only a relatively small section of the large intestine can be examined using sigmoidoscopy, the sites which can be observed represent areas which are most frequently affected by diseases such as colorectal cancer, for example the rectum.

For the procedure, the patient must lie on their side on the examining table. The physician inserts a short, flexible, lit tube into the rectum and slowly guides it into the colon. The tube is called a sigmoidoscope. The scope transmits an image of the inside of the rectum and colon, so the physician can carefully examine the lining of these organs. The scope also blows air into these organs, which inflates them in order to help the physician see better.

If anything unusual is in the rectum or colon, like a polyp or inflamed tissue, the physician can remove a piece of it using instruments inserted into the scope. The physician will send that piece of tissue (biopsy) to the lab for testing.

Bleeding and puncture of the colon are possible complications of sigmoidoscopy. However, such complications are uncommon.

Flexible sigmoidoscopy takes 10 to 20 minutes. During the procedure, the patient might feel pressure and slight cramping in the lower abdomen, but the patient will feel better afterward when the air leaves the colon.

== Preparation ==
The colon and rectum must be completely empty for flexible sigmoidoscopy to be thorough and safe, thus the patient must drink only clear liquids for 12 to 24 hours beforehand. This includes bouillon or broth, gelatin, strained fruit juice, water, plain coffee, plain tea, or diet soft drinks.

The night before or right before the procedure, the patient receives a laxative (e.g. macrogol, lactulose etc.) and/or an enema, which is a liquid solution that washes out the intestines. 
No sedation is required during this procedure as long as the examination does not exceed the level of the splenic flexure.

== Rigid sigmoidoscopy ==
Rigid sigmoidoscopy may be useful in ano-rectal diseases such as bleeding per rectum or inflammatory rectal disease, particularly in the general practice and pediatrics.

For performing the examination, the patient must lie on the left side, in the so-called Sims&#x27; position. The bowels are previously emptied with a suppository, and a digital rectal examination is first performed. The sigmoidoscope is lubricated and inserted with in general direction of the navel. The direction is then changed and the obturator is removed so that the physician may penetrate further with direct vision. A bellows is used to insufflate air to distend the rectum. Lateral movements of the sigmoidoscope&#x27;s tip negotiate the Houston valve and the recto-sigmoid junction.

==Benefits==
Several studies have shown the potential benefits of sigmoidoscopy in detecting colorectal cancer.

In a 2009 Norwegian study, results were somewhat inconclusive at seven years.

We found a trend towards reduced mortality from colorectal cancer for both total colorectal cancer mortality (27% reduction) and rectosigmoidal cancer mortality (37%), but this was not statistically significant in intention to screen analysis. Corresponding reductions in mortality among attenders (that is, the people actually screened, instead of just the ones in the group to be screened—this data set may include selection bias) were 59% and 76%, both statistically significant compared with the control group[.]

The study saw no detectable difference in all-cause mortality.

A 2010 British study showed sigmoidoscopy reduced &quot;overall colorectal cancer incidence and mortality by 31 percent&quot;, and &quot;incidence of cancer in just the lower part of the colon (or distal colon) was reduced by approximately 50 percent for those who underwent screening compared with those in the control group.&quot;
Overall colon-cancer mortality was reduced by 43% (thus preventing one cancer per 200 screenings, and one cancer death per 500 screenings). The study also showed that the effect was persistent—a single sigmoidoscopy reduced cancer rates for the length of the 11-year study.

==Risks==
Although generally considered quite safe, sigmoidoscopy does carry the very rare possibility of tearing of the intestinal wall by the instrument, which could require immediate surgery to repair the tear; in addition, removal of a polyp may sometimes lead to localized bleeding which is resistant to cauterization by the instrument and must be stopped by surgical intervention.

<doc id="339679" wikidata="Q188974" url="?curid=339679" title="Pedro Eugenio Aramburu">
<text>Pedro Eugenio Aramburu Silveti (May 21, 1903 – June 1, 1970) was an Argentine Army general and the &quot;de facto&quot; President of Argentina from 1955 to 1958. He was a major figure behind the &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot;, the military coup against Juan Perón in 1955. He was kidnapped by the left-wing organization Montoneros on May 29, 1970, and then murdered as part of retaliation. He had been involved in the June 1956 execution of Army General Juan José Valleassociated with the Peronist movement and 26 Peronist militants, after a botched attempt to overthrow his regime.

==Family==
Pedro Eugenio Aramburu Silveti was born on May 21, 1903, in Río Cuarto. Both of his parents were born in Spain. His father, Carlos Pantaleón Aramburu, was born in Zestoa, Basque Country, while his mother, Leocadia Silveti, was born in Zuriáin, Navarre. He had eight siblings.

==Military career==
*He studied at the National Military College
*1922: Sub-lieutenant
*1939: Major
*1943: War School Teacher
*1951: Brigadier
*War School Headmaster
*1955: Commander in Chief of the Army
*1958: Lieutenant general.

==President of Argentina==
He served as &quot;de facto&quot; president of Argentina from November 13, 1955, to May 1, 1958.

The &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; which overthrew Juan Perón was triggered in part by his actions towards the press, as well as the imprisonment of opposition leaders and economic instability. For example, Perón incited his followers to wreck the offices and printing presses of newspapers who criticized him and he jailed the leader of the opposition, Ricardo Balbin, of the Radical Civic Union party. The military Revolución Libertadora against Perón for these actions led to three years of military rule under Aramburu, who allowed elections to be held in 1958.

Aramburu&#x27;s military government forced Perón into exile and barred the Peronist Party from further elections. Perón lived in exile in Spain until 1973.

He repealed the reelectionist and statist Constitution of 1949 and restored the validity of the historical text of 1853/60, a decision that was later validated by a constituent convention. He promised to hand over power as soon as possible to a president elected by the people. He made a public commitment that none of the military who held positions in his government would accept candidacies when elections were called.

== Anti-Peronist political power ==
After the end of his presidential term in 1958, Aramburu retired from the military career and devoted himself entirely to politics.

He ran for president in 1963 as leader of the Union of the Argentine People (&quot;Unión del Pueblo Argentino,&quot; UDELPA), with the slogan &quot;Vote UDELPA and HE won&#x27;t return&quot; (&quot;Vote UDELPA y no vuelve&quot;), referring to Perón.

With the Peronists banned, the Presidential elections resulted in Arturo Umberto Illia becoming president, with Aramburu coming in third.

Yet the military retained much real power, censoring both Peronism and its leader. The fragility of Argentine democracy was shown when Illia was overthrown in 1966 by a military coup led by General Juan Carlos Onganía.

In 1970, Aramburu was mentioned as a possible presidential candidate.

== Kidnapping and death ==
On May 29, 1970, at noon, Aramburu was snatched from his apartment in Buenos Aires by two members of Montoneros posing as young army officers. Montoneros dubbed the kidnapping &quot;Operación Pindapoy&quot;, after a company that produced citrus in the 1960s. Aramburu&#x27;s disappearance kept Argentinian society on tenterhooks for a month before it was discovered that Aramburu had been assassinated three days after his abduction, following a mock trial and his corpse hidden inside a farmhouse near Timote, Carlos Tejedor, in Buenos Aires Province. He had been shot twice in the chest with two different pistols. Mario Firmenich took credit for the kidnapping and assassination.

In the following weeks, statements from Montoneros flooded the media. Their actions were a response to the executions of twenty-seven Peronist militants who took part in an unsuccessful coup d&#x27;état in 1956 (a retaliation).

== Legacy ==
Following his abduction and murder, Aramburu became a martyr for the anti-Peronist movement in Argentina. For Peronists, on the other hand, Aramburu&#x27;s assassination was a dream come true, and was considered a valid act of retaliation for the executions of Juan José Valle and Raúl Tanco after their failed uprising against the Revolución Libertadora.

<text>Eduardo Ernesto Lonardi Doucet (; September 15, 1896 – March 22, 1956) was an Argentine Lieutenant General and served as de facto president from September 23 to November 13, 1955.

==Biography==
Lonardi was born on September 15, 1896. His father, Eduardo Policarpo Lonardi Monti was born in Ospitaletto (Brescia), while his mother, Blanca Delia Doucet Santa Ana, was from Rosario.

Lonardi was appointed military attaché to Chile during the presidency of Ramón Castillo in 1942, shortly afterward he was declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; by the Chilean government on accusations of espionage. Returning to Argentina, he participated in the coup that overthrew Castillo. He then was appointed military attaché to Washington, DC around 1946 where he stayed for a few years. He then permanently returned to Argentina.

==President of Argentina==
Eduardo Lonardi, a Catholic nationalist, assumed leadership of the &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; junta that overthrew Juan Perón on September 16, 1955. He was greeted by chants of &quot;Cristo Vence&quot; (&quot;Christ is Victorious&quot;) when arriving in Buenos Aires. Favoring a transition with &quot;neither victors nor vanquished&quot;, his conciliatory approach was deemed too soft by the liberal faction of the armed forces, who deposed him less than two months into his de facto presidency and replaced him with hard-liner Pedro Aramburu.

==Later years and death==
He went to the United States to receive cancer treatment. He returned to Argentina and died on 22 March 1956 from cancer.

<text>Overflow National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a 13,973 acre (56.55 km2) national wildlife refuge in Ashley County, Arkansas. Overflow NWR is one of three refuges forming an administrative complex, which also includes Felsenthal NWR and Pond Creek NWR to the west.

== Habitat and wildlife ==
Overflow National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was established in 1980 to protect one of the last remaining bottomland hardwood forests in the Mississippi Alluvial Plains. These forests are considered vital for wintering migratory waterfowl populations in the Mississippi Flyway. The refuge is composed of nearly 14,000 acres of bottomland hardwood forests, shrub wetlands, moist-soil units, and upland pine-hardwood forests. It also contains a old growth Sugar Maple and American Beech forest.

Overflow NWR has been recognized as a state-wide Important Bird Area by the National Audubon Society. Carefully timed flooding of the bottomlands and moist-soil units stimulates the growth of native wetland plants, insects, crustaceans, and mollusks. These high energy foods are crucial for the survival of migratory waterfowl and shorebirds.

<doc id="339686" wikidata="Q15290" url="?curid=339686" title="Good">
<text>In most contexts, the concept of good denotes the conduct that should be preferred when posed with a choice between possible actions. Good is generally considered to be the opposite of evil. The specific meaning and etymology of the term and its associated translations among ancient and contemporary languages show substantial variation in its inflection and meaning, depending on circumstances of place and history, or of philosophical or religious context.

== History of Western ideas ==
Every language has a word expressing &quot;good&quot; in the sense of &quot;having the right or desirable quality&quot; (ἀρετή) and &quot;bad&quot; in the sense &quot;undesirable&quot;. A sense of moral judgment and a distinction &quot;right and wrong, good and bad&quot; are cultural universals.

=== Plato and Aristotle ===

Although the history of the origin of the use of the concept and meaning of &quot;good&quot; are diverse, the notable discussions of Plato and Aristotle on this subject have been of significant historical effect. The first references that are seen in Plato&#x27;s &quot;The Republic&quot; to the Form of the Good are within the conversation between Glaucon and Socrates (454c–d). When trying to answer such difficult questions pertaining to the definition of justice, Plato identifies that we should not &quot;introduce every form of difference and sameness in nature&quot; instead we must focus on &quot;the one form of sameness and difference that was relevant to the particular ways of life themselves”, which is the form of the Good. This form is the basis for understanding all other forms, it is what allows us to understand everything else. Through the conversation between Socrates and Glaucon (508a–c) Plato analogizes the form of the Good with the sun as it is what allows us to see things. Here, Plato describes how the sun allows for sight. But he makes a very important distinction, &quot;sun is not sight&quot;, but it is &quot;the cause of sight itself&quot;. As the sun is in the visible realm, the form of Good is in the intelligible realm. It is &quot;what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower&quot;. It is not only the &quot;cause of knowledge and truth, it is also an object of knowledge&quot;.
Plato identifies how the form of the Good allows for the cognizance to understand such difficult concepts as justice. He identifies knowledge and truth as important, but through Socrates (508d–e) says, &quot;good is yet more prized&quot;. He then proceeds to explain that &quot;although the good is not being&quot; it is &quot;superior to it in rank and power&quot;, it is what &quot;provides for knowledge and truth&quot; (508e).

In contrast to Plato, Aristotle discusses the Forms of Good in critical terms several times in both of his major surviving ethical works, the &quot;Eudemian&quot; and &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot;. Aristotle argues that Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good does not apply to the physical world, for Plato does not assign &quot;goodness&quot; to anything in the existing world. Because Plato&#x27;s Form of the Good does not explain events in the physical world, humans have no reason to believe that the Form of the Good exists and the Form of the Good thereby, is irrelevant to human ethics.

Plato and Aristotle were not the first contributors in ancient Greece to the study of the &quot;good&quot; and discussion preceding them can be found among the pre-Socratic philosophers. In Western civilisation, the basic meanings of κακός and ἀγαθός are &quot;bad, cowardly&quot; and &quot;good, brave, capable&quot;, and their absolute sense emerges only around 400 BC, with Pre-Socratic philosophy, in particular Democritus. Morality in this absolute sense solidifies in the dialogues of Plato, together with the emergence of monotheistic thought (notably in &quot;Euthyphro&quot;, which ponders the concept of piety (τὸ ὅσιον) as a moral absolute). The idea is further developed in Late Antiquity by Neoplatonists, Gnostics, and Church Fathers.

=== Ancient western religions ===
Aside from ancient Greek studies of the &quot;good&quot;, more than twenty-five hundred years ago in the eastern part of ancient Persia a religious philosopher called Zoroaster simplified the pantheon of early Iranian deities into two opposing forces: Ahura Mazda (Illuminating Wisdom) and Angra Mainyu (Destructive Spirit) that were in conflict.

For the western world, this idea developed into a religion that spawned many sects, some of which embraced an extreme dualistic belief that the material world should be shunned and the spiritual world should be embraced. Gnostic ideas influenced many ancient religions, which teach that &quot;gnosis&quot; (variously interpreted as enlightenment, salvation, liberation, or &quot;oneness with God&quot;) may be reached by practising philanthropy to the point of personal poverty, sexual abstinence (as far as possible for &quot;&quot; and totally for &quot;initiates&quot;), and diligently searching for wisdom by helping others.

This development from the relative or habitual to the absolute is evident in the terms &quot;ethics&quot; and &quot;morality&quot; as well, both being derived from terms for &quot;regional custom&quot;, Greek ἦθος and Latin &quot;mores&quot;, respectively (see also &quot;siðr&quot;).

=== Medieval period in western cultures ===
Medieval Christian philosophy was founded on the work of Bishop Augustine of Hippo and theologian Thomas Aquinas, who understood evil in terms of Biblical infallibility and Biblical inerrancy, as well as the influences of Plato and Aristotle, in their appreciation of the concept of the Summum bonum. Silent contemplation was the route to appreciation of the Idea of the Good.

Many medieval Christian theologians both broadened and narrowed the basic concept of &quot;Good and Evil&quot; until it came to have several, sometimes complex definitions such as: 
* a personal preference or subjective judgment regarding any issue that might earn praise or punishment from the religious authorities
* religious obligation arising from Divine law leading to sainthood or damnation 
* a generally accepted cultural standard of behaviour that might enhance group survival or wealth
* natural law or behaviour that induces strong emotional reaction
* statute law imposing a legal duty

=== Modern concepts ===
==== Kant ====

A significant enlightenment context for studying the &quot;good&quot; has been its significance in the study of &quot;the good, the true, and the beautiful&quot; as found in Immanuel Kant and other Enlightenment philosophers and religious thinkers. These discussions were undertaken by Kant, particularly in the context of his &quot;Critique of Practical Reason&quot;.

==== Rawls ====
John Rawls&#x27;s book &quot;A Theory of Justice&quot; prioritized social arrangements and goods, based on their contribution to justice. Rawls defined justice as &quot;fairness&quot;, especially in distributing social goods, defined fairness in terms of procedures, and attempted to prove that just institutions and lives are good, if every rational individual&#x27;s goods are considered fairly. Rawls&#x27;s crucial invention was the original position, a procedure in which one tries to make objective moral decisions by refusing to let personal facts about oneself enter one&#x27;s moral calculations.

== Opposition to evil ==

In religion, ethics, and philosophy, &quot;good and evil&quot; is a very common dichotomy. In cultures with Manichaean and Abrahamic religious influence, evil is usually perceived as the antagonistic opposite of good. Good is that which should prevail and evil should be defeated. 

As a religious concept, basic ideas of a dichotomy between good and evil has developed in western cultures so that today:
* &quot;Good&quot; is a broad concept, but it typically deals with an association with life, charity, continuity, happiness, love, and justice
* &quot;Evil&quot; typically is associated with conscious and deliberate wrongdoing, discrimination designed to harm others, humiliation of people designed to diminish their psychological needs and dignity, destructiveness, and acts of unnecessary and/or indiscriminate violence 
* the dilemma of the human condition and their capacity to perform both good and evil activities 

== In Buddhism == 
In cultures with Buddhist spiritual influence, this antagonistic duality itself must be overcome through achieving &quot;Śūnyatā&quot;, or emptiness. This is the recognition of good and evil not being unrelated, but two parts of a greater whole; unity, oneness, a Monism.

== In the field of biology ==
Morality is regarded by some biologists (notably Edward O. Wilson, Jeremy Griffith, David Sloan Wilson, and Frans de Waal) as an important question to be addressed by the field of biology.

<text>The Bald Knob National Wildlife Refuge is a (2014) wildlife refuge located in White County, Arkansas about two miles south of the town of Bald Knob. The refuge is managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. The refuge features large numbers of migratory waterfowl and bald eagles during the winter months.
The Bald Knob National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1993 when the U.S. government purchased a large rice farm from the John Hancock Insurance Company. The refuge consists of acres of agricultural land, of bottomland hardwood forest including wetland sloughs and oxbow lakes, of land being reforested, and of roads, levees, and other man-made facilities. The refuge is bordered on the south by the Little Red River. Bald Knob NWR is near the Henry Gray/Hurricane Lake State Wildlife Management Area 

==Wildlife==

The refuge provides a protected habitat for migratory waterfowl, other birds, and endangered species
12,900 acres of the refuge is a former rice farm with extensive irrigation systems This is used to grow rice, soybeans, maize, and millet with emphasis on providing food and habitat for migratory waterfowl. The irrigation system is also utilized to provide habitat for wading birds, mudflats for shorebirds, and to simulate natural flooding of hardwood forests.

Bald Knob National Wildlife Refuge is part of the most important wintering area for ducks in North America. It is especially important as a wintering and stopover point for migrating pintail ducks of which more than 200,000 have been recorded on a single day. Bald Knob hosts the largest winter population of pintails in Arkansas. Other winter waterfowl species include mallards, blue-winged teal, wood ducks, Canada geese and white-fronted and lesser snow geese. Agricultural land, river sloughs and brakes, bottomland hardwoods and fallow fields provide a diverse habitat that nurtures wintering waterfowl. Bald eagles are common during winter months. Bird watching is popular. Hunting for ducks and geese is permitted under regulation by the refuge. White-tailed deer, rabbit, and squirrel may be hunted in the reforestation areas. Access to most of the refuge is by all-terrain vehicle trails or on foot. Other mammal species that inhabit this refuge are raccoon, bobcat, coyote, river otter and beaver.

The refuge attracts 40,000 visitors per year (2014). Only day use is permitted. Some areas are closed to visitors to protect wildlife and habitat.

<doc id="339712" wikidata="Q7232" url="?curid=339712" title="Emperor Yuan of Han">
<text>Emperor Yuan of Han, personal name Liu Shi (劉奭; 75 BC – 8 July 33 BC), was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty. He reigned from 48 BC to 33 BC. Emperor Yuan promoted Confucianism as the official creed of the Chinese government. He appointed adherents of Confucius to important government posts.

However, at the same time that he was solidifying Confucianism&#x27;s position as the official ideology, the empire&#x27;s condition slowly deteriorated due to his indecisiveness, his inability to stop factional infighting between officials in his administration, and the trust he held in certain corrupt officials. He was succeeded by Emperor Cheng.

== Family background ==
When Emperor Yuan was born Liu Shi in 75 BC, his parents Liu Bingyi and Xu Pingjun were commoners without titles. Bingyi was a great-grandson of Emperor Wu, and his grandfather Liu Ju was Emperor Wu&#x27;s crown prince, until Emperor Wu&#x27;s paranoia forced him into a failed rebellion in 91 BC while Bingyi was still just an infant. The aftermath of the failed rebellion was that Prince Ju committed suicide and his entire family was executed. Bingyi was spared because of his young age, but became a commoner and survived on the largess of others. One of his supporters was chief eunuch Zhang He, who had been an advisor for Prince Ju before his rebellion, and who was punished by being castrated.

Around 76 BC, Zhang wanted to marry his granddaughter to Bingyi, but his brother Zhang Anshi (), then an important official, opposed his decision, fearing that it would bring trouble to his family. Zhang, instead, invited one of his subordinate eunuchs (who had also been castrated by Emperor Wu), Xu Guanghan (), to dinner, and persuaded him to marry his daughter Xu Pingjun to Liu Bingyi. When Xu&#x27;s wife heard this, she was furious and refused her permission, but because Zhang was Xu&#x27;s superior, Xu did not dare to renege on the promise. Bingyi and Pingjun were married in a ceremony entirely paid for by Zhang (because Bingyi could not afford the cost). Zhang also paid the bride price. After their marriage, Bingyi heavily depended on his wife&#x27;s family for support.

== Childhood and career as a crown prince ==
Shi was less than a year old when something very unusual happened to his father. Shi&#x27;s great-granduncle, Emperor Zhao(漢昭帝), had died that year and the regent, Huo Guang霍光, having been dissatisfied with his initial selection of Prince He of Changyi, deposed Prince He and offered the throne to the commoner Bingyi instead. Bingyi accepted and took the throne as Emperor Xuan. Shi&#x27;s mother Xu Pingjun was made empress as they were the descendants of Emperor Wu Of Han.

This action would cost Empress Xu her life, however, and cost Prince Shi his mother. Huo Guang&#x27;s wife, Xian (), would not be denied her wish of making her daughter Huo Chengjun () an empress. In 71 BC, Empress Xu was pregnant when Lady Xian came up with a plot. She bribed Empress Xu&#x27;s female physician Chunyu Yan (), under guise of giving Empress Xu medicine to help ease her pain and control blood flow after she gave birth, to poison Empress Xu. Chunyu did so, and Empress Xu died shortly after she gave birth. Her doctors were initially arrested to investigate whether they cared for the empress properly. The Emperor deep mourned for his beloved wife and would look to the case for many years to follow and in 66 BC and he would later kill the entire family except Empress Huo. That would make Lady Xian, alarmed and she informed Huo Guang what had actually happened, and Huo, not having the heart to turn in his wife, instead agreed to Chunyu&#x27;s release.

In April 70 BC, Emperor Xuan made Huo Chengjun empress. Accustomed to luxury living, her palace expenditures far exceeded the late Empress Xu.

Huo Chengjun becoming empress was a threat to Prince Shi&#x27;s life. On 24 May 67 BC, Emperor Xuan made the eight-year-old Prince Shi into Crown Prince and awarded Empress Xu&#x27;s father and Prince Shi&#x27;s grandfather, Xu Guanghan, the title of Marquess of Ping&#x27;en. Huo Guang opposed these actions. Huo&#x27;s wife, Lady Xian was shocked and displeased, because if her daughter ever had a son, why would he only be forever a prince and not the future emperor. She instructed her daughter to murder the crown prince. Allegedly, Empress Huo did make multiple attempts to do so, but failed each time. Around this time, the emperor also heard rumours that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, which led him to begin stripping the Huos of actual power, while giving them impressive titles.

In 66 BC, after there had been increasing public rumours that the Huos had murdered Empress Xu, Lady Xian finally revealed to her son and grandnephews that she had, indeed, murdered Empress Xu. In fear of what the emperor might do if he had actual proof, Lady Xian, her son, her grandnephews, and her sons-in-law formed a conspiracy to get the emperor deposed. The conspiracy was discovered, and the entire Huo clan was executed by Emperor Xuan. Empress Huo was striped of all her titles but not executed, but Emperor Xuan decided 12 years later that he wanted her to be exiled; in response, she committed suicide.

What Empress Huo tried to do influenced Emperor Xuan in his choice of the next Emperess. At the time, his favoured consorts were consort Hua, consort Zhang, and consort Wei, each of whom he had children with. He almost settled on Consort Zhang as his new empress. However, he hesitated, remembering how Empress Huo had tried to murder the crown prince. He therefore resolved to making an empress who was childless and kind. He decided on the gentle Consort Wang, and made her empress in 64 BC. Emperor Xuan put Prince Shi in her care, and she cared for him well.

Empress Wang would have a role in Crown Prince Shi&#x27;s eventual choice of a wife. In the middle of the 50s BC, Consort Sima, the favourite consort of Prince Shi, died from an illness. Prince Shi was grief-stricken and became ill and depressed. Emperor Xuan was concerned, so he had Empress Wang select the most beautiful of the young ladies in waiting and had them sent to Prince Shi. Wang Zhengjun was one of the ladies in waiting chosen. With her, he had his first-born son Liu Ao (劉驁, later Emperor Cheng) c. 51 BC. Prince Ao became Emperor Xuan&#x27;s favourite grandson and often accompanied him.

During his years as crown prince, Prince Shi did not have a major role in governing the country, given the forceful nature of his father. He was taught the Confucian classics by a succession of Confucian scholars during his pre-teen and teenage years. Prince Shi became a mild-mannered and strict adherent of Confucian principles, unlike his father who made effective use of both Legalist and Confucian principles in his governance. This would bring his father&#x27;s ire on him.

In 53 BC, when Emperor Xuan and Prince Shi were having dinner, he suggested that Emperor Xuan employ more Confucian officials in key positions. Emperor Xuan became extremely angry and commented that Confucian scholars were impractical and could not be given responsibilities, and further commented that Emperor Yuan&#x27;s reign would lead to the downfall of the Liu imperial clan, words that would turn out to be prophetic. This would also bring his father to consider changing the succession plans, as he was also disappointed by Prince Shi&#x27;s general lack of resolve. He considered making Prince Shi&#x27;s younger brother, Liu Qin, the Prince of Huaiyang, crown prince instead. However, he could not bring himself to do so, remembering how Prince Shi&#x27;s mother, Empress Xu, was his first love and had been murdered by poisoning, and also how he depended on his father-in-law in his youth. Prince Shi&#x27;s position therefore was not seriously threatened.

In 49 BC, Emperor Xuan became seriously ill. Before his death, he commissioned his cousin-once-removed Shi Gao (), Prince Shi&#x27;s teacher Xiao Wangzhi (:zh:蕭望之), and Xiao&#x27;s assistant Zhou Kan () to serve as regents. After he died, Prince Shi ascended the throne as Emperor Yuan.

== Reign as emperor ==
As emperor, Emperor Yuan immediately started a regimen of reducing governmental spending, with the objective of reducing the burdens of the people. He also started a program for social assistance to provide stipends for the poor and also for new entrepreneurs. Contrary to his father&#x27;s governing philosophy, he relied heavily on Confucian scholars and put them into important governmental positions.

In 48 BC, Emperor Yuan made Consort Wang Zhengjun, the mother of his first-born son, Prince Ao, empress. On 17 June 47 BC, he made Prince Ao crown prince.

In 46 BC, alarmed at the high human and monetary cost of occupying Hainan and suppressing the frequent native rebellions, Emperor Yuan decreed that the two commanderies on the island be abandoned. Similarly, in 40 BC, alarmed at the high cost of maintaining imperial temples, he reduced the number of standing temples.

=== Factionalism ===
Early in Emperor Yuan&#x27;s administration a factional schism developed, a phenomenon that would plague his entire reign and cause officials to concentrate on infighting rather than effective governance. One faction included mainly Confucian scholars, his teachers, Xiao and Zhou, aligned with an imperial clan member who was also a Confucian scholar, Liu Gengsheng (劉更生, later named Liu Xiang 劉向), and imperial assistant Jin Chang (). The other faction was his cousin-twice-removed Shi, imperial secretary Hong Gong () and chief eunuch Shi Xian (). Hong Gong and Shi Xian are recorded as being the Emperor&#x27;s lovers. Yuan gave them both key administrative positions, which eventually proved disastrous as they plotted the deaths of many officials who opposed them.

The Confucian faction derived their power from the fact that Emperor Yuan trusted and respected their advice. The &quot;court faction&quot; derived their power from their physical closeness to the emperor and their key roles in processing reports and edicts for Emperor Yuan. Policy-wise, the Confucian faction advocated returning to the ancient policies of the early Zhou dynasty, while the court faction advocated keeping the traditions of the Han dynasty.

In 47 BC, Hong and Shi used procedural traps which led to Zhou and Liu being demoted to commoners and Xiao retired. Later that year, the court faction further pressed Xiao into committing suicide. They did this by tricking Emperor Yuan into deciding to have Xiao investigated for inducing his son to make a petition for him, something considered inappropriate. Hong and Shi calculated that Xiao would rather commit suicide than face an investigation, and that was what Xiao did. As a result, the court faction prevailed. Consistent with his personality, Emperor Yuan rebuked Hong and Shi harshly for misleading him and buried Xiao with great honour, but did not punish Hong (who died later that year) and Shi.

In 46 BC, Emperor Yuan summoned Zhou back to his administration and gave him a mid-level office, along with Zhou&#x27;s student Zhang Meng (張猛, a grandson of the great explorer Zhang Qian). Despite the relatively low positions that Zhou and Zhang had, their advice was highly valued by Emperor Yuan. In 44 BC, he promoted the highly regarded Confucian scholar Gong Yu (), who tried not to engage himself in factional politics, to the position of vice prime minister, and heeded many of his suggestions to further reduce governmental spending and to encourage the study of Confucianism.

In 43 BC, there were a number of unusual astronomical and meteorological signs that were considered signs of divine disapproval. Shi Xian and his allies, the Xu and Shi clans, alleged that this was a sign of divine disapproval of Zhou and Zhang&#x27;s policies. Zhou and Zhang were demoted to local posts. In 42 BC, he promoted another Confucian scholar, Kuang Heng (), to be his key advisor, and Kuang, aware of the fate of the other Confucian scholars, entered into an alliance with Shi Xian to ensure his own safety and power.

In 40 BC, more unusual signs occurred and Emperor Yuan asked the court faction to explain how they could continue to occur if, as they alleged, they were signs of divine disapproval of Zhou and Zhang. They could not, and so Emperor Yuan summoned Zhou and Zhang back to the capital to serve as advisors. However, this would not last long, as Zhou soon died of a stroke, and Shi Xian found an opportunity to falsely accuse Zhang of crimes and forced him to commit suicide.

In 37 BC, another Confucian scholar would try to shake the influence of Shi Xian. He was Jing Fang (), who, in addition to studying Confucianism, was also an accomplished fortune teller. (At this time, fortune telling was still considered to be a part of Confucian studies, indeed, a highly honoured part; it was not until several decades later that Confucians began to disfavour fortune telling.) Jing, who had become a trusted advisor of Emperor Yuan after Emperor Yuan greatly favoured his proposed system for examining and promoting regional officials, accused Shi and Shi&#x27;s assistant Wulu Chongzong () of being corrupt and evil. Initially, Emperor Yuan believed him, but took no action against Shi and Wulu. Shi and Wulu soon found out and fought back by accusing Jing of conspiring with Emperor Yuan&#x27;s brother Liu Qin, the Prince of Huaiyang, and Prince Qin&#x27;s uncle. As a result, Jing was executed.

=== Victory over western Xiongnu and complete hegemony over central Asia ===
Around the same time, despite Emperor Yuan&#x27;s general tendency for pacificism, a military confrontation had developed with one branch of Xiongnu, which had split into competing courts ruled by &quot;Chanyus&quot; Huhanye in the east and Zhizhi in the west. During Emperor Xuan&#x27;s reign, Chanyu Huhanye had officially submitted to Han as a subject and received Han assistance. Chanyu Zhizhi, then the stronger of the two, tried to maintain a détente with Han by sending his son Juyulishou () to the Han court, but was not so willing to submit, and soon found himself out-powered by the Han-assisted Huhanye. In 49 BC, the last year of Emperor Xuan&#x27;s reign, Chanyu Zhizhi headed north-west and conquered several Xiyu kingdoms, basing his capital in Jiankun (modern Altay, Xinjiang). From there, he frequently attacked one of the Han&#x27;s ally, the Wusun.

In 44 BC, Chanyu Zhizhi sent an ambassador to offer tributes to Han, but at the same time demanded that Han deliver his son Juyilishou back to him. Emperor Yuan commissioned a guard commander, Gu Ji (), to escort Juyilishou. Initially, based on advice from Gong and other key officials, who reasoned that Zhizhi had no real intention to submit and was far away, Emperor Yuan instructed Gu to escort Juyilishou only to the Han borders, and let him travel the remaining journey on his own. Gu reasoned that by escorting Juyilishou all the way to Jiankun, he might be able to persuade Zhizhi to submit, and that he was willing to risk his own life to do so. Emperor Yuan agreed and Gu escorted Juyilishou to Jiankun. Chanyu Zhizhi was not impressed and had Gu executed. Zhizhi then realized that he made a major mistake, and he allianced with Kangju to conquer Wusun, a traditional enemy of Kangju. They repeatedly inflicted heavy victory appon victory against the Wusun over the course several years.

In 36 BC, two Han commanders, Gan Yanshou () and his lieutenant Chen Tang (), took the initiative start a war on Zhizhi. Zhizhi, after winning many victories over the Wusun and other Xiyu kingdoms, had become exceedingly arrogant, and treated his ally, the king of Kangju, as a subject, he even executed king Kangju&#x27;s daughter, who had been married to him as part of the alliance. He also forced the other kingdoms in the region, including the powerful Dayuan, to pay him tribute.

Chen felt that Chanyu Zhizhi would eventually become a major threat and devised a plan to eliminate him. Reasoning that Zhizhi was a powerful warrior but lacked the affection to kingdoms that subjected to him, and also that his new capital (on the banks of Lake Balkhash) had only recently been built and lacked strong defences, his plan was to use the colonization forces that the Han army had in Xiyu as well as Wusun forces to advance to and capture Zhizhi&#x27;s capital. Gan agreed with his plan and wanted to request approval, but Chen feared that civilian officials would disapprove of this plan. Therefore, when Gan fell sick, Chen forged of imperial edicts and requisitioned the colonization military forces as well as forces of the other kingdoms that submitted to Han authority. Once Gan recovered, he tried to reverse Chen&#x27;s actions, but Chen warned him that it was too late to do so. They then set out (after submitting reports admitting to forging edicts but providing the reasons for doing so), marching along two routes, one force taking a route through Dayuan and the other through Wusun. The forces rejoined when they entered Kangju. They then set a trap for Zhizhi, by pretending that they were running low on supplies, to ward off the possibility that Zhizhi would flee. Zhizhi took the bait and stayed in his capital. The coalition forces soon arrived at his capital and besieged it later killing Chanyu Zhizhi in the subsequent battle.

After this Chanyu Huhanye made an official visit to the Han capital of Chang&#x27;an in 33 BC and formally asked to become a &quot;son-in-law of Han&quot;. In response, Emperor Yuan gave him five ladies in waiting as a reward, and one of them was the beautiful Wang Zhaojun. Impressed that Emperor Yuan gave him the most beautiful woman that he had ever seen, Huhanye offered to have his forces serve as the northern defence forces for Han, a proposal that Emperor Yuan rejected as ill-advised, but the relationship between Han and Xiongnu thereafter grew stronger.

== Succession issues ==

Emperor Yuan had two favourite concubines in addition to Empress Wang, Consort Fu () and Consort Feng Yuan (), each of whom bore him one son. Empress Wang apparently tried to maintain a cordial relationship with both, and she was largely successful, at least as far as Consort Feng was concerned. However, a struggle between Empress Wang and Consort Fu for their sons&#x27; heir status erupted.

As Crown Prince Ao grew older, Emperor Yuan became increasingly unhappy with his fitness as imperial heir and impressed with Consort Fu&#x27;s son, Prince Kang of Dingtao (). Several incidents led to this situation. One happened in 35 BC, when Emperor Yuan&#x27;s youngest brother Prince Liu Jing of Zhongshan () died. Emperor Yuan became angry because he felt that the teenage Crown Prince Ao was not grieving sufficiently, particularly because Princes Ao and Jing were of similar age and grew up together as playmates, thus showing insufficient respect to Prince Jing. Prince Ao&#x27;s head of household, Shi Dan (), a relative of Emperor Yuan&#x27;s grandmother and a senior official respected by Emperor Yuan, managed to convince Emperor Yuan that Crown Prince Ao was trying to stop Emperor Yuan himself from over-grieving, but the seed of dissatisfaction was sown.

As the princes grew older, Emperor Yuan and Prince Kang became closer. They shared a love of and skills in music, particularly the playing of drums. Prince Kang also showed high intelligence and diligence, while Crown Prince Ao was known for drinking and womanizing. When Emperor Yuan grew ill during 35 BC, an illness that he would not recover from, Consort Fu and Prince Kang were often summoned to his sickbed to attend to him, while Empress Wang and Crown Prince Ao rarely were. During his illness, apparently encouraged by Consort Fu, Emperor Yuan reconsidered whether he should make Prince Kang his heir instead. Only the intercession of Shi Dan, who risked his life by stepping onto the carpet of the imperial bed chamber, an act that only the empress was allowed to do (on pain of death) led Emperor Yuan to cease those thoughts. When Emperor Yuan died in 33 BC, Crown Prince Ao ascended the throne (as Emperor Cheng).

<text>A school district is a special-purpose district that operates local public primary or secondary schools or both in various countries. It is not to be confused with an attendance zone, which is within a school district and is used to assign students to schools in a district and not to determine government authority.

==North America==
=== United States ===
In the U.S., most K–12 public schools function as units of local school districts. A school district usually operates several elementary, middle, and high schools. The largest urban and suburban districts operate hundreds of schools. While practice varies significantly by state (and in some cases, within a state), most American school districts operate as independent local governmental units under a grant of authority and within geographic limits created by state law. The executive and legislative power over locally-controlled policies and operations of an independent school district are, in most cases, held by a school district&#x27;s board of education. Depending on state law, members of a local board of education (often referred to informally as a school board) may be elected, appointed by a political office holder, serve ex officio, or a combination of any of these.

An independent school district is a legally separate body corporate and political. Most school districts operate as independent local governmental units with exclusive authority over K–12 public educational operations and policies. The extent of their control is set by state-level law. Litigation against school districts is common and some law firms specialize in education law. Districts typically maintain professional liability insurance in order to pay its settlements and legal liabilities. in most U.S. states, public school districts may lay taxes to fund their operations. In others, such as Maine, some school districts are able to lay taxes and others are not.

Independent school districts often exercise authority over a school system that is separate but similar to a town&#x27;s or a county&#x27;s powers. These include the power to enter contacts, use eminent domain, and to issue binding rules and regulations affecting school policies and operations. The power of school districts to tax and spend is generally more limited. For example, many school districts in New York state require a majority of voters living in the district or the local government to approval their annual budget, but school districts in Virginia have no taxing authority and must depend on another local government (county, city, or town) for funding. A district&#x27;s governing body, usually called a school board, is typically elected by direct popular vote but may be appointed by other governmental officials. The governing body might also be known as a &quot;board of trustees&quot;, &quot;board of education&quot;, &quot;school committee&quot;, etc.. This body usually appoints or hires an experienced public school administrator to function as the district&#x27;s superintendent of schools – a district&#x27;s chief executive. The superintendent oversees daily operations, decisions and implements the policies of the board. The school board may also exercise a quasi-judicial function in serious employee or student discipline matters.

School districts in the Midwest and West tend to cross municipal boundaries, while school districts in New England and the Mid-Atlantic regions tend to adhere to city, township, or county boundaries. school districts were independent governmental units in 26 states, while in 17 states there were mixes of independent school districts and school districts subordinate to other local governments. In nine states there were only school districts subordinate to local governments.

In most Southern states, school systems operate either as an arm of county government or at least share coextensive boundaries with the state&#x27;s counties. A 2010 study by economist William A. Fischel found that &quot;two-thirds of medium-to-large American cities have boundaries that substantially overlap those of a single school district&quot; with substantial regional and state variations in the degree of overlap, &quot;ranging from nearly perfect congruence in New England, New Jersey, and Virginia, to hardly any in Illinois, Texas, and Florida.&quot; Older and more populous municipalities &quot;tend to have boundaries that closely match those of a single school district.&quot; Noting that most modern school districts were formed by consolidating one-room school districts in the first seven decades of the 20th century, Fischel argues that &quot;outside the South, these consolidations were consented to by local voters&quot; who &quot;preferred districts whose boundaries conformed to their everyday interactions rather than formal units of government&quot; and that &quot;[t]he South ended up with county-based school districts because segregation imposed diseconomies of scale on district operations and required larger land-area districts.&quot; 

In New York, most school districts are separate governmental units with the power to levy taxes and incur debt, except for the five cities with a population of over 125,000 (Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, Yonkers, and New York City), where the schools are operated directly by the municipalities.

The Hawaii State Department of Education functions as a single statewide school district, unique among states.

According to a 2021 study, the demographics of voters who elect local school boards in the United States tend to be different from the demographics of the students. This difference is &quot;most pronounced in majority nonwhite jurisdictions and school districts with the largest racial achievement gaps.&quot;

====History====
There were 130,000 school districts in the country in 1930, with an average student population of 150. From 1942 to 1951 the number of school districts declined from 108,579 to 70,452, a decrease of 38,127 or 35%. Many states had passed laws facilitating school district consolidation. In 1951 the majority of the school districts in existence were rural school districts only providing elementary education, and some school districts did not operate schools but instead provided transportation to other schools. The Midwest had a large number of rural school districts.

Previously areas of the Unorganized Borough of Alaska were not served by school districts but instead served by schools directly operated by the Alaska Department of Education and by Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) schools. The state schools were transferred to the Alaska State-Operated School System (SOS) after the Alaska Legislature created it in 1971; that agency was terminated in 1975, with its schools transferred to the newly created Alaska Unorganized Borough School District, which was broken apart into twenty-one school districts the following year.

In the 2022 Census of Governments, the United States Census Bureau enumerated the following numbers of school systems in the United States:
*12,546 school district governments
*571 county-dependent school systems
*227 municipal-dependent school systems
*36 state-dependent school systems
*479 township-dependent school systems

School districts in the US have reduced the number of their employees by 3.3%, or 270,000 between 2008 and 2012, owing to a decline in property tax revenues during and after the Great Recession. By 2016 there were about 13,000 school districts, and the average student population was about 5,000.

====Terminology====

Although these terms can vary slightly between various states and regions, these are typical definitions for school district constitution:

=====Schools=====
* An &quot;elementary&quot; or &quot;primary school&quot; usually includes kindergarten and grades one through five or six. In some school districts, these grades are divided into two schools. &quot;Primary school&quot; is most commonly used for schools housing students in kindergarten through grade two or three in districts where the older elementary students are in intermediate schools (see below).
* A &quot;middle school&quot; usually includes grades six or seven through eight or nine. In some places, the alternative terms &quot;junior high school&quot; or &quot;intermediate school&quot; are still used. &quot;Junior high school&quot; often refers to schools that cover grades seven through nine. &quot;Intermediate school&quot; is also used for schools that cover grades three through five (or so) when they are separated from elementary schools.
* A &quot;high school&quot; usually includes grades nine or ten through twelve and may also include grades seven and eight. Many high schools cover only grades ten to twelve; this type of school is sometimes referred to as a &quot;senior high school&quot;.

=====Districts=====

These terms may not appear in a district&#x27;s name, even though the condition may apply.
* A unified school district includes elementary and secondary (middle school and high school) educational levels.
* The word &quot;central&quot; in a district&#x27;s name indicates that the district is formed from a consolidation (&quot;centralization&quot;) of multiple districts and that the central district&#x27;s operations are centralized relative to those of the previous districts.
* The word &quot;community&quot; in a district&#x27;s name indicates that the district is formed to serve a community of people with common interests and associations and with a community center.
* The word &quot;free&quot; in a district&#x27;s name indicates that no tuition is charged to attend district schools. In New York, it is used in conjunction with the &quot;union&quot; to indicate a district composed of multiple, formerly independent common school districts now &quot;free&quot; of restrictions placed on New York State&#x27;s common school districts.
* The word &quot;union&quot; or &quot;consolidated&quot; in a district&#x27;s name indicates that it was formed from two or more districts.
* In Missouri, most district names include a &quot;C-&quot; or, more commonly, an &quot;R-&quot; followed by a number, commonly in Roman numerals (i.e. &quot;Fox C-6 School District&quot;, &quot;Mehlville R-IX School District&quot;, etc.) Both are used to represent consolidated school districts, but &quot;C-&quot; indicates that the district was consolidated through the consent of voters, while &quot;R-&quot; indicates that the district was consolidated by the state government.
* The word &quot;joint&quot; in a district&#x27;s name indicates that it includes territory from more than one county. By extension, a &quot;joint state&quot; school district, such as Union County–College Corner JSD, includes territory in more than one state.
* The word &quot;independent&quot; can have different meanings, depending on the state.
** Kentucky — Under Kentucky Revised Statutes § 160.020, an &quot;Independent&quot; district is defined as one whose jurisdiction does not cover an entire county. If a county has no independent district, its school district boundaries coincide exactly with its borders. Following the most recent closure of an independent district in 2019, the state has 52 independent school districts along with 120 county districts, with the most significant concentrations of independent districts found in Northern Kentucky and the Eastern Coalfield region. These districts are generally associated with a city, or sometimes with a cluster of adjoining cities. Unlike county districts, independent districts can cross county lines, as in the Caverna Independent School District centered on Cave City and Horse Cave and the Corbin Independent School District. Some districts in the state are independent despite not having &quot;Independent&quot; in their official name, as in the Owensboro Public Schools and Paducah Public Schools.
** Minnesota — Per Minnesota Statute 120A.05, &quot;Independent&quot; denotes any school district validly created and existing as an independent, consolidated, joint independent, county, or a ten or more township district , or under the Education Code.
** Texas — Here, &quot;Independent&quot; denotes that the district is separate from any county- or municipal-level entity. All of the state&#x27;s school districts, with only one exception (Stafford Municipal School District), are independent of any municipal or county control. Moreover, school district boundaries rarely coincide with municipal limits or county lines. Most districts use the term &quot;Independent School District&quot; in their name; in the few cases where the term &quot;Common School District&quot; is used, the district is still an independent governmental entity. An independent school district resulting from a consolidation of two or more independent school districts is called a consolidated independent school district, sometimes abbreviated as &quot;CISD&quot;.
*In Ohio, school districts are classified as either &quot;city&quot; school districts, &quot;exempted village&quot; school districts, or &quot;local&quot; school districts. City and village school districts are exempted from county boards of education, while local school districts remain under county school board supervision. School districts may combine resources to form a fourth type of school district, the joint vocational school district, which focuses on a technical skills-based curriculum.
*In Michigan, there are intermediate school districts (ISD), regional education service districts (RESD), or regional education service agencies (RESA), largely at the county level. The local school districts run the schools and most programs, but often bilingual aides, programs for the deaf and blind, special education for the severely impaired, and career and technical education programs are run by the intermediate school district or equivalent.
*County-wide school districts are most commonly found in Mid-Atlantic and Southern states such as Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Nevada and Utah also have mostly county-wide school districts, and Alaska has many borough-wide school districts. Hawaii operates its schools at the state level through its department of education.
*In Maine, there are regional school units wherein smaller districts were consolidated into RSUs in 2008 when state laws changed.

==Europe==
In England and Wales, school boards were established in 1870, and abolished in 1902, with the county council and county borough councils becoming the local education authorities.

In France, the system of the carte scolaire was dismantled by the beginning of the 2007 school year. More school choice has been given to French students; however, priority is given to those who meet the following criteria:

* students with disabilities
* students on scholarships or special academic merit
* students who meet &quot;social cohesion&quot; criteria (essentially to diversify the school population)
* students who require specialized medical attention from a hospital
* students who want to study a course offered only by the school
* students who have siblings that attend the school
* students who live close to the school

In Germany, schools and teachers are predominately funded by the states of Germany, which also are in control of the overall education policies. On the other hand, school buildings are mostly run and funded by municipal governments on different levels of the municipal system (municipalities proper, districts), depending on the size and specialization of a certain school or the population size of a certain municipality. As with other fields of government, for more specialized schools, special government bodies (&quot;Zweckverband&quot;) can be established, where municipalities, and not voters, are members; these are to a certain degree comparable to a school district. Other arrangements are possible: certain types of special schools in North Rhine-Westphalia are run by the Landschaftsverbände. There also exist private schools, mostly funded by the States, but run by private entities like churches or foundations.

In Italy, school districts were established in 1974 by the &quot;Provvedimenti Delegati sulla scuola&quot; (&quot;Assigned Laws [to the Government] about the school&quot;). Each district must contain a minimum of 10,000 inhabitants. The national government attempted to link the local schools with local society and culture and local governments. The school districts were dissolved in 2003 by the &quot;legge finanziaria&quot; (law about the government budget) in an attempt to trim the national budget.

In the Republic of Ireland, 16 Education and Training Boards (ETBs) administer a minority of secondary schools, a few primary schools, and much further education. (Most schools are neither organized geographically nor publicly managed, although the Department of Education inspects and funds them and pays teachers&#x27; salaries.) Each ETB area comprises one or more local authority areas, with city or county councilors forming the bulk of the ETB board. The ETBs was formed in 2005 by amalgamating Vocational Education Committees established in 1930, also based on local government areas.

==Asia==
In Hong Kong, the Education Bureau divides primary schools into 36 districts, known as school nets, for its Primary One Admission System. Of the 36 districts, districts 34 and 41 in Kowloon and districts 11 and 12 in Hong Kong Island are considered the most prestigious.

In Iranian cities school kids normal registrations are limited by school districts, register is online at my.medu.ir and the parent sees schools within range online.

<text>U.S. Bank Tower, known locally as the Library Tower and formerly as the First Interstate Bank World Center, is a skyscraper in downtown Los Angeles, California. It is, by structural height, the third-tallest building in California, the second-tallest building in Los Angeles, the 24th-tallest in the United States, the third-tallest west of the Mississippi River after the Salesforce Tower and the Wilshire Grand Center, and the 129th-tallest building in the world, after being surpassed by the Wilshire Grand Center. However, the U.S. Bank Tower does surpass both the Salesforce Tower and the Wilshire Grand Center in roof height, making it the only building in California whose roof height exceeds . Because local building codes required all high-rise buildings to have a helipad, it was known as the tallest building in the world with a rooftop heliport from its completion in 1989 to 2010 when the China World Trade Center Tower III opened. It is also the third-tallest building in a major active seismic region; its structure was designed to resist an earthquake of 8.3 on the Richter scale. It consists of 73 stories above ground and two parking levels below ground. Construction began in 1987 with completion in 1989. The building was designed by Henry N. Cobb of the architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners and cost $350 million to build. It is one of the most recognizable buildings in Los Angeles, and often appears in establishing shots for the city in films and television programs.

==Ownership==
U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles was sold to OUE Ltd (OUE), a diversified real estate owner, developer and operator group, in 2013. OUE, a Singapore-listed company run by Indonesian billionaire Stephen Riady, acquired the tower and other related assets for $367.5 million. OUE acquired the 72-floor office building, the adjacent Maguire Gardens park, and a parking lot from a unit of Los Angeles–based real-estate investment trust MPG Office Trust Inc.

On July 20, 2020, it was announced that Larry Silverstein (Silverstein Properties), the developer of the World Trade Center, purchased the building for reportedly 430 million dollars. The deal closed in late September. They held a grand opening in April 2023 after creating a brand new lobby and more food options. The renovations included flexible workspaces, an art installation, and other improvements for the tenants.

==History==
The building was first known and is alternatively known today as the Library Tower, because it was built as part of the $1 billion Los Angeles Central Library redevelopment area, following two disastrous fires at the library in 1986, and its location across the street. The City of Los Angeles sold air rights to the developers of the tower to help pay for the reconstruction of the library. The building was also known for a time as First Interstate Bank World Center but the name Library Tower was restored after First Interstate Bancorp merged with Wells Fargo Bank. In March 2003, the property was leased by U.S. Bancorp and the building was renamed the U.S. Bank Tower.

The tower has a large glass crown at its top that is illuminated at night. On February 28, 2004, two “U.S. Bank” logo signs were installed on the crown, amid controversy for their effect on the aesthetic appearance of the building, much like the previous First Interstate Bank logos were placed on the crown between 1990 and 1998.

===Terrorist target===
On June 16, 2004, the 9/11 Commission reported that the original plan for the September 11 attacks called for the hijacking of ten planes, one of which was to be crashed into the building.

On October 6, 2005, House officials stated that the government had foiled a previously undisclosed second plot to crash a plane into the building in mid-2002. In his televised 2007 State of the Union Address, President George W. Bush asserted that American counterterrorism officials foiled a plot to fly planes into the tower. According to President Bush, Al-Qaeda leader Khaled Sheikh Mohammed&#x27;s plan was to use Asian confederates from Jemaah Islamiyah recruited by Islamic militant Hambali for the hijacking. President Bush asserted the hijackers were going to use shoe bombs to breach the plane&#x27;s cockpit door. Some counter-terrorism experts have expressed doubt that the plot was ever fully developed or likely to occur.

===OUE Skyspace===

In July 2014, OUE Ltd. (OUE), the new owners of the skyscraper, announced construction of an observation deck named OUE Skyspace. on the 69th and 70th floors and a restaurant named 71Above on the 71st floor. The facilities opened on June 24, 2016, following remodeling and construction costing $31 million that included a makeover of the ground floor lobby as well as a separate second floor entrance for tourists, and a skylobby and exhibit hall on the 54th floor. Access to the observation deck cost $25 per person. For an additional $8, visitors could take a trip down a transparent glass slide affixed to the outside of the building between the 70th and 69th floors known as the Skyslide.

OUE Skyspace closed temporarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. On October 26, 2020, it was announced that the closure was permanent. In May 2021, it was announced that a renovation by the new owner of the tower would result in the conversion of the observation deck attraction back to office space and the removal of the slide, due to complaints from office tenants.

===Silverstein Properties===
With the building 78% leased, New York developer Silverstein Properties announced plans in 2021 to make changes to the building to attract tenants. The tourist attraction will be converted to office space or communal areas. The 71Above restaurant will remain open while the 54th floor, where people going higher must change elevators, will be turned into a co-working lounge with workstations, food and beverage options, and a catering kitchen for events.

==Tallest rooftop helipad==
The US Bank Tower was the world&#x27;s tallest building with a rooftop helipad until the China World Trade Center Tower III in Beijing, which was completed in 2010 and whose rooftop helipad is 1,083 feet (330 m) high.

As of March 2018, the world&#x27;s tallest building with a rooftop helipad was the Guangzhou International Finance Center, which also was completed in 2010 and whose rooftop helipad is 1,439 feet (439 m) high.

==In popular culture==

In 1994, the building was featured on &quot;Visiting... with Huell Howser&quot;.

The building is featured in several disaster films, such as &quot;Independence Day&quot;, &quot;The Day After Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;D-War&quot;, &quot;2012&quot; and &quot;San Andreas&quot;.

<doc id="339723" wikidata="Q7234" url="?curid=339723" title="Emperor Cheng of Han">
<text>Emperor Cheng of Han, personal name Liu Ao (劉驁; 51 BC – 17 April 7 BC), was an emperor of the Chinese Han dynasty ruling from 33 until 7 BC. He succeeded his father, Emperor Yuan. Under Emperor Cheng, the Han dynasty continued its growing disintegration as the emperor&#x27;s maternal relatives from the Wang clan increased their grip on the levers of power and on governmental affairs as encouraged by the previous emperor. Corruption and greedy officials continued to plague the government and, as a result, rebellions broke out throughout the country. Emperor Cheng died childless after a reign of 26 years; both of his sons by concubines had died in infancy. One of them starved to death and another was suffocated in prison. The babies and their mothers were killed by the order of Emperor Cheng&#x27;s favorite consort Zhao Hede, with the implied consent of the emperor. He was succeeded by his nephew, Emperor Ai, whose death was followed by Wang Mang&#x27;s rise to power. 

== Birth and career as Crown Prince ==
Emperor Cheng was born circa 51 BC to then-Crown Prince Liu Shi (later Emperor Yuan) and one of his consorts, Consort Wang (later more commonly known as Grand Empress Dowager Wang Zhengjun). He was Emperor Yuan&#x27;s first-born son.

On 17 June 47 BC, Emperor Yuan created him Crown Prince Ao.

Emperor Yuan had two favourite concubines in addition to Empress Wang, Consort Fu and Consort Feng Yuan, each of whom bore him one son. Empress Wang apparently tried to maintain a cordial relationship with both women, and she was largely successful, at least as far as Consort Feng was concerned. However, a struggle between Empress Wang and Consort Fu for their sons&#x27; status as heir to Emperor Yuan did erupt.

As Crown Prince Ao grew older, Emperor Yuan became increasingly unhappy with Ao&#x27;s fitness as imperial heir and increasingly impressed with Consort Fu&#x27;s son, Prince Kang of Dingtao (). Several incidents led to this situation. One incident happened in 35 BC, when Emperor Yuan&#x27;s youngest brother Prince Liu Jing of Zhongshan () died. Emperor Yuan became angry when he felt that the teenage Crown Prince Ao was insufficiently grieving—particularly because Princes Ao and Jing were of similar age and grew up together as playmates—and was showing insufficient respect towards Prince Jing. Prince Ao&#x27;s head of household Shi Dan (), a relative of Emperor Yuan&#x27;s grandmother and a senior official respected by Emperor Yuan, managed to convince Emperor Yuan that Crown Prince Ao was trying to stop Emperor Yuan himself from grieving too much, but the seed of dissatisfaction was sown.

As the princes further grew older, Emperor Yuan and Prince Kang became closer. They shared an affection for, and skills in music, particularly in the playing of drums. Prince Kang also showed high intelligence and diligence, while Crown Prince Ao was known for drinking and womanizing. When Emperor Yuan became seriously ill (c. 35 BC), Consort Fu and Prince Kang were often summoned to his sickbed to attend to him, while Empress Wang and Crown Prince Ao rarely were. During his illness, Emperor Yuan considered whether he should make Prince Kang his heir instead (apparently encouraged by Consort Fu) . Only the intercession of Shi Dan led Emperor Yuan to cease those thoughts. When Emperor Yuan died in 33 BC, Crown Prince Ao ascended the throne (as Emperor Cheng).

== The growing power of the Wang clan ==

After the death of Emperor Yuan and the accession of Emperor Cheng, Empress Wang became empress dowager. Prince Kang, as was customary with imperial princes, was sent to govern his principality in Dingtao (). Despite the attempts by Consort Fu and Prince Kang to gain the throne prior to Emperor Yuan&#x27;s death, Empress Wang and Emperor Cheng did not bear grudges, and, against the advice of officials who were concerned that Prince Kang would become the subject of conspiracies, Emperor Cheng often summoned Prince Kang to the capital Chang&#x27;an for extended visits.

Emperor Cheng trusted of his uncles (Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s brothers) and put them in important roles in the government. In addition to his oldest uncle Wang Feng (), who had inherited his father&#x27;s title as the Marquess of Yangping, six of Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s brothers were created marquesses, in violation of the rule laid by Emperor Gao, the founder of the dynasty, who had decreed that only those who had contributed to the empire in substantial ways could be made marquesses. Wang Feng, Wang Shang () and Wang Gen ()), in addition to Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s cousin Wang Yin (), served successively as the supreme commander of the armed forces and were in effective control of the administration. After Wang Gen, Empress Dowager Wang&#x27;s nephew Wang Mang served in the same role:

* Wang Feng, 33–22 BC
* Wang Yin, 22–15 BC
* Wang Shang, 15–12 BC
* Wang Gen, 12–8 BC
* Wang Mang, 8–7 BC

The Wangs, while not particularly corrupt and apparently some of them were genuinely trying to help the emperor, but many of them were more concerned about increasing their governmental power and did not have the best interests of the empire when they were selecting officials for various position in the government. This led to a continued deterioration in Emperor Cheng&#x27;s administration of the empire, who at times considered modifying this power structure but always failed to do so. For example, in 24 BC, based on suggestions from an official, Wang Zhang (王章, unrelated to the Wang clan), Emperor Cheng considered replacing Wang Feng with the highly regarded official Feng Yewang (), the brother of his father&#x27;s concubine Consort Feng. When Wang Feng realized this, Empress Dowager Wang became upset and, in response, Emperor Cheng executed Wang Zhang and relieved Feng Yewang of his position without any allegation of wrongdoing.

== The need for an heir for Emperor Cheng ==
Emperor Cheng had many favourites among his consorts. His first favourite was Empress Xu (created 31 BC), from the clan of his murdered grandmother, the first wife of Emperor Xuan. He favoured Consort Ban as well. Neither Empress Xu nor Consort Ban bore him a child. He also had a male favorite, Zhang Fang, upon whom he lavished a great deal of wealth. Focused on the need for Emperor Cheng to have a son to be heir, Empress Dowager Wang openly encouraged Emperor Cheng to take on more concubines, but that did not result in the birth of an heir. She also framed Zhang Fang for a crime to exile him from the capital, but the Emperor and his lover maintained contact through letters, and Fang was even further promoted.

In , when Emperor Cheng was visiting Princess Yanga (), he became enamoured with her dancing girl Zhao Feiyan () and her sister Zhao Hede () and made them his concubines, and they became favoured over Empress Xu and Consort Ban. In 18 BC, the Zhao sisters falsely accused Empress Xu and Consort Ban of witchcraft. As a result, Empress Xu was deposed. While Consort Ban was able to successfully plead her case, she did not wish to return to the same environment and instead became a lady in waiting for Empress Dowager Wang. Then Emperor Cheng wanted to make Zhao Feiyan his empress, but Empress Dowager Wang complained about her low birth and prior occupation as a dancing girl. However, she finally gave in to her son&#x27;s wishes in 16 BC, but she never liked the Zhao sisters. Despite this, neither of the Zhao women nor another favourite of Emperor Cheng&#x27;s, Consort Li, bore him a son.

In 9 BC, still without an heir, Emperor Cheng appeared to come to the resolution of making either his younger brother Prince Liu Xing of Zhongshan () or his nephew Prince Liu Xin of Dingtao (定陶王劉欣, son of the late Prince Kang) his heir. Emperor Cheng became convinced that Prince Xin was more capable, and at the same time, Prince Xin&#x27;s grandmother Consort Fu was endearing herself to the Zhaos and Wang Gen with lavish gifts, and so the Zhaos and Wang Gen both praised Prince Xin as well. Emperor Cheng made Prince Xin crown prince in 8 BC.
Emperor Cheng died suddenly in 7 BC, apparently from a stroke (although historians also report the possibility of an overdose of aphrodisiacs given to him by Consort Zhao Hede).

Immediately after his death, there were many rumours that he had in fact had concubines who bore him sons, but that those sons and their mothers were murdered by Consort Zhao Hede (out of jealousy) and she had possibly also murdered Emperor Cheng. Grieving for her husband and apparently fearful of reprisals, Consort Zhao Hede killed herself. Crown Prince Xin ascended the throne as Emperor Ai.

A report by officials commissioned by Empress Dowager Wang concluded in 6 BC that Emperor Cheng did have two sons—one born to Consort Cao in 12 BC and one born to Consort Xu (a relative of the deposed Empress Xu) in 11 BC. However, one of the sons was murdered in their infancy by orders of Consort Zhao Hede, with at least the tacit agreement from Emperor Cheng. Consort Cao was forced to commit suicide after her son was murdered. In response, apparently at the urging of Empress Dowager Wang, Emperor Ai stripped the Zhaos&#x27; relatives of their marquess titles and exiled them; only Empress Zhao Feiyan was spared, although she was forced to commit suicide after Emperor Ai&#x27;s death.

<doc id="339727" wikidata="Q4905951" url="?curid=339727" title="Big Lake National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>Big Lake National Wildlife Refuge is an 11,047-acre (45 km2) National Wildlife Refuge located in Mississippi County, Arkansas, managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is situated east of Manila, Arkansas, and consists mostly of a shallow lake, swamp, and bottomland hardwood forests. The preservation of habitat for waterfowl in an intensely agricultural region is the primary purpose of the refuge. 6,400 acres (20 km2) of Big Lake was named a National Natural Landmark. 2,144 acres (8 km2) are designated as wilderness.

==History==

Prior to the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes, the Little River flowed unimpeded through the flat lowlands adjacent to the Mississippi River in Arkansas and the Missouri Bootheel. The earthquake altered the drainage pattern of the region and created Big Lake. The region was known to the first White settlers as the &quot;Great Swamp&quot; and consisted of hardwood forests, especially bald cypress, wooded swampland, and open water.

After the American Civil War, railroads were built through the region and exploitation of the timber began. The Big Lake area was also popular with hunters because of its abundant waterfowl. Market hunters killed white-tailed deer and ducks and netted largemouth bass and crappie to sell the meat in cities, and hunting clubs acquired large tracts for sport hunting. This created problems with the local residents who depended upon hunting for subsistence. Locals, mostly poor, were shut out of land acquired by hunting clubs and timber companies. The result was the &quot;Big Lake Wars&quot; from the 1870s to 1915, which pitted the locals against the sportsmen and market hunters. Legal disputes as well as fights, shootings, and burnings of clubhouses resulted.

In the early twentieth century, rice cultivation was established in Arkansas and soon the region around Big Lake was crisscrossed with levees and drainage and irrigation ditches, leaving Big Lake as an island in a sea of agricultural cultivation. In 1915, with the wildlife populations seriously in decline and agricultural development increasing, the U.S. government established Big Lake National Wildlife Refuge, the third oldest inland federal wildlife refuge to be created.

The large network of man-made ditches in the Missouri bootheel region drains of former swamp land. The non-natural drainage adversely affects the refuge. Silt from agricultural lands was impacting Big Lake, but in the 1990s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers undertook to divert silt-laden water around the refuge. Water quality has improved and wildlife populations have increased as a result.

==The refuge==
Big Lake averages only three feet (one meter) in depth. The refuge consists of 8,138 acres (21 km2) of open water interspersed with wooded swampland at normal water levels. Most of the remaining land is seasonally flooded. In times of flood, 99 percent of the refuge can be under water. The lake is bordered by a virgin swamp forest of tupelo and bald cypress. The drier parts of the refuge are also forested in hardwoods, including several species of oak, green ash, cottonwood, river birch and red maple.

About 227 species of birds have been identified in the Big Lake area. The refuge hosts wintering and migrating waterfowl, with as many as 200,000 present during the winter. Wood ducks are permanent year-round residents, with about 2,500 chicks born each year. Bald eagles began to nest on the refuge in 1993. Other animals found include the river otter, beaver, raccoon, wild turkey, white-tailed deer, bobcat and occasionally armadillo. The Arkansas record largemouth bass, weighing , was caught in the refuge in 1976.

The refuge is open to the public year round, although it is sometimes closed during floods.

==Adjacent conservation areas==

Bordering the refuge on the north is the contiguous Hornersville Swamp Conservation Area, owned and managed by the Missouri Department of Conservation. It comprises that are also protected and managed for native wildlife. Contiguous with the refuge on the east is the Big Lake Wildlife Management Area, owned by the state of Arkansas. It comprises and is open for hunting deer, waterfowl, and small game. The wildlife management area consists mostly of bottomland hardwood forests. Both areas are subject to flooding.

<text>Sevenoaks is a town in Kent with a population of 29,506, situated south-east of London, England. Also classified as a civil parish, Sevenoaks is served by a commuter main line railway into London; the town is from Charing Cross, the traditional centre of London. It is the principal town of the Sevenoaks district, followed by Swanley and Edenbridge.

A settlement was recorded in the 13th century, when a market was established. Construction of Knole House in the 15th century helped develop the village. Sevenoaks became part of the modern communications network when one of the early turnpikes was opened in the 18th century; the railway was relatively late in reaching it. In the 21st century, it has a large commuting population. The nearby Fort Halstead defence installation was formerly a major local employer. Located to the south-east of the town is Knole Park, within which lies Knole House.

Educational establishments in the town include Trinity School, Knole Academy, and the independent Sevenoaks School.

==Etymology==
In 1100, the name of the settlement was recorded as &quot;Seouenaca&quot; (here the &quot;v&quot; is interchangeable with &quot;u&quot;), in turn derived from the 10th-century Old English &quot;seofon&quot; combined with &quot;ac&quot;: the place of the seven oaks. The original seven oaks were in Knole Park and have been replaced many times.

Alternatively, Baedeker&#x27;s Guide of 1887 states that Sevenoaks &quot;is said to be a corruption of Chevenix&quot;.

==History==

There are few records earlier than the 13th century for the town, when it was given market status. The weekly cattle market was held in Hitchen Hatch Lane until 1999. It was closed to make way for the &quot;160 BT building&quot; in London Road. A food market is held in the centre of town every Saturday. In the Middle Ages, two hospitals were provided by religious orders for the care of old or sick people, especially those going on pilgrimage.

Sevenoaks School, at the south end of High Street, is one of the oldest lay foundations in England. It was founded by William Sevenoke in 1432. Sevenoke, a foundling, had been brought up in the town. In later life he became a merchant and served as alderman, sheriff and Mayor of London. Founding the school and adjacent almshouses was his thanks to the town. In 1560 the school was granted letters patent by Queen Elizabeth I and became known as &quot;Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s Grammar School&quot;.

In 1456, Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, purchased the Knole estate and built Knole House. The mansion dominates the town.

The eponymous oak trees in Knole Park have been replaced several times over the centuries. In 1902, seven oaks were planted on the north side of The Vine cricket ground to commemorate the coronation of King Edward VII. During the Great Storm of 1987, six of those trees were blown down. Their replacements, planted in a ceremony involving well-known people from television shows such as &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and locals such as Gloria Hunniford and Caron Keating, were vandalised, leaving the one mature tree standing. The trees have been replaced and eight oak trees of varying ages line The Vine.

A serious railway accident occurred nearby on 24 August 1927. Southern Railway K class passenger tank engine No. A800 River Cray was derailed hauling a Cannon Street to Deal express, knocking a road bridge and killing 13 passengers. The locomotive crew survived. The entire K class was subsequently rebuilt to prevent such an event from occurring again. The accident called into question the quality of track laying in the area.

== Healthcare ==
A number of institutions provided healthcare in the 19-20th centuries including:

* Sevenoaks Hospital
* Emily Jackson Children&#x27;s Hip Hospital established by Sevenoaks resident Emily Jackson.

==Governance==
Sevenoaks is governed by a town council with sixteen members. The town is divided into six wards: Kippington, Northern, St John&#x27;s, Town, Wildernesse and Eastern. The offices of Sevenoaks District Council are located in the town.

==Geography==
The town is situated at the junction of two main routes from the north before traffic climbs over the Greensand Ridge which crosses Kent from west to east; that situation is similar to Maidstone and Ashford. This road was one of the earliest in the county to be turnpiked in 1709, because of the clay soils.

The valley to the north is that of the River Darent; that river turns to the north to cut through the North Downs. Several lakes are located along the course of the river here, the result of the extraction of sand and gravel in the past.

The built-up area of the town has developed primarily along the main roads. The settlement of Riverhead to the north-west is the largest; other parts of the town (in clockwise order from the north) include Greatness; Wildernesse; St John&#x27;s; Hollybush; Sevenoaks Common; and Kippington.

==Demography==
The 2001 census counts approximately 18,588 residents within the Sevenoaks civil parish authority, compared to its population in 1801 of 2,600. The built-up area of the town had a population of 24,987 at the 2011 census.

==Economy==
Sevenoaks, like much of West Kent, is characterised by high levels of economic activity and a skilled resident workforce. A large proportion of that workforce commutes elsewhere to their places of employment, mostly to central London. Those factors have led to high house prices and pressure on the local area to build more houses. Many of those houses attract high prices, making it difficult for people to buy property. A wide range of middle-class occupations are in short supply locally. Industries such as finance and business services tend to predominate. Transport links are generally very busy and town centre congestion is common at peak times.
The main industrial area is located north of the town, alongside the A225. Sevenoaks Quarry is on Bat and Ball Road, also to the north.

The shopping area in High Street includes the new Bligh&#x27;s development. It is a typical small town centre, with one M&amp;S department store having opened in 2014.

Bligh&#x27;s shopping development opened in phases in 2002. The site was originally a meadow, before becoming a bus station and car park. Access can be gained from several directions including the High Street and London Road. In 2008, a new third side of the development opened, housing a Costa Coffee, a Robert Dyas and Tommelise. Much of the architecture is based on slightly earlier periods but with a contemporary edge.

Music string manufacturer RotoSound is based in Sevenoaks. The company&#x27;s strings have been used by Jimi Hendrix, Brian May, and Pete Townshend. In the US, the company is associated with the &quot;British Invasion&quot; sound of the 1960s and 70s.

==Landmarks==
Knole Park is a 1,000-acre (4 km²) SSSI and medieval deer park containing several thousand trees, a cricket pitch and a golf course running across. In its centre is Knole, the home of the Sackville family (the Earls of Dorset) since it was given to them by Queen Elizabeth I in 1577. The estate is owned and maintained by the National Trust, although the Sackvilles still live there.

Riverhill House and gardens are located directly to the south of Knole Park, on the southern edge of Sevenoaks. The house and gardens, which were first built in the 16th century, are privately owned by Jane Margaret Rogers but are periodically open to the public.

==Religious sites==

There are four churches within the Church of England in Sevenoaks, dedicated to St Luke, St Mary Kippington, St Nicholas (Evangelical), and St John the Baptist (Anglo-Catholic, under the pastoral care of the Bishop of Richborough).
The three churches of St Luke&#x27;s, St Mary Kippington together with St Mary the Virgin Riverhead with Dunton Green make up the West Sevenoaks Team Ministry and are mid-Anglican.

=== St Nicholas Church ===

The historic medieval parish church of Sevenoaks is St Nicholas&#x27; Church. As with many other medieval churches in the area the first written reference to the church is in the Textus Roffensis (about 1120). The current main shape of the church is 13th Century, and rebuilt in the 15th Century.

=== Other Christian denominations ===

The Roman Catholic church is dedicated to St Thomas of Canterbury. Mass has been celebrated on the site since 1880. Additions to the church occurred in 1894, 1927 and 1994.

There are some eight other denominations represented in the town. These include Hope Church (Charismatic); Christ Church Sevenoaks, a constituent church of the United Reformed Church; St John’s Hill United Reformed Church; the Drive Methodist Church, the Vine Evangelical Church (non-denominational); and also the Vine Baptist church.

==Education==

There is one mixed state secondary school, the Knole Academy, which was created in 2009 from an amalgamation of Wildernesse School (for boys) and Bradbourne School (for girls) and four state primary schools, one of which is Church of England and another of which is Catholic.

Lady Boswell&#x27;s C of E Primary School on Plymouth Drive dates back to 1675 and is one of the oldest state primary schools in England. Lady Margaret Boswell left a bequest to educate 12 poor scholars of the town. The first school building was erected on London Road in 1818: it is a Grade II Listed building with a neo-Classical frontage, now called Lady Boswell House. The school moved to its current site in 1972. The school have an association with St Nicholas’s Church and the Rector of St Nicholas is a Foundation Governor.

A Christian &quot;Free School&quot; called Trinity School, opened in the 2010s on the Seal Hollow Road on the north-eastern edge of town, and Seal Hollow Road is also the site of the controversial first new UK Grammar school, an annex of Weald of Kent Grammar School for girls in Tonbridge, in over 50 years. A further annex grammar school, of Tunbridge Wells Grammar School for Boys, is due to open on the same site in September 2021.

Among the high number of independent schools are Sevenoaks School, a co-educational boarding and day school; The Granville School, a girls’ prep school 3-11 (with boys in pre-school); and Walthamstow Hall, an all-girls day school. There are several preparatory schools, including Solefield School, New Beacon School and Sevenoaks Preparatory School.

==Transport==

There are two railway stations in Sevenoaks, with two more on the outskirts:
* Sevenoaks railway station is the town&#x27;s principal station, sited on the South Eastern Main Line. Southeastern operates services between London Charing Cross and , and . It is also the terminus for Thameslink suburban stopping services to London Blackfriars on the Darent Valley Line.
* Bat &amp; Ball lies one stop closer to London on the Darent Valley line, north-east of Sevenoaks. It hosts Thameslink services between London Blackfriars and Sevenoaks.
* Otford lies two stops closer to London on the Darent Valley line, north-east of Sevenoaks. It is served both by Southeastern and Thameslink trains.
* Dunton Green is one stop closer to London on the South Eastern Main Line, north-west of Sevenoaks; it is served by Southeastern trains between London Charing Cross and Sevenoaks.

Sevenoaks is located at the junction of two ancient roads heading south from London and Dartford to the Weald. In 1710, part of one of the roads – from Sevenoaks through Tonbridge and Pembury to Tunbridge Wells – was the first in Kent to be turnpiked; others followed within the century. It became the A21 road in the 1920s; the road now bypasses the town, and also takes traffic to the M25 &quot;London Orbital&quot; motorway at junction 5. The Dartford road is now the A225. The cross-country A25 road passes through the north of the town along the Vale of Holmesdale.

Bus routes in and around Sevenoaks are provided by Go-Coach and Arriva Southern Counties.

==Leisure==
Sevenoaks Wildlife Reserve is to the north of the town centre, around one of the former gravel pits. It is a Site of Special Scientific Interest, covering some 175 acres (71 ha).

Sevenoaks Scouts is the active Scouting organisation in the town.

Sevenoaks Information provides a comprehensive &quot;What&#x27;s On&quot; events diary for the town and surrounding area. 

Sevenoaks Community Forum is a growing, active discussion forum for news and events within Sevenoaks and surrounding areas.

Sevenoaks District Community Directory provides information on local leisure facilities, plus details of clubs, societies and organisations covering all activities across the Sevenoaks area.

==Sport==
Sevenoaks has three non-League football clubs: Corinthian Football Club who play at Gay Dawn Farm, Sevenoaks Town F.C. who play at Greatness Park and Ide Hill F.C. who currently play in Borough Green due to construction of a new club house in Ide Hill village.

The Vine Cricket Ground is one of the oldest cricket venues in England. It was given to the town of Sevenoaks in 1773 by John Frederick Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset (1745–1799) and owner of Knole House. The land was thought previously to have been used as a vineyard for the Archbishops of Canterbury.

Sevenoaks Suns is a women&#x27;s basketball team that plays in the top flight of UK women&#x27;s basketball, the WBBL. In 2017, the team won the WBBL Trophy, defeating the Leicester Riders 82-67 in the final in Glasgow.

Sevenoaks Hockey Club is a large club with a clubhouse at The Vine Pavilion. HC Knole Park is also based in Sevenoaks.

Sevenoaks has two leisure centres; many sports and other activities are available.

Sevenoaks Padel Club has three outdoor Padel courts at Polhill Garden Centre.

==Culture==
The Stag Theatre, cinema and the Plaza music and conference complex is located at the top of London Road (TN13 1ZZ). It was reopened as a community arts centre by Sevenoaks Town Council on 2 January 2009 and is supported by a strong network of volunteers. It became a not-for-profit charity in 2010. The multiplex cinema is open daily showing films. Around £550,000 has invested in equipment, infrastructure and the building since it re-opened.

The demonym for a person from Sevenoaks is &quot;Sennockian&quot;. The demonym &quot;Old Sennockian&quot; is used by alumni of Sevenoaks School.

==Local media==
The local radio station for Sevenoaks is KMFM West Kent, although no local programmes are broadcast on the station due to it being part of the KMFM network across Kent that broadcasts from Medway. The station still receives local adverts, what-on local events and sponsors.

Sevenoaks is served by county wide stations BBC Radio Kent, Heart South, Smooth Radio and many London stations.

Television signals are received from the Crystal Palace TV transmitter because of its proximity to London, placing Sevenoaks in the BBC London and ITV London areas. However, the town can also receive the Bluebell Hill TV transmitter which broadcast BBC South East &amp; ITV Meridian and also through satellite television such as Freesat.

The local paper is the &quot;Sevenoaks&quot; &quot;Chronicle&quot;, which is published every Thursday by the Courier Media Group.

<text>Invasion of the Booty Snatchers is the second studio album by the P-Funk spin off group Parlet. Released in June 1979, it was the final Parlet album to feature Mallia Franklin and the first to feature Janice Evans. The album was produced by George Clinton and Ron Dunbar. The cover art was created by Ronald &quot;Stozo&quot; Edwards. The album&#x27;s highest-charting single was &quot;Riding High&quot;. The album leaned more toward disco, in an effort to keep up with musical trends.

&quot;Invasion of the Booty Snatchers&quot; was re-released in Japan on the Casablanca/Polystar label in 1992 and in Germany on Universal in 2003. On July 30, 2013, Real Gone Music in the U.S. reissued both &quot;Pleasure Principle&quot; and &quot;Invasion of the Booty Snatchers&quot;, featuring liner notes by former P-Funk minister of information Tom Vickers.

<doc id="339730" wikidata="Q1929208" url="?curid=339730" title="Richard Kern">
<text>Richard Kern (born 1954) is an American underground filmmaker, writer and photographer. He first came to prominence as part of the cultural explosion in the East Village of New York City in the 1980s, with erotic and experimental films like &quot;The Right Side of My Brain&quot; and &quot;Fingered&quot;, which featured personalities of the time such as Lydia Lunch, David Wojnarowicz, Sonic Youth, Kembra Pfahler, Karen Finley and Henry Rollins. Like many of the musicians around him, Kern had a deep interest in the aesthetics of extreme sex, violence and perversion and was involved in the Cinema of Transgression movement, a term coined by Nick Zedd.

==Career==
Kern&#x27;s first dabbling in the arts was a series of self-produced magazines that featured art, poetry, photography and fiction by himself and several friends. These hand-stapled and photocopied zines expressed the bleakness of New York City&#x27;s East Village in the early 1980s. Kern&#x27;s first zine was the bi-monthly &quot;The Heroin Addict&quot;, which was later renamed &quot;The Valium Addict&quot;. About 12 issues of these two zines were produced, along with the occasional special issue. This phase of Kern&#x27;s career lasted from late 1979 to around 1983.

In 1985, he directed a video for the Sonic Youth song &quot;Death Valley &#x27;69&quot;; this led to more music video work, including videos for King Missile (&quot;Detachable Penis&quot;) and Marilyn Manson (&quot;Lunchbox&quot;).

Lung Leg starred in several Kern films and was the cover model for Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;EVOL&quot; album (the sleeve design shows a still shot from the film &quot;Submit to Me&quot;). Along with other Cinema of Transgression filmmakers, Kern was a subject of Jack Sargeant&#x27;s book &quot;Deathtripping&quot;.

Kern, whose father was a North Carolina newspaper photographer and editor, turned in the 1990s almost exclusively to still photography. Although mainly known in recent years for his photographs of naked women, he frequently shoots celebrity portraits for international publications.

His book &quot;Action&quot;, edited by Dian Hanson, was released in 2007 by Taschen, featuring more than 200 full-color photographs of young nude women. Accompanying the volume was &quot;Extra Action&quot;, Kern&#x27;s DVD of models featured in the book.

Since February 2007, Kern has directed &quot;Shot By Kern&quot; on VBS.tv, stills of which are published monthly in &quot;Vice&quot;.

He was interviewed in 2011, as part of the documentary &quot;The Advocate for Fagdom&quot; by Angélique Bosio about queercore filmmaker Bruce La Bruce,

After meeting young photographer Petra Collins, Kern purportedly became her lover. Collins also serves as Kern&#x27;s casting agent in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

Kern is a regular contributor to &quot;Vice&quot;, &quot;Purple&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;.

==Influence==
The UK band Manhattan Love Suicides took their name from one of Kern&#x27;s short films.

==Personal life==
Kern was married to artist Martynka Wawrzyniak from 2007 to 2015.

<text>Play Me or Trade Me is the third and final studio album by the P-Funk spin off act Parlet. The album was released by Casablanca Records in May of 1980 and was produced by George Clinton and Ron Dunbar. Like many albums released by the label during this year, it would be totally ignored in terms of promotion due to the label being bought by Polygram Records (now Universal Music). The vocal line up for this album (Jeanette Washington, Janice Evans, and Shirley Hayden) remained the same as the previous album. Play Me or Trade Me failed to enter on the Billboard R&amp;B album charts.

&quot;Play Me or Trade Me&quot; was reissued on CD in Japan on the Casablanca/Polystar label in 1992.

<doc id="339738" wikidata="Q7227654" url="?curid=339738" title="Pond Creek National Wildlife Refuge">
<text>Pond Creek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) is a 27,300 acre (110 km2) national wildlife refuge located in Sevier County, Arkansas. Pond Creek NWR is one of three refuges forming an administrative complex, which also includes Felsenthal NWR and Overflow NWR to the east.

== Habitat and wildlife ==
The refuge consists of nearly 30,000 acres of bottomland hardwood forests and is bordered on the east and west by the Cossatot River and the Little River. Pond Creek’s bottomland hardwood forests are dissected by an intricate system of rivers, sloughs, and oxbow lakes. Because the refuge is situated in an area where the Mississippi and Central flyways overlap, waterfowl species from both flyways can be observed.

== History ==
Pond Creek National Wildlife Refuge (NWR) was established in 1994 under the authority of the Emergency Wetlands Resources Act of 1986. The refuge was originally named &quot;Cossatot&quot;, after the Cossatot River that flows on the refuge’s eastern boundary. By the request of local citizens, the refuge’s name was changed in 1997 to retain the previous name that the area was known by – “Pond Creek Bottoms”.

<text>Crown Heights is a neighborhood in the central portion of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Crown Heights is bounded by Washington Avenue to the west, Atlantic Avenue to the north, Ralph Avenue to the east, and Empire Boulevard/East New York Avenue to the south. It is about wide and long. Neighborhoods bordering Crown Heights include Prospect Heights to the west, Flatbush and Prospect Lefferts Gardens to the south, Brownsville to the east, and Bedford–Stuyvesant to the north.

The main thoroughfare through this neighborhood is Eastern Parkway, a tree-lined boulevard designed by Frederick Law Olmsted in the late-1800s, extending east–west. Earlier, the area was sometimes known as Crow Hill, with a succession of ridges running east and west from Utica Avenue to Washington Avenue, and south to Empire Boulevard and East New York Avenue. When Crown Street was cut through in 1916, the area became known as the heights.

The northern half of Crown Heights is part of Brooklyn Community District 8 and is patrolled by the 77th Precinct of the New York City Police Department (NYPD). The southern half is part of Brooklyn Community District 9 and is patrolled by the 71st Precinct of the NYPD. Crown Heights&#x27;s primary ZIP Codes are 11213, 11216, 11225, 11233, and 11238. Politically, it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 35th, 36th, and 41st Districts.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Although no known physical evidence remains in the Crown Heights vicinity, large portions of what is now called Long Island including present-day Brooklyn were occupied by the Lenape Native Americans. The Lenape lived in communities of bark- or grass-covered wigwams, and in their larger settlements—typically located on high ground adjacent to fresh water, and occupied in the fall, winter, and spring—they fished, harvested shellfish, trapped animals, gathered wild fruits and vegetables, and cultivated corn, tobacco, beans, and other crops.

The first recorded contact between the indigenous people of the New York City region and Europeans was with the Italian explorer Giovanni da Verrazzano in 1524 in the service of France when he anchored at the approximate location where the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge touches down in Brooklyn today. There he was visited by a canoe party of Lenape. The next contact was in 1609 when the explorer Henry Hudson arrived in what is now New York Harbor aboard a Dutch East India Company ship, the &quot;Halve Maen&quot; &quot;(Half Moon)&quot; commissioned by the Dutch Republic.

European habitation in the New York City area began in earnest with the founding of a Dutch fur trading settlement, later called &quot;Nieuw Amsterdam&quot; (New Amsterdam), on the southern tip of Manhattan in 1614. By 1630, Dutch and English colonists started moving into the western end of Long Island. In 1637, Joris Jansen de Rapalje purchased about around Wallabout Bay and over the following two years, director Kieft of the Dutch West India Company purchased title to nearly all the land in what is now Kings County and Queens County from the indigenous inhabitants.

Finally, the areas around present-day Crown Heights saw its first European settlements starting in about 1661/1662 when several men each received, from Governor Peter Stuyvesant and the directors of the Dutch West India Company what was described as &quot;a parcel of free (unoccupied) woodland there&quot; on the condition that they situate their houses &quot;within one of the other concentration, which would suit them best, but not to make a hamlet.&quot;

=== 19th century ===
In the 19th century, the area was rural. The Crow Hill penitentiary and various orphanages were located in the area at the time. In 1884, Alexander Jefferson was killed during a prolonged hanging after being convicted of the Crow Hill Murders. Appeals seeking to overturn his death sentence documented the significant poverty in the area at the time.

=== Early and mid-20th century ===
Crown Heights had begun as a fashionable residential neighborhood, a place for secondary homes in which Manhattan&#x27;s growing bourgeois class could reside. The area benefited by having its rapid transit in a subway configuration, the IRT Eastern Parkway Line (), in contrast to many other Brooklyn neighborhoods, which had elevated lines. Conversion to a commuter town also included tearing down the 19th century Kings County Penitentiary at Carroll Street and Nostrand Avenue.

Beginning in the early 1900s, many upper-class residences, including characteristic brownstone buildings, were erected along Eastern Parkway. Away from the parkway were a mixture of lower middle-class residences. This development peaked in the 1920s. Before World War II Crown Heights was among New York City&#x27;s premier neighborhoods, with tree-lined streets, an array of cultural institutions and parks, and numerous fraternal, social and community organizations.

From the early 1920s through the 1960s, Crown Heights was an overwhelmingly white neighborhood and predominantly Ashkenazi Jewish reflecting the demographics of the city, at the time. In 1950, the neighborhood was 89 percent white, with some 50 to 60 percent, or about 75,000 people, being Jewish and many of them Holocaust survivors and recent arrivals from Displaced Persons Camps in the Allied Zones of Occupation of Germany. However, new arrivals from the West Indies and the American South created a growing Black presence. By 1957, there were about 25,000 Black people in Crown Heights, making up about one-fourth of the population. Around the same time, suburbanization began to rapidly affect Crown Heights and Brooklyn. Robert Moses expanded the borough&#x27;s access to eastern Long Island through expressway construction; by way of the G.I. Bill, many families moved east. As the Jewish, Irish and Italian populations of Crown Heights moved out of the neighborhood as the housing stock deteriorated and crime rapidly escalated, black people from the south and immigrants from the Caribbean continued to move there. The 1957 departure of the Brooklyn Dodgers and the destruction of Ebbets Field for public housing for its Black population symbolically served as the end of the old white ethnic Crown Heights and in the 1960s the neighborhood experienced mass white flight. The demographic change was astounding; in 1960 the neighborhood was 70% white, and by 1970 it was 70% Black. The one exception to this pattern were Lubavitch Hasidic Jews.

There were thirty-four large synagogues in the neighborhood, including the Bobov, Chovevei Torah, and 770 Eastern Parkway, home of the worldwide Lubavitch movement. There were also three prominent Yeshiva elementary schools in the neighborhood, Crown Heights Yeshiva on Crown Street, the Yeshiva of Eastern Parkway, and the Reines Talmud Torah.

===Late 20th century===
The 1960s and 1970s were a time of turbulent race relations in the area: With increasing poverty in the city, racial conflict plagued some of its neighborhoods, including Crown Heights, with its racially and culturally mixed populations. At the request of their leader, the Lubavitcher Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the neighborhood&#x27;s mostly white and relatively large population of Lubavitch Hasidim stayed in the community as other whites were leaving.

In 1964 the Labor Day Carnival celebrating Caribbean culture was moved to the neighborhood when its license to run in Harlem was revoked. It now attracts between one and three million people and is held on the first Monday in September.

During the Lyndon B. Johnson administration, Crown Heights was declared a primary poverty area due to a high unemployment rate, high juvenile and adult crime rate, poor nutrition due to lack of family income, relative absence of job skills and readiness, and a relatively high concentration of elderly residents. Violence broke out several times in the neighborhood during the late 20th century, including during the New York City blackout of 1977: More than 75 area stores were robbed, and thieves used cars to pull up roll-down curtains in front of stores.

In 1991, there was a three-day outbreak known as the Crown Heights Riot, which started between the neighborhood&#x27;s West Indian/African American and Jewish communities. The riots began on August 19, 1991, after Gavin Cato, the son of two Guyanese immigrants, was struck and killed by a car in the motorcade of prominent Hasidic rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson. A mob began to attack a Jewish volunteer ambulance, which withdrew. Rumors, which later proved to be unfounded, circulated that the ambulance refused to treat Gavin Cato&#x27;s injuries while removing members of Schneerson&#x27;s motorcade instead. Yankel Rosenbaum, a visiting rabbinical student from Australia, was killed in the riot, while Jews were assaulted, and there was property damage amid rock throwing in the ensuing riots. The riot unveiled long-simmering tensions between the neighborhood&#x27;s Black and Jewish communities, which impacted the 1993 mayoral race and ultimately led to a successful outreach program between Black and Jewish leaders that somewhat helped improve race relations in the city. Through the 1990s, crime, racial conflict, and violence decreased in the city and urban renewal and gentrification began to take effect including in Crown Heights.

=== Early 21st century ===
In the 2010s, Crown Heights experienced rapid gentrification. In some areas the increasing rents have caused the displacement of long-time residents. Not only did rents for each apartment increase drastically but building management firms such as BCB Realty, affiliated with companies that buy up buildings in the neighborhood, aimed to remove long-term residents by buying them out or pressuring them to move by &quot;failing to adequately maintain apartments&quot;, according to a housing activist, with the aim of forcing out the rent-stabilized. Other tactics include relocating residents from their apartments claiming renovation and locking them out, as employed by another realtor in the neighborhood, ZT Realty. In 2017, real estate developer Isaac Hager faced opposition from activists when he proposed building a 565-unit apartment complex in Crown Heights; in April 2019, a judge issued a restraining order against the project.

In the wake of the 2010 opening of Basil Pizza &amp; Wine Bar, a series of upscale, kosher, foodie restaurants opened in Crown Heights, which &quot;The Jewish Week&quot; described as &quot;an eating destination.&quot;

In November 2013, a series of attacks on Jewish residents were suspected to be part of &quot;knockout games&quot;. Media attention to knockout attacks increased following the incidents in Crown Heights. In response to the violence, the Jewish community hosted an event for African-American teens, designed to promote greater understanding of Jews and their beliefs. The event, hosted by the Jewish Children&#x27;s Museum, was coordinated by local Jewish organizations, public schools, and by the NYPD&#x27;s 71st and 77th precincts.

On January 8, 2024, clashes broke out at the World Headquarters of the Chabad-Lubavitch movement at 770 Eastern Parkway, after a group tried to stop workers who were trying to infill an illegal tunnel excavated by students; the incident resulted in nine arrests.

<text>Pinnation (also called pennation) is the arrangement of feather-like or multi-divided features arising from both sides of a common axis. Pinnation occurs in biological morphology, in crystals, such as some forms of ice or metal crystals, and in patterns of erosion or stream beds.

The term derives from the Latin word &quot;pinna&quot; meaning &quot;feather&quot;, &quot;wing&quot;, or &quot;fin&quot;. A similar concept is &quot;pectination&quot;, which is a comb-like arrangement of parts (arising from one side of an axis only). Pinnation is commonly referred to in contrast to &quot;palmation&quot;, in which the parts or structures radiate out from a common point. The terms &quot;pinnation&quot; and &quot;pennation&quot; are cognate, and although they are sometimes used distinctly, there is no consistent difference in the meaning or usage of the two words.

== Plants ==

Botanically, pinnation is an arrangement of discrete structures (such as leaflets, veins, lobes, branches, or appendages) arising at multiple points along a common axis. For example, once-divided leaf blades having leaflets arranged on both sides of a rachis are pinnately compound leaves. Many palms (notably the feather palms) and most cycads and grevilleas have pinnately divided leaves. Most species of ferns have pinnate or more highly divided fronds, and in ferns, the leaflets or segments are typically referred to as &quot;pinnae&quot; (singular &quot;pinna&quot;). Plants with pinnate leaves are sometimes colloquially called &quot;feather-leaved&quot;. Most of the following definitions are from Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Glossary of Botanical Terms&quot;:

=== Depth of divisions ===
* pinnatifid and pinnatipartite: leaves with pinnate lobes that are not discrete, remaining sufficiently connected to each other that they are not separate leaflets.
* pinnatisect: cut all the way to the midrib or other axis, but with the bases of the pinnae not contracted to form discrete leaflets.
* pinnate-pinnatifid: pinnate, with the pinnae being pinnatifid.

=== Number of divisions ===
* paripinnate: pinnately compound leaves in which leaflets are borne in pairs along the rachis without a single terminal leaflet; also called &quot;even-pinnate&quot;.
* imparipinnate: pinnately compound leaves in which there is a lone terminal leaflet rather than a terminal pair of leaflets; also called &quot;odd-pinnate&quot;.
=== Iteration of divisions ===

* bipinnate: pinnately compound leaves in which the leaflets are themselves pinnately compound; also called &quot;twice-pinnate&quot;.
* tripinnate: pinnately compound leaves in which the leaflets are themselves bipinnate; also called &quot;thrice-pinnate&quot;.
* tetrapinnate: pinnately compound leaves in which the leaflets are themselves tripinnate.
* unipinnate: solitary compound leaf with a row of leaflets arranged along each side of a common rachis.
The term &quot;pinnula&quot; (plural: &quot;pinnulae&quot;) is the Latin diminutive of &quot;pinna&quot; (plural: &quot;pinnae&quot;); either as such or in the Anglicised form: &quot;pinnule&quot;, it is differently defined by various authorities. Some apply it to the leaflets of a pinna, especially the leaflets of bipinnate or tripinnate leaves. Others also or alternatively apply it to second or third order divisions of a bipinnate or tripinnate leaf.
It is the ultimate free division (or leaflet) of a compound leaf, or a pinnate subdivision of a multipinnate leaf.

== Animals ==
In animals, pinnation occurs in various organisms and structures, including:
*Some muscles can be unipinnate or bipinnate muscles.
*The fish &quot;Platax pinnatus&quot; is known as the pinnate spadefish or pinnate batfish.

== Geomorphology ==
Pinnation occurs in certain waterway systems in which all major tributary streams enter the main channels by flowing in one direction at an oblique angle.

<text>Patricia Apollonia Kotero (born August 2, 1959) is an American actress, songwriter, singer, producer, director, podcast host and former model. She is known for co-starring in Prince&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Purple Rain&quot; and for having been the lead singer of the girl group Apollonia 6.

==Early life==
Kotero was born in San Pedro, California, the daughter of immigrants from Mexico, and the eldest of four children. Her father, Victor, was a restaurant manager, and her mother, Socorro, was a caregiver for the elderly. She dropped out of high school at 16 to pursue a career as a model.

==Career==

===Early career===
Kotero worked as an actress, singer, and model. After winning the Miss San Pedro beauty competition, and following her stint as a cheerleader for the Los Angeles Rams in the early 1980s, Kotero began acting in film and television series such as &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Tales of the Gold Monkey&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Matt Houston&quot;, and &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. In September 1982, she appeared in the music video &quot;Shakin&#x27;&quot; by Eddie Money. In May 1984, she appeared in the ABC television film &quot;The Mystic Warrior&quot; as the Native American woman Wicahpi. While dating Van Halen singer David Lee Roth, on and off when they were both in Los Angeles, she auditioned for &quot;Purple Rain&quot;. Roth had followed her modeling career and hired her for a &quot;Star of the Cars&quot; magazine cover.

===Prince and &quot;Purple Rain&quot;===
When then-leader of Vanity 6, Denise &quot;Vanity&quot; Matthews, resigned from its membership before Prince&#x27;s 1984 film &quot;Purple Rain&quot; was filmed, Kotero landed the film&#x27;s female lead role. Vanity 6, which was renamed Apollonia 6 for the film, also featured supporting singers Brenda Bennett and Prince&#x27;s then-girlfriend Susan Moonsie. Apollonia 6 embarked on a worldwide tour to promote their hit single &quot;Sex Shooter&quot;.

Kotero co-wrote &quot;Manic Monday&quot; with Prince, which later became a worldwide hit single for The Bangles. Prince&#x27;s song &quot;Take Me with U&quot; featured vocals by Kotero, with help from Lisa Coleman and Jill Jones, and it reached #25 on the Billboard Top 40 chart in the United States.

In 1985, Kotero left Prince&#x27;s camp to appear on the series &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, playing Apollonia, the girlfriend of the character played by Lorenzo Lamas. She performed several solo songs, including &quot;Red Light Romeo&quot;, written and composed by Jon Lind.

===Later career===

In 1988, Warner Bros. Records released Kotero&#x27;s eponymously titled first solo album, &quot;Apollonia&quot;. Three singles were taken from the album: &quot;Since I Fell for You&quot;, &quot;The Same Dream&quot; and &quot;Mismatch&quot;.

She went on to appear in such films as &quot;Ministry of Vengeance&quot; (1989), &quot;Back To Back&quot; (1990), &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; (1991), and two Italian productions: &quot;La Donna di una Sera&quot; (A Lady for a Night) (1991) and &quot;Cattive Ragazze&quot; (1992). She returned to television on such shows as &quot;Sliders&quot; and &quot;Air America&quot; (which co-starred Lorenzo Lamas, her former co-star in &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;), and also hosted The Jazz Channel&#x27;s &quot;Latin Beat&quot; program. During this period an exercise video entitled &quot;Go For It&quot; was also released. Kotero could also be seen on E!&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Homes&quot;, &quot;The Test&quot;, &quot;Rendezview&quot;, and &quot;MTV Cribs&quot;, with her friend Carmen Electra.

In 2005, Kotero formed a multimedia entertainment company, Kotero Entertainment, which enlisted a number of producers to produce a children&#x27;s animated television series as well as feature films. Kotero Entertainment also began managing young talent such as television and film star Sascha Andres and young pop singer Nikki Barreras, also known as Nikki B.

In 2009, Kotero&#x27;s vocals appeared on The Twilight Singers cover of Prince&#x27;s &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; for &quot;Spin&quot; magazine&#x27;s 25th anniversary tribute to the &quot;Purple Rain&quot; album, entitled &quot;Purplish Rain&quot;.

=== Apollonia Studio 6 ===

In January 2022, Apollonia and her business partner Seth Neblett launched their YouTube podcast Apollonia Studio 6. Over the last two seasons, they&#x27;ve hosted guests such as Jill Jones, Gabriel &quot;Fluffy&quot; Iglesias, JoKoy, Apollonia 6, Tia Carrere, André Cymone, Joe Isgro, Diana-Maria Riva, Susannah Melvoin, DJ Vlad, Amanda Wyss, Anna Fantastic, LeRoy &quot;Roy&quot; Bennett, Autumn Rowe, and Duane Tudahl. The podcast received a Telly Award in 2023.

As of January 2024, the podcast has amassed half a million views and 10 thousand subscribers.

<doc id="339746" wikidata="Q2347548" url="?curid=339746" title="Commandos (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Commandos, also known as the British Commandos, were formed during the Second World War in June 1940, following a request from Winston Churchill, for special forces that could carry out raids against German-occupied Europe. Initially drawn from within the British Army from soldiers who volunteered for the Special Service Brigade, the Commandos&#x27; ranks would eventually be filled by members of all branches of the British Armed Forces and a number of foreign volunteers from German-occupied countries. By the end of the war 25,000 men had passed through the Commando course at Achnacarry. This total includes not only the British volunteers, but volunteers from Greece, France, Belgium, Netherlands, Canada, Norway and Poland. The United States Army Rangers and US Marine Corps Raiders, Portuguese Fuzileiros Portuguese Marine Corps were modelled on the Commandos.

Reaching a wartime strength of over 30 units and four assault brigades, the Commandos served in all theatres of war from the Arctic Circle to Europe and from the Mediterranean and Middle East to South-East Asia. Their operations ranged from small groups of men landing from the sea or by parachute, to a brigade of assault troops spearheading the Allied invasions of Europe and Asia.

After the war most Commando units were disbanded, leaving only the 3 Commando Brigade of the Royal Marines, which is now known as the UK Commando Force. The modern Royal Marine Commandos, Parachute Regiment, Special Air Service, British Army commandos and the Special Boat Service trace their origins to the Commandos. The Second World War Commando legacy also extends to mainland Europe and the United States: the French Commandos Marine; Dutch &quot;Korps Commandotroepen&quot;; Belgian Special Operations Regiment; the Greek 1st Raider–Paratrooper Brigade; the United States Army Rangers and Green Berets were influenced by the wartime Commandos.

==Formation==
The British Commandos were a formation of the British Armed Forces organised for special service in June 1940. After the events leading to the British Expeditionary Force&#x27;s (BEF) evacuation from Dunkirk, after the disastrous Battle of France, Winston Churchill, the British Prime Minister, called for a force to be assembled and equipped to inflict casualties on the Germans and bolster British morale. Churchill told the joint chiefs of staff to propose measures for an offensive against German-occupied Europe, and stated in a minute to General Hastings Ismay on 6 June 1940: &quot;Enterprises must be prepared, with specially-trained troops of the hunter class, who can develop a reign of terror down these coasts, first of all on the &quot;butcher and bolt&quot; policy...&quot; The Chief of the Imperial General Staff at that time was General John Dill and his Military Assistant was Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke. Clarke discussed the matter with Dill at the War Office and prepared a paper for him that proposed the formation of a new force based on the tactics of Boer commandos, &#x27;hit sharp and quick – then run to fight another day&#x27;; they became &#x27;The Commandos&#x27; from then onwards. Dill, aware of Churchill&#x27;s intentions, approved Clarke&#x27;s proposal. The first commando raid, Operation Collar, was conducted on the night of 24/25 June 1940.

The request for volunteers for special service was initially restricted to serving Army soldiers within certain formations still in Britain, and from men of the disbanding divisional Independent Companies originally raised from Territorial Army (TA) divisions who had served in the Norwegian Campaign.

By the autumn of 1940 more than 2,000 men had volunteered and in November 1940 these new units were organised into a Special Service Brigade consisting of four battalions under the command of Brigadier Joseph Charles Haydon. The Special Service Brigade was quickly expanded to 12 units which became known as Commandos. Each Commando had a lieutenant-colonel as the commanding officer and numbered around 450 men (divided into 75-man troops that were further divided into 15-man sections). Technically these men were only on secondment to the Commandos; they retained their own regimental cap badges and remained on the regimental roll for pay. The Commando force came under the operational control of the Combined Operations Headquarters. The man initially selected as the commander of Combined Operations was Admiral Roger Keyes, a veteran of the Gallipoli campaign and the Zeebrugge Raid in the First World War. Keyes resigned in October 1941 and was replaced by Vice Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten. Major-General Robert Laycock was the last Commander of Combined Operations; he took over from Mountbatten in October 1943.

==Organisation==

===Commando units===
The Commando units formed in the United Kingdom were: No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, No. 6, No. 7, No. 8 (Guards), No. 9, No. 10 (Inter-Allied), No. 11 (Scottish), No. 12, No. 14 (Arctic), No. 30, and No. 62 Commando. At the same time four Commando units were formed in the Middle East: No. 50, No. 51, No. 52, and the Middle East Commando. The No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando was formed from volunteers from the occupied territories and enemy aliens. It was the largest Commando unit formed, and contained troops from France, Belgium, Poland, Norway, the Netherlands, and No. 3 (X) Troop. The No. 3 (X) Troop consisted of enemy aliens; it was also known as the English, Jewish, or British troop and was officially renamed the Miscellaneous Troop in 1944. Most of the troop had German, Austrian, or Eastern European backgrounds, while others were political or religious refugees from Nazi Germany.

Some Commandos were designated for different tasks from the start. No. 2 Commando was always intended to be a parachute unit. In June 1940 they began parachute training and were re-designated the 11th Special Air Service (SAS) Battalion, which eventually became the 1st Parachute Battalion. After their re-designation a new No. 2 Commando was formed. Other Commandos were grouped together in a larger formation known as Layforce and sent to the Middle East. The Special Air Service and the Special Boat Squadron were formed from the survivors of Layforce. The men of No. 14 (Arctic) Commando were specially trained for operations in the Arctic Circle and specialised in using small boats and canoes to attack shipping. The joint service unit No. 30 Commando was formed for intelligence gathering. Its members were trained in the recognition of enemy documents, search techniques, safe cracking, prisoner handling, photography, and escape techniques.
No. 62 Commando or the Small Scale Raiding Force was a small 55–man unit under the operational control of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). They carried out raids planned by SOE such as Operation Postmaster on the Spanish island of Fernando Po off the coast of West Africa.

In February 1941 the Commandos were reorganized in accordance with a new war establishment. Each Commando unit now consisted of a Headquarters and six troops (instead of the previous 10). Each troop would comprise three officers and 62 other ranks; this number was set so each troop would fit into two Assault Landing Craft. The new formation also meant that two complete Commando units could be carried in the &#x27;Glen&#x27; type landing ship and one unit in the &#x27;Dutch&#x27; type landing ship. The motor transport issued to each commando consisted of one car for the commanding officer, 12 motorcycles (six with sidecars), two 15 hundredweight (cwt) trucks, and one 3-ton truck. These vehicles were only provided for administration and training and were not intended to accompany the men on operations.

In February 1942 the Royal Marines were tasked to organise Commando units of their own. In total nine Commando units were formed by the Royal Marines: No. 40, No. 41, No. 42, No. 43, No. 44, No. 45, No. 46, No. 47 and the last, No. 48, which was not formed until 1944. In 1943 two other Commando units were formed. The first was the Royal Naval Commandos, who were established to carry out tasks associated with establishing, maintaining, and controlling beachheads during amphibious operations. The other was the Royal Air Force Commandos, who would accompany an invasion force either to make enemy airfields serviceable, or to make new airstrips operational and contribute to their defence.

===1943 reorganization===
In 1943, the formation of the Commando unit was changed. Each Commando now consisted of a small headquarters group, five fighting troops, a heavy weapons troop, and a signals platoon. The fighting troops consisted of 65 men of all ranks divided into two 30–man sections which were subdivided into three 10–man subsections. The heavy weapons troop was made up of 3-inch mortar and Vickers machine gun teams. The Commandos were provided with the motor transport needed to accompany them on operations. Their transport now consisted of the commanding officer&#x27;s car, 15 motorcycles (six with side cars), ten 15 cwt trucks, and three 3-ton trucks. The heavy weapons troop had seven Jeeps and trailers and one Jeep for each of the fighting troops and the headquarters. This gave them enough vehicles of their own to accommodate two fighting troops, the heavy weapons troop, and the Commando Headquarters.

By now the Commandos started to move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into four brigades to spearhead future Allied landing operations. The previous Special Service Brigade Headquarters was replaced by Headquarters Special Services Group under command of Major-General Robert Sturges. Of the remaining 20 Commando units, 17 were used in the formation of the four Special Service brigades. The three remaining Commandos (Nos. 12, 14, and 62) were left out of the brigade structure to concentrate on smaller scale raids. The increased tempo of operations, together with a shortage of volunteers and the need to provide replacements for casualties, forced their disbandment by the end of 1943. The small scale raiding role was then given to the two French troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando.

From 1944 the Operational Holding Commando Headquarters was formed. It was responsible for two sub-units: the Army and Royal Marines Holding Commando Wings. Both units had an establishment of five troops and a heavy weapons troop of fully trained commandos. The men in these troops were to provide individual or complete troop replacements for the Commando units in the field. In December 1944, the four Special Service brigades were re-designated as Commando brigades.

==Training==
When the Commando units were originally formed in 1940, training was the responsibility of the unit commanding officers. Training was hampered by the general shortage of equipment throughout the British Army at this time, as most arms and equipment had been left behind at Dunkirk. In December 1940 a Middle East Commando depot was formed with the responsibility of training and supplying reinforcements for the Commando units in that theatre. In February 1942 the Commando training depot at Achnacarry in the Scottish Highlands was established by Brigadier Charles Haydon under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Charles Vaughan, the Commando depot was responsible for training complete units and individual replacements. The training regime was for the time innovative and physically demanding, and far in advance of normal British Army training. The depot staff were all hand picked, with the ability to outperform any of the volunteers. Training and assessment started immediately on arrival, with the volunteers having to complete an march with all their equipment from the Spean Bridge railway station to the commando depot. When they arrived they were met by Vaughan, who stressed the physical demands of the course and that any man who failed to live up to the requirements would be &#x27;returned to unit&#x27; (RTU).

Exercises were conducted using live ammunition and explosives to make training as realistic as possible. Physical fitness was a prerequisite, with cross country runs and boxing matches to improve fitness. Speed and endurance marches were conducted up and down the nearby mountain ranges and over assault courses that included a zip-line over Loch Arkaig, all while carrying arms and full equipment. Training continued by day and night with river crossings, mountain climbing, weapons training, unarmed combat, map reading, and small boat operations on the syllabus.
Living conditions were primitive in the camp, with trainees housed either under canvas in tents or in Nissen huts and they were responsible for cooking their own meals. Correct military protocols were enforced: Officers were saluted and uniforms had to be clean, with brasses and boots shining on parade. At the end of each course the final exercise was a simulated night beach landing using live ammunition.

Another smaller Commando depot, known as the Commando Mountain and Snow Warfare training camp, was established at Braemar. This camp was run by two famous mountaineers: the depot commander Squadron Leader Frank Smythe and chief instructor Major John Hunt. The depot provided training for operations in Arctic conditions, with instruction in climbing snow-covered mountains, cliff climbing, and small boat and canoe handling. Training was conducted in how to live, fight, and move on foot or on skis in snowy conditions.

A major change in the training programme occurred in 1943. From that point on training concentrated more on the assault infantry role and less on raiding operations. Training now included how to call for fire support from artillery and naval gunfire, and how to obtain tactical air support from the Allied air forces. More emphasis was put on joint training, with two or more Commando units working together in brigades.
By the end of the war 25,000 men had passed through the Commando course at Achnacarry. This total includes not only the British volunteers, but volunteers from Belgium, France, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, and the United States Army Rangers, which were modelled on the Commandos.

===Weapons and equipment===

As a raiding force, the Commandos were not issued the heavy weapons of a normal infantry battalion. The weapons used were the standard British Army small arms of the time; most riflemen carried the Lee–Enfield rifle and section fire support was provided by the Bren light machine gun. The Thompson was the submachine gun of choice, but later in the war the Commandos also used the cheaper and lighter Sten gun. Commando sections were equipped with a higher number of Bren and Thompson guns than a normal British infantry section. The Webley Revolver was initially used as the standard sidearm, but it was eventually replaced by the Colt 45 pistol, which used the same ammunition as the Thompson submachine gun.

Another pistol was the Browning Hi Power chambered in 9 mm Parabellum by the Canadian manufacturer John Inglis and Company. One weapon specifically designed for the Commandos was the De Lisle carbine. Modelled on the Lee–Enfield rifle and fitted with a silencer, it used the same .45 cartridge as the Thompson and was designed to eliminate sentries during Commando raids. Some were used and proved successful on operations, but the nature of the Commando role had changed before they were put into full production, and the order for their purchase was cancelled. The Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife was designed especially for Commandos&#x27; use in hand-to-hand combat, replacing the BC-41 knuckleduster/dagger, although a whole range of clubs and knives were used in the field. Some of the heavier and crew–served weapons used included the Boys anti-tank rifle and the 2-inch mortar for indirect fire support. After 1943, the Projector, Infantry, Anti Tank, known as the PIAT, replaced the now obsolete Boys anti-tank rifle. With the formation of the heavy weapons troops, Commandos were issued the 3-inch mortar and the Vickers machine gun. The issue of the medium Vickers machine gun to Commando units set them apart from typical British Army infantry divisions, who tended to only employ the weapon in specialist machine gun battalions.

Initially the Commandos were indistinguishable from the rest of the British Army and volunteers retained their own regimental head-dress and insignia. No. 2 Commando adopted Scottish head-dress for all ranks and No. 11 (Scottish) Commando wore the Tam O&#x27;Shanter with a black hackle. The official head-dress of the Middle East Commandos was a bush hat with their own knuckleduster cap badge. This badge was modelled on their issue fighting knife (the Mark I trench knife) which had a knuckleduster for a handle. In 1942 the green Commando beret and the Combined Operations tactical recognition flash were adopted.

As the men were equipped for raiding operations and only lightly armed, they did not carry anti-gas protective equipment or large packs, and the standard British steel helmet was replaced by a woollen cap comforter. Instead of heavy ammunition boots they wore lightweight rubber soled gym shoes that allowed them to move silently. All ranks carried a toggle rope, several of which could be linked together to form longer ropes for scaling cliffs or other obstacles. During boat operations an inflatable lifebelt was worn for safety. The Commandos were the first unit to adopt the Bergan rucksack to carry heavy loads of ammunition, explosives, and other demolition equipment. A battle jerkin was produced to wear over battledress and the airborne forces&#x27; camouflaged Denison smock became standard issue for Commando forces later in the war.

==Operations==

The very first Commando raid – Operation Collar on 23 June 1940 – was not actually carried out by a Commando unit, but by one of their predecessors: No.11 Independent Company. The mission, led by Major Ronnie Tod, was an offensive reconnaissance carried out on the French coast south of Boulogne-sur-Mer and Le Touquet. The operation was a limited success; at least two German soldiers were killed whilst the only British injury was a flesh wound suffered by Lieutenant-Colonel Dudley Clarke, who had accompanied the raiders as an observer. A second and similarly inconsequential raid, Operation Ambassador, was made on the German-occupied island of Guernsey on the night of 14 July 1940 by men from H Troop of No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company. One unit landed on the wrong island and another group disembarked from its launch into water so deep that it came over their heads. Intelligence had indicated that there was a large German barracks on the island but the Commandos found only empty buildings. When they returned to the beach heavy seas had forced their launch offshore, and they were forced to swim out to sea to be picked up.

The size of the raiding force depended on the objective. The smallest raid was conducted by two men from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest was the 10,500 man Operation Jubilee. Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight although some, like Operation Gauntlet, were conducted over a number of days. In north west Europe 57 raids were made between 1940 and 1944. Of these 36 were against targets in France. There were 12 raids against Norway, seven raids in the Channel Islands, and single raids were made in Belgium and the Netherlands. The success of the raids varied; Operation Chariot, the raid against dock installations at St Nazaire, has been hailed as the greatest raid of all time, but others, like Operation Aquatint and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of all involved. The smaller raids ended in mid-1944 on the orders of Major-General Robert Laycock, who suggested that they were no longer as effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, something that could be extremely detrimental to Allied plans.

===Norway===
The first Commando raid in Norway, Operation Claymore, was conducted in March 1941 by men of Nos. 3 and 4 Commandos. This was the first large scale raid from the United Kingdom during the war. Their objective was the undefended Norwegian Lofoten Islands. They successfully destroyed the fish-oil factories, petrol dumps, and 11 ships, while capturing 216 Germans, encryption equipment, and codebooks.

In December 1941 there were two raids. The first was Operation Anklet, a raid on the Lofoten Islands by No. 12 Commando on 26 December. The German garrison was in the midst of their Christmas celebrations and was easily overcome; the Commandos re-embarked after two days. Operation Archery was a larger raid at Vågsøy Island. This raid involved men from Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 6 Commandos, a Royal Navy flotilla, and limited air support. The raid caused significant damage to factories, warehouses, and the German garrison, and sank eight ships. After this the Germans increased the garrison in Norway by an extra 30,000 troops, upgraded coastal and inland defences, and sent a number of capital ships to the area.

In September 1942 men from No. 2 Commando took part in Operation Musketoon, a raid against the Glomfjord hydroelectric power plant. The Commandos were landed by submarine and succeeded in blowing up some pipelines, turbines, and tunnels. This effectively destroyed the generating station and the aluminium plant was shut down permanently. One Commando was killed in the raid and another seven were captured while trying to escape. They spent a short time at Colditz Castle before being transferred to Sachsenhausen concentration camp. Shortly after their arrival at Sachsenhausen they were executed. They were the first victims of the secret Commando Order, which mandated the execution of all captured Commandos. The three remaining Commandos managed to reach Sweden and were eventually returned to No. 2 Commando.

In 1943, the Norwegian Troop of No. 10 (Inter-Allied), No. 12, and No. 14 (Arctic) Commandos assisted the Royal Navy in carrying out anti-shipping raids in Norwegian coastal waters. The Commandos provided extra firepower for the navy Motor Torpedo Boats when they were at sea and acted as a guard force when they were at anchor in the Norwegian fjords. In April 1943, seven men of No. 14 (Arctic) Commando took part in a raid on German shipping near Haugesund code named Operation Checkmate. They managed to sink several ships using limpet mines, but were captured and eventually taken to Sachsenhausen and Bergen-Belsen concentration camps, where they were executed.

The Germans responded to the numerous raids directed at Norway by increasing the number of troops stationed there. By 1944 the garrison had risen to 370,000 men. In comparison, a British infantry division in 1944 had an establishment of 18,347 men.

===Channel Islands===
Seven Commando missions were carried out on the Channel Islands. Operation Ambassador, which focused on Guernsey, was the first and largest of these, employing 140 men from No. 3 Commando and No. 11 Independent Company in a night raid on 14 July 1940. Later raids were much smaller; only 12 men of No. 62 Commando took part in Operation Dryad in September 1942, when they captured seven prisoners and located several German codebooks. Operation Branford, a reconnaissance mission that aimed to identify a suitable gun position to support future raids on Alderney, followed only days later. In October of that year 12 men from No.s 12 and 62 Commandos took part in Operation Basalt, a raid on Sark that saw four Germans killed and one taken prisoner.

All the other Channel Islands raids were less successful. In January 1943, Operation Huckabuck, a raid on Herm, was a failure. After three attempts to scale the islands cliffs the Commandos finally reached the top, but there were no signs of any German occupation troops or of the island&#x27;s population. The next raids were Operations Hardtack 28 and Hardtack 7 in December 1943. The Hardtack 28 raid on Jersey ended in failure when two men were killed and one wounded after they walked into a minefield. The exploding mines alerted the German garrison and the Commandos had to abandon the operation. In Hardtack 7 the Commandos had returned to Sark, but had to abandon the operation and return to England when they were unable to scale the island&#x27;s cliffs.

===Mediterranean===
During 1941, the Middle East Commandos and Layforce were tasked to carry out a campaign of harassment and dislocation against enemy forces in the Mediterranean. At the time that Layforce was raised, the British had the ascendency in the theatre, as they had largely defeated the Italians. It was felt that the Commandos could be employed in the capture of the island of Rhodes. However, the arrival of the Afrika Korps in Cyrenaica and the invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece greatly changed the strategic outlook. By the time Layforce arrived in Egypt in March the situation had become dire. The deployment of forces to Greece meant that the Commandos became the only troops in general reserve. As the strategic situation worsened, it became increasingly difficult to employ them in the manner intended, as they were called upon as reinforcements to the rest of the army.

In May 1941 the majority of Layforce were sent as reinforcements to the Battle of Crete. Almost as soon as they landed it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards the south. They were ill-equipped for this type of operation, as they were lacking in indirect fire support weapons such as mortars or artillery; they were armed mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns. By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations, and water, fell back towards Sphakia. In the end, the vast majority of the commandos were left behind on the island, becoming prisoners of war. About 600 of the 800 commandos that had been sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded; only 179 commandos managed to get off the island. In April 1941 men from No. 7 Commando took part in the Bardia raid, but by late July 1941 Layforce had been severely reduced in strength. Reinforcements were unlikely given the circumstances. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, combined with the inability of the high command to fully embrace the Commando concept, had largely served to make the force ineffective. The decision was made to disband Layforce.

In November 1942, No. 1 and No. 6 Commandos formed part of the spearhead for Allied landings in Algeria as part of Operation Torch. Tensions were high between the British and the Vichy French at this time because of a number of clashes like the Attack on Mers-el-Kébir. As a result, the decision was made for the Commandos to be equipped with American weapons and uniforms in an effort to placate the defenders. The Tunisia Campaign followed the Torch landings. No. 1 and No. 6 Commandos were involved in the first battle of Sedjenane between February and March 1943. Both Commando units remained in theatre until April, when the decision was made to withdraw them from the fighting in North Africa. Lacking the administrative support and reinforcements of regular infantry units, the strength of the two units had fallen and they were no longer considered effective.

In May 1943 a Special Service Brigade comprising No. 2, No. 3, No. 40 (RM), and No. 41 (RM) Commandos was sent to the Mediterranean to take part in the Allied invasion of Sicily. The two Royal Marines Commandos were the first into action, landing ahead of the main force. The 2nd Special Service Brigade serving in the Italian campaign was joined in November 1943 by the Belgian and Polish Troops of No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando. The Polish troop captured a German-occupied village on its own when the 2/6th Battalion Queen&#x27;s Regiment failed to reach a rendezvous on time. On 2 April 1945 the whole of the now named 2nd Commando Brigade were engaged in Operation Roast at Comacchio lagoon in north east Italy. This was the first major action of the big spring offensive to push the Germans back across the River Po and out of Italy. After a fierce three-day battle the Commandos succeeded in clearing the spit separating the lagoon from the Adriatic and secured the flank of the 8th Army. This fostered the idea that the main offensive would be along the coast and not though the Argenta Gap. Major Anders Lassen (Special Air Service) and Corporal Thomas Peck Hunter No. 43 (Royal Marine) Commando were each awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for their actions during Operation Roast.

===France===
36 Commando raids were targeted against France between 1940–1944, mostly small affairs involving between 10 and 25 men. Some of the larger raids involved one or more commando units. In March 1942, No. 2 Commando plus demolition experts from seven other Commando units took part in Operation Chariot, also known as the St. Nazaire Raid. The destroyer HMS &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, accompanied by 18 smaller ships, sailed into St. Nazaire where &quot;Campbeltown&quot; was rammed directly into the Normandie dock gates. The Commandos engaged the German forces and destroyed the dock facilities. Eight hours later, delayed-action fuses set off the explosives in the &quot;Campbeltown&quot;, which wrecked the dock gates and killed some 360 Germans and French. A total of 611 soldiers and sailors took part in Chariot; 169 were killed and 200 (most wounded) taken prisoner. Only 242 men returned. Of the 241 Commandos who took part 64 were killed or missing and 109 captured. Lieutenant-Colonel Augustus Charles Newman and Sergeant Thomas Durrant of the Commandos, plus three members of the Royal Navy, were awarded the Victoria Cross. Eighty others received decorations for gallantry.

On 19 August 1942 a major landing took place at the French coastal town of Dieppe. The main force was provided by the 2nd Canadian Infantry Division, supported by No. 3 and No. 4 Commandos. The mission of No. 3 Commando was to neutralize a German coastal battery near Berneval-le-Grand that was in a position to fire upon the landing at Dieppe. The landing craft carrying No. 3 Commando ran into a German coastal convoy. Only a handful of commandos, under the second in command Major Peter Young, landed and scaled the barbed wire laced cliffs. Eventually 18 Commandos reached the perimeter of the battery via Berneval and engaged the target with small arms fire. Although unable to destroy the guns, they prevented the Germans from firing effectively on the main assault by harassing their gun crews with sniper fire. In a subsidiary operation No. 4 Commando landed in force along with the French Troop No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando and 50 United States Army Rangers and destroyed the artillery battery at Varengeville. Most of No. 4 Commando safely returned to England. Captain Patrick Porteous of No. 4 Commando was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions during the raid.

During the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944 two Special Service Brigades were deployed. The 1st Special Service Brigade landed behind the British 3rd Infantry Division on Sword Beach. Their main objective was to fight through to the 6th Airborne Division that had landed overnight and was holding the northern flank and the bridges over the Orne River. The Commandos cleared the town of Ouistreham and headed for the bridges, about away. Arriving at the Pegasus Bridge, the Commandos fought on the left flank of the Orne bridgehead until they were ordered to withdraw. The brigade remained in Normandy for ten weeks, sustaining 1,000 casualties, including the brigade commander, Brigadier Lord Lovat. The all Royal Marines 4th Special Service Brigade was also involved in the Normandy landings. No. 48 Commando landed on the left flank of Juno Beach and No. 41 Commando landed on the right flank of Sword Beach and then assaulted Lion-sur-Mer. No. 48 Commando landed in front of the St. Aubin-sur-Mer strong point and lost forty percent of its men. The last 4th Brigade unit ashore was No. 47 Commando, which landed on Gold Beach near the town of Asnells. Five of the Landing Craft Assault carrying them ashore were sunk by mines and beach obstacles, which resulted in the loss of 76 of their 420 men. These losses delayed their advance to their primary objective, the port of Port-en-Bessin, which they captured the following day.

===Netherlands===
The Battle of the Scheldt started 1 November 1944, with 4th Special Service Brigade assigned to carry out a seaborne assault on the island of Walcheren. The plan was for the island to be attacked from two directions, with the Commandos coming by sea and the Canadian 2nd Division and the 52nd (Lowland) Division attacking across the causeway. No. 4 Commando landed at Flushing and No. 41 and 48 at Westkapelle. No. 47 Commando was held in reserve and landed after No.s 41 and 48. They were to advance past No. 48 Commando and attempt to link up with No. 4 Commando in the south. On the first day No. 41 captured an artillery observation tower at Westkapelle and cleared the rest of the town. They then moved along the coast and dealt with the coastal defence installations.

No. 48 Commando quickly captured a radar station and then advanced on a gun battery south of Westkapelle, which was captured before nightfall.
On 2 November No. 47 Commando advanced through No. 48 Commando to attack a gun battery at Zoutelande. The attack failed, with the unit suffering heavy casualties, including all the rifle troop commanders. The next day No. 47, supported by No. 48 Commando, again attacked the Zoutelande gun battery. This time they managed to continue the advance and link up with No. 4 Commando. The capture of these batteries allowed the navy to start sweeping the channel into Antwerp for mines. On 5 November, No. 41 Commando captured the gun battery north east of Domburg; this left only one battery still under German control. The brigade regrouped and concentrated its assault on the last position. Just before the attack began on 9 November, the 4,000 men in the battery surrendered. This was quickly followed by the surrender of the rest of the island&#x27;s garrison.

===Germany===
In January 1945 the 1st Commando Brigade were involved in Operation Blackcock, where Lance Corporal Henry Harden of the Royal Army Medical Corps, attached to No. 45 (Royal Marine) Commando was awarded the Victoria Cross.

The 1st Commando Brigade next took part in Operation Plunder, the crossing of the Rhine River in March 1945. After a heavy artillery bombardment on the evening of 23 March 1945, the brigade carried out the initial assault under cover of darkness with the 15th (Scottish) Division and the 51st (Highland) Division. The Germans had moved most of their reserve troops to the Ludendorff Bridge at Remagen, which had just been captured by the U.S. 9th Armored Division. The Commandos crossed the Rhine at a point west of Wesel. Their crossing was unopposed and the brigade headed to the outskirts of Wesel. Here they waited until a raid of 200 bombers of the Royal Air Force finished their attack, during which over 1,000 tons of bombs were dropped. Moving into the city just after midnight, the Commandos met resistance from defenders organised around an anti-aircraft division. It was not until 25 March that all resistance ended and the brigade declared the city taken.

===Burma===
During the Burma Campaign in 1944–1945, the 3rd Commando Brigade participated in several coastal landings of the Southern Front offensive. These landings culminated in the battle of Hill 170 at Kangaw. Here Lieutenant George Knowland of No. 1 Commando was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross. The Commandos&#x27; victory in the 36-hour battle for Hill 170 cut off the escape of the 54th Japanese Division. Further amphibious landings by the 25th Indian Infantry Division and the overland advance of the 82nd (West Africa) Division made the Japanese position in the Arakan untenable. A general withdrawal was ordered to avoid the complete destruction of the Twenty-Eighth Japanese Army. The Commando brigade was then withdrawn to India in preparation for Operation Zipper, the planned invasion of Malaya. The Zipper landings were not needed due to the Japanese surrender so the brigade was sent to Hong Kong for policing duties instead.

==Legacy==
At the end of the Second World War, all the British Army, Royal Navy, Royal Air Force, and some Royal Marines Commandos were disbanded. This left only three Royal Marines Commandos and one brigade (with supporting Army elements). As of 2010, the British Commando force is 3 Commando Brigade, which consists of both Royal Marines and British Army components, as well as commando-trained personnel from the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. Other units of the British armed forces, which can trace their origins to the British Commandos of the Second World War, are the Parachute Regiment, the Special Air Service, and the Special Boat Service.

Of the Western nations represented in No. 10 (Inter-Allied) Commando, only Norway did not develop a post-war commando force. The French troops were the predecessors of the Commandos Marine. The Dutch Troops were the predecessors of the &quot;Korps Commandotroepen&quot; and the Belgian Troops were the predecessors of the Immediate Reaction Cell. The 1st Battalion of the United States Army Rangers were also influenced by the British Commandos. Their first volunteers were from troops stationed in Northern Ireland, who were sent to train at the Commando depot at Achnacarry. However, subsequent Ranger battalions were formed and trained independent of British influence.

The men serving with the Commandos were awarded 479 decorations during the war. This includes eight Victoria Crosses awarded to all ranks. Officers were awarded 37 Distinguished Service Orders with nine bars for a second award and 162 Military Crosses with 13 bars. Other ranks were awarded 32 Distinguished Conduct Medals and 218 Military Medals. In 1952 the Commando Memorial was unveiled by the Queen Mother. It is now a Category A listed monument in Scotland, dedicated to the men of the original British Commando Forces raised during Second World War. Situated around a mile from Spean Bridge village, it overlooks the training areas of the Commando Training Depot established in 1942 at Achnacarry Castle.

<text>Gutta-percha is a tree of the genus &quot;Palaquium&quot; in the family Sapotaceae, which is primarily used to create a high-quality latex of the same name. The material is rigid, naturally biologically inert, resilient, electrically nonconductive, and thermoplastic, most commonly sourced from &quot;Palaquium gutta&quot;; it is a polymer of isoprene which forms a rubber-like elastomer.

The word &quot;gutta-percha&quot; comes from the plant&#x27;s name in Malay: translates as &#x27;sticky gum&#x27; and () is the name of a less-sought-after gutta tree. The western term therefore is likely a derivative amalgamation of the original native names.

==Description==
&quot;Palaquium gutta&quot; trees are tall and up to in trunk diameter. The leaves are evergreen, alternate or spirally arranged, simple, entire, long, glossy green above, and often yellow or glaucous below. The flowers are produced in small clusters along the stems, each flower with a white corolla with four to seven (mostly six) acute lobes. The fruit is an ovoid berry, containing one to four seeds; in many species, the fruit is edible.

In Australia, gutta-percha is a common name specifically used for the euphorbiaceous tree &quot;Excoecaria parvifolia&quot;, which yields an aromatic, heavy, dark-brown timber.

==Chemistry==
Chemically, gutta-percha is a polyterpene, a polymer of isoprene, or polyisoprene, specifically (&quot;trans&quot;-1,4-polyisoprene). The cis structure of polyisoprene is the common latex elastomer. While latex rubbers are amorphous in molecular structure, gutta-percha (the trans structure) crystallizes, leading to a more rigid material. It exists in alpha and beta forms, with the alpha form being brittle at room temperature.

==Uses== 
===Historic=== 

Long before gutta-percha was introduced into the Western world, it was used in a less-processed form by the natives of the Malaysian archipelago for making knife handles, walking sticks, and other purposes. The first European to study this material was John Tradescant, who collected it in the far east in 1656. He named this material &quot;Mazer wood&quot;. William Montgomerie, a medical officer in imperial service, introduced gutta-percha into practical use in the West. He was the first to appreciate the potential of this material in medicine, and he was awarded the gold medal by the Royal Society of Arts, London in 1843.

Scientifically classified in 1843, it was found to be a useful natural thermoplastic. In 1851, of gutta-percha was imported into Britain. During the second half of the 19th century, gutta-percha was used for many domestic and industrial purposes, and it became a household word. Gutta-percha was particularly important for the manufacture of underwater telegraph cables. Compared to rubber, it does not degrade in seawater, is not damaged by marine life, and maintains good electrical insulation. These properties, along with its mouldability and flexibility made it ideal for the purpose, with no other material to match it in the 19th century. The use in electrical cables generated a huge demand which led to unsustainable harvesting and collapse of supply.

====Electrical====
Gutta-percha latex is biologically inert, resilient, and is a good electrical insulator with a high dielectric strength.

Michael Faraday discovered its value as an insulator soon after the introduction of the material to Britain in 1843. Allowing this fluid to evaporate and coagulate in the sun produced a latex which could be made flexible again with hot water, but which did not become brittle, unlike rubber prior to the discovery of vulcanization.

By 1845, telegraph wires insulated with gutta-percha were being manufactured in the UK. It served as the insulating material for early undersea telegraph cables, including the first transatlantic telegraph cable. The material was a major constituent of Chatterton&#x27;s compound used as an insulating sealant for telegraph and other electrical cables.

The dielectric constant of dried gutta-percha ranges from 2.56 to 3.01. Resistivity of dried gutta-percha ranges from to . 

Since about 1940, polyethylene has supplanted gutta-percha as an electrical insulator.

====Other====
In the mid-19th century, gutta-percha was used to make furniture, notably by the Gutta Percha Company, established in 1847. Several of these ornate, revival-style pieces were shown at the 1851 Great Exhibition in Hyde Park, London. The company also made a range of utensils.

The &quot;guttie&quot; golf ball (which had a solid gutta-percha core) revolutionized the game. Gutta-percha was used to make &quot;mourning&quot; jewelry, because it was dark in color and could be easily molded into beads or other shapes. Pistol hand grips and rifle shoulder pads were also made from gutta-percha, since it was hard and durable, though it fell into disuse when synthetic plastics such as Bakelite became available.

Gutta-percha was used in canes and walking sticks. In 1856, United States Representative Preston Brooks used a cane made of gutta-percha as a weapon in his attack on Senator Charles Sumner.

In the 1860s, gutta-percha was used to reinforce the soles of football players&#x27; boots before it was banned by The Football Association in the first codified set of rules in 1863.

Gutta-percha was briefly used in bookbinding until the advent of vulcanization.

The wood of many species is also valuable.

===Today===

====Art====
Gutta-percha is used as a resist in silk painting, including some newer forms of batik.

====Dentistry====

The same bioinertness that made it suitable for marine cables also means it does not readily react within the human body. It is used in a variety of surgical devices and during root canal therapy. It is the predominant material used to , or fill, the empty space inside the root of a tooth after it has undergone endodontic therapy. Its physical and chemical properties, including its inertness and biocompatibility, melting point, ductility, and malleability, make it important in endodontics, e.g., as gutta-percha points. Zinc oxide is added to reduce brittleness and improve plasticity. Barium sulfate is added to provide radiopacity so that its presence and location can be verified in dental X-ray images.

== Substitutes ==

Gutta-percha remained an industrial staple well into the 20th century, when it was gradually replaced with superior synthetic materials, such as Bakelite.

A similar and cheaper natural material called &quot;balatá&quot; was often used in gutta-percha&#x27;s place. The two materials are almost identical, and &quot;balatá &quot;is often called &quot;gutta-balatá&quot;.

<text>The ArenaBowl is the championship game of the Arena Football One. Originally hosted at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Civic Arena based on home attendance during the inaugural 1987 season, save four years (2005–2008) the game was hosted by the team with the higher seed based on regular season performance. In 2005–2006 the league staged the game in Las Vegas, and in 2007–2008 New Orleans hosted the event. For the series final two games, regular season home attendance between the competing teams determined which would host.

Originally using year-based nomenclature (&quot;ArenaBowl &#x27;87&quot;), the league would begin consistently referring to the game using roman numerals beginning in 1994 (&quot;ArenaBowl VIII&quot;). The original Arena Football League&#x27;s 2009 bankruptcy liquidation brought the league&#x27;s existence to a close, but ArenaBowl XXIII would be staged in 2010 as the championship game of a new league which assumed the AFL&#x27;s intellectual properties. The final ten games of the series would be staged under the &quot;new&quot; Arena Football League, concluding with ArenaBowl XXXII between the Albany Empire and Philadelphia Soul. The second AFL ultimately had the same fate as the first, ceasing operations after its 2019 season and undergoing Chapter 7 bankruptcy liquidation.

The ArenaBowl was revived in 2024 and was played at a neutral site, the American Dream Mall in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The Foster Trophy was not revived for this game.

==Results==

* Neutral site
* The first seven ArenaBowls were known by the year in which they were played (i.e. ArenaBowl I was called ArenaBowl &#x27;87). ArenaBowl VIII was the first to carry a roman numeral, and all previous games were retconned to have roman numerals as well.
* The number in parentheses indicates the amount of ArenaBowl MVPs that player won.
* The Pittsburgh Gladiators relocated in 1991 to become the Tampa Bay Storm.
* The Nashville Kats relocated in 2002 to become the Georgia Force. The Kats were brought back as an expansion team in 2005 and assumed all former team history up to the point when the original Kats relocated to Georgia. The Force were regarded as a completely separate team and kept records from their establishment in 2002 to the team&#x27;s demise in 2012, similar to the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens situation in the NFL.
* ArenaBowl XXXIII is scheduled to be played in a shopping mall with no permanent seating.

===Most championships won===
===Standings===
*Includes two appearances as Pittsburgh Gladiators (0–2, 42 points, 84 points allowed).

===Coaching records===
*Both Haering and Jackson coached the 1989 Pittsburgh Gladiators, but Jackson is credited with the postseason games.

<doc id="339752" wikidata="Q3219966" url="?curid=339752" title="Layforce">
<text>Layforce was an ad hoc military formation of the British Army consisting of a number of commando units during the Second World War. Formed in February 1941 under the command of Colonel Robert Laycock, after whom the force was named, it consisted of approximately 2,000 men and served in the Middle Eastern theatre of operations. Initially tasked with conducting raiding operations to disrupt Axis lines of communication in the Mediterranean it was planned that they would take part in operations to capture the Greek island of Rhodes.

As the strategic situation in the theatre turned against the Allies, however, the commandos were largely diverted from their original role and were used primarily to reinforce regular troops throughout the Mediterranean theatre. Elements of the force saw action in Bardia, Crete, Syria and Tobruk before they were disbanded in August 1941. Afterwards its personnel either returned to their former units or went on to serve with other special forces units raised in the Middle East.

==Background==
In February 1941, a force of commandos under Colonel Robert Laycock were sent to the Middle East to carry out raids in the eastern Mediterranean. This force became known as &#x27;Layforce&#x27; after their commander and initially they were drawn from &#x27;A&#x27; Troop from No. 3 Commando, No. 7 Commando, No. 8 (Guards) Commando and No. 11 (Scottish) Commando, with additional personnel being drawn from No. 50 Commando and No. 52 Commando upon their arrival in Egypt in March.

Laycock held the rank of a colonel (rather than brigadier) on the staff, because his command was not formally and organisationally a full brigade, with all its supporting elements; although, with a strength of over 2,000 men, it was equivalent. For reasons of security, the commandos were organised into four battalions and were renamed: No. 7 Commando became &#x27;A&#x27; Battalion, No. 8 (Guards) became &#x27;B&#x27; Battalion, No. 11 (Scottish) became &#x27;C&#x27; Battalion, and No. 50 and No. 52 were amalgamated to form &#x27;D&#x27; Battalion. Together they were to operate as a brigade of the British 6th Division, part of Middle East Command. Each battalion was placed under the command of a lieutenant colonel and consisted of: a headquarters; a signals section; a specialist equipment section equipped with a form of collapsible canoe known as a &#x27;folbot&#x27;; and two commando companies with five troops, each troop consisting of 50 men.

==Prelude==
Although upon Layforce&#x27;s formation the commando concept was embryonic, when it embarked from the United Kingdom it had been intended that the force would be employed to carry out a campaign of harassment and dislocation against enemy forces in the Mediterranean. At the time that Layforce was raised, the British were largely in the ascendency in the theatre, having defeated the Italians; and it was felt that the commandos could be employed in the capture of the Greek island of Rhodes as part of Operation Cordite. The arrival of the Afrika Korps in Cyrenaica and the invasions of Yugoslavia and Greece greatly changed the strategic outlook and by the time that Layforce arrived in Egypt in March, the situation had deteriorated. There was still a role for commando-style operations; and, arguably, a series of successful small-scale raids at vital points in the German rear areas might have forced Rommel to divert some of his offensive capability to defend his lines of communications. Circumstances undermined the Layforce concept almost as soon as it became established.
Following the invasions of the Balkans, a large part of the British forces in North Africa were deployed to Greece in an attempt to turn back the German advance. Layforce was not sent, although the three infantry assault ships brought with them from the United Kingdom and which were invaluable in carrying out amphibious operations were taken from them due to a lack of resources in the theatre. This robbed the commandos of one of their most important capabilities; and, although later the &quot;Glengyle&quot; was released to Laycock&#x27;s force, the other two ships were not, which severely constrained the forces that he could deploy. The British loss of air superiority severely hampered their ability to carry out landing operations, while the deployment of forces to Greece meant that the commandos became the only troops in general reserve; and as the strategic situation worsened it became increasingly difficult to employ them in the manner for which it had been intended, as they were called upon to reinforce the rest of the army elsewhere.

==Operations==
===Bardia===
In early April Laycock received orders to begin carrying out raids on the Afrika Korps&#x27; lines of communication along the North African coast. On 12 April they carried out a preliminary move to Alexandria, and three days later they received orders to carry out the Bardia raid and another on Bomba. &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; Battalions were dispatched to attack Bardia, while four Troops from &#x27;B&#x27; Battalion embarked on a destroyer and headed for Bomba. The attacks had to be abandoned, however, due to high seas which would have made disembarking and re-embarking too dangerous.

A few days later it was decided to implement the attack on Bardia. This time, the raiders were drawn from &#x27;A&#x27; Battalion (No. 7 Commando), and embarked upon &quot;Glengyle&quot;. A number of naval support elements were attached, including three Royal Australian Navy destroyers (, , and ) and the anti-aircraft cruiser . Due to concerns about the force being attacked from the air, it was decided that the raid would take place under the cover of darkness; and, as a result, additional assets in the form of the submarine and a detachment from the Folboat Troop (later known as the Special Boat Section) under Roger Courtney were tasked with providing navigational assistance by marking both the anchorage and landing beach.

The raid was carried out on the night of 19/20 April 1941, but things went awry from the beginning. The submarine missed its rendezvous with the landing ship, having been strafed by an Allied aircraft shortly before. Problems with the release gear for the assault craft meant that some of the commando parties were late getting ashore, and another landed at the wrong beach.

The landings went ahead unopposed and the commandos moved to the various objectives that had been identified by intelligence. Little damage was done as a number of the targets proved not to exist or were not where they were thought to be. One party was able to damage a bridge, while another set a tyre dump on fire and blew up the breeches of a number of naval guns. Due to the delays during the landings and the need to depart while it was still dark, time ran out and the commandos were forced to withdraw. On the way back, an officer was shot when he failed to respond correctly when challenged by a sentry; while 67 men, not knowing that there were no assault craft at their beach due to the earlier error, were left behind and later captured.

Despite the lack of tangible success the raid was not a complete failure: the appearance of the commandos forced the Germans to divert the main part of an armoured brigade from Sollum in order to defend against further raids. Although there were still some elements of operational art that had to be refined, the raid demonstrated the strategic value that the commandos might have had within the theatre, if strategic imperatives and resource constraints had not served to derail the concept.

===Crete===

On 6 April 1941 the Germans invaded Greece; less than a month later, on 28 April, the last Allied troops evacuated, having been unable to stop the German advance. On 20 May a German airborne assault on Crete began. The island fell to the Germans on 1 June; however, about a week before that there was still some hope that the tide could be turned. A decision was made to deploy the commandos from Layforce to the island to carry out raids on the German lines of communications with a view to either turning back the invasion or enabling an evacuation to take place.

On 25 May Layforce, consisting mainly of &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;D&#x27; Battalions with a detachment from &#x27;B&#x27; Battalion (&#x27;C&#x27; Battalion (No. 11 (Scottish) Commando) had been sent to reinforce the garrison on Cyprus in case of a German invasion there), departed Alexandria and attempted to land on Crete. They were turned back by bad weather, however, and forced to return to Alexandria where they re-embarked upon the &quot;Abdiel&quot; to make another attempt. On the night of 26/27 May they landed in Suda Bay. Almost as soon as they landed, it was decided that they could not be employed in an offensive role and would instead be used to cover the withdrawal route towards Sphakia to the south. As such, upon landing they were ordered to leave all their heavy equipment, including radios and transport, behind. This was a role that they were poorly equipped for, though, as they were lacking in the indirect-fire-support weapons such as mortars or artillery and were armed only very lightly, mainly with rifles and a few Bren light machine guns.

Nevertheless, by sunrise on 27 May they had taken up a defensive position along the main road that led inland from Sphakia. From then until 31 May, they were engaged in carrying out a number of rearguard actions to enable the main body of troops to be taken off the beaches by the navy. Throughout the entire time they were almost constantly under aerial attack.

On 28 May the defenders began disengaging from the enemy and withdrawing along the pass through the central mountains that separated them from the port of Sphakia in the south. The defence of the pass fell to the Commandos along with two Australian infantry battalions (the 2/7th and 2/8th Battalions) and the 5th New Zealand Brigade. In the first two nights of the evacuation approximately 8,000 men were taken off, while on the third night, 30 May, covered by the Australians and Laycock&#x27;s commandos, the New Zealanders were able to get off too.

For the commandos, the fighting was heaviest on that first day. During the height of the German attack on the pass, G Troop from &#x27;A&#x27; Battalion (No. 7 Commando), under Lieutenant F. Nicholls, carried out a bayonet assault after a force of Germans took up a position on a hill on the Commando&#x27;s left flank, from where they began to enfilade the entire position. Twice the Germans came at them and each time the attack was turned back by stubborn defence. Elsewhere that same day, however, Laycock&#x27;s headquarters was ambushed; and in a rather confused action he and his brigade major, Freddie Graham, commandeered a tank in which they returned to the main body.

By 31 May the evacuation was drawing to a close and the commandos, running low on ammunition, rations and water, fell back towards Sphakia too. Laycock and some of his headquarters, including his intelligence officer Evelyn Waugh, managed to get out on the last ship to depart. The vast majority of the commandos were left behind on the island. Although some of them were later able to make their own way back to Egypt, by the end of the operation about 600 of the 800 commandos sent to Crete were listed as killed, missing, or wounded. Only 23 officers and 156 others managed to get off the island.

===Syria===
On 8 June 1941 the Allies launched Operation Exporter, the invasion of Vichy French controlled Syria and Lebanon. As a part of this operation, &#x27;C&#x27; Battalion No. 11 (Scottish) Commando were tasked with seizing a crossing over the Litani River on 9 June ahead of the Allied advance. Embarking upon the &quot;Glengyle&quot; under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Richard R.N. Pedder (Highland Light Infantry), the plan called for the Commandos to land on the north bank of the river, near Kafr Bada, and attempt to seize the bridge that spanned the river there before the defenders could detonate the explosive charges that were believed to have been placed on the structure.

Upon arriving offshore, the raiding party waited until dawn to take to the water in order to conceal their approach as best as possible. The force was broken up into three detachments with Pedder commanding the centre, the second in command, Major Geoffrey Keyes commanding the right detachment and Captain George More commanding the left detachment. Although the landing was unopposed, the southern detachment under Keyes soon discovered that they had been put ashore by mistake on the wrong side of the river. As Pedder&#x27;s detachment advanced on the target, the French colonial troops from the 22nd Algerian Tirailleurs that were defending the area opened fire and in the ensuing engagement Pedder was killed and a number of other officers in the centre detachment were wounded. Nevertheless, the detachment pressed on and, under the command of the Regimental Sergeant Major, they succeeded in securing one of the barracks buildings near the redoubt that formed the key to defence of the position. At the same time the left detachment under More captured a number of howitzers and field guns, as well as a number of prisoners, but as the initial surprise of the attack wore off, the defenders were able to organise themselves. The fighting became more intense, and as the French brought up mortars and artillery, a stalemate developed.

While this was going on, the right detachment under Keyes, having found itself on the wrong side of the river, made contact with the Australian 2/16th Battalion to the south which brought up a boat with which they could make a crossing. Due to the size of the boat, it had to make a number of trips before the detachment was on the northern side. Once that was complete Keyes was able to take command of the unit. After carrying out a reorganisation, he was able to launch an assault on the redoubt and by 13:00 they had captured it and secured the crossing. This allowed C Company of the 2/16th Battalion to cross in force and Keyes handed control of the redoubt over to its commander at 19:00.

Of the 406 men that landed, 130 were killed or wounded, including the commanding officer, in nearly 29 hours of fighting. Despite being outnumbered, and short on ammunition and food, they held their position long enough for the Australians to cross the river and continue with their advance to Beirut. A short time later, No. 11 Commando returned to garrison duty on Cyprus.

===Tobruk===
Following their involvement in the rearguard actions on Crete, a detachment of five officers and 70 other ranks from No. 8 Commando were sent to Tobruk, which was at the time under siege. In June, as the Eighth Army launched Operation Battleaxe in an attempt to relieve the garrison from the east, it was decided that the commandos would carry out a raid on an Italian position that was dominating the forward positions of the Indian 18th Cavalry. The position, which was known as the Twin Pimples, consisted of two small hills that sat close together and from where the Italians were able to observe the Allied lines. For a number of days prior to carrying out the raid, the commandos carried out patrols with the Indians to become familiar with the ground and to practise moving over the terrain at night. Finally on the night of 17/18 July they attacked.

It was a raid that was typical of what the men had been trained for, but which they had rarely been able to conduct since arriving in the Middle East. It proved to be highly successful, being well-planned and executed, with a carefully laid deception plan. Under the cover of darkness the commandos managed to sneak up behind the hills, moving thorough the Italian forward positions unchallenged. In the end they advanced to within 30 yards before they were challenged, and when they finally were, the force rushed the Italian defenders and quickly overwhelmed them. They then withdrew from the position just before the defenders called in an artillery barrage on the position and returned to the garrison holding Tobruk. They suffered five casualties in the raid, one of whom later died of his wounds.

==Disbandment==
By late July 1941 the operations that Layforce had undertaken had severely reduced its strength and under the circumstances reinforcements were unlikely. The operational difficulties that had been exposed during the Bardia raid, the changing strategic imperatives of the situation in the Middle East, and the failure of the high command to fully embrace the commando concept had largely served to make the force ineffective. As a result, the decision was made to disband Layforce. Many of the men went back to their previous regiments following the decision, while others chose to remain in the Middle East and subsequently joined other special forces units that were raised later.

Laycock travelled to London to discuss with the War Office his concerns about the way in which his force had been treated. Upon hearing about its disbandment later, British prime minister Sir Winston Churchill—a great advocate for the commandos—ordered the formation of the Middle East Commando, made up from the commandos that had remained in the theatre. When Laycock returned from England he found that, although the Middle East Commando had indeed been set up, there were very few men for him to command. What men there were, were formed into six troops. The embryonic Special Air Service, then known as L Detachment, were designated Nos. 1 and 2 Troops, while 60 men from the disbanded No. 11 (Scottish) Commando made up No. 3 Troop. The men of No. 51 Commando formed Nos. 4 and 5 Troops, and the Special Boat Section made up No. 6 Troop, under Roger Courtney. These designations, however, were largely ignored as the men referred to themselves by their old designations.

In November, as part of Operation Crusader, an offensive aimed at relieving the besieged garrison at Tobruk, No. 3 Troop of Middle East Commando was involved in Operation Flipper, an attempt to raid Erwin Rommel&#x27;s headquarters in Libya and kill the German commander. The raid was part of a larger operation involving Stirling&#x27;s L Detachment and the SBS to penetrate behind the German lines and cause disruption in the rear areas in order to assist in the general offensive. In the end, however, the raid failed and only two men—one of whom was Laycock himself—managed to return to British lines. The commander, Lt. Col. Geoffrey Keyes, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery during the raid.

Although the Middle East Commando remained in existence after this—largely in an effort to placate Churchill—its personnel were mainly absorbed into larger formations. Many of these men joined the Special Air Service, which was expanded by Stirling with Churchill&#x27;s approval. Laycock was promoted to brigadier and put in charge of the Special Service Brigade, Middle East Command, replacing Brigadier Charles Haydon.

<doc id="339755" wikidata="Q757148" url="?curid=339755" title="Rocko's Modern Life">
<text>Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life is an American comedy animated television series created by Joe Murray for Nickelodeon. The series centers on the surreal life of an anthropomorphic Australian immigrant wallaby named Rocko and his friends: the eccentric steer Heffer Wolfe, the neurotic turtle Filburt, and Rocko&#x27;s faithful dog Spunky. It is set in the fictional town of O-Town. Throughout its run to present day, the series has been controversial for its adult humor, including double entendre, innuendo, and satirical social commentary, and gained a cult following, similar to &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;.

Murray created the title character for an unpublished comic book series in the late 1980s, and later reluctantly pitched the series to Nickelodeon, which was looking for edgier cartoonists for its then-new Nicktoons. The network gave the staff a large amount of creative freedom, with the writers targeting both children and adults. The show premiered on September 18, 1993, and ended on November 24, 1996, totaling four seasons and 52 episodes. A special, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: Static Cling&quot;, was digitally released on Netflix on August 9, 2019.

The show launched the careers of voice actors Carlos Alazraqui, Tom Kenny, and Mr. Lawrence. After the series ended its run, much of the staff regrouped to work on &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, created by &quot;Rocko&quot;″s creative director Stephen Hillenburg.

==Premise==
===Characters===

&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; follows the life of an easily frightened Australian immigrant wallaby named Rocko who encounters various dilemmas and situations regarding otherwise mundane aspects of life. His best friends are Heffer Wolfe, a fat and enthusiastic steer; Filburt, a neurotic turtle who often feels awkward or disturbed and his faithful dog Spunky. Living next door to Rocko is a middle-aged couple, Ed Bighead, a cynical and cantankerous toad who despises Rocko, and his compassionate and more friendly wife Bev Bighead.

All of the characters in &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; are anthropomorphic animals of varying species and varying in size, the vast majority of whom are mentally unstable. Murray said that he matched personalities of his characters to the various animals in the series to form a social caricature.

===Setting===
The show is set in a fictional town called O-Town located near the Great Lakes and most likely based on Chicago, Illinois, as the city is located close to the Illinois-Wisconsin border. Places in the town include: Chokey Chicken, later renamed &quot;Chewy Chicken&quot;, a parody of KFC and a favorite place/hang-out for Rocko, Heffer, and Filburt; Conglom-O Corporation, a megacorporation with the slogan &quot;We own you&quot; that owns everything in town; Heck, a place of eternal torment run by Peaches where bad people go when they die; Holl-o-Wood, a town that resembles Hollywood; and Kind of a Lot O&#x27; Comics, a comic book store owned by a cruel toad named Mr. Smitty, where Rocko works.

Many of the locations in &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; have the letter &quot;O&quot; in them; for example, O-Town and Conglom-O Corporation. When asked about the use of &quot;O&quot; in his show, Murray said:
==Episodes==

==Production==
===Development===

Originally, the character appeared in an unpublished comic book titled &quot;Travis&quot;. Murray tried selling the comic book in the late 1980s, between illustrating jobs and did not find success in getting it into production. Many other characters appeared in various sketchbooks. He described the early 1990s animation atmosphere as &quot;ripe for this kind of project. We took some chances that would be hard to do in these current times (the 1990s)&quot;. Murray wanted funding for his independent film &quot;My Dog Zero&quot;, so he wanted Nickelodeon to pre-buy television rights for the series. He presented a pencil test to Nickelodeon, which afterward became interested in buying and financing the show. Murray had never worked in television before. The industry was coming out of a &quot;rough period&quot; and Murray wanted to &quot;shake things up a bit&quot;.

Linda Simensky, then in charge of animation development in Nickelodeon, described the Nicktoons lineup and concept to Murray. He originally felt skepticism towards the concept of creating a Nicktoon as he disliked television cartoons. Simensky told him that Nicktoons differed from other cartoons. He then told her that he believed that &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; would not work as a cartoon. He then researched Nickelodeon at the library and found that Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;attitude was different than regular TV&quot;. The cable network providers were &quot;making their own rules&quot;: for example, Murray stated that he &quot;didn&#x27;t write for children&quot;, which the executives were fine with.

Murray was unsure at first, but was inspired by independent animation around him, such as Animation Celebration and MTV&#x27;s &quot;Liquid Television&quot;, and gave the network a shot. At the time, Nickelodeon was selling itself as a network-based as much around the edge as around kids&#x27; entertainment. It aimed to appeal to college students and parents as much as children.

Murray developed the Rocko character after visiting a zoo in the Bay Area and coming across a wallaby that seemed to be oblivious to the chaos around him. Murray combed through his sketchbooks, developed the &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; concept, and submitted it to Nickelodeon believing that the concept would likely be rejected. Murray felt they would not like the pilot, and he would just collect his sum and begin funding his next independent film. According to Murray, around three or four months later he had &quot;forgotten about&quot; the concept and was working on &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; when Simensky informed him that Nickelodeon wanted a pilot episode. Murray said that he was glad that he would get funding for &quot;My Dog Zero&quot;. On his website he describes &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; as &quot;that film that Linda Simensky saw which led me to &quot;Rocko&quot;.&quot; &quot;Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic&quot; was originally written as the pilot; the executives decided that Heffer Wolfe, one of the characters, would be &quot;a little too weird for test audiences&quot;. Murray, instead of removing Heffer from &quot;Sucker for the Suck-O-Matic&quot;, decided to write &quot;Trash-O-Madness&quot; as the pilot episode.

In the original series pilot, Rocko was colored yellow. His color was changed when a toy merchandising company informed Nick they were interested in marketing toys but did not want to market Rocko because &quot;the color was too close to another major cartoon character that they were making a lot of money off of&quot;. Murray changed Rocko&#x27;s color to beige, but after the pilot aired, the company opted out of producing toys for the series, so the color change was pointless. When the series was in development prior to the release of the first episode, the series had the title &quot;The Rocko Show&quot;.

In November 1992, two months prior to the production of season 1 of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, Murray&#x27;s first wife committed suicide. Murray had often blamed his wife&#x27;s suicide on the show being picked up. He said, &quot;It was always an awful connection because I look at &quot;Rocko&quot; as such a positive in my life&quot;. Murray felt that he had emotional and physical &quot;unresolved issues&quot; when he moved to Los Angeles. He describes the experience as like participating in a &quot;marathon with my pants around my ankles&quot;. Murray initially believed that he would create one season, move back to the San Francisco Bay Area, and &quot;clean up the loose ends I had left hanging&quot;. Murray said that he felt surprised when Nickelodeon approved new seasons; Nickelodeon renewed the series for its second season in December 1993.

After season 3, he decided to hand the project to Stephen Hillenburg, who performed most of the work for season 4; Murray continued to manage the cartoon. He said that he would completely leave the production after season 4. He said also that he encouraged the network to continue production, but Nickelodeon eventually decided to cancel the series. It is unclear why it was cancelled, but was likely to suit the wholesome image Nickelodeon was beginning to promote at the time. He described all 52 episodes as &quot;top notch&quot;, and in his view the quality of a television show may decline as production continues &quot;when you are dealing with volume&quot;. On his website he said that &quot;In some ways it succeeded and in some ways failed. All I know it developed its own flavor and an equally original legion of fans.&quot; In a 1997 interview Murray said that he at times wondered if he could restart the series; he feels the task would be difficult.

The show was jointly produced between Games Animation and Joe Murray Productions. Since Nickelodeon did not have an animation studio, it had to contract out to other studios. After incidents with &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; creator John Kricfalusi, Nickelodeon began not to trust its creators as much and began to form its own studio, Games Animation. Murray recalls that they were still able to get a lot done independently. Murray has likened the independence to that of &quot;Termite Terrace&quot; (Warner Bros. Cartoons) from the 1930s. As Nickelodeon began to have more success with its animation cartoons, Murray said the &quot;Termite Terrace&quot; mentality was not working as much. Producer Mary Harrington made the move from New York City to Los Angeles to set up Games Animation, in order to produce &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;. The crew first began production on the show in January 1993. &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; was Nickelodeon&#x27;s first in-house animated production.

Murray&#x27;s Joe Murray Productions and Games Animation rented office space on Ventura Boulevard in the Studio City neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California. The production moved to a different office building on Vineland Avenue in Studio City. Executives did not share space with the creative team. Murray rented a floor in the Writers Guild of America, West building, although the team of Rocko was not a part of the union, which the staff found ironic. Sunwoo Entertainment, and later Rough Draft Studios, assembled the animation.

According to Murray, as &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; was his first television series, he did not know about the atmosphere of typical animation studios. Murray said that he opted to operate his studio in a similar manner to the operation of his Saratoga, California studio, which he describes as &quot;very relaxed&quot;. His cadre included many veterans who, according to him, described the experience as &quot;the most fun they had ever had!&quot; He, saying that the atmosphere was &quot;not my doing&quot;, credited his team members for collectively contributing. Murray described the daily atmosphere at the studio as &quot;very loose&quot;, adding that the rules permitted all staff members to use the paging system to make announcements. He stated that one visitor compared the environment of the production studio to &quot;preschool without supervision&quot;. Murray stated that 70 people in the United States and over 200 people in South Korea and Japan animated the series.

Rick Bentley of the &quot;Ventura County Star&quot; said that it was unusual for a cartoon creator to select a wallaby as a main character. Bentley also stated that the Rocko universe was influenced by &quot;everything from Looney Tunes to underground comics&quot;. The staff of the show consists of fans of outrageous comedy, both animated and not animated. Tom Kenny cited &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;SCTV&quot; as influences for the show, and also stated &quot;I&#x27;m sure if you asked Joe Murray or Mr. Lawrence or any of those guys, especially in terms of animation, the weirdest cartoons would, of course, be our favorites—those weird &#x27;30s Fleischer brothers &quot;Betty Boop&quot; cartoons and stuff like that.&quot;

Murray produced the pilot episode, &quot;Trash-O-Madness&quot;, at his studio in Saratoga; he animated half of the episode, and the production occurred entirely in the United States, with animation in Saratoga and processing in San Francisco. While directing during recording sessions, Murray preferred to be on the stage with the actors instead of &quot;behind glass&quot; in a control room, which he describes as &quot;the norm&quot; while making animated series. He believes that, due to his lack of experience with children, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; &quot;skewed kind of older&quot;. Murray noted, &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of big kids out there. People went to see &quot;Roger Rabbit&quot; and saw all these characters they&#x27;d grown up with and said, &#x27;Yeah, why don&#x27;t they have something like that anymore?&#x27;&quot;

When he began producing &quot;Rocko&quot;, he says that his experience in independent films initially led him to attempt to micromanage many details in the production. He said that the approach, when used for production of television shows, was &quot;driving me crazy&quot;. This led him to allow other team members to manage aspects of the &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; production. Director and later creative director Stephen Hillenburg met Murray at an animation film festival where he was showing his three short films. Murray hired Hillenburg as a director on the series, making Hillenburg&#x27;s first job in the animation business as a director.

Murray designed the logo of the series. He said that, after his design drifted from the original design, Nickelodeon informed Murray of how it intended the logo to look like. Murray also designed the covers of the comic book, the VHS releases, and the DVD releases.

===Writing===
The writers aimed to create stories that they describe as &quot;strong&quot; and &quot;funny&quot;. The writers, including George Maestri and Martin Olson, often presented ideas to Murray while eating hamburgers at Rocky&#x27;s, a restaurant formerly located on Lankershim in the North Hollywood section of the San Fernando Valley. He took his team members on &quot;writing trips&quot; to places such as Rocky&#x27;s, the La Brea Tar Pits, and the wilderness. If he liked the story premises, the writers produced full outlines from the premises. Outlines approved by both him and Nickelodeon became &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; episodes. Maestri describes some stories as originating from &quot;real life&quot; and some originating from &quot;thin air&quot;.

Murray stated that each episode of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; stemmed from the personal experiences of himself and/or one or more of the directors or writers. He said that he did not intend to use formulaic writing seen in other cartoons. He desired content that &quot;broke new ground&quot; and &quot;did things that rode the edge&quot;, and that could be described as &quot;unexpected&quot;. He did not hire writers who had previous experience with writing cartoons, instead, hiring writers who worked outside of animation, including improv actors and comic artists. He said that story concept that &quot;ever smacked close to some formula idea that we had all seen before&quot; received the immediate rejection.

Jeff &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh, a storyboard writer who went on to create &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, says that writers of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; targeted children and adults. He cites &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle&quot; as an example of another series that contains references indecipherable by children and understood by adults. Aiming for a similar goal, Marsh described the process as &quot;a hard job&quot;. According to him, when censors questioned proposed material, sometimes the team disagreed with the opinions of the censors and sometimes the team agreed with the rationale of the censors. He says that &quot;many people&quot; told him that the team &quot;succeeded in this endeavor&quot; and that &quot;many parents I know really enjoyed watching the show with their kids for just this reason&quot;.

John Pacenti said the series &quot;seems very much aimed at adults&quot; &quot;for a children&#x27;s cartoon&quot;. Marsh believes that the material written by Doug Lawrence stands as an example of a &quot;unique sense of humor&quot;. For instance, Marsh credits Lawrence with the &quot;pineapple references&quot; adding that Lawrence believed that pineapples seemed humorous. The staff drew upon &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and the Fleischer cartoons to appeal to a wide demographic: having a certain adult sensibility but also enjoyed by kids.

===Animation===
&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; has been described as similar to that of the output of Warner Bros. cartoons in the Golden Age: a visually driven show heavy on humor, sight gags, and good animation. Instead of a finished script, the animators usually received a three-page outline, requiring them to come up with a majority of the gags and dialogue. The animation team appreciated this approach, with storyboard artist Jeff Myers, formerly of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, quoted as saying &quot;The script [at &quot;The Simpsons&quot;] was carved in stone. Here it&#x27;s ... more of a challenge and a lot more fun when we&#x27;re given a rough outline.&quot; Murray&#x27;s animation lacked parallel lines and featured crooked architecture similar to various Chuck Jones cartoons. In an interview, he stated that his design style contributed to the show&#x27;s &quot;wonky bent feel&quot;.

Jean Prescott of the &quot;Sun Herald&quot; described the series as &quot;squash-and-stretch&quot;. A 1993 &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article described the series&#x27; setting as having a &quot;reality that is &#x27;squashed and stretched&#x27; into a twisted version of real life&quot;. The background staff hand-painted backgrounds with Dr. Martin Dyes, while each episode title card consisted of an original painting. Linda Simensky said that she asked the creators of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; about why the women in the series were drawn to be &quot;top-heavy&quot;, the creators told her that they believed that drawing women &quot;the traditional way&quot; was easier. Simensky described the creators as &quot;talented guys&quot; who formed &quot;a boy&#x27;s club&quot; and added that &quot;we pushed them to be funny, but a lot of their women are stereotypical&quot;.

===Music===
There are three versions of the &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; theme song. The first and original version can be heard playing throughout every episode in Season 1 excluding episode 8. The second version of the theme song was a slightly remixed version of the first and was used only for episode 8. Version 2 had high-pitched, distorted voices in the chorus. The third version of the theme song was performed by Kate Pierson and Fred Schneider from the B-52s, which remained intact for the rest of the series.

Originally, Murray wanted Paul Sumares to perform the theme song since Sumares created most of the music found in &quot;My Dog Zero&quot;, and also wanted the same style in &quot;My Dog Zero&quot; exhibited in &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;. However, Nickelodeon wanted a person with more experience. According to Sumares, believing for the request to be a long shot, Murray asked for Danny Elfman and felt stunned when Nickelodeon decided to honor his request by asking Elfman to perform. According to Murray, Elfman, his first choice, was booked. Therefore, he chose the B-52s, his second choice.

According to Sumares, Murray decided to use the B-52s instead of Elfman, and stated that the difference between the stories &quot;could just be a recollection conflict because Paul is a brilliant amazing guy&quot;. Murray also sought Alan Silvestri. According to Sumares, Viacom did not want to use Silvestri as the organization wanted a band &quot;slightly older kids could identify with&quot;.

Pat Irwin, a veteran of many bands, including the New York-based instrumental group the Raybeats, and a side gig, the B-52s, spent five years as a music director on the series. Leading a six-piece combo on keyboard and guitar, Irwin brought together musicians such as trombonist Art Baron, drummer Kevin Norton, wind player Rob DeBellis, and bassist David Hofstra. Similar to &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;, Irwin also uses selections from the APM Music into his score.

On April 7, 2023, a soundtrack album featuring tracks from the first and second seasons was released on streaming and digital media, as well as a deluxe edition issued on September 18, 2023 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the series, with 11 additional tracks.

===Censorship===
&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; has been noted for its racy humor. Despite having been on a network that appealed to children, adults made up more than one-fifth of the audience for the show during its run; this was similar to the approach &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; had for adult audiences. The series contained numerous adult innuendos, such as Rocko&#x27;s brief stint as a telephone operator at what is implied to be a sex hotline in the season one episode &quot;Canned&quot;: the instructions on the wall behind him helpfully remind all employees to &quot;Be Hot, Be Naughty, and Be Courteous&quot; while he flatly repeats &quot;Oh baby&quot; into the receiver, who turned out to be Mrs. Bighead.

During the production of the first season, the production team was encouraged to push the boundaries of Nickelodeon much to the approach of &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot; had. An example of censorship was in the episode &quot;To Heck and Back&quot;, there was a warning in the production team that they couldn&#x27;t say &quot;hell&quot;, which instead used &quot;heck&quot; as a joke, along with jokes and references of Satanism, an issue that concerned Nickelodeon. Another controversial issue at the time of the first season&#x27;s airing was when The L.A. Times reported a story on the episode &quot;Who&#x27;s for Dinner?&quot;, which was based on Heffer finding out he was adopted, and stood out when it came to children&#x27;s television.

Joe Murray noted that the season one episode &quot;Leap Frogs&quot; received &quot;some complaints from some parents&quot; due to its sexual humor, leading to Nickelodeon removing the episode from air for the remainder of the show&#x27;s run, although it later aired on the cable channel Nicktoons and was made available on DVD and video streaming sites such as Netflix (formerly) and Paramount+. In a deleted scene from the season one episode &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Wallaby&quot;, Heffer encounters a milking machine and finds pleasure receiving, although only his reactions are shown onscreen. Due to the strong sexual innuendo behind it, it was removed before the episode was set to air.

According to writer/director Jeff &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh, the scene was originally supposed to have hearts appearing in Heffer&#x27;s eyes at the climactic moment. Although it clearly wasn&#x27;t going to be included, they described the scene to the Nickelodeon censors anyway: &quot;We described the scene, and then waited for the axe to fall, but all they said was &#x27;can you change the hearts to stars?&#x27;, we said sure, and it went in.&quot; The scene, as well as another scene with Heffer saying, &quot;Goodbye&quot; to the milking machine, were later removed. They are intact in the Canadian broadcasts of the episode, however. In addition, the uncut version can still be found on the VHS tape &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: With Friends Like These&quot;.

There were at least two occurrences of immediate censorship of the series. The original broadcast of the season two episode &quot;Road Rash&quot; featured a scene in which Rocko and Heffer stop at what is suggested to be a love hotel (the &quot;No-Tell Motel&quot;) advertising &quot;hourly rates&quot; and ask the horse desk clerk for a room, who infers the two will be engaging in intercourse: &quot;All night? [whistles] Wheeeooo! Okay.&quot; The scene was never shown again after its first airing, but a low-quality copy of the scene was made available online as early as late December 1997, and two higher quality clips have been available as late as 2021 through transmission from the original broadcast taped on VHS. The first airing of the season two episode &quot;Hut Sut Raw&quot; included a scene in which Rocko is picking berries; upon picking one lower on the bush, a bear rushes out whimpering and grasping his crotch.

This scene is left intact in the Canadian broadcasts of the episode. Both scenes were edited by Nickelodeon after their first broadcasts and are the only instances of censorship on the season two DVD, released in 2012. On the season three DVD, the &quot;Wacky Delly&quot; segment was shortened by approximately ten seconds to remove footage of Sal Ami repeatedly whacking Betty Bologna over the head with a telephone receiver. The restaurant named &quot;Chokey Chicken&quot;, a term for masturbation, was renamed &quot;Chewy Chicken&quot; for the series&#x27; fourth season.

In the 2019 special &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: Static Cling&quot;, they go back to using the original &quot;Chokey Chicken&quot; name. As the series entered reruns after it ended, more scenes were cut. The entire episode &quot;Leap Frogs&quot;, in which Bev Bighead attempts to seduce Rocko, was skipped. The entire episode &quot;Heff in a Handbasket&quot;, in which Heffer Wolfe attempts to sell his soul, was also skipped.

When Shout! Factory and Paramount announced a DVD retail release for the series, there were concerns on whether Nickelodeon would allow them to release the series complete with some of the racier humor that the network eventually cut out for reruns. In the end, Shout! Factory and Paramount only received materials from sources that were edited for broadcast, so the episodes still remained censored on the DVDs.
The only uncut release of the show on DVD so far was published in Germany in October 2013, although this release is still missing the uncut version of &quot;Road Rash&quot;.

Back when the show was rerun on Nicktoons, &quot;Leap Frogs&quot; and &quot;Heff in a Handbasket&quot;, the two episodes banned for content, were restored. While the former was removed from the rotation again, the latter was in circulation until the show was removed from the network.

===Broadcast===
&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; first ran on Nickelodeon from 1993 to 1996, and was briefly syndicated to local stations by Nick during 1995 and 1996.

In 2004, the show briefly returned to Nickelodeon as part of &quot;U-Pick Live&quot; Old School Pick, with select episodes airing on June 1 and June 11. In the summer of 2006, the series returned to Nick as part of the Nick Rewind block, and on November 22, 2007, it was shown on &quot;Super Stuffed Nicksgiving Weekend&quot;.

On the night leading into April Fools&#x27; Day 2013, The 90&#x27;s Are All That, aired a prank &quot;lost episode&quot; of the series consisting solely of a still picture of a mayonnaise jar. This is a reference to the two-part episode &quot;Wacky Delly&quot;, in which the characters attempt to sabotage the show-within-a-show, &quot;Wacky Delly&quot;. The series then returned to the block, renamed The Splat, from 2015 to 2021.

In the early 2000s, Nickelodeon Japan marketed the show along with &quot;The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show&quot;.

In Greater China, it was aired on STAR Chinese Channel during the 1990s.

==Home media==
Fans had requested that Nickelodeon produce a DVD collection of the series for years. Murray often got e-mails from fans, and his top question was &quot;When will &quot;Rocko&quot; be on DVD?&quot; Prior to the official DVD releases, Murray stated that he had not heard of any plans for a DVD release and that there are several bootleg DVD releases of the series sold on eBay. He commented, &quot;[That rips] me off every time one is bought. But at least someone is trying to give &quot;Rocko&quot; fans what they want. Because Nickelodeon sure isn&#x27;t doing it.&quot; Murray worked with his legal team to regain the rights, and an official DVD was released.

The first home video release of the series in the United States was in 1995, when selected episodes were released on VHS by Sony Wonder. Sony Wonder used &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, alongside other television programs as &quot;leading brands&quot; in order for the company to break into the market. The &quot;How to Tell if Your Dog is Brainless&quot; short can only be found on the Sony Wonder version of the VHS &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: Machine Madness&quot;. Paramount Home Media Distribution re-released the tapes in 1997 and one tape in 1998.

In July 2008, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; was added to the iTunes Store as a part of the &quot;Nick Rewind&quot; collection, in four best-of volumes. In August 2008, Nickelodeon joined forces with CreateSpace, part of the Amazon.com Inc. group of companies, to make a number of animated and live-action shows available on DVD, many for the first time. The DVDs were published via CreateSpace DVD on Demand, a service that manufactures discs as soon as customers order them on Amazon.com. &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; was available in two best-of collections, released in 2008 and a third best-of collection in 2009.

All four seasons were available in streaming format on Netflix until May 31, 2013. As of 2021, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; is now available for streaming on Paramount+. The rarely-seen episode &quot;Closet Clown/Seat to Stardom&quot;, and the holiday episodes &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Christmas!: Can&#x27;t Squeeze Cheer from a Cheese Log!&quot;, &quot;Sugar-Frosted Frights/Ed is Dead: A Thriller&quot;, and &quot;Turkey Time/Floundering Fathers&quot; are included and uncensored, but still has edited versions of &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Wallaby&quot;, &quot;Road Rash&quot;, and &quot;Hut Sut Raw&quot;.

In March 2011, Shout! Factory announced that they would release Season 1 in an official box set in June 2011. The two-disc set received relatively positive reviews, only receiving criticism for video quality and the lack of bonus features. According to Joe Murray&#x27;s website, he struck a deal with Shout! Factory to create the artwork for the Season 2 set. The special features were yet to be announced when he wrote the entry. Season 2 was released in February 2012, with Season 3 following in July 2012.

In December 2012, creator Joe Murray announced due to strong DVD sales of the first three seasons, Shout! Factory would release &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in February 2013, along with bonus material from the Rocko&#x27;s Live event from October 2012. Murray mentioned that Season 4 would be released individually on DVD soon after the complete series set was released. In February 2013, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: The Complete Series&quot; was released by Shout! Factory. The fourth and final season was released in October 2013. In November 2018, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: The Complete Series&quot; was re-released by Paramount Home Media Distribution.
The complete series was released in Germany in October 2013. The limited edition eight-disc set includes a 3D card, sticker set, postcards, episode guide, and poster, as well as bonus features included on the discs. Since the show was aired uncensored on Nickelodeon Germany in the mid-1990s, the German publishers were able to reconstruct a nearly uncensored release of the show, although this release is still missing the uncut version of &quot;Road Rash&quot;. So far, it is the only official DVD box set available that is almost completely uncut.

&quot;The Best of Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; was released in the United Kingdom in 2012 as four one-disc volumes. These were released exclusively for Poundland stores. &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: The Complete Series&quot; was released in the UK in November 2018.
In Australia, the first three seasons are available on DVD. Season 1 and Season 2 were released in April 2013. Season 3 was released in June 2013.

In August 2016, a Collector&#x27;s Edition box set which contains all four seasons was released. It is not known if season four has been released individually. Also released was a Limited Edition 3D artwork for seasons one and two. Exclusive DVDs can still be bought at JB Hi-Fi or rented at Video Ezy.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
Murray said that the cartoon &quot;resonated&quot; with people because the scenarios depicted in the cartoon involving &quot;the neurosis, the daily chores of everyday life&quot; were based on Murray&#x27;s own experiences &quot;breaking out into the world&quot; after leaving school. The show had debuted in a preview on September 18, 1993, and officially premiered on September 26, to join Nickelodeon&#x27;s Sunday morning animation block. On September 18, the series&#x27; first night of airing, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; received a 3.0 in ratings. By January 31, 1994, the series&#x27; audience grew by 65%.

&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; was at the time the network&#x27;s highest-rated cartoon launch ever. There was a brief period in 1993 when the network received numerous complaints from members of a religious group that &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; and &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; were too adult-oriented to be shown to kids on Sunday mornings. They wanted the shows moved to a different time slot. The network was polite but did not make the programming change.

===Critical reception===
Initial reviews of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; were positive. &quot;The Miami Herald&quot; ran an article about series that were &quot;rais[ing] the standards for children&#x27;s programming&quot;, singling out &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; as &quot;definitely worth a look&quot;. Jennifer Mangan of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; likened the series to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, noting the show as another example of adult animation that is &quot;not for kids&quot;. &quot;Newsday&quot; highlighted the show&#x27;s twisted sight gags. Ted Drozdowski of &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; stated in the &quot;Eye pleasers&quot; article that he enjoyed &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; because of &quot;jovial excitement&quot;, &quot;good-hearted outrage&quot;, &quot;humanity&quot;, and &quot;pushy animated characterizations&quot;. Not all reviews were positive. Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described the series as &quot;a witless rip-off of &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot;: mucus jokes without the redeeming surrealism or contempt for authority.&quot; Charles Solomon of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the series &quot;rock bottom&quot; and a &quot;tasteless attempt to capture the &quot;Ren &amp; Stimpy&quot; audience&quot;, mostly expressing displeasure at the crass humor.

&quot;Common Sense Media&quot; reviewer Emily Ashby gave &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; four stars, stating that &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; is &quot;modern and funny, but edgy content isn&#x27;t suitable for young kids.&quot;

The show has seen renewed acclaim. Brahna Siegelberg of &quot;Slate&quot; said that the aspect that was most compelling was that the show had &quot;a really poignant critique of the materialist demands of American life&quot;. She added that she &quot;realized that &quot;Rocko&quot; was really a show about how to navigate the adult world; one that could be appreciated by kids for its slapstick humor and absurdity, but had even more to say to young adults—like me&quot;. IGN called the show a prime example of the &quot;sophisticated, intelligent brand of children&#x27;s programming&quot; during Nickelodeon&#x27;s golden age. &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; called the show &quot;one of the best series&quot; from that era, praising the show&#x27;s &quot;impressive commitment to expressive character acting, well-drawn sight gags, and cartoony jokes that play with the form&#x27;s slapstick strengths.&quot; &quot;New York&quot; compared the series&#x27; humor, in retrospect, to that of &quot;Office Space&quot; (1999) and praised the subversive, anti-corporate stories.

===Awards and nominations===
Timothy J. Borquez, Patrick Foley, Michael Giesler, Michael A. Gollorn, William B. Griggs, Tom Jeager, Gregory LaPlante, Timothy Mertens, and Kenneth Young of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; received a 1994 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Film Sound Editing.

George Maestri was nominated for a CableACE Award for his &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; writing.

The series won an Environmental Media Award in 1996 for the episode &quot;Zanzibar!&quot;, a musical episode focusing on environmentalism, pollution, and deforestation. The award was accepted by the episode&#x27;s writers, Dan Povenmire and Jeff &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh, future creators of the hit Disney animated series &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;.

===Legacy and impact===
The fourth Nicktoon to debut, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s&quot; boasts a sizable cult fanbase to this day. Tom Kenny cited &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; as vital in him learning how to do voiceovers for animation. He recalled that seeing Charlie Adler have a two-way conversation with himself as the Bigheads without any edits was &quot;dazzling&quot;. Kenny described the show&#x27;s impact in an interview, saying, &quot;&quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; was just one of those shows that were the first break for a lot of people who went on to do other stuff in the business.&quot;

Some members of the &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; staff created other successful ventures. Mitch Schauer, the show&#x27;s assistant storyboard artist, would later create &quot;The Angry Beavers&quot;, which premiered on Nickelodeon in 1997 and ended in 2003. Stephen Hillenburg pitched &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; to Nickelodeon in 1997. Murray said of the pitch, &quot;If it goes well, it&#x27;ll be a blessing to us all.&quot; The network bought the show, which premiered in 1999, and it became a popular, critical and financial success, and one of the biggest shows on Nick. Hillenburg stated that he &quot;learned a great deal about writing and producing animation for TV&quot; from his time on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;.

Two writers for the series, Dan Povenmire and Jeff &quot;Swampy&quot; Marsh, went on to create &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot; for the Disney Channel. The show became a ratings success and received numerous award nominations. When Murray returned with a new animated series, &quot;Camp Lazlo&quot; on Cartoon Network, in 2005, much of the former staff of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; joined him.

Murray stated that &quot;We always kept in touch and they told me to look them up if I ever did another project&quot;, adding that the crew already knew his sensibilities and an extra decade worth of experience. Carlos Alazraqui, who played Rocko, also ended up playing the main character of Lazlo. Derek Drymon and Nick Jennings, both part of the staff, went on to be responsible for the tone and visual looks of a lot of very successful animated series that came later.

==TV special==

In September 2015, Nickelodeon stated that some of its old properties were being considered for revivals, and that &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; was one of them.

In August 2016, Nickelodeon announced that they had greenlit a one-hour TV special, with Joe Murray as executive producer. Murray revealed to &quot;Motherboard&quot; that in the special, Rocko would come back to O-Town after being in space for 20 years, and that it would focus on people&#x27;s reliance on modern technology. In June 2017, it was announced that the title of the special would be &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: Static Cling&quot; and that it would air in 2018. They reconfirmed that the entire main cast and recurring cast would be reprising their roles, alongside new voice actors Steve Little and co-director Cosmo Segurson. A special sneak peek was released to coincide with the &quot;Rocko&quot; panel at San Diego Comic-Con 2017.

In May 2019, it was announced that Netflix has acquired the distribution rights to both &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: Static Cling&quot; and &quot;Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus&quot; and the streaming service confirmed a day later they would premiere sometime in the summer of 2019.

In July 2019, it was confirmed alongside an exclusive clip by the &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; official Instagram page and various news sources that the show would premiere on Netflix on August 9, 2019.

==In other media==
A person wearing a &quot;Rocko’s Modern Life&quot; hoodie can be seen in the music video for the Blink-182 song &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

Rocko appears in a &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; skit in the episode &quot;Fila Ogden in: Maggie&#x27;s Got a Full Load&quot; where he attempts to leave Australia for America, but ends up getting run over by cars in the street.

Rocko is featured in the trailer for the &quot;Smite&quot; and Nickelodeon crossover, along with Zim from &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, and Danny Phantom from the animated series of the same name, released in July 2022. The Nickelodeon exclusive edition was released a week later.

==Merchandise==
In January 1994, Nickelodeon received ten &quot;licensing partners&quot; for merchandise for the series. Hardee&#x27;s distributed &quot;Rocko&quot; toys. Viacom New Media released one game based on the show, &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: Spunky&#x27;s Dangerous Day&quot;, in the United States in April 1994, for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. &quot;Microsoft&#x27;s Nickelodeon 3-D Movie Maker&quot; features various characters from the show.

Rocko appeared as a playable character in the game &quot;&quot;. Rocko and Heffer make cameo appearances in &quot;Nicktoons MLB&quot;, and are both playable in &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers 2: Grand Prix&quot;, which features with two racetracks based on the show. Rocko appears as a playable character in &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot; via downloadable content and &quot;Nickelodeon Kart Racers 3: Slime Speedway&quot;. Nick.com created two free online games featuring Rocko, using Shockwave, which requires the Shockwave Player plugin, website also requires Flash Player plugin.

Hot Topic sells &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; merchandise such as T-shirts, wristbands, keychains and other items as part of their Nick Classic line. In 1997, plushes of Rocko, Spunky, and Heffer were released exclusively at the Viacom Entertainment Store. They are difficult to find in the present day and age. In 2016, a different Rocko plush was released.

===Comics===
During Tom DeFalco&#x27;s Editor-in-Chief career, Marvel Comics produced a seven-issue &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; comic book series. Marvel published the series from June 1994 to December 1994 with monthly releases. Nickelodeon approached Marvel, asking the company to produce comic book series for &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; and &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot;. Marvel purchased the license for Rocko from Nickelodeon. The staff created the comics, and Susan Luposniak, a Nickelodeon employee, examined the comics before they were released. Joe Murray said in a December 2008 blog entry that he drew some of the pages in the comic book series.

The comics contain stories not seen in the television show. The comic book series omits some television show characters and places, while some original places and characters appear in the comics. John &quot;Lewie&quot; Lewandowski wrote all of the stories except for one; Joey Cavalieri wrote &quot;Beaten by a Club&quot;, the second story of Issue #4.

Troy Little, a resident of Monroe, Oregon, wrote to Marvel requesting that the title for the comic&#x27;s letters column should be &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot;. In Issue 3, published in August 1994, the editors decided to use the title for the comic&#x27;s &quot;Letters to the Editor&quot; section. In Issue 5, published in October 1994, the editors stated that they were still receiving suggestions for the title of the comic even though they had decided on using &quot;That&#x27;s Life&quot; by Issue 3.

On December 2017, Boom! Studios began publishing a new &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; comic book series. After a few comic book issues, it returned for a short time in the spring of 2019 with &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life: Afterlife&quot;, being based on Rocko, Heffer, and Filbert dealing with a zombie apocalypse.

<text>Sic transit gloria mundi is a Latin phrase that means &quot;thus passes the glory of the world&quot;. In idiomatic contexts, the phrase has been used to mean &quot;fame is fleeting&quot;.

The phrase was used in the ritual of papal coronation ceremonies between 1409 (when it was used at the coronation of Alexander V) and 1963. As the newly chosen Pope proceeded from the sacristy of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in his sedia gestatoria, the procession stopped three times. On each occasion, a papal master of ceremonies would fall to his knees before the Pope, holding a silver or brass reed, bearing a tow of smoldering flax. For three times in succession, as the cloth burned away, he would say in a loud and mournful voice, &quot;&quot;Pater Sancte, sic transit gloria mundi&quot;!&quot; (&quot;Holy Father, so passes worldly glory!&quot;). These words, thus addressed to the Pope, served as a reminder of the transitory nature of life and earthly honours.

A form of the phrase appeared in Thomas à Kempis&#x27;s 1418 work &quot;The Imitation of Christ&quot;: &quot;&quot; (&quot;How quickly the glory of the world passes away&quot;).

==In literature and art==

* Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s 1867 &quot;War and Peace&quot; mentions this phrase as a proclamation used during the Freemasonry&#x27;s ritual of accepting new members (in Chapter IV of the Second Part of Book II).
*Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s 1867 &quot;Peer Gynt&quot; uses this phrase in act 5 as the last words Peer speaks to Dovre-Master (the troll king): &quot;The best of luck; remember me to them. / If I can get free I&#x27;ll follow your lead. / I&#x27;ll write a farce of crazy profundity / And call it &#x27;Sic transit gloria mundi&#x27;.&quot;
* William Wordsworth&#x27;s 1802 &quot;&quot; deals with the disappearance of &quot;the glory and the dream&quot;, and the end of the second stanza includes a literal translation of the line: &quot;There hath pass&#x27;d a glory from the earth.&quot;
* American poet Emily Dickinson&#x27;s first published poem was titled &quot;Sic Transit Gloria Mundi&quot;.
* An 1819 etching by British illustrator George Cruikshank is titled &quot;The Sailors Progress: Sic Transit Gloria Mundi&quot;.
* In Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s novel &quot;Starman Jones&quot;, toward the end of Chapter 12 &quot;Halcyon&quot;, there is this line of dialogue: &quot;&quot;Sic transit gloria mundi&quot;—Tuesday is usually worse.&quot;
* The first-season finale of American TV series &quot;Yellowjackets&quot; is titled &quot;Sic Transit Gloria Mundi&quot;.
* Robert Hugh Benson&#x27;s novel &quot;Lord of the World&quot; ends with a reference to the phrase: &quot;Then this world passed, and the glory of it.&quot;
* It is the last line spoken in the movie &quot;The Masque of the Red Death&quot;, by the Red Death after he reveals he spared six from his plague.
* In the opening scene of the final episode of Babylon 5, season 4 entitled &quot;The Deconstructions of Falling Stars,&quot; a person in the crowd welcoming President Sheridan and Ambassador Delenn can be seen holding a sign that reads &quot;Sic Transit Gloria Mundi&quot;.
*The alternative band Brand New named a single from their 2003 album Deja Entendu, &quot;Sic Transit Gloria...Glory Fades&quot;. 
*In the video game Alundra 2, the key priest, in the cutscene where Pierre gets turned in Dun Webb, uses the line &quot;Sic Transit Gloria Mundi, Ghost ex Machina!&quot;
*In the video game Overwatch 2, The character &quot;Soldier 76&quot; uses the voice line &quot;Sic Transit Gloria Mundi.&quot;
*In the feature film &#x27;The Tracker&#x27; (2002) directed by Rolf de Heer, a fanatical policeman says &quot;sic transit gloria mundi&quot;, each word accompanied by him pointing a pistol where the heads of a group of Indigenous Australians had been minutes before. He was a significant participant in their slaughter and explains to the other characters that the phrase means &#x27;So passes the glorious world.&#x27;
*In the book series, &#x27;Monster Hunter International&#x27; at Monster Hunter International&#x27;s memorial wall for fallen monster hunters.
*In the Soviet romantic fantasy comedy film &#x27;Formula of Love&#x27; (1984) a village blacksmith Stepan Stepanovich pronounces &quot;Sic Transit Gloria Mundi&quot; immediately translating it into Russian, though people wonder how can he know Latin.

<text>An ovarian cyst is a fluid-filled sac within the ovary. They usually cause no symptoms, but occasionally they may produce bloating, lower abdominal pain, or lower back pain. The majority of cysts are harmless. If the cyst either breaks open or causes twisting of the ovary, it may cause severe pain. This may result in vomiting or feeling faint, and even cause headaches.

Most ovarian cysts are related to ovulation, being either follicular cysts or corpus luteum cysts. Other types include cysts due to endometriosis, dermoid cysts, and cystadenomas. Many small cysts occur in both ovaries in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Pelvic inflammatory disease may also result in cysts. Rarely, cysts may be a form of ovarian cancer. Diagnosis is undertaken by pelvic examination with a pelvic ultrasound or other testing used to gather further details.
Often, cysts are simply observed over time. If they cause pain, medications such as paracetamol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen may be used. Hormonal birth control may be used to prevent further cysts in those who are frequently affected. However, evidence does not support birth control as a treatment of current cysts. If they do not go away after several months, get larger, look unusual, or cause pain, they may be removed by surgery.
Most women of reproductive age develop small cysts each month. Large cysts that cause problems occur in about 8% of women before menopause. Ovarian cysts are present in about 16% of women after menopause, and, if present, are more likely to be cancerous.
==Signs and symptoms==

Ovarian cysts tend to produce non-specific symptoms (i.e., symptoms that could be caused by a large number of conditions). Some or all of the following symptoms may be present, though it is possible not to experience any symptoms:
* Abdominal pain. Dull aching pain within the abdomen or pelvis, especially during intercourse.
* Uterine bleeding. Pain during or shortly after beginning or end of menstrual period; irregular periods, or abnormal uterine bleeding or spotting.
* Fullness, heaviness, pressure, swelling, or bloating in the abdomen. Some ovarian cysts become large enough to cause the lower abdomen to visibly swell.
* When a cyst ruptures from the ovary, there may be sudden and sharp pain in the lower abdomen on one side.
* Large cysts can cause a change in frequency or ease of urination (such as inability to fully empty the bladder), or difficulty with bowel movements due to pressure on adjacent pelvic anatomy.
* Constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, headaches.
* Nausea or vomiting
* Weight gain
Other symptoms may depend on the cause of the cysts:
* Symptoms that may occur if the cause of the cysts is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) may include increased facial hair or body hair, acne, obesity and infertility.
* If the cause is endometriosis, then periods may be heavy, and intercourse painful.

The effect of cysts not related to PCOS on fertility is unclear.

In other cases, the cyst is asymptomatic, and is discovered incidentally while doing medical imaging for another condition. Ovarian cysts and other &quot;incidentalomas&quot; of the uterine adnexa appear in almost 5% of CT scans done on women.

The most common complications are cyst rupture, which occasionally leads to internal bleeding (&quot;hemorrhagic cyst&quot;), and ovarian torsion.

=== Cyst rupture ===
When the surface of cyst breaks, the contents can leak out; this is called a &quot;ruptured cyst&quot;. The main symptom is abdominal pain, which may last a few days to several weeks, but they can also be asymptomatic.

A ruptured ovarian cyst is usually self-limiting, and only requires keeping an eye on the situation and pain medications for a few days, while the body heals itself. Rupture of large ovarian cysts can cause bleeding inside the abdominal cavity. Rarely, enough blood will be lost that the bleeding will produce hypovolemic shock, which can be a medical emergency requiring surgery. However, normally, the internal bleeding is minimal and requires no intervention.

=== Ovarian torsion ===
Ovarian torsion is a very painful medical condition requiring urgent surgery. It can be caused by a pedunculated ovarian cyst that twisted in a way that cuts off the blood flow. It is most likely to be seen in women of reproductive age, though it has happened in young girls (premenarche) and postmenopausal women. Ovarian torsion may be more likely during pregnancy, especially during the third and fourth months of pregnancy, as the internal anatomy shifts to accommodate fetal growth. Diagnosis relies on clinical examination and ultrasound imaging.

Cysts larger than 4 cm are associated with approximately 17% risk.

==Types==
There are many types of ovarian cysts, some of which are normal and most of which are benign (non-cancerous).

===Functional===
Functional cysts form as a normal part of the menstrual cycle. There are several types of functional cysts:
* Follicular cyst, the most common type of ovarian cyst. In menstruating women, an ovarian follicle containing the ovum (an unfertilized egg) normally releases the ovum during ovulation. If it does not release the ovum, a follicular cyst of more than 2.5 cm diameter may result. A ruptured follicular cyst can be painful.
* A luteal cyst is a cyst that forms after ovulation, from the corpus luteum (the remnant of the ovarian follicle, after the ovum has been released). A luteal cyst is twice as likely to appear on the right side. It normally resolves during the last week of the menstrual cycle. A corpus luteum that is more than 3 cm is abnormal.
* Theca lutein cysts occur within the thecal layer of cells surrounding developing oocytes. Under the influence of excessive hCG, thecal cells may proliferate and become cystic. This is usually on both ovaries.

===Non-functional===
Non-functional cysts may include the following:
* An ovary with many cysts, which may be found in normal women, or within the setting of polycystic ovary syndrome
* Cysts caused by endometriosis, known as chocolate cysts
* Hemorrhagic ovarian cyst
* Dermoid cyst – the most common non-functional ovarian cyst, especially for women under the age of 30, they are benign (non-cancerous) with varied morphology. They can usually be diagnosed from ultrasound alone. Depending on size, growth rate (usually slow), and the age of the woman, treatment might involve surgical removal or watchful waiting. They are also called mature cystic teratomas.
* Ovarian serous cystadenoma – more common in women between the age of 30 and 40.
* Ovarian mucinous cystadenoma – although there is usually only one of these, they can grow very large, with diameters sometimes exceeding 50 cm (20 inches).
* Paraovarian cyst
* Cystic adenofibroma
* Borderline tumoral cysts

==Risk factors==
Risk factors include fertility status (more common in women of childbearing age) and irregular menstrual cycles. Using combined hormonal contraception may reduce the risk, especially with high-dose pills, but it does not treat existing cysts.

==Diagnosis==

Ovarian cysts are usually diagnosed by pelvic ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI, and correlated with clinical presentation and endocrinologic tests as appropriate. Ultrasound is the most important imaging modality, as abnormalities seen in a CT scan sometimes prove to be normal in ultrasound. If a different modality is needed, then MRIs are more reliable than CT scans.

===Ultrasound===
Usually, an experienced sonographer can readily identify benign ovarian cysts, often with a level of accuracy that rivals other approaches.

Follow-up imaging in women of reproductive age for incidentally discovered simple cysts on ultrasound is not needed until 5 cm, as these are usually normal ovarian follicles. Simple cysts 5 to 7 cm in premenopausal females should be followed yearly. Simple cysts larger than 7 cm require further imaging with MRI or surgical assessment. Because they are large, they cannot be reliably assessed by ultrasound alone; it can be difficult to see posterior wall soft tissue nodularity or thickened septation due to limited ultrasound beam penetrance at this size and depth. For the corpus luteum, a dominant ovulating follicle that typically appears as a cyst with circumferentially thickened walls and crenulated inner margins, follow up is not needed if the cyst is less than 3 cm in diameter. In postmenopausal women, any simple cyst greater than 1 cm but less than 7 cm needs yearly follow-up, while those greater than 7 cm need MRI or surgical evaluation, similar to reproductive age females.

For incidentally discovered dermoids, diagnosed on ultrasound by their pathognomonic echogenic fat, either surgical removal or yearly follow up is indicated, regardless of the woman&#x27;s age. For peritoneal inclusion cysts, which have a crumpled tissue-paper appearance and tend to follow the contour of adjacent organs, follow up is based on clinical history. Hydrosalpinx, or fallopian tube dilation, can be mistaken for an ovarian cyst due to its anechoic appearance. Follow-up for this is also based on clinical presentation.

For multilocular cysts with thin septation less than 3 mm, surgical evaluation is recommended. The presence of multiloculation suggests a neoplasm, although the thin septation implies that the neoplasm is benign. For any thickened septation, nodularity, vascular flow on color doppler, or growth over several ultrasounds, surgical removal may be considered due to concern of cancer.

===Scoring systems===
Most ovarian cysts are not malignant; however, some do become cancerous. There are several systems to assess risk of an ovarian cyst of being an ovarian cancer, including the RMI (risk of malignancy index), LR2 and SR (simple rules). Sensitivities and specificities of these systems are given in tables below:

Ovarian cysts may be classified according to whether they are a variant of the normal menstrual cycle, referred to as a functional or follicular cyst.

Ovarian cysts are considered large when they are over 5 cm and giant when they are over 15 cm. In children, ovarian cysts reaching above the level of the umbilicus are considered giant.

===Associated conditions===
In juvenile hypothyroidism multicystic ovaries are present in about 75% of cases, while large ovarian cysts and elevated ovarian tumor marks are one of the symptoms of the Van Wyk and Grumbach syndrome.

The CA-125 marker in children and adolescents can be frequently elevated even in absence of malignancy and conservative management should be considered.

Polycystic ovarian syndrome involves the development of multiple small cysts in both ovaries due to an elevated ratio of leutenizing hormone to follicle stimulating hormone, typically more than 25 cysts in each ovary, or an ovarian volume of greater than 10 mL.

Larger bilateral cysts can develop as a result of fertility treatment due to elevated levels of HCG, as can be seen with the use of clomifene for follicular induction, in extreme cases resulting in a condition known as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Certain malignancies can mimic the effects of clomifene on the ovaries, also due to increased HCG, in particular gestational trophoblastic disease. Ovarian hyperstimulation occurs more often with invasive moles and choriocarcinoma than complete molar pregnancies.

===Risk of cancer===
Accurately differentiating an cyst from a cancer is critical to management. Medical imaging showing a simple, smooth bubble of watery liquid is characteristic of a benign cyst. If the cyst is large, is multilocular, or has complex internal features, such as papillary (bumpy) projections into the cyst or solid areas inside the cyst, it is more likely to be cancerous.

A widely recognised method of estimating the risk of malignant ovarian cancer based on initial workup is the &quot;risk of malignancy index&quot; (RMI). It is recommended that women with an RMI score over 200 should be referred to a centre with experience in ovarian cancer surgery.

The RMI is calculated as follows:
:RMI = ultrasound score × menopausal score × CA-125 level in U/ml.

There are two methods to determine the ultrasound score and menopausal score, with the resultant RMI being called RMI 1 and RMI 2, respectively, depending on what method is used:

RMI 2 is regarded as more sensitive than RMI 1, but the model has low specificity, which means that many of the suspected cancers turn out to be overdiagnosed benign cysts. The calculation is often inaccurate during pregnancy, especially when CA-125 levels peak towards the end of the first trimester.

The International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) group has produced a different model. Theirs relies on &quot;simple descriptors&quot; and &quot;simple rules&quot;. An example of a simple descriptor for a benign cyst is &quot;Unilocular cyst of anechoic content with regular walls and largest diameter less than 10 cm&quot;. An example of a simple rule is acoustic shadows are associated with benign cysts.

===Histopathology===
In case an ovarian cyst is surgically removed, a more definite diagnosis can be made by histopathology:
==Treatment==
Most ovarian cysts occur naturally and go away in a few months without needing any treatment. In general, there are three options for dealing with an ovarian cyst:

* watchful waiting (e.g., waiting to see whether symptoms resolve on their own),
* additional imaging or investigation (e.g., getting an ultrasound later to see whether the cyst is growing), and
* surgery (e.g., surgical removal of the cyst).

Cysts associated with hypothyroidism or other endocrine problems are managed by treating the underlying condition.

About 95% of ovarian cysts are benign (not cancerous). Functional cysts and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts usually resolve spontaneously within one or two menstrual cycles.

However, the bigger an ovarian cyst is, the less likely it is to disappear on its own. Treatment may be required if cysts persist over several months, grow, or cause increasing pain. Cysts that persist beyond two or three menstrual cycles, or occur in post-menopausal women, may indicate more serious disease and should be investigated through ultrasonography and laparoscopy, especially in cases where family members have had ovarian cancer. Such cysts may require surgical biopsy. Additionally, a blood test may be taken before surgery to check for elevated CA-125, a tumour marker, which is often found in increased levels in ovarian cancer, although it can also be elevated by other conditions resulting in a large number of false positives.

=== Expectant management ===
If the cyst is asymptomatic and appears to be either benign or normal (i.e., a cyst with a benign appearance and a size of less than 3 cm diameter in premenopausal women or less than 1 cm in postmenopausal women), then delaying surgery, in the hope that it will prove unnecessary, is appropriate and recommended. Normal ovarian cysts require neither treatment nor additional investigations. Benign but medium-size cysts may prompt an additional pelvic ultrasound after a couple of months. (The larger the cyst, the sooner the follow-up imaging is done.)

===Symptom management ===
Pain associated with ovarian cysts may be treated in several ways:
* Pain relievers such as acetaminophen, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or opioids.
* While hormonal birth control prevents the development of new cysts in those who frequently get them, it is not useful for the treatment of current cysts.

===Surgery===

Although most cases of ovarian cysts are monitored and stabilize or resolve without surgery, some cases require surgery. Common indications for surgical management include ovarian torsion, ruptured cyst, concerns that the cyst is cancerous, and pain; some surgeons additionally recommend removing all large cysts.

The surgery may involve removing the cyst alone, or one or both ovaries. Very large, potentially cancerous, and recurrent cysts, particularly in menopausal women, are more likely to be treated by removing the affected ovary, or both the ovary and its Fallopian tube (salpingo-oophorectomy). For women of reproductive age, the aim is to preserve as much of the reproductive system as possible. It&#x27;s often possible to just remove the cyst and leave both ovaries intact, which means the fertility should be unaffected.

Simple benign cysts can be drained through fine-needle aspiration. However, the risk of recurrence is fairly high (33–40%), and if a cancerous tumor was misdiagnosed, it could cause the cancer to spread.

The surgical technique is typically a minimally invasive or laparoscopic approach performed under general anaesthesia, unless the cyst is particularly large (e.g., 10 cm [4 inches] in diameter), or if pre-operative imaging, such as pelvic ultrasound, suggests malignancy or complex anatomy. For large cysts, open laparotomy or a mini-laparotomy (a smaller incision through the abdominal wall) may be preferred. Minimally invasive surgeries are not used when ovarian cancer is suspected. Additionally, if the pelvic surgery is being done, some women choose to have prophylactic salpingectomy done at the same time, to reduce their future risk of cancer.

If the cyst ruptures during surgery, the contents may irritate the peritoneum and cause internal adhesions. The cyst may be drained before removal, and the abdominal cavity carefully irrigated to remove any leaked fluids, to reduce this risk.

====After surgery====
The time it takes to recover from surgery is different for everyone. After the ovarian cyst has been removed, one will feel pain in the tummy, although this should improve in a few days.

After a laparoscopy or a laparotomy, it may take as long as 12 weeks before one can resume normal activities. If the cyst is sent off for testing, the results should come back in a few weeks. These symptoms may indicate an infection and need further attention:
* heavy bleeding
* severe pain or swelling in the abdomen
* a high temperature (fever)
* dark or smelly vaginal discharge

====Cancer treatment====
If the test results show that the cyst is cancerous, both of ovaries, womb (uterus) and some of the surrounding tissue may need to be removed.
This would trigger an early menopause and means that pregnancy is no longer possible.

====Treating conditions that cause ovarian cysts====
If a condition that can cause ovarian cysts, such as endometriosis or polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), has been diagnosed, treatment may be different.
For example, endometriosis may be treated with painkillers, hormone medication, and/or surgery to remove or destroy areas of endometriosis tissue.

==Frequency==
Most women of reproductive age develop small cysts each month. Simple, smooth ovarian cysts, smaller than 3 cm and apparently filled with water, are considered normal. Large cysts that cause problems occur in about 8% of women before menopause. Ovarian cysts are present in about 16% of women after menopause, and have a higher risk of being cancer than in younger women. If a cyst appears benign during diagnosis, then it has a less than 1% chance of being either cancer or borderline malignant.

Benign ovarian cysts are common in asymptomatic premenarchal girls and found in approximately 68% of ovaries of girls 2–12 years old and in 84% of ovaries of girls 0–2 years old. Most of them are smaller than 9 mm while about 10–20% are larger macrocysts. While the smaller cysts mostly disappear within 6 months the larger ones appear to be more persistent.

== In pregnancy ==
Ovarian cysts are seen during pregnancy. They tend to be simple benign cysts measuring less than 5 cm in diameter, most commonly functional follicular or luteal cysts. They are more common earlier in the pregnancy. When they are detected early in pregnancy, such as during a routine prenatal ultrasound, they usually resolve on their own after a couple of months. Pregnancy changes hormone levels, and that can affect the diagnostic process. For example, some endometriomas (a type of benign ovarian cyst) will undergo decidualization, which can make them look more like a cancerous tumor in medical imaging.

A large cyst, if it puts pressure on the lower part of the uterus, can cause obstructed labor (also called &quot;labor dystocia&quot;).

Rarely, a cyst discovered during pregnancy will prove to be cancerous or to have cancerous potential. Malignant tumors discovered during pregnancy are usually germ cell, sex cord–gonadal stromal, or carcinomas, or slightly less commonly, borderline serous or mucinous cysts.

== History ==
In 1809, Ephraim McDowell became the first surgeon to successfully remove an ovarian cyst.

== Society and culture ==
Benign tumors were known in ancient Egypt, and an ovarian cyst has been identified in a mummy, Irtyersenu (c. 600 BC), that was autopsied in the early 19th century.

<text>A deed is a legal document that is signed and delivered, especially concerning the ownership of property or legal rights. Specifically, in common law, a deed is any legal instrument in writing which passes, affirms or confirms an interest, right, or property and that is signed, attested, delivered, and in some jurisdictions, sealed. It is commonly associated with transferring (conveyancing) title to property. The deed has a greater presumption of validity and is less rebuttable than an instrument signed by the party to the deed. A deed can be unilateral or bilateral. Deeds include conveyances, commissions, licenses, patents, diplomas, and conditionally powers of attorney if executed as deeds. The deed is the modern descendant of the medieval charter, and delivery is thought to symbolically replace the ancient ceremony of livery of seisin.

The traditional phrase &quot;signed, sealed and delivered&quot; refers to the practice of using seals; however, attesting witnesses have replaced seals to some extent. Agreements under seal are also called contracts by deed or &quot;specialty&quot;; in the United States, a specialty is enforceable without consideration. In some jurisdictions, specialties have a liability limitation period of double that of a simple contract and allow for a third party beneficiary to enforce an undertaking in the deed, thereby overcoming the doctrine of privity. Specialties, as a form of contract, are and can therefore be distinguished from covenants, which, being also under seal, are unilateral promises.

== Requirements ==
At common law, to be valid and enforceable, a deed must meet several requirements:
* It must state on its face that it is a deed, using wording like &quot;This Deed...&quot; or &quot;executed as a deed&quot;.
* It must indicate that the instrument itself conveys some privilege or thing to someone.
* The grantor must have the legal ability to grant the thing or privilege, and the grantee must have the legal capacity to receive it.
* It must be executed by the grantor in presence of the prescribed number of witnesses, known as instrumentary witnesses (this is known as being in solemn form).
* In some jurisdictions, a seal must be affixed to it. Originally, affixing seals made persons parties to the deed and signatures optional, but seals are now outdated in most jurisdictions, so the signatures of the grantor and witnesses are primary.
* It must be delivered to (delivery) and, in some jurisdictions, accepted by the grantee (acceptance).

Under the law of England and Wales, a deed may be delivered or otherwise handled in one of three ways:
*it may be delivered as an unconditional deed,
*it may be delivered as a deed in escrow, or
*it may be handed to an agent who has instructions to deal with it in a certain manner.

Deeds delivered unconditionally are irrevocable.

Section 46(2) of the UK&#x27;s Companies Act 2006 states that a document executed as a deed by a company is presumed to be delivered upon execution, but this presumption can be rebutted if a contrary intention is proved.

Conditions attached to the acceptance of a deed are known as covenants. A deed indented or indenture is one executed in two or more parts according to the number of parties, which were formerly separated by cutting in a curved or indented line known as the chirograph. A deed poll is one executed in one part, by one party, having the edge polled or cut even, and includes simple grants and appointments.

==Deeds of conveyance==

===General and special warranty===

In the transfer of real estate, a deed conveys ownership from the old owner (the grantor) to the new owner (the grantee), and can include various warranties. The precise name and nature of these warranties differ by jurisdiction. Often, however, the basic differences between them is the degree to which the grantor warrants the title. The grantor may give a general warranty of title against any claims, or the warranty may be limited to only claims which occurred after the grantor obtained the real estate. The latter type of deed is usually known as a &quot;special warranty deed&quot;. While a &quot;general warranty deed&quot; was normally used for residential real estate sales and transfers, special warranty deeds are becoming more common and are more commonly used in commercial transactions.

===Bargain and sale deed===
A third type of deed, known as a &quot;bargain and sale deed&quot;, implies that the grantor has the right to convey title but makes no warranties against encumbrances. This type of deed is most commonly used by court officials or fiduciaries that hold the property by force of law rather than title, such as properties seized for unpaid taxes and sold at sheriff&#x27;s sale, or an executor.

=== Quitclaim deed ===
A so-called &quot;quitclaim deed&quot; is (in most jurisdictions) actually not a deed at all—it is actually an estoppel disclaiming rights of the person signing it to property.

===Deed of trust===
In some jurisdictions, a deed of trust is used as an alternative to a mortgage. A deed of trust is not used to transfer property directly. It is commonly used in some states — California, for example — to transfer title to land to a “trustee”, usually a trust or title company, which holds the title as security (&quot;in escrow&quot;) for a loan. When the loan is paid off, title is transferred to the borrower by recording a release of the obligation, and the trustee&#x27;s contingent ownership is extinguished. Otherwise, upon default, the trustee will liquidate the property with a new deed and offset the lender&#x27;s loss with the proceeds.

===Deeds as alternatives to bankruptcy===
* Deed of arrangement – document setting out an arrangement for a debtor to pay part or all outstanding debts, as an alternative to bankruptcy; (Australian law).
* Deed of assignment – document in which a debtor appoints a trustee to take charge of property to pay debts, partly or wholly, as an alternative to bankruptcy; (Australian law).

===Sanad===
&quot;Sanad&quot;, also spelt as &quot;sunnud&quot;, was a deed granted to the rulers of native princely states in British India confirming them in their ruling position in return for their allegiance to the British Raj.

====Sanad of adoption====
Since the extinction of the royal bloodline would be a ground for annexation of a principality by the British, some rulers were also granted &quot;sanads&quot; of adoption. Devised as a reward for loyalty to British rule in India, especially after the Indian rebellion of 1857, such deeds gave a ruler the right to adopt chosen heirs from local noble families in case of lack of direct issue. Among the rulers that were given sanads of adoption, Takht Singh, Jaswant Singh of Bharatpur, as well as the rulers of Nagod State, Samthar State and the Chaube Jagirs are worth mentioning.

==Structure==

The main clauses of a deed of conveyance are:
* Premises
** Parties clause – sets out the names, addresses, and descriptions (vendor/purchaser, grantor/grantee, transferor/transferee) of parties
** Recitals – narrates in chronological order the previous ownership of the property being conveyed, starting with the earliest deed of title down to the contract of sale the conveyance gives effect to
** Testatum – a command to witness which acknowledges the payment and receipt of the consideration and signals the beginning of the operative part; usually begins with &quot;Now this Deed witnesseth&quot;
* Operative part
** Operative clause – vendor gives effect to the contract of sale by conveying his interest in land to the purchaser
** Parcels clause – clause detailing the location and description of the property being conveyed
** Habendum – clause indicating the estate (freehold, etc.) or interest to be taken by the grantee
** Tenendum – &quot;to have and to hold&quot;, formerly referring to the tenure by which the estate granted was to be held, though now completely symbolic
** Reddendum – reserves something to grantor out of thing granted, such as rent, under the formula &quot;yielding and paying&quot;.
** Conditions
** Warranty – grantor warrants the title to the grantee
*** general: when the warrant is against all persons
*** special: when it is only against the grantor, his heirs and those claiming under him
** Covenants – binding limitations or promises
* Conclusion (or eschatocol) – execution and date
** Testimonium (Scotland: &quot;testing clause&quot;) – attests to the due execution of a deed or instrument.
*** Examples:
**** England &amp; Wales: &quot;In Witness Whereof, the parties to these presents have hereunto set their hands and seals&quot;.
**** Ireland: &quot;In Witness Whereof the parties hereto have hereunto set their hands and affixed their seals [the day and year first herein written]&quot;.
**** Scotland: &quot;IN WITNESS WHEREOF these presents, consisting of this and the preceding pages, are subscribed by [me] at [place] on the [day] day of [month] Two thousand and [year] in the presence of [name] of [address]&quot;.

==Recording==
Usually the transfer of ownership of real estate is registered at a cadastre in the United Kingdom. In most parts of the United States, deeds must be submitted to the recorder of deeds, who acts as a cadastre, to be registered. An unrecorded deed may be valid proof of ownership between the parties, but may have no effect upon third-party claims until disclosed or recorded. A local statute may prescribe a period beyond which unrecorded deeds become void as to third parties, at least as to intervening acts.

===Joint ownership===
Ownership transfer may also be crafted within deeds to pass by demise, as where a property is held in concurrent estate such as &quot;joint tenants with right of survivor-ship&quot; (JTWROS) or &quot;tenants by the entirety&quot;. In each case, the title to the property immediately and automatically vests in the named survivor(s) upon the death of the other tenant(s).

In most states joint tenancy with the right of survivor-ship requires all owners to have equal interests in the property, meaning upon sale or partition of the property, all owners would receive an equal distribution of the proceeds.

Joint ownership may also be by tenants in common (TIC). In some states, joint ownership is presumed to be as tenants in common unless the parties are married and the deed so states or the deed sets for joint tenants with right of survivor-ship. Upon death, the decedent&#x27;s share passes to his or her estate.

A life estate is the right to use, possess and enjoy the property for a period of time measured by the natural life of a person or persons. When all life tenants are dead, the remainder-man holds full title.

===Joint tenants with rights of survivor-ship vs. joint tenants in common===
When deeds are taken as joint tenants with rights of survivor-ship (JTWROS) or joint tenants in common (TIC), any co-owner can file a petition for partition to dissolve the tenancy relationship. JTWROS deed holders always take the property in equal shares; therefore, if the partnership is dissolved through partition, the proceeds must be equally distributed between all of the co-owners without regard to how much each co-owner contributed to the purchase price of the property. No credits would be allowed for any excess contributions to the purchase price. For example, if A and B co-own property as JTWROS and A contributed 80% of the purchase price, A and B would still receive equal distributions upon partition. On the other hand, TIC deed holders may be granted at partition a credit for unequal contributions to purchase price. During either partition, credits may be awarded to any co-owner who may have contributed in excess of his share to the property expenses after taking deed to the property. Credits may be allowed for utilities and maintenance; however, credits for improvements may not be allowed unless the improvements actually added substantial value to the property.

===Pardon as deed===
In the United States, a pardon of the President was once considered to be a deed and thus needed to be accepted by the recipient. This made it impossible to grant a pardon posthumously. However, in the case of Henry Ossian Flipper, this view was altered when President Bill Clinton pardoned him in 1999.

=== Title deed ===
Germany operates a &#x27;property register&#x27;. Title deeds are documents showing ownership, as well as rights, obligations, or mortgages on the property. Since around 2000, compulsory registration has been required for all properties mortgaged or transferred. The details of rights, obligations, and covenants referred to in deeds will be transferred to the register, a contract describing the property ownership.

=== Difference between a deed and an agreement ===
The main difference between a deed and an agreement is that the deed is generally signed by only one person / party. Examples of a deed are deeds of hyphenation for creating charge on movable properties in favor of the banks/financial institutions etc.

An agreement by its name suggests that there should be at least two parties signing/approving the same. Examples of an agreement are agreement to sale, loan agreement etc.

At common law, ownership was proven via an unbroken chain of title deeds. The Torrens title system is an alternative way of proving ownership. First introduced in South Australia in 1858 by Sir Robert Torrens and adopted later by the other Australian states and other countries, ownership under Torrens title is proven by possession of a certificate of title and the corresponding entry in the property register. This system removes risks associated with unregistered deeds and fraudulent or otherwise incorrect transactions. It is much easier and cheaper to administer, lowering transaction costs. Some Australian properties are still conveyed using a chain of title deeds – usually properties that have been owned by the same family since the nineteenth century – and these are often referred to as &#x27;Old System&#x27; deeds.

===Wild deeds===
A deed that is recorded, but is not connected to the chain of title of the property, is called a wild deed. A wild deed does not provide constructive notice to later purchasers of the property, because subsequent bona fide purchasers cannot reasonably be expected to locate the deed while investigating the chain of title to the property. Haupt has stated that
Because title searching relies on the grantor/grantee indexes, it&#x27;s possible that a deed won&#x27;t be discovered even though it was recorded. &quot;Example: Atwood sells his land to Burns, but Burns does not record his deed. Burns later sells the land to Cooper, and Cooper records her deed. But because the previous deed (the deed from Atwood to Burns) was not recorded, Cooper&#x27;s deed is outside the chain of title. In a title search, someone looking up Atwood&#x27;s name in the grantor index would find no indication that Atwood conveyed the property, and nothing would lead the searcher to Cooper&#x27;s deed.&quot; A deed that is outside the chain of title is called a wild deed. The general rule is that a subsequent purchaser is not held to have constructive notice of a wild deed. In the example, Cooper&#x27;s title is unprotected against subsequent good faith purchasers. Suppose Atwood were to fraudulently sell the same property to another person, Dunn. A court would rule that Dunn has good title to the property, not Cooper.

A wild deed has been described as a deed &quot;executed by a stranger to the record title hung out in the air like Mahomet&#x27;s coffin&quot;. Mahomet is an archaic spelling of Muhammad. There is a legend that the Prophet Muhammad&#x27;s coffin was suspended without visible support from the ceiling of his tomb, just as a wild deed just hangs there, not touching the chain of title.

== Non-fungible tokens as deeds ==

=== Background of use-case ===
Blockchain technology has emerged with the potential to innovate and support the function of deeds in specific contexts. By design, blockchains contain an immutable ledger of transactions, recording transfers of information among users. Within this system, a particular type of transferable object, known as a non-fungible token (NFT), can be created. These NFTs are unique, verifiable, and protected against arbitrary tampering, thanks to the immutable nature of the blockchain. By incorporating metadata (additional information embedded in the object), NFTs can be tailored to reference and represent a wide range of assets in both digital and physical worlds. The blockchain’s immutability, proof of transfer and data transparency (information on the blockchain is generally publicly available to view) provide functions akin to those of a notary, such as ensuring the integrity and permanence of records. However, it is important to recognize that it does not replicate the full scope of legal authority and personal verification typically associated with notarial services. Nevertheless, proposals exist to further develop blockchain infrastructure, potentially expanding its use as a notarial mechanism in certain applications.

=== Use-case in practice ===
The New York State Bar Association has stated that blockchain technology can be employed &quot;to hold and secure records to land deeds&quot; John Morton, attorney at Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman told &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot; that NFTs &quot;operate &quot;in many respects exactly like a deed would in real estate transactions&quot;

=== Legality around NFTs as deeds (or similar property rights vehicles) ===
While instances like the house sales in South Carolina and Florida have demonstrated the practical application of NFTs functioning like land deeds in real estate, the legal framework surrounding such transactions remains in a state of development. As of now, the use of blockchain and NFTs to serve a deed-like purpose, as in real estate, operates in a legal gray area, with no direct legal statutes explicitly supporting or regulating this method of property transfer. This emerging field continues to evolve, with legal experts, industry stakeholders, and legislators examining the implications and potential need for regulatory measures. The future of NFTs as a deed or similar vehicle of property rights, therefore, represents a dynamic intersection of technology, law, and property rights, warranting close observation and study as it progresses.

<text>A coat is typically an outer garment for the upper body, worn by any gender for warmth or fashion. Coats typically have long sleeves and are open down the front, and closing by means of buttons, zippers, hook-and-loop fasteners (AKA velcro), toggles, a belt, or a combination of some of these. Other possible features include collars, shoulder straps, and hoods.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Coat&quot; is one of the earliest clothing category words in English, attested as far back as the early Middle Ages. (&quot;See also&quot; Clothing terminology.) The Oxford English Dictionary traces &quot;coat&quot; in its modern meaning to , when it was written &quot;cote&quot; or &quot;cotte&quot;. The word coat stems from Old French and then Latin &quot;cottus.&quot; It originates from the Proto-Indo-European word for woolen clothes.

An early use of &quot;coat&quot; in English is coat of mail (chainmail), a tunic-like garment of metal rings, usually knee- or mid-calf length.

== History ==
The origins of the Western-style coat may be traced to the sleeved, close-fitted and front-fastened coats worn by the scythian nomads of the eurasian steppes, though this style of coat may be much older, having been found with four-thousand-year-old Tarim mummies and in five-thousand-year-old mummy of Otzi The medieval and renaissance coat (generally spelled &quot;cote&quot; or &quot;cotte&quot; by costume historians) is a mid-length, sleeved outer garment worn by both men and women, fitted to the waist and buttoned up the front, with a full skirt in its essentials, not unlike the modern coat.

By the eighteenth century, overcoats had begun to supplant capes and cloaks as outerwear in Western fashion. Before the Industrial Revolution, which began in the second half of the eighteenth century, the extremely high cost of cloth meant certain styles of clothing represented wealth and rank, but as cloth became more affordable post-industrialization, people within a lower social class could adopt the fashionable outdoor wear of the wealthy elite, which, notably, included a coat. In the nineteenth century, the invention of the sewing machine paired with existing textile machinery increased the affordability of mass-produced, ready-to-wear clothing and helped spur the popularity of wearing coats and jackets. By the mid-twentieth century the terms &quot;jacket&quot; and &quot;coat&quot; became confused for recent styles; the difference in use is still maintained for older garments.

==Coats, jackets and overcoats==

In the early nineteenth century, Western-style coats were divided into under-coats and overcoats. The term &quot;under-coat&quot; is now archaic but denoted the fact that the word &quot;coat&quot; could be both the outermost layer for outdoor wear (overcoat) or the coat is worn under that (under-coat). However, the term &quot;coat&quot; has begun to denote just the overcoat rather than the under-coat. The older usage of the word &quot;coat&quot; can still be found in the expression &quot;to wear a coat and tie&quot;, which does not mean that wearer has on an overcoat. Nor do the terms &quot;tailcoat&quot;, &quot;morning coat&quot; or house coat denote types of overcoat. Indeed, an overcoat may be worn over the top of a tailcoat. In tailoring circles, the tailor who makes all types of coats is called a &quot;coat maker&quot;. Similarly, in American English, the term &quot;sports coat&quot; is used to denote a type of jacket not worn as outerwear (overcoat) (&quot;sports jacket&quot; in British English).

The term &quot;jacket&quot; is a traditional term usually used to refer to a specific type of short under-coat. Typical modern jackets extend only to the upper thigh in length, whereas older coats such as tailcoats are usually of knee length. The modern jacket worn with a suit is traditionally called a &quot;lounge coat&quot; (or a &quot;lounge jacket&quot;) in British English and a &quot;sack coat&quot; in American English. The American English term is rarely used. Traditionally, the majority of men dressed in a &quot;coat and tie&quot;, although this has become gradually less widespread since the 1960s. Because the basic pattern for the stroller (black jacket worn with striped trousers in British English) and dinner jacket (tuxedo in American English) are the same as lounge coats, tailors traditionally call both of these special types of jackets a &quot;coat&quot;.

An overcoat is designed to be worn as the outermost garment worn as outdoor wear; while this use is still maintained in some places, particularly in Britain, elsewhere the term &quot;coat&quot; is commonly used mainly to denote only the overcoat, and not the under-coat. A &quot;topcoat&quot; is a slightly shorter overcoat, if any distinction is to be made. Overcoats worn over the top of knee length coats (under-coats) such as frock coats, dress coats, and morning coats are cut to be a little longer than the under-coat so as to completely cover it, as well as being large enough to accommodate the coat underneath.

The length of an overcoat varies: mid-calf being the most frequently found and the default when current fashion is not concerned with hemlines. Designs vary from knee-length to ankle-length, briefly fashionable in the early 1970s and known (to contrast with the usurped mini) as the &quot;maxi&quot;.

Speakers of American English sometimes informally use the words &quot;jacket&quot; and &quot;coat&quot; interchangeably.

== Types ==
=== Eighteenth and nineteenth centuries ===
==== Men&#x27;s ====
Some of these styles are still worn. Note that for this period, only coats of the under-coat variety are listed, and overcoats are excluded.
==== Women&#x27;s ====

=== Modern ===

The terms &quot;coat&quot; and &quot;jacket&quot; are both used around the world. The modern terms &quot;jacket&quot; and &quot;coat&quot; are often used interchangeably as terms, although the term &quot;coat&quot; tends to be used to refer to longer garments.

<text>The Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge is a 5,484 acre (22 km2) wildlife refuge in Crittenden County, Arkansas, managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.

Wapanocca National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1961 from land acquired from the former &quot;Wapanocca Outing Club&quot; which was a prestigious hunting club formed in 1886. The refuge is located 3 miles (5 km) west of the Mississippi River near the city of Turrell, Arkansas.

The refuge was once a bend in the Mississippi River. It is a migration stopover for warblers and other neo-tropical birds. The refuge is host to the blue heron, and the common egret as well as the bald eagle. The refuge is a major stopover on the Mississippi Flyway. Wapanocca consists of 600 acres (2.4 km2) of open water, 1,800 acres (7 km2) of swampland, 500 acres (2.0 km2) of bottomland hardwood, 1,200 acres (4.9 km2) of cropland, and 400 acres (1.6 km2) of grassland.

<doc id="339776" wikidata="Q833490" url="?curid=339776" title="Liberty (personification)">
<text>The concept of liberty has frequently been represented by personifications, often loosely shown as a female classical goddess. Examples include Marianne, the national personification of the French Republic and its values of , and the female Liberty portrayed in artworks, on United States coins beginning in 1793, and many other depictions. These descend from images on ancient Roman coins of the Roman goddess Libertas and from various developments from the Renaissance onwards. The Dutch Maiden was among the first, re-introducing the cap of liberty on a liberty pole featured in many types of image, though not using the Phrygian cap style that became conventional. The 1886 Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;) by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi is a well-known example in art, a gift from France to the United States.

==Ancient Rome==

The ancient Roman goddess Libertas was honored during the second Punic War (218 to 201 BC) by a temple erected on the Aventine Hill in Rome by the father of Tiberius Gracchus. In a highly political gesture, a temple for her was raised in 58 BC by Publius Clodius Pulcher on the site of Marcus Tullius Cicero&#x27;s house after it had been razed. When depicted as a standing figure, on the reverse of coins, she usually holds out, but never wears, a , the soft cap that symbolised the granting of freedom to former slaves. She also carries a rod, which formed part of the ceremony for manumission. In the 18th century, the turned into the similar Phrygian cap carried on a pole by English-speaking &quot;Liberty&quot; figures, and then worn by Marianne and other 19th-century personifications, as the &quot;cap of liberty&quot;.

Libertas had been important under the Roman Republic, and was somewhat uncomfortably co-opted by the empire; it was not seen as an innate right, but as granted to some under Roman law. Her attribute of the pileus appeared on the Ides of March coin of the assassins of Julius Caesar, defenders of the Roman republic, between two daggers with the inscription &quot;EID MAR&quot; (&quot;Eidibus Martiis&quot; – on the Ides of March).

==Early modern period==


The medieval republics, mostly in Italy, greatly valued their liberty, and often use the word, but produce very few direct personifications. One exception, showing just the cap of liberty between daggers, a copy of coins by the assassins of Julius Caesar, featured on a medal struck by Lorenzino de&#x27; Medici to commemorate his assassination of his cousin Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, Duke of Florence in 1547. Liberty featured in emblem books, usually with her cap; the most popular, the &quot;Iconologia&quot; of Cesare Ripa, showed the cap held on a pole by the 1611 edition. 

With the rise of nationalism and new states, many nationalist personifications included a strong element of liberty, perhaps culminating in the &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot;. The long poem &quot;Liberty&quot; by the Scottish James Thomson (1734), is a lengthy monologue spoken by the &quot;Goddess of Liberty&quot;, &quot;characterized as British Liberty&quot;, describing her travels through the ancient world, and then English and British history, before the resolution of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 confirms her position there. Thomson also wrote the lyrics for &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;, and the two personifications were often combined as a personified &quot;British Liberty&quot;.

A large monument, originally called the &quot;Column of British Liberty&quot;, now usually just the &quot;Column to Liberty&quot;, was begun in the 1750s on his Gibside estate outside Newcastle-on-Tyne by the hugely wealthy Sir George Bowes, reflecting his Whig politics. Set at the top of a steep hillock, the monument itself is taller than Nelson&#x27;s Column in London, and topped by a bronze female figure, originally gilded, carrying a cap of liberty on a pole. In other images, she took the seated form already very familiar from the British copper coinage, where Britannia had first appeared in 1672, with shield but carrying the cap on a rod as a liberty pole, rather than her usual trident.

In the run up to the American War of Independence, this conflated figure of Britannia/Liberty was attractive to American colonists agitating for the full set of British civil rights, and from 1770 some American newspapers adopted her for their masthead. When war broke out, the Britannia element quickly disappeared, but a classical-looking Liberty still appealed, and was now sometimes just labelled &quot;America&quot;. In the 1790s Columbia, who had been sometimes present in literature for some decades, emerged as a common name for this figure. Her position was cemented by the popular song &quot;Hail, Columbia&quot; (1798). 

By the time of the French Revolution the modern type of imagery was well-established, and the French figure acquired the name of Marianne from 1792. Unlike her predecessors, she normally wore the cap of Liberty on her head, rather than carrying it on a pole or lance. In 1793 the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral was turned into a &quot;Temple of Reason&quot; and, for a brief time, the Goddess of Liberty replaced the Virgin Mary on several altars.

The Great Seal of France, applied to the official copies of legislation, had a Marianne with Phrygian cap of liberty from 1792, until she was replaced the next year by a Hercules after Jacques-Louis David. A standing Liberty, with fasces and cap on a pole, was on the seal of Napoleon&#x27;s French Consulate, before being replaced by his head. Liberty returned to the seal with the French Second Republic in 1848, seated amid symbols of agriculture and industry, designed by Jacques-Jean Barre. She carries fasces on her lap, now wears a radiant crown with seven spikes or rays, and leans on a rudder. After a gap with the Second French Empire, a version of the 1848 design was used by the French Third Republic and under subsequent republics to the present day. The radiant crown, never used in antiquity for Libertas (but for the sun god Sol Invictus and some later emperors), was adopted by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi for the &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot;. This was conceived in the 1860s, under the French Second Republic, when Liberty no longer featured on the seal or in French official iconography. The Great Seal&#x27;s rudder was another original borrowing from classical iconography. In Roman art it (called a gubernaculum) was the usual attribute of Fortuna, or &quot;Lady Luck&quot;, representing her control of the changeable fortunes of life.

As well as such dignified representations, all these figures very frequently figured in the political cartoons that were becoming extremely popular in all the countries concerned over this period. The Napoleonic Wars produced a particular outpouring of cartoons on all sides.

In the 19th century various national personifications took on this form, some wearing the cap of liberty. The Dutch Maiden, accompanied by the Leo Belgicus became the official symbol of the Batavian Republic established after the French occupied the Netherlands.

== Depictions in the United States ==
In the United States, &quot;Liberty&quot; is often depicted with five-pointed stars, as they appear on the American flag, usually held in a raised hand. Another hand may hold a sword which points downward. Depictions which are familiar to Americans include the following:

* The Statue of Liberty (&quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot;), its replicas, and its portrayal on many U.S. postage stamps and coins
* Many denominations of American coins have depicted Liberty in both bust side-view and full-figure designs; see also the Liberty dollar, Seated Liberty dollar, Liberty dime, Walking Liberty half dollar, Indian Head cent, Morgan dollar, Silver Eagle, Gold Eagle, American Innovation dollar, and others
* The flags of the States of New York and New Jersey (along with various signs and public-owned items bearing the Seal of New Jersey)
* On the dome of the U.S. Capitol as &quot;Freedom&quot;
* On the dome of the Georgia State Capitol as &quot;Miss Freedom&quot;
* On the dome of the Texas State Capitol
* On the dome of the Wisconsin State Capitol as &quot;Wisconsin&quot;
* On the dome of the Allen County Courthouse in Fort Wayne, Indiana
* On the dome of the Bergen County Courthouse in Hackensack, New Jersey
* Atop the Yorktown Victory Monument on the Yorktown Battlefield near Yorktown, Virginia
* On both Union and Confederate currency

In the early decades of the 20th century, Liberty mostly displaced Columbia, who was widely used as the national personification of the US during the 19th century.

<doc id="339779" wikidata="Q97360440" url="?curid=339779" title="Sophomore">
<text>In the United States, a sophomore ( or ) is a person in the second year at an educational institution; usually at a secondary school or at the college and university level, but also in other forms of post-secondary educational institutions. In high school a sophomore is equivalent to a tenth grade or Class-10 student.

In sports, &quot;sophomore&quot; may also refer to a professional athlete in their second season. In entertainment, television series in their second season may be referred to as sophomore shows, while actors and musicians experiencing their second major success may be referred to as sophomore artists. 

==High school==
The 10th grade is the second year of a student&#x27;s high school period (usually aged 15–16) and is referred to as sophomore year, so in a four year course the stages are freshman, &quot;sophomore&quot;, junior and senior.

In &quot;How to Read a Book&quot;, the Aristotelean philosopher and founder of the &quot;Great Books of the Western World&quot; program Mortimer Adler says, &quot;There have always been literate ignoramuses, who have read too widely, and not well. The Greeks had a name for such a mixture of learning and folly which might be applied to the bookish but poorly read of all ages. They are all &#x27;sophomores&#x27;.&quot; This oxymoron points at the Greek words σοφός (&#x27;wise&#x27;) and μωρός (&#x27;fool&#x27;).

High-school sophomores are expected to begin preparing for the college application process, including increasing and focusing their extracurricular activities. Students at this level are also considered to be developing greater ability for abstract thinking.

==Tertiary education ==
The term sophomore is also used to refer to a student in the second year of college or university studies in the United States; typically a college sophomore is 19 to 20 years old. Sophomores generally work on completing general education requirements and might declare their major if they are allowed. College sophomores are also advised to begin thinking of career options and to get involved in volunteering or social organizations on or near campus.
