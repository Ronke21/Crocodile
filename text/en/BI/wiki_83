<text>Falkirk ( ; ; ) is a town in the Central Lowlands of Scotland, historically within the county of Stirlingshire. It lies in the Forth Valley, northwest of Edinburgh and northeast of Glasgow.

Falkirk had a resident population of 32,422 at the 2001 UK Census. The population of the town had risen to 34,570 according to a 2008 estimate, making it the 20th most populous settlement in Scotland. Falkirk is the main town and administrative centre of the Falkirk council area, which has an overall population of 156,800 and inholds the nearby towns of Grangemouth, Bo&#x27;ness, Denny, Camelon, Larbert and Stenhousemuir, and the cluster of Braes villages.

The town is at the junction of the Forth and Clyde and Union Canals, a location which proved key to its growth as a centre of heavy industry during the Industrial Revolution. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Falkirk was at the centre of the iron and steel industry, underpinned by the Carron Company in nearby Carron. The company made very many different items, from flat irons to kitchen ranges to fireplaces to benches to railings and many other items, but also carronades for the Royal Navy and, later, manufactured pillar boxes and phone boxes. Within the last fifty years, heavy industry has waned, and the economy relies increasingly on retail and tourism. Despite this, Falkirk remains the home of many international companies like Alexander Dennis, the largest bus production company in the United Kingdom. Falkirk has a long association with the publishing industry. The company now known as Johnston Press was established in the town in 1846. The company, now based in Edinburgh, produces the &quot;Falkirk Herald&quot;.

Attractions in and around Falkirk include the Falkirk Wheel, The Helix, The Kelpies, Callendar House and Park and remnants of the Antonine Wall. In a 2011 poll conducted by STV, it was voted as Scotland&#x27;s most beautiful town.

==History==
&quot;An Eaglais Bhreac&quot; is a derivative formed from the Scottish Gaelic cognate of the first recorded name &quot;Egglesbreth&quot; from the Brittonic for &quot;speckled church&quot;, presumably referring to a church building built of many-coloured stones. The Scottish Gaelic name was calqued into Scots as &quot;Fawkirk&quot; (literally &quot;variegated church&quot;), then later amended to the modern English name of &quot;Falkirk&quot;. The Latin name &quot;Varia Capella&quot; also has the same meaning. Falkirk Old Parish Church stands on the site of the medieval church, which may have been founded as early as the 7th century.

The Antonine Wall, which stretches across the centre of Scotland, passed through the town and remnants of it can be seen at Callendar Park. Similar to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall but built of turf rather than stone so less of it has survived, it marked the northern frontier of the Roman Empire between the Firth of Forth and Firth of Clyde during the AD 140s. Much of the best evidence of Roman occupation in Scotland has been found in Falkirk, including a large hoard of Roman coins and a cloth of tartan, thought to be the oldest ever recorded. A Roman fort was confirmed to be found by Geoff Bailey in the Pleasance area of Falkirk in 1991. A Roman themed park at Callendar House was awarded lottery funding to help raise awareness of the wall.

In the 18th century the area was the cradle of Scotland&#x27;s Industrial Revolution, becoming the earliest major centre of the iron-casting industry. James Watt cast some of the beams for his early steam engine designs at the Carron Iron Works in 1765. The area was at the forefront of canal construction when the Forth and Clyde Canal opened in 1790. The Union Canal (1822) provided a link to Edinburgh and early railway development followed in the 1830s and 1840s. The canals brought economic wealth to Falkirk and led to the town&#x27;s growth. Through time, trunk roads and motorways followed the same canal corridors through the Falkirk area, linking the town with the rest of Scotland. Many companies set up work in Falkirk due to its expansion. A large brickworks was set up at this time, owned by the Howie family. During the 19th century, Falkirk became the first town in Great Britain to have a fully automated system of street lighting, designed and implemented by a local firm, Thomas Laurie &amp; Co Ltd.
===Battles of Falkirk===
Two important battles have taken place at Falkirk:
*The Battle of Falkirk fought on 22 July 1298, saw the defeat of William Wallace by King Edward I of England.
*The Battle of Falkirk Muir took place on 17 January 1746, the Jacobites under Charles Edward Stuart defeated a government army commanded by Lieutenant General Henry Hawley.

==Government and politics==
In terms of local government the town sits at the heart of Falkirk Council area, one of the 32 unitary authorities of Scotland formed by the Local Government etc (Scotland) Act 1994. The headquarters of the council are located in the Municipal Buildings, adjacent to the former FTH Theatre, on West Bridge Street in the centre of town. The council was the first local government in Scotland to be governed by the Labour Party, in 1921. It has been led by a Scottish National Party minority since 2017. The current Leader of the council is Cllr Cecil Meiklejohn.

Falkirk is located within the Scottish parliamentary constituency of Falkirk West which elects one Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) under the first past the post system. The current MSP is Michael Matheson, who won the seat at the 2007 Scottish Parliament General Election. The previous MSP, Dennis Canavan, who sat as an Independent, was elected with the largest majority in the Scottish parliament representing Falkirk&#x27;s electorate&#x27;s displeasure with New Labour, but stepped down in 2007 for family reasons. Canavan, who announced in an open letter to his constituents in January 2007, that he was stepping down from representative politics at the Scottish Parliament election, 2007 had been an MSP or MP for the area for over 30 years. The constituency of Falkirk West also sits in the Central Scotland Scottish Parliament electoral region which returns seven MSPs under the additional member system used to elect Members of the Scottish Parliament.

In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the town is entirely contained within the UK parliamentary constituency of Falkirk which elects one member to the House of Commons under the plurality system. The constituency also takes in surrounding villages and is currently represented by Euan Stainbank of the Scottish Labour Party. Traditionally, Falkirk had been seen as a stronghold for the Labour Party.

Prior to Brexit in 2020 it was part of the pan-Scotland European Parliament constituency which elected six Members of the European Parliament (MEP)s using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Geography==

Falkirk is located in an area of undulating topography between the Slamannan Plateau and the upper reaches of the Firth of Forth. The area to the north of Falkirk is part of the floodplain of the River Carron. Two tributaries of the River Carron - the &quot;East Burn&quot; and the &quot;West Burn&quot; flow through the town and form part of its natural drainage system. Falkirk sits at between 50 metres (164 ft) and 125 metres (410 ft) above sea level.

The underlying geology of the town of Falkirk is characterised by glacial deposits. Elevations above are covered by a mixture of glacial till and boulder clay with low-lying areas covered by sandy soils and loams. As Falkirk is not far from the coast, post-glacial features akin to raised beaches are particularly predominant to the north of the town centre, and this gives rise to differing elevations within the town.

Unsorted glacial till gives rise to such features of glacial deposition as eskers, and drumlins which are predominant over much of the area. Such elements provide natural transport routes and it is this complex underlying geology that the town is built upon.

===Climate===
Like much of the rest of Scotland, Falkirk has a temperate maritime climate, which is relatively mild despite its northerly latitude. Winters are especially mild given that Moscow and Labrador lie on the same latitude, with daytime temperatures rarely falling below . Summer temperatures are comparatively cool, with daily upper maxima rarely exceeding . The proximity of the town to the sea mitigates any large variations in temperature or extremes of climate. The prevailing wind direction is from the south-west, which is associated with warm, unstable air from the Gulf Stream that gives rise to rainfall. Winds from an easterly direction are usually drier but colder. Rainfall is distributed fairly evenly throughout the year. Vigorous Atlantic depressions - sometimes called European windstorms can affect the town between October and March. The highest recorded temperature was 31.5C in August 2010.

==Demography==
The United Kingdom Census 2001 identified the town as having a total resident population of 32,422. The population was estimated at 34,570 in 2008 which makes the town the 20th most populous settlement in Scotland. The wider Falkirk area which includes Grangemouth, Larbert and Stenhousemuir has an overall population of 98,940 making this the 5th largest urban area after Glasgow, Edinburgh, Aberdeen and Dundee. The population of the town and surrounding area is forecast to grow over the next ten years, primarily due to net in migration from other parts of Scotland and the UK. Unemployment in the Falkirk area is low at 2.5%, below the Scottish average, but average household income and gross weekly pay are below the comparative Scottish and UK averages.

==Economy==

Today, the economy of Falkirk is focused on retail and services, in contrast to the heavy industries and manufacturing sectors which contributed to the growth of the town over the last 300 years. Falkirk is a large retail centre catering to the town itself and a wide surrounding area, stretching from Cumbernauld in the west to Bo&#x27;ness in the east. The retailer Marks and Spencer opened a store in Falkirk Town Centre in 1936 but this closed in 2018 (the building is now a creative arts space). The High Street was pedestrianised in the late 1980s, and the Howgate Shopping Centre opened in April 1990. Another shopping centre, Callendar Square was opened in 1993 but finally closed in 2020. A number of supermarkets including Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Scottish Co-op have developed on peripheral sites surrounding the town centre since the late 1990s.

The public sector and public services also have a foothold in the Falkirk area. Falkirk Council is one of the largest employers in this sphere, with a workforce of over 7,000, many based at the council headquarters in the town centre. One of the principal offices of the UK Child Support Agency, covering Scotland and the north east of England, is located in the Callendar Business Park on the outskirts of Falkirk. Similarly the National Health Service (NHS) and Department for Work and Pensions have a presence in the town and employ local residents.

Many Falkirk residents are also employed within the petrochemicals sector based in neighbouring Grangemouth where there is an of such industries underpinned by the Ineos (formerly BP) oil refinery located there. Alexander Dennis, one of the world&#x27;s largest bus manufacturers, is headquartered in Falkirk with the operations plant located nearby.

==Culture==
Falkirk hosted a national arts festival which ran in Callendar Park from 2000 to 2009 called Big In Falkirk. After its inception in 2000, the festival won Scottish Thistle Award for Events &amp; Festivals in 2005. Consisting of a free weekend of events, the festival was one of the largest cultural events in Scotland, attracting over 100,000 people. Hosted in Falkirk&#x27;s historical Callendar Park, the venue covers with Callendar House as the focal point, the entertainment featured a wide variety of outdoor theatre, pyrotechnic displays, arts, comedy and big name music acts, alongside activities for all ages.

Falkirk hosted the Royal National Mòd in 2008. The Gold medals were won by Falkirk resident Lyle Kennedy and Kerrie Finlay from Inverness. Interest in Gaelic has grown in Falkirk since the Mòd and there are now five Gaelic organisations active in the Falkirk area: An Clas Gàidhlig (provides Gaelic lessons to adults), An Comunn Gàidhealach Meur na h-Eaglaise Brice (is the local branch of An Comunn Gàidhealach), Fèis Fhoirt (provides traditional music and Gaelic song tuition for children and adults), Falkirk Gaelic Forum (promotes Gaelic in Falkirk) and Falkirk Junior Gaelic Choir (is a long established and successful youth choir).

===Recreation===

===Health===
Falkirk is administered by NHS Forth Valley, this includes the unitary authorities of Falkirk, Stirling and Clackmannanshire. Following the opening of the new Forth Valley Royal Hospital, the Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary was renamed Falkirk Community Hospital with many of the main services, including the accident and emergency unit being transferred. Falkirk Community Hospital will still provide many services like podiatry and palliative care. The Community Hospital continues to have a Minor Injury Unit, to treat emergency cases of a non life-threatening nature. In-patient and community services at Bonnybridge Hospital will re-locate to Falkirk Community Hospital in 2012, once new modern, en-suite accommodation has been developed.
A new purpose-built dental centre, Langlees Dental Centre, provides a &quot;teach and treat&quot; dental centre in the Langlees area of Falkirk opened in August 2009. It has seven dental surgeries and is involved in training final year students at Glasgow Dental School.

The Falkirk Wheel, the only rotary canal connector in the world, is located within Falkirk. The attraction was completed in 2002 and it connects the Forth and Clyde Canal to the Union Canal.

On Falkirk High Street lies the Falkirk Steeple. The current building was built in 1814 and is protected as a category A listed building. A stylised image of the steeple appears on the crest of Falkirk Football Club. The Steeple is widely regarded as the centre point of the town. Nearby, on Cow Wynd is the Tattie Kirk, a Category B listed octagonal former church built in 1804, adjacent to its former graveyard.

The FTH Theatre (the &quot;Falkirk Town Hall Theatre&quot;) in West Bridge Street was commissioned to replace the old town hall in Newmarket Street which was demolished in 1968. In 2022, it was announced that the Town Hall and FTH Theatre would close as the building required significant renovation. In 2023, it was announced that the council would purchase the empty former Callendar Square shopping centre. The centre is due to be demolished in 2024 with a view to constructing a combined new town hall, theatre, library and civic space for Falkirk.

<text>In visual art, mixed media describes artwork in which more than one medium or material has been employed.
Assemblages, collages, and sculpture are three common examples of art using different media. Materials used to create mixed media art include, but are not limited to, paint, cloth, paper, wood and found objects.

Mixed media art is distinguished from multimedia art which combines visual art with non-visual elements, such as recorded sound, literature, drama, dance, motion graphics, music, or interactivity.

== History of mixed media ==
The first modern artwork to be considered mixed media is Pablo Picasso&#x27;s 1912 collage &quot;Still Life with Chair Caning&quot;, which used paper, cloth, paint and rope to create a pseudo-3D effect. The influence of movements like Cubism and Dada contributed to the mixed media&#x27;s growth in popularity throughout the 20th century with artists like Henri Matisse, Joseph Cornell, Jean Dubuffet, and Ellsworth Kelly adopting it. This led to further innovations like installations in the late 20th century. Mixed media continues to be a popular form for artists, with different forms like wet media and markings being explored.

== Types of mixed media art ==
Mixed media art can be differentiated into distinct types, some of which are:

Collage: This is an art form which involves combining different materials like ribbons, newspaper clippings, photographs etc. to create a new whole. While it was a sporadic practice in antiquity, it became a fundamental part of modern art in the early 20th century, due to the efforts of Braque and Picasso.

Assemblage: This is a 3-dimensional variant of the collage with elements jutting in or out of a defined substrate, or an entirely 3-D arrangement of objects and/or sculptures.

Found object art: These are objects that are found and used by artists and incorporated into artworks because of their perceived artistic value. It was popularized by the conceptual artist Marcel Duchamp.

Altered books: This is a specific form where the artist will reuse a book by modifying/altering it physically for use in the work. This can involve physically cutting and pasting pages to change the contents of the book or using the materials of the book as contents for an art piece.

Wet and Dry Media: Wet media consists of materials such as paints and inks that use some sort of liquidity in their usage or composition. Dry materials (such as pencils, charcoal, and crayons) are lacking this inherent liquidity. Using wet and dry media in conjunction is considered mixed media for its combination of inherently differing media to create a finalized piece.

Expansion is a mixed media sculpture by Paige Bradley which combined bronze and electricity. The Expansion sculpture is thought to be the first bronze sculpture to be illuminated from within.

== Examples of mixed media artwork ==
&quot;Still Life with Chair Caning&quot;: Picasso&#x27;s piece depicts what can be seen as a table with a cut lemon, a knife, a napkin and a newspaper among other discernible objects. It is elliptical (with speculation that the work itself could be depicting a porthole) and uses a piece of rope to form its edge. Paper and cloth are used for the objects present on the table.

&quot;Angel of Anarchy&quot;: Eileen Agar&#x27;s 1937 sculpture is a modified bust of Joseph Bard, which was covered by paper and fur. When this was lost, she made a 1940 variation which shrouded and blinded the figure with feathers, beads and cloth creating an entirely different perspective on the sculpture.

<text>Justin Charles Pierce (March 21, 1975 – July 10, 2000) was an American actor and skateboarder. Born in London and raised in New York City, Pierce had a troubled childhood and pursued skateboarding. His breakthrough came with the controversial coming of age drama film &quot;Kids&quot; (1995), which won him the Independent Spirit Award for Best Breakthrough Performance. He then starred in the independent film &quot;A Brother&#x27;s Kiss&quot; (1997) and the stoner comedy film &quot;Next Friday&quot; (2000). His final film &quot;Looking for Leonard&quot; (2002) was released posthumously.

As a skateboarder, Pierce was a member of the original Zoo York and Supreme teams. He married stylist Gina Rizzo in 1999. He committed suicide on July 10, 2000.

==Early life==
Pierce was born in London, England, and raised in the Marble Hill and Kingsbridge sections of New York City. His mother met his Australian father while abroad, and never told him who he was. Pierce stole cigarettes and food, and frequently skipped school in favor of skateboarding before dropping out.

== Career ==
While skateboarding in Washington Square Park, Pierce was discovered by film director Larry Clark, who cast him as Casper, a profane drug-addicted skateboarder, in his coming of age drama film &quot;Kids&quot;. On multiple accounts, Pierce &quot;would get really fucked up, drunk, and get arrested&quot; and &quot;get into fistfights&quot; with co-star Leo Fitzpatrick during filming. &quot;Kids&quot; premiered at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival, and experienced commercial success with a theatrical release that same year. The film garnered a significant amount of controversy, but was a surprise blockbuster and Pierce&#x27;s breakthrough role. Mike Domski of &quot;MovieWeb&quot; called his talent &quot;indisputable&quot; and &quot;The Guardian&quot; believed he was the &quot;best placed for a successful follow-on career.&quot; He won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Breakthrough Performance in 1996.

In 1995, Pierce became a member of the original Supreme Crew with fellow Zoo York team riders and close friends Harold Hunter and Peter Bici. Footage of Pierce and the Supreme Crew skateboarding appeared on the Supreme New York website in 1996. He also joined the original Zoo York skateboard team, and is featured in the Zoo York &quot;Mixtape&quot; video (1998), as well as various magazines and adverts for the company.

Pierce appeared in the 1997 film &quot;A Brother&#x27;s Kiss&quot; as the younger version of Nick Chinlund&#x27;s character Lex. The independent production was directed by Seth Zvi Rosenfeld, who said Pierce &quot;was always prepared and a natural actor… He had an old soul, but underneath his tough street exterior was a really sweet kid.&quot; Also in 1997, he starred in the television film &quot;First Time Felon&quot; with Omar Epps. He next filmed the comedy &quot;Pigeonholed&quot; alongside Rosanna Arquette and Marianne Hagan, which was released in 1999. He starred alongside Ice Cube and Mike Epps in the 2000 film &quot;Next Friday&quot;, as Roach. Though the film was negatively received by critics, it was a commercial success.

Pierce&#x27;s last on-screen credits were appearing in 2 episodes of &quot;Malcolm in the Middle&quot; and the Canadian crime drama &quot;Looking for Leonard&quot;, which released posthumously in 2002 and is dedicated to Pierce. Following his death, Supreme featured unused photographs of Pierce by Ari Marcopoulos in its clothing lines and publications.

== Personal life ==
Pierce was continually arrested for possession of marijuana and heroin. He relocated to Los Angeles after being cast in &quot;Kids&quot;. In 1999, he married stylist Gina Rizzo in Las Vegas.

== Death ==
On July 10, 2000, Pierce was found hanging in his room at the Bellagio Hotel in Paradise, Nevada by hotel security. His death was ruled a suicide, and suicide notes were reportedly found but not released to the public. A Catholic memorial service for Pierce was held at St. Patrick&#x27;s Old Cathedral in Manhattan that same month. He is buried in the Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York.

<doc id="353282" wikidata="Q1248667" url="?curid=353282" title="Jon Moss">
<text>Jonathan Aubrey Moss (born 11 September 1957) is an English drummer, best known as a member of the 1980s pop group Culture Club. He has also played with other bands, including London, the Nips, the Damned and Adam and the Ants.

==Early life==

At Highgate School, Moss developed a fascination for sports, especially boxing, but he did not want a professional sporting career. It was also at Highgate that he formed his first band, Pig Williams, along with his friend Nick Feldman (who would later co-found Wang Chung). Together they performed at several school events. After finishing high school, Jon held various jobs, including working at his father&#x27;s clothing store, as a cake salesman and as a sound engineer at Marquee Studios. In spite of regarding a college education as a waste of time, he briefly considered the idea of studying Greek at the University of Cambridge.

==Career==
===Beginning (1976–1980)===
Alongside his friend Riff Regan, Moss joined the punk band London in 1976, after being tried out as a drummer with the Clash; later, he said &quot;The mix of personalities didn&#x27;t work. Their attitudes were too different to mine.&quot; London released a single entitled &quot;Everyone&#x27;s a Winner&quot;, and were managed by Simon Napier-Bell. Eventually they recorded two singles, a four-track EP and an album for MCA Records in 1977. Following this, Moss went on tour with established punk group the Stranglers, and the band got a record deal.

Soon afterward, Moss began drumming with the Damned, replacing Rat Scabies. He made the decision to join them after he was injured in a car crash on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1977, suffering injuries that led to a week&#x27;s hospital stay. Along with the Damned&#x27;s guitarist, Lu Edmonds, he left the Damned to form new wave band the Edge. After just over a year, the Edge broke up.

Moss played with Adam and the Ants on their third single &quot;Cartrouble&quot; and its b-side &quot;Kick!&quot;. At the time, Moss was under contract with a group called Jane Aire &amp; the Belvederes; therefore, he was credited on the original single under the pseudonym &quot;Terry 1 &amp; 2&quot;. In 1980, he played with the last incarnation of The Nips (formerly The Nipple Erectors).

===Culture Club – early times (1981–1986)===
Moss was advised by a friend that Boy George was looking for a drummer for his band. When he became a member of the band—which was originally called in Praise of Lemmings—he suggested changing the name of the group to Culture Club.

In 1985, while still performing with Culture Club, he produced some tracks for the band Woyeyeh.
===Other works and Culture Club reunion (1987–2002)===
After Culture Club broke up in 1986, Moss released a single entitled &quot;Jump to It&quot; with the group Heartbeat UK.

In 1989, under the name Rubberman, Moss released one white label record of an acid house instrumental track. Boy George used that backing track to create his own song &quot;After the Love&quot;.

During 1991 and 1992, Moss was involved in another group, Promised Land, with his schoolfriend Nick Feldman. The two released two singles, &quot;Something in the Air&quot; and &quot;Circle in the Square&quot;.

In 1995 he met Sebastian Wocker, vocalist of the indie band Yeah, and soon joined them. For two years the group played several concerts on the London circuit, made various television appearances and filmed one video, &quot;Engerland&quot;, in 1997, at the former home of Hendon F.C.

===Charities, B-side projects (2003–2010)===
From 2003 to 2005 Moss joined several punk rock and rock bands, among them Fassbender, DanMingo and Dirth. In July 2005 he played drums on the charity single &quot;People I Don&#x27;t Know Are Trying to Kill Me&quot;, written by the journalist Neil McCormick, to help the families of the victims of the 7 July 2005 London bombings.

In 2006 Moss, Mikey Craig and Phil Pickett tried to launch Culture Club on a new tour with another lead singer, as George and Roy Hay had declined to tour. A UK tour was announced for December 2006, but was postponed to give the new line-up time to finish recording their album. Without official press statements, band manager Tony Gordon said in 2007 that the project was &quot;on hold&quot;, while Jon stated that the project was shelved.

===Culture Club – reunion (2011–2021)===
Moss did not appear at Culture Club&#x27;s concerts in Dubai and Sydney in December 2011, due to a back injury which required surgery. Despite rumours that the reunion project had been shelved, Boy George said in a March 2012 interview with Danny Baker on BBC Radio 5 that their new album would be released in 2013.

Meanwhile, Moss had been drumming with Mad Dog Bites, alongside Martin French (vocals), Godfrey Old (harmonica), Peter Noone (bass) and Conrad Blakemore (guitar).

In the Red Nose Day &#x27;13 at Whiteleys, Moss sang with the Rock Choir, helping them to raise funds for Comic Relief.

In 2014, Culture Club began recording a new album that was originally named &quot;Tribes&quot;. The &quot;Tribes&quot; sessions were recorded in Spain and documented in the film &quot;From Karma to Calamity&quot; which aired on BBC Four. In July 2018, it was announced that the sessions had been reworked as &quot;Life&quot; and that the album was to be released on 26 October 2018 and credited to &quot;Boy George and Culture Club&quot;.

In early 2018 Moss formed pop band Ridiculous together with singer-songwriter Sebastian Wocker, The Cross bassist Peter Noone and film score composer Erran Baron Cohen. The band&#x27;s debut performance took place at The Dublin Castle, Camden, London.

Culture Club toured the US and Europe from June to December 2018 in support of their &quot;Life&quot; album, along with supporting acts the B-52s, Tom Bailey (formerly of the Thompson Twins) and Belinda Carlisle (Europe dates only). Moss was originally part of the line-up, but was replaced by Garrison Brown.

In December 2019, Moss filed a writ at London&#x27;s High Court naming the band trio as defendants. Moss&#x27; lawyers say he was told to &quot;take a break&quot; by manager Paul Kemsley; Moss demanded nearly £200,000 in missing payments and a share of profits.

Moss officially left Culture Club in May 2021.

==Personal life==
Moss grew up with his brother David Moss, who went on to become an IT teacher at Stoke College independent school.

Moss has three children with his former wife, Barbara Savage.

Moss had an intimate relationship with Boy George during the height of Culture Club&#x27;s popularity, although it was not public knowledge at the time. Their affair came to an end in 1986. The relationship was portrayed in &quot;Worried About the Boy&quot;, a drama film shown on BBC2.

<text>Eduard Ambrosis dze Shevardnadze (; 25 January 1928 – 7 July 2014) was a Soviet and Georgian politician and diplomat who governed Georgia for several non-consecutive periods from 1972 until his resignation in 2003 and also served as the final Soviet minister of foreign affairs from 1985 to 1990.

Shevardnadze started his political career in the late 1940s as a leading member of his local Komsomol organisation. He was later appointed its Second Secretary, then its First Secretary. His rise in the Georgian Soviet hierarchy continued until 1961 when he was demoted after he insulted a senior official. After spending two years in obscurity, Shevardnadze returned as a First Secretary of a Tbilisi city district, and was able to charge the Tbilisi First Secretary at the time with corruption. His anti-corruption work quickly garnered the interest of the Soviet government and Shevardnadze was appointed as First Deputy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Georgian SSR. He would later become the head of the internal affairs ministry and was able to charge First Secretary (leader of Soviet Georgia) Vasil Mzhavanadze with corruption.

He served as First Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party (GPC) from 1972 to 1985, which made him the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of Georgia. As First Secretary, Shevardnadze started several economic reforms, which would spur economic growth in the republican uncommon occurrence in the Soviet Union because the country was experiencing a nationwide economic stagnation. Shevardnadze&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign continued until he resigned from his office as First Secretary.

In 1985, Mikhail Gorbachev appointed Shevardnadze to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs. He served in this position, except for a brief interruption between 1990 and 1991, until the fall of the Soviet Union. During this time, only Gorbachev would outrank Shevardnadze in importance in Soviet foreign policy. Shevardnadze was responsible for many key decisions in Soviet foreign policy during the Gorbachev era, and was seen by the outside world as the face of Soviet reforms such as Perestroika.

In the aftermath of the Soviet Union&#x27;s collapse in 1991, Shevardnadze returned to the newly independent Republic of Georgia, after being asked to lead the country by the Military Council, which had recently deposed the country&#x27;s first president, Zviad Gamsakhurdia. In 1992 Shevardnadze became the leader of Georgia (as Chairman of Parliament). He was formally elected as president in 1995. Under his rule, the peace treaty was signed in Sochi, which ended military hostilities in South Ossetia, although Georgia lost effective control over a large part of the territory. In August 1992 the war broke out in Abkhazia, which Georgia also lost. Shevardnadze also headed the government in the civil war in 1993 against pro-Gamsakhurdia forces, which did not recognize Shevardnadze as a legitimate leader and tried to regain power. Shevardnadze signed Georgia up to the Commonwealth of Independent States, in return receiving help from Russia to end the conflict, although Georgia also deepened its ties with the European Union and the United States. It joined the Council of Europe in 1999 and declared its intention to join NATO in 2002. Shevardnadze oversaw large-scale privatization and other political and economic changes. His rule was marked by rampant corruption and accusations of nepotism. Allegations of electoral fraud during the 2003 legislative election led to a series of public protests and demonstrations colloquially known as the Rose Revolution. Eventually, Shevardnadze agreed to resign. He later published his memoirs and lived in relative obscurity until he died in 2014.

==Early life and career==
Eduard Shevardnadze was born on 25 January 1928, in Mamati in the Transcaucasian SFSR, which was a constituent republic of the Soviet Union. His father Ambrose was a teacher and a devoted communist and party official. His mother had little respect for the communist government and opposed both Shevardnadze&#x27;s and his father&#x27;s party careers. Eduard was a cousin of the Georgian painter and intellectual Dimitri Shevardnadze, who was purged under Joseph Stalin. In 1937, during the Great Purge, his father was arrested but was later released because of the intervention of an NKVD officer who had been Ambrose&#x27;s pupil.

In 1948 at the age of twenty, Shevardnadze joined the Georgian Communist Party (GCP) and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). He rose steadily through the ranks of the Georgian Komsomol and after serving a term as Second Secretary, he became its First Secretary. During his Komsomol First Secretaryship, Shevardnadze met Mikhail Gorbachev for his first time. Shevardnadze said he grew disillusioned with the Soviet political system following Nikita Khrushchev&#x27;s &quot;Secret Speech&quot; to the 20th CPSU Congress. Like many Soviet people, Shevardnadze was horrified by the crimes perpetrated by Joseph Stalin, and the Soviet government&#x27;s response to the 1956 Georgian demonstrations shocked him even more. He was demoted in 1961 by the Politburo of the Georgian Communist Party after offending a senior official.

After his demotion Shevardnadze endured several years of obscurity before returning to attention as a First Secretary of a city district in Tbilisi. Shevardnadze challenged Tbilisi First Secretary Otari Lolashvili, and later charged him with corruption. Shevardnadze left party work after his appointment as First Deputy of the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Georgian SSR in 1964. It was his successful attempt at jailing Lolashvili, which got him promoted to the post of First Deputyship. In 1965, Shevardnadze was appointed Minister of Internal Affairs of the Georgian SSR. After initiating a successful anti-corruption campaign supported by the Soviet government, Shevardnadze was voted as Second Secretary of the Georgian Communist Party. Shevardnadze&#x27;s anti-corruption campaign increased public enmity against him. However, these campaigns garnered the interest of the Soviet government, and in turn, his promotion to the First Secretaryship after Vasil Mzhavanadze&#x27;s resignation.

In 1951, Shevardnadze married Nanuli Shevardnadze, whose father was killed by the authorities at the height of the purge. At first, Nanuli rejected Shevardnadze&#x27;s marriage proposal, fearing that her family background would ruin Shevardnadze&#x27;s party career. These fears were well justified; many other couples died for the same reason. Between 25 July 1972 and 29 September 1972, Shevardnadze served as the first secretary of the Tbilisi City Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia.

==First Secretary of the GCP (1972–85)==
Shevardnadze was appointed to the First Secretaryship of the Georgian Communist Party by the Soviet government; he was tasked with suppressing the grey and black-market capitalism that had grown under his predecessor Vasil Mzhavanadze&#x27;s rule.

===Anti-corruption campaigns===
Shevardnadze&#x27;s rapid rise in Soviet Georgia&#x27;s political hierarchy was the result of his campaign against corruption. Throughout most of Shevardnadze&#x27;s leadership, anti-corruption campaigns were central to his authority and policy. By the time Shevardnadze had become leader, Georgia was the Soviet republic most afflicted by corruption. The rule of Vasil Mzhavanadze had been characterised by weak leadership, nepotism, despotism, and bribery pervading the upper echelons of power. In Georgia, corruption had been allowed to thrive, leading to serious deformations in the system; for example only 68 per cent of Georgian goods were exported legally, while the percentage of goods exported legally from other Soviet Republics approached 100 per cent. Shevardnadze rallied support for his anti-corruption campaigns by establishing the Study of Public Opinion. To combat corruption, he engaged in subterfuge; after halting all exports he dressed himself as a peasant and drove a car filled with tomatoes through the border. After his personal subterfuge, the entire Georgian border police was purged. While never proven, it is said that after taking office, Shevardnadze asked all leading officials to show their left hands and ordered those who used Western-produced watches to replace them with Soviet ones. This story portrayed Shevardnadze as an active battler against corruption. His campaign against corruption was largely unsuccessful and when he returned to Georgia in 1992, corruption was still a huge problem.

===Economic policy===
Under Shevardnadze&#x27;s rule, Georgia was one of several Soviet Republics that did not experience economic stagnation, instead experiencing rapid economic growth. By 1974, industrial output had increased by 9.6 per cent and agricultural output had increased by 18 per cent. The shortage economy, which had evolved into a prevalent problem in other parts of the Soviet Union, had nearly disappeared in Georgia. Long food queues in Tbilisi had shortened while those in Moscow had lengthened. Some of Shevardnadze&#x27;s economic policies were adopted nationally by the Soviet government.

In 1973, Shevardnadze launched an agricultural reform in Abasha, popularly referred to as the &quot;Abasha experiment&quot;. This reform was inspired by János Kádár&#x27;s agricultural policy in Hungarian People&#x27;s Republic, which returned agricultural decision-making to the local level of governance. Shevardnadze merged all Abasha agricultural institutions into a single entity and established a new remuneration system. If a farmer fulfilled the five-year plan early, he would be awarded a share of the crops. The policy had a positive effect on the Georgian economy and because of the large increase of agricultural output in Abasha, the reform was introduced elsewhere in the republic. The agricultural reform in Georgia became the model of the nationwide Agricultural-Industrial Organisations established by a decree in 1982.

Shevardnadze took much of the credit for Georgia&#x27;s economic performance under his rule. Seven months before his promotion to the Soviet Foreign Affairs Ministership, Shevardnadze said there were thirty or more economic experiments operating in Georgia, which he said would further democratise the economic management.

===Political experimentation and nationalism===
Shevardnadze was a strong supporter of political reform in the Georgian SSR. He created agencies attached to the Central Committee of the Georgian Communist Party whose main task was studying, analysing and moulding public opinion. These agencies worked closely with Georgia&#x27;s communications networks and media; government ministers and Shevardnadze were regularly interviewed live on television. Shevardnadze criticised flattery in Georgia and said he and his government&#x27;s activities needed to be criticised more often, especially during party congresses. He showed himself, even before Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s rise to power, to be a firm supporter of people&#x27;s democracyi.e. power from below.

Previous Soviet Georgian rulers had given in to nationalist favouritism to the Georgians; Shevardnadze was against this policy of favouritism. Therefore, his nationalistic policy is considered controversial in Georgia. At the 25th Congress of the Georgian Communist Party, Shevardnadze told the congress, &quot;for Georgians, the sun rises not in the east, but in the northin Russia&quot;. Shevardnadze saw &quot;extreme nationalism&quot;, coupled with corruption and inefficiencies within the system, as one of the main obstacles to economic growth. During his rule he condemned what he considered &quot;national narrow-mindedness and isolation&quot; and writers who published works with nationalistic overtones. The 1970s saw an increase in nationalistic tendencies in Georgian society. The 1978 Georgian demonstrations were sparked by the Soviet government&#x27;s decision to amend the Georgian constitution and remove the Georgian language as the sole state language in the republic. While at first standing firm with the Soviet government, Shevardnadze quickly reiterated his position and was able to compromise with the Soviet government and the demonstrators. The Georgian language was kept as the sole official language of the republic and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union passed legislation calling for an increasing level of Russian language training in the non-Russian republics.

There was another problem facing Shevardnadze during the 1978 demonstrations; some leading Abkhaz intellectuals were writing to Leonid Brezhnev in the hope that he would let the Abkhaz Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic secede from Georgia and merge into the Russian SFSR. To halt this development, the Georgian government gave way to concessions made by the secessionists that included establishing an Abkhaz university, the expansion of Abkhaz publications and creating an Abkhaz television station. Shevardnadze proved to be an active supporter of defending minority interests.

===National politics and resignation===
At the 25th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1976, Shevardnadze gave a speech in which he called general secretary Leonid Brezhnev &quot;vozhd&quot; (&quot;leader&quot;), a term previously reserved for Joseph Stalin. His adulation was only surpassed by that of Andrei Kirilenko and Heydar Aliyev. As Yegor Ligachev later said, Shevardnadze never contradicted a general secretary. During Brezhnev&#x27;s last days, Shevardnadze publicly endorsed Konstantin Chernenko&#x27;s candidature for the General Secretaryship and called him a &quot;great theoretician&quot;. However, when it became clear that the secretaryship would not go to Chernenko but to Yuri Andropov, Shevardnadze swiftly revised his position and gave his support to Andropov. Shevardnadze became the first Soviet republican head to offer his gratitude to the newly elected leader; in turn, Andropov quickly signalled his appreciation and his support for some of the reforms pioneered by Shevardnadze. According to Andropov&#x27;s biographers the anti-corruption drive he launched was inspired by Shervardnadze&#x27;s Georgian anti-corruption campaign. When Andropov died, Shevardnadze again became an avid supporter of Chernenko&#x27;s candidature for the General Secretaryship.

When Chernenko died, Shevardnadze became a strong supporter of Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s leadership candidature. Shevardnadze became a member of the Central Committee (CC) of the CPSU in 1976, and in 1978 was promoted to the rank of non-voting candidate member of the Soviet Political Bureau (Politburo). His chance came in 1985, when the veteran Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrei Gromyko left that post for the largely ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union (official head of state). The &quot;de facto&quot; leader, Communist Party general secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, appointed Shevardnadze to replace Gromyko as Minister of Foreign Affairs, thus consolidating Gorbachev&#x27;s circle of relatively young reformers.

==Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union (1985–91)==
Shevardnadze was a close ally of Gorbachev and was a strong advocate of the reform policies of glasnost and perestroika. He subsequently played a key role in the détente that marked the end of the Cold War. He negotiated nuclear arms treaties with the United States. He helped end the war in Afghanistan, allowed the reunification of Germany, and withdrew Soviet forces from Eastern Europe and from the Chinese border. He earned the nickname &quot;The Silver Fox&quot;.

During the late 1980s as the Soviet Union descended into crisis, Shevardnadze became increasingly unpopular and was in conflict with Soviet hard-liners who disliked his reforms and his soft line with the West. He criticised a campaign by Soviet troops to put down an uprising in his native Georgia in 1989. In protest over the growing influence of hardliners under Gorbachev, Shevardnadze suddenly resigned in December 1990, saying, &quot;Dictatorship is coming&quot;. A few months later, his fears were partially realised when an unsuccessful coup by Communist hardliners precipitated the collapse of the Soviet Union. Shevardnadze returned briefly as Soviet Foreign Minister in November 1991 but resigned with Gorbachev the following month, when the Soviet Union was formally dissolved.

In 1991, Shevardnadze was baptized into the Georgian Orthodox Church.

==President of Georgia (1995–2003)==
===Rise to power===
The newly independent Republic of Georgia elected as its first president a leader of the national liberation movement, Zviad Gamsakhurdiaan academic and writer who had been imprisoned by Shevardnadze&#x27;s government in the late 1970s. However, Gamsakhurdia&#x27;s rule ended abruptly in January 1992, when he was deposed in a bloody coup d&#x27;état. Shevardnadze was appointed Speaker of the Georgian parliament in March 1992 and as speaker of parliament in November; both of these posts were equivalent to that of president. When the presidency was restored in November 1995, he was elected with 70% of the vote. He secured a second term in April 2000 in an election that was marred by widespread claims of vote-rigging.

===Rule===

Shevardnadze&#x27;s career as Georgian President was in some respects more challenging than his earlier career as Soviet Foreign Minister. He faced many enemies, some dating back to his campaigns against corruption and nationalism during Soviet times. Like Gamsakhurdia, Shevardnadze had to deal with Russian-backed violent separatists in the Georgian provinces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. A Georgian Civil War between supporters of Gamsakhurdia and Shevardnadze broke out in western Georgia in 1993 but was ended by Russian intervention on Shevardnadze&#x27;s side and the death of ex-President Gamsakhurdia on 31 December 1993. Shevardnadze survived three assassination attempts in 1992, 1995, and 1998. He escaped a car bomb in Abkhazia in 1992. In July 1993, Shevardnadze narrowly escaped a shelling by Abkhaz separatists in Sukhumi. In August 1995, he survived another car bomb attack outside the parliament building in Tbilisi. In 1998, his motorcade was ambushed by 10 to 15 armed men; two bodyguards were killed.

At the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe Istanbul Summit of November 1999, agreement was reached that the Russian military bases in Georgia would all be evacuated by Russia before 1 July 2001. However, Russian pullout from its military base in Abkhazia remained under question amid Russian backing of Abkhaz separatists against Georgia. The tensions were further exacerbated when Russia accused Georgia of harbouring Chechen guerrillas on Georgia&#x27;s northern border during the Second Chechen War. More friction was caused by Shevardnadze&#x27;s close relationship with the United States, which saw him as a counterbalance to Russian influence in the strategic Transcaucasus region. Under Shevardnadze&#x27;s strongly pro-Western administration, Georgia became a major recipient of U.S. foreign and military aid, signed a strategic partnership with NATO and officially declared an ambition to join NATO in 2002.

At the same time, Georgia suffered badly from the effects of crime and rampant corruption, which were often perpetrated by well-connected officials and politicians. Although Shevardnadze himself was not personally corrupt and lived a fairly modest life, he was increasingly unwilling or unable to tackle corruption at the highest levels. All his closest advisers, including several members of his family, exerted disproportionate economic power and became visibly wealthy. Transparency International&#x27;s corruption index listed Georgia as one of the most corrupt countries in the world.

According to Spanish prosecutor José Grinda González, Georgian mafia led by Dzhaba Iosselani during the 1990s took control of the country and state and then later led by Zakhariy Kalashov during Shevardnadze&#x27;s rule. Since April 2006, Khachidze or Lasha Shushanashvili also imparted influence on Georgia as well as Tariel Oniani from Kutaisi near South Abkhazia.

===Downfall===
On 2 November 2003, Georgia held a parliamentary election that was widely denounced as unfair by international election observers. The outcome sparked fury among many Georgians, leading to mass demonstrations in Tbilisi and elsewhere, called the Rose Revolution. Protesters broke into parliament on 22 November as the first session of the new Parliament was beginning, forcing President Shevardnadze to escape with his bodyguards. On 23 November, Shevardnadze met with the opposition leaders Mikheil Saakashvili and Zurab Zhvania to discuss the situation in a meeting arranged by Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. After this meeting, Shevardnadze announced his resignation, declaring that he wished to avert a bloody power struggle &quot;so all this can end peacefully and there is no bloodshed and no casualties&quot;. Shevardnadze&#x27;s resignation as President of Georgia was the end of his political career.

==Death and funeral==
Shevardnadze spent his last years living quietly at his mansion house in the outskirts of Tbilisi. As his health deteriorated, his involvement in public life became much reduced. After a long illness, he died at the age of 86 on 7 July 2014.

Georgia&#x27;s former president Giorgi Margvelashvili and Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili extended condolences to his family members. Margvelashvili described him as &quot;one of the distinguished politicians of the 20th century, who participated in dismantling of the Soviet system&quot;. He added, &quot;He was also playing a serious role in creation of new Georgia and in development of our western course&quot;. Garibashvili said Shevardnadze&#x27;s &quot;contribution was especially important in establishing Georgia&#x27;s geopolitical role in the modern world. Eduard Shevardnadze was a politician of international significance, who made a great contribution to end the Cold War and to establish new world order.&quot; Former President Mikheil Saakashvili, who overthrew Shevardnadze in the 2003 Rose Revolution, offered condolences and said Shevardnadze was &quot;a significant figure for the Soviet empire and for post-Soviet Georgia&quot;. Saakashvili said his government did not start a criminal prosecution against Shevardnadze, despite calls by some politicians and parts of society, out of &quot;respect to the President&#x27;s institution&quot;.

Among others, Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry offered condolences. Kerry credited Shevardnadze with playing &quot;an instrumental role&quot; in bringing about the end of the Cold War, a reduction of &quot;the risk of nuclear confrontation&quot; as the Soviet Union&#x27;s Foreign Minister, ensuring &quot;the sovereignty and territorial integrity of [Georgia] during the 1990s&quot; as President of Georgia and putting the country &quot;on its irreversible trajectory toward Euro-Atlantic integration&quot;.

Shevardnadze was accorded a state funeral on 13 July 2014, which was attended by the Georgian political leaders and foreign dignitaries, including the former US Secretary of State James Baker and former German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher. After a service at the Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi, Shevardnadze was buried next to his late wife Nanuli Shevardnadze at the Krtsanisi residence in Tbilisi.

<text>Catherine of Sweden, Katarina av Vadstena, Catherine of Vadstena or Katarina Ulfsdotter (c. 1332 – 24 March 1381) was a Swedish noblewoman. She is venerated as a saint in the Roman Catholic Church. Her father was Ulf Gudmarsson, Lord of Ulvåsa, and her mother was Saint Bridget of Sweden (known as Birgitta Birgersdotter of Finsta in her lifetime).

==Life==
At the age of twelve or thirteen she married Lord Eggert van Kyren, a religious young nobleman of German descent, whom she persuaded to take a vow of absolute chastity, and both lived in a state of virginity. Catherine accompanied her mother to Rome in 1349 and soon upon arrival heard news of her husband&#x27;s death.

She stayed on with her mother, accompanied her on several journeys, including one to the Holy Land. At the death of Bridget, Catherine returned to Sweden with her mother&#x27;s body, which was buried at the monastery of Vadstena. Catherine became head of the Brigittine convent at Vadstena Abbey, founded by her mother. Catherine took on the task of forming the community in the rule her mother had written and directing the Order of the Holy Savior, or Bridgettines. Later, she returned to Rome to work for her mother&#x27;s canonization. She stayed there five years and formed a close friendship with Catherine of Siena. She was spurred by a vision to visit the Holy Land in 1372, and she died soon after her return to Rome.

==Sainthood==
In 1484, Pope Innocent VIII gave permission for Catherine&#x27;s veneration as a saint and her feast was assigned to 22 March in the Roman Martyrology. Catherine is generally represented with a hind (female red deer) at her side, which is said to have come to her aid &quot;when unchaste youths sought to ensnare her&quot;.

In 1488, Pope Innocent VIII gave permission for the translation of her relics in Vadstena. The formal beatification and canonization process, which also documented the required miracles, was never completed because of the Protestant Reformation.

In the Church of Sweden the feast of St. Catherine (Katarinamäss) is celebrated on 2 August.

<text>Człuchów (, &quot;Człochòwo&quot;, or &quot;Człëchòwò&quot;; ) is a town in the region of Gdańsk Pomerania, northern Poland, with 13,350 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is the capital of Człuchów County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

== Location ==

Człuchów lies in a forested area in the southwest of the Pomeranian Voivodeship, at the intersection of Highway 25 from Koszalin to Bydgoszcz and Highway 22 from Gorzów Wielkopolski to Elbląg. The nearest city is Chojnice, to the east. There are four lakes within the town limits: Urzędowe, Miejskie, Miejskie Małe, Rychnowskie.

==History==

Human settlement in Człuchów dates back to prehistoric times. Several traces of the Lusatian and Pomeranian cultures were discovered during archaeological excavations within the town limits. The territory became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century under its first historic ruler Mieszko I. By the beginning of the 13th century Człuchów was a small settlement located at the intersection of two trade routes. In 1312 the Teutonic Knights purchased the settlement for 250 silver marks from Nicholas of Poniec, a son of the voivode of Kalisz. The Order began constructing a fortress known as Schlochau on a hill east of the settlement; the fortress, the Order&#x27;s second-largest after Marienburg (Malbork), was completed in 1367. By 1323 it was used as a komturei (bailiwick) by the crusaders and consisted of three support buildings and the main castle. The fortress was so well-developed that Grand Master Heinrich von Dusemer granted the town Kulm law in 1348. In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the town to the Kingdom of Poland, and then the Teutonic Knights renounced any claims in the peace treaty of 1466. Człuchów was a county seat in the Pomeranian Voivodeship. The seat of local starosts was located in the castle. Many Jews immigrated to the town afterward, creating an enclosed Jewish quarter in the north of the town.

Encouraged by the Polish starosta Latal and the town&#x27;s German-speaking populace, Człuchów converted to Lutheranism in 1550 during the Protestant Reformation. During the Counter-Reformation and encouraged by the Polish government, the town&#x27;s main church was reclaimed by Catholics in 1609. By the end of the 16th century Człuchów had 45 houses. In the mid-17th century starost Jakub Wejher renovated the castle and founded the Baroque Saint James church.

From 1655-57 during the Swedish invasion of Poland, known as the Deluge, the previously impregnable castle was captured by the Kingdom of Sweden and the town was heavily damaged.

In 1770 Człuchów had 135 houses. The town was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland in 1772 and was referred to as &quot;Schlochau&quot;, while fires in 1786 and 1793 destroyed numerous houses. King Frederick William II of Prussia allowed the usage of bricks from the castle during the rebuilding of the town, leaving the castle only with its keep. After the administrative reorganization of Prussia in 1818, Schlochau became the seat of Landkreis Schlochau in the Regierungsbezirk Marienwerder in the Province of West Prussia. Between 1826-28 the town&#x27;s Protestant community built its chapel, which included the castle&#x27;s keep as a church tower. The town began to grow economically after the completion through Schlochau of &quot;Reichsstraße 1&quot;, a roadway from Berlin to Königsberg. The town also received a boost to its development after the opening of a railway from Neustettin (Szczecinek) to Konitz (Chojnice) in 1878. Schlochau&#x27;s main street was illuminated by 1844 and businesses began to be established near the easterly-located train station. The town&#x27;s hospital was established by 1865 and the district&#x27;s (savings bank) opened in 1871, the year Schlochau became part of the German Empire.

Resulting from the Treaty of Versailles in 1919 following World War I, Schlochau became part of the German border zone with the Second Polish Republic, whose began east of the town. This negatively impacted the town&#x27;s trade and economy as it was cut off from much of its hinterland (East and West Prussia), although Schlochau&#x27;s population grew through immigrants from Pomeranian lands restored to Poland. In the 1920s new outlying settlements began to develop from the influx of immigrants, and the town developed a sports center and a district museum. By 1937 Schlochau had a mill, a sawmill, and a population of 6,029 by 1939.

After 1922 the town belonged to the Province of Posen-West Prussia, but with that province&#x27;s dissolution in 1938 Schlochau became part of Province of Pomerania. In that year the Nazis built a center for 600 members of the Hitler Youth. During World War II, the Polish resistance conducted espionage of German activity in the town. The Germans operated a forced labour subcamp of the Stalag II-B prisoner-of-war camp for over 300 Allied POWs. As the Eastern Front grew closer near the end of the war, the town&#x27;s authorities began evacuating Schlochau. The Soviet Red Army reached the district&#x27;s borders by the end of January 1945, but German resistance prevented them from capturing Schlochau until 17 February 1945, with the town 60% destroyed in the process. Its remaining German-speaking population was expelled to Germany after the war in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement as the town became again part of Poland under its historic Polish name &quot;Człuchów&quot;.

From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively located in the Słupsk Voivodeship.

<text>Sławno (Kashubian: &quot;Słôwno&quot;, ) is a town on the Wieprza river in Middle Pomerania region, north-western Poland, with 12,511 inhabitants (2019). It is the administrative seat of Gmina Sławno, though not part of it. The town is also the capital of Sławno County in West Pomeranian Voivodeship.

Sławno is a railway junction on the major Gdańsk–Szczecin line, with access to secondary importance connections to Darłowo and Korzybie. It is also a stop on the European route E28 running parallel to the south coast of the Baltic Sea between the cities of Koszalin and Słupsk.

==History==

The territory became part of the emerging Polish state under Mieszko I around 967. Since the mid-12th century the Land of Słupsk-Sławno was under the rule of Duke Ratibor I of Pomerania and his descendants, a cadet branch of the Griffin dynasty. From 1190 to 1238 it was the capital of a small eponymous duchy. When the line became extinct about 1227, their estates were the matter of an inheritance conflict between the Griffin Duke Barnim I the Good and Swietopelk II from the Samborid dynasty, who ruled over the adjacent territories of Pomerelia (Gdańsk Pomerania) in the east. Both duchies had previously separated from Poland as a result of the 12th-century fragmentation of Poland (Pomerania in the 12th century, and Pomerelia in the 13th century).

Swietopelk II prevailed, his son Mestwin II, duke in Pomerelia from 1266, however again had to deal with claims raised by the Pomeranian Griffins and also by his brother Wratislaw II. To secure his rule, Mestwin accepted the suzerainty of the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg by the 1269 Treaty of Arnswalde, but later on, in 1282, Mestwin and Polish Duke Przemysł II signed the Treaty of Kępno, which transferred the suzerainty over Gdańsk Pomerania including Sławno to Przemysł II. Upon Mestwin&#x27;s death in 1294, the Samborides became extinct and Sławno was reintegrated with Poland. In 1308 Brandenburg invaded the region and Waldemar of Ascania finally separated Sławno from Pomerelia, which he sold to the Teutonic Order by the 1309 Treaty of Soldin. He nevertheless lost the town to the Griffin duke Wartislaw IV of Pomerania in 1317, whereafter Sławno remained a part of the Griffin-ruled Pomeranian duchies until 1637.

Duke Wartislaw IV enfeoffed Peter von Neuenburg of the Swienca noble family with Sławno, who granted the settlement town rights in 1317. The Gothic St Mary&#x27;s Church was consecrated about 1360. Between 1368 and 1478 Sławno was under the rule of dukes of Słupsk, vassals of the Kingdom of Poland. Later on it was part of the Duchy of Pomerania, until its partition in the 17th century between Sweden and Brandenburg-Prussia. Devastated throughout the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was allotted to the Brandenburg Province of Pomerania by the 1653 Treaty of Stettin.

During World War II, the Polish resistance was active, and Polish underground press was distributed in the town. Sławno suffered heavy destruction during the war. With the defeat of Nazi Germany in 1945, its German population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and it was handed over back to Poland.

From 1975 to 1998, it was administratively located in the Słupsk Voivodeship.

<doc id="353303" wikidata="Q2296499" url="?curid=353303" title="Seventeen (American magazine)">
<text>Seventeen is an American teen magazine headquartered in New York City. The publication targets a demographic of 13-to-19-year-old females and is owned by Hearst Magazines. Established in 1944, the magazine originally aimed to inspire teen girls to become model workers and citizens. However, it soon shifted its focus to a more fashion- and romance-oriented approach while still emphasizing the importance of self-confidence in young women. Alongside its primary themes, &quot;Seventeen&quot; also reports the latest news about celebrities.

==&quot;Seventeen&quot; history==
&quot;Seventeen&quot; was founded by publisher Walter Annenberg, owner of Triangle Publications, based upon a suggestion by editor Helen Valentine. Working from New York, she provided teenaged girls with working-woman role models and information about their personality development and overall growth. &quot;Seventeen&quot; enhanced the role of teenagers as consumers of popular culture. The concept of &quot;teenager&quot; as a distinct demographic originated in that era. In July 1944, King Features Syndicate began running the comic strip &quot;Teena&quot;, created by cartoonist Hilda Terry, in which a typical teenager&#x27;s life was examined. &quot;Teena&quot; ran internationally in newspapers for 20 years.

After &quot;Seventeen&quot; was launched in New York City in September 1944, Estelle Ellis Rubenstein, the magazine&#x27;s promotion director, introduced advertisers to the life of teenaged girls through &quot;Teena&quot;, selling advertising in &quot;Seventeen&quot; at the same time. From 1945 to 1946, the magazine surveyed teen girls to better understand the magazine&#x27;s audience. The magazine became an important source of information to manufacturers seeking guidance on how to satisfy consumer demand among teenagers. Today, the magazine entertains and promotes self-confidence in young women.

Sylvia Plath submitted nearly 50 pieces to &quot;Seventeen&quot; before her first short story, &quot;And Summer Will Not Come Again&quot;, was accepted and published in the August 1950 issue.

Joyce Walker became the first black model to be featured on the cover of &quot;Seventeen&quot; in July 1971. In 1981, Whitney Houston was also featured on the cover of the magazine.

New York City-based News Corporation bought Triangle in 1988 and sold &quot;Seventeen&quot; to K-III Communications (later Primedia) in 1991. In 1999 Linda Platzner was named Publisher and then President of the Seventeen magazine group. Primedia sold the magazine to New York City-based Hearst in a process led by Platzner in 2003. &quot;Seventeen&quot; remains popular on newsstands today despite greater competition.

In 2010, writer Jamie Keiles conducted &quot;The Seventeen Magazine Project&quot;, an experiment in which she followed the advice of &quot;Seventeen&quot; magazine for 30 days. In 2012, in response to reader protests against the magazine&#x27;s airbrushing its models&#x27; photos, &quot;Seventeen&quot; ended its practice of using digital photo manipulation to enhance published photographs.

In August 2016, Michelle Tan was fired from her position as editor in chief while she was on maternity leave. It was announced shortly thereafter that Michele Promaulayko, who was appointed editor in chief of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, would also serve as &quot;Seventeen&quot; editorial director. Starting with their Dec/Jan 2017 issue, the magazine was to start publishing only six issues a year instead of ten, in order to focus on their online presence to appeal to the Generation Z market. In October 2018, it was announced that Jessica Pels would take over from Promaulayko as Editor-in-chief of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;, and that Kristin Koch was appointed &quot;Seventeen&#x27;s&quot; new executive director, overseeing all its content. In November 2018, it was announced that &quot;Seventeen&quot;″s print editions would be reduced to special stand-alone issues.

===Petition on image manipulation===
In April 2012, 14-year-old Julia Bluhm from Waterville, Maine, created a petition on Change.org titled &quot;Seventeen Magazine: Give Girls Images of Real Girls!&#x27; advocating for the magazine publication to vow to print at least one unaltered and Photoshop-FREE monthly photo spread&quot;. As a self-proclaimed &quot;SPARK Summit Activist&quot;, Bluhm petitioned for an end to digital photo manipulation.

In May 2012 Bluhm, her mother, and a group of fellow &quot;SPARK Summit&quot; members were invited to the New York headquarters of &quot;Seventeen&quot; by editor-in-chief Ann Shoket.

On 3 July 2012, Bluhm announced that her petition had &quot;won&quot; after receiving almost 85,000 signatures online, resulting in &quot;Seventeen&quot; editorial staff pledging to always feature one photo spread per month without the use of digital photo manipulation. Furthermore, &quot;Seventeen&quot; editor-in-chief Shoket published an editorial praising The Body Peace Treaty in the August 2012 &quot;Seventeen&quot; issue, offering the push against digital photo manipulation as an extension of the magazine&#x27;s ongoing Body Peace Project.

<text>Miastko (; ), is a town in the Middle Pomerania region of northern Poland, administratively located in the Bytów County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

==History==

Traces of human settlement of the Pomeranian and Wielbark cultures and from ancient Roman times and Early Middle Ages were discovered during archaeological excavations in Miastko. The area became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I in the 10th century. Following the fragmentation of Poland, it formed part of various smaller duchies, including the Duchy of Słupsk from 1368 and Duchy of Pomerania from 1478.

From the 18th century, it was part of the Kingdom of Prussia, within which it belonged to the Province of Pomerania. During World War II, the Polish resistance conducted espionage of German activity in the town. The Germans operated three forced labour subcamps of the Stalag II-B prisoner-of-war camp in the town. In January 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied prisoners-of-war from the Stalag XX-B POW camp passed through the town. On 2 March 1945, it was taken by the Red Army.

In April 1945, a Polish operation group of 22 young men arrived in the town to take over administration of the town, while the German population was largely still present. The Potsdam Agreement confirmed preliminary Polish administration of the region and the native German populace was expelled. According to German reports, in January 1947, Germans to be expelled were collected and had to camp in ruined houses at min 25 degrees minus. British authorities of occupied Germany did not receive the expellees, whoh were interned until March 1947 in various internment camps. Of 2500 Germans of a transport scheduled for January 4, 1947, 500 were not to survive the expulsion.

Until 1975, Miastko was a county seat within the Koszalin Voivodeship, and from 1975 to 1998 it was administratively located in the Słupsk Voivodeship.

In 2012 a monument dedicated to the Polish Nation was unveiled in the town park.

<text>Bytów (; ; ) is a town in the Gdańsk Pomerania region of northern Poland with 16,730 inhabitants as of December 2021. It is the capital of Bytów County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship.

In the early Middle Ages a fortified stronghold stood near the town. In 1346 as &quot;Bütow&quot; it obtained Kulm law rights from the Teutonic Order, which controlled it since 1329. During the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466), the town was the site of heavy fighting and changed hands over time. Eventually, King Casimir IV Jagiellon granted the town to Eric II, Duke of Pomerania, as a perpetual fiefdom. After the Partitions of Poland, Bytów became part of the Kingdom of Prussia and later also Germany, within which it remained until the end of World War II. In the final stages of the war Bytów heavily shelled by the Red Army, and more than 55% of the buildings were destroyed.

==History==

According to the city&#x27;s official webpage the name Bytów comes from the founder of the settlement named &quot;Byt&quot;. A settlement was first mentioned by the name of &quot;Butow&quot; in 1321.

The territory became part of the emerging Polish state under its first historic ruler Mieszko I in the 10th century. Bytów passed to the Teutonic Knights in 1329. From 1335 comes the oldest mention of a Catholic parish, which, however, could have existed since the 12th or 13th century. In 1346 it was granted town rights. The castle seen today was built by the Knights between 1399 and 1405 at the site of the older castle, to protect their western border. It has been the seat of an administrator of the State of the Teutonic Knights.

This castle was captured by Poland after the Battle of Grunwald (1410), and king Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland gave it to Bogislaw VIII, Duke of Pomerania, for all of his lifetime as payment for support obtained from him against the Teutonic Knights. In the Peace of Thorn (1411) Bogislaw had to return the castle to the Knights. The town did not join the Prussian Confederation&#x27;s revolt against the Teutonic Knights.

The town alternated between Poland and the monastic state during the Polish-Teutonic Wars, and returned to Polish control after the Second Peace of Thorn (1466). Poland gave Bytów as lien to the Dukes of Pomerania. Since 1526 the Pomerania dukes held it as an inheritable lien.
In 1627 during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the town was rebuilt after being destroyed by a fire. When the Pomeranian dukes died out in 1637 Bytów ceased to be a Polish fief and became directly ruled by Poland, administratively part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship. Then the local nobility obtained equal rights with the nobility of the entire Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Bytów was overshadowed by Lębork, which developed faster and became the seat of local starosts. In 1651 there was a dispute between the city authorities and the starost Jakub Wejher, regarding overdue taxes. To gain an ally against Sweden during the Deluge, in 1657 King John II Casimir of Poland gave the Lauenburg and Bütow Land to Margrave Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia as a hereditary fief in the Treaty of Bydgoszcz. Although Poland still retained sovereignty, the town was administered by Brandenburg and, after 1701, by the Kingdom of Prussia. Brandenburg imposed higher taxes to pay off its debts after the Thirty Years&#x27; War. During the 18th century, the town suffered from fires and plague.

In 1773 in the First Partition of Poland the town was wholly incorporated in the Prussian Province of Pomerania. In the 18th century attempts began at Germanisation of the indigenous Polish-Kashubian population by introducing German into schools. It remained a center of Polish resistance against Germanisation and was a Polish-Kashubian printing center. From 1846 to 1945, Bütow was the seat of the Landkreis Bütow district in Prussia. The town became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany. Polish minority remained active in the city, and in 1910 a Polish Bank Ludowy was founded here.

After the end of World War I and the re-establishment of independent Poland, the Treaty of Versailles kept the town in the Weimar Republic in 1919. There was an economic decline, many Germans emigrated to western Germany, and the population was slowly decreasing. In the interbellum numerous Polish organizations, including the Union of Poles in Germany, operated in the town. Poles were subjected to repressions. The hero of the local Polish population was a local Polish teacher, Jan Bauer, who was arrested by the Germans in 1929. Months before World War II, in 1939, the Germans carried out arrests of notable local Poles, incl. activists and the head of the local Polish bank.

During World War II the Polish population was subject to deportations and executions, two of its leaders, and were imprisoned in Sachsenhausen and Dachau concentration camps, however, the town remained a local center of the Polish resistance movement (Kashubian Griffin). In January 1945, a German-perpetrated death march of Allied prisoners-of-war from the Stalag XX-B POW camp passed through the town. It was captured by the Soviet Red Army on 8 March 1945. Some inhabitants had fled before the Soviet advance. In April 1945, it was put under Polish administration, confirmed after the end of the war by the Potsdam Conference and the Polish name &quot;Bytów&quot; was restored. Those German inhabitants, which had remained in the town or had returned to it short after the war, were later on forcibly expelled and their property seized in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement. The indigenous Polish-Kashubian population was joined by Poles displaced from former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union and from the rest of Kashubia.

Bytów became the seat of a powiat (1946–1975, 1999-) within Poland. From 1975 to 1998 it was administratively part of the Słupsk Voivodeship.

===Kashubian Emigration to America===
Many families from Bytów such as the Brezas and the Pehlers emigrated to the area of Winona, Minnesota in the United States, beginning in 1859. The Prussian policy was to force the Kashubians out to make room for German settlers. Some Kashubians moved across the Mississippi River to Pine Creek, Wisconsin in the early 1860s. Many found jobs in the lumber mills during the lumber boom of the late 1800s occurring in the region.

==Demographics==
Up to the end of World War II most inhabitants of the town were Protestants.

<text>The Woolwich foot tunnel crosses under the River Thames in Woolwich, in East London from Old Woolwich in the Royal Borough of Greenwich to North Woolwich in the London Borough of Newham. The tunnel (open 24/7) offers pedestrians and cyclists an alternative way to cross the river when the Woolwich Free Ferry service is not operating. Both entrances to the tunnel (north entrance at and south entrance at ) are Grade II listed buildings. The south entrance is somewhat hidden behind the Waterfront leisure centre. It is the oldest remaining building in the riverside area of Old Woolwich.

==Construction==

The tunnel was designed by Sir Maurice Fitzmaurice and built by Walter Scott &amp; Middleton for London County Council and opened by Lord Cheylesmore, Chairman of the LCC, on Saturday, 26 October 1912. Its creation owed much to the efforts of working-class politician Will Crooks, who had worked in the docks and, after chairing the LCC&#x27;s Bridges Committee responsible for the tunnel, would later serve as Labour MP for Woolwich.

==Refurbishment==

Greenwich Council started work to upgrade both this tunnel and the Greenwich foot tunnel on 19 April 2010. The works were to reduce leakage, improve drainage and to install new lifts, CCTV, communication facilities and signage, with an original completion date of March 2011. During the works, the tunnel closed on Monday to Friday daytimes, when the Woolwich Free Ferry was available as an alternative crossing.

On 24 September 2010, Greenwich Council closed the Woolwich foot tunnel to all users, due to structural weaknesses discovered in the stairways and tunnel itself. The tunnel was originally expected to reopen in August 2011, but eventually reopened to the public in December 2011, though initially access to the tunnel was only by stairs until final works on the lifts were completed. 

The tunnel has been fitted with a leaky feeder system to permit operation of mobile phones. The tunnel is long and at its deepest, the tunnel roof is about below the river bed.

The ‘Friends of Greenwich and Woolwich Foot Tunnels’ (FOGWOFT) was established in September 2013.

In 2016 the Ethos Active Mobility system was installed in the tunnel to monitor and actively manage tunnel usage. The system uses computer vision to count and measure the speed of bicycles and pedestrians, and displays messages on electronic signs to encourage considerate behaviour. The system has also been installed in the Greenwich foot tunnel and aims to make urban shared spaces safer and more pleasant to use for all. The system displays two messages - &quot;No cycling allowed&quot; (in red text) during busy periods, and &quot;Please consider pedestrians&quot; (in green text) during quiet periods. The shared spaces trial was supported by Greenwich council but Tower Hamlets refused permission to update the bylaws and the sign system was discontinued; while some cyclists do ride in the tunnel, cycling is still not permitted.

With a continuing impasse in updating the bylaws, FOGWOFT disbanded in March 2021.

==Usage==
A 2016 survey showed that around 1,000 people use the tunnel each day.

<doc id="353317" wikidata="Q2289754" url="?curid=353317" title="The Lady and the Unicorn">
<text>The Lady and the Unicorn () is the modern title given to a series of six tapestries created in the style of (&quot;thousand flowers&quot;) and woven in Flanders from wool and silk, from designs (&quot;cartoons&quot;) drawn in Paris around 1500. The set is on display in the Musée de Cluny in Paris.

Five of the tapestries are commonly interpreted as depicting the five senses – taste, hearing, sight, smell, and touch. The sixth displays the words . The tapestry&#x27;s intended meaning is obscure, but has been interpreted as representing love or understanding. Each of the six tapestries depicts a noble lady with a unicorn on her left and a lion on her right; some include a monkey in the scene.

== History ==

The famous tapestries were rediscovered in 1841 by Prosper Mérimée at Boussac Castle, then owned by the subprefect of the Creuse. At the time, the tapestries were in poor condition due to improper storage, suffering from dampness and mould. In 1844, the novelist George Sand encountered the tapestries and brought them to public attention, notably through her novel &quot;Jeanne&quot;, in which she accurately dated them to the late 15th century by analyzing the ladies&#x27; costumes. Despite growing interest, the tapestries remained at risk until 1882, when Edmond Du Sommerard, curator of the Musée de Cluny in Paris, purchased them. Since then, they have undergone meticulous conservation efforts, restoring them nearly to their original splendor. Today, the tapestries are housed at the Musée de Cluny, where they remain on display.

== Content and themes ==

The subject of the tapestries is complex, and scholars &quot;now (generally) agree that they present a meditation on earthly pleasures and courtly culture, offered through an allegory of the senses.&quot;

The pennants, as well as the armor of the unicorn and lion in the tapestry appear to bear the arms of Antoine II or Jean IV Le Viste, Baron of Montreuil, a powerful nobleman in the court of Charles VII of France and presumably its sponsor. The arms, however, appear to break the rules of French heraldry with an incorrect superposition of colors. A very recent study of the heraldry appears to lend credence to another hypothesis (previously dismissed) that the real sponsor of the tapestry was Antoine II Le Viste (1470–1534), a descendant of the younger branch of the Le Viste family and an important figure at the court of Charles VIII, Louis XII and François I.

===Touch===

The &#x27;Touch&#x27; tapestry displays a noble lady standing with one hand touching the horn of a unicorn, and the other holding up a pennant. A lion sits to the side and looks on.

===Taste===

In the &#x27;Taste&#x27; tapestry, the lady takes sweets from a dish held by a maidservant. Her eyes are on a parakeet on her upheld left hand. The lion and the unicorn are both standing on their hind legs, reaching up to pennants that frame the lady on either side. The monkey is at her feet, eating one of the sweetmeats. The animals within the background create an illusive environment.

===Smell===

In the &#x27;Smell&#x27; tapestry, the lady stands, making a wreath of flowers. Her maidservant holds a basket of flowers within her easy reach. Again, the lion and unicorn frame the lady while holding on to the pennants. The monkey has stolen a flower which he is smelling, providing the key to the allegory.

===Hearing===
In the &#x27;Hearing&#x27; tapestry, the lady plays a portative organ on top of a table covered with an Oriental rug. Her maidservant stands to the opposite side and operates the bellows. The lion and unicorn once again frame the scene holding up the pennants. Just as on all the other tapestries, the unicorn is to the lady&#x27;s left and the lion to her right.

===Sight===
In the &#x27;Sight&#x27; tapestry, the lady is seated, holding a mirror up in her right hand. The unicorn kneels on the ground, with his front legs in the lady&#x27;s lap, from which he gazes at his reflection in the mirror. The lion on the left holds up a pennant.
The sixth tapestry is wider than the others, and has a somewhat different style. The lady stands in front of a tent, across the top of which is inscribed her motto, , one of the deliberately obscure and elegant mottos, typically alluding to courtly love, adopted by the nobility during the age of chivalry. It is variously interpreted as &quot;to my only/sole desire&quot;, &quot;according to my desire alone&quot;; &quot;by my will alone&quot;, &quot;love desires only beauty of soul&quot;, and &quot;to calm passion&quot;. These frequently appear on artworks and illuminated miniatures. Her maidservant stands to the right, holding open a chest. The lady is placing the necklace she wears in the other tapestries, into the chest. To her left is a low bench with a dog, possibly a Maltese, sitting on a decorative pillow. It is the only tapestry in which she is seen smiling. The unicorn and the lion stand in their normal spots framing the lady while holding onto the pennants.

This tapestry has elicited a number of interpretations. One interpretation sees the lady putting the necklace into the chest as a renunciation of the passions aroused by the other senses, and as an assertion of her free will. Another sees the tapestry as representing a sixth sense of understanding (derived from the sermons of Jean Gerson of the University of Paris, ). Various other interpretations see the tapestry as representing love or virginity. It is also debated whether the lady in is picking up or setting aside the necklace.

In the first five tapestries, one or more of the animals are shown using the represented sense along with the lady. In &quot;Touch&quot;, the unicorn can presumably feel the lady&#x27;s hand touching its horn; in &quot;Taste&quot;, a monkey is eating a sweetmeat; in &quot;Smell&quot;, the monkey is sniffing a flower; in &quot;Hearing&quot;, the animals presumably all hear the music; and in &quot;Sight&quot;, the unicorn is gazing at itself in a mirror. In the final tapestry, only the women engage with the necklace. The blue tent in the last tapestry also serves to separate the human figures from the natural world, including the mythical unicorn, and is not present in any of the previous tapestries.

<text>The Gdańsk Voivodeship was a voivodeship (province) of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic from 1975 to 1989, and the Third Republic of Poland from 1989 to 1998. Its capital was Gdańsk, and it was centered on the region of Pomerelia. It was established on 1 June 1975, from the parts of the voivodeships of Gdańsk, and Bydgoszcz, and existed until 31 December 1998, when it was incorporated into then-established Pomeranian Voivodeship.

== History ==
The Gdańsk Voivodeship was established on 1 June 1975, as part of the administrative reform, and was one of the voivodeships (provinces) of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic. It was formed from the part of the territory of the Gdańsk Voivodeship, and a one gmina (municipality) of the Chojnice County, Bydgoszcz Voivodeship. Its capital was located in the city of Gdańsk. In 1975, it had a population of 1 249 300 people.

On 9 December 1989, the Polish People&#x27;s Republic was replaced by the Third Republic of Poland. In 1997, the voivodeship had a population of 1 464 800 people, and had an area of 7 394 km2. It existed until 31 December 1998, when it was incorporated into then-established Pomeranian Voivodeship.

== Subdivisions ==

In 1997, the voivodeship was divided into 63 gminas (municipalities), including 16 urban municipalities, 5 urban-rural municipalities, and 42 rural municipalities. It had 21 cities and towns.

From 1990 to 1998, it was additionally divided into eight district offices, each comprising several municipalities.

== Demographics ==
== Leaders ==

<text>Anton Adriaan Mussert (; 11 May 1894 – 7 May 1946) was a Dutch politician who co-founded the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB) in 1931 and served as its leader until the party was banned in 1945. As such, he was the most prominent Dutch leader of the movement before and during World War II. Mussert collaborated with the German occupation government, but was granted little actual power and held the nominal title of &quot;Leider van het Nederlandsche Volk&quot; (&quot;Leader of the Dutch People&quot;) from 1942 onwards. In May 1945, as the war came to an end in Europe, Mussert was captured and arrested by Allied forces. He was charged and convicted of treason, and was executed in 1946.

==Early life==
Mussert was born on 11 May 1894 in Werkendam, in the northern part of the province of North Brabant in the Netherlands. From an early age he showed talent in technical matters and after graduating from school he chose to study civil engineering at the Delft University of Technology. He married his aunt Maria Witlam, his mother&#x27;s sister, in 1917 despite opposition from his mother. In the 1920s, he became active in several far right organisations, such as the &quot;Dietsche Bond&quot; which advocated a Greater Netherlands including Flanders (Dutch-speaking Belgium).

==Foundation of the Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging==

On 14 December 1931, Mussert, Cornelis van Geelkerken, and ten others founded the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (Dutch: &quot;Nationaal-Socialistische Beweging in Nederland&quot;), a Dutch counterpart to the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party. In its early years, the NSB boasted that its membership included several hundred Jews, until the German party directed a more anti-Semitic course.

A 1933 demonstration in Utrecht attracted only 600 supporters. A year later, the NSB rallied 25,000 demonstrators in Amsterdam. The NSB received 300,000 votes in the 1935 parliamentary elections, almost 8% of the national vote. In the 1937 election, it polled a little more than half as much. Thereafter, Mussert worked toward preventing resistance to a German invasion.

==Role during the war==
===1940===
A state of siege was declared by the Dutch government in April 1940 after the foreign correspondent for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Vladimir Poliakov, reported that Mussert&#x27;s followers were preparing to kidnap Queen Wilhelmina as part of a coup.

On 10 May, German troops invaded the Netherlands and Mussert was permitted to suppress all political parties other than the NSB.

Mussert was not appointed prime minister of the occupied nation. Instead, Austrian Nazi Arthur Seyss-Inquart was appointed as the Reichskommissar, while Berlin summoned Mussert to control his uncooperative countrymen. Mussert responded by working with the Gestapo in stopping resistance to the German occupation. On 21 June 1940 Mussert agreed to have NSB members train with the SS-Standarte &#x27;Westland&#x27;. On 11 September, Mussert instructed Henk Feldmeijer to organise the Nederlandsche SS (Dutch SS) as a division of the NSB. Mussert had nothing to do with the raising of an all-Dutch volunteer SS unit, the SS-Freiwilligen-Legion Niederlande. Regardless, thousands of Dutch citizens were arrested.

===1941–1945===
In February 1941, Mussert agreed to and oversaw the formation of the 23rd SS Volunteer &quot;Panzer Grenadier&quot; Division &quot;Nederland&quot;, which trained in Hamburg. In November 1941, the formation was ordered to the Eastern Front near Leningrad, under the overall command of Army Group North. The division acquitted itself well alongside its German allies, but suffered large losses.

On 8 December 1941, the independent Dutch administration in the Dutch East Indies declared war on Japan, the ally of Nazi Germany. After the Japanese invasion and occupation and the subsequent internment of 100,000 Dutch civilians and 50,000 military personnel, Mussert requested a meeting with Hitler. On 13 December 1942, Hitler declared Mussert to be &quot;Leider van het Nederlandse Volk&quot; (Leader of the Dutch People).

Having lost control of the Dutch SS and the military units that were serving in the Wehrmacht to his Nazi masters, Mussert had his last meeting with Hitler in May 1943, where he was told that he would never have political control. Following the unsuccessful Operation Market Garden in September 1944, which included a supporting strike by Dutch railway workers, the German authorities forbade food transport by rail, resulting in the Hongerwinter of 1944/45 during which 18,000 died. Throughout the crisis, Mussert stayed silent for fear of losing what power he had left. By the end of the war, 205,901 Dutch men and women had died. The Netherlands had the highest per capita death rate of all German-occupied countries in Western Europe, 2.36%. Another 30,000 died in the Dutch East Indies, either while fighting the Japanese or in camps as Japanese POWs. Dutch civilians were held in those camps as well.

==Execution==
Upon the surrender of Germany, Mussert was arrested at the NSB office in The Hague on 7 May 1945. He was convicted of high treason on 28 November after a two-day trial, and was sentenced to death on 12 December. He appealed to Queen Wilhelmina for clemency. She refused. On 7 May 1946, exactly one year after his arrest and four days before his 52nd birthday, Mussert was executed by a firing squad on the Waalsdorpervlakte, a site near The Hague, where hundreds of Dutch citizens had been killed by the Nazi regime.

<text>The Musée de Cluny (), officially Musée de Cluny-Musée National du Moyen Âge (), is a museum of medieval art in Paris. It is located in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, bordered by square Samuel-Paty to the south, boulevard Saint-Michel to the west, boulevard Saint-Germain to the north, and rue Saint-Jacques to the east. 

Its building combines Roman-era thermae, the Thermes de Cluny, including a well-preserved frigidarium, and the 15th-century , the Parisian mansion of the Abbey of Cluny. The museum houses one of the largest collections of art from the Middle Ages, consisting of 23,000 items, of which about 2,300 are exhibited. The museum&#x27;s holding including the iconic series of six 15th-century tapestries known as &quot;The Lady and the Unicorn&quot;.

==History==
The Hôtel de Cluny is a rare extant example of the civic architecture of medieval Paris, erected in the late 15th century to replace an earlier structure built by Pierre de Chaslus after the Cluny Abbey acquired the ancient Roman baths in 1340. At that time, the mansion was part of a larger complex that also included a religious college (, no longer extant) on the location of the present-day place de la Sorbonne.

The Cluny mansion was rebuilt under Jacques d&#x27;Amboise, abbot &quot;in commendam&quot; of Cluny 1485–1510, combining Gothic and some early Renaissance elements. D&#x27;Amboise used it while also Bishop of Clermont and Abbot of Jumièges. Later users included Mary Tudor, sister of Henry VIII of England, who resided there in 1515, after the death of her husband Louis XII; James V of Scotland in 1537, on the occasion of his wedding with Madeleine of Valois; and several 17th-century papal nuncios, including Mazarin. In the 18th century, the tower of the Hôtel de Cluny was used as an observatory by astronomers Joseph-Nicolas Delisle, Jérôme Lalande, and Charles Messier who in 1771, published his observations in the Messier catalog. The chapel also housed the printing press of Nicolas-Léger Moutard, official printer of the Queen of France from 1774 to 1792. During the French Revolution in 1789, the mansion was confiscated by the state, and for the next three decades served various purposes, including the use of the former Abbots&#x27; chapel as a dissection room. 

In December 1832, archeologist and art collector Alexandre Du Sommerard bought the Hôtel de Cluny and used it to display his large collection of medieval and Renaissance objects. Upon his death in 1842, the collection was purchased by the French state. The building was opened as a museum in 1843, with Sommerard&#x27;s son Edmond Du Sommerard serving as its first director. The buildings were restored by the architect Albert Lenoir, son of preservationist Alexandre Lenoir. 

The mansion was granted monument historique status in 1846, and the thermal baths were granted that status in 1862. In February 1926, the museum was brought under the aegis of the Louvre&#x27;s department of decorative arts (), from which it was released in 1977. A new museography was created in the late 1940s, with a thematic display of works focusing on different workmanship categories and techniques such as stonework, ironwork, glasswork, etc. A garden opened in 1971, including a &#x27;unicorn&#x27;s forest&quot; inspired by the museum&#x27;s iconic tapestries series of the Lady and the Unicorn. In 1977, the museum&#x27;s Renaissance art collections were transferred to the newly created at the Château d&#x27;Écouen in the northern outskirts of Paris, freeing additional space for medieval artworks. In 1981, a new room was created to present recently rediscovered statuary from Notre-Dame cathedral. In 1992, the display of the Lady and the Unicorn tapestries was redesigned.

In 2011, the French culture ministry initiated a more comprehensive renovation, dubbed &quot;Cluny 4&quot; in a conscious echo of the latest church of Cluny Abbey known as Cluny III. This included a redesign of the Lady and the Unicorn display in 2013; cleaning-up of the Roman baths and medieval chapel in 2015–2017; the construction of a new building designed by architect for ancillary facilities in 2016–2018; and a chronologically reorganized display of medieval art collections, including structural alterations such as a new staircase in the building&#x27;s northeastern corner, conducted from 2019 to 2022. The renovated museum reopened on , for a total cost of 23.1 million euros partly financed by the proceeds of the Louvre Abu Dhabi contract.

== Collections ==
The museum is 11,500 square feet, 6,500 of which are designed for expositions. It contains around 23,000 artifacts dating from the Gallo-Roman period up until the 16th century. There are currently 2,300 artifacts on display. The collections contain pieces from Europe, the Byzantine Empire, and the Islamic world of the Middle Ages.

=== From antiquity to the Early Middle Ages ===

==== L&#x27;Île-de-la-Cité, France ====

Much of the ancient collections can be found in the frigidarium. Here, the visitor can discover artifacts dating as far back as the romanization of the city of Parisii, such as the famous Boatman Pillar from the 1st century. This pillar was offered to the emperor Tiberius by the boatmen of Paris. It contains inscriptions dedicated to the Roman god Jupiter as well as Celtic references, making it a great example of the two cultures melding together on one artifact. It was discovered in the 18th century, under the choir of Notre-Dame de Paris. Another ancient artifact that can be seen in the frigidarium is the Saint-Landry pillar. This pillar was sculpted in the second century on l&#x27;Île-de-la-Cité, and was discovered during the 19th century.

There is more ancient art outside of the frigidarium, including two lion heads made from rock crystal. The lion heads were made between the 4th and the 5th centuries in the Roman Empire. Although their purpose is not known, the most likely hypothesis is that they were made to decorate an imperial throne.

==== Beyond France ====
The Cluny also houses ancient Coptic art. The Coptic fabrics gained notoriety outside of Egypt and certain pieces. The linen medallion of Jason and Medea is kept in the Cluny today.

Between 1858 and 1860, twenty-six Visigoth crowns were discovered (the Treasure of Guarrazar). This was one of the most important discoveries related to the Visigothic Kingdom of Hispania. Of the original twenty-six crowns, there are 10 left today. The remaining crowns have been spread between two museums: the Palacio Real de Madrid and the Cluny. Today, the Cluny holds three of these crowns, as well as crosses, pendants and hanging chains from the same discovery. These items were symbols of royal power and date back to the 7th century. They were most likely offered to the religious establishments in Toledo, the then capital of Spain.
==== Byzantine art ====
Starting with the founding of the city in Constantinople in 330, the emperor Constantine began an era known as the Byzantine period. Between 843 and the fall of the Byzantine empire in 1204, the politics and art of this empire flourished. During this part of the Middle Ages in the West, the Byzantine art was a link to traditional literature, philosophy and Greco-Roman art.

One example is the noteworthy ivory sculpture from Constantinople called Ariane. Ariane dates back to the first half of the 6th century and was most likely produced to adorn a piece of furniture. The statue includes Ariane, fauns and a few Angels of Love. It is one of the most iconic examples of Byzantine ivory work.

Another famous piece of Byzantine ivory found in the Cluny is the plaque that depicts the crowning of Otto II. His father Otto I was crowned king of Rome on February 2, 962. This crowning marks the beginning of a renaissance in this part of Western Europe. Similar to Charlemagne, Otto I later took the title of Emperor Augustus. In 972, the emperor Otto II married the princess Théophano, who became the empress of Rome and can be seen in the ivory plaque as well.

The Cluny also possesses a Byzantine coffer that contains mythological images and was produced around the year 1000. It was at this time that the Macedonian emperors ruled in Constantinople.

=== Romanesque art ===
The term &quot;Roman&quot; art first appeared in 1818. It was used by Charles de Gerville to describe the art that comes after the Carolingian empire, but before Gothic art. Before the 19th century, most of the art from the Middle Ages was referred to as Gothic art. Romanesque art is defined by its use of light and color. The Romanesque artists are masters of volume and contrast. The paintings are relatively simple, focusing on the narrative. From the Romanesque period onward, reliquaries and other religious artifacts were no longer kept in crypts, and instead were displayed on the altars in churches. Visibility of faith was of the utmost importance at this time.

==== In France ====
There are two central elements to Romanesque art: pedagogy and devotion. The evolution of faith is a common theme of these works. One example in the Cluny today is a capital that was made in Paris between 1030 and 1040. Referred to as the Majestic Christ capital, it was created for the Saint-Germain-des-Prés church, the product of a collaboration between two workshops. The Cluny also houses a series of twelve capitals from Saint-Germain-des-Prés made in the beginning of the 11th century.

==== Beyond France ====
The Cluny possesses Romanesque art from other countries as well, such as England, Italy and Spain. One of the more famous examples is the English crosier from the middle of the 12th century. This piece, made from ivory, displays multiple eagles and lions. Another famous work in ivory is the Italian &#x27;Olifant&#x27; from the end of the 11th century. This piece was created from an elephant tusk and depicts the scene of Jesus&#x27; Ascension.

There are also Romanesque art pieces from Catalonia at the Cluny. There is a series of eight capitals that come from the Saint Pere de Rodes church. One of the capitals depicts the Biblical story of Noah and another details the story of Abraham. Another piece from Catalonia is a statue of a female saint made from wood that dating to the second half of the 12th century.

=== Work from Limoges ===
The Cluny houses many pieces from the famous enamel and gold workshops of Limoges. These workshops first started producing pieces in the second quarter of the 12th century. Limoges is located in the southwestern, central part of France; its gold and enameled masterpieces were collected throughout Europe by the end of the 12th century. The goldsmiths and other artists produced varying kinds of products including crosses, shrines, altarpieces, candlesticks and much more. They tended to be religious in nature.

One of the reasons that pieces from these workshops were so successful is because the materials were affordable. As such, they were able to produce in mass. Not only were they producing a lot of products, but products of quality as well. The colors were vivid and the subject matter was depicted with eloquence.

There are many pieces from Limoges at the Cluny today. Most notably are the two copper plaques from around the year 1190. One depicts the image of Saint Étienne and the other portrays the Three Wisemen. These two plaques decorated the main altar at Grandmont Abbey. The adoration of the Three Wisemen was a popular theme in pieces from Limoges and can be found in many of their works. A copper shrine from the year 1200 also depicts this theme.

=== Gothic art from France ===

The 1120s in Paris saw many changes in art and education. One theme that became vitally important in both arenas was the importance of light. The teachings of Plato and his student Platin emphasize the importance of light in the Creation story. This has parallels in changes happening architecturally in Paris at the same time. Supporting beams and arches are thinned to allow more space for windows to allow in more light. The Sainte-Chapelle, with its tall and beautiful stained glass windows, displays this change in architecture. The upper cathedral has 15 window bays that encircle the entire room, each 50 feet tall, giving the illusion that the visitor is surrounded by light.

Artists in 12th century Paris experimented artistically, exploring a new conception of space and the relationship between architecture, sculpture and stained glass, as seen in the Sainte-Chapelle. The Cluny houses many examples of this experimentation, such as &#x27;double&#x27; capitals and statues that function as columns. There is a double capital that depicts two harpies facing each other that comes from the church at Saint-Denis, made between 1140 and 1145. Another artifact from Saint-Denis is the head from a statue-column of Queen Saba. This statue-column was produced in the 12th century.

The Cluny also has one of the most vast collections of stained-glass in France. Their collection includes 230 panels, medallions and fragments from the 12th century to the 14th. Sainte-Chapelle has donated some panels from their iconic stained-glass windows to the Cluny as well, including one panel that depicts the scene of Sampson and the lion.

If the 12th century was all about experimentation, the 13th and 14th centuries in Paris represent artistic maturity. It is at this time that the demand for non-religious art increases. There are two themes that dominate Parisian art in the 13th century: an interest in Antiquity and a new attention given to nature. One of the most famous examples at the Cluny is the statue of Adam made from limestone. Produced around 1260 in Paris, the statue depicts a nude Adam, who is covering himself with the leaves from a small tree. The influence of Antiquity is evident in this work.

Sainte-Chapelle not only donated pieces of stained-glass to the Cluny, but also six statues of apostles made from limestone. These statues were once located on the pillars of the upper chapel in Sainte-Chapelle, but can be seen in the Cluny today. These statues were made in the 1320s and originally came from Saint-Jacques aux Pèlerins. These statues mark the peak of Parisian art from the middle of the 13th century.

=== 15th-century art ===

In the 15th century, the opulence of urban elites encouraged artistic production as the demand for art increased. People began ordering artistic objects for everyday life, such as furniture, tapestries, ceramics, game pieces, etc. It is at this time that Paris became a capital of luxury. Here various artistic movements converged to create an &#x27;international&#x27; gothic style. Artists began to sign their work, no longer desiring to remain anonymous.

This phenomenon is particularly evident in the considerable rise in demand for tapestries. The most famous tapestries at the Cluny today are that of the Lady and the Unicorn (La Dame à la licorne) series. There are six tapestries that make up this collection, each one representing a different sense. There are the five main senses (smell, hearing, taste, touch and sight) and it is the sixth tapestry that depicts the Lady with the Unicorn. The mysterious meaning of this sixth has produced multiple interpretations over the years. The most commonly embraced interpretation understands the Lady as representing It a sixth sense of morality or spirituality, as she puts aside her worldly wealth.

==In popular culture==
Herman Melville visited Paris in 1849, and the Hôtel de Cluny evidently fired his imagination. The structure figures prominently in Chapter 41 of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, when Ishmael, probing Ahab&#x27;s &quot;darker, deeper&quot; motives, invokes the building as a symbol of man&#x27;s noble but buried psyche.

<text>Louise Joy Brown (born 25 July 1978) is an English woman noted as the first human born following conception by in vitro fertilisation (IVF). Her birth, following a procedure pioneered in Britain, has been lauded among &quot;the most remarkable medical breakthroughs of the 20th century&quot;.

==Life==
Brown&#x27;s parents, Lesley and John Brown, had been trying to conceive naturally for nine years but Lesley faced complications from blocked fallopian tubes. On 10 November 1977, Lesley underwent the procedure that later became known as in vitro fertilisation (IVF), developed by Patrick Steptoe, Robert Edwards, and Jean Purdy. Although the media would refer to Brown as a &quot;test tube baby&quot;, her conception actually took place in a Petri dish. Purdy was the first to see Brown&#x27;s embryonic cells dividing.

Louise Joy Brown was born on 25 July 1978 at Oldham&#x27;s General Hospital, via a planned C-section performed by John Webster. She weighed 5 pounds, 12 ounces (2.608 kg) at birth. In 1982, Brown&#x27;s sister Natalie was born after also being conceived through IVF, becoming the world&#x27;s 40th such live birth; in May 1999, Natalie became the first human conceived by IVF to herself give birth, though she did so without IVF.

In 2004, Brown married nightclub doorman Wesley Mullinder; Edwards, the only surviving member from the trio who pioneered IVF, attended their wedding. Their first son, conceived naturally, was born on 20 December 2006. She has since had another child. Brown&#x27;s father died in 2006 at the age of 64, while her mother died in 2012 due to complications from a gallbladder infection, also at the age of 64.

==Recognition==
Brown&#x27;s birth has been lauded as one of the &quot;most remarkable medical breakthroughs of the 20th century&quot;.

Edwards was awarded the 2010 Nobel Prize in Medicine for this work.

In 2022, a plaque was installed on Royal Oldham Hospital to record the importance of Purdy and Sister Muriel Harris to the work.

==Ethical and religious issues==
Although the Browns knew the procedure was experimental, the doctors did not tell them that no case had yet resulted in a baby, prompting questions of informed consent.

In 1978, when asked for his reaction to Brown&#x27;s birth, Cardinal Albino Luciani (who was then the Patriarch of Venice and later became Pope John Paul I) expressed concerns about the possibility that artificial insemination could lead to women being used as &quot;baby factories&quot; but also noted that the Browns simply wanted to have a baby and refused to condemn them.

<doc id="353345" wikidata="Q1182421" url="?curid=353345" title="Deep Springs College">
<text>Deep Springs College (known simply as Deep Springs or DS) is a private junior college in Deep Springs, California. With the number of undergraduates restricted to 26, the college is one of the smallest institutions of higher education in the United States. Though it offers an associate degree, most students transfer into a four-year college after completing their studies. Those enrolled pay no tuition and are given room and board. 

Founded in 1917 as Deep Springs Collegiate and Preparatory, it was originally a men&#x27;s college backed by funding from L. L. Nunn, a lawyer and businessman. Nunn envisioned an unorthodox form of education that combined academic rigor, manual labor, and self-governance. Located in a geological depression, its campus is situated within a cattle ranch with the aim of providing a secluded environment away from urban life so undergraduates may focus on their studies and leadership ability. The college is primarily maintained and self-governed by students, becoming a coeducational institution in 2018.

The college&#x27;s alumni include Rhodes and Truman Scholars, two Pulitzer Prize recipients, three MacArthur Fellows, and winners of an Emmy and Lawrence Award, among multiple academics and congressmen.

==History==

Deep Springs was founded in 1917 by L. L. Nunn, a business magnate who made a fortune building alternating current power plants in the Western United States. Nunn&#x27;s first projects—a hydroelectric plant in Telluride, Colorado, and the Olmsted Power Station in Provo, Utah—served as the foundation for his inspiration to create a new type of educational institution. As it became difficult to find enough engineers capable of living under rough conditions, he began schooling local men and pursued an interest in education. Nunn eventually sold his industrial assets to fund the Telluride Association, an educational trust based at Cornell University, and the Telluride House. After becoming dissatisfied with the association&#x27;s mission, he founded Deep Springs and helped in its administration until his death in 1925.

The establishment of Deep Springs was a reaction to what Nunn saw as a decline in academic standards in traditional American colleges. His philosophy governing Deep Springs focused strictly around the pursuit of &quot;academics, labor, and self-governance&quot;, something he dubbed the &quot;three pillars&quot; which supported the &quot;whole man&quot;. The inclusion of manual labor in a college&#x27;s educational program was unusual in 1917, but a number of so-called manual labor colleges had existed in the United States in the 19th century—including, at one time, Oberlin College, which Nunn attended. By the early 1860s, most had either closed or had abandoned their manual labor programs.

Nunn&#x27;s pillars entailed students playing an active role in the administration of the college by laboring in the field and contributing to student meetings during committees, which Nunn believed was an effective method of producing &quot;leaders for a democratic society&quot;. To this end, the board of trustees, which Nunn established to preserve the college&#x27;s traditions, contained one—later two—seats that were reserved for student trustees, who were elected by the student body and currently remain with full voice and voting rights. Due to his correspondence with these early student bodies, Nunn decided the college would provide student housing and would not include a tuition.

In the 1990s, the school&#x27;s leadership debated transitioning the college to be coeducational. Whereas many women in the Telluride Association advocated for the change, a large portion of the school&#x27;s alumni wished to keep its status as a men&#x27;s college. Though the board of Deep Springs voted against making any change in 1994, in 1998 the college accepted a $1.8 million low-interest loan from Telluride under the condition that Deep Springs would begin admitting women by 2019. In 2011, the college&#x27;s trustees voted to begin accepting female students in the summer of 2013 but became embroiled in legal challenges which were lodged against the trustees&#x27; action. The challengers disputed the authority of the college&#x27;s board to change the admissions policy and included an injunction preventing the college from accepting female students until at least the 2018–2019 academic year. On April 13, 2017, the California Court of Appeal ruled that the college could admit women in &quot;Hitz v. Hoekstra&quot;. With the Supreme Court of California declining to hear an appeal, the board of trustees voted once again to admit women, with the first female students arriving in July 2018.

==Curriculum ==
Deep Springs involves students working on tasks in the on-campus ranch, farm, and boarding house, including &quot;cooking, cleaning, gardening, milking cows, saddling horses, herding cattle, moving hay, butchering chickens, wiring cables, sorting library books, and fixing vehicles&quot; with the academic curriculum dedicated wholly to the liberal arts such as Ancient Greek, philosophy, political science, and literature. Classes are taught by a long-term faculty—the president, dean, and chairs of the natural science and humanities department—and a division of visiting professors and scholars which make up the short-term faculty, neither of which may hold tenure at the College proper. Undergraduates work a minimum of 20 hours a week, rotating tasks while also studying for their classes.

Students attend classes during the morning and spend the afternoon working on the ranch. Though the majority of learning is cooperatively determined between professors and students, taking the form of both in-class seminars and outside of the classroom reading groups and discussions, there are two required courses: freshman composition and public speaking. After graduation, approximately two-thirds of the student body transfer to an Ivy League university or another similarly ranked institution, with a substantial portion going on to attend Cornell University, Brown University or the University of California, Berkeley. 

Self-governance is a critical part of the Deep Springs educational program. Students hold decision-making authority in determinations about admissions, curriculum, and faculty hiring. Every student serves on one of four standing committees during their time as a student: Applications (ApCom), Curriculum (CurCom), Communications (ComCom) or Review and Reinvitations (RCom). The Communications Committee (ComCom) was created in the early 1990s and charged with shaping the policies that define the college&#x27;s relations with the world at large.

==Campus==

Deep Springs College is isolated within Deep Springs Valley, a geological depression between the White and Inyo mountain ranges, with the nearest sizable town being Bishop, California, and the closest commercial airport being in Las Vegas. With the college&#x27;s campus consisting primarily of its ranch, its physical isolation plays a central role in the educational experience. The college also contains a bookstore, post office, and a library, all maintained by students. Partly due to Nunn&#x27;s previous experience closing down a school in Virginia due to students deserting campus, the school&#x27;s &quot;isolation policy&quot; forbids students from leaving the college&#x27;s campus and prohibits the use of alcohol.

Deep Springs used to have a direct telephone line crossing the White Mountains, but difficult maintenance made service unsustainable. The line was replaced in the 1980s by a wireless radio link connecting to the Bishop central office. Because the radio signal is relayed using a repeater station high in the White Mountains, and because the first relay out of Deep Springs Valley does not have line of sight, the system is subject to outages caused by high winds and inclement weather. Previously, the college&#x27;s Internet connection was an unusually slow 14.4 kbit/s data channel multiplexed into the radio link. Not later than 2011, the college connected to the internet by satellite. Deep Springs has an FM radio-based Voice over Internet Protocol phone system, and direct inward dialing.

A small seismic station exists behind the main campus, installed by the former Soviet Union as part of a bi-national underground nuclear test monitoring agreement.

==Alumni==

Despite the small number of admitted students, Deep Springs disproportionately produces members of academia with the majority of graduates going on to receive doctorates. Alumni include multiple scholars, professors, authors, scientists, and members of government. The college&#x27;s alumni have been awarded Rhodes and Truman Scholarships, three MacArthur &quot;genius grants&quot;, two Pulitzer Prizes, one Emmy award, and one E. O. Lawrence Award, among other honors. Prominent alumni include:

<doc id="353348" wikidata="Q1790379" url="?curid=353348" title="Sergei Saltykov">
<text>Count Sergei Vasilievich Saltykov (; c. 1722 – 1784) was a Russian officer (chamberlain) who became the first lover of Empress Catherine the Great after her arrival in Russia.

== Life ==
Saltykov was alleged to be the biological father of Catherine II&#x27;s son, Paul I of Russia, which was implied in Catherine&#x27;s memoirs. It was reported that Paul was &quot;almost certainly the child of [Catherine&#x27;s] lover&quot;. However, Paul greatly resembled his official father Peter III of Russia in character and appearance. There was very little in common between the pugnacious, stocky Paul and tall, handsome Sergei Saltykov. In her memoirs, though, Catherine noted the 
&quot;ugliness&quot; of Saltykov&#x27;s brother.

The Saltykovs were an ancient boyar family that rivaled the Romanovs in prominence. Saltykov was also descended from several branches of the Rurikid and Gediminid dynasties through the female line, as well as from Tatiana Feodorovna, the sister of the first Romanov tsar Michael I. Tsarina Praskovia, the mother of Empress Anna, also came from this clan, although her branch was only distantly related to the grandfather of Sergei.

Sergei&#x27;s wife Matryona Balk was named after her grandmother Modesta Mons, the sister of Anna Mons and Willem Mons. Modesta (better known under her Russian name Matryona) had been publicly whipped in 1718 and exiled to Siberia after Peter the Great had learned about her brother Willem&#x27;s affair with his wife Catherine.

<text>The Ontario Veterinary College (OVC) is the oldest veterinary school in Canada. It is located on the campus of the University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario. The OVC is one of five veterinary schools that offer the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, DVM program in Canada. The program is highly competitive and only admits a select number of applicants each year. The OVC was ranked 1st in Canada and 5th in the world for veterinary medicine by the QS World University Rankings 2020.

==History==
Originally called &quot;Upper Canada Veterinary School&quot;, the Ontario Veterinary College was established in Toronto in 1862, by the Scots Andrew Smith (veterinary surgeon) with some assistance from Duncan McNab McEachran, both graduates of the Royal School of Veterinary Studies at the University of Edinburgh. The college adopted the current name in 1867, the year of Canada&#x27;s Confederation. McEachran was a staff member but he considered the admission standards and academic requirements to be inadequate. He left after three years, moving to Montreal where he helped establish Montreal Veterinary College.

The school&#x27;s first classes took place at 188 King Street West in 1861 and then at Agricultural Hall at Yonge and Queen Streets in 1862. The first permanent site of the school was at Bay Street and Temperance Street in 1870 and University Avenue in 1914. By 1897, the college was affiliated with the University of Toronto and in 1908 it was acquired from Smith by the government of Ontario.

It later moved to Guelph, Ontario (1922) and remained affiliated with the University of Toronto until it became a founding college of the University of Guelph in 1964. 
In 1928 Miss E. B. Carpenter from Detroit was the first woman to graduate from a Canadian veterinary college. She was accepted to the school in 1923, one year after the Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act allowed Miss Aleen Cust to complete her exams at the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. The first woman to graduate from OVC was Dr. G. E. Fritz from New York, the first Canadian woman to graduate from OVC or any other Canadian veterinary college was Jean Rumney in 1939 and the second was Edith Williams in 1941, also a graduate of OVC. Today the majority of Canadian veterinary school graduates are women.

In 1964 it became a founding college of the University of Guelph. The college severed ties with University of Toronto and its principal became the dean of the college. The OVC celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2012.

==About==
The Ontario Veterinary College is the only veterinary college in the province of Ontario, and the oldest of only five current veterinary colleges across Canada. In the 2020 World University Rankings, the Ontario Veterinary College was ranked as the top veterinary school in Canada and 5th in the world. The other four veterinary schools in Canada are at the Université de Montréal, University of Prince Edward Island, the University of Saskatchewan and the University of Calgary. The University of Calgary, which opened in 2008, is the youngest of the five.

==Changes==
In February 2008, OVC was granted $9.5 million from the province of Ontario. The intent was to help the college develop a primary-care teaching hospital for small animals.

The Hill&#x27;s Primary Healthcare Centre opened during the summer of 2010 as a veterinary clinic and an educational facility for all veterinary students. A new state-of-the-art Pathobiology building opened in the fall of 2010. A new large animal isolation facility serves to treat equine patients at high-risk for infectious disease.

In March 2016, the provincial government announced a $23 million grant to add a new building and to renovate the animal hospital. The plan was to add new classrooms and labs, to install new equipment and to improve biosecurity and infection control.

==Campus==
The OVC is located on 213,000 square meters of the University of Guelph campus in Guelph, Ontario. The main OVC building (including classrooms, laboratories, and the Dean&#x27;s Office) is located at the intersection of Gordon St. and College Ave. in Guelph. The Health Science Centre is located at 28 College Ave, and the Animal Health Lab is located at 419 Gordon St. The College also maintains multiple horse fields and stables, a dairy barn, and a large-animal isolation facility within its campus. F

==Academics==
OVC offers a bachelor&#x27;s degree in bio-medical science, but its primary degree offering is the DVM (Doctor of Veterinary Medicine). The College also offers DVSc, PhD, MSc, MPH, and Diploma programs at the graduate level. The DVM program is one of the most competitive in the world. The annual number of places available in the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) program is &quot;120 seats with 105 for Canadians with Ontario residency and 15 for non-Canadians&quot;.

==Student life==

120 student veterinarians are admitted to the school each year after successfully passing the highly competitive application and interview processes. Student veterinarians can usually be found studying in the Lifetime Learning Center, having a coffee in the Pathobiology building, or playing hockey at the Gryphon Center. OVC students are encouraged to join a wide array of clubs and organizations, including Diagnostic Imaging, Parasitology, Surgery, 3D printing club, among others. In Phase One, student veterinarians are invited to a &#x27;Blue Coat Ceremony&#x27;, where they will be gifted their blue lab coats by the university and officially welcomed to the veterinary profession. This signifies the start of their journey to becoming a veterinarian. This event is only trumped by the coveted &#x27;White Coat Ceremony&#x27; at the end of Phase Three. The white coat ceremony signifies a student&#x27;s transition from class-based learning to clinical rotations. A beloved tradition at OVC is the naming of each class with a mascot and a colour. This mascot represents the class throughout the four phases, and is used regularly in conjunction with not only academics, but also intramural sports. Hockey plays a large part in these intramurals, with rivalries coming to a head in a college-wide &quot;Challenge Cup&quot; tournament, held each year in March.

Past Classes have included:
Current Classes are:

*The 2025 Amethyst Orcas
*The 2026 Turquoise Tigers
*The 2027 Emerald Elk
*The 2028 Garnet Grizzlies

==Notable professors==
Dr. W. J. R. Fowler taught equine surgery, materia medica, sporadic diseases, and lameness in horses. Fowler was recognized internationally, and had already taught at Ontario Veterinary College for over 55 years under 5 principles.

Dr. F. W. Schofield taught pathology, parasitology and bacteriology. He was also a missionary, travelling around the world preaching Christianity in his off time.

Dr. Ronald G. Watkin taught bacteriology, milk hygiene, and diseases in poultry. He was an acclaimed research scientist. Ronald retired with Dr. Scofield in 1955.

Principal Charles D. McGilvray was the 3rd principal of the school from 1918 to 1945. He taught contagious diseases, special therapeutics, and sanitary service subjects. He obtained the nickname &quot;Shot-gun Charlie&quot; from his handling of Glanders Disease in Manitoba between 1905 and 1910.

Dr. Scott Weese is a Professor in the Department of Pathobiology at the Ontario Veterinary College, and Chief of Infection Control at the OVC Teaching Hospital. He is a member of the Ontario COVID-19 Science Advisory Table, and a Fellow with the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences (CAHS).

<text>Whitewater kayaking is an outdoor adventure sport where paddlers navigate a river in a specially designed kayak. Whitewater kayaking includes several styles: river running, creeking, slalom, playboating, and squirt boating. Each style offers a different way to experience the thrill and beauty of whitewater environments. Various techniques help paddlers navigate rivers, such as paddle strokes (such as ready position, forward stroke, back stroke, low brace, high brace, forward sweep, back sweep, and duffek/bow rudder), rolling, and boofing. Whitewater kayaking requires much essential equipment to make a “kayaking kit,” such as a whitewater-specific kayak, spray skirt, paddle, helmet, and PFD (personal flotation device).

Paddling on rivers, lakes, and oceans dates back to the Stone Age, with rafts, catamarans, canoes, and kayaks evolving based on the needs of indigenous peoples. After his North American travels, John MacGregor popularized kayaking in Europe in the 19th century, leading to increased leisure paddling during the Industrial Revolution. Innovations by figures like Tom Johnson and Bill Masters further advanced the sport, leading to today&#x27;s diverse and safety-conscious whitewater kayaking community.


==History==

Paddling on rivers, lakes and oceans is as old as the Stone Age. The raft, the catamaran, the canoe and the kayak evolved depending on the needs and environment of the indigenous peoples in different parts of the world. The modern day kayak most likely originated about 8,000 years ago along the Siberian coast line by the Yupik and then transformed from the open canoe, via the Aleut and Inuit, into an enclosed kayak. The first boats made were hard to sink because they contained inflated seal bladders, which made them ideal for navigating whitewater.

The Greek, Herodotus, 484-425 BC, wrote in his travel diaries about boats with which merchandise was brought from Armenia to Babylon. The boats were made of a wooden framework that was covered with animal skins. Mules hauled the precious skins back to Armenia.

The Russian, Grigori Ivanovitch Langsdorff, reported from his trip around the world (1803–07) on the ease and elegance of paddling Eskimo (Inuit) kayaks/canoes. The Scot, John MacGregor, came back from his North American trip full of excitement about the kayak/canoe and in 1860 started building six boats that closely resembled Inuit canoes/kayaks, weighing approximately . In 1866 he published the book &quot;A Thousand Miles in the Rob Roy Canoe&quot;. The timing was right and the book became a resounding success. With the Industrial Revolution leading to more leisure time in the middle of the 19th century, people in Europe started to enjoy floating down rivers in various contraptions taking in nature previously only available to a selected few.

1905, Alfred Heurich, an architectural student from Leipzig, Germany, invented the &quot;Faltboot&quot;, a folding kayak called Folboat in the US. Heurich went on to paddle over on rivers and lakes.

1907, Alfred Klepper, a master seamster from Rosenheim, bought the patent, improved the rigidity with a lever system and started production. Born was the Western culture&#x27;s invention of a paddle craft that for the first time in human history that allowed hardy enthusiasts to see wild river sections and canyons never before seen by the human eye. The design not only made it suitable for whitewater (WW); it was also easy to travel with and was affordable. World War I stopped any progress.

1920s, boating on WW with Folboats developed. Boaters flocked to rivers and lakes by train or bus. During that time, the Austrian, Edi Hans Pawlata reinvented the Eskimo roll.

1927, Franz von Alber, and then Klaus and Arndt von Rautenfeld, claimed to have independently developed a roll with their sea kayaks.

In the early 1930s, Walter Frentz, Herbert Rittlinger and a handful of others became pioneers and advocates of WW kayaking with documentaries and books.

1933, Adolf Hitler started to dissolve kayak clubs. They did not serve his plan and the impact on the sport was devastating. World War II brought the paddle sport to a total halt.

1946–48, In some regions, the Allies gradually lifted the ban on river travel in Germany. Paddle clubs were again allowed to form.

1952, Walter Frentz, published an inspiring book &quot;In den Schluchten Europas&quot; (In the Canyons of Europe) that gained popularity. The book was based on his river trips prior to World War II. Publications in those days told great stories with awesome pictures of first descents but with little information regarding river conditions. The tough times of the post war era had come to an end and people traveled abroad again looking for adventures with Folboats and canoes.

1955, Herbert Baschin in Stuttgart built the first polyester/fiber kayak. Despite the much improved manoeuvrability and material, Baschin&#x27;s hard shell was received with skepticism by paddle sport enthusiasts who were in love with their folboats and depended on public transportation. The ice broke when owning an automobile became affordable. The hard shell kayak was easily hauled to rivers and remote put-ins that were not accessible before. In the late 60s the WW sport started to spread from Europe around the world and transformed from adventure trips into a hardcore sport. With it came safety consciousness and protective gear.

1973, Tom Johnson, a racer and trainer from Kernville, California designs and markets the Hollowform: the first roto-moulded polyethylene boat. It was mass-produced by a garbage can manufacturing company. These virtually indestructible boats revolutionized the sport and quickly took off in California. Paddlers no longer had to constantly repair their boats during and after trips. They began to be able to use rocks as part of the strategy of negotiating difficult rapids. Hard runs became more accessible to less-skilled paddlers.

In 1978, Bill Masters, a kayaker and inventor in Liberty, South Carolina further perfected rotational moulding for kayaks with his company Perception Kayaks. Bill advanced the sport of whitewater kayaking beyond any of his predecessors through consistent innovations in manufacturing and design. His patented processes are still used to this day.

In 1980 the manufacturer Prijon in Rosenheim introduced polyethylene to Europe which made WW boating virtually maintenance and repair free in giant contrast to the Faltboot which had started it all.

1980 Holger Machatschek, together with ESKIMO kayak company in Landsberg, Germany, developed the first playboat called Topolino which galvanized kayaking into many new and exciting forms of extreme sports.

==Types==
There are five &quot;sub-categories&quot; in whitewater kayaking, each typically utilizes a unique kayak design:

===River running===
&quot;Riverrunning&quot; (practitioners use one word) is the essential - and some would say most artful - form of kayaking. Whereas its derivative forms (described below under the headings of Creeking, Slalom, Playboating and Squirt boating) have evolved in response to the challenges posed by riverrunning, such as pushing the levels of difficulty and/or competing, riverrunning, of its own right, is more about combining one&#x27;s paddling abilities and navigational skills with the movements and environments of rivers themselves. Important to a riverrunner is the experience and expression of the river in its &quot;continuity&quot; rather than, say, a penchant for its punctuated &quot;vertical&quot; features (e.g. standing waves, play-holes and waterfalls). As for kayak design, a &quot;pure&quot; riverrunning boat can be said to have &quot;driving ability&quot; - a blend of qualities that enables the paddler to make the most of the differential forces in the river&#x27;s currents. For example, instead of spinning or pivoting the boat to change its direction, a riverrunner will drive the boat in such a way as to make use of the river&#x27;s surface features (e.g. waves, holes and eddylines) thus conserving the boat&#x27;s speed and momentum (this is in particular contrast to slalom racing, where, in the attempt to negotiate certain kinds of slalom gates, the boater will pivot the boat to change its direction, and by so doing, diminish the boat&#x27;s speed and momentum.) A principal design characteristic of riverrunning kayaks (as well as for their closest cousin the slalom boat) is their comparatively longer length and narrower breadth (generally minimum 285 cm in length and maximum 63 cm in breadth). The longer length at the waterline not only helps to carry speed but the longer arcs thus created between stem and stern allow the boater to more efficiently and gracefully carve into, through and out of eddies and other currents.

===Creeking===

Creeking is perhaps best thought of as a subcategory of river running, involving very technical and difficult rapids, typically in the Grade/Class IV to VI range. While people will differ on the definition, creeking generally involves higher gradient (approaching or in excess of 100 ft per mi (19 m per km)), and is likely to include running ledges, slides, and waterfalls on relatively small and tight rivers, though some will allow for very large and big volume rivers in their definition. Kayaks used for creeking usually have higher volume (more gallons or litres of displacement) and more rounded bow and stern, as these features provide an extra margin of safety against the likelihood of pinning (getting a kayak wedged in such a way that it cannot be removed without a mechanical advantage system, such as between rocks and/or underwater), and will resurface more quickly and controllably when coming off larger drops. Creek boats usually have increased &quot;rocker,&quot; or rise, fore and aft of the cockpit for manoeuvrability. Extreme racing is a competitive form of this aspect of whitewater kayaking, in which kayakers race down steep sections and/or generally dangerous sections of whitewater.

===Slalom===

Slalom is a technical competitive form of kayaking, and one of the whitewater events to appear in the Olympic Games. Racers attempt to make their way from the top to the bottom of a designated section of river as fast as possible, while correctly negotiating gates (a series of double-poles suspended vertically over the river). There are usually 18–25 gates in a race which must be navigated in sequential order. Green gates must be negotiated in a downstream direction, red gates in an upstream direction. The events are typically conducted on Grade/Class II to Grade/Class IV water, but the placement of the gates, and precision necessary to paddle them fast and &quot;clean&quot; (without touching a pole and adding 2 seconds to the total time), makes the moves much harder than the water&#x27;s difficulty suggests. Pro level slalom competitions have specific length ( for kayaks – new rules), width, and weight requirements for the boats, which will be made out of kevlar/fibreglass/carbon fiber composites to be lightweight and have faster hull speed. Plastic whitewater kayaks can be used in citizen-level races.

===Playboating===
Playboating, also known as Freestyle or Rodeo, is a more gymnastic and artistic kind of kayaking. While the other varieties of kayaking generally involve going from Point A to Point B, playboaters often stay in one spot in the river (usually in a hole, pourover or on a wave) where they work with and against the dynamic forces of the river to perform a variety of manoeuvres. These can include surfing, spinning, and various vertical moves (cartwheels, loops, blunts, pistol and donkey flips, and many others), spinning the boat on all possible axes of rotation. More recently, aerial moves have become accessible, where paddlers perform tricks having gained air from using the speed and bounce of the wave. Kayaks used for playboating generally have relatively low volume in the bow and stern, allowing the paddler to submerge the ends of the kayak with relative ease. Competitions for playboating or freestyle are sometimes called whitewater rodeo in the US, but more frequently just referred to as freestyle events in UK and Europe.

===Squirt boating===

Squirt boating incorporates the use of low-volume boats to perform special moves in whitewater features. Squirt boating predates, and was critical to the foundation of, playboating. Squirt boats are often fairly long and flat, with low volume throughout the design. Because squirt boats are custom built to the paddlers weight, inseam, and personal preference, they are constructed with composite materials instead of plastic. Many squirt moves are intended to submerge all or part of the craft and paddler, such as the &quot;mystery move,&quot; in which both the boat and the paddler submerge completely into the river&#x27;s flow for several seconds and up to half a minute.

==Techniques==
===Paddle strokes===
A variety of different paddle strokes are used to guide, propel and turn the boat in various ways. Some strokes are used in combinations to perform manoeuvres such as the &quot;S-turn&quot;.

====Ready position====
Kayaking, especially in whitewater is all about always having your paddle in the water, however holding the paddle properly is best learned in the air. To properly hold a paddle you should try to make a box with your arms and paddle, shaped with 90 degree angles at your elbows and wrists. The blades on the paddle need to be equidistant from each hand, and the power face of the blade, or scoop, should be facing your stern. This position ensures your hands are in the correct location on the shaft.

====Forward stroke====
The forward stroke is the most intuitive paddle stroke in kayaking although proper technique is important to master. To do a forward stroke the paddler holds his paddle vertically, with one hand close to the face, and the other hand outstretched outside of the knee. The paddle enters the water near the toes of the paddler, and the paddle is pushed out with the upper hand and pulled in with the lower hand, keeping the paddle vertical. To incorporate more than just the arms and upper back, paddlers should twist their torsos to reach and twist back while pulling to maximize their reach and power. The blade should leave the water by the paddlers&#x27; hips, and the low hand comes up to the face, with the face hand reaching out to outside the knee on its side in order to initiate the next stroke.

====Back stroke====
The back stroke is almost the forward stroke exactly backwards, although often it is shorter and the paddler may need to time &quot;peeks&quot; at his destination during the stroke to ensure tracking.

====Low brace====
This is an important stroke to learn as paddlers move from flat-water to whitewater, as it is a flip prevention stroke. The low brace is a manipulation of the ready position in kayaking. With the box commented on above, the paddler rotates their elbows up so the power face faces the sky. To brace the paddler takes &quot;the box&quot; and moves it out to the side they are falling over on. Keeping their elbows high they can slap the outstretched blade down on the water and push down and slide it back towards their boat as they redistribute their weight over of their boat, stopping themselves from flipping over.

====High brace====
If the paddler is already well on their way to flipping over they may use the high brace to right themselves. By dropping their elbows and reaching the necessary blade to the surface on the side they are flipping on the paddler can use the power face to pull down on while doing a side crunch to redistribute their weight over their boat. The High Brace is exactly the same technique as the C to C roll when the paddler is closer to being upside down.

====Forward sweep====
In order to turn the paddler needs to master the forward sweep. In paddling momentum is the paddlers best tool for successful advancement, and so ruddering or back sweeps as a way of turning, results in decreased momentum and a higher chance of getting flipped or caught in a hole or wave. To forward sweep right the paddler will need to bring their left blade to their toes like they would in a forward stroke although this time they will drop their right hand from their face, to their biceps, making the paddle more horizontal. They will then move their blade in a semi circle around their boat finishing at their stern.

====Back sweep====
The back sweep is the forward sweep in reverse, move the blade from the stern to the bow in a semi circle. Matching forward sweeps and back sweeps together is the fastest way to turn a boat if needed.

====Duffek/Bow rudder====
When paddling downstream paddlers can use some advanced paddle strokes along with differing currents to quickly turn their boat, one of these strokes is the duffek. In a river current generally moves downstream, but behind rocks or on shore the water may be still or actually move upstream. When a paddler moves from one of these currents to the other they can use the duffek stroke to quickly turn their boat into the direction of the current. A good visual representation of the duffek in real life is thinking about someone running down a sidewalk, grasping a pole on the sidewalk and swinging around it with legs outstretched to end up running in the other direction, momentum intact. In a kayak this can be achieved by putting a vertical paddle blade in the opposing current when crossing from one current to another. The hardest part of the duffek is keeping your paddle vertical right by your knee, and keeping the power face always facing exactly perpendicular with the current you are grabbing. In other words, the scoop of the blade always needs to be facing where the current is coming from. This is tricky because as you turn your blade will turn with you unless you twist your wrists to keep it static. If done correctly paddlers can enter and exit opposing currents with one duffek that can be turned into a powerful forward stroke upon completion.

===Rolling and roll aftermath===

Rolling is an essential skill in whitewater kayaking. This technique allows a flipped boater to regain an upright position. There are a variety of different styles of rolling, but in whitewater paddling the styles which offer protection of the face receive special emphasis.
The roll is normally used instead of a T rescue (so named because two kayaks form a T shape when used). If the roll does not end with the kayaker upright they can set up again and make additional attempts. Multiple failed rolls usually result in the paddler running out of breath and &quot;swimming&quot; (a swim means exiting the boat completely and entering the water).

====Handpaddling====
Handpaddling refers to paddling without a conventional paddle. Instead, the kayaker uses plastic hand paddles. This technique is appropriate for paddlers that prefer to roll without a paddle (hand roll). Audrey Adamchak, age 14, thought to be the youngest woman to kayak the classic 225 miles whitewater stretch of the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon, accomplished this feat with hand paddles crafted by her father.

===Boofing===
Boofing, in whitewater kayaking, refers to the raising of the kayak&#x27;s bow during freefall, while descending a ledge, ducking behind a boulder, or running a waterfall. This technique is used to avoid submerging the bow of the kayak by ensuring it lands flat when it hits the base of the waterfall. The term is an onomatopoeia which mimics the sound that is usually created when the hull of the kayak makes contact with water at the base of the waterfall.

Another type of boof is the &quot;rock boof&quot; which is a move that uses a glancing impact with a boulder at the top of a ledge to bounce the boater over a downstream feature, often finished with a mid-air eddy turn. Rock boofs result in sounds both at the top of the drop (boat impacting rock) and the bottom (boat bellyflopping into the water).

== Equipment ==

=== Kayaks ===
Whitewater kayaks are specialized boats designed for navigating rivers with fast currents, rapids, and obstacles. Unlike recreational kayaks, whitewater kayaks are shorter and more maneuverable, allowing paddlers to make quick turns and navigate tight spaces. They are typically made from durable materials such as high-density polyethylene or composite plastics to withstand impacts with rocks and other hazards. Whitewater kayaks come in various styles tailored to specific activities, including creek boats for steep descents, playboats for performing tricks in waves and holes, and river runners for a balance of speed and control. Their design features include a sealed cockpit to prevent water entry, adjustable outfitting for a secure fit, and rocker (upward curve at the ends) to improve agility and reduce the risk of capsizing. These features make whitewater kayaks essential for tackling turbulent river conditions safely and effectively.

==== Composition ====
Rotomolded plastic that can withstand repeated impacts and abrasion is most common. Most have the ability to be &quot;welded&quot; after significant damage. Earliest models were typically fiberglass and it was common to join a club to learn how to build your own. Today most composite kayaks are reserved for slalom or squirt boating.

==== Other features ====

* A large cockpit for easy exit in an emergency.
* A cockpit rim for attaching a spray skirt.
* Grab loops for extraction from a rock pin.
* Center pillars made of foam and provide support and prevent collapse from pressure.
* Thigh braces and hip pads maintain body contact with the kayak for more efficient paddling and easier rolling.
* Back band. More recreational kayaks have a back band that rises up above the cockpit for extra comfort. Whitewater kayak back bands are lower in order to accommodate a spray skirt.
* Rocker, a feature of the hull of the boat where both the bow and stern are curved upward, allowing the kayak to go up and over rocks more effectively, as well as allow for more maneuverability by reducing the length of the water line.

===Paddles===

Whitewater kayaking paddles are specifically designed to provide durability, control, and efficiency in challenging river conditions. These paddles typically feature a double-bladed design, with each blade offset at an angle (feathered) to reduce wind resistance during strokes. The blades are often made from strong, lightweight materials such as fiberglass, carbon fiber, or reinforced plastic to withstand impacts with rocks and debris. Whitewater paddles have a shorter and stiffer shaft compared to recreational paddles, allowing for precise maneuvering and quick response in turbulent waters. The blades are also larger and more curved to generate powerful strokes, making them ideal for navigating strong currents and rapids. Paddle shafts may be straight or bent to suit different paddling styles and provide comfort during extended use. These design elements make whitewater kayaking paddles an essential tool for maintaining control and propulsion in dynamic river environments.

====Composition====
Earlier paddles were often made of wood and then later with a heavy metal shaft and poly-synthetic blades. Advances in technology today include carbon fiber shafts with foam and carbon fiber blades on the high end, and low flex but light plastic on the low end, sometimes with rubber grips.

====Shaft====

Paddles with blades included historically measured over 200 cm, but now usually measure between 185 and 205 cm. Also the industry has begun to offer bent shafts that are ergonomically shaped to relieve stress off of the paddlers wrists. Many companies also offer specialized rubber grips to ease the paddlers grip and provide a place to feel where hands should hold the shaft. Small and regular shaft thicknesses may be available as well to offer smaller paddlers more comfort while gripping the paddle.

== Injuries ==
Kayaking and Rafting are considered an extreme sport. While considered not too extreme or difficult, on occasion it can be dangerous and cause serious injuries.

Kayaking and rafting exhibit distinct injury rates, with kayaking experiencing 3 to 6 injuries and rafting ranging from 0.26 to 2.1 per 100,000 boating days. In kayaking, acute injuries typically result from the force exerted by the water on the upper extremity, predominantly the shoulder, or collisions with objects during &#x27;swimming&#x27; incidents. On the other hand, acute rafting injuries more commonly stem from contact with another rafter&#x27;s paddle or equipment, followed by incidents where the rafter collides with an object while &#x27;swimming.&#x27; Chronic injuries are relatively rare in rafting, contrasting with kayaking where they account for 25% to 40% of all injuries, primarily manifesting as shoulder or wrist complaints.

===Other===
In addition to the boat and paddle there are several other pieces of gear that are necessary for whitewater paddling. A buoyancy aid (BA) or personal flotation device (PFD), helmet, and spray deck (sometimes known as a sprayskirt) are considered essential while a throwbag, knife, and safety whistle are recommended as standard pieces of safety gear. Many people also wear a nose clip since flipping the boat is a normal part of the whitewater experience. In addition the boater must be dressed appropriately for the water temperature, which might simply be a wetsuit or drysuit. The boat itself should be equipped with enough flotation to make pinning less likely and help enable its recovery.

<text>The South Caucasus, also known as Transcaucasia or the Transcaucasus, is a geographical region on the border of Eastern Europe and West Asia, straddling the southern Caucasus Mountains. The South Caucasus roughly corresponds to modern Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan, which are sometimes collectively known as the Caucasian States. The total area of these countries measures about . The South Caucasus and the North Caucasus together comprise the larger Caucasus geographical region that divides Eurasia.

==Geography==

The South Caucasus spans the southern portion of the Caucasus Mountains and their lowlands, straddling the border between the continents of Europe and Asia, and extending southwards from the southern part of the Main Caucasian Range of southwestern Russia to the Turkish and Armenian borders, and from the Black Sea in the west to the Caspian Sea coast of Iran in the east. The area includes the southern part of the Greater Caucasus mountain range, the entire Lesser Caucasus mountain range, the Colchis Lowlands, the Kura-Aras Lowlands, Qaradagh, the Talysh Mountains, the Lankaran Lowland, Javakheti and the eastern portion of the Armenian Highland.

All of present-day Armenia is in the South Caucasus; the majority of present-day Georgia and Azerbaijan, including the exclave of Nakhchivan, also fall within the region. Parts of Iran and Turkey are also included within the region of the South Caucasus. Goods produced in the region include oil, manganese ore, tea, citrus fruits, and wine. It remains one of the most politically tense regions in the post-Soviet area, and contains two heavily disputed areas: Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Between 1878 and 1917, the Russian-controlled province of Kars Oblast and the county of Surmalu uezd (present-day Iğdır Province) were also incorporated into the South Caucasus.

==Etymology==
Nowadays, the region is referred to as the &quot;South Caucasus&quot; or &quot;Southern Caucasia&quot; (; ; ; ; ). The former name of the region, &quot;Transcaucasia,&quot; is a Latin rendering of the Russian-language word &quot;Zakavkazye&quot; (), meaning &quot;[the area] beyond the Caucasus&quot;. This implies a Russian vantage point, and is analogous to similar terms such as Transnistria and Transleithania. Other, rarer forms of this word include &quot;Trans-Caucasus&quot; and &quot;Transcaucasus&quot; ().

==History==
===Prehistory===
Herodotus, a Greek historian who is known as &#x27;the Father of History&#x27; and Strabo, a Greek geographer, philosopher, and historian, spoke about autochthonous peoples of the Caucasus in their books. In the Middle Ages, various people, including Scythians, Alani, Huns, Khazars, Arabs, Seljuq Turks, and Mongols settled in Caucasia. These invasions influenced on the culture of the peoples of the South Caucasus. In parallel Middle Eastern influence disseminated the Iranian languages and Islamic religion in Caucasus.


Located on the peripheries of Iran, Russia and Turkey, the region has been an arena for political, military, religious, and cultural rivalries and expansionism for centuries. Throughout its history, the region has come under control of various empires, including the Achaemenid, Neo-Assyrian Empire, Parthian, Roman, Sassanian, Byzantine, Umayyad, Abbassid, Mongol, Ottoman, successive Iranian (Safavid, Afsharid, Qajar), and Russian Empires, all of which introduced their faiths and cultures. Throughout history, most of the South Caucasus was usually under the direct rule of the various in-Iran based empires and part of the Iranian world. In the course of the 19th century, Qajar Iran had to irrevocably cede the region (alongside its territories in Dagestan, North Caucasus) as a result of the two Russo-Persian Wars of that century to Imperial Russia.

Ancient kingdoms of the region included Colchis, Urartu, Iberia, Armenia and Albania, among others. These kingdoms were later incorporated into various Iranian empires, including the Achaemenid Empire, the Parthian Empire, and the Sassanid Empire, during which Zoroastrianism became the dominant religion in the region. However, after the rise of Christianity and conversion of Caucasian kingdoms to the new religion, Zoroastrianism lost its prevalence and only survived because of Persian power and influence still lingering in the region. Thus, the South Caucasus became the area of not only military, but also religious convergence, which often led to bitter conflicts with successive Persian empires (and later Muslim-ruled empires) on the one side and the Roman Empire (and later the Byzantine Empire and Russian Empire) on the other side.

The Iranian Parthians established and installed several eponymous branches in the South Caucasus, namely the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia, the Arsacid dynasty of Iberia, and the Arsacid dynasty of Caucasian Albania.

===Middle ages and Russian rule===
In the middle of the 8th century, with the capture of Derbend by the Umayyad armies during the Arab–Khazar wars, most of the South Caucasus became part of the Caliphate and Islam spread throughout the region. Later, the Orthodox Christian Kingdom of Georgia dominated most of the South Caucasus. The region was then conquered by the Seljuk, Mongol, Turkic, Safavid, Ottoman, Afsharid and Qajar dynasties.

After two wars in the first half of the 19th century, namely the Russo-Persian War (1804-1813) and the Russo-Persian War (1826-1828), the Russian Empire conquered most of the South Caucasus (and Dagestan in the North Caucasus) from the Iranian Qajar dynasty, severing historic regional ties with Iran. By the Treaty of Gulistan that followed after the 1804-1813 war, Iran was forced to cede modern-day Dagestan, Eastern Georgia, and most of the Azerbaijan Republic to Russia. By the Treaty of Turkmenchay that followed after the 1826-1828 war, Iran lost all of what is modern-day Armenia and the remainder of the contemporary Azerbaijani Republic that remained in Iranian hands. After the 1828-1829 war, the Ottomans ceded Western Georgia (except Adjaria, which was known as Sanjak of Batum), to the Russians, who populated this new southern boundary mostly with undesirable citizens and tolerated heretics (&quot;sektanty&quot;).

In 1844, what comprises present-day Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan were combined into a single czarist government-general, which was termed a vice-royalty in 1844-1881 and 1905–1917. Following the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish War, Russia annexed Kars, Ardahan, Agri and Batumi from the Ottomans, joined to this unit, and established the province of Kars Oblast as its most south-westerly territory in the South Caucasus.

===Modern era===

After the fall of the Russian Empire in 1918, the South Caucasus region was unified into a single political entity twice, as the Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic from 9 April 1918 to 26 May 1918, and as the Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic from 12 March 1922 to 5 December 1936.

Both times these Transcaucasian entities dissolved, although the region would remain politically bound together in the Soviet Union in the form of the three separate Soviet Socialist Republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. All three regained independence in 1991 when the Soviet Union dissolved.

The Russo-Georgian War took place in 2008 across the South Caucasus, contributing to further instability in the region, which is as intricate as the Middle East, due to the complex mix of religions (mainly Muslim and Orthodox Christian) and ethno-linguistic groups.

Since their independence, the three countries have had varying degrees of success in their relations with Russia and other countries. In Georgia, after the Rose Revolution in 2004, the country, like the Baltic states, began integrating into wider European society by opening up relations with NATO and the European Union. Armenia continues to foster relations with Russia, while also developing ties with the EU. Azerbaijan relies less on Russia, strategically partnering with Turkey and other NATO states. All three South Caucasus countries are members of the Council of Europe, the European Political Community, and participate in the EU&#x27;s Eastern Partnership and Euronest Parliamentary Assembly.

On 8 November 2023, the European Commission issued an official recommendation to grant EU candidate status to Georgia, which was confirmed on 14 December 2023. Georgia, thus becoming, the first country in the South Caucasus to receive EU candidate status. On 12 March 2024, the European Parliament passed a resolution confirming Armenia meets Maastricht Treaty requirements and that the country may apply for EU membership.

==Wine==
The South Caucasus, in particular where modern-day Turkey, Georgia, Armenia and Iran are located, is one of the native areas of the wine-producing vine &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;. Some experts speculate that the South Caucasus may be the birthplace of wine production. Archaeological excavations and carbon dating of grape seeds from the area have dated back to 8000–5000 BC. Wine found in Iran has been dated to BC and BC, while wine found in Georgia has been dated to BC. The earliest winery, dated to BC, was found in Armenia.

<text>Wejherowo (; formerly ) is a city in Gdańsk Pomerania, northern Poland, with 48,735 inhabitants (2021). It has been the capital of Wejherowo County in Pomeranian Voivodeship since 1999; previously, it was a city in Gdańsk Voivodeship (1975–1998).

==Geographical location==
Wejherowo is located in Pomeralia, in the ethnocultural region of Kashubia, approximately west of the town of Rumia, east of the town of Lębork and north-west of the regional metropole of Gdańsk, in the broad glacial valley of the river Rheda at an altitude of above sea level.

==History==

Wejherowo was founded in 1643 as &quot;Wola Wejherowska&quot; (literally &quot;Wejher&#x27;s Wola&quot;), by the voivode of the Malbork Voivodeship, and Polish noble, Jakub Wejher. It was translated in the colloquial German of the time as &quot;Weihersfrey&quot; or &quot;Veyersfrey&quot;. According to the founder&#x27;s will, the dwellers of the new settlement were to possess the same city rights as other towns in the region, hence the place granted Kulm law. The town&#x27;s privileges, received in 1655, were confirmed by King John II Casimir Vasa of Poland.

Wejher, who survived the Smolensk War, built two churches in the new settlement (The Holy Trinity and Saint Ann). He also brought in Franciscan fathers, built a monastery, and founded a calvary, consisting of 26 chapels, aligned along the border of the town forest, which were built during 1646–55. According to the founder&#x27;s written statement of 1655, all honorable persons, independent of their nationality, were invited to become citizens of the new settlement if they would pay a citizen fee of ten gulden each.

In the First Partition of Poland in 1772, in which the Kingdom of Prussia annexed most of Pomerelia, the town was incorporated into the Kingdom, and administered within the new province of West Prussia. Its name in German changed from &quot;Weyersfrey&quot; to &quot;Neustadt in Westpreußen&quot;, a name which was in use also before. The affix &quot;in West Prussia&quot; was added to the town&#x27;s name in order to avoid confusion with a number of other towns carrying the same name. Decisive factors which boosted the development of the town in the 19th century were the 1818 establishment of Landkreis Neustadt, an administrative district, and the construction of the Danzig (Gdańsk) – Stettin (Szczecin) railway line, to which Neustadt was connected with a train station in 1870. Neustadt became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany. During the second half of the 19th century, a significant number of Jewish families from the region began migrating to Syracuse, New York, including the Shubert theatrical family. Kashubians and Poles formed 59.3% of population in the district area of the city around this time. The city itself, however, was predominantly German. According to the census of 1910, the city had a population of 9,804, of which 6,970 (71%) were Germans, 2,421 (25%) were Kashubians and 394 (4%) were Poles.

In 1905, Neustadt had a Protestant church, two Catholic churches, a synagogue, a grammar school, a preparatory school for a training college for school teachers, a training college for evangelical school teachers, a mental asylum, a local court, a forest office, cigarette factories, sawmills, a brewery, a cattle trade and wood trade as well as grain trade. During the Partitions, the German authorities led a systemic campaign of Germanization against local the Polish and Kashubian populations, which resisted by organizing the secret patriotic organization &quot;Zwiazek Filomatów&quot;, distributing the Polish newspaper&quot; Gazeta Gdańska,&quot; and by establishing various local economic initiatives.

Until 1919, Neustadt belonged to the administrative region of Regierungsbezirk Danzig in the Province of West Prussia in Germany. After World War I and the re-establishment of independent Poland, the town was integrated into the Second Polish Republic. Wejherowo was the capital of Wejherowo County in Pomeranian Voivodeship, becoming a headquarters of state administration responsible for the maritime economy. In 1923–1928, there was a special educational center in Wejherowo, in which about 300 Polish orphans lived and got education after their rescue from war-stricken Siberia with the help of Japan in 1920–1922.

===World War II===

On 9 September 1939, during the invasion of Poland, which marked the beginning of World War II, Wejherowo was captured by the Wehrmacht. Afterwards it was annexed by Nazi Germany and administered as part of Regierungsbezirk Danzig in the newly formed province of Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. Most of the town&#x27;s Jewish community was murdered by the Nazis during the occupation, while many local Poles were also victims of the Nazi extermination policy.

The Einsatzkommando 16 and SS Wachsturmbann &quot;Eimann&quot; entered the county in the first half of September 1939 to commit various crimes against the population. Poles arrested both in Wejherowo and the county were imprisoned in the local prison, and afterwards transported to the nearby village of Piaśnica Wielka, which was the site of a mass murder of about 12,000 Poles in 1939. Among people murdered there were the city&#x27;s mayor Teodor Roman Bolduan and the wójt of gmina Wejherowo (head of the local gmina) Edward Łakomy. Also Polish students from local high schools were massacred there. Numerous Poles arrested during the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; in other cities of the region were also briefly held in the local prison before they were murdered in Piaśnica. Among them were local officials, merchants, activists, teachers, priests and civilian defenders of Gdynia. Local teachers were also among Polish teachers and principals murdered in the Mauthausen concentration camp.

In March 1945, Wejherowo was captured by the Soviet Red Army. After the war, in 1945, Wejherowo was reintegrated with Poland. Its first post-war mayor was Bernard Szczęsny, who during the German occupation was part of the Polish resistance movement, was imprisoned in the Stutthof concentration camp and escaped during a death march. Some German perpetrators were not sentenced for their involvement in the crimes committed against Poles in Wejherowo and even retained public offices, including Gustav Bamberger, the town&#x27;s deputy mayor under German occupation, who participated in the selection of prisoners in the local jail. After the war he served as the deputy mayor of Hanover in West Germany.

<text>Pruszcz Gdański (; former ; ; ) is a town in Pomerania, northern Poland with 26,834 inhabitants (2010). Pruszcz Gdański is an industrial town neighbouring Gdańsk, part of the Tricity agglomeration. The Tricity Bypass begins in Pruszcz Gdański.

The capital of Gdańsk County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship since 1999, previously in the Gdańsk Voivodeship from 1975 to 1998. The town is served by a railway station.

==History ==

Human settlement in Pruszcz Gdański dates back to prehistoric times. Various traces of human settlement and cemeteries from the Bronze and Iron Ages and ancient Roman times were discovered during archaeological excavations within the modern town limits. The territory became part of the emerging Polish state in the 10th century under its first historic ruler Mieszko I. The oldest known mention of Pruszcz comes from 1307. It was invaded and occupied by the Teutonic Knights in the following years. In the 14th century, the Radunia Canal was built. In 1454, King Casimir IV Jagiellon reincorporated the area to the Kingdom of Poland. During the subsequent Thirteen Years&#x27; War, it was the site of the Battle of Pruszcz Gdański between forces from the Polish-allied city of Gdańsk and the Teutonic Knights. The restoration of the region to Poland was confirmed by the peace treaty of 1466. Pruszcz was a possession of the city of Gdańsk, administratively located in the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the Royal Prussia and Greater Poland provinces. Polish Kings often stopped in Pruszcz when travelling to the nearby city of Gdańsk.

Pruszcz was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the Partitions of Poland, and from 1871 to 1920 it was also part of Germany. It had a mixed Catholic and Lutheran population, with small Jewish and Mennonite minorities. Unlike most of Eastern Pomerania, the town did not return to Poland after regaining independence, but was included in the short-lived Free City of Danzig by the Treaty of Versailles. During World War II, it was occupied by Nazi Germany. Poles from Leśniewo and Swarzewo were enslaved as forced labour at local farms, and Jewish women were similarly enslaved in a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp. Following Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war, the town became again part of Poland.

As early as 30 March 1945, the Polish Post Office began its work as the first post-war Polish institution in the town. In post-war Poland the adjective &quot;Gdański&quot; was added to the town&#x27;s name, after the nearby city of Gdańsk, to distinguish the town from other Polish settlements of the same name.

<text>Władysławowo (Kashubian/Pomeranian: &quot;Wiôlgô Wies&quot; [ˈvʲɞlɡɞ ˈvʲɛs], ) is a city on the south coast of the Baltic Sea in Kashubia in the Pomerelia region, northern Poland, with 9,363 inhabitants as of 2022.

==History==

=== Imperial times ===
In 1634 engineer Fryderyk Getkant designed a fort called Władysławowo located on the Hel Peninsula, several kilometers east of today&#x27;s town of Władysławowo. It was officially recorded as a fort a year later.

=== Pre-war era ===
It was successfully built as a new town as a Polish fishing port in 1930s during the Polish Second Republic, with fishing a key part of the Polish economy at the time. Construction began in March 1936, and the new town was officially inaugurated on the 3 May 1938.

=== World War II ===
Fights to liberate the Hel Peninsula started on October 9, 1939. On that day, Nazi forces took Puck, and were ready to take Swarzewo. a On October 10, 1939, Nazi German forces attacked then-known-as Wielka Wieś. However, the Polish forces won, making the German forces withdraw from Wielka Wieś. The village was held by Polish forces for about 2 weeks, after then being occupied. A mural was dedicated to this exact battle in Władysławowo.

=== Post-war ===
It was named after King Władysław IV Vasa, who initiated the construction of the Polish Navy.

After growing and incorporating several of the surrounding villages and settlements into its boundaries since then the town officially received town rights on 30 June 1963. It continued to expand through with several more villages becoming its neighbourhoods.

Currently Władysławowo is a sea port and a popular seaside holiday destination.

==Administration==
The gmina (urban-rural municipality) of Władysławowo consists of the town Władysławowo (with a district Cetniewo) and seven villages: Chałupy (to the east, on the Hel peninsula), Rozewie, Jastrzębia Góra, Ostrowo, Karwia and Tupadły. Several of these places serve as popular seaside resorts.

The city is currently situated in the Puck County in the Pomeranian Voivodeship, since the 1999 reorganisation. It was previously in Gdańsk Voivodeship, between 1975 and 1998.

==Geography==
Poland&#x27;s northern extremity is situated in Jastrzębia Góra, marked by the &quot;Gwiazda Północy&quot; (&quot;Northern Star&quot;) monument, which stands on a cliff overlooking the beach that is the actual most northerly point. The nearby headland of Cape Rozewie was formerly believed to be the country&#x27;s most northerly point, prior to measurements carried out in December 2000.

Port of Władysławowo is a seaport located within the city.

&quot;Władysławowo&quot; and &quot;Władysławowo Port&quot; are PKP railway stations in the town.

<text>Bonsoir is a 1994 French film directed by Jean-Pierre Mocky.

== Plot ==
Having first lost his wife, then his job as a tweed tailor, Alex Ponttin (Michel Serrault) has devised a novel way to keep himself in touch with society. He admits himself into people&#x27;s homes by pretending to be a relative or an official and persuading his victims to give him a night&#x27;s free board. He finds at first a lunch with the horrible couple Dumont (Jean-Pierre Bisson and Maike Jansen), where a thief follows him for a robbery. Alex spent an evening in front of TV at Marie (Marie-Christine Barrault), mother of seven children. He runs from Marie to find an evening and a new bed at the home of charming but shy lesbian Caroline (Claude Jade) and her funny lover Gloria (Corinne Le Poulain). 
To save her inheritance, Caroline - accused for her homosexuality by her horrible sister Catherine (Laurence Vincendon) - tells her aunt Amélie (Monique Darpy) that Gloria is her secretary and Alex her lover. Alex has to present himself nude in Caroline&#x27;s bed. He saves Caroline&#x27;s inheritance.
The police officers (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) investigating the case are so terminally stupid that Alex has little chance of being arrested.

As in many of Jean-Pierre Mocky&#x27;s films, there is a strong anti-establishment, almost anarchist subtext. This is manifested in the way that the self-proclaimed moral figures (the police, the clergy, even the President of the Republic) are presented in this film, but also in the elevation of Alex Ponttin to the status of a public hero at the end of the film. Whilst society and state sink into a numbing inertia, bereft of integrity and humanity, it is left to the eccentrics, the outsiders like worried Caroline, who is attacked by her sister and her aunt because the secret of her homosexuality, to build a more cohesive society and a better world.
Michel Serrault excels in this off-the-wall satirical comedy which makes a bizarre assessment of modern life. He plays an impish vagrant who uses his new-found freedom to improve the lives of his fellow man, by briefly insinuating himself into their lives. Bonsoir goes much further and suggests that whole of modern society, not only the police, is culpable of mediocrity and moral laxity. It takes an outsider like Alex Ponttin, free from the bonds of modern living, to point the way to a better future.

<text>John C. Wright (born October 22, 1961) is an American writer of science fiction and fantasy novels. He was a Nebula Award finalist for his fantasy novel &quot;Orphans of Chaos&quot;. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said he &quot;may be this fledgling century&#x27;s most important new SF talent&quot; when reviewing his debut novel, &quot;The Golden Age&quot;.

==Early life==
John C. Wright was born in Chula Vista, California. He studied the Great Books at St. John&#x27;s College in Annapolis, Maryland, graduating in 1984. He received his Juris Doctor degree from William &amp; Mary Law School in 1987.

==Career==
Wright was admitted to the practice of law in three jurisdictions, New York, May 1989; Maryland, December 1990. Washington, D.C., January 1994. After his law practice was unsuccessful, he went to work for the newspaper &quot;St. Mary&#x27;s Today&quot;.

Wright later worked as a newspaperman and newspaper editor before venturing into writing genre fiction. When reviewing his debut novel &quot;The Golden Age&quot;, &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; said he &quot;may be this fledgling century&#x27;s most important new SF talent&quot;

Wright also works as a technical writer in Virginia.

==Awards==
Wright&#x27;s &quot;Orphans of Chaos&quot; was nominated for the 2005 Nebula Award for Best Novel, losing to Joe Haldeman&#x27;s &quot;Camouflage&quot;.

In 2015, as a part of the Rabid Puppies slate, Wright received five Hugo Award nominations, including three in the Best Novella category (&quot;One Bright Star to Guide Them,&quot; &quot;The Plural of Helen of Troy,&quot; and &quot;Pale Realms of Shade&quot;), a fourth for Best Short Story (&quot;The Parliament of Beasts and Birds&quot;), and a fifth for Best Related Work (&quot;Transhuman and Subhuman: Essays on Science Fiction and Awful Truth&quot;). All his works were ranked below &quot;No Award&quot;.

On September 4, 2016, Wright&#x27;s novel &quot;Somewhither&quot; (published by Castalia House) received the first Dragon Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.

==Personal life==
At age 42, Wright converted from atheism to Christianity, citing a profound religious experience with visions of the &quot;Virgin Mary, her son, and His Father, not to mention various other spirits and ghosts over a period of several days&quot;, and stating that prayers he made were answered. In 2008, he was received into the Roman Catholic Church, of which he approvingly said: &quot;If Vulcans had a church, they&#x27;d be Catholics.&quot;

Wright is married to writer L. Jagi Lamplighter, and they have four children.

<text>The 7TP (&quot;siedmiotonowy polski&quot; - 7-tonne Polish) was a Polish light tank of the Second World War. It was developed from the British Vickers 6-ton. A standard tank of the Polish Army during the 1939 Polish Campaign, its production did not exceed 150 vehicles. Its chassis was used as the base for the C7P artillery tractor.

==Design==

The 7TP was the Polish development of the British Vickers 6-ton Mark E tank licence. Comparing to Vickers, the main new features of 7TP were: a better, more reliable and powerful diesel engine, a 37 mm anti-tank gun, thicker armour (17 mm instead of 13 mm on the front), modified ventilation, the Gundlach tank periscope, and a radio. About 132 tanks were produced between 1935 and the outbreak of the war, plus four iron prototypes. The designation 7TP meant &quot;7 Tonne, Polish&quot; (in fact its weight increased to 9 tonnes after the initial prototype).

Although the 7TP is often claimed to be the world&#x27;s first (production) diesel-powered tank, this distinction actually goes to Japanese Type 89B I-Go Otsu, produced with a diesel engine from 1934 onwards. Barring that, the claim of a first purpose-designed diesel-powered tank is tied with Type 95 Ha-Go, whose series production also commenced in 1935.

Like its British predecessor, the 7TP was initially produced in two variants: twin turret version armed with 2 Ckm wz.30 machine guns, and a single turret version, armed with 37 mm Bofors wz. 37 gun. After initial tests, it became clear that the twin-turret variant was obsolete and lacked firepower, so it was abandoned in favour of the more modern single turret design.

Prior to the outbreak of World War II most of the twin turret tanks were converted to single turret versions and only 24 twin-turret types remained in Polish service (as opposed to roughly 108 of the other type). Twin and single turret variants had no specific designations. In some modern books they are unofficially designated &quot;7TP dw.&quot; and &quot;7TP jw.&quot; (Polish abbreviations for &quot;dwuwieżowy&quot; – dual turreted; &quot;jednowieżowy&quot; – single turreted).

In 1938 Państwowe Zakłady Inżynierii also produced 13 prototype models of a better armored version of the 7TP – the 9TP. Although the 9TP never entered production, these prototypes were used in the defense of Warsaw in September 1939.

=== Foreign interest ===
Romania sent a military commission in late autumn 1935 to evaluate the 7TP for a future acquisition. Although the tank fared well during field trials, the Romanian officers were not impressed by the armour of the Polish prototype and instead recommended the acquisition of the Czechoslovak LT vz. 35 tank.

==Combat history==
All 7TP tanks took part in combat in the defence of Poland during the German Invasion of Poland in 1939. Most of them were attached to two light tank battalions (the 1st and the 2nd). The remaining tanks, that is the ones used for training as well as tanks that were finished after the outbreak of the war, were used in an improvised tank unit fighting in the defence of Warsaw. Although technically superior to any of the German light tanks of the era, the 7TP was too scarce to change the outcome of the war.

The 1st Light Tank Battalion (49 single turret tanks) fought in the ranks of the Prusy Army as part of the strategic reserve force of the Polish Army. It entered combat on September 4, 1939, and fought with distinction in a variety of roles, mostly as a mobile reserve and for covering the withdrawal. It fought in a number of battles, most notably in the battles of Przedbórz, Sulejów, Inowłódz, Odrzywół and Drzewica. On September 8 it managed to stop the German advance on the centre of the Polish forces, but the following day it got separated from the main force and had to be withdrawn to the rear. Part of the battalion was destroyed in the Battle of Głowaczów, while the remainder on September 13 managed to break through to the other side of the Vistula, where it joined the Lublin Army and Col. Stefan Rowecki&#x27;s Warsaw Armoured Motorised Brigade. As part of that unit, the battalion took part in the Battle of Józefów and formed part of the spearhead of the Polish units trying to break through to Lwów and the Romanian Bridgehead. After the Battle of Tomaszów Lubelski, on September 21, 1939, the remaining tanks were destroyed by their crews and the unit surrendered to the Germans.

The 2nd Light Tank Battalion (49 single turret tanks) was attached to the Piotrków Operational Group of the Łódź Army. It entered combat on September 4 near the river of Prudka, Bełchatów. The following day it was ordered to lead the Polish counter-assault on Piotrków, but the attack failed because, in spite of retaking some ground from the Germans and destroying German tanks and armored vehicles, the objectives of the mission were not met (the Germans reinforced their positions with artillery). The unit lost 2 tanks and 6 more were taken away disabled. The unit was down to 24 fully operational tanks. The battalion was then rallied and withdrew to Warsaw and then to Brześć, where it shielded the mobilization of the Polish 60th Infantry Division. On September 15 it took part in a two-days long Battle of Włodawa, but suffered heavy losses due to air bombardment and was withdrawn southwards. The remaining 11 tanks had to be destroyed by the crews due to lack of oil and on September 17, after the Soviet Union joined Germany in her war against Poland, the crews and the staff of the unit crossed the border with Romania.

The remaining tanks found in Warsaw were formed into the 1st and 2nd Company of Light Tanks by the Command of the Defence of Warsaw. The 1st company had 11 twin-turreted tanks, previously used for training. In the opening stages of the Siege of Warsaw the unit took part in heavy fighting for Warsaw&#x27;s suburb of Okęcie and the major airport located there. Due to lack of anti-tank armament, the tanks of the 1st company suffered losses and were withdrawn to the rear on September 12, where the unit was joined with the 2nd company.

The 2nd company had 11 single-turret tanks, as well as an unknown number of other armoured vehicles. It took part in successful defence of the borough of Wola against German infantry and armoured units. It was also used for tactical counterattacks, among others for the village of Wawrzyszew, where the company managed to disrupt enemy preparations for the assault. On September 15 the company was ordered to form a spearhead of the Polish attack aimed at linking up with the forces of the Poznań Army withdrawing after the Battle of Bzura through the Kampinos forest north of Warsaw. The attack ended up as a minor success, although the German aerial bombardment caused heavy losses both in personnel and in tanks. The remaining 7TP tanks were used on various sectors of the front until the end of the defence of Warsaw on September 27, when they were destroyed by their crews. At the same time, one 7TP was captured by the Soviets during their invasion of Poland.

The combat experience proved that the Bofors wz. 37 anti-tank gun used in the 7TP was able to penetrate the armour of any of the German tanks of the time, including the newest, the Panzer IV. On the other hand, the 7TP was too lightly armoured, especially against aerial bombardment.

==Reconstruction==

No complete 7TP tanks have survived to this day, although it is planned to build a copy of the tank for the Museum of the Polish Army in Warsaw.

A turret gun from a 7TP which was used against the invading Germans in September 1939 and later employed by the Germans in France, is on display in the Polish Institute and Sikorski Museum in London.

A 7TP is being reconstructed in Bielsko-Biała, its reconstruction will include many original parts recovered from various places in Poland. It now has an original gearbox and will be soon armed with an original 37mm Bofors gun. The tracks come from a T-26. The reconstructors presented progress of their work at various reenactors&#x27; meetings and historic anniversaries.

==Operators==

* - 133 7TP jw, 16 7TP dw, and 13 9TP.

<text>Kronstadt Uprising were an anarcho-punk band from Southend-on-Sea, Essex, UK during the 1980s.

==History==
Named in tribute to the events of the Kronstadt rebellion the band were formed in 1981 by Steve Pegrum joined by Spencer Blake, Paul Lawson and Andy Fisher (although in 1982 the band were to become a three-piece with Paul Lawson taking on both guitar and vocal duties). Nick &#x27;Filf&#x27; Robinson of the Sinyx was also briefly in the band, providing additional guitar. They recorded their first demo late in 1981, a track of which was picked up by Crass and brought the band wider attention on volume two of the &quot;Bullshit Detector&quot; series of compilation albums released by Crass Records. During the mid-1980s the band moved away from their original anarcho-punk roots, and began to incorporate influences from glam rock as well as acts such as Johnny Thunders. After a period of many line-up changes KU finally split up in 1986.

The band released two EPs, &quot;The Unknown Revolution&quot; (Spiderleg Records) and &quot;Part of the Game&quot; (Dogrock Records). A twenty three track retrospective CD, &quot;Insurrection&quot;, which includes most of the band&#x27;s recordings including demo tapes, etc., was released in November 2000.

<text>Charles David George &quot;Charlie&quot; Stross (born 18 October 1964) is a British writer of science fiction and fantasy. Stross specialises in hard science fiction and space opera. Between 1994 and 2004, he was also an active writer for the magazine &quot;Computer Shopper&quot; and was responsible for its monthly Linux column. He stopped writing for the magazine to devote more time to novels. However, he continues to publish freelance articles on the Internet.

== Early life and education ==
Stross was born in Leeds, England. He showed an early interest in writing and wrote his first science fiction story at age 12. He graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Pharmacy in 1986 and qualified as a pharmacist in 1987. In 1989, he enrolled at University of Bradford for a post-graduate degree in computer science. In 1990, he went to work as a technical author and programmer. In 2000, he began working as a writer full-time, as a technical writer at first, but then became successful as a fiction writer.

== Career ==
In the 1970s and 1980s, Stross published some role-playing game articles about &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine. Some of his creatures, such as the death knight, githyanki (the name borrowed from George R. R. Martin&#x27;s 1977 novel, &quot;Dying of the Light&quot;), githzerai, and slaad (a chaotic race of frog-like humanoids) were later published in the &quot;Fiend Folio&quot; monster compendium.

His first published short story, &quot;The Boys&quot;, appeared in &quot;Interzone&quot; in 1987. A collection of his short stories, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2002; subsequent short stories have been nominated for the Hugo Award, Nebula Award, and other awards. His first novel, &quot;Singularity Sky&quot;, was published by Ace Books in 2003 and was also nominated for the Hugo Award. His novella &quot;The Concrete Jungle&quot; (published in &quot;The Atrocity Archives&quot;) won the Hugo award for its category in 2005. His novel &quot;Accelerando&quot; won the 2006 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, was a finalist for the John W. Campbell Memorial Award for Best Science Fiction Novel, and was on the final ballot for the Hugo Award in the best novel category. &quot;Glasshouse&quot; won the 2007 Prometheus Award and was on the final ballot for the Hugo Award in the best novel category; the German translation &quot;Glashaus&quot; won the 2009 Kurd-Laßwitz-Preis. His novella &quot;Missile Gap&quot; won the 2007 Locus Award for best novella, and he was awarded the Edward E. Smith Memorial Award or Skylark at Boskone 2008.

His novel &quot;The Atrocity Archives&quot; (2004) detailed a British intelligence agency tasked with investigating otherworldly horrors; using ideas similar to those in the RPG book &quot;Delta Green&quot; (1996), Stross wrote in the afterword to the book: &quot;All I can say in my defence is... I hadn&#x27;t heard of &quot;Delta Green&quot; when I wrote &quot;The Atrocity Archive&quot;... I&#x27;ll leave it at that except to say that &quot;Delta Green&quot; has come dangerously close to making me pick up the dice again.&quot;

&quot;Rogue Farm&quot;, his 2003 short story, was adapted into an eponymous animated film that debuted in August 2004.

Stross was one of the Guests of Honour at Orbital 2008, the British National Science Fiction convention (Eastercon), in March 2008. He was the Author Guest of Honour at the Maryland Regional Science Fiction Convention (Balticon) in May 2009. He was Author Guest of Honour at Fantasticon (Denmark) in August 2009. He was the Guest of Honor at Boskone 48 in Feb 2011.

Cubicle 7 used their &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; license to create &quot;The Laundry&quot; (2010), based on Stross&#x27; writings, wherein agents must contend with both the outer gods and the bureaucracy of the United Kingdom.

In September 2012, Stross released &quot;The Rapture of the Nerds&quot;, a novel written in collaboration with Cory Doctorow. The two have also together been involved in the Creative Commons licensing and copyright movement. In December 2017 he gave a talk at 34C3.

== Awards ==
&quot;Accelerando&quot; won the 2006 Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel. &quot;Missile Gap&quot; won the 2007 Locus Award for best novella. &quot;The Concrete Jungle&quot; (contained in &quot;The Atrocity Archives&quot;) won the Hugo Award for Best Novella in 2005; &quot;Palimpsest&quot;, included in &quot;Wireless&quot;, won the same award in 2010, and &quot;Equoid&quot; in 2014. &quot;Glasshouse&quot; won the 2009 Prometheus Award for Best Novel; Stross was a Best Novel finalist in 2009 for &quot;Saturn&#x27;s Children&quot; and has been nominated four other times for &quot;Iron Sunrise&quot; (in 2005), &quot;Accelerando&quot; (2006), &quot;The Revolution Business&quot; (2010) and &quot;Annihilation Score&quot; (2016). &quot;The Apocalypse Codex&quot; won the 2013 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel. Stross&#x27;s work has also been nominated for a number of other awards, including the John W. Campbell Memorial Award, Arthur C. Clarke Award, and the Hugo Award for Best Novel, as well as the Japanese Seiun Award.

<doc id="353389" wikidata="Q1643835" url="?curid=353389" title="William Francis Buckley">
<text>William Francis Buckley (May 30, 1928 – June 3, 1985) was a United States Army officer in the United States Army Special Forces, and a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) station chief in Beirut from 1984 until his kidnapping and execution in 1985.

Buckley&#x27;s cover was as a political officer at the U.S. Embassy. He was kidnapped by the group Islamic Jihad in March 1984, and held hostage and tortured by Aziz al-Abub. Hezbollah later claimed they executed him in October 1985, but another American hostage disputed that, believing that he died five months prior, in June.

He is buried at Arlington National Cemetery and is commemorated with a star on the Memorial Wall at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia.

== Early life and education ==
Buckley was born in Medford, Massachusetts, on May 30, 1928. He grew up on south Main Street in the neighboring town of Stoneham. He graduated from high school there in 1947, and then joined the United States Army.

He began as a military police officer and served in that capacity for two years, but then attended Officers Candidate School (OCS) and was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in Armor. He continued his military education at the Engineer Officer&#x27;s Course at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, the Advanced Armor Officer&#x27;s Course at Fort Knox, Kentucky, and the Intelligence School at Oberammergau, West Germany.

== Career ==

=== U.S. Army ===
After serving as a company commander during the Korean War with the 1st Cavalry Division, Buckley returned to Boston University and completed his studies, graduating in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science. It was during this time that Buckley began his first employment with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), from 1955 to 1957. He was also employed as a librarian in the Concord, Winchester and Lexington public libraries.

In 1960, Buckley joined the 320th Special Forces Detachment, which became the 11th Special Forces Group, and attended both Basic Airborne and the Special Forces Officers Course. He was assigned as an A-Detachment commander and later as a B-Detachment commander.

Colonel Buckley served in Vietnam with the U.S. Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, or MACV, as a senior advisor to the South Vietnamese Army.

He was inducted into the U.S. Army ROTC Hall of Fame in April 2022.

=== Central Intelligence Agency ===
In 1965 (or 1963, according to one source), Buckley rejoined the CIA in what became the Special Activities Division. According to Leslie Cockburn&#x27;s book, &quot;Out of Control&quot; (1987), Buckley was involved in approving CIA assassinations undertaken by controversial CIA operative Theodore Shackley. In his book, &quot;Prelude to Terror&quot; (2005) Joseph Trento claims that Buckley was &quot;one of Shackley&#x27;s oldest and dearest friends.&quot;

Buckley may have been working for the CIA while in Mexico in 1963, but this is unconfirmed. His CIA employment kept him in South Vietnam from 1965 to 1970, and he was promoted in his military capacity to Lieutenant Colonel in May 1969. After leaving Vietnam, he served in Zaire (1970–1972), Cambodia (1972), Egypt (1972–1978), and Pakistan (1978–1979).

In 1983, Buckley succeeded Ken Haas as the Beirut Station Chief/Political Officer at the U.S. Embassy. Buckley was successfully rebuilding the network of agents lost in and due to the bombing of the U.S. Embassy after the Marine Corps barracks bombing in October 1983 when Hezbollah wrongly announced that they had also killed the CIA station chief, not yet knowing the station chief was Buckley. Their announcement was the first real indication that he was on a Hezbollah &quot;hit list&quot;.

== Kidnapping and death ==
===Background and prelude===
In recent history, Lebanon has been considered by American Intelligence agencies as a politically and socially unstable country, but throughout 1983 this instability increased dramatically. The Shi&#x27;ite population of Lebanon became increasingly radicalized and started to target Westerners and Western-owned infrastructure such as embassies.

David Barkay, a former officer in Israel&#x27;s intelligence unit 504, asserts that a spy from Hezbollah delivered a note to his operatives (Barkay among them) six days before the kidnapping occurred. The note contained a message from Imad Mughniyeh to a Hezbollah team that had been training for a kidnapping operation for months. The message instructed the team to prepare for the operation, which was set to take place in a couple of days. The note identified the target of the operation as &quot;an American senior intelligence officer&quot;. Barkay adds that it&#x27;s possible that the information about the impending kidnapping did not reach the CIA due to an &quot;egotistical&quot; dispute between the Mossad and Israel&#x27;s Military Intelligence Directorate.

===Kidnapping===
On March 16, 1984, Buckley was kidnapped by Hezbollah from his apartment building when he was leaving for work. Army Major General Carl Stiner had warned Buckley that he was in danger, but Buckley told him that &quot;I have a pretty good intelligence network. I think I&#x27;m secure.&quot; However, according to Stiner, Buckley continued to live in his apartment and travel the same route to and from work every day.

It was thought that one of the reasons he was kidnapped along with two other Americans at different times in Beirut was because of the upcoming trial of 17 Iranian-backed militants that was about to begin in Kuwait.

He was apparently tortured over the 15 months of his capture, using drills to his joints and general beating with blunt force instruments.

===Aftermath===
On November 22, 1985, Ted Shackley, Buckley&#x27;s friend and recruiter, traveled to the Atlantic Hotel in Hamburg, where he met General Manouchehr Hashemi, the former head of SAVAK&#x27;s counterintelligence division. Also at the meeting was Manucher Ghorbanifar. According to the report of this meeting that Shackley sent to the State Department, Hashemi said Ghorbanifar had &quot;fantastic&quot; contacts with Iran, but the CIA had designated him one year earlier as a &quot;fabricator&quot;. At the meeting, Shackley told Hashemi and Ghorbanifar that the United States was willing to discuss arms shipments in exchange for the four Americans kidnapped in Lebanon, although Buckley was already dead at this point.

Major General Carl Stiner stated that &quot;Buckley&#x27;s kidnapping had become a major CIA concern. Not long after his capture, his agents either vanished or were killed. It was clear that his captors had tortured him into revealing the network of agents he had established.&quot; According to the United States, Buckley had undergone 15 months of torture by Hezbollah before his death. After Buckley&#x27;s kidnapping, three videos of Buckley being tortured were sent to the CIA in Athens. Interpreters noticed puncture marks indicating he was injected with narcotics. According to several sources, as a result of his torture, he signed a 400-page statement detailing his CIA activities.

In a summary of the content of a video taken approximately seven months after the kidnapping, Buckley&#x27;s appearance was described as follows:
Buckley was close to a gibbering wretch. His words were often incoherent; he slobbered and drooled and, most unnerving of all, he would suddenly scream in terror, his eyes rolling helplessly and his body shaking. The CIA consensus was that he would be blindfolded and chained at the ankles and wrists and kept in a cell little bigger than a coffin.

===Execution===
On October 4, 1985, Islamic Jihad announced that it had executed Buckley. After Buckley&#x27;s death, Hezbollah&#x27;s concern for other hostages&#x27; health increased, with Hezbollah captors inquiring about the hostages&#x27; health and well-being.

The United States National Security Council acknowledged in an unclassified note that Buckley probably died on June 3, 1985, of a heart attack.

Buckley&#x27;s remains were recovered by Major Jens Nielsen (Royal Danish Army) attached to the United Nations Observation Group Beirut on December 27, 1991, after they were dumped on a road near Beirut airport. His body was returned to the United States on December 28, 1991, and was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

== Legacy ==

An agency memorial service was held in August 1987 to commemorate his death. A public memorial service was held with full military honors at Arlington on May 13, 1988, just short of three years after his presumed death date. At the service, attended by more than 100 colleagues and friends, CIA Director William H. Webster eulogized Buckley, saying, &quot;Bill&#x27;s success in collecting information in situations of incredible danger was exceptional, even remarkable.&quot;

There is a small park (dedicated May 30, 2010) with a memorial in his memory in the main square of his hometown of Stoneham, Massachusetts.

== Awards and decorations ==
Among Buckley&#x27;s decorations and awards are the Silver Star, Soldier&#x27;s Medal, Bronze Star Medal with &quot;V&quot; Device, two Purple Hearts, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Combat Infantryman&#x27;s Badge, and the Parachutist Badge. He also received the Vietnam Cross of Gallantry with bronze star from the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. Among his CIA awards are the Intelligence Star, Exceptional Service Medallion and Distinguished Intelligence Cross.
Among Buckley&#x27;s civilian awards are the Freedom Foundation Award for Lexington Green Diorama, Collegium and Academy of Distinguished Alumni Boston University. The William F. Buckley Memorial Park in Stoneham, Massachusetts, is dedicated to his memory.

The 51st star on the CIA Memorial Wall represents him, surrounded by about 132 other stars (as of January 2021) representing CIA officers killed in the line of duty. Approximately 35 of the stars are for unnamed agents whose identities have not been revealed for national security reasons. His name and year of death are recorded in the &quot;Book of Honor&quot; at the wall. The CIA awarded him the Distinguished Intelligence Cross, an Intelligence Star, and an Exceptional Service Medal, but has not said whether any of these were issued posthumously (although at least one award of the Exceptional Service Medal must have been made posthumously).




== Personal life ==
According to the biographical information distributed by the CIA, Buckley was &quot;an avid reader of politics and history&quot; and &quot;a collector and builder of miniature soldiers.&quot; The latter hobby enabled him to become a principal artisan in the creation of a panorama at the Lexington Battlefield Tourist Center near his native Medford, Massachusetts. The press release also said he owned an antique shop and was an amateur artist and a collector of fine art. It called him &quot;a very private and discreet individual&quot;.

<text>Warren Robinson Austin (November 12, 1877 – December 25, 1962) was an American politician and diplomat who served as United States Senator from Vermont and U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations.

A native of Highgate Center, Vermont, Austin was educated in Highgate and Bakersfield, and also studied in Quebec to learn French. He graduated from the University of Vermont in 1899, studied law with his father, was admitted to the bar in 1902, and practiced in partnership with his father.

Austin settled in St. Albans, became active in politics as a Republican, and served in several local offices, including Grand Juror, Chairman of the city Republican committee, and State&#x27;s Attorney of Franklin County (1904–1906). In 1908, he was chairman of the state Republican convention, and he served as Mayor of St. Albans from 1909 to 1910. From 1907 to 1915, Austin was a Commissioner for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In 1917, he moved to Burlington, where he continued to practice law. Austin&#x27;s prominence continued to grow, and he served as a University of Vermont trustee from 1914 to 1941, and an attorney practicing before the United States Court for China from 1916 to 1917. Austin served as a special counsel for the state of Vermont from 1925 to 1927 during the process of setting the official boundary between Vermont and New Hampshire.

In 1931, Austin was elected to the U.S. Senate in a special election, defeating Frank C. Partridge, who had been appointed to fill the vacancy after the death of Frank L. Greene. From 1939 to 1942, Austin was the Senate&#x27;s Assistant Minority Leader (Minority Whip). In 1946 he resigned to accept president Harry S. Truman&#x27;s appointment as U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations. He took office in January, 1947, and was the first official holder of this post. Austin served until January 1953, when the Eisenhower administration took office. He resided in Burlington during his retirement, and died there in 1962. Austin was buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington.

==Early life==
Austin was born in Highgate, Vermont on November 12, 1877, one of six children born to Chauncey Goodrich Austin and Ann Mathilda Robinson. He attended local schools and Bakersfield&#x27;s Brigham Academy and also studied in Quebec to obtain fluency in French. He graduated from the University of Vermont in 1899. He then studied law with his father, attained admission to the bar, and entered practice in 1902 in partnership with his father.

==Early career==
A Republican, he held local offices in St. Albans, including Grand Juror and Chairman of the Republican committee. (In Vermont, Grand Jurors used to serve as city and town prosecutors. After revisions of the court system, it is now a vestige or legacy office.) In 1904 he was elected State&#x27;s Attorney of Franklin County, a position he held for two years.

Austin was chairman of the Vermont Republican State Convention in 1908, and Mayor of St. Albans from 1909 to 1910.

He served as a Commissioner for the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit from 1907 to 1915. In 1912, he served on the Assay Commission for the United States Mint, which reviewed Mint operations by examining and testing coins for weight and fineness.

In 1914 he was appointed a trustee of the University of Vermont in 1914, a position that he retained until 1941.

From 1916 to 1917, he practiced before the United States Court for China as the representative of the American International Corporation and the Siems-Carey Railway &amp; Canal Company.

In 1917 Austin moved to Burlington, where he continued to practice law.

From 1925 to 1937, Austin served as a special counsel for Vermont during the process of setting the official boundary between Vermont and New Hampshire, working with John G. Sargent.

In the early 1930s, Austin employed Harold J. Arthur as a stenographer. Arthur studied law with Austin, attained admission to the bar, and later served as Governor of Vermont.

==United States Senator==
He was elected to the Senate on March 31, 1931, defeating appointed Senator Frank C. Partridge in the special election to complete the term of the deceased Frank L. Greene. Austin took his seat the next day, and won re-election in 1934 and 1940.

In the Senate, Austin opposed the New Deal but championed internationalist causes, standing with President Franklin D. Roosevelt on issues such as Lend-Lease. He became Assistant Minority Leader (Minority Whip) in 1939, served until 1942, and acted as Minority Leader during incumbent Charles L. McNary&#x27;s run for Vice President in 1940. In 1943 he became a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.

Austin resigned his Senate seat on August 2, 1946, to become the US Ambassador to the United Nations. In November, he was succeeded by Ralph E. Flanders.

==United Nations Ambassador==

In June 1946, President Harry S. Truman nominated Austin to be Ambassador to the United Nations. Because of the provision in the US Constitution prohibiting members of Congress from accepting an office created during their terms, he could not assume the post until January, 1947. As a result, Truman appointed Austin Special Representative to the President and advisor to UN Ambassador Herschel Johnson.

When he did take office in January, 1947 Austin was the first official U.S. Ambassador to the UN. (Edward Stettinius, Jr. and Johnson had been representatives to the United Nations Conference on International Organization, the body that established the full United Nations.)

He was a key figure at the start of the Cold War. During his term, the UN was involved in the creation of Israel and was also involved when India and Pakistan fought the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947 and were partitioned. In 1948, there was a Communist coup in Czechoslovakia, the Soviets blockaded Berlin and precipitated the Berlin Airlift, and Congress passed the Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe. In 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created, and Mao Tse-tung established the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1950, China annexed Tibet and North Korea invaded South Korea. The UN debated, considered responses and took action on all of these issues, and Austin became known internationally for his advocacy of Western Bloc positions.

Austin&#x27;s term at the UN is also remembered for a supposed quote that is likely not completely accurate. In discussing the conflict between the Muslim Palestinian people and the Jewish people of Israel at Israel&#x27;s founding, Austin supposedly said, &quot;I hope Arabs and Jews will settle their differences in a truly Christian spirit.&quot; According to his deputy, the language of that supposed quote was inexact when it was reported by the media, and Austin was attempting to communicate that as a Christian, he would not show partiality to either Muslims or Jews in the dispute over the creation of Israel.

He retired after being succeeded by Henry Cabot Lodge Jr., in January 1953, at the start of the Eisenhower administration.

==Memberships==
He was a member of the American Bar Association, Vermont Bar Association (president, 1923–24), American Judicature Society, Loyal Legion, Sons of the American Revolution, Society of the Cincinnati (honorary), Freemasons, Shriners, Elks, Owls, Odd Fellows, Rotary Club, and the Kappa Sigma fraternity.

==Later life==
An amateur orchardist, Austin tended to his trees and pursued other hobbies while living in retirement in Burlington. In October 1956 he suffered a stroke that caused him to curtail many of his activities. Austin died in Burlington on December 25, 1962. He is buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Burlington.

==Honors==
Austin received honorary degrees from Columbia University, Norwich University, Bates College, Princeton University, Lafayette College, the University of Vermont, Dartmouth College, Boston University, American University, the University of the State of New York, and the University of Santo Domingo.

He is memorialized in the Vermont State House Hall of Inscriptions.

==Family==
In 1901 Austin married Mildred Marie Lucas. Their children included attorney Warren R. Austin Jr. (1902–1979), and career United States Army officer Edward Lucas Austin (1910–1980).

Warren Austin&#x27;s brother Roswell M. Austin served as Speaker of the Vermont House of Representatives from 1925 to 1927.

<doc id="353399" wikidata="Q733660" url="?curid=353399" title="Yohanan ben Zakkai">
<text>Yohanan ben Zakkai (; 1st century CE), sometimes abbreviated as  for Rabbi Yohanan ben Zakkai, was a tanna, an important Jewish sage during the late Second Temple period during the transformative post-destruction era. He was a primary contributor to the core text of Rabbinic Judaism, the Mishnah. His name is often preceded by the honorific title &quot;Rabban&quot;. He is widely regarded as one of the most important Jewish figures of his time, and his escape from the Roman destruction of Jerusalem (which allowed him to continue teaching) may have been instrumental in Rabbinic Judaism&#x27;s survival post-Temple. His tomb is located in Tiberias within the Maimonides burial compound.

Yohanan was the first Jewish sage attributed the title of rabbi in the Mishnah.

== Life ==
The Talmud reports that, in the mid-first century, he was particularly active in opposing the interpretations of Jewish law (&quot;Halakha&quot;) by the Sadducees and produced counter-arguments to their objections to the interpretations of the Pharisees. So dedicated was he to opposing the Sadducean view of Jewish law that he prevented the Jewish high priest of his time, a Sadducee, from following the Sadducaic interpretation of the Red Heifer ritual.
His home at this time was in Arraba, a village in the Galilee, where he spent eighteen years. Although living among them, he found the attitude of Galileans to be objectionable, allegedly exclaiming that they hated the Torah and would therefore &quot;fall into the hands of robbers.&quot; During the outbreak of hostilities, he settled in Jerusalem.

=== Escape from Jerusalem (Gittin 56a) ===
During the siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE in the First Jewish–Roman War, he argued in favour of peace: according to the Talmud (&quot;Gittin&quot; 56a), when he found the anger of the besieged populace to be intolerable, he arranged a secret escape from the city inside a coffin, helped by his nephew and Zealot leader Ben Batiach, so that he could negotiate with Vespasian (who, at this time, was still just a military commander). Ben Zakkai correctly predicted that Vespasian would become Emperor and that the Temple would soon be destroyed. In return, Vespasian granted Yochanan three wishes: the salvation of Yavne and its sages and the descendants of Rabban Gamliel, who was of the Davidic line, and a physician to treat Rabbi Zadok, who had fasted for 40 years to stave off the destruction of Jerusalem.

=== Yavne and afterwards ===
Upon the destruction of Jerusalem, Yochanan converted his school at Yavne into the Jewish religious centre, insisting that certain privileges given by Jewish law uniquely to Jerusalem should be transferred to Yavne. His school functioned as a re-establishment of the Sanhedrin so that Judaism could decide how to deal with the loss of the sacrificial altars of the temple in Jerusalem and other pertinent questions. Referring to a passage in the Book of Hosea (&quot;I desired mercy, and not sacrifice&quot;), he helped persuade the Sanhedrin to—as the temple had been destroyed—replace animal sacrifice with prayer, a practice that remains the basis of Jewish worship. Eventually, Rabbinic Judaism emerged from the council&#x27;s conclusions.

In his last years, he taught at Bror Hayil, near Yavne. His habit was to wear his Tefillin (phylacteries) all day, both in summer and winter. However, during the hot summer months, he only wore his arm phylactery (&quot;shel yad&quot;). His students were present at his deathbed and were requested by him, in his penultimate words according to the Talmudic record, to reduce their risk of ritual contamination conveyed by a corpse:
More enigmatic were the Talmud&#x27;s record of his last words, which seem to relate to Jewish messianism:
According to the Talmud, Yochanan ben Zakkai lived 120 years. Upon his death, his students returned to Yavneh, and he was buried in the city of Tiberias; eleven centuries later, Maimonides was buried nearby. As leader of the Sanhedrin, he was succeeded by Gamliel II.

===Yochanan&#x27;s encounter with Vespasian===

The following story is told in the Jewish classic, &quot;Avoth deRabbi Nathan,&quot; version B, chapter 4:5, about the war with Rome.

== Enactments ==
Jewish tradition records Yohanan ben Zakkai as being extremely dedicated to religious study, claiming that &quot;no one ever found him engaged in anything but study&quot;. He is considered to be someone who passed on the teachings of his predecessors; on the other hand, numerous homiletic and exegetical sayings are attributed to him and he is known for establishing a number of edicts in the post-destruction era:
# After the destruction of Jerusalem, the &quot;shofar&quot; shall be blown in &quot;beit din&quot; when &quot;Rosh HaShana&quot; falls on &quot;Shabbat&quot; (prior to the destruction, it was only blown in Jerusalem and its environs on &quot;Shabbat&quot;)
# After the destruction of Jerusalem, the Four Species shall be taken in the hand for the entire &quot;Sukkot&quot; (prior to the destruction, it was only taken for the entire holiday in Jerusalem and on the first of the holiday elsewhere)
# After the destruction of Jerusalem, eating of &quot;chadash&quot; (new grain harvest) shall be prohibited for the entire Day of Waving or &quot;yom haneif&quot; (i.e. the day that the &quot;omer&quot; sacrifice was traditionally offered, on the sixteenth of Nisan). Prior to the destruction, the new grain harvest could be eaten on the 16th day of the lunar month Nisan, immediately after the &quot;omer&quot; was offered in the Temple.
# After the destruction of Jerusalem, witnesses for the new moon shall be accepted all day (prior to the destruction, witnesses were only accepted until the afternoon &quot;tamid&quot; offering)
# After the destruction of Jerusalem, witnesses for the new moon shall only go to the place of assembly, and not follow the &quot;Nasi&quot; or &quot;prince&quot; (prior to the destruction, witnesses were only accepted at the location of the &quot;Nasi&quot; in Jerusalem)
# &quot;Kohanim&quot; (those of the priestly caste) may not go up to bless the people while wearing footwear
# After the destruction of Jerusalem, witnesses for the new moon may not violate the &quot;Shabbat&quot; except for the months of &quot;Nisan&quot; and &quot;Tishrei&quot; (prior to the destruction, witnesses were allowed to violate the Sabbath for all months)
# After the destruction of Jerusalem, converts no longer separate monies for their conversion sacrifice (prior to the destruction, part of the conversion process was to bring a sacrifice in the Temple in Jerusalem)
# The identity of the ninth edict is disputed:
## After the destruction of Jerusalem, the Second Tithe was permitted to be exchanged for money within a day&#x27;s journey of Jerusalem (prior to the destruction, exchanges were only permitted for those living farther than a day&#x27;s journey)
## After the destruction of Jerusalem, the red string associated with the &quot;chatas&quot; of &quot;Yom Kippur&quot; was sent with the &quot;ish iti&quot; (designee) to &quot;Azazel&quot; (prior to the destruction, the red string was maintained on the premises of the Temple)

== Quotes ==
If you are holding a sapling in your hand and someone tells you, &#x27;Come quickly, the Messiah is here!&#x27;, first finish planting the tree and then go to greet the Messiah.
If you have been studious in learning the Torah, do not take credit to yourself, since it is to this end that you were created.

Some of Rabbi Yohanan&#x27;s comments were of an esoteric nature. On one occasion he advises that mankind should seek to understand the infinity of God, by imagining the heavens being extended to unthinkable distances. He argued that Job&#x27;s piety was not based on the love of God, but on the fear of Him.

He was challenged to resolve several biblical curiosities by a Roman commander, who was familiar with the Torah, but whose name has been lost in confusion. Among the issues were the fact that the numbers in the Book of Numbers didn&#x27;t add up to their totals, and the reasoning behind the ritual of the red heifer; on this latter question the answer he gave didn&#x27;t satisfy his own students, so he decreed that the ritual was one that shouldn&#x27;t be questioned.

<doc id="353400" wikidata="Q2019908" url="?curid=353400" title="Liskeard">
<text>Liskeard ( ; ) is an ancient stannary and market town in south-east Cornwall, England, United Kingdom. It is situated approximately 20 miles (32 km) west of Plymouth, west of the Devon border, and 12 miles (20 km) east of Bodmin. The Bodmin Moor lies to the north-west of the town. The total population of the town at the 2011 census was 11,366

==History==

The Cornish place name element &quot;Lis&quot;, along with ancient privileges accorded the town, indicates that the settlement was once a high status &#x27;court&#x27;. King Dungarth whose cross is a few miles north near St Cleer is thought to be a descendant of the early 8th century king Gerren of Dumnonia and is said to have held his court in Liskeard (&quot;Lis-Cerruyt&quot;). Liskeard (Liscarret) was at the time of the Domesday Survey an important manor with a mill rendering 12d. yearly and a market rendering 4s. William the Conqueror gave it to Robert, Count of Mortain by whom it was held in demesne. Ever since that time it has passed with the earldom or Duchy of Cornwall. A Norman castle was built there after the Conquest, which eventually fell into disuse in the later Middle Ages. By 1538 when visited by John Leland only a few insignificant remains were to be seen. Sir Richard Carew writing in 1602 concurred;
Historically, Liskeard belonged to the ancient hundred of West Wivelshire

Liskeard was one of the 17 Antiqua maneria of the Duchy of Cornwall. The market charter was granted by Richard, Earl of Cornwall (brother of Henry III) in 1240. Since then, it has been an important centre for agriculture. The seal of the borough of Liskeard was Ar. a fleur-de-lis and perched thereon and respecting each other two birds in chief two annulets and in flank two feathers.

When Wilkie Collins wrote of his visit to the town in his &quot;Rambles Beyond Railways&quot; he had a low opinion of it: &quot;that abomination of desolation, a large agricultural country town&quot;. The town went through a period of economic prosperity during the pre-20th century boom in tin mining, becoming a key centre in the industry as a location for a stannary and coinage.

The A38 trunk road used to pass through the town centre but a dual carriageway bypass now carries traffic south of the town, leaving the town centre accessible but with low traffic levels.

==Present day==
Liskeard was one of the last towns in Cornwall to have a regular livestock market, ending in 2017. There is a range of restaurants, cafés and pubs in the town, and some shops retain their Victorian shopfronts and interiors.

Liskeard puts on a pantomime in the last week of January and holds a carnival every June. Every July, Liskeard holds a large agricultural show, The Liskeard Show, which is always held on the second Saturday in July. St Matthew&#x27;s Fair was originally established by charter in 1266, the fair was re-established in 1976 which runs in September/October. Every December, there is street entertainment and a lantern parade for &#x27;Liskeard Lights Up&#x27;, when the Christmas lights are switched on.

==Notable buildings==

The town boasts St. Martin&#x27;s, the second largest parish church in Cornwall Built on the site of the former Norman church, the oldest parts of the current structure date back to the 15th century. Other places of worship include a Roman Catholic church and Methodist chapels.

*The Foresters Hall now houses the Tourist Information Office and Liskeard &amp; District Museum. The Foresters still meet in the town at the Public Rooms in West Street.
*Stuart House (on the Parade) was used by Charles I as a lodging in 1644, when his forces were chasing the Parliamentarians. Restored, it is now used as a community building for arts, heritage and community events
*Luxstowe House (1831). Designed by George Wightwick for William Glencross.
*Liskeard Guildhall was built in 1859 and has a prominent clock tower.
*The Public Hall was constructed in 1890.
*Webb&#x27;s House (formerly Webb&#x27;s Hotel) is a classic early Victorian market-town hotel featuring in royal visits, parliamentary declarations and much more but recently converted into flats and is the home of the local newspaper &quot;The Cornish Times&quot;.
*Pencubitt House was built in 1897 for J. H. Blamey, a wealthy wool merchant. The house was designed by local architect John Sansom, responsible for many Liskeard homes of that period.
*The Liskeard Union Workhouse, architect John Foulston of Plymouth (later the Lamellion Hospital, now flats).
* The Pipe Well, a holy well.

==Politics==
===Local politics===
Liskeard is a civil parish, with some services provided by the unitary authority of Cornwall Council. There are 3 electoral wards for Cornwall Council in Liskeard, including Dobwalls. Liskeard was the admin HQ of the former Caradon District Council.

===UK Parliament===
In the year 1294, Liskeard began to send two members to Parliament, but this was reduced to one by the 1832 Reform Act. The Members of Parliament (MPs) have included Edward Gibbon, author of &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, and Isaac Foot.

Liskeard is part of the South East Cornwall constituency, represented by a Labour Member of Parliament, Anna Gerald in the House of Commons. The seat was held by Conservative MP Sheryl Murray prior to the 4 July 2024 General Election.

==Education==
The first school in Liskeard was founded in 1550 on Castle Hill. For a time it was maintained by the Earls of St Germans, but it closed around 1834 due to a decline in numbers and financial difficulties. From 1835 a series of private schools existed in the borough, until 1908 when Cornwall Education Committee built the County School at Old Road. From 1945 it was known as Liskeard Grammar School until September 1978 when it became the Lower School site of Liskeard School, following amalgamation with the town&#x27;s secondary modern school.

Liskeard County Secondary School received its first pupils on Monday 12 September 1960, and was formally opened by the Minister of Education, Sir David Eccles on 7 July the following year. Costing £100,000, it was built to accommodate around 500 pupils on the site of the current school at Luxtowe. Its glass and steel structure made &quot;free use of fresh air and sunlight&quot; according to local newspaper reports, whilst other modern features included a well-equipped gymnasium, automated central heating and synchronised clocks across the school, operated from the secretary&#x27;s office. A new block was opened by Margaret Thatcher, Secretary of State for Education and Science in 1974, following the raising of the school leaving age from 15 years to 16, two years earlier. Like many similar secondary schools in Cornwall, from the late 1970s it housed the Upper School (3rd Year / Year 9 upwards), when it merged with the town&#x27;s grammar school to create a split-site comprehensive school.

Twenty years later, with increased pupil numbers requiring many to be taught in temporary buildings, the need for improvements to Liskeard&#x27;s secondary and primary schools was being raised in Parliament. By the late 1990s, Liskeard School and Community College had been extended at Luxstowe, and the Old Road site closed and redeveloped for housing. Further multimillion-pound science and technology facilities were added in 2002, and the original 1960s and 1970s buildings were completely modernised by 2011. As Cornwall&#x27;s only school with an engineering speciality, it now caters for approximately 1300 students aged between 11 and 19, and employs around 200 teaching and non-teaching, full- and part-time staff. It also has a creche, a teenage advice and information service, a centre for children with autism, and facilities at Moorswater where some engineering-based courses are taught.

There are two primary schools in Liskeard: St Martin&#x27;s Church of England (Voluntary Aided) School in Lake Lane and Hillfort Primary School on Old Road. The latter was opened in September 2006 following the renaming of Liskeard Junior School after its merger with Liskeard Infant School.

Caradon Short Stay School (previously known as a Pupil Referral Unit) is located in West Street, on the site of the former Liskeard Infant School. It provides education for students aged 11–16 from across south east Cornwall who are unable to attend a mainstream school or special school. The nearest independent schools are in Plymouth and Tavistock, Devon.

==Transport==
Liskeard railway station, on the London Paddington to Penzance Cornish Main Line, and the A38 trunk road provide the town with rapid access to Plymouth, the rest of Cornwall and the motorway network. The town is also served by the Looe Valley branch line to Looe. There are regular bus services to various parts of Cornwall.

==Leisure and sports==
There is a leisure centre at Lux Park on the north side of the town: there is a bowling club and Liskerrett Community Centre, that hosts athletic and leisure clubs, on the southern side. The town has a Non-League football club Liskeard Athletic F.C. who play at Lux park. The town also has a rugby and cricket club who are both well-supported. The town has a King George V Playing Field. Live music and various theatrical events frequently take place in the unusual but acoustically good Carnglaze Caverns just to the north.

===Cornish wrestling===
There were Cornish wrestling tournaments, for prizes, held in the field near the Union hotel at the canal, in a field on Station Road, Lux Park, Nanswhyden on Old Road and the field near the Fountain Inn. in Liskeard for centuries.

Abel Werry (?-1824), from Liskeard was for many years the champion wrestler of Cornwall during the 1700s.

===Leisure trails===
There are three trails, each has its own blue commemorative plaque (these were unveiled by former town mayor, Sandra Preston).
*Footpath from the town to the railway station: the path was built by Thomas Lang, who was a former mayor, in 1890.
*Trail around the north of the town centre, including the Parade and the ornamental fountain. The fountain was given to the town by Michael Loam, whose father (also called Michael Loam) invented the Man engine (a device for lifting men up and down mineshafts, and used in many mines throughout Cornwall &amp; West Devon).
*Trail around the southern part of the town, commemorating Lt. Lapenotière, who brought back the news of the Battle of Trafalgar to England. For this Lt. Lapenotière was given a silver spice sprinkler by King George III. The sprinkler is still owned by the mayor&#x27;s office, and is exhibited occasionally.

==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC South West and ITV West Country. Television signals are received from the nearby Caradon Hill TV transmitter. Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cornwall on 95.2 FM, Heart West on 105.1 FM and its own community radio station Liskeard Radio broadcasting part time online. Its local newspaper is the Cornish Times (formerly Liskeard Gazette &amp; Journal).

==Freemasonry==
Liskeard has a sizeable Masonic presence with no fewer than eight Masonic bodies meeting at the Masonic Hall on The Parade,

* St Martin&#x27;s Lodge No. 510 Date of Warrant, 5 March 1845

<text>Field Marshal William Joseph Slim, 1st Viscount Slim, (6 August 1891 – 14 December 1970), usually known as Bill Slim, was a British military commander and the 13th Governor-General of Australia.

Slim saw active service in both the First and Second World Wars and was wounded in action three times. During the Second World War he led the Fourteenth Army, the so-called &quot;forgotten army&quot; in the Burma campaign. After the war he became the first British officer who had served in the Indian Army to be appointed Chief of the Imperial General Staff. From 1953 to 1959 he was Governor-General of Australia.

In the early 1930s, Slim also wrote novels, short stories, and other publications under the pen name Anthony Mills.

==Early years==
William Slim was born at 72 Belmont Road, St Andrews, Bristol, the son of John Slim by his marriage to Charlotte Tucker, and was baptised there at St Bonaventure&#x27;s Roman Catholic church, Bishopston. He was brought up first in Bristol, attending St Bonaventure&#x27;s Primary School, then St Brendan&#x27;s College, before moving to Birmingham in his teens. In Birmingham, he attended St Philip&#x27;s Grammar School, Edgbaston, and King Edward&#x27;s School, Birmingham.

After leaving school, his father&#x27;s failure in business as a wholesale ironmonger meant that the family could afford to send only one son, Slim&#x27;s older brother, to the University of Birmingham, so between 1910 and 1914 Slim taught in a primary school and worked as a clerk in Stewarts &amp; Lloyds, a metal-tube maker.

==First World War==
Despite having no other connection to the university, in 1912 Slim joined the Birmingham University Officers&#x27; Training Corps, and he was thus able to be commissioned as a temporary second lieutenant into the Royal Warwickshire Regiment on 22 August 1914, on the outbreak of the First World War; in later life, as a result of his modest social origins and his unpretentious manner, he was sometimes wrongly supposed to have risen from the ranks. He was badly wounded at Gallipoli. On return to England, he was granted a regular commission as a second lieutenant in the West India Regiment.

In October 1916, he rejoined the Royal Warwickshire Regiment in Mesopotamia. On 4 March 1917, he was promoted to lieutenant (with seniority back-dated to October 1915). He was wounded a second time in 1917. Having been previously given the temporary rank of captain, he was awarded the Military Cross on 7 February 1918 for actions in Mesopotamia.

Evacuated to India, he was given the temporary rank of major in the 6th Gurkha Rifles on 2 November 1918. He was formally promoted to captain and transferred to the Indian Army on 22 May 1919.

==Interwar career==
Slim became battalion adjutant with the 6th Gurkha Rifles in 1921.

On 1 January 1926, he married Aileen Robertson, daughter of Rev John Anderson Robertson (d.1941) minister of Cramond near Edinburgh. They had one son and one daughter. Later that year Slim was sent to the Staff College, Quetta. On 5 June 1929, he was appointed a General Staff Officer, Second Grade.

On 1 January 1930, he was given the brevet rank of major, with formal promotion to this rank made on 19 May 1933. His performance at Staff College resulted in his appointment first to Army Headquarters India in Delhi and then to Staff College, Camberley, in England (as a General Staff Officer, Second Grade), where he taught from 1934 to 1937. During this period, he also wrote novels, short stories, and other publications under the pen name of Anthony Mills, in order to further his literary interests, as well as to supplement his then modest army salary.

He attended the Imperial Defence College in 1937. The following year he was promoted to lieutenant colonel and given command of the 2nd Battalion, 7th Gurkha Rifles. In 1939 he was briefly given the temporary rank of brigadier as commander of his battalion. On 8 June 1939, he was promoted to colonel (again with temporary rank of brigadier) and appointed head of the Senior Officers&#x27; School, Belgaum in India.

==Second World War==
===East African Campaign===
On the outbreak of the Second World War, Slim was given command of the 10th Indian Infantry Brigade of the 5th Indian Infantry Division and was sent to Sudan. He took part in the East African campaign to liberate Ethiopia from the Italians. Slim was wounded again in Eritrea. On 21 January 1941, he was hit when his vehicle was strafed by Fiat CR.42 fighters during the advance on Agordat.

===Middle East===
Recovering from his wounds but still unfit for active service, Slim was temporarily employed on the General Staff at GHQ in Delhi. He was involved in the planning for potential operations in Iraq where trouble was expected. By early May 1941 Slim had been appointed Brigadier General Staff (chief staff officer) to Edward Quinan the commander designate for operations in Iraq, arriving in Basra on 7 May. Not long afterwards, Major-General Fraser, commanding the 10th Indian Infantry Division, fell ill and was relieved of his command, and Slim was promoted to take his place on 15 May 1941 with the acting rank of major-general.

He led the Indian 10th Infantry Division as part of Iraqforce during the Anglo-Iraqi War, the Syria–Lebanon campaign (where the division advanced up the river Euphrates to capture Deir ez-Zor), and the invasion of Persia. He was twice mentioned in despatches during 1941.

===Burma campaign===


In March 1942, Slim was given command of Burma Corps, also known as BurCorps, consisting of the 17th Indian Infantry Division and 1st Burma Division. Slim was made acting lieutenant general on 8 May 1942. The corps was under attack in Burma by the Japanese and, heavily outclassed by the more mobile and flexible Japanese, was soon forced to withdraw to India. On 28 October 1942, Slim was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

Slim then took over XV Corps under the command of the Eastern Army. His command covered the coastal approaches from Burma to India, east of Chittagong. He had a series of disputes with Noel Irwin, commander of Eastern Army and, as a result, Irwin (although an army commander) took personal control of the initial advance by XV Corps into the Arakan Peninsula. The operations ended in disaster, during which Slim was restored to command of XV Corps, albeit too late to salvage the situation. Generals Irwin and Slim blamed each other for the result, but in the end Irwin was removed from his command, and Slim was promoted to command the new Fourteenth Army—formed from IV Corps (United Kingdom) (Imphal), XV Corps (Arakan) and XXXIII Corps (reserve) – later joined by XXXIV Corps. On 14 January 1943, Slim was appointed a Companion of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions in the Middle East during 1941. The American historians Alan Millet and Williamson Murray described Slim as: 

Slim quickly got on with the task of training his new army to take the fight to the enemy. His basic premise was that off-road mobility was paramount: much heavy equipment was exchanged for mule- or air-transported equipment, and motor transport was kept to a minimum and restricted to vehicles that could cope with some of the worst combat terrain on Earth. The new doctrine dictated that if the Japanese had cut the lines of communication, then they too were surrounded. All units were to form defensive &#x27;boxes&#x27;, to be resupplied by air and assisted by integrated close air support and armour. The boxes were designed as an effective response to the tactics of infiltration practised by the Japanese in the war. Slim also supported increased offensive patrolling and night training, to encourage his soldiers to lose both their fear of the jungle and their belief that Japanese soldiers were better jungle fighters. He also instructed them to hold their positions once outflanked.

The Chin Hills formed a natural defensive barrier into Burma, which Slim would have preferred to outflank by an amphibious operation by landing further down the coast of Burma, but demands of the war in Europe meant the necessary landing craft were not available, forcing Slim to devise plans for advancing into Burma overland through the Chin hills. At the same time, the Japanese 15th Army, which formed the main striking force of the Burma Area Army, had grown from four divisions at the beginning of 1943 to eight divisions by the end of 1943 as the Japanese made preparations for invading India, which increased the difficulties of an overland advance into Burma. By 1943, the Burma Railway, which cost the lives of thousands of prisoners of war who built it, was finished; this allowed the Japanese to reinforce the Burma Area Army, and made invading India possible.

As Slim went about training his men for the rigours of jungle warfare, he clashed with Brigadier Orde Wingate, who took away some of Slim&#x27;s best Gurkha, British and African units for his Chindit raiding group. Slim argued against the loss of his better units to Wingate, and maintained that though Wingate had a successful career in Palestine and Ethiopia he would discover that the Japanese were a considerably tougher foe than the Palestinians and the Italians that Wingate had hitherto been fighting. However, Slim did approve of Wingate&#x27;s plans for aid to the hill tribes of Burma. The various hill peoples of Burma such as the Kachins, Karens, Chin, Nagas and the Shan collectively amounted to about 7 million of Burma&#x27;s 17 million people, and unlike the Bamars, who had welcomed the Japanese as liberators, had stayed loyal to the British when the Japanese invaded. The hill peoples of Burma had suffered under Japanese rule, and were more than willing to wage guerrilla warfare against them. Slim approved of the plans of the SOE and OSS to provide arms and training to the hill tribes as a way to tie down Japanese forces that would otherwise be deployed against him.

At the start of 1944, Slim held the substantive rank of colonel with a war substantive rank of major-general and the acting, then upgraded to temporary, rank of lieutenant-general. In January 1944, when the Second Arakan Offensive was met by a Japanese counter-offensive, the Indian 7th Infantry Division was quickly surrounded along with parts of the Indian 5th Infantry Division and the 81st (West Africa) Division. The 7th Indian Division&#x27;s defence was based largely on the &quot;Admin Box&quot; formed initially from drivers, cooks and suppliers. They were supplied by air, thus negating the importance of their lost supply lines. The Japanese forces were able to halt the offensive into Arakan but were unable to decisively defeat the allied forces or advance beyond the surrounded formations.

In early 1944, the Japanese Prime Minister, General Hideki Tojo, approved of plans for victory in Asia, calling for two operations, Operation U-Go as the invasion of India was code-named and Operation Ichi-Go which was intended to defeat China once and for all. The two operations in India and China were closely linked given that American supplies for China were flown over &quot;the Hump&quot; of the Himalayas and the Japanese wanted to take the Indian province of Assam in part to close the American air bases in India that sustained China at the same time that they were launching Operation Ichi-Go, the biggest Japanese offensive of all time, involving 2 million men. The Japanese knew that they lacked the logistics to invade India, and the plans for U-Go were based on the assumption that the British Fourteenth Army would just collapse, allowing the Japanese 15th Army to capture enough food to prevent its men from starving to death. Following the Japanese 15th Army into India was the Indian National Army commanded by Subhas Chandra Bose, an ardent nationalist. The Japanese believed that the mere presence of Bose in India would inspire the men of the Indian Army to mutiny and murder their British officers, and set off an anti-British revolution that would allow the Japanese 15th Army to take all of India.

Slim was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1944 New Year Honours. On 12 March 1944 the Japanese launched an invasion of India aimed at Imphal, hundreds of miles to the north. General Renya Mutaguchi of the Burma Area Army announced the invasion of India was &quot;The March into Delhi&quot; as he expected the invasion to end with him marching in triumph into New Delhi. Slim knew from signals intelligence that the Japanese were going to invade in March 1944, but as Murray and Millet wrote &quot;...he had little choice, but to meet it with the forces on hand – the IV Corps of three Anglo-Indian divisions – or surrender his own plans to take the general offensive into Burma in 1944.&quot; Slim chose to fight a defensive campaign to break the Japanese before launching his offensive into Burma, believing that superior British tanks, logistics and air power would allow him to inflict a decisive defeat on Mutaguchi. However, the Japanese advanced more swiftly than Slim had expected up the mud roads of Burma into India, leading to a period of crisis as the fate of India hung in the balance. Slim airlifted two entire veteran divisions (5th and 7th Indian) from battle in the Arakan, straight into battle in the north. Desperate defensive actions were fought at places such as Imphal, Sangshak and Kohima, while the RAF and USAAF kept the forces supplied from the air. Slim ordered his men to hold their ground, forbade any retreat, and informed his men who were surrounded by the Japanese that supplies would be flown in from the air to allow them to hold out. Slim decided to send the IV Corps to relieve Imphal while gambling that the 5th Indian Division could hold out at Kohima, though Slim knew that if Kohima fell, then the Japanese could be able to sever the Assam railroad at Dimapur, which could cut off the British Fourteenth Army from its main supply line. The Battle of Kohima was a fiercely fought battle as Murray and Millet wrote: &quot;Nowhere in World War II – even on the Eastern Front – did the combatants fight with more mindless savagery&quot;, but Kohima held. As late as 1 June 1944, Field Marshal Sir Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS), wrote in his diary that he saw &quot;disaster staring us in the face&quot; in Assam, but Slim was more confident, believing he could smash the Japanese attempt to take India. While the Japanese were able to advance and encircle the formations of British Fourteenth Army, they were unable to defeat those same forces or break out of the jungles along the Indian frontier. The Japanese advance stalled. The Japanese, who had a contempt for British and Indian troops based on their performance in 1941–42, refused to give up even after the monsoon started and large parts of their army were wrecked by conducting operations in impossible conditions. The initial Japanese plan was to capture Allied stocks of food, medicine and fuel to sustain their advance, but they failed to capture any stockpiles. As a result, their units took unsupportable casualties and were finally forced to retreat in total disorder in July 1944, leaving behind many dead from hunger and disease as well as their injured. Of the 150,000 Japanese soldiers who invaded India in March 1944, almost all of them were dead by July 1944 as Slim had inflicted the largest defeats that the Japanese had suffered up to this point in the war. The Indian Army remained loyal, and under its British officers fought much better than the Indian National Army. After Imphal and Kohima, the American historian Gerhard Weinberg noted for the Japanese their &quot;... only hope in the area was propaganda by Bose, not much of a substitute for their lost Japanese 15th Army.&quot;

Unlike the Japanese, who killed their wounded, Slim went out of his way to ensure good medical care for his wounded and to evacuate his wounded by air to hospitals in India. Slim knew his men would fight better if they knew that they would receive the best possible medical care under the conditions if they were wounded. On 8 August 1944, Slim was promoted to lieutenant general, and, on 28 September 1944, he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB). In December 1944, during a ceremony at Imphal in front of the Scottish, Gurkha and Punjabi regiments, Slim and three of his corps commanders (Christison, Scoones and Stopford) were knighted by the viceroy Lord Wavell and invested with honours. Slim was presented with his insignia as KCB, and the others with their KBEs. Slim was also mentioned in despatches. By the end of 1944, the majority of the men serving in the British Fourteenth Army were in fact not British as of the 12 divisions that made up the British Fourteenth Army, 2 were British, 7 were Indian and 3 came from Britain&#x27;s African colonies. In addition, there were six Chinese divisions, two regiments from the U.S. Army and various tribal militias made up of Shan, Chin, Naga, Kachin and Karen peoples raised by the OSS and the SOE fighting on the Allied side in Burma, requiring Slim to play the role of the diplomat as much as a general to hold these disparate forces made up of so many different peoples together.

In 1945, Slim launched an offensive into Burma, with supply lines stretching almost to the breaking point across hundreds of miles of trackless jungle. Slim employed Billy Williams and his corps of elephants, led by Bandoola, to build bridges and rescue refugees. He faced the same problems that the Japanese had faced in their failed 1944 offensive in the opposite direction. He made the supply of his armies the central issue in the plan of the campaign. The Chindwin River was spanned with the longest Bailey bridge in the world at the time. To distract the Japanese from his campaign in central and southern Burma, Slim ordered the Chinese in northern Burma to begin an offensive, which for a time led the Japanese to the erroneous conclusion that the main goal of the Allies was to open the Burma Road to China. Slim began his advance by sending two corps towards Mandalay and another corps along the coast towards Rangoon, but changed his plans when he learned from intelligence that the Japanese were planning on defending Mandalay from the eastern banks of the Irrawaddy River. Slim had one corps cross the Irrawaddy south of Mandalay at Meiktila while another corps staged a feint attack on Mandalay from the north to distract the Japanese from the main blow coming up from the south. The swift flowing Irrawaddy is a wider river than the Rhine, making it into a natural defensive barrier that the Japanese believed could halt the British advance. However, much of the countryside around the Irrawaddy consists of plains that favoured the offensive, and in his operations in the Irrawaddy river valley, Slim used combined arms offensives with artillery and tanks working closely with the infantry to bring down overwhelming firepower when the Japanese tried to block the British Fourteenth Army&#x27;s advance. In March 1945, after crossing the Irrawaddy, the town of Meiktila was taken, followed by Burma&#x27;s second city, Mandalay.

The Japanese garrison in Mandalay chose not to surrender, using the forts built by the British and the maze of pagodas in downtown Mandalay to fight to the death in an urban battle that destroyed much of the city, which finally fell to the British Fourteenth Army on 20 March 1945. Slim&#x27;s plan was a masterpiece of operational art, and the capture of Meiktila left most of Japan&#x27;s troops stranded in Burma without supplies. The Allies had reached the open plains of central Burma, sallying out and breaking Japanese attacking forces in isolation, maintaining the initiative at all times, backed up by air-land cooperation, including resupply by air and close air support, performed by both RAF and USAAF units. Slim followed up this victory by ordering his coastal corps to seize the mouth of the Irrawaddy where it flowed into the Bay of Bengal.

In combination with these attacks, Force 136 helped initiate a countrywide uprising of the Bamar people against the Japanese. In addition to fighting the allied advance south, the Japanese were faced with heavy attacks from behind their own lines. As he advanced into Burma, Slim discovered gruesome evidence of the nature of Japanese rule in Burma, finding in village after village, Burmese peasants who had been tied to trees and bayoneted to death as the Japanese preferred bayonet practice with people rather than sandbags as normally is the case. Toward the end of the campaign, the army raced south to capture Rangoon before the start of the monsoon. It was considered necessary to capture the port because of the length of the supply lines overland from India and the impossibility of supply by air or land during the monsoon. Rangoon was eventually taken by a combined attack from the land (Slim&#x27;s army), the air (parachute operations south of the city) and a seaborne invasion. Also assisting in the capture of Rangoon was the Anti-Fascist People&#x27;s Freedom League led by Thakin Soe, with Aung San (the future Prime Minister of Burma and father of Aung San Suu Kyi) as one of its military commanders.

As the Burma campaign came to an end, Slim was informed in May by Oliver Leese, the commander of Allied Land Forces South-East Asia (ALFSEA) that he would not be commanding Fourteenth Army in the forthcoming invasion planned for Malaya but would take command of the new Twelfth Army being formed to mop up in Burma. Slim refused the appointment, saying he would prefer to retire. As the news spread, Fourteenth Army fell into turmoil and Alan Brooke, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, furious at not having been consulted by Leese, and Claude Auchinleck, the C-in-C India who was at the time in London, brought pressure to bear. The Supreme Allied Commander of the Southeast Asia Theatre, Louis Mountbatten was obliged to order Leese to undo the damage. On 1 July 1945, Slim was promoted to general and was informed that he was to succeed Leese as C-in-C ALFSEA. However, by the time he took up the post, having taken some leave, the war was at an end.

====Relations with troops====

Slim had an excellent relationship with his troops – the &quot;Forgotten Army&quot;, as they called themselves. Slim had a close rapport with the officers and soldiers under his command, and always trusted his officers to make the correct decisions without referring to him. As Slim later wrote: &quot;I was, like other generals before me, to be saved ... by the resourcefulness and the stubborn valour of my troops.&quot; Murray and Millet wrote that Slim&#x27;s willingness to delegate authority down to his officers on the spot played a key role in sustaining his advance into Burma as officers did not have to wait for a decision from him.

In the aftermath of Kohima and Imphal, Slim inspected the battlefields, seeing the bodies of wounded Japanese soldiers who had been killed by their comrades as under the code of &quot;Bushido&quot;, which graphically showed to Slim how far the Japanese were willing to take &quot;Bushido&quot;. Slim realized that Japanese logistics had broken down, but that Japanese soldiers were still prepared to fight to the death. That led him to the conclusion that it was better to outflank and bypass the Japanese positions as much as possible, leaving the Japanese to starve to death rather than engaging them in combat. The Japanese Burma Area Army had about 100,000 men while the British Fourteenth Army had only about 21,000 men. But Slim believed that with superior mobility backed by proper supply line, he could defeat the Japanese, whose logistics were poor. The superior Japanese numbers together with the fact that the Indian Army was an all-volunteer force, with only so many Indians willing to volunteer and the fact that sending fresh British troops to Burma was not a priority in London, made it imperative for Slim to save the lives of his men as much as possible. Slim was painfully aware that it would be difficult to replace whatever losses his men took, and had no intention of having his army being ground down by fighting the Japanese in every single place that they were. Slim was determined to save the lives of his men as much as possible, while Japanese officers, motivated by &quot;Bushido&quot;, were ready to have all of their men die for the Emperor. Slim estimated that for every man killed under his command, the Japanese lost a hundred men.

Slim noted 70% malaria rates among his troops, largely because they refused to take foul-tasting mepacrine. Slim did not blame his medics for this problem, but placed the responsibility on his officers. He wrote: &quot;Good doctors are no use without good discipline. More than half the battle against disease is fought not by the doctors, but by the regimental officers.&quot; After Slim dismissed some officers for high unit malaria rates, the others realised he was serious and malaria treatment was enforced, dropping the rate to less than five per cent. The combat effectiveness of his army was thus greatly enhanced. This physical and mental turnaround in the army under him was a contributing factor to the eventual defeat of the Japanese in Burma.

Novelist George MacDonald Fraser, then a nineteen-year-old lance corporal, recalled:

==Post-war career==
===Initial retirement from the army===
At the end of 1945 Slim returned to the UK. On 1 January 1946, he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE). and took the post of Commandant of the Imperial Defence College for its first course since 1939. On 7 February 1947 he was made an Aide-de-camp (ADC) to the King. At the end of his two-year appointment at the Imperial Defence College Slim retired as ADC and from the army on 11 May 1948. He had been approached by both India and Pakistan to become C-in-C of their respective armies post independence but refused and instead became Deputy Chairman of the Railway Executive.

===Return to the army===
However, in November 1948 the British Prime Minister Clement Attlee rejected the proposal by Viscount Montgomery that he should be succeeded as Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS) by John Crocker and instead brought back Slim from retirement in the rank of field marshal in January 1949 with formal appointment to the Army Council from 1 January 1949. Slim thus became the first Indian Army officer to become CIGS.

On 2 January 1950, he was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath (GCB) and later that year was made a Chief Commander of the Legion of Merit by the United States having previously, in 1948, been awarded the lower ranking Commander of the Legion of Merit. On 1 November 1952, he relinquished the position of Chief of the Imperial General Staff.

===Governor-General of Australia===
On 10 December 1952 Slim was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) on his appointment as Governor-General of Australia which post he took up on 8 May 1953. On 2 January 1953, he was appointed a Knight of the Order of St. John (KStJ). Slim was a popular choice for Governor-General since he was an authentic war hero who had fought alongside Australians at Gallipoli and in the Middle East. In 1954 he was able to welcome Queen Elizabeth II on the first visit by a reigning monarch to Australia. For his services to the Queen during the tour, he was appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) on 27 April 1954. Liberal leader Robert Menzies held office throughout Slim&#x27;s time in Australia. His Official Secretary throughout his term was Murray Tyrrell.

===Retirement===
In 1959, Slim retired and returned to Britain, where he published his memoirs, &quot;Unofficial History&quot;. He had already published his personal narrative of the Burma Campaign, &quot;Defeat into Victory&quot;, in 1956, which has never been out of print, and in which he candidly talked about his mistakes and the lessons he learned. On 24 April 1959, he was appointed a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG). On 15 July 1960, he was created &quot;Viscount Slim of Yarralumla in the Capital Territory of Australia and of Bishopston in the City and County of Bristol&quot;.

After a successful further career on the boards of major UK companies, he was appointed Constable and Governor of Windsor Castle on 18 June 1964. He died in London on 14 December 1970, aged 79 and was given a full military funeral at St. George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor and was afterwards cremated.

==Allegations==
During his tenure as Governor-General of Australia, Slim was patron of the Fairbridge Farm school child migration to Australia. It was 47 years later and 37 years after Slim&#x27;s death that three former child migrants alleged that Slim assaulted them during visits to Fairbridge Farm. The allegations were dismissed at the time both by those who had served under Slim in the army and by his son. The allegations were aired again on ABC television in the programme &quot;The Long Journey Home&quot;, broadcast on 17 November 2009. On 27 February 2017, the ABC again aired allegations against Slim and Fairbridge Farm.
In 2019 a major road was renamed due to the allegations.

==Eponyms==
* William Slim Drive, in the Canberra district of Belconnen, was named after him. Despite an independent review commissioned by the Australian Capital Territory Government, which returned no recommendation to change the road name, in 2019, the then ACT Planning Minister Mick Gentleman, announced that, after considering allegations made, submissions to the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse and submissions by the Slim family, he would change the road&#x27;s name and in 2021 the name was changed.
* The Slim Officers&#x27; Mess at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst is named after him and was opened in August 2004 by his son.
* On 7 September 2008, a plaque in Slim&#x27;s memory, and those who served with him, was unveiled at the Cenotaph in his native Bristol. Fr Robert King of the Diocese of Clifton was joined by faith leaders from the Hindu, Muslim and Sikh communities at the ceremony, which was led by the Lord Mayor of Bristol&#x27;s chaplain, the Rev. Prebendary Harold Clarke.
* The road Viscount Slim Avenue, in Whyalla, South Australia is named after him.
* The Slim Building at the Cranfield University Shrivenham Campus is named after him.
* The Slim School was a British Families Education Service co-educational secondary school located in the Cameron Highlands, Malaya, and was named after him.

==Historical assessment==

Lieutenant General Sir John Kiszely has recommended Slim&#x27;s memoirs (&quot;Defeat into Victory&quot;) (1956) in which Slim candidly talked about his own mistakes in the Burma campaign. The book has never been out of print. Kiszely has described Slim as &quot;perhaps the Greatest Commander of the 20th Century&quot; and has commenting on Slim&#x27;s &quot;self-deprecating style&quot; Military historian Max Hastings stated:

In contrast to almost every other outstanding commander of the war, Slim was a disarmingly normal human being, possessed of notable self-knowledge. He was without pretension, devoted to his wife, Aileen, their family and the Indian Army. His calm, robust style of leadership and concern for the interests of his men won the admiration of all who served under him ... His blunt honesty, lack of bombast and unwillingness to play courtier did him few favours in the corridors of power. Only his soldiers never wavered in their devotion.

The spirit of comradeship Slim created within Fourteenth Army lived on after the war in the Burma Star Association, of which Slim was a co-founder and first President.

A statue of Slim on Whitehall, outside the Ministry of Defence, was unveiled by Queen Elizabeth II in 1990. Designed by Ivor Roberts-Jones, the statue is one of three British Second World War military leaders (the others being Alan Brooke and Bernard Montgomery).

Slim&#x27;s papers were collected by his biographer, Ronald Lewin, and given to the Churchill Archives Centre by Slim&#x27;s wife, Aileen, Viscountess Slim, and son, John Slim, 2nd Viscount Slim, and other donors, 1977–2001. Lewin&#x27;s biography, &quot;Slim: The Standardbearer&quot;, was awarded the 1977 WH Smith Literary Award.

<text>The New York Renaissance, also known as the Renaissance Big R Five and as the Rens, were the first black-owned, all-black, fully-professional basketball team in history, established in October 1923, by Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Douglas. They were named after the Renaissance Casino and Ballroom through an agreement with its owner, in return for the use of that facility as their home court. The Casino and Ballroom at 138th Street and Seventh Avenue in Harlem was an entertainment complex that included a ballroom, which served as the Rens&#x27; home court. The team eventually had its own house orchestra and games were often followed by a dance. Their subsequent financial success shifted the focus of black basketball from amateurism to professionalism. Initially, the Rens played mostly in Harlem, but Douglas soon realized they could book more games on the road, in larger-capacity venues, and took up barnstorming across the country for more lucrative payouts. The Renaissance are also the topic of the 2011 documentary &quot;On the Shoulders of Giants&quot;.

==Early years==
The Rens were one of the dominant basketball teams of the 1920s and 1930s. They were originally known as the Spartan Braves, the basketball team of the Spartan Field Club, a Manhattan-based multi-sport amateur athletic organization whose initial focus was cricket. The Rens played their first game on November 3, 1923, winning against the Collegiate Five, an all-white team. Interracial games featured regularly on their schedule, drawing the largest crowds. In its first years, the team strove to beat the Original Celtics, the dominant white team of the time, and claim the title of world champions. In their fifth encounter, the Rens did so for the first time, on December 20, 1925. During the 1932–33 regular season, the Rens compiled a record of 120–8 (six of those losses came at the hands of the Celtics, whom the Rens did beat eight times). During that season, the Rens won 88 consecutive games, a mark that has never been matched by a professional basketball team. In 1939, the Rens won the first professional basketball championship, when they beat the Oshkosh All-Stars, a white team, 34–25, in the World Professional Basketball Tournament in Chicago.

The team compiled a 2,588–529 record from 1923 to 1948. Important players on the Rens roster included Clarence &quot;Fats&quot; Jenkins, Pappy Ricks, Eyre Saitch, Bill Yancey, &quot;Wee&quot; Willie Smith, Charles &quot;Tarzan&quot; Cooper, Zack Clayton, John Isaacs, Dolly King, Pop Gates, and Nat Clifton. In 1936, the Renaissance became the first top-level team to sign a four-year African American college star, David &quot;Big Dave&quot; DeJernett of Indiana Central.

==1949: Move to Dayton==

The Rens relocated during the 1948–49 basketball season to Dayton, Ohio, to replace the Detroit Vagabond Kings, who folded in December 1948. The Vagabond Kings had been playing in the racially integrated National Basketball League (NBL). The Rens played the remainder of the NBL season as the Dayton Rens, then disbanded after the NBL merged with the all-white Basketball Association of America to form the, also initially, all-white National Basketball Association which resumed play in the 1949–50 season.

* The Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inducted the 1932–33 New York Renaissance team collectively in 1963 in recognition of their 88-game winning streak that season, the longest in professional basketball history. Seven former Rens players are individually enshrined: Tarzan Cooper, Pop Gates, Nat Clifton, John Isaacs, Zack Clayton, Fats Jenkins, and Sonny Boswell. Renaissance Big Five founder/owner Bob Douglas is also enshrined as a contributor.
* On May 9, 2017, the Historic Preservation and Transportation Committee of Community Board 10 unanimously (6-0-0) passed a resolution formally requesting that the New York City Council and the Mayor of New York City enact legislation to support the co-naming at the southeast corner of West 138th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard to New York Rens Court.

==Stage play==
Writer and director Layon Gray off-Broadway production Kings Of Harlem pays homage to the Rens. The play centers around the 1939 season in which the Harlem Rens won the first World Basketball Championship. The play won Best Play, Best Supporting Actor, Best Director and Best Production at the 2018 42nd annual Carbonell Awards in Miami. The play will have a regional run at Delaware Theater Company in October 2023 to commemorate the 100 year anniversary of the team.

<text>The TK (TK-3) and TKS were Polish tankettes developed during the 1930s and used in the Second World War.

==Design and development==
The TK (also known as the TK-3) tankette was a Polish design produced from 1931 based on the chassis of the British Carden Loyd tankette, with an improved hull and more powerful engine, and armour up to thick ( on the TKS). In 1939, up-arming of the tankettes with nkm wz. 38 FK autocannons began, but only 24 of these were completed before the outbreak of World War II.

On 6 November 1934 Estonia purchased 6 vehicles from Poland, with the contract deal worth over 180,000 krones. The deal also included one additional tracked-lorry, and a motorcycle was given free as a bonus. After the Soviet Union occupied Estonia, these vehicles were put into service with the Red Army.

==Combat history==

575 TK/TKS tankettes formed the bulk of the Polish armoured forces before the outbreak of war. They suffered heavy losses during the invasion of Poland, often being the only armoured fighting vehicles available. Their small size suited them for reconnaissance and infantry support, but with their light armament of a single machine gun they stood no chance in combat against German tanks, except against the Panzer I. 

The handful of tankettes armed with 20 mm guns were more effective against enemy tanks; in one instance on 18 September 1939 a 20 mm gunned TKS commanded by &quot;Podchorąży&quot; (officer cadet) Roman Orlik destroyed two German Panzer 35(t) tanks and a Panzer IV &quot;ausf B&quot; tank which was commanded by Victor IV Albrecht von Ratibor.

After the conquest of Poland, captured tankettes were used by the German army in various support roles, mostly for training, security duties or as artillery tractors. Many captured tankettes were also used by the Luftwaffe for airfield security and snowplowing. Some were later sold to the puppet state of Croatia. In spring 1941, the National Police received 18 TK-3 tankettes, some with the 20mm gun, while in summer 1941 the Army received 18 TKS, 4 of them being sent to the Ustashe Militia.

A smaller Polish force retreated to (then neutral) Hungary from the German and Soviet troops occupying Poland. This mixed formation had 30 tracked vehicles, of which 15-20 were TKS (contemporary sources did not officially distinguish between TK-3 and TKS). These vehicles were used for training in tank driving and machine gun handling drills. By the end of the war, they were worn out due to the lack of spare parts, so there is no trace of them after early 1944. The crew was able to travel to England with the help of the Hungarian government during 1940.

==Variants==

*TKS with nkm wz. 38 FK - about 24 TKS fitted with 20 mm autocannon in 1939.
*C2P - unarmoured light artillery tractor, about 200 built.

==Surviving TK-series tankettes==
There are only two fully operational TKS tankettes and one TK-3 surviving. All of them were reconstructed from wrecks in the first decade of 21st century, using non-original parts.
* 1 x TKS - One of the TKS tankettes was donated to Poland by the Swedish Axvall Tank Museum and since 2008 it is on exhibition in the Museum of the Polish Army. The Swedish TKS survived the post-war period in Norway, where it was operated by a local farmer as a tractor.
* 1 x TKS - Private collection.
* 1 x TK-3 - Private collection.
The other survivors are not in working order.
* 1 x TKS - On exhibition in the Kubinka Tank Museum in Russia.

<doc id="353422" wikidata="Q2593294" url="?curid=353422" title="Woolwich Dockyard">
<text>Woolwich Dockyard (formally H.M. Dockyard, Woolwich, also known as The King&#x27;s Yard, Woolwich) was an English naval dockyard along the river Thames at Woolwich - originally in north-west Kent, now in southeast London - where many ships were built from the early 16th century until the late 19th century. William Camden called it &#x27;the Mother Dock of all England&#x27;. By virtue of the size and quantity of vessels built there, Woolwich Dockyard is described as having been &#x27;among the most important shipyards of seventeenth-century Europe&#x27;. During the Age of Sail, the yard continued to be used for shipbuilding and repair work more or less consistently; in the 1830s a specialist factory within the dockyard oversaw the introduction of steam power for ships of the Royal Navy. At its largest extent it filled a 56-acre site north of Woolwich Church Street, between Warspite Road and New Ferry Approach; 19th-century naval vessels were fast outgrowing the yard, however, and it eventually closed in 1869 (though a large part of the site remained in military hands for a further century). The former dockyard area is now partly residential, partly industrial, with remnants of its historic past having been restored.

==History==

===Origins===

Woolwich Dockyard was founded by King Henry VIII in 1512 to build his flagship &quot;Henri Grâce à Dieu&quot; (&quot;Great Harry&quot;), the largest ship of its day. The ship was built in Old Woolwich, which is where the dockyard was initially established: past Bell Water Gate, east of the area later known as Woolwich Dockyard. The site consisted of one or more rudimentary dry docks, a long storehouse (for canvas, rigging and other materials) and a small assortment of other buildings. Like its counterpart Deptford Dockyard, Woolwich was probably chosen for its position – on the south bank of the tidal River Thames conveniently close to Henry&#x27;s palace at Greenwich – and for its proximity to deep water. Several other ships were built here after &quot;Great Harry&quot;, but in the 1520s shipbuilding appears to have ceased (the site may have been prone to flooding, a problem that caused the closure of another Royal Dockyard further downstream in Erith at around this time). By 1540, however, the royal shipwrights had begun operating on higher ground further to the west at what was to become the permanent site of the Dockyard, where a pair of dry docks (already &quot;in situ&quot; and known as &quot;Boughton&#x27;s Docks&quot;) formed the centre of operations. The site was purchased by the Crown in 1546 and in the second half of the century several sizeable ships were built there. The yard was also used for heavy repair work.

===Early history===

The two dry docks were rebuilt in the early 17th century (the first of several rebuildings) and the western dock was expanded, enabling it to accommodate two ships, end to end. In the years that followed, the dockyard was expanded; its facilities included slipways for shipbuilding, timber yards, saw pits, cranes, forges, a mast house and several storehouses. There were also houses on site for the senior officers of the yard. A clock house was built in 1670 (containing a mould loft for drawing up full-scale ship designs) and in 1698 a palatial Great Storehouse was erected. Apart from the brick-built mast house and Great Storehouse, the buildings were almost entirely of timber construction.

====The Gun Wharf====

As at other Royal Dockyards, the Ordnance Office maintained a Gun Wharf at Woolwich for storage and provision of guns and ammunition for the ships based there. The Gun Wharf was sited east of Bell Water Gate (where there is now a car park next to the Waterfront Leisure Centre). It was here that Woolwich Dockyard had been founded in 1512 and the Great Harry was built in 1515; when the dockyard had moved to its new, permanent site in the 1540s, the old wharf, crane and storehouse had been given over to storage of heavy ordnance and other items. Gun carriage repair was also undertaken on site. Later, use of the Gun Wharf was shared with the nearby Royal Ropeyard, which maintained a storehouse there for hemp and other materials. The wharf and its buildings were improved and rebuilt at regular points through the 16th and 17th centuries; as late as 1664 a large new brick storehouse was provided &quot;to lodge ships&#x27; carriages in&quot;.

The wharf was still subject to frequent flooding, however, and from the 1650s the Board of Ordnance began to make use of open land at Tower Place, to the east of the Gun Wharf, as a site for proving and storing cannons and other large guns. Known as &#x27;The Warren&#x27;, this was the beginning of what would later become the Woolwich Royal Arsenal. The Ordnance Office withdrew from Gun Wharf in 1671, but the Ropeyard continued to make use of the wharf and its associated storehouses into the 19th century.

====The Ropeyard====

In the 1570s the Crown established a naval Ropeyard in Woolwich, one of the largest in the world at the time. Too long to fit within the confines of the Dockyard, its parallel sheds lay along the line of present-day Beresford Street. As first built it consisted of a 600 ft &#x27;cable house&#x27; along with a series of sheds accommodating different parts of the rope-making process. In 1695–1697 the ropeyard was largely rebuilt, under the supervision of Edmund Dummer; by the end of the century it included a double-ropewalk, 1061 ft long, a parallel single-ropewalk of similar length, a brick storehouse with a clock tower, houses for the yard&#x27;s senior officers and various other buildings, all enclosed within a perimeter wall topped by watchtowers. Parts of the yard had to be rebuilt after a fire in 1759, and again after another fire in 1813. The ropeyard remained in service until 1832, by which time similar establishments in other Royal Dockyards had begun to come to the fore; the site having been sold in 1833, its buildings were demolished soon afterwards, in 1835.

===Second golden age===

The fortunes of the yard had waned toward the end of the seventeenth century; in 1688 its work was valued at £9,669, in contrast to nearby Deptford (£15,760), not to mention the (by now much larger) Royal Dockyards at Portsmouth (£35,045), and Chatham (£44,940). In the first half of the eighteenth century, however, it gained a renewed momentum: the site doubled in size, as did the workforce, and even in the first decade of the 1700s there were more ships launched from Woolwich than from any other English yard. Many buildings were built (or rebuilt) at this time, now mostly in brick. On newly acquired and reclaimed land to the east, three new slips were built and a new mast pond was created, along with adjacent mast houses and boat sheds; a sizeable rigging house was also built here. Alongside the Great Storehouse an equally large building, housing both a sail loft and a mould loft, was constructed in 1740. Meanwhile, land acquired to the west enabled a new terrace of officers&#x27; houses to be built in the early 1750s.
The yard was further expanded westwards in the 1780s, again almost doubling in size. Much of the area of the expanded dockyard was preserved as open ground for storage of timber, with rows of wooden seasoning sheds; as the Navy&#x27;s ships were growing in size and number, more raw materials were needed across the Royal Dockyards. Two new mast ponds were constructed, replacing a pond at the eastern end of the site which dated from 1720 but was now considered too small (the new ponds and mast houses could accommodate mast lengths of up to ); the old pond, together with its associated buildings, was now given over to the construction and storage of ship&#x27;s boats. Centrally positioned in the expanded yard, a new clock house was built, containing offices for the various departments of the dockyard, and with it a new main gateway (replacing the old entrance which had been located further to the east).
Later, Shipbuilding continued in earnest during the Napoleonic Wars; but, as ships grew still bigger, the Thames continued to silt up. In 1800 Samuel Bentham, the Inspector-General of Naval Works (who had himself served as an apprentice shipwright at Woolwich in the 1770s) proposed replacing Woolwich, Deptford, Chatham and Sheerness dockyards with a single new facility on the Isle of Grain; but this, (along with other radical proposals) was not pursued. In 1802 a steam-driven bucket dredger was brought into service at Woolwich (prior to this, convicts had been used to dredge the quayside by hand) but still the silting persisted; nevertheless, the yard continued to be developed: in 1814 a large smithery or metal-working factory was added to produce anchors and other iron items. In the 1820s two new covered slips were added (No.1 and No.2 Slips) large enough to accommodate the latest ship designs. The following decade a substantial part of the river wall was rebuilt in brick and the two dry docks were reconstructed in granite in the 1830s–40s. Alongside the docks a steam-powered saw-mill was provided, a new workshop with steam hammers and a hydraulic chain and cable testing facility.

===The Steam Factory and last years of the Dockyard===

From 1831, Woolwich found a new lease of life as a specialist yard for marine steam engineering (a relatively new technology which was being developed commercially at nearby Millwall). New buildings were constructed on the site for steam manufacturing and maintenance, including a boiler shop for manufacturing boilers, foundries for brass, copper and iron work, and an erecting shop for assembling the steam engines; by 1843 all were integrated into a single factory complex, with a single large chimney drawing on all the various forges and furnaces by way of underground flues. Integral to the creation of the steam factory was the conversion of two mast ponds (which lay to the north of what is now Ruston Road) into steam basins, where ships could moor alongside the factory while their engines and boilers were fitted. One of these basins was provided with its own dry dock (No. 1 Dock) which, like the basins, was filled in and built over in the 20th century. The factory was part of the dockyard, but had a high degree of independence: it was accessed by its own gate (known as the West Gate or Steam Factory Gate) and overseen by its own official, the Chief Engineer.
Woolwich retained its primacy as the Navy&#x27;s steam engineering yard through the 1840s, but following the establishment of large-scale steam yards at Portsmouth (1848) and Devonport (1853) it became increasingly redundant, especially as its basins were no longer large enough for the size of ships now being built. Older ships still came to Woolwich for engine repairs and maintenance, but by the end of the Crimean War the steam factory&#x27;s days were numbered. Surprisingly though, the dockyard had managed to remain active in shipbuilding and its facilities continued to be upgraded and expanded through the 1850s and early 1860s; during that time a new rolling mill and an armour plate shop were built as well as a sizeable new sail loft and rigging store. Ultimately, though, the yard could not keep pace with the emerging needs of the new ironclad warships, and by 1865 it was clear that both Woolwich and Deptford Dockyards were destined for closure.

===Administration of the dockyard===

From 1630 until 1688 the Master Shipwright was the key official at the dockyard until the introduction of resident commissioners by the Navy Board after which he became deputy to the resident commissioner. The Commissioner of the Navy at Woolwich Dockyard held a seat and a vote on the Navy Board in London. In 1748 the dockyard was managed directly by the Navy Board. In 1832 the post of commissioner was replaced by the post of captain-superintendent, who was invested with the same power and authority as the former commissioners, &quot;except in matters requiring an Act of Parliament to be submitted by the Commissioner of the Navy&quot;.

===Closure and aftermath===

Woolwich Dockyard finally closed in 1869; however, although the easternmost part of the site was sold, everything west of No. 5 Slip (i.e. over 90% of the area) was retained by the War Office (which continued to refer to it as &#x27;Woolwich Dockyard&#x27; and &#x27;Royal Dockyard, Woolwich&#x27; until relinquishing ownership of the site a century later).

The eastern area today known as Mast Quay was sold by auction in 1872. Royal Dockard Wharf was used by a timber and slate merchant, E. Arnold &amp; Co, in the 1870s. By 1919, the site was occupied by W.R. Cunis Ltd, owners of dredgers, tugs and barges, which used the wharves and slips for repairing their vessels. Cunis later (1971) formed Cubow Ltd, a joint venture with Hay&#x27;s Wharf Ltd, to build boats, including substantial sailing vessels of up to 1,000 tons, a 1973 fishing trawler later chartered by the Ministry of Defence for use as a minesweeper (HMS &quot;David&quot;), a cargo vessel (&quot;Ambience&quot;), the &quot;Naticia&quot; (a London leisure cruise boat) and the &quot;Beagle&quot;, still in use around the Galápagos Islands in 2023. The area was last used for boat repair work in the 1990s.

====War Office use of the site====
After closure, much of the retained land went on to be used as storage space for the Ordnance Stores Department, based at the nearby Royal Arsenal; general items (including barrack stores, accoutrements and harness) were moved to the Dockyard, while &#x27;warlike stores&#x27; remained in the Arsenal. Warehouses were built across much of the site and existing buildings were converted to provide storage space; there were also workshops on site for manufacturing harnesses, saddlery and the like. A railway system served the complex, part narrow-gauge, part standard-gauge, the latter linked (by way of a tunnel under Woolwich Church Street) to the North Kent Line (which was in turn linked into the Royal Arsenal Railway). The tunnel remains &quot;in situ&quot; for use by pedestrians. The dockyard church was used as a garrison chapel by the infantry quartered nearby in Cambridge Barracks.

From 1878 part of the Dockyard was given over for the Commissariat Reserve Stores; over the next decade it became the main supply depot providing food and forage for overseas garrisons and expeditionary forces. During the Sudan Campaign a very large forage store was built on the site, with hydraulic equipment for compressing and bailing hay. Briefly, from September 1888, the Commissariat and Transport Corps had its Regimental Headquarters in the Dockyard, but the following year the corps became the Army Service Corps with its headquarters in Aldershot.

In 1889 an Inspectorate of Royal Engineer Stores (IRES) was established at Woolwich Dockyard (an early example of independent quality assurance), which had &#x27;custody of a complete set of sealed patterns for all items of Royal Engineer equipment&#x27; and responsibility for &#x27;the preparation of detailed specifications to govern manufacture&#x27;. It remained based in the Dockyard, and was later renamed the Inspectorate of Engineers and Signal Stores (IESS) in 1936, and the Inspectorate of Electrical and Mechanical Equipment (IEME) in 1941. The Chief Inspector of General Stores (later styled Chief Inspector of Equipment and Stores) was also based there from the 1890s, as was the Superintending Engineer and Constructor of Shipping (who supervised, across various different shipyards, the construction of vessels for the War Department Fleet).
During the First World War the dockyard remained operational as an Army Ordnance Depot and ASC Supply Reserve Depot. It also accommodated the country&#x27;s largest Army Pay Office, the headquarters of the War Office Inspection Department, and the Records Offices of the Army Service Corps and the Army Ordnance Corps.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, stores and facilities were removed from Woolwich Dockyard in an attempt to protect them from aerial bombardment. Later on, military activity resumed in the Dockyard: from 1942 it served as a Central Repair Depot of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, and at the same time the Royal Army Service Corps established its main Boat Stores Depot there. In time, the repair function of these corps was taken over by the Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers.

====Gradual military withdrawal====
In 1926 the western part of the site was sold to the Royal Arsenal Co-operative Society; the Co-Op still occupies a number of buildings on the site. The older, eastern portion of the site remained in Ministry of Defence hands, used for storage, workshops and offices, until the closure of the Royal Arsenal in the 1960s. (The Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers, one of the last military units on site, moved out in 1966, taking with them the muster-bell and mast that had stood inside the main gate; it was re-erected at their depot at Arborfield, where it was rung for church services; in 2016 it was scheduled to move with the corps to their new headquarters at MoD Lyneham.)

====Redevelopment====
Thereafter the older part of the dockyard was turned into a housing estate by Greenwich London Borough Council in the early 1970s. In the 1980s and 1990s the Thames Path was extended to the area (along the riverside between Warspite Road and the Woolwich Ferry carpark; it is also part of the NCN1 and C14 cycle routes). Various housing projects have encroached on the historic character of the area. Two towers with luxury apartments were built at Mast Quay around 2005, with even taller towers being projected in 2015.

The second phase of Mast Quay, east of phase 1 (and adjacent to the Woolwich Ferry carpark), was completed in late 2022 and comprised towers of 23, 11, nine and six storeys, but differed markedly from what had originally been proposed. The developer, Comer Homes Group, proposed revisions to the design in December 2022 when construction was nearly finished. However, the build-to-rent development had &quot;26 main deviations to the original planning permission&quot; granted in 2012, and in September 2023, Greenwich Council ordered Comer Homes to demolish the blocks. Comer appealed against the enforcement notice. A planning inquiry was opened in July 2024. In January 2025, the Planning Inspectorate upheld 11 out of the council&#x27;s 26 objections. The demolition order was conditionally revoked, with Comer Homes given three years to fix issues at the development and ordered to pay £4.4m towards affordable housing, and £2.3m in community infrastructure levy payments. The firm was ordered to replace &quot;visually intrusive&quot; orange cladding, provide promised accessibility features, undertake fire safety work and make public realm improvements at the base of the buildings. Comer Homes accepted the original scheme had not been lawfully implemented and that the existing buildings did not have planning permission; revised planning permission was issued. The demolition order was upheld as an &#x27;ultimate sanction&#x27; if the conditions are not met.

== Heritage ==

On Woolwich Church Street, a late 18th-century guard house and police office with neoclassical features stand alongside the former dockyard gates. Nearby, the former dockyard administration building now serves as the Clockhouse Community Centre; it dates from 1778 to 1784. Closer to the river, a couple of closed off docks have been preserved (and partly rebuilt) as a reminder of the area&#x27;s marine significance. Two shipbuilding slips have also survived, either side of the first Mast Quay apartment blocks, and a pair of antique guns have been mounted on the quayside where a Royal Marines gun battery formerly stood.
Surviving industrial buildings include parts of the old factory wall along Woolwich Church Street and remnants of the Steam Factory with its prominent chimney nearby. The original factory building of 1838 still stands on the south side of Ruston Road, although only at around two-thirds of its original length of . When built, it housed a complex of boiler shops, a foundry, fitting shops and erecting shops for the manufacture and assembly of marine steam engines. Additions were made over the next ten years, culminating in the smithery which stands parallel with the original block, to the south; dating from 1847, this originally contained 48 hearths and 5 Nasmyth steam hammers. Coppersmiths and brass founders were accommodated in a smaller block just to the west (which is still to be seen, immediately north of the old police house at the West Gate). The building which faces the police house across the gateway was built in 1848–49 to serve as the Woolwich Dockyard School for Apprentices: one of a number of such schools set up at the Royal Dockyards under an Admiralty Scheme of 1843, Woolwich specialised in steam engineering, and for a time factory apprentices from all the royal dockyards were educated at the school.

Less than half a mile to the south of the site there is a railway station called Woolwich Dockyard.

===Relocated buildings===

An iron-framed building of 1814 by John Rennie the Elder, removed from Woolwich in the 1970s, was re-erected at Ironbridge where it houses the Blists Hill foundry exhibit; in the dockyard it had housed Rennie&#x27;s anchor forge, which was notable as the first industrial use of steam power in any naval establishment (other than for pumping water).
A number of metal roofs, built over shipbuilding slips at Woolwich in the 1840s and 1850s, were dismantled after the Yard closed and rebuilt at Chatham to house various manufacturing processes:
* The earliest, constructed by Fox, Henderson &amp; Co in 1844–45, remains one of the oldest surviving examples of a wide-span metal frame structure (of a form later destined to become familiar in the construction of train sheds and similar buildings). Originally built over No. 7 Slip (renumbered as No. 6 in the 1850s), the structure was dismantled after the closure of the dockyard and rebuilt at Chatham to serve as a machine shop.
* Another, built over No. 4 Slip in 1846–47, was also by Fox and Henderson but of a much more sophisticated design (as well as being larger and more robust). Moved to Chatham in 1876, it served to house the main boiler shop for the steam factory there. After standing empty for many years it was restored in 2002–03 to serve as the main mall of Chatham&#x27;s Dockside Outlet shopping centre. 
* A third slip cover, manufactured by Henry and Martin Grissell and erected over the new No. 5 Slip in 1856–58, was also moved to Chatham in the 1870s, where it went on to serve as the main Engineering Factory of the expanded dockyard. Unlike the earlier two examples it was subsequently demolished (in around about 1990).
The Dockyard Church, designed by George Gilbert Scott and dating from 1856 to 1858, had formerly stood just inside the main gate to the Dockyard. It had seating for 1,200 worshippers and was designed to accommodate not only the resident officers and workers of the yard but also the Woolwich Division of the Royal Marines. After a period of disuse it was dismantled and rebuilt in 1932 in Eltham (where it remains in use as St Barnabas&#x27;s Church).

<doc id="353424" wikidata="Q2828301" url="?curid=353424" title="Washington–Baltimore combined statistical area">
<text>The Washington–Baltimore combined metropolitan statistical area is a statistical area, including the overlapping metropolitan areas of Washington, D.C. and Baltimore. The region includes Central Maryland, Northern Virginia, three counties in the Eastern Panhandle of West Virginia, and one county in south-central Pennsylvania. It is the most educated, highest-income, and third-most populous combined statistical area in the United States behind New York City–Newark, NJ and Los Angeles–Long Beach.

The area is designated by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as the Washington–Baltimore–Arlington, DC–MD–VA–WV–PA Combined Statistical Area. It is composed primarily of two major metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), the Washington–Arlington–Alexandria, DC–VA–MD–WV MSA and the Baltimore–Columbia–Towson, Maryland Metropolitan Statistical Area. Five smaller urban areas not contiguous to the main urban area but having strong commuting ties with the main area are included in the metropolitan area:Hagerstown–Martinsburg, Maryland–West Virginia MSA, the Chambersburg–Waynesboro, Pennsylvania MSA, the Winchester, VA–WV MSA, the California–Lexington Park, Maryland MSA, and the Easton, Maryland micropolitan statistical area (μSA).

Some counties, such as Caroline and King George County, Virginia, are not officially designated by OMB as members of this metropolitan area but still consider themselves members anyway. This is mostly due to their proximity to the area, the size of their commuter population, and by the influence of local broadcasting stations. The population of the entire Washington–Baltimore Combined Statistical Area as of the 2020 census was 9,973,383. The area&#x27;s most-populous city is Washington, D.C. with a population of 689,545, and the area&#x27;s most populous county is Fairfax County, Virginia, with a population of 1,150,309.

== Components of the combined statistical area ==
The counties and independent cities and their groupings that comprise the area are listed below with their 2012 population estimates. Central counties/cities (designated as such by OMB) for each MSA are shown in italics.

== Regional organizations ==

===Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments===

Founded in 1957, the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) is a regional organization of 23 Washington-area local governments, members of the Maryland and Virginia state legislatures, the U.S. Senate, and the U.S. House of Representatives. MWCOG provides a forum for discussion and the development of regional responses to issues regarding the environment, transportation, public safety, homeland security, affordable housing, community planning, and economic development.

The National Capital Region Transportation Planning Board, a component of MWCOG, is the federally designated Metropolitan Planning Organization for the metropolitan Washington area.

=== Baltimore Metropolitan Council ===
The Baltimore Metropolitan Council is the equivalent organization for the Baltimore portion of the combined Baltimore–Washington metropolitan area. The BMC, which was created in 1992 as the successor to the Regional Planning Council and Baltimore Regional Council of Governments, consists of the Baltimore region&#x27;s elected executives, representing Baltimore City and Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Carroll, Harford and Howard counties.

The Baltimore Regional Transportation Board is the federally recognized Metropolitan Planning Organization for transportation planning in the Baltimore region.

<doc id="353429" wikidata="Q524871" url="?curid=353429" title="Battle of Cyzicus">
<text>The Battle of Cyzicus (Greek: ) took place in May or June 410 BC during the Peloponnesian War. During the battle, an Athenian fleet commanded by Alcibiades, Thrasybulus, and Theramenes routed and destroyed a Spartan fleet commanded by Mindarus. The victory allowed Athens to recover control over a number of cities in the Hellespont over the next year. In the wake of their defeat, the Spartans made a peace offer, which the Athenians rejected.

==Prelude==
Athens had been debilitated after the Sicilian expedition and its hold on the Hellespont had loosened with Persian support now behind Sparta. Cyzicus revolted from Athens in the summer of 411, but was recovered by the Athenian fleet after the Battle of Cynossema. 

In the wake of the Athenian victory at Abydos in November 411 BC, the Spartan admiral Mindarus sent to Sparta for reinforcements and began working with the Persian satrap Pharnabazus to plan for a new offensive. The Athenians, meanwhile, were unable to follow through on their victory, since the depletion of the Athenian treasury precluded any major operations. Thus, by the spring of 410 BC, Mindarus had built a fleet of at least 60 ships, and with the support of Pharnabazus&#x27;s troops, took the city of Cyzicus. The Athenian fleet in the Hellespont withdrew from its base at Sestos to Cardia to avoid the superior Spartan force, and to regroup under Alcibiades, Theramenes and Thrasybulus. The consolidated Athenian fleet, including a force of land troops under Chaereas, set out to the Hellespont to challenge Mindarus.

==Command structure and strength of the opposing forces==
Pharnabazus controlled large Persian land forces in his satrapy, including an important cavalry force. Mindarus commanded the Peloponnesian fleet. Diodoros says that Mindarus had collected triremes from the Peloponnese and elsewhere (there were forces from as far away as Syracuse on Sicily), raising at least 80 ships, but Xenophon (the source writing closer to the time) says he had 60 ships. In any case, the Peloponnesians were not as proficient in naval warfare as their Athenian adversaries.

Alcibiades, as the senior general, was in command of the united Athenian fleet, Theramenes and Thrasybulus acting as his juniors. Alcibiades was supported by the democrats, having been elected by the Athenian fleet on Samos. Theramenes had been appointed by the oligarchic ‘5,000’ in Athens. Donald Kagan disputes Alcibiades&#x27;s supreme command stating that Thrasybulus, as commander of the whole fleet and victor of Cynossema and Abydos, probably had the strategic command at Cyzicus while Alcibiades was only in command of his own squadron. As Cornelius Nepos states: &quot;In the Peloponnesian War Thrasybulus accomplished many victories without Alcibiades; the latter accomplished nothing without the former, yet he, by some gift of nature gained all the credit.&quot; Nevertheless the generals were, at this stage, cooperating closely. The Peloponnesians were unaware of the consolidation of the Athenian fleets and the increase in their number. The Athenian fleet is estimated to have been 86 triremes.

==Battle==
The Athenian force entered the Hellespont, and, passing the Spartan base at Abydos by night so as to conceal their numbers, established a base on the island of Proconnesus (modern-day Marmara), just northwest of Cyzicus. The next day, they disembarked Chaereas&#x27;s force near Cyzicus. The Athenian fleet then divided, with 20 ships under Alcibiades advancing towards Cyzicus while the main Athenian fleet under Thrasybulus and Theramenes lurked behind. Mindarus, seeing an opportunity to attack what appeared to be a vastly inferior force, set out towards them with his entire force. Alcibiades&#x27;s force fled, and Mindarus&#x27;s ships gave chase. When both forces had gotten well out from the harbor, however, Alcibiades turned to face Mindarus, and Thrasybulus and Theramenes appeared with their forces to cut off his retreat. Mindarus, seeing the trap, fled in the one open direction, towards a beach south of the city, where Pharnabazus was located with his troops. The Spartan fleet suffered losses in the flight, and reached the shore with the Athenians right behind them.

Alcibiades&#x27;s troops, leading the Athenian pursuit, landed and attempted to pull the Spartan ships back out to sea with grappling hooks. Pharnabazus sent his Persian soldiers to intervene; numerically superior and on firmer ground, they began to drive the Athenians into the sea. Seeing this, Thrasybulus landed his force as a diversion and ordered Theramenes to combine his troops with those of Chaereas and join the battle. For a time, Thrasybulus and Alcibiades were both driven back by superior forces, but the arrival of Theramenes and Chaereas turned the tide; the Spartans and Persians were defeated, and Mindarus was killed. All the Spartan ships were captured save for those of the Syracusan allies, who burned their ships as they retreated. (Xen. Hell. 1.1.18)

==Aftermath==
In the wake of this dramatic victory, the Athenians had full control of the waters of the Hellespont. The next day, they took Cyzicus, which surrendered without a fight. An intercepted letter from the Spartan troops stranded near Cyzicus reads “The ships are gone. Mindarus is dead. The men are starving. We know not what to do.&quot; Demoralized by the devastation of their fleet, the Spartans sent an embassy to Athens seeking to make peace; the Athenians rejected it.

At Athens, the oligarchic government that had ruled since 411 gave way to a restored democracy within a few months of the battle. An expeditionary force under Thrasyllus was prepared to join the forces in the Hellespont. This force, however, did not depart until over a year after the battle, and although the Athenians eventually recaptured Byzantium and resumed collecting tribute from Chalcedon, they never truly pressed the advantage that Cyzicus had given them. Largely, this was a result of financial inability; even after the victory, the Athenian treasury was hard pressed to support large-scale offensive operations. Meanwhile, the Spartans, with Persian funding, quickly rebuilt their fleet, and would go on to undermine the Athenian advantage. Athens would win only one more naval battle in the war, at Arginusae, and their defeat at Aegospotami in 405 BC would bring the war to a close. Although Cyzicus was a dramatic victory for the Athenians, the Spartans were eventually able to recover their strength and end the war in their favour, with the surrender of Athens and its allies 6 years later.

<text>The Lemuralia or Lemuria was an annual event in the religion of ancient Rome, during which the Romans performed rites to exorcise any malevolent and fearful ghosts of the restless dead from their homes. These unwholesome spectres, the &quot;lemures&quot; or &quot;larvae&quot; were propitiated with chants and offerings of black beans.

== Observance ==
In the Julian calendar the three days of the festival were 9, 11, and 13 May. Lemuria&#x27;s name and origin myth, according to Ovid, derives from a supposed &quot;Remuria&quot; instituted by Romulus to appease the angry spirit of his murdered twin, Remus. The philosopher Porphyry points out that Remus&#x27; death was violent, premature, and a matter of regret for Romulus. Toynbee defines &quot;lemures&quot; as ordinary &quot;di Manes&quot;, made harmful and spiteful to the living because &quot;kinless and neglected&quot; in death and after it, having no rites or memorial, free to leave their dead body but unable to enter the underworld or afterlife. A less common but more &quot;mischievous and dangerous&quot; type of ghost, known as &quot;larvae&quot; was thought to wander about the house with the &quot;lemures&quot;; the name, &quot;larva&quot;, is a rarity in any source, and seems to have also been used for a frightening type of theater mask. Dolansky believes that the &quot;Lemuralia&quot; was meant to help those family members who had died in circumstances that prevented or delayed their admission to the afterlife; those who had died &quot;before their time,&quot; in their childhood or youth, through disease, war, assault or misadventure, or in circumstances that prevented their being given proper burial or funeral rites. 

Ovid&#x27;s is the only detailed account of &quot;Lemuria&quot;. The householder, perhaps with others, walks barefoot through the house at midnight. He washes his hands in spring water, takes his thumb between the fingers of his hand, to ward off any ghosts, then takes a mouthful of black beans and spits them out behind him or throws them behind himself, over his shoulder for the hungry &quot;lemures&quot; to gather, unseen. He chants &quot;I send these; with these beans I redeem me and mine&quot; () nine times; then the rest of the household clashes bronze pots while repeating, &quot;Ghosts of my fathers and ancestors, be gone!&quot; (&quot;Manes exite paterni!&quot;). The householder washes his hands in spring-water, three times. When he turns to see the results of the offering, or exorcism, no &quot;lemures&quot; are to be seen. Ovid uses both &quot;lemur&quot; and &quot;Manes&quot; for what are presumably the same ghosts, at the same festival, under different names but with little or no individuation other than differing levels of malice or benevolence. Presumably there was some overlap in identity. &quot;Larvae&quot;, on the other hand, were thought to have been entirely unforgiving, even demonic. Some of the literature presents them as persecuting the living, and torturing bad souls in Hades.

During the &quot;Lemuralia&quot; all temples were closed, and no marriages were allowed. The three days of the &quot;Lemuralia&quot;, and the performance of an Argei ceremony in the same month, supposedly a substitute for former human sacrifices, made the whole month of May unlucky for marriages. This is one possible explanation for Ovid&#x27;s &quot;Mense Maio malae nubunt&quot;, in his &quot;Fasti&quot; 6.219-234, cited by Erasmus in his &quot;Adagia&quot;, 1.4.9; in English roughly &quot;they marry badly who marry in May&quot;.

== Legacy ==
According to some cultural historians, Lemuria was Christianized as a feast day commemorating all Christian martyrs. Christians in 4th-century Roman Edessa held this feast on 13 May. Later, on 13 May in 609 or 610, Pope Boniface IV re-consecrated the Pantheon of Rome to the Blessed Virgin and &quot;all the martyrs&quot;; the feast of that &quot;dedicatio Sanctae Mariae ad Martyres&quot; has been celebrated at Rome ever since and started the feast of All Saints&#x27; Day.

<text>Benedict of Aniane (; ; 747 – 12 February 821 AD), born Witiza and called the Second Benedict, was a Benedictine monk and monastic reformer who had a substantial impact on the religious practice of the Carolingian Empire. His feast day is either February 11 or 12, depending on the liturgical calendar.

==Life==
According to Ardo, Benedict&#x27;s biographer, he was the son of a Visigoth, Aigulf, Count of Maguelonne (&quot;Magalonensis comes&quot;). Originally given the Gothic name Witiza, he was educated at the Frankish court of Pippin the Younger, and entered the royal service as a page. He served at the court of Charlemagne and took part in his Italian campaign of 773, where he almost drowned in the Ticino River near Pavia while attempting to save his brother. The experience led him to act on a resolve which had been slowly forming in him, to renounce the world and live the monastic life. He later left the court and was received into the monastery of Saint Sequanus, the Abbey of Saint-Seine.

At Saint-Seine, Benedict was made cellarer and then elected abbot, but realizing the monks would never conform to his strict practices he left and returned to his father&#x27;s estates in Languedoc, where he built a hermitage. Around 780, he founded a monastic community based on Eastern asceticism at Aniane in Languedoc. This community did not develop as he had intended. In 782, he founded another monastery based on Benedictine Rule, at the same location. His success there gave him considerable influence, which he used to found and reform a number of other monasteries, eventually becoming the effective abbot of all the monasteries of Charlemagne&#x27;s empire.

In 781 Louis the Pious became King of Aquitaine and asked Benedict to reform the monasteries in his territory. Later, as Emperor, he entrusted him with the coordination of practices and communication among the monasteries within his domains. He had a wide knowledge of patristic literature, and churchmen such as Alcuin sought his counsel.

In 814, Louis, now Emperor, had Benedict found a monastery on the river Inde near the court at Aachen. The monastery was at first called the &quot;Monastery of the Redeemer on the Inde&quot;, but came to be known as Kornelimünster Abbey.

He was the head of a council of abbots which in 817 at Aachen created a code of regulations, or &quot;Codex regularum&quot;, which would be binding on all their houses. Benedict sought to restore the primitive strictness of the monastic observance wherever it had been relaxed or exchanged for the less exacting canonical life. Shortly thereafter, he compiled a &quot;Concordia regularum&quot;. Sections of the Benedictine rule (except ix-xvi) are given in their order, with parallel passages from the other rules included in the Liber regularum, so as to show the agreement of principles and thus to enhance the respect due to the Benedictine. He was primarily an ecclesiastic, who zealously placed his considerable theological learning at the service of orthodoxy and the cause of Benedictine monasticism. Although these new codes fell into disuse shortly after the deaths of Benedict and his patron, Emperor Louis the Pious, they did have lasting effects on Western monasticism.

Benedict died at Kornelimünster Abbey on February 11, 821, in the monastery Louis had built for him to serve as the base for Benedict&#x27;s supervisory work. He was buried the next day on February 12, hence why some list his feast day as the 11th and some the 12th.

<text>Henry Patterson (27 July 1929 – 9 April 2022), commonly known by his pen name Jack Higgins, was a British author. He was a best-selling author of popular thrillers and espionage novels. His novel &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; (1975) sold more than 50 million copies and was adapted into a successful 1976 movie of the same title.

Some of his other notable books are &quot;A Prayer for the Dying&quot; (1973), &quot;The Eagle Has Flown&quot; (1991), &quot;Thunder Point&quot; (1993), &quot;Angel of Death&quot; (1995), &quot;Flight of Eagles&quot; (1998), and &quot;Day of Reckoning&quot; (2000). His 85 novels in total have sold more than 250 million copies and have been translated into 55 languages.

==Early life==
Jack Higgins was born Henry Patterson on 27 July 1929 in Newcastle upon Tyne to an English father and a Northern Irish mother. When his father abandoned them soon afterward, his mother returned with him to her home town of Belfast, Northern Ireland, to live with her mother and her grandfather on the Shankill Road. Raised amid the religious and political violence of Belfast, Patterson learned to read at the age of three, when he was tasked with reading &quot;The Christian Herald&quot; to his bed-ridden grandfather. At night, he would crouch beneath a window and read by the light of street lamps.
When his mother remarried, the family relocated to Leeds, West Yorkshire, England, where Patterson won a scholarship to attend Roundhay Grammar School for Boys. He proved to be an indifferent student and left school with few formal qualifications. In 1947 he began two years of national service, at first with the East Yorkshire Regiment, and later as a non-commissioned officer of the Royal Horse Guards Regiment of the Household Cavalry doing security work on the East German border.

After leaving the army, he returned to education at Beckett Park teacher training college in Leeds and studied for a BSc sociology degree as a London School of Economics external student, taking his finals in Bradford in 1961. By day, he was working as a driver and labourer at night. He chose the university for its &quot;history of nonconformism&quot;. He received his third-class degree after three years of study. After getting a teaching qualification, he started teaching at Allerton Grange Comprehensive School. He accepted a job lecturing in social psychology and criminology. He taught liberal studies at Leeds Polytechnic and education at James Graham College, which became part of Leeds Polytechnic in 1976.

==Career==

In 1959, Higgins began writing novels. One of his aliases was James Graham. The growing success of his early work allowed him to take time off from his teaching, which he quit eventually to become a full-time novelist.

Patterson&#x27;s early novels, using his own name (as &quot;Harry Patterson&quot;) as well as the pseudonyms James Graham, Martin Fallon, and Hugh Marlowe, are thrillers that typically feature hardened, cynical heroes, ruthless villains, and dangerous locales. Patterson published thirty-five such novels (sometimes three or four a year) between 1959 and 1974, learning his craft. &quot;East Of Desolation&quot; (1968), &quot;A Game For Heroes&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Savage Day&quot; (1972) are notable among his early work for their vividly described settings (Greenland, the Channel Islands, and Belfast, respectively) and offbeat plots.

Patterson began using the pseudonym Jack Higgins during the late 1960s; his first minor bestsellers were published during the early 1970s, two contemporary thrillers &quot;The Savage Day&quot; and &quot;A Prayer for the Dying&quot;, but it was the publication of his thirty-sixth book, &quot;The Eagle Has Landed,&quot; in 1975, that made Higgins&#x27; reputation. Its plot concerns a German commando unit sent into England to kidnap Winston Churchill. The main character is arguably an Irish gunman and poet, Liam Devlin. Higgins followed &quot;The Eagle Has Landed&quot; with a series of thrillers, including several (&quot;Touch The Devil&quot;, &quot;Confessional&quot;, &quot;The Eagle Has Flown&quot;) featuring the character Devlin.

The third phase of Patterson&#x27;s career began with the publication of &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; in 1992, a fictionalised retelling of an unsuccessful mortar attack on Prime Minister John Major, by a ruthless young Irish gunman-philosopher named Sean Dillon, hired by an Iraqi millionaire. Cast as the main character for the next series of novels (22 out of 43 published between 1992 and 2017), it is apparent that Dillon is in many ways an amalgamation of Patterson&#x27;s previous heroes—Chavasse with his flair for languages, Nick Miller&#x27;s familiarity with martial arts and jazz keyboard skills, Simon Vaughan&#x27;s Irish roots, facility with firearms and the cynicism that comes with assuming the responsibility of administering a justice unavailable through a civilised legal system.

==Personal life and death==
Higgins met Amy Hewitt while both were studying at the London School of Economics. They were married in 1958, soon after he received a £75 advance for his first novel—&quot;the biggest wedding present we could have had.&quot; They had four children: Sarah (born 1960), Ruth (born 1962), Sean (born 1965), and Hannah (born 1974). Their daughter Sarah Patterson authored the novel &quot;The Distant Summer&quot; (1976). The marriage ended in 1984. In 1985, he married his second wife, Denise Palmer, who was a contemporary of Theresa May at St Hugh&#x27;s College, Oxford. 

Higgins died at his home in Jersey, on 9 April 2022, at the age of 92.

==Additional Information==
At Leeds Trinity University (formerly Leeds Trinity and All Saints College), there is the Jack Higgins Prize for Outstanding Academic Achievement. This is awarded annually to select students within the English Faculty who have demonstrated exceptional academic excellence.

<doc id="353464" wikidata="Q4386338" url="?curid=353464" title="Interlisp">
<text>Interlisp (also seen with a variety of capitalizations) is a programming environment built around a version of the programming language Lisp. Interlisp development began in 1966 at Bolt, Beranek and Newman (renamed BBN Technologies) in Cambridge, Massachusetts with Lisp implemented for the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-1 computer by Danny Bobrow and D. L. Murphy. In 1970, Alice K. Hartley implemented BBN LISP, which ran on PDP-10 machines running the operating system TENEX (renamed TOPS-20). In 1973, when Danny Bobrow, Warren Teitelman and Ronald Kaplan moved from BBN to the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), it was renamed Interlisp. Interlisp became a popular Lisp development tool for artificial intelligence (AI) researchers at Stanford University and elsewhere in the community of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Interlisp was notable for integrating interactive development tools into an integrated development environment (IDE), such as a debugger, an automatic correction tool for simple errors (via do what I mean (DWIM) software design), and analysis tools.

==Adaptations==
At Xerox PARC, an early attempt was made to define a virtual machine to facilitate porting, termed the &quot;Interlisp virtual machine&quot;. However, it was not useful as a basis for porting.

Peter Deutsch defined a byte-coded instruction set for Interlisp, and implemented it as a microcode emulator for the Xerox Alto. This was then ported to a series of workstation designs produced by Xerox for internal use and for commercial exploitation, including on the Xerox 1100 (Dolphin), 1108 (Dandelion), 1109 (the floating-point enabled Dandetiger), 1186 (Daybreak), and 1132 (Dorado). Interlisp implementations for these were known collectively as Interlisp-D. Commercially, these were sold as Lisp machines and branded as Xerox AI Workstations when Larry Masinter was the chief scientist of that group. The same designs, but with different software, were also sold under different names (e.g., when running the Viewpoint system, the 1186 Daybreak was sold as the Xerox 6085.) Releases of Interlisp-D were named according to a musical theme, which ended with Koto, Lyric, and Medley. Later versions included an implementation of pre-American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Common Lisp, named Xerox Common Lisp. LOOPS, the object system for Interlisp-D, became, along with Symbolics&#x27; Flavors system, the basis for the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS).

In 1974, DARPA awarded a contract to the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) to implement Interlisp on the Burroughs B6700. The motivation was the larger virtual memory addressing space afforded by the B6700 architecture compared to the PDP-10. However, by the time the software was released (1975), the PDP-10&#x27;s address space had been increased, and Interlisp-10 remained the standard of the day for AI research. The implementors were Bill Gord and Stan Sieler, with guidance from Daniel Bobrow, and under the overall management of Dr. Ken Bowles. UCSD Interlisp included a compiler which emitted &quot;p-code&quot;, which was could be intermixed with standard LISP code during interpretation. This p-code appears to have preceded UCSD Pascal p-code by a year or two.

The PDP-10 version of Interlisp became &quot;Interlisp-10&quot;; BBN had an internal project to build &quot;Interlisp-Jericho&quot; and there was a 1982 port to Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix on the VAX by Stanford University, Information Sciences Institute (ISI) and Xerox PARC, called &quot;Interlisp-VAX&quot;.

In 1981, Warren Teitelman and Larry Masinter published a paper on Interlisp in IEEE Computer providing an overview of the system and its design philosophy, setting starts used for the platform.

Also in 1981, a variant for the MOS Technology 6502 processor, INTER-LISP/65, was released by Datasoft for the Atari 8-bit computers. In 1985 to 1987, a team from Fuji Xerox developed an implementation of the microcoded bytecode interpreter in the language C, and, together with Xerox AI Systems (XAIS) in Sunnyvale, California, completed the port of the environment and emulator to the Sun Microsystems SPARC 4 architecture. In 1987, XAIS was spun off into Envos Corporation, which failed almost immediately.

Interlisp-D release timeline:

* 1983 – Chorus
* 1983 – Fugue
* June 1984 – Carol
* January 1985 – Harmony
* 1985 – Intermezzo
* December 1985 – Koto, first release to support the Xerox 1185/1186 workstation, some support for Common Lisp
* June 1987 – Lyric, supports Xerox Common Lisp as part of the standard Lisp sysout
* September 1988 – Medley, for Xerox 1100 and Sun 3 machines
* February 1992 – Medley 2.0, includes CLOS with MOP, runs on various Unix machines, DOS 4.0, and the Xerox 1186

In 1992, an Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Software System Award recognized the team of Daniel G. Bobrow, Richard R. Burton, L. Peter Deutsch, Ronald Kaplan, Larry Masinter, Warren Teitelman for their pioneering work on Interlisp.

==Revitalization==
The Medley Interlisp source code and the source code for the virtual machine emulator have both been open-sourced by the Medley Interlisp Project. The system runs on modern hardware/operating systems.

<text>John Kenneth Macalister (July 19, 1914 – September 14, 1944) was a Rhodes Scholar and a Canadian hero of World War II.

== Biography ==
Born in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, Ken Macalister graduated from the Guelph Collegiate Vocational Institute (GCVI) and from the University of Toronto, where he studied law and won first-class honours in every subject in every year. From Toronto, he was elected as one of Ontario&#x27;s two Rhodes scholars in 1937, and studied at the New College, Oxford until 1939, graduating with one of the six first-class honours degrees awarded in a cohort of 200.

He was expanding his education further at the Institute of Corporate Law in Paris, France when World War II began in 1939. When he took the bar exam, Macalister placed first among over 150 candidates in the British Empire. Macalister tried to join the infantry but his eyesight was such that he needed thick glasses and as such could not be placed on active duty. However, fluent in French, Macalister volunteered for the Special Operations Executive (SOE) F Section where as an agent in France, his thick glasses would actually add to his disguise.

Together with fellow Canadian, Frank Pickersgill, Ken Macalister was parachuted into occupied France on June 15, 1943, to work as wireless operator for the &quot;Archdeacon&quot; network in the Ardennes area. Both men were picked up by the SOE agent Yvonne Rudellat (codename &#x27;Jacqueline&#x27;) and the French officer Pierre Culioli. Their vehicle stopped at a German checkpoint in Dhuizon, and after Rudellat and Culioli were cleared they decided to wait for the two Canadians to come through. Minutes later, however, the Canadians&#x27; cover was blown and Culioli tried to speed away but he and Rudellat were captured when they ran into another checkpoint about 10 kilometres away. Rudellat subsequently died in Bergen-Belsen; Culioli survived the war.

The Canadians were taken to Fresnes prison where they were interrogated and tortured repeatedly. Macalister steadfastly refused to reveal his security checks to the Germans who had his codes and were anxious to send misleading messages back to the SOE&#x27;s London headquarters. Macalister gave his interrogators nothing and when his captors tried to send messages, SOE recognized them as fake.

Unable to get anything of value from him, the security forces shipped Macalister, along with Frank Pickersgill and Roméo Sabourin to Buchenwald concentration camp on August 27, 1944. They were known as the Robert Benoist group, executed at Buchenwald on September 14, 1944.

Captain Ken Macalister is honoured on the Brookwood Memorial, Surrey in Brookwood, Surrey, England and as one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of France, he is listed on the &quot;Roll of Honour&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre département of France. He is commemorated by an obelisk at Romorantin-Lanthenay, where he is one of 4 members of SOE to be listed. In Guelph, there’s a park named after him with a maple tree representing his time in Canada, an oak his British sojourn, and a linden his time in France. The University of Toronto has designated a Pickersgill-Macalister garden on the west side of the &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Tower&quot; monument.

<text>Władysław Eugeniusz Sikorski (; 20 May 18814 July 1943) was a Polish military and political leader.

Before World War I, Sikorski established and participated in several underground organizations that promoted the cause of Polish independence. He fought with distinction in the Polish Legions during World War I, and later in the newly created Polish Army during the Polish–Soviet War of 1919–1921. In the latter war, he played a prominent role in the decisive 1920 Battle of Warsaw. 

In the early years of the Second Polish Republic, Sikorski held government posts including prime minister (1922–1923) and minister of military affairs (1923–1924). Following Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s May 1926 Coup and the installation of the Sanation government, he fell out of favor with the new régime.

During World War II, Sikorski became prime minister of the Polish government-in-exile, Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Armed Forces, and a vigorous advocate of the Polish cause in the diplomatic sphere. He supported the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, which had been severed after the September 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland. (Subsequently, in April 1943, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin broke off Soviet-Polish diplomatic relations after Sikorski asked the International Red Cross to investigate the Katyn massacres.

In July 1943 a plane carrying Sikorski plunged into the sea immediately on takeoff from Gibraltar, killing all on board except the pilot. The exact circumstances of Sikorski&#x27;s death have been disputed and have given rise to various theories surrounding the crash. Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles, and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause.

== Early life and World War I ==
Sikorski was born in Tuszów Narodowy, Galicia, at the time part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He was the third child in his family; his father was Tomasz Sikorski, a school teacher; his mother was Emilia Habrowska. His grandfather, Tomasz Kopaszyna Sikorski, had fought and been wounded at the Battle of Olszynka Grochowska in the November Uprising, during which he received the Virtuti Militari medal.

Sikorski attended the gimnazjum in Rzeszów (now Konarski&#x27;s High School in Rzeszów) from 1893 to 1897, then transferred for a year to a Rzeszów teachers&#x27; college. In 1899 he attended the Lwów Franciszek Józef Gymnasium, and in 1902 he passed his final high school exam there. Starting that year, young Sikorski studied engineering at the Lwów Polytechnic, specializing in road and bridge construction, and graduated in 1908 with a diploma in hydraulic engineering. In 1906 Sikorski volunteered for a year&#x27;s service in the Austro-Hungarian army and attended the Austrian Military School, obtaining an officer&#x27;s diploma and becoming an army reserve second lieutenant (&quot;podporucznik rezerwy&quot;). In 1909 he married , whom he met while at the high school in Lwów. In 1912 they had a daughter, Zofia. After graduation he lived in Leżajsk and worked for the Galician administration&#x27;s hydraulic engineering department, working on the regulation of the San river, and later was involved in private enterprises related to construction, real estate and the petroleum trade.

During his studies at the Polytechnic, Sikorski became involved in the People&#x27;s School Association (&quot;Towarzystwo Szkoły Ludowej&quot;), an organization dedicated to spreading literacy among the rural populace. Around 1904–1905 he was briefly involved with the &quot;endecja&quot; Association of the Polish Youth &quot;Zet&quot;, and then drifted towards paramilitary socialist organizations related to the Polish Socialist Party, which was intent on securing Polish independence. He made contact with the socialist movement around 1905–1906 through the &quot;Union for the Resurrection of the Polish Nation&quot; (&quot;Związek Odrodzenia Narodu Polskiego&quot;). In 1908, in Lwów, Sikorski—together with Józef Piłsudski, Marian Kukiel, Walery Sławek, Kazimierz Sosnkowski, and Henryk Minkiewicz—organized the secret Union for Active Struggle&quot; (Związek Walki Czynnej)&quot;, with the aim of bringing about an uprising against the Russian Empire, one of Poland&#x27;s three partitioners. In 1910, likewise in Lwów, Sikorski helped to organize a Riflemen&#x27;s Association (the &quot;Związek Strzelecki&quot;), became the president of its Lwów chapter, and became responsible for the military arm within the Commission of Confederated Independence Parties (&quot;Komisja Skonfederowanych Stronnictw Niepodległościowych, KSSN&quot;). Having a military education, he lectured other activists on military tactics.

Upon the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914, Sikorski was mobilized, but through KSSN influence he was allowed to participate in the organizing of the Polish military units, rather than being delegated to other duties by the Austro-Hungarian military command. In the first few weeks of the war he became the chief of the Military Department in the Supreme National Committee (&quot;Naczelny Komitet Narodowy, NKN&quot;) and remained in this post until 1916. He was a commissioner in charge of the recruitment to the Polish Legions in Kraków, choosing this role over the opportunity to serve in the Legions as a frontline commander. On 30 September 1914 he was promoted to &quot;podpułkownik&quot; (lieutenant colonel), and soon after that he became the commander of a Legions officer school (&quot;Szkoła Podchorążych&quot;). The Legions—the army created by Józef Piłsudski to liberate Poland from Russian and, ultimately, Austro-Hungarian and German rule—initially fought in alliance with Austria-Hungary against Russia. From August 1915 there was growing tension between Sikorski, who advocated cooperation with Austria-Hungary, and Piłsudski, who felt that Austria-Hungary and Germany had betrayed the trust of the Polish people. In 1916 Piłsudski actively campaigned to have the Military Department of NKN disbanded. In July that year, Sikorski was promoted to &quot;pułkownik&quot; (colonel). Following the Act of 5th November (1916), Sikorski became involved with the Legions&#x27; alternatives, the Polish Auxiliary Corps and Polnische Wehrmacht. In June 1917 Piłsudski refused Austro-Hungarian orders to swear loyalty to the Habsburg Emperor (the &quot;oath crisis&quot;) and was interned at the fortress of Magdeburg, while Sikorski abandoned Polnische Wehrmacht and returned to the Austro-Hungarian Army. In 1918, however, following the February Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and the battle of Rarańcza, Sikorski chose belatedly to side with Piłsudski, announcing solidarity with his actions, protesting against the planned separation of Chełm Land from the planned Polish state, and thus soon joined Piłsudski in internment (he would be held in Dulfalva (Dulovo)). Nonetheless, this was not enough to smooth the differences between him and Piłsudski, and these two major Polish leaders would drift farther apart in the continuing years.

== Eastern wars ==
=== Polish–Ukrainian war ===
In 1918 the Russian, Austro-Hungarian and German empires collapsed, and Poland once again became independent, but the borders of the Second Polish Republic were not fully determined and were unstable. In the east they would be formed in the escalating conflicts among Polish, Ukrainian, Lithuanian and Soviet forces in what culminated in the Polish–Soviet War (1919–1921). Winston Churchill commented: &quot;The war of giants had ended, the wars of the pygmies began.&quot; Bolshevik leaders saw Poland as a bridge that the communist revolution would have to force to bring communism to the West, and Poland&#x27;s very existence would soon be at stake.

=== Polish–Soviet war ===
After his release from internment, from 1 May 1918 Sikorski worked for the Regency Council, organizing the new Polish Army. He was soon at the frontlines again, this time in the Polish–Ukrainian War, where troops under his command secured and defended Przemyśl in October–November 1918.

Polish independence came in November 1918 with the formation of the Second Republic of Poland. In the course of the Polish–Ukrainian War, and in the opening phase of the Polish–Soviet War, Sikorski, now a high-ranking officer of the Polish Army was involved in further operations in the Galicia region. In January 1919 he commanded troops defending Gródek Jagielloński; in March that year he commanded an infantry division, advancing to Stawczany and Zbrucz. From 1 August 1918 Sikorski commanded the Polesie Group, and the Polish 9th Infantry Division. In order to curtail excesses of the forces under his command, he oversaw trials of 36 officers. His forces took Mozyr and Kalenkowicze in March 1920, and he would command the Polesie Group during Poland&#x27;s Kiev offensive in April 1920, advancing to the Dnieper River and the Chernobyl region. On 1 April that year he was promoted to brigade general. 

As the Polish–Soviet War grew in intensity, in late April 1920 the Red Army of Russia&#x27;s new Soviet regime pushed back Polish forces and invaded Poland. Subsequently, Sikorski successfully defended Mozyr and Kalenkowicze until 29 June, but later failed to hold the Brest fortress, although he defended it long enough to allow the Polish forces in the region to retreat in an orderly manner. On 6 August he was named the commander of the newly formed Polish 5th Army, which was tasked with holding the front to the north of Modlin, between Narew and Wkra rivers. He distinguished himself commanding the 5th Army on the Lower Vistula front during the Battle of Warsaw. At that time Soviet forces, expecting an easy final victory, were surprised and crippled by the Polish counter-attack. During that battle (sometimes referred to as &quot;the Miracle at the Vistula&quot;) Sikorski stopped the Bolshevik advance north of Warsaw and gave Piłsudski, the Polish commander-in-chief, the time he needed for his counter-offensive; beginning with the 15 August his forces successfully engaged the Soviet 5th and 15th Armies. After the Battle of Warsaw, from 30 August, Sikorski commanded the 3rd Army. His forces took Pińsk, and fought during the latter stages of the Battle of Lwów and the Battle of Zamość, and then after Battle of Niemen advanced with his forces toward Latvia and deep into Belarus. The Poles defeated the Soviets, and the Polish–Soviet Treaty of Riga (March 1921) gave Poland substantial areas of Belarus and Ukraine&#x27;s (Kresy). Sikorski&#x27;s fame was enhanced as he became known to the Polish public as one of the heroes of the Polish–Soviet War. He also kept publishing military science articles during the war itself. For his valorous achievements Sikorski was promoted to divisional general on 28 February 1921, and was awarded Poland&#x27;s highest military decoration, the order of Virtuti Militari, on 15 March that year.

== In government and in opposition ==
Despite their differences, Piłsudski praised Sikorski in his reports, recommending him for Chief of the General Staff and minister of war positions; only generals Kazimierz Sosnkowski and Edward Rydz-Śmigły received better evaluations from him. Sikorski was popular among many soldiers, and in politics, particularly appealing to Polish conservatives and liberals. On 1 April 1921 Sikorski replaced General Tadeusz Rozwadowski as chief of the Polish General Staff. Between 1922 and 1925 he held a number of high government offices. Based on his analysis, the Polish Council of Ministers adopted new foreign policy that would remain roughly unchanged until the late 1930s (preserving the &quot;status quo&quot; in Europe, and treating Germany and Russia as equal potential threats). On 12 December 1922 he issued a general order, stressing the need for the military to stay out of politics. After the assassination of President of Poland Gabriel Narutowicz on 16 December 1922, the Marshal of the Sejm (the Sejm being the Polish parliament), Maciej Rataj, appointed Sikorski prime minister. From 18 December 1922, to 26 May 1923, Sikorski served as prime minister and also as minister of internal affairs, and was even considered as possible president. During his brief tenure as prime minister, he became popular with the Polish public and carried out essential reforms in addition to guiding the country&#x27;s foreign policy in a direction that gained the approval and cooperation of the League of Nations and tightened Polish-French cooperation. He obtained recognition of Poland&#x27;s eastern frontiers from the UK, France, and the United States during the Conference of Ambassadors on 15 March 1923. He aided Treasury Minister Władysław Grabski&#x27;s reforms aimied at curtailing inflation and reforming the currency and supported ethnic minorities. His government nonetheless lost support in the Sejm and resigned on 26 May 1923.

From 30 September 1923 to 1924 he held the post of chief inspector of infantry (&quot;Generalny Inspektor Piechoty&quot;). From 17 February 1924 to 1925, under Prime Minister Grabski, he was minister of military affairs and guided the modernization of the Polish military; he also created the Korpus Ochrony Pogranicza. He worked actively to promote the cause of the Polish-French military alliance. His proposal to increase the powers of the minister of military affairs while reducing those of the Chief Inspector of the Armed Forces met with sharp disapproval from Piłsudski, who at that time was gathering many opponents of the current government. From 1925 to 1928 Sikorski commanded Military Corps District (&quot;Okręg Korpusu&quot;) VI in Lwów.

A democrat and supporter of the Sejm, Sikorski declared his opposition to Józef Piłsudski&#x27;s May 1926 coup d&#x27;état; he remained in Lwów, refused to dispatch his forces, and played no substantive role in the short struggle. In 1928 he was relieved by Piłsudski of his command, and while he remained on active service, he received no other posting. That year also saw the publication of his book on the Polish–Soviet War, &quot;Nad Wisłą i Wkrą. Studium do polsko–radzieckiej wojny 1920 roku&quot; (At the Vistula and Wkra Rivers: a Contribution to the Study of the Polish–Soviet War of 1920). He would spend the following years publishing works on military theory, history, and foreign policy. His most famous work was his 1934 book &quot;Przyszła wojnajej możliwości i charakter oraz związane z nimi zagadnienia obrony kraju&quot; (&quot;War in the Future: Its Possibilities and Character and Associated Questions of National Defense&quot;, published in English in 1943 as &quot;Modern Warfare: Its Character, Its Problems&quot;), in which he predicted the return of maneuver warfare. He wrote several other books and many articles, foreseeing, among other things, the rapid militarization of Germany.

In due course, soon after he was relieved of command, and as a semi-dictatorial Sanation regime was established, Sikorski joined the anti-Piłsudski opposition. Sikorski largely withdrew from active politics, spending much of his time in Paris, France, working with the French Ecole Superieure de Guerre (war college). Even after the death of Piłsudski in 1935, he was still marginalized, politically and militarily, by Piłsudski&#x27;s successors. In February the following year, together with several prominent Polish politicians (Wincenty Witos, Ignacy Paderewski, and General Józef Haller) he joined the Front Morges, an anti-Sanation] political grouping.

== Prime Minister in exile ==
In the days before Poland was invaded by Germany in September 1939, and during the invasion itself, Sikorski&#x27;s request for a military command continued to be denied by the Polish commander in chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły. Sikorski escaped through Romania to Paris, where on 28 September he joined Władysław Raczkiewicz and Stanisław Mikołajczyk in a Polish government-in-exile, taking command of the newly formed Polish Armed Forces in France. Two days later, on 30 September, president Raczkiewicz called him to serve as the first Polish prime minister in exile. On 7 November he became commander in chief and General Inspector of the Armed Forces (&quot;Naczelny Wódz i Generalny Inspektor Sił Zbrojnych&quot;), following Rydz-Śmigły&#x27;s resignation. Sikorski would also hold the position of Polish Minister of Military Affairs, thus uniting in his person all control over the Polish military in wartime.

During his years as prime minister in exile, Sikorski personified the hopes and dreams of millions of Poles, as reflected in the saying, &quot;When the sun is higher, Sikorski is nearer&quot; (Polish: &quot;Gdy słoneczko wyżej, to Sikorski bliżej&quot;). At the same time, from early on he had to work to reconcile the pro- and anti-Piłsudskiite factions.

His government was recognized by the western Allies. Nonetheless, Sikorski&#x27;s government struggled to get its point of view heard by France and the United Kingdom. The western Allies refused to recognize the Soviet Union as an aggressor, despite the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939. Furthermore, he struggled to secure resources needed to recreate the Polish Army in exile.

Poland, even with its territories occupied, still commanded substantial armed forces: the Polish Navy had sailed to Britain just before the war&#x27;s outbreak, and thousands of Polish soldiers and airmen had evacuated from overrun Poland via Hungry and Romania. A new Polish Army was soon re-formed in France and French-mandated Syria; and a Polish Air Force, in France. In addition, Poland had a large resistance movement, and Sikorski&#x27;s policies included founding the Union of Armed Struggle (&quot;Związek Walki Zbrojnej&quot;), later transformed into the Home Army (&quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;), and creation of an agency, the Government Delegation for Poland to supervise the Polish Underground State in occupied Poland.

In 1940 the Polish Highland Brigade took part in the Battle of Narvik in Norway, and two Polish divisions participated in the defense of France, while a Polish motorized brigade and two infantry divisions were in process of forming. A Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade was created in French-mandated Syria. The Polish Air Force in France had 86 aircraft with one and a half of the squadrons fully operational, and the remaining two and a half in various stages of training. Although many Polish personnel had died in the fighting or had been interned in Switzerland following the fall of France, General Sikorski refused French Marshal Philippe Pétain&#x27;s proposal of a Polish capitulation to Germany. On 19 June 1940, Sikorski met with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and promised that Polish forces would fight alongside the British until final victory. Sikorski and his government moved to London and were able to evacuate many Polish troops to Britain. After the signing of a Polish-British Military Agreement on 5 August 1940, they proceeded to build up and train the Polish Armed Forces in the West. Experienced Polish pilots took part in the Battle of Britain, where the Polish 303 Fighter Squadron achieved the highest number of kills of any Allied squadron. Sikorski&#x27;s Polish forces would form one of the most significant Allied contingents.


The Fall of France weakened Sikorski&#x27;s position, and his proposal to consider building a new Polish army in the Soviet-occupied territories led to much criticism from within the Polish community in exile. On 19 July Raczkiewicz dismissed him from his position as the prime minister, replacing him with August Zaleski; however, within days pressure from Sikorski&#x27;s sympathizers, including the British government, made Raczkiewicz reconsider his decision, and Sikorski was reinstated as the prime minister on 25 July.

One of Sikorski&#x27;s political goals was the creation of a Central and Eastern European federation, starting with the Polish-Czechoslovakian confederation. He saw such an organization as necessary if smaller states were to stand up to traditional German and Russian imperialism. That concept, although ultimately futile, gained some traction around that time, as Sikorski and Edvard Beneš from the Czechoslovak government-in-exile, signed an agreement declaring the intent to pursue closer cooperation on 10 November that year. On 24 December 1940 Sikorski was promoted to generał broni. In March 1941 he visited the United States; he would visit the US again in March and December 1942.

Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union (&quot;Operation Barbarossa&quot;) in June 1941, Sikorski opened negotiations with the Soviet ambassador to London, Ivan Maisky, to re-establish diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union, which had been broken off after the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939. In December that year, Sikorski went to Moscow with a diplomatic mission. The Polish Government reached an agreement with the Soviet Union (the Sikorski-Maisky Pact of 17 August 1941), confirmed by Joseph Stalin in December of that year. Stalin agreed to invalidate the September 1939 Soviet-German partition of Poland, declare the Russo-German Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 null and void, and release tens of thousands of Polish prisoners-of-war held in Soviet camps. Pursuant to an agreement between the Polish government-in-exile and Stalin, the Soviets granted &quot;amnesty&quot; to many Polish citizens, from whom a new army (the Polish II Corps) was formed under General Władysław Anders and later evacuated to the Middle East, where Britain faced a dire shortage of military forces. The whereabouts of thousands more Polish officers, however, would remain unknown for two more years, and this would weigh heavily on both Polish–Soviet relations and on Sikorski&#x27;s fate.

Initially, Sikorski supported the Polish–Soviet rapprochement, which reignited criticism of his person from some Polish factions. Nonetheless, Sikorski soon realized that the Soviet Union had plans for Polish territories, which would be unacceptable to Polish public. The Soviets began their diplomatic offensive after their first major military victory in the Battle of Moscow, and intensified this policy after the battle of Stalingrad, showing less and less regard for their deals with Poland. In January 1942 British diplomat Stafford Cripps informed General Sikorski that while Stalin planned to extend Polish borders to the west, by giving Poland Germany&#x27;s East Prussia, he also wanted to considerably push Poland&#x27;s eastern frontier westwards, along the lines of the Versailles concept of the Curzon Line, and acquire Lwów and Wilno, if not both. Sikorksi&#x27;s stance on eastern borders was not inflexible; he noted in some documents that some concessions might be acceptable, however, giving up both Lwów and Wilno was not. Initially he also referred to plans of annexing German land to the Oder as megalomania.

== Katyn revelation and death ==
In 1943 the fragile relations between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile finally reached their breaking point when, on 13 April, the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission the discovery of the bodies of 20,000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviets and buried in Katyn Forest, near Smolensk, Russia. Stalin claimed that the atrocity had been carried out by the Germans, while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre to drive a wedge between Poland, the Western Allies and the Soviet Union. Moscow did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until 1989.

When Sikorski refused to accept the Soviet explanation and requested an investigation by the International Red Cross on 16 April, the Soviets accused the government-in-exile of cooperating with Nazi Germany and broke off diplomatic relations on 25 April.

Beginning in late May 1943, Sikorski began visiting Polish forces stationed in the Middle East. In addition to inspecting the forces and raising morale, Sikorski was also occupied with political matters; around that time, a conflict was growing between him and General Władysław Anders, as Sikorski was still open to some normalization of Polish–Soviet relations, to which Anders was vehemently opposed. 

On 4 July 1943, while Sikorski was returning from an inspection of Polish forces in the Middle East, he was killed, together with his daughter, his chief of staff Tadeusz Klimecki, and seven others, when his plane, a Liberator II, serial &quot;AL523&quot;, crashed into the sea 16 seconds after takeoff from Gibraltar Airport at 23:07 hours. The crash was attributed to cargo on the plane shifting to the back upon takeoff. Only the pilot, Eduard Prchal (1911–1984), survived the crash. 

Sikorski was buried in a brick-lined grave at the Polish War Cemetery in Newark-on-Trent, England, on 16 July that year. Winston Churchill delivered a eulogy at his funeral. On 14 September 1993, his remains were exhumed and transferred via Polish Air Force TU-154M, and escorted by RAF 56 Sqn Tornado F3 jets, to the royal crypts at Wawel Castle in Kraków, Poland.

== Aftermath ==

Immediately after the crash, a Polish officer who had witnessed the event from the airstrip began sobbing quietly and repeating: &quot;Now Poland is lost! Now Poland is lost!&quot; (&quot;To Polska stracona!&quot;) General Sikorski&#x27;s death marked a turning point for Polish influence amongst the Anglo-American allies. No Pole after him would have much sway with the Allied politicians. Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause. 

After the Soviets had broken off diplomatic relations with Sikorski&#x27;s government in April 1943, in May and June Stalin had recalled several Soviet ambassadors for &quot;consultations&quot;: Maxim Litvinov from Washington, Fyodor Gusev from Montreal, and Ivan Maisky from London. 

While Churchill had been publicly supportive of Sikorski&#x27;s government, reminding Stalin of his pact with Nazi Germany in 1939 and of their joint attack on Poland, in secret consultations with Roosevelt he admitted that Poland would have to make some concessions to appease the powerful Soviets. The Polish–Soviet crisis was beginning to threaten cooperation between the western Allies and the Soviets at a time when the Poles&#x27; importance to the western Allies, essential in the first years of the war, was beginning to fade with the entry, into the conflict, of the military and industrial giants, the Soviet Union and the United States.

The Allies had no intention of letting Sikorski&#x27;s successor, Stanisław Mikołajczyk, jeopardize the alliance with the Soviets. No representative of the Polish government-in-exile was invited to attend the Tehran Conference ( ) or the Yalta Conference (4–11 February 1945), the two crucial events in which the Western Allies and the Soviets discussed the shape of the postwar world and decided Poland&#x27;s fate. 

Only four months after Sikorski&#x27;s death, in November 1943, at Tehran, Churchill and Roosevelt agreed with Stalin that the whole of Poland east of the Curzon Line would be ceded to the Soviets. In Teheran, neither Churchill nor Roosevelt objected to Stalin&#x27;s suggestion that the Polish government-in-exile in London did not represent Polish interests; as historian Anita Prażmowska notes, &quot;this spelled the end of that government&#x27;s tenuous influence and raison d&#x27;être.&quot; 

After the Teheran Conference, Stalin decided to create his own puppet government for Poland, and a Committee of National Liberation (the &quot;PKWN&quot;) was proclaimed in the summer of 1944. The Soviet Government recognized the Committee as the only legitimate authority in Poland and called Mikołajczyk&#x27;s Government in London an &quot;illegal and self-styled authority.&quot; Mikołajczyk would serve as prime minister&#x27;s until 24 November 1944 when, realizing the increasing powerlessness of the Polish Government-in-Exile, he resigned and was succeeded by Tomasz Arciszewski, &quot;whose obscurity&quot;, according to historian Mieczysław B. Biskupski, &quot;signaled the arrival of the government in exile at total inconsequentiality.&quot; 

Stalin soon began a campaign for recognition by the Western Allies of a Soviet-backed Polish government led by Wanda Wasilewska, a dedicated communist with a seat in the Supreme Soviet; and with General Zygmunt Berling, commander of the 1st Polish Army in Russia, as commander-in-chief of all Polish Armed Forces. By the time of the Potsdam conference in 1945, Poland had been relegated to the Soviet sphere of influence – an abandonment of the Polish Government-in-Exile that led to the rise of the Western-betrayal concept.

== Remembrance ==

A number of poems dedicated to Sikorski were written by Polish authors during the war. In its aftermath, in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, Sikorski&#x27;s historic role, like that of all the adherents of the London government, would be minimized and distorted by propaganda, and those loyal to the government-in-exile would be liable to imprisonment and even execution. In time, restrictions on discussing Sikorski began to ease; on a centennial anniversary of his birth in 1981, commemorative events were held on the Rzeszów Voivodeship, including an academic conference, and revealing of plaques in Nisko and Leżajsk. published a novel on him, &quot;Wejście w mrok&quot; (1971), and in 1983 a movie, &quot;Katastrofa w Gibraltarze&quot; by Bohdan Poręba, was made. The Polish government-in-exile, of which Sikorski was the first prime minister, would continue in existence until the end of communist rule in Poland in 1990, when Lech Wałęsa became the first post-communist president of Poland. On 17 September 1993 a statue of Sikorski, sculpted by , was revealed in Rzeszów. In 1995, Sikorski became the patron of the newly formed Polish 9th Mechanized Brigade. In 2003, the Polish parliament (Sejm) declared the year (60th anniversary of Sikorski&#x27;s death) to be the &quot;Year of General Sikorski&quot;. A number of streets and schools in Poland bear Sikorski&#x27;s name.

Memory of General Sikorski was also preserved both in Poland and abroad, by organizations like the Sikorski Institute in London. In the UK, Sikorski received honoris causa degrees from the University of Liverpool and University of St Andrews. In 1981, a commemorative plaque was revealed at Hotel Rubens in London, where during the war Polish Military Headquarters, including Sikorski&#x27;s office, were located. He is commemorated in London&#x27;s Portland Place, near the Embassy of Poland, with a larger than life statue, unveiled in 2000. A propeller from the plane in which he died is the centrepiece of a new memorial to Sikorski at Europa Point, Gibraltar.

== Death controversy ==


A British Court of Inquiry convened on 7 July 1943, investigated the crash of Sikorski&#x27;s Liberator II serial &quot;AL 523&quot;, but was unable to determine the cause, finding only that it was an accident and &quot;due to jamming of elevator controls&quot;, noting that &quot;it has not been possible to determine how the jamming occurred but it has been established that there was no sabotage.&quot;. The Polish government refused to endorse this report, due to the contradiction about the cause not being determined but sabotage being ruled out.

The political context of the event, coupled with a variety of curious circumstances (for instance, the Soviet agent Kim Philby was head of counter-intelligence for MI6 in Gibraltar at the time), immediately gave rise to numerous speculation that Sikorski&#x27;s death had been no accident, and may have been the direct result of a Soviet, British, or even Polish conspiracy. Some modern sources note that the accident is not fully explained. However, as Roman Wapiński noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the &quot;Polish Biographical Dictionary&quot; in 1997, no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing has been found, and Sikorski&#x27;s official cause of death is listed as an accident.

In 2008 Sikorski was exhumed and his remains were examined by Polish scientists, who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash and that there was no evidence that Sikorski was murdered, ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before the incident; however they did not rule out the possibility of sabotage, which was investigated by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance. In 2013, the investigation ended, with the Institute of National Remembrance concluding that deliberate tampering to the aircraft could be neither confirmed nor ruled out.

<doc id="353482" wikidata="Q3568818" url="?curid=353482" title="William Marwood">
<text>William Marwood (1818 – 4 September 1883) was a British state hangman. He developed the technique of hanging known as the &quot;long drop&quot;.

==Early life==
Marwood was born in 1818 in the village of Goulceby, the fifth of ten children born to William and Elizabeth Marwood. He was originally a cobbler like his father, of Church Lane, Horncastle, Lincolnshire, England.

In 1852 he appears on the electoral roll as a shoemaker , living in Old Bolingbroke, Lincolnshire. He was married twice: first to a woman named Jessey who died during the 1860s, then to Ellen Andrews (who died aged 55 shortly after Marwood himself).

==Executioner==
At the age of 54 he persuaded the governor of Lincoln Castle Gaol to allow him to conduct an execution. The efficient way in which he conducted the hanging of William Frederick Horry on 1 April 1872 assisted him in being appointed hangman by the Sheriffs of London and Middlesex in 1874, in succession to William Calcraft, at a retainer of £20 a year plus £10 per execution.

===The &quot;Long Drop&quot;===
Marwood developed the &quot;long drop&quot; technique of hanging, which aimed to ensure that the prisoner&#x27;s neck was broken instantly at the end of the drop, resulting in the prisoner dying of asphyxia, but while unconscious. This was considered more humane than the slow death by strangulation caused by the &quot;short drop&quot; method, particularly distressing to prison governors and staff who were required to witness executions at close quarters following abolition of public executions by the Capital Punishment Amendment Act 1868.

===Notable executions===

In his nine years as a hangman, Marwood hanged 176 people, including:
* William Frederick Horry, the first person to be hanged by William Marwood and the first person to be hanged using the &quot;long drop&quot; method; executed at Lincoln Castle, Lincolnshire on 1 April 1872.
* Henry Wainwright, a brushmaker who murdered his mistress Harriet Lane in September 1874 and buried her body in a warehouse he owned. When declared bankrupt the next year, he disinterred the body (September 1875) and was arrested attempting to rebury it. He was hanged in Newgate on 21 December 1875.
* Charles Peace, the archetypal Victorian burglar and murderer, whose name struck terror in the hearts of everyone at the time; hanged at Armley Jail, Leeds, Yorkshire, on 25 February 1879. Marwood apparently met Charles Peace on a railway journey a few years before the execution. Peace asked Marwood about his experiences. At the time of the hanging, Marwood reassured Peace he would make it fast and painless with the long drop method.
* Kate Webster, an Irish servant woman who murdered her employer; hanged at Wandsworth Prison, London, on 29 July 1879.
* Charles Shurety who viciously beat his common-law wife&#x27;s young daughter to death in London; he was executed at Newgate Prison, London on 5 January 1880, after a failed attempt to stop the execution with a forged order from the Home Office.
* Percy Lefroy Mapleton, who murdered Isaac Frederick Gold on a train between London and Brighton for his watch and some coins; Mapleton was arrested almost immediately, but escaped before being arrested again, convicted, and hanged at Lewes on 29 November 1881.
* Dr George Henry Lamson, who poisoned Percy Johns (his crippled brother-in-law) with aconitine at Wimbledon so his wife could inherit some money. Lamson actually returned from France, certain he had covered his tracks; he was tried and convicted, and hanged at Wandsworth Prison on 28 April 1882.
* Maolra Seoighe, convicted, along with six other men, of the murders of five members of the Joyce family in Maamtrasna. He was hanged, alongside two of the other convicted men, on 15 December 1882 in Galway. Seoighe&#x27;s hanging did not go smoothly as during his vehement protests of innocence, right up to the drop, the rope became disarranged, and he took several minutes to die. Marwood was heard to say ‘bother the fellow’ and to sit at the edge of the scaffold and move the rope back and forward to aid the process. An inquest jury severely censured Marwood for his carelessness. On 4 April 2018 the President of Ireland issued a posthumous pardon for Seoighe due to evidence that he was innocent of the murders.
* James Carey, Joe Brady and three other members of the &quot;Irish National Invincibles&quot; gang who murdered Lord Frederick Cavendish, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, and Thomas Henry Burke, the Permanent Under-Secretary for Ireland, with surgical knives in Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park; they were hanged at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin in 1883.

===Legacy===
William Marwood influenced James Berry, a retired police officer and friend, to take up the role of hangman. During his time Berry improved upon William Marwood&#x27;s technique of the long drop.

Marwood was one of two executioners to give their name to the character of the hangman in the British Punch and Judy puppet show (Jack Ketch being the better known one).

In Marwood&#x27;s time there was a popular quip as follows:
:&quot;If Pa killed Ma&quot;
:&quot;Who&#x27;d kill Pa?&quot;
:&quot;Marwood.&quot;

In the play &quot;The Life and Adventurers of Charles Peace&quot; (1927) Marwood&#x27;s role of executioner was played by the former hangman John Ellis.

==Death==
Marwood died in 1883 from pneumonia and jaundice and was buried at Trinity Church, Horncastle, Lincolnshire.

<text>The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, commonly known as the 9/11 Commission, was set up on November 27, 2002, to investigate all aspects of the September 11 attacks, the deadliest terrorist attack in world history. It was created by Congressional legislation, which charged it with preparing &quot;a full and complete account of the circumstances surrounding the September 11 attacks&quot;, including preparedness by the U.S. federal government for the attacks, the response following the attacks, and steps that can be taken to guard against a future terrorist attack. 

The 9/11 Commission was chaired by Thomas Kean, a two-term former governor of New Jersey from 1982 until 1990, and included five Democrats and five Republicans. The legislation creating the commission was signed into law by President George W. Bush.

The commission&#x27;s final report, known as the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, was published on July 22, 2004. It is 585 pages, including the findings of the commission&#x27;s extensive interviews and testimony received during its investigation. The primary conclusion in the &quot;9/11 Report&quot; is that failures of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) permitted the September 11 terrorist attacks to occur and that wiser and more aggressive actions by these agencies could potentially have prevented the attack.

After the publication of its final report, the commission closed on August 21, 2004. The commission&#x27;s website was shut down, but has been archived.

==History==

The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States was established on November 27, 2002, by President George W. Bush and the United States Congress, with former secretary of state Henry Kissinger initially appointed to head the commission. However, Kissinger resigned only weeks after being appointed, to avoid conflicts of interest. Former U.S. senator George Mitchell was originally appointed as the vice chairman, but he stepped down on December 10, 2002, not wanting to sever ties to his law firm. On December 15, 2002, Bush appointed former New Jersey governor Tom Kean to head the commission.

By the spring of 2003, the commission was off to a slow start, needing additional funding to help it meet its target day for the final report, of May 27, 2004. In late March, the Bush administration agreed to provide an additional $9 million for the commission, though this was $2 million short of what the commission requested. The first hearings were held from March 31 to April 1, 2003, in New York City.

U.S. president George W. Bush initially appointed former U.S. secretary of state and national security advisor Henry Kissinger as the commission&#x27;s chairman. Following his appointment, Congress insisted that Kissinger disclose the names of his clients at Kissinger Associates, a New York City-based consulting firm he ran. The firm has long been discreet about its clientele. Kissinger refused to provide Congress with the names of his clients, and resigned as the commission&#x27;s chairman. Bush then appointed Thomas Kean, a two-term governor of New Jersey from 1982 to 1990, as Kissinger&#x27;s replacement.

==Testimony==
Present U.S. federal government officials who were called to testify before the 9/11 Commission included:
* George W. Bush, U.S. president testified but not under oath in a session that was not officially transcribed because the White House considered it a &quot;private meeting&quot; in which highly classified information would be discussed. Bush asked that his testimony be limited to one hour. However, the meeting lasted for three hours and ten minutes. Bush&#x27;s testimony took place in the Oval Office. Initially, Bush insisted that he would testify only to the chairman and vice chairman of the 9/11 Commission, but later agreed to testify before the full panel.
* Dick Cheney, U.S. vice president testified but not under oath. The session was not officially transcribed because the White House considered it a &quot;private meeting&quot; in which highly classified information would be discussed. Cheney&#x27;s testimony took place in the Oval Office.
* George Tenet, director of the Central Intelligence Agency
* Colin Powell, Secretary of State
* Donald Rumsfeld, Secretary of Defense
* Condoleezza Rice, National Security Advisor
* Richard Armitage, Deputy Secretary of State
* Paul Wolfowitz, Deputy Secretary of Defense
* Tom Ridge, Secretary of Homeland Security and former governor of Pennsylvania
* John Ashcroft, Attorney General

Former federal government officials who were called to testify before the 9/11 Commission included:
* Bill Clinton, former president, testified in private separately from Al Gore. Clinton&#x27;s testimony was recorded and not limited in time.
* Al Gore, former vice president, testified in private separately from Bill Clinton. Gore&#x27;s testimony was recorded and not limited in time.
* Madeleine Albright, former secretary of state
* William Cohen, former secretary of defense
* Sandy Berger, former national security advisor
* Richard A. Clarke, former chief counter-terrorism adviser on the National Security Council in the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations
* Rudy Giuliani, former mayor of New York City
* Janet Reno, former attorney general
* Sibel Edmonds, former FBI translator

President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, former president Bill Clinton, and former vice president Al Gore all gave private testimony. President Bush and Vice President Cheney insisted on testifying together and not under oath, while Clinton and Gore met with the panel separately. As National Security Advisor, Condoleezza Rice claimed that she was not required to testify under oath because the position of national security advisor is an advisory role, independent of authority over a bureaucracy and does not require confirmation by the Senate. Legal scholars disagree on the legitimacy of her claim. Eventually, Rice testified publicly and under oath.

==Report==
The commission issued its final report, the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, on July 22, 2004. After its release, 9/11 Commission chair Thomas Kean declared that both presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush were &quot;not well served&quot; by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency. The commission interviewed over 1,200 people in 10 countries and reviewed over two and a half million pages of documents, including some closely guarded classified national security documents. Before it was released by the commission, the final public report was screened for any potentially classified information and edited as necessary.

The commission later released several supplemental reports on the terrorists&#x27; financing, travel, and other matters.

==Findings and responses==
===NORAD falsehoods===
John Farmer Jr., senior counsel to the 9/11 Commission, stated that the 9/11 Commission, &quot;discovered that... what government and military officials had told Congress, the Commission, the media, and the public about who knew what when— was almost entirely, and inexplicably, untrue.&quot; Farmer said, &quot;At some level of the government, at some point in time, a decision was made not to tell the truth about the national response to the attacks on the morning of 9/11... The [NORAD] tapes told a radically different story from what had been told to us and the public.&quot; Thomas Kean, the head of the 9/11 Commission, concurred, saying, &quot;We to this day don&#x27;t know why NORAD told us what they told us, it was just so far from the truth.&quot;

===CIA withheld information===
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director George Tenet misled the commission and was &quot;obviously not forthcoming&quot; in his testimony to the commission, according to commission chair Thomas Kean. An FBI agent named Doug Miller had been working inside Bin Laden Issue Station, a unit of the CIA dedicated to tracking the activities of Osama bin Laden and his associates. By the spring of 2000, the Bin Laden Issue Station learned that Khalid al-Mihdhar, a Saudi national who was an al-Qaeda member, and Nawaf al-Hazmi, another Saudi who at that time was a suspected al-Qaeda operative, had entered the U.S. and were living under their own names in southern California. 

Miller wanted to inform the FBI of their entry and presence in the U.S., but the CIA blocked Miller&#x27;s efforts to do so. Miller&#x27;s contemporaneous draft cable to the FBI reporting on this, which the CIA prevented Miller from sending at the time, was found much later. Al-Mihdhar and al-Hazmi were both hijackers of American Airlines Flight 77. The CIA then failed to reveal to the commission that over a year before the attack, it had been tracking the two hijackers&#x27; entry into and whereabouts inside the United States. Co-chair Kean believes the CIA&#x27;s failure to be forthcoming with this information to the commission was deliberate, not a mistake, saying: &quot;Oh, it wasn&#x27;t careless oversight. It was purposeful. No question about that in my mind... In the DNA of these organizations was secrecy.&quot;

==Criticism==

The commission was criticized for alleged conflicts of interest on the part of commissioners and staff, including those of Philip D. Zelikow, the commission&#x27;s executive director who co-authored a book with Condoleezza Rice. The commission&#x27;s final report, the &quot;9/11 Commission Report&quot;, has been the subject of criticism by both commissioners themselves and by others.

==Legacy==
Months after the commission had officially issued its report and ceased its functions, Thomas Kean, the commission&#x27;s chair, and other commissioners toured the country to draw attention to the recommendations of the commission for reducing the terror risk, claiming that some of their recommendations were being ignored. Kean and vice-chair Lee Hamilton wrote a book about the constraints they faced as commissioners, titled &quot;Without Precedent: The Inside Story of the 9/11 Commission&quot;.

The book was released on August 15, 2006, and chronicles the work of Kean and Hamilton on the commission. In the book, Kean and Hamilton charge that the 9/11 Commission was &quot;set up to fail,&quot; and write that the commission was so frustrated with repeated misstatements by officials from the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration during the investigation that it considered a separate investigation into possible obstruction of justice by Pentagon and FAA officials.
