<text>Bad Nieuweschans (; ; ; also Lange Akkeren) is a village in the north-eastern Netherlands on the border with Germany. It forms part of the municipality of Oldambt. Nieuweschans means &quot;new fortification (sconce)&quot;. In 2009, the word Bad (&quot;spa&quot;) was prefixed to the name of the village to promote it as a tourist destination.

== History ==

Bad Nieuweschans is located in a part of the Dollart which was flooded during the 13th century. In the 1550s, the Dollart was reclaimed by large-scale poldering. In 1626, the area around Oudeschans was poldered, and a settlement appeared in the Nieuwenschans area which was originally called &quot;Lange Akkeren&quot;.

The fortification of Nieuweschans was built in 1628, during the Eighty Years&#x27; War. The sconce was a pentagon surrounded by earthen walls and canals. The fortification was still in use during the French occupation. In 1815, the garrison was disbanded, and between 1870 and 1907, the fortifications were dismantled.

In 1974, Bad Nieuweschans was declared a protected site, and large scale restoration of the village started. In 1985, , a spa, was established after the discovery of mineral water at a depth of .

Nieuweschans was a separate municipality until 1990, when it became a part of the municipality of Reiderland. In April 2009, the municipality of Reiderland changed the name from &quot;Nieuweschans&quot; to &quot;Bad Nieuweschans&quot;, to promote the town as a spa. On 1 January 2010, Reiderland in turn became a part of the municipality of Oldambt.

== Geography ==
Bad Nieuweschans is located in the municipality of Oldambt in the east of the province of Groningen in the northeast of the Netherlands.

Close to the village is the easternmost point of the Netherlands on the border with Germany.

It is located about 10 km east of Winschoten.

==Transportation==
The Bad Nieuweschans railway station is located on the Harlingen–Nieuweschans and Ihrhove–Nieuweschans railways in the north-east of the village. The railway station opened in 1869, however the connection to Hamburg took another eight years. Georges Simenon&#x27;s novel &quot;Maigret and the Hundred Gibbets&quot; starts in the railway station.

Bad Nieuweschans served as the main border crossing between Groningen and Hamburg. Traffic had to pass through the village which often caused long traffic jams during the holidays. An international motorway was planned which would pass Bad Nieuweschans to the south on German soil. In 1963, the border between the Netherlands and Germany was modified. The new border was established south of the planned road, and the construction could begin. On 30 April 1969, the A7 opened, however it was still a single lane road, and construction in Germany had not started. In April 1993, the A7 was finally upgraded to motorway standards, and in October 1994, the A280 opened in Germany.

<text>Stavoren (; ; previously Staveren) is a city in the province of Friesland, Netherlands, on the coast of the IJsselmeer, about 5 km (3.1 mi) south of Hindeloopen, in the municipality of Súdwest-Fryslân.

Stavoren had a population of 950 in January 2017. It is one of the stops on the Elfstedentocht (English: &quot;eleven cities tour&quot;), an ice skating contest that occurs when the winter temperatures provide safe conditions. A ferry for pedestrians and cyclists operates between Stavoren and Enkhuizen, with increased frequency during summer months. The Friese Kustpad, a 131 kilometres (81 miles) long-distance trail to Lauwersoog, begins in Stavoren.

==History==

The historical Stavoren was granted city rights between 1060 and 1067, making it the oldest city in Friesland. It is mentioned in early texts as the burial place of the early kings of Friesland, including the first Christian king Adgil II (d. 730), who was a son of Redbad, the last pagan king who lived from about 670 to 719. Stavoren was the site of a memorable battle on 26 September 1345 where the count of Holland William IV &quot;the Bold&quot; lost his life.
Stavoren began to decline in the late Middle Ages after a sandbank formed outside the harbour, blocking ships from entering and exiting. The appearance of the sandbank is the topic of the Dutch Renaissance folk-tale of the Lady of Stavoren. In 1657, the entire town was submerged in a great flood.

Before 2011, the city was part of the Nijefurd municipality and before 1984 Stavoren was an independent municipality.

==Notable people==
Notable people from Stavoren include:
* Andreas Cornelius (died 1589), musician and historian
* Bendiks Cazemier (born 1931), politician
* Bernhard van Haersma Buma (1932–2020), politician and writer
* Marijke ten Cate (born 1974), illustrator
* Age Hains Boersma (born 1982), football player

<doc id="352677" wikidata="Q61706" url="?curid=352677" title="Jan-Carl Raspe">
<text>Jan-Carl Raspe (24 July 1944 – 18 October 1977) was a member of the German militant group, the Red Army Faction (RAF).

==Early life==
Raspe was born in Seefeld in Tirol (then Germany, now Austria). He was described as gentle but had difficulty communicating with other people. His father, a businessman, died before his birth and Raspe and his two older sisters were raised by his mother and two aunts. Although living in East Berlin, he went to West Berlin when the Berlin Wall was built in 1961, and stayed there, living with his uncle and aunt. He co-founded Kommune II in 1967 and joined the Red Army Faction, also known as the &quot;Baader-Meinhof Group&quot;, in 1970.

==Militancy==

On 1 June 1972, Raspe along with Andreas Baader and Holger Meins had gone to check on a garage in Frankfurt where they had been storing materials used to make incendiary devices. Raspe had gone along as the driver (they were driving a Porsche Targa). However, as soon as they arrived at the garage, police began to swarm around the scene. Meins and Baader had already entered the garage and were surrounded but Raspe, who had remained by the car, fired a shot from his gun and tried to run away when he was rushed by police, but to no avail; he was caught and arrested in a nearby garden. Meins and Baader were arrested soon after.

Raspe was convicted on 28 April 1977 and sentenced to life imprisonment. On 18 October 1977, Raspe was found with a gunshot wound in his cell in Stammheim Prison, Stuttgart. He died shortly after being admitted to a hospital. Fellow RAF members and inmates, Baader and Gudrun Ensslin, were found dead in their cells the same morning. Irmgard Möller was found in her cell, wounded after supposedly stabbing herself in the chest, but survived. The official inquiry concluded that this was a collective suicide, but again alternative theories abounded.

== Commando Jan Raspe ==
The Red Army Faction created in 1984 the &quot;Commando Jan Raspe&quot; in solidarity and remembrance of him. The commando parked a car loaded with explosives in front of the NATO School in Oberammergau. The cadres for NATO&#x27;s integrated staff were trained there. The car was noticed and the bomb was defused. RAF said the aim of the action was to eliminate the military there.

<doc id="352685" wikidata="Q213353" url="?curid=352685" title="Cisalpine Republic">
<text>The Cisalpine Republic (; ) was a sister republic or a client state of France in Northern Italy that existed from 1797 to 1799, with a second version until 1802.

==Creation==
After the Battle of Lodi in May 1796, Napoleon Bonaparte organized two states: one to the south of the Po, the Cispadane Republic, and one to the north, the Transpadane Republic. On 19 May 1797, Napoleon transferred the territories of the former Duchy of Modena to Transpadania and, on 12 Messidor (29 June), he decreed the birth of the Cisalpine Republic, creating a Directory for the republic and appointing its ministers. France published the constitution of the new republic on 20 Messidor (7 July), establishing the division of the territory into eleven departments: Adda (Lodi), Alpi Apuane (Massa), Crostolo (Reggio), Lario (Como), Montagna (Lecco), Olona (Milan), Panaro (Modena), Po (Cremona), Serio (Bergamo), Ticino (Pavia), and Verbano (Varese).

The rest of Cispadania was merged into the Cisalpine Republic on 27 July, with the capital of the unified state being Milan. On 1 Brumaire (22 October), Bonaparte announced the union of Valtelline with the Republic, after its secession from the Swiss Three Grey Leagues. Austria acknowledged the new entity in the Treaty of Campoformio of 17 October, gaining in exchange what remained of the Venetian Republic. On 25 Brumaire (15 November), the full international recognition and legality of the new state was ratified by the law governing the final annexation of the conquered territories.

The parliament, composed of two chambers (the &quot;Great Council&quot; and the &quot;Council of the Seniors&quot;), was appointed directly by Napoleon on 1 Frimaire (21 November). He justified this undemocratic action as a necessity of war. New departments joined the eleven original ones and Valtelline in the following months: Benaco (Desenzano) on 11 Ventose (1 March 1798), Mella (Brescia) on 13 Floreal (2 May), Mincio (Mantua) on 7 Prairial (26 May), and five departments of Emilia. The structural phase of the republic was terminated on 14 Fructidor (31 August), when France dismissed all the authorities of the republic, replacing them with a stronger executive power under a new constitution.

==Government==

=== First constitution ===

The institutions of the Cisalpine Republic were very similar to those of France. Its first constitution, adopted on 8 July 1797, was based on the French Constitution of 1795. A five-member directory constituted the executive branch of government. The territory was divided into departments which elected the &quot;judges of peace&quot;, the &quot;magistrates&quot; and the &quot;electors&quot;, one for every 200 people having the right to vote. The latter elected two councils: the &quot;Consiglio dei Seniori&quot; (&quot;Council of the Seniors&quot;) and the &quot;Gran Consiglio&quot; (&quot;Great Council&quot;). The first was initially composed of 40 to 60 members and approved the laws and modifications to the Constitutional Chart. The second initially had from 80 to 120 members and proposed the laws. Both councils discussed treaties, the choice of a Directory, and the determination of tributes. The legislative corps included men like Pietro Verri, Giuseppe Parini and the scientist Alessandro Volta. The electors had to be landowners or wealthy.

The Cisalpine directory was composed of five members and exercised executive power. Directors included local politicians such as Giovanni Galeazzo Serbelloni, the first president, and Francesco Melzi d&#x27;Eril, who would later serve as vice president of the Italian Republic. The Directory chose its secretary and appointed the six ministers: for justice, war, foreign affairs, internal affairs, police, and finance. The supreme authority, however, was the commander of the French troops. The republic also adopted the French Republican Calendar.

Each department had its own local directory of five members, as did communes between 3,000 and 100,000 inhabitants. The biggest communes were divided into municipalities, with a central joint commission to handle the general affairs of the cities. The smallest communes were united in districts with a single municipality, with each commune having its own &quot;municipal agent&quot;.

===Second constitution===
The first constitution did not have a long life. On 14 Fructidor, year VI (31 August 1798), the French ambassador (who was only thirty years old) dismissed the Directory, and the next day he promulgated a new constitution with a stronger executive power.

The departments numbered eleven again, now covering larger geographical areas: Olona (Milan), Alto Po (Cremona), Serio (Bergamo), Adda and Oglio (Morbegno), Mella (Brescia), Mincio (Mantua), Panaro (Modena), Crostolo (Reggio), Reno (Bologna), Basso Po (Ferrara), Rubicone (Forlì). The membership of the local directories was reduced to three, and the municipalities for communes between 3,000 and 10,000 inhabitants were disbanded.

Trouvé appointed the new Directory, which had stronger powers, and a new parliament composed of two councils: the &quot;Anziani&quot; (&quot;Elders&quot;) and the &quot;Giuniori&quot; (&quot;Juniors&quot;). The first was composed of 40 elected members together with the former directors. The second had 80 members.

A new coup d&#x27;état, attempted by French general Guillaume Marie Anne Brune the next autumn, was disavowed by the French Directory on 17 Frimaire (7 December).

==Treaty of alliance==
Formally, the Cisalpine Republic was an independent state allied with France, but the treaty of alliance established the effective subalternity of the new republic to France. The French, in fact, had control over the local police and left an army consisting of 25,000 Frenchmen, financed by the Republic. The Cisalpines were also required to form another army of 35,000 of their own men to take part in French campaigns.

On 4 March 1798, the Directory presented this treaty to the Great Council for ratification. The council did not agree with the terms and delayed taking a decision, but in the end, the French general Berthier compelled acceptance by the members. The Elders, however, refused it from the very beginning, as the new state was unable to finance the requested institutions. Berthier threatened to impose a military government but was later replaced by General Brune. The latter, after replacing some Elders and Juniors, achieved the signing of the treaty on 8 June.

===Relationship with Switzerland===
Due to multiple attempts by the Cisalpine government to annex the Italian-speaking Swiss territories south of the Alps, relations with the Swiss Confederacy were strained. The Cisalpine Republic ended up taking control of Valtellina from the Three Leagues and Campione d&#x27;Italia and annexing them. A Cisalpine attempt to conquer Lugano by surprise failed in 1797.

==Second republic==

After the defeat of France at the Battle of Cassano in April 1799 during the War of the Second Coalition, the republic was occupied by General Suvorov&#x27;s Russian and Austrian forces, which appointed a provisional administration led by the Imperial Commission of the Mantuan Count . They departed only on 30 May 1800, just a few days before the French won the Battle of Marengo.

The Cisalpine Republic was restored by Napoleon on 15 Prairial, year VIII (4 June 1800). On 28 Prairial (17 June), the First Consul appointed an Extraordinary Commission of Government of nine members and a legislative &quot;Consulta&quot;: the final list of the executive and legislative institutions was published on 5 Messidor (24 June). On 16 Messidor (6 July) all the acts issued during the Austrian occupation were annulled, and afterwards, the tricolour flag was restored.

Napoleon&#x27;s new victories gave him a chance to stabilize the political situation in all of northern Italy. On 3 Vendémiaire, year IX (25 September), the powers of the Extraordinary Commission were concentrated in the hands of a more restricted Committee of Government, composed of three members: Giovan Battista Sommariva, Sigismondo Ruga and Francesco Visconti, reflecting the institution of the French Consulate. On 21 Vendémiaire (13 October), owing to the refusal of the escaped King Charles Emmanuel IV of Sardinia to sign a treaty of peace settling the situation of the occupied Piedmont, Napoleon ordered the annexation of Novara to the republic, shifting its western border from the river Ticino to the River Sesia. After the surrender of Austria and the signing of the Treaty of Lunéville on 9 February 1801, the territory of the republic was extended to the east as well, placing the frontier with the Holy Roman Empire on the River Adige without the exceptions agreed in Campo Formio. On 23 Floreal (13 May), the territory of the republic was divided into 12 departments, adding Agogna (Novara), restoring Lario and abolishing Adda-e-Oglio.

On 21 Brumaire, year X (12 November), an Extraordinary Cisalpine Consulta was summoned in Lyon. In January 1802, the Consulta decided to change the name of the State to the Italian Republic, when Napoleon had himself elected president, on 24 January, on the advice of Talleyrand. Two days later, in a scene officially commemorated by Nicolas-André Monsiau, Bonaparte appeared in the Collège de la Trinité of Lyon, attended by Murat, Berthier, Louis Bonaparte, Hortense and Joséphine de Beauharnais, and heard the assembled notables proclaim the Italian Republic. On 21 Pluviôse (10 February), the new constitutional government was proclaimed in Milan by Sommariva and Ruga. The same day, the Gregorian calendar was restored.

<text>In aviation, uncontrolled airspace is airspace in which an Air Traffic Control (ATC) service is not deemed necessary or cannot be provided for practical reasons. It is the opposite of controlled airspace. It is that portion of the airspace that has not been designated as Control Area, Control Zone, Terminal Control Area or Transition Area.

According to the airspace classes set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), the uncontrolled classes of airspace are class F and G.

== Class F ==
Class F (uncontrolled) is rarely encountered in ICAO member-states&#x27; airspace systems. In the UK, it was formerly a hybrid between class E (controlled) and G (uncontrolled) as Advisory Routes (ADRs). In the UK, all airspace previously designated as class F was re-assigned to either class E or G on 13 November 2014.

== Class G ==
Individual countries designate different portions of airspace as class G, e.g. in the UK, airspace above FL660 (Flight Level 660 or 66,000 feet) is uncontrolled and belonging to class G, while in the US, any airspace above FL600 (60,000 feet) is designated as class E and therefore controlled. Similarly, large parts of lower airspace in the UK are uncontrolled while in the US any airspace above 700-1200 feet up to FL145 (14,500 feet), not designated as any other class of airspace (A-D) belongs to class E and is controlled.

== Air traffic control ==
ATC does not exercise any executive authority in uncontrolled airspace, but may provide basic information services to aircraft in radio contact. The aircraft commencing its flight in uncontrolled airspace, and subsequently proceeding into controlled airspace, should obtain clearance from the ATC unit in whose area the controlled part will begin. If a flight starts in controlled airspace but its subsequent portion will be uncontrolled, its clearance should be up to the point at which the controlled portion of the flight terminates. 

Flight in uncontrolled airspace will typically be under VFR. Aircraft operating under IFR should not expect separation from other traffic; however, in certain uncontrolled airspace, this might be provided on an &#x27;as far as is practical&#x27; advisory basis. Controlled flights should not be vectored (directed) by ATC into uncontrolled airspace except for weather avoidance or in an emergency.

<doc id="352691" wikidata="Q874038" url="?curid=352691" title="Deep house">
<text>Deep house is a subgenre of house music that originated in the 1980s, initially fusing elements of Chicago house with the lush chords of 1980s jazz-funk and touches of soul music. Its origins are attributed to the early recordings of Larry Heard (aka Mr. Fingers), including his influential track &quot;Can You Feel It&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Deep house is known for tempos typically from 110 to 125 bpm, muted basslines, spacious use of percussion elements (typically using a Roland TR-909 drum machine), soft keyboard sounds (pads), use of advanced chord structures, ambient mixes, and soulful vocals.

==History==
Deep house was largely pioneered by Chicago producers such as Marshall Jefferson (On the House) and Larry Heard (Mr. Fingers) and with tracks such as &quot;Mystery of Love&quot; (1985) and &quot;Can You Feel It?&quot; (1986); the latter had a similar impact on deep house to that of Derrick May&#x27;s &quot;Strings of Life&quot; (1987) on Detroit techno. The jazzy sound became more common due to the favored use of gentler, more organic (yet still synthesizer based) production and instrument sounds. Author Richie Unterberger has stated that Heard&#x27;s deep house sound moved house music away from its posthuman tendencies back towards the lush, soulful sound of early disco music (particularly that of old Philadelphia International and Salsoul records). &quot;Can You Feel It&quot; became a deep house blueprint; Heard used a Roland Juno-60 synthesizer to create the deep bassline, along with a Roland TR-909 drum machine for the beats.

DJ Ron Trent stated that the term was initially used to describe the DJ work of Frankie Knuckles and Ron Hardy, who departed from a strictly electronic house sound to incorporate eclectic elements like disco, jazz, and underground music.

In the 2000s and 2010s, the genre remained very popular. By around mid/late 2010s, however, the perception of the genre was resulting in a sense that some house music was being labeled &quot;deep&quot; inappropriately, and the term has since been used to encapsulate various types of bassline-driven house music, later named Brazilian bass or slap house, as the genre evolves from its historical origins.

==Artists, DJs and record labels==
For a list of deep house producers and disc jockeys, see: Deep house musicians.

Record labels of the genre include Alleviated Records (Larry Heard), Madhouse Records. Inc (Kerri Chandler), AFTR:HRS, Glasgow Underground, Naked Music, Om Records, Peacefrog Records, Soma, Source, Anjunadeep and Spinnin&#x27; Deep. Examples of deep house albums from artists known from other genres include &quot;The Martyr Mantras&quot; (1990) and &quot;&quot; (1989) from The Style Council.

<text>Fast, Cheap &amp; Out of Control is a 1997 documentary film by filmmaker Errol Morris.

==Summary==
The film profiles four subjects with extraordinary careers: Dave Hoover, a wild-animal tamer; George Mendonça, a topiary gardener at Green Animals Topiary Garden in Portsmouth, Rhode Island; Ray Mendez, an expert on naked mole-rats who has designed an exhibit on the animals for the Philadelphia Zoo; and Rodney Brooks, an MIT scientist who works in robotics. In the interviews with the men, which act as the guiding narration for the film, they discuss their personal lives, what led them to their professions, what challenges they face in their work, and their thoughts about what they see in the future for their careers, their fields, and the world.

==Style==
In &quot;Fast, Cheap &amp; Out of Control&quot;, Morris uses a camera technique he invented which allows the interview subject to maintain eye contact with the interviewer while also looking directly into the camera, seemingly making eye contact with the audience. The invention is called the Interrotron, and Morris uses it in a number of his other films. According to Morris, this invention alters interviews in the sense that &quot;no longer is it the interviewer, the camera, and the subject; with the Interrotron, the conversation is between the camera/interviewer and the subject.&quot;

Morris uses the four main subjects to narrate the film, while displaying more artistic freedom through visual mechanisms. The cinematographer, Robert Richardson, uses many of the same camera techniques he used in Oliver Stone&#x27;s films &quot;JFK&quot; and &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;. In addition to 35 mm cameras, he also uses Super 8 mm film. Some footage was even transferred to video and then filmed again being played &quot;off a low-resolution television set.&quot;

The film also uses footage from other sources, such as movie clips, documentary footage, and cartoons. Hoover&#x27;s idol Clyde Beatty appears via portions of a film (&quot;The Big Cage&quot;, 1933) and serial (&quot;Darkest Africa&quot;, 1936) in which he starred, and there are clips of malicious robots from the serial &quot;Zombies of the Stratosphere&quot; (1952).

After using the first moments in the film to establish the characters one by one with film clips that correspond to each subject, Morris then begins to mix footage relating to one subject with the narration of another in order to establish themes shared by the different subjects.

Morris said that &quot;The multiple [film and video] formats make you aware of imagery as imagery, but I can&#x27;t imagine this film without the narration by the characters. The ideas come from the relation between what is being said and what is being seen. If there isn&#x27;t a connection, it doesn&#x27;t work -- and I can testify to this from empirical knowledge gathered in an editing room.&quot; Morris credited his editor, Karen Schmeer, with &quot;saving&quot; the film. The day after she died, he wrote on Twitter: &quot;An extraordinary editor makes possible something that would not have been possible without them. Karen Schmeer was an extraordinary editor.&quot;

==Background==
Morris&#x27; initial intention for the film was to create a profile-based film with no clear relation between its subjects. This was in contrast to his previous films, in which the interview subjects were related by events, like in &quot;Gates of Heaven&quot; and &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;, or place of residency, like in &quot;Vernon, Florida&quot;.

The title of the film is a play on the old engineer&#x27;s adage that, out of &quot;fast&quot;, &quot;cheap&quot;, and &quot;reliable&quot;, you can only produce an end consumer product that is two of those three (the classic example is a car). Brooks, the robot scientist in the film, published a paper in the &quot;Journal of the British Interplanetary Society&quot; in 1989 titled &quot;Fast, Cheap and Out of Control: A Robot Invasion of the Solar System&quot;. In it, he speculated that it might be more effective to send one hundred one-kilogram robots into space instead of a single hundred-kilogram robot, replacing the need for reliability with chance and sheer numbers, as systems in nature have learned to do. The advantage would be that, if a single robot malfunctioned or got destroyed, there would still be plenty of other working robots to do the exploring.

In a profile of Morris, Roger Ebert wrote that if he had to describe the film, he&#x27;d &quot;say it&#x27;s about people who are trying to control things--to take upon themselves the mantle of God.&quot; Morris agrees that &quot;There is a Frankenstein element. They&#x27;re all involved in some very odd inquiry about life...There&#x27;s something mysterious in each of the stories, something melancholy as well as funny. And there&#x27;s an edge of mortality. For the end of the movie I showed the gardener clipping the top of his camel, clipping in a heavenly light, and then walking away in the rain. You know that this garden is not going to last much longer than the gardener&#x27;s lifetime.&quot; Morris dedicated the movie to his mother and stepfather, who had recently died.

Another theme is communication: Morris quotes Mendez as saying that &quot;he&#x27;s seeking some kind of connection with `the other,&#x27; which he defines as that which exists completely independent of ourselves. And then he talks about looking into the eye of a naked mole rat and thinking, &quot;I know you are, you know I am&quot;. It occurred to me that all of my movies are about language. About how language reveals secrets about people. It&#x27;s a way into their heads.&quot;

==Reception==
The film received positive reviews from critics including Roger Ebert and A. O. Scott. On Rotten Tomatoes, it holds a rating of 91% based on 33 reviews. Several critics called it one of the best films of 1997. Ebert wrote that &quot;Errol Morris has long since moved out of the field of traditional documentary. Like his subjects, he is arranging the materials of life according to his own notions. They control shrubs, lions, robots and rats, and he controls them. &quot;Fast, Cheap &amp; Out of Control&quot; doesn&#x27;t fade from the mind the way so many assembly line thrillers do. Its images lodge in the memory. To paraphrase the old British beer ad, Errol Morris refreshes the parts the others do not reach.&quot;

==Soundtrack==
The film&#x27;s musical score was composed Caleb Sampson and performed by the Alloy Orchestra. It is characterized as circus-like, sometimes frenzied or haunting, and features percussion (particularly mallets and xylophones) to give it a metallic, technological or futuristic flavor. A theme from the score appeared on Leonard Maltin&#x27;s &quot;Critic&#x27;s Choice Best Movie Themes of the 90s&quot; compilation soundtrack.

The film is available on VHS and DVD, while the soundtrack is available on CD.

<text>Oscar Kjellberg (21 September 1870 – 5 July 1931) was a Swedish inventor and industrialist. He founded Elektriska Svetsnings-Aktiebolaget (ESAB) in 1904 and Kjellberg Finsterwalde in 1922. He invented the coated electrode used in manual metal arc welding (Swedish Patent: 27152, June 29, 1907), by dipping a bare iron wire in a thick mixture of carbonates and silicates. The purpose of the coating is to generate a fume cloud that protects the molten metal from reacting with the oxygen and nitrogen (as is present in the ambient atmosphere) during the brief period of time that the metal requires to cool and solidify. His pioneering work in covered electrode development paved the road during the next twenty years in the research of reliable flux-coated welding electrodes.

<doc id="352695" wikidata="Q694187" url="?curid=352695" title="Reichsgau Wartheland">
<text>The Reichsgau Wartheland (initially Reichsgau Posen, also Warthegau) was a Nazi German &quot;Reichsgau&quot; formed from parts of Polish territory annexed in 1939 during World War II. It comprised the region of Greater Poland and adjacent areas. Parts of &quot;Warthegau&quot; matched the similarly named pre-Versailles Prussian province of Posen. The name was initially derived from the capital city, Posen (Poznań), and later from the main river, Warthe (Warta).

During the Partitions of Poland from 1793, the bulk of the area had been annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia until 1807 as South Prussia. From 1815 to 1849, the territory was within the autonomous Grand Duchy of Posen, which was the Province of Posen until Poland was re-established in 1918–1919 following World War I. The area is currently the Greater Poland Voivodeship.

==Establishment and administration==
After the German invaded Poland in September 1939, the German Reich occupied the whole of the Greater Poland area - the erstwhile Polish Poznań Voivodeship - and split the territory between four &quot;Reichsgaue&quot; and the General Government area (further east). The &quot;Militärbezirk Posen&quot; was created in September 1939; in accordance with a decree of 8 October 1939, Germany annexed it on 26 October 1939 as the &quot;Reichsgau Posen&quot;.
SS Arthur Greiser became on 21 October. He would remain in this post until the end of the war in 1945. Reichsgau Posen was renamed &quot;Reichsgau Wartheland&quot; on 29 January 1940.

In the new Reichsgau Posen the established XXI, based at Poznań (), under the command of Walter Petzel. Its primary operational unit was the 48th Panzer Korps, covering so-called including Posen (), Lissa (), Hohensalza (), Leslau (), Kalisch (), and Litzmannstadt (). It maintained training areas at Sieradz and Biedrusko. It also maintained the four main prisoner-of-war camps in the province, i.e. Stalag XXI-A in Ostrzeszów, Stalag XXI-B in Szubin, Stalag XXI-C in Wolsztyn and Stalag XXI-D in Poznań, which housed Polish, French, British, Dutch, Belgian, Serbian, Italian, Soviet, American, Norwegian, Moroccan, Algerian and French Sudanese prisoners of war.

==Nazi crimes and German colonization==

The territory of the Reichsgau was inhabited predominantly by ethnic Poles, by German settlers (a minority of 16.7% in 1921), and by Polish Jews. The Polish population was subjected to various crimes, including the &quot;Intelligenzaktion&quot; genocidal campaign. On 20–23 October 1939 alone, the German police and &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot; VI carried out mass public executions of some 300 Poles in various towns in the region, i.e. Gostyń, Kostrzyn, Kościan, Kórnik, Krobia, Książ Wielkopolski, Leszno, Mosina, Osieczna, Poniec, Śmigiel, Śrem, Środa and Włoszakowice, to terrorize and pacify the Poles. During &quot;Aktion T4&quot;, the &quot;SS-Sonderkommandos&quot; gassed over 2,700 mentally ill people from the psychiatric hospitals in Owińska, Dziekanka and Kościan.

Most of the Jewish residents were eventually imprisoned at the Łódź Ghetto (officially established in December 1939) and exterminated at Chełmno extermination camp (, operational from December 1941 onwards). From 1940, the occupiers also operated several forced labour camps for Jews in the region. Due to poor feeding and sanitary conditions, epidemics spread in those camps, which, combined with frequent executions, led to a high mortality rate. On the order of Heinrich Himmler, most of the camps were dissolved in 1943, and its surviving prisoners were sent to ghettos and death camps.
The Gauleiter and Reichsstatthalter of Reichsgau Wartheland, native-born Arthur Greiser, embarked on a program of complete removal of the formerly Polish citizenry upon his nomination by Heinrich Himmler. The plan also entailed the re-settling of ethnic Germans from the Baltic and other regions into farms and homes formerly owned by Poles and Jews. He also authorized the clandestine operation of exterminating 100,000 Polish Jews (about one-third of the total Jewish population of &quot;Wartheland&quot;), in the process of the region&#x27;s complete &quot;Germanization&quot;. In the first year of World War II, some 630,000 Poles and Jews were forcibly removed from &quot;Wartheland&quot; and transported to the occupied General Government (more than 70,000 from Poznań alone) in a series of operations called the &quot;Kleine Planung&quot; covering most Polish territories annexed by Germany at about the same time.
Both Poles and Jews had their property confiscated.

By the end of 1940, some 325,000 Poles and Jews from the &quot;Wartheland&quot; and the so-called Polish Corridor were expelled to General Government, often forced to abandon most of their belongings. Fatalities were numerous. Many Poles were also enslaved as forced labour and either sent to forced labour camps or German colonists in the region or deported to Germany and other German-occupied countries. In 1941, the Nazis expelled a further 45,000 people, and from autumn of that year, they began killing Jews by shooting and in gas vans, at first spasmodically and experimentally. Reichsgau Wartheland had the population: 4,693,700 by 1941. Greiser wrote in November 1942: &quot;I myself do not believe that the Führer needs to be asked again in this matter, especially since at our last discussion with regard to the Jews he told me that I could proceed with these according to my own judgement.&quot;
There were numerous camps and prisons in the province, including a subcamp of the Gross-Rosen concentration camp in Owińska, and a subcamp of the Stutthof concentration camp in Obrzycko. Particularly notorious camps and prisons included the Fort VII concentration camp in Poznań, the Radogoszcz prison in Łódź, a prison camp in Żabikowo, where mostly Poles were imprisoned, but also Luxembourgers, Dutch, Hungarians, Slovaks, Americans, Russians and deserters from the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;, and many were tortured and executed, and the prison in Sieradz, whose mostly Polish and Jewish prisoners were subjected to insults, beatings, forced labour, tortures, executions, and were even given meals prepared from rotten vegetables, spoiled fish and dead dogs, thus often dying of exhaustion, starvation or torture.

Over 270,000 Polish children aged 10–18 were subjected to forced labour in the region of Greater Poland, which, in addition to German profits of 500 million marks, was aimed at the children&#x27;s biological destruction. In Łódź, the occupiers operated a racial research camp for expelled Poles, and a concentration camp for kidnapped Polish children of two to 16 years of age from various parts of occupied Poland. In the racial research camp, Poles were subjected to racial selection before deportation to forced labour in Germany, and Polish children were taken from their parents and sent to Germanisation camps. The camp for kidnapped children served as a forced labour, penal and internment camp and racial research center, with the children subjected to starvation, exhausting labour, beating even up to death and diseases, and the camp was nicknamed &quot;little Auschwitz&quot; due to its conditions. Germanisation camps for Polish children taken away from their parents were operated in Kalisz, Poznań, Puszczykowo and Zaniemyśl. The children were given new German names and surnames, and were punished for any use of the Polish language, even with death. After their stay in the camps, the children were deported to Germany; only some returned to Poland after the war, while the fate of many remains unknown to this day.

==Polish resistance==
The Polish resistance movement was active in the region, including the Union of Armed Struggle, Bataliony Chłopskie, Gray Ranks and Home Army. The Polish Underground State was organized, and in July 1940, even an underground Polish parliament was established in Poznań. Activities included secret Polish schooling, secret Catholic services, printing and distribution of Polish underground press, sabotage actions, espionage of German activity, military trainings, production of false documents, preparations for a planned uprising, and even secret football games. The Polish resistance provided aid to people in need, including prisoners, escapees from camps and ghettos and deserters from the German army, rescued Polish children kidnapped by the Germans, and facilitated escapes of Allied prisoners of war from German POW camps. The Germans cracked down on the resistance several times, and even kidnapped children of the resistance members and sent them to the camp for Polish children in Łódź.

==End of war==
From August 1944 to January 1945, the Germans used hundreds of thousands of Poles as forced labour to build fortifications in the region ahead of the advancing Eastern Front. In January 1945, before and during their retreat, the Germans committed several further massacres of Polish civilians, prisoners and Polish and other Allied POWs, including at Ostrzeszów, Pleszew, Marchwacz, Żabikowo and Łomnica and perpetrated several death marches.

By 1945 nearly half a million Germanic &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; had been resettled in the &quot;Warthegau&quot; alone among the areas annexed by Germany while the Soviet forces began to push the retreating German forces back through the Polish lands. Most German residents along with over a million colonists fled westward. Some did not, due to restrictions by Germany&#x27;s own government and the quickly advancing Red Army. An estimated 50,000 refugees died from the severe winter conditions, others as war atrocities committed by the Soviet military. The remaining ethnically German population was expelled to Allied-occupied Germany after the war ended in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement.

<doc id="352697" wikidata="Q11833539" url="?curid=352697" title="Radical Republicans">
<text>The Radical Republicans were a political faction within the Republican Party originating from the party&#x27;s founding in 1854—some six years before the Civil War—until the Compromise of 1877, which effectively ended Reconstruction. They called themselves &quot;Radicals&quot; because of their goal of immediate, complete, and permanent eradication of slavery in the United States. The Radical faction also included, though, very strong currents of nativism, anti-Catholicism, and in favor of the prohibition of alcoholic beverages. These policy goals and the rhetoric in their favor often made it extremely difficult for the Republican Party as a whole to avoid alienating large numbers of American voters of Irish Catholic, German, and other White ethnic backgrounds. In fact, even German-American Freethinkers and Forty-Eighters who, like Hermann Raster, otherwise sympathized with the Radical Republicans&#x27; aims, fought them tooth and nail over prohibition. They later became known as &quot;Stalwarts&quot;.

The Radicals were opposed during the war by the Moderate Republicans (led by President Abraham Lincoln), and by the Democratic Party. Radicals led efforts after the war to establish civil rights for former slaves and fully implement emancipation. After unsuccessful measures in 1866 resulted in violence against former slaves in the former rebel states, Radicals pushed the Fourteenth Amendment for statutory protections through Congress. They opposed allowing ex-Confederate politicians and military veterans to retake political power in the Southern U.S., and emphasized equality, civil rights and voting rights for the &quot;freedmen&quot;, i.e., former slaves who had been freed during or after the Civil War by the Emancipation Proclamation and the Thirteenth Amendment.

During the war, Radicals opposed Lincoln&#x27;s initial selection of General George B. McClellan for top command of the major eastern Army of the Potomac and Lincoln&#x27;s efforts in 1864 to bring seceded Southern states back into the Union as quickly and easily as possible. Lincoln later recognized McClellan as unfit and relieved him of his command. The Radicals tried passing their own Reconstruction plan through Congress in 1864. Lincoln vetoed it, as he was putting his own policy in effect through his power as military commander-in-chief. Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865. Radicals demanded for the uncompensated abolition of slavery, while Lincoln wished instead to partially emulate the British Empire&#x27;s abolition of slavery by financially compensating former slave owners who had remained loyal to the Union. The Radicals, led by Thaddeus Stevens, bitterly fought Lincoln&#x27;s successor, Andrew Johnson. After Johnson vetoed various congressional acts favoring citizenship for freedmen, a much harsher Reconstruction for the defeated South, and other bills he considered unconstitutional, the Radicals attempted to remove him from office through impeachment, which failed by one vote in 1868.

During the Reconstruction period, Radical Republicans supported prolabor legislation, in contrast to conservative Democrats and Liberal Republicans. 
==Radical coalition==
The Radicals were heavily influenced by religious ideals, and many were Protestant reformers who saw slavery as evil and the Civil War as God&#x27;s punishment for slavery.
The term &quot;radical&quot; was in common use in the anti-slavery movement before the Civil War, referring not necessarily to abolitionists, but particularly to Northern politicians strongly opposed to the Slave Power. Many and perhaps a majority had been Whigs, such as William H. Seward, a leading presidential contender in 1860 and Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of State, Thaddeus Stevens of Pennsylvania, as well as Horace Greeley, editor of the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, the leading Radical newspaper. There was movement in both directions: some of the pre-war Radicals (such as Seward) became less radical during the war, while some prewar moderates became Radicals. Some wartime Radicals had been Democrats before the war, often taking pro-slavery positions. They included John A. Logan of Illinois, Edwin Stanton of Ohio, Benjamin Butler of Massachusetts, and Vice President Johnson; Johnson would break with the Radicals after he became president.
The Radicals came to majority power in Congress in the elections of 1866 after several episodes of violence led many to conclude that President Johnson&#x27;s weaker reconstruction policies were insufficient. These episodes included the New Orleans riot and the Memphis riots of 1866. In a pamphlet directed to black voters in 1867, the Union Republican Congressional Committee stated:
The Radicals were never formally organized and there was movement in and out of the group. Their most successful and systematic leader was Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens in the House of Representatives. The Democrats were strongly opposed to the Radicals, but they were generally a weak minority in politics until they took control of the House in the 1874 congressional elections. The &quot;Moderate&quot; and &quot;Conservative&quot; Republican factions usually opposed the Radicals, but they were not well organized. Lincoln tried to build a multi-faction coalition, including Radicals, &quot;Conservatives,&quot; &quot;Moderates&quot; and War Democrats as while he was often opposed by the Radicals, he never ostracized them. Andrew Johnson was thought to be a Radical when he became president in 1865, but he soon became their leading opponent. However, Johnson could not form a cohesive support network. Finally in 1872, the Liberal Republicans, who wanted a return to classical republicanism, ran a presidential campaign and won the support of the Democratic Party for their ticket. They argued that Grant and the Radicals were corrupt and had imposed Reconstruction far too long on the South. They were overwhelmingly defeated in the 1872 election and collapsed as a movement.

On issues not concerned with the destruction of the Confederacy, the eradication of slavery and the rights of Freedmen, Radicals took positions all over the political map. For example, Radicals who had once been Whigs generally supported high tariffs and ex-Democrats generally opposed them. Some men were for hard money and no inflation while others were for soft money and inflation. The argument, common in the 1930s, that the Radicals were primarily motivated by a desire to selfishly promote Northeastern business interests, has seldom been argued by historians for a half-century. On foreign policy issues, the Radicals and moderates generally did not take distinctive positions.

==Wartime==

After the 1860 elections, moderate Republicans dominated the Congress. Radical Republicans were often critical of Lincoln, who they believed was too slow in freeing slaves and supporting their legal equality. Lincoln put all factions in his cabinet, including Radicals like Salmon P. Chase (Secretary of the Treasury), whom he later appointed Chief Justice, James Speed (Attorney General) and Edwin M. Stanton (Secretary of War). Lincoln appointed many Radical Republicans, such as journalist James Shepherd Pike, to key diplomatic positions. Angry with Lincoln, in 1864 some Radicals briefly formed a political party called the Radical Democracy Party, with John C. Frémont as their candidate for president, until Frémont withdrew. An important Republican opponent of the Radical Republicans was Henry Jarvis Raymond. Raymond was both editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; and also a chairman of the Republican National Committee. In Congress, the most influential Radical Republicans were U.S. Senator Charles Sumner and U.S. Representative Thaddeus Stevens. They led the call for a war that would end slavery.

==Reconstruction policy==
===Opposing Lincoln===

The Radical Republicans opposed Lincoln&#x27;s terms for reuniting the United States during Reconstruction (1863), which they viewed as too lenient. They proposed an &quot;ironclad oath&quot; that would prevent anyone who supported the Confederacy from voting in Southern elections, but Lincoln blocked it and once Radicals passed the Wade–Davis Bill in 1864, Lincoln vetoed it. The Radicals demanded a more aggressive prosecution of the war, a faster end to slavery and total destruction of the Confederacy. After the war, the Radicals controlled the Joint Committee on Reconstruction.

===Opposing Johnson===
After Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, War Democrat Vice President Andrew Johnson became president. Although he appeared at first to be a Radical, he broke with them and the Radicals and Johnson became embroiled in a bitter struggle. Johnson proved a poor politician and his allies lost heavily in the 1866 elections in the North. The Radicals now had full control of Congress and could override Johnson&#x27;s vetoes.

===Control of Congress===
After the 1866 elections, the Radicals generally controlled Congress. Johnson vetoed 21 bills passed by Congress during his term, but the Radicals overrode 15 of them, including the Civil Rights Act of 1866 and four Reconstruction Acts, which rewrote the election laws for the South and allowed blacks to vote while prohibiting former Confederate Army officers from holding office. As a result of the 1867–1868 elections, the newly empowered freedmen, in coalition with carpetbaggers (Northerners who had recently moved south) and Scalawags (white Southerners who supported Reconstruction), set up Republican governments in 10 Southern states (all but Virginia).

===Impeachment===
The Radical plan was to remove Johnson from office, but the first effort at the impeachment trial of President Johnson went nowhere. After Johnson violated the Tenure of Office Act by dismissing Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton, the House of Representatives voted 126–47 to impeach him, but the Senate acquitted him in 1868 in three 35–19 votes, failing to reach the 36 votes threshold required for a conviction; by that time, however, Johnson had lost most of his power.

===Supporting Grant===
General Ulysses S. Grant in 1865–1868 was in charge of the Army under President Johnson, but Grant generally enforced the Radical agenda. The leading Radicals in Congress were Thaddeus Stevens in the House and Charles Sumner in the Senate. Grant was elected president as a Republican in 1868 and after the election he generally sided with the Radicals on Reconstruction policies and signed the Civil Rights Act of 1871 into law.

The Republicans split in 1872 over Grant&#x27;s reelection, with the Liberal Republicans, including Sumner, opposing Grant with a new third party. The Liberals lost badly, but the economy then went into a depression in 1873 and in 1874 the Democrats swept back into power and ended the reign of the Radicals.

The Radicals tried to protect the new coalition, but one by one the Southern states voted the Republicans out of power until in 1876 only three were left (Louisiana, Florida and South Carolina), where the Army still protected them. The 1876 presidential election was so close that it was decided in those three states despite massive fraud and illegalities on both sides. The Compromise of 1877 called for the election of a Republican as president and his withdrawal of the troops. Republican Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew the troops and the Republican state regimes immediately collapsed.

==Reconstruction of the South==

In 1865, Radical Republicans increasingly took control, led by Sumner and Stevens. They demanded harsher measures in the South, more protection for the Freedmen and more guarantees that the Confederate nationalism was eliminated. Following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination in 1865, Andrew Johnson, a former War Democrat, became president.

The Radicals at first admired Johnson&#x27;s hard-line talk. When they discovered his ambivalence on key issues by his veto of Civil Rights Act of 1866, they overrode his veto. This was the first time that Congress had overridden a president on an important bill. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 made African Americans United States citizens, forbade discrimination against them and it was to be enforced in Federal courts. The Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution of 1868 (with its Equal Protection Clause) was the work of a coalition formed of both moderate and Radical Republicans.

By 1866, the Radical Republicans supported federal civil rights for freedmen, which Johnson opposed. By 1867, they defined terms for suffrage for freed slaves and limited early suffrage for many ex-Confederates. While Johnson opposed the Radical Republicans on some issues, the decisive congressional elections of 1866 gave the Radicals enough votes to enact their legislation over Johnson&#x27;s vetoes. Through elections in the South, ex-Confederate officeholders were gradually replaced with a coalition of freedmen, Southern whites (pejoratively called scalawags) and Northerners who had resettled in the South (pejoratively called carpetbaggers). The Radical Republicans were successful in their efforts to impeach President Johnson in the House, but failed by one vote in the Senate to remove him from office.

The Radicals were opposed by former slaveowners and white supremacists in the rebel states. Radicals were targeted by the Ku Klux Klan, who shot to death one Radical Congressman from Arkansas, James M. Hinds.

The Radical Republicans led the Reconstruction of the South. All Republican factions supported Ulysses Grant for president in 1868. Once in office, Grant forced Sumner out of the party and used Federal power to try to break up the Ku Klux Klan organization. However, insurgents and community riots continued harassment and violence against African Americans and their allies into the early 20th century. By the 1872 presidential election, the Liberal Republicans thought that Reconstruction had succeeded and should end. Many moderates joined their cause as well as Radical Republican leader Charles Sumner. They nominated &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; editor Horace Greeley, who was also nominated by the Democrats. Grant was easily reelected.

==End of Reconstruction==
By 1872, the Radicals were increasingly splintered and in the congressional elections of 1874, the Democrats took control of Congress. Many former Radicals joined the &quot;Stalwart&quot; faction of the Republican Party while many opponents joined the &quot;Half-Breeds&quot;, who differed primarily on matters of patronage rather than policy.

In state after state in the South, the so-called Redeemers&#x27; movement seized control from the Republicans until in 1876 only three Republican states were left: South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana. In the intensely disputed 1876 U.S. presidential election, Republican presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes was declared the winner following the Compromise of 1877 (a corrupt bargain): he obtained the electoral votes of those states, and with them the presidency, by committing himself to removing federal troops from those states. Deprived of military support, Reconstruction came to an end. &quot;Redeemers&quot; took over in these states as well. As white Democrats now dominated all Southern state legislatures, the period of Jim Crow laws began, and rights were progressively taken away from blacks. This period would last over 80 years, until the gains made by the Civil Rights Movement.

==Historiography==
In the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction, new battles took place over the construction of memory and the meaning of historical events. The earliest historians to study Reconstruction and the Radical Republican participation in it were members of the Dunning School, led by William Archibald Dunning and John W. Burgess. The Dunning School, based at Columbia University in the early 20th century, saw the Radicals as motivated by an irrational hatred of the Confederacy and a lust for power at the expense of national reconciliation. According to Dunning School historians, the Radical Republicans reversed the gains Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson had made in reintegrating the South, established corrupt shadow governments made up of Northern carpetbaggers and Southern scalawags in the former Confederate states, and to increase their power, foisted political rights on the newly freed slaves that they were allegedly unprepared for or incapable of utilizing. For the Dunning School, the Radical Republicans made Reconstruction a dark age that only ended when Southern whites rose up and reestablished a &quot;home rule&quot; free of Northern, Republican, and black influence.

In the 1930s, the Dunning-oriented approaches were rejected by self-styled &quot;revisionist&quot; historians, led by Howard K. Beale along with W.E.B. DuBois, William B. Hesseltine, C. Vann Woodward and T. Harry Williams. They downplayed corruption and stressed that Northern Democrats were also corrupt. Beale and Woodward were leaders in promoting racial equality and re-evaluated the era in terms of regional economic conflict. They were also hostile towards the Radicals, casting them as economic opportunists. They argued that apart from a few idealists, most Radicals were scarcely interested in the fate of the blacks or the South as a whole. Rather, the main goal of the Radicals was to protect and promote Northern capitalism, which was threatened in Congress by the West; if the Democrats took control of the South and joined the West, they thought, the Northeastern business interests would suffer. They did not trust anyone from the South except men beholden to them by bribes and railroad deals. For example, Beale argued that the Radicals in Congress put Southern states under Republican control to get their votes in Congress for high protective tariffs.

The role of Radical Republicans in creating public school systems, charitable institutions, and other social infrastructure in the South was downplayed by the Dunning School of historians. Since the 1950s, the impact of the moral crusade of the civil rights movement led historians to reevaluate the role of Radical Republicans during Reconstruction, and their reputation improved. These historians, sometimes referred to as neoabolitionist because they reflected and admired the values of the abolitionists of the 19th century, argued that the Radical Republicans&#x27; advancement of civil rights and suffrage for African Americans following emancipation was more significant than the financial corruption which took place. They also pointed to the African Americans&#x27; central, active roles in reaching toward education (both individually and by creating public school systems) and their desire to acquire land as a means of self-support.

Democrats retook power across the South and held it for decades, restricting African American voters and largely extinguishing their voting rights over the years and decades following Reconstruction. In 2004, Richardson argued that Northern Republicans came to see most blacks as potentially dangerous to the economy because they might prove to be labor radicals in the tradition of the 1871 Paris Commune or Great Railroad Strike of 1877 and other violent American strikes of the 1870s. Meanwhile, it became clear to Northerners that the white South was not bent on revenge or the restoration of the Confederacy. Most of the Republicans who felt this way became opponents of Grant and entered the Liberal Republican camp in 1872.

<text>Shah Rukh Khan (; born 2 November 1965), also known by the initialism SRK, is an Indian actor and film producer who works in Hindi cinema. Referred to in the media as the &quot;Baadshah of Bollywood&quot; and &quot;King Khan&quot;, he has appeared in more than 100 films, and earned numerous accolades, including 14 Filmfare Awards. He has been awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India, as well as the Order of Arts and Letters and Legion of Honour by the Government of France. Khan has a significant following in Asia and the Indian diaspora worldwide. In terms of audience size and income, several media outlets have described him as one of the most successful film stars in the world. Many of his films thematise Indian national identity and connections with diaspora communities, or gender, racial, social and religious differences and grievances.

Khan began his career with appearances in several television series in the late 1980s and made his Bollywood debut in 1992 with the musical romance &quot;Deewana&quot;. He was initially recognised for playing villainous roles in the films &quot;Baazigar&quot; (1993) and &quot;Darr&quot; (1993). Khan established himself by starring in a series of top-grossing romantic films, including (1995), &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997), &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998), &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; (2000), &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001), &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (2003), &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot; (2004) and &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006). He earned critical acclaim for his portrayal of an alcoholic in the period romantic drama &quot;Devdas&quot; (2002), a NASA scientist in the social drama &quot;Swades&quot; (2004), a hockey coach in the sports drama &quot;Chak De! India&quot; (2007), and a man with Asperger syndrome in the drama &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; (2010). Further commercial successes came with the romances &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; (2007) and &quot;Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi&quot; (2008), and with his expansion to comedies in &quot;Chennai Express&quot; (2013) and &quot;Happy New Year&quot; (2014). Following a brief setback and hiatus, Khan made a career comeback with the 2023 action thrillers &quot;Pathaan&quot; and &quot;Jawan&quot;, both of which rank among the highest-grossing Indian films.

As of 2015, Khan is co-chairman of the motion picture production company Red Chillies Entertainment and its subsidiaries and is the co-owner of the Indian Premier League cricket team Kolkata Knight Riders and the Caribbean Premier League team Trinbago Knight Riders. The media often label him as &quot;Brand SRK&quot; because of his many endorsements and entrepreneurship ventures. He is a frequent television presenter and stage show performer. Khan&#x27;s philanthropic endeavours have provided health care and disaster relief, and he was honoured with UNESCO&#x27;s Pyramide con Marni award in 2011 for his support of children&#x27;s education and the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Crystal Award in 2018 for advocating for women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s rights in India. He regularly features in listings of the most influential people in Indian culture, and in 2008, &quot;Newsweek&quot; named him one of their fifty most powerful people in the world. In 2022, Khan was voted one of the 50 greatest actors of all time in a readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot;, and in 2023, &quot;Time&quot; named him as one of the most influential people in the world.

== Early life and family ==
=== Parents ===
Khan&#x27;s father, Meer Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India. Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and affiliated with the Indian National Congress. He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan. According to Khan his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan. However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan. As of 2010, Khan&#x27;s paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar&#x27;s Qissa Khwani Bazaar.

In 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law at Delhi University. When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi, and did not return to Peshawar until many years later. Khan&#x27;s mother, Lateef Fatima, a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer. His parents were married in 1959.

=== Early life ===
Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi. He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s. Khan has described himself on Twitter as &quot;half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)&quot;.

Khan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of New Delhi. His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments. Khan attended St. Columba&#x27;s School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football, and received the school&#x27;s highest award, the Sword of Honour. Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play. Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Mumtaz. One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress. Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor&#x27;s degree in economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi&#x27;s Theatre Action Group (TAG), where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John. After Hansraj, he began studying for a master&#x27;s degree in mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career. He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.

His father died of cancer in 1981, and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes. After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born 1960) fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her. Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.

== Acting career ==

=== 1988–1992: Television and film debut ===
Khan&#x27;s first starring role was in Lekh Tandon&#x27;s television series &quot;Dil Dariya&quot;, which began shooting in 1988, but production delays led to the Raj Kumar Kapoor directed 1989 series &quot;Fauji&quot; becoming his television debut instead. In the series, which depicted a realistic look at the training of army cadets, he played the leading role of Abhimanyu Rai. This led to further appearances in Aziz Mirza&#x27;s television series &quot;Circus&quot; (1989–90) and Mani Kaul&#x27;s miniseries &quot;Idiot&quot; (1992). Khan also played minor parts in the serials &quot;Umeed&quot; (1989) and &quot;Wagle Ki Duniya&quot; (1988–90), and in the English-language television film &quot;In Which Annie Gives It Those Ones&quot; (1989). His appearances in these serials led critics to compare his look and acting style with those of the film actor Dilip Kumar, but Khan was not interested in film acting at the time, thinking that he was not good enough.

Khan changed his decision to act in films in April 1991, citing it as a way to escape the grief of his mother&#x27;s death. He moved from Delhi to Mumbai to pursue a full-time career in Bollywood and was quickly signed to four films. His first offer was for Hema Malini&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;Dil Aashna Hai&quot;, and by June, he had started his first shoot. His film debut was in &quot;Deewana&quot;, which was released in June 1992. In it he starred alongside Divya Bharti as the second male lead behind Rishi Kapoor. &quot;Deewana&quot; became a box office hit and launched Khan&#x27;s Bollywood career; he earned the Filmfare Best Male Debut Award for his performance. Also released in 1992 were Khan&#x27;s first films as the male lead, &quot;Chamatkar&quot;, &quot;Dil Aashna Hai&quot;, and the comedy &quot;Raju Ban Gaya Gentleman&quot;, which was his first of many collaborations with the actress Juhi Chawla. His initial film roles saw him play characters who displayed energy and enthusiasm. According to Arnab Ray of &quot;Daily News and Analysis&quot;, Khan brought a new kind of acting as he was &quot;sliding down stairs on a slab of ice, cartwheeling, somersaulting, lips trembling, eyes trembling, bringing to the screen the kind of physical energy ... visceral, intense, maniacal one moment and cloyingly boyish the next.&quot;

=== 1993–1994: Negative characters ===
Among his 1993 releases, Khan garnered the most appreciation for portraying villainous roles in two box office hits: a murderer in &quot;Baazigar&quot;, and an obsessive lover in &quot;Darr&quot;. The former, in which Khan played an ambiguous avenger who murders his girlfriend, shocked Indian audiences with an unexpected violation of the standard Bollywood formula. In &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Modern Indian Culture&quot;, Sonal Khullar called the character &quot;the consummate anti-hero&quot;. His performance in &quot;Baazigar&quot;, which would be his first of many appearances with actress Kajol, won Khan his first Filmfare Award for Best Actor. In 2003, the &quot;Encyclopaedia of Hindi Cinema&quot; stated that Khan &quot;defied the image of the conventional hero in both these films and created his own version of the revisionist hero&quot;. &quot;Darr&quot; marked the first of Khan&#x27;s many collaborations with filmmaker Yash Chopra and his company Yash Raj Films. Khan&#x27;s stammering and the use of the phrase &quot;I love you, K-k-k-Kiran&quot; were popular with audiences. Malini Mannath of &quot;The Indian Express&quot; argued that he &quot;walks away with the acting honours in yet another negative role&quot;. For &quot;Darr&quot; he received a nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Performance in a Negative Role, also known as the Best Villain Award, but lost to Paresh Rawal for &quot;Sir&quot;. Also in 1993, Khan performed a nude scene with Deepa Sahi in &quot;Maya Memsaab&quot;, although parts of it were censored by the Central Board of Film Certification. The ensuing controversy prompted him to eschew such scenes in future roles.

In 1994, Khan played a love-struck musician in Kundan Shah&#x27;s comedy-drama film &quot;Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa&quot; opposite Deepak Tijori and Suchitra Krishnamurthy, which he later professed was his favourite role. His performance earned him a Filmfare Critics Award for Best Performance, and in a retrospective review from 2004, Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com referred to it as Khan&#x27;s best performance, calling him &quot;spontaneous, vulnerable, boyish, mischievous and acting straight from the heart&quot;. Also in 1994, Khan won the Filmfare Best Villain Award for his role as an obsessive lover in &quot;Anjaam&quot;, co-starring Madhuri Dixit. At the time, playing antagonistic roles was considered risky to a leading man&#x27;s career in mainstream Hindi cinema. Arnab Ray subsequently credited Khan for taking &quot;insane risks&quot; and &quot;pushing the envelope&quot; by choosing to play such characters, through which he established his career. The director Mukul S. Anand called him &quot;the new face of the industry&quot; at the time.

=== 1995–1998: Romantic roles ===

Khan starred in seven films in 1995, the first of which was Rakesh Roshan&#x27;s melodramatic thriller &quot;Karan Arjun&quot;. Co-starring Salman Khan and Kajol, it became the second-highest-grossing film of the year in India. His most significant release that year was Aditya Chopra&#x27;s directorial debut, the romance &quot;Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge&quot;, in which he played a young Non-resident Indian (NRI) who falls in love with Kajol&#x27;s character during a trip across Europe. Khan was initially reticent to portray the role of a lover, but this film is credited with establishing him as a &quot;romantic hero&quot;. Lauded by both critics and the public, it became the year&#x27;s highest grossing production in India and abroad and was declared an &quot;all time blockbuster&quot; by Box Office India, with an estimated lifetime gross of worldwide. It is the longest-running film in the history of Indian cinema; it is still showing at the Maratha Mandir theatre in Mumbai after more than 1000 weeks as of early 2015. The film won ten Filmfare Awards, including the second of Khan&#x27;s Best Actor Awards. The director and critic Raja Sen said, &quot;Khan gives a fabulous performance, redefining the lover for the 1990s with great panache. He&#x27;s cool and flippant, but sincere enough to appeal to the [audience]. The performance itself is, like the best in the business, played well enough to come across as effortless, as non-acting.&quot;

In 1996, all four of Khan&#x27;s releases failed critically and commercially, but the following year, his starring role opposite Aditya Pancholi and Juhi Chawla in Aziz Mirza&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Yes Boss&quot; earned him accolades that included a Filmfare Best Actor nomination. Later in 1997, he starred in Subhash Ghai&#x27;s diasporic-themed social drama &quot;Pardes&quot;, portraying Arjun, a musician facing a moral dilemma. &quot;India Today&quot; cites it as one of the first major Bollywood pictures to succeed in the United States. Khan&#x27;s final release of 1997 was the second collaboration with Yash Chopra in the popular musical romance &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot;. He portrayed Rahul, a stage director caught in a love triangle between Madhuri Dixit and Karisma Kapoor. The film and his performance met with critical praise, winning Khan his third Best Actor Award at Filmfare.

Khan performed the lead role in three films and made one special appearance in 1998. In his first release of the year, he played a double role opposite Juhi Chawla and Sonali Bendre in Mahesh Bhatt&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Duplicate&quot;, the first of his many collaborations with Yash Johar&#x27;s production company Dharma Productions. The film was not well received, but &quot;India Today&quot; lauded Khan for his energetic performance. The same year, Khan won critical praise for his performance as an All India Radio correspondent who develops an infatuation for a mysterious terrorist (Manisha Koirala) in &quot;Dil Se..&quot;, the third instalment of Mani Ratnam&#x27;s trilogy of terror films. In his final release of the year, he portrayed a college student in Karan Johar&#x27;s romance &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot;, in which he was involved in a love triangle along with Kajol and Rani Mukerji. The writer Anjana Motihar Chandra has referred to the picture as &quot;the&quot; blockbuster of the 1990s, a &quot;pot-pourri of romance, comedy, and entertainment.&quot; Khan won the Best Actor award at the Filmfare Awards ceremony for the second consecutive year, although he and several critics believed his performance to have been overshadowed by that of Kajol.

The roles in this phase of his career, and the series of romantic comedies and family dramas that followed, earned Khan widespread adulation from audiences, particularly teenagers, and according to the author Anupama Chopra, established him as an icon of romance in India. He continued to have frequent professional associations with Yash Chopra, Aditya Chopra, and Karan Johar, who moulded his image and made him into a superstar. Khan became a romantic leading man without ever actually kissing any of his co-stars, although he broke this rule in 2012, after strong urging by Yash Chopra.

=== 1999–2003: Career fluctuations ===
Khan&#x27;s only release in 1999 was &quot;Baadshah&quot;, in which he starred opposite Twinkle Khanna. Although the film underperformed at the box office, it earned him a Filmfare Award nomination for Best Performance in a Comic Role. Khan became a producer in 1999 in a collaboration with the actress Juhi Chawla and the director Aziz Mirza for a production company called Dreamz Unlimited. The company&#x27;s first production, &quot;Phir Bhi Dil Hai Hindustani&quot; (2000), starring Khan and Chawla, was a commercial failure. It was released one week after &quot;Kaho Naa... Pyaar Hai&quot;, starring Hrithik Roshan, then a newcomer, who critics believed overshadowed Khan. Swapna Mitter of Rediff.com spoke of Khan&#x27;s predictable mannerisms, saying &quot;Frankly, it&#x27;s high time he innovated his act a little.&quot; Khan did a supporting role in Kamal Haasan&#x27;s &quot;Hey Ram&quot; (2000), which was made simultaneously in Tamil and Hindi. He thereby made his Tamil debut by playing the role of an archaeologist named Amjad Khan. He performed free of charge as he wanted to work with Haasan. On Khan&#x27;s performance, T. Krithika Reddy of &quot;The Hindu&quot; wrote, &quot;Shah Rukh Khan, as usual comes up with an impeccable performance.&quot;

In 2001, Dreamz Unlimited attempted a comeback with Khan portraying the title role in Santosh Sivan&#x27;s historical epic &quot;Aśoka&quot;, a partly fictionalised account of the life of emperor Ashoka. The film was screened at the Venice Film Festival and the 2001 Toronto International Film Festival to a positive response, but it performed poorly at Indian box offices. As losses continued to mount for the production company, Khan was forced to close srkworld.com, a company that he had started along with Dreamz Unlimited. In December 2001, Khan suffered a spinal injury while performing an action sequence for a special appearance in Krishna Vamsi&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. He was subsequently diagnosed with a prolapsed disc, and attempted multiple alternative therapies. None of these provided a permanent solution to the injury, which caused him severe pain while shooting several of his films. By the beginning of 2003, his condition had worsened to the point that he had to undergo anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery at Wellington Hospital, London. Khan resumed shooting in June 2003, but he reduced his workload and the number of film roles he accepted annually.
Successes during this time included Aditya Chopra&#x27;s &quot;Mohabbatein&quot; (2000), and Karan Johar&#x27;s family drama &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; (2001), which Khan cites as a turning point in his career. Both films co-starred Amitabh Bachchan as an authoritarian figure, and presented ideological struggles between the two men. Khan&#x27;s performances in the films were met with wide public appreciation, and he was awarded his second Filmfare Critics Award for Best Actor for &quot;Mohabbatein&quot;. &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot; remained the top-grossing Indian production of all time in the overseas market for the next five years.

In 2002, Khan played the title role as a rebellious alcoholic opposite Aishwarya Rai and Madhuri Dixit in Sanjay Leela Bhansali&#x27;s period romance &quot;Devdas&quot;. At a cost of over , it was the most expensive Bollywood film ever made at the time, and became a box office success, earning approximately () worldwide. The film earned numerous accolades including 10 Filmfare Awards, with Best Actor for Khan, and a BAFTA Award for Best Film Not in the English Language. Khan next starred in &quot;Kal Ho Naa Ho&quot; (2003), a comedy-drama written by Karan Johar and set in New York City, which became the second-highest-grossing film domestically and the top-grossing Bollywood film in external markets that year. Co-starring with Jaya Bachchan, Saif Ali Khan, and Preity Zinta, Khan received critical praise for his portrayal of Aman Mathur, a man with a fatal heart disease, with critics praising his emotional impact upon audiences. Conflict broke out between Khan and the other partners of Dreamz Unlimited over the failure to cast Juhi Chawla in their 2003 production of Aziz Mirza&#x27;s &quot;Chalte Chalte&quot;, and they parted ways, despite the film&#x27;s success.

=== 2004–2009: Comeback ===
2004 was a critically and commercially successful year for Khan. He transformed Dreamz Unlimited into Red Chillies Entertainment, adding his wife Gauri as a producer. In the company&#x27;s first production, he starred in Farah Khan&#x27;s directorial debut, the masala film &quot;Main Hoon Na&quot;. A fictionalised account of India–Pakistan relations, it was viewed by some commentators as a conscious effort to move away from the stereotypical portrayal of Pakistan as the constant villain. Khan then played an Indian Air Force pilot who falls in love with a Pakistani woman (Preity Zinta) in Yash Chopra&#x27;s romance film &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;, which was screened at the 55th Berlin Film Festival to critical praise. It was the highest earning film of 2004 in India, with a worldwide gross of over , and &quot;Main Hoon Na&quot; was the second-highest earner with .
In his final release of 2004, Khan starred as a NASA scientist who patriotically returns to India to rekindle his roots in Ashutosh Gowariker&#x27;s social drama &quot;Swades&quot; (meaning &quot;Homeland&quot;), which became the first Indian picture to be shot inside the NASA research centre at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Film scholar Stephen Teo refers to the picture as an example of &quot;Bollywoodised realism&quot;, displaying a transcendence in conventional narrative and audience expectation in Hindi cinema. In December 2013, &quot;The Times of India&quot; reported that Khan found filming the picture such an emotionally overwhelming and life-changing experience that he had still not viewed the film. Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; found Khan&#x27;s performance &quot;unsettling&quot; as &quot;a self-satisfied expatriate determined to bring Western values to poor Indian peasants&quot;, but several film critics, including Jitesh Pillai, believed it to have been his finest acting to date. He was nominated for the Filmfare Best Actor Award for all three of his 2004 releases and eventually won the award for &quot;Swades&quot;. &quot;Filmfare&quot; later included his performance in the 2010 issue of Bollywood&#x27;s &quot;Top 80 Iconic Performances&quot;.

In 2005, Khan starred in Amol Palekar&#x27;s fantasy drama, &quot;Paheli&quot;. The film was India&#x27;s submission for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 79th Academy Awards. He later collaborated with Karan Johar for the third time in the musical romantic drama &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; (2006), in which he played an unhappily married man who has an extramarital affair with a married woman. The film, which featured an ensemble cast including Amitabh Bachchan, Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukerji, Preity Zinta and Kirron Kher, emerged as India&#x27;s highest-grossing film in the overseas market, earning more than worldwide. Both his roles in &quot;Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna&quot; and the action film &quot;Don&quot;, a remake of the 1978 film of the same name, earned Khan Best Actor nominations at the Filmfare Awards, despite his performance as the titular character in &quot;Don&quot; being negatively compared to that of Amitabh Bachchan in the original film.
In 2007, Khan portrayed a disgraced hockey player who coached the Indian women&#x27;s national hockey team to World Cup success in Yash Raj Films&#x27; semi-fictional &quot;Chak De! India&quot;. Bhaichand Patel notes that Khan, who had a background in the sport playing for his university&#x27;s hockey team, essentially portrayed himself as a &quot;cosmopolitan, liberal, Indian Muslim&quot;. Faring well in both India and abroad, Khan garnered another Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance, which Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN considers to have been &quot;without any of his typical trappings, without any of his trademark quirks&quot;, portraying Kabir Khan &quot;like a real flesh-and-blood human being&quot;. &quot;Filmfare&quot; included his performance in their 2010 issue of the &quot;Top 80 Iconic Performances&quot;. In the same year, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal, Deepika Padukone and Shreyas Talpade in Farah Khan&#x27;s reincarnation melodrama &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot;, portraying a 1970s junior artiste who is reborn as a 2000s era superstar. The film became the highest grossing Indian motion picture of 2007, both domestically and abroad. &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; earned Khan his second nomination of the year for Best Actor at Filmfare. Khalid Mohammed from &quot;Hindustan Times&quot; wrote, &quot;the enterprise belongs to Shah Rukh Khan, who tackles comedy, high drama and action with his signature stylespontaneous and intuitively intelligent&quot;.

Khan collaborated for the third time with Aditya Chopra on the romantic comedy &quot;Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi&quot; (2008) opposite debutante Anushka Sharma. He played Surinder Sahni, a shy man with low self-esteem, whose love for his young arranged wife (Sharma) causes him to transform himself into Raj, a boisterous alter-ego. Rachel Saltz of &quot;The New York Times&quot; believed the dual role to have been &quot;tailor-made&quot; for Khan, allowing him to display his talents, although Deep Contractor from &quot;Epilogue&quot; thought Khan displayed greater strength in the role of Surinder and weakness in the role of monologue-prone Raj. In December 2008, Khan suffered a shoulder injury while filming a small role in Mudassar Aziz&#x27;s &quot;Dulha Mil Gaya&quot;. He underwent extensive physiotherapy sessions at the time but the pain left him almost immobile and he had arthroscopic surgery in February 2009. He performed a special appearance in the 2009 film &quot;Billu&quot;, playing Bollywood superstar Sahir Khana fictionalised version of himself, wherein he performed musical item numbers with actresses Kareena Kapoor, Priyanka Chopra, and Deepika Padukone. As head of the film&#x27;s production company, Red Chillies, Khan made the call to change the title of the film from &quot;Billu Barber&quot; to &quot;Billu&quot; after hairdressers across the country complained that the word &quot;barber&quot; was derogatory. The company covered up the offending word on billboards that had already been installed with the original title.

=== 2010–2014: Expansion to action and comedy ===
After refusing the role that subsequently went to Anil Kapoor in Danny Boyle&#x27;s &quot;Slumdog Millionaire&quot; (2008), Khan began shooting &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; (2010), his fourth collaboration with director Karan Johar and his sixth with Kajol. The film is based on a true story and set against the backdrop of perceptions of Islam after the 11 September attacks. Khan plays Rizwan Khan, a Muslim suffering from mild Asperger syndrome who sets out on a journey across America to meet the country&#x27;s president, a role that film scholar Stephen Teo sees as a &quot;symbol of assertive rasa values&quot; and another example of Khan representing NRI identity in global Bollywood. To provide an accurate portrayal of a sufferer without disparagement, Khan spent several months researching his role by reading books, watching videos and talking to people affected by the condition. Upon release, &quot;My Name is Khan&quot; became one of the highest grossing Bollywood films of all time outside India, and earned Khan his eighth Filmfare Award for Best Actor, equalling the record for the most wins in the category with Dilip Kumar. Jay Wesissberg from &quot;Variety&quot; noted how Khan portrayed the Asperger&#x27;s sufferer with &quot;averted eyes, springy steps, [and] stuttered repetitions of memorized texts&quot;, believing it to have been a &quot;standout performance sure to receive the Autism Society&#x27;s gold seal of approval&quot;.

In 2011, Khan starred alongside Arjun Rampal and Kareena Kapoor in Anubhav Sinha&#x27;s superhero film &quot;Ra.One&quot;, his first work in this subgenre, as a favour to his children. The film follows the story of a London-based video game designer who creates a villainous character who escapes into the real world. It was billed as Bollywood&#x27;s most expensive production; it had an estimated budget of . Despite negative media coverage of the film&#x27;s box office performance, &quot;Ra.One&quot; was a financial success with a gross of . The film, and Khan&#x27;s portrayal of a dual role, received mixed reviews; while most critics praised his performance as the robotic superhero G.One, they criticised his portrayal of the video game designer Shekhar. Khan&#x27;s second release of 2011 was &quot;Don 2&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Don&quot; (2006). To prepare for his role, Khan exercised extensively as he performed most of the stunts himself. His performance earned him positive reviews from critics; Nikhat Kazmi of &quot;The Times of India&quot; said, &quot;Shah Rukh remains in command and never loses his foothold, neither through the dramatic sequences nor through the action cuts&quot;. The year&#x27;s highest grossing Bollywood production abroad, it was showcased at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.

Khan&#x27;s only release in 2012 was Yash Chopra&#x27;s swan song, the romantic drama &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot;, which saw him once again in a romantic role, starring opposite Katrina Kaif and Anushka Sharma. CNN-IBN considered the overall performance by Khan to have been one of his finest to date, but believed that Khan&#x27;s first screen kiss of his career with Katrina Kaif, twenty years his junior, was an awkward one. &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot; was a moderate financial success earning over worldwide. The film was showcased at the 2012 Marrakech International Film Festival in Morocco, along with &quot;Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham...&quot;, &quot;Veer-Zaara&quot;, and &quot;Don 2&quot;. At the following Zee Cine Awards, Khan performed a tribute to the late Yash Chopra along with Kaif, Sharma, and several of Chopra&#x27;s other past heroines.

In 2013, Khan starred in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Chennai Express&quot; for Red Chillies Entertainment, a film which earned mixed critical reviews and extensive criticism for its perceived disparagement of South Indian culture, though the film included a tribute to Tamil cinema star Rajinikanth. Critic Khalid Mohamed thought that Khan overacted in the film and criticised him for &quot;re-rendering every old trick in the acting book&quot;. Despite the criticism, the film broke many box office records for Hindi films in both India and abroad, surpassing &quot;3 Idiots&quot; to briefly become the highest grossing Bollywood film of all time, with a gross of almost in worldwide ticket sales. On International Women&#x27;s Day in 2013, &quot;The Times of India&quot; reported that Khan had requested a new convention with the name of his lead female co-stars appearing above his own in the credits. He claimed that the women in his life, including his co-stars, have been the reason for his success. In 2014, the actor was featured in Farah Khan&#x27;s ensemble action comedy &quot;Happy New Year&quot;, which co-starred Deepika Padukone, Abhishek Bachchan and Boman Irani; his third collaboration with the director. Although Khan&#x27;s unidimensional character was criticised, the film became a major commercial success grossing worldwide.

=== 2015–2022: Career setbacks and hiatus ===

Khan next appeared alongside Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sanon in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s action comedy &quot;Dilwale&quot; (2015). The film garnered mixed reviews, though it was financially profitable with a gross of . Namrata Joshi of &quot;The Hindu&quot; commented, &quot;With &quot;Dilwale&quot;, Rohit Shetty goes hopelessly wrong despite much that he had at his disposal, including a power-packed cast and producer&quot;, and felt that the attempt to repackage Khan and Kajol had backfired. He then took on dual parts of a superstar and his doppelgänger fan in Maneesh Sharma&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Fan&quot; (2016). Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; considered the film to be &quot;exhausting, bizarre yet watchable&quot; and thought that Khan was aptly &quot;creepy&quot; as the obsessive admirer. The film underperformed at the box office, and trade journalists attributed this failure to the film&#x27;s non-conformity to mainstream formula. Later that year, Khan portrayed the supporting part of a therapist to an aspiring cinematographer (Alia Bhatt) in Gauri Shinde&#x27;s coming-of-age film &quot;Dear Zindagi&quot;.

In Rahul Dholakia&#x27;s action crime film &quot;Raees&quot; (2017), Khan took on the part of the titular anti-heroa bootlegger turned mobster in 1980s Gujarat. In a typical mixed review, Pratim D. Gupta of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; thought Khan&#x27;s performance to be &quot;inconsistent, intense and power-packed at times, but often slipping out of character into his usual mix of stock mannerisms&quot;. Commercially, the film was a modest success, earning about worldwide. Khan returned to the romantic genre with the role of a tourist guide who falls in love with a traveller (Anushka Sharma) in Imtiaz Ali&#x27;s &quot;Jab Harry Met Sejal&quot; (2017). In a review for &quot;Mint&quot;, Uday Bhatia criticised Khan&#x27;s pairing with Sharma, 22 years his junior, writing that Khan had performed &quot;similar gestures of love decades ago to actors his own age&quot;. He reunited with Sharma and Katrina Kaif in Aanand L Rai&#x27;s romantic drama &quot;Zero&quot; (2018), in which he played Bauua Singh, a dwarf involved in a love triangle. The film received mixed reviews with praise directed to Khan&#x27;s performance. Writing for &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, Raja Sen commended his &quot;dominating performance and tremendous energy&quot; and Anna M. M. Vetticad of &quot;Firstpost&quot; called him an &quot;excellent fit&quot; for the role for allowing his &quot;naturally energetic personality, comic timing and charm to take flight&quot;. Both &quot;Jab Harry Met Sejal&quot; and &quot;Zero&quot; were box office flops.

According to a &quot;Box Office India&quot; report, Khan&#x27;s stardom was impacted by his films failing to do well. Following the release of &quot;Zero&quot;, Khan took a four-year break from full-time acting, which was partly caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in India. He took the time off to attempt a career comeback. During this period, he made extended special appearances in the 2022 films &quot;Brahmāstra: Part One – Shiva&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

=== 2023–present: Resurgence ===
In 2023, Khan reunited with Yash Raj Films in the action thriller &quot;Pathaan&quot; (2023), set in the YRF Spy Universe, in which he played an exiled field agent assigned to stop a terrorist attack in India. Critic Sukanya Verma took note of Khan&#x27;s &quot;weathered intensity, grizzly charisma and trademark wit&quot;, while Kaveree Bamzai termed it a &quot;much-needed makeover&quot; of an ageing Khan into an action star. &quot;Pathaan&quot; broke several box-office records, thus re-establishing Khan&#x27;s stardom. Khan took on another action film role in the same year in Atlee&#x27;s &quot;Jawan&quot;, playing father and son doppelgängers. Nandini Ramnath of &quot;Scroll.in&quot; wrote that &quot;Khan&#x27;s screen image – expansive, suffused with love, heroic in an old-fashioned way without being aggressively macho, irreverent but also sincere – helps sell a conceit that might have crashed with any other actor&quot;. &quot;Jawan&quot; broke the records set by &quot;Pathaan&quot;. Both films grossed over to rank, respectively, as Hindi cinema&#x27;s second and third biggest grossers worldwide, making Khan the first Indian actor to deliver two films that earned over ₹10 billion. 

In his final release of 2023, Khan starred in Rajkumar Hirani&#x27;s &quot;Dunki&quot;, a social drama about an illegal immigration technique named donkey flight. Uday Bhatia wrote that his role as a &quot;romantic feminist soldier patriot friend&quot; marked &quot;a break from Khan the action star but offers no respite from the Khan the perfect screen idol&quot;. Grossing over , &quot;Dunki&quot; emerged as Khan&#x27;s third consecutive commercial success of the year, although it did not match up to the record grosses of &quot;Pathaan&quot; or &quot;Jawan&quot;.

== Other work ==
=== Film production and television hosting ===

Khan co-produced three films from 1999 to 2003 as a founding member of the partnership Dreamz Unlimited. After the partnership was dissolved, he and Gauri restructured the company as Red Chillies Entertainment, which includes divisions dealing with film and television production, visual effects, and advertising. As of 2015, the company has produced or co-produced at least nine films. Either Khan or Gauri are usually given production credits, and he has appeared in most of the films, either in the lead role, or in a guest appearance. Khan was involved in several aspects of the making of &quot;Ra.One&quot; (2011). Aside from acting, he produced the film, volunteered to write the console game script, dubbed for it, oversaw its technical development, and wrote the digital comics based on the film&#x27;s characters. Khan has occasionally done playback singing for his films. In &quot;Josh&quot; (2000) he sang the popular song &quot;Apun Bola Tu Meri Laila&quot;. He also sang in &quot;Don&quot; (2006) and &quot;Jab Tak Hai Jaan&quot; (2012). For &quot;Always Kabhi Kabhi&quot; (2011), which was produced by Red Chillies, Khan participated in the lyrical composition.

In addition to his early television serial appearances, Khan has hosted numerous televised awards shows, including the Filmfare, Zee Cine, and Screen Awards. In 2007, he replaced Amitabh Bachchan for one season as the host of &quot;Kaun Banega Crorepati&quot;, the Indian version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, and a year later, Khan began hosting &quot;Kya Aap Paanchvi Pass Se Tez Hain?&quot;, the Indian version of &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?&quot;. In 2011, he returned to television, appearing on Imagine TV&#x27;s &quot;Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout&quot;, the Indian version of &quot;Wipeout&quot;; scenes featuring Khan were shot at the Yash Raj Studios in Mumbai. Contrary to his earlier television anchoring jobs, &quot;Zor Ka Jhatka: Total Wipeout&quot; performed poorly. It aired for only one season and became the lowest rated show hosted by a Bollywood star. In 2017, Khan began hosting &quot;TED Talks India Nayi Soch&quot;, a talk show produced by TED Conferences, LLC which started aired on STAR Plus.

=== Stage performances ===
Khan is a frequent stage performer and has participated in several world tours and concerts. In 1997, he performed in Asha Bhosle&#x27;s Moments in Time concert in Malaysia, and returned the following year to perform with Karisma Kapoor for the Shahrukh–Karisma: Live in Malaysia concert. The same year, he participated in The Awesome Foursome world tour across the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States along with Juhi Chawla, Akshay Kumar and Kajol, and resumed the tour in Malaysia the following year. In 2002, Khan featured with Amitabh Bachchan, Aamir Khan, Preity Zinta, and Aishwarya Rai in the show From India With Love at Manchester&#x27;s Old Trafford and London&#x27;s Hyde Park; the event was attended by more than 100,000 people. Khan performed alongside Rani Mukherji, Arjun Rampal and Ishaa Koppikar in a 2010 concert at the St. Joseph High School field in Dhaka, Bangladesh. The next year he joined Shahid Kapoor and Priyanka Chopra in the Friendship Concert, celebrating 150 years of India–South Africa friendship in Durban, South Africa.

Khan started an association with the &quot;Temptations&quot; series of concert tours by singing, dancing, and performing skits alongside Arjun Rampal, Priyanka Chopra, and other Bollywood stars in Temptations 2004, a stage show that toured 22 venues across the world. The show played to 15,000 spectators at Dubai&#x27;s Festival City Arena. In 2008, Khan set up Temptation Reloaded, a series of concerts that toured several countries, including the Netherlands. Another tour was held with Bipasha Basu and others in 2012 in Jakarta, and in 2013 another series of concerts visited Auckland, Perth and Sydney. In 2014, Khan performed in SLAM! The Tour in the US, Canada, and London, and also hosted the Indian premiere of the live talent show, Got Talent World Stage Live.

=== Ownership of Kolkata Knight Riders ===
In 2008, Khan, in partnership with Juhi Chawla and her husband Jay Mehta, acquired ownership rights for the franchise representing Kolkata in the Twenty20 cricket tournament Indian Premier League (IPL) for million, and named the team Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR). , KKR was one of the richest teams in the IPL, with a brand value of million. The team performed poorly on the field during the first three years. Their performance improved over time, and they became the champions for the first time in 2012 and repeated the feat in 2014. The Knight Riders hold the record for the longest winning streak by any Indian team in T20s (14). They won their third IPL title in the 2024 edition.

Khan performed alongside Sunidhi Chauhan and Shriya Saran at the opening ceremony of the IPL 2011 season, where they danced to Tamil songs. He appeared again in 2013 alongside Katrina Kaif, Deepika Padukone and Pitbull. In May 2012, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) banned him from the Wankhede Stadium for five years for getting into an argument with the security staff after a match between KKR and the Mumbai Indians. Khan had, however, stated that he acted only after children, including his daughter, were being &quot;manhandled&quot; by the security staff and that the officials were extremely high-handed and aggressive in their behaviour, he had been abused with communal indecent comment. Later MCA officials had accused him of being drunk in one version of the story, hitting the guard and of completely uncharacteristically abusing a female supporter of Mumbai Indians after the match in another version of the story, which Khan had maintained it was done to support their action and for cheap publicity. Wankhede guard later contradicted MCA officials&#x27; claim and said Shah Rukh Khan had not hit him. Khan later apologised to his fans after his team won the final match. MCA revoked the ban in 2015 and in 2016, Mumbai Police informed that no &#x27;cognisable offence&#x27; was made out against Khan and they had come to the conclusion that Shah Rukh Khan was not drunk and did not use abusive language before minors at the Wankhede Stadium in 2012.

== In the media ==
Khan receives a considerable amount of media coverage in India, and is often referred to as &quot;King Khan&quot;, &quot;The Baadshah of Bollywood&quot;, or &quot;The King of Bollywood&quot;. Anupama Chopra cites him as an &quot;ever present celebrity&quot;, with two or three films a year, constantly running television ads, print ads, and gigantic billboards lining the streets of Indian cities. He is the object of a sometimes fanatical following, with a fan base estimated to exceed one billion. &quot;Newsweek&quot; named Khan as one of their fifty most powerful people globally in 2008 and called him &quot;the world&#x27;s biggest movie star&quot;. In 2011 he was described as &quot;the biggest movie star you&#x27;ve never heard of...perhaps the world&#x27;s biggest movie star, period&quot; by Steven Zeitchik of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and has been called the world&#x27;s biggest movie star in other international media outlets. According to a popularity survey, 3.2 billion people around the world know Khan, more than who know Tom Cruise. In a 2022 readers&#x27; poll by &quot;Empire&quot; magazine, Khan was listed as one of the 50 greatest actors of all time. The magazine attributed his success to the &quot;outrageous amounts of [his] charisma and absolute mastery of [his] craft. Comfortable in almost every genre going, there&#x27;s pretty much nothing he can&#x27;t do.&quot; In 2023, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world, and he topped the list per a readers poll.

Khan is one of the wealthiest celebrities in India, topping the &quot;Forbes&quot; India&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity 100 list&quot; in 2012, 2013 and 2015. His wealth has been estimated at US$400–600 million. Khan owns several properties in India and abroad, including a apartment in London, and a villa on the Palm Jumeirah in Dubai. From 2023–2024, Khan ranked as the highest tax payer in India.

Khan frequently appears on listings of the most popular, stylish and influential people in India. He has regularly featured among the top ten on &quot;The Times of India&quot;″s list of the 50 most desirable men in India, and in a 2007 poll by the magazine &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; he was named the sexiest man in Asia. Khan is often referred to as &quot;Brand SRK&quot; by media organisations because of his many brand endorsement and entrepreneurship ventures. He is one of the highest paid Bollywood endorsers and one of the most visible celebrities in television advertising, with up to a six per cent share of the television advertisement market. Khan has endorsed brands including Pepsi, Nokia, Hyundai, Dish TV, D&#x27;decor, LUX and TAG Heuer. Books have been published about him, and his popularity has been documented in several non-fiction films, including the two-part documentary &quot;The Inner and Outer World of Shah Rukh Khan&quot; (2005), and the Discovery Travel &amp; Living channel&#x27;s ten-part miniseries &quot;Living with a SuperstarShah Rukh Khan&quot; (2010). In 2007, Khan became the third Indian actor to have his wax statue installed at London&#x27;s Madame Tussauds museum, after Aishwarya Rai and Amitabh Bachchan. Additional versions of the statue were installed at Madame Tussauds&#x27; museums in Los Angeles, Hong Kong, New York and Washington.

Khan has been brand ambassador of various governmental campaigns, including Pulse Polio and the National AIDS Control Organisation. He is a member of the board of directors of the Make-A-Wish Foundation in India, and in 2011 he was appointed by UNOPS as the first global ambassador of the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council. He has recorded a series of public service announcements championing good health and proper nutrition, and joined India&#x27;s Health Ministry and UNICEF in a nationwide child immunisation campaign. In 2011, he received UNESCO&#x27;s Pyramide con Marni award for his charitable commitment to provide education for children, becoming the first Indian to win the accolade. In 2014, Khan became the ambassador for Interpol&#x27;s campaign &quot;Turn Back Crime&quot;. In 2015, Khan received a privileged degree from the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. In 2018, Khan was honoured by the World Economic Forum with their annual Crystal Award for his leadership in championing children&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rights in India.

In October 2019, Khan featured in a video launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi on his 150th birth anniversary. The preview of the video, which took place on 20 October 2019 at PMO, was attended by Khan, along with Aamir Khan, Kangana Ranaut, Rajkumar Hirani, Jacqueline Fernandez, Sonam Kapoor, Ekta Kapoor, Varun Sharma, Jackie Shroff, Imtiaz Ali, Sonu Nigam, Kapil Sharma, and many other dignitaries. Khan&#x27;s distinctive voice and mannerisms have inspired many imitators and voice actors. In the Hindi-dubbed version of the cartoon series &quot;Oggy and the Cockroaches&quot;, Saurav Chakrabarti emulates Khan&#x27;s voice for the character Oggy.

In April 2020, Khan announced a series of initiatives to help the government of India and the state governments of Maharashtra, West Bengal and Delhi mitigate the COVID-19 pandemic as well as relief measures for thousands of underprivileged people and daily wage labourers affected by the lockdown. He offered his 4-storey personal office space to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to be used as a quarantine centre for coronavirus patients.

== Awards and recognitions ==

Khan is one of the most decorated Bollywood actors. He has received 14 Filmfare Awards from 30 nominations and special awards, including winning eight for Best Actor; he is tied for the most in this category with Dilip Kumar. Khan has won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performances in &quot;Baazigar&quot; (1993), (1995), &quot;Dil To Pagal Hai&quot; (1997), &quot;Kuch Kuch Hota Hai&quot; (1998), &quot;Devdas&quot; (2002), &quot;Swades&quot; (2004), &quot;Chak De! India&quot; (2007) and &quot;My Name Is Khan&quot; (2010).

Although he has never won a National Film Award, he was awarded the Padma Shri by the Government of India in 2005. The Government of France has awarded him both the Order of Arts and Letters (2007), and the fifth degree of the French Legion of Honour, the &quot;Chevalier Légion d&#x27;honneur&quot; (2014). Khan has received five honorary doctorates; the first from The University of Bedfordshire in 2009, the second from The University of Edinburgh in 2015, the third from Maulana Azad National Urdu University in 2016, and his latest from The University of Law and La Trobe University in 2019.

== Personal life ==

Khan married Gauri Chibber, a Punjabi Hindu, in a traditional Hindu wedding ceremony on 25 October 1991, after a six-year courtship. They have a son Aryan (born 1997) and a daughter Suhana (born 2000). In 2013, they became parents of a third child named AbRam, who was born through a surrogate mother. Both his elder children have expressed interest in entering the entertainment industry; Khan has stated that Aryan, who studied filmmaking at the USC School of Cinematic Arts in California, aspires to become a writer-director, while Suhana, who served as assistant director for Khan&#x27;s film &quot;Zero&quot; (2018), is studying drama and acting at NYU&#x27;s Tisch School of the Arts for higher education. Suhana made her acting debut in November 2019, in a short film titled &quot;The Grey Part of Blue.&quot; According to Khan, while he strongly believes in Islam, he also values his wife&#x27;s religion. His children follow both religions; at his home the Qur&#x27;an is situated next to the murti of Hindu deities.

Although Khan was given the birth name Shahrukh Khan, he prefers his name to be written as Shah Rukh Khan, and is commonly referred to by the initialism SRK.

<text>Fallingwater is a house museum in Stewart Township in the Laurel Highlands of southwestern Pennsylvania, United States. Designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright, it is built partly over a waterfall on the Bear Run stream. The three-story residence was developed as a weekend retreat for Liliane and Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr., the owner of Kaufmann&#x27;s Department Store in Pittsburgh. The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy (WPC), which has operated Fallingwater as a tourist attraction since 1963, maintains surrounding the house. 

Edgar Kaufmann Sr. had established a summer retreat at Bear Run for his employees by 1916. When employees stopped using the retreat, the Kaufmanns bought the site in July 1933 and hired Wright to design the house in 1934. Several structural issues arose during the house&#x27;s construction, including cracked concrete and sagging terraces. The Kaufmanns began using the house in 1937 and hired Wright to design a guest wing, which was finished in 1939. Edgar Kaufmann Jr., the Kaufmanns&#x27; son, continued to use the house after his parents&#x27; deaths. After the WPC took over, it began hosting tours of the house in July 1964 and built a visitor center in 1979. The house was renovated in the late 1990s and early 2000s to remedy severe structural defects, including sagging terraces and poor drainage.

The house includes multiple outdoor terraces, which are cantilevered, extending outward from a chimney without support at the opposite end. Fallingwater is made of locally–quarried stone, reinforced concrete, steel, and plate glass. The first story contains the main entrance, the living room, two outdoor terraces, and the kitchen. There are four bedrooms (including a study) and additional terraces on the upper stories. Wright designed most of the house&#x27;s built-in furniture. Many pieces of art are placed throughout the house, in addition to objects including textiles and Tiffany glass. Above the main house is a guest wing with a carport and servants&#x27; quarters.

Fallingwater has received extensive architectural commentary over the years, and it was one of the world&#x27;s most-heavily-discussed modern–style structures by the 1960s. The house has been the subject of books, magazine articles, films, and other media works over the years. Fallingwater is designated as a National Historic Landmark, and it is one of eight buildings in &quot;The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;, a World Heritage Site.

== Site ==
Fallingwater is situated in Stewart Township in the Laurel Highlands of southwestern Pennsylvania, United States, about southeast of Pittsburgh. The house is located near Pennsylvania Route 381 (PA 381), between the communities of Ohiopyle and Mill Run in Fayette County. It is variously cited as being either in Bear Run, the stream that runs below the house, or in Mill Run, though the building&#x27;s deeds give the locale as Stewart Township. Nearby are the Bear Run Natural Area to the north, as well as Ohiopyle State Park and Fort Necessity National Battlefield to the south. The nearest city is Uniontown, to the west. Fallingwater is one of four buildings in southwestern Pennsylvania designed by the architect Frank Lloyd Wright. The others are Kentuck Knob, about to the southwest, as well as Duncan House and Lindholm House at Polymath Park in Acme, Pennsylvania.

=== Geography and structures ===
Fallingwater is named for the location of the main house, which is oriented roughly south-southeast. It sits above the Bear Run stream, a tributary of the Youghiogheny River, which has an upper falls about high (where the main house is situated) and a lower falls about high. At the house, Bear Run is above sea level; contrary to common perceptions, it does not pass through the house. The stream sometimes freezes during the winter and dries up during the summer. There is a layer of buff and gray sandstone under the site, which is part of the Pottsville Formation. Prior to Fallingwater&#x27;s construction, several sandstone boulders were scattered across the grounds. In contrast to other country estates, Fallingwater is not located on a geographically prominent site and is not easily visible. Canopy cover from the surrounding forest hangs above the house.

Atop a hill to the north of the main house is Fallingwater&#x27;s guest wing, which is about away from the main house. The guest wing, an &quot;L&quot;-shaped building, is connected to the main house by a curved outdoor walkway (see ). The house&#x27;s visitor pavilion, which is not visible from the main house, includes five open-air wooden structures with connecting pathways. The pavilion includes glass-walled wings with bathrooms, exhibit areas, and a child-care center, in addition to an open-air ticket office. Approximately from the main house is the Barn at Fallingwater, which consists of two barns built and in the early 1940s.

The grounds include a small mausoleum for Edgar and Liliane Kaufmann, which has doors designed by Alberto Giacometti. Edgar Jr. was cremated after his death, and his ashes are spread around the house. There are paths throughout the grounds, including a pathway to the waterfall. Wright designed a set of gates for the house&#x27;s driveway, though these were never installed. George Longenecker designed a gate that was used at Fallingwater from 1995 to 2005; it weighed and measured across. Wright also designed several unbuilt structures for the estate, including a gatehouse, farmhouse, and various expansions.

=== Previous site usage ===
In the 1890s, a freemasonry group from Pittsburgh developed a country club on a plot of land that includes the Fallingwater site. By 1909, this clubhouse had been acquired by another group of masons who turned it into the Syria Country Club. The club went bankrupt in 1913. A map from that year shows that the grounds included the clubhouse, the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s Bear Run station, and 13 other buildings (none of which are extant). One of the structures was a cottage on the site of Fallingwater&#x27;s guest wing, while the clubhouse was about to the southeast.

Edgar J. Kaufmann Sr., the president of Kaufmann&#x27;s Department Store in Pittsburgh, had established a summer retreat at Bear Run for his employees by 1916. Up to one thousand employees used the retreat each summer. In 1922, Edgar and his wife Liliane built a simple summer cabin on a nearby cliff, which was nicknamed the &quot;Hangover&quot; and lacked electricity, plumbing, or heating. The Kaufmanns&#x27; permanent residence, at the time, was La Tourelle in Fox Chapel. Kaufmann&#x27;s employees eventually bought the Bear Run site in 1926, and the Hangover was expanded in 1931. After Kaufmann&#x27;s Department Store employees stopped using the summer retreat, the Kaufmann family bought the site in July 1933.

== Development ==
Edgar and Liliane Kaufmann became familiar with Wright&#x27;s work through their only child, Edgar Kaufmann Jr.. The younger Edgar had studied in Europe under the artist Victor Hammer from 1930 to 1933. After returning to the United States, in September 1934, Edgar Jr. traveled to Wright&#x27;s Wisconsin studio, Taliesin, and began apprenticing under Wright. Edgar Jr.&#x27;s parents met with Wright that November while visiting their son. The architectural historian Paul Goldberger credits Edgar Jr. as the second-most influential figure in Fallingwater&#x27;s development, behind Wright himself.

=== Planning ===

Fallingwater was one of three major buildings that Frank Lloyd Wright designed in the 1930s, along with the Johnson Wax Building in Racine, Wisconsin, and Herbert Jacobs&#x27;s first house in Madison, Wisconsin. When Wright was hired as Fallingwater&#x27;s architect in late 1934, he was 67 years old, and he had designed only two buildings in six years. Wright wanted to select a site &quot;that has features making for character&quot;, and Edgar Jr. recalled that when Wright visited Bear Run, he had been excited by the landscape he had seen. The Kaufmanns wanted Wright to design a building set far back from the road. In late December 1934, Wright visited Bear Run and asked for a survey of the area around the waterfall. His team drew up models of the house and site in Arizona, and Wright asked the Kaufmanns to list every tree species on the site. An map of the site&#x27;s boulders, trees, and topography was completed and forwarded to Wright on March 9, 1935.

The Kaufmanns asked Wright to include a large living–dining space, at least three bedrooms, a dressing room, and a guest and servant wing. Edgar Sr. wanted to pay between $20,000 and $30,000 for construction. Wright&#x27;s apprentices Edgar Tafel and Robert Mosher were the most heavily involved in the building&#x27;s design, while his employees Mendel Glickman and William Wesley Peters were the structural engineers. Wright postponed his sketches for Kaufmann&#x27;s country home while designing another project for Kaufmann. Concurrently, Wright continued to formulate plans for the house&#x27;s orientation, materials, and general shape and size. Edgar Sr. called Wright on September 22, 1935, to inform the architect that he would visit Taliesin. Wright&#x27;s apprentices disagree on what exactly happened next, but the sketches were complete when Edgar Sr. arrived two hours later. Contrary to common claims that Wright had ignored the design for nine months before hurriedly sketching it, he had already devised the plans mentally and had written about them to Edgar Sr. multiple times.

Wright&#x27;s plan called for a structure with exposed cantilevers. The house was to be placed on Bear Run&#x27;s northern bank, oriented 30 degrees counterclockwise from due south, so that every room would receive natural light. It also included terraces that resembled rock ledges. Edgar Sr. had expected that the house would be downstream from Bear Run&#x27;s waterfalls, allowing the Kaufmann family to see the cascades. This meant that the house would have faced north, with suboptimal amounts of natural light, so Wright instead designed the home above the waterfall. As he explained to Edgar Sr.: &quot;I want you to live with the waterfall, not to look at it.&quot; Wright sent preliminary plans to Edgar Sr. for approval on October 15, 1935, after which Wright visited the site again. The Kaufmanns were impressed with the design, which Wright continued to work on.

By January 1936, Wright&#x27;s team had completed detailed drawings, which were largely unchanged from the initial sketches. The next month, Wright&#x27;s team sent the plans to Edgar Sr. for review, and workers began building a sample wall. Edgar Sr. asked engineers in Pittsburgh to review the blueprints for the highly experimental design. The engineers recommended against constructing a building on the site, citing at least eight structural issues. Either Wright or Edgar Sr. reportedly ordered the report to be sealed inside the building, though Edgar Sr. is known to have kept a copy of the report. By early 1937, Wright&#x27;s team was on its eighth set of drawings. In the final plans, Wright added a third floor and rearranged some rooms.

=== Construction ===
Edgar Sr. wrote that he constantly thought about the house, &quot;which has become part of me and a part of my life&quot;. Wright visited every four to six weeks, appointing Mosher as his on-site representative. Wright hired Walter J. Hall, a contractor from northern Pennsylvania. Hall&#x27;s former employee Earl Friar was hired as a reinforced-concrete consultant. Edgar Jr. was heavily involved with the project and acted as an intermediary between his father and Wright, and several Kaufmann&#x27;s employees and extended family members also worked on site. Work was carried out by local laborers, many of whom were inexperienced; they were paid between 35 and 85 cents an hour depending on their skill level. The project was characterized by conflicts between Wright, Kaufmann, and the contractors, as Wright prioritized the house&#x27;s esthetics over any structural concerns. Due to Hall&#x27;s careless attitude and clumsiness, Mosher ended up supervising most of the work.

==== Concrete and masonry work ====
A disused rock quarry nearby was reopened in late 1935 to provide stone for the house, although actual work on the foundation did not begin until April 1936. By then, construction was behind schedule. The masonry contractor, Norbert James Zeller, began building the house&#x27;s access bridge shortly thereafter; he was later fired following disputes with Wright and Kaufmann. During a visit to the site shortly afterward, Mosher inquired where the main level of the house would be located, and Wright directed Mosher to use one of the boulders on site as a datum reference. By June 1936, workers had completed the access bridge and the footers for three of the house&#x27;s &quot;bolsters&quot;, or piers. However, Mosher ordered that the bolsters be rebuilt after receiving revised plans from Taliesin. Despite delays in delivering wood from Algoma, Wisconsin, workers had excavated the basement by that July.

Workers began pouring concrete formwork for the first-floor terrace in August 1936, and masonry work reached the second story that month. As the first-floor terrace was being poured, Kaufmann asked the engineering firm Metzger-Richardson to draw up plans for extra rebar to the concrete. Wright rejected these plans because he believed the extra steel would overload the terraces, and he also dismissed the idea of constructing additional supports in Bear Run&#x27;s streambed. Contractors secretly added the rebar anyway, and when Wright heard about the increased rebar, he told Mosher to return to Taliesin. Wright wrote angrily to Kaufmann: &quot;I have put so much more into this house than you or any other client has a right to expect, that if I don&#x27;t have your confidence—to hell with the whole thing&quot;. Despite Kaufmann&#x27;s expressions of confidence in Wright&#x27;s work, the extra steel remained in place. The second-floor terrace was poured in October 1936, and Tafel replaced Mosher as the construction supervisor afterward.

The contractors neglected to incline the formwork slightly to account for settling and deflection. Soon after the concrete was poured, the parapet cracked at two locations. Wright attempted to reassure Edgar Sr. by saying that cracked concrete was normal and safe, but Edgar Sr. remained skeptical. Once the formwork was removed, the first-floor terrace sank about . Glickman, contacted by Mosher, reportedly confessed that he had forgotten to account for the compressive forces of the concrete beams, though the historian Franklin Toker disputes that this happened. Wright attributed the sagging to the parapets&#x27; weight, and he drew up plans to reinforce the western second-floor terrace and the roof above the eastern second-floor bedroom. Meanwhile, structural issues continued to arise: By December 1936, five major cracks had been detected. Mosher was reinstated as the project&#x27;s supervisor, and Kaufmann&#x27;s engineer installed a stone wall under the western second-floor terrace in January 1937. When Wright discovered the wall, he had Mosher remove the top course of stones; the wall was later disassembled entirely.

==== Completion ====

By early 1937, the installation of interior finishes had begun. Hope&#x27;s Windows Inc. of Jamestown, New York, manufactured the window sashes and the hatch for the living-room stairs, while Pittsburgh Plate Glass made the windows themselves. Wright also suggested covering the exteriors with gold leaf; it is unclear whether Wright had made his suggestion jokingly or seriously. In either case, Edgar Sr. hired a gold-leaf contractor, who rejected the idea, and Wright subsequently suggested finishing the facade in white mica. Wright reportedly decided on the final color, a shade of ocher, after picking up a dried rhododendron leaf; he ordered waterproof paint from DuPont. At Kaufmann&#x27;s request, Wright added a plunge pool at the bottom of the living-room stairs, and he retained the large boulder on the living room&#x27;s floor.

Through mid-1937, workers continued to lay floor tiles, and they conducted tests on the terraces. In addition, the contractors refined plans for details such as the paint colors and metalwork. The cork tiles in the bathrooms were particularly problematic, since they had to be installed on curved surfaces. Wright hired the Wisconsin–based Gillen Woodworking Corporation to produce furniture for the house. The Kaufmanns moved into the house in November 1937, but the main house&#x27;s furnishings were not completed until 1938. Wright came up with the Fallingwater name around the same time; previously, the house had been known as the E.J. Kaufmann Residence or E.J. Kaufmann House. Even though some other American country estates (such as Biltmore, Monticello, or Mount Vernon) also used nicknames, the Kaufmanns did not use the Fallingwater name. 

Wright began drawing out plans for a guest wing, replacing an existing cottage on a hill behind the main house. Wright had completed blueprints for the guest wing by May 1938, but the Kaufmanns initially objected to the interior layout and the bridge between the main and guest wings. After Wright presented final plans for the guest wing in April 1939, Edgar Jr. modified the main house&#x27;s decorations and furnishings. By that September, the guest wing was being finished. Fallingwater exceeded its budget significantly. The final cost for the home and guest house was $155,000 (equivalent to about $ million in ). The total cost was nearly four times Kaufmann&#x27;s original budget, which in turn was ten times the average cost of a four-bedroom house in Pennsylvania at the time. From 1938 through 1941, more than $22,000 was spent on additional details and modifications.

== Use as house ==

=== Early years ===
The Kaufmann family used Fallingwater as a weekend home for 26 years. The family took the train to the Bear Run station, where a chauffeur drove them to the house. Herbert Ohler was the property&#x27;s caretaker until 1939, when he was replaced by Jesse Hall. Relatively few changes occurred after the guest wing was completed. The Kaufmanns sometimes invited small numbers of people to Fallingwater. It hosted guests such as the artists Diego Rivera and Pablo Picasso, the scientist Albert Einstein and the artist Peter Blume. Over the years, the family also added artwork. Part of the Kaufmanns&#x27; Bear Run estate caught fire in 1941, although the house itself was undamaged. The estate&#x27;s dairy barn burned down in 1945, but the main house again avoided damage.

Fallingwater showed signs of deterioration after its completion. The house originally leaked in 50 places, though later investigations found that the leaks had arisen from errors made by the builders. The worsening condition of Fallingwater&#x27;s terraces prompted Edgar Sr. to hire a surveyor in 1941. Contravening his own surveyor&#x27;s advice, Edgar Sr. did not expand the wall under the western terrace. The terraces were surveyed 16 more times between 1945 and 1955. Despite subsequent repairs to the parapet, the cracks there periodically reappeared. Fallingwater&#x27;s problems were so numerous that Edgar Sr. referred to it as &quot;Rising Mildew&quot;.

=== After World War II ===
After World War II, the family spent winters at the Kaufmann Desert House in Palm Springs, California. Wright expanded the kitchen in 1946, and he drew up plans for never-built expansions of the dining area and foyer. Elsie Henderson was hired as the house&#x27;s chef in 1947, working there for the next sixteen years. In 1950, and again in 1953, workers installed posts under the second floor to prevent it from sagging. Edgar Sr. observed that some windows had begun to crack and that some of the doors no longer opened easily. Furthermore, Edgar Sr. and Liliane&#x27;s marriage had become strained, and Liliane wanted to build a house nearby in Ohiopyle. In the long run, the family wanted to donate Fallingwater. 

Liliane died in 1952, and her husband died three years later. Edgar Jr. continued to use the house after his parents died. He discontinued Fallingwater&#x27;s annual structural surveys and instead had his chief of maintenance monitor the terraces. Edgar Jr. abandoned the estate&#x27;s farm and mill, planting 100,000 pine trees there, and he strengthened the living-room hatch. The eastern section of the house&#x27;s roof was rebuilt in 1954. The living room was flooded during a storm two years later; while the furniture was severely damaged, the house experienced no structural damage. By then, the sagging terraces had caused the window frames to warp, and workers had to add supports to the terraces, repair the roof, and rebuild the staircase between the living room and Bear Run. Jesse Hall retired as Fallingwater&#x27;s superintendent in 1959.

== Use as museum ==

=== 1960s and 1970s ===
Edgar Kaufmann Jr. announced in September 1963 that he would donate the house and about to the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy (WPC). In exchange, the WPC agreed to open the house to the public as a house museum. At the time, many of Wright&#x27;s houses were being demolished or altered significantly. The conservancy took over the house on October 29, 1963, with a speech by Pennsylvania governor William Scranton. Edgar Jr. gave the WPC $500,000 for the house&#x27;s maintenance, as well as five annual payments of $30,000 for educational programs. One local newspaper wrote: &quot;We are indeed fortunate, here in Fayette County, to have such beauty.&quot; The museum was dedicated in memory of Edgar and Liliane Kaufmann. In subsequent years, the WPC&#x27;s holdings were expanded to , becoming the Bear Run Natural Area.

In accordance with Edgar Jr.&#x27;s request, the WPC attempted to recreate the house&#x27;s original appearance, furnishing the rooms with the family&#x27;s possessions. Edgar Jr. moved some of the house&#x27;s artwork to his homes in New York, acquiring other work for the museum. Guided tours began in July 1964, running from April to November of each year. Visitors were allowed to enter most of the rooms but had to reserve tickets in advance. Edgar Jr. remained involved with the WPC and Fallingwater for the rest of his life, visiting the house twice annually until his death in 1989. The house began hosting scholars-in-residence during 1967, and Edward A. Robinson was appointed as the museum&#x27;s supervisor in 1970. WPC members received free admission twice annually starting in 1973.

The facade was repainted in mid-1972, and the WPC added a gift shop to the museum next year. The WPC began planning a visitor center in the early 1970s, and it hired the landscape architect William G. Swain to design renovations to the property. The conservancy constructed new paths, repaved the existing trails with dark gravel, and added a small crafts store. Fallingwater was repainted repeatedly over the years, and the WPC undertook a major exterior renovation in 1976. Mildew and repeated freeze-and-thaw cycles had caused damage over time. Afterward, the WPC began repairing the facade every three to four years. The visitor pavilion was still being developed by 1977; the new structure was to contain a shop, reception center, and child-care center. The original pavilion, designed by Grant Curry Jr., opened in April 1979 and burned down two days later.

=== 1980s and early 1990s ===
The WPC rebuilt the visitor pavilion, obtaining a $800,000 grant from the Edgar J. Kaufmann Foundation. The conservancy hired the architect Paul Mayén, along with Curry, Martin &amp; Highberger to redesign the pavilion. The pavilion partially reopened in July 1980 and was rededicated in June 1981. In addition, the trellises at the front entrance were replaced in 1982 following a storm. The WPC began hosting limited wintertime tours in January 1984. By then, the museum&#x27;s annual expenses amounted to $400,000; despite high visitation, the WPC was breaking even. Lynda Waggoner was appointed as the house&#x27;s curator the next year, later being promoted to director. A restaurant also opened at the visitor center in 1985. During the late 1980s, the WPC spent at least $500,000 on repairs. The organization restored 182 pieces of furniture for the house&#x27;s 50th anniversary, and it hired a contractor from Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, to add waterproofing. The woodwork and terraces were also repaired, and the windows were replaced.

By the late 1980s, acid rain and freeze-and-thaw cycles had caused deterioration. The house was vulnerable to water damage because the site was always humid. Even though most of the leaks had been repaired, rain and snow still pooled on the terraces and roof, and water came in through the walls. In addition, the ends of the terraces had sagged by , tilting almost two degrees. In 1992, the WPC hired John Seekircher to fix the living room&#x27;s glass hatch, which had not been opened in two decades. Waggoner also planned to repaint the house, which was complicated by strict environmental regulations regarding Bear Run.

=== 1990s and 2000s renovations ===

An engineering student, John Paul Huguley, first identified issues with the terraces in the mid-1990s. The WPC hired the engineer Robert Silman to assess the terraces and design a permanent fix. Silman&#x27;s company confirmed that the terraces&#x27; cracks were growing. Though Silman&#x27;s computer models also indicated that the terraces were at risk of collapsing, the WPC&#x27;s chief executive, Larry Schweiger, said the terraces were not in danger of collapse. Waggoner recalled that the terraces were so brittle that visitors could actually feel them bounce. Workers installed temporary girders in 1997 at a cost of $140,000. The girders were intended to help relieve stresses on the cantilevers. The WPC cut out a section of the floor, adding a glass opening; the living room&#x27;s sofa was removed as well. Temporary footings were installed in the streambed, and the stream was diverted to allow crews to access the terraces, In addition, two terraces were closed temporarily.

The engineering firm Wank Adams Slavin Associates was hired to design a large-scale restoration. Silman devised plans to post-tension the slabs by pulling high-strength steel cables through the beams. The idea of jacking up the house was deemed infeasible because it would have exacerbated the cracks. A panel of engineers and architects endorsed Silman&#x27;s proposal in early 1999, and the WPC began raising $6 million for structural repairs that year. The WPC also discussed the structural issues with engineers, historians, and architects from around the world, including Wright&#x27;s grandson Eric. The work was postponed by two years while the WPC raised money. The Getty Foundation provided the WPC with a $70,000 grant to investigate the structural issues, and Fallingwater received approximately $900,000 through the federal Save America&#x27;s Treasures program. Additionally, Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge provided $3.5 million, and private donors provided another $7.2 million.

Work began in late 2001, at which point the restoration was estimated to cost $11.5 million. The outer end of the first-floor terrace was raised by approximately . The post-tensioning phase cost about $4 million and was completed in six months. Though the terraces still had a noticeable sag, the post-tensioning prevented further damage to the terraces. The WPC also planned to strengthen one of the terraces using carbon fiber, rebuild the staircase from the living room to Bear Run, and repair water damage. Pamela Jerome of Wank Adams Slavin drew up plans to install roof membranes to improve drainage. Due to acid rain and emissions from a coal-fired power station nearby, the exterior also had to be repainted. Workers relocated some outbuildings and replaced the visitor center&#x27;s sewage system. Signage, paths, and landscape features were rehabilitated as well. The house was connected to a municipal water system for the first time. Visitation increased after the renovations, which were largely completed in 2003. Fallingwater received $100,000 for landscaping in late 2003; the next year, the entrance roadways were reconfigured, and the sewage system was finished.

=== Mid-2000s to present ===

After the renovation was completed in 2005, the WPC began removing invasive species from the Fallingwater grounds that year. Additionally, the WPC replaced 319 windows at the house after PPG Industries donated glass panes in 2010. The WPC hired a firm from Peekskill, New York, to help restore the windows. In the mid-2010s, one of Fallingwater&#x27;s volunteer landscapers created a pottery terrace in one of the house&#x27;s planters. One of the statues on the grounds was toppled and damaged during a rainstorm in 2017, and some trees were damaged as well.

Waggoner announced in 2017 that she would retire as the museum&#x27;s director, and Justin W. Gunther was appointed to replace her. After becoming Fallingwater&#x27;s director, Gunther devised plans for a $3 million waterproofing project, which was supposed to have begun in 2019. The museum was temporarily closed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Pennsylvania; the outdoor spaces reopened for self-guided tours that June. The same September, the Pennsylvania government gave Fallingwater nearly $240,000 to offset financial losses from the pandemic. In addition, a photovoltaic power array was installed at Fallingwater in 2022 to help power the main house and guest wing. The WPC spent $7 million to patch leaks during 2024 and 2025; by then, much of the waterproofing added during the 1990s had worn away.

== Architecture ==
Fallingwater has been described as an example of Wright&#x27;s organic architecture. Though the house is also sometimes described as a Modern–styled building, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; wrote that the design was &quot;a kind of streamlined, handmade, organic architecture&quot; not emulated by other architects. The site&#x27;s natural setting may have been inspired by Japanese architecture, a style Wright liked. Fallingwater&#x27;s design shares elements with Wright&#x27;s earlier Prairie houses and his later Usonian houses. Elements such as trellises are derived from Italian architecture, while the kitchen is inspired by New England colonial architecture. Wright&#x27;s design for the facade also shares similarities with an unbuilt villa designed by Mies van der Rohe, and the cantilevers resemble those in three structures designed by Rudolph Schindler. Wright tried to preserve natural features; for example, he installed braces and trellises around existing trees. 

The main house is three stories high. Wright sought to eliminate the distinction between the exterior and interior, using the same materials indoors and outdoors. He also wanted breezes to be felt, and the waterfalls to be heard, throughout the house. Wright built Fallingwater out of Pottsville sandstone, in addition to reinforced concrete, steel, and plate glass. The concrete is a mixture of sand, cement, and gravel from the streambed. All the woodwork in the house is made of black walnut from North Carolina, which was selected because it did not warp as other types of wood did. Decorative motifs, such as courses of stone and wood grains, are oriented horizontally. Several of the design features—including the corner windows, foam-rubber seats, and indirect lighting—were uncommon when Fallingwater was completed.

=== Exterior ===

The facade uses three colors: gray for the sandstone, a light-ocher &quot;dead rhododendron&quot; color for the concrete, and Cherokee red for the steel. Red was used because Wright believed that the hue was an &quot;invincible&quot; color of life and because it was the color of burning metal. The house&#x27;s windows have metal casings, which are painted Cherokee red. The windows are embedded directly into the facade, with no visible vertical mullions; they only contain horizontal transom bars. Some of the house&#x27;s corners have windows that open inward.

The roof has rolled edges and is covered with beige gravel, blending in with the color of the facade. The northern elevation of the house&#x27;s facade contains masonry walls with setbacks, which were intended to replicate the textures of the cliff opposite it. The house&#x27;s chimney is covered in striated sandstone and rises above the first story. 

The house is accessed by a bridge across Bear Run. At either end of the bridge are planters made of rough stone. There is a rectangular concrete panel at the middle of the bridge deck, with square, inlaid lights. Heading north from the bridge, the pathway curves to the west. The entrance is reached via a driveway with horizontal trellises overhead, which doubles as a porte-cochère. The main doorway is recessed from the facade. There is a small fountain next to the entrance, where the Kaufmanns could wash their feet after going into Bear Run. 

==== Terraces ====
Fallingwater has many cantilevered terraces, which are made of concrete. The terraces are supported only at one end, extending outward from the house&#x27;s chimney. All the terraces have parapets with rounded tips, which are covered with stucco and were intended to strengthen the terraces. The parapets are high, much shorter than what is allowed under modern building codes. At the time of the house&#x27;s construction, neither cantilevers nor reinforced concrete were commonplace. Wright likened the terraces to tree branches and, as one Associated Press writer described it, &quot;a tray balancing on the fingers of a waiter&quot;. The terraces have also been compared to horizontal trays and to a treehouse. The horizontal axes of the terraces also contrasts with the vertical axis of the darker-gray chimney.

The primary section of the main house, which includes the living room, runs perpendicular to the stream and is carried on an enclosed terrace. The underside of the terrace is made of a reinforced-concrete slab and is supported at one end by four &quot;bolsters&quot; or piers. There is a grid of cantilevered beams and joists above the slab, which is similar in shape to an inverted coffered ceiling. Above the grid are wooden planks, which are covered by the living room&#x27;s stone floor tiles. Additional outdoor terraces run to the east and west of the living room; the western terrace protrudes past the kitchen&#x27;s western wall.

Each of the bedrooms has its own outdoor terrace. On the second floor&#x27;s southern side is another terrace, which extends further outward than the living room below it. The terrace was missing rebar at key points, so it instead rested partially on four vertical mullions along the southern wall of the living room. On the eastern end of the second floor are eight trellis beams and a glass canopy above the living room. On the western side of the house, there is another terrace above the second floor, with stairs to Edgar Sr.&#x27;s second-floor bedroom and Edgar Jr.&#x27;s third-floor study. The second floor&#x27;s eastern terrace, serving the guest bedroom, is the only one in the house with a canopy.

=== Interior ===

Fallingwater&#x27;s asymmetrical floor plan was loosely derived from the cruciform plan of the Prairie houses. It has a floor area of , of which is composed of outdoor terraces. The remaining is indoors. Including the guest wing and terraces, there is about of space. The walls, chimney, and piers are made of sandstone from the surrounding area. The house&#x27;s superstructure does not use any steel I-beams, but it does use folded slabs of reinforced concrete for structural support. Steel was used for the windows and doors. The floors have black-walnut millwork as well as sandstone finishes. The terraces&#x27; subfloors are made of redwood timbers.

The house has four bedrooms. Fallingwater has smaller spaces leading to larger rooms, an example of Wright&#x27;s compression-and-release principle; one source described the interiors as &quot;spaces of varying sizes and shapes that seem to flow from one to the other&quot;. The hallways have low ceilings to prevent loitering and to create a cave-like atmosphere. There are windows at the ends of the hallways. Wright also shrank the bedrooms to encourage occupants to use the terrace. Wright, who was tall, designed the house based on the assumption that the average person was his height, so some ceilings are as low as . The highest ceilings are . The three rooms in the chimney—the first-floor kitchen and two bedrooms above—are the only rooms in the house with identical dimensions. Although the first story is wheelchair-accessible, the other stories are not, and there is no space for an elevator in the house.

Interior decorations, including lights with dentils and shields, were intended to contrast with the exterior design. Some interior design elements (such as furniture, shelves, and the beam on which the kitchen kettle is hung) are cantilevered, while others (including niches and stairs) incorporate circular arcs. The spaces are illuminated by indirect lighting, a novelty for residential buildings at the time of Fallingwater&#x27;s completion. The illumination is primarily composed of fluorescent lights covered by shields, though there are also desktop and tabletop lamps, which are made of bronze with wooden shields. Wright placed the house&#x27;s toilets about above the floor, as he believed that a squatting position was healthier than sitting atop a standard American toilet. In addition, he clad the bathrooms with cork tiles, and he ordered industrial-sized shower heads to make visitors feel like they were under a waterfall.

==== First story ====
The ground or first story contains the main entrance, the living area (which is cantilevered above the waterfall), and the kitchen. The first story has a waxed stone floor, an allusion to the stream flowing below it. The bolsters divide the house into four bays from west to east, each of which measures wide. The main entrance, within the easternmost bay, leads to a small foyer with stone walls. There is a niche for storing coats and scarves. Three steps ascend from the foyer to the living room.

The living area occupies the center two bays. The room also functions as a study and dining area and, as such, has been described as a great room. A niche on one wall was intended as a music area. On the western wall, another niche includes a fireplace, whose hearth is made of boulders from the site. In the niche is a cast iron kettle suspended from a swinging arm. In front of the fireplace, a boulder protrudes from the floor. Wright had wanted to shave the top of the boulder, but Edgar Sr. insisted that it be kept. A dining area, on the living room&#x27;s northern wall, adjoins a stone staircase to the upper stories. The eastern wall has a small library. Two stone piers, in the middle of the room, support a coved ceiling.

There are windows on three sides of the living room, as well as doors to the western and eastern terraces. From the eastern terrace, a stairway ascends to the second floor. The living area also has a glass-enclosed hatch, which covers a concrete stairway descending into Bear Run. Despite Edgar Sr.&#x27;s doubts about the hatch, Wright and Edgar Jr. had insisted that the stair was &quot;absolutely necessary from every standpoint&quot;. The stairs are mostly underneath a canopy, except the lowest steps, which are beneath a semicircular lightwell. The stairs end at a landing just above the stream. There is a shallow plunge pool at the bottom of the stairway, which is fed by a reservoir. The Kaufmanns kept the hatch open during the summer.

A doorway connects the living area with the kitchen, which occupies the house&#x27;s westernmost bay. Unlike the other rooms in the house, the kitchen is a utilitarian space; one writer described it as having a cave-like atmosphere. An annex adjoins the kitchen to the west. When the Kaufmanns lived there, Liliane seldom used the kitchen.

==== Other stories ====
From the main staircase&#x27;s second-story landing, steps lead up and down to the various rooms and terraces. The second floor contains two bedrooms. There is a master bedroom above the middle of the living room. The master bedroom has custom movable shelves and bedside lighting, glass doors to the master-bedroom terrace, and an ornate fireplace mantel with three large rocks. There is a dressing room above the kitchen, as well as a second bedroom (originally used by guests) above the eastern portion of the living room. These rooms have simpler fireplaces. The bedroom ceilings decrease in height from wall to wall. A gallery connects with a footbridge over the house&#x27;s driveway, which leads to the guest wing and is covered by a terrace. There is a moss garden and part of a cliff face next to the footbridge.

The third story&#x27;s concrete floor slab is folded for additional strength. There is a bedroom directly above the second-story dressing room, which Edgar Jr. used as a study. The study&#x27;s fireplace mantel is made of red stone from the site. Liliane used the third-story terrace as a roof garden with herbs. On the third floor is a dead-end gallery, which was originally intended to connect with the footbridge over the driveway, but instead functioned as a bedroom for Edgar Jr. A set of stairs descends to the western second-story terrace.

The house also has a cellar with space for a partial bathroom, storage, and a boiler room, in addition to a wine cellar. There are exposed pipes and boilers in the cellar, and heat pipes are embedded in the walls.

=== Guest wing ===

The footbridge from the main house connects to a curved breezeway or open-air walkway, which in turn connects with a guest and servant wing. The walkway runs underneath a stepped concrete canopy, supported by steel posts along one side. The path curves around the site of a large oak tree that was removed in 2001. The walkway includes a small rock pool with a sculpture and a boulder that has water cascading down it. The cascade was not part of the original plans but was added after workers discovered a hidden spring near the boulder.

The guest wing&#x27;s ceilings are typically tall, and it has a lounge, bedroom, and bathroom. The lounge has a stone fireplace mantel, a hidden wardrobe, clerestory windows and shelves on one wall, and a bench that doubles as a bed. The adjoining guest room is adjacent to an outdoor swimming pool. The guest pool, measuring long and deep, is fed by water from a spring. The guest wing&#x27;s bathroom has a mirror designed by Edgar Jr.

Adjacent to the guest house is a carport with four parking spots, which is accessed from the house&#x27;s driveway and has a tall concrete wall. The carport and guest wing are connected by a chimney and recessed stair. There are three bedrooms and a bathroom above the carport, which are used by staff. These rooms contain the same finishes as the main house. Extending southeast of the guest wing is a terrace with a cantilevered canopy. A garage on the upper story was designed in 1947 but not built.

== Collection ==
Fallingwater&#x27;s collection includes over 1,000 objects. Until the 2000s renovation, the house had no air conditioning or curtains, high humidity, and high levels of ultraviolet light, making the collection particularly vulnerable to damage.

=== Furnishings and furniture ===

Half of the house&#x27;s furniture is built-in, while the other half is movable. Wright, who believed that his clients should not arbitrarily swap out decoration, designed most of Fallingwater&#x27;s built-in furniture. There are nearly 200 pieces of furniture, including wooden wardrobes, chairs, cabinets, tables, and backboards. Many objects have walnut finishes to prevent moisture buildups, and many of the walls have wooden shelves and trim. Among the original furnishings are sheepskin rugs, a sheepskin couch, foam-rubber seats, and cantilevered tables. Edgar Jr. helped Wright design sliding shelves for some of the cabinets. The WPC owns the trademarks to the pieces of furniture that Wright designed.

The living room&#x27;s expandable dining table, which could seat about 18 people, conceals a pier underneath. Each bedroom&#x27;s headboard is located on the room&#x27;s eastern wall so the Kaufmanns would not wake up with sun in their eyes. Some of the furniture, including a desk in Edgar Sr.&#x27;s study, has rounded cutouts to accommodate the corner windows, which swing inward. The house also has wooden radiator cases, and the kitchen has metal cabinets and a stove. The Kaufmanns bought other objects for the house, including Tiffany lamps. The family also acquired objects through trips to Mexico and through Edgar Jr.&#x27;s connections with New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA). Most of the Kaufmanns&#x27; furnishings remain in place, though some objects, such as rugs and pillowcases, have been replaced over the years.

The Kaufmanns occasionally rejected some of Wright&#x27;s suggested decorations and furnishings. For instance, Edgar Sr. refused Wright&#x27;s designs for custom rugs, floor lamps, and chairs. The Kaufmanns, unhappy with Wright&#x27;s original barrel-shaped seats, bought three-legged stools, which provided more stability on the irregular stone floors. For the most part, the windows did not have drapes or shades, since Wright wanted the windows to be unobstructed. Liliane ordered privacy blinds for the guest bedroom&#x27;s windows, and shelves were installed across the living room&#x27;s windows. In another case, Wright disliked a set of tables that the Kaufmanns owned, so the family reportedly hid the tables when he came over.

=== Art ===
When Fallingwater was finished, Wright gifted the Kaufmanns six Japanese woodblock prints by Hiroshige and Hokusai. The rest of Fallingwater&#x27;s art was selected by the Kaufmanns, who liked collecting art from a variety of cultures. The multicolored artwork in the house contrasts with the ocher, gray, and red tones of the exterior. The main house contains artwork from countries such as Japan, Morocco, and Mexico, as well as religious artworks. During visits to the house, Wright sometimes recommended artwork for the Kaufmanns to acquire.

The art collection includes pieces such as Diego Rivera&#x27;s &quot;El Sueño&quot; and Pablo Picasso&#x27;s &quot;The Smoker&quot; and &quot;The Artist and his Model&quot;. The mural &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, painted in the 18th century by an unknown artist, is placed at the second-floor staircase landing. Liliane&#x27;s bedroom features a niche with a wooden sculpture of &quot;Madonna and Child&quot;, which was carved , while Edgar Sr.&#x27;s room includes two busts by Richmond Barthé. Edgar Jr.&#x27;s study includes a marble sculpture by Jean Arp and an abstract landscape by Lyonel Feininger. A portrait of Edgar Sr. by Victor Hammer hangs next to the dining area. The bottom of the house&#x27;s plunge pool contains Jacques Lipchitz&#x27;s sculpture &quot;Mother and Child.&quot; One of the house&#x27;s original artworks, &quot;The Horseman&quot; by Marino Marini, was destroyed in a 1956 flood.

The outbuildings and grounds have other pieces of art. The guesthouse includes woodblock prints and an 1877 landscape painting by José María Velasco Gómez, while the guest wing&#x27;s pool has an abstract sculpture by Peter Voulkos. The grounds also contain three sculptures by Mardonio Magaña, and there are also items such as a Hindu god&#x27;s head and a Buddha statue. Other artworks included a silk screen by Marcel Duchamp. After the WPC took over Fallingwater, the collection was expanded with murals and sculptures by Picasso, Lyonel Feininger, Luisa Rota, and Bryan Hunt. Edgar Jr. also donated some of his own books to the museum.

=== Tours and programs ===

The Western Pennsylvania Conservancy maintains Fallingwater, as well as the Bear Run Natural Area surrounding it. The WPC hosts tours of the house, which typically run between March and November of each year. In addition, during December, there are tours on weekends and during the last week of the year. There are several types of tours, which cover different parts of the house. Standard tours cover only part of the house and do not allow photography; however, photographs are permitted on extended tours through the whole house. There are also pre-recorded tours for non-English speakers. Every year in late August, the WPC hosts a &quot;twilight tour&quot; in which visitors can go on self-guided tours before attending a picnic and concert at sunset.

The conservancy operates the visitor pavilion. Young children, who cannot tour the house, stay at the visitor pavilion&#x27;s child-care center. Starting in the 1990s, the WPC sold furnishings based on the designs of Fallingwater&#x27;s furniture; these include chairs, coffee tables, and desks. Additionally, in the 2000s, the WPC sold jewelry with pieces of concrete that were removed from Fallingwater during its restoration. During the Christmas and holiday season, the Fallingwater Museum Store operates a temporary outpost in Downtown Pittsburgh. The WPC operates several educational programs for students and teachers as well. Starting in 2010, the WPC hosted sleepover events for adults at nearby Mill Run, which included private tours of Fallingwater.

=== Attendance ===
In its first two years as a museum, Fallingwater had 117,000 visitors from 66 countries and nearly every U.S. state. Initially, the busiest months for the house were September and October, in part because people came to see the foliage during the autumn. Many of the visitors are fans of Wright&#x27;s architecture. The museum&#x27;s visitors over the years have included U.S. second lady Joan Mondale, as well as the actors Anne Baxter, Brad Pitt, and Angelina Jolie.

The house accommodated 250,000 total visitors during the 1960s, and Fallingwater recorded a lifetime attendance of more than half a million by 1975, when it accommodated 62,000 visitors per year. One million people had visited the house by 1982; at the time, the house accommodated 120,000 visitors a year. One reporter estimated in 1989 that 15% of the house&#x27;s visitors were from foreign countries. Fallingwater continued to record nearly 130,000 annual visitors through the 1990s, and an Associated Press article from 1999 estimated that over 2.7 million people had visited the building ever since it opened to the public. &quot;Contract&quot; magazine said in 2001 that the house saw 140,000 visitors annually, though other sources from the 2000s put the annual visitor numbers at around 120,000. By the 2010s, annual visitation had reached 160,000. A 2022 article from &quot;The Architect&#x27;s Newspaper&quot; wrote that Fallingwater had seen 5 million visitors ever since its opening.

== Impact ==
Fallingwater was one of the world&#x27;s most-heavily-discussed modern–style structures by the 1960s, and it has been described as the world&#x27;s most famous private residence not belonging to a member of royalty. Though it is unknown whether Wright had an active role in publicizing Fallingwater, its fame helped revitalize Wright&#x27;s career. He went on to design 200 additional structures, though the Kaufmann family never rehired him. 

=== Reception ===

==== Mid-20th century ====
Upon Fallingwater&#x27;s completion, it received near-universal praise from American media publications as diverse as &quot;New Masses&quot; and &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot;. A writer for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot; in 1938 wrote that the use of contrasting materials, shapes, and tones &quot;add so much enchantment to the interior&quot;, while &quot;Time&quot; called Fallingwater Wright&#x27;s &quot;most beautiful job&quot;. &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; likened the horizontal terraces to an airplane and described the house as &quot;solid and sensible [...] aerated with imagination, with the spirit of the woods&quot;. Fallingwater was even praised by critics who disliked modern architecture, such as Talbot Hamlin, as well as in foreign publications. Only two architecture magazines—&quot;Charette&quot; and &quot;The Federal Architect&quot;—are known to have reviewed the house negatively upon its completion. For Fallingwater&#x27;s design, Wright received a silver medal from the Pan-American Congress of Architects in 1940.

The &quot;Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph&quot; wrote in 1941 that Fallingwater &quot;was for several years the prime example of modernism&quot;. Olgivanna Wright regarded Fallingwater as &quot;the most dramatic home my husband designed&quot;, saying that the house was the only Wright–designed building that many people could name. Nearly two decades after the house&#x27;s completion, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; described Fallingwater as &quot;a handsome and daring house&quot; in its own way but a &quot;monumental profanity&quot; with relation to the natural setting. When the house was turned over to the WPC, a writer for the &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; described the home as having a &quot;deeper beauty&quot;. &quot;Newsday&quot; praised the &quot;sheer poetry of&quot; the house&#x27;s existence, saying that the house blended with its natural surroundings, while a &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; writer said &quot;it could only have been built by an American, for an American&quot;. &quot;The Evening News&quot; wrote in 1974 that the house &quot;seems like it was built yesterday&quot;.
==== Late 20th century to present ====
A &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; writer, in 1981, praised both the house&#x27;s architecture and furnishings, regarding the Kaufmanns&#x27; possessions as giving Fallingwater a homey feel. &quot;The Patriot-News&quot; said that Fallingwater retained the character of a mountain lodge, and Thomas Hine of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; regarded the house as being simultaneously comfortable and rustic. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Fallingwater in 1991 as &quot;probably the most widely acclaimed modern residence in America&quot;. A writer for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; observed that the house was unusually cozy for a modern–styled house and that the rooms were not &quot;pretentious, grand or even luxurious&quot;. &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; architecture critic Ada Louise Huxtable wrote that the house &quot;surprises and inspires&quot; and that images of the house&#x27;s cantilevered terraces were iconic. A &quot;New York Times&quot; writer and Edwin Heathcote of the &quot;Financial Times&quot; both described Fallingwater as a rejoinder to the Bauhaus movement, while a writer for the &quot;National Post&quot; characterized the house as a summary of Wright&#x27;s design philosophy. Critics have also likened Fallingwater to an art piece, and the art historian Vincent Scully called it &quot;one of the complete masterpieces of twentieth-century art&quot;.

Several critics have written about the house&#x27;s relationship with nature. For example, writers for the &quot;Indiana Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the house as interpreting and adapting to its surroundings and to nature. &quot;The Hartford Courant&quot; said that, despite mixed reviews of Wright&#x27;s design philosophy, the house itself &quot;feels organic and inevitable&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that Fallingwater combined the natural environment and modern-style architecture. Blair Kamin wrote for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that the house &quot;appears to be in complete harmony with nature yet it also appears distinctly man-made&quot;. David Taylor of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; said the design &quot;gives fresh meaning to the phrase &#x27;living on the land, while &quot;Americas&quot; magazine called the house &quot;a universal icon of the persistent effort to achieve harmony with nature&quot;. Another writer for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; said that the house was &quot;abstract, bold, intellectually rigorous, formally unnatural&quot;, counterbalancing its surroundings. &quot;Smithsonian&quot; magazine said that the house &quot;evokes the American desire to exalt nature and dominate it, to claim modernity and reject it&quot;, while McCarter said the house &quot;appears to us to have grown out of the ground and into the light&quot;.

Not all commentary was positive. In 1997, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote that the house &quot;reeks of the architect&#x27;s arrogance, from the low ceilings (Wright himself was short) to the uneven floors&quot; and questioned whether the house&#x27;s high maintenance costs were worth it. William Thorsell wrote for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that the house &quot;turns its back to the landscape&quot; and that the terrace parapets, the built-in furniture, and the use of rock and dark wood gave the house &quot;a basement feeling&quot;. Thorsell felt that the house was in the wrong place because the waterfall, the site&#x27;s primary attraction, could not readily be seen from the house itself. A writer for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, viewed the house largely positively but regarded the house as being impractical for families, with little closet space.

==== Architectural recognition ====
American architects deemed Fallingwater one of &quot;seven wonders of American architecture&quot; in a 1958 survey. A 1976 poll of American-architecture experts ranked Fallingwater among the top four structures in the U.S., while a 1982 poll of &quot;&quot; readers ranked Fallingwater as the country&#x27;s best building. In a survey of 170 American Institute of Architects (AIA) fellows the next year, the building was ranked second on a list of the &quot;most successful examples of architectural design&quot;. AIA members voted Fallingwater the &quot;best all-time work of American architecture&quot; in 1991, and the AIA dubbed it the &quot;building of the century&quot; in 2000. AIA members also ranked Fallingwater 29th on the society&#x27;s &quot;America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot; list in 2007. &quot;Architectural Record&quot; named Fallingwater &quot;the world&#x27;s most significant building of the 20th century&quot;, and &quot;Smithsonian&quot; listed the house among its &quot;Life List of 28 Places to See Before You Die&quot; in 2008. &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that architects considered Fallingwater &quot;one of Wright&#x27;s supreme creations&quot;.

=== Media ===

Even before its completion, Fallingwater attracted sightseers and was the subject of news articles and photographs. The first newspaper articles to mention Fallingwater were published in Wisconsin in January 1937. The house gained more prominence in early 1938 following a MoMA exhibition and extensive media coverage, particularly in publications controlled by Henry Luce and William Randolph Hearst. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; wrote that the house attracted notice because of its unusual site. 

Over the years, there have been many books, articles, and studies on Fallingwater. NBC produced a television episode about Fallingwater in 1963, and the house appeared in an episode of the TV show &quot;American Life Style&quot; and the PBS television special &quot;Walt Harper at Fallingwater&quot; in 1972. Fallingwater was also the subject of a 1994 documentary film. produced by Kenneth Love and the WPC, and another documentary in 2011, also produced by Love. Several books have been written about Fallingwater, including &quot;Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Fallingwater&quot; (1978) by Donald Hoffmann, &quot;Fallingwater: A Frank Lloyd Wright Country House&quot; (1986) by Edgar Kaufmann Jr., &quot;Fallingwater: Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Romance with Nature&quot; (1996) by the WPC, and &quot;Fallingwater Rising&quot; (2001) by Franklin Toker. To celebrate the house&#x27;s 75th anniversary, another book about its history was published in 2011.

Photographs from downstream have been widely circulated. In addition, blueprints and letters from the house&#x27;s development have been sold over the years. Virtual tours of Fallingwater have been created as well. One such tour was released in CD format in 1997, and Love created a 3-D virtual tour of the house in the mid-2010s. The house has been commemorated in other media, such as a postage-stamp issue from 1982. Fallingwater has been depicted in several creative works. For example, it inspired the fictional Vandamm residence in the 1959 film &quot;North by Northwest&quot;, in addition to buildings in Ayn Rand&#x27;s 1943 novel &quot;The Fountainhead&quot; and its 1949 film adaptation. The conclusion of Greg Sestero&#x27;s 2021 film &quot;Miracle Valley&quot; was shot inside of Fallingwater; according to Sestero, it was the first feature film to be shot in the house.

=== Landmark designations ===
Fallingwater became a National Historic Landmark in 1966, and the house was separately added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission installed a historical marker in 1994 and named Fallingwater as a &quot;Commonwealth Treasure&quot; in October 2000. Fallingwater was deemed eligible for inclusion on UNESCO&#x27;s World Heritage List in 2008, and the United States Department of the Interior nominated Fallingwater to the World Heritage List in 2015, alongside nine other buildings. UNESCO ultimately added eight properties, including Fallingwater, to the World Heritage List in July 2019 under the title &quot;The 20th-Century Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright&quot;.

=== Exhibits and architectural influence ===
There have also been museum exhibits about Fallingwater. Among them was a MoMA exhibit in 1938, which was organized when MoMA curator John McAndrew visited the house shortly after its completion. MoMA hosted other exhibits featuring Fallingwater, including a scale model in 1940, an image showcase in 1959, and another model in 2009. New York&#x27;s Columbia University hosted a symposium on the structure in 1986, and Pittsburgh&#x27;s Carnegie Museum of Art and the State Museum of Pennsylvania have hosted exhibits about Fallingwater. In addition, the Miniature Railroad &amp; Village at Pittsburgh&#x27;s Carnegie Science Center displays a model of Fallingwater.

Despite Fallingwater&#x27;s renown, its design was seldom copied. At the time of the house&#x27;s completion, modernist architects were turning away from organic designs, such as Fallingwater, in favor of more industrial designs, such as New York&#x27;s Seagram Building. Among the structures inspired by Fallingwater are an office in Philadelphia; a gas station in the Washington metropolitan area; a home in Ross Township, Allegheny County; Paul Mayén&#x27;s home in Garrison, New York; and a house in North Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada.

<doc id="352702" wikidata="Q5167446" url="?curid=352702" title="Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm">
<text>The Cooley–Tukey algorithm, named after J. W. Cooley and John Tukey, is the most common fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm. It re-expresses the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of an arbitrary composite size formula_1 in terms of &quot;N&quot;1 smaller DFTs of sizes &quot;N&quot;2, recursively, to reduce the computation time to O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) for highly composite &quot;N&quot; (smooth numbers). Because of the algorithm&#x27;s importance, specific variants and implementation styles have become known by their own names, as described below.

Because the Cooley–Tukey algorithm breaks the DFT into smaller DFTs, it can be combined arbitrarily with any other algorithm for the DFT. For example, Rader&#x27;s or Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm can be used to handle large prime factors that cannot be decomposed by Cooley–Tukey, or the prime-factor algorithm can be exploited for greater efficiency in separating out relatively prime factors.

The algorithm, along with its recursive application, was invented by Carl Friedrich Gauss. Cooley and Tukey independently rediscovered and popularized it 160 years later.

== History ==
This algorithm, including its recursive application, was invented around 1805 by Carl Friedrich Gauss, who used it to interpolate the trajectories of the asteroids Pallas and Juno, but his work was not widely recognized (being published only posthumously and in Neo-Latin). Gauss did not analyze the asymptotic computational time, however. Various limited forms were also rediscovered several times throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries. FFTs became popular after James Cooley of IBM and John Tukey of Princeton published a paper in 1965 reinventing the algorithm and describing how to perform it conveniently on a computer.

Tukey reportedly came up with the idea during a meeting of President Kennedy&#x27;s Science Advisory Committee discussing ways to detect nuclear-weapon tests in the Soviet Union by employing seismometers located outside the country. These sensors would generate seismological time series. However, analysis of this data would require fast algorithms for computing DFTs due to the number of sensors and length of time. This task was critical for the ratification of the proposed nuclear test ban so that any violations could be detected without need to visit Soviet facilities. Another participant at that meeting, Richard Garwin of IBM, recognized the potential of the method and put Tukey in touch with Cooley. However, Garwin made sure that Cooley did not know the original purpose. Instead, Cooley was told that this was needed to determine periodicities of the spin orientations in a 3-D crystal of helium-3. Cooley and Tukey subsequently published their joint paper, and wide adoption quickly followed due to the simultaneous development of Analog-to-digital converters capable of sampling at rates up to 300 kHz.

The fact that Gauss had described the same algorithm (albeit without analyzing its asymptotic cost) was not realized until several years after Cooley and Tukey&#x27;s 1965 paper. Their paper cited as inspiration only the work by I. J. Good on what is now called the prime-factor FFT algorithm (PFA); although Good&#x27;s algorithm was initially thought to be equivalent to the Cooley–Tukey algorithm, it was quickly realized that PFA is a quite different algorithm (working only for sizes that have relatively prime factors and relying on the Chinese remainder theorem, unlike the support for any composite size in Cooley–Tukey).

== The radix-2 DIT case ==
A radix-2 decimation-in-time (DIT) FFT is the simplest and most common form of the Cooley–Tukey algorithm, although highly optimized Cooley–Tukey implementations typically use other forms of the algorithm as described below. Radix-2 DIT divides a DFT of size &quot;N&quot; into two interleaved DFTs (hence the name &quot;radix-2&quot;) of size &quot;N&quot;/2 with each recursive stage.

The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is defined by the formula:
:formula_2
where formula_3 is an integer ranging from 0 to formula_4.

Radix-2 DIT first computes the DFTs of the even-indexed inputs
formula_5
and of the odd-indexed inputs formula_6, and then combines those two results to produce the DFT of the whole sequence. This idea can then be performed recursively to reduce the overall runtime to O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;). This simplified form assumes that &quot;N&quot; is a power of two; since the number of sample points &quot;N&quot; can usually be chosen freely by the application (e.g. by changing the sample rate or window, zero-padding, etcetera), this is often not an important restriction.

The radix-2 DIT algorithm rearranges the DFT of the function formula_7 into two parts: a sum over the even-numbered indices formula_8 and a sum over the odd-numbered indices formula_9:

:formula_10

One can factor a common multiplier formula_11 out of the second sum, as shown in the equation below. It is then clear that the two sums are the DFT of the even-indexed part formula_12 and the DFT of odd-indexed part formula_13 of the function formula_7. Denote the DFT of the Even-indexed inputs formula_12 by formula_16 and the DFT of the Odd-indexed inputs formula_17 by formula_18 and we obtain:

:formula_19

Note that the equalities hold for formula_20, 
but the crux is that formula_16 and formula_18 are calculated in this way for formula_23 only.
Thanks to the periodicity of the complex exponential, formula_24 is also obtained from formula_16 and formula_18:

:formula_27

We can rewrite formula_28 and formula_29 as:
:formula_30

This result, expressing the DFT of length &quot;N&quot; recursively in terms of two DFTs of size &quot;N&quot;/2, is the core of the radix-2 DIT fast Fourier transform. The algorithm gains its speed by re-using the results of intermediate computations to compute multiple DFT outputs. Note that final outputs are obtained by a +/− combination of formula_16 and formula_32, which is simply a size-2 DFT (sometimes called a butterfly in this context); when this is generalized to larger radices below, the size-2 DFT is replaced by a larger DFT (which itself can be evaluated with an FFT).
This process is an example of the general technique of divide and conquer algorithms; in many conventional implementations, however, the explicit recursion is avoided, and instead one traverses the computational tree in breadth-first fashion.

The above re-expression of a size-&quot;N&quot; DFT as two size-&quot;N&quot;/2 DFTs is sometimes called the Danielson–Lanczos lemma, since the identity was noted by those two authors in 1942 (influenced by Runge&#x27;s 1903 work). They applied their lemma in a &quot;backwards&quot; recursive fashion, repeatedly &quot;doubling&quot; the DFT size until the transform spectrum converged (although they apparently didn&#x27;t realize the linearithmic [i.e., order &quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;] asymptotic complexity they had achieved). The Danielson–Lanczos work predated widespread availability of mechanical or electronic computers and required manual calculation (possibly with mechanical aids such as adding machines); they reported a computation time of 140 minutes for a size-64 DFT operating on real inputs to 3–5 significant digits. Cooley and Tukey&#x27;s 1965 paper reported a running time of 0.02 minutes for a size-2048 complex DFT on an IBM 7094 (probably in 36-bit single precision, ~8 digits). Rescaling the time by the number of operations, this corresponds roughly to a speedup factor of around 800,000. (To put the time for the hand calculation in perspective, 140 minutes for size 64 corresponds to an average of at most 16 seconds per floating-point operation, around 20% of which are multiplications.)

=== Pseudocode ===
In pseudocode, the below procedure could be written:

 &quot;X&quot;0...,&quot;N&quot;−1 ← ditfft2(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;s&quot;): &quot;DFT of (x&quot;0, &quot;xs&quot;, &quot;x&quot;2&quot;s&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;(&quot;N&quot;-1)&quot;s&quot;):
 if &quot;N&quot; = 1 then
 &quot;X&quot;0 ← &quot;x&quot;0 &quot;trivial size-1 DFT base case&quot;
 else
 &quot;X&quot;0...,&quot;N&quot;/2−1 ← ditfft2(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;N&quot;/2, 2&quot;s&quot;) &quot;DFT of (x&quot;0, &quot;x&quot;2&quot;s&quot;, &quot;x&quot;4&quot;s&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;(&quot;N&quot;-2)&quot;s&quot;)
 &quot;XN&quot;/2...,&quot;N&quot;−1 ← ditfft2(&quot;x&quot;+s, &quot;N&quot;/2, 2&quot;s&quot;) &quot;DFT of (xs&quot;, &quot;xs&quot;+2&quot;s&quot;, &quot;xs&quot;+4&quot;s&quot;, ..., &quot;x&quot;(&quot;N&quot;-1)&quot;s&quot;)
 k ← 0
 while k &lt; N/2 do &quot;combine DFTs of two halves into full DFT:&quot;
 p ← &quot;Xk&quot;
 q ← exp(−2π&quot;i&quot;/&quot;N&quot; &quot;k&quot;) &quot;Xk&quot;+&quot;N&quot;/2
 &quot;Xk&quot; ← p + q 
 &quot;Xk&quot;+&quot;N&quot;/2 ← p − q
 k ← k+1
 end for
 end if

Here, codice_1(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;N&quot;,1), computes &quot;X&quot;=DFT(&quot;x&quot;) out-of-place by a radix-2 DIT FFT, where &quot;N&quot; is an integer power of 2 and &quot;s&quot;=1 is the stride of the input &quot;x&quot; array. &quot;x&quot;+&quot;s&quot; denotes the array starting with &quot;xs&quot;.

(The results are in the correct order in &quot;X&quot; and no further bit-reversal permutation is required; the often-mentioned necessity of a separate bit-reversal stage only arises for certain in-place algorithms, as described below.)

High-performance FFT implementations make many modifications to the implementation of such an algorithm compared to this simple pseudocode. For example, one can use a larger base case than &quot;N&quot;=1 to amortize the overhead of recursion, the twiddle factors formula_33 can be precomputed, and larger radices are often used for cache reasons; these and other optimizations together can improve the performance by an order of magnitude or more. (In many textbook implementations the depth-first recursion is eliminated in favor of a nonrecursive breadth-first approach, although depth-first recursion has been argued to have better memory locality.) Several of these ideas are described in further detail below.

== Idea ==
More generally, Cooley–Tukey algorithms recursively re-express a DFT of a composite size &quot;N&quot; = &quot;N&quot;1&quot;N&quot;2 as:

# Perform &quot;N&quot;1 DFTs of size &quot;N&quot;2.
# Multiply by complex roots of unity (often called the twiddle factors).
# Perform &quot;N&quot;2 DFTs of size &quot;N&quot;1.

Typically, either &quot;N&quot;1 or &quot;N&quot;2 is a small factor (&quot;not&quot; necessarily prime), called the radix (which can differ between stages of the recursion). If &quot;N&quot;1 is the radix, it is called a decimation in time (DIT) algorithm, whereas if &quot;N&quot;2 is the radix, it is decimation in frequency (DIF, also called the Sande–Tukey algorithm). The version presented above was a radix-2 DIT algorithm; in the final expression, the phase multiplying the odd transform is the twiddle factor, and the +/- combination (&quot;butterfly&quot;) of the even and odd transforms is a size-2 DFT. (The radix&#x27;s small DFT is sometimes known as a butterfly, so-called because of the shape of the dataflow diagram for the radix-2 case.)

== Variations ==
There are many other variations on the Cooley–Tukey algorithm. Mixed-radix implementations handle composite sizes with a variety of (typically small) factors in addition to two, usually (but not always) employing the O(&quot;N&quot;2) algorithm for the prime base cases of the recursion (it is also possible to employ an &quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot; algorithm for the prime base cases, such as Rader&#x27;s or Bluestein&#x27;s algorithm). Split radix merges radices 2 and 4, exploiting the fact that the first transform of radix 2 requires no twiddle factor, in order to achieve what was long the lowest known arithmetic operation count for power-of-two sizes, although recent variations achieve an even lower count. (On present-day computers, performance is determined more by cache and CPU pipeline considerations than by strict operation counts; well-optimized FFT implementations often employ larger radices and/or hard-coded base-case transforms of significant size.).

Another way of looking at the Cooley–Tukey algorithm is that it re-expresses a size &quot;N&quot; one-dimensional DFT as an &quot;N&quot;1 by &quot;N&quot;2 two-dimensional DFT (plus twiddles), where the output matrix is transposed. The net result of all of these transpositions, for a radix-2 algorithm, corresponds to a bit reversal of the input (DIF) or output (DIT) indices. If, instead of using a small radix, one employs a radix of roughly and explicit input/output matrix transpositions, it is called a four-step FFT algorithm (or &quot;six-step&quot;, depending on the number of transpositions), initially proposed to improve memory locality, e.g. for cache optimization or out-of-core operation, and was later shown to be an optimal cache-oblivious algorithm.

The general Cooley–Tukey factorization rewrites the indices &quot;k&quot; and &quot;n&quot; as formula_34 and formula_35, respectively, where the indices &quot;k&quot;a and &quot;n&quot;a run from 0..&quot;N&quot;a-1 (for &quot;a&quot; of 1 or 2). That is, it re-indexes the input (&quot;n&quot;) and output (&quot;k&quot;) as &quot;N&quot;1 by &quot;N&quot;2 two-dimensional arrays in column-major and row-major order, respectively; the difference between these indexings is a transposition, as mentioned above. When this re-indexing is substituted into the DFT formula for &quot;nk&quot;, the formula_36 cross term vanishes (its exponential is unity), and the remaining terms give

:formula_37
::formula_38
::formula_39.

where each inner sum is a DFT of size &quot;N&quot;2, each outer sum is a DFT of size &quot;N&quot;1, and the [...] bracketed term is the twiddle factor.

An arbitrary radix &quot;r&quot; (as well as mixed radices) can be employed, as was shown by both Cooley and Tukey as well as Gauss (who gave examples of radix-3 and radix-6 steps). Cooley and Tukey originally assumed that the radix butterfly required O(&quot;r&quot;2) work and hence reckoned the complexity for a radix &quot;r&quot; to be O(&quot;r&quot;2 &quot;N&quot;/&quot;r&quot; log&quot;r&quot;&quot;N&quot;) = O(&quot;N&quot; log2(&quot;N&quot;) &quot;r&quot;/log2&quot;r&quot;); from calculation of values of &quot;r&quot;/log2&quot;r&quot; for integer values of &quot;r&quot; from 2 to 12 the optimal radix is found to be 3 (the closest integer to &quot;e&quot;, which minimizes &quot;r&quot;/log2&quot;r&quot;). This analysis was erroneous, however: the radix-butterfly is also a DFT and can be performed via an FFT algorithm in O(&quot;r&quot; log &quot;r&quot;) operations, hence the radix &quot;r&quot; actually cancels in the complexity O(&quot;r&quot; log(&quot;r&quot;) &quot;N&quot;/&quot;r&quot; log&quot;r&quot;&quot;N&quot;), and the optimal &quot;r&quot; is determined by more complicated considerations. In practice, quite large &quot;r&quot; (32 or 64) are important in order to effectively exploit e.g. the large number of processor registers on modern processors, and even an unbounded radix &quot;r&quot;= also achieves O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) complexity and has theoretical and practical advantages for large &quot;N&quot; as mentioned above.

== Data reordering, bit reversal, and in-place algorithms ==
Although the abstract Cooley–Tukey factorization of the DFT, above, applies in some form to all implementations of the algorithm, much greater diversity exists in the techniques for ordering and accessing the data at each stage of the FFT. Of special interest is the problem of devising an in-place algorithm that overwrites its input with its output data using only O(1) auxiliary storage.

The best-known reordering technique involves explicit bit reversal for in-place radix-2 algorithms. Bit reversal is the permutation where the data at an index &quot;n&quot;, written in binary with digits &quot;b&quot;4&quot;b&quot;3&quot;b&quot;2&quot;b&quot;1&quot;b&quot;0 (e.g. 5 digits for &quot;N&quot;=32 inputs), is transferred to the index with reversed digits &quot;b&quot;0&quot;b&quot;1&quot;b&quot;2&quot;b&quot;3&quot;b&quot;4 . Consider the last stage of a radix-2 DIT algorithm like the one presented above, where the output is written in-place over the input: when formula_16 and formula_18 are combined with a size-2 DFT, those two values are overwritten by the outputs. However, the two output values should go in the first and second &quot;halves&quot; of the output array, corresponding to the &quot;most&quot; significant bit &quot;b&quot;4 (for &quot;N&quot;=32); whereas the two inputs formula_16 and formula_18 are interleaved in the even and odd elements, corresponding to the &quot;least&quot; significant bit &quot;b&quot;0. Thus, in order to get the output in the correct place, &quot;b&quot;0 should take the place of &quot;b&quot;4 and the index becomes &quot;b&quot;0&quot;b&quot;4&quot;b&quot;3&quot;b&quot;2&quot;b&quot;1. And for next recursive stage, those 4 least significant bits will become &quot;b&quot;1&quot;b&quot;4&quot;b&quot;3&quot;b&quot;2, If you include all of the recursive stages of a radix-2 DIT algorithm, &quot;all&quot; the bits must be reversed and thus one must pre-process the input (&quot;or&quot; post-process the output) with a bit reversal to get in-order output. (If each size-&quot;N&quot;/2 subtransform is to operate on contiguous data, the DIT &quot;input&quot; is pre-processed by bit-reversal.) Correspondingly, if you perform all of the steps in reverse order, you obtain a radix-2 DIF algorithm with bit reversal in post-processing (or pre-processing, respectively).

The logarithm (log) used in this algorithm is a base 2 logarithm.

The following is pseudocode for iterative radix-2 FFT algorithm implemented using bit-reversal permutation.
 algorithm iterative-fft is
 input: Array &quot;a&quot; of &quot;n&quot; complex values where n is a power of 2.
 output: Array &quot;A&quot; the DFT of a.
 bit-reverse-copy(a, A)
 &quot;n&quot; ← &quot;a&quot;.length 
 for &quot;s&quot; = 1 to log(&quot;n&quot;) do
 &quot;m&quot; ← 2&quot;s&quot;
 &quot;ω&quot;&quot;m&quot; ← exp(−2π&quot;i&quot;/&quot;m&quot;) 
 for &quot;k&quot; = 0 to &quot;n&quot;-1 by &quot;m&quot; do
 &quot;ω&quot; ← 1
 for &quot;j&quot; = 0 to &quot;m&quot;/&quot;2&quot; – 1 do
 &quot;t&quot; ← &quot;ω&quot; &quot;A&quot;[&quot;k&quot; + &quot;j&quot; + &quot;m&quot;/2]
 &quot;u&quot; ← &quot;A&quot;[&quot;k&quot; + &quot;j&quot;]
 &quot;A&quot;[&quot;k&quot; + &quot;j&quot;] ← &quot;u&quot; + &quot;t&quot;
 &quot;A&quot;[&quot;k&quot; + &quot;j&quot; + &quot;m&quot;/2] ← &quot;u&quot; – &quot;t&quot;
 &quot;ω&quot; ← &quot;ω&quot; &quot;ω&quot;&quot;m&quot;
 return &quot;A&quot;

The bit-reverse-copy procedure can be implemented as follows.
 algorithm bit-reverse-copy(&quot;a&quot;,&quot;A&quot;) is
 input: Array &quot;a&quot; of &quot;n&quot; complex values where n is a power of 2.
 output: Array &quot;A&quot; of size &quot;n&quot;.
 &quot;n&quot; ← &quot;a&quot;.length
 for &quot;k&quot; = 0 &quot;to&quot; &quot;n&quot; – 1 do
 &quot;A&quot;[rev(k)] := &quot;a&quot;[k]

Alternatively, some applications (such as convolution) work equally well on bit-reversed data, so one can perform forward transforms, processing, and then inverse transforms all without bit reversal to produce final results in the natural order.

Many FFT users, however, prefer natural-order outputs, and a separate, explicit bit-reversal stage can have a non-negligible impact on the computation time, even though bit reversal can be done in O(&quot;N&quot;) time and has been the subject of much research. Also, while the permutation is a bit reversal in the radix-2 case, it is more generally an arbitrary (mixed-base) digit reversal for the mixed-radix case, and the permutation algorithms become more complicated to implement. Moreover, it is desirable on many hardware architectures to re-order intermediate stages of the FFT algorithm so that they operate on consecutive (or at least more localized) data elements. To these ends, a number of alternative implementation schemes have been devised for the Cooley–Tukey algorithm that do not require separate bit reversal and/or involve additional permutations at intermediate stages.

The problem is greatly simplified if it is out-of-place: the output array is distinct from the input array or, equivalently, an equal-size auxiliary array is available. The algorithm performs every stage of the FFT out-of-place, typically writing back and forth between two arrays, transposing one &quot;digit&quot; of the indices with each stage, and has been especially popular on SIMD architectures. Even greater potential SIMD advantages (more consecutive accesses) have been proposed for the Pease algorithm, which also reorders out-of-place with each stage, but this method requires separate bit/digit reversal and O(&quot;N&quot; log &quot;N&quot;) storage. One can also directly apply the Cooley–Tukey factorization definition with explicit (depth-first) recursion and small radices, which produces natural-order out-of-place output with no separate permutation step (as in the pseudocode above) and can be argued to have cache-oblivious locality benefits on systems with hierarchical memory.

A typical strategy for in-place algorithms without auxiliary storage and without separate digit-reversal passes involves small matrix transpositions (which swap individual pairs of digits) at intermediate stages, which can be combined with the radix butterflies to reduce the number of passes over the data.

<text>Andrew Hill (June 30, 1931 – April 20, 2007) was an American jazz pianist and composer.

Jazz critic John Fordham described Hill as a &quot;uniquely gifted composer, pianist and educator&quot; although &quot;his status remained largely inside knowledge in the jazz world for most of his career.&quot;

Hill recorded for Blue Note Records for nearly a decade, producing a dozen albums.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Hill was born in Chicago, Illinois, to William and Hattie Hill. He had a brother, Robert, who was a singer and classical violin player. Hill took up the piano at the age of thirteen, and was encouraged by Earl Hines. As a child, he attended the University of Chicago Experimental School. He was referred by jazz composer Bill Russo to Paul Hindemith, with whom he studied informally until 1952.

While a teenager, he performed in rhythm and blues bands and with touring jazz musicians, including Charlie Parker and Miles Davis. Hill recalls some of his experience as a youngster, during a 1964 interview with Leonard Feather: &quot;I started out in music as a boy soprano, singing and playing the accordion, and tap dancing. I had a little act and made quite a few of the talent shows around town from 1943 until 1947. I won turkeys at two Thanksgiving parties at the Regal Theatre,&quot; parties sponsored by the newspaper &quot;Chicago Defender&quot;, which Hill coincidentally used to sell on the streets.

===Career===
In 1950, Hill learned his first blues changes on the piano from the saxophonist Pat Patrick and in 1953, he played his first professional job as a musician, with Paul Williams&#x27; band. &quot;At that time&quot;, he recalls, &quot;I was playing baritone sax as well as piano.&quot; During the next few years, the piano gigs brought him into contact with many musicians, some of whom became relevant influences: Joe Segal and Barry Harris, among others. In 1961, after travelling as an accompanist for Dinah Washington, the young pianist settled in New York City in 1961, where he worked for Johnny Hartman and Al Hibbler, then briefly moved to Los Angeles County, where he worked with Roland Kirk&#x27;s quartet and at the jazz club Lighthouse Café, in Hermosa Beach.

Hill first recorded as a sideman in 1954, but his reputation was made by his Blue Note recordings as leader from 1963 to 1970, which featured several other important post-bop musicians including Joe Chambers, Richard Davis, Eric Dolphy, Bobby Hutcherson, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Elvin Jones, Woody Shaw, Tony Williams, and John Gilmore. Hill also played on albums by Henderson, Hutcherson, and Hank Mobley. His compositions accounted for three of the five pieces on Bobby Hutcherson&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot; album.

Hill rarely worked as a sideman after the 1960s, preferring to play his own compositions. This may have limited his public exposure. He later taught in California and held a tenure-track faculty appointment at Portland State University from 1989 to 1996. While at PSU, he established a Summer Jazz Intensive program, in addition to performing, conducting workshops and attending residencies at Wesleyan University, the University of Michigan, the University of Toronto, Harvard University, Bennington College and other schools.

Hill&#x27;s album &quot;Dusk&quot; was selected best album of 2001 by both &quot;DownBeat&quot; and &quot;JazzTimes&quot;; and in 2003, Hill received the Jazzpar Prize. Hill&#x27;s earlier work also received renewed attention as a result of the belated release of several unissued sessions recorded in the 1960s for Blue Note, notably the ambitious large-group date &quot;Passing Ships&quot;. In 2004, he appeared on &quot;&quot;. As a consequence of his renewed prominence, a new Blue Note album titled &quot;Time Lines&quot; was released on February 21, 2006.

His final public performance was on March 29, 2007, at Trinity Church in New York City.

==Private life==
It was while working at the Lighthouse Café, in Hermosa Beach that he met his future wife, Laverne Gillette, at the time an organist at the Red Carpet. They married in 1963 and moved to New York.

Laverne died following a long illness in California, where the couple had settled, in 1989. He married dancer/educator Joanne Robinson Hill in Portland in 1992. They moved to New York City in 1995. From 2000, Hill and his wife lived in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Andrew Hill suffered from lung cancer during the last years of his life. He died at his home in Jersey City, New Jersey.

In May 2007, he became the first person to receive a posthumous honorary doctorate from Berklee College of Music.

==Playing style==
Hill&#x27;s main influences were pianists Thelonious Monk, Bud Powell and Art Tatum. &quot;Monk&#x27;s like Ravel and Debussy to me, in that he put a lot of personality into his playing [...] it&#x27;s the personality of music which makes it, finally,&quot; he said in a 1963 interview with A. B. Spellman. Powell was an even greater influence, but Hill thought that his music was a dead end: &quot;If you stay with Bud too much, you&#x27;ll always sound like him, even if you&#x27;re doing something he never did.&quot; Hill referred to Tatum as the epitome of &quot;all modern piano playing&quot;.

<doc id="352708" wikidata="Q1067935" url="?curid=352708" title="Université Laval">
<text> (; English: &quot;Laval University)&quot; is a public research university in Quebec City, Quebec, Canada. The university traces its roots to the Séminaire de Québec, founded by François de Montmorency-Laval in 1663, making it the oldest institution of higher education in Canada and the first North American institution to offer higher education in French. The university, which was founded in Old Québec, moved to a new campus in the 1950s in the suburban borough of Sainte-Foy–Sillery–Cap-Rouge. It is ranked among the top 10 Canadian universities in research funding and holds four Canada Excellence Research Chairs.

==History==


The university&#x27;s beginnings go back to 1663 with the founding of the Grand and 1668 with the founding of the Petit Séminaire by François de Montmorency-Laval, a member of the House of Laval and the first Bishop of New France.

During the French regime, the institution mainly trained priests to serve in New France. After the Conquest of 1760, the British expanded education in Canada to include the liberal arts. French Canadians had at the time no opportunity to pursue higher education, and Bishop Bourget of Montreal suggested expanding the into . Louis Casault, a priest who taught physics at the , went to Europe to seek a royal charter and study the best university systems there.

The was granted a royal charter on December 8, 1852, by Queen Victoria, at the request of Lord Elgin, then Governor-General of the Province of Canada. Through the charter, the was created with &quot;the rights and privileges of a university&quot;. Pope Benedict XV approved the plan and authorized the institution to establish chairs of theology and confer degrees.

In 1878, the university opened a second campus in Montreal, which became the on May 8, 1919, by a writ of Pope Benedict XV. In 1971, a second charter transferred all authority to the council.

By 1925, the university had outgrown its location. The Old City was very crowded, making it difficult to add new buildings to the campus. The university moved to Sainte-Foy in the 1950s, which at the time was a semi-rural community west of the Quebec city centre. The School of Architecture returned to the old building (now affectionately referred to as &quot;Le Vieux Séminaire&quot;) in 1989.

 is governed by a board of governors and a faculty senate. This structure was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906, which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to serve as a link between the two bodies and lead the institution.

In the early part of the 20th century, the need for higher education expanded beyond the classical fields of theology, law and medicine, and the university introduced science and social-science departments such as forestry and household science. In addition, graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.

&quot;Laval&quot;, a waltz by French-Canadian ragtime composer Wilfrid Beaudry, was dedicated to the students at Laval University and the University of Montreal. The music for piano was published in Quebec by J. Beaudry, circa 1906.

In 1929, the Quebec Seminary was designated as a national historic site of Canada.

The university opened its department of social, political, and economic sciences in 1938, signalling a change of approach that continued into the 1960s, based on an idea of higher education as the key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and society.

The royal charter that founded in 1852 was designated a National Historic Event in 1972. This location, at 1 rue des Remparts, Quebec, still continues operation as a centre for educating Roman Catholic priests. A section of the Vieux Séminaire has been the location for the Université&#x27;s school of architecture since 1987. The Camille-Roy pavilion houses the restored Promotions Room, which can be rented as a venue for various types of events.

In 2017, the university became the first in Canada to divest its endowment from fossil fuel companies.

==Buildings and features==
After it was granted a university charter, several buildings were built in Old Quebec, including the School of Chemistry (1923), the addition on Ste. Famille Street (1931), the Mining School (1938), and the cafeteria building (1945), all by architect Joseph Simeon Bergeron. However, the neighbourhood was already crowded and activities later moved in nearby Sainte-Foy, which was more spacious.

===Campus building===
Today&#x27;s campus covers and has over 30 buildings (also called &quot;pavillons&quot;), including many iconic exemplars of modern architecture. Its earliest buildings and landscapes were designed by Edouard Fiset (fr) from the 1950s, and of its lands, 56 percent are wooded areas, grasslands, and sports fields .
===Other infrastructure===
Practically all buildings are linked by of underground walkways, which are particularly useful in the winter and whose walls are mostly covered by murals painted by student associations and student visitors over the years, as well as graffiti. The campus is also home to the &quot;Roger-Van den Hende&quot; botanical garden (fr) which contains some 67 species of deciduous and coniferous trees and 60 different species of birds. The Louis-Jacques-Casault building also hosts the regional branch of the National Archives of Quebec. The sport building is called PEPS and is said to be the largest sport complex in eastern Canada. It is adjacent to the covered TELUS stadium. Construction for the Telus stadium started in 2010 and was opened to the public in January 2012 (fr).
===Off campus===
Apart from the school of architecture, located in Old Quebec since 1988, the only out of campus facilities are the school of visual arts in the downtown neighbourhood of Saint-Roch, and the experimental ( north of Quebec City). 
==Programs==
As of 2002, Université Laval offered over 350 programs to more than 38,000 students. The university also attracts more than 2,500 foreign students annually, and has almost 1,000 students drawn from Canadian provinces outside of Quebec. Many students come to the university for the &quot;Français pour non-francophones&quot; program that offers instruction in French as a second language to students from Canada and around the world. It is also the only university in Quebec which trains forestry engineers. Since the mid-1980s, Université Laval has offered distance learning; over 30 programs and 400 courses are offered by distance learning, of which 80% are accessible from the internet.

==Faculties and schools==


==Research==
Université Laval holds four of the 19 Canada Excellence Research Chairs awarded nationwide: Canada Excellence Research Chair in Remote Sensing of Canada&#x27;s New Arctic Frontier, Canada Research Excellence Chair in the Microbiome-Endocannabinoidome Axis in Metabolic Health, Canada Excellence Research Chair in Photonic Innovations, and Communication and Canada Excellence Research Chair in Neurophotonics. The university has also received research funding from Huawei but has kept the details of the funding confidential.

==University press==
Les Presses de l&#x27;Université Laval (University Press), which was founded in 1950, deals with Canadian civilization, literature, medieval studies, law, social sciences, physical sciences and engineering. It publishes some 120 books per year.

==University cooperative==

The Coopérative de l&#x27;Université Laval (University Co-op) is engaged in the sale of products to customers throughout the university, such as books, lecture notes and computers. They have two locations. One is on campus in the administrative building and the other near La Fabrique, the Arts building in Old Québec.

==Athletics and sports teams==

Athletics take place at the Pavillon d&#x27;éducation physique et des sports (Physical Education and Sports Complex), in short PEPS. Laval&#x27;s varsity sports teams are named the Rouge-et-Or (Red &amp; Gold).

<text>In cryptography, a Feistel cipher (also known as Luby–Rackoff block cipher) is a symmetric structure used in the construction of block ciphers, named after the German-born physicist and cryptographer Horst Feistel, who did pioneering research while working for IBM; it is also commonly known as a Feistel network. A large number of block ciphers use the scheme, including the US Data Encryption Standard, the Soviet/Russian GOST and the more recent Blowfish and Twofish ciphers. In a Feistel cipher, encryption and decryption are very similar operations, and both consist of iteratively running a function called a &quot;round function&quot; a fixed number of times.

==History==
Many modern symmetric block ciphers are based on Feistel networks. Feistel networks were first seen commercially in IBM&#x27;s Lucifer cipher, designed by Horst Feistel and Don Coppersmith in 1973. Feistel networks gained respectability when the U.S. Federal Government adopted the DES (a cipher based on Lucifer, with changes made by the NSA) in 1976. Like other components of the DES, the iterative nature of the Feistel construction makes implementing the cryptosystem in hardware easier (particularly on the hardware available at the time of DES&#x27;s design).

==Design==
A Feistel network uses a &quot;round function&quot;, a function which takes two inputs a data block and a subkey and returns one output of the same size as the data block. In each round, the round function is run on half of the data to be encrypted, and its output is XORed with the other half of the data. This is repeated a fixed number of times, and the final output is the encrypted data. An important advantage of Feistel networks compared to other cipher designs such as substitution–permutation networks is that the entire operation is guaranteed to be invertible (that is, encrypted data can be decrypted), even if the round function is not itself invertible. The round function can be made arbitrarily complicated, since it does not need to be designed to be invertible. Furthermore, the encryption and decryption operations are very similar, even identical in some cases, requiring only a reversal of the key schedule. Therefore, the size of the code or circuitry required to implement such a cipher is nearly halved. Unlike substitution-permutation networks, Feistel networks also do not depend on a substitution box that could cause timing side-channels in software implementations.

==Theoretical work==
The structure and properties of Feistel ciphers have been extensively analyzed by cryptographers.

Michael Luby and Charles Rackoff analyzed the Feistel cipher construction and proved that if the round function is a cryptographically secure pseudorandom function, with &quot;Ki&quot; used as the seed, then 3 rounds are sufficient to make the block cipher a pseudorandom permutation, while 4 rounds are sufficient to make it a &quot;strong&quot; pseudorandom permutation (which means that it remains pseudorandom even to an adversary who gets oracle access to its inverse permutation). Because of this very important result of Luby and Rackoff, Feistel ciphers are sometimes called Luby–Rackoff block ciphers.

Further theoretical work has generalized the construction somewhat and given more precise bounds for security.

==Construction details==

Let formula_1 be the round function and let formula_2 be the sub-keys for the rounds formula_3 respectively.

Then the basic operation is as follows:

Split the plaintext block into two equal pieces: (formula_4, formula_5).

For each round formula_6, compute

: formula_7
: formula_8

where formula_9 means XOR. Then the ciphertext is formula_10.

Decryption of a ciphertext formula_10 is accomplished by computing for formula_12

: formula_13
: formula_14

Then formula_15 is the plaintext again.

The diagram illustrates both encryption and decryption. Note the reversal of the subkey order for decryption; this is the only difference between encryption and decryption.

===Unbalanced Feistel cipher===
Unbalanced Feistel ciphers use a modified structure where formula_4 and formula_5 are not of equal lengths. The Skipjack cipher is an example of such a cipher. The Texas Instruments digital signature transponder uses a proprietary unbalanced Feistel cipher to perform challenge–response authentication.

The Thorp shuffle is an extreme case of an unbalanced Feistel cipher in which one side is a single bit. This has better provable security than a balanced Feistel cipher but requires more rounds.

===Other uses===
The Feistel construction is also used in cryptographic algorithms other than block ciphers. For example, the optimal asymmetric encryption padding (OAEP) scheme uses a simple Feistel network to randomize ciphertexts in certain asymmetric-key encryption schemes.

A generalized Feistel algorithm can be used to create strong permutations on small domains of size not a power of two (see format-preserving encryption).

===Feistel networks as a design component===
Whether the entire cipher is a Feistel cipher or not, Feistel-like networks can be used as a component of a cipher&#x27;s design. For example, MISTY1 is a Feistel cipher using a three-round Feistel network in its round function, Skipjack is a modified Feistel cipher using a Feistel network in its G permutation, and Threefish (part of Skein) is a non-Feistel block cipher that uses a Feistel-like MIX function.

<text>A zoom lens is a system of camera lens elements for which the focal length (and thus angle of view) can be varied, as opposed to a fixed-focal-length (FFL) lens (&quot;prime lens&quot;).
A true zoom lens or optical zoom lens is a type of &quot;parfocal lens&quot;, one that maintains focus when its focal length changes. Most consumer zoom lenses do not maintain perfect focus, but are still nearly parfocal. Most camera phones that are advertised as having optical zoom actually use a few cameras of different but fixed focal length, combined with digital zoom to make a hybrid system.
The convenience of variable focal length comes at the cost of complexity – and some compromises on image quality, weight, dimensions, aperture, autofocus performance, and cost. For example, all zoom lenses suffer from at least slight, if not considerable, loss of image resolution at their maximum aperture, especially at the extremes of their focal length range. This effect is evident in the corners of the image, when displayed in a large format or high resolution. The greater the range of focal length a zoom lens offers, the more exaggerated these compromises must become.

==Characteristics==

Zoom lenses are often described by the ratio of their longest to shortest focal lengths. For example, a zoom lens with focal lengths ranging from 100 mm to 400 mm may be described as a 4:1 or &quot;4×&quot; zoom. The term superzoom or hyperzoom is used to describe photographic zoom lenses with very large focal length factors, typically more than 5× and ranging up to 19× in SLR camera lenses and 22× in amateur digital cameras. This ratio can be as high as 300× in professional television camera lenses. As of 2009, photographic zoom lenses beyond about 3× cannot generally produce imaging quality on par with prime lenses. Constant fast aperture zooms (usually 2.8 or 2.0) are typically restricted to this zoom range. Quality degradation is less perceptible when recording moving images at low resolution, which is why professional video and TV lenses are able to feature high zoom ratios. High zoom ratio TV lenses are complex, with dozens of optical elements, often weighing more than . Digital photography can also accommodate algorithms that compensate for optical flaws, both within in-camera processors and post-production software.

Some photographic zoom lenses are long-focus lenses, with focal lengths longer than a normal lens, some are wide-angle lenses (wider than &quot;normal&quot;), and others cover a range from wide-angle to long-focus. Lenses in the latter group of zoom lenses, sometimes referred to as &quot;normal&quot; zooms, have displaced the fixed focal length lens as the popular one-lens selection on many contemporary cameras. The markings on these lenses usually say W and T for &quot;Wide&quot; and &quot;Telephoto&quot;. Telephoto is designated because the longer focal length supplied by the negative diverging lens is longer than the overall lens assembly (the negative diverging lens acting as the &quot;telephoto group&quot;).

Some digital cameras allow cropping and enlarging of a captured image, in order to emulate the effect of a longer focal length zoom lens (narrower angle of view). This is commonly known as digital zoom and produces an image of lower optical resolution than optical zoom. Exactly the same effect can be obtained by using digital image processing software on a computer to crop the digital image and enlarge the cropped area. Many digital cameras have both, combining them by first using the optical, then the digital zoom.

Zoom and superzoom lenses are commonly used with still, video, motion picture cameras, projectors, some binoculars, microscopes, telescopes, telescopic sights, and other optical instruments. In addition, the afocal part of a zoom lens can be used as a telescope of variable magnification to make an adjustable beam expander. This can be used, for example, to change the size of a laser beam so that the irradiance of the beam can be varied.

==History==
Early forms of zoom lenses were used in optical telescopes to provide continuous variation of the magnification of the image, and this was first reported in the proceedings of the Royal Society in 1834. Early patents for telephoto lenses also included movable lens elements which could be adjusted to change the overall focal length of the lens. Lenses of this kind are now called varifocal lenses, since when the focal length is changed, the position of the focal plane also moves, requiring refocusing of the lens after each change.

The first true &quot;zoom&quot; lens, which retained near-sharp focus while the effective focal length of the lens assembly was changed, was patented in 1902 by Clile C. Allen (). An early use of the zoom lens in cinema can be seen in the opening shot of the movie &quot;It&quot; starring Clara Bow, from 1927. The first industrial production was the Bell and Howell Cooke &quot;Varo&quot; 40–120 mm lens for 35mm movie cameras introduced in 1932. The most impressive early TV Zoom lens was the VAROTAL III, from Rank Taylor Hobson from UK built in 1953.
The Kilfitt 36–82 mm/2.8 Zoomar lens introduced in 1959 was the first varifocal lens in regular production for still 35mm photography. The first modern film zoom lens, the Pan-Cinor, was designed around 1950 by Roger Cuvillier, a French engineer working for SOM-Berthiot. It had an optical compensation zoom system. In 1956, Pierre Angénieux introduced the mechanical compensation system, enabling precise focus while zooming, in his 17-68mm lens for 16mm released in 1958. The same year a prototype of the 35mm version of the Angénieux 4x zoom, the 35-140mm was first used by cinematographer Roger Fellous for the production of Julie La Rousse. Angénieux received a 1964 technical award from the academy of motion pictures for the design of the 10 to 1 zoom lenses, including the 12-120mm for 16mm film cameras and the 25-250mm for 35mm film cameras.

Because of their relative bulk, it wasn&#x27;t until as recently as 1986 that a zoom lens was designed with sufficiently compact dimensions and finally found its way into a consumer compact (point and shoot) camera, this being the Pentax Zoom 70.

Since then advances in optical lens design, particularly the use of computers for optical ray tracing, has made the design and construction of zoom lenses much easier, and they are now used widely in professional and amateur photography.

==Design==
There are many possible designs for zoom lenses, the most complex ones having upwards of thirty individual lens elements and multiple moving parts. Most, however, follow the same basic design. Generally they consist of a number of individual lenses that may be either fixed or slide axially along the body of the lens. While the magnification of a zoom lens changes, it is necessary to compensate for any movement of the focal plane to keep the focused image sharp. This compensation may be done by mechanical means (moving the complete lens assembly while the magnification of the lens changes) or optically (arranging the position of the focal plane to vary as little as possible while the lens is zoomed).

A simple scheme for a zoom lens divides the assembly into two parts: a focusing lens similar to a standard, fixed-focal-length photographic lens, preceded by an &quot;afocal zoom system&quot;, an arrangement of fixed and movable lens elements that does not focus the light, but alters the size of a beam of light travelling through it, and thus the overall magnification of the lens system.
In this simple optically compensated zoom lens, the afocal system consists of two positive (converging) lenses of equal focal length (lenses &quot;L&quot;1 and &quot;L&quot;3) with a negative (diverging) lens (&quot;L&quot;2) between them, with an absolute focal length less than half that of the positive lenses. Lens &quot;L&quot;3 is fixed, but lenses &quot;L&quot;1 and &quot;L&quot;2 can be moved axially in a particular non-linear relationship. This movement is usually performed by a complex arrangement of gears and cams in the lens housing, although some modern zoom lenses use computer-controlled servos to perform this positioning.

While the negative lens &quot;L&quot;2 moves from the front to the back of the lens, the lens &quot;L&quot;1 moves forward and then backward in a parabolic arc. In doing so, the overall angular magnification of the system varies, changing the effective focal length of the complete zoom lens. At each of the three points shown, the three-lens system is afocal (neither diverging or converging the light), and hence does not alter the position of the focal plane of the lens. Between these points, the system is not exactly afocal, but the variation in focal plane position can be small enough (about ±0.01 mm in a well-designed lens) not to make a significant change to the sharpness of the image.

An important issue in zoom lens design is the correction of optical aberrations (such as chromatic aberration and, in particular, field curvature) across the whole operating range of the lens; this is considerably harder in a zoom lens than a fixed lens, which needs only to correct the aberrations for one focal length. This problem was a major reason for the slow uptake of zoom lenses, with early designs being considerably inferior to contemporary fixed lenses and usable only with a narrow range of f-numbers. Modern optical design techniques have enabled the construction of zoom lenses with good aberration correction over widely variable focal lengths and apertures.

Whereas lenses used in cinematography and video applications are required to maintain focus while the focal length is changed, there is no such requirement for still photography and for zoom lenses used as projection lenses. Since it is harder to construct a lens that does not change focus with the same image quality as one that does, the latter applications often use lenses that require refocusing once the focal length has changed (and thus strictly speaking are varifocal lenses, not zoom lenses). As most modern still cameras are autofocusing, this is not a problem.

Designers of zoom lenses with large zoom ratios often trade one or more aberrations for higher image sharpness. For example, a greater degree of barrel and pincushion distortion is tolerated in lenses that span the focal length range from wide angle to telephoto with a focal ratio of 10× or more than would be acceptable in a fixed focal length lens or a zoom lens with a lower ratio. Although modern design methods have been continually reducing this problem, barrel distortion of greater than one percent is common in these large-ratio lenses. Another price paid is that at the extreme telephoto setting of the lens the effective focal length changes significantly while the lens is focused on closer objects. The apparent focal length can more than halve while the lens is focused from infinity to medium close-up. To a lesser degree, this effect is also seen in fixed focal length lenses that move internal lens elements, rather than the entire lens, to effect changes in magnification.

==Varifocal lens==
Many so-called &quot;zoom&quot; lenses, particularly in the case of fixed-lens cameras, are actually &quot;varifocal lenses&quot;, which gives lens designers more flexibility in optical design trade-offs (focal length range, maximal aperture, size, weight, cost) than true parfocal zoom, and which is practical because of autofocus, and because the camera processor can move the lens to compensate for the change in the position of the focal plane while changing magnification (&quot;zooming&quot;), making operation essentially the same as a true parfocal zoom.

<doc id="352714" wikidata="Q2520842" url="?curid=352714" title="Germ (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, the notion of a germ of an object in/on a topological space is an equivalence class of that object and others of the same kind that captures their shared local properties. In particular, the objects in question are mostly functions (or maps) and subsets. In specific implementations of this idea, the functions or subsets in question will have some property, such as being analytic or smooth, but in general this is not needed (the functions in question need not even be continuous); it is however necessary that the space on/in which the object is defined is a topological space, in order that the word &quot;local&quot; has some meaning.

==Name==
The name is derived from &quot;cereal germ&quot; in a continuation of the sheaf metaphor, as a germ is (locally) the &quot;heart&quot; of a function, as it is for a grain.

==Formal definition==

===Basic definition===

Given a point &quot;x&quot; of a topological space &quot;X&quot;, and two maps formula_1 (where &quot;Y&quot; is any set), then formula_2 and formula_3 define the same germ at &quot;x&quot; if there is a neighbourhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that restricted to &quot;U&quot;, &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are equal; meaning that formula_4 for all &quot;u&quot; in &quot;U&quot;.

Similarly, if &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are any two subsets of &quot;X&quot;, then they define the same germ at &quot;x&quot; if there is again a neighbourhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that

:formula_5

It is straightforward to see that &quot;defining the same germ&quot; at &quot;x&quot; is an equivalence relation (be it on maps or sets), and the equivalence classes are called germs (map-germs, or set-germs accordingly). The equivalence relation is usually written

:formula_6

Given a map &quot;f&quot; on &quot;X&quot;, then its germ at &quot;x&quot; is usually denoted [&quot;f&quot;]&quot;x&quot;. Similarly, the germ at &quot;x&quot; of a set &quot;S&quot; is written [&quot;S&quot;]&quot;x&quot;. Thus,

:formula_7

A map germ at &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; that maps the point &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; to the point &quot;y&quot; in &quot;Y&quot; is denoted as

:formula_8

When using this notation, &quot;f&quot; is then intended as an entire equivalence class of maps, using the same letter &quot;f&quot; for any representative map.

Notice that two sets are germ-equivalent at &quot;x&quot; if and only if their characteristic functions are germ-equivalent at &quot;x&quot;:

:formula_9

===More generally===
Maps need not be defined on all of &quot;X&quot;, and in particular they don&#x27;t need to have the same domain. However, if &quot;f&quot; has domain &quot;S&quot; and &quot;g&quot; has domain &quot;T&quot;, both subsets of &quot;X&quot;, then &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are germ equivalent at &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot; if first &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are germ equivalent at &quot;x&quot;, say formula_10 and then moreover formula_11, for some smaller neighbourhood &quot;V&quot; with formula_12. This is particularly relevant in two settings: 
# &quot;f&quot; is defined on a subvariety &quot;V&quot; of &quot;X&quot;, and 
# &quot;f&quot; has a pole of some sort at &quot;x&quot;, so is not even defined at &quot;x&quot;, as for example a rational function, which would be defined &quot;off&quot; a subvariety.

===Basic properties===
If &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are germ equivalent at &quot;x&quot;, then they share all local properties, such as continuity, differentiability etc., so it makes sense to talk about a &quot;differentiable or analytic germ&quot;, etc. Similarly for subsets: if one representative of a germ is an analytic set then so are all representatives, at least on some neighbourhood of &quot;x&quot;.

Algebraic structures on the target &quot;Y&quot; are inherited by the set of germs with values in &quot;Y&quot;. For instance, if the target &quot;Y&quot; is a group, then it makes sense to multiply germs: to define [&quot;f&quot;]&quot;x&quot;[&quot;g&quot;]&quot;x&quot;, first take representatives &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot;, defined on neighbourhoods &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; respectively, and define [&quot;f&quot;]&quot;x&quot;[&quot;g&quot;]&quot;x&quot; to be the germ at &quot;x&quot; of the pointwise product map &quot;fg&quot; (which is defined on formula_13). In the same way, if &quot;Y&quot; is an abelian group, vector space, or ring, then so is the set of germs.

The set of germs at &quot;x&quot; of maps from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; does not have a useful topology, except for the discrete one. It therefore makes little or no sense to talk of a convergent sequence of germs. However, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are manifolds, then the spaces of jets formula_14 (finite order Taylor series at &quot;x&quot; of map(-germs)) do have topologies as they can be identified with finite-dimensional vector spaces.

==Relation with sheaves==
The idea of germs is behind the definition of sheaves and presheaves. A presheaf formula_15 of abelian groups on a topological space &quot;X&quot; assigns an abelian group formula_16 to each open set &quot;U&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. Typical examples of abelian groups here are: real-valued functions on &quot;U&quot;, differential forms on &quot;U&quot;, vector fields on &quot;U&quot;, holomorphic functions on &quot;U&quot; (when &quot;X&quot; is a complex manifold), constant functions on &quot;U&quot; and differential operators on &quot;U&quot;.

If formula_17 then there is a restriction map formula_18 satisfying certain compatibility conditions. For a fixed &quot;x&quot;, one says that elements formula_19 and formula_20 are equivalent at &quot;x&quot; if there is a neighbourhood formula_21 of &quot;x&quot; with res&quot;WU&quot;(&quot;f&quot;) = res&quot;WV&quot;(&quot;g&quot;) (both elements of formula_22). The equivalence classes form the stalk formula_23 at &quot;x&quot; of the presheaf formula_15. This equivalence relation is an abstraction of the germ equivalence described above.

Interpreting germs through sheaves also gives a general explanation for the presence of algebraic structures on sets of germs. The reason is that formation of stalks preserves finite limits. This implies that if &quot;T&quot; is a Lawvere theory and a sheaf &quot;F&quot; is a &quot;T&quot;-algebra, then any stalk &quot;F&quot;&quot;x&quot; is also a &quot;T&quot;-algebra.

== Examples ==
If formula_25 and formula_26 have additional structure, it is possible to define subsets of the set of all maps from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; or more generally sub-presheaves of a given presheaf formula_15 and corresponding germs: &quot;some notable examples follow&quot;.

:of formula_33-times continuously differentiable functions, the subset 
::formula_34

*If formula_39 have a complex structure (for instance, are subsets of complex vector spaces), holomorphic functions between them can be defined, and therefore spaces of germs of holomorphic functions can be constructed.
*If formula_39 have an algebraic structure, then regular (and rational) functions between them can be defined, and germs of regular functions (and likewise rational) can be defined.
*The germ offormula_41 at positive infinity (or simply the germ of ) is formula_42. These germs are used in asymptotic analysis and Hardy fields.

=== Notation ===
The stalk of a sheaf formula_15 on a topological space formula_25 at a point formula_45 of formula_25 is commonly denoted by formula_47 As a consequence, germs, constituting stalks of sheaves of various kind of functions, borrow this scheme of notation:
*formula_48 is the &quot;space of germs of continuous functions&quot; at formula_45.
*formula_50 for each natural number formula_33 is the &quot;space of germs of formula_33-times-differentiable functions&quot; at formula_45.
*formula_54 is the &quot;space of germs of infinitely differentiable (&quot;smooth&quot;) functions&quot; at formula_45.
*formula_56 is the &quot;space of germs of analytic functions&quot; at formula_45.
*formula_58 is the &quot;space of germs of holomorphic functions&quot; (in complex geometry), or &quot;space of germs of regular functions&quot; (in algebraic geometry) at formula_45.

For germs of sets and varieties, the notation is not so well established: some notations found in literature include:

*formula_60 is the &quot;space of germs of analytic varieties&quot; at formula_45. When the point formula_45 is fixed and known (e.g. when formula_25 is a topological vector space and formula_64), it can be dropped in each of the above symbols: also, when formula_65, a subscript before the symbol can be added. As example
*formula_66 are the spaces of germs shown above when formula_25 is a formula_68-dimensional vector space and formula_64.

== Applications ==
The key word in the applications of germs is locality: &quot;all local properties of a function at a point can be studied by analyzing its germ&quot;. They are a generalization of Taylor series, and indeed the Taylor series of a germ (of a differentiable function) is defined: you only need local information to compute derivatives.

Germs are useful in determining the properties of dynamical systems near chosen points of their phase space: they are one of the main tools in singularity theory and catastrophe theory.

When the topological spaces considered are Riemann surfaces or more generally complex analytic varieties, germs of holomorphic functions on them can be viewed as power series, and thus the set of germs can be considered to be the analytic continuation of an analytic function.

Germs can also be used in the definition of tangent vectors in differential geometry. A tangent vector can be viewed as a point-derivation on the algebra of germs at that point.

== Algebraic properties ==
As noted earlier, sets of germs may have algebraic structures such as being rings. In many situations, rings of germs are not arbitrary rings but instead have quite specific properties.

Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is a space of some sort. It is often the case that, at each &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;, the ring of germs of functions at &quot;x&quot; is a local ring. This is the case, for example, for continuous functions on a topological space; for &quot;k&quot;-times differentiable, smooth, or analytic functions on a real manifold (when such functions are defined); for holomorphic functions on a complex manifold; and for regular functions on an algebraic variety. The property that rings of germs are local rings is axiomatized by the theory of locally ringed spaces.

The types of local rings that arise, however, depend closely on the theory under consideration. The Weierstrass preparation theorem implies that rings of germs of holomorphic functions are Noetherian rings. It can also be shown that these are regular rings. On the other hand, let formula_70 be the ring of germs at the origin of smooth functions on R. This ring is local but not Noetherian. To see why, observe that the maximal ideal &quot;m&quot; of this ring consists of all germs that vanish at the origin, and the power &quot;m&quot;&quot;k&quot; consists of those germs whose first &quot;k&quot; − 1 derivatives vanish. If this ring were Noetherian, then the Krull intersection theorem would imply that a smooth function whose Taylor series vanished would be the zero function. But this is false, as can be seen by considering
:formula_71
This ring is also not a unique factorization domain. This is because all UFDs satisfy the ascending chain condition on principal ideals, but there is an infinite ascending chain of principal ideals
:formula_72
The inclusions are strict because &quot;x&quot; is in the maximal ideal &quot;m&quot;.

The ring formula_73 of germs at the origin of continuous functions on R even has the property that its maximal ideal &quot;m&quot; satisfies &quot;m&quot;2 = &quot;m&quot;. Any germ &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;m&quot; can be written as
:formula_74
where sgn is the sign function. Since |&quot;f&quot;| vanishes at the origin, this expresses &quot;f&quot; as the product of two functions in &quot;m&quot;, whence the conclusion. This is related to the setup of almost ring theory.

<text>Georges Dor (March 10, 1931 – July 24, 2001) was a Canadian author, composer, playwright, singer, poet, translator, and theatrical producer and director.

==Early life==
Dor was born Georges-Henri Dore in Drummondville into a large family. As a young man he worked in a factory, and studied at the École du Théâtre du Nouveau Monde in Montreal.

==Career==
Dor undertook a career in radio as a disc jockey and news director. In the 1950s he worked at CHLN in Trois-Rivières. Beginning in 1957, he worked for Radio-Canada where he became a director for the Evening News.

Dor wrote poems for many years; in 1964 he was encouraged by friends to compete in an amateur singing competition. He began singing professionally in early 1965, and released his first album in 1966. One of the songs from this album, his composition &quot;La Manic&quot;, whose lyrics were a love letter written by a construction worker on the Manicouagan power project, became the most popular recording ever by a Quebec chansonnier, winning the Felix Leclerc award at the 1968 Festival du Disques. Other songs had similar success, notably &quot;Une boîte à chanson&quot; (A Music Box) and &quot;Pour la musique&quot; (For Music).

He continued to perform as a singer until 1972, and to record until 1978. After that he worked mainly in the theatre and in television, producing and writing plays and téléromans. He also wrote two novels and published several collections of poetry.

<text>Visual flight or visual attitude flying is the control of an aircraft via outside references (such as the sky or the runway in takeoff). For aircraft, the primary visual reference used is usually the relationship between the aircraft&#x27;s &quot;nose&quot; or cowling against the natural horizon. Regulations for visual flights are under a separate set of visual flight rules.

The pilot can maintain or change the airspeed, altitude, and direction of flight (heading) as well as the rate of climb or rate of descent and rate of turn (bank angle) through the use of the aircraft flight controls and aircraft engine controls to adjust the &quot;sight picture&quot;. Some reference to flight instruments is usually necessary to determine exact airspeed, altitude, heading, bank angle and rate of climb/descent.

<text>The International Young Democracy Union (IYDU) is a global alliance of centre-right political youth organisations and the youth wing of the International Democrat Union.

The IYDU in its current form was founded in March 1991 in Washington, D.C. A previous organisation of the same name had been established in July 1981, also in Washington, but subsequently ceased to exist.

The IYDU fights for conservative and free-market policies worldwide.

IYDU host a number of events for member organisations each year including a Freedom Forum (mid-year), an Annual Council Meeting, and overseas study visits.

Following almost 6 years of the IYDU being split over differences in the interpretation of the IYDU constitution, the International Young Democrat Union Joint Council Meeting elected a unified IYDU Board in Brussels on 21 October 2017.

Per the IYDU, it was first established in 1981 and &quot;is a global alliance of centre-right political youth organisations united by a common desire for greater freedom and less government.&quot; It claims that members have become cabinet ministers, members of parliament, senior advisers and leaders within their respective industries in public and private sectors.&quot;

==Parent organisation==
The parent organisation to IYDU, the International Democrat Union (IDU) is a working association of 71 full and associate members from 63 different countries. Formed in 1983, founder members included Britain&#x27;s Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher; US Vice-President George H. W. Bush; Mayor of Paris, and later French President, Jacques Chirac; and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

<text>Capital loss is the difference between a lower selling price and a higher purchase price or cost price of an eligible Capital asset, which typically represents a financial loss for the seller. This is distinct from losses from selling goods below cost, which is typically considered loss in business income.

==United States==
The IRS states that &quot;If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the excess can be deducted on your tax return.&quot; Limits on such deductions apply. For individuals, a net loss can be claimed as a tax deduction against ordinary income, up to $3,000 per year ($1,500 in the case of a married individual filing separately). Any remaining net loss can be carried over and applied against gains in future years. However, losses from the sale of personal property, including a residence, do not qualify for this treatment.

Special wash sale rules apply if the same or substantially similar asset is bought, acquired, or optioned within 30 days before or after the sale.

According to 26 U.S.C. §121, a capital loss on the sale of a primary residence is generally tax-exempt.. IRC 165(c) is a stronger source that limits the loss on the sale of a personal residence. IRC 121 is for exclusion of gain of primary residence and does not talk about loss.

<doc id="352728" wikidata="Q7990448" url="?curid=352728" title="Whad'Ya Know?">
<text>Whad&#x27;Ya Know? is an American comedy, interview, and quiz radio show. Hosted by Michael Feldman, it was created in 1985. During its radio run, it was produced by Wisconsin Public Radio and distributed through Public Radio International. Feldman is accompanied on-stage by Lyle Anderson, phone-answerer; and the Whad&#x27;ya Know Trio with John Thulin on piano, Jeff Hamann on bass, and, on road shows, Clyde Stubblefield on drums. Jeffry Eckels was the original full-time bass player from 1987 to 2003. Feldman was also accompanied by Jim Packard as announcer from the show&#x27;s beginning until his death following the June 9, 2012, show from New York City. Sara Nics was the show&#x27;s announcer from October 13, 2012 to March 28, 2015. Stephanie Lee became the show&#x27;s announcer in August 2015. The show was broadcast live with an audience from Monona Terrace in Madison, Wisconsin. Periodically, the show was taken on the road and broadcast from various other locations across the United States. The show was broadcast weekly, each Saturday at 10:00 AM CT (UTC-6) for two hours, and repeated throughout the week by syndication. Since the beginning of 2009, the entire show has also been available over the Internet as a podcast. The show aired its final WPR/PRI radio broadcast on June 25, 2016, with prior episodes archived on the show&#x27;s website. Starting in the fall of 2016, Whad&#x27;ya Know became available as a podcast.

==Game format==
Just as Feldman&#x27;s quickness and comedic rhythms are reminiscent of Groucho Marx, the game is reminiscent of Marx&#x27;s &quot;You Bet Your Life&quot; quiz show in that it is designed more to give the host a chance to interact with the players than to be a serious test of their knowledge. Feldman often comments that the &quot;Whad&#x27;Ya Know&quot; quiz is not a trivia quiz, but rather one of &quot;general knowledge.&quot; When the show is recorded from its home base at Monona Terrace in Madison, Wisconsin, the call-in number used is 1-800-942-5669. With this number, the announcer would also give the telephonic mnemonic 1-800-WHA-KNOW or 1-800-WHAK-NOW. While on the road, phone number changes are handled in the same fashion, often resulting in humorous, nonsensical words or phrases.

Twice during the show, usually towards the end of each hour, the &quot;Whad&#x27;ya Know&quot; quiz is played. The game is played with a two-member team: the first member being selected by Feldman from the audience, and the second from a radio audience caller. The caller must correctly answer a qualifying question before being added to the team.

The two contestants then play the main game. To win, they must answer three questions correctly before getting three wrong. Six categories for questions are presented:
*Current Events
*People
*Places
*Things You Should Have Learned In School (Had You Been Paying Attention)
*Science
*Odds and Ends

The players take turns choosing a category for each question, beginning with the call-in player. Feldman reads the questions (often multiple-choice), and the team collaborates to come up with an answer. If correct, the team earns one point. Teams are kept apprised of their point status by the announcer. When the team earns three points, bells signal that they have won the game. To ensure that the team will win, Feldman frequently offers hints or slyly lets them know when they are on the wrong track. As a result, it is rare for a team to lose.

The winning team is awarded a set of prizes. If a team earns three points without missing a single question, they have the option of going for the &quot;Mother Lode&quot; by answering two more questions correctly without missing one, or else a fictitious penalty is put upon them (usually made up on the spot by the announcer and related to a joke from earlier in the show). If successful (and they almost always are), the contestants win a larger prize package—once called &quot;The Giant Kielbasa&quot;, but that term has fallen out of use.

==Segments==
Along with the Whad&#x27;Ya Know Quiz, music from the Whad&#x27;Ya Know Trio (often new arrangements or original compositions), and interviews with both celebrities and audience members, other segments have become recurring staples to the show&#x27;s format.

===All the News that Isn&#x27;t===
The show traditionally opens with a parody reading of &quot;All the News that Isn&#x27;t,&quot; a list of fictional headlines taken from real current events. If the show is on the road, the headlines will typically involve local headlines from the city and state in which the show is being broadcast.

===Disclaimers===
Prior to the playing of the first Quiz, an audience member is given a list of the four disclaimers to read, which state who can or cannot play the quiz. The disclaimers, read on the air every week, remain constant, with the exception of disclaimer 2, which is a short joke referencing a current event:

#&quot;All questions used on &quot;Whad&#x27;ya Know?&quot; have been painstakingly researched, although the answers have not. Ambiguous, misleading, or poorly worded questions are par for the course. Listeners who are sticklers for the truth should get their own shows.&quot;
#Here the audience member reads a short statement making light of a current event. (Sometimes this quip takes the third position rather than the second.)
#&quot;Persons employed by the International House of Radio or its member stations are lucky to be working at all, let alone tying up the office phones trying to play the quiz. Listeners who have won recently should sit on their hands and let someone else have a chance for a change.&quot;
#&quot;All opinions expressed on &quot;Whad&#x27;ya Know?&quot; are well-reasoned and insightful. Needless to say, they are not those of the International House of Radio, its member stations, or lackeys. Anyone who says otherwise is itching for a fight.&quot;

===Thanks for the memos===
Usually at the beginning of the show&#x27;s second hour, Feldman reads some &quot;actual memos sent in to us by actual listeners&quot; that often contain some sort of humorous content or blooper. This section of the show is not limited to memoranda per se, but also includes typos in newspaper headlines and other publications.

===Town of the week===
Each week at the end of the show, a town (selected on the prior week&#x27;s show by an audience member throwing a dart at a rearranged map of the United States) is honored as the Town of the Week. The announcer gives a biographical description of the town, usually including the history of the town, famous landmarks, local sports teams, and other must-see places (with Feldman frequently interjecting comments). Feldman then has a phone conversation with a randomly selected citizen of that town to further discuss what life is like there.

As this is usually the last portion of the show, following the second Quiz session, this part of the show is frequently postponed when time runs out. This has led to many towns waiting for their chance to be honored for many weeks on end.

===Whad&#x27;Ya Idol===
During March 2007, &quot;Whad&#x27;Ya Know&quot; featured a special program, &quot;Whad&#x27;Ya Idol&quot;. Contestants sent in short song clips and listeners voted. The winner, Aaron Kaufman, performed his song, &quot;All My Life&quot;, live on the show on April 14. The three other finalists were &quot;The Girl with the Cotton Candy Hair&quot; by Oliver Brown, &quot;Drinking Her Pretty&quot; by Pedro Peterson, and &quot;The Faith Within&quot; by J Scott Rakozy.

==Related products==
Out of the Box Publishing has produced a spin-off party game, &quot;Whad&#x27;Ya Know&quot;, designed by its co-founder, John Kovalic. On former shows, this game has sometimes been added to the prizes awarded to the winners of the quiz.

<text>Andrée Raymonde Borrel (18 November 1919 – 6 July 1944), code named Denise, was a French woman who served in the French Resistance and as an agent for Britain&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive in World War II. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in occupied Europe against the Axis powers, especially Nazi Germany. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England.

In September 1942, Borrel was the first female agent of SOE to arrive in France by parachute, which also made her the first female secret agent known to have parachuted into enemy territory. Based in Paris, she became a member of the SOE&#x27;s Prosper network in occupied France where she worked as a courier. Prosper was SOE&#x27;s largest and most important network in France and Borrel was an important figure in its leadership. She was arrested by the Gestapo in June 1943. She was subsequently executed in July 1944 at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp.

==Early life==
Andrée Borrel was born into a working-class family in Bécon-les-Bruyères, a north-western suburb of Paris, France. She was good at sports, while her older sister (Léone) described Borrel as a tom-boy who had the strength, endurance and interests of boys whose favourite pastimes were bicycling in the countryside, hiking and climbing.

Her father (Louis) died when she was 11, and to help support her family Borrel left school at 14 to work for a dress designer. When she was 16, her family moved to Paris, where Borrel spent two years as a shop assistant in Boulangerie Pajo, a bakery. After this she worked at the Bazar d&#x27;Amsterdam as a shop assistant which allowed her to have Sundays off so she could enjoy her passion for cycling. In October 1939, Borrel&#x27;s mother (Eugenie) was advised to move to a warmer climate for her health, so took Andrée and her sister to Toulon on the Mediterranean coast where they had family friends.

Not long before World War II broke out, Borrel&#x27;s socialist sympathies led her to travel to Spain to help the Republican government in its fight against the Nazi-backed fascists in Spain. However, she found that the war had all but been lost, and returned to France.

==War work in Europe (1939–42)==

When World War II broke out Borrel went to work with the Red Cross to volunteer her services. She enrolled in a crash course in nursing that she completed on 20 January 1940, which qualified her to serve as a nurse in the Association des Dames Françaises. First at Hôpital Compliméntaire in Nîmes in early February, though Borrel was sent back 15 days later following a decree that nurses under the age of 21 were not allowed to serve in hospitals. This decree was revoked a few days later and she was sent to the Hôpital de Beaucaire in Beaucaire. One of Borrel&#x27;s co-workers there was Lieutenant Maurice Dufour, and when the hospital was closed they were both sent to Hôpital Compliméntaire. Towards the end of July that hospital was to be closed and, at the request of Dufour, Borrel was allowed to resign from this quasi-military institution, after which she immediately went to work with Dufour for the Pat Line, an underground organisation which Dufour was involved in. 

At the beginning of August 1941, Borrel and Dufour established the Villa Rene-Therese in Canet-plage, on the Mediterranean coast just outside Perpignan near the Spanish border. This became the Pat Line&#x27;s last safe house (before the hard and dangerous route over the Pyrénées), an escape network established by Albert Guérisse (supported by MI9), which helped British airmen shot down over France, SOE agents, Jews and others escape German controlled France. The villa proved too small and at the beginning of October they rented the Villa Anita. Toward the end of December the escape network had been compromised by the Germans. Borrel and Dufour found other accommodation to avoid arrest until eventually escaping over the Pyrénées in mid-February to Spain and from there to Portugal, where they flew to England (Dufour on 29 March 1942 and Borrel on 24 April 1942).

==Arrival in England==

Soon after landing in England, like all arrivals from the Continent, Borrel was taken to the Royal Patriotic School, the MI5 security clearance centre. Their report concluded:

Mlle Borrel&#x27;s story seems perfectly straightforward. It is corroborated by Dufour who, on arriving in England, vouched for her. She is an excellent type of country girl, who has intelligence and seems a keen patriot. From a security point of view, I can find nothing against Mlle Borrel and recommend her release to the FFF.

Borrel had wanted to join the Free French Forces but they were not enthusiastic about French citizens who had worked with the British (who were deeply involved in the escape network Borrel had been working with), and were not interested in Borrel as she refused to divulge information about all her prior activities. Borrel was subsequently approached by the Special Operations Executive and joined it on 15 May 1942.

==Special Operations Executive (1942–44)==
===SOE training===
Borrel seemed like just the type of woman SOE needed for a field agent. Her SOE interviewer commented:

Since arriving in London, she attempted to join the Corps Féminin of the Free French movement but they have made it a condition that she should give them all the intelligence concerning the organization for which she was working in France. This she refuses to do and apparently they refuse to employ her unless she does. I think that she would make an excellent addition to our own Corps Féminin and it should not be difficult to get her… She said that she was perfectly willing to let us have the information she refuses to give to the Free French.

Borrel undertook training with SOE to become a field agent with their F Section while officially an ensign in the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry (FANY). Upon the successful completion of her training, she was promoted to lieutenant. The commandant&#x27;s report contained the following appraisal:

Of sound intelligence, if lacking somewhat in imagination. She has little organising ability and will do her best work under definite instructions. She is thoroughly tough and self-reliant with no nerves. Has plenty of common sense and is well able to look after herself in any circumstances and she is absolutely reliable. Has lost her attitude of over-confidence and has benefited enormously from the course and developed a thoroughly level headed approach towards problems. A very pleasant personality and she should eventually develop into a first class agent.

The men she trained with found her &quot;informal by habit, lower-class, and scrappy.&quot; She was said to be &quot;accessible, playful, easy to like, easy to share a smoke and a laugh with, but innocent too, neither hardened nor hurt by the rough wear of war.&quot;

===Parachuted into France===

On the night of 24 September 1942 (the night after their parachute drop was aborted due to the signals in the drop zone being incorrect), Borrel (&quot;Denise&quot;) and Lise de Baissac (&quot;Odile&quot;) leave England in a RAF Whitley and become the first female SOE agents to parachute into German-occupied France early on the morning of 25 September, as part of operation &quot;Whitebeam&quot; to set up resistance networks in Paris and Northern France (circuits and sub-circuits). They were flown in from RAF Tempsford. Borrel dropped first, while they both landed in a field in the village of Saint-Laurent-Nouan, not far from the river Loire, about southeast of Paris, and were picked up by members of a local resistance team. Years later de Baissac recalled the experience:

As it happens, we went twice. The pilot wouldn&#x27;t drop us the first time because the lights of the landing field were not quite accurate, so we had to come all the way back, which was very trying. You were squashed in that little place with a parachute on your back and your legs drawn up, and, of course, there was the danger too. Back in England they told us the reception committee had a man missing so they couldn&#x27;t place the lights for the signal the way they were supposed to. We went back again the next night. We sat on the floor of the airplane [a Whitley bomber], much too tense for conversation, which in any case was not possible because of the noise. I don&#x27;t remember how long it was until the dispatcher opened the hole, which meant we were arriving. We crept nearer, getting our legs into position. We had drawn straws and luck gave Andrée the first jump. I went immediately after her. You had to jump very quickly, one right after the other, because the plane is going on and you might be dropped very far from each other.

===Physician (Prosper) circuit===

Because of Borrel&#x27;s familiarity with Paris, it was natural that she be sent there to work as a courier for the new &quot;Prosper&quot; circuit to be led by Francis Suttill (officially named &quot;Physician&quot; but unofficially called &quot;Prosper&quot; after Suttill&#x27;s codename). In early October 1942, Suttill and Borrel met in a Paris cafe she knew. With information supplied them by Germaine Tambour of the Carte network, Suttill and Borrell embarked on a tour of northern France to begin creating and organizing groups to resist the German occupation. They had early success and on 17/18 November Suttill, Borrel, Yvonne Rudellat, and newly-arrived wireless operator, Gilbert Norman, received near Étrépagny a parachute drop of containers with weapons for the resistance. It was the first of many over the next few months. 

Suttill initially did not wish to have Borrel work with him because &quot;as a married man&quot; he &quot;might find the enforced proximity a strain.&quot; However, SOE insisted she was the best person to serve as his courier. She became more than that. Suttill&#x27;s French was not flawless and Borrel accompanied him everywhere on their tour, posing as his sister and doing most of the talking. The two of them had cover stories as salesmen for agricultural products. They had success in finding many recruits for resistance groups and farm fields suitable for clandestine landings of airplanes and drops of containers of arms. Borrel, Suttill, and the radio operator, Gilbert Norman, became an inseparable trio. Borrel and Norman became lovers. They were a pair in contrast. He was handsome, &quot;upper-caste&quot;, and rich. She was &quot;shrewd and common&quot;. Whilst working in Prosper she took part in a wide range of activities including the creation of circuits in Paris and northern France, sabotage, weapons training, and supervising weapons drops. Suttill was impressed with Borrel&#x27;s performance. In a note to SOE in March 1943, Suttill wrote:

Everyone who has come into contact with her in her work agrees with myself that she is the best of us all. In J…&#x27;s absence, she acted as my Lieutenant. Shared every danger. Took part in a December reception committee with myself and some others. Has a perfect understanding of security and an imperturbable calmness. Thank you very much for having sent her to me.

Contrary to Suttill&#x27;s opinion, Borrel&#x27;s frequent poker games with other SOE agents in a Paris cafe violated SOE&#x27;s doctrine that for security reasons networks should be independent of each other with as little contact as possible between and among networks and even among members of the same network.

Madam Guépin, the wife of George Darling (who ran a resistance group in north-west France), said Borrel &quot;Had a head on her shoulders and a will of iron&quot;, and was &quot;utterly loyal and devoted to Prosper [Suttill], as her chief, and to Archambaud (Gilbert Norman).&quot;

==Arrest and execution==
===Problems of success===
The Prosper network grew rapidly, and, in the words of M.R.D. Foot, &quot;its growth made catastrophe certain.&quot; The German occupiers were paying attention. In November 1942, a German agent stole a list of the names of more than 200 supporters of the resistance group called the Carte network. Prosper engaged many of the same people on the list in building its resistance networks. The Germans did not take immediate action to suppress the resistors, but bided their time. The rapid growth of Prosper and the large number of people associated with the network, including nearly 30 SOE agents sent from Britain, resulted in loose security. At least 10 SOE agents used the apartment of Geraldine Tambour as a safe house and letter drop, violating SOE doctrine to avoid face-to-face contact among agents. One radio operator, Jack Agazarian, claimed to have transmitted messages for 24 different agents, again violating SOE doctrine. SOE agents in groups frequented restaurants specializing in black market luxuries. Moreover, a double agent, Henri Déricourt, was providing information to the Germans about Prosper. 

===Gestapo raid===

German suppression of Prosper began in April 1943. On 23 and 24 June 1943, the Sicherheitsdienst, the intelligence agency of the SS based at 84 Avenue Foch in Paris and headed by Major Josef Kieffer, struck at Prosper&#x27;s leadership. Borrel, Norman, and Suttill were arrested. Hundreds of others, including both French helpers and SOE agents, were also arrested in the ensuing months. Borrel was interrogated, but according to one author exhibited a fearless contempt for her captors, maintaining &quot;a silence so disdainful that the Germans did not attempt to break it.&quot; Later transferred to the Fresnes Prison, Borrel smuggled out notes to her mother written on cigarette paper hidden in lingerie she sent her sister for washing. Most messages were to reassure her mother and request items like a notebook and hairpins, ending with many kisses. Borrel&#x27;s mother and sister lived in Paris.

===Moved to Germany===
On 13 May 1944, Borrel along with three other captured female SOE agents, Vera Leigh, Sonia Olschanezky and Diana Rowden, were moved from Fresnes to 84 Avenue Foch along with four other women whose names were Yolande Beekman, Madeleine Damerment, Eliane Plewman and Odette Sansom, all of whom were F Section agents. Later that day they were taken to the railway station, and each handcuffed to a guard upon boarding the train. Sansom, in an interview after the war, said:

We were starting on this journey together in fear, but all of us hoping for something above all that we would remain together. We had all had a taste already of what things could be like, none of us did expect for anything very much, we all knew that they could put us to death. I was the only one officially condemned to death. The others were not. But there is always a fugitive ray of hope that some miracle will take place.

When the women arrived in Germany they were put into separate cells in the prison in Karlsruhe (Justizvollzugsanstalt Karlsruhe) – Sansom with a woman who had been in prison for three years because her own daughter (a member of the Hitlerjugend) had denounced her for listening to the BBC, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses. The agents were treated no differently from other prisoners – markedly better than those in concentration camps – and were given manual work to do, peeling potatoes, sewing, etc., which helped pass the time. Occasionally, through the high bars, they could hear Allied bombers headed for targets within Germany, so on the whole things looked good for them even if there was the possibility of dying in an air raid. The war was unmistakably coming closer to an end and they could reasonably expect to be liberated by the Allies before too long.

===Execution at Natzweiler-Struthof===

Between five and six in the morning on 6 July 1944, not quite two months after their arrival in Karlsruhe prison, Borrel, Leigh, Olschanezky and Rowden were taken to the reception room, given their personal possessions, and escorted by two Gestapo men 100 kilometres south-west by closed truck to the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in France, where they arrived around three-thirty in the afternoon. The women&#x27;s arrival was apparently unexpected as was the order by one of the women&#x27;s escorts that the four women were to be executed immediately.

As women were a rarity in the camp their presence immediately attracted attention from both German guards and prisoners. SS men led the four women through the center of the camp down to the cellblock at the bottom of the camp. They were held there until later that night. &quot;One could see from their appearance that they hadn&#x27;t come from a camp,&quot; said a French prisoner. &quot;They seemed young, they were fairly well groomed, their clothes were not rubbish, their hair was brushed, and each had a case in their (&quot;sic&quot;) hand.&quot; 

The four women were initially together but later put into individual cells. Through the windows, which faced those of the infirmary, they managed to communicate with several prisoners, including a Belgian prisoner, Dr Georges Boogaerts, who passed one of the women (whom he later identified as Borrel from a photograph) cigarettes through the window. Borrel threw him a little tobacco pouch containing some money.

Albert Guérisse, a Belgian army physician who had headed the Pat O&#x27;Leary escape line in Marseille, recognized Borrel as one of his former helpers. He exchanged a few words with another one of the women, who said she was English (Leigh or Rowden) before she disappeared into the cellblock building. At the post-war trial of the men charged with the execution of the four women, Guérisse stated that he was in the infirmary and had seen the women, one by one, being escorted by SS guards from the cellblock (&quot;Zellenbau&quot;) to the crematorium a few yards away. He told the court: &quot;I saw the four women going to the crematorium, one after the other. One went, and two or three minutes later another went.&quot;

Inside the building housing the crematorium, each woman in turn was told to undress for a medical check and a doctor gave her an injection for what he told one of them was a vaccination against typhus, but was in fact a 10 cc dose of phenol, which the doctor believed was lethal. When the woman became unconscious after the injection, she was inserted into the crematorium oven. Guérrise said, &quot;The next morning the German prisoner in charge of the crematorium explained to me that each time the door of the oven was opened, the flames came out of the chimney and that meant a body had been put in the oven. I saw the flames four times.&quot;

The prisoner Guérisse referred to was Franz Berg, who assisted in the crematorium and had stoked the fire that night before being sent back to the room he shared with two other prisoners before the executions. The door was locked from the outside during the executions, but it was possible to see the corridor from a small window above the door, so the prisoner in the highest bunk was able to keep up a running commentary on what he saw. Berg said:


More than one witness talked of a struggle when the fourth woman was shoved into the furnace. According to a Polish prisoner named Walter Schultz, the SS medical orderly Emil Brüttel told him the following: &quot;When the last woman was halfway in the oven (she had been put in feet first), she had come to her senses and struggled. As there were sufficient men there, they were able to push her into the oven, but not before she had resisted and scratched [Peter] Straub&#x27;s face.&quot; The next day Schultz noticed that the face of the camp executioner (Straub) had been severely scratched.

The camp doctor, Werner Rohde, was executed after the war. Franz Berg was sentenced to five years in prison but received the death penalty in another trial for a different crime and was hanged on the same day as Rohde. The camp commandant, Fritz Hartjenstein, received a life sentence, while Straub was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

==Awards and honours==
Following Borrel&#x27;s arrest by the Gestapo, the SOE produced a citation for an award that stated the following:

This officer was parachuted into France in November 1942 as an assistant to an organiser in the Paris area. She proved herself an able and devoted lieutenant, and was appointed second in command of the organisation. Owing to her cool judgment she was always chosen for the most delicate and dangerous work such as recruiting and arranging rendezvous, and she acted as &quot;cut-out&quot; for her commanding officer.

    Lt. Borrel was also given the task of organising parachute dropping operations, and took part in several coups de mains, notably an operation against the Chevilly power station in March 1943. She distinguished herself by her coolness and efficiency and always volunteered for the most dangerous tasks. Her commanding officer paid tribute to her great qualities, describing her as &quot;a perfect lieutenant, an excellent organiser who shares all the dangers&quot;.

    Lt Borrel was arrested by the Gestapo in July 1943. For her great bravery and devotion to duty during nine months of active underground work in France, it is recommended that she be appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (civil division).

Posthumously, France awarded Borrel the Croix de Guerre and the Médaille de la Résistance in recognition of her defence of France, while Britain awarded her the King&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct (KCBC). The concentration camp where she died is a now a French government historical site, where a plaque to Borrel and the three women who died with her is part of the Deportation Memorial on the site. As one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of her country, Lieutenant Borrel is listed on the &quot;Roll of Honor&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre department of France. She is also commemorated on the Tempsford Memorial in the village of Tempsford in the county of Bedfordshire in the East of England. A later memorial, the SOE Agents Memorial in Lambeth Palace Road (Westminster, London), is dedicated to all SOE agents. Borrel is also commemorated in column 3 of panel 26 of the Brookwood Memorial as one of 3,500 &quot;to whom war denied a known and honoured grave&quot;.

In 1985, SOE agent and painter Brian Stonehouse, who saw Borrel and the three other female SOE agents at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp just before their deaths, painted a poignant watercolour of the four women which now hangs in the Special Forces Club in London.

A monument is erected in memory of Andrée Borrel and Marie-Lise de Baissac in the town of Saint-Laurent-Nouan (Loir-et-Cher) at a place called Bois-Renard, the place of their parachuting on the night of 24 to September 25, 1942. It was inaugurated on September 25, 2022. GPS coordinates: 47.664599,1.600769.

<text>The glass harmonica, also known as the glass armonica, glass harmonium, bowl organ, hydrocrystalophone, or simply the armonica or harmonica (derived from , &quot;harmonia&quot;, the Greek word for harmony), is a type of musical instrument that uses a series of glass bowls or goblets graduated in size to produce musical tones by means of friction (instruments of this type are known as friction idiophones). It was invented in 1761 by Benjamin Franklin.

==Nomenclature==

The name &quot;glass harmonica&quot; (also &quot;glass armonica&quot;, &quot;glassharmonica&quot;; &quot;harmonica de verre&quot;, &quot;harmonica de Franklin&quot;, &quot;armonica de verre&quot;, or just &quot;harmonica&quot; in French; &quot;Glasharmonika&quot; in German; &quot;harmonica&quot; in Dutch) refers today to any instrument played by rubbing glass or crystal goblets or bowls. The alternative instrument consisting of a set of wine glasses (usually tuned with water) is generally known in English as &quot;musical glasses&quot; or the &quot;glass harp&quot;.

When Benjamin Franklin invented his mechanical version of the instrument in 1761, he called it the armonica, based on the Italian word &quot;armonia&quot;, which means &quot;harmony&quot;.
The unrelated free-reed wind instrument aeolina, today called the &quot;harmonica&quot;, was not invented until 1821, sixty years later.

The word &quot;hydrodaktulopsychicharmonica&quot; is also recorded, composed of Greek roots to mean something like &quot;harmonica to produce music for the soul by fingers dipped in water&quot; (&quot;hydro-&quot; for &quot;water&quot;, &quot;daktul-&quot; for &quot;finger&quot;, &quot;psych-&quot; for &quot;soul&quot;). The &quot;Oxford Companion to Music&quot; mentions that this word is &quot;the longest section of the Greek language ever attached to any musical instrument, for a reader of &quot;The Times&quot; wrote to that paper in 1932 to say that in his youth he heard a performance of the instrument where it was called a &quot;hydrodaktulopsychicharmonica&quot;.&quot; The Museum of Music in Paris displays a hydrodaktulopsychicharmonica.

==Forerunners==
Because its sounding portion is made of glass, the glass harmonica is a type of crystallophone. The phenomenon of rubbing a wet finger around the rim of a wine goblet to produce tones is documented back to Renaissance times; Galileo considered the phenomenon (in his &quot;Two New Sciences&quot;), as did Athanasius Kircher.

The Irish musician Richard Pockrich is typically credited as the first to play an instrument composed of glass vessels (glass harp) by rubbing his fingers around the rims. Beginning in the 1740s, he performed in London on a set of upright goblets filled with varying amounts of water. His career was cut short by a fire in his room, which killed him and destroyed his apparatus.

Edward Delaval, a friend of Benjamin Franklin and a fellow of the Royal Society, extended the experiments of Pockrich, contriving a set of glasses better tuned and easier to play. During the same decade, Christoph Willibald Gluck also attracted attention playing a similar instrument in England. In April 1760, the poet Thomas Gray wrote to James Brown, Master of Pembroke College, Cambridge, of a performance by Delaval that: &quot;No instrument I know has so celestial a tone. It was like a cherubim in a box.&quot;

==Franklin&#x27;s armonica==

Benjamin Franklin invented a radically new arrangement of the glasses in 1761 after seeing water-filled wine glasses played by Edward Delaval at Cambridge in England in May 1761. Franklin worked with London glassblower Charles James to build one, and it had its world premiere in early 1762, played by Marianne Davies.

In a letter addressed to his friend Giambattista Beccaria, an Italian priest, physicist and mathematician in Turin, Franklin wrote from London in 1762 about his musical instrument:
&quot;The advantages of this instrument are, that its tones are incomparably sweet beyond those of any other; that they may be swelled and softened at pleasure by stronger or weaker pressures of the finger, and continued to any length; and that the instrument, being well tuned, never again wants tuning. In honour of your musical language, I have borrowed from it the name of this instrument, calling it the Armonica.&quot;

In Franklin&#x27;s treadle-operated version, 37 bowls were mounted horizontally on an iron spindle. The whole spindle turned by means of a foot pedal. The sound was produced by touching the rims of the bowls with water-moistened fingers. Rims were painted different colors according to the pitch of the note: A (dark blue), B (purple), C (red), D (orange), E (yellow), F (green), G (blue), and accidentals were marked in white. With the Franklin design, it is possible to play ten glasses simultaneously if desired, a technique that is very difficult if not impossible to execute using upright goblets. Franklin also advocated the use of a small amount of powdered chalk on the fingers, which under some acidic water conditions helped produce a clear tone.

Some attempted improvements on the armonica included adding keyboards, placing pads between the bowls to reduce sympathetic vibrations, and using violin bows. Another supposed improvement, based upon later observations of non-playing instruments, was to have the glasses rotate into a trough of water. However, William Zeitler put this idea to the test by rotating an armonica cup into a basin of water; the water has the same effect as putting water in a wine glass – it changes the pitch. With several dozen glasses, each a different diameter and thus rotating with a different depth, the result would be musical cacophony. This modification also made it much harder to make the glass &quot;speak&quot;, and muffled the sound.

In 1975, an original armonica was acquired by the Bakken Museum in Minneapolis and put on display, albeit without its original glass bowls (they were destroyed during shipment). It was purchased through a musical instrument dealer in France, from the descendants of Mme. Brillon de Jouy, a neighbor of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s from 1777 to 1785, when he lived in the Paris suburb of Passy. Some 18th- and 19th-century specimens of the armonica have survived into the 21st century. Franz Mesmer also played the armonica and used it as an integral part of his Mesmerism.

An original Franklin armonica is in the archives at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, having been donated in 1956 by Franklin&#x27;s descendants after &quot;the children took great delight in breaking the bowls with spoons&quot; during family gatherings. It is only placed on display for special occasions, such as Franklin&#x27;s birthday. The Franklin Institute is also the home of the Benjamin Franklin National Memorial.

A website has attempted to catalog publicly known Franklin-era glass armonicas. The Museum of Fine Arts, Boston has an early 19th-century instrument on display, which is occasionally used for public performances and recordings.

==Musical works==

Composers including J. G. Naumann, Padre Martini, Johann Adolph Hasse, Baldassare Galuppi, and Niccolò Jommelli, and more than 100 others composed works for the glass harmonica; some pieces survive in the repertoire through transcriptions for more conventional instruments. European monarchs indulged in playing it, and even Marie Antoinette took lessons as a child from Franz Anton Mesmer.

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart wrote his 1791 K. 617 and K.356 (K.617a) for the glass harmonica. Ludwig van Beethoven used the instrument in his 1814 melodrama &quot;Leonore Prohaska&quot;. Gaetano Donizetti used the instrument in the accompaniment to Amelia&#x27;s aria &quot;Par che mi dica ancora&quot; in &quot;Il castello di Kenilworth&quot;, premiered in 1829. He also originally specified the instrument in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; (1835) as a haunting accompaniment to the heroine&#x27;s &quot;mad scene&quot;, though before the premiere he was required by the producers to rewrite the part for two flutes. Camille Saint-Saëns used this instrument in his 1886 &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; (in movements 7 and 14). Richard Strauss used the instrument in his 1917 &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;.

For a while the instrument was &quot;extraordinarily popular,&quot; its &quot;&#x27;ethereal&quot; qualities characteristic, along with instruments such as the nail violin and Aeolian harp, of &quot;Empfindsamkeit&quot;, but &quot;the instrument fell into oblivion,&quot; around 1830. Since the armonica&#x27;s performance revival during the 1980s, composers have again written for it (solo, chamber music, opera, electronic music, popular music) including Jan Erik Mikalsen, Regis Campo, Etienne Rolin, Philippe Sarde, Damon Albarn, Tom Waits, Michel Redolfi, Cyril Morin, Stefano Giannotti, Thomas Bloch, Jörg Widmann (&quot;Armonica&quot; 2006), and Guillaume Connesson.

The music for the 1997 ballet &quot;Othello&quot; by American composer Elliot Goldenthal opens and closes with the glass harmonica. The ballet was performed at San Francisco Ballet, the American Ballet Theatre, the Joffrey Ballet, and on tour in Europe including at the Opera Garnier with Dennis James performing with his historical replica instrument.

Joseph Schwantner&#x27;s symphonic poem &quot;Aftertones of Infinity&quot;, which was awarded the 1979 Pulitzer Prize for Music. employed individual wine glasses played by numerous members of the orchestra at key points during the work.

George Benjamin&#x27;s opera &quot;Written on Skin&quot;, which premiered at the 2012 Aix-en-Provence Festival, includes a prominent and elaborate part for the glass harmonica.

== Non-musical cultural works ==
Johann August Apel&#x27;s short story &quot;&quot; () from (volume 3, 1811) centers on the ethereal otherworldly quality of glass harmonicas.

Andrei Khrzhanovsky&#x27;s 1968 animated short film &quot;The Glass Harmonica&quot; () is named after, and features, a &quot;glass harmonica&quot;. It is particularly notable for being the only Soviet animated film to be banned by censors.

==Purported dangers==
The instrument&#x27;s popularity did not last far beyond the 18th century. This may have been due to the inability to amplify the volume so as not to be drowned out by other instruments.

Some claim this was due to strange rumors that using the instrument caused both musicians and their listeners to go mad. It is a matter of conjecture how pervasive that belief was; all the commonly cited examples of this rumor seem to be German, if not confined to Vienna. One example of alleged effects from playing the glass harmonica was noted by German musicologist Johann Friedrich Rochlitz in 18-th century in the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot;:

Marianne Davies, who played flute and harpsichord – and was a young woman said to be related to Franklin – became proficient enough at playing the armonica to offer public performances. After touring for many years in duo performances with her celebrated vocalist sister, she was also said to have been afflicted with a melancholia attributed to the plaintive tones of the instrument. Marianne Kirchgessner was an armonica player; she died at the age of 39 of pneumonia or an illness much like it. However many others, including Franklin, lived long lives.

For a time the armonica achieved a genuine vogue, but like most fads, that for the armonica eventually passed. It has been claimed the sound-producing mechanism did not generate sufficient power to fill the large halls that were becoming home to modern stringed instruments, brass, woodwinds, and percussion. That the instrument was made with glass, and subject to easy breakage, perhaps did not help either. By 1820, the armonica had mostly disappeared from frequent public performance, perhaps because musical fashions were changing.

A modern version of the &quot;purported dangers&quot; claims that players suffered lead poisoning because armonicas were made of lead glass. However, there is no known scientific basis for the theory that merely touching lead glass can cause lead poisoning. Lead poisoning was common in the 18th and early 19th centuries for both armonica players and non-players alike; doctors prescribed lead compounds for a long list of ailments, and lead or lead oxide was used as a food preservative and in cookware and eating utensils. Trace amounts of lead that armonica players in Franklin&#x27;s day received from their instruments would likely have been dwarfed by lead from other sources, such as the lead-content paint used to mark visual identification of the bowls to the players.

Historical replicas by Eisch use so-called &quot;White Crystal&quot; developed in the 18th c. replacing the lead with a higher potash content; many modern newly invented devices, such as those made by Finkenbeiner, are made from so-called Quartz &quot;pure silica glass&quot; – a glass formulation developed in the early 20th c. for scientific purposes.

==Perception of the sound==
The disorienting quality of the ethereal sound is due in part to the way that humans perceive and locate ranges of sounds. Above 4 kHz people primarily use the &quot;loudness&quot; of the sound to differentiate between left and right ears and thus triangulate, or locate the source. Below 1 kHz, they use the &quot;phase differences&quot; of sound waves arriving at their left and right ears to identify location. The predominant pitch of the armonica is in the range of 1–4 kHz, which coincides with the sound range where the brain is &quot;not quite sure&quot;, and thus listeners have difficulty locating it in space (where it comes from), and discerning the source of the sound (the materials and techniques used to produce it).

Benjamin Franklin himself described the harmonica&#x27;s tones as &quot;incomparably sweet&quot;. The full quotation, written in a letter to Giambattista Beccaria, is: &quot;The advantages of this instrument are that its tones are incomparably sweet beyond those of any other; that they may be swelled and softened at pleasure by stronger or weaker pressures of the finger, and continued to any length; and that the instrument, once well tuned, never again wants tuning.&quot;

A music critic for the &quot;Morning Chronicle&quot;, writing of a performance by Kirchgessner in 1794, said, &quot;Her taste is chastened and the dulcet notes of the instrument would be delightful indeed, were they more powerful and articulate; but that we believe the most perfect execution cannot make them. In a smaller room and an audience less numerous, the effect must be enchanting. Though the accompaniments were kept very much under, they were still occasionally too loud.&quot;

==Modern revival==

Music for glass harmonica was rare from 1820 until the 1930s (although Gaetano Donizetti intended for the aria &quot;Il dolce suono&quot; from his 1835 opera &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; to be accompanied by a glass harmonica, and Richard Strauss specified use of the instrument in his 1919 opera &quot;Die Frau ohne Schatten&quot;), when German virtuoso Bruno Hoffmann began revitalizing interest in his individual goblet instrument version that he named the glass harp for his stunning performances. Playing his &quot;glass harp&quot; (with Eisch manufactured custom designed glasses mounted in a case designed with underlying resonance chamber) he transcribed or rearranged much of the literature written for the mechanized instrument, and commissioned contemporary composers to write new pieces for his goblet version.

Franklin&#x27;s glass harmonica design was reworked yet again without patent credit by master glassblower and musician, Gerhard B. Finkenbeiner (1930–1999) in 1984. After thirty years of experimentation, Finkenbeiner&#x27;s imitative prototype consisted of clear glasses and glasses later equipped with gold bands mimicking late 18th-century designs. The historical instruments with gold bands indicated the equivalent of the black keys on the piano, simplifying the multi-hued painted bowl rims with white accidentals as specified by Franklin. Finkenbeiner Inc., of Waltham, Massachusetts, continues to produce versions of these instruments commercially , featuring glass elements made of scientific formulated fused-silica quartz.

From 1989 on to now, Sascha Reckert, a German glass instrumentalist and glass instrument producer, restored and reproduced glass armonicas from the original using crystal glass with full bass range, required for the original compositions. He did the first performance with glass armonica of &quot;Lucia die Lammermoor&quot; (Munich state opera) and &quot;Frau ohne Schatten&quot; in a full scene production, and invented the Verrophon with glass tubes, with a more powerful sound. Reckert also produced the harmonicas of Dennis James, the Wiener Glasharmonikaduo, Martin Hilmer and others.

French instrument makers and artists Bernard and François Baschet invented a modern variation of the Chladni Euphone in 1952, the &quot;crystal organ&quot; or Cristal di Baschet, which consists of up to 52 chromatically tuned resonating metal rods that are set into motion by attached glass rods that are rubbed with wet fingers. The Cristal di Baschet differs mainly from the other glass instruments in that the identical length and thickness glass rods are set horizontally, and attach to the tuned metal stems that have added metal blocks for increasing resonance. The result is a fully acoustic instrument, and impressive amplification obtained using fiberglass or metal cones fixed on wood and by a tall cut-out multi-resonant metal part in the shape of a flame. Some thin added metallic wires resembling cat whiskers are placed under the instrument, supposedly to increase the sound power of high-pitched frequencies.

Dennis James recorded an album of all glass music, &quot;Cristal: Glass Music Through the Ages&quot; co-produced by Linda Ronstadt and Grammy Award-winning producer John Boylan. James plays the glass harmonica, the Cristal di Baschet, and the Seraphim on the CD in original historical compositions and new arrangements for glass by Mozart, Scarlatti, Schnaubelt, and Fauré and collaborates on the recording with the Emerson String Quartet, operatic soprano Ruth Ann Swenson, and Ronstadt. James played glass instruments on Marco Beltrami&#x27;s film scores for &quot;The Minus Man&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Faculty&quot; (1998). &quot;I first became aware of glass instruments at about the age of 6 while visiting the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. I can still recall being mesmerized by the appearance of the original Benjamin Franklin harmonica then on display in its own showcase in the entry rotunda of the city&#x27;s famed science museum.&quot; When Ronstadt joined Dolly Parton and Emmylou Harris to make the 1999 album &quot;Trio II&quot;, Dennis James played the glass harmonica in their cover of &quot;After the Gold Rush&quot;.

James Horner used a glass harmonica and pan flute for Spock&#x27;s theme in the 1982 film &quot;Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan&quot;. On February 23, 2007, the armonica was used by nu-metal band Korn while filming their session with MTV Unplugged. It was stated that it was of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s design.

<text>Michael Feldman (born March 14, 1949) is an American radio personality. He is the host of &quot;Michael Feldman&#x27;s Whad&#x27;Ya Know?&quot;, formerly a radio show distributed by Public Radio International and now a podcast. His former announcer, Jim Packard, referred to him as &quot;The Sage of Wisconsin.&quot; He has given himself the title of &quot;Producer Internationale,&quot; and also refers to Public Radio International on-air as &quot;The International House of Radio.&quot;

Raised in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Feldman graduated from the University of Wisconsin–Madison with a degree in English in 1970. He worked as a teacher at Malcolm Shabazz City High School in Madison, Wisconsin, before finding work at radio station WORT. Soon after, he worked as a cab driver before coming back to broadcasting, first at Wisconsin Public Radio (WPR) in Madison, then at WGN (AM). His show was canceled by WGN in 1984 and he returned to WPR in 1985 to produce and host &quot;Michael Feldman&#x27;s Whad&#x27;Ya Know?&quot;, in conjunction with Wisconsin Public Radio for Public Radio International. In 2015 Whad&#x27;ya Know? celebrated its 30th anniversary, and is nearing its 1,000th broadcast.

Feldman is the author of several books: &quot;Wisconsin Curiosities: Quirky Characters, Roadside Oddities &amp; Other Offbeat Stuff&quot;; &quot;Something I Said?: Innuendo and Out the Other&quot;; &quot;Thanks for the Memos&quot;; &quot;Glad You Asked: Intriguing Names, Facts, and Ideas For the Curious-Minded&quot;; &quot;Whad&#x27;ya Know, Test Your Knowledge&quot;; &quot;Whad&#x27;ya Know?&quot;; and &quot;Whad&#x27;ya Knowledge&quot;.

Feldman has produced three CD compilations of his radio show, &quot;Roadkill! The Best of Michael Feldman&#x27;s Whad&#x27;ya Know... On the Road&quot; and &quot;Why Not: Best of Michael Feldman&#x27;s Whad&#x27;ya Know&quot;, &quot;The First 25 Are the Hardest&quot;, a celebration of 25 years of Whad&#x27;ya Know, and the music CD &quot;Her Country: The Songs of Michael Feldman&quot; with John Sieger and the Skeletons.

<text>Andrew Richard Rosindell MP (; born 17 March 1966) is a British Conservative Party politician who has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Romford since 2001.

He has been the international director of the European Foundation, chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Flags and Heraldry Committee and the UK&#x27;s All-Party Parliamentary Group on the British Overseas Territories. Rosindell holds socially conservative and Eurosceptic political views; he campaigned for Brexit and was one of the 28 original Conservative MPs who rebelled against Theresa May&#x27;s Brexit withdrawal agreement in 2019.

==Early life and career==
Andrew Rosindell was born on 17 March 1966 in Romford, London, as the son of a school dinner lady. Rosindell attended Marshalls Park School. He joined the Conservative Party at the age of 14.

He was chairman of the Young Conservatives from 1993 to 1994, chairman of the International Young Democrat Union from 1998 to 2002, and from 1997 to 2001, he was director of the European Foundation think tank. 

Before becoming an MP, he was a local councillor in Romford on Havering Council, winning the Chase Cross and Havering-atte-Bower ward from the Liberal Democrats in 1990 with a 25% swing. In 1998, he held the council seat and took an 88% share of the vote.

==Parliamentary career==
At the 1992 general election, Rosindell stood as the Conservative candidate in Glasgow Provan, coming third with 7.8% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Jimmy Wray and the Liberal Democrat candidate.

Rosindell stood in Thurrock at the 1997 general election, coming second with 26.8% of the vote behind the incumbent Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay.

Rosindell was elected to the House of Commons at the 2001 general election as MP for Romford with 53% of the vote and a majority of 5,977. Former Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher visited the constituency during the campaign, in which Rosindell also canvassed with his Staffordshire Bull Terrier Spike, who wore a union flag waistcoat. This was a tactic Rosindell had employed previously, such as his campaign in Glasgow Provan in 1992.

At the 2005 election, Rosindell was re-elected as MP for Romford with an increased vote share of 59.1% and an increased majority of 11,589.

At the beginning of the MPs&#x27; expenses scandal, in June 2009, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Rosindell &quot;claimed more than £125,000 in second home expenses for a flat in London, while designating his childhood home 17 miles away – where his mother lived – as his main address&quot;, and between &quot;2006 and 2008 claimed the maximum £400 a month for food&quot;.

In March 2010, the BBC reported that Rosindell had breached Parliamentary rules by accepting subsidised overseas trips to Gibraltar and subsequently raising multiple Gibraltar-related issues in Parliament without disclosing the trips in the Register of Members&#x27; Interests.

Rosindell was again re-elected at the 2010 general election, with a decreased vote share of 56% and an increased majority of 16,954.

In September 2010, Rosindell sponsored the first Erotica event to be held in the Houses of Parliament. Rosindell maintained that he was promoting the hosts, a Romford-based business, as was his duty as the constituency MP.

In June 2012, Rosindell was criticised for expressing &quot;huge admiration&quot; for former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet. The comments were condemned by Labour Leader Ed Miliband and neighbouring Labour MP Jon Cruddas, who stated in an interview with the &quot;Romford Recorder&quot; that &quot;Augusto Pinochet assumed power in a coup d&#x27;état and overthrew a democratically elected government. According to various reports and investigations thousands of people were killed in this process, and tens of thousands were interned and tortured by his regime&quot;. Rosindell made the comments whilst defending a local colleague who had been criticised for apparently endorsing Pinochet, and stated that Pinochet had overthrown a &quot;far worse&quot; communist regime and that &quot;we should be grateful&quot; for the assistance Pinochet&#x27;s Chile provided to the British forces retaking the Falkland Islands.

In February 2015, Rosindell cast doubt on the ability of Rachel Reeves (then Shadow Secretary of State for Work and Pensions) to handle that ministerial responsibility in a potential post-election Labour cabinet, as she would be taking maternity leave soon after the election and would then have a young child to care for following her return to the post in September. He was criticised for the remarks by Labour MPs, whilst Conservative leader and Prime Minister David Cameron described his comments as &quot;outrageous&quot;.

At the 2015 general election, Rosindell was again re-elected, with a decreased vote share of 51% and a decreased majority of 13,859.

Since the start of 2016, Rosindell has been a member of the Advisory Board of the UK-based &#x27;Polar Regions&#x27; think-tank &quot;Polar Research and Policy Initiative&quot;. 

Rosindell was again re-elected at the snap 2017 general election, with an increased vote share of 59.4% and a decreased majority of 13,778.

In June 2018, Rosindell co-sponsored a Bill with Lord Empey to use Libyan funds frozen under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter, to compensate victims of IRA terrorism supported by the Gaddafi regime.

On 4 July 2018, Rosindell announced his bid to become the Conservative candidate for Mayor of London at the 2020 mayoral election. He failed to make the final shortlist.

In January 2019, &quot;The Times&quot; discovered that Rosindell&#x27;s Facebook account was a member of a group supporting far-right activist Tommy Robinson. The group was specifically concerned with supporting Robinson after he was jailed for contempt of court. Rosindell said that he had been added to the group without his knowledge; however, according to &quot;The Times&quot;, it would be necessary for a Facebook user to confirm acceptance before being added to a group.

At the 2019 general election, Rosindell was again re-elected, with an increased vote share of 64.6% and an increased majority of 17,893.

On 21 October 2020, Rosindell was removed as trade envoy to Tanzania, a position to which he had been appointed to by Theresa May in 2018, because of his highly critical views against Boris Johnson&#x27;s three-tier lockdown plan to tackle the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK.

In November 2021, during an interview on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot;, Rosindell said he was cautious about the idea of MPs being banned from having second jobs. He said MPs are &quot;human beings who have families and responsibilities&quot; but that the first duty of MPs &quot;must be to Parliament, to our constituency and to the work we do for our country.&quot;

&quot;Politico&quot; reported in December 2022 that Rosindell was among a small group of about ten backbench MPs who have made a large number of overseas visits while in office. Rosindell&#x27;s travel record included 16 trips to Gibraltar and 29 trips to other countries, valued at around £45,247.

Rosindell was again re-elected at the 2024 general election, with a decreased vote share of 34.8% and a decreased majority of 1,463.

In Kemi Badenoch&#x27;s first shadow cabinet, Rosindell was appointed Shadow Parliamentary Secretary for Foreign Affairs.

== Political views ==

Rosindell&#x27;s political views are socially conservative and Thatcherite: he is a Eurosceptic, who supports the re-introduction of the death penalty and the detention of asylum seekers. A 2002 BBC profile called him &quot;a right-wing populist&quot;. He is also a member of the right-wing group The Freedom Association and is a supporter of the Blue Collar Conservatives. He was a member of the Monday Club, a Conservative-aligned organisation on the right of the party, until he was compelled to resign in 2001 by the party&#x27;s then-leader Iain Duncan Smith.

Following an interim report on the connections between colonialism and properties now in the care of the National Trust, including links with historic slavery, Rosindell was among the signatories of a letter to &quot;The Telegraph&quot; in November 2020 from the &quot;Common Sense Group&quot; of Conservative Parliamentarians. The letter accused the National Trust of being &quot;coloured by cultural Marxist dogma, colloquially known as the &#x27;woke agenda&#x27;&quot;. He is the Hon. President and Patron of the Royalists. 

===LGBT issues===
Rosindell has consistently voted against bills furthering LGBT rights, including equalising the age of consent, civil partnerships and scrapping Section 28 of the Local Government Act 1988, which banned teachers from &quot;promoting homosexuality&quot; or &quot;teaching ... the acceptability of homosexuality as a pretended family relationship&quot;. He has said, &quot;I do not believe that politicians should interfere with and attempt to redefine ancient customs, traditions and ceremonies, most of which are based on religious foundations and have been in existence through the ages.&quot;

In 2013, Rosindell opposed the legalisation of same-sex marriage, stating: &quot;Where would it end? You could finish up at a stage where the monarchy in this country is in a same-sex marriage and that would have constitutional implications.&quot;

=== Euroscepticism and border control ===

In 2012, Rosindell unsuccessfully attempted to introduce the United Kingdom Borders Bill, a private member&#x27;s bill aiming to create a dedicated entry queue for citizens of countries where the British Queen is head of state, as well as introducing pictures of the Queen and more royal symbols at UK borders. He reiterated calls for preferential treatment of &quot;Her Majesty&#x27;s subjects&quot; visiting Britain in 2015, whilst also calling for the immigration system to favour Commonwealth citizens, as opposed to those from the EU. This measure was then adopted by Chancellor Philip Hammond in his October 2018 budget.

Rosindell has spoken in favour of a federal UK and in 2014 proposed a bill calling for a separate English Parliament, whilst declaring himself opposed to the idea of imposing English votes for English laws restrictions on the Westminster Parliament.

In September 2015, Rosindell presented a Ten Minute Rule Bill to Parliament entitled the United Kingdom Borders (Control and Sovereignty) Bill. In his speech presenting the Bill, he argued that Britain must take back control of its borders from the European Union, asserting that &quot;A nation that does not retain sovereignty over its national borders will ultimately be powerless to determine its own destiny&quot;. The speech also advocated a policy of controlled immigration, arguing that public services were unable to keep up with the number of people entering the country every year.

In an early day motion of 3 November 2016, as a celebration of the Brexit vote and Britain withdrawing from the European Union, Rosindell argued for a return to the broadcasting of &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; at the end of BBC One transmissions each day. The practice was dropped in 1997 (ostensibly due to BBC One adopting 24-hour broadcasting by simulcasting BBC News 24 overnight, rendering closedown obsolete). That evening, BBC Two&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; programme ended its nightly broadcast with host Kirsty Wark saying that they were &quot;incredibly happy to oblige&quot; Rosindell&#x27;s request, before ending with a clip of the Sex Pistols performing the punk song of the same name (an anti-monarchist song), much to Rosindell&#x27;s discontent.

In 2017, Rosindell said: &quot;The humiliation of having a pink European Union passport will now soon be over and the United Kingdom nationals can once again feel pride and self-confidence in their own nationality when travelling, just as the Swiss and Americans can do. National identity matters and there is no better way of demonstrating this today than by bringing back this much-loved national symbol when travelling overseas.&quot;

=== Foreign affairs ===

In July 2010, Rosindell was appointed by the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Sayeeda Warsi, onto the board of the Westminster Foundation for Democracy. Since 2015, Rosindell has served on the Foreign Affairs Select Committee.

Rosindell proposed in 2012 that Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories should be represented in the UK parliament, like dependencies of Australia, Denmark, France and the Netherlands have been.

During the police action surrounding the 2017 Catalan independence referendum, Rosindell spoke out in his capacity as the vice-chairman of the APPG on Catalonia to say the UK should have sent a &#x27;much stronger&#x27; message about condemning the Spanish government&#x27;s reaction, saying the violence &quot;brought shame on Spain and shame on the European Union&quot;.

=== Animal welfare ===

In 2012, Rosindell became chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Zoos and Aquariums Group.

Rosindell joined Philip Davies and Christopher Chope in repeatedly blocking a backbench bill banning the use of wild animals in circuses from progressing through Parliament, finally blocking it by lodging an objection in March 2015. Rosindell had earlier argued the circus is a &quot;Great British institution…[that] deserves to be defended against the propaganda and exaggerations&quot;. The bill had the support of the Coalition government, the Labour opposition and public opinion.

== Flags and heraldry ==

Rosindell is well known for his interest in flags, being described by &quot;The Times&quot; in 2011 as a &quot;flag fanatic&quot;. He is a member of the Flag Institute, an educational organisation that offers advice and guidance about flags and their usage.

On 5 February 2008, Rosindell became founding chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Flag Group (APPFG), and proposed a Union Flag Bill under the Ten Minute Rule. The APPFG changed its name to the Flags &amp; Heraldry Committee in April 2010.

In April 2021 Rosindell joined other Conservative Party members in calling for the Union Flag to be flown outside UK schools.

== Sexual assault allegation== 

In May 2022, Rosindell was arrested by the Metropolitan Police on suspicion of indecent assault, sexual assault, rape, abuse of position of trust, and misconduct in public office. He had been under investigation since January 2020 for events occurring between 2002 and 2009, when he was a whip and shadow minister. He persistently denied any wrongdoing.

In February 2024, the Metropolitan Police concluded that the evidence held did not meet the threshold for prosecution and that no further action would be taken. A spokesperson for Rosindell stated that &quot;He has been working constantly for Romford throughout the past 21 months and will continue to speak up for the people of his beloved home town as their local MP.&quot;

<doc id="352758" wikidata="Q1080643" url="?curid=352758" title="Akizuki Tanezane">
<text>was a samurai warrior and daimyo in 16th century Japan. He was a member of the Akizuki clan from Chikuzen Province, son of Akizuki Fumitane; his father was defeated by the Ōtomo clan. in 1564.

== Biography ==
Following his father death by Otomo, Akizuki Tanezane sought assistance from the Mōri clan. Following the defeat of the Mōri in northern Kyushu at the hands of the Ōtomo, the Akizuki turned to the Shimazu clan for assistance. In 1567, Tanezane, has manage to recapture the castle of Mount Kosho from the Ōtomo clan and made his intention clear to fight against them. In response, Sorin sent Tachibana Dōsetsu, Usuki Akisumi, and Yoshihiro Akimasa with 20,000 soldiers on August 14 to punish Tanezane. The Ōtomo army first engaged the Akizuki clan forces at the Battle of Amamizu and Haseyama (also known as the Battle of Uryuno) on August 14, and on the 15th, and captured Ojo, a branch castle of Yasumimatsu Castle, causing the commander of the castle, Moromasa Sakata, to commit suicide.

Dōsetsu then stationed his army around Yasumomatsu castle, in preparation to capture Mount Kosho Castle. However, the castle was defended firmly and the siege dragged on. Subsequently, rumors circulated that a huge Mōri clan army in Chugoku region planned to invade Ojo, which prompted the Ōtomo forces to withdraw from the siege of Mount Kosho. Later, the Ōtomo army abandonned Yasumimatsu castle and began retreating in the morning of September 3. In response, Tanezane decided to sally out to give chase against the withdrawing Ōtomo army by dividing his 12,000 troops into four groups under the command of Kankage Intosho, Sanehisa Uchida Zenbei, over 3,000 cavalry, and Ayabe Suruga no Kami, over 5,000 cavalry. Dōsetsu already anticipated this movement by leading a rearguard with 3,000 soldiers with the assistance of his lieutenants, Bekki Shigetsura, Ono Shizuyuki, and Korenobu Yufu, with each of them leading 500 to 600 cavalry.

During this attack, at first the assault forces of Tanezane manage to inflict losses as they killed one of Dōsetsu&#x27;s most trusted generals, Koretada Totoki. However, the rearguard detachment of Dōsetsu managed to reverse the situation and inflicted heavy losses upon Tanezane troops, forcing them to retreat. Later at night, Tanezane once again launched an assault this time with 4,000 soldiers in a night raid. The unexpected night attack by the Akizuki forces threw the Ōtomo army into chaos, and they suffered heavy losses with the total number of casualties being over 400, throwing the latter&#x27;s force into panic. Dōsetsu managed to return order onto his troops and organize a retreat, however, Tanezane order his troops to pursue the fleeing Dōsetsu further, as they continued to pursue them as far as Chikugo Yamakuma Castle, forcing the Ōtomo army to suffer even more casualties. Many of Dōsetsu&#x27;s clansmen were killed in this battle, such as Bekki Akitaka, Bekki Chikashige, Bekki Chikamune.

In 1569 Dōsetsu captured the Yamakuma Castle from Tanezane during autumn.

In 1578 on December 11–13, Tanezane worked together with Tsukushi Hirokado and Ryūzōji Takanobu to invade Chikuzen, while Dōsetsu and his army worked hard to defend those territories.

In 1579 of mid January, Dōsetsu participated in the second Ōtomo invasion of Tsukushi province and Dazaifu town against the Akizuki clan, forcing Akizuki Tanezane to abandon his siege of Takatoriyama Castle. After that, Dōsetsu besieged the Iwaya castle for the second time. In March, Dōsetsu besieged the Iwaya castle for the third time subsequently with some clashes against the forces of Akizuki Tanezane. Following that, Dōsetsu engaged against Akizuki clan forces in the battle of Yatake, Chikuzen province. In July 27, Dōsetsu repulsed a joint attack from Tanezane and Harada Nobutane.

In 1580, from November 3 until December, Dōsetsu fought against the forces of Akizuki Tanezane and Munakata Ujisada respectively.

In 1581, Dōsetsu participated in the several engagements across against Akizuki Tanezane. First, Dōsetsu fought against Tanezane and Ujisada in the battle of Koganebara, which was recorded in history as the largest military engagement ever happened in Kurate until at that time. In this battle, Dōsetsu has inflicted a crushing defeat on his enemies, which left the territories under the control of Ujisada vulnerable to further incursions by Dōsetsu&#x27;s army. Later, Dōsetsu fought against Tanezane again in Shimizuhara, and Takatori castle. In July 27, Dōsetsu and Shigetane Shigetane fought against Tsukushi Hirokado and Akizuki Tanezane in the second battle of Dazaifu Kanzeon-ji. It is in this battle that, Takahashi Munetora, who will be known as Tachibana Muneshige, saw his first notable action.

On April 16, 1582, during the Battle of Iwato against the combined forces of 2,000 from the Akizuki, Harada, and Munakata clans, Dōsetsu led a 500-strong ambush force and surrounded his 1,000-strong main force. 300 of Muneshige&#x27;s troops launched a surprise attack from the side with guns, while the remaining 200 soldiers were led by Komono Masutoki, who set up a false flag to make it look like reinforcements from the Otomo clan were coming, and finally managed to lift the siege. Muneshige then led 1,000 cavalry including Komono Masutoki, Korenobu Yufu, and Shigeyuki Ono, eliminating 300 of the Harada general&#x27;s troops, Kasa Okinaga, who had built a fort at Iwatosho Kubeno, killing 150 of them, and pursuing them west to Sawara County, where he burned down Harada Chikahide&#x27;s Sawara Castle. On November 6, Dōsetsu marched to Kama and Honami along with Muneshige and, and Shigetane. While on their way to the rescue of Kutami Akiyasu, the Tachibana and Takahashi forces received information that Akiyasu had safely retreated after fighting Akizuki Tanezane and Monjūjo Munekage (the great uncle of Munekage) in the Battle of Haratsuru, so they retreated. However, Tanezane forces turns out still pursuing them. Both fierce battles resulted in over 1,000 casualties, including over 300 casualties from Tachibana and Takahashi, and 760 for the Akizuki clan.

In 1585, Tanezane supported the Shimazu in an offensive against the Ōtomo at the Siege of Iwaya Castle. Later, Tanezane participated in anti-Ōtomo alliance invasion led by Ryūzōji Ieharu. With a total army of 30,000, the alliance attacked Kurume. The Ōtomo forces led by Tachibana Dōsetsu and Takahashi Shigetane manage to score a series of victories over the numerically superior allied focers with a combination of brilliant maneuvers and tactics in three separate battles: in the end, the alliance siege against the town failed.

In 1586, he and Shimazu Yoshihisa marched to attack Otomo&#x27;s Tachibana castle.

In 1587, he fought with Shimazu against Toyotomi Hideyoshi in Kyūshū, an island of Japan.

In 1596, Tanezane was succeeded by his son Tanenaga. After the Battle of Sekigahara, Tanenaga was transferred to Takanabe han (in Hyuga, 20,000 koku).

<text>The , descended from the Emperor Uda (868–897) by the Kyogoku clan, descending from the Sasaki clan (Uda Genji).

Kyogoku Takahisa in the 14th century, lived in Amako-go (Izumo Province), and took the name &#x27;Amago&#x27;. The family crest is also the one of the Kyogoku clan. 

They were Shugodai (vice-Governors) of Izumo and Oki provinces for generations, for the Kyogoku Shugo branch, and their seat was Gassan Toda castle.

In 1484, Amago Tsunehisa (1458–1541), was deprived of the position of Shugodai by Kyogoku Masatsune, who was the Shugo, because he did not obey the request of tax from the Muromachi bakufu, and was expelled from Gassan Toda castle. Although Enya Kamonnosuke was dispatched to Gassan Toda castle as the new Shugodai, Tsunehisa recaptured Gassan Toda castle by a surprise attack in 1486, took control of Izumo, and developed the Amago clan into a Sengoku Daimyo clan.

The Amago fought the Ōuchi clan or the Mōri clan (who had been among their vassals), during Japan&#x27;s Sengoku period.

For much of the next hundred years, the clan battled with the Ōuchi and Mōri, who controlled neighboring provinces, and fell into decline when Gassantoda Castle fell to the Mōri in 1566.

Amago Katsuhisa tried to regain prestige for the clan by joining the forces of Oda Nobunaga, invaded Tajima and Inaba Provinces, but was defeated and died in the siege of Kōzuki by the Mōri in 1578.

<text>was a &quot;daimyō&quot; warlord in the Izumo Province, Chūgoku region of western Japan. He was the second son of Amago Masahisa. Initially named Akihisa (詮久), he changed his name to Haruhisa in 1541 after Ashikaga Yoshiharu offered to let him use a &quot;kanji&quot; character from his name.

==Biography==
After his father Amago Masahisa died early in battle, Haruhisa became the head of Amago clan in 1537 after his grandfather stepped down. He launched a series of invasions to expand his domain, going as far as Harima. His childhood name was 

In 1540, the Siege of Koriyama against Mōri Motonari ended in a humiliating defeat, and many of his retainers defected believing that Haruhisa&#x27;s days were numbered. His grandfather Amago Tsunehisa died the next year and Ōuchi Yoshitaka launched a counterattack to finish the Amago clan.

Amago Haruhisa successfully defended Toda castle in the 1542–43 Siege of Toda Castle. Haruhisa managed to stave off the invasion, encouraging those retainers who had defected earlier, and after gathering enough troops, managed to repel it. From this point, Haruhisa worked to secure his footing and control of such domains as Izumo, Hōki, Mimasaka, and Oki. When on 1551, Ōuchi Yoshitaka was killed by Sue Harukata&#x27;s rebellion, in 1552, the Muromachi shogunate offered Haruhisa lordship over eight domains including those four domains he already fully controlled.

In his later years, Haruhisa suddenly decided to kill his uncle Amago Kunihisa as well as those retainers under him collectively called &quot;Shingūtō&quot; (新宮党) from the town &quot;Shingū&quot; which was their power base, resulting in a serious shortage of battle-proven leaders. While it was generally thought, largely from various fiction works that emphasize Mori Motonari&#x27;s prowess, that this action was carried out by Motonari in order to weaken Haruhisa&#x27;s power, it is now thought most likely that this was a move by Haruhisa himself to solidify control of the Amago clan.

When Sue Harutaka was defeated by Mori Motonari and died in the Battle of Miyajima, Haruhisa saw an opportunity to claim Iwami and making an alliance with Ogasawara clan of Iwami, moved to claim Omori Silver Mine. Motonari launched a counterattack and both clashed in a string of battles with no clear winner. Haruhisa collapsed in Gassantoda Castle in late 1560 while engaged in a battle against Motonari and died on 9 January 1561.

It is written in Unyo Gunjitsuki that Amago Hisayuki commented that Haruhisa was &quot;Quick to act, lacking in the discipline of a general; quick to seek battle, lacking in forgiveness.&quot;

<text>was a remnant of the Amago clan, a powerful feudal clan in the Chūgoku region of Japan, backed up by Yamanaka Yukimori, a vassal of the clan.

He was born to Amago Masahisa in 1553. In the following year, Katsuhisa&#x27;s father and grandfather were killed by Amago Haruhisa, leading Katsuhisa to become a Buddhist monk. 

In 1566, after the Amago clan was overthrown by Mōri Motonari, Amago Katsuhisa fled to the island of Oki. Later in 1568, Katsuhisa departed from Oki Province to restore the Amago clan with support from Yamanaka Yukimori. 

In 1569, Katsuhisa entered Izumo from Oki Province and set-up a base in Shinyama Castle. He besieged Gassantoda Castle, but failed, owing to a fierce defense by Amano Takashige. 

In February 1570, Katsuhisa experienced a bitter defeat to Mōri Terumoto at the Battle of Fubeyama, he fleeing to Kyōto. 

In 1574, Katsuhisa allied with Yamana Toyokuni to attempt an invasion to captured Tajima and Inaba provinces.

In 1578, Katsuhisa defending Kozuki Castle for Oda clan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi against the Mōri clan, but was attacked by Kobayakawa Takakage and Kikkawa Motoharu in Siege of Kōzuki Castle, he was defeated, and committed suicide.

<text>was a Japanese warlord during the Sengoku period of western Honshu. He was a son of Amago Tsunehisa.

A principle Amako general under Tsunehisa, he led a force that came to be nicknamed the &quot;Shingū army&quot;. Kunihisa&#x27;s faction was named Shingūtō (新宮党) after the town, &quot;Shingū&quot;, which was based in a valley north-east of Gassan-Toda where Kunihisa built his residence. Under his father, he fought in campaigns in Aki and Bingo provinces during the 1520s and alongside Amago Haruhisa at the Siege of Koriyama Castle in 1540. In 1544 he defeated a Mōri army but lost his second son, Toyohisa, at the bitterly fought Battle of Hashizugawa in 1546 against Takeda Kuninobu of Inaba Province.

After Amago Masahisa was killed in 1518 Kunihisa acted as a guardian for the former&#x27;s son, Amako Haruhisa (Akihisa). He had been called &quot;On the military matters, he is like a kami and an oni&quot; from his father, Tsunehisa. But he often looked down on those who did not do well on the battlefield and was obnoxious from time to time.

In spite of his many services to the Amako clan, Kunihisa came to be distrusted by Haruhisa, his nephew and the &quot;daimyō&quot; after Tsunehisa&#x27;s death. One possible reason for Haruhisa&#x27;s hostility towards Kunihisa and his Shingu faction is that they displayed increasing arrogance as their fame from their war service grew.

In 1554, Kunihisa was killed by Amago Haruhisa on the suspicion of treason on 25 November 1554 along with his eldest son Sanehisa and two grandsons, including a number of his retainers. His third son Takehisa would commit suicide the next day. The act was supposedly carried out after Mōri Motonari tricked Haruhisa into believing that Kunihisa intended to take over the Amago clan but one of the reasons may be that Kunihisa had been too arrogant towards the young Haruhisa.

Regardless of the motive for the act, the death of Kunihisa and the purge of his faction significantly damaged the Amago clan and arguably contributed towards the clan&#x27;s fall to their rival, the Mōri clan, in the 1570s.

<text>was the third son of Tsunehisa. His childhood name was Hikoshirō (彦四郎). He also called himself for the domain he ruled.

He received Enya of east Izumo Province and used Mount Yōgai (要害山) for his castle. Like his elder brother Kunihisa, he was skilled in warfare. Not satisfied with the size of his domain, he demanded another 700 &quot;Kan&quot; in addition to 3000 Kan he already owned. He raised a revolt against Tsunehisa in 1532 suspecting Kamei Hidetsuna, the chief advisor to Tsunehisa had been plotting against him. The Amago clan split into two and Kamei Toshitsuna, Hidetsuna&#x27;s younger brother died fighting for Okihisa. He was driven out of Enya and escaped. In 1534, he committed seppuku realizing that he would never be able to return to the clan.

<text>was a powerful warlord who gained the hegemony in Chūgoku region, Japan starting as a vassal of the Rokkaku clan. He ruled the domains of Inaba, Hōki, Izumo, Iwami, Oki, Harima, Mimasaka, Bizen, Bitchū, Bingo, and Aki.

Tsunehisa was the eldest son of Amago Kiyosada. His childhood name was Matashiro (又四郎). In 1473, he was already his father&#x27;s deputy and dealt with the Rokkaku clan on taxation of goods passing through the Amago clan&#x27;s domain. He became a deputy governor of Izumo province in 1477 and received a letter &quot;Kei&quot; (経) from Governor Kyogoku Masatsune, but was expelled by the Muromachi Ashikaga clan in 1484. He came back two years later taking the Rokkaku clan stronghold of Tomidajo with less than one hundred of his troops. He gained full control of Izumo in 1508 by successfully subjugating powerful regional clans, called &quot;kokujin&quot;.

When Ōuchi Yoshioki marched upon Kyoto in 1508 in support of Ashikaga Yoshitada, Tsunehisa took advantage of Yoshioki&#x27;s distraction and secretly communicated with &quot;kokujin&quot; all over the Chūgoku region to counter the powerful Ōuchi clan. He lost his eldest son and heir apparent Amago Masahisa in 1513 battling Sakurai Masamune but finally succeeded in controlling 11 domains by the 1520s. Samurai in Iwami and Aki were forced to walk a tightrope between Amago and Ōuchi. Mōri Motonari, who would eventually emerge victorious against both Amago and Ōuchi, was one such samurai.

Tsunehisa&#x27;s late years were troubled by constant internal troubles. In 1532, at the age of 74, he was forced to crush a revolt by his third son Amago Okihisa and was left without an heir. In 1538, he handed over the Amago clan to his grandson Amago Haruhisa and three years later, Tsunehisa died from illness, fearing young Haruhisa might be too inexperienced. Tsunehisa&#x27;s burial name is
&quot;興国院月叟省心大居士&quot; and he is buried in Dokoji of Shimane prefecture.

He was the eldest son of Haruhisa and he was given the childhood name of . After his father&#x27;s sudden death in 1560, he became the head of the clan to continue the fight against the Mōri clan. While besieged in Gassantoda Castle, Yoshihisa had a retainer, Uyama Hisakane executed after fearing betrayal. This caused most of his remaining troops to desert and on 1566, he surrendered to Mōri Motonari. Yoshihisa was permitted to become a monk and was held captive at Enmeiji.

<doc id="352783" wikidata="Q2393320" url="?curid=352783" title="Phylogenesis">
<text>Phylogenesis (from Greek φῦλον &quot;phylon&quot; &quot;tribe&quot; + γένεσις &quot;genesis&quot; &quot;origin&quot;) is the biological process by which a taxon (of any rank) appears. The science that studies these processes is called phylogenetics.

These terms may be confused with the term phylogenetics, the application of molecular - analytical methods (i.e. molecular biology and genomics), in the explanation of phylogeny and its research.

Phylogenetic relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or overall morpho-anatomical, ethological, and other characteristics.

== Phylogeny ==
The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) – a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecological genetics and genomes.

== Cladistics ==
Cladistics (Greek , &quot;klados&quot;, i.e. &quot;branch&quot;) is an approach to biological classification in which organisms are categorized based on shared, derived characteristics that can be traced to a group&#x27;s most recent common ancestor and are not present in more distant ancestors. Therefore, members of a group are assumed to share a common history and are considered to be closely related.

The cladistic method interprets each character state transformation implied by the distribution of shared character states among taxa (or other terminals) as a potential piece of evidence for grouping. The outcome of a cladistic analysis is a cladogram – a tree-shaped diagram (dendrogram) that is interpreted to represent the best hypothesis of phylogenetic relationships.

Although traditionally such cladograms were generated largely on the basis of morphological characteristics calculated by hand, genetic sequencing data and computational phylogenetics are now commonly used and the parsimony criterion has been abandoned by many phylogeneticists in favor of more &quot;sophisticated&quot; (but less parsimonious) evolutionary models of character state transformation.

== Taxonomy ==
Taxonomy (Greek language , &quot;taxis&quot; = &#x27;order&#x27;, &#x27;arrangement&#x27; + , &quot;nomos&quot; = &#x27;law&#x27; or &#x27;science&#x27;) is the classification, identification and naming of organisms. It is usually richly informed by phylogenetics, but remains a methodologically and logically distinct discipline. The degree to which taxonomies depend on phylogenies (or classification depends on evolutionary development) differs depending on the school of taxonomy: phenetics ignores phylogeny altogether, trying to represent the similarity between organisms instead; cladistics (phylogenetic systematics) tries to reproduce phylogeny in its classification

== Ontophylogenesis ==

An extension of phylogenesis to the cellular level by Jean-Jacques Kupiec 

 is known as Ontophylogenesis

<doc id="352784" wikidata="Q10297096" url="?curid=352784" title="Minister of National Defense (China)">
<text>The minister of national defense of the People&#x27;s Republic of China is the head of the Ministry of National Defense and one of the top positions in the State Council. The minister usually is also a member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and a member of the Central Military Commission (CMC), the top governing body of China&#x27;s armed forces including the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA).

Unlike in other countries, the minister does not have command authority over the armed forces, with the post generally used for diplomatic purposes. Nevertheless, until the appointment of the current incumbent, Admiral Dong Jun, the post was always held by a member of the CMC. Dong has been serving in the position since December 2023.

== History ==
Historically, both the position and the ministry carried greater power. In the first decades of the PRC, the ministry included several more departments, all overseen by vice ministers. The minister was held by influential generals, including Peng Dehuai, Lin Biao and Ye Jianying.

The ministry was reformed into its current state in the 1982 constitutional revision. Between 1982 and 2008, the minister usually concurrently served as a vice chairman of the CMC, and was usually a member of the CCP Politburo. In addition, all ministers of National Defense would also be appointed as the state councillor, a position in the State Council newly established in 1982 consisting of high-ranking officeholders. And since all defense ministers are members of the CMC, in official state rhetoric, the ministers of National Defense is to be referred to as the &quot;State Councillor and Minister of National Defense&quot;. After 2008, holders of the position stopped serving concurrently as a CMC vice chair, further weakening the position.

Among all its officeholders, Geng Biao was the only defence minister with a civil background, having no military rank of the PLA, neither was he a member thereof. Nonetheless, Geng did serve in the Red Army long before PLA’s foundation. With the exception of the aforementioned officeholder, all defence ministers in prior to Wei Fenghe came from the PLA Ground Force. In addition, current officeholder is yet to be appointed as a state councillor, making it the only exception to the aforementioned co-serving norm.

=== Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu Scandals, 2023–2024 ===
Notably, under the tenure of the President and CMC Chairman Xi Jinping, a series of major military scandals occurred from 2023 to June 2024, which eventually saw two of his former defence ministers, Wei Fenghe and Li Shangfu, expelled from the CCP, with their military titles revoked. Prior to this, Li was removed from the office only a couple of months after his appointment in March 2023, causing the position to be briefly vacant from October. This was until Admiral Dong Jun was appointed into the office in December of the same year, making Dong the first PLA Navy officer to become the defence minister. Besides, the PLA Rocket Force, in which Wei was a member, also saw a purge that year, with corruption investigating taking place.

== Process of appointment ==
Officially, the minister is nominated by the premier of the State Council, who is then approved by the National People&#x27;s Congress or its Standing Committee and appointed by the president.

== Functions ==
The military is under the governance of the CMC, putting the Ministry of National Defense out of the chain of command, the minister is significantly less powerful than his counterparts from other countries, and has no direct command function over the military. The post is generally seen as a diplomatic and ceremonial role, with the minister handling military-to-military ties with other countries. However, until the appointment of the current incumbent, Admiral Dong Jun, the office has always been held by a member of the CMC. Though the minister has historically been assisted by vice ministers, the ministry currently has no vice ministers.

<text>A sapric is a subtype of a histosol where virtually all of the organic material has undergone sufficient decomposition to prevent the identification of plant parts and even fecal matter. Muck is a sapric soil that is naturally waterlogged or is artificially drained.

==Classification==
The soils are deep, dark colored, and friable, often underlain by marl, or marly clay.

===World Reference Base===
The World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) defines &quot;sapric&quot; (sa) as a histosol having less than one-sixth (by volume) of the organic material consisting of recognizable plant tissue within 100 cm of the soil surface.

===Canada===
Muck soils fall under the Organic Order in the Canadian system of soil classification. Muck soils are organic soils, with at minimum of 30% organic matter and a depth of at least 40 cm.

===United States===
In the USDA soil taxonomy, sapric may be a subtype of a haplohemist or glacistel type, and may also be a diagnostic organic soil material where the fiber content is less than one-sixth of the volume. Muck soils are defined by the USDA NRCS as sapric organic soils that are saturated more than 30 cumulative days in normal years or are artificially drained. An example would be a soil made up primarily of humus from drained swampland.

==Use and vegetation==
Muck soil is used for growing specialty crops such as onions, carrots, celery, and potatoes.

==Geography==
Muck farming on drained swamps is an important part of agriculture in New York, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Florida, where mostly vegetables are grown. The muckland of Torrey Farms of Elba, New York, which covers the counties of Orleans, Niagara, and Genesee, is thought to be the largest continuous section of muckland in the world. Another large tract of muckland, known as the Black Dirt Region, exists in the lower Hudson Valley. American &quot;muckers&quot; often have roots from the Netherlands or Eastern Europe, where their ancestors practiced a similar type of farming. Holland Marsh, north of Toronto, Ontario, is the site of the Muck Crops Research Station, a University of Guelph facility.

==Conservation==
Muck farming is controversial because the drainage of wetlands destroys wildlife habitats and results in a variety of environmental problems. It is unlikely that any more will be created in the United States because of environmental regulations. It is prone to problems. The soil is very light, so windbreaks are necessary to protect these fields in dry weather. It also can catch fire and burn underground for months. Oxidation also removes a portion of the soil each year, making it progressively shallower. Oxidation also discharges carbon dioxide. Some muck land has been reclaimed and restored as wetlands for wildlife preserves.

The impacts of drainage and agricultural production cause the loss of organic matter in muck soils through erosion, oxidation, and other processes collectively called &quot;subsidence.&quot; Agricultural practices such as cover cropping and reduced tillage can significantly reduce subsidence but can not reverse it. Muck soils are, in essence, a non-renewable agricultural resource.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;muck&quot; has much usage in the English language, referring in some cases to agricultural soil, and in others to dirt in general, and animal dung (sometimes human feces) in particular. Origins are probably from Norse, Danish, and Proto-Germanic roots referring to cow dung.

<text>Ji-Paraná is the second most populous municipality in the Brazilian state of Rondônia, with a population of 130,009, and the 16th most populous city of the Brazilian North Region, the 210th most populous city of Brazil, and the 113th of the Brazilian interior. It has an area of 6,897 km2. The city is divided by the Ji-Paraná River.

The city economy is industry and dairy production. The city was also the first of Rondônia State to invest in high technology of data transmission, when it connected, through a wireless network, the City Hall.

The municipality name comes from tupi, meaning &quot;great river of axes&quot;, through the junction of &quot;yî&quot; (axe) &quot;e paranã&quot; (sea, great river). It is a reference to the great amount of rocks in the river looking like indigenous axes. The municipality is also known as the Heart of Rondônia, due to the central city location and the existence of a heart shaped island, located in the confluence of the Machado and Urupá River.

Located in central Rondônia, the city attracted many settlers from the 1970s onward. As a result of corruption, lawlessness and a general lack of regulation, Ji-Paraná has been at the centre of Rondônia&#x27;s extreme deforestation, which today extends up to the border with Bolivia. The area between Ji-Paraná and Porto Velho, the regional capital 373 km away, is now largely deforested. The deforestation expands along smaller illegally built roads stemming from the BR-364 highway.

The city is served by José Coleto Airport.

The municipality contains part of the Jaru Biological Reserve, a fully protected conservation unit created in 1984.

Isaú Raimundo da Fonseca is the city&#x27;s current mayor, his term expires in 2024.

==Climate==
Ji-Paraná has tropical climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;), on summer the temperature reaches to 34°C.

<doc id="352793" wikidata="Q4135342" url="?curid=352793" title="Baptist General Convention of Texas">
<text>The Baptist General Convention of Texas (BGCT), more commonly known as the Texas Baptists, is a Baptist Christian denomination in the U.S. state of Texas. It is affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention and the Baptist World Alliance. Texas Baptist offices are located in the city of Dallas, though convention staff are located across the state. According to a denomination census released in 2023, it claimed 2,038,537 members and 5,375 churches 

==History==
There were Baptists among the first Anglo-American settlers of Texas, but under Spain (and later Mexico), non-Catholic religious worship was prohibited. The first Baptist sermon preached in Texas was preached by Joseph Bays of Missouri as early as 1820. The first Sunday School in Texas was organized by a Baptist, Thomas J. Pilgrim, at San Felipe de Austin in 1829. Mexican authorities forced the Sunday School to disband and hindered the attempts of the earliest Baptist preachers.

The first Baptist church in Texas was organized in Illinois by Elder Daniel Parker. Parker visited Texas in 1832, and concluded that the Mexican laws clearly prohibited organizing a church in Texas. He also decided the immigration of an organized church into the state would not violate the colonization laws. To this end, he and several others constituted a church in Illinois, then traveled to Texas by wagon train, arriving in Austin Colony by January 20, 1834. Parker held a strict predestinarian theology, as well as his controversial &quot;Two-Seed&quot; theology. Like those travelers, the church was named &quot;Pilgrim&quot;. This church, and those churches of like faith that followed, remained aloof from the majority of Baptists in Texas. Pilgrim Church is the oldest Baptist church in Texas, and survives today as a Primitive Baptist church near Elkhart, TX.

The first missionary Baptist church in Texas was organized at Washington-on-the-Brazos by Z. N. Morrell in 1837. The following year, Isaac Reed and R. G. Green formed the Union Baptist Church, about 5 miles north of Nacogdoches, Texas. This church, now known as the Old North Church, is the oldest surviving missionary Baptist church in Texas, and cooperates with the Baptist General Convention of Texas. After Texans achieved independence from Mexico, Baptists began to flourish in Texas. Many churches were formed in the days of the Republic of Texas. With the multiplication of churches came also the organization of associations. The first association was the Union Baptist Association, organized in 1840.

As the local associations increased, Missionary Baptists became interested in cooperation together on the broader state level. In 1848 representatives from four associations met at Anderson, Texas, and started the &quot;Baptist State Convention of Texas&quot;. In 1853, the &quot;Baptist General Association of Texas&quot; was organized at Larissa in Cherokee County in east Texas. Other bodies were formed to serve their regions (and often due to dissatisfaction with the other bodies), such as the &quot;East Texas Baptist Convention&quot; (org. 1877 at Overton) and the &quot;North Texas Baptist Missionary Convention&quot; (org. 1879 at Allen). B. H. Carroll, pastor of First Baptist in Waco, was instrumental in getting the General Association, during its 1883 meeting, to propose that five conventions in Texas consider the expediency of uniting as one body.

The North Texas Convention dissolved, and recommended its churches affiliate with the &quot;Baptist State Convention&quot;. The East Texas Convention also joined the state convention. In 1886, the &quot;Baptist General Association of Texas&quot; and the &quot;Baptist State Convention of Texas&quot; ratified the terms of merger and consolidated into one body called &quot;The Baptist General Convention of Texas&quot;. In addition to Carroll, other leaders in the merger included S. A. Hayden, J. B. Cranfill, J. B. Link, J. M. Carroll, R. T. Hanks, and G. W. Smith.

Following this short-lived unity, S. A. Hayden was involved in controversy; during the S. A. Hayden controversy of the early 20th century, the Baptist Missionary Association of Texas was founded and split with the Baptist General Convention of Texas. The second major division following the formation of the convention was the Premillennial Missionary Baptist Fellowship&#x27;s foundation by J. Frank Norris in 1933.

As the Baptist General Convention of Texas grew in spite of these initial divisions, and with its affiliation to the Southern Baptists, by the end of the 20th century, the Baptist General Convention of Texas was involved in a doctrinal struggle regarding the future of the Southern Baptist Convention. During the intense struggle for control of the Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s resources and ideological direction between moderates and conservatives, the state convention—being the largest by finances and organization—largely resisted the conservative and at-times fundamentalist course of the Southern Baptist Convention from the 1980s-1990s. Defending individual soul liberty and the autonomy of the local church, by 1998, a number of conservative churches split with the theologically moderate convention to form the Southern Baptists of Texas Convention.

Since this schism and the conservative takeover of the Southern Baptist Convention, the Baptist General Convention of Texas has mobilized affiliated churches at annual meetings to elect moderate or centrist candidates endorsed by the organization in the 1990s and early 2000s. In 1994, it was suggested that the convention completely severed ties with the Southern Baptists.

By 2000, the state convention voted to cut its contributions to Southern Baptist-operated seminaries, and stopped financially contributing to the SBC Christian Life Commission. In 2000, the convention also declined to affirm the Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s 2000 Baptist Faith and Message. Following, in 2001, the Baptist General Convention of Texas recommended shifting contributions away from the SBC&#x27;s North American Mission Board. The Baptist General Convention of Texas has funded and maintained their own home and foreign missions organizations.

Since then, the state body has continued to remain theologically moderate, operating and partnering their theologically moderate or centrist seminaries, colleges and universities, health and financial institutions, and church planting networks separate from the Southern Baptist Convention&#x27;s entities. The Baptist General Convention of Texas has also primarily affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance, while maintaining nominal affiliation with the Southern Baptist Convention.

In 2009, the convention began to go by the name &quot;Texas Baptists&quot; to better communicate who they are, after having their name change deferred in 2008.

In 2024, the North American Mission Board announced it would not fund new churches affiliated with the Texas Baptists unless they change their statement of faith. In June 2024, the executive director of the Texas Baptists wrote, &quot;There are those who would like Texas Baptists to adopt a strictly complementarian position like the SBC and the BFM 2000. There are also those who would like Texas Baptists to be officially egalitarian. Yet, we are committed to unity in diversity under the Scriptures and the Lordship of Christ.&quot; It was also noted that non-Texan churches sought affiliation with its GC2 movement. Prior to the executive director&#x27;s statement, the Texas Baptists affirmed a group-study concerning non-Texan churches desiring affiliation without competing against the Southern Baptist Convention or formal schism.

==Doctrine==
The Texas Baptists are theologically moderate, and the 1963 Baptist Faith and Message has been adopted as a standard statement of faith. Some affiliated churches use the 2000 Baptist Faith and Message, and other statements of faith; however, neither of the two are required for full inclusion with the Texas Baptists. Its GC2 movement&#x27;s statement of faith has also been approved for use. Overall the Texas Baptists believe in the Holy Trinity and the virgin birth; the Bible as the only document having authority over churches and the conscience of believers; and the priesthood of all believers and missions. The Texas Baptists affirm the local autonomy of Baptist churches, operating in democratic process in contrast to episcopal and presbyterian polity among other Christian denominations.

Affirming congregationalism, however, the Texas Baptists have collectively opposed the exclusion of women&#x27;s ordination by the Southern Baptist Convention. As of May 2023, approximately half of the state&#x27;s campus ministers are women, and they have been provided scholarships for ministry preparation in seminaries; the Texas Baptists have also endorsed female military chaplains, though few serve as lead pastors. In May 2023 according to the Texas Baptists executive director—Craig Christina—&quot;conformity over the role of women in the church is neither a test of fellowship nor a condition of cooperation.&quot;

Pertaining to marriage and sexuality, the Texas Baptists affirm any sexual relationship outside of marriage are considered &quot;out of harmonious cooperation with the Baptist General Convention of Texas.&quot; The Texas Baptists also denounce homosexuality, adultery, incest, and pornography. In 1998, however, it resolved &quot;churches should seek to minister to all persons&quot; and &quot;the love of God embraces all persons and instructs all Christians to share God&#x27;s love with others.&quot; Refusing to denounce same-sex relationships, churches have been expelled for not cooperating with the Texas Baptists. The relationship between the Texas Baptists and Baylor University was also subjected to review for LGBTQ inclusion, as some affiliated members wanted to exert greater control over affiliated institutions regarding LGBTQ policies; by February 27, 2023, the convention and university have decided to remain affiliated with one another.

<doc id="352795" wikidata="Q1199834" url="?curid=352795" title="Jaws 2">
<text>Jaws 2 is a 1978 American horror thriller film directed by Jeannot Szwarc and co-written by Carl Gottlieb. It is the sequel to Steven Spielberg&#x27;s &quot;Jaws&quot; (1975), and the second installment in the &quot;Jaws&quot; franchise. The film stars Roy Scheider as Police Chief Martin Brody, with Lorraine Gary and Murray Hamilton reprising their respective roles as Martin&#x27;s wife Ellen Brody and mayor Larry Vaughn. It also stars Joseph Mascolo, Jeffrey Kramer, Collin Wilcox, Ann Dusenberry, Mark Gruner, Susan French, Barry Coe, Donna Wilkes, Gary Springer, and Keith Gordon in his first feature film role. The plot concerns Chief Brody suspecting another great white shark is terrorizing the fictional seaside resort community of Amity Island, following a series of incidents and disappearances, and his suspicions are eventually proven true.

Like the production of the original film, the production of &quot;Jaws 2&quot; was troubled. The first director for the film, John D. Hancock, proved to be unsuitable for an action film and was replaced by Szwarc. Scheider, who only reprised his role to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc.

The film was released on June 16, 1978 to mixed reviews. While the performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton, the special effects, and John Williams&#x27; musical score were praised, it received criticism for essentially duplicating the formula of the first film. However, it is regarded in retrospect as the best of the three &quot;Jaws&quot; sequels. It was briefly the highest-grossing sequel in history until &quot;Rocky II&quot; was released in 1979. The film&#x27;s tagline, &quot;Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water...&quot; has become one of the most famous in film history and has been parodied and homaged several times. It was followed by &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; in 1983.

==Plot==

Four years after the killing of the great white shark, a new hotel opens on Amity Island, while another great white shark kills two scuba divers photographing the wreckage of the &quot;Orca&quot;. Their camera, which took pictures during the attack, is recovered. The shark then kills a water skier. The driver of the boat attempts self-defense by using a gas tank and flare gun, but the boat explodes, killing her and severely burning the shark&#x27;s face.

A killer whale carcass is found on the beach. Police Chief Martin Brody believes that a shark is responsible. He then finds floating debris from the destroyed speedboat and the boat driver&#x27;s burnt remains. He calls Matt Hooper for assistance, but he is in Antarctica on a research expedition. Brody prohibits his 17-year-old son Mike from boating out of concern for his safety.

The following day, Brody watches the beach from an observation tower and causes a panic after mistaking a school of bluefish for a shark and shooting at it. However, his fears are confirmed when photos from the diver&#x27;s camera are processed, and one shows the shark. When he presents it to the Amity Town Council, they refuse to believe it is a shark and vote Brody out as police chief.

Mike disobeys his father&#x27;s orders by going sailing with his friends, bringing his 10-year-old brother Sean, who catches him trying to sneak out, to keep him from tattling on him to their parents. Marge, another teen, takes Sean with her, and they head out on six boats, going past a team of divers led by instructor Tom Andrews. Moments after submerging, Andrews encounters the shark. Panicking, he rushes to the surface, causing a bends attack and an embolism. Soon after, the shark hits the boat of teenage couple Eddie Marchand and Tina Wilcox and mauls Eddie to death.

Brody and his wife Ellen witness Tom&#x27;s evacuation by ambulance and hear that the other divers suspect that something scared him. Deputy Jeff Hendricks, who has taken over as Brody&#x27;s replacement, tells them that Mike went sailing with his friends, so Brody and Ellen commandeer the police boat, aided by Hendricks, to rescue them. They come across Tina&#x27;s boat, and she confirms the shark&#x27;s presence. Brody hails a passing boat to take Hendricks, Ellen, and Tina to shore while he searches for the kids.
Meanwhile, the shark attacks the group&#x27;s boats, causing most of them to capsize or crash. Mike is knocked unconscious and falls in the water. The only pair whose boat is still seaworthy retrieve Mike and leave the others to take him ashore; Sean and the others remain adrift upon the wreckage. A Harbor Patrol helicopter that Brody contacted earlier arrives to tow them to Cable Junction, a small island nearby which houses an electrical relay station that supplies power to Amity. However, the shark surfaces and latches onto the chopper&#x27;s pontoons, capsizing it and drowning the pilot. The shark knocks Sean into the water, and Marge is eaten while saving him.

Brody finds Mike, who informs him of the situation before Brody sends him to safety. Brody finds the others at Cable Junction. The cheering and jumping that greet him attracts the shark, which attacks, causing Brody to maroon the police boat. Using an inflatable raft, he taps an underwater power cable with an oar to lure the shark toward him. The shark bites the cable and is electrocuted to death. Brody and the other survivors gather on Cable Junction to await rescue.

==Production==

===Development and writing===
Universal wanted a sequel to &quot;Jaws&quot; early into the success of the original film. Producers David Brown and Richard D. Zanuck realized that someone else would produce the film if they did not, and preferred to be in charge of the project themselves.

In October 1975, Steven Spielberg told the San Francisco Film Festival that &quot;making a sequel to anything is just a cheap carny trick&quot; and that he did not even respond to the producers when they asked him to direct &quot;Jaws 2&quot;. He claimed that the planned plot was to involve the sons of Quint and Brody hunting a new shark. Brown said that Spielberg did not want to direct the sequel because he felt that he had done the &quot;definitive shark movie&quot;. The director later added that his decision was influenced by the problems the &quot;Jaws&quot; production faced – &quot;I would have done the sequel if I hadn&#x27;t had such a horrible time at sea on the first film.&quot;

Despite Spielberg&#x27;s rejection, the studio went ahead with plans to make the sequel, leading to an arduous 18-month pre-production process. Howard Sackler, who had contributed to the first film&#x27;s script but chose not to be credited, was charged with writing the first draft. He originally proposed a prequel based on the sinking of the USS &quot;Indianapolis&quot;, the story relayed by Quint in the first film. Although Universal president Sidney Sheinberg thought Sackler&#x27;s treatment for the film was intriguing, he rejected the idea. On Sackler&#x27;s recommendation, theatre and film director John D. Hancock was chosen to helm the picture.

Hancock began filming in June 1977. However, after nearly a month of filming, Universal and MCA executives disliked the dark, subtle tone that the film was taking and wanted a more lighthearted and action-oriented story. Additionally, Hancock ran into trouble with Sheinberg, who suggested to Hancock and Tristan that his (Sheinberg&#x27;s) wife, actress Lorraine Gary (Ellen Brody), &quot;should go out on a boat and help to rescue the kids.&quot; When told of the idea, Zanuck replied, &quot;Over my dead body.&quot; The next draft of the film&#x27;s screenplay was turned in with Gary not going out to sea. Hancock says that this, and his later firing of another actress who turned out to be a Universal executive&#x27;s girlfriend, contributed to his own dismissal from the film.

Hancock began to feel the pressure of directing his first epic adventure film &quot;with only three film credits, and all small-scale dramas&quot;. The producers were unhappy with his material, and on a Saturday evening in June 1977, after a meeting with the producers and Universal executives, the director was fired. He and his wife left for Rome and production was shut down for a few weeks. The couple had been involved in the film for eighteen months. Hancock blamed his departure on the mechanical shark, telling a newspaper that it still could not swim or bite after a year and a half: &quot;You get a couple of shots, and [the shark] breaks.&quot; Echoing the first film&#x27;s production, Carl Gottlieb was enlisted to further revise the script, adding humor and reducing some of the violence. Gottlieb wrote on location at Fort Walton Beach, Florida. It cost the producers more money to hire Gottlieb to do the rewrite than it would have if they had hired him in the first place.

At this point, Spielberg considered returning to direct the sequel. Over the Bicentennial weekend in 1976, Spielberg had hammered out a screenplay based on Quint&#x27;s &quot;Indianapolis&quot; speech. Because of his contract for &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, however, Spielberg would not be able to work on the film for a further year and the producers could not wait for him to be free. Production designer Joe Alves (who would direct &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot;) and Verna Fields (who had been promoted to vice-president at Universal after her acclaimed editing on the first film) proposed that they co-direct it. The request was declined by the Directors Guild of America, partly because they would not allow a DGA member to be replaced by someone who was not one of its members, and partly because they, in the wake of events on the set of &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot;, had instituted a ban on any cast or crew members taking over as director during a film&#x27;s production. The reins were eventually handed to Jeannot Szwarc, best known for the film &quot;Bug&quot; and whom Alves knew from working on the TV series &quot;Night Gallery&quot;. Szwarc recommenced production by filming the complicated water skier scene, giving Gottlieb some time to complete the script. He reinstated the character of Deputy Hendricks, played by Jeffrey Kramer, who had been missing from the earlier script. Many of the teenagers were sacked, with the remaining roles developed.

Three new mechanical sharks were constructed for the film. The first was the &quot;platform shark&quot;, also referred to as the &quot;luxurious shark&quot;. Special mechanical effects supervisor Robert Mattey and Roy Arbogast used the same body mold used for the shark in the first film. The production had planned to refurbish and utilize the sharks from the original film, but it was discovered they had rusted and rotted away after having been stored behind sheds on the lower lot of Universal Studios in the intervening years. The only pieces that were salvageable were the bare frames, made from chromoly tubing. Mattey&#x27;s design was much more complicated and ambitious than the first film. The same (male) body was used, but a brand new head was made by sculptor Chris Mueller which made use of an all-new mouth mechanism, one which incorporated jowls to disguise the pinching of the cheeks that had proven to be a problem with the shark in the original film. The sharks for &quot;Jaws 2&quot; were known as &quot;Bruce Two&quot; (the sharks for the original film had been nicknamed &quot;Bruce&quot;, after Spielberg&#x27;s lawyer), but on set they were referred to as &quot;Fidel&quot; and &quot;Harold&quot;, the latter after David Brown&#x27;s Beverly Hills lawyer. The other shark props used were a fin and a full shark, both of which could be pulled by boats. &quot;Cable Junction&quot;, the island shown in the film&#x27;s climax, was actually a floating barge covered with fiber-glass rocks. This was created in order to enable the shark platform to be positioned to it as close as possible (a real island would have hindered this due to the upward slope of the seabed making the shark platform visible). Like the first film, footage of real sharks filmed by Australian divers Ron and Valerie Taylor was used for movement shots that could not be convincingly achieved using the mechanical sharks.

Although the first film was commended for leaving the shark to the imagination until two thirds of the way through, Szwarc felt that they should show it as much as possible because the dramatic &quot;first image of it coming out of the water&quot; in the first film could never be repeated. Szwarc believed that the reduction of the first film&#x27;s Hitchcockian suspense was inevitable because the audience already knew what the shark looked like from the first film. Reviewers have since commented that there was no way that they were ever going to duplicate the original&#x27;s effectiveness. The filmmakers gave the new shark a more menacing look by scarring it in the early boat explosion.

Like the previous film, filming on the ocean proved challenging. Scheider said that they were &quot;always contending with tides, surf and winds ... jellyfish, sharks, waterspouts and hurricane warnings.&quot; After spending hours anchoring the sailboats, the wind would change as they were ready to shoot, blowing the sails in the wrong direction. As in the first film, the saltwater&#x27;s corrosive effect damaged the metal parts in the mechanical sharks, and some other equipment.

Susan Ford, daughter of U.S. President Gerald Ford, was hired to shoot publicity photographs. Many of these photos appeared in Ray Loynd&#x27;s &quot;Jaws 2 Log&quot;, which documented the film&#x27;s production, similar to the &quot;Jaws Log&quot;, a best-selling book written by Carl Gottlieb covering production of the first film.

===Location===
Martha&#x27;s Vineyard was again used as the location for the town scenes and Emerald Coast was included on this film. Although some residents guarded their privacy, many islanders welcomed the money that the company was bringing. Shortly after the production arrived in June 1977, local newspaper the &quot;Grapevine&quot; wrote:

Many residents enjoyed being cast as extras. Some people, however, were less pleased by the film crew&#x27;s presence and refused to cooperate. Only one drugstore allowed its windows to be boarded up for the moody look that Hancock wanted. &quot;Universal Go Home&quot; T-shirts began appearing on the streets in mid-June 1977.
When Szwarc took over, the majority of the film was shot at Navarre Beach in Florida, because the weather was warm and the water was deep enough for the shark platform. The company was at this location from August 1 until December 22, 1977. The production &quot;was a boost to the local economy because local boaters, extras and stand-ins or doubles were hired. Universal brought in actors, directors, producers and their wives, camera and crew people who needed housing, food and clothing for the movie. Services were needed for laundry, dry-cleaning and recreation.&quot; Navarre&#x27;s Holiday Inn &quot;Holidome&quot; was used as the film&#x27;s headquarters, with the ground floor converted into production offices, and some of the Gulf-front suites remodeled for David Brown and Roy Scheider. Universal rented 100 of the hotel&#x27;s 200 rooms, spending $1 million. The Holiday Inn was destroyed in the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. Boats and parts for their maintenance were purchased from local businesses. One proprietor said that he sold &quot;Universal approximately $400,000 worth of boats and equipment&quot;.

On one occasion, the Cable Junction Island set, which was built on a barge, broke loose from its anchorage and had to be rescued. Szwarc was contacted one night and told that his island was drifting towards Cuba. Real hammerhead sharks circled the teen actors during the filming of one shot. Because the characters they were playing were meant to be in distress, the crew (filming from a distance) did not realize that the actors were genuinely calling for help.

The interior shots of the teen hang-out where they play pinball were filmed in the original location of the Hog&#x27;s Breath Saloon on Okaloosa Island. This restaurant later relocated to Destin, Florida as its original building was susceptible to hurricane damage. The production company had to seek dredge and fill permits from Florida&#x27;s Department of Environmental Regulation to sink the revised platform that controlled the shark on the sea bottom.

Principal photography ended three days before Christmas 1977, on the Choctawhatchee Bay, near Destin, Florida. The actors had to put ice cubes in their mouths to prevent their breath showing on camera. The final sequence to be filmed was the shark being electrocuted on the cable. In mid-January, the crew reconvened in Hollywood with some of the teenage actors for five weeks of post-production photography.

&quot;Jaws 2&quot; cost $30 million to produce, over three times more than the original. David Brown says that they did not budget the film &quot;because Universal would never have given a green light to a $30 million budget in those days.&quot; The Marine Division Head for Universal on location, Philip Kingry, says that &quot;It cost approximately $80,000 per day to make that movie.&quot; When Kingry asked Brown what his budget was, the producer responded, &quot;We&#x27;re not wasteful, but we&#x27;re spending the profit from &quot;Jaws&quot;, and it will take what it takes.&quot;

===Casting===
Roy Scheider reluctantly returned to reprise his role as Martin Brody. In 1977, he had quit the role of Michael Vronsky in &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; two weeks before the start of filming because of &quot;creative differences&quot;. Scheider was contracted to Universal at the time for a three-picture deal, but the studio offered to forgive his failure to fulfill his contractual obligation if he agreed to appear in &quot;Jaws 2&quot;. The actor heavily resisted the film, claiming that there was nothing new to create and that people would be watching the film to see the shark, not him. According to his biographer, Scheider was so desperate to be relieved from the role that he &quot;pleaded insanity and went crazy in The Beverly Hills Hotel&quot;. However, he was given an attractive financial package for appearing in &quot;Jaws 2&quot;; he quadrupled his base salary from the first film, and negotiated points (a percentage of the film&#x27;s net profits). &quot;The Star&quot; newspaper reported that Scheider received $500,000 for 12 weeks work, plus $35,000 for each additional week that the schedule ran over.

Despite his reluctance, Scheider pledged to do the best job that he could, wanting to make Brody believable. Scheider is quoted in Ray Loynd&#x27;s book &quot;The Jaws 2 Log&quot;, saying, &quot;When Conan Doyle wrote the first Sherlock Holmes and everyone screamed for more, I don’t think he felt like a professional hack. I see nothing wrong with bringing back a story that gives people a terrific time&quot;.

The atmosphere was tense on the set, and Scheider often argued with Szwarc. On one occasion, Scheider complained (in front of extras) that Szwarc was wasting time with technical issues and the extras while ignoring the principal actors. A meeting was called with the two, David Brown and Verna Fields, in which Scheider and Szwarc were encouraged to settle their differences. The discussion became heated and a physical fight broke out, which Brown and Fields broke up. The rift was also articulated in written correspondence. In a letter to Szwarc, Scheider wrote that &quot;working with Jeannot Szwarc is knowing he will never say he is sorry or ever admitting he overlooked something. Well, enough of that shit for me!&quot; He requested an apology from the director for not consulting him. Szwarc&#x27;s reply focused upon completing the film to the &quot;best possible&quot; standard:

Many extras were recruited from Gulf Breeze High School. The students were paid $3 per hour, well above the minimum wage at the time ($2.30/hr), and reveled in being able to miss classes. Casting director Shari Rhodes requested members of the Gulf Breeze band perform as the Amity High School Band, seen in an early scene in the film showing the opening of the Holiday Inn Amity Shores &quot;Amity Scholarship Fund Benefit&quot;. &quot;The GBHS band consisted of approximately 100 members, and band director John Henley chose 28 student musicians, including the band&#x27;s section known as Henley&#x27;s Honkers.&quot; Universal scheduled their involvement for mid-afternoons to prevent their missing too much time in school. Universal made a contribution of $3,500 to the school and the band for their part in the film. Several other GBHS students were hired as stand-ins or doubles for the teenage actors to appear in the water scenes and to maintain and sail the boats. Richard Dreyfuss, who played Matt Hooper in &quot;Jaws&quot;, said he chose not to return in &quot;Jaws 2&quot; because Spielberg was not directing.

==Music==

John Williams returned to score &quot;Jaws 2&quot; after winning an Academy Award for Best Original Score for his work on the first film. Williams says that it was assumed by everyone that &quot;the music would come back also and be part of the cast ... it would require new music, certainly, but the signature music of &quot;Jaws&quot; should be used as well&quot;. He compares this to &quot;the great tradition&quot; for repeating musical themes in Hollywood serials such as &quot;Roy Rogers&quot; and &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot;. In addition to the familiar themes, Szwarc says Williams also composed a &quot;youthful counterpoint to the shark that is always around when the kids are sailing or going out to sea. It was very inventive&quot;.

Szwarc said that the sequel&#x27;s music should be &quot;more complex because it was a more complex film&quot;. Williams says that this score is broader, allowing him to make more use of the orchestra, and use longer notes, and &quot;fill the space&quot; created by the director. Williams used a larger ensemble than for the first film, and &quot;the orchestral palette may have been broader or had longer notes&quot;. Delays in shooting meant that Williams was forced to start working on the score before the film was completed. Szwarc discussed the film with the composer, showing him edited sequences and storyboards. The director praises Williams in being able to work under such difficult conditions. Critic Mike Beek suggests these time constraints enabled Williams &quot;to create themes based on ideas and suggestions, rather than a locked down print.&quot;

Critics have praised Williams&#x27; score, comparing it favorably to the original. Williams &quot;uses a few basic elements of the original—the obligatory shark motif, for one—and takes the music off in some new and interesting directions.&quot; The score is &quot;more disturbing in places&quot; than the original, and &quot;Williams some new and hugely memorable out to sea adventure music.&quot; Because &quot;Jaws 2&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t a film that requires subtlety ... Williams pulls out all the stops to make it as exciting and hair raising as possible.&quot;

According to the liner notes on the soundtrack album, Williams&#x27; &quot;sense of the dramatic, coupled with his exquisite musical taste and knowledge of the orchestra definitely stamp this score as truly one of his best.&quot; It is &quot;brilliantly performed by a mini-symphony made up of the finest instrumentalists to be found anywhere.&quot; Mike Beek makes positive comments about the film, saying that &quot;the music certainly elevates it to a level it would otherwise never have achieved.&quot;

In 2015, Intrada Records issued a two-disc edition with Williams&#x27; complete score in chronological order on the first disc and the original 1978 soundtrack album on the second.
==Release==
===Theatrical===
&quot;Jaws 2&quot; had sneak previews at 31 theaters across the United States on June 2, 1978, including at Loew&#x27;s State II in New York City, before opening June 16.

===Home media===
In 1980, MCA Home Video (then known as MCA Videocassette Inc.) released &quot;Jaws 2&quot; on VHS, Betamax and Laserdisc, following its 1980 theatrical re-release. In the 1990s, MCA-Universal Home Video reissued it on VHS and Laserdisc. The film received a DVD release in 2001. Many reviewers praised it for the quantity of special features, with DVD Authority asserting that it had &quot;more than a lot of titles labeled as &#x27;special edition&#x27; discs&quot;. It includes a 45-minute documentary produced by Laurent Bouzereau, who is responsible for many of the documentaries about Universal&#x27;s films. Actor Keith Gordon reminisces in a short feature, and Szwarc explains the phonetic problem with its original French title, &quot;Les Dents de la mer 2&quot;, as it sounded like it ended with the expletive merde (&quot;mer deux&quot;). This was combated by using the suffix &quot;Part 2&quot;.

The disc also contains a variety of deleted scenes. These scenes show the animosity between Brody and his wife&#x27;s boss, Len Peterson (Joseph Mascolo), Brody explaining to Ellen that he is not about to take any chances letting Mike go sailing, saying that the &quot;smell of death&quot; is the same in Amity as it is in New York, and the selectmen voting to fire Brody; Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) is the only person to vote to save him. These scenes were cut because they were slowing the film&#x27;s pace. Also included is footage of the shark attacking the coast guard pilot underwater after his helicopter had capsized. The scene was cut because of the struggle with the ratings board to acquire a PG certificate. In the storyboard, it is shown that the helicopter pilot survived and saved Marge (Martha Swatek) from being eaten after she saves Sean, and saves himself as well.

Although the audio was presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 mono, a reviewer for &quot;Film Freak Central&quot; comments that &quot;Williams&#x27; score often sounds deceptively stereophonic&quot;. The BBC, though, suggest that the mix &quot;really demands the added bass that a 5.1 effort could have lent it&quot;.

Universal Studios released &quot;Jaws 2&quot; on Blu-ray in 2016 and on 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray in 2023. The Blu-ray contains most of the bonus materials from the 2001 DVD release, with the exception of the text based bonus features and the galleries.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Jaws 2&quot; was the most expensive film that Universal had produced up until that point, costing the studio $30 million.

It opened to a gross of $9,866,023 in 640 theaters across the United States and Canada, ranking first and giving it the highest grossing opening weekend of all time up to that point as well as the single-day record of $3.5 million despite opening on the same day as &quot;Grease&quot; which grossed $9 million the same weekend, which was greater than any film released prior to that weekend. It was the first time that there had been two day-and-date releases grossing such high amounts. The opening weekend led it to set a record weekly total of $16,654,000. It went on to earn $77,737,272 during its initial release, making it the #6 highest-grossing film in 1978. It eventually surpassed $100 million with reissues, ultimately earning $102,922,376, and $208,900,376 worldwide.

&quot;Jaws 2&quot; inspired much more merchandising and sponsors than the first film. Products included sets of trading cards from Topps and Baker&#x27;s bread, paper cups from Coca-Cola, beach towels, a souvenir program, shark tooth necklaces, coloring and activity books, and a model kit of Brody&#x27;s truck. A novelization was written by Hank Searls based on an earlier draft of the screenplay by Sackler and Tristan; this, as &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; would say, bears &quot;virtually no resemblance to the [screenplay] ultimately used.&quot; The first chapter of the novelization was printed in advance of the film&#x27;s release in 15 U.S. newspapers, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;New York Post&quot;, &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and a condensed version of the novelization was published in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;. Marvel Comics published a comic book adaptation of the film by writer Rick Marschall and artists Gene Colan and Tom Palmer in &quot;Marvel Super Special&quot; #6 (also based on the earlier script). Following the success of Carl Gottlieb&#x27;s making-of book about the first film, Ray Loynd wrote &quot;The Jaws 2 Log&quot;, giving an account of the film&#x27;s production.

===Critical response===
Throughout the years, the film has received mixed reviews, though it is widely regarded as the best of the three &quot;Jaws&quot; sequels. The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an approval rating of 56% based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 5.50/10. The site&#x27;s critics&#x27; consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Jaws 2&quot; never approaches the lingering thrills of its classic predecessor, but it&#x27;s reasonably entertaining for a sequel that has no reason to exist.&quot; With a weighted average, Metacritic gave the film a score of 51 out of 100 based on 12 reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Critic John Kenneth Muir comments that opinions towards &quot;Jaws 2&quot; depend upon which side of the series it is being compared. Against Spielberg&#x27;s original, &quot;it is an inferior sequel to a classic&quot;, but comparison with the subsequent films &quot;Jaws 3-D&quot; and &quot;&quot; shows Szwarc&#x27;s film to be &quot;a decent sequel, and one produced before the franchise hit troubled waters.&quot; &quot;Jaws 2&quot;, he says, is &quot;at the deep end of the pool, better than its two shallow follow ups, and there is enough of &quot;Jaws&quot;″ lingering greatness floating about to make it an entertaining and exciting two hours.&quot; DVD Authority says &quot;After this one, the other &quot;Jaws&quot; movies seemed to just not be as good.&quot; One review says: &quot;it&#x27;s obviously not a patch on Spielberg&#x27;s classic, but it&#x27;s about as good as could be hoped for, with some excellent sequences, almost worthy of the original, several genuine shocks, a different enough story and some pretty decent characters.&quot; The performances of Scheider, Gary and Hamilton have been particularly praised.

Among contemporary reviews, Roger Ebert described the film as &quot;pure trash&quot;. Gene Siskel gave it two-and-a-half stars out of four in his print review, writing that the film &quot;is worth watching only when its leading player is on camera&quot; and that when the teenage characters were not being attacked, &quot;Jaws 2&quot; offers teenage action even less inspired than &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot;&quot;. Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;Some of the action sequences have been well staged, but they&#x27;ve been dropped into the film so indiscriminately that &quot;Jaws 2&quot; never builds to a particular climax. It simply drones on and on, like a television movie. Someone also made a mistake in showing us so much of the mechanical shark so early in the film.&quot; Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated, &quot;Maybe because familiarity breeds indifference the more you see of the shark this time the more it seems to have wandered away from the Universal Studios Tour, manmade and mechanical.&quot; Tom Pulleine of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Less a sequel than a remake, &quot;Jaws 2&quot; is a tiresomely foregone conclusion to anyone who has seen Spielberg&#x27;s film ... Even worse, since the events of the first film are acknowledged in this one, the refusal of the mayor and council to act on Brody&#x27;s warning a second time round makes them appear idiotic to a degree that effectively sabotages any halfway serious dramatic interest.&quot;

George Morris for the &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; preferred &quot;Jaws 2&quot; over the original because it is &quot;less insidious in its methods of manipulation&quot; and &quot;because director Jeannot Szwarc streamlines the terror ... By crosscutting among the teenagers, Scheider, and the officials&#x27; efforts to rescue them, Szwarc works up enough suspense to keep the adrenaline going.&quot; However, Morris&#x27; review is not entirely complimentary. He would have preferred the shark to have been seen less, positing &quot;producers and audiences alike seem to have forgotten that the greatest suspense derives from the unseen and the unknown, and that the imagination is capable of conceiving far worse than the materialization of a mere mechanical monster.&quot; Similarly, John Simon felt that the &quot;shark&#x27;s waning is caused by a decline in direction: Jeannot Szwarc has none of Steven Spielberg&#x27;s manipulative cleverness. For one thing, he allows us close and disarming close-ups of the shark almost immediately ...&quot; A reviewer for the BBC complained that the additional screen time awarded to the shark makes it &quot;seems far less terrifying than its almost mystical contemporary&quot;. David Parkinson of &quot;Radio Times&quot; awarded it two stars out of five, calling it a &quot;pale imitation of the classic original&quot; and stating that &quot;the suspense comes unglued because the film floats in all-too-familiar waters. You just know how everyone is going to react — from the stars to the director, and even the mechanical shark.&quot;

Although many critics identify some flaws, often comparing Szwarc negatively to Spielberg, DVD.net states that &quot;this sequel does have some redeeming qualities going for it that make it a good movie in its own right&quot;. Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw are missed, especially since the teenage characters are labeled &quot;largely annoying &#x27;Afterschool Special&#x27; archetypes&quot; who are &quot;irritating and incessantly screaming&quot; and &quot;don&#x27;t make for very sympathetic victims&quot;. Because of its emphasis upon the teenage cast, some critics have compared the film to the popular slasher films that would soon follow. Also comparing the film&#x27;s &quot;interchangeable teens to slasher films, particularly the &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; franchise, Muir says that &quot;it feels wrong for a &quot;Jaws&quot; film to dwell in that shallow domain.&quot; However, the critic also commends the teen characters&#x27; comradeship and heroism, citing the girl (Marge) killed when saving Sean from the shark.

The film&#x27;s tagline, &quot;Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water ...&quot;, has become one of the most famous in film history. Andrew J. Kuehn, who developed the first film&#x27;s trailer, is credited with coining the phrase. It has been parodied in numerous films, notably the tagline of the 1996 feature film adaptation of the television series, &quot;Flipper&quot;: &quot;This summer, it&#x27;s finally safe to go back in the water.&quot;

<text>Porto Velho (, &quot;Old Port&quot;) is the capital of the Brazilian state of Rondônia, in the upper Amazon River basin. The population is 460,434 people (as of the IBGE 2022 estimation). Located on the border of Rondônia and the state of Amazonas, the town is an important trading center for cassiterite, the mining of which represents the most important economic activity in the region, as well as a transportation and communication center. It is on the eastern shore of the Madeira River, one of the main tributaries of the Amazon River. It is also Rondônia&#x27;s largest city, and the largest state capital of Brazil by area. Porto Velho is one of the most dangerous cities in the world, being the worst Brazilian capital city with sanitation and the worst to live in.

The municipality occupies most of the border between Amazonas and Rondônia, and is both the westernmost and northernmost city in the state.

== History ==

Officially founded on October 2, 1914, Porto Velho was founded by pioneers around 1907, during the construction of the Madeira-Mamoré railroad. After the railroad was completed, the local population was about one thousand inhabitants; its buildings were chiefly the railway&#x27;s installations and the wooden houses of the Caribbean (mainly Barbadian) workers - hence the name of the town&#x27;s largest district by then, &quot;Bajan Hill&quot; or &quot;Barbados Town&quot;, nowadays called the &quot;Alto do Bode&quot;.

During the first sixty years, the city&#x27;s development was directly connected to the railway&#x27;s activities. The town prospered during the rubber boom; after the discovery of cheap Malaysian rubber made that of the Amazon obsolete, the region&#x27;s rubber-centered economy ground to a sudden halt. Cities like Santo Antônio do Madeira, which had a tram line and a weekly newspaper by the time of Porto Velho&#x27;s foundation, are still nothing but ruins to this day.

Porto Velho&#x27;s survival is associated with the better conditions of the area where it was built, its easy access by the river and its harbor: these were all considerations in the choice of Porto Velho as the capital of the newly formed Federal Territory of Guaporé, in 1943. Only with the beginning of World War II was there another cycle of progress in the region. Once the Allied forces lost control of Malaysian rubber, the Amazon&#x27;s was needed again due to the war effort. This produced what is known in Brazil as the &quot;second rubber boom&quot;. Subsequently, when the war ended, the region&#x27;s economy once again came to a halt.

Porto Velho&#x27;s modern history begins with the discovery of cassiterite around the city, and of gold on the Madeira River, at the end of the 1950s. In addition, the government&#x27;s decision to allow large cattle farms in the territory began a trend of migration into the city. Almost one million people moved to Rondônia, and Porto Velho&#x27;s population increased to three hundred thousand. This intense migration caused much trouble for the city. Among many other problems, the suburban boroughs, for example, were nothing but shanty towns.

The Catedral Metropolitana Sagrado Coração de Jesus is the cathedral archiepiscopal see of a Latin Catholic jurisdiction that started on May 1, 1925. The vast Territorial Prelature of Porto Velho split off from the then-Diocese of Amazonas and Diocese of São Luíz de Cáceres, and also lost parts to three new Territorial prelatures, before being promoted as the first bishopric (Diocese of Porto Velho). On October 4, 1982, it was promoted as Metropolitan Archdiocese of Porto Velho.

== Geography ==

Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome, and tropical forests in the Americas are consistently more species-rich than wet forests in Africa and Asia. As the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the Americas, the Amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity.

More than one third of all species in the world live in the Amazon Rainforest.

<doc id="352803" wikidata="Q452628" url="?curid=352803" title="Amakusa Shirō">
<text>, also known as , was a Japanese Christian of the Edo period and leader of the Shimabara Rebellion, an uprising of Japanese Roman Catholics against the Shogunate. His Christian name was Geronimo and was later known as Francisco.

The uprising led by Shirō was defeated, and he was executed at the age of 17. His head was displayed on a pike near Nagasaki as a warning to Christians. His failures were reflected in the 1962 movie &quot;Amakusa Shirō Tokisada&quot; (shown in English-speaking countries as &quot;The Christian Revolt&quot; or &quot;The Revolutionary&quot;), by the Japanese movie director Nagisa Oshima.

== Early life ==
Shirō was born in 1621 as the son of Catholic parents, , a former Konishi clan retainer, and his wife. Urban legend speculates that Shirō could have been the illegitimate son of Toyotomi Hideyori, but these claims have little credibility.

Portuguese Jesuit missionaries had been active in Japan since the late 16th century. By the age of 15, the charismatic youth was known to his Japanese Catholic followers as &quot;Heaven&#x27;s messenger&quot;. Miraculous powers were attributed to him.

==Rebellion==
Shirō was among Japanese Catholics who took over Hara Castle in a rebellion against the Shogunate. They mounted a coordinated defense that held off attackers, but the rebel force had no logistical support, and their resolve was weakened. Shirō was said to display posters in the castle to raise morale and said: &quot;Now, those who accompany me in being besieged in this castle, will be my friends unto the next world.&quot;

One of the rebel soldiers, , betrayed Shirō. He got a message to the Shogunate that rebel food supplies were running low. The Shogunate forces made a final assault, taking Hara Castle in the process. The Shogunate forces massacred almost 40,000 rebels. Yamada was the only recorded survivor.

==Death==
Shirō was taken captive and executed after the castle was overtaken. His head was displayed on a pike in Nagasaki for an extended period of time as a warning to potential Christian rebels.

<doc id="352805" wikidata="Q2623003" url="?curid=352805" title="Kokoro">
<text>is a 1914 Japanese novel by Natsume Sōseki, and the final part of a trilogy starting with &quot;To the Spring Equinox and Beyond&quot; and followed by &quot;The Wayfarer&quot; (both 1912). Set in the Meiji era, the novel tells of the acquaintance between a young man and an older man called &quot;Sensei&quot; (&quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;master&quot;), who holds a secret from his past regarding the death of a friend.

&quot;Kokoro&quot; was first published in serial form in the newspaper &quot;Asahi Shimbun&quot;. Along with Osamu Dazai&#x27;s 1948 &quot;No Longer Human&quot;, &quot;Kokoro&quot; is one of the best-selling novels of all time in Japan.

==Background==
===Title===
The title translated literally means &quot;heart&quot;, but also translates as &quot;affection&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, &quot;resolve&quot;, &quot;courage&quot;, &quot;sentiment&quot;, or &quot;the heart of things&quot;. During the novel&#x27;s initial serial run, from 20 April to 11 August 1914, it was printed under the title . When later published in book form by Iwanami Shoten, its title was shortened to &quot;Kokoro&quot;; the rendering of the word &quot;kokoro&quot; itself was also changed from kanji () to hiragana ().

===Structure===
&quot;Kokoro&quot; consists of three parts. The first two are told from the perspective of the younger man, relating his memories of an older man who was a friend and mentor during his university days whom he addresses as &quot;Sensei&quot;. Part three, which makes up the second half of the novel, is a long confessional letter written by Sensei to the narrator. In this letter Sensei reveals, in keeping with an earlier promise, the full story of his past.

==Plot==
===Part I: &quot;Sensei and I&quot;===
The narrator has been left on his own in Kamakura after his friend, who invited him to vacation there, is called home by his family. One day, after finishing his usual swim in the sea, he takes notice of a man in the changing house who is being accompanied by a foreign guest, preparing to head for the water. He sees the same man each day thereafter, though no longer with his foreign companion. After some days, he finds an occasion to make the man&#x27;s acquaintance. As they grow closer, he comes to refer to the man as “Sensei.”

On parting in Kamakura, as Sensei prepares to return home to Tokyo, the narrator asks if he can call on Sensei at his home sometime. He receives an affirmative, though less enthusiastic than hoped for, response. Several weeks after his own return to Tokyo, he makes an initial visit, only to find Sensei away. On his next visit, when he again finds Sensei away, he learns from Sensei&#x27;s wife that Sensei makes monthly visits to the gravesite of a friend.

Over subsequent months and years, through periodic visits, the narrator comes to know Sensei and his wife quite well. At the same time, Sensei insists on maintaining a certain distance. He refuses to talk of his deceased friend and is reluctant to explain his own reclusion and lack of occupation. He also cautions the narrator that intimacy and admiration will only lead to disillusionment and disdain. However, he does promise that one day, when the time is right, he will divulge in full the story of his past.

===Part II: &quot;My Parents and I&quot;===
The narrator returns home to the country after graduation. His father, who had been in ill health, enjoys a respite from his illness. They set a date for a graduation celebration, only to have their plans put on hold by news of Emperor Meiji falling ill. As the weeks go by, the narrator&#x27;s father gradually loses his vigor and becomes bedridden. From his bed, he follows the papers as the Emperor declines and eventually dies.

After the Emperor&#x27;s passing, the narrator is pressured by his mother to secure employment to put his father at ease. At the same time, his father&#x27;s condition holds him close to home in the country. At his mother&#x27;s urging, he writes to Sensei to request assistance in finding a position in Tokyo. While not expecting any favorable response on the matter of employment, he does at least expect some reply and is disappointed when none arrives. Summer wears on, and the rest of the family is summoned home in anticipation of the father&#x27;s final hour. All are moved when news comes of the suicide (&quot;junshi&quot;) of General Maresuke Nogi, who takes his own life to follow his Emperor in death.

Shortly thereafter, a telegram from Sensei arrives, summoning the narrator to Tokyo. Unable to leave his father, the narrator refuses Sensei&#x27;s request, first by telegram and then by a letter detailing his situation. Some days later, a thick letter arrives by registered mail from Sensei. Stealing away from his father&#x27;s bedside, the narrator opens the letter to find it&#x27;s the previously promised accounting of Sensei&#x27;s past. Leafing through the pages, a line near the end catches his eye: &quot;By the time this letter reaches you, I&#x27;ll be gone from this world. I&#x27;ll have already passed away.&quot;

Rushing to the station, the narrator boards the first train for Tokyo. Once on board, he takes out Sensei&#x27;s letter and reads it through from the start.

===Part III: &quot;Sensei&#x27;s Testament&quot;===
The narrator reads Sensei&#x27;s letter on the train toward Tokyo. Sensei begins by explaining his reticence over the summer as he wrestled with the problem of his own continued existence. He then explains the motivation for his current actions. The remainder of the letter is an accounting of Sensei&#x27;s life.

Sensei grows up in the countryside and loses both of his parents to illness while still in his late teens. As an only child, he inherits the family&#x27;s considerable wealth, which his uncle steps in to help manage during the years over which, as previously planned, he pursues his education in Tokyo. Each summer Sensei returns to his home, where his uncle suggests that he should marry soon and establish himself in the community as the family heir, but Sensei, uninterested yet in marriage, declines. Eventually it comes to light that the uncle&#x27;s businesses are struggling, and much of Sensei&#x27;s wealth has been poured into losing ventures. Sensei salvages what remains, arranges for the sale of his house and possessions, visits his parents&#x27; gravesite one last time, and turns his back on his home town, severing all ties with his relations.

Back at his studies in Tokyo, Sensei decides to trade his boisterous student lodgings for calmer quarters. He hears of a widow looking to take in a boarder, and is accepted after a brief interview. The household is quiet, with just the widow, her daughter, and a maidservant. Sensei is smitten with the daughter at first sight, but at the same time the deceit of his uncle has left him generally distrustful. After some time, he thinks to ask the widow, who treats him as family, for her daughter&#x27;s hand, but still holds back for fear that the women are playing him just as his uncle had.

Sensei has a friend and classmate from the same hometown, whom he refers to simply as K. K is the son of a Buddhist priest, but was adopted by the family of a prominent local physician who funds his study of medicine in Tokyo. Contrary to their wishes, K pursues his own passions of religion and philosophy, and is disowned as a result. Sensei feels some obligation to assist his friend, who is struggling to maintain an aggressive course of study while at the same time supporting himself. With the widow&#x27;s approval, Sensei convinces K to join him as a second boarder, arguing that K&#x27;s presence there will serve toward his own spiritual betterment. After a while, K warms to his new surroundings and grows more sociable. Sensei is pleased with the improvement he&#x27;s worked in his friend&#x27;s demeanor but also begins to see K as a rival for the daughter&#x27;s affection. During a walking tour he and K set out together on the Boshu peninsula, Sensei is tormented by suspicions, wondering if K might not have his eye on the daughter and fearing that the daughter may in fact favor K. He longs to divulge to K his feelings for the daughter, but he lacks the courage to do so.

Autumn comes and classes begin again. Sensei returns home at times to find K and the daughter conversing amiably, and he worries they&#x27;re growing close. He thinks again to ask the widow for her daughter&#x27;s hand, but again holds back, this time for fear that K holds the daughter&#x27;s affection. K finally confesses his love for the daughter to Sensei. Sensei, shocked and dismayed, is unable to muster a response. In the days that follow, K confides in Sensei that he is torn between his long-held ideals and his newfound passion. Sensing K&#x27;s vulnerability, and at the same time seeking to serve his own interest, Sensei reminds K of his own words on discipline and servitude to a cause. K withdraws into reticence. Sensei fears that K is preparing to shift his life&#x27;s course out of love for the daughter. After confirming that K has not yet approached her, Sensei asks the widow for her daughter&#x27;s hand. She acquiesces, and the matter is easily settled. That same day, the widow talks to her daughter. Only K remains unaware of the arrangements until he learns of these from the widow. She scolds Sensei for leaving his friend in the dark. Sensei resolves to talk with K the next morning, but during the night, K takes his own life. K leaves behind a note, but absent is the rebuke that Sensei dreads. K&#x27;s feelings for the daughter, along with Sensei&#x27;s betrayal of his friend&#x27;s trust, will remain a secret. 

Sensei notifies K&#x27;s family and arranges K&#x27;s burial in the nearby Zōshigaya Cemetery with the family&#x27;s approval. Shortly after, Sensei and the ladies relocate to a new house. Sensei finishes his studies, and half a year later weds the daughter. Sensei makes monthly pilgrimages to K&#x27;s grave. His betrayal of K, and K&#x27;s death, continue to cast a shadow over his married life, yet he remains unable to burden his wife with his secret. Having lost faith in humanity in general, and now in his own self, Sensei withdraws from the world to lead an idle life. As the years pass and he reflects further on K, he comes to realize that K&#x27;s suicide was less about lost love and more about alienation and disappointment in oneself. Sensei feels himself drawn, more and more, to follow K&#x27;s path. With the ending of the Meiji era and the passing of General Nogi, Sensei decides that he&#x27;s outlived his time and must part from the world. His final request to the narrator is that his wife never know his story, and that it be held private until after she&#x27;s gone.

==Themes==
Although Sensei feels guilt for having caused his friend&#x27;s death, he comes to believe that K&#x27;s death was not a direct consequence of his unhappiness in love, but rather the same loneliness from which Sensei himself suffers. Translator Edwin McClellan writes, &quot;psychological guilt [is] less important than philosophical isolation&quot;. McClellan traces the theme of seeking relief from isolation through Natsume&#x27;s earlier works of &quot;The Gate&quot; and &quot;Kojin&quot; to its solution in Sensei&#x27;s suicide in &quot;Kokoro&quot;.

Even though guilt comes into play, taking responsibility for one&#x27;s actions and mistakes is paramount in the Confucian and Japanese ideology portrayed in the novel, and Sensei understands those traditions. Sensei clearly feels responsible for K&#x27;s suicide, displayed in his constant trips to the cemetery at Zoshigaya to visit K&#x27;s grave, his belief that he is being punished by heaven, or is destined for misery and loneliness, his belief that he must never be, or can never be, happy, because of this betrayal of K. Thus, as is often the case in Japanese culture (particularly in the Tokugawa period, but also certainly carried on beyond it), Sensei&#x27;s suicide is an apology and an attempt to show penitence, or to do something about one&#x27;s mistakes. He writes on several occasions that he has long known he must die, but has not the strength to kill himself just yet. He is constrained by weakness, and has not the strength to hold to either those traditional Japanese values, or the new modern Western ones that were fast replacing them throughout the Meiji era.

Jun Etō attributes the focus on isolation in Natsume&#x27;s work to a philosophical crisis which the author underwent while studying in London. His contact with the more individualistic ideas of the West shattered his faith in the Confucian scholar-administrator model of traditional Japan, but he retained enough of his traditional upbringing to preclude a wholehearted embrace of Western thinking; leaving him, &quot;a lonely, modern man&quot;. The fallen man of Natsume&#x27;s conception could only escape through madness or suicide, or live on and continue to suffer.

Takeo Doi provides a contrasting interpretation of the novel, in which the psychological dominates and which sees Sensei&#x27;s life as a descent into &quot;first&quot; madness, &quot;then&quot; suicide. Noting inconsistencies in Sensei&#x27;s account of his uncle&#x27;s fraud, he argues that Sensei&#x27;s perception of his uncle&#x27;s behaviour was a schizophrenic delusion created by changes in Sensei himself. He finds further confirmation of this assessment in Sensei&#x27;s belief that he is being first persecuted, then entrapped by the family he goes to live with, and in the voice which Sensei says talked to him in the years after K&#x27;s suicide. Sensei&#x27;s own end he interprets as a homoerotic act, &quot;loyally following his beloved into death&quot;. Translator Meredith McKinney elucidates the notion of a homosexual motive, saying &quot;Kokoro tells the story of three young men whose hearts are &#x27;restless with love&#x27; and of their emotional entanglements not only with the opposite sex but variously with one another. Homosexuality is not, needless to say, at issue, although a young man’s intellectually erotic attraction to an older man is beautifully evoked.&quot;

Although Sensei&#x27;s story is the climax of the novel, about half its length is devoted to the story of the narrator. Many commentators have noted the similarity between the narrator and the younger Sensei. The narrator is at an earlier stage in his own transition from a simplistic celebration of life in the opening pages to his own growing separation from mankind. The extent of the latter becomes apparent when he returns home to find that he is no longer in sympathy with his own family.

This second part of the novel, in which Sensei is physically absent, also serves as a contrast between the unthinking contentment of the narrator&#x27;s father and the thoughtful discontent of Sensei. McClellan compares the &quot;strength and dignity&quot; of K&#x27;s and Sensei&#x27;s suicides with the physical indignity of the father&#x27;s death, while still noting the tranquility the father manages to retain. Takeo Doi in his psychological readings sees the narrator&#x27;s preference for Sensei over his real father — culminating in the abandonment of his dying father for the already dead Sensei — as a case of &quot;father transference&quot;.

The reasons for Sensei&#x27;s eventual suicide are debated. Jun Etō ascribes to it a &quot;dual motivation&quot;: a personal desire to end his years of egoistic suffering, and a public desire to demonstrate his loyalty to the emperor. This position is supported by Sensei&#x27;s own statement (albeit in jest) that his suicide would be, &quot;through loyalty to the spirit of the Meiji era&quot;, while earlier in the book he had explicitly connected his isolation with the times he lived in: &quot;loneliness is the price we have to pay for being born in this modern age, so full of freedom, independence, and our own egotistical selves&quot;. Isamu Fukuchi, however, contests both these points. He argues that suicide to end his own suffering would make no sense after having already endured the suffering for many years, while a distinction is to be made between loyalty to Emperor Meiji and loyalty to the &quot;spirit&quot; of the Meiji era. He sees the latter as being the conflict between, &quot;modern ideals and traditional morality&quot;. Sensei&#x27;s suicide is therefore a recognition that the end of the Meiji era has rendered as anachronisms those who, like him, are torn between modernity and tradition.

<text>The Honolulu Zoo is a zoo in Queen Kapiʻolani Park in Honolulu, Hawaii. It is the only zoo in the United States to be established by grants made by a sovereign monarch and is built on part of the royal Queen Kapiʻolani Park. The Honolulu Zoo features over 1,230 animals in specially designed habitats.

Over 750,000 people visit the zoo annually. The zoo is administered by the City &amp; County of Honolulu through the Department of Enterprise Services. Its support agency, the Honolulu Zoo Society (HZS), provides program services for the zoo. The zoo&#x27;s accredited membership of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) was dropped in 2016 but reinstated in 2020.

==History==
===Queen Kapi‘olani Park===
In 1876, King Kalākaua made royal lands near the slopes of Lē‘ahi available for the establishment of a grand public park for the people of his kingdom. Two hundred subscribers to the king&#x27;s project formed the Kapiʻolani Park Association for the purpose of pursuing the mission. In 1877, the marshes, ponds and lagoons in the area were beautified, and it was opened as Queen Kapiʻolani Park in honor of Queen Kapiʻolani, wife of Kalākaua.

Even as a public park, King Kalākaua continued using the park as a place for his personal collection of exotic birds and horses. The park brought more exotic animals as it staged the Kamehameha Day celebrations and various carnivals and fairs. In 1896, the City &amp; County of Honolulu assumed control of Queen Kapiʻolani Park.

===Honolulu Zoo===

In 1915, the City &amp; County of Honolulu appointed Ben Hollinger to be its Administrator of Parks and Recreation, and Queen Kapiʻolani Park came under his control. Hollinger maintained a fascination with animals and began collecting them to showcase at the park in Waikīkī. The park became home for a monkey, a sun bear and several lion cubs. In 1916, a steamship on its way from Australia to Canada pulled into port at Honolulu Harbor. On board was an African elephant named Daisy. Hollinger pleaded with the City &amp; County of Honolulu to purchase the elephant, which they did. With the acquisition of the elephant, from live animal trader Ellis S. Joseph, Honolulu officially had a zoo. Daisy entertained visitors at the park until 1933, when Daisy was killed by Honolulu Police Department officers after she trampled her trainer, George Conradt, to death.

During the Great Depression, the Honolulu Zoo was almost shut down for lack of finances. Even through the difficulty, it expanded its collection on November 29, 1949, with the purchase of an elephant, a Bactrian camel, sea lions, several bird species, spider monkeys and a tortoise. The Honolulu Zoo continued to operate in disrepair.

In 1974, the Honolulu Zoo accepted a donation of a camel, an elephant, chimpanzees and deer. These donations renewed Honolulu&#x27;s enthusiasm to revive their zoo. The City &amp; County of Honolulu approved a master plan that determined the boundaries of the present site at the north end of Queen Kapiʻolani Park. The animal collection, increased by purchase, trade and donations, was housed in newly constructed facilities, some of which still provide foundations for newer exhibits. The facility designs were influenced by the exhibits of the San Diego Zoo in California.

The Honolulu Zoo experienced another revival of enthusiasm in the 1990s as the exhibits were redesigned to feature more natural settings for the animals on display.

==Art==
Art throughout the Honolulu Zoo includes: 
* &quot;Giraffe&quot;, a 1959 metal sculpture by Charles W. Watson 
* &quot;Ostrich&quot;, a 1960 metal sculpture by Charles W. Watson no longer exists.
* &quot;Hawaiian Porpoises&quot;, a 1976 metal, fiberglass, and coral sculpture by Ken Shutt
* &quot;Hippopotami&quot;, a 1976 chicken wire, cloth, and Belzona resin sculpture by Jack Throp
* &quot;Elephant&#x27;s Child&quot;, a 1988 bronze sculpture by Tom Tischler
* &quot;Gecko&#x27;s Delight&quot;, a 1978 wood relief sculpture by John Nippolt
* &quot;Hawaiian Pigs&quot;, a 1976 stone sculpture by Gregory Clurman
* &quot;Giraffe&quot;, a 1998 fiberglass sculpture by Jim de la Torre
* &quot;Whooping Cranes&quot;, a pair of 1998 metal sculptures by Paul Saviskas
* &quot;Maasai Tribesman&quot;, a 1999 metal sculpture by Paul Saviskas
* &quot;The Evolution of an Island&quot;, a 1991 metal mural by Amanda Opsahl

==Conservation==
The zoo has worked on conserving native Hawaiian species while also working with other organizations focused on conservation. Conservation has included the Kamehameha butterfly, crocodile monitor lizards, birds-of-paradise, African wild dogs, sloths, and the nene, which is the state bird of Hawaii. When only one Amastra cylindrica snail was found in the wild in 2015, the zoo worked on bringing the numbers of the snail up with over 140 snails reintroduced into the wild.

<doc id="352814" wikidata="Q2292514" url="?curid=352814" title="Ski school">
<text>A ski school is an establishment that teaches skiing, typically in a ski resort. The modern version of the ski school was invented by the Austrian ski pioneer Hannes Schneider in the early 1920s when he formalized instruction methods and established these methods as teaching principles for all ski instructors at his school.

==Overview==
In alpine skiing in North America, many resorts have their own ski school. In Europe, a resort may have many different private ski schools. Instructors are usually trained and certified by their national organizations, such as the Canadian Ski Instructors&#x27; Alliance in Canada and the Professional Ski Instructors of America in the US, both of which may certify their instructors with an international level overseen by the International Ski Instructors&#x27; Alliance. In some cases, especially in Canada, some provincial organizations, such as OT3 in Ontario and PESQ in Quebec, may certify ski instructors.

Lessons can be in a group or private. While instruction usually takes place on the slopes, some skiers are also trained with the help of ski simulators.

More recently, virtual platforms such as Vimbu have emerged to provide a way for skiers to book lessons with certified ski instructors directly, without needing to go through a ski school.

<doc id="352816" wikidata="Q997846" url="?curid=352816" title="Book of Armagh">
<text>The Book of Armagh or Codex Ardmachanus (ar or 61) (), also known as the &quot;Canon of Patrick&quot; and the &quot;Liber Ar(d)machanus&quot;, is a 9th-century Irish illuminated manuscript written mainly in Latin. It is held by the Library of Trinity College Dublin (MS 52). The document is valuable for containing early texts relating to St Patrick, the 7th century Irish bishop Tírechán, the Irish monk Muirchú. The book contains some of the oldest surviving specimens of Old Irish and for being one of the earliest manuscripts produced by an insular church to contain a near complete copy of the New Testament.

==History==
The manuscript was once reputed to have belonged to St. Patrick and, at least in part, to be a product of his hand. Research has determined, however, that the earliest part of the manuscript was the work of a scribe named Ferdomnach of Armagh (died 845 or 846). Ferdomnach wrote the first part of the book in 807 or 808, for Patrick&#x27;s heir (&quot;comarba&quot;) Torbach, abbot of Armagh. Two other scribes are known to have assisted him.

The people of medieval Ireland placed a great value on this manuscript. Along with the Bachal Isu, or Staff of Jesus, it was one of the two symbols of the office for the Archbishop of Armagh. The custodianship of the book was an important office that eventually became hereditary in the MacMoyre family. It remained in the hands of the MacMoyre family in the townland of Ballymoyer near Whitecross, County Armagh until the late 17th century. Its last hereditary keeper was Florence MacMoyer. By 1707 it was in the possession of the Brownlow family of Lurgan. It remained in the Brownlow family until 1853 when it was sold to the Irish antiquary, Dr William Reeves. In 1853, Reeves sold the Book to John George de la Poer Beresford, Archbishop of Armagh, who presented it to Trinity College, Dublin, where it can be read online from the Digital Collections portal of the Trinity College library.

==Manuscript==
The book measures . The book originally consisted of 222 folios of vellum, of which 5 are missing. The text is written in two columns in a fine pointed insular minuscule. The manuscript contains four miniatures, one each of the four Evangelists&#x27; symbols. Some of the letters have been colored red, yellow, green, or black. The manuscript is associated with a tooled-leather satchel, believed to date from the fifteenth century.

It contains text of Vulgate, but there are many &quot;Vetus Latina&quot; readings in the Acts and Pauline epistles.

==Illumination==
The manuscript has three full-page drawings, and a number of decorated initials in typical Insular style. Folio 32v shows the four Evangelists&#x27; symbols in compartments in ink, the eagle of John resembling that of the Book of Dimma. Elsewhere yellow, red, blue and green are used.

== Dating==
The dating of the manuscript goes back to Rev. Charles Graves, who deciphered in 1846 from partially erased colophons the name of the scribe Ferdomnach and the bishop Torbach who ordered the Book. According to the Annals of the Four Masters Torbach died in 808 and Ferdomnach in 847. As Torbach became bishop in 807 and died in 808 the manuscript must have been written around this time. Unfortunately to make the writing better visible Graves used a chemical solution and this had the effect that the writing related to the scribe and bishop is not readable any more.

==Contents==
The manuscript can be divided into three parts:

===Texts relating to St Patrick===
The first part contains important early texts relating to St. Patrick. These include two &quot;Lives&quot; of St. Patrick, one by Muirchu Maccu Machteni and one by Tírechán. Both texts were originally written in the 7th century. The manuscript also includes other miscellaneous works about St. Patrick, including the &quot;Liber Angueli&quot; (or the &quot;Book of the Angel&quot;), in which St. Patrick is given the primatial rights and prerogatives of Armagh by an angel. Some of these texts are in Old Irish and are the earliest surviving continuous prose narratives in that language. The only old Irish texts of greater age are fragmentary glosses found in manuscripts on the continent.

*Muirchu, &quot;Vita sancti Patricii&quot;
*Tírechán, &quot;Collectanea&quot;
*&quot;notulae&quot; in Latin and Irish on St. Patrick&#x27;s acts, and &quot;additamenta&quot;, charter-like documents later inserted into the manuscript
*&quot;Liber Angeli&quot; (&#x27;The Book of the Angel&#x27;) (640 x 670), written in Ferdomnach&#x27;s hand
*St. Patrick, &quot;Confessio&quot; in abbreviated form

===New Testament material===
The manuscript also includes significant portions of the New Testament, based on the &quot;Vulgate&quot;, but with variations characteristic of insular texts. In addition, prefatory matter including prefaces to Paul&#x27;s Epistles (most of which are by Pelagius), the &quot;Canon Tables&quot; of Eusebius, and the Letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus are included.

===&quot;Life&quot; of St Martin===
The manuscript closes with the &quot;Life of St. Martin of Tours&quot; by Sulpicius Severus.

<text>Margaret Forster (25 May 1938 – 8 February 2016) was an English novelist, biographer, memoirist, historian and critic, best known for the 1965 novel &quot;Georgy Girl&quot;, made into a successful film of the same name, which inspired a hit song by The Seekers. Other successes were a 2003 novel, &quot;Diary of an Ordinary Woman&quot;, biographies of Daphne du Maurier and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and her memoirs &quot;Hidden Lives&quot; and &quot;Precious Lives&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Forster was born in the Raffles council estate in Carlisle, England. Her father, Arthur Forster, was a mechanic or factory fitter, her mother, Lilian (née Hind), a housewife who had worked as a clerk or secretary before her marriage.

Forster attended Carlisle and County High School for Girls (1949–1956), a grammar school. She went on to win an open scholarship to study history at Somerville College, Oxford, graduating in 1960. Her first job was two years (1961–1963) of teaching English at Barnsbury Girls&#x27; School in Islington, north London. During that time she started to write, but her first draft novel was rejected.

==Writing==
===Novels===
Forster&#x27;s first published novel &quot;Dames&#x27; Delight&quot;, loosely based on her experiences at Oxford, launched her writing career in 1964. Her second, published the following year, was a bestseller: &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; describes the choices open to a young working-class woman in London in the Swinging Sixties. It was adapted as a successful 1966 film starring Lynn Redgrave as Georgy, with Charlotte Rampling, Alan Bates and James Mason, for which Forster co-wrote the screenplay with Peter Nichols. The book was also adapted as a short-lived Broadway musical, &quot;Georgy&quot;, in 1970.

Forster wrote prolifically in the 1960s and 1970s while bringing up three children, but later criticised many of her own early novels as &quot;skittery&quot;, feeling she had not found a voice until her 1974 novel &quot;The Seduction of Mrs Pendlebury&quot;. Those early novels are mainly light and humorous, driven by a strong plot. An exception was &quot;The Travels of Maudie Tipstaff&quot; (1967), which presents the difference in values between generations in a Glaswegian family.

The theme of family relations became prominent in her later works. &quot;Mother, Can You Hear Me?&quot; (1979) and &quot;Private Papers&quot; (1986) are darker in tone. She tackled subjects such as single mothers and young offenders. &quot;Have the Men Had Enough?&quot; (1989) scours care of the elderly and the problem of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, inspired by her mother-in-law&#x27;s decline and death from the disease. In 1991, she and her husband, Hunter Davies, contributed to a BBC2 &quot;First Sight&quot; episode &quot;When Love Isn&#x27;t Enough&quot;, telling Marion Davies&#x27;s story; Forster sharply criticised government policies on care for the elderly.

The publisher Carmen Callil sees as Forster&#x27;s best work &quot;Lady&#x27;s Maid&quot; (1990), a historical novel about Elizabeth Barrett Browning viewed through the eyes of her maid. &quot;Diary of an Ordinary Woman&quot; (2003), narrated as the diary of a fictional woman who lives through the major events of the 20th century, is so realistic that many readers believed it was an authentic diary. Other later novels include &quot;The Memory Box&quot; (1999) and &quot;Is There Anything You Want?&quot; (2005). Her final novel, &quot;How to Measure a Cow&quot;, was published in March 2016.

Forster published over 25 novels. A lifelong feminist and socialist, most of her works address these themes. Callil ascribes to Forster a world view &quot;shaped by her sense of her working-class origins: most of her stories were about women&#x27;s lives.&quot; Author Valerie Grove places her novels as being about &quot;women&#x27;s lives and the deceit within families&quot;.

===Biographies, memoirs and other non-fiction===
Forster&#x27;s non-fiction included 14 biographies, historical works and memoirs. Her best-known biographies are those of the novelist Daphne du Maurier (1993) and the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning (1988). The former was a groundbreaking exploration of the author&#x27;s sexuality and her association with Gertrude Lawrence, filmed by the BBC as &quot;Daphne&quot; in 2007. In her biography of Barrett Browning, Forster draws on recently found letters and papers that shed light on the poet&#x27;s life before she met and eloped with Robert Browning, replacing the myth of an invalid poet guarded by an ogre-like father with a more nuanced picture of an active, difficult woman, complicit in her virtual imprisonment.

Forster also wrote fictionalised biographies of the novelist William Makepeace Thackeray (1978) and the artist Gwen John (2006). &quot;Significant Sisters&quot; (1984) chronicled the growing feminist movement through the lives of eight pioneering British and American women: Caroline Norton, Elizabeth Blackwell, Florence Nightingale, Emily Davies, Josephine Butler, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Margaret Sanger and Emma Goldman. &quot;Good Wives&quot; (2001) surveyed contemporary and historical women married to famous men, including Mary Livingstone, Fanny Stevenson, Jennie Lee and herself. Her other historical writings include &quot;Rich Desserts and Captain&#x27;s Thin&quot; (1997), an account of the Carr&#x27;s biscuit factory in Carlisle.

Forster&#x27;s two memoirs based on her family background, &quot;Hidden Lives: A Family Memoir&quot; (1995) and &quot;Precious Lives&quot; (1998) join an autobiographical &quot;My Life in Houses&quot; (2014). &quot;Hidden Lives&quot;, drawing on the life of her grandmother, a servant with a secret illegitimate daughter, was praised by the historian and critic Claire Tomalin as &quot;a slice of history to be recalled whenever people lament the lovely world we have lost.&quot; Frances Osborne cites it as her own inspiration for becoming a biographer: &quot;It opened my eyes to how riveting the history of real girl-next-door women could be.&quot; The sequel, &quot;Precious Lives&quot;, tackled Forster&#x27;s father, whom she reportedly disliked.

==Broadcasting, journalism and other roles==
Forster joined the BBC Advisory Committee on the Social Effects of Television (1975–1977) and the Arts Council Literary Panel (1978–1981). She served as a Booker Prize judge in 1980. She was the main non-fiction reviewer for the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; (1977–1980). She contributed often to literature programmes on television and BBC Radio 4, and to newspapers and magazines. She was interviewed by Sue Lawley for Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in 1994.

==Awards==
Forster was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1975. She gained several awards for non-fiction. &quot;Elizabeth Barrett Browning: A Biography&quot; won the Heinemann Award of the Royal Society of Literature (1988), &quot;Daphne du Maurier&quot; the Writers&#x27; Guild Award for Best Non-Fiction (1993) and the Fawcett Society Book Prize (1994). &quot;Rich Desserts and Captain&#x27;s Thin: A Family and Their Times 1831–1931&quot; won the Lex Prize of The Global Business Book Award (1998). &quot;Precious Lives&quot; won the J. R. Ackerley Prize for Autobiography (1999).

==Personal life==
Forster met the writer, journalist and broadcaster Hunter Davies in their native Carlisle as a teenager. They married in 1960, immediately after she had completed her finals. The marriage lasted until Forster&#x27;s death.

They moved to London, where Davies had a job, at first living in rented accommodation in Hampstead, then buying and renovating a Victorian house in Boscastle Road, Dartmouth Park, north London, which remained their main home.

After the success of &quot;Georgy Girl&quot; in the mid-1960s, Forster bought a house for her mother. The couple had three children, a son and two daughters; Caitlin Davies is an author and journalist. The family lived for some time in the Algarve in Portugal, before returning to London. They also had homes in Caldbeck and Loweswater in the Lake District.

She led a somewhat reclusive life, often refusing to attend book signings and other publicity events. Her friends included broadcaster Melvyn Bragg and playwright Dennis Potter. Forster contracted breast cancer in the 1970s and had two mastectomies. A further cancer diagnosis ensued in 2007. By 2014, the cancer had metastasized, and she died in February 2016, aged 77.

==Legacy==
The British Library acquired the Margaret Forster Archive in March 2018, which consists of material relating to her works, professional and private correspondence, and personal papers. It includes manuscripts and typescript drafts of most of her published work, and some personal diaries.

<text>In computer architecture, a delay slot is an instruction slot being executed without the effects of a preceding instruction. The most common form is a single arbitrary instruction located immediately after a branch instruction on a RISC or DSP architecture; this instruction will execute even if the preceding branch is taken. This makes the instruction execute out-of-order compared to its location in the original assembler language code.

Modern processor designs generally do not use delay slots, and instead perform ever more complex forms of branch prediction. In these systems, the CPU immediately moves on to what it believes will be the correct side of the branch and thereby eliminates the need for the code to specify some unrelated instruction, which may not always be obvious at compile-time. If the assumption is wrong, and the other side of the branch has to be called, this can introduce a lengthy delay. This occurs rarely enough that the speed up of avoiding the delay slot is easily made up by the smaller number of wrong decisions.

==Pipelining==
A central processing unit generally performs instructions from the machine code using a four-step process; the instruction is first read from memory, then decoded to understand what needs to be performed, those actions are then executed, and finally, any results are written back to memory. In early designs, each of these stages was performed in series, so that instructions took some multiple of the machine&#x27;s clock cycle to complete. For instance, in the Zilog Z80, the minimum number of clocks needed to complete an instruction was four, but could be as many as 23 clocks for some (rare) instructions.

At any given stage of the instruction&#x27;s processing, only one part of the chip is involved. For instance, during the execution stage, typically only the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) is active, while other units, like those that interact with main memory or decode the instruction, are idle. One way to improve the overall performance of a computer is through the use of an instruction pipeline. This adds some additional circuitry to hold the intermediate states of the instruction as it flows through the units. While this does not improve the cycle timing of any single instruction, the idea is to allow a second instruction to use the other CPU sub-units when the previous instruction has moved on.

For instance, while one instruction is using the ALU, the next instruction from the program can be in the decoder, and a third can be fetched from memory. In this assembly line type arrangement, the total number of instructions processed at any time can be improved by up to the number of pipeline stages. In the Z80, for example, a four-stage pipeline could improve overall throughput by four times. However, due to the complexity of the instruction timing, this would not be easy to implement. The much simpler instruction set architecture (ISA) of the MOS 6502 allowed a two-stage pipeline to be included, which gave it performance that was about double that of the Z80 at any given clock speed.

==Branching problems==
A major issue with the implementation of pipelines in early systems was that instructions had widely varying cycle counts. For instance, the instruction to add two values would often be offered in multiple versions, or &quot;opcodes&quot;, which varied on where they read in the data. One version of might take the value found in one processor register and add it to the value in another, another version might add the value found in memory to a register, while another might add the value in one memory location to another memory location. Each of these instructions takes a different amount of bytes to represent it in memory, meaning they take different amounts of time to fetch, may require multiple trips through the memory interface to gather values, etc. This greatly complicates the pipeline logic. One of the goals of the RISC chip design concept was to remove these variants so that the pipeline logic was simplified, which leads to the classic RISC pipeline which completes one instruction every cycle.

However, there is one problem that comes up in pipeline systems that can slow the performance down. This occurs when the next instruction may change depending on the results of the last. In most systems, this happens when a branch occurs. For instance, consider the following pseudo-code:

 top:
 read a number from memory and store it in a register
 read another number and store it in a different register
 add the two numbers into a third register
 write the result to memory
 read a number from memory and store it in another register

In this case, the program is linear and can be easily pipelined. As soon as the first instruction has been read and is being decoded, the second instruction can be read from memory. When the first moves to execute, the is being read from memory while the second is decoding, and so forth. Although it still takes the same number of cycles to complete the first , by the time it is complete the value from the second is ready and the CPU can immediately add them. In a non-pipelined processor the first four instructions will take 16 cycles to complete, in a pipelined one, it takes only five.

Now consider what occurs when a branch is added:

 top:
 read a number from memory and store it in a register
 read another number and store it in a different register
 add the two numbers into a third register
 if the result in the 3rd register is greater than 1000, then go back to top:
 (if it is not) write the result to memory
 read a number from memory and store it in another register

In this example the outcome of the comparison on line four will cause the &quot;next instruction&quot; to change; sometimes it will be the following to memory, and sometimes it will be the from memory at the top. The processor&#x27;s pipeline will normally have already read the next instruction, the , by the time the ALU has calculated which path it will take. This is known as a branch hazard. If it has to return to the top, the instruction has to be discarded and the instruction read from memory instead. That takes one full instruction cycle, at a minimum, and results in the pipeline being empty for at least one instruction&#x27;s time. This is known as a &quot;pipeline stall&quot; or &quot;bubble&quot;, and, depending on the number of branches in the code, can have a noticeable impact on overall performance.

==Branch delay slots==
One strategy for dealing with this problem is to use a delay slot, which refers to the instruction slot after any instruction that needs more time to complete. In the examples above, the instruction that requires more time is the branch, which is by far the most common type of delay slot, and these are more commonly referred to as a branch delay slot.

In early implementations, the instruction following the branch would be filled with a no-operation, or , simply to fill out the pipeline to ensure the timing was right such that by the time the had been loaded from memory the branch was complete and the program counter could be updated with the correct value. This simple solution wastes the processing time available. More advanced solutions would instead try to identify another instruction, typically nearby in the code, to place in the delay slot so that useful work would be accomplished.

In the examples above, the instruction at the end is completely independent, it does not rely on any other information and can be performed at any time. This makes it suitable for placement in the branch delay slot. Normally this would be handled automatically by the assembler program or compiler, which would re-order the instructions:

 read a number from memory and store it in a register
 read another number and store it in a different register
 add the two numbers into a third register
 if the result in the 3rd register is greater than 1000, then go back to the top
 read a number from memory and store it in another register
 (if it is not) write the result to memory

Now when the branch is executing, it goes ahead and performs the next instruction. By the time that instruction is read into the processor and starts to decode, the result of the comparison is ready and the processor can now decide which instruction to read next, the at the top or the at the bottom. This prevents any wasted time and keeps the pipeline full at all times.

Finding an instruction to fill the slot can be difficult. The compilers generally have a limited &quot;window&quot; to examine and may not find a suitable instruction in that range of code. Moreover, the instruction cannot rely on any of the data within the branch; if an instruction takes a previous calculation as one of its inputs, that input cannot be part of the code in a branch that might be taken. Deciding if this is true can be very complex in the presence of register renaming, in which the processor may place data in registers other than what the code specifies without the compiler being aware of this.

Another side effect is that special handling is needed when managing breakpoints on instructions as well as stepping while debugging within the branch delay slot. An interrupt is unable to occur during a branch delay slot and is deferred until after the branch delay slot. Placing branch instruction in the branch delay slot is prohibited or deprecated.

The ideal number of branch delay slots in a particular pipeline implementation is dictated by the number of pipeline stages, the presence of register forwarding, what stage of the pipeline the branch conditions are computed, whether or not a branch target buffer (BTB) is used and many other factors. Software compatibility requirements dictate that an architecture may not change the number of delay slots from one generation to the next. This inevitably requires that newer hardware implementations contain extra hardware to ensure that the architectural behaviour is followed despite no longer being relevant.

==Implementations==
Branch delay slots are found mainly in DSP architectures and older RISC architectures. MIPS, PA-RISC (delayed or non-delayed branch can be specified), ETRAX CRIS, SuperH (unconditional branch instructions have one delay slot), Am29000, Intel i860 (unconditional branch instructions have one delay slot), MC88000 (delayed or non-delayed branch can be specified), and SPARC are RISC architectures that each have a single branch delay slot; PowerPC, ARM, Alpha, V850, and RISC-V do not have any. DSP architectures that each have a single branch delay slot include μPD77230 and the VS DSP. The SHARC DSP and MIPS-X use a double branch delay slot; such a processor will execute a pair of instructions following a branch instruction before the branch takes effect. Both TMS320C3x and TMS320C4x use a triple branch delay slot. The TMS320C4x has both non-delayed and delayed branches.

The following example shows delayed branches in assembly language for the SHARC DSP including a pair after the RTS instruction. Registers R0 through R9 are cleared to zero in order by number (the register cleared after R6 is R7, not R9). No instruction executes more than once.
==Load delay slot==
A load delay slot is an instruction which executes immediately after a load (of a register from memory) but does not see, and need not wait for, the result of the load. Load delay slots are very uncommon because load delays are highly unpredictable on modern hardware. A load may be satisfied from RAM or from a cache, and may be slowed by resource contention. Load delays were seen on very early RISC processor designs. The MIPS I ISA (implemented in the R2000 and R3000 microprocessors) suffers from this problem.

The following example is MIPS I assembly code, showing both a load delay slot and a branch delay slot.

 lw v0,4(v1) # load word from address v1+4 into v0
 nop # wasted load delay slot
 jr v0 # jump to the address specified by v0
 nop # wasted branch delay slot

<doc id="352819" wikidata="Q660895" url="?curid=352819" title="Tokaido Shinkansen">
<text>The Tōkaidō Shinkansen () is a Japanese high-speed rail line that is part of the nationwide Shinkansen network. Along with the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen, it forms a continuous high-speed railway through the Taiheiyō Belt, also known as the Tokaido corridor. Opening in 1964, running between Tokyo and Shin-Ōsaka, it was the world&#x27;s first high-speed rail line, and it remains one of the world&#x27;s busiest. Since 1987, it has been operated by the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), prior to that by Japanese National Railways (JNR).

There are three types of services on the line: from fastest to slowest, they are the limited-stop &quot;Nozomi&quot;, the semi-fast &quot;Hikari&quot;, and the all-stop &quot;Kodama&quot;. Many &quot;Nozomi&quot; and &quot;Hikari&quot; trains continue onward to the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen, going as far as Fukuoka&#x27;s Hakata Station.

The line was named a joint Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark and IEEE Milestone by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers in 2000.

==History==

The predecessor for the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen lines was originally conceived at the end of the 1930s as a &quot;dangan ressha&quot; (bullet train) between Tokyo and Shimonoseki, which would have taken nine hours to cover the nearly distance between the two cities. This project was planned as the first part of an East Asian rail network serving Japan&#x27;s overseas territories. The beginning of World War II stalled the project in its early planning stages, although three tunnels were dug that were later used in the Shinkansen route.

By 1955, the original Tokaido line between Tokyo and Osaka was congested. Even after its electrification the next year, the line was still the busiest in Japan&#x27;s railway network by a long margin, with demand being around double the then capacity. In 1957, a public forum was organized to discuss “The Possibility of a Three-hour Rail Trip Between Tokyo and Osaka.” After substantial debate, the Japanese National Railways (JNR) decided to build a new line alongside the original one to supplement it. The president of JNR at the time, Shinji Sogō, started attempting to persuade politicians to back the project. Realizing the high expenses of the project early on due to the use of new, unfamiliar technologies and the high concentration of tunnels and viaducts, Sogō settled for less government funding than what was needed.

The Diet approved the plan in December 1958, agreeing to fund out of the required over a five-year construction period. Then-finance minister Eisaku Satō recommended that the rest of the funds should be taken from non-governmental sources so that political changes would not cause funding issues. Construction of the line began on April 20, 1959 under Sogō and chief engineer Hideo Shima. In 1960, Shima and Sogō were sent to the United States to borrow money from the World Bank. Although the original request was for US$200 million, they came back with only $80 million, enough to fund 15% of the project, and could not use the loan for &quot;experimental technology&quot;. Severe cost overruns during construction forced both of them to resign. The opening was timed to coincide with the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, which had already brought international attention to the country. Originally, the line was called the &quot;New Tokaido Line&quot; in English. Just like the original railway line, it is named after the Tokaido road that has been used for centuries.

Initially, there were two services: the faster &quot;Hikari&quot; (also called the &quot;Super Express&quot;) made the journey between Tokyo and Shin-Osaka in four hours, while the slower &quot;Kodama&quot; (or the &quot;limited express&quot;) made more stops and took five hours to travel the same route. A test run was conducted August 25, 1964, simulating a &quot;Hikari&quot; service. The run, which was deemed &quot;very successful&quot; by then-JNR president Reisuke Ishida, was also broadcast on television by NHK. On October 1 that same year, the line was officially opened, with the first train, &quot;Hikari 1&quot;, traveling from Tokyo to Shin-Osaka with a top speed of . In November 1965, both services had their schedule reworked so that the new timetable listed travel times of three hours for the &quot;Hikari&quot; and four hours for the &quot;Kodama&quot;.

The 1970s were a difficult time for the JNR as local lines built up deficit. Profits from the Tokaido Shinkansen were used to offset the lines which were running at a loss which resulted in a lack of development and faster service over a 15-year period. Labor issues during that time steered away any attention from JNR executives, further complicating the possibility for research initiatives. Despite the difficult financial situation throughout the 1970s, the loan from the World Bank made in 1959 was paid back in 1981.

In 1988, one year after the privatization of JNR, the new operating company, JR Central, initiated a project to increase operating speeds through infrastructure improvement and a new train design. This resulted in the debut of the 300 Series and the &quot;Nozomi&quot;, the line&#x27;s fastest service which took two and a half hours to traverse the route with a top speed of , on March 14, 1992. 

New platforms for Shinkansen services at Shinagawa Station opened in October 2003, accompanied by a major timetable change which increased the number of daily &quot;Nozomi&quot; services, which was now higher than the number of &quot;Hikari&quot; trains. Initially, certain &quot;Nozomi&quot; and &quot;Hikari&quot; services did not stop at the station, with some skipping either Shinagawa or Shin-Yokohama, and the plurality of services stopping at both. From March 2008 onward, all services stop at both stations. Another station was planned to open in 2012 to serve Rittō, a city between Maibara and Kyoto. Construction started in May 2006, but the project was canceled the next year due to political opposition from the government of the surrounding Shiga Prefecture and the Supreme Court of Japan ruling the bond that the city had issued to fund construction was illegal and had to be canceled.

The next speedup, which raised the top speed to its current level through the use of improved braking technology, was announced in 2014 and introduced on March 14, 2015, the 23rd anniversary of the last speed raise. Initially, just one service per hour would run at this new speed. After the replacement of the older, slower 700 series with the N700 series and N700S series in March 2020, a new timetable taking advantage of the speed increase with more services was planned. However, the COVID-19 pandemic further delayed these plans as service was temporarily cut. An automated operating system is planned to be implemented for the line by 2028, with test runs starting in 2021.

===Timeline===
== Classes and onboard services ==
All Tokaido Shinkansen trains have two classes of seating: Green Cars (First Class) offer 2+2 configured seating with all-reserved seating. Ordinary cars feature 2+3 configured seating with both reserved and unreserved seating. 

Previously, all trains had an onboard trolley service that sold food and drinks. The ice cream sold by these trolleys was popularly known as &quot;Shinkansen too hard ice cream&quot;, which eventually became an official sales name. Trolley service on the Tokaido Shinkansen was discontinued on October 31st, 2023, due to falling sales and labor shortages. This was replaced by a mobile order seat service exclusive for Green Car passengers from 1 November 2023. Passengers can scan a QR code on the back of their seat to purchase refreshments, which would then be brought by a cabin attendant.

In an announcement by JR Central, JR West, and JR Kyushu made on 17 October 2023, the companies stated that all onboard smoking rooms on the Tokaido, San&#x27;yo, and Kyushu Shinkansen trains would be discontinued by Q2 2024.

Since 2020, reservations are required to take large pieces of luggage on Tokaido Shinkansen trains.

== Japan Rail Pass ==
The Japan Rail Pass is a rail pass available to overseas visitors which allows travel on most major forms of transportation provided by JR Group companies, including the Tokaido Shinkansen. Japan Rail Pass holders can ride &quot;Hikari&quot; or &quot;Kodama&quot; services free of charge, and since October 2023, pass holders can also ride the &quot;Nozomi&quot; service by purchasing a special supplementary ticket. Japan Rail Passes purchased prior to this were not valid on &quot;Nozomi&quot; services, and passengers were required to purchase a full fare ticket to use this service. Certain regional Rail Passes let passengers ride all services, including the &quot;Nozomi&quot;. These passes typically have limited coverage and shorter useage periods compared to the full Japan Rail Pass.

==Ridership==
From 1964 to 2012, the Tokaido Shinkansen line carried approximately 5.3 billion passengers. Ridership increased from 61,000 per day in 1964 to 391,000 per day in 2012. By 2016, the route was carrying 452,000 passengers per day on 365 daily services making it one of the busiest high speed railway lines in the world.

==Future stations==
It was announced in June 2010 that a new shinkansen station in Samukawa, Kanagawa Prefecture was under consideration by JR Central. If constructed, the station would open after the Chuo Shinkansen, the new maglev service currently under construction, begins operations.

Shizuoka Prefecture has long lobbied JR Central for the construction of a station at Shizuoka Airport, which the line passes directly beneath. The railway has so far refused, citing the close distance to the neighbouring Kakegawa and Shizuoka stations. If constructed, travel time from the center of Tokyo to the airport would be comparable to that for Tokyo Narita Airport, enabling it to act as a third hub airport for the capital. As the station would be built underneath an active airport, it is expected to open after the new maglev line.

<doc id="352821" wikidata="Q126856" url="?curid=352821" title="She-Ra">
<text>Adora, known by her alter ego She-Ra, is a fictional superheroine in the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; franchise. She is introduced as the protagonist of the 1985 Filmation series &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;, which reveals her to be the long lost twin sister of He-Man. She-Ra again appears in the 2018 reboot &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot;. A series of toys under her name was produced by Mattel in 1984. She has also appeared in a number of &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; comic books, most notably in DC Comics&#x27; 2012–2018 &quot;MOTU&quot; comic series, a roughly 1,000 page single story arc, collected in the 2019 &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe Omnibus&quot; hardcover release. In these comics and in the &quot;Masters of the Universe Classics&quot; toyline, she also has an evil persona called Despara. As Despara, she makes an appearance at the end of Rob David and Kevin Smith&#x27;s 2024 Netflix release &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revolution&quot;, the third installment of the 2021 &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot; animated series. She&#x27;s also featured in multiple story books, mainly Golden Books and Ladybird books, and in some &quot;MOTU&quot; games.

Her first published appearance was in the 1984 minicomic &quot;The Story of She-Ra&quot;, which, like the subsequent He-Man and She-Ra animated feature film, introduced her as He-Man&#x27;s twin sister, Princess Adora, kidnapped by Hordak in her infancy. That minicomic, which features He-Man, the Sorceress of Castle Grayskull, and Castle Grayskull itself, also features one of the first published appearances of both Hordak and Catra. The minicomic was shipped with the 1985 released original She-Ra action-figure/doll.

In the 1985 series, She-Ra was intended to extend the appeal of the &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; setting by being of interest to young girls in the same way that He-Man appealed to young boys. Filmation writers Larry DiTillio and J. Michael Straczynski created the backstory for the property. She-Ra was introduced in the movie &quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot; as Force Captain Adora of the Horde ruling Etheria, but turned out to be Princess Adora, the long-lost twin sister of He-Man, Prince Adam. The 2018 series features a younger She-Ra and is set in a different universe, with only limited connections to &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (primarily through Hordak and the Horde, which originated in the &quot;MOTU&quot; toyline).

==In &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; (1985)==
===Fictional character biography===
King Randor and Queen Marlena from planet Eternia had twins, a boy and a girl named Adam and Adora. Hordak, leader of the Evil Horde, kidnapped Adora and escaped to Etheria, where Adora was raised as a mind-controlled Force Captain of The Horde. Adora&#x27;s uniform – which she continued to wear throughout the series, even after defecting to the Rebels – consisted of a red leotard with long white sleeves, red boots with matching gauntlets, and a black belt.

The Sorceress sent Adam and Cringer to the planet Etheria to find the Sword of Protection&#x27;s rightful owner. The Sorceress, through the jewel in the Sword of Protection, reveals to Adora that she was kidnapped by The Horde when she was a baby and that she had a twin brother in (Adam/He-Man), which she instantly believed. Through her newfound love for her brother and seeing him in trouble, Adora breaks the spell that was making her serve the Horde and transformed into the heroine She-Ra. She then releases a captured He-Man and jumps from a window, crashing into the Horde stables, where she lands atop her personal mount Spirit, who is transformed into Swift Wind, a talking winged unicorn. They fly ahead to warn The Rebellion. He-Man and She-Ra return to Eternia, but she decides she must return to Etheria so that she can help free the planet from the Horde oppression.

Adora, having been trained by the Horde her entire life, assumes leadership of the Great Rebellion. The epic battle to free Etheria from the grip of the Evil Horde rages on, spreading across the corners of the planet. Through this war, She-Ra calls upon her allies across the globe and the Universe, using their special talents to battle against Horde creations. It is implied in several episodes that she has romantic feelings towards the rebel pirate Captain Sea Hawk, who is attracted to her in her guise of Adora, as opposed to She-Ra. In the extended MOTU/POP Universe they get married and have children who aid them in battle on Etheria, Eternia and across the Galaxies. Whether or not She-Ra, He-Man and their friends were ever successful in defeating the Horde or the Forces of Evil was never revealed, as both series were cancelled before any definite resolutions could be reached. However, it was shown that, little-by-little, the citizens and kingdoms all over Etheria were rising up against the Horde and pushing back against their tyranny. Unlike Adam, who often feigned laziness and a carefree attitude to deflect any suspicion that he may be He-Man, Adora never acted against her nature and was always seen as brave and selfless, willing to help others in need at a moment&#x27;s notice.

When Adora transforms to She-Ra, two castles are shown in the background. The first is Castle Grayskull; the second, Crystal Castle, is located atop Skydancer Mountain and is overseen by an entity called Light Hope, who advises She-Ra in times of crisis. In the Princess of Power toyline, the castle is also protected by two winged crystal horses, Moonbeam and Sun Dancer. The Crystal Castle&#x27;s location is known only to Ahgo (King of the Trolls), She-Ra and her allies who know of her secret (Madame Razz, Kowl and Spirit/Swift Wind), and He-Man and his allies who know of his secret (Sorceress, Man at Arms, Orko and Cringer/Battle Cat). She-Ra has sworn to keep its location secret, thus earning the title of &quot;Defender of the Crystal Castle.&quot; In the extended MOTU/POP universe, She-Ra travels alongside Sea Hawk in his new version of the Solar Sailor ship, which can now fly in both space and air, ride the sea on water, and submerge in its depths. She also journeys the Universe alongside He Man in his Starship Eternia as a member of the Galaxy Defenders.

===Powers and abilities===

She-Ra is known for her incredible feats and charisma. She has been shown multiple times to be able to lift not only full-grown men and robots, but also mountain-like rocks and buildings. She is depicted as being extremely fast and acrobatic. Her speed allows her to easily deflect multiple incoming energy blasts with her sword. She-Ra demonstrated a series of other abilities which appear to be more nurturing in nature such as empathic understanding, mental communication with animals, and healing. Whether there is a limit to the length of time she can remain in her heroic form before she reverts to her original form of Adora is unknown. There have been occasions where she is forcibly transformed back into Adora, implying that her powers do have limits to them.

She-Ra&#x27;s primary weapon is her Sword of Protection. It appears almost indestructible and able to deflect bolts of energy, both magical and technological, as well as project beams of energy from the stone in its center. The stone is also used to turn Spirit into Swift Wind, as the power beam needed to perform the transformation comes from it (as opposed to the Sword of Power, where the energy beam that is used to transform Cringer into Battle Cat is shot from the tip of the sword and requires He-Man to point it directly at Cringer in order for it to work).

In one episode, the stone in She-Ra&#x27;s sword becomes damaged, causing her to be unable to transform into She-Ra. Another potential weakness is that the sword requires vocal command: in an episode in which Shadow Weaver captured Adora&#x27;s voice, Adora was then unable to transform into She-Ra as she was unable to speak her words of transformation to the sword (&quot;For the honor of Grayskull, I am She-Ra&quot;).

The sword also had transmutation abilities – upon command it would change shape into whatever She-Ra required at the time, for example a shield, parachute, helmet, rope with grappling hook, and a boomerang. She-Ra is largely non-violent and engages in combat only as a last resort.

===Reception===
She-Ra is mostly considered a positive role model for women, although some have criticized her for being a poor female counterpart to He-Man.

==In &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot; (2018–2020)==

On December 12, 2017, DreamWorks Animation and Netflix announced a reboot series based on She-Ra. The series was executively produced by author ND Stevenson (creator of &quot;Nimona&quot; and &quot;Lumberjanes&quot;). The cast was revealed on May 18, 2018, alongside a poster and the official series title: &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot;. It premiered on November 13, 2018, on Netflix. Unlike the original series, He-Man has no presence in the reboot storyline and is not portrayed to be related or connected in any way, last appearing in a 2002 series. The reboot is a reimagining of the 1980s version and is not part of the Masters of the Universe storyline.

===Fictional character biography===
In this series, Adora is a young teenage girl in season 1, portrayed as a willing member of the Horde who was raised to believe that the princesses are evil and oppress Etheria. She was brought up in the rigorous military environment alongside Catra under their mentor/mother-figure Shadow Weaver, who took Adora in after Hordak found her as a baby years prior. When Adora is promoted to Force Captain, her world view greatly changed when she finds the Sword of Protection one day after sneaking out of the Horde base. She is soon captured by two rebels, Princess Glimmer and her best friend Bow, learning the truth that the Horde are the real oppressors. Upon the revelation and gaining the ability to become She-Ra, Adora joins the rebellion, winning over its hesitant members while struggling in mastering her powers. But Adora&#x27;s defection causes a rift between her and Catra, whose initial feelings of abandonment become resentment towards her closest friend, with Adora eventually seeing Catra as an enemy when she nearly destroyed Etheria out of spite. Catra regains her friendship with Adora and helps in defeating the Horde.

Adora later learns that she is a descendant of the First Ones, a colonizer race that weaponized Etheria to harvest its magic in their Heart of Etheria project, revealed to have been brought to Etheria by Light Hope to fulfill her mission. This forces Adora to destroy the Sword of Protection to prevent Etheria&#x27;s destruction, but leaves it open to invasion by Horde Prime. But while leaving Etheria to save Glimmer and Catra, Adora regains her ability to become She-Ra. Adora later learns that only she can restore the magic to Etheria with the risk of dying in the process, but is saved by Catra as the two finally express their romantic feelings for each other.

===Powers, abilities and appearance===
Compared to the original version of the character, Adora has a much younger appearance, only becoming considerably taller as She-Ra: . In addition, She-Ra&#x27;s costume is much more practical in this incarnation; she wears a full tunic that covers her upper torso with metallic epaulets while wearing bike-short type leggings under her skirt. She now wears practical armored boots with flat soles. In the season 1 finale, She-Ra wears a golden battle armor very similar to when her 2002 twin brother He-Man wears a snake armor in his Season 2.

In the second season, She-Ra uses a new power discovered in her sword, which can transform it into any kind of weapon or piece of equipment. But her control over the transformations is not perfect. After destroying the Sword of Protection in the season 4 finale, Adora couldn&#x27;t transform until halfway through season 5, after which she gained a new unnamed appearance for She-Ra (dubbed She-Ra 2.0 by fans): she wore her long golden hair in a regular ponytail that reached down to her back, wore a different diadem/headpiece with smaller wings, white pants with golden bracelets for her thighs and longer golden arm bands while the sword became a mystic projection that turns into a slimmed-down battle blade.

===Reception===
While reviewing the first season of &quot;Princesses of Power&quot;, Alex Abad-Santos of &quot;Vox&quot; praised how the series fleshed out her character, calling the rebooted rendition of Adora &quot;more human than the original&quot;. Conversely, IGN&#x27;s David Griffin was more critical of Adora, writing that her &quot;sudden lifestyle change feels rushed, like we needed a few more episodes of her mentally wrestling with the implications of it all.&quot; Griffin also criticized her &quot;seemingly unparalleled strength,&quot; stating it &quot;often makes her seem more like One Punch Woman and robs the show of much of its suspense once Adora transforms.&quot;

Adora&#x27;s unambiguously lesbian relationship with Catra was positively received by critics, with many considering their dynamic &quot;captivating&quot; and &quot;groundbreaking&quot;.

==In other media==
===&quot;The Story of She-Ra&quot;===
While Adora/She-Ra&#x27;s first on screen appearance was the 1985 animated theatrical movie &quot;He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot;, her actual very first appearance was in the 1984 created and published &quot;The Story of She-Ra&quot; Mattel minicomic, which was packaged with the original She-Ra toy. The main premise of the story, the first ever published story of She-Ra&#x27;s origin, is roughly identical to the version shown in &quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot; movie, opening in almost the exact same manner, with the Sorceress of Grayskull having a nightmarish recollection of baby Princess Adora being abducted from the royal palace of Eternia by the evil warlock/warlord Hordak, and whisked away to Etheria. As in the movie &amp; subsequent &quot;She-Ra&quot; television series, Adora&#x27;s twin brother Adam/He-Man is sent to find her. Differences between the comic and the film include Catra being a more powerful and prominent villain in the comic (she becomes the primary antagonist, and is also portrayed as a powerful sorceress, able to transform people into werecats), and slight differences in the looks of Catra, She-Ra and the Crystal Palace.

===&quot;He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword&quot; (1985 animated film)===

In 1985, Filmation, the studio which produced the He-Man cartoon series, released a full-length 91 minute feature film titled The Secret of the Sword also known as He-Man and She-Ra: The Secret of the Sword. The movie transitioned from a focus on He-Man, to an introduction of Adam&#x27;s/He-Man&#x27;s twin sister Adora, whom the film reveals to have been abducted, as an infant, by Hordak and Skeletor. Hordak raised Adora to be a warrior and captain for his Evil Horde, and hid her true heritage from her. The film reveals that He-Man&#x27;s power sword also has a twin, the Sword of Protection, which, when wielded by Adora to summon the power of Grayskull, transforms her into She-Ra, the female counterpart to He-Man. The movie grossed over three times its two-million dollar production budget. It was later divided into several shorter segments, and aired on television as the first several episodes of the &quot;He-Man &amp; MOTU&quot; spinoff series &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot;.

===&quot;He-Man &amp; She-Ra: A Christmas Special&quot; (1985 made for television Christmas movie)===

At the height of the conjoined popularity of the &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; and &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; cartoons, Filmation produced this made for television Christmas movie, and aired it in syndication during the 1985 Christmas Holiday season. The original &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; cartoon series had aired its final new episode the prior month, and continued to air in re-run episodes for some time after. Its sister show, &quot;She-Ra: Princess of Power&quot; was still in its first season. The Christmas special reunited twins He-Man and She-Ra in their biggest joint adventure since &quot;The Secret of the Sword&quot;. It commences with Queen Marlena reflecting nostalgically about Christmases on Earth, and, after a series of misadventures set in motion by Orko, climaxes with a confrontation that pits He-Man, She-Ra and Skeletor (whose bone-hard heart has been briefly softened by a pair of Earthling children, a peculiar pup, and Christmas Spirit) against Hordak and Horde Prime.

===&quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; film (1987)===
She-Ra was originally intended to appear in &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; and concept art by production designer William Stout was even commissioned, but director Gary Goddard felt it would be best to concentrate on He-Man for the first film. (It would be the only film.) She-Ra was planned to appear in the sequel; the sequel film was cancelled and rewritten into &quot;Cyborg&quot;, with She-Ra&#x27;s equivalent character, Nady Simmons, portrayed by Deborah Richter.

===&quot;Robot Chicken&quot;===
She-Ra appears in a 2007 skit on the Adult Swim series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, where she is bothered by several male characters needing help to save other characters not realizing that She-Ra was on her period. Adora, fed up with being bothered, angrily turns into She-Ra and makes quick work of all the villains so &quot;she can get some fucking sleep&quot;.

===&quot;Masters of the Universe Classics&quot; (2008–2015)===
She-Ra appears in the Mattel &quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; toyline launched in 2008, which attempts to create a new canon by merging selected portions of existing media together with new story elements. The story is told via a combination of mini-comics packaged with the action figures and the biographies printed on the toy packaging.

In this version of events, Hordak arrived on Etheria after being trapped in the dimension of Despondos by King Grayskull. His apprentice Skeletor kidnaps Adora and sends her to Etheria. After being raised by the Horde and becoming She-Ra (as in the cartoon series), she eventually returns to Eternia with several of her friends and allies, to help He-Man defeat Hordak, who has overthrown King Randor and conquered the planet. She-Ra follows her brother into space on their &quot;New Adventures&quot; to the planet Primus, and together they battle the Horde Empire&#x27;s ruler Horde Prime. At some point in the future, she would end up returning in the new, villainous persona of Despara upon becoming possessed by Horde Prime.

===DC Comics (2012–2020)===
In December 2012, She-Ra appeared in her own DC Comics series as a lead-in to her introduction into the &quot;He-Man and the Masters of the Universe&quot; comic series. Adora&#x27;s introduction is an updated retelling of her classic origin story. Although she was still kidnapped as a baby and raised by the Horde, Adora&#x27;s personality and life are made much more violent and tragic when compared to her animated counterpart.

Rather than being a kind woman who has been under the mind control of Shadow Weaver, Despara (Adora&#x27;s Horde name) is a brutal force captain who is fully aware of the Horde&#x27;s cruel and evil nature and, although she has some reservations, serves them willingly. Rather than having already taken over the planet of Etheria, instead, Despara leads the Horde in taking over Eternia and driving He-Man, King Randor and the Masters into hiding so as to rebel against the Horde. Due to a connection between herself and Teela, Adora begins to break free of the Horde&#x27;s will, and begins her journey into becoming She-Ra.

===&quot;He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe&quot; (2012)===
She-Ra appeared in the 2012 handheld video game &quot;He-Man: The Most Powerful Game in the Universe&quot;.

===&quot;Masters of the Universe: Revolution&quot; (2024)===
In &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revelation&quot;″s third part, &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revolution&quot;, she appears first in a flashback in the third episode when she was kidnapped by Hordak as a baby, and in her Despara persona during the fifth episode&#x27;s epilogue. She is voiced by Grey DeLisle in her Despara form.

In the comic book tie-in &quot;Masters of the Universe: Revolution&quot; #4, published by Dark Horse Comics, Despara appears at the end of the story, a variant cover features the phrase &quot;Who is Despara?&quot;.

===&quot;She-Ra&quot; live action television series ===
On September 13, 2021, Amazon announced that a live action &quot;She-Ra&quot; series is in development with DreamWorks Animation serving as an executive producer as the series will be a new, standalone story and will not be connected to the 2018 animated show but a 2026 Masters of the Universe film.

===&quot;Masters of the Universe&quot; (2026 film)===
Adora Glenn/She-Ra would appear in the end of the upcoming 2026 movie.

<doc id="352822" wikidata="Q14712980" url="?curid=352822" title="Northern Neck">
<text>The Northern Neck is the northernmost of three peninsulas (traditionally called &quot;necks&quot; in Virginia) on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay in the Commonwealth of Virginia (along with the Middle Peninsula and the Virginia Peninsula). The Potomac River forms the northern boundary of the peninsula; the Rappahannock River demarcates it on the south. The land between these rivers was formed into Northumberland County in 1648, prior to the creation of Westmoreland County and Lancaster County. 

The Northern Neck encompasses the following Virginia counties: Lancaster, Northumberland, Richmond,and Westmoreland; it had a total population of 50,158 as of the 2020 census.

Commentators vary as to whether to include King George County in the Northern Neck. Historically, Charles II&#x27;s grant for the Northern Neck included all land between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers, including far upstream of King George County comprising some five million acres. The boundaries of King George and Westmoreland counties have changed radically since their establishment, with significant exchanges of territory. Significant portions of the early King George County lie in present-day Westmoreland County.

==History==
===17th century===
In the winter of 1607–08, Captain John Smith traveled up the Rappahannock River as a prisoner of the Powhatans. He was the first European known to have visited the Northern Neck. Undaunted, he repeated the voyage in June 1608, with 14 companions in an open barge, reaching the Potomac River by June 16. He visited Native American villages, including one near present-day Nomini, which he described and named in later accounts, but found no treasure, only an abundance of fur-bearing animals. In 1621, the boy Henry Fleet was among the passengers on a ship taking new governor Francis Wyatt to Virginia, and shortly after his arrival he accompanied Captain Henry Spelman on a trading trip up the Potomac River that included founding a trading post in Georgetown, later incorporated into Washington, D.C. However, on March 22, 1622, Spelman and 19 crewmen were killed in a native village during the widespread massacres on that day, but Fleet was allowed to live as a prisoner until ransomed five years later. He soon sailed to England and formed a business relationship with William Cloberry, who funded a trading voyage from Virginia to New England. By 1628 Fleet had accumulated enough money to buy a plantation in Accomac County on Virginia&#x27;s Eastern Shore, and he continued to support his family by trading as well as acting as an interpreter with native tribes, including for Maryland Governor Leonard Calvert during a period of residence in Maryland, where he purchased land. Fleet again returned to England from 1646 until 1648, where he married a much younger woman, then brought her to Virginia, where he patented 1,750 acres of land in what soon officially became vast Lancaster County. Fleet became one of the county&#x27;s first four burgesses in 1652 but died intestate in 1660 or 1661.

Meanwhile, in 1634, the Crown reserved the land between the Rappahannock and Potomac Rivers for native Americans, calling it the &quot;Chicacoan Indian District.&quot; Nonetheless, many of the original English settlers were Marylanders, who had settled on Kent Island but were caught in a long running controversy between Virginia trader (and burgess) William Claiborne and Lord Baltimore over the island&#x27;s ownership. Claiborne aligned with the Parliamentary party during England&#x27;s Civil War, and Lord Baltimore had been King Charles&#x27; Secretary of State before his death in 1632, shortly before King Charles formally affirmed Calvert&#x27;s claim as superior. In late 1637 or early 1638, Lord Baltimore&#x27;s son and heir Cecil Calvert sent his brother Leonard to occupy Kent Island by force, hence the exodus to the Virginia shore. In 1639, the Proprietors of the Island of Bermuda petitioned leave to have settlers occupy that land between the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers. Although that petition disappeared and presumably was not granted, in 1641 the Virginia General Assembly granted the right to do so &quot;provided that the number that seat there bee not under twoe hundred persons, and not less than six able tithable persons in everye familye that there sitt [sic]&quot; and the following year also gave permission for prospective settlement north of the Rappahannock River while also denying &quot;for divers reasons&quot; the right to occupy the land.

John Carter Sr. received the first specific land grant north of the Rappahannock River on August 15, 1642, for 1300 acres on Cossotomen Creak (which became Carters Creek). Carter settled on the land several years later, farmed it using enslaved labor and made it his home, creating Corotoman Plantation. Carter also would serve many terms as a burgess representing Lancaster County, as well as hold local civil and military offices. In 1642-43, three others received land grants in what eventually became Lancaster County; then six years passed before Epaphroditus Lawson received a land grant for 700 acres beginning on the eastward side of the mouth of Slaughter&#x27;s Creek and adjoining John Carter&#x27;s land. The Virginia General Assembly officially allowed settlement of the Northern Neck on October 12, 1648, by creating then-vast Northumberland County as the neck of land between those rivers. The Northumberland County Court was first held on August 24, 1650, and set up a government, only to be divided at the next General Assembly session, whereby the part west of the ridge became then-vast Rappahannock County.

The original Northern Neck land grant in 1661 was a land grant first issued by the exiled English King Charles II in 1649. It encompassed all the unsettled lands bounded by the Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers and, later, by a straight line (the &quot;Fairfax Line&quot;) connecting their sources. This grant was significantly larger than the area currently known as the Northern Neck. John Carter&#x27;s descendant received the nickname King Carter and was not only the local Virginia agent for the England-based proprietor, but also a powerful politician and landowner in his own right. The relation between proprietary lands and non-proprietary lands created considerable confusion and some degree of semi-autonomy relative to the colonial government until the American Revolution.

Most early development occurred on the peninsula&#x27;s eastern end, because both the Potomac and Rappahannock river were navigable waters, and roads were limited and/or in poor condition. The autonomy and the excellent natural resources allowed rich planters to arise who established tobacco plantations in the Northern Neck. During the Colonial period, some considered the Northern Neck as the &quot;Athens of the New World&quot; because it had many wealthy landowners who were dedicated to learning, gentlemanly society, and civic duty. However, this elite society and economy was based on the exploitation of enslaved Africans and black Americans. The aristocratic society and autonomy of the Northern Neck created strong antipathies between the Northern Neck and other regions of Virginia. Later as tobacco cultivation and erosion wore out the soil, and the remainder of the mid-Atlantic states became developed, the Northern Neck&#x27;s importance declined. It was relatively isolated from main trade routes and cities. This isolation may be a product of the earlier antipathies related to the differences in society in the Neck and in the regions farther south.

In 1687, a widespread slave conspiracy was crushed in the Northern Neck. During a mass funeral, slaves in the area planned to kill all whites and escape. The plot was discovered, and its leaders executed. When authorities learned that they had plotted the uprising at gatherings for slave funerals, they prohibited such events.

The next year, in 1688, the Northern Neck was the site of another attempted uprising, this one led by &quot;Sam, a Negro Servt to Richard Metcalfe.&quot; A repeat offender, he had &quot;several times endeavored to promote a Negro Insurreccon in this Colony.&quot; &quot;To deter him &amp; others from the like evil practice for time to come,&quot; the court ordered the sheriff of James City County to whip him severely and return him to the Westmoreland County sheriff to be whipped again. Sam was sentenced to forever wear &quot;a strong Iron collar affixed about his neck with four sprigs.&quot; Should he leave his master&#x27;s plantation or remove the collar, he would be hanged.

===18th century===
In February 1766, 115 Northern Neck prominent citizens signed the Leedstown Resolutions, named after Leedstown, an active port in (then) King George County. This was the first recorded act of resistance against the Stamp Act. Leedstown is now in Westmoreland County.

Mixed vegetable and grain farming were adopted by the later colonial period.

Later, the area developed a strong seafood industry. Reedville was once the wealthiest town in the United States, due to its menhaden fishing industry. Before the era of modern highways, many passenger and freight steamer routes linked the Chesapeake Bay region and connected with the railroads developed after 1830.

Many important historical figures were born on the Northern Neck, including U.S. presidents George Washington (Westmoreland), James Madison (Port Conway in King George), and James Monroe (Westmoreland), as well as signers of the Declaration of Independence, Francis Lightfoot Lee and Richard Henry Lee, and the Confederate Civil War general Robert E. Lee. Richard Henry Lee was elected as the sixth president under the Articles of Confederation. Also residing in Westmoreland was Colonel Nicholas Spencer, member of the House of Burgesses, secretary and president of the Governor&#x27;s Council, and on the departure of his cousin Thomas Colepeper, 2nd Baron Colepeper (aka Lord Culpeper), acting governor. Robert Carter I, agent for Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, born at Corotoman Plantation, became President of the Governor&#x27;s Council of the Virginia Colony and briefly acting Governor of Virginia (1726-1727) following the death in office of Governor Hugh Drysdale. His sons John Carter married Elizabeth Hill of Shirley Plantation and Landon Carter married Maria Byrd, daughter of Col. William Byrd II and resided at Sabine Hall, his grandson Robert Carter III inherited Nonomy Hall – purchased from the aforementioned Nicholas Spencer. Finally, the Tayloe Family established their family seat Mount Airy, on the southern shore of the neck, across from Tappahannock on a high perch overlooking the Rappahannock River. John Tayloe I, John Tayloe II who built Mount Airy and after Menokin for his son-in-law Francis Lightfoot Lee, John Tayloe III who later built the Octagon House and his sons John Tayloe IV, Benjamin Ogle Tayloe, William Henry Tayloe and George Plater Tayloe were all born here.

====American Civil War====
During the American Civil War, Northern Neck and particularly, King George County were on the frontier between the Union and Confederate armies. As such, King George was an operating base for spies on both sides. The Union forces controlled the Potomac River and the north shore of the Rappahannock River farther upstream for much of the war.

While trying to elude Union cavalry, on April 21, 1865, the co-conspirators John Wilkes Booth and David Herold crossed by rowboat into the Northern Neck in King George County from Maryland after assassinating President Abraham Lincoln. Booth and Herold landed at the mouth of Gambo Creek before meeting with Confederate agents who guided their passage to Port Conway. There, they crossed the Rappahannock River to Port Royal in Caroline County. Booth was killed and Herold captured a short distance away at Garrett&#x27;s Farm.

====Colonial Beach====
Colonial Beach, a small incorporated town in Westmoreland County located on the Potomac River waterfront, developed as a popular tourist spot for the people of the Washington, D.C. area in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It offered a beach, swimming, and gambling. The gambling facilities were built on piers extending into the Potomac River to ensure they were inside Maryland, as the state border runs along the southern low tide line of the Potomac River. With the end of gambling, and improved access to competing beaches in Maryland and Delaware, Colonial Beach declined in popularity as a tourist destination. It and the rest of the Northern Neck still continue to attract dedicated outdoor enthusiasts for fishing and boating.

==Geography==
The region has 1100 miles of shoreline, containing beaches, marinas, old steamship wharfs, and small towns that date to colonial times. Today small farms, vineyards, and wineries are interspersed with retirement communities and rural businesses that share the land. Since the 1970s, winemaking has increased in importance in the Northern Neck. The federal government has recognized the Northern Neck George Washington Birthplace American Viticultural Area as a sanctioned wine appellation for wines grown in the five counties.

Significant portions of the Rappahannock River Valley National Wildlife Refuge lie in the Northern Neck. It also is home to five state parks and natural areas, including Caledon Natural Area, Bush Mill Stream Natural Area Preserve, Dameron Marsh Natural area, and Westmoreland and Belle Isle state parks. The George Washington Birthplace National Monument is a National Park Service unit.

==Festivals==
In 2004, the Menokin Bluegrass Festival was launched in Richmond County at the ruins of Francis Lightfoot Lee&#x27;s ancestral home, Menokin. The festival attracts thousands of bluegrass fans every year to celebrate the Northern Neck&#x27;s musical and historical heritage.

The Richmond County Fair, started in 1989, is dubbed the &quot;Biggest Little Fair in the South.&quot; It is held in August in Warsaw. The King George Fall Festival, founded in 1959, is held the second weekend of October in King George County. All proceeds from this event go to support the King George Fire and Rescue. The Fall Festival Committee is made up of representatives from all of the county&#x27;s community organizations. The Fall Festival includes a parade through town, a carnival, a craft fair, a dance, and the Fall Festival Queen Pageant.

Stratford Hall hosts an annual Historical Haunts program. Activities include ghost tours of the Great House, pumpkin painting, various Halloween crafts, picture-taking with Frankenstein and a witch, and an eighteenth-century fortune teller.

==Tourism==
Tourism is a significant source of economic activity in the Northern Neck region. Visitors are attracted to the natural resources, and history and heritage of the peninsula. Natural attractions include national parks, state parks, and agri-tourism, while a number of historic sites related to the nation&#x27;s founders are open to the public. Colonial Beach, Westmoreland State Park, Rappahannock River National Wildlife Refuge, and many other locations provide water access for fishing, boating, and yachting. The region has twenty-seven marinas.

There are nine wineries in the region that may be found on the Chesapeake Bay Wine Trail.

Other popular Northern Neck attractions include Stratford Hall, the birthplace of Robert E. Lee and an example of a Virginia plantation, George Washington Birthplace National Monument, the Westmoreland Berry Farm, and the Westmoreland State Park with Horsehead Cliffs.

The Northern Neck National Heritage Area was established in the National Heritage Area Act in 2022. The National Heritage Area will help preserve historic and cultural sites in the five counties.

<doc id="352823" wikidata="Q5272043" url="?curid=352823" title="Diary of an Ordinary Woman">
<text>Diary of an Ordinary Woman is a novel by Margaret Forster, framed as an &quot;edited&quot; diary of a fictional woman who lives through most of the major events of the 20th century, covering the years 1914 to 1995. So realistic that many readers believed it to be an authentic diary, it is one of Forster&#x27;s best-known novels.

Martin Chilton, writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, describes it as an &quot;intermittent record of a quiet life dominated by the fact, the threat and the fear of war&quot; and considers its main theme to be the cost of war.

==Plot==
From the age of thirteen, on the eve of the Great War, Millicent King keeps her journals in a series of exercise books. The diary records the dramas of everyday life in an ordinary English family touched by war, tragedy, and money troubles in the early decades of the century. She struggles to become a teacher, but wants more out of life. From bohemian literary London to Rome in the twenties, her story moves on to social work and the build-up to another war, in which she drives ambulances through the bombed streets of London. She has proposals of marriage and secret lovers, ambition and optimism, but then her life is turned upside down once more by wartime deaths.

==Reception==
Helen Falconer writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot; concludes &quot;Millicent never lived, this diary is an authentic record of how a century of English women were shaped - or, rather, distorted - by war. Anyone who cannot understand their mother or grandmother&#x27;s generation can discover here what caused their emotional restraint, their passion for collecting short pieces of string, their chronic inability to cook, and above all their commitment to us, our families and our children&#x27;s futures. This is fiction; yet this is true&quot;.

<doc id="352827" wikidata="Q523876" url="?curid=352827" title="Spin–statistics theorem">
<text>The spin–statistics theorem proves that the observed relationship between the intrinsic spin of a particle (angular momentum not due to the orbital motion) and the quantum particle statistics of collections of such particles is a consequence of the mathematics of quantum mechanics. In units of the reduced Planck constant &quot;ħ&quot;, all particles that move in 3 dimensions have either integer spin and obey Bose–Einstein statistics or half-integer spin and obey Fermi–Dirac statistics.

==Spin-statistics connection==
All known particles obey either Fermi–Dirac statistics or Bose–Einstein statistics. A particle&#x27;s intrinsic spin always predicts the statistics of a collection of such particles and conversely:
* integral-spin particles are bosons with Bose–Einstein statistics,
* half-integral-spin particles are fermions with Fermi–Dirac statistics.
A spin–statistics theorem shows that the mathematical logic of quantum mechanics predicts or explains this physical result. 

The statistics of indistinguishable particles is among the most fundamental of physical effects.
The Pauli exclusion principle that every occupied quantum state contains at most one fermion controls the formation of matter. The basic building blocks of matter such as protons, neutrons, and electrons are all fermions. Conversely, particles such as the photon, which mediate forces between matter particles, are all bosons. 
A spin–statistics theorem attempts to explain the origin of this fundamental dichotomy.

==Background==
Naively, spin, an angular momentum property intrinsic to a particle, would be unrelated to fundamental properties of a collection of such particles. However, these are indistinguishable particles: any physical prediction relating multiple indistinguishable particles must not change when the particles are exchanged. 

===Quantum states and indistinguishable particles===
In a quantum system, a physical state is described by a state vector. A pair of distinct state vectors are physically equivalent if they differ only by an overall phase factor, ignoring other interactions. A pair of indistinguishable particles such as this have only one state. This means that if the positions of the particles are exchanged (i.e., they undergo a permutation), this does not identify a new physical state, but rather one matching the original physical state. In fact, one cannot tell which particle is in which position.

While the physical state does not change under the exchange of the particles&#x27; positions, it is possible for the state vector to change sign as a result of an exchange. Since this sign change is just an overall phase, this does not affect the physical state.

The essential ingredient in proving the spin-statistics relation is relativity, that the physical laws do not change under Lorentz transformations. The field operators transform under Lorentz transformations according to the spin of the particle that they create, by definition.

Additionally, the assumption (known as microcausality) that spacelike-separated fields either commute or anticommute can be made only for relativistic theories with a time direction. Otherwise, the notion of being spacelike is meaningless. However, the proof involves looking at a Euclidean version of spacetime, in which the time direction is treated as a spatial one, as will be now explained.

Lorentz transformations include 3-dimensional rotations and boosts. A boost transfers to a frame of reference with a different velocity and is mathematically like a rotation into time. By analytic continuation of the correlation functions of a quantum field theory, the time coordinate may become imaginary, and then boosts become rotations. The new &quot;spacetime&quot; has only spatial directions and is termed &quot;Euclidean&quot;.

===Exchange symmetry or permutation symmetry===

Bosons are particles whose wavefunction is symmetric under such an exchange or permutation, so if we swap the particles, the wavefunction does not change. Fermions are particles whose wavefunction is antisymmetric, so under such a swap the wavefunction gets a minus sign, meaning that the amplitude for two identical fermions to occupy the same state must be zero. This is the Pauli exclusion principle: two identical fermions cannot occupy the same state. This rule does not hold for bosons.

In quantum field theory, a state or a wavefunction is described by field operators operating on some basic state called the &quot;vacuum&quot;. In order for the operators to project out the symmetric or antisymmetric component of the creating wavefunction, they must have the appropriate commutation law. The operator

:formula_1

(with formula_2 an operator and formula_3 a numerical function with complex values) creates a two-particle state with wavefunction formula_3, and depending on the commutation properties of the fields, either only the antisymmetric parts or the symmetric parts matter.

Let us assume that formula_5 and the two operators take place at the same time; more generally, they may have spacelike separation, as is explained hereafter.

If the fields commute, meaning that the following holds:

:formula_6

then only the symmetric part of formula_7 contributes, so that formula_8, and the field will create bosonic particles.

On the other hand, if the fields anti-commute, meaning that formula_2 has the property that

:formula_10

then only the antisymmetric part of formula_7 contributes, so that formula_12, and the particles will be fermionic.

==Proofs==
An elementary explanation for the spin–statistics theorem cannot be given despite the fact that the theorem is so simple to state. In &quot;The Feynman Lectures on Physics&quot;, Richard Feynman said that this probably means that we do not have a complete understanding of the fundamental principle involved.

Numerous notable proofs have been published, with different kinds of limitations and assumptions. They are all &quot;negative proofs&quot;, meaning that they establish that integral spin fields cannot result in fermion statistics while half-integral spin fields cannot result in boson statistics. 

Proofs that avoid using any relativistic quantum field theory mechanism have defects. Many such proofs rely on a claim that 
formula_13
where the operator formula_14 permutes the coordinates. However, the value on the left-hand side represents the probability of particle 1 at formula_15, particle 2 at formula_16, and so on, and is thus quantum-mechanically invalid for indistinguishable particles.

The first proof was formulated in 1939 by Markus Fierz, a student of Wolfgang Pauli, and was rederived in a more systematic way by Pauli the following year. 
In a later summary, Pauli listed three postulates within relativistic quantum field theory as required for these versions of the theorem:
# Any state with particle occupation has higher energy than the vacuum state.
# Spatially separated measurements do not disturb each other (they commute).
# Physical probabilities are positive (the metric of the Hilbert space is positive-definite).
Their analysis neglected particle interactions other than commutation/anti-commutation of the state.

In 1949 Richard Feynman gave a completely different type of proof based on vacuum polarization, which was later critiqued by Pauli. Pauli showed that Feynman&#x27;s proof explicitly relied on the first two postulates he used and implicitly used the third one by first allowing negative probabilities but then rejecting field theory results with probabilities greater than one.

A proof by Julian Schwinger in 1950 based on time-reversal invariance followed a proof by Frederik Belinfante in 1940 based on charge-conjugation invariance, leading to a connection to the CPT theorem more fully developed by Pauli in 1955. These proofs were notably difficult to follow.

Work on the axiomatization of quantum field theory by Arthur Wightman lead to a theorem that stated that the expectation value of the product of two fields, formula_17, could be analytically continued to all separations formula_18. (The first two postulates of the Pauli-era proofs involve the vacuum state and fields at separate locations.) The new result allowed more rigorous proofs of the spin–statistics theorems by Gerhart Luders and Bruno Zumino and by Peter Burgoyne. In 1957 Res Jost derived the CPT theorem using the spin–statistics theorem, and Burgoyne&#x27;s proof of the spin–statistics theorem in 1958 required no constraints on the interactions nor on the form of the field theories. These results are among the most rigorous practical theorems.

In spite of these successes, Feynman, in his 1963 undergraduate lecture that discussed the spin–statistics connection, says: &quot;We apologize for the fact that we cannot give you an elementary explanation.&quot; Neuenschwander echoed this in 1994, asking whether there was any progress, spurring additional proofs and books. Neuenschwander&#x27;s 2013 popularization of the spin–statistics connection suggested that simple explanations remain elusive.

== Experimental tests ==
In 1987 Greenberg and Mohaparra proposed that the spin–statistics theorem could have small violations.
With the help of very precise calculations for states of the He atom that violate the Pauli exclusion principle, Deilamian, Gillaspy and Kelleher looked for the 1s2s 1S0 state of He using an atomic-beam spectrometer. The search was unsuccessful with an upper limit of 5×10−6.

==Relation to representation theory of the Lorentz group==
The Lorentz group has no non-trivial unitary representations of finite dimension. Thus it seems impossible to construct a Hilbert space in which all states have finite, non-zero spin and positive, Lorentz-invariant norm. This problem is overcome in different ways depending on particle spin–statistics.

For a state of integer spin the negative norm states (known as &quot;unphysical polarization&quot;) are set to zero, which makes the use of gauge symmetry necessary.

For a state of half-integer spin the argument can be circumvented by having fermionic statistics.

== Quasiparticle anyons in 2 dimensions==

In 1982, physicist Frank Wilczek published a research paper on the possibilities of possible fractional-spin particles, which he termed anyons from their ability to take on &quot;any&quot; spin. He wrote that they were theoretically predicted to arise in low-dimensional systems where motion is restricted to fewer than three spatial dimensions. Wilczek described their spin statistics as &quot;interpolating continuously between the usual boson and fermion cases&quot;. The effect has become the basis for understanding the fractional quantum hall effect.

<doc id="352835" wikidata="Q7571748" url="?curid=352835" title="Soviet ballroom dances">
<text>Soviet ballroom dance was a category of ballroom dance competitions in the former Soviet Union. Competitions in Ballroom dancing in the USSR were held in three dance categories: &quot;Standard dances&quot;, &quot;Latin dances&quot;, and Soviet dances (&quot;Советская программа&quot;).

== Soviet category ==

The Soviet category comprised
:- Polka - Rylio - Varu-Varu - Sudarushka - Russian Lyrical ()

With the exception of Polka, these dances were choreographed basing on some folk dances of Soviet republics.
: - Rylio, of Lithuanian origin, created by Skaistė Idzelevičienė, the leader of the Lithuanian ballroom formation team Žuvėdra.
: - Varu-Varu (translated as &quot;I can, I can&quot;), of Latvian origin.
: - Sudarushka (loosely translated as &quot;sweetheart&quot;), of Russian origin, and
: - Russian Lyrical.

The former three are &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;rhythmic&quot; dances, the latter two are &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;lyrical&quot; ones.

All of them had distinctive basic techniques. The meter was or for all of them. The hold was either open or loose, without body contact. Polka had the tightest hold. Polka, Sudarushka and Russian Lyrical were progressive dances, i.e., moving along the line of dance. Rylio and Varu-Varu were of &quot;stationary&quot; type.

Today the category is obsolete, but the dances themselves survived, moved back to the category of folk dances. At some dance events, such as &quot;Neva Cup&quot; (Невский кубок) in St. Petersburg, balls of Esta-Mephi club, Moscow, or &quot;Russian Formation Cup-2007&quot; held in Tyumen these dances comprise the competition category of &quot;Homeland Dances&quot; (Отечественные танцы).

===Some basic step-rhythm patterns===

The count cues could be any of 12345678, 12341234, 1&amp;2&amp;3&amp;4&amp; or 1&amp;2&amp;1&amp;2&amp;.

====Rylio====
:In-place basic:
:Double hand hold in various positions, e.g., sidewise-forward on the shoulder level, elbows bent down. 
:Steps of partners are mirrored.
:1-2, 3-4, 5-6-7-8: tap-step, tap-step, step-step-step-step.
All steps/taps are in place, with slight one-foot skipping action. Author - choreographer - Adomas Gineitis

====Varu-Varu====

The dance is based on simple steps and jumpy movements created in 1950s in Latvia. It may be danced with any in 4/4 time disco music.
:In-place basic:
:Double hand hold, waist level.
:Partners start with the same foot and go in a small circle, first in one direction, then in the opposite one.
:1-2-3-4, 5-6-7-8: side-together-side-heel, side-together-side-heel
:Skips: (12),(34),5,6,(78) (or slow-slow-quick-quick-slow): skip...skip...skip-skip-skip. A skip is from one foot to another, the freed foot pointing forward, toe on the floor.

====Sudarushka====
The dance is based on Russian &quot;khorovod&quot; dances. the dance is of vivid and light character, of medium to faster tempo in 2/4 time.
:Triple-Step Basic Walks:
: Right-to-left handhold, Free hands are on the waist. 
: Steps are mirrored, along the line of dance.
: 1-2-3-4, 5-6-7-8: step-step-step-tap, step-step-step-tap. 
:Tap is toe beside the support foot.
:Initially the partners face each other. During the first triple step they &quot;fan out&quot; away from each other, free arms fanning sidewise. During the second triple partners &quot;fan in&quot;, back to facing each other, free hands back on the waist.

====Russian Lyrical====
The dance is based on Russian folk tunes. It has a soft and smooth character, danced at medium tempo in 2/4 or 4/4 time.
:Starts in shadow position, man&#x27;s right hand on lady&#x27;s waist, left arms linked pointing left diagonal.
:Most walks are based on &quot;Russian triple step&quot;: step-step-step-hold. It can be performed forward, backward, with turn on any step.

The recommended tunes are &quot;Русский лирический&quot; (&quot;Russian Lyrical&quot;) or &quot;Подмосковные вечера&quot; (&quot;Moscow Nights&quot;)

==Other Soviet ballroom==
Ballroom dance manuals of Soviet times list quite a few other Soviet dances promoted to counter the influence of the &quot;Western way of life&quot;, created basing on folk dances of the peoples of the Soviet Union and Soviet Bloc:
*Tuyana / Туяна (Buryat origin)
*Yatranochka / Ятраночка (Ukrainian, &quot;A Girl from the Yatran River&quot;); choreographed by the Ukrainian ballroom dance troupe in 1971
*Slavutyanochka / Славутянка (Ukrainian, &quot;A Girl from Slavutych&quot;)
*Gutsulka / Гуцулка (Ukrainian, &quot;Hutsul Woman&quot;)
*Jooksupolka / Йоксу-полька (Estonian)
*Transcarpathian Ballroom / Закарпатский бальный (Ukrainian)
*Kazakh Ballroom / Казахский бальный (Kazakh)
*Figure Waltz / Фигурный вальс
*Vesyalaya Hora / Веселая хора (Moldavian)
*&quot;Разрешите пригласить&quot;
*&quot;Skaters&quot; / &quot;Конькобежцы&quot;

<text>Soyuz 22 (, &quot;Union 22&quot;) was a September 1976, Soviet crewed spaceflight. It was an Earth sciences mission using a modified Soyuz spacecraft, and was also, some observers speculated, a mission to observe NATO exercises near Norway.

The spacecraft was a refurbished Soyuz that had served as a backup for the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (ASTP) mission the previous year.

Cosmonauts Valery Bykovsky and Vladimir Aksyonov spent a week in orbit photographing the surface of the Earth with a specially-built camera.

Soyuz 22 was launched to orbit 15 September 1976 at the unusually high inclination of 64.75°, not used since the Voskhod program. The orbiting Salyut 5 space station was at the standard 51.7° inclination, which led some observers to conclude that this solo Soyuz mission was chiefly intended to observe NATO&#x27;s Exercise Teamwork, taking place in Norway, well above 51.0° latitude and therefore outside good visual range of the space station. However, the particular camera used, an MKF-6 multispectral Carl Zeiss camera which allowed six simultaneous photographs to be taken, suggested to others that reconnaissance, if part of the mission, was a minor part of it. Soyuz 22&#x27;s orbital inclination maximized ground coverage, especially of the former East Germany. There were two orbit changes within 24 hours of launch. The first came on the fourth orbit and changed the orbit to . The second, on the sixteenth orbit, circularized the orbit to .

The mission&#x27;s stated objectives were to &quot;check and improve scientific and technical methods and means of studying geological features of the Earth&#x27;s surface in the interests of the national economies of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic&quot;.

The vehicle was the modified ASTP back-up ship. In place of the APAS-75 androgynous docking system, it carried an East German MKF-6 camera, built by Carl Zeiss-Jena MKF-6 multispectral camera. One cosmonaut would control the operations of the camera from inside the Orbital module while the second changed the orientation from the Descent module. The camera had six lenses, four visible light and two infrared, which imaged a preselected -wide strip of the Earth&#x27;s surface. This allowed over to be imaged in 10 minutes.

The first test images from the camera were of Baikal-Amur railway that was being constructed. On the third day of the mission the crew took photographs of Siberia to the sea of Okhotsk in the morning and the northwestern USSR. On the fourth day, the crew imaged the Moon rising and setting to investigate the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. This also allowed them to see how clean their spacecraft&#x27;s windows were. They also imaged Central Asia, Kazakhstan, and Siberia, with attention to geological formations and agricultural effects. The fifth day focused on Azerbaijan, the southern Urals, the Baikal-Amur railway again, and Western Siberia. At the same time a second camera was being flown on an aircraft over the same areas in order to compare the images. The sixth day saw images of Siberia, the Northern USSR, and European USSR which were, according to TASS, areas that had never before been &quot;targets of space photography&quot;.

The last full day had the crew focus on East Germany, where an Antonov An-30 aircraft was flying carrying an identical camera to the one aboard Soyuz 22. They also re-photographed Central Asia, Kazakhstan, eastern Siberia, and the southwestern USSR in order to compare images with those taken earlier in the mission. One of the tasks the crew undertook was to dismantle the camera in order to remove its color filters needed to calibrate the images back on Earth. The task took them several hours to complete.

The crew also performed several biological experiments. They ran a small centrifuge in the orbital module to see how plants grew in artificial gravity. They also investigated the effects of cosmic rays on human vision. This effect had first been reported by Apollo astronauts who described bright flashes when they closed their eyes. This was due to cosmic rays passing through the eye. Soyuz 22 also carried a small aquarium so that the crew could watch the behavior of fish.

At the end of the mission, the crew took the film cassettes and other items they were returning to Earth and stowed them in the descent module. The retrofire, re-entry, and landing took place without incident on 23 September 1976. The crew had photographed 30 geographic areas in 2400 photographs. None of the cassettes were found to be faulty and all the images were of good quality. The results, it was said, would aid experts in the fields of agriculture, cartography, mineralogy, and hydrology.

<doc id="352842" wikidata="Q352998" url="?curid=352842" title="Roger Douglas">
<text>Sir Roger Owen Douglas (born 5 December 1937) is a retired New Zealand politician, economist and accountant who served as a minister in two Labour governments. He is most recognised for his key involvement in New Zealand&#x27;s radical economic restructuring in the 1980s, when the Fourth Labour Government&#x27;s economic policy became known as &quot;Rogernomics&quot;, which implemented neoliberal economic policies.

Douglas served as a Labour Member of Parliament from 1969 to 1990. During his time as Minister of Finance (1984 to 1988), the government floated the New Zealand dollar, introduced corporate practices to state services, sold off state assets, and removed a swathe of regulations and subsidies. Some Labour Party supporters regarded Douglas&#x27;s economic policies as a betrayal of Labour&#x27;s left-wing policy-platform, and the moves became deeply unpopular with the public and with ordinary party members. His supporters defended the reforms as necessary to revive the economy, which had been tightly regulated under National&#x27;s Robert Muldoon (Minister of Finance from 1975 to 1984). As a result of his flat tax proposal, Douglas came into conflict with Prime Minister David Lange, and he eventually resigned as Finance Minister; when Douglas was re-elected to Cabinet in 1989 Lange himself resigned as Prime Minister, signalling the demise of the Labour government.

In 1993 Douglas and Derek Quigley founded the Association of Consumers and Taxpayers (the forerunner of the ACT New Zealand party) as a means to further his policy ideas. Douglas returned to Parliament as an ACT backbencher in 2008 before retiring in 2011.

== Early life and background ==
Douglas was born on 5 December 1937. His family had strong ties with the trade-union movement, and actively engaged in politics. His grandfather, William Theophilus &quot;Bill&quot; Anderton, (1891–1966), was a left-wing Methodist local preacher and small business owner in Birmingham, England, who migrated to New Zealand with his wife in 1921. Anderton served as MP for Eden from 1935–1946, then as MP for from 1946–1960. He was Minister of Internal Affairs in the 1957–1960 Second Labour Government, establishing the Arts Council. 

Roger Douglas&#x27;s father, Norman Vazey Douglas, (1910–1985), a former trade union secretary, served as MP for from 1960–1975, and as opposition spokesman for labour, education, and social security from 1967–1972. Roger&#x27;s brother Malcolm Douglas was briefly Labour MP for 1978–1979. Douglas grew up in a state house in Ewenson Avenue, One Tree Hill, Auckland. He attended Ellerslie Primary School, excelling in arithmetic and sports. Douglas attended Auckland Grammar School between 1950 and 1955, where he was a prefect and an avid cricket and rugby player. 

Douglas had a summer job at the Auckland accounting firm Mabee, Halstead and Kiddle, accepting a job there at the end of 1952. He gained a degree in accountancy from Auckland University College in 1957. Afterwards, he was hired by Bremworth Carpets in South Auckland as company secretary. He married Glenis June Anderson and moved to Māngere in 1961, becoming President of the Manukau Labour Electorate Committee. He began to run the Bremworth division individually after the company&#x27;s sale to UEB in the mid-1960s. He also served as campaign manager for successful Labour candidate Colin Moyle in 1963.

==Political career==
After some experience in local body politics as a member of the Manukau City Council between 1965 and 1969, where he had been instrumental in the plans to purchase the land where the Manukau City Centre now stands, Douglas began his career in national politics in 1969 when he won election to parliament as the Labour Member of Parliament for Manukau. He gave his maiden speech in the Address-in-Reply debate on 7 April 1970. He devoted the greater part of his speech to the case against foreign investment in the domestic economy. His case for external protection of the domestic economy and government involvement in investment was characteristic of the Labour Party of the time. Douglas became involved in the party&#x27;s policies on industry and economics. He served as the MP for Manukau from 1969 to 1978, and then for Manurewa from 1978 to 1990.

=== Cabinet Minister (1972–1975) ===

Labour under Norman Kirk won the 1972 election, and the Labour parliamentary caucus elevated Douglas, then aged 34, to Cabinet rank. Thus, Douglas became the youngest Cabinet minister in 50 years. His father, and parliamentary colleague, Norman Douglas, then 62, failed to win a place in the ballot for Cabinet, and did not hide his bitter disappointment. On the day of the ballot, Kirk was so concerned by the extremity of Norman Douglas&#x27;s reaction, and its effects on his son, that he called Douglas&#x27;s mother to enlist her help. Kirk told his secretary, &quot;It should have been the best day of Roger&#x27;s life but instead it was the worst&quot;.

During the Third Labour Government, Douglas served as Postmaster-General and Minister of Broadcasting until the unexpected death of Kirk in 1974. Kirk&#x27;s successor Bill Rowling appointed Douglas Minister of Housing. He remained Minister of Broadcasting until 1975, when the portfolio was disestablished. Douglas was Minister of Housing and Minister of Customs until Labour&#x27;s defeat by the National Party under Robert Muldoon in the 1975 election.
Douglas was the most junior member of Cabinet, but soon earned a reputation for hard work and competence. His appointment as Minister of Housing in 1974 marked him publicly as a talent in the Cabinet. It was a significant and, in political terms, a sensitive portfolio.




As Minister of Broadcasting, Douglas devised an administrative framework to allow for the introduction of a second television channel. It replaced the monopoly New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation with two competing publicly owned television channels, Television One, and Television Two (later called South Pacific Television) a corporation to manage public radio, Radio New Zealand, and a new Broadcasting Council. After public consultation, the scheme was implemented on 1 April 1975. However, the government of Muldoon merged the three broadcasters into a single Broadcasting Corporation of New Zealand in 1977, with the two television channels being merged into Television New Zealand in 1980.

Douglas was an early and enthusiastic promoter of the government&#x27;s plans for a compulsory contributory superannuation scheme that would supplement the old age pension. In 1972, while still in opposition, he introduced a private member&#x27;s bill that provided for a form of compulsory superannuation. In Cabinet, Rowling, who was then Minister of Finance, and Douglas were largely responsible for a 1973 White Paper setting out the government&#x27;s proposals for superannuation. As well as augmenting individual provision for retirement, the scheme was intended to be a source of capital for investment in the domestic economy. The scheme became law in the form of the New Zealand Superannuation Act 1974.

Douglas was among the designers of the Dependent Minders&#x27; Allowance, which was part of Labour&#x27;s platform in the 1975 election. Originally intended as a means of compensating women whose absence from the workforce reduced their superannuation contributions, the scheme offered a cash payment to women on the birth of their first and second children, or the first two children born after the election. It was immediately dubbed the &quot;baby bonus&quot; by Muldoon.

Margaret Hayward, who was Norman Kirk&#x27;s private secretary, notes that during the Third Labour Government,
Conversely, Douglas did not attempt radical reform of his other ministerial responsibility, the Post Office, except for an attempt to make the Post Office &#x27;market&#x27; two of its businesses – the Philatelic Bureau and the yellow pages. However, he had little opportunity to do anything else as he was elevated into the role of Minister of Housing after the death of Norman Kirk in 1974.

=== Opposition (1975–1984) ===
Douglas was critical of Labour&#x27;s performance in government between 1972 and 1975. Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 1975 election was the greatest electoral reversal since 1928. A Labour majority of 23 seats in a parliament of 87 members became a National majority of the same number. The Third Labour Government attempted to cushion economic contraction by borrowing abroad, but while it held unemployment to the level it had inherited, the rate of inflation trebled to an annual rate of 15 per cent and a surplus in the balance of payments became a deficit, exacerbated by the 1973 oil crisis. Labour lost credibility as an economic manager by 1975. 

A series of scandals and misadventures, incompetence among some ministers, and Rowling&#x27;s inability to counter Muldoon&#x27;s populism contributed to the defeat. The nature of the defeat widened a division that already existed between the older and younger members of the Labour caucus.

In opposition after 1975, Douglas became successively Labour&#x27;s spokesperson on housing, special projects, consumer affairs and transport. In 1980, he published a series of proposals for future economic development under the title an &quot;Alternative Budget&quot;. The proposals were not Labour policy and their publication was seen by the party leader Rowling as a challenge to his authority. Rowling demoted Douglas from the parliamentary front bench and he lost his responsibility for transport. In 1981, he became spokesperson for trade and industry.

Douglas argued that the Labour Party&#x27;s approach to economic policy was fragmented and based on unrealistic promises. He also believed that the party leadership should be revitalised, and supported David Lange&#x27;s unsuccessful bid for the leadership in 1980. In informal Labour caucus politics, Douglas became a member of the so-called &quot;Fish and Chip Brigade&quot;, which included Rowling&#x27;s leading caucus opponents. He identified his closest colleagues as Richard Prebble, Mike Moore, and Michael Bassett.

The failure of Lange&#x27;s leadership bid, continuing dissatisfaction with Labour&#x27;s approach to economic policy, and his difficult relationship with leading figures in the party led Douglas to declare his intention to retire from Parliament at the 1981 general election. Lange was among those who persuaded him to reconsider. Lange believed that Douglas was a moderniser. He saw Douglas as sometimes obstinate and limited, but in Lange&#x27;s view he had drive, and the ability to break from the traditions that had kept Labour so long in opposition. In March 1983, after Lange became leader of the Labour Party, he made Douglas the Labour spokesperson for finance.

At the time of his appointment, Douglas had a reputation as a radical but his thinking on economic issues remained within the boundaries of Labour&#x27;s Keynesian approach to economic management. By the end of 1983, his thinking had shifted markedly to the economic right.

In late 1983, Labour&#x27;s Caucus Economic Committee adopted a paper that Douglas named the economic policy package. The committee&#x27;s support was not unanimous. The Douglas paper polarised opinion in the caucus. Several members of the caucus presented an alternative draft economic policy to the Labour Party&#x27;s Policy Council. 

The Policy Council was divided. Its members could not agree on the party&#x27;s economic platform. When disagreement became increasingly a matter of public knowledge, and the 1984 general election drew closer, the party&#x27;s deputy leader Geoffrey Palmer drafted a compromise proposal that combined elements of both sides of the argument. Lange doubted that Palmer&#x27;s paper satisfied either side. When Muldoon unexpectedly called an early election, the Palmer document became part of Labour&#x27;s election policy platform.

A critical element of Douglas&#x27;s economic policy package, but not the Labour Party&#x27;s policy document, was a 20 per cent devaluation of the New Zealand dollar. This was a sensitive subject. If it was widely known that an incoming government would devalue the dollar, dealers would seek profit by selling the dollar at its higher price before the election, and buying it back at its lower price afterwards. The difference, which might amount to hundreds of millions of dollars if there was a run on the currency, would be met by the taxpayer. Soon after Muldoon called the election, Douglas held a public meeting in his electorate and distributed copies of his economic policy package, which made the case for a 20 per cent devaluation. Muldoon obtained a copy and released it to the news media, intending to embarrass the Labour Party. Douglas acknowledged that devaluation was not part of Labour policy and accepted responsibility for the mistake. Although Lange believed that the error cast doubt on Douglas&#x27;s judgement, he did not accept Douglas&#x27;s resignation because he did not wish to appoint a new finance spokesperson so close to the election.

===Minister of Finance (1984–1988)===

Labour returned to power in the election of 1984 and formed the Fourth Labour Government. Lange became Prime Minister and Douglas became Minister of Finance. At Douglas&#x27;s request, Lange appointed two senior ministers as associate finance ministers: David Caygill, who was also Minister of Trade and Industry, and Richard Prebble, who was also Minister of Transport. Douglas and his associate ministers became known as the &quot;Treasury Troika&quot; or the &quot;Troika&quot;.

Soon after the election, the outgoing government carried out the devaluation that Douglas supported. The heads of Treasury and the Reserve Bank advised that devaluation was the only way to stop the currency crisis that followed the announcement of an early election.

The unsettled political climate around the early election and the currency crisis gave Douglas a powerful position in the Cabinet. Lange said in 1986 that the economic and political climate in 1984 gave Douglas influence he would not have had if the government had been elected in November 1984 and presented its first budget in June 1985. &quot;When the crisis hit in July 1984, it was Roger Douglas who, above all, had thought through the economic issues – so when the Cabinet needed to fall back on an economic philosophy, it was Douglas who had one.&quot;

Labour promised during the election campaign to &quot;open the books&quot;, largely as a challenge to Muldoon&#x27;s supposedly secretive and ad hoc approach to economic management. Douglas responded by agreeing to the publication of Treasury&#x27;s briefing to the incoming government, which appeared under the title &quot;Economic Management&quot;.

Douglas took a limited part in the Economic Summit Conference that began on 11 September 1984 because he was already at work on his first budget. He saw the summit as preparing the country to accept change, but noted the possibility that it might heighten expectations of continued consensus and involvement. He later stated that he had taken up the finance portfolio with a plan for economic restructuring already in mind, and described the budget he delivered in November 1984 as &quot;an amalgam of what I had originally envisaged and fresh options presented in briefing papers and in debate with fellow ministers and Treasury officials.&quot;

Douglas&#x27;s insistence that economic policy was the product of a plan conceived by him as early as 1980 and not a response to crisis left the government open to charges of bad faith.

The 1984 budget was a radical departure from Labour&#x27;s established approach to economic management. Douglas answered criticism that the government&#x27;s intentions had not been made clear to the electorate by saying that he had spelled out his whole programme to the Policy Council, which, he said, had understood and endorsed his intentions. He maintained that the detail was not made available to the public because it did not have the capacity to absorb it in the short time available.

The budget owed almost nothing to Labour&#x27;s manifesto. Its content closely matched the Treasury view set out in &quot;Economic Management&quot;. Douglas&#x27;s identification with Treasury was complete by 1985. Treasury initiatives adopted by the government that were not signalled before the 1984 election included the introduction of a comprehensive tax on consumption (GST), the floating of the dollar (which Douglas opposed until 1984) and the corporatisation of the government&#x27;s trading activities, announced at the end of 1985.

Treasury&#x27;s view of economic policy was neoclassical and monetarist, and used commercial criteria as the basis for decision-making. Douglas did not concede that his advocacy of these views placed him on the right of the political spectrum. He maintained that the government&#x27;s social goals were the same as those of the First Labour Government and that changed circumstances required Labour to use different economic means to achieve its ends. He defended Treasury from the charge that its advice was at odds with Labour policy by arguing that its role was to give advice based on the interests of the nation as a whole. In his view, Treasury had no duty to help a government implement its manifesto because its responsibility was to advise its minister in a way that was free of party politics or ideology.

The coinage &quot;Rogernomics&quot; was used from at least 1985 onwards as shorthand for the Fourth Labour Government&#x27;s economic reform policies. Douglas&#x27;s public profile rose, and he built wide support for the government among the business community.

Douglas was reappointed to the finance portfolio after Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1987 general election and remained finance minister until December 1988. His second term in office was marked by conflict with the prime minister Lange.

===Lange and Douglas (1984–1989)===
The conflict between Lange and Douglas mirrored the inconsistency at the heart of the government. Lange&#x27;s talk of consensus and inclusiveness during the 1984 general election campaign echoed Labour&#x27;s social-democratic history. Douglas personified radical change.

Lange strongly supported the 1984 budget, and promoted it to party and public. Douglas and Lange were a formidable political combination, both in Cabinet and in public, where Lange&#x27;s humour and rhetoric complemented the determination and single-mindedness embodied in Douglas&#x27;s commitment to economic restructuring.

Lange valued Douglas&#x27;s doggedness in the government&#x27;s first term of office, when &quot;urgency was needed and boldness was at a premium&quot;, but believed he was limited by an inability to accept or understand interests that were not in tune with his. In 1986, the two took opposing sides in Cabinet debates about the establishment of a royal commission on social policy, which Lange saw as an intellectual counterweight to Treasury. At the beginning of 1987, relations between the Douglas and Lange offices were strained when Douglas and his ally Richard Prebble persuaded Cabinet to reject Lange&#x27;s wish to accept the resignation of the Minister of Māori Affairs, Koro Wētere, following the Māori loan affair.

Douglas shocked Lange in April 1987 by telling him that his preferred option for the 1987 budget included a rise in GST from a rate of 10% to 15%, the extension of user charges in public health and education and the sale of most government assets, and the eventual achievement of a flat rate of income tax at 15 per cent. Lange wrote that &quot;it was an unaccustomed addition to the burdens of office to have the finance minister take leave of his senses&quot;. After discussions with Lange and senior colleagues, Douglas did not pursue his proposals.

In the 1987 election campaign, Douglas underlined the need for continuing radical reform, while Lange said that radical economic reform was largely complete. Douglas&#x27;s appeal to commercial interests was reflected in the large amounts of money (including $250,000 given by Auckland businessman Alan Hawkins) he collected for the campaign from the business community. He did not convey the money he raised to the Labour Party organisation, but chose to manage it himself, allocating funds for purposes like television advertising.

Lange&#x27;s campaign was lacklustre, and Douglas appeared to have contributed more to Labour&#x27;s victory in 1987. Mike Moore, then a senior member of Cabinet, said that Lange had won the 1984 election, but Douglas won in 1987. Labour increased its parliamentary majority. Votes swung to Labour in National&#x27;s safest seats and swung to National in seats that traditionally voted Labour.

Immediately after the election, Lange reshuffled the Cabinet without consulting Douglas. He wrote later that he no longer trusted Douglas and wished to use the reallocation of portfolios to put some restraints on him.

Douglas continued to work on the radical proposals he signaled earlier in 1987. A worldwide fall in share markets in October 1987 gave his work greater urgency. In December 1987, the Cabinet agreed, in spite of Lange&#x27;s reservations, to a statement of principle that supported a flat rate of income tax and a new form of income assistance called guaranteed minimum family income (GMFI). GMFI was a Douglas initiative and for reasons of urgency he did not inform colleagues of Treasury advice that the proposals were a fiscal risk.

The announcement on 17 December 1987 of the government&#x27;s intention to introduce GMFI and a flat rate of income tax marked the high tide of Rogernomics but did nothing to settle growing tension between Douglas and Lange. Douglas refused to accept Lange&#x27;s contention that his proposals were unworkable. Douglas was in Europe in January 1988 when Lange told a press conference that officials had been unable to resolve the practical difficulties of the flat tax/GMFI proposals and that the government would have to reconsider them. Douglas, believing that he had the support of a majority of Cabinet, immediately returned from Europe, and the rift between prime minister and finance minister became a matter of public knowledge.

Although Cabinet abandoned GMFI and reached a compromise about tax scales, the government&#x27;s standing did not recover from the division between Douglas and Lange, which worsened and became more open as the year went on. Lange believed that David Caygill was Douglas&#x27;s only tenable successor as finance minister, but Caygill refused to serve if Lange sacked Douglas. In December 1988, Douglas wrote to Lange to tell him that he intended to tell the Labour caucus he could no longer serve in a government led by him. Lange construed this letter as a resignation and replaced Douglas with Caygill.

In August and September 1988, some Labour Party members founded the Backbone club, a ginger group within the party that support Douglas in his financial reforms. Douglas himself continued his campaign against Lange through public statements, the unauthorised release of cabinet papers and on 21 December 1988 an unsuccessful challenge against Lange&#x27;s leadership in the Labour caucus. In June 1989 his supporters in caucus moved a motion of no-confidence in Lange, which Lange only narrowly won. On 3 August 1989, the Labour caucus voted to return Douglas to Cabinet. Lange, who saw the vote as a choice between him and Douglas, resigned his office almost immediately afterwards.

Lange insisted that policy differences were behind his disagreement with Douglas, telling a press conference following his resignation that &quot;Now is the time for the principle to replace the personality&quot;. He was critical of Douglas&#x27;s conduct: &quot;But with Roger his resolution, and his particular absolutely relentless pursuit of what he conceived to be an agenda worth pursuing, overrode all considerations of loyalty and in the end all manifestations of friendship.&quot; Douglas did not accept that there were any philosophical differences at issue, and attributed other motives to Lange: &quot;In my mind he created the division that in my mind was never there. We had separate roles. I understood what my role was. I felt he should have understood what his role was.&quot;

Lange&#x27;s successor Geoffrey Palmer did not restore Douglas to the finance portfolio, then held by David Caygill, but appointed him Minister of Police and Minister of Immigration. Douglas did not stand for Parliament at the 1990 election, which Labour lost. His policies, however, continued under the aegis of Ruth Richardson, the Minister of Finance in the new Fourth National Government of New Zealand (in a style that became known as &quot;Ruthanasia&quot;).

===ACT New Zealand===

In 1993, Douglas co-founded the Association of Consumers and Taxpayers with Derek Quigley. Douglas and Quigley intended the Association to serve as a pressure-group promoting the Douglas economic policies. Shortly afterwards, in 1996, the country switched to using the MMP electoral system. MMP gave smaller parties a much better chance of entering Parliament, and encouraged the Association to establish the ACT New Zealand Party. The nascent party&#x27;s manifesto was based upon a book written by Douglas entitled &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. Douglas served as ACT&#x27;s first leader, but soon stood aside for Richard Prebble (his old ally from their days in the Labour caucus).

Douglas remained a strong supporter of ACT, although he became somewhat unhappy with the party&#x27;s alleged lack of focus on pure economic policy. In particular, Douglas criticised what he saw as populism within the party, claiming that some of its MPs seemed more committed to grabbing headlines than to developing policy. When in April 2004 Prebble announced his decision to retire, Douglas spoke out in favour of Stephen Franks and Ken Shirley as possible successors – the other main contender in the leadership race, Rodney Hide, had a reputation for advocating the style that Douglas condemned. Hide won the leadership and headed ACT until his resignation in April 2011.

On 2 December 2004, both Douglas and Quigley announced that they would step down as patrons of ACT. They stated as the reason that they wished to have more freedom to disagree with the party publicly.

On 21 February 2008, Douglas renewed his involvement with ACT by signing a letter inviting supporters to the 2008 ACT conference, and appearing in television and newspaper interviews endorsing ACT for the 2008 general election. At ACT&#x27;s 2008 annual conference in Auckland, Douglas announced his intention to stand for Parliament again, as an ACT candidate. The announcement that he would run in the newly created electorate of came on 8 June 2008.
ACT assigned Douglas the number three slot on its party list.

Douglas finished a distant third in Hunua, taking only 9.6 percent of the vote. However, ACT leader Rodney Hide was reelected as the member for Epsom, allowing ACT to enter Parliament under MMP. A party that falls below the five-percent threshold can still qualify for MMP if it wins at least one electorate seat. ACT&#x27;s 3.65 percent of the party vote entitled it to five seats, allowing Douglas to re-enter Parliament as a list MP. ACT gave confidence and supply to National. Prime Minister-elect John Key had previously said that he would not give Douglas a Cabinet position, but Douglas indicated a wish for a review of this stance.

As a government backbencher, Douglas had three member&#x27;s bills drawn from the ballot in 2010. The first, the Minimum Wage (Mitigation of Youth Unemployment) Amendment Bill, which would reintroduce a separate minimum wage for 16- and 17-year-olds was drawn from the member&#x27;s ballot in February, and was defeated at its first reading 117–5. The second, the Tariff Act 1988 Repeal Bill, which would repeal all tariffs on goods imported into New Zealand, was drawn in April, and was also defeated at its first reading 116–5 The third, the Education (Board of Trustee Freedom) Amendment Bill, which would make school teachers&#x27; pay in all state and state integrated schools the responsibility of Boards of Trustees rather than the Ministry of Education was drawn in June, and was defeated on its first reading 111–10.

On 18 February 2011, Douglas announced that he would retire at the end of the 49th New Zealand Parliament. On 29 September, he delivered his valedictory speech in Parliament.

== Career outside politics ==
In early 1992, Douglas gave a schedule of speeches on economics in Russia, which was transitioning from a command economy to free-market capitalism, as part of a privatisation advisory committee organised by the World Bank. Later in 1992, Douglas was appointed to the inaugural board of the Auckland Warriors by the Auckland Rugby League. He later served as chairman before being replaced in 1996.

During his absence from national politics, Douglas held senior positions at a number of prominent companies, such as Ron Brierley&#x27;s BIL, which he briefly served as Executive Chairman. He also served as the managing director of Roger Douglas Associates, an international consulting firm.

==Honours and awards==
In 1977, Douglas was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal, and in 1990 he received the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 1991 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Knight Bachelor, for public services.

== Legacy ==
In 1997, in a back-handed compliment, the founders of the annual award for &quot;The Worst Transnational Corporation operating in New Zealand&quot;, as voted by &quot;four or five eminent judges – academics, community leaders, artists, even sportspeople&quot;, named it the &quot;Roger Award&quot; after Douglas.

Douglas and his policies were and remain controversial and polarising. His supporters contend that he was responsible for rejuvenating the New Zealand economy while his opponents argue that Rogernomics was responsible for a vast increase in inequality between rich and poor, among other things.

Helen Clark, a later Labour Prime Minister, denounced Rogernomics as &quot;a ghastly period&quot; and led Labour back into power by abandoning its legacy. However, political analysts suggest that she did not significantly alter the paradigm created by Rogernomics. By and large, governments since the 1980s have retained or reinforced the policies promoted by Douglas in the years 1984 to 1987, including low levels of import-protection, &quot;credible&quot; monetary and fiscal policies, deregulated financial markets and limited subsidies and other interventions in the economy.
