<text>Luis Ernesto Aparicio Montiel (born April 29, 1934), nicknamed &quot;Little Louie&quot;, is a Venezuelan former professional baseball player. He played in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a shortstop from 1956 to 1973 for three American League (AL) teams, most prominently the Chicago White Sox. During his ten seasons with the team, he became known for his exceptional defensive and base-stealing skills. A 13-time All-Star, he made an immediate impact with the team, winning the Rookie of the Year Award in 1956 after leading the league in stolen bases and leading AL shortstops in putouts and assists; he was the first Latin American player to win the award.

From 1956 to 1962, Aparicio and second baseman Nellie Fox formed one of the most revered double play duos in major league history. As the team&#x27;s leadoff hitter and defensive star, he provided a spark to the &quot;Go-Go&quot; White Sox, helping to lead them to their first pennant in 40 years in 1959, finishing second to Fox in the Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting. His 56 stolen bases that season were more than twice as many as any other major league player, and the most by any player in 16 years; he tied the White Sox club record, with the mark not being surpassed until 1983. Aparicio led the AL in stolen bases a record nine consecutive seasons to begin his career, becoming the first player since the 1920s to steal 50 bases four times. Traded to the Baltimore Orioles before the 1963 season, he set a franchise record with 57 steals in 1964, then played a major role in helping the club to its first World Series title in 1966. Aparicio won nine Gold Glove Awards, setting a league record since matched only by Omar Vizquel; he led the AL in fielding percentage eight consecutive years, and in assists seven times, putouts four times and double plays twice, and in 1960 became the first AL shortstop in 25 years to post 550 assists.

When he retired, Aparicio ranked second to Ty Cobb in AL history in career at bats (10,230), fifth in games played (2,599) and seventh in singles (2,108); his 506 stolen bases trailed only Cobb and Eddie Collins among AL players. He set major league records for career hits and total bases as a shortstop that were later broken by Derek Jeter and Cal Ripken Jr. respectively. His 2,581 games as a shortstop were a major league record until 2008, and the AL record until 2014. He held the major league records for career assists (8,016) and double plays (1,553) until Ozzie Smith passed him in 1994 and 1995; he still holds the AL records for assists, putouts (4,548), and total chances (12,930), though Ripken broke his AL double play mark in 1996. Aparicio&#x27;s career fielding percentage (.972) ranked second in AL history when he retired, one point behind Lou Boudreau. Legendary hitter Ted Williams called Aparicio &quot;the best shortstop he had ever seen&quot;. He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, the first Venezuelan player to be so honored.

==Early life==
Aparicio was born in Maracaibo, Zulia State, Venezuela. His father, Luis Aparicio Sr., was a notable shortstop in Venezuela and owned a Winter League team with Aparicio&#x27;s uncle, Ernesto Aparicio. At the age of 19, Aparicio was selected as a member of the Venezuelan national team in the 1953 Amateur World Series held in Caracas; Venezuela took the silver medal in the tournament. He signed to play for the local professional team in Maracaibo alongside his father in 1953. In a symbolic gesture during the team&#x27;s 1953 home opener, his father led off as the first hitter of the game, took the first pitch, and had Aparicio Jr. take his place at bat.

==Major league career==

===Chicago White Sox (1956–1962)===
The Cleveland Indians had been negotiating to sign Aparicio, but Indians General Manager Hank Greenberg expressed the opinion that he was too small to play in the major leagues. Chicago White Sox general manager Frank Lane, on the recommendation of fellow Venezuelan shortstop Chico Carrasquel, then signed Aparicio for $5,000 down and $5,000 in first-year salary. After only two years in the minor leagues, he made his major league debut at the age of 22, replacing Carrasquel as the White Sox shortstop in 1956. Aparicio would lead the American League in stolen bases, assists and putouts, and won both the AL Rookie of the Year and &quot;The Sporting News&quot; Rookie of the Year awards. He was the first Latin American player to win the Rookie of the Year Award.

Aparicio quickly became an integral member of the Go-Go White Sox teams of the mid-1950s, who were known for their speed and strong defense. Over the next decade, Aparicio set the standard for the spray-hitting, slick-fielding, speedy shortstop. He combined with second baseman Nellie Fox to become one of the best double play combinations in the major leagues. Aparicio once again led the AL in stolen bases and assists in 1957 as the White Sox held first place until late June before finishing the season in second place behind the New York Yankees. On September 7 against the Kansas City Athletics, he hit two home runs for the only time in his career, leading off the game with an inside-the-park home run and adding a three-run shot in the 4th inning as the White Sox won 8-2.

In 1958, Aparicio earned recognition as one of the top shortstops in the major leagues when he was selected to be the AL&#x27;s starting shortstop in the All-Star Game. The White Sox once again finished the season in second place behind the Yankees, after being in last place on June 14. Aparicio again led the league in stolen bases, assists and putouts, and won his first Gold Glove Award.

Aparicio was the team leader when the &quot;Go-Go&quot; White Sox won the AL pennant in 1959, finishing the regular season five games ahead of the Cleveland Indians. After stealing 56 bases to tie Wally Moses&#x27; 1943 team record, he was runner-up to Fox in the Most Valuable Player Award balloting. Aparicio was selected as a starting All-Star for the second time and also won a second Gold Glove Award. He posted a .308 batting average in the 1959 World Series as the White Sox were defeated by the Los Angeles Dodgers in a six-game series. The White Sox record stood until Rudy Law stole 77 bases in 1983. When Aparicio stole 50 bases in his first 61 attempts in 1959, the term &quot;Aparicio double&quot; was coined to represent a walk and a stolen base. Since the 2019 death of teammate Johnny Romano, Aparicio has been the last surviving player to play with the White Sox in the 1959 World Series.

In 1960 and 1961, Aparicio continued to be one of the top shortstops in the league, finishing at or near the top in fielding percentage and assists. His 1960 total of 551 assists was the highest in the major leagues since 1943, and the highest AL total since White Sox star Luke Appling recorded 556 in 1935; the last season above 550 previous to that had been in 1911. In 1962, Aparicio showed up overweight and had an off year, and the White Sox offered him a reduction in salary for the 1963 season. An enraged Aparicio said that he would quit rather than accept a decrease in pay and demanded to be traded. The White Sox eventually traded him to the Baltimore Orioles with Al Smith for Hoyt Wilhelm, Ron Hansen, Dave Nicholson and Pete Ward in January 1963.

===Baltimore Orioles (1963–1967)===

Aparicio regained his form in Baltimore and continued to lead the league in stolen bases and in fielding percentage, producing a career-high .983 fielding percentage in 1963. Together with Brooks Robinson and Jerry Adair, he was part of one of the better defensive infields in baseball. In 1964, he led the league in stolen bases for a ninth consecutive year, with his 57 steals breaking George Sisler&#x27;s franchise record of 51 set with the 1922 St. Louis Browns, and won his sixth Gold Glove Award. Aparicio posted a .276 batting average with 182 hits in 1966, tied with teammate Frank Robinson for the second-most hits in the league behind Tony Oliva and won a seventh Gold Glove Award as the Orioles clinched their first American League pennant. He finished ninth in the MVP balloting, in which teammates took the top three spots, and helped the Orioles sweep the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1966 World Series.

===Return to White Sox (1968–1970)===
With the emergence of Mark Belanger at shortstop, Aparicio was traded back to the White Sox along with Russ Snyder and John Matias for Don Buford, Bruce Howard and Roger Nelson on November 29, 1967. He continued to play well defensively, leading the league in range factor in 1968 and 1969. On May 15, 1969, he picked up his 2,000th hit in a 10-inning, 2-1 loss in Detroit. Aparicio had his best overall offensive season in 1970, scoring 86 runs and finishing fourth in the AL batting race with a career-high .313 average. In addition, he earned his eighth All-Star berth that year, as well as his ninth Gold Glove. On September 25, in the first game of a doubleheader against the Milwaukee Brewers, Aparicio broke Luke Appling&#x27;s record of 2,218 games at shortstop as the White Sox won 5-1; it was his last game of the season. Despite the White Sox finishing in last place, Aparicio finished 12th in the MVP balloting.

===Boston Red Sox (1971–1973)===
After three seasons with the White Sox, Aparicio was traded to the Boston Red Sox for Luis Alvarado and Mike Andrews on December 1, 1970. In 1971, Aparicio had a career-high six runs batted in (RBI) on April 10 against the Indians in Cleveland, hitting a 2nd-inning grand slam followed by a 2-run double in the seventh inning. In late May, he was one at bat from tying the longest major league hitless streak for non-pitchers, held by Bill Bergen with 45 in 1909 with the Brooklyn Superbas, by going without a hit in 44 at bats. He ended the streak with a 2nd-inning single against the Kansas City Royals on June 1. During the season, he broke Appling&#x27;s record of 1,424 career double plays. He hit only .232 for the year, the second-lowest average in his career.

In 1972, Aparicio broke Appling&#x27;s major league record of 3,328 total bases as a shortstop, and Bill Dahlen&#x27;s record of 7,505 assists; he also made his 2,500th hit on August 15 in a 3-0 road win over the Texas Rangers. However, he also made a late-season baserunning blunder that contributed to the Red Sox losing the 1972 American League Eastern Division title by a half-game to the Detroit Tigers. In an October 2 game against Detroit, Aparicio fell while rounding third base on an apparent triple by Carl Yastrzemski, leading to Yastrzemski being tagged out as he tried to retreat to second base. In his last year as an active player in 1973, Aparicio hit for a .271 average and stole his 500th base, against the New York Yankees on July 5. He also broke Appling&#x27;s major league record of 2,594 hits as a shortstop. Aparicio retired at the end of the season at the age of 39.

==Career statistics==
Aparicio played for 18 major league seasons in 2,599 games, accumulating 2,677 hits in 10,230 at bats for a .262 career batting average along with 394 doubles, 83 home runs, 791 runs batted in, 1,335 runs and 506 stolen bases. He ended his career with a .972 fielding percentage. Aparicio led AL shortstops eight times in fielding percentage, seven times in assists, and four times in range factor and putouts. He led the league in stolen bases in nine consecutive seasons (1956–1964) and won the Gold Glove Award nine times (1958–1962, 1964, 1966, 1970). Aparicio was also a ten-time All-Star (1958–1964, 1970–1972); he was named to 13 out of 14 All-Star Games (two All-Star Games were held from 1959 through 1962), was the starting shortstop in six All-Star games and played in 10 games (he didn&#x27;t play in the second All-Star game in 1960 and was injured and replaced in the 1964 and 1972 games and didn&#x27;t play).
At the time of his retirement, Aparicio was the all-time leader for games played, assists and double plays by a shortstop and the all-time leader for putouts and total chances by an American League shortstop. His nine Gold Glove Awards set an AL record for shortstops that was tied by Omar Vizquel in 2001. He tied the record of most seasons leading the league in fielding average by shortstops with 8, previously set by Everett Scott and Lou Boudreau.

His 2,583 games played at shortstop stood as the major league record from his retirement in 1973 until May 2008, when it was surpassed by Omar Vizquel. His 2,677 hits was also the major league record for players from Venezuela, until it was surpassed by Vizquel in 2009. His 2,673 hits as a shortstop were a record until Derek Jeter broke it on August 17, 2009. He had 13 consecutive seasons with enough plate appearances to qualify for the batting title and an on-base percentage less than .325, a major league record (his career OBP was slightly better than the shortstop average during his era; .311 vs .309). A more impressive streak was his 16 straight seasons with more than 500 plate appearances, tied for fifth best in major league history. Aparicio never played any defensive position other than shortstop.

==Awards and honors==

Aparicio was inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, the first native of Venezuela to be honored. The White Sox also retired Aparicio&#x27;s uniform number 11 that year. In 2010, the White Sox gave number 11 to shortstop Omar Vizquel, with Aparicio&#x27;s permission. Vizquel said that wearing the number would preserve the name of a great Venezuelan shortstop. Aparicio commented, &quot;If there is one player who I would like to see wear my uniform number with the White Sox, it is Omar Vizquel. I have known Omar for a long time. Along with being an outstanding player, he is a good and decent man.&quot;

In 1981, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Aparicio in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. In 1999, &quot;The Sporting News&quot; did not include him on their list of The Sporting News list of Baseball&#x27;s 100 Greatest Players, but Major League Baseball did include him that year as one of eight shortstops nominated for their All-Century Team.

The 2001 Major League Baseball All-Star Game was dedicated jointly to Aparacio, Orlando Cepeda, Juan Marichal, and Tony Perez. Along with Ferguson Jenkins, they threw out the ceremonial first pitch to end the player introduction ceremonies.

In 2003, Aparicio was inducted into the Venezuelan Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum. In 2004, the first annual Luis Aparicio Award was presented to the Venezuelan player who recorded the best individual performance in Major League Baseball, as voted on by sports journalists in Venezuela.

He threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Game 1 of the 2005 World Series, the first World Series game to be played in Chicago by the White Sox since the 1959 World Series, when Aparicio had been their starting shortstop.

In honor of Aparicio&#x27;s stealing abilities, a walk and a stolen base was known as an &quot;Aparicio double&quot;

In 2006, two bronze statues depicting Aparicio and former White Sox second baseman Nellie Fox were unveiled on the outfield concourse of U.S. Cellular Field in Chicago. Fox&#x27;s statue shows him flipping a baseball toward Aparicio, while Aparicio&#x27;s statue shows him preparing to receive the ball from Fox. Artist Gary Tillery sculpted the statue of Aparicio.

In 2007, Aparicio was inducted into the Hispanic Heritage Baseball Museum Hall of Fame.

There is a stadium in Maracaibo, Venezuela, bearing his father&#x27;s name. The full name of the stadium is Estadio Luis Aparicio El Grande (Luis Aparicio &quot;the Great&quot; Stadium) in honor to Luis Aparicio Ortega. Also, the sports complex where the stadium is located is named Polideportivo Luis Aparicio Montiel. There are also several streets and avenues bearing his name throughout Venezuela.

In 2015, Empresas Polar and Fenix Media released a documentary, &quot;Thirty Years of Immortality&quot;, which features testimonials from many major leaguers, friends, and family, on the day that Aparicio was announced as being voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Director Isaac Bencid said, &quot;It was a good time to honor Mr. Aparicio because it was the first time he had a documentary made of his life. I want to make people know in Venezuela. I think sometimes that you in the United States know more about Mr. Aparicio than many Venezuelans. Baseball is very important down there but a lot of young people in Venezuela don&#x27;t know Mr. Aparicio. What we want to do is honor him and make people know about him.&quot;

Following the death of Willie Mays on June 18, 2024, Aparicio has been the oldest living Baseball Hall of Famer.

<text>Rauf Raif Denktaş (27 January 1924 – 13 January 2012) was a Turkish Cypriot politician, barrister and jurist who served as the founding president of Northern Cyprus. He occupied this position as the president of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus between the declaration of the &quot;de facto&quot; state by Denktaş in 1983 and 2005, as the president of the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus between 1975 and 1983 and as the president of the Autonomous Turkish Cypriot Administration between 1974 and 1975. He was also elected in 1973 as the vice-president of the Republic of Cyprus.

== Early life and career ==
Denktaş was born in Paphos to Turkish Cypriot parents, judge Raif Mehmet Bey and Emine Hanim. He graduated from The English School, Nicosia in Cyprus. Following his graduation he worked as a translator in Famagusta after that as a court clerk and then as a teacher for one year in the English School. He later went to Istanbul and London, training first as a teacher and then as a barrister at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. He graduated in 1947 and returned home to practice law.

In 1948 Denktaş served as a member of the Consultative Assembly in search of self-government for Cyprus and became a member of the Turkish Affairs Committee. He was a crown prosecutor 1949–1958.

== 1957–1999 ==
In 1957, Denktaş played the lead role in the founding of the Turkish Resistance Organization (TMT), which was formed to resist EOKA&#x27;s struggle to proclaim Enosis (union with Greece) and worked for the partition of Cyprus. In 1958, he attended the U.N. General Assembly on behalf of the Turkish-Cypriots, and in December of that year he advised the Turkish Government on the rights of Turkish Cypriots during the preparation of the London and Zurich Agreements (signed 19 February 1959). In 1960, Cyprus won independence from Britain, and the Republic of Cyprus was established. Denktaş was elected as the President of the Turkish Communal Chamber.

In November 1963 President Makarios gave for review to Turkey, Greece and Britain a document with a series of constitutional amendments designed to loosen the acquired rights of Turkish Cypriots in the name of &quot;the workings of the state&quot;. Then the paramilitary action against the Turks began in December 1963, after which Turkish-Cypriots forcefully withdrew from government. Upon these events, Denktaş went to Ankara for consultations with the Turkish government. His reentry to the island was prohibited by the Greek-Cypriot leadership in years 1964–68 due to his involvement with TMT. In the 1973 vice presidential elections he replaced Fazıl Küçük.

After the 15 July 1974 Greek ultra-nationalist military coup in Cyprus, fearing for the safety of the Turkish Cypriot population, Turkey unilaterally invaded by landing troops on the north coast of Cyprus. During the military operation, the dictatorship led by Nikos Sampson fell and political wrangling began. After three weeks, Turkey continued to advance military operation. The Turkish Army took control of 37% of the island by the time it completed its second advance on 14 August 1974 and reached Famagusta. Denktaş was subsequently elected speaker of the legislature in 1975, and then President of the Turkish Federated State of Cyprus in 1976 and for a second term in 1981.

He played a key role in the 1983 Unilateral Declaration of Independence of the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus, and was elected as the President of the TRNC in 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000.

The TRNC has not been recognised by any state other than Turkey. Denktaş had been the chief negotiator of Turkish Cypriots in the United Nations sponsored peace talks since 1968.

== Later career ==
By 2000, the desire of both Cyprus and Turkey to join the European Union led to renewed efforts to reach a settlement. In 2002 there were large demonstrations in northern Cyprus by Turkish Cypriots demanding reunification of the island, which would give them EU citizenship when Cyprus joined the EU in 2004.

In February 2004 Denktaş embarked on a new round of UN sponsored talks with the Greek Cypriots, aimed at re-uniting Cyprus. Ultimately, as did the Greek Cypriot President Tassos Papadopoulos, he opposed the final version of the settlement proposal drafted under the authority of the UN Secretary General Kofi Annan (the Annan Plan), which was voted on by the two Cypriot communities in a referendum on 24 April 2004. The plan was accepted by 65% of the Turkish community, but was rejected by a vast majority of the Greeks.

On 14 May 2004, Denktaş announced he would not be standing for a fifth term as President of the TRNC in the next election. His tenure as President came to an end following the 17 April 2005 election of Mehmet Ali Talat, who formally assumed office on 25 April.

== Personal life and awards ==
Denktaş&#x27;s favourite pastimes included photography and writing. His photographs have been exhibited in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Italy, some of the former republics of the Soviet Union, Poland, France, Austria and Turkey. He has written about fifty books in English and Turkish. Between the years 1949 and 1957 he wrote many articles for the newspaper &quot;Halkın Sesi&quot; (&quot;Voice of the People&quot;), published by Fazıl Küçük, the first Vice President of the Republic of Cyprus.

Denktaş has been the recipient of many awards and honorary doctorates given by various universities in Turkey, Northern Cyprus and the United States. He was married to Aydın Denktaş (1933–2019) for 63 years and had three sons and three daughters. He lost a daughter at the age of three, one son, Raif in a traffic accident and another son in a tonsillectomy. His surviving son Serdar Denktaş is also a politician, and as of 2019, leader of the Turkish Cypriot Democratic Party.

== Illness, death and funeral ==

Denktaş&#x27;s health gradually deteriorated throughout the 2000s. He had a heart condition and on 25 May 2011 suffered a stroke. He died on 13 January 2012 of multiple organ failure at the Near East University Hospital in Nicosia. Northern Cyprus declared seven days&#x27; mourning, while Turkey declared five days&#x27;. His funeral was held on 17 January, with thousands of attendees. He was buried in the Cumhuriyet Park (&quot;Park of the Republic&quot;).

<text>Urban planning in the Soviet Bloc countries during the Cold War era was dictated by ideological, political, social as well as economic motives. Unlike the urban development in the Western countries, Soviet-style planning often called for the complete redesigning of cities.

This thinking was reflected in the urban design of all communist countries. Most socialist systems exercised a form of centrally controlled development and simplified methods of construction already outlined in the Soviet guidelines at the end of the Stalinist period. The communist planning resulted in the virtually identical city blocks being erected across many nations, even if there were differences in the specifics between each country.

Soviet-style cities are often traced to Modernist ideas in architecture such as those of Le Corbusier and his plans for Paris. The housing developments generally feature tower blocks in park-like settings, standardized and mass-produced using structural insulated panels within a short period of time.

==Beginnings of urban planning in communist countries==

Many eastern European countries had suffered physical damage during World War II and their economies were in a very poor state. There was a need to reconstruct cities which had been severely damaged due to the war. For example, Warsaw, Poland, had been practically razed to the ground under the planned destruction of Warsaw by German forces after the 1944 Warsaw Uprising. The centre of Dresden, Germany, had been totally destroyed by the 1945 Allied bombardment. Stalingrad had been largely destroyed and only a small number of structures were left standing.

The financial resources of eastern European countries, after nationalization of industry and land, were under total government control. All development and investment had to be financed by the state. In line with their commitment to communism, the first priority was building industry.

Therefore, for the first ten to fifteen years, most resources were directed towards the development of industry and the reconstruction of destroyed cities. In most cases, this reconstruction was executed without any urban planning for several reasons. Firstly, reconstruction had to start immediately as there was not enough time to develop a detailed plan. Secondly, the man-power and expertise for developing urban plans in great numbers were not available.

Oftentimes, destroyed cites were not rebuilt as they were before. Rather, entirely new cities were constructed along the principles of Soviet Socialism. However, the historically significant structures in some large cities were rebuilt. Experts worked to make the restoration resemble the original as much as possible. For example, the old city centre in Warsaw, the Zwinger in Dresden, and many historic buildings in Budapest were restored to their pre-war beauty.

A notable exception is the building of the National Theatre of Bucharest, Romania, which was damaged by bombing in August 1944. Though part of the building was still standing, after taking complete power in 1947, the communist authorities decided to tear down the remains of the building.

In the late 1940s, the USSR developed a new type of high-rise. The first such buildings were built in Moscow: Moscow State University, Kotelnicheskaya Embankment Building, Kudrinskaya Square Building, Hilton Moscow Leningradskaya Hotel, Hotel Ukraina, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Heavy Industry. These were duplicated in some other countries, the main examples being the Palace of Culture and Science in Warsaw and the House of the Free Press in Bucharest. The Stalin Allee (subsequently named Karl-Marx-Allee) in East Berlin was also flanked by buildings having the same Stalinist style, though their concept was different from the Moscow high-rises. These buildings are mainly examples of a new architectural style, but did not involve urban planning to a significant extent, and there is no visible conceptual link between these buildings and their neighborhood.

Construction of these buildings required the demolition of the structures which were located on their sites. The most notorious was the demolition of the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, erected in Moscow as a memorial of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat. The site was required for the Palace of the Soviets, which was never built. The demolition of historic buildings, especially churches, to make way for the new communist structures was a general trait of communist urbanism. A more recent example was the Demolition of historical parts of Bucharest by Nicolae Ceauşescu who aimed to rebuild the capital in a socialist realist style.

In other cases, the Soviets preserved historic structures and attempted to erase their non-Soviet significance; instead, they focused on aesthetics and perceived beauty. For example, the Vilnius Cathedral was repurposed as an art museum after the Soviet Union retook Lithuania in 1944. Additionally, the names of streets in Vilnius were changed to more closely reflect Soviet values. Over time, the city began to expand, and in the 1978 Master Plan for Vilnius, new districts were proposed, most of which were residential. New private housing was prohibited from the city center and the old town.

Industrialization brought more people from rural areas to the cities. As few new housing units were built immediately after the war, an already severe housing shortages became worse. Eventually, chronic housing shortages and overcrowding required an extensive program of new construction. As a result, most communist countries adopted the solution used in the USSR which included strict limits on the living space to which each person was entitled. Generally, each person was entitled to about 9-10 square meters (100 square feet). Often, more than one person had to share the same room. Two or more generations of the same family would often share an apartment originally built for only one nuclear family. There was no space allocated to separate living and dining areas. After the mid-1950s, new housing policies aimed at the mass construction of larger individual apartments.

==First attempts of socialist city planning in Eastern Europe==
In the process of socialist industrialization, industrial facilities were built not only near existing cities but also in areas where only small rural communities had existed. In such cases, new urban communities emerged in the vicinity of the industrial plants to accommodate the workers. This is the case of Nowa Huta (1949) in Poland, Dunaújváros (1950) in Hungary, and Oneşti (1952) in Romania.

After World War II, dam construction accelerated due to an abundance of new technology. The relocation of people caused by storage reservoirs on large rivers created the need for new communities. Many river-based traditional villages were demolished and their inhabitants relocated. For instance, in Romania, the construction of the Izvorul Muntelui dam on the Bistriţa river required the relocation of several villages with a population of several thousand people.

These trends of the early post-war years were just a sign of what was to follow in the next decades when the constraints of the reconstruction had been overcome and development was undertaken on a much greater scale. However, the first projects highlighted the need for urban planning in the new localities. This also included the design of the entire infrastructure system such as roads, water supply and power supply and also social impact studies, as in many cases the life-style of the population was severely affected. For example, often farmers whose land had been claimed for development would not get replacement farmland or compensation.

== Urban development in the 1960s and 1970s ==

In the big cities few new housing units were constructed and the existing units were overcrowded. Around 1960, the USSR changed its policy and began an extensive program of construction of new apartment buildings, with the introduction of Khrushchevka and the subsequent introduction of Brezhnevka. This trend was immediately followed by all communist countries in Eastern Europe. The development of new neighborhoods in order to extend the housing capacity of cities required an extensive urban planning effort. In most cities, new development took place on the outskirts of the existing cities, incorporating suburbs or undeveloped land into the city. Also, in cities in which slums existed, the slums were redeveloped with modern housing units.

While the actual design and construction of the apartment buildings is not part of the urban planning exercise, the height and type of the buildings, the density of the buildings and other general characteristics were fixed by the planning exercise. Besides, the entire development of the infrastructure had to be planned. This included the transportation system and the roads, water supply, sewerage, power supply, shopping centers, schools and other infrastructure. Flood control was also a concern for cities located in flood prone areas. The planning also covered the industrial zones where new industries were to be located.

In some parts, urban problems were raised also due to other infrastructure, mainly to the development of waterways. The construction of reservoirs on big rivers in the proximity of cities created new waterfronts which had to be developed. This happened mainly in the Soviet Union, but also in other countries. Also some urban planning was required in the downtown districts where new official buildings were constructed. An example is the development of the area of the congress hall attached to the previous royal palace in the center of Bucharest.

==Planning of rural localities==

The standardization of living (i.e. hot and cold running water, electricity, access to medicine and education, etc.) between the workers in the urban-cityscape and those in the rural-farming lands was an important piece of foundational Marxism–Leninism in the Soviet Union. But by the early 1970s it became clear that the gradual evolution towards equal standards of living between urban and rural workers, as prescribed by Marxism–Leninism, was lagging. Even more disparaging, significant developments in the quality of life for the villages of the European west greatly surpassed those in the communist east (the majority of which only had electricity). Consequently, the USSR found it necessary to enact policy to improve the lives of villagers and advance its own villages to be more comparable to those in the west.

In the Soviet Union, this policy came about through the systematic construction of urban types of residences, mainly multi-story modern apartment blocks, built on the idea that these buildings could provide a degree of comfort that which the older peasant houses could not. As part of this plan, smaller villages (typically those with populations under 1,000) were deemed irrational or inefficient and a variety of remedies could befall them. The mildest consequence was the village could be slated for reduction of services, given a timely notice of demolition, or the workers were asked voluntarily to leave.

=== Romania ===
In time, large-scale demolitions and enormous reconstruction projects of hamlets, villages, towns, and cities, in whole or in part, began to take shape. One of the largest and most ambitious of these developments began in 1974 with the goal of turning Romania into a &quot;multilaterally developed socialist society&quot;. Urban planning, in Romania, began early on as displaced rural Romanians started flocking to the cities. With a &quot;blank canvas&quot; of land, the communist regime hoped to create hundreds of urban industrial centers via investment in schools, medical clinics, housing, and industry.
Although the systematization plan extended, in theory, to the entire country, initial work centered in Moldavia. It also affected such locales as Ceauşescu&#x27;s own native village of Scorniceşti in Olt County: there, the Ceauşescu family home was the only older building left standing. The initial phase of systematization largely petered out by 1980, at which point only about 10 percent of new housing was being built in historically rural areas.

Given the lack of budget, in many regions systematization did not constitute an effective plan, good or bad, for development. Instead, it constituted a barrier against organic regional growth. New buildings had to be at least two stories high, so peasants could not build small houses. Yards were restricted to 250 square meters and private agricultural plots were banned from within the villages. Despite the obvious negative impact of such a scheme on subsistence agriculture, after 1981 villages were mandated to be agriculturally self-sufficient.

In the mid-1980s the concept of systematization found new life, applied primarily to the area of the nation&#x27;s capital, Bucharest. Nearby villages were demolished, often in service of large-scale projects such as a canal from Bucharest to the Danube – projects which were later abandoned by Romania&#x27;s post-communist government. Most dramatically, eight square kilometers in the historic center of Bucharest were leveled. The demolition campaign erased many monuments including 3 monasteries, 20 churches, 3 synagogues, 3 hospitals, 2 theaters and a noted Art Deco sports stadium. This also involved evicting 40,000 people with only a single day&#x27;s notice and relocating them to new homes, in order to make way for the grandiose Centrul Civic and the immense Palace of the People, a building second in size only to the Pentagon.

Urban planning, especially the destruction of historic churches and monasteries, was protested by several nations, especially Hungary and West Germany, each concerned for their national minorities in Transylvania. Despite these protests, Ceauşescu remained in the relatively good graces of the United States and other Western powers almost to the last, largely because his relatively independent political line rendered him a useful counter to the Soviet Union in Cold War politics.

==North Korea==

Pyongyang, the capital of North Korea, has a downtown consisting of hundreds of high-rise apartments. North Korean citizens are provided housing by the government, and the quality of said housing is dependent on social status and household size. The city also has several extraordinarily expansive public spaces that are usually built around colossal monuments depicting Juche ideologies and/or monuments relating to Kim Jong-il and Kim Il Sung.

Car ownership rates in Pyongyang are low, and thus public transportation is vital to the city. A two-line subway system serves the city, with a network of elaborate stations, many with high ceilings and murals on their walls. Additionally, an expansive tram network covers the city. There are no suburbs in Pyongyang as the government&#x27;s city planning policies substitute lower density suburban expansion for high rise residential development in central areas.
==People&#x27;s Republic of China==
The development of urban planning in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) demonstrates a unique approach with Chinese characteristics. It started after communist takeover in the early 1950s. Through implementing new national urban policies, communist planners first introduced urban planning by applying centralised economic planning and industrialisation, especially in heavy industry.

===Phase 1 (1949–1960)===

In September 1952, there were two significant policies promulgated at an urban development conference: &quot;construction of key cities in co-ordination with the national economic development programme&quot; and &quot;establishment of urban planning structure to strengthen city development&quot;. These policies influenced China&#x27;s urban planning significantly and at the same time were clearly defined by the main direction of the state – centralised economic and industrial development. During the First Five-year Plan (1953–58), the nation determined to develop 156 national key projects and 8 key industrial based cities. In this period, vast physical development projects such as industrial bases, community facilities and housing for workers were established to achieve national needs and goals. All of these projects were carried out with the aid of the experts from the Soviet Union, particularly in terms of urban economic development and physical urban design. Urban planning at that time was mainly based on Soviet planning principles and the model of the post-war Soviet planning practice. Soviet-style communist planning concentrated on &quot;formalistic street patterns and grand design for public buildings and monuments, huge public squares, and the predominance of master plans&quot;. The role of communist planners during this period was to focus on location selection of factories and industrial plants, arrangement of service facilities, design of the layout of industrial towns, functional division of urban land use zones and development of residential districts. Historic preservation was not a priority during this period of development. For example, Mao Zedong allowed Beijing&#x27;s city walls to be demolished despite their historical significance in order to make room for other uses. The bricks from the walls were used in new development projects ranging from homes to a subway system. By the end of 1959, there were 180 cities, 1400 towns and more than 2,000 suburban residential settlements that had been project plans prepared under communist planning.

===Phase 2 (1961–1976)===

From 1960 to 1976, due to the political climate changing, the development of urban planning in communist China had suffered severe catastrophes: planning institutions had to cease, planners were assigned to support development in rural areas and planning documents were destroyed or discarded. During the Great Leap Forward in the early 1960s, the utopian socialist planning development which particularly overemphasized large-scale urban development was seen as superior to Western-style planning. However, due to the severe limitations of fiscal and labor resources, the first priority of urban planning was given to utopian socialist principles and then the second place to people&#x27;s livelihood. Thus, giving little attention to the establishment of residential amenities and facilities, there were significant social and physical imbalances resulting in urban development. For instance, in the historic hutong neighborhoods in Beijing, courtyards were routinely replaced with new residential structures in order to accommodate more residents. By the end of this phase, about 30% of these courtyards had residential structures placed on them. Additionally, some anti-urban movements, a typical example being the People&#x27;s Commune Movement, took place in communist China during this period. The purpose of setting up a commune, seen as a sub-community within cities, was to spread industrial values from urban to rural areas so that eventually the urban-rural gap would be eliminated.

===Phase 3 (1977–1984)===

In December 1978, a new era of economic and political reform had begun and accelerated. The major concern of urban planning in communist China shifted to the recognition of the function of cities. Consequently, a nationwide effective force to restore urban master plans was started. By the end of 1984, 241 cities and 1,071 counties throughout the nation as a whole completed their master plans. Although these master plans might not technically fulfill the needs of urban development, they at least acted as guidelines to lead to planned and organised urban construction. In addition, some concepts of mega-metropolitan areas were established during this period.

===Phase 4 (1985–present)===

Contemporary urban planning in China is undergoing rapid, unprecedented urbanization and industrialization. In fact, China&#x27;s urbanization rate was almost 50% by the year 2010, a stark contrast from previous decades. Based upon the current Chinese Urban and Rural Planning Act, two tiers – master plan and detailed plan – make up the Chinese urban planning system. Reviewing the history of urban planning in China, the contemporary planning norm is neither simply following Soviet-style planning nor prohibiting advanced Western viewpoints of urban development. Urban renewal and redevelopment are common themes in contemporary Chinese planning. Large swathes of major cities are sometimes torn down at once to allow for new uses. In some cases, residents simply refuse to move out and developers have to adjust their plans accordingly. These residents have been dubbed &quot;nail houses&quot; or &quot;dingzi hu&quot;, and there have been many famous cases of these holdouts in Chinese media.
==Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia==

Post-WWII SFR Yugoslavia followed in line with the earlier urbanist experiments of the Soviet Union, and often delved in urban planning projects.
The best known example would be the Novi Zagreb (&quot;eng. &quot;New Zagreb&quot;&quot;) urban development scheme of the Zagreb city – the capital of the Socialist republic of Croatia.
The district is mostly residential, consisting of blocks of flats and tower blocks that were built during the Socialist era (1945–1990). Although it is not as prestigious as downtown Zagreb, it has been praised for its good road network, public transportation connections and abundance of parks.

The project was started by the mayor of Zagreb, Većeslav Holjevac, as there was a large expanse of empty and undeveloped land south of the Sava river. The land was seized from the Captol church administration following the victory of the communist partisans in World War II. The mayor, seeing the opportunity to set in motion the building of a completely new and modern city under the socialist administration, promptly organized a team of urbanist designers and city planners.

The first complete solution for habitation with public and commercial contents was made for the neighborhood Trnsko by urbanists Zdenko Kolacio, Mirko Maretić and Josip Uhlik with horticulturist Mira Wenzler-Halambek in 1959–1960. It was followed by plans for neighborhood Zapruđe in 1962–1963, also made by Josip Uhlik.

The project was lauded as a great success, the district being known for its large amounts of foliage and recreational areas, including parks, museums and sports fields. A lot of care also went into building a modernized and efficient system of transportation and mass transit, such as tram and bus lines which were built by 1979. Lauding a typical Eastern bloc architectural style, it was designed to house a large capacity of residents, as the construction of the area was in part driven by the need for workforce to fuel the Zagreb industrialization projects recently put in motion. It also has examples of brutalist architecture, rare for the late period the area was constructed in.

<doc id="354978" wikidata="Q12537" url="?curid=354978" title="Corbel">
<text>In architecture, a corbel is a structural piece of stone, wood or metal jutting from a wall to carry a weight, a type of bracket. A corbel is a solid piece of material in the wall, whereas a console is a piece applied to the structure. A piece of timber projecting in the same way was called a &quot;tassel&quot; or a &quot;bragger&quot; in England.

The technique of corbelling, where rows of corbels deeply keyed inside a wall support a projecting wall or parapet, has been used since Neolithic (New Stone Age) times. It is common in medieval architecture and in the Scottish baronial style as well as in the vocabulary of classical architecture, such as the modillions of a Corinthian cornice. The corbel arch and corbel vault use the technique systematically to make openings in walls and to form ceilings. These are found in the early architecture of most cultures, from Eurasia to Pre-Columbian architecture.

A console is more specifically an S-shaped scroll bracket in the classical tradition, with the upper or inner part larger than the lower (as in the first illustration) or outer. Keystones are also often in the form of consoles. Whereas &quot;corbel&quot; is rarely used outside architecture, &quot;console&quot; is widely used for furniture, as in console table, and other decorative arts where the motif appears.

The word &quot;corbel&quot; comes from Old French and derives from the Latin &#x27;, a [[diminutive]] of&#x27; (&quot;raven&quot;), which refers to the beak-like appearance. Similarly, the French refer to a bracket-corbel, usually a load-bearing internal feature, as a &quot;&quot; (&quot;crow&quot;).

==Decorated corbels==
Norman (Romanesque) corbels often have a plain appearance, although they may be elaborately carved with stylised heads of humans, animals or imaginary &quot;beasts&quot;, and sometimes with other motifs (The Church of St Mary and St David in Kilpeck, Herefordshire is a notable example, with 85 of its original 91 richly carved corbels still surviving).

Similarly, in the Early English period corbels were sometimes elaborately carved, as at Lincoln Cathedral, and sometimes more simply so.
Corbels sometimes end with a point apparently growing into the wall, or forming a knot, and often are supported by angels and other figures. In the later periods the carved foliage and other ornaments used on corbels resemble those used in the capitals of columns.

Throughout England, in half-timber work, wooden corbels (&quot;tassels&quot; or &quot;braggers&quot;) abound, carrying window-sills or oriel windows in wood, which also are often carved.

==Classical architecture==
The corbels carrying balconies in Italy and France were sometimes of great size and richly carved, and some of the finest examples of the Italian Cinquecento (16th century) style are found in them. Taking a cue from 16th-century practice, the Paris-trained designers of 19th-century Beaux-Arts architecture were encouraged to show imagination in varying corbels.

==Corbel tables==

A corbel table is a projecting moulded string course supported by a range of corbels. Sometimes these corbels carry a small arcade under the string course, the arches of which are pointed and trefoiled. As a rule, the corbel table carries the gutter, but in Lombard work the arcaded corbel table was used as a decoration to subdivide the storeys and break up the wall surface. In Italy sometimes over the corbels will form a moulding, and above a plain piece of projecting wall forming a parapet.

The corbels carrying the arches of the corbel tables in Italy and France were often elaborately moulded, sometimes in two or three courses projecting over one another; those carrying the machicolations of English and French castles had four courses.

In modern chimney construction, a corbel table is constructed on the inside of a flue in the form of a concrete ring beam supported by a range of corbels. The corbels can be either in-situ or pre-cast concrete. The corbel tables described here are built at approximately ten-metre intervals to ensure stability of the barrel of refractory bricks constructed thereon.

==Corbelling==
 
Corbelling, where rows of corbels gradually build a wall out from the vertical, has long been used as a simple kind of vaulting, for example in many Neolithic chambered cairns, where walls are gradually corbelled in until the opening can be spanned by a slab.

Corbelled vaults are very common in early architecture around the world. Different types may be called the beehive house (ancient Britain and elsewhere), the Irish clochán, the pre-Roman nuraghe of Sardinia, and the tholos tombs (or &quot;beehive tombs&quot;) of Late Bronze Age Greece and other parts of the Mediterranean.

In medieval architecture, the technique was used to support upper storeys or a parapet projecting forward from the wall plane, often to form machicolations (openings between corbels could be used to drop things onto attackers). This later became a decorative feature, without the openings. Corbelling supporting upper stories and particularly supporting projecting corner turrets subsequently became a characteristic of the Scottish baronial style.

Medieval timber-framed buildings often employ jettying, where upper stories are cantilevered out on projecting wooden beams in a similar manner to corbelling.

<text>Shangri-La Dee Da is the fifth studio album by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots. It was released on June 19, 2001, through Atlantic Records. Recording took place throughout the winter and spring of 2001 in a Malibu villa. It was the band&#x27;s fifth and final album to be produced by Brendan O&#x27;Brien and their last before breaking up in 2003.

Originally planned to be a double album, &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot; contains thirteen tracks which range from heavy, distorted songs to psychedelic-inspired rock and acoustic ballads. &quot;Days of the Week&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Bitch&quot; were released as singles, with the former becoming a rock radio hit.

While &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot; was not as commercially successful as its predecessors, it still sold well, reaching the top ten in the US and the top five in Canada and being certified Gold in both countries. The album received positive reviews from critics, with many praising the variety of moods across the album. The band toured throughout the rest of 2001 to promote the album, including embarking on the Family Values Tour with Linkin Park and others in October and November of that year.

==Background==

&quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot; was originally conceived as a double album dedicated to the memory of Andrew Wood. Around the time of the album&#x27;s release, vocalist Scott Weiland stated his belief that creating a double album would have been a way to &quot;free ourselves from the habits we got into of making records in the past&quot;, adding that not having preconceived ideas about the outcome of the record would have allowed the band to &quot;approach everything equally — not just the rock stuff, not just because the producer or the label or management think it&#x27;s a hit.&quot; According to Weiland, approximately 30 songs had been recorded for the album. Bassist Robert DeLeo was optimistic about the project, stating at the time: &quot;Scott&#x27;s in a space right now where we&#x27;re not cramming to just get a single record done — he&#x27;s in a space where I think a double record is possible.&quot; However, Atlantic and O&#x27;Brien were hesitant about the idea, and the project was reduced to a single album.

===Planned documentary and coffee table book===

Rock photographer Chapman Baehler filmed a behind-the-scenes documentary as the band recorded the LP in their beach villa-turned-recording studio. According to Baehler, the documentary set out to be like a modern-day version of the 1970 Beatles documentary Let It Be. The film would have followed the band through preproduction and creating new songs to putting those songs down on tape. Baehler explained that the documentary included &quot;beautiful&quot; and &quot;moody&quot; shots and clips including &quot;either Dean [DeLeo] or Robert&quot; playing an old organ, Weiland and Dean playing acoustic guitars, and &quot;rock-out live stuff&quot; in the main recording area.

Already an established photographer who had collaborated with the band for years, Baehler was in the midst of working with the band on a coffee-table book when they approached him with the documentary idea. The film and book were both planned to come out in late 2001, but neither saw release.

==Recording==

To record the album, the band rented a mansion in Malibu, California (credited as &quot;The Malibu House&quot; in the album&#x27;s liner notes) in which they, along with O&#x27;Brien, his staff, the band member&#x27;s wives/partners, and the documentary crew lived for the duration of the process. While the cramped atmosphere sometimes facilitated confrontations, Weiland would look back on the experience as &quot;an interesting experiment&quot; with both ups and downs. However, drummer Eric Kretz called the period &quot;the happiest five weeks of my life&quot;, saying the relationship between band members was &quot;at its highest point in six years&quot;.

==Music and lyrics==

Much of &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot; alternates between hard rock and psychedelia-inspired pop rock. In the liner notes, Weiland&#x27;s wife and newborn son were credited as inspirations for a large portion of the album&#x27;s songs. Additionally, much of the material on the album revolves around what he called &quot;the evil inertia&quot; of substance abuse. &quot;Dumb Love&quot;, one of the album&#x27;s heaviest tracks musically, was interpreted by some critics as being one of these tracks lyrically revolving around Weiland&#x27;s struggles with addiction. &quot;Days of the Week&quot; is a more pop-oriented track which, according to Weiland, took a &quot;Beatles–style approach&quot; to its lyrics and melody. Dean also credited Joe Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Indian Summer&quot; as an inspiration on the track. Weiland described the song&#x27;s subject as an &quot;assessment of my feelings coming straight out of jail and being hit with sensory overload and a lot of new insecurities.&quot; While he would later state he felt the band &quot;probably shouldn&#x27;t&quot; have chosen the track to be the album&#x27;s lead single, Weiland did name it as one of his ten favorite tracks from his career. The industrial–tinged &quot;Coma&quot; features processing applied to Weiland&#x27;s vocals which &quot;PopMatters&quot; described as &quot;imitating a scratchy guitar&quot;. &quot;Wonderful&quot; was written by Robert and Weiland in a dressing room while on tour. Weiland initially wanted the song to go in &quot;a Nick Drake kind of direction&quot;, until going through multiple different arrangements and creating the finalized song. Written as a love song to his wife, Weiland once called it his favorite ballad the band has made. &quot;Black Again&quot; was written as a waltz, being played in .

&quot;Too Cool Queenie&quot; tells a narrative of &quot;a vindictive siren who prompts her musician-husband&#x27;s suicide&quot; which is widely thought to have been written about Courtney Love. Described as a &quot;day-in-the-life song&quot;, &quot;Bi-Polar Bear&quot; references Weiland&#x27;s struggles with bipolar disorder. In a June 2001 interview with VH1, he described its lyrics as a &quot;snapshot&quot; of a manic or depressive episode. The song sees the band experiment with unusual instrumentation, with Robert playing autoharp and Kretz contributing banjo. &quot;A Song for Sleeping&quot; is an acoustic ballad which was written about Weiland&#x27;s newfound fatherhood. The closing track &quot;Long Way Home&quot; sees Weiland return to the lower, &quot;guttural growling&quot; vocal style of the band&#x27;s early work.

==Release and reception==

===Commercial performance===

&quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot; became the band&#x27;s fifth top ten album, peaking at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, it would remain their lowest-charting album until &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot; (2018) and was their first to fail to go Platinum. The album&#x27;s highest chart placement was in Canada, where it peaked at number five.

&quot;Days of the Week&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, peaked at number four on the Mainstream Rock chart, number five on the Alternative Airplay (then named &quot;Modern Rock Tracks&quot;) chart, and number one on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The second single, &quot;Hollywood Bitch&quot;, was not as successful, but did manage to reach numbers 25 and 29 on the Mainstream Rock and Modern Rock Tracks charts, respectively.

===Critical reception===

&quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. &quot;PopMatters&quot; stated that the album &quot;displays an earnestness and a level of comfort not heard on previous albums&quot;. The review highlighted the band&#x27;s fusions of different styles, referring to the album as a &quot;complex and genre-bending joyride&quot;. Writing for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Greg Kot praised the album&#x27;s lyrical themes and opined that &quot;they give the album a weight and coherence lacking on previous STP releases.&quot; &quot;Launch.com&quot; called it &quot;another bombshell of an album&quot;, praising its &quot;majestic&quot; melodies, &quot;muscular pop-metal&quot; style, and the darker content of Weiland&#x27;s lyrics.

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine believed that while some of the harder rock tracks on the album (namely &quot;Dumb Love&quot; and &quot;Hollywood Bitch&quot;) &quot;do take hold&quot;, the highlights of the album are the poppier tracks, saying that &quot;they&#x27;re not just better on the pop tunes, they&#x27;re phenomenal on the pop tunes.&quot; Ultimate Guitar placed the album at number five in their list of the &quot;Top 10 Grunge Albums That Survived the &#x27;00s&quot;, praising the album&#x27;s psychedelic elements and adventurous nature.

<doc id="354983" wikidata="Q746632" url="?curid=354983" title="Allen's gallinule">
<text>Allen&#x27;s gallinule (Porphyrio alleni), formerly known as the lesser gallinule, is a small waterbird of the family Rallidae. 

== Taxonomy ==
Its former binomial name is &quot;Porphyrula alleni&quot;. &quot;Porphyrio&quot; is the Latin for &quot;swamphen&quot;, and &quot;alleni&quot;, like the English name, commemorates British naval officer Rear-Admiral William Allen (1792–1864).

== Distribution and habitat ==
Its breeding habitat is marshes and lakes in Sub-Saharan Africa. Remarkably, this apparently weakly flying bird is not only the only species with a purely sub-Saharan African range to have reached Great Britain, but has done so twice. It has also occurred as a vagrant in several other European countries.

== Description ==

They are similar in size to the only slightly larger water rail. The Allen&#x27;s gallinule has a short red bill, greenish back and purple upperparts. They have red legs with long toes, and a short tail which is white with a dark central bar underneath. Breeding males have a blue frontal shield, which is green in the female. Immature Allen&#x27;s gallinules are sandy brown with a buff undertail. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails. They nod their heads as they swim.

== Breeding ==
Allen&#x27;s gallinules are very secretive in the breeding season, particularly in the dense swamps they favour, and are mostly heard rather than seen. They are then rather noisy birds, with a sharp nasal &quot;pruk&quot; call. This species is partially migratory, undertaking seasonal movements. They can be easier to see on migration or when wintering. They build a floating nest in marshes and swamps, laying 2–5 eggs. 

== Diet ==
These birds probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and aquatic animals.

<doc id="354984" wikidata="Q693558" url="?curid=354984" title="Flag of Saskatchewan">
<text>The provincial flag of Saskatchewan was adopted in 1969. It is blazoned per fess vert and or, in the fly a prairie lily slipped and leaved proper, in the dexter chief an escutcheon of the coat of arms of Saskatchewan fimbriated argent. The symbolism within the flag is shown just with the colours; yellow representing the grain fields in the southern portion of the province where as the green represents the northern forested areas. The western red lily in the fly of the flag is the provincial flower.
In 2017, The Minister of Parks, Culture and Sports designated September 22 as Saskatchewan Flag Day.

== History ==
The flag of Saskatchewan was adopted on September 22, 1969, the result of a province-wide competition that drew over 4000 entries. The winning entry was one of the 13 designed by Anthony Drake of Hodgeville, Saskatchewan. Drake came and left Saskatchewan from the United Kingdom and did not have an opportunity to see his winning design fly until returning to Hodgeville. Saskatchewan politician Percy Schmeiser was on the flag committee in 1969 during his time as member of the Legislative Assembly and was at the inaugural flag raising ceremony, unlike Anthony Drake. The two finally met when Drake returned in 2019.

== Other flags ==

=== 60th anniversary flag ===
In preparation for the province&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee in 1965, the government organized a competition to design a distinctive flag utilizing the colours of the province&#x27;s coat of arms. Sister Imelda of St. Angela&#x27;s Convent of Prelate designed the winning flag, and it was selected from 241 other entries. The flag was first hoisted on 31 January 1965. Its use continued as the province&#x27;s flag for the Canadian centennial in 1967, and in the years prior to the selection of the current flag Sister Imelda&#x27;s was used as well. The flag&#x27;s sponsors hoped it would officially be the province&#x27;s flag, as it was being used to represent Saskatchewan, but that was not the case.

The Diamond Jubilee flag is blazoned &quot;per fess gules and vert, in the fly an escutcheon of the Arms of Saskatchewan fimbriated or, in the hoist a stalk of wheat or&quot;. The red in the top half symbolizes the fires that used to rage through the prairies in the years before cultivation, the green represents the luxuriant growth, and the gold representing the ripening the wheat fields.

=== Fransaskois flag ===

This flag used to represent the heritage of the French speakers of Saskatchewan and is blazoned &quot;Or a cross enhanced throughout vert, its vertical beam to the hoist, in the fly a fleur-de-lis gules its traverse vert&quot;.

The symbolism within the Fransaskois flag is mostly the same as the provincial flag with the yellow and green representing the wheat and the forests respectively. However, with the addition of the cross alluding to the role that the Catholic Church and the many missionaries had in settling what is now the province of Saskatchewan and the fleur-de-lis which represents the Francophone population globally; it is coloured red to show the fighting courage in the battle of preserving the rights of their culture and language; it makes the flag distinguishable enough to stand out on its own.

=== Standard of the lieutenant governor of Saskatchewan ===

The lieutenant governor of Saskatchewan is a viceregal representative of the monarch of Canada and thus has their own flag. It has precedence over any other flag except the royal standard and the flag of the governor general of Canada, unless the governor general is a guest of the lieutenant governor. This flag is flown at the home and office of the lieutenant governor as well as any buildings that may conduct official duties.

It is blazoned &quot;Azure the shield of Arms of the Province of Saskatchewan ensigned with the Royal Crown proper and encircled by a wreath of maple leaves Or&quot;.

<doc id="354987" wikidata="Q533415" url="?curid=354987" title="Best Buy">
<text>Best Buy Co., Inc. is an American multinational consumer electronics retailer headquartered in Richfield, Minnesota. Originally founded by Richard M. Schulze and James Wheeler in 1966 as an audio specialty store called Sound of Music, it was rebranded under its current name with an emphasis on consumer electronics in 1983.

Best Buy operates internationally in Canada, and formerly operated in China until February 2011 (when the faction was merged with Five Star) and in Mexico until December 2020 (due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic). The company also operated in Europe until 2012. Its subsidiaries include Geek Squad, Magnolia Audio Video, and Pacific Sales. Best Buy also operates the Best Buy Mobile and Insignia brands in North America, plus Five Star in China. Best Buy sells cellular phones from Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T Mobility, T-Mobile, Boost Mobile and Ting Mobile in the United States. In Canada, carriers include Bell Mobility, Rogers Wireless, Telus Mobility, their fighter brands, and competing smaller carriers, such as SaskTel.

Hubert Joly is executive chairman of Best Buy, having been succeeded as CEO by Corie Barry in June 2019. According to Yahoo! Finance, Best Buy is the largest specialty retailer in the United States consumer electronics retail industry. The company ranked number 72 in the 2018 &quot;Fortune&quot; 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.

==History==
===Early history===

On August 22, 1966, Richard M. Schulze and a business partner opened Sound of Music, an electronics store specializing in high fidelity stereos in St. Paul, Minnesota. Schulze financed the opening of his first store with his personal savings and a second mortgage he took out on his family&#x27;s home. In 1967, Sound of Music acquired Kencraft Hi-Fi Company and Bergo Company. Sound of Music earned $1 million in revenue and made about $58,000 in profits in its first year. In 1969, Sound of Music had three stores and Schulze bought out his business partner.

Sound of Music operated nine stores throughout Minnesota by 1978. In 1981, the Roseville location, at the time the largest and most profitable Sound of Music store, was hit by a tornado. The store&#x27;s roof was sheared off and showroom destroyed, but the storeroom was left intact. In response, Schulze decided to have a &quot;Tornado Sale&quot; of damaged and excess stock in the damaged store&#x27;s parking lot. He poured the remainder of his marketing budget into advertising the sale, promising &quot;best buys&quot; on everything. Sound of Music made more money during the four-day sale than it did in a typical month.

In 1983, with seven stores and $10 million in annual sales, Sound of Music was renamed Best Buy Company, Inc. The company also expanded its product offerings to include home appliances and VCRs, in an attempt to expand beyond its then-core customer base of 15- to 18-year-old males. Later that year, Best Buy opened its first superstore in Burnsville, Minnesota. The Burnsville location featured a high-volume, low-price business model, which was borrowed partially from Schulze&#x27;s successful Tornado Sale in 1981. In its first year, the Burnsville store out-performed all other Best Buy stores combined.

Best Buy was taken public in 1985, and two years later it debuted on the New York Stock Exchange. In 1988, Best Buy was in a price and location war with Detroit-based appliance chain Highland Superstores, and Schulze attempted to sell the company to Circuit City for US$30 million. Circuit City rejected the offer, claiming they could open a store in Minneapolis and &quot;blow them away.&quot;

In 1988, the company introduced a new store concept dubbed &quot;Concept II&quot;. Concept II replaced dimly lit industrial-style stores with brighter and more fashionably fixtured stores. Stores also began placing all stock on the sales floor rather than in a stock room, had fewer salespersons and provided more self-help product information for its customers. Best Buy also did away with commissioned salespeople. The commission-free sales environment &quot;created a more relaxed shopping environment free of the high-pressure sales tactics used in other stores,&quot; but was unpopular with salespersons and suppliers. Upset that their products would no longer be pushed by salespeople, some suppliers such as Maytag, Whirlpool, and Sony stopped selling in Best Buy stores altogether. The suppliers returned after Best Buy&#x27;s sales and revenue grew following the roll-out of Concept II.

In 1992, the company achieved $1 billion in annual revenues. Its Midwest rival, Highland would file for bankruptcy in the same year and close all locations by 1993.

In 1994, Best Buy debuted &quot;Concept III&quot; stores in several new markets including Los Angeles and Washington, D.C. Concept III stores were larger than previous stores and included expanded product offerings, &quot;Answer Center&quot; touchscreen kiosks that displayed product information for both customers and employees, and demonstration areas for products such as surround sound stereo systems and video games.

Best Buy launched its &quot;Concept IV&quot; stores with its expansion into New England in 1998. Concept IV stores included an open layout with products organized by category, cash registers located throughout the store, and slightly smaller stores than Concept III stores. The stores also had large areas for demonstrating home theater systems and computer software.

In 1999, Best Buy was added to Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s S&amp;P 500.

===2000s===

In 2000, Best Buy formed Redline Entertainment, an independent music label and action-sports video distributor. The company acquired Magnolia Hi-Fi, Inc., an audio-video retailer located in California, Washington, and Oregon, in December 2000.

In January 2001, Best Buy acquired Musicland Stores Corporation, a Minnetonka, Minnesota-based retailer that sold home-entertainment products under the Sam Goody, Suncoast Motion Picture Company, Media Play, and OnCue brands. Best Buy purchased the company for $425 million in cash and the assumption of $271 million of Musicland debt. Later that year, Best Buy acquired the British Columbia, Canada-based electronics-chain Future Shop Ltd., marking its entrance to the international marketplace. Under the deal, Future Shop was purchased for about US$377 million and continued to operate as subsidiary independent from Best Buy Canada.

Brad Anderson succeeded Richard Schulze as Best Buy CEO in July 2002. Anderson had begun working at Best Buy in 1973 while attending seminary school. He was promoted to vice president in 1981 and executive vice president in 1986. Anderson had most recently served as president and COO of Best Buy, a position he had held since 1991. In September of that year, Best Buy opened the first Canadian Best Buy-branded store in Mississauga, Ontario. In October, Best Buy acquired Minneapolis-based Geek Squad, then a 24-hour residential computer repair business with offices in Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.

Best Buy stores in the U.S. surpassed the 600-store mark and the company opened its first global-sourcing office in Shanghai in 2003. In June, Best Buy divested itself of Musicland in a deal with Sun Capital Partners under which Sun Capital received all of Musicland&#x27;s stock and debt. Best Buy launched its &quot;Reward Zone&quot; loyalty program in July following an 8-month test of the program in San Diego, California. Also in 2003, Best Buy&#x27;s corporate offices were consolidated into a single campus in Richfield, Minnesota.

In January 2004, Best Buy hired Virtucom Group to revamp Best Buy&#x27;s website and handle all of the company&#x27;s online content. In May, the company launched its &quot;customer centricity&quot; program, which segmented its stores according to customer profiles. The program also called for employees to focus on specific customer groups rather than product categories. In October, Best Buy completed rolling out Geek Squad &quot;precincts&quot; in every American Best Buy store.

In April 2005, Best Buy began eliminating mail-in rebates in response to negative customer reaction against them, and instead started giving out instant rebates via notebook computers.

In May 2006, Best Buy acquired a majority interest in Chinese appliance retailer Jiangsu Five Star Appliance for $180 million. At the time of the deal, Jiangsu was the fourth-largest appliance chain in China with 193 stores across eight Chinese provinces. In June, the company opened Geek Squad precincts at Office Depot in Orlando, Florida. The market test was later expanded to Denver.

In January 2007, the first Best Buy-branded store in China officially opened in Shanghai. In March 2007, Best Buy acquired Speakeasy, a Seattle-based broadband VOIP, data, and IT services provider. The acquisition was worth $80 million, and under terms of the deal, Speakeasy began operating as a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy. The company&#x27;s products also became part of Best Buy&#x27;s For Business program. Best Buy also expanded its Geek Squad market tests in March, opening Geek Squad precincts in FedEx Kinkos stores located in Indianapolis and Charlotte, North Carolina. In October 2007, Best Buy became the first consumer-electronics retailer to exit the analog television market, carrying only digital products that became mandatory in June 2009 by the FCC.

In February 2008, Best Buy opened its first store in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Best Buy&#x27;s Geek Squad market tests in Office Depot and FedEx Kinkos stores ended by March. Also in March, the company began promoting the Blu-ray optical-disc format over the HD DVD format, a move which ultimately contributed to Toshiba&#x27;s decision to drop HD DVD. In May, the company agreed to buy 50% of the retail division of The Carphone Warehouse, a London, England-based mobile phone retailer. The deal was worth $2.1 billion.

In July 2008, Best Buy announced that it would start selling musical instruments and related gear in over 80 of its retail stores, making the company the second-largest musical-instrument distributor in the US. Best Buy became the first third-party retail seller of Apple&#x27;s iPhone in September. Later that month, the company agreed to acquire Napster for $121 million. In December, Best Buy opened its first store in Mexico.

In February 2009, Best Buy leveraged its partnership with The Carphone Warehouse to launch Best Buy Mobile, a Best Buy-branded mobile retailer. Best Buy Mobile standalone stores were opened in shopping malls and urban downtowns. These Best Buy Mobile outlets were also added in all Best Buy-branded stores.

In June 2009, Brian J. Dunn became Best Buy CEO. Dunn replaced Brad Anderson, who was retiring. Dunn had joined Best Buy in 1985 as a sales associate. In 2000, Dunn became senior vice president of East Coast operations and president of North American retail operations in 2004. His most recent position was as president of Best Buy since 2006.

In November 2009, Best Buy partnered with Roxio&#x27;s CinemaNow to launch an on-demand streaming service which allowed streaming from any Internet device sold by Best Buy.

In December 2009, Best Buy opened its first Turkish store in İzmir.

===2010s===
In April 2010, Best Buy opened its first United Kingdom-based Best Buy-branded store in Thurrock. The company eventually opened 11 Best Buy stores in the United Kingdom, all of which were closed in early 2012. In November 2011, Best Buy purchased The Carphone Warehouse&#x27;s share of Best Buy Mobile for $1.3 billion. Best Buy and The Carphone Warehouse maintained their Best Buy Europe joint venture, which at the time operated 2,500 mobile phone stores throughout Europe.

The company closed all of its Best Buy-branded stores in China by February 2011, when it merged Best Buy China&#x27;s operations with Jiangsu Five Star, which had become a wholly owned subsidiary of Best Buy in 2009. In December 2011, Best Buy purchased mindSHIFT Technologies, a company that provided IT support for small and medium-sized businesses, for $167 million.

In 2012, in response to overall revenue decline, Best Buy announced plans to undergo a &quot;transformation strategy&quot;. Stores began to adopt a redesigned &quot;Connected Store&quot; format, providing the Geek Squad with a centralized service desk and implementing a &quot;store-within-a-store&quot; concept for Pacific Kitchen &amp; Bath and Magnolia Design Center.

In April 2012, Brian Dunn resigned as Best Buy&#x27;s CEO during an internal company investigation into allegations of personal misconduct stemming from an inappropriate relationship with a female Best Buy employee. Best Buy named Director George L. Mikan III interim CEO following Dunn&#x27;s resignation. The internal investigation was released in May 2012 and alleged that Best Buy founder and chairman Richard Schulze knew of Dunn&#x27;s inappropriate relationship and failed to notify the Best Buy board. Schulze subsequently resigned his chairmanship of the company. Best Buy Director Hatim Tyabji replaced Schulze as Best Buy chairman.

In September 2012, Hubert Joly replaced Mikan as Best Buy CEO. Joly had previously served as CEO of Carlson, a hospitality conglomerate, since 2008. He led initiatives such as price matching, speeding up delivery times for online purchases, establishing &quot;store within a store&quot; sections for major brands such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, and Samsung, and giving more product training to employees.

In April 2013, Best Buy exited the European consumer electronics market when it sold its 50% stake in The Carphone Warehouse back to the UK-based mobile phone retailer. The sale was worth around $775 million.

An increasing trend towards online shopping began to erode revenues and profits in the 2010s. A 4% dip in sales for the June 30, 2014, quarter, marked the 10th quarter in a row where Best Buy&#x27;s sales had declined. The company, in announcing the result, said it was focusing more on digital media in its marketing, moving away from newspaper, magazine, and television advertising.

On March 28, 2015, Best Buy announced the shutdown of the Future Shop chain in Canada; 65 of its 131 former locations were converted into Best Buy locations, while the rest (primarily those in close proximity to an existing Best Buy) were closed permanently.

On March 1, 2018, the company announced that it would shut down its 250 standalone Best Buy Mobile stores in the United States by the end of May, due to low revenue and high costs. The Best Buy Mobile stores were reported to account for 1% of the company&#x27;s revenue.

On May 9, 2018, the company unveiled a new logo for the first time in nearly three decades.

On July 2, 2018, Best Buy announced it was cutting the amount of store space devoted to selling physical music, citing the popularity of streaming services as having reduced sales.

On April 15, 2019, Best Buy announced that in June 2019, its current CFO, Corie Barry, would replace Hubert Joly who held the position of CEO since August 2012. Joly subsequently became executive chairman of the company.

===2020s===
Despite an increase in sales of computer equipment due to an increase in remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic, Best Buy laid off over 5,000 employees in early 2021 and forced many others into part-time positions.

In August 2022, Best Buy said it would be laying off employees across the country after warnings of weaker sales, and the company cut its forecast for the remainder of 2022.

On October 13, 2023, Best Buy announced that it would phase out the sale of home video on physical media in early 2024, citing changes in the market due to the prevalence of streaming video on demand services.

On January 18, 2024, BCE Inc. announced an agreement with Best Buy&#x27;s Canadian division, under which selected locations of its competing chain The Source (originally the Canadian franchises of RadioShack, which were later acquired by Circuit City and, in turn, Bell)—which primarily operates in malls and smaller markets—would be rebranded as Best Buy Express. The stores will receive inventory from Best Buy and integrate with its e-commerce operations, but will continue to otherwise be owned and operated by BCE under license, and exclusively offer wireless services from Bell Canada and its subsidiaries. The first location opened in Surrey, British Columbia in June 2024; 167 of The Source&#x27;s locations will be renovated to the format by the end of 2024, with the remaining locations being closed.

In January 2025, Best Buy announced plans to relaunch its online marketplace for third-party sellers by Summer 2025. The retailer had previously operated a marketplace from 2011 to 2016. This time, Best Buy is partnering with Mirakl, a marketplace software provider, to build the platform.

==Corporate affairs==
===Business operations===
Best Buy sells consumer electronics and a variety of related merchandise, including software, video games, music, mobile phones, digital cameras, car stereos, and video cameras, in addition to home appliances (washing machines, dryers, and refrigerators), in a noncommissioned sales environment. Under the Geek Squad brand, Best Buy offers computer repair, warranty service, and accidental service plans. Best Buy provides an online community forum for members, where consumers can discuss product experiences, ask questions, and get answers from other members or retail product experts.

The building exteriors of Best Buy-branded stores are typically light brown, with the entrance designed to look like a blue box emerging from the structure. Corporate employees operated under a results only work environment from 2005 until March 2013, when the management style was abandoned by Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly.

As of October 29, 2016, Best Buy operated 1,026 Best Buy, 331 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores, and 28 stand-alone Pacific Sales stores in the US. Best Buy also operated: 135 Best Buy and 53 Best Buy Mobile stand-alone stores in Canada; and 18 Best Buy stores and 5 Best Buy Express stores in Mexico. Best Buy exited the European market in April 2013, selling its stake in the business back to its partner Carphone Warehouse.

===House brands===

Best Buy also produces products under eight house brands:
* Dynex – Discount electronic and computer equipment such as Blu-ray players, data and power cables, HDTVs, office supplies, storage media, and webcams
* Init – Storage products such as media storage, equipment bags, totes, and furniture for home theaters
* Insignia – Electronic equipment, small appliances, and accessories including adapters, cables, HDTVs, mini refrigerators, and tablets

* Modal – style-oriented mobile accessories, including Bluetooth speakers, cables, and cases
* Pacific Sales (in select Best Buy stores) – High-end appliances

* RocketFish Mobile – Phone cases, gel skins, clips, and chargers for cell phones, GPS, and other exclusive high-end products

==Controversies==
===Warranty===
In 2000, two Florida consumers brought a lawsuit against the company, alleging that it engaged in fraudulent business practices related to the sale of extended warranties (or, more accurately, service plans). The suit claimed that store employees had misrepresented the manufacturer&#x27;s warranty to sell its own Product Service/Replacement Plan and that Best Buy had &quot;entered into a corporate-wide scheme to institute high-pressure sales techniques involving the extended warranties&quot; and that the company used &quot;artificial barriers to discourage consumers who purchased the &#x27;complete extended warranties&#x27; from making legitimate claims.&quot; The company ultimately settled for $200,000, but admitted no wrongdoing.

In 2014, Best Buy settled for $4.55 million in a class-action lawsuit filed against them in April 2010 by consumers who claimed Best Buy was making unsolicited phone calls in contravention of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.

===Pricing===
In the second quarter of 2007, Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal ordered an investigation into the company&#x27;s use of an in-store website alleged to have misled customers on item sales prices. In December 2007, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported on the same issue, in which some customers claimed they thought they were surfing the Internet version of bestbuy.com at an in-store kiosk only to learn that the site reflected in-store prices only. In response, company spokesperson Sue Busch indicated the in-store kiosks were not intended for price-match purposes and rather were a means to navigate in-store availability. Since the initial investigation, a banner was placed on the in-store site to make its customers more aware of the difference.

===Analog televisions===
On April 26, 2008, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) fined the company $280,000 for not alerting customers that the analog televisions it sold would not receive over-the-air stations after the digital transition on June 12, 2009. The company challenged this ruling in May 2008 by the FCC saying it was and is in compliance with current FCC regulations pertaining to the digital transition.

===Environmental issues===
Best Buy was one of several companies named in a 2007 report by Greenpeace for purchasing raw materials or manufactured products derived thereof from logging companies that in the opinion of Greenpeace, contribute to unethical deforestation of taiga in Canada.

Since that time, however, the company launched what it calls Greener Together to increase the energy efficiency of its products, and reduce consumer waste through more recyclable packaging and proper disposal of certain electronic components such as rechargeable batteries and empty ink cartridges.

As a way to improve its image and past environmental issues, the company introduced a recycling program in 2009 that has since collected nearly half-a-billion pounds of consumer electronics and e-waste, and is available at all their stores for a nominal fee. These items are then handed over to certified recyclers in the U.S. for proper recycling. The company&#x27;s goal is to collect one billion pounds of recycling.

It also has been named to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency top-50 list of the largest green-power purchasers. In 2011, the company purchased nearly 119 million kilowatt-hours of green power electricity generated from renewable resources, such as wind, solar, geothermal, biogas, biomass, and low-impact hydropower.

===FBI collaboration===
In their attempt to combat child pornography, the FBI hired several Best Buy employees from the Geek Squad division to covertly work for them flagging potential targets. In one incident, a customer brought in his computer for troubleshooting, which a Best Buy employee flagged as containing images of child pornography and reported to the FBI. The customer was indicted for possession of child pornography, although the judge in the case later threw out nearly all the evidence against the defendant due to &quot;false and misleading statements&quot; made by an FBI agent while trying to secure a search warrant for the customer&#x27;s house, and the government ultimately dropped the case.

===Privacy===
On October 20, 2023, CBC News released the results of a &quot;Marketplace&quot; investigation which found that Best Buy technicians had viewed private files, such as intimate photos, on customer devices. One technician was also caught copying photos onto a USB flash drive.

===LGBT issues===

In March 2024, following threats of shareholder-related action from conservative advocacy groups, Best Buy agreed to block donations by employee resource groups to eight LGBT organizations, over their support for access to gender affirming care for trans minors. This was met with criticism by a number of groups, including GLAAD and the Human Rights Campaign.

<doc id="354988" wikidata="Q1286070" url="?curid=354988" title="Parapet">
<text>A parapet is a barrier that is an upward extension of a wall at the edge of a roof, terrace, balcony, walkway or other structure. The word comes ultimately from the Italian &quot;parapetto&quot; (&quot;parare&quot; &#x27;to cover/defend&#x27; and &quot;petto&quot; &#x27;chest/breast&#x27;). Where extending above a roof, a parapet may simply be the portion of an exterior wall that continues above the edge line of the roof surface, or may be a continuation of a vertical feature beneath the roof such as a fire wall or party wall. Parapets were originally used to defend buildings from military attack, but today they are primarily used as guard rails, to conceal rooftop equipment, reduce wind loads on the roof, and to prevent the spread of fires.

==Parapet types==

Parapets may be plain, embattled, perforated or panelled, which are not mutually exclusive terms.
*Plain parapets are upward extensions of the wall, sometimes with a coping at the top and corbel below.
*Embattled parapets may be panelled, but are pierced, if not purely as stylistic device, for the discharge of defensive projectiles.
*Perforated parapets are pierced in various designs such as circles, trefoils, or quatrefoils.
*Panelled parapets are ornamented by a series of panels, either or square, and more or less enriched, but not perforated. These are common in the Decorated and Perpendicular periods.

==Historic parapet walls==

The Mirror Wall at Sigiriya, Sri Lanka built between 477 and 495 AD is one of the few surviving protective parapet walls from antiquity. Built onto the side of Sigiriya Rock it ran for a distance of approximately and provided protection from inclement weather. Only about of this wall exists today, but brick debris and grooves on the rock face along the western side of the rock clearly show where the rest of this wall once stood.

==Parapet roofs==

Parapets surrounding roofs are common in London. This dates from the Building Act 1707 which banned projecting wooden eaves in the cities of Westminster and London as a fire risk. Instead an 18-inch brick parapet was required, with the roof set behind. This was continued in many Georgian houses, as it gave the appearance of a flat roof which accorded with the desire for classical proportions.

In Shilpa Shastras, the ancient Indian science of sculpture, a parapet is known as &quot;hāra&quot;. It is optionally added while constructing a temple. The &quot;hāra&quot; can be decorated with various miniature pavilions, according to the Kāmikāgama. In the Bible the Hebrews are obligated to build a parapet on the roof of their houses to prevent people falling (Deuteronomy 22:8).

==Firewall parapets==
Many firewalls are required to have a parapet, a portion of the wall extending above the roof. The parapet is required to be as fire resistant as the lower wall, and extend a distance prescribed by building code.

==Bridge parapets==

Parapets on bridges and other highway structures (such as retaining walls) prevent users from falling off where there is a drop. They may also be meant to restrict views, to prevent rubbish passing below, and to act as noise barriers.

Bridge parapets may be made from any material, but structural steel, aluminium, timber and reinforced concrete are common. They may be of solid or framed construction.

In European standards, parapets are defined as a sub-category of &quot;vehicle restraint systems&quot; or &quot;pedestrian restraint systems&quot;.

==Parapets in fortification==
A parapet fortification (known as a breastwork when temporary) is a wall of stone, wood or earth on the outer edge of a defensive wall or trench, which shelters the defenders. In medieval castles, they were often crenellated. In later artillery forts, parapets tend to be higher and thicker. They could be provided with embrasures for the fort&#x27;s guns to fire through, and a banquette or fire-step so that defending infantry could shoot over the top. The top of the parapet often slopes towards the enemy to enable the defenders to shoot downwards; this incline is called the &quot;superior talus&quot;.

<doc id="354989" wikidata="Q692922" url="?curid=354989" title="Novarupta">
<text>Novarupta is a volcano that was formed in 1912, located on the Alaska Peninsula on a slope of Trident Volcano in Katmai National Park and Preserve, about southwest of Anchorage. Formed during the largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century, Novarupta released 30 times the volume of magma of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens.

==Eruption of 1912==
The 1912 eruption that formed Novarupta was the largest to occur during the 20th century. It began on June 6, 1912, and culminated in a series of violent eruptions. Rated a 6 on the volcanic explosivity index, the 60-hour-long eruption expelled of ash, thirty times as much as the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. The erupted magma of rhyolite, dacite, and andesite resulted in more than of air fall tuff and approximately of pyroclastic ash-flow tuff. During the 20th century, only the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines and the 1902 eruption of Santa María in Guatemala were of comparable magnitude; Mount Pinatubo ejected of tephra, and Santa María just slightly less.

At least two larger eruptions occurred in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) during the 19th century: the 1815 eruption of Tambora ( of tephra) and the 1883 eruption of Krakatoa ( of tephra).

The Novarupta eruption occurred about from the peak of Mount Katmai Volcano and below the post-eruption Mount Katmai summit. During the eruption a large quantity of magma erupted from beneath the Mount Katmai area, resulting in the formation of a wide, funnel-shaped vent and the collapse of Mount Katmai&#x27;s summit, creating a deep, caldera.

The eruption ended with the extrusion of a lava dome of rhyolite that plugged the vent. The high and wide dome it created forms what is now referred to as Novarupta.

Despite the magnitude of the eruption, no deaths directly resulted. Eyewitness accounts from people located downwind in the path of a thick ash cloud described the gradual lowering of visibility to next to nothing. Ash threatened to contaminate drinking water and destroyed food resources, but the Alaska Natives were aided in their survival by traditional knowledge passed down through generations from previous eruptions. However, the Native villages experiencing the heaviest ash falls were abandoned and the inhabitants relocated.

==Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes==


Pyroclastic flows from the eruption formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes, named by botanist Robert F. Griggs, who explored the volcano&#x27;s aftermath for the National Geographic Society in 1916.

The eruption that formed the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes is one of the few in recorded history to have produced welded tuff, producing numerous fumaroles that persisted for 15 years.

==Katmai National Park==
Established as a National Park &amp; Preserve in 1980, Katmai is located on the Alaska Peninsula, across from Kodiak Island, with headquarters in nearby King Salmon, about southwest of Anchorage. The area was originally designated a National Monument in 1918 to protect the area around the 1912 eruption of Novarupta and the , deep, pyroclastic flow of the Valley of Ten Thousand Smokes.

<doc id="354990" wikidata="Q3106974" url="?curid=354990" title="Thank You (Stone Temple Pilots album)">
<text>Thank You is a greatest hits collection released by the American rock band Stone Temple Pilots on November 11, 2003 on Atlantic Records. The album has sold over 500,000 copies.

==Overview==
&quot;Thank You&quot; features most of the band&#x27;s singles.

There are two versions of the compilation, one that only contains a music CD and another that also features a DVD with live performances, bootlegs (including a performance of the Aerosmith song &quot;Sweet Emotion&quot; with Steven Tyler and Joe Perry), and music videos spanning the band&#x27;s career.

&quot;Thank You&quot; was called &quot;nearly perfect&quot; by AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Erlewine, who wrote that &quot;STP made music that sounded great at the time and even better now&quot; and that the band&#x27;s music had &quot;stood the test of time.&quot; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the compilation album 4 out of 5 stars.

==&quot;Big Bang Babies&quot;==
An earlier greatest hits album, to be titled &quot;Big Bang Babies&quot;, was planned for an October 2000 release. In addition to twelve of the band&#x27;s biggest numbers, the album was to feature four new songs, including &quot;Heed the Water Whisperer&quot;, &quot;The Way She Moves&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Drive Me Away&quot;. STP planned to record the new material in New York with producer Brendan O&#x27;Brien in mid-2000.

<doc id="354992" wikidata="Q738883" url="?curid=354992" title="Loews Cineplex Entertainment">
<text>Loews Cineplex Entertainment, also known as Loews Incorporated, was an American theater chain operating in North America.

The company was originally called &quot;Loew&#x27;s&quot;, after the name of its founder, Marcus Loew. In 1969, when the Tisch brothers acquired the company, it became known as &quot;Loews&quot;. The company merged with Canadian-based Cineplex Odeon Corporation in 1998, only to go bankrupt in 2001 (as did many other large theater chains around this time). The company merged with AMC Theatres on January 26, 2006, while the Canadian operations merged with Cineplex Galaxy in 2003.

The Loews Theatres name was used until 2017 when AMC simplified their branding to focus on three main lines: AMC, AMC Classic, and AMC Dine-In after their purchase of Carmike Cinemas. Prior to the discontinuation, Loews Cineplex operated its theatres under the Loews Theatres, Cineplex Odeon, Star Theatres, Magic Johnson Theatres, Cinemex and MEGABOX brands. Its corporate offices were located in New York and Toronto. 

From 1924 to 1959, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios (MGM) was its sibling company until it sold its controlling interest in Loew&#x27;s Theatres to the Tisch brothers. Later, it was formerly jointly owned by Sony Pictures and Universal Studios and operated theatres in the United States, Canada, South Korea, Spain and Mexico.

==History==
Loew&#x27;s Theatres Incorporated was formed in 1904 in Cincinnati, Ohio, by entrepreneur Marcus Loew. Loew founded a chain of nickelodeon theaters which showed short silent films in storefront locations. Soon the company opened vaudeville houses and movie palaces. Loew&#x27;s theaters were found in cities throughout the United States, but primarily in East Coast and Midwest states.

To provide films for his theaters, Loew founded Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in 1924, by merging the earlier firms Metro Pictures, Goldwyn Pictures, and Louis B. Mayer Productions. Loew&#x27;s Incorporated served as the distribution arm and parent company for the studio until the two were separated by the 1948 U.S. Supreme Court ruling &quot;United States v. Paramount Pictures, Inc.&quot; The two companies officially split in 1959.
Loews Corporation, the successor company to the original firm founded by Marcus Loew, announced on April 9, 1985 that it was negotiating to sell Loews Theatres to a group headed by A. Jerrold Perenchio. Loews Corporation by this time was a holding company owned by brothers Robert and Laurence Tisch that specialized in hotels and insurance. Perenchio completed the acquisition for $160 million on July 11.

On October 20, 1986, when federal regulations had been relaxed, Tri-Star Pictures, then a joint venture co-owned by The Coca-Cola Company (also owners of Columbia Pictures at the time) and Time Inc.&#x27;s HBO, entered an agreement to acquire Loews Theatre Management Corporation for $300 million; Tri-Star closed the acquisition in December. HBO left Tri-Star, which merged with Columbia Pictures in 1987, resulting in the formation of Columbia Pictures Entertainment. On May 26, 1987, Tri-Star said it planned to double the 300-screen chain&#x27;s size over the next year and a half through acquisitions and constructing new theaters. On January 25, 1988, Columbia agreed to acquire USA Cinemas Inc., with 325 screens, for $165 million; the acquisition was closed on March 2. Later in 1988, Loews bought 48 screens in the Washington, D.C. area from Roth Enterprises, M&amp;R Theatres with 70 screens in the Chicago area, and JF Theatres, Inc. with 66 screens in the Baltimore area. Upon the full acquisition of Tri-Star by Columbia Pictures, and when Columbia Pictures Entertainment (now Sony Pictures Entertainment) was bought from Coca-Cola by Sony in 1989, Sony inherited the theaters. 

On April 19, 1994, Loews announced it would change its name to Sony Theatres. On April 27, Sony partnered with basketball player Magic Johnson to form Magic Johnson Theatres, a mini-chain of theaters specifically geared toward the inner cities, particularly in Los Angeles. A year before, Sony Dynamic Digital Sound was installed in several theatres, since the parent company used it to promote Sony&#x27;s cinema sound division, which eventually shut down in 2002. Sony Theatres began reverting to the Loews Theatres name in October 1996.

In September 1997, Cineplex Odeon Corporation announced that it would merge with Loews Theatres for $1 billion; the merger was later approved by the United States Department of Justice on April 16, 1998 and was later completed that year to form Loews Cineplex Entertainment, thus making it a joint venture between Sony and Universal Studios. The combined company had theatres in the United States, Canada, Mexico, South Korea, and Spain. The company sold off its newly acquired subsidiary, Cineplex Odeon Films, to Alliance Atlantis, which was formed from the merger of Alliance Entertainment Corporation and Atlantis Communications that year. In 2001 the company declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Among the changes was the closures of 46 theatres in North America including 21 Loews theatres in the U.S. and 25 Cineplex Odeon theatres in Canada.

In 2002, Onex Corporation and Oaktree Capital Management acquired Loews Cineplex from Sony and Universal and the company was filed for initial public offering (IPO). In 2004, they sold Loews to a private group of investors which included the Carlyle Group and Bain Capital. Onex retained the Canadian Loews Cineplex and merged it with Galaxy Cinemas to form Cineplex Galaxy Income Fund.

In 2005, AMC Theatres announced that it would merge with Loews Cineplex Entertainment and that the merged company would adopt the AMC name. At the time of the merger, Loews operated 198 theaters with 2,235 screens. Many theaters were rebranded as AMC Loews until the Loews name was phased out in 2017.

<text>Cineplex Odeon Corporation was one of North America&#x27;s largest movie theatre operators and live theatre, with theatres in its home country of Canada and the United States. The Cineplex Odeon brand is still being used by Cineplex Entertainment at some theatres that were once owned by the Cineplex Odeon Corporation, with newer theatres using the Cineplex Cinemas () brand. The company was the result of Cineplex Corporation in 1984 purchasing and merging with Canadian Odeon Theatres, which itself was the result of a merger between Canadian Theatres and Odeon Theatres of Canada in 1978.

Theatres formerly operated by the company are now operated by Cineplex Entertainment in Canada and as AMC Theatres in the United States.

==History==
===Odeon Theatres of Canada===
Nathan Nathanson attempted to create a theatre chain with Fox Film, but was unable to due to the company entering receivership. Nathanson returned to the board of Famous Players and became its president in May 1933, resulting in the rest of the board resigning in protest. Holt and Ross, who left alongside Nathanson, returned with him. Zukor agreed to give control of the company back to Nathanson after the expiration of the voting trust on 8 March 1939. Barney Balaban replaced Zukor as president of Paramount-Publix Corporation in 1936, and rejected the agreement. Nathanson resigned from Famous Players on 14 May 1941, and Balaban selected J.J. Fitzgibbons to replace him. Nathanson worked on creating a new theatre chain while serving as president.

His brother, Henry Nathanson, formed Odeon Theatres in April 1941. It initially started with four theatres in Vancouver and expanded using equal partnerships with Henry Morton&#x27;s four theatres, Jack Barron&#x27;s theatre, and Henry Friedman&#x27;s theatre which were later bought out. Famous Players sued Nathan over the ownership of Regal Films, managed by Henry, in 1942, but the case was dismissed in 1948. Nathan attempted to hire Nat Taylor, but he rejected Taylor&#x27;s demands and Taylor was instead hired by Famous Players to manage 25 theatres.

Nicholas Schenck, the president of Loews, whose company owned Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer met with Nathanson, Fitzgibbons, Balaban, and other people in New York to allocate MGM films between Famous Players and Odeon months after Odeon was formed. Famous Players retained MGM&#x27;s films, but they would be distributed by Regal films.

Theatre construction fell during World War II with nine theatres being built between 1941 and 1944 due to a ban on constructing entertainment facilities. Odeon expanded their amount of theatres from 107 to 180 between 1946 and 1948. Odeon and Famous Players accounted for 60.8% of box-office receipts in 1947.

In the 1940s The Rank Organisation sought to expand into markets dominated by American companies. J. Arthur Rank became fifty-fifty partners with Nathanson on 24 November 1944. Paul Nathanson, Nathan Nathanson&#x27;s son, became the president of Odeon following Nathan&#x27;s death and served until he sold his 50% stake in the company to The Rank Organisation in April 1946. Odeon grew from 107 theaters at the time of Rank&#x27;s acquirement in 1946, to 180 theatres by 1948. Earl Lawson, a former parliamentarian and member of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett&#x27;s cabinet, was selected to replace Paul as president in 1946. The board under Rank included president of Canadian Pacific Railway D.C. Coleman, president of Imperial Oil R.V. LeSueur, and Rank lawyer Leonard Brockington. Leonard Brockington was appointed as president following Lawson&#x27;s death in 1950.

Rank controlled Odeon until January 1977, when they sold it, as Rank had stopped its activities in film production, to Michael Zahorchak for $31.2 million. Zahorchak combined his chain of 47 theatres with Odeon&#x27;s 131 theatres. He died in 1982, leaving control of the company to his family. The Zahorchak family sold the company to the Cineplex Corporation on 28 June 1984.

===Acquisition by Cineplex Corporation===
Taylor and Garth Drabinsky formed Cineplex in 1977, and started operating in April 1979 with the opening of its first theatre. The company received financial backing from the Bronfman family, Cadillac Fairview&#x27;s chair and chief executive officer John H. Daniels, and received a $1 million line of credit from the Toronto-Dominion Bank. The company grew to 202 theatres by July 1983. Taylor and Drabinsky also founded Pan-Canadian Film Distributors. Drabinsky threatened to sue American companies under the Sherman Antitrust Act if they did not provide first-run films to the Beverly Center.

The first Cineplex location, an 18-screen complex in the basement of the Toronto Eaton Centre, earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s largest cinema at the time of its opening. In July 1982 they opened their first theater in the United States, with a 14-screen multiplex in the newly built Beverly Center in Los Angeles, the largest in the US at the time. Also in 1982, the company listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange.

Cineplex was not financially successful and its debt rose to $24.6 million by the end of 1982 due to loans taken out with 22% interest rates. In September 1982, Pan-Canadian Film Distributors, Tiberius Productions, Toronto International Studios, Cineplex Theatres, and other companies were combined into Cineplex Corporation and the company went public in order afford its expenditures and continue expanding. 3,653,573 shares were issued with 18.92% held by Max Tanenbaum, 15.89% held by Taylor, and 19.88% held by Andrew Sarlos. Only $3.85 million was raised and the stock price fell from $5 upon opening to between $2 and $2.50 in August 1983. The Ontario Securities Commission ordered the company to stop trading shares five months after it went public.

The failure of the public venture resulted in Sarlos and Tanenbaum resigning from the board of directors and Barry Zuckerman, a principal shareholder, made a $1 million write-down for his investments. Drabinsky and Myron Gottlieb, vice-chair of the board, increased their share of the risk and the Beverly Center was sold to TTI Movies Limited Partnership for $4.33 million. The company almost fell into receivership.

An investigation into multiple distributors in Canada was launched by the Department of Consumer and Corporate Affairs against 20th Century Fox, Astral Films Limited, Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, United Artists, Universal Pictures, and Warner Bros. under the Combines Investigation Act in the 1980s. An application with the Restrictive Trade Practices Commission was filed on 22 December 1982, by the director of investigation and research. The distributors negotiated with the investigators rather than face trial in 1983, and they altered their theatrical distribution policies causing Cineplex to have better access to first-run films.

After successfully winning a legal challenge against the Famous Players/Canadian Odeon duopoly and their exclusive contracts with major studios, Cineplex acquired Odeon on 28 June 1984, for $22 million and taking on Odeon&#x27;s $35 million in debt. This increased its property ownership to 143 theatres, 383 screens, and 29 drive-in theatres. A lease with Landmark Cinemas in February 1985 added 22 screens. The Bronfman family was a major investor in the Odeon purchase.

Drabinsky fired two-thirds of the staff at the head-office and the remainder had their salaries cut. By 1984, the company had a profit of $12 million. From 1985 to 1986, profits rose by 153% to $31.6 million. Merrill Lynch predicted that by 1988, the company&#x27;s revenue would be above $659 million.

The company paid USD$2.3 million for the worldwide distribution rights for &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot; which was recovered by selling the home video rights to MCA.

===Expansion===
The company&#x27;s subsidiary in the United States purchased Plitt Theatres, the fourth-largest theatre chain in the country, for $136 million on 15 August 1985, which added 574 screens and 209 theatres. A New York investor group financed the Plitt Theatres purchase through a 50% partnership and the company reported record financial results in 1985. The Bank of America gave the company a $65 million line of credit before increasing it to $175 million over a ten-year period in 1987. The company&#x27;s total screen ownership rose from 1,060 in 1985, to 1,501 screens in 1987, making it the largest theatre chain in North America. MCA Inc. acquired a 50% equity interest in the company for $219 million which allowed Cineplex to purchase the equity interest from its New York investors.

In 1986, the company purchased the Loew chain of 222 screens for $325 million, RKO&#x27;s chain of 97 screens for $169 million and taking on its $97.3 million of debt, Neighborhood Cinema Group&#x27;s 67 screens for $21 million, and Essaness Theatres&#x27; 41 screens for $14.5 million. Walter Reade&#x27;s 143 screens were acquired for $32.5 million in 1987. The company&#x27;s debt increased to $650 million by 1989, resulting in MCA and Claridge forcing Drabinsky&#x27;s resignation on 1 December after he was unable to raise $1.1 billion.

The company was listed on the New York Stock Exchange in May 1987. They acquired 20 Circle Theatres in Washington DC and Maryland with 75 screens for $51 million in December 1987.

In 1986, the corporation established a film distribution outlet, Cineplex Odeon Films, and a home video distribution outlet, Cineplex Odeon Home Video (Later Cineplex Odeon Video) replacing Pan-Canadian Video Presentations. It distributed all titles in Canada on MCA&#x27;s behalf, but the film distribution outlet ceased operation in 1997 and the home video outlet a year later after MCA was renamed as Universal Studios. The company also operated Live Entertainment of Canada, which was established in 1989 after they acquired Pantages Theatre from Famous Players. Livent became an independent company after an internal conflict between Drabinsky and MCA.

Cineplex Odeon had grown to become one of the largest film exhibitors in North America by 1993, with 1,630 screens and operations in 365 locations within North America. At this point, Cineplex Odeon accounted for roughly 8% of box office revenues in North America, competing mostly with Famous Players in the Canadian market. Cineplex Odeon and Famous Players were two dominant forces in the Canadian film industry, with both organizations accounting for roughly two-thirds of the industry&#x27;s annual revenues. The key to the success of the two organizations was in large part due to their supply chain. Cineplex Odeon had exclusive first-run rights to films made by Columbia and Universal Studios, which allowed them to seize a hefty market share.

Controversy surrounded the practices of both Cineplex Odeon and Famous Players in 1998. The two companies had been accused of operating as a duopoly, and choking off the film supply so smaller theatres could not show the same products. Cineplex&#x27;s control over the market allowed them to increase prices. They were criticized, including by Mayor Ed Koch, for raising ticket prices from USD$5 to USD$7 in New York City.

In April 1998, Cineplex Odeon Theatres merged with New York City-based Loews Theatres (founded in 1904 by Marcus Loew) to form Loews Cineplex Entertainment. Alliance Atlantis purchased Cineplex Odeon Films assets along with its home video division the same year.

===Post Loews Cineplex Entertainment===
After the merger, the company ceased to exist and was merged into the operations of Loews Cineplex Entertainment. In 1999, Ellis Jacob and Steve Brown, former executives who left Cineplex Odeon Corporation during the ownership change, created Galaxy Entertainment designed to bring big-city entertainment to mid-sized markets across Canada. In 2001, Loews Cineplex Entertainment, the company that merged with Cineplex Odeon, filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy. Lowes Cineplex was later acquired by Onex Corporation and Oaktree Capital Management in 2002. In 2004, Onex decided to sell Loews Cineplex and retain the Canadian operations, merging then with Galaxy to form Cineplex Galaxy Income Fund (now Cineplex Entertainment). At the time of the merger, Cineplex Odeon operated 40 locations in Canada.

Cineplex Galaxy bought Famous Players for $500 million in June 2005.

<doc id="354995" wikidata="Q1278419" url="?curid=354995" title="Toronto Eaton Centre">
<text>CF Toronto Eaton Centre, commonly referred to simply as the Eaton Centre, is a shopping mall and office complex in the downtown core of Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It is owned and managed by Cadillac Fairview (CF). It was named after the Eaton&#x27;s department store chain that once anchored it before the chain went defunct in the late 1990s.

The Toronto Eaton Centre attracts more visitors than any of Toronto&#x27;s tourist attractions because it sits on top of two subway stations in downtown Toronto and is close to Union Station. It is North America&#x27;s busiest shopping mall when one counts the daily commuters along with tourist traffic. The mall has over 230 stores and restaurants in 2014.

==Location and access==
The main portion of the Toronto Eaton Centre complex is bounded by Yonge Street on the east, Queen Street West on the south, Dundas Street West on the north, and to the west by James Street and Trinity Square. There are three office towers, while the main retail mall in the centre is organized around a long arcade, running parallel to Yonge Street. The mall&#x27;s north street entrance (at Level 3) is one level higher than the south street entrance (at Level 2), given that the mall is built over the former Taddle Creek and the mall is thus on a gentle slope.

South of the main shopping arcade is the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Queen Street complex, including the Simpson Tower offices and flagship location of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay department store chain. Hudson&#x27;s Bay Queen Street is connected to the main retail mall (at Level 3) by a skywalk over Queen Street West and underground by Toronto&#x27;s Path network, and has been managed as part of the Eaton Centre since 2014 after being purchased by Cadillac Fairview. Hudson&#x27;s Bay Queen Street itself is bounded by Yonge Street to the east, Queen Street West to the north, Richmond Street West to the south, and Bay Street to the west.

The Toronto Eaton Centre&#x27;s interior passages also form part of the Path underground pedestrian network, and the centre is served by two subway stations: Dundas and Queen on Line 1 Yonge–University; Dundas station is connected to Level 1 (walkway under platform level) and Level 2 (platform level), while Queen station is connected to Level 1. The complex also contains four office buildings (at 20 Queen Street West, 250 Yonge Street, 1 Dundas Street West and 401 Bay Street) and Toronto Metropolitan University&#x27;s Ted Rogers School of Management. Additionally, the Toronto Eaton Centre is linked to a 17-storey Marriott hotel on Bay Street.

==History==
===Early plans===

Timothy Eaton founded a dry goods store on Yonge Street in the 19th century that revolutionized retailing in Canada and became the largest department store chain in the country. By the 20th century, the Eaton&#x27;s chain owned most of the land bounded by Yonge, Queen, Bay and Dundas streets, with the notable exceptions of Old City Hall and the Church of the Holy Trinity. The Eaton&#x27;s land, once the site of Timothy Eaton&#x27;s first store, was occupied by Eaton&#x27;s large Main Store, the Eaton&#x27;s Annex and a number of related mail order and factory buildings. As the chain&#x27;s warehouse and support operations were increasingly shifting to cheaper suburban locales in the 1960s, Eaton&#x27;s wanted to make better use of its valuable downtown landholdings. In particular, the chain wanted to build a massive new flagship store to replace the aging Main Store at Yonge and Queen streets and the Eaton&#x27;s College Street store a few blocks to the north.

In the mid-1960s, Eaton&#x27;s announced plans for a massive office and shopping complex that would occupy several city blocks. Eaton&#x27;s sought to demolish Toronto&#x27;s Old City Hall (except for the clock tower and cenotaph) and the Church of the Holy Trinity. The plan required the closing of a number of small city streets within the block: Albert Street, Louisa Street, Terauley Street (not to be confused with the stretch of Bay Street north of Queen Street, also formerly known as Terauley Street), James Street, Albert Lane, Downey&#x27;s Lane and Trinity Square. At one point, even the Old City Hall clock tower was to be demolished. After a fierce local debate over the fate of the city hall and church buildings, Eaton&#x27;s put its plans on hiatus in 1967.

The Eaton Centre plans were resuscitated in 1971, although these plans allowed for the preservation of Old City Hall. Controversy erupted anew, however, as the congregation of the Church of the Holy Trinity exhibited an increased willingness to fight the demolition plans for its church. Eventually, the Eaton Centre plans were revised to save Old City Hall and the church and then revised further when Holy Trinity&#x27;s parishioners successfully fought to ensure that the new complex would not block all sunlight to the church.

These amendments to the plans resulted in three significant changes to the proposed centre from the 1960s concept. First, the new Eaton&#x27;s store was shifted north to Dundas Street, as the new store would be too large to be accommodated in its existing location on Queen Street (opposite its rival Simpson&#x27;s, which is now the Hudson&#x27;s Bay store) as a result of the preservation of Old City Hall. This resulted in the mall being constructed with Eaton&#x27;s and Simpson&#x27;s acting as anchors at either end. The second significant change was the reduction in the size of the office component so that the Eaton Centre project no longer represented an attempt to extend the City&#x27;s financial district north of Queen Street, as the Eaton family had contemplated in the 1960s. Finally, the bulk of the centre was shifted east to the Yonge Street frontage, and the complex was designed so that it no longer had any frontage along Bay Street. Old City Hall and the church were thus saved, as was the Salvation Army headquarters building by virtue of its location between the two other preserved buildings (although the Salvation Army building was demolished in the late 1990s to make way for an Eaton Centre expansion, the Salvation Army&#x27;s Canadian head offices moved to Leaside, and a City of Toronto plaque was placed at the original site).

=== Name ===
At the time of the centre&#x27;s opening in 1977, the complex was marketed as &quot;The Eaton Centre&quot;, before changing its name to &quot;Toronto Eaton Centre&quot; in the early 1990s to disambiguate from other Eaton Centres across Canada.

Despite the bankruptcy of the Eaton&#x27;s department store chain in 1999 (and the closure of a short-lived Sears Canada-owned revival in 2002), the mall retained the Eaton Centre name, representing an ongoing tribute to Timothy Eaton and the small shop he once opened at this location. However, as Sears retained the Eaton&#x27;s trademarks and other intellectual property (IP), the name was used under licence until December 2016, when mall owner Cadillac Fairview acquired the Eaton&#x27;s IP outright.

In early 2014, mall management began an effort to enforce usage of the full &quot;Toronto Eaton Centre&quot; name. However, at that time, exterior signage was inconsistent as to the centre&#x27;s name, with signs facing Yonge–Dundas Square simply reading &quot;Eaton Centre&quot; while several others used the full name. Soon after, in September 2015, Cadillac Fairview announced it was rebranding all of its mall properties by adding the prefix &quot;CF&quot;; thus, the complex has subsequently been referred to as &quot;CF Toronto Eaton Centre&quot; by its owners. This branding was phased in on signage over the following year as renovations in the former Sears wing concluded.

===Construction===
Eaton&#x27;s partnered with the Cadillac Fairview development company and the Toronto-Dominion Bank in the construction of the Eaton Centre. The complex was designed by Eberhard Zeidler and Bregman + Hamann Architects as a multi-levelled, vaulted glass-ceiling galleria, modelled after the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, Italy. At the time, the interior design of the Eaton Centre was considered revolutionary and influenced shopping centre architecture throughout North America.

The first phase, including the nine-storey, Eaton&#x27;s store, opened in 1977. The temporary wall at the south end was mirrored over its full height to give an impression of what the complete galleria would look like. The old Eaton&#x27;s store at Yonge and Queen streets was then demolished and the south half of the complex opened in its place in 1979. The same year, the north end of the complex added a multiplex cinema, Cineplex, at the time the largest in the world with 18 screens.

Terauley Street, Louisa Street, Downey&#x27;s Lane and Albert Lane were closed and disappeared from the city street grid to make way for the new complex. Albert Street and James Street were preserved only to the extent of their frontage around Old City Hall (although at the request of the Church of the Holy Trinity, the city of Toronto required that pedestrians be able to cross through the mall where Albert Street once existed at all times, which is still possible). Trinity Square, however, lost its public access to Yonge Street and became a pedestrian-only square with access via Bay Street.

The exterior of the Eaton Centre store was designed in the style of the 1970s, intended at that time to be a statement of Eaton&#x27;s dominance and its aspirations. Urban planners and designers have lamented this original exterior design. The complex was oriented inwards, with very few street-facing retail stores, windows or even mall entrances to animate the exterior. Much of the Yonge Street façade, facing what was once one of Toronto&#x27;s primary shopping thoroughfares, was dominated by nine storey parking garage. At the insistence of the Metro Toronto government, which had jurisdiction over major roads and wanted right-of-way to add an additional lane to Yonge Street, the complex was set back a considerable distance from Yonge Street, thus further weakening the centre&#x27;s streetscape presence.

The office component of the complex was constructed over the years, as follows:
* &quot;One Dundas West&quot; (29 storeys) in 1977, designed by B+H Architects and Zeidler Partnership Architects;
* &quot;Cadillac Fairview Tower&quot; (36 storeys) in 1982, designed by Bregman + Hamann Architects, and Zeidler Partnership Architects;
* &quot;250 Yonge Street&quot; (formerly Eaton Tower) (35 storeys) in 1992, designed by Zeidler Partnership Architects, and Crang &amp; Boake; and
* &quot;Simpson Tower&quot; (33 storeys) at 401 Bay Street, completed in 1969 and became part of the Toronto Eaton Centre upon Cadillac Fairview&#x27;s acquisition of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay block in 2014.

===Early years===
Despite the controversy and criticisms, the centre was an immediate success, spawning many different shopping centres across Canada bearing the same brand name of Eaton. The mall&#x27;s profits were said to be so lucrative that it has often been credited with keeping the troubled Eaton&#x27;s chain afloat for another two decades before it succumbed to bankruptcy in 1999. Today, the Eaton Centre is one of North America&#x27;s top shopping destinations, and is Toronto&#x27;s most popular tourist attraction.

One of the most prominent sights in the shopping mall is the group of fibreglass Canada geese hanging from the glass ceiling. This group of sculptures, named &quot;Flight Stop&quot;, is the work of Canadian artist Michael Snow. It was also the subject of an important intellectual property court ruling. One year, the management of the centre decided to decorate the geese with red ribbons for the Christmas season, without consulting Snow. Snow sued, arguing that the ribbons made his naturalistic work &quot;ridiculous&quot; and harmed his reputation as an artist, and in &quot;Snow v Eaton Centre Ltd&quot;, the court ruled that even though Eaton Centre Limited owned the sculpture, the ribbons had infringed Snow&#x27;s moral rights. The ribbons were ordered removed.
===1990s and 2000s===
When the Eaton&#x27;s chain went bankrupt in 1999, many of its corporate assets were acquired by Sears Canada, which included the lease on the department store space at the north end of the mall, giving Sears a prime location in Toronto&#x27;s downtown core for the first time. Sears Canada briefly ran the department store as part of an upscale eatons mini-chain but by 2002 the store was rebranded to Sears. Sears Canada converted the uppermost four floors of the nine-storey department space to corporate offices, replacing their previous headquarters at 222 Jarvis Street, and the lowest floor was converted to mall retail space, but the resultant four-level department store was still Sears&#x27; largest in the world at about . Shortly after Sears&#x27; acquisition of Eaton&#x27;s, the statue of Timothy Eaton was moved from the Dundas Street entrance to the Royal Ontario Museum.

In the early 2000s, owner Cadillac Fairview redesigned the mall&#x27;s Yonge Street façade, bringing it closer to the street and making it more closely resemble an urban shopping district, with stores opening directly onto the street, and presenting a variety of façades to create the perception of an urban streetscape.
Further redevelopments, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, added new retail space. The west side of the complex, opposite Albert Street, was expanded. The glass atrium in the northeast corner at the intersection of Yonge and Dundas streets was redesigned, with a number of former tenants—including a Toronto Police Service office—relocated or evicted, to make way for H&amp;M&#x27;s Canadian flagship store designed by Queen&#x27;s Quay Architects International Inc.

One of the mall&#x27;s two parking garages, the nine-storey Dundas Parkade on Dundas Street with its two spiral stack ramps and the multiplex cinema below it, was demolished in 2003. In the place of the garage and of a vacant development site on the southeast corner of Dundas and Bay streets, a new wing of the Toronto Eaton Centre was opened in 2006, containing Canadian Tire and Best Buy, with Toronto Metropolitan University&#x27;s Faculty of Business and a new parking garage with 574 spaces on the upper levels. This work was done by Queen&#x27;s Quay Architects International Inc. with Zeidler Partnership Architects.

In 2014, the retail complex occupies about , making it the second-largest mall in Ontario (after Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga but ahead of Yorkdale Shopping Centre in Toronto&#x27;s north end).

====2010 revitalization project====
On June 18, 2010, Cadillac Fairview announced a two-year, renovation and revitalization plan for the mall. Upgrades include new flooring throughout, the redevelopment of the centre&#x27;s two existing food courts, upgrades and expansions to washroom facilities, lighting improvements, new railings, new entry doors, and green initiatives.

In June 2010, a would-be shopper was filmed shouting at the locked doors of an entrance to the Eaton Centre, which was in the process of entering lockdown as the G20 Summit street protests loomed nearby and was later uploaded to YouTube. The video quickly became an Internet meme, but was removed by the original poster shortly thereafter. However, the video has been re-uploaded hundreds of times by other users.

===Since 2010===
====2012 shooting====

On June 2, 2012, a shooting took place in the Urban Eatery food court while the mall was heavily crowded with shoppers. Seven people were shot: one of them, 24-year-old Ahmed Hassan, died at the scene while another, 22-year-old Nixon Nirmalendran, died at a hospital on June 11, 2012. According to Toronto Police Chief Bill Blair, Hassan and Nirmalendran may have had gang affiliations and both were targeted, although in at least Nirmalendran&#x27;s case this view has been challenged. Others were injured in the panic as people fled the area, including a 28-year-old pregnant woman who began undergoing labour but did not give birth.

Two days after the shooting, 23-year-old Christopher Husbands turned himself in to authorities and was charged with first-degree murder. He was found guilty of second-degree murder and guilty of five counts of aggravated assault, one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and one count of reckless discharge of a firearm. At the time of the shooting, he was under house arrest. Four months prior to the shooting, he had survived an attack in which he was beaten and stabbed more than twenty-five times by six associates. Jessica Ghawi, an American tourist who had left the food court minutes prior to the shooting, was killed seven weeks later in a mass shooting at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado. In April 2015, Husbands was sentenced to 30 years-to-life imprisonment.

Husbands was granted a new trial in July 2017 as the Ontario Court of Appeal stated the judge had made a mistake in their decision to deny &quot;rotating triers&quot; in selecting the jury. Originally convicted of second-degree murder, Husbands&#x27;s lawyer stated, &quot;He experienced auditory and visual hallucinations. He has no memory of the events that followed inside the food court.&quot; They are making the case that his actions were a result of disassociation, a form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), caused from being stabbed 20 times earlier that year, and therefore should not be held criminally responsible for the casualties and assaults. It was the same defense used during his first trial.

In late November 2019, Husbands was found guilty of two counts of manslaughter, five counts of aggravated assault and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and reckless discharge of a firearm. On the manslaughter convictions, Husbands was sentenced to life in prison with eligibility of parole by 2021.

====Sears closure to present====

It was announced on October 29, 2013, that Sears Canada would close its flagship location at the mall. On January 15, 2014, Nordstrom announced that it would be taking over some of the space vacated by Sears. The former lower level of Sears (part of Level 1 and part of Level 2 of the mall) was replaced with various retailers, which opened in fall 2015. Examples of these retailers included Lush, GameStop, and Showcase. Afterwards, a three-floor Nordstrom opened in fall 2016 alongside Uniqlo, an expanded H&amp;M and a Samsung Store. The Samsung Store was closed in fall 2023 and is replaced with a BMO that opened in late 2024.

In January 2014, Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company announced it would sell the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Queen Street complex, including the Simpson Tower offices and Queen Street West location of its namesake department store, to Cadillac Fairview and lease the site for 25 years. Prior to this transaction, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Queen Street complex had separate management/ownership and was not considered part of the Eaton Centre, nonetheless, it was connected to the Eaton Centre via a pedestrian bridge and underground Path. After the sale closed, the Queen Street complex department store space was renovated to accommodate the first Canadian location of Saks Fifth Avenue, a chain also owned by Hudson&#x27;s Bay. The pedestrian bridge over Queen Street linking the Eaton Centre and the Hudson&#x27;s Bay store, which had been in service since the 1970s, was replaced by a new skywalk that opened in 2017.
Free Wi-Fi became available throughout the Eaton Centre in late 2014. Before then, free Wi-Fi was only available in larger restaurants, Indigo Books and Music, and the Apple Store. The Eaton Centre&#x27;s free Wi-Fi requires a Facebook account, a Twitter/X account, or an e-mail address to access.

A small part of the northern end of the Toronto Eaton Centre&#x27;s Level 3 was set aside for the official 2015 Pan American Games pop-up shop during June and July 2015, and during the 2015 Parapan American Games in August.

The Toronto Eaton Centre was closed during June 2020 amid both the COVID-19 pandemic and the George Floyd protests and reopened in July 2020. One of the stores above the Urban Eatery was replaced with additional public food court space to allow for social distancing, though that additional food court space closed again amid the second wave of the pandemic per provincial policy as Toronto underwent another COVID-19-related lockdown.

On the evening of September 20, 2022, a multi-vehicle fire occurred in the upper levels of the mall&#x27;s parking garage and shoppers had to be evacuated.

On March 2, 2023, Nordstrom announced that it would be closing all Canadian stores, including its Eaton Centre location. The store closed on June 13, 2023. From late 2023 to early 2024, the first floor of the former Nordstrom was used as a temporary exhibit themed to the aurora borealis called Canadian Chroma. In June 2024, La Maison Simons and Eataly announced that they will open in the former Nordstrom area in 2025.

==Food courts==

As part of a $120 million renovation, the Eaton Centre replaced the aging food courts at each end of the mall with one larger new food court in the north, which opened in September 2011, and a relocated and expanded Richtree Market restaurant at the south end, which opened on September 9, 2013. However, Richtree Market permanently closed on March 9, 2020, amid the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Toronto.

===Urban Eatery===
The new north food court, the Urban Eatery, located under Level 1, features typical food court outlets, outlets of smaller Toronto-based chains, and international-style cuisine. There are 900 seats spread over more than and 24 outlets within the Eatery. Some of the more notable restaurants in the Eatery include A&amp;W, Chick-fil-A, KFC, McDonald&#x27;s, New York Fries, Sbarro, Subway, and Tim Hortons.

Disposable packaging has been mostly replaced with cutlery and plastic cups and dishes; the area began with over 100,000 dishes and 20,000 cups. There are no garbage or recycling receptacles in the Urban Eatery; patrons bring their food trays to staffed collection stations, where items are sorted. A pulping machine makes 90 percent of the mall&#x27;s food waste pulpable, and a solid waste compactor reduces the content of 50 bags of garbage into no more than two bags of pulp.

Canadian sporting goods retailer Sport Chek is the only non-food retailer located in the Urban Eatery.

===Queen&#x27;s Cross===

On April 24, 2024, the former Richtree Natural Market Restaurant was replaced by Queen&#x27;s Cross Food Hall. The food hall is operated by Oliver &amp; Bonacini and provides 13 food stalls, a cafe and a bar.

<text>The T. Eaton Company Limited, later known as Eaton&#x27;s and then Eaton, was a Canadian department store chain that was once the largest in the country. It was founded in 1869 in Toronto by Timothy Eaton, an immigrant from what is now Northern Ireland. Eaton&#x27;s grew to become a retail and social institution in Canada, with stores across the country, buying-offices around the globe, and a mail-order catalog that was found in the homes of most Canadians. A changing economic and retail environment in the late twentieth century, along with mismanagement, culminated in the chain&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1999.

Eaton&#x27;s pioneered several retail innovations. In an era when haggling for goods was the norm, the chain proclaimed &quot;We propose to sell our goods for CASH ONLY – In selling goods, to have only one price.&quot; In addition, it had the long-standing slogan &quot;Goods Satisfactory or Money Refunded.&quot;

==Early years==

In 1869, Timothy Eaton sold his interest in a small dry-goods store in the market town of St. Marys, Ontario, and he bought a dry-goods and haberdashery business at 178 Yonge Street in the city of Toronto.

The first store was only , with two shop windows, and was located a fair distance from Toronto&#x27;s then fashionable shopping district of King Street West. In its first year of operation, with Timothy Eaton responsible for buying the goods to stock the store, and a staff of four, expectations were low that a store with a no-credit and no-haggling policy would succeed.

The business prospered, and Eaton moved the store one block north in August 1883 into much larger premises at 190 Yonge Street. The new store boasted the biggest plate-glass windows in Toronto, the first electric lights in any Canadian store, three full floors of retail space featuring 35 departments, and a lightwell that ran the full length of the store. The store&#x27;s first telephone, with phone number 370, was installed in 1885. In 1886, the first elevator in a retail establishment in Toronto was installed in the Eaton store (although only customers going up were invited to use the elevator, thus requiring them to pass by the various store displays on their walk down).

Eaton maintained the lease on the empty store at 178 Yonge Street (now Hudson&#x27;s Bay Queen Street and once home to rival Eaton’s) until its expiry in 1884 in order to delay the expansion plans of one of his competitors, Robert Simpson. Over time, the competition between the Simpson&#x27;s and Eaton&#x27;s department stores, facing each other across Queen Street West, became one of Toronto&#x27;s great business rivalries. The pedestrian crosswalk on Queen Street West, just to the west of the intersection with Yonge Street, was for years one of the busiest in Canada, as thousands of shoppers a day comparison-shopped between Eaton&#x27;s and Simpson&#x27;s.

By 1896, Eaton&#x27;s was billing itself as &quot;Canada&#x27;s Greatest Store&quot;. The store continued to expand in size, and new buildings were constructed to house the mail order division and the Eaton&#x27;s factories. The number of people employed in Eaton&#x27;s operations numbered 17,500 in 1911. In 1919, the Eaton&#x27;s buildings in Toronto contained a floor space of over , and occupied several city blocks between Yonge Street and Bay Street, north of Queen Street West.

==The Winnipeg store==
At the beginning of the 20th century, Eaton&#x27;s conducted a large business in Western Canada through its catalogue. Eaton&#x27;s considered Winnipeg, Manitoba, as the most logical location for a new mail order warehouse to better serve its western customers. A store was not originally part of the plans.

John Craig Eaton, the son of Timothy Eaton, became an early proponent of building a combined store and mail order operation in Winnipeg. Although Timothy Eaton initially had misgivings over the difficulties involved in managing a store from Toronto, John Craig was eventually able to convince his father. Eaton&#x27;s acquired a city block on Portage Avenue at Donald Street, and the five-storey Eaton&#x27;s store opened to much fanfare on July 15, 1905. Timothy Eaton and his family were on hand for the opening of the second Eaton&#x27;s store, with the &quot;Winnipeg Daily Tribune&quot; noting in its front-page headline: &quot;The Canadian Napoleon of Retail Commerce Reaches the Capital – Views His Great Store for First Time – Well Pleased&quot;.

The landmark red brick store, known as &quot;the Big Store&quot; to Winnipeggers, was a success. The initial staff of 750 grew to 1,200 within a few weeks of the opening. By 1910, three more storeys were added to the store and other buildings were constructed. By 1919, the Eaton&#x27;s operations in Winnipeg covered and employed 8,000 people.

For many years, the Winnipeg Eaton&#x27;s store was considered the most successful department store in the world, given how it dominated its local market. As late as the 1960s, &quot;Canadian Magazine&quot; estimated that Winnipeggers spent more than 50 cents of every shopping dollar (excluding groceries) at Eaton&#x27;s, and that on a busy day, one out of every ten Winnipeggers would visit the Portage Avenue store.

The store was closed on 17 October 1999, along with 36 other Eaton&#x27;s stores.

==Overseas buying offices==
Eaton&#x27;s had two buying offices located in Europe: in London, in 7 Warwick Lane, opened in 1892; and Paris, at 103 rue Reaumur, opened six years later in 1898.

==Canada&#x27;s dominant retailer==

The success of Eaton&#x27;s helped revolutionize department store retailing in North America. American retailers flocked to view the stores on Yonge Street and Portage Avenue, anxious to replicate Timothy Eaton&#x27;s methods south of the border. Until the 1950s, Eaton&#x27;s promoted itself as the &quot;largest retail organization in the British Empire&quot;.

In 1905, &quot;The Globe&quot; wrote: &quot;There is hardly a name in Canada, with the possible exception of the Prime Minister, so well known to the people at large as that of Mr. Timothy Eaton.&quot; Timothy Eaton died in 1907, and was succeeded by John Craig Eaton as President of the T. Eaton Co. Limited. The company&#x27;s success continued under Timothy&#x27;s heir.

In 1925, Eaton&#x27;s purchased the Goodwin&#x27;s store in Montreal. By 1927, Montreal boasted a new six-storey Eaton&#x27;s store on Saint Catherine Street, which was expanded to nine storeys in 1930. Over time, Eaton&#x27;s stores opened in other cities across the country, the company offered numerous private label products, e.g., an &quot;Eaton&#x27;s&quot; typewriter, a rebadged Silverette model by Silver Seiko Ltd. of Japan.

In 1977, the Toronto Eaton Centre opened in downtown Toronto, replacing two previous downtown Eaton&#x27;s stores. The complex—stretching on multiple levels between Dundas and Queen Streets and boasting 200 stores—was anchored at the north end by a nine-storey Eaton&#x27;s store.

Eaton&#x27;s sold private label appliances under the &quot;Viking&quot; label. These were largely manufactured by White. Many products were sold with the brand name “TECO”, an acronym for Timothy Eaton Company.

==The Eaton&#x27;s catalogue==
The first Eaton&#x27;s catalogue was a 34-page booklet issued in 1884. As Eaton&#x27;s grew, so did the catalogue. By 1920, Eaton&#x27;s operated mail order warehouses in Winnipeg, Toronto and Moncton to serve its catalogue customers. Catalogue order offices were also established throughout the country, with the first opening in Oakville in 1916.

At a time when Canada&#x27;s population was predominantly rural, often living in isolated settlements, the Eaton&#x27;s catalogue provided a selection of goods that was otherwise unavailable to many Canadians, much like the Sears Roebuck catalog in the United States. It served an important economic role, as it broke local monopolies and allowed all Canadians access to the prices and selection enjoyed in some of the larger cities. The catalogue offered everything from clothing to farming implements. Some Canadians even purchased their homes from the catalogue, with Eaton&#x27;s delivering to them all the materials necessary to build a prefabricated house. Today, a large number of Eaton&#x27;s catalogue homes still exist throughout the country, primarily in the West. The catalogue had many other uses, ranging from its use as a learning tool by settlers learning to speak English, to its use as goalie pads during hockey games.

The catalogue became an icon of Canadian culture, even appearing in many works of Canadian literature. In Roch Carrier&#x27;s autobiographical short story &quot;The Hockey Sweater&quot;, a young Quebec boy asks his mother for a Montreal Canadiens hockey jersey from the Eaton&#x27;s catalogue, but receives a Toronto Maple Leafs jersey instead. As the family is francophone, the mother does not order using the catalogue forms (which are in English only) but instead writes a note and sends money to the department store. Because of the prevalent language and cultural barriers of the English and French-speaking Canadian populations, his family is unaware that the item could be exchanged, and they do not wish to offend Mr. Eaton by returning it. Carrier ends up being ostracized by his peers as a result.

Over time, the catalogue became a less profitable operation, and by the 1970s, it was a money-losing proposition. As Canada&#x27;s population became more urban over the course of the 20th century, Canadians had access to a greater number of local stores, and were less reliant on catalogue purchases. By the mid-1970s, it was estimated that 60% of the suburban customers throughout Canada lived within a thirty-minute drive of an Eaton&#x27;s store. Others blamed Eaton&#x27;s management for the catalogue&#x27;s failures, pointing to the similar Simpsons-Sears catalogue (later the Sears Canada catalogue), which continued until a much later date even though it never enjoyed the iconic status or popularity of the Eaton&#x27;s catalogue.

At a news conference on January 14, 1976, Eaton&#x27;s announced that the 1976 spring-summer catalogue would be their last. 9000 mail-order employees were out of work and many Eaton&#x27;s catalogue stores in smaller towns closed as a result. Many Canadians were in shock. In one notable incident, Barbara Frum of CBC Radio’s &quot;As It Happens&quot; opened her interview of Eaton&#x27;s president Earl Orser with the question &quot;Mr. Orser, how could you?&quot;

==The Toronto Santa Claus Parade==

Eaton sponsored the annual Eaton&#x27;s Santa Claus Parade in Toronto. The first parade took place on December 2, 1905. For a number of years, Eaton&#x27;s Santa Claus Parades were also held in Winnipeg and Montreal.

By the 1950s, the Toronto parade was the largest in North America, stretching for a mile and a half and involving thousands of participants. It was broadcast live on radio and television in Canada, and CBS television in the United States broadcast the parade for a number of years.

To publicize the parade, Eaton&#x27;s published a number of books and records about a sad little bear called Punkinhead (originally created by Charles Thorson) who becomes Santa&#x27;s sidekick and takes part in Santa&#x27;s parade. A Punkinhead character was included in the parade for many years.

In August 1982, Eaton&#x27;s announced that it would no longer sponsor the Santa Claus Parade, due to increasing costs. A consortium of local businesses saved the parade, which continues to be held every year.

==Decline==

===Unsuccessful expansion===
In the 1970s, Eaton&#x27;s tried to expand its reach in Canadian retailing by opening a chain of discount or &quot;junior&quot; department stores called Horizon. The Horizon chain was closed in 1978.

In the 1970s and 1980s, through the provincial government&#x27;s Ontario Downtown Renewal Program, Eaton&#x27;s was a partner in the development of downtown malls in smaller cities, intended to foster the revitalization of urban cores. As the chain formed the anchor of many of these shopping centres, these often carried the &quot;Eaton Centre&quot; name. Nearly all these malls—in cities such as Sarnia, Brantford, Guelph and Peterborough—had high vacancy rates and poor patronage, and contributed to the store&#x27;s financial problems.

===Suburban competition===
The economic recession of the early 1980s hurt the company. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, Sears Canada, and Zellers all took market share from Eaton&#x27;s. By the 1990s, American retailers, most notably Walmart, were expanding into Canada, and Eaton&#x27;s found it increasingly difficult to compete.

Retailing and land use trends in the last decades of the 20th century did not favour Eaton&#x27;s. Traditional department stores, including Eaton&#x27;s, commanded an ever-shrinking share of the Canadian retail dollar, as big-box stores, such as Wal-Mart and Zellers, and specialty stores expanded their shares of retail sales. With the advent of urban sprawl, most Canadian downtown shopping districts (which were historically dominated by Eaton&#x27;s) had to increasingly share retail sales with growing suburban shopping areas, where Eaton&#x27;s was just one of many competitors.

===Family mismanagement===
Eaton&#x27;s difficulties were not all caused by external forces. Poor management by the last two generations of Eaton family members to run the chain contributed to the demise of Eaton&#x27;s. Stores that once served as landmarks in their communities were not renovated. New Eaton&#x27;s stores built since the 1960s were largely indistinguishable from other chain stores, further reducing Eaton&#x27;s status as a destination.

The end of the catalogue and of the Eaton&#x27;s Santa Claus parades, though being cost-saving measures, ensured Eaton&#x27;s no longer held the same place in Canadians&#x27; hearts.

The chain that had touted itself in the 1940s and 1950s as &quot;The Store for Young Canada&quot; lost touch with younger customers, and unintentionally became known as a chain that catered to older shoppers. Once known for its superior customer service (with its staff proudly known as &quot;Eatonians&quot;), Eaton&#x27;s began to cut back on sales staff and training in an effort to trim costs. A chain that had once prided itself on its buying offices throughout the globe and on the unique and diverse goods that it offered its customers had, by the latter half of the twentieth century, an antiquated supply chain and a haphazard and confused approach to merchandising.

In one particularly disastrous move, Eaton&#x27;s moved to an &quot;Everyday Value Pricing&quot; strategy (also known as &quot;Eaton Value&quot;) in 1991, which meant that all discounts and sales, including Eaton&#x27;s famous Trans-Canada Sale, were eliminated. The strategy quickly drove away customers, but was continued for four years before it was abandoned.

In 1997, seeing the success of The Bay in higher-end retailing, Eaton&#x27;s lured their chief executive George Kosich over to try to duplicate the strategy. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company filed a lawsuit saying that Kosich had violated his employment contract. Eaton&#x27;s had also sued HBC for poaching several of its executives. Aside from that controversy, the new retailing strategy was not only unsuccessful, it also gave rival Sears Canada the opportunity to move up to the market segment long dominated by Eaton&#x27;s. Kosich resigned in 1998 and was replaced by chairman Brent Ballantyne.

==Bankruptcy==

The chain, which controlled almost 60% of all department store sales in Canada in 1930, had been reduced to a market share of 10.6% in 1997. The T. Eaton Co. first filed for bankruptcy protection in 1997. At the time, the company had an estimated 24,500 employees and over 90 retail outlets. The plan was to close 31 underperforming stores, including two-thirds of its stores in Alberta. However, Eaton&#x27;s limited the number of store closures to 17. George Eaton, the last of the family to be involved in management, resigned as chief executive in 1997, being succeeded by George Kosich. In September of that year, creditors approved the restructuring plan.

In 1998, George Kosich resigned as chairman of the board and was succeeded by Brent Ballantyne, under whom the company was taken public for the first time in its history, issuing 11.7 million common shares at $15 each, while the Eaton family retained control with a 51 percent stake.

The chain finally folded in 1999 after operating for 130 years. Though it had reduced its retail outlets, it finished 1998 with a net loss of $72 million, and it announced further closures and a corporate restructuring plan. This was unsuccessful and the company went bankrupt in August 1999. It had at the time 64 department stores, two home stores and one warehouse.

By late October 1999, nearly all of the Eaton&#x27;s stores had been liquidated and closed. The only stores with the Eaton&#x27;s name that were left in the country at this point were five suburban locations at Brentwood Mall, St. Vital Centre, Galeries de la Capitale, Westmount Shopping Centre and Sherway Gardens that were being operated by Sears Canada while waiting approval to officially acquire them. In early October 1999, Sears reverted to regular prices the merchandise in these five stores (still under the Eaton&#x27;s banner) while the rest of the chain run by T. Eaton Co. continued in parallel its liquidation sale in the other locations with goods up to 70% off.

===Acquisition by Sears===

In September 1999, Sears Canada purchased all the shares of T. Eaton Co., eight of its stores, with the option to buy five more, and the Eaton&#x27;s name, trademarks, brands, and website in a $30-million deal. In October 1999, Sears Canada added five downtown stores to the suburban locations it had purchased earlier in September with an option to buy yet another Eaton&#x27;s outlet. The acquisition of Eaton&#x27;s assets by Sears Canada was officially approved in November 1999. The ten suburban locations that Sears Canada acquired would be converted to its nameplate while the six downtown stores would operate under the Eaton&#x27;s banner. However, it was later decided that the suburban Yorkdale location would be run as a Eaton&#x27;s store instead of a Sears contrary to what had originally been stated, thus bringing to seven the number of Eaton&#x27;s-branded outlets. Most of the locations that Sears Canada acquired were closed down in October 1999 by the T. Eaton Company itself before getting renovated and eventually reopening as Sears or Eaton&#x27;s stores. However, five of the suburban locations would directly be rebranded as Sears stores without closing. Moreover, the suburban locations at Scarborough Town Centre and Halifax Shopping Centre were acquired to actually relocate existing Sears stores with their employees to the much larger former Eaton&#x27;s spaces of these same malls (this was also the original plan for Yorkdale). Finally, it was announced in December 1999 that two leases formerly occupied by Eaton&#x27;s at Guildford Town Centre and Don Mills Centre would become Sears stores but these two were separate arrangements with the landlords of the respective shopping malls and, as such, not part of the 16 locations acquired by Sears Canada from T. Eaton Company.

Through its new Eaton&#x27;s chain, Sears held a number of prime locations in Toronto (Eaton Centre and Yorkdale), Vancouver (Pacific Centre), Victoria (Eaton Centre), Winnipeg (Polo Park), Ottawa (Rideau Centre), and Calgary (Eaton Centre). Sears had intended to obtain the former downtown Montreal store, although it lost out to Les Ailes de la Mode. Sears had great ambitions for its seven Eaton&#x27;s stores which included staffing them with spas, entertainment, food, personal-shopping assistants and brand-name merchandise. The Eaton&#x27;s catalogue and website would be relaunched as well. However, Sears had trouble securing name brand merchandise consistent with the image of the new chain. This was mainly because of Eaton&#x27;s bankruptcy. It was also because of doubt in Sears&#x27; ability to manage an upper-end chain, since until recently their merchandise was of lower price and quality compared to the old Eaton&#x27;s and The Bay. George Heller, then-president of rival department store The Bay, publicly warned vendors not to supply the new Eaton&#x27;s with merchandise. Many mid-to-upper tier brands, particularly in clothing, feared reprisal and avoided the new Eaton&#x27;s.

The new Eaton&#x27;s was scheduled to open September 1, 2000, but was pushed back three times, eventually opening November 25. Consequently, Eaton&#x27;s had missed much of the lucrative holiday season and opened with merchandise already marked down. Construction was haphazard; all stores opened unfinished and renovations would continue well into 2001.

The seven-store experiment was not successful, and Sears Canada President Paul Walters was forced to resign. He was replaced by a former rival and Sears Roebuck executive from the U.S., Mark Cohen, who prioritized Sears over Eaton&#x27;s and cut back aggressively on markdown strategies. By March 2001 Sears announced they were ceasing publication of the newly resurrected Eaton&#x27;s catalogue &quot;due to a lack of interest&quot;. Although Mark Cohen officially announced that the Eaton&#x27;s chain had seen an impressive rebound in June 2001, by 2002 he retired the &quot;Eaton&#x27;s&quot; name.

Of the seven locations involved in this experiment, those in Winnipeg and Victoria, which were close to existing Sears stores (and, in the case of Winnipeg, in the same mall) were sold to rival department store The Bay. Yorkdale likewise already had a Sears (as well as The Bay) and so the Eaton&#x27;s space was redeveloped for smaller retailers. The four remaining locations were rebranded as Sears, but ultimately all closed between 2008 and 2015 as Sears itself faced difficulties. These spaces were subsequently taken over mainly by Holt Renfrew (Calgary) and Nordstrom (in Ottawa, Vancouver, and downtown Toronto), though Sears Canada retained the top floors of the former Toronto Eaton Centre location for its head offices.

Sears Canada&#x27;s difficulties continued throughout the 2010s; the company filed for creditor protection in June 2017, forcing it to put all its stores in liquidation by October that year. On January 14, 2018, Sears Canada went out of business and permanently closed all its remaining stores, succumbing to the same fate as Eaton&#x27;s had 19 years earlier.

==Legacy==
Eaton&#x27;s transformed retailing in Canada, and its methods were eagerly adopted by retailers throughout the world. Many approaches to sales and service that are taken for granted by customers today were originally popularised by Timothy Eaton and his store.

Many Canadians, particularly older Canadians, have fond memories of the Eaton&#x27;s stores and the catalogue. Few defunct companies evoke the same strong emotions among Canadians as does Eaton&#x27;s.

Two shopping centres in Canada continue to be called Eaton Centres, namely the Toronto Eaton Centre and the Montreal Eaton Centre, located in those cities&#x27; downtown cores. The Toronto Eaton Centre is a tourist attraction in Toronto, with over one million visitors a week.

===Architecture===

Eaton&#x27;s leaves an architectural legacy, primarily through the work of the architecture firm Ross and Macdonald. Eaton&#x27;s College Street in Toronto, opened in 1930, is a highly regarded Art Deco building, and is currently used as a retail, office and residential complex. The Seventh Floor, occupied by the Eaton Auditorium and the Round Room restaurant, was recently restored and now operates as The Carlu event venue. In 1971, the Eaton&#x27;s / John Maryon Tower near Eaton&#x27;s College Street was proposed by Eaton&#x27;s and a developer named John Maryon, but it was never built.

The former downtown Eaton&#x27;s store in Montreal, also designed by Ross and Macdonald, remains a landmark on Saint Catherine Street and is now an extension of the Montreal Eaton Centre, although only the outer building&#x27;s shell (excluding the top floor) remains. Preserved within the top floor is the former Ninth Floor Restaurant, which had been closed to the public since Eaton&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1999. It reopened in 2024 after extensive restoration and renovation work and now a venue space for special events and a small restaurant called &quot;Ile de France&quot; (the original restaurant space has been repurposed as an events hall). It is protected as a registered historical site because of its rich Art deco design.

Another Ross and Macdonald-designed landmark, the former Eaton&#x27;s store in downtown Saskatoon, now serves as the offices of the Saskatoon Board of Education after housing an Army &amp; Navy department store for decades following Eaton&#x27;s relocation to Midtown Plaza in the 1960s.

The long-time Downtown Calgary store, designed by Ross and Macdonald in the 1920s, was largely demolished in 1988, although two facades were preserved and incorporated into a new Holt Renfrew store as part of a redevelopment of Calgary Eaton Centre (in 2009 Holt Renfrew re-opened in what was once Eaton&#x27;s second downtown location).

The original downtown Vancouver store, on Hastings Street, also remains and now serves as the downtown Harbour Centre campus of Simon Fraser University. Some Vancouver residents associate this heritage building with the Spencer&#x27;s Department Store (which commissioned the construction of the store), rather than Eaton&#x27;s (which bought Spencer&#x27;s in 1948 and occupied the store until the 1970s). In fact, the former Eaton&#x27;s store is today known as the Spencer Building.

Not all former Eaton&#x27;s stores are architectural landmarks: the stores constructed from the 1960s onwards were typically architecturally inferior to their predecessors. Notably, the exterior of the Toronto Eaton Centre store can best be described as a mustard-coloured box and is generally considered (from an architectural perspective) to be a poor replacement for the demolished Main Store. Designed in the style of the 1970s and intended at that time to be a statement of Eaton&#x27;s dominance and its future aspirations, the modern design of this behemoth has not aged well (despite efforts by Sears Canada in 1999–2000 to improve the look of the building facades). Similarly, the main Vancouver store, connected to the downtown Pacific Centre mall, was also built in the 1970s as a large, white box.

After the demise of Eaton&#x27;s, most stores were converted to other retail banners or other uses, with the downtown Winnipeg store generating the most controversy. When the store was emptied in late 1999, various alternative uses for the building (including residential condominiums) were considered, and ultimately all rejected. After a highly emotional civic debate, which included a &quot;group hug&quot; of the &quot;Big Store&quot; by hundreds of people in 2001, the store was demolished in 2002 to make way for a hockey arena, the MTS Centre. In one concession to history, red bricks were incorporated into the design of the arena façade, evoking the memory of the Eaton&#x27;s store that had once graced Portage Avenue.

===Timothy Eaton statue===

In 1919, two life-sized statues of Timothy Eaton were donated by Eaton&#x27;s employees to the Toronto and Winnipeg stores, in celebration of the 50th anniversary of the company. The Toronto statue is now exhibited in the Royal Ontario Museum. The Winnipeg statue was housed in the suburban Polo Park Mall for a few years after 1999, until the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company opened a Bay store at that location and wanted the statue of its former competitor removed. After a tussle with the Eaton family, who wanted to move the statue to St Marys, Ontario, the Manitoba government declared it a provincial heritage object. It now sits in the city&#x27;s primary arena, Canada Life Centre, one floor up from nearly the same spot where it stood in the old store. People often rubbed the toe of the statue&#x27;s left shoe since it is believed by some to bring good luck to do so. As a result, the toe is much shinier than any other part of the statue.

===Unsuccessful catalogue revival===
In early 2008 &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; reported a possible revival of the Eaton&#x27;s brand by Sears Canada. The company was considering reviving the defunct catalogue with an online presence. The chain&#x27;s intellectual property subsidiary applied for new trademarks incorporating the name &quot;Timothy Eaton&quot;, and continued to pursue registration of these into early 2009. The trademark lapsed and was abandoned by late 2013.

In December 2016, a few months before its filing for creditor protection and subsequent liquidation, Sears Canada sold the remaining Eaton&#x27;s intellectual property to a company affiliated with Cadillac Fairview, the current owner of the Toronto Eaton Centre.

<text>The Bank of Nova Scotia (), operating as Scotiabank (), is a Canadian multinational banking and financial services company headquartered in Toronto, Ontario. One of Canada&#x27;s Big Five banks, it is the third-largest Canadian bank by deposits and market capitalization. In 2023, the company&#x27;s seat in Forbes Global 2000 was 88. It serves more than 25 million customers around the world and offers a range of products and services including personal and commercial banking, wealth management, corporate and investment banking. With more than 89,000 employees and assets of CA$1,399 billion as of April 30, 2024 (according to Q2-2024 Report to Shareholders), Scotiabank trades on the Toronto () and New York () exchanges. The Scotiabank swift code is NOSCCATT and the institution number is 002.

Scotiabank was founded in 1832 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where it was headquartered until relocating to Toronto in 1900. Scotiabank has billed itself as &quot;Canada&#x27;s most international bank&quot; due to its acquisitions primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean, and also in Europe and parts of Asia. Scotiabank is a member of the London Bullion Market Association and one of fifteen accredited institutions which participate in the London gold fixing. From 1997 to 2019, this was conducted through its precious metals division ScotiaMocatta.

Scotiabank&#x27;s president and CEO Brian J. Porter announced his retirement to be effective January 31, 2023, and Scott Thompson was named as his replacement.

==History==
===19th century===
The Bank of Nova Scotia was founded in 1832 in Halifax, Nova Scotia, a British colony at that time. The bank was incorporated by the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia on March 30, 1832. William Lawson was the first president. The bank intended to facilitate the trans-Atlantic trade of the time. Later, in 1883, the Bank of Nova Scotia acquired the Union Bank of Prince Edward Island, although most of the bank&#x27;s expansion efforts in the century took the form of branch openings.

The bank launched its branch banking system by opening in Windsor, Nova Scotia. The expansion was limited to the Maritimes until 1882, when the bank moved west by opening a branch in Winnipeg, which later closed, but the bank continued to expand into the American Midwest. This included opening a branch in Minneapolis in 1885, which later transferred to Chicago in 1892. Following the collapse of the Commercial Bank of Newfoundland and Union Bank of Newfoundland on December 10, 1894, the Bank of Nova Scotia established on December 15, 1894, in Newfoundland.

The bank opened a branch in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1889 to facilitate the trading of sugar, rum, and fish. This was Scotiabank&#x27;s first move into the Caribbean and historically the first branch of a Canadian bank to open outside of the United States or the United Kingdom. In 1899, Scotiabank opened a branch in Boston, Massachusetts. By the end of the 19th century, the bank was represented in all of the Maritimes, Quebec, Ontario, and Manitoba. In 1900, the bank moved its headquarters to Toronto, Ontario.

===20th century===
The bank continued to grow with the opening of new branches in the early 20th century. In 1906, the Bank of Nova Scotia opened a branch in Havana, Cuba, followed by a branch in New York City in the following year. In 1910, the bank opened a branch in San Juan, Puerto Rico. The bank also grew with the merger and acquisition of other banks, including the Bank of New Brunswick in 1913, and the Toronto-based Metropolitan Bank in 1914. The acquisition of Metropolitan Bank made the Bank of Nova Scotia the fourth largest financial institution in Canada at that time. In 1919, the bank amalgamated with the Bank of Ottawa.

In 1919, the bank opened a branch in Fajardo, Puerto Rico. In the following year, the bank opened a branch in London, and another in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. The bank also saw growth in Cuba, with five branches in Havana, and one branch each in Camagüey, Cienfuegos, Manzanillo, and Santiago de Cuba by 1931.

During the mid-20th century, the bank grew not only in size but also in breadth of products and services. Progress was conditioned by changing consumer needs, legal changes, or acquisitions of external service providers. Major changes include: Following the passage of the &quot;National Housing Act&quot;, the Bank of Nova Scotia created a mortgage department in 1954. Further changes to the &quot;Bank Act of 1954&quot; in 1958 led to the bank introducing its consumer credit program.

The bank&#x27;s branches in Cuba continued to operate until 1960, when the Government of Cuba nationalized all banks in Cuba, and the Bank of Nova Scotia withdrew its services from all eight branches. During the 1960s, the Bank of Nova Scotia became the first Canadian bank to appoint women as bank managers, with the first appointed on September 11, 1961. In the next year, the bank expanded into Asia with the opening of a Representative Office in Japan.

In 1975, the Bank of Nova Scotia adopted &quot;Scotiabank&quot; as its worldwide brand name. On September 28, 1978, Scotiabank and Canadian Union of Public Employees signed a collective agreement in Toronto, making Scotiabank the first Canadian bank to sign a collective agreement with a union.

In 1986, Scotiabank created Scotia Securities to provide discount brokerage and security underwriting services. The late 1980s and 1990s saw the bank acquire several firms, including McLeod Young Weir brokerage firm (co-founded by Donald Ivan McLeod, William Ewart Young, James Gordon Weir and John Henry (Harry) Ratcliffe in 1921) in 1988, and Montreal Trustco Inc. in 1994. In 1997, the bank acquired National Trust Company for Can$1.25 billion. In the same year, Scotiabank acquired Banco Quilmes in Argentina.

===21st century===
In 2000, Scotiabank increased its stake in Mexican bank Grupo Financiero Inverlat to 55 percent. The Mexican bank was subsequently renamed to Grupo Financiero Scotiabank Inverlat. Scotiabank later acquired Inverlat banking house in 2003, taking over all of its branches and establishing a strong presence in the country.

In 2002, Scotiabank shut its branches (formerly Banco Quilmes) in Argentina during the currency crisis and massive sovereign default. In the following year, Scotiabank&#x27;s Guangzhou branch was awarded the first licence to a Canadian bank by the Chinese government to deal in Chinese currency. In 2007, Scotiabank acquired a 24.98 per cent stake in Thanachart Bank, with that share later increasing to 48.99 per cent by December 2014. With the acquisition of Siam City Bank, Thanachart Bank is now the 6th largest bank (by assets) in Thailand with over 16,000 staff serving more than four million customers through 680 branches and 2,100 ATMs across the country.

In 2010, the bank opened its first offices in Bogotá, Colombia. On October 20, 2011, Scotiabank acquired a 51 per cent stake in , Colombia&#x27;s fifth largest bank and second largest issuer of credit cards, for $1 billion Canadian in cash and stock (10 million shares). It is the second largest foreign transaction ever by a Canadian financial company overseas, behind Royal Bank of Canada&#x27;s purchase in Royal Bank of Trinidad and Tobago.

In 2012, Scotiabank entered into an agreement to acquire ING Direct Bank of Canada from ING Groep N.V. Two years later, Scotiabank would acquire ING Direct Bank of Canada for Can$3.13 billion. The sale completed on November 15, 2012, and ING Bank of Canada was later renamed Tangerine in April 2014.

As a result of the FATCA agreement between Canada and the United States, signed between the two countries in 2014, Scotiabank has also spent almost $100 million implementing a controversial system to report to the United States the account holdings of close to one million Canadians of American origin and their Canadian-born spouses. Scotiabank has been forced to implement this system in order to comply with FATCA. According to Financial Post, FATCA requires Canadian banks to provide information to the United States including total assets, account balances, account numbers, transactions, account numbers, and other personal identifying information, as well as assets held jointly with Canadian-born spouses and other family members.

On July 14, 2015, Scotiabank announced that it would buy Citigroup&#x27;s retail and commercial banking operations in Panama and Costa Rica. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. The purchase would increase Scotiabank&#x27;s client base in both countries from 137,000 to 387,000, and would add 27 branches to the existing 51 branches in both Central American nations.

Scotiabank&#x27;s former president, CEO and Chairman Cedric Ritchie died on March 20, 2016. He was a President of Scotiabank from 1972, and CEO and chairman from 1974 to 1995. Under his leadership, Scotiabank expanded into more than 40 countries and grew to 33,000 employees.

In 2017, Scotiabank join Enterprise Ethereum Alliance.

In 2018, Scotiabank acquired Montreal investment firm Jarislowsky Fraser, also in 2018 Scotiabank completed the acquisition of a 68.19 per cent stake in BBVA Chile for Can$2.9 billion, as a result BBVA Chile was merged into Scotiabank Chile. On February 21, 2019, the Prosecutor in the Central American country of Costa Rica raided Scotiabank&#x27;s offices in San José, Costa Rica, claiming that the bank had failed to provide the government with information on accounts and deposits that could allegedly implicate Alejandro Toledo, the former president of Peru, in money laundering. Later that year, in June 2019 it was announced that OFG Bancorp would acquire all branches of Scotiabank within Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands territories as part of a $550 million cash deal.

In 2019, Scotiabank underwent a rebranding, modifying its wordmark logo and introducing a new corporate font based on its design, downplaying the company&#x27;s S and globe monogram, and increasing use of the abbreviated name &quot;Scotia&quot;.

In 2022, the management tried to reduce the rate of remote work.

On February 14, 2024, Chief Executive Officer and Group Head, Global Banking and Markets Jake Lawrence left the bank after 22 years and joined the Power Corporation of Canada. His responsibilities are shared between Paul Scurfield to Global Head, Capital Markets, Global Banking and Markets, and Michael Kruse, acting as Interim Global Head, Corporate and Investment Banking, Global Banking and Markets.

In February 2024, Bank of Nova Scotia announced the creation of first indigenous-owned investment dealer in Canada. Cedar Leaf Capital is a partnership between two indigenous development corporations and one indigenous peoples corporation. Each side owns 23.3% of the shares and Scotiabank controls the rest. At the same time, the bank will reduce its share once Cedar Leaf Capital has established its production. This initiative will facilitate access by aboriginal people (5% of Canada&#x27;s 40 million people) to investment and infrastructure development.

In August 2024, Scotiabank and KeyCorp (a U.S. regional bank) announced that Scotiabank was purchasing 14.9% of KeyCorp for approximately $2.8 billion. The parties expect to complete the purchase upon the satisfaction of customary closing conditions and the receipt of Federal Reserve approval, which is expected to occur in the first quarter of 2025. As part of the transaction, KeyCorp and Scotiabank plan to explore commercial opportunities to partner together in the future to best serve their respective client bases.

In November 2024, some customers were unable to access their accounts for days.

In January 2025, the signing of an agreement to purchase the remaining stake (43.9%) in Scotiabank Colpatria (Colombia) is announced, in turn announcing a merger agreement in some Latin American countries through which Scotiabank will hold 20% of Davivienda, and the latter will absorb Scotiabank Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica, operations that in any case will be subject to regulatory approvals throughout 2025.

===Acquisitions and mergers===
The bank has amalgamated with several other Canadian financial institutions through the years and purchased several other banks overseas. Most have been rebranded since their acquisition, although a few continue to utilize their former names. Several branches of the former Montreal Trust and National Trust were rebranded Scotiabank &amp; Trust, and continue to operate as such.

==Controversies==
=== Major investor in UN-blacklisted Israeli bank and arms manufacturer ===
One of Scotiabank mutual funds is the largest foreign investor of the UNHRC-blacklisted Israeli bank Mizrahi Tefahot Bank, which invests in illegal settlements in Palestinian Territories. The same mutual fund is also heavily invested in the Israeli weapon manufacturer Elbit;. Elbit also provides surveillance system in the West Bank, and has a spying-tool division that has been involved in spying on journalists.

1832 Asset Management, a division of Scotiabank&#x27;s Dynamic Fund held 5 per cent of Elbit, valued at about US$440 million, until May 14, 2024, when it disclosed in a regulatory filing that the halved their investments to 2.5 per cent, valued at about US$237.6 million. These investments raises major concerns, for the following reasons:

* The investments in UN blacklisted bank and arms manufacturer go against Scotiabank&#x27;s own ESG rules
* The Dynamic Global Discovery Fund is investing about 12% in just two companies (one UN-blacklisted): excessive and speculative for two smallcap companies 
* The fund does not mention in its filings that it is highly speculative, due to fact that its 12% stake are a UN-blacklisted company and a controversial arm manufacturer

===Fraud in Mexico===
A 2001 investigation into the murder of Maru Oropesa, a Scotiabank branch manager in Mexico City, revealed US$14 million missing from the branch. Initially, investigators found that Oropesa and Jaime Ross, her former boss, had illegally transferred US$5 million from client investment accounts. The money was eventually transferred to the United States where it was used to purchase three aircraft. As the investigation continued, officials found an additional $9 million missing and involvement of 16 other bank employees in the fraud. Ross was convicted of fraud and money laundering for his role and sentenced to 15 years. Scotiabank terminated the other 16 employees, but did not prosecute them.

===Unpaid overtime lawsuit===
In 2014, the bank reached a settlement in a class-action lawsuit that covered thousands of workers owed more than a decade of unpaid overtime. The lawsuit included 16,000 Scotiabank employees across Canada who worked as personal banking officers, senior personal banking officers, financial advisors, and small business account managers from January 1, 2000, to December 1, 2013. The 2007 lawsuit was similar to a class-action filed by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) bank teller Dara Fresco of Toronto.

Under terms of the settlement, employees received 1.5 times their standard wage at the time, but no interest. Scotiabank also paid legal fees of $10.45 million.

===Wrongful dismissal lawsuit===
In June 2005, David Berry, a very successful Canadian Scotiabank trader who had built a $75 million/year business in trading preferred shares, was fired on the grounds that he had committed securities regulatory violations. At the time, as part of a 20 per cent direct drive deal, he was making more than double the CEO&#x27;s salary and Scotiabank management had already taken steps to limit his compensation. The regulatory violation allegations from his former employer, left him unemployable to Scotiabank&#x27;s competitors despite the appeal of potentially adding more than $75 million/year to their equity trading profits.

Documents delivered to the media showing that Scotiabank management had sought advice on terminating Berry prior to the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC) violation accusation, and the results of questioning during the IIROC inquiries strongly suggest that the securities charges were part of a plan by Scotiabank senior management to remove Berry from his position and simultaneously prevent him from becoming their competitor.

In a ruling on January 15, 2013, more than seven years after the initial accusation, a hearing panel of the IIROC dismissed all charges against Berry.

David Berry filed a $100 million wrongful dismissal lawsuit against Scotiabank. As of January 2015, and nine years after Berry was terminated, Scotiabank settled with Berry for an undisclosed amount. Barry Critchley, who followed the story since its beginning, wrote an article on November 6, 2014, in which he believes Scotiabank&#x27;s $55 million reported legal charges would likely be connected to the $100 million lawsuit; but it is unlikely to ever be known.

==Sponsorship==
===Sports===

Scotiabank is the title sponsor for a number of sports events including the Calgary Marathon, the CONCACAF Champions League tournament (since 2015), and the Jewish National Fund&#x27;s &quot;Pitch for Israel&quot; event. Scotiabank is also the title sponsor for running events that form a part of the Canada Running Series. They include Banque Scotia 21k de Montreal + 10k &amp; 5k in April; Scotiabank Vancouver Half-Marathon &amp; 5k Run/Walk in June; Scotiabank Toronto Waterfront Marathon, Half-Marathon &amp; 5k in October; and the Scotiabank Bluenose Marathon.

This is in addition to being the official financial services provider to the Canadian Football League. Scotiabank was also a primary sponsor for Champion Boxer Miguel Cotto during his 2009 bout with Manny Pacquiao.

Scotiabank also sponsors sports leagues and teams, becoming a sponsor for Club Deportivo Guadalajara in 2013, and becoming the official sponsor for the Chilean Primera División after signing a five-year period contract in 2014. Scotiabank is also the official bank of the National Hockey League and National Hockey League Players&#x27; Association. It was named official bank of the 2007 Cricket World Cup.

They include the Scotiabank Aquatics Center in Guadalajara; Scotiabank Saddledome in Calgary (since October 8, 2010); and the Scotiabank Centre in Halifax (since June 25, 2014). The naming rights for the Scotiabank Centre was signed for ten years, with annual fees of $650,000 for said rights. The facility officially opened its doors as the rebranded Scotiabank Centre on September 19, 2014. On August 29, 2017, Scotiabank and Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment, announced that Scotiabank purchased the naming rights to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto for $800 million, a record-setting deal described as &quot;one of the biggest investments in naming rights in North America&quot;. The multi-sport complex was renamed July 1, 2018, as Scotiabank Arena. From 2006 through 2013, Scotiabank held the naming rights to the arena of the Ottawa Senators, branding it Scotiabank Place. Canadian Tire took over the naming rights for the Senators&#x27; arena in June 2013. In 2022, Scotiabank acquired the naming rights to the Bell MTS Iceplex near Winnipeg; rather than use the Scotiabank name, the facility is instead branded as Hockey for All Centre, as an extension of a diversity and inclusion campaign of the same name.

===Culture===
Scotiabank has been a title sponsor for a number of cultural events and institutions in Canada. In 2005, Scotiabank became title sponsor of the Giller Prize. From 2006 to 2015, Scotiabank was the title sponsor for the Nuit Blanche event in Toronto. In 2008, Scotiabank announced a two-year sponsorship of Toronto&#x27;s Caribana which would be rebranded as Scotiabank Caribbean Carnival Toronto. The sponsorship of the Caribbean festival was extended until 2015, when the partnership with the festival ended. In 2016 Scotiabank held its first hackathon with the goal of solving Canadian debt.
Scotiabank and Canadian theatre operator Cineplex Entertainment partnered in 2007 to create a loyalty rewards program called Scene+. The program allows patrons to sign up for a special card that grants them points which can be redeemed for free movies or concession discounts. Scotiabank customers can also request a debit card which gives them points when used, and a Visa credit card was launched in early May. Five Cineplex Entertainment locations were also rebranded as &quot;Scotiabank Theatres.&quot; In 2015, the two companies announced they extended the partnership through October 31, 2025, and would expand naming rebrand another five theatres as Scotiabank Theatres. On December 14, 2021, the new Scene+ program was launched. It merged Scene and Scotia Rewards points.

Scotiabank is also the title sponsor for two post-secondary facilities in Canada, including Scotiabank Hall at Brock University in St. Catharines; and Scotiabank Hall in the Marion McCain Arts and Social Sciences Building at Dalhousie University in Halifax. Scotiabank has also established an industry partnership with the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus.

<doc id="354999" wikidata="Q755233" url="?curid=354999" title="My Hero (British TV series)">
<text>My Hero is a British television sitcom, created by Paul Mendelson, and produced for the BBC between 2000 and 2006. The series follows the exploits of an alien superhero known as &quot;Thermoman&quot; - a multi-powered superhero who originates from the planet Ultron - during his time between missions after falling in love with a British nurse he rescued. Although incredibly intelligent amongst his kind, Thermoman is unfamiliar with human life, which not only leads others to consider him dim-witted and idiotic, but also causes problems due to his many misunderstandings.

The main role of Thermoman was portrayed by Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon up until 2005, before he was replaced by James Dreyfus for the final series. The cast itself remained largely unchanged throughout its broadcast history, and included Emily Joyce, Lill Roughley, Tim Wylton, Lou Hirsch, Hugh Dennis, Geraldine McNulty, and Philip Whitchurch. Unlike most British sitcoms, Mendelson co-wrote episode scripts with a large team of writers. Each series also featured a varying number of episodes, with the first and second series containing six episodes, series three through five containing 10 episodes each and series six containing 8 episodes, with a Christmas Special for 2000.

Despite its viewing figures going into decline by the time of Dreyfus&#x27; appearance, the show remained a regular feature on British television, being regularly repeated on Gold in the United Kingdom. In the United States, the series was shown on PBS and, briefly, BBC America. In Australia, UKTV offered reruns of the first three series, while BBC Entertainment provided repeats for Scandinavia. Three of the six series have been released on DVD; two on Region 1 DVD and one on Region 2. Fans have since petitioned the BBC to release the complete series on DVD.

==Premise==
The series focuses on the life of George Sunday, a man who comes off as idiotic, but who in reality is a superhero from the planet Ultron known as &quot;Thermoman&quot;, who serves to safeguard humanity and the Earth, and Janet Dawkins, a British nurse who works at a local surgery in the London town of Northolt, whom George falls in love with after saving her life. The series focuses on the couple&#x27;s efforts to cope with numerous problems that occur to them during their relationship, including dealing with Janet&#x27;s obnoxius parents and the self-centered doctor whom she works for, and George&#x27;s many misunderstandings of human culture, societial values and traits.

After the second series, the writers added in additional elements surrounding the couple being married and having children of Ultronian origin - capable of speech, intelligence and super powers for their infant age - and coping with issues surrounding their family lives. In the sixth series, George loses his old body, and replaces it with a new one that he gives the alias of George Monday, taking up work as a doctor alongside Piers at his surgery.

==Cast==

* Ardal O&#x27;Hanlon as George Sunday AKA &quot;Thermoman&quot; (Series 1–5) - A dim-witted superhero, intelligent on alien matters, but completely unable to understand human society and values.
* James Dreyfus as George Monday AKA &quot;Thermoman&quot; (Series 6) - George&#x27;s new alias after losing his old one due to financial troubles, who shows some intelligence but is still misunderstanding human culture.
* Emily Joyce as Janet Dawkins - A British nurse and George&#x27;s lover, who often struggles with the alien aspects of his life and people.
* Lill Roughley as Ella Dawkins - Janet&#x27;s obnoxious mother.
* Tim Wylton as Stanley Dawkins - Janet&#x27;s mildly obnoxious father.
* Lou Hirsch as Arnie Kowalski - George&#x27;s cousin, and a former superhero who was stripped of his powers for abusing them. Initially written to living in the US, the third series saw writers relocate him to Northolt and develop a relationship with Mrs. Raven.
* Hugh Dennis as Dr. Piers Crispin - A self-centred, pompous TV doctor who runs his own surgery in Northolt and regularly looks for ways to increase his fame and popularity.
* Geraldine McNulty as Mrs. Raven - Piers&#x27; surgery receptionist, a vindictive, sadistic woman with a cruel liking for basking in other people&#x27;s misery.
* Philip Whitchurch as Tyler - George and Janet&#x27;s next-door neighbour, who suffers delusions and hallucinations that cause him to mix up fictional elements, most from science-fiction, fantasy and conspiracy theories, with real-life. He is the only one to know of George&#x27;s real identity. After the first series, the writers gave him more prominence, including being George&#x27;s assistant at his shop.
* Moya Brady as Avril (Series 1) - George&#x27;s assistant in his shop. The character was written out after the first series.
* Pat Kelman as the Ultron Postie (Series 3–6) - Ultronian postman who delivers correspondence to George on Earth
* Finlay Stroud as Apollo &quot;Ollie&quot; Sunday (Series 2–6) - George and Janet&#x27;s son. He is highly intelligent in human life, compared to his father, with his superpowers. 
* Madeline Mortimer as Cassandra &quot;Cassie&quot; Sunday (series 5–6) - George and Janet&#x27;s daughter, highly intelligent, possessing the power of premonition and foresight.

<text>James Bryant Conant (March 26, 1893 – February 11, 1978) was an American chemist, a transformative President of Harvard University, and the first U.S. Ambassador to West Germany. Conant obtained a Ph.D. in chemistry from Harvard in 1916. 

During World War I, he served in the U.S. Army, where he worked on the development of poison gases, especially Lewisite. He became an assistant professor of chemistry at Harvard University in 1919 and the Sheldon Emery Professor of Organic Chemistry in 1929. He researched the physical structures of natural products, particularly chlorophyll, and he was one of the first to explore the sometimes complex relationship between chemical equilibrium and the reaction rate of chemical processes. He studied the biochemistry of oxyhemoglobin providing insight into the disease methemoglobinemia, helped to explain the structure of chlorophyll, and contributed important insights that underlie modern theories of acid-base chemistry.

In 1933, Conant became the president of Harvard University with a reformist agenda that included dispensing with a number of customs, including class rankings and the requirement for Latin classes. He abolished athletic scholarships, and instituted an &quot;up or out&quot; policy, under which untenured faculty who were not promoted were terminated. His egalitarian vision of education required a diversified student body, and he promoted the adoption of the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) and co-educational classes. During his presidency, women were admitted to Harvard Medical School and Harvard Law School for the first time.

Conant was appointed to the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) in 1940, becoming its chairman in 1941. In this capacity, he oversaw vital wartime research projects, including the development of synthetic rubber and the Manhattan Project, which developed the first atomic bombs. On July 16, 1945, he was among the dignitaries present at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range for the Trinity nuclear test, the first detonation of an atomic bomb, and was part of the Interim Committee that advised President Harry S. Truman to use atomic bombs on Japan. After the war, he served on the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDC) that was established to coordinate burgeoning defense research, and on the influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC); in the latter capacity he advised the president against starting a development program for the hydrogen bomb.

In his later years at Harvard, Conant taught undergraduate courses on the history and philosophy of science, and wrote books explaining the scientific method to laymen. In 1953, he retired as president of Harvard University and became the United States High Commissioner for Germany, overseeing the restoration of German sovereignty after World War II, and then was Ambassador to West Germany until 1957. 

On returning to the United States, Conant criticized the education system in &quot;The American High School Today&quot; (1959), &quot;Slums and Suburbs&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Education of American Teachers&quot; (1963). Between 1965 and 1969, Conant authored his autobiography, &quot;My Several Lives&quot; (1970). He became increasingly infirm, had a series of strokes in 1977, and died in a nursing home in Hanover, New Hampshire, the following year.

==Early life and education==
Conant was born in Dorchester, Massachusetts, on March 26, 1893, the third child and only son of James Scott Conant, a photoengraver, and his wife Jennett Orr (née Bryant). In 1904, Conant was one of 35 boys who passed the competitive admission exam for the Roxbury Latin School in West Roxbury, Massachusetts, and he graduated near the top of his class from the school in 1910. 

Encouraged by his science teacher, Newton H. Black, in September of that year he entered Harvard College, where he studied physical chemistry under Theodore W. Richards and organic chemistry under Elmer P. Kohler. He was also an editor of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. He joined the Signet Society and Delta Upsilon, and was initiated as a brother of the Omicron chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma in 1912. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa with his Bachelor of Arts in June 1913. He then went to work on his doctorate, which was an unusual double dissertation. The first part, supervised by Richards, concerned &quot;The Electrochemical Behavior of Liquid Sodium Amalgams&quot;; the second, supervised by Kohler, was &quot;A Study of Certain Cyclopropane Derivatives&quot;. Harvard awarded Conant his Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1916.

==Career==
In 1915, Conant entered into a business partnership with two other Harvard chemistry graduates, Stanley Pennock and Chauncey Loomis, to form the LPC Laboratories. They opened a plant in a one-story building in Queens, New York City, where they manufactured chemicals used by the pharmaceutical industry like benzoic acid that were selling at high prices on account of the interruption of imports from Germany due to World War I. In 1916, the departure of organic chemist Roger Adams created a vacancy at Harvard that was offered to Conant. Since he aspired to an academic career, Conant accepted the offer and returned to Harvard. On November 27, 1916, an explosion killed Pennock and two others and completely destroyed a subsequent and newly opened plant in Newark, New Jersey. A contributing cause was Conant&#x27;s faulty test procedures.

===U.S. Army===
Following the United States declaration of war on Germany that launched U.S. involvement in World War I, Conant was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army Sanitary Corps on September 22, 1917. He went to the Camp American University, where he worked on the development of poison gases. Initially, his work concentrated on mustard gas, but in May 1918, Conant took charge of a unit concerned with the development of lewisite. He was promoted to major on July 20, 1918. A pilot plant was built, and then a full-scale production plant in Cleveland, but the war ended before lewisite could be used in battle.

===Harvard University professor===
Conant was appointed an assistant professor of chemistry at Harvard in 1919. The following year he became engaged to Richards&#x27;s daughter, Grace (Patty) Thayer Richards. They were married in the Appleton Chapel at Harvard on April 17, 1920, and had two sons, James Richards Conant, born in May 1923, and Theodore Richards Conant, born in July 1928.

Conant became an associate professor in 1924. In 1925, he visited Germany, then the heart of chemical research, for eight months. He toured the major universities and laboratories there and met many of the leading chemists, including Theodor Curtius, Kazimierz Fajans, Hans Fischer, Arthur Hantzsch, Hans Meerwein, Jakob Meisenheimer, Hermann Staudinger, Adolf Windaus and Karl Ziegler. After Conant returned to the United States, Arthur Amos Noyes made him an attractive offer to move to Caltech. The president of Harvard, Abbott Lawrence Lowell, made a counter offer: immediate promotion to professor, effective September 1, 1927, with a salary of $7,000 (roughly equivalent to as of 2025) and a grant of $9,000 per annum for research. Conant accepted and stayed at Harvard. In 1929, he became the Sheldon Emery Professor of Organic Chemistry, and then, in 1931, the chairman of the chemistry department.

Between 1928 and 1933, Conant published 55 papers. Much of his research, like his double thesis, combined natural product chemistry with physical organic chemistry. Based on his exploration of reaction rates in chemical equilibria, Conant was one of the first to recognise that the kinetics of these systems is sometimes straightforward and simple, yet quite complex in other cases. Conant studied the effect of haloalkane structure on the rate of substitution with inorganic iodide salts which, together with earlier work, led to what is now known as either the Conant-Finkelstein reaction or more commonly simply the Finkelstein reaction. A recent application of this reaction involved the preparation of an iodinated polyvinyl chloride from regular PVC. A combination of Conant&#x27;s work on the kinetics of hydrogenation and George Kistiakowsky&#x27;s work on the enthalpy changes of these reactions supported the later development of the theory of hyperconjugation.

Conant&#x27;s investigations helped in the development of a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of acids and bases. He investigated the properties of certain acids which were many times stronger than mineral acid solutions in water. Conant christened them &quot;superacids&quot; and laid the foundation for the development of the Hammett acidity function. These investigations used acetic acid as the solvent and demonstrated that sodium acetate behaves as a base under these conditions. This observation is consistent with Brønsted–Lowry acid–base theory published in 1923, but cannot be explained under older Arrhenius theory approaches. Later work with George Wheland and extended by William Kirk McEwen looked at the properties of hydrocarbons as very weak acids, including acetophenone, phenylacetylene, fluorene and diphenylmethane. Conant can be considered alongside Brønsted, Lowry, Lewis, and Hammett as a developer of modern understanding of acids and bases.

Between 1929 and his retirement from chemical research in 1933, Conant published papers in &quot;Science&quot;, &quot;Nature&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of the American Chemical Society&quot; about chlorophyll and its structure. Though the complete structure eluded him, his work did support and contribute to Nobel laureate Hans Fischer&#x27;s ultimate determination of the structure in 1939. Conant&#x27;s work on chlorophyll was recognised when he was inducted as a foreign Fellow of the Royal Society on May 2, 1941. He also published three papers describing the polymerisation of isoprene to prepare synthetic rubber.

Another line of research involved the biochemistry of the hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin system. Conant ran a series of experiments with electrochemical oxidation and reduction, following in the footsteps of the famous German chemist and Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. He determined that the iron centre in methemoglobin is a ferric (FeIII) centre, unlike the ferrous (FeII) centre found in normal hemoglobin, and this difference in oxidation state is the cause of methemoglobinemia, a medical condition which causes tissue hypoxia.

Conant wrote a chemistry textbook with his former science teacher Black, entitled &quot;Practical Chemistry&quot;, which was published in 1920, with a revised edition in 1929. This was superseded in 1937 by their &quot;New Practical Chemistry&quot;, which in turn had a revised edition in 1946. The text proved a popular one; it was adopted by 75 universities, and Conant received thousands of dollars in royalties. For his accomplishments in chemistry, he was awarded the American Chemical Society&#x27;s Nichols Medal in 1932, Columbia University&#x27;s Chandler Medal in 1932, and the American Chemical Society&#x27;s highest honor, the Priestley Medal, in 1944. He also received the society&#x27;s Charles Lathrop Parsons Award in 1955, for public service. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1924, a Member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1929, and a Member of the American Philosophical Society in 1935. Notable students of Conant&#x27;s included Paul Doughty Bartlett, George Wheland, and Frank Westheimer. In 1932 he was also honored by membership of the German Academy of Sciences Leopoldina.

===Harvard University president===

After some months of lobbying and discussion, Harvard&#x27;s ruling body, the Harvard Corporation, announced on May 8, 1933, that it had elected Conant as the next President of Harvard. Alfred North Whitehead, Harvard&#x27;s eminent professor of philosophy disagreed with the decision, declaring, &quot;The Corporation should not have elected a chemist to the Presidency.&quot; &quot;But,&quot; Corporation member Grenville Clark reminded him, &quot;Eliot was a chemist, and our best president too.&quot; &quot;I know,&quot; replied Whitehead, &quot;but Eliot was a &quot;bad&quot; chemist.&quot; Clark was very much responsible for Conant&#x27;s election.

On October 9, 1933, Conant became the President of Harvard University with a low-key installation ceremony in the Faculty Room of University Hall. This set the tone for Conant&#x27;s presidency as one of informality and reform. At his inauguration, he accepted the charter and seal presented to John Leverett the Younger in 1707, but dropped a number of other customs, including the singing of &quot;Gloria Patri&quot; and the Latin Oration. While, unlike some other universities, Harvard did not require Greek or Latin for entrance, they were worth double credits towards admission, and students like Conant who had studied Latin were awarded an A.B. degree while those who had not, received an S.B. One of his first efforts at reform was to attempt to abolish this distinction. But in 1937 he wrote:

As a first step to improving the faculty, Conant established a mandatory retirement age of sixty-six, with exceptional faculty members able to remain until age seventy-six. The latter affected two of the university&#x27;s most eminent scholars, Frank Taussig and George Kittredge, who were persuaded to retire voluntarily rather than under the new rule. His longest and most bitter battle was over tenure reform, shifting to an &quot;up or out&quot; policy, under which scholars who were not promoted were terminated. A small number of extra-departmental positions was set aside for outstanding scholars. This policy led junior faculty to revolt, and nearly resulted in Conant&#x27;s dismissal in 1938. Conant was fond of saying: &quot;Behold the turtle. It makes progress only when it sticks its neck out.&quot;
Other reforms included the abolition of class rankings and athletic scholarships. Conant added new graduate degrees in education, history of science and public policy, and he introduced the Nieman Fellowship for journalists to study at Harvard, the first of which was awarded in 1939. He supported the &quot;meatballs&quot;, as lower class students were called. He instituted the Harvard national scholarships for underprivileged students. Dudley House was opened to provide non-resident students with increased opportunities for socialization (opportunities provided to resident undergraduates by the twelve Harvard College residential houses).

Conant asked two of his assistant deans, Henry Chauncey and William Bender, to determine whether the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) was a good measure of academic potential. When they reported that it was, Conant adopted it. He waged a ten-year campaign for the consolidation of testing services, which resulted in the creation of the Educational Testing Service in 1946, with Chauncey as its director. Theodore H. White, a Boston Jewish &quot;meatball&quot; who received a personal letter of introduction from Conant so that he could report on the Chinese Civil War, noted that &quot;Conant was the first president to recognize that meatballs were Harvard men too.&quot;
Lowell, Conant&#x27;s predecessor, had imposed a 15 percent quota on Jewish students in 1922, something Conant had voted to support.

This quota was replaced with geographic distribution preferences, which had the same effect of limiting Jewish admission. Conant&#x27;s cool response to the plight of the Jewish academic refugees from Hitler suggest that he shared the anti-semitism common to his social group and time. When DuPont asked him for an appraisal of the German chemist Max Bergmann, Conant wrote back that Bergmann was &quot;definitely of the Jewish type—rather heavy&quot; with &quot;none of the earmarks of genius&quot;. Harvard awarded honorary degrees to two notable displaced scholars, Thomas Mann and Albert Einstein, in 1935, but Conant declined to participate in the Emergency Committee in Aid of Displaced German Scholars. His vision of building Harvard&#x27;s faculty involved hiring promising American scholars rather than helping refugees. The two most prominent refugee scholars at Harvard, Walter Gropius and Robert Ulich, were not Jewish. Writing in 1979, historian William M. Tuttle Jr. concluded that &quot;Conant&#x27;s position reflected not only a failure of foresight, but also a failure of compassion and political sensitivity&quot;, but added that &quot;Conant was one of the more outspoken anti-Nazis in the United States from 1933 to the outbreak of war in Europe in 1939. Stephen H. Norwood, writing in 2004, observed that &quot;This, however, was hardly the case.&quot; Norwood noted that while Conant was not an apologist for the Nazi regime, he repeatedly failed to speak out.

In 1934, Harvard-educated German businessman Ernst Hanfstaengl attended the 25th anniversary reunion of his class of 1909, and gave a number of speeches. In his inaugural commencement address in 1934, Conant spoke out against the Nazi threat to academic freedom in Germany. His speech was interrupted by two female students who had chained themselves to the stands near the speaker&#x27;s platform and chanted &quot;Down with Hitler!&quot; and &quot;Down with Hanfstaengl!&quot; Hanfstaengl wrote out a check for () to Conant for a scholarship to enable an outstanding Harvard student to study for a year in Germany. At the next meeting of the Corporation in October, Conant persuaded it to reject the offer due to Hanfstaengl&#x27;s Nazi associations. When the issue of Hanfstaengl&#x27;s scholarship came up again in 1936, Conant turned the money down a second time. Hanfstaengl&#x27;s presence on campus prompted a series of anti-Nazi demonstrations, in which a number of Harvard and MIT students were arrested. Conant made a personal plea for clemency that resulted in two women being acquitted, but six men and a woman were sentenced to six months in jail. They were later pardoned by the Governor of Massachusetts, Joseph B. Ely.

When the University of Berlin awarded an honorary degree in 1934 to American legal scholar and Dean of Harvard Law School Roscoe Pound, who had toured Germany earlier that year and made no secret of his admiration for the Nazi regime, Conant refused to order Pound not to accept it, and attended the informal award ceremony at Harvard where Pound was presented with the degree by Hans Luther, the German ambassador to the United States.

What Conant feared most was disruption to Harvard&#x27;s tercentennial celebrations in 1936, but there was no trouble despite the presence of Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and a Harvard graduate of the class of 1904, whom many fellow Harvard graduates regarded as a socialist and a class traitor. Privately, Conant approved of the New Deal and expressed admiration for Roosevelt&#x27;s goals. He invited Roosevelt to speak at the tercentennial celebrations. This did not sit well with Lowell, and it was only with difficulty that Lowell was persuaded to be presiding officer at an event at which Roosevelt spoke. The parallels between Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal and Conant&#x27;s advocacy of meritocracy and of education as a means of social mobility did not escape notice. Conant recognized that education in America contributed to social stratification rather than breaking it down, and that educational opportunity needed to be extended to areas where it was deficient, such as rural areas, small towns and inner cities. He advocated for federal interventions, since these areas were often poor and lacking in the funds needed to improve education, and that they were economically and socially stratified with political and taxation structures that reinforced social stratification.

Conant sought to enhance the liberal education of Harvard students. He toyed with the notion of requiring PhD candidates to study an area outside their speciality. One obstacle was the organization of faculty into specialized departments that had little contact with each other. In 1935, he attempted to break down the specialization of academic by creating non-departmental university professorships for scholars whose research crossed the boundaries of multiple disciplines. Undergraduates were required to take general education courses, of which a proportion had to be outside their area of concentration. He took a particular interest in establishing a history of science graduate program and a history of science course for nonscientists.

Although he had no daughters and little interest in the education of women, the exigencies of World War II meant reduced numbers of male students, and this propelled Conant in that direction. In June 1943, he concluded an agreement with Radcliffe College, the women&#x27;s college associated with Harvard, for Harvard&#x27;s Faculty of Arts and Sciences to assume responsibility for the instruction of Radcliffe students. Initially there were separate but identical undergraduate courses for Harvard and Radcliffe students, but this gave way to coeducational classes. It was during his presidency that the first class of women were admitted to Harvard Medical School in 1945, and Harvard Law School in 1950.

===National Defense Research Committee===
In June 1940, with World War II already raging in Europe, Vannevar Bush, the director of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, recruited Conant to the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), although he remained president of Harvard. Bush envisaged the NDRC as bringing scientists together to &quot;conduct research for the creation and improvement of instrumentalities, methods and materials of warfare.&quot; Although the United States had not yet entered the war, Conant was not alone in his conviction that Nazi Germany had to be stopped, and that the United States would inevitably become embroiled in the conflict. The immediate task, as Conant saw it, was therefore to organize American science for war. He became head of the NDRC&#x27;s Division B, the division responsible for bombs, fuels, gases and chemicals. On June 28, 1941, Roosevelt signed Executive Order 8807, which created the Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), with Bush as its director. Conant succeeded Bush as chairman of the NDRC, which was subsumed into the OSRD. Roger Adams, a contemporary of Conant&#x27;s at Harvard in the 1910s, succeeded him as head of Division B. Conant became the driving force of the NDRC on personnel and policy matters. The NDRC would work hand in hand with the Army and Navy&#x27;s research efforts, supplementing rather than supplanting them. It was specifically charged with investigating nuclear fission.

In February 1941, Roosevelt sent Conant to Britain as head of a mission that also included Frederick L. Hovde from Purdue University and Carroll L. Wilson from MIT, to evaluate the research being carried out there and the prospects for cooperation. The 1940 Tizard Mission had revealed that American technology was some years behind that of Britain in many fields, most notably radar, and cooperation was eagerly sought. Conant had lunch with Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Frederick Lindemann, his leading scientific adviser, and an audience with King George VI at Buckingham Palace. At a subsequent meeting, Lindemann told Conant about British progress towards developing an atomic bomb. What most impressed Conant was the British conviction that it was feasible. That the British program was ahead of the American one raised the possibility in Conant&#x27;s mind that the German nuclear energy project might be even further ahead, as Germany was generally acknowledged to be a world leader in nuclear physics. Later that year, Churchill, as Chancellor of the University of Bristol, conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Conant &quot;in absentia&quot;.

Conant subsequently moved to restrict cooperation with Britain on nuclear energy, particularly its post-war aspects, and became involved in heated negotiations with Wallace Akers, the representative of Tube Alloys, the British atomic project. Conant&#x27;s tough stance, under which the British were excluded except where their assistance was vital, resulted in British retaliation, and a complete breakdown of cooperation. His objections were swept aside by Roosevelt, who brokered the 1943 Quebec Agreement with Churchill, that restored full cooperation. After the Quebec Conference, Churchill visited Conant at Harvard, where Conant returned the 1941 gesture and presented Churchill with an honorary Doctor of Laws degree. After the United States entered the war in December 1941, the OSRD handed the atomic bomb project, better known as the Manhattan Project, over to the Army, with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves as project director. A meeting that included Conant decided Groves should be answerable to a small committee called the Military Policy Committee, chaired by Bush, with Conant as his alternate. Thus, Conant remained involved in the administration of the Manhattan Project at its highest levels.
In August 1942, Roosevelt appointed Conant to the Rubber Survey Committee. Chaired by Bernard M. Baruch, a trusted adviser and confidant of Roosevelt, the committee was tasked with reviewing the synthetic rubber program. Corporations used patent laws to restrict competition and stifle innovation. When the Japanese occupation of Malaya, North Borneo and Sarawak, followed by the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, cut off 90 percent of the supply of natural rubber, the rubber shortage became a national scandal, and the development of synthetic substitutes, an urgent priority. Baruch dealt with the difficult political issues; Conant concerned himself with the technical ones. There were a number of different synthetic rubber products to choose from. In addition to DuPont&#x27;s neoprene, Standard Oil had licensed German patents for a copolymer called Buna-N and a related product, Buna-S. None had been manufactured on the scale now required, and there was pressure from agricultural interests to choose a process which involved making raw materials from farm products. The Rubber Survey Committee made a series of recommendations, including the appointment of a rubber director, and the construction and operation of 51 factories to supply the materials needed for synthetic rubber production. Technical problems dogged the program through 1943, but by late 1944 plants were in operation with an annual capacity of over a million tons, most of which was Buna-S.

In May 1945, Conant became part of the Interim Committee that was formed to advise the new president, Harry S. Truman on nuclear weapons. The Interim Committee decided that the atomic bomb should be used against an industrial target in Japan as soon as possible and without warning. On July 16, 1945, Conant was among the dignitaries present at the Alamogordo Bombing and Gunnery Range for the Trinity nuclear test, the first detonation of an atomic bomb. After the war, Conant became concerned about growing criticism in the United States of the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by figures like Norman Cousins and Reinhold Niebuhr. He played an important behind-the-scenes role in shaping public opinion by instigating and then editing an influential February 1947 &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; article entitled &quot;The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb&quot;. Written by former Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson with the help of McGeorge Bundy, the article stressed that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were used to avoid the possibility of &quot;over a million casualties&quot;, from a figure found in the estimates given to the Joint Chiefs of Staff by its Joint Planning Staff in 1945.

===Cold War===

The Atomic Energy Act of 1946 replaced the wartime Manhattan Project with the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) on January 1, 1947. The Act also established the General Advisory Committee (GAC) within the AEC to provide it with scientific and technical advice. It was widely expected that Conant would chair the GAC, but the position went to Robert Oppenheimer, the wartime director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory that had designed and developed the first atomic bombs. At the same time, the Joint Research and Development Board (JRDC) was established to coordinate defense research, and Bush asked Conant to head its atomic energy subcommittee, on which Oppenheimer also served. When the new AEC chairman David E. Lilienthal raised security concerns about Oppenheimer&#x27;s relationships with communists, including Oppenheimer&#x27;s brother Frank Oppenheimer, his wife Kitty and his former girlfriend Jean Tatlock, Bush and Conant reassured Lilienthal that they had known about it when they had placed Oppenheimer in charge at Los Alamos in 1942. With such expressions of support, AEC issued Oppenheimer a Q clearance, granting him access to atomic secrets.

By September 1948, the Red Scare began to take hold, and Conant called for a ban on hiring teachers who were communists, although not for the dismissal of those who had already been hired. A debate ensued over whether communist educators could teach apolitical subjects. Conant was a member of the Educational Policies Commission (EPC), a body to which he had been appointed in 1941. When it next met in March 1949, Conant&#x27;s push for a ban was supported by the president of Columbia University, General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower. The two found common ground in their belief in ideology-based education, which Conant called &quot;democratic education&quot;. He did not see public education as a side effect of American democracy, but as one of its principal driving forces, and he disapproved of the public funding of denominational schools that he observed in Australia during his visit there in 1951. He called for increased federal spending on education, and higher taxes to redistribute wealth. His thinking was outlined in his books &quot;Education in a Divided World&quot; in 1948, and &quot;Education and Liberty&quot; in 1951. In 1952, he went further and endorsed the dismissal of academics who invoked the Fifth under questioning by the House Un-American Activities Committee.
A sign of Conant&#x27;s declining influence occurred in 1950, when he was passed over for the post of President of the National Academy of Sciences in favor of Detlev Bronk, the president of Johns Hopkins University, after a &quot;revolt&quot; by scientists unhappy with Conant. The GAC was enormously influential throughout the late 1940s, but the opposition of Oppenheimer and Conant to the development of the hydrogen bomb, only to be overridden by Truman in 1950, diminished its stature. It was reduced further when Oppenheimer and Conant were not reappointed when their terms expired in 1952, depriving the GAC of its two best-known members. Conant was appointed to the National Science Board, which administered the new National Science Foundation, and was elected its chairman, but this body had little financial or political clout. In April 1951, Truman appointed Conant to the Science Advisory Committee, but it would not develop into an influential body until the Eisenhower administration.

Conant&#x27;s experience with the Manhattan Project convinced him that the public needed a better understanding of science, and he moved to expand the nascent history and philosophy of science program at Harvard. He took the lead personally by teaching a new undergraduate course, Natural Science 4, &quot;On Understanding Science&quot;. His course notes became the basis for a book of the same name, published in 1948. In 1952, he began teaching another undergraduate course, Philosophy 150, &quot;A Philosophy of Science&quot;. In his teachings and writing on the philosophy of science, he drew heavily on those of his Harvard colleague Willard Van Orman Quine. Conant contributed four chapters to the 1957 &quot;Harvard Case Histories in Experimental Science&quot;, including an account of the overthrow of the phlogiston theory. In 1951, he published &quot;Science and Common Sense&quot;, in which he attempted to explain the ways of scientists to laymen. Conant&#x27;s ideas about scientific progress would come under attack by his own protégés, notably Thomas Kuhn in &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;. Conant commented on Kuhn&#x27;s manuscript in draft form.

===Allied High Commissioner===
In April 1951, Conant was approached by U.S. Secretary of State Dean Acheson about replacing John J. McCloy as United States High Commissioner for Germany, but he declined. However, after Dwight Eisenhower was elected president in 1952, Conant was again offered the job by the new Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, and this time he accepted. At the Harvard Board of Overseers meeting on January 12, 1952, Conant announced that he would retire in September 1953 after twenty years at Harvard, having reached the pension age of sixty.

In Germany, there were major issues to be decided. Germany was still occupied by the Soviet Union, the United States, Great Britain and France. Dealing with the wartime allies was a major task for the high commissioner. West Germany, made up of the zones occupied by the three western powers, had been granted control of its own affairs, except for defense and foreign policy, in 1949. While most Germans wanted a neutral and reunited Germany, the Eisenhower administration sought to reduce its defense spending by rearming Germany and replacing American troops with Germans. Meanwhile, the House Un-American Activities Committee slammed Conant&#x27;s staff as communist sympathizers and called for books by communist authors held in United States Information Agency (USIA) libraries in Germany to be burned.

The first crisis to occur on Conant&#x27;s watch was the uprising of 1953 in East Germany. This brought the reunification issue to the fore. Konrad Adenauer&#x27;s deft handling of the issue enabled him to handily win re-election as Chancellor of West Germany in September, but this also strengthened his hand in negotiations with Conant. Adenauer did not want his country to become a bargaining chip between the United States and the Soviet Union, nor did he want it to become a nuclear battlefield, a prospect raised by the arrival of American tactical nuclear weapons in 1953 as part of the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s New Look policy. Conant lobbied for the European Defense Community, which would have established a pan-European military. This seemed to be the only way that German rearmament would be accepted, but opposition from France killed the plan. In what Conant considered a minor miracle, France&#x27;s actions cleared the way for West Germany to become part of NATO with its own army.

At noon on May 6, 1955, Conant, along with the high commissioners from Britain and France, signed the documents ending Allied control of West Germany, admitting it to NATO, and allowing it to rearm. The office of the United States High Commissioner was abolished and Conant became instead the first United States Ambassador to West Germany. His role was now to encourage West Germany to build up its forces, while reassuring the Germans that doing so would not result in a United States withdrawal. Being fluent in German, Conant was able to give speeches to German audiences. He paid numerous visits to German educational and scientific organizations.

While high commissioner, Conant approved the release of many major and other German war criminals after serving only a fraction of their sentences, against protests from American political leaders and veterans&#x27; organizations (some of those sentenced had murdered American prisoners), accusing him of &quot;moral amnesia&quot;. Such criticism continued when as ambassador he supported the West German government&#x27;s leniency toward former Nazis.

===Carnegie Corporation grant recipient and author===

Conant returned to the United States in February 1957, where he leased an apartment on the Upper East Side in New York City. 

Between 1957 and 1965, the Carnegie Corporation of New York gave him over a million dollars to write studies of education. In 1959 he published &quot;The American High School Today&quot;, better known as the Conant Report. This became a best seller, resulting in Conant&#x27;s appearance on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine on September 14, 1959. In it, Conant called for a number of reforms, including the consolidation of high schools into larger bodies that could offer a broader range of curriculum choices. Although it was slammed by critics of the American system, who hoped for a system of education based on the European model, it did lead to a wave of reforms across the country. 

His subsequent &quot;Slums and Suburbs&quot; in 1961 was far more controversial in its treatment of racial issues. Regarding busing as impractical, Conant urged Americans &quot;to accept &quot;de facto&quot; segregated schools&quot;. This did not go over well with civil rights groups, and by 1964 Conant was forced to admit that he had been wrong. In &quot;The Education of American Teachers&quot; in 1963, Conant found much to criticize about the training of teachers. Most controversial was his defense of the arrangement by which teachers were certified by independent bodies rather than the teacher training colleges.

===Presidential Medal of Freedom and other recognition===
On December 6, 1963, President Lyndon Johnson presented Conant with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, with special distinction. He was selected for the award by President John F. Kennedy, but the ceremony was delayed prior to Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. 

In February 1970, President Richard Nixon presented Conant with the Atomic Pioneers Award from the Atomic Energy Commission. Other awards that Conant received during his long career included being made a Commander of Légion d&#x27;honneur by France in 1936 and an Honorary Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Britain in 1948, and he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1957. He was also awarded over 50 honorary degrees, and was posthumously inducted into the Alpha Chi Sigma Hall of Fame in 2000.

==Later years and death==
Between 1965 and 1969, Conant, living with a heart condition, worked on his biography, &quot;My Several Lives&quot;. He became increasingly infirm, and had a series of strokes in 1977. He died in a nursing home in Hanover, New Hampshire, on February 11, 1978. His body was cremated and his ashes interred in the Thayer-Richards family plot at Mount Auburn Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and sons. His papers are in the Harvard University Archives. Among them was a sealed brown Manila envelope that Conant had given the archives in 1951, with instructions that it was to be opened by the president of Harvard in the 21st century. Opened by Harvard&#x27;s 28th president, Drew Faust, in 2007, it contained a letter in which Conant expressed his hopes and fears for the future. &quot;You will... be in charge of a more prosperous and significant institution than the one over which I have the honor to preside&quot;, he wrote. &quot;That [Harvard] will maintain the traditions of academic freedom, of tolerance for heresy, I feel sure.&quot;

== Legacy ==
Conant is the namesake of James B. Conant High School in Hoffman Estates, Illinois, and James B. Conant Elementary School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan.

== Graduate students ==
Former graduate students of Conant include:
* Louis Fieser – organic chemist and professor emeritus at Harvard University renowned as the inventor of a militarily effective form of napalm. His award-winning research included work on blood-clotting agents including the first synthesis of vitamin K, synthesis and screening of quinones as antimalarial drugs, work with steroids leading to the synthesis of cortisone, and study of the nature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
* Benjamin S. Garvey – noted chemist at BF Goodrich who worked on the development of synthetic rubber, contributed to understanding of vulcanization, and developed early techniques for small scale evaluation of rubbers.
* Frank Westheimer – was the Morris Loeb Professor of Chemistry Emeritus at Harvard University.

<text>Jolene Blalock ( ; born March 5, 1975) is an American actress and model. She is best known for playing the Vulcan first officer and science officer T&#x27;Pol on the science-fiction series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. Her other work includes guest-star appearances on television series and in films.

==Early life==
Blalock was born and raised in San Diego, California, with three siblings. She spent her childhood surfing and developing artistic skills.

==Career==
===Early work===
Blalock left home at age 17 to model in Europe and Asia. She has appeared on the cover of many men&#x27;s lifestyle magazines, was twice featured in &quot;Maxim&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Girls of Maxim&quot; gallery, and was named the 10th sexiest woman in the world in 2003 by &quot;FHM&quot;. She posed for a clothed fashion layout in &quot;Playboy&quot; in April 2002, and was later interviewed by the magazine for its &quot;20Q&quot; section in February 2005.

She made her television debut on the sitcom &quot;Veronica&#x27;s Closet&quot;, before guest appearances on &quot;Love Boat: The Next Wave&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;JAG.&quot; She appeared as Medea in a television movie adaptation of &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (2000). She also appeared in the movie &quot;On the Edge&quot; (2001) and the miniseries &quot;The Diamond Hunters&quot; (2001) before being cast on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. She appeared in the music video &quot;Denise&quot; (1999) by Fountains of Wayne.

===&quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; (2001–2005)===
Landing one of the leading roles on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; was Blalock&#x27;s biggest break. About her time on the show, she recalled:

In &quot;Enterprise&quot;, Blalock played Subcommander T&#x27;Pol, a Vulcan diplomat on Earth who was initially assigned by Vulcan Ambassador Soval (a recurring role played by Gary Graham) as an observer on the ship&#x27;s first mission, in the pilot episode &quot;Broken Bow&quot;. At the end of that episode, she is asked to remain on &quot;Enterprise&quot; as its Science Officer by Captain Jonathan Archer (played by Scott Bakula). As the series progressed, she assumed the position of First Officer, and at the start of the third season Xindi arc, she resigns her Vulcan position to remain on &quot;Enterprise&quot; when the Vulcan High Command orders her back to Vulcan. Early in the fourth season, she formalizes her position in Starfleet and is granted a field commission of Commander, retaining her role as the ship&#x27;s First Officer, where she remained for the rest of the series.

Blalock has not participated in conventions or given interviews regarding her role on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; except for FedCon XIV in May 2005, but did agree to join a 2013 cast reunion for an interview during the Blu-ray conversion and production. She also appeared as a parody version of herself attending a &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention in a 2009 episode of the sitcom &quot;10 Items or Less&quot; titled &quot;Star Trok.&quot;

Attending her first Trek event in almost a decade, Blalock walked the red carpet for 2021&#x27;s Star Trek Day on September 8, 2021.

===2003–2017===
Blalock appeared in the film &quot;Slow Burn&quot;, which was shot in 2003 between seasons two and three of &quot;Enterprise&quot;, unveiled at the Toronto International Film Festival in September 2005, and saw limited theatrical release in 2007.

Blalock guest-starred in two episodes of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; as Ishta, leader of a group of rebel female warriors.

Blalock was scheduled to appear on an episode of &quot;Lost&quot; during the 2005–2006 season. Though she filmed some scenes, they were never used in an episode nor featured as &quot;deleted scenes&quot; in the DVD set&#x27;s bonus material. Set photos from the shooting of a scene surfaced in 2008.

In &quot;Starship Troopers 3: Marauder&quot;, which was released direct-to-video on August 5, 2008, Blalock played Captain Lola Beck who led a mixed group of survivors on a journey across an alien infested wasteland.

Blalock played Lexa, the wife of a hospitalized porn star, in the 2009 episode &quot;Teamwork&quot; on the series &quot;House&quot;.

In the second season of &quot;Legend of the Seeker&quot;, appearing in the January 2009 episodes &quot;Dark&quot; and &quot;Perdition&quot;, Blalock played Sister Nicci, a Sister of the Dark.

Blalock had a supporting role as Stacy in the action thriller &quot;Sinners and Saints&quot; (2010).

Blalock&#x27;s most recent film roles were in the direct-to-video &quot;Killing Frisco&quot; (2014) and then the TV movie &quot;A Man for Every Month&quot; (2017).

===2024===
Blalock briefly returned to acting to voice an alternate universe version of her &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot; character in the &quot;Star Trek: Lower Decks&quot; fifth season episode &quot;Fissure Quest&quot;. She was credited mononymously as Jolene in the episode.

==Personal life==
Blalock is married to Michael Rapino, CEO of Live Nation. Rapino lived in England and Blalock lived in the U.S. while working on &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise.&quot; She proposed to him and they married in Negril, Jamaica, on April 22, 2003. They have three sons, born in 2010, 2012, and 2014. Rapino and Blalock founded the Rapino Foundation, which helps populations in the developing world.

Blalock is a dog fancier and has appeared on the cover of the UK&#x27;s &quot;K9 Magazine&quot;.

<doc id="355002" wikidata="Q503710" url="?curid=355002" title="Tim Armstrong">
<text>Timothy Ross Armstrong (born November 25, 1965) is an American musician, songwriter and record producer. Known for his distinctive voice, he is the singer/guitarist for the punk rock band Rancid and hip hop/punk rock supergroup Transplants. Prior to forming Rancid, Armstrong was in the ska punk band Operation Ivy.

In 1997, along with Brett Gurewitz of the band Bad Religion and owner of Epitaph Records, Armstrong founded Hellcat Records. In 2012, through his website, Armstrong started releasing music that influenced him, along with stripped-down cover songs of his own under the name Tim Timebomb. Armstrong is also a songwriter for other artists. Armstrong won a Grammy Award for his work with Jimmy Cliff and Pink, and has also worked with Joe Walsh and the Interrupters.

== Personal life ==
At the age of five, Armstrong met Matt Freeman while playing Little League Baseball. They grew up a few blocks apart in Albany, California, where Armstrong lived with his mother, father, and older brother, Jeff. Freeman and Armstrong formed bands many years later based on their shared love of bands such as the Clash and the Ramones. They both went to Albany High School.

Armstrong&#x27;s relationship with Bikini Kill drummer Tobi Vail inspired the Rancid song &quot;Olympia, WA&quot; from &quot;...And Out Come the Wolves&quot;.

He was married to musician Brody Dalle from 1997 to 2003. They met in 1995, when Dalle was 16 and Armstrong was 30, after Rancid and Dalle&#x27;s band Sourpuss both played Summersault Festival in Australia. In 1997, when Dalle was 18, she moved to Los Angeles to live with Armstrong, and she formed the band the Distillers. The couple separated in 2003, after Armstrong saw a picture of Dalle kissing Queens of the Stone Age frontman Josh Homme in an issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine; she and Homme would later marry. Homme claimed he received death threats from Armstrong&#x27;s fans. Dalle claimed Armstrong was very controlling of her and it took her three years to leave him. Some of Rancid&#x27;s songs on 1998&#x27;s &quot;Life Won&#x27;t Wait&quot; (&quot;Who Would&#x27;ve Thought&quot;, &quot;Corazón de Oro&quot;) detail Armstrong and Dalle&#x27;s relationship, and songs on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Indestructible&quot; (&quot;Fall Back Down&quot;, &quot;Ghost Band&quot;, &quot;Tropical London&quot;) deal with Armstrong&#x27;s feelings about his divorce.

Armstrong&#x27;s cousin, Scott, was the guitarist for Canadian punk band Desperate Minds, but they did not know each other until they were introduced at a show in Chicago in 1988 by John Jughead of Screeching Weasel.

== Music career ==
=== Basic Radio ===
Basic Radio was founded in 1985 and included Matt Freeman and Tim Armstrong. The band never released any albums or EPs, but recorded demos and were featured on local compilations. Two years later they broke up, and Operation Ivy was founded shortly after.

=== Operation Ivy ===
In 1987, along with singer Jesse Michaels, bassist Matt Freeman and drummer Dave Mello, Armstrong formed the ska punk band Operation Ivy and enjoyed modest success before the group disbanded in 1989, the same night the album was released. The band would go on to achieve worldwide cult success in the years following its break-up.

=== Dance Hall Crashers ===
Dance Hall Crashers (named after the Alton Ellis song &quot;Dance Crasher&quot;) was formed in 1989 by Armstrong and Matt Freeman after both musicians expressed an interest in starting a band rooted in more traditional ska and rocksteady than what they had been playing with Operation Ivy. The first line-up featured Armstrong on vocals and Freeman on guitar, as well as drummer Erik Larsen, keyboardist Joey Schaaf, vocalist Andrew Champion, guitarist Grant McIntire, and bassist Joel Wing. The band played their first show at 924 Gilman Street in Berkeley in 1989. Shortly after their debut, Freeman and Armstrong left to pursue other interests.

=== Downfall ===
Downfall featured Armstrong, Freeman, and Mello, as well as Mello&#x27;s brother Pat, and Jason Hammon (also a later member of Dance Hall Crashers). Pat and Jason would both play guitar, while Armstrong took up duties on vocals. They lasted three months (December 1989 to March 1990), playing only at a few parties and twice at Gilman St. They released one song on Maximumrocknroll&#x27;s &quot;They Don&#x27;t Get Paid, They Don&#x27;t Get Laid, but Boy, Do They Work Hard!&quot; compilation, one song on David Hayes&#x27; &quot;Very Small World&quot; compilation, one song on Lookout! Records&#x27; &quot;Can of Pork&quot; compilation, and recorded a demo. It disbanded when Freeman joined MDC on bass while Armstrong was a roadie for the band, while Pat and Dave went on to form Schlong.

=== Rancid ===
As time went on, Armstrong suffered from depression and alcoholism, and eventually became homeless. During this time, Freeman suggested the two start a new band together, partially in hopes of curbing Armstrong&#x27;s alcohol addiction. Armstrong began writing songs in 1991 that would appear on their first album which was released in 1993. Their new band, Rancid, would eventually go on to become one of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful punk rock bands of all time. Rancid has released ten studio albums since their formation with their latest, &quot;Tomorrow Never Comes&quot;, being released in 2023.

=== The Transplants ===
In 1999, Armstrong invited roadie Rob Aston (&quot;Skinhead Rob&quot;) to add lyrics to some solo material that Armstrong had been creating in his basement, and the two worked together writing and recording music. They formed the group Transplants with drummer Travis Barker, of Blink-182, and released their self-titled debut album on October 22, 2002. A second Transplants album, &quot;Haunted Cities&quot;, was released on June 21, 2005. The Transplants break-up was confirmed by Rob Aston on January 16, 2006, when he told a reporter that the group had split. However, Barker later announced that the trio was working on a new album. They played their first show since 2006 on Conan to promote Barker&#x27;s new solo album, on which the song &quot;Saturday Night&quot; is featured. It was announced in November 2011 on the Transplants&#x27; official Facebook page that their new album would be &quot;finished&quot; in December 2011. Their latest album, entitled &quot;Take Cover&quot;, was released October 13, 2017, on Epitaph Records.

=== Solo albums/Tim Timebomb ===

In 2007, he released his first solo album entitled &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Life&quot; with the Aggrolites as his backing band. The track from that album &quot;Into Action&quot; was reported as the number one most played and requested in 2007 on then XM Satellite Radio channel Fungus 53.

In 2012, he launched a side project under the name Tim Timebomb, initially releasing a download only album, entitled &quot;Tim Timebomb Sings Songs from RocknNRoll Theater&quot;, containing songs from his musical film series. Since October 29, 2012, he has released a series of songs via YouTube, at a rate of one track each day starting on October 29, 2012. These songs make up a series of download only singles, to date more than 200 tracks have been released, a mixture of original compositions, covers, and re-workings of his previous songs, including those of Rancid.

=== DOOM Regulator ===
In March 2023, Armstrong announced the formation of a new band called Bad Optix that featured his former Operation Ivy bandmate Jesse Michaels, Circle Jerks drummer Joey Castillo and Trash Talk bassist Spencer Pollard. The group released their first single called &quot;Raid&quot; and Armstrong promised tons more songs to come. &quot;I always felt a little sadness that Jesse and I stopped making music together. But we never lost touch. And then it happened. A few years ago we started writing songs again! A couple of the songs ended up on Grade 2&#x27;s record. Jesse and I just started writing again a lot. It came back. Just like that. Like when we were kids. There is a special chemistry between us and I don&#x27;t take it for granted&quot; Armstrong said. Less than a week after announcing the formation of the band, the band changed their name to DOOM Regulator due to a band from Seattle already being called Bad Optics.

=== Other projects ===
Armstrong produced and co-wrote eight songs with Pink for her 2003 album &quot;Try This&quot;. Her song, &quot;Trouble&quot;, a 2003 Rancid outtake, went on to win her a Grammy Award. He has also contributed guest vocals on songs for such bands as Bad Religion, 7 Seconds (band), Time Again, the Matches, Mest, Good Charlotte, Head Automatica, the Aggrolites, the Interrupters, Cypress Hill, and Box Car Racer. He and Matt Freeman also play in a psychobilly band called Devils Brigade, and he co-produced their debut album.

It was announced on August 12, 2011, that Tim Armstrong was working on an album with reggae artist Jimmy Cliff. Their first single, a cover of the Clash song &quot;The Guns of Brixton&quot;, was released on October 4, 2011. Sacred Fire EP was released late November 2011. Rebirth was released in July 2012 and won the Grammy Award for Best Reggae Album. And in 2012, Armstrong wrote and performed on Joe Walsh&#x27;s song &quot;Hi-Roller Baby&quot; from his solo album Analog Man. Armstrong also helped with Anti-Flag&#x27;s song &quot;Brandenburg Gate&quot;.

Though they share a last name and frequently collaborate, Armstrong and Green Day frontman Billie Joe Armstrong are not related. Green Day has covered Operation Ivy songs on their past albums, Billie Joe Armstrong co-wrote and performed on Rancid&#x27;s song &quot;Radio&quot;, and was invited by Tim Armstrong to join Rancid as a second guitarist in 1993. He declined, and Lars Frederiksen got the job. Tim directed the music video for Green Day&#x27;s 2016 single &quot;Bang Bang&quot;. He also plays a punk, seen during the song&#x27;s bridge. In 2017, Tim Armstrong and Billie Joe Armstrong, together with Tim&#x27;s nephew Rey Armstrong and Billie Joe&#x27;s son Joey Armstrong, formed the band the Armstrongs and released their first single &quot;If There Was Ever a Time&quot;.

Armstrong also co-produced the EP &quot;Footprints and Broken Branches&quot; in 2019 by the Los Angeles-based country musician Rosy Nolan along with Kenny Feinstein of the band Water Tower.

In May 2021, Armstrong along with fellow Rancid bandmate Matt Freeman, Fletcher Dragge (Pennywise), Byron McMackin (Pennywise), and Mike Muir (Suicidal Tendencies) formed a punk rock supergroup called the Crew. The band&#x27;s first single, &quot;One Voice&quot;, was released on Epitaph Records.

== Hellcat Records ==
Armstrong started Hellcat Records in 1997 as a sub-label of Epitaph, owned by Armstrong&#x27;s friend and Bad Religion member Brett Gurewitz. Armstrong acts as a talent scout for Hellcat, and has final say concerning what groups are signed to the label. Armstrong was one of the owners of the merchandise manufacturer Machete Mfg, which provides merchandise for bands on Hellcat Records.

== Signature model guitars ==
In 2010, Gretsch Guitars introduced the G5191BK Tim Armstrong Electromatic guitar. The single cutaway hollowbody electric guitar featured a 17&quot; wide body in a flat-black urethane finish, parallel tone bars and sound post, two &quot;Black Top&quot; Filter&#x27;Tron pickups, Grover tuners, big block fretboard inlays, a harp tailpiece and gold-plated hardware. Gretsch advertising for the model prominently features Armstrong with the guitar. Armstrong&#x27;s signature model is based on his 1971 Baldwin-era Gretsch Country Club which he spray-painted black and flipped to accommodate his left-handed playing.

The signature model is available in both right and left-handed models. Fender also put out a signature acoustic model based on Armstrong&#x27;s favorite 1960s era Fender acoustic guitar. The &quot;Hellcat&quot; has hellcat inlays in the 3rd, 5th, 7th and 9th fret positions and two skulls in the 12th fret. It is outfitted with a tortoise shell pick guard and Fishman brand electronics. It is available in right and left handed models, as well as a 12-string version.

<text>In computing, an icon is a pictogram or ideogram displayed on a computer screen in order to help the user navigate a computer system. The icon itself is a quickly comprehensible symbol of a software tool, function, or a data file, accessible on the system and is more like a traffic sign than a detailed illustration of the actual entity it represents. It can serve as an electronic hyperlink or file shortcut to access the program or data. The user can activate an icon using a mouse, pointer, finger, or voice commands. Their placement on the screen, also in relation to other icons, may provide further information to the user about their usage. In activating an icon, the user can move directly into and out of the identified function without knowing anything further about the location or requirements of the file or code.

Icons as parts of the graphical user interface of a computer system, in conjunction with windows, menus and a pointing device (mouse), belong to the much larger topic of the history of the graphical user interface that has largely supplanted the text-based interface for casual use.

== Overview ==

The computing definition of &quot;icon&quot; can include three distinct semiotical elements: 
Icon, which resembles its referent (such as a road sign for falling rocks).
This category includes stylized drawings of objects from the office environment or from other professional areas such as printers, scissors, file cabinets and folders.

Index, which is associated with its referent (smoke is a sign of fire).
This category includes stylized drawings used to refer to actions &quot;printer&quot; and &quot;print&quot;, &quot;scissors&quot; and &quot;cut&quot; or &quot;magnifying glass&quot; and &quot;search&quot;.

Symbol, which is related to its referent only by convention (letters, musical notation, mathematical operators etc.).

This category includes standardized symbols found across many electronic devices, such as the power on/off symbol and the USB icon. 

The majority of icons are encoded and decoded using metonymy, synecdoche, and metaphor.
An example of metaphorical representation characterizes all the major desktop-based computer systems including the desktop that uses an iconic representation of objects from the 1980s office environment to transpose attributes from a familiar context/object to an unfamiliar one. This is known as skeuomorphism, and an example is the use of the floppy disk to represent saving data; even though floppy disks have been obsolete for roughly a quarter century, it is still recognized as &quot;the save icon&quot;.

Metonymy is in itself a subset of metaphors that use one entity to point to another related to it such as using a fluorescent bulb instead of a filament one to represent power saving settings.

Synecdoche is considered as a special case of metonymy, in the usual sense of the part standing for the whole such as a single component for the entire system, speaker driver for the entire audio system settings.

Additionally, a group of icons can be categorised as brand icons, used to identify commercial software programs and are related to the brand identity of a company or software. These commercial icons serve as functional links on the system to the program or data files created by a specific software provider. Although icons are usually depicted in graphical user interfaces, icons are sometimes rendered in a TUI using special characters such as MouseText or PETSCII.

The design of all computer icons is constricted by the limitations of the device display. They are limited in size, with the standard size of about a thumbnail for both desktop computer systems and mobile devices. They are frequently scalable, as they are displayed in different positions in the software, a single icon file such as the Apple Icon Image format can include multiple versions of the same icon optimized to work at a different size, in colour or grayscale as well as on dark and bright backgrounds.

The colors used, for both the image and the icon background, should stand out on different system backgrounds and among each other. The detailing of the icon image needs to be simple, remaining recognizable in varying graphical resolutions and screen sizes. Computer icons are by definition language-independent but often not culturally independent; they do not rely on letters or words to convey their meaning. These visual parameters place rigid limits on the design of icons, frequently requiring the skills of a graphic artist in their development.

Because of their condensed size and versatility, computer icons have become a mainstay of user interaction with electronic media. Icons also provide rapid entry into the system functionality. On most systems, users can create and delete, replicate, select, click or double-click standard computer icons and drag them to new positions on the screen to create a customized user environment.

== Types ==

=== Standardized electrical device symbols ===

A series of recurring computer icons are taken from the broader field of standardized symbols used across a wide range of electrical equipment. Examples of these are the power symbol and the USB icon, which are found on a wide variety of electronic devices. The standardization of electronic icons is an important safety-feature on all types of electronics, enabling a user to more easily navigate an unfamiliar system. As a subset of electronic devices, computer systems and mobile devices use many of the same icons; they are corporated into the design of both the computer hardware and on the software. On the hardware, these icons identify the functionality of specific buttons and plugs. In the software, they provide a link into the customizable settings.

System warning icons also belong to the broader area of ISO standard warning signs. These warning icons, first designed to regulate automobile traffic in the early 1900s, have become standardized and widely understood by users without the necessity of further verbal explanations. In designing software operating systems, different companies have incorporated and defined these standard symbols as part of their graphical user interface. For example, the Microsoft MSDN defines the standard icon use of error, warning, information and question mark icons as part of their software development guidelines.

Different organizations are actively involved in standardizing these icons, as well as providing guidelines for their creation and use. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) has defined &quot;Graphical symbols for use on equipment&quot;, published as IEC 417, a document which displays IEC standardized icons. Another organization invested in the promotion of effective icon usage is the ICT (information and communications technologies), which has published guidelines for the creation and use of icons. Many of these icons are available on the Internet, either to purchase or as freeware to incorporate into new software.

=== Metaphorical icons ===
An icon is a &quot;signifier&quot; pointing to the &quot;signified&quot;. Easily comprehendible icons will make use of familiar visual metaphors directly connected to the &quot;signified&quot;: actions the icon initiate or the content that would be revealed. Metaphors, metonymy and synecdoche are used to encode the meaning in an icon system.

The &quot;signified&quot; can have multiple natures: virtual objects such as files and applications, actions within a system or an application (e.g. snap a picture, delete, rewind, connect/disconnect etc...), action in the physical world (e.g. print, eject DVD, change volume or brightness etc...) as well as physical objects (e.g. monitor, compact disk, mouse, printer etc...).

=== The Desktop metaphor ===

A subgroup of the more visually rich icons is based on objects lifted from a 1970 physical office space and desktop environment. It includes the basic icons used for a file, file folder, trashcan, inbox, together with the spatial real estate of the screen, i.e. the electronic desktop. This model originally enabled users, familiar with common office practices and functions, to intuitively navigate the computer desktop and system. (Desktop Metaphor, pg 2). The icons stand for objects or functions accessible on the system and enable the user to do tasks common to an office space. These desktop computer icons developed over several decades; data files in the 1950s, the hierarchical storage system (i.e. the file folder and filing cabinet) in the 1960s, and finally the desktop metaphor itself (including the trashcan) in the 1970s.

Dr. David Canfield Smith associated the term &quot;icon&quot; with computing in his landmark 1975 PhD thesis &quot;Pygmalion: A Creative Programming Environment&quot;. In his work, Dr. Smith envisioned a scenario in which &quot;visual entities&quot;, called icons, could execute lines of programming code, and save the operation for later re-execution. Dr. Smith later served as one of the principal designers of the Xerox Star, which became the first commercially available personal computing system based on the desktop metaphor when it was released in 1981. &quot;The icons on [the desktop] are visible concrete embodiments of the corresponding physical objects.&quot; The desktop and icons displayed in this first desktop model are easily recognizable by users several decades later, and display the main components of the desktop metaphor GUI.

This model of the desktop metaphor has been adopted by most personal computing systems in the last decades of the 20th century; it remains popular as a &quot;simple intuitive navigation by single user on single system.&quot; It is only at the beginning of the 21st century that personal computing is evolving a new metaphor based on Internet connectivity and teams of users, cloud computing. In this new model, data and tools are no longer stored on the single system, instead they are stored someplace else, &quot;in the cloud&quot;. The cloud metaphor is replacing the desktop model; it remains to be seen how many of the common desktop icons (file, file folder, trashcan, inbox, filing cabinet) find a place in this new metaphor.

=== Brand icons for commercial software ===
A further type of computer icon is more related to the brand identity of the software programs available on the computer system. These brand icons are bundled with their product and installed on a system with the software. They function in the same way as the hyperlink icons described above, representing functionality accessible on the system and providing links to either a software program or data file. Over and beyond this, they act as a company identifier and advertiser for the software or company.

Because these company and program logos represent the company and product itself, much attention is given to their design, done frequently by commercial artists. To regulate the use of these brand icons, they are trademark registered and are considered part of the company&#x27;s intellectual property.

In closed systems such as iOS and Android, the use of icons is to a degree regulated or guided 
 to create a sense of consistency in the UI.

=== Overlay icons ===

On some GUI systems (e.g. Windows), on an icon which represents an object (e.g. a file) a certain additional subsystem can add a smaller secondary icon, laid over the primary icon and usually positioned in one of its corners, to indicate the status of the object which is represented with the primary icon. For instance, the subsystem for locking files can add a &quot;padlock&quot; overlay icon on an icon which represents a file in order to indicate that the file is locked.

== Placement and spacing ==

In order to display the number of icons representing the growing complexity offered on a device, different systems have come up with different solutions for screen space management. The computer monitor continues to display primary icons on the main page or desktop, allowing easy and quick access to the most commonly used functions for a user. This screen space also invites almost immediate user customization, as the user adds favourite icons to the screen and groups related icons together on the screen. Secondary icons of system programs are also displayed on the task bar or the system dock. These secondary icons do not provide a link like the primary icons, instead, they are used to show availability of a tool or file on the system.

Spatial management techniques play a bigger role in mobile devices with their much smaller screen real estate. In response, mobile devices have introduced, among other visual devices, scrolling screen displays and selectable tabs displaying groups of related icons. Even with these evolving display systems, the icons themselves remain relatively constant in both appearance and function.

Above all, the icon itself must remain clearly identifiable on the display screen regardless of its position and size. Programs might display their icon not only as a desktop hyperlink, but also in the program title bar, on the Start menu, in the Microsoft tray or the Apple dock. In each of these locations, the primary purpose is to identify and advertise the program and functionality available. This need for recognition in turn sets specific design restrictions on effective computer icons.

== Design ==

In order to maintain consistency in the look of a device, OS manufacturers offer detailed guidelines for the development and use of icons on their systems. This is true for both standard system icons and third party application icons to be included in the system. The system icons currently in use have typically gone through widespread international acceptance and understandability testing. Icon design factors have also been the topic for extensive usability studies. The design itself involves a high level of skill in combining an attractive graphic design with the required usability features.

=== Shape ===
The icon needs to be clear and easily recognizable, able to display on monitors of widely varying size and resolutions. Its shape should be simple with clean lines, without too much detailing in the design. Together with the other design details, the shape also needs to make it unique on the display and clearly distinguishable from other icons.

=== Color ===
The icon needs to be colorful enough to easily pick out on the display screen, and contrast well with any background. With the increasing ability to customize the desktop, it is important for the icon itself to display in a standard color which cannot be modified, retaining its characteristic appearance for immediate recognition by the user. Through color it should also provide some visual indicator as to the icon state; activated, available or currently not accessible (&quot;greyed out&quot;).

=== Size and scalability ===

The standard icon is generally the size of an adult thumb, enabling both easy visual recognition and use in a touchscreen device. For individual devices the display size correlates directly to the size of the screen real estate and the resolution of the display. Because they are used in multiple locations on the screen, the design must remain recognizable at the smallest size, for use in a directory tree or title bar, while retaining an attractive shape in the larger sizes. In addition to scaling, it may be necessary to remove visual details or simplify the subject between discrete sizes. Larger icons serve also as part of the accessibility features for the visually impaired on many computer systems. The width and height of the icon are the same (1:1 aspect ratio) in almost all areas of traditional use.

=== Motion ===

Icons can also be augmented with iconographic motion - geometric manipulations applied to a graphical element over time, for example, a scale, rotation, or other deformation. One example is when application icons &quot;wobble&quot; in iOS to convey to the user they are able to be repositioned by being dragged. This is different from an icon with animated graphics, such as a Throbber. In contrast to static icons and icons with animated graphics, kinetic behaviors do not alter the visual content of an element (whereas fades, blurs, tints, and addition of new graphics, such as badges, exclusively alter an icon&#x27;s pixels). Stated differently, pixels in an icon can be moved, rotated, stretched, and so on - but not altered or added to. Research has shown iconographic motion can act as a powerful and reliable visual cue, a critical property for icons to embody.

=== Localization ===

In its primary function as a symbolic image, the icon design should ideally be divorced from any single language. For products which are targeting the international marketplace, the primary design consideration is that the icon is non-verbal; localizing text in icons is costly and time-consuming.

=== Cultural context ===

Beyond text, there are other design elements which can be dependent upon the cultural context for interpretation. These include color, numbers, symbols, body parts and hand gestures. Each of these elements needs to be evaluated for their meaning and relevance across all markets targeted by the product.

== Related visual tools ==

Other graphical devices used in the computer user interface fulfill GUI functions on the system similar to the computer icons described above. However each of these related graphical devices differs in one way or another from the standard computer icon.

=== Windows ===

The graphical windows on the computer screen share some of the visual and functional characteristics of the computer icon. Windows can be minimized to an icon format to serve as a hyperlink to the window itself. Multiple windows can be open and even overlapping on the screen. However where the icon provides a single button to initiate some function, the principal function of the window is a workspace, which can be minimized to an icon hyperlink when not in use.

=== Control widgets ===

Over time, certain GUI widgets have gradually appeared which are useful in many contexts. These are graphical controls which are used across computer systems and can be intuitively manipulated by the user even in a new context because the user recognises them from having seen them in a more familiar context. Examples of these control widgets are scroll bars, sliders, listboxes and buttons used in many programs. Using these widgets, a user is able to define and manipulate the data and the display for the software program they are working with. The first set of computer widgets was originally developed for the Xerox Alto. Now they are commonly bundled in widget toolkits and distributed as part of a development package. These control widgets are standardized pictograms used in the graphical interface, they offer an expanded set of user functionalities beyond the hyperlink function of computer icons.

=== Emoticons ===

Another GUI icon is exemplified by the smiley face, a pictogram embedded in a text message. The smiley, and by extension other emoticons, are used in computer text to convey information in a non-verbal binary shorthand, frequently involving the emotional context of the message. These icons were first developed for computers in the 1980s as a response to the limited storage and transmission bandwidth used in electronic messaging. Since then they have become both abundant and more sophisticated in their keyboard representations of varying emotions. They have developed from keyboard character combinations into real icons. They are widely used in all forms of electronic communications, always with the goal of adding context to the verbal content of the message. In adding an emotional overlay to the text, they have also enabled electronic messages to substitute for and frequently supplant voice-to-voice messaging.

These emoticons are very different from the icon hyperlinks described above. They do not serve as links, and are not part of any system function or computer software. Instead they are part of the communication language of users across systems. For these computer icons, customization and modifications are not only possible but in fact expected of the user.

=== Hyperlinks ===

A text hyperlink performs much the same function as the functional computer icon: it provides a direct link to some function or data available on the system. Although they can be customized, these text hyperlinks generally share a standardized recognizable format, blue text with underlining. Hyperlinks differ from functional computer icons in that they are normally embedded in text, whereas icons are displayed as stand-alone on the screen real estate. They are also displayed in text, either as the link itself or a friendly name, whereas icons are defined as being primarily non-textual.

== Icon creation ==
Because of the design requirements, icon creation can be a time-consuming and costly process. There are a plethora of icon creation tools to be found on the Internet, ranging from professional level tools through utilities bundled with software development programs to stand-alone freeware. Given this wide availability of icon tools and icon sets, a problem can arise with custom icons which are mismatched in style to the other icons included on the system.

=== Tools ===

Icons underwent a change in appearance from the early 8-bit pixel art used pre-2000 to a more photorealistic appearance featuring effects such as softening, sharpening, edge enhancement, a glossy or glass-like appearance, or drop shadows which are rendered with an alpha channel.

Icon editors used on these early platforms usually contain a rudimentary raster image editor capable of modifying images of an icon pixel by pixel, by using simple drawing tools, or by applying simple image filters. Professional icon designers seldom modify icons inside an icon editor and use a more advanced drawing or 3D modeling application instead.

The main function performed by an icon editor is generation of icons from images. An icon editor resamples a source image to the resolution and color depth required for an icon. Other functions performed by icon editors are icon extraction from executable files (exe, dll), creation of icon libraries, or saving individual images of an icon.

All icon editors can make icons for system files (folders, text files, etc.), and for web pages.
These have a file extension of .ICO for Windows and web pages or .ICNS for the Macintosh. If the editor can also make a cursor, the image can be saved with a file extension of .CUR or .ANI for both Windows and the Macintosh. Using a new icon is simply a matter of moving the image into the correct file folder and using the system tools to select the icon. In Windows XP you could go to My Computer, open Tools on the explorer window, choose Folder Options, then File Types, select a file type, click on Advanced and select an icon to be associated with that file type.

Developers also use icon editors to make icons for specific program files. Assignment of an icon to a newly created program is usually done within the Integrated Development Environment used to develop that program. However, if one is creating an application in the Windows API he or she can simply add a line to the program&#x27;s resource script before compilation. Many icon editors can copy a unique icon from a program file for editing. Only a few can assign an icon to a program file, a much more difficult task.

Simple icon editors and image-to-icon converters are also available online as web applications.

<text>Linda Park (born July 9, 1978) is a South Korean-born American actress, best known for her portrayal of communications officer Hoshi Sato in the television series &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;.

==Early life==
Park was born in South Korea and raised in San Jose, California. She participated in a number of theatrical productions in her teens at Notre Dame High School and Bellarmine College Preparatory.

In 2000, she received a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree from Boston University. During her college career, she spent a semester in England, studying at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Her college stage credits included &quot;Mad Forest&quot;, &quot;Lysistrata&quot;, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot;, and &quot;The Trojan Women&quot;.

==Career==

In 2001, Park had a small role in the feature film &quot;Jurassic Park III&quot; (2001) as Ellie Satler&#x27;s assistant.

Also in 2001, less than a year after graduation, she was cast as Hoshi Sato in &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, the sixth series of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, which premiered in September 2001. Sato is the ship&#x27;s communications officer, with a natural gift for translating alien languages. Park herself is fluent in English and Korean, and also speaks some French. She starred in all four seasons of &quot;Enterprise,&quot; appearing in 98 episodes until the series’ cancellation in 2004.

In August 2003, Park produced and starred in her first short film, &quot;My Prince, My Angel&quot; (2003).

In October 2003, she starred in UA&#x27;s world premiere of the Mary Fengar Gail’s play &quot;Fuchsia&quot;. From October 19 to November 11, 2005, she played Clytemnestra in a New York City production of &quot;Agamemnon&quot;. In 2011, she played Anne Deever in a production of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;All My Sons&quot; at the Matrix Theater in Los Angeles. She is also the co-founder of the theater company Underground Asylum.

In 2009, Park became a series regular in the second season of &quot;Crash&quot;, playing Maggie Cheon on the Starz Network; she co-starred in 13 episodes. The show was subsequently cancelled after the death of Dennis Hopper.

==Personal life==
Park married actor Daniel Bess on October 11, 2014. On June 17, 2018, she gave birth to their son. On February 14, 2024, Park announced that she and Bess had been separated for over a year and were no longer husband and wife.

Park was diagnosed with lupus in 1997.

Park is an active student of dance, remarking that &quot;dancing has always been my second love&quot;. She has continued to study and practice ballet and other dance forms.

<doc id="355024" wikidata="Q193893" url="?curid=355024" title="Capital (architecture)">
<text>In architecture, the capital () or chapiter forms the topmost member of a column (or a pilaster). It mediates between the column and the load thrusting down upon it, broadening the area of the column&#x27;s supporting surface. The capital, projecting on each side as it rises to support the abacus, joins the usually square abacus and the usually circular shaft of the column. The capital may be convex, as in the Doric order; concave, as in the inverted bell of the Corinthian order; or scrolling out, as in the Ionic order. These form the three principal types on which all capitals in the classical tradition are based. 

The Composite order was formalized in the 16th century following Roman Imperial examples such as the Arch of Titus in Rome. It adds Ionic volutes to Corinthian acanthus leaves.

From the highly visible position it occupies in all colonnaded monumental buildings, the capital is often selected for ornamentation; and is often the clearest indicator of the architectural order. The treatment of its detail may be an indication of the building&#x27;s date.

Capitals occur in many styles of architecture, before and after the classical architecture in which they are so prominent.

==Pre-classical Antiquity==
===Egyptian===
The two earliest Egyptian capitals of importance are those based on the lotus and papyrus plants respectively, and these, with the palm tree capital, were the chief types employed by the Egyptians, until under the Ptolemies in the 3rd to 1st centuries BC, various other river plants were also employed, and the conventional lotus capital went through various modifications.

Many motifs of Egyptian ornamentation are symbolic, such as the scarab, or sacred beetle, the solar disk, and the vulture. Other common motifs include palm leaves, the papyrus plant, and the buds and flowers of the lotus.

Some of the most popular types of capitals were the Hathor, lotus, papyrus and Egyptian composite. Most of the types are based on vegetal motifs. Capitals of some columns were painted in bright colors.


===Assyrian===
Some kind of volute capital is shown in the Assyrian bas-reliefs, but no Assyrian capital has ever been found; the enriched bases exhibited in the British Museum were initially misinterpreted as capitals.

===Persian===

In the Achaemenid Persian capital, the brackets are carved with two heavily decorated back-to-back animals projecting right and left to support the architrave; on their backs they carry other brackets at right angles to support the cross timbers. The bull is the most common, but there are also lions and griffins. The capital extends below for further than in most other styles, with decoration drawn from the many cultures that the Persian Empire conquered including Egypt, Babylon, and Lydia. There are double volutes at the top and, inverted, bottom of a long plain fluted section which is square, although the shaft of the column is round, and also fluted.

===Aegean===
The earliest Aegean capital is that shown in the frescoes at Knossos in Crete (1600 BC); it was of the convex type, probably moulded in stucco. Capitals of the second, concave type, include the richly carved examples of the columns flanking the Tomb of Agamemnon in Mycenae (c. 1100 BC): they are carved with a chevron device, and with a concave apophyge on which the buds of some flowers are sculpted.

===Proto-Aeolic===
Volute capitals, also known as proto-Aeolic capitals, are encountered in Iron-Age Southern Levant and ancient Cyprus, many of them in royal architectural contexts in the kingdoms of Israel and Judah starting from the 9th century BCE, as well as in Moab, Ammon, and at Cypriot sites such as the city-state of Tamassos in the Archaic period.

== Classical Antiquity ==
The orders, structural systems for organising component parts, played a crucial role in the Greeks&#x27; search for perfection of ratio and proportion. The Greeks and Romans distinguished three classical orders of architecture, the Doric, Ionic, and Corinthian orders; each had different types of capitals atop the columns of their hypostyle and trabeate monumental buildings. Throughout the Mediterranean Basin, the Near East, and the wider Hellenistic world including the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom, numerous variations on these and other designs of capitals co-existed with the regular classical orders. The only architectural treatise of classical antiquity to survive is by the 1st-century BC Roman architect Vitruvius, who discussed the different proportions of each of these orders and made recommendations for how the column capitals of each order were to be constructed and in what proportions. In the Roman world and within the Roman Empire, the Tuscan order was employed, originally from Italy and with a capital similar to Greek Doric capitals, while the Roman imperial period saw the emergence of the Composite order, with a hybrid capital developed from Ionic and Corinthian elements. The Tuscan and Corinthian columns were counted among the classical canon of orders by the architects of Renaissance architecture and Neoclassical architecture.

===Greek===

==== Doric ====
The Doric capital is the simplest of the five Classical orders: it consists of the abacus above an ovolo molding, with an astragal collar set below. It was developed in the lands occupied by the Dorians, one of the two principal divisions of the Greek race. It became the preferred style of the Greek mainland and the western colonies (southern Italy and Sicily). In the Temple of Apollo, Syracuse (c. 700 BC), the echinus moulding has become a more definite form: this in the Parthenon reaches its culmination, where the convexity is at the top and bottom with a delicate uniting curve. The sloping side of the echinus becomes flatter in the later examples, and in the Colosseum at Rome forms a quarter round (see Doric order). In versions where the frieze and other elements are simpler the same form of capital is described as being in the Tuscan order. Doric reached its peak in the mid-5th century BC, and was one of the orders accepted by the Romans. Its characteristics are masculinity, strength and solidity.

The Doric capital consists of a cushion-like convex moulding known as an echinus, and a square slab termed an abacus.

==== Ionic ====
In the Ionic capital, spirally coiled volutes are inserted between the abacus and the ovolo. This order appears to have been developed contemporaneously with the Doric, though it did not come into common usage and take its final shape until the mid-5th century BC. The style prevailed in Ionian lands, centred on the coast of Asia Minor and Aegean islands. The order&#x27;s form was far less set than the Doric, with local variations persisting for many decades. In the Ionic capitals of the archaic Temple of Artemis at Ephesus (560 BC) the width of the abacus is twice that of its depth, consequently the earliest Ionic capital known was virtually a bracket capital. A century later, in the temple on the Ilissus, the abacus has become square (See the more complete discussion at Ionic order). According to the Roman architect Vitruvius, the Ionic order&#x27;s main characteristics were beauty, femininity, and slenderness, derived from its basis on the proportion of a woman.

The volutes of an Ionic capital rest on an echinus, almost invariably carved with egg-and-dart. Above the scrolls was an abacus, more shallow than that in Doric examples, and again ornamented with egg-and-dart.

====Corinthian====
It has been suggested that the foliage of the Greek Corinthian capital was based on the &quot;Acanthus spinosus&quot;, that of the Roman on the &quot;Acanthus mollis&quot;. Not all architectural foliage is as realistic as Isaac Ware&#x27;s (&quot;illustration, right&quot;) however. The leaves are generally carved in two &quot;ranks&quot; or bands, like one leafy cup set within another. The Corinthian capitals from the Tholos of Epidaurus (400 BC) illustrate the transition between the earlier Greek capital, as at Bassae, and the Roman version that Renaissance and modern architects inherited and refined (See the more complete discussion at Corinthian order).

In Roman architectural practice, capitals are briefly treated in their proper context among the detailing proper to each of the &quot;Orders&quot;, in the only complete architectural textbook to have survived from classical times, the , by Marcus Vitruvius Pollio, better known as Vitruvius, dedicated to the emperor Augustus. The various orders are discussed in Vitruvius&#x27; books iii and iv. Vitruvius describes Roman practice in a practical fashion. He gives some tales about the invention of each of the orders, but he does not give a hard and fast set of canonical rules for the execution of capitals.

Two further, specifically Roman orders of architecture have their characteristic capitals, the sturdy and primitive Tuscan capitals, typically used in military buildings, similar to Greek Doric, but with fewer small moldings in its profile, and the invented Composite capitals not even mentioned by Vitruvius, which combined Ionic volutes and Corinthian acanthus capitals, in an order that was otherwise quite similar in proportions to the Corinthian, itself an order that Romans employed much more often than Greeks.

The increasing adoption of Composite capitals signalled a trend towards freer, more inventive (and often more coarsely carved) capitals in Late Antiquity.

====Anta====

The anta capital is not a capital which is set on top of column, but rather on top of an anta, a structural post integrated into the frontal end of a wall, such as the front of the side wall of a temple.

The top of an anta is often highly decorated, usually with bands of floral motifs. The designs often respond to an order of columns, but usually with a different set of design principles. In order not to protrude excessively from the wall surface, these structures tend to have a rather flat surface, forming brick-shaped capitals, called &quot;anta capitals&quot;. Anta capitals are known from the time of the Doric order.

An anta capital can sometimes be qualified as a &quot;sofa&quot; capital or a &quot;sofa anta capital&quot; when the sides of the capital broaden upward, in a shape reminiscent of a couch or sofa.

Anta capitals are sometimes hard to distinguish from pilaster capitals, which are rather decorative, and do not have the same structural role as anta capitals.

===Roman===
====Tuscan====

The origins of the Tuscan order lie with the Etruscans and are found on their tombs. Although the Romans perceived it as especially Italianate, the Tuscan capital found on Roman monuments is in fact closer to the Greek Doric order than to Etruscan examples, its capital being nearby identical with the Doric.

====Composite====

The Romans invented the Composite order by uniting the Corinthian order with the Ionic capital, possibly as early as Augustus&#x27;s reign. In many versions the Composite order volutes are larger, however, and there is generally some ornament placed centrally between the volutes. Despite this origin, very many Composite capitals in fact treat the two volutes as different elements, each springing from one side of their leafy base. In this, and in having a separate ornament between them, they resemble the Archaic Greek Aeolic order, though this seems not to have been the route of their development in early Imperial Rome. Equally, where the Greek Ionic volute is usually shown from the side as a single unit of unchanged width between the front and back of the column, the Composite volutes are normally treated as four different thinner units, one at each corner of the capital, projecting at some 45° to the façade.

===Indian===
====The &quot;Lion Capital of Ashoka&quot;====
The Lion Capital of Ashoka is an iconic capital which consists of four Asiatic lions standing back to back, on an elaborate base that includes other animals. A graphic representation of it was adopted as the official Emblem of India in 1950. This powerfully carved lion capital from Sarnath stood a top a pillar bearing the edicts of the emperor Ashoka. Like most of Ashoka&#x27;s capitals, it is brilliantly polished. Located at the site of Buddha&#x27;s first sermon and the formation of the Buddhist order, it carried imperial and Buddhist symbols, reflecting the universal authority of both the emperor&#x27;s and the Buddha&#x27;s words. The capital today serves as the emblem of the Republic of India. Minus the inverted bell-shaped lotus flower, this has been adopted as the National Emblem of India, seen from another angle, showing the horse on the left and the bull on the right of the Ashoka Chakra in the circular base on which the four Indian lions are standing back to back. On the side shown here there are the bull and elephant; a lion occupies the other place. The wheel &quot;Ashoka Chakra&quot; from its base has been placed onto the centre of the National Flag of India

====Indo-Ionic capitals====
The Pataliputra capital is a monumental rectangular capital with volutes designs, that was discovered in the palace ruins of the ancient Mauryan Empire capital city of Pataliputra (modern Patna, northeastern India). It is dated to the 3rd century BC. The top is made of a band of rosettes, eleven in total for the fronts and four for the sides. Below that is a band of bead and reel pattern, then under it a band of waves, generally right-to-left, except for the back where they are left-to-right. Further below is a band of egg-and-dart pattern, with eleven &quot;tongues&quot; or &quot;eggs&quot; on the front, and only seven on the back. Below appears the main motif, a flame palmette, growing among pebbles.

The Sarnath capital is a pillar capital, sometimes also described as a &quot;stone bracket&quot;, discovered in the archaeological excavations at the ancient Buddhist site of Sarnath. The pillar displays Ionic volutes and palmettes. It has been variously dated from the 3rd century BCE during the Mauryan Empire period, to the 1st century BCE, during the Sunga Empire period.

====Indo-Corinthian capitals====
Some capitals with strong Greek and Persian influence have been found in northeastern India in the Maurya Empire palace of Pataliputra, dating to the 4th–3rd century BC. Examples such as the Pataliputra capital belong to the Ionic order rather than the later Corinthian order. They are witness to relations between India and the West from that early time.

Indo-Corinthian capitals correspond to the much more abundant Corinthian-style capitals crowning columns or pilasters, which can be found in the northwestern Indian subcontinent, particularly in Gandhara, and usually combine Hellenistic and Indian elements. These capitals are typically dated to the first century BC, and constitute important elements of Greco-Buddhist art.

The Classical design was often adapted, usually taking a more elongated form, and sometimes being combined with scrolls, generally within the context of Buddhist stupas and temples. Indo-Corinthian capitals also incorporated figures of the Buddha or Bodhisattvas, usually as central figures surrounded by, and often under the shade of, the luxurious foliage of Corinthian designs.

==Late Antiquity==
===Byzantine===

Byzantine capitals vary widely, mostly developing from the classical Corinthian, but tending to have an even surface level, with the ornamentation undercut with drills. The block of stone was left rough as it came from the quarry, and the sculptor evolved new designs to his own fancy, so that one rarely meets with many repetitions of the same design. One of the most remarkable designs features leaves carved as if blown by the wind; the finest example being at the 8th-century Hagia Sophia (Thessaloniki). Those in the Cathedral of Saint Mark, Venice (1071) specially attracted John Ruskin&#x27;s fancy. Others appear in Sant&#x27;Apollinare in Classe, Ravenna (549).

The capital in San Vitale, Ravenna (547) shows above it the dosseret required to carry the arch, the springing of which was much wider than the abacus of the capital. On eastern capitals the eagle, the lion and the lamb are occasionally carved, but treated conventionally.

There are two types of capitals used at Hagia Sophia: Composite and Ionic. The composite capital that emerged during the Late Byzantine Empire, mainly in Rome, combines the Corinthian with the Ionic. Composite capitals line the principal space of the nave. Ionic capitals are used behind them in the side spaces, in a mirror position relative to the Corinthian or composite orders (as was their fate well into the 19th century, when buildings were designed for the first time with a monumental Ionic order). At Hagia Sophia, though, these are not the standard imperial statements. The capitals are filled with foliage in all sorts of variations. In some, the small, lush leaves appear to be caught up in the spinning of the scrolls – clearly, a different, nonclassical sensibility has taken over the design.

The capitals at Basilica of San Vitale in Ravenna (Italy) show wavy and delicate floral patterns similar to decorations found on belt buckles and dagger blades. Their inverted pyramidal form has the look of a basket.

Capitals in early Islamic architecture are derived from Graeco-Roman and Byzantine forms, reflecting the training of most of the masons producing them. 

==Middle Ages==

In both periods small columns are often used close together in groups, often around a pier that is in effect a single larger column, or running along a wall surface. The structural importance of the individual column is thereby greatly reduced. In both periods, though there are common types, the sense of a strict order with rules was not maintained, and when the budget allowed, carvers were able to indulge their inventiveness. Capitals were sometimes used to hold depictions of figures and narrative scenes, especially in the Romanesque.

In Romanesque architecture and Gothic architecture capitals throughout western Europe present as much variety as in the East, and for the same reason, that the sculptor evolved his design in accordance with the block he was carving, but in the west variety goes further, because of the clustering of columns and piers.

The earliest type of capital in Lombardy and Germany is known as the cushion-cap, in which the lower portion of the cube block has been cut away to meet the circular shaft. These types were generally painted at first with geometrical designs, afterwards carved.

The finest carving comes from France, especially from the area around Paris. The most varied were carved in 1130–1170.

In Britain and France the figures introduced into the capitals are sometimes full of character, these are referred to as historiated (or figured capital). These capitals, however, are not equal to those of the Early English Gothic, in which foliage is treated as if copied from metalwork, and is of infinite variety, being found in small village churches as well as in cathedrals.

===Armenian===
Armenian capitals are often versions of Byzantine forms. In the 4th-7th centuries the capitals of Armenian architectural facades and masonry facades are tall rectangular stones with a total volume, which are converted into a slab by means of a bell. In the structures of the early period (Ereruyk, Tekor, Tsopk, etc.) they were sculpted with plant and animal images, palm trees. In the 10th century and in the following centuries, capitals are mainly formed by a combination of a cylinder and a slab. The structures of Armenian palaces, churches, courtyards (Dvin, Aruch, Zvartnots, Ishkhan, Banak, Haghpat, Sanahin, Ani structures) are diverse and unique.

==Renaissance and post-Renaissance==

In the Renaissance period the feature became of the greatest importance and its variety almost as great as in the Romanesque and Gothic styles. The flat pilaster, which was employed extensively in this period, called for a planar rendition of the capital, executed in high relief. This affected the designs of capitals. A traditional 15th-century variant of the Composite capital turns the volutes inwards above stiffened leaf carving. In new Renaissance combinations in capital designs most of the ornament can be traced to Classical Roman sources.

The &#x27;Renaissance&#x27; was as much a reinterpretation as a revival of Classical norms. For example, the volutes of ancient Greek and Roman Ionic capitals had lain in the same plane as the architrave above them. This had created an awkward transition at the corner – where, for example, the designer of the temple of Athena Nike on the Acropolis in Athens had brought the outside volute of the end capitals forward at a 45-degree angle. This problem was more satisfactorily solved by the 16th-century architect Sebastiano Serlio, who angled outwards all volutes of his Ionic capitals. Since then use of antique Ionic capitals, instead of Serlio&#x27;s version, has lent an archaic air to the entire context, as in Greek Revival.

There are numerous newly invented orders, sometimes called nonce orders, where a different ornamentation of the capital is typically a key feature. Within the bounds of decorum, a certain amount of inventive play has always been acceptable within the classical tradition. These became increasingly common after the Renaissance. When Benjamin Latrobe redesigned the Senate Vestibule in the United States Capitol in 1807, he introduced six columns that he &quot;Americanized&quot; with ears of corn (maize) substituting for the European acanthus leaves. As Latrobe reported to Thomas Jefferson in August 1809,
:These capitals during the summer session obtained me more applause from members of Congress than all the works of magnitude or difficulty that surround them. They christened them the &#x27;corncob capitals&#x27;.

Another example is the Delhi Order invented by the British architect Edwin Lutyens for New Delhi&#x27;s central palace, Viceroy&#x27;s House, now the Presidential residence Rashtrapati Bhavan, using elements of Indian architecture. Here the capital had a band of vertical ridges, with bells hanging at each corner as a replacement for volutes. The Delhi Order reappears in some later Lutyens buildings including Campion Hall, Oxford.

<text>Allhallowtide, Hallowtide, Allsaintstide, or the Hallowmas season is the Western Christian season encompassing the triduum of All Saints&#x27; Eve (Halloween), All Saints&#x27; Day (All Hallows&#x27;) and All Souls&#x27; Day, as well as the International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church (observed on the first Sunday of November) and Remembrance Sunday (observed on the second Sunday in November) in some traditions. The period begins on 31 October annually. Allhallowtide is a &quot;time to remember the dead, including martyrs, saints, and all faithful departed Christians.&quot; The present date of Hallowmas (All Saints&#x27; Day) and thus also of its vigil (Hallowe&#x27;en) was established for Rome perhaps by Pope Gregory III (731–741) and was made of obligation throughout the Frankish Empire by Louis the Pious in 835. Elsewhere, other dates were observed even later, with the date in Ireland being 20 April. In the early 11th century, the modern date of All Souls&#x27; Day was popularized, after Abbot Odilo established it as a day for the monks of Cluny and associated monasteries to pray for the dead.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Allhallowtide&quot; was first used in 1471, and is derived from three words: the Old English word , meaning &#x27;holy&#x27;, the word &quot;tide&quot;, meaning &#x27;time&#x27; or &#x27;season&#x27; (cf. Christmastide, Eastertide), and &quot;all&quot; (from Old English ) meaning &quot;every&quot;. The latter part of the word &quot;Hallowmas&quot; is derived from the word &quot;Mass&quot;. The words &quot;hallow&quot; and &quot;saint&quot; are synonyms.

== History ==

The Christian attitude toward the death of martyrs is first exemplified in the New Testament, which records that after the beheading of St. John the Baptist, his disciples respectfully buried him. Stephen was likewise &quot;given a Christian burial by his fellow-Christians after he had been stoned to death by a mob.&quot; Two of the Post-Nicene Fathers, Ephrem the Syrian, as well as John Chrysostom, both wrote about the importance of honoring the dead; the theologian Herman Heuser writes that in the early Church, the feast days of the martyrs were local observances, with churches being built on those sites where their blood was shed. Frances Stewart Mossier explains that this changed during the persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire, saying that:

Following the establishment of All Hallows&#x27; Day and its vigil, All Hallows&#x27; Eve in the 8th century, Odilo of Cluny popularized the day to pray for All Souls, forming the third day of the triduum of Allhallowtide. It has been thought that the first three days of Allhallowtide may have originated as a ritualistic remembrance of the deluge in which the first night, All Hallows&#x27; Eve remembers the wickedness of the world before flood. The second night then celebrates the saved who survived the deluge and the third night celebrates those who would repopulate the Earth.

The octave of Allhallowtide, lasting &quot;eight days was established by Pope Sixtus IV in 1430 for the whole Western Church.&quot; The octave, however was eliminated in the 1955 reforms of the Catholic Church, although it continues to be observed by many Lutherans and Anglicans. The faithful may still obtain a Plenary Indulgence by visiting a cemetery and praying for the dead during the octave of All Hallows. Within Allhallowtide, which has a theme revolving around martyrs and saints, many Christian denominations also observe the International Day of Prayer for the Persecuted Church on the first Sunday of November, to remember those who continue to be persecuted for their Christian faith. In the United Kingdom, the Church of England, mother church of the Anglican Communion, extended All Saints-tide to include Remembrance Sunday in the 20th century.

== Triduum ==

=== All Hallows&#x27; Eve ===
All Hallows&#x27; Eve, often contracted as Halloween, is the eve of All Hallows (All Saints&#x27; Day), and the first day of the Allhallowtide. According to some scholars, the Christian Church absorbed some Celtic practices associated with Samhain and Christianised the celebration in order to ease the Celts&#x27; conversion to Christianity; other scholars maintain that the Christian observance of All Hallows&#x27; Eve arose completely independent of Samhain. On All Hallows&#x27; Eve, some believed that the veil between the material world and the afterlife thinned. In order to prevent recognition by a soul, &quot;people would don masks or costumes to disguise their identities&quot;; in North America, this tradition is perpetuated through the practice of trick or treating. In medieval Poland, believers were taught to pray out loud as they walk through the forests in order that the souls of the dead might find comfort; in Spain, Christian priests tolled their church bells in order to allow their congregants to remember the dead on All Hallows&#x27; Eve. The Christian Church traditionally observed Hallowe&#x27;en through a vigil &quot;when worshippers would prepare themselves with prayers and fasting prior to the feast day itself.&quot; This church service is known as the &quot;Vigil of All Hallows&quot; or the &quot;Vigil of All Saints&quot;; an initiative known as &quot;Night of Light&quot; seeks to further spread the observance of &quot;Vigil of All Hallows&quot; throughout Christendom. After the service, &quot;suitable festivities and entertainments&quot; often follow, as well as a visit to the graveyard or cemetery, where flowers and candles are often placed in preparation for All Saints&#x27; Day (All Hallows).

=== All Saints&#x27; Day ===

The second day of Allhallowtide is known as All Saints&#x27; Day, All Hallows&#x27; Day, or Hallowmas. Occurring on 1 November, it is a &quot;principal feast of the church year, and one of the four days recommended for the administration of baptism&quot; in Anglicanism. In some Christian denominations, All Saints&#x27; Day may be &quot;celebrated on the Sunday following November 1.&quot; All Saints&#x27; Day is a holy day to honour all the saints and martyrs, both known and unknown. All Hallows Day is &quot;a universal Christian holy day,&quot; but it has a special importance in the Roman Catholic Church, Evangelical Lutheran churches, Anglican Church, and some other Protestant churches. The liturgical colour of All Saints&#x27; Day is white, which is &quot;symbolic of victory and life.&quot; While honouring the Church Triumphant, All Hallows Day seeks to especially &quot;honour the blessed who have not been canonized and who have no special feast day.&quot; On All Saints&#x27; Day, many Christians visit graveyards and cemeteries in order to place flowers and candles on the graves of their loved ones. This is a common practice in countries such as Italy, Spain, Poland, the Philippines, as well as certain parts of the United States heavily influenced by Roman Catholicism such as Louisiana and Maryland. For Roman Catholic Christians, attending Mass (Eucharist, Holy Communion, &quot;Lord&#x27;s Supper&quot;) is compulsory, as All Saints&#x27; Day (All Hallows) is a holy day of obligation; for members of other Christian denominations, such as the Evangelical Lutheran Church, Anglican Church / Episcopal Church, Methodist Church and some other Protestant Christians, though not mandatory, attendance at worship services is encouraged.

=== All Souls&#x27; Day ===

The final day of Allhallowtide is known as All Souls&#x27; Day, and is also called the Commemoration of All Faithful Departed. All Souls&#x27; Day focuses on honouring &quot;all&quot; faithful Christians &quot;who are unknown in the wider fellowship of the church, especially family members and friends.&quot; However, today, All Saints&#x27; Day and All Souls&#x27; Day have become conflated, and many Christians remember all the dead souls or &quot;saints&quot; on All Saints&#x27; Day.&#x27; The observance of All Souls&#x27; Day &quot;was spread throughout Europe&quot; by Saint Odilo of Cluny in the early 11th century. Like All Hallows&#x27; Eve and All Saints&#x27; Day, family members often attend mass and visit the graves of their deceased loved ones, placing flowers and lighted candles there. In many Anglican / Episcopal, Evangelical Lutheran and Roman Catholic Christian services, an A.D. 7th-century prayer &quot;The Office of the Dead&quot; is read out in churches on All Souls&#x27; Day.&quot; In England, a popular tradition associated with All Souls&#x27; Day is souling, in which &quot;bands of children, or of poor men, went round to the houses of the well-to-do on Souling Day, as they called it, begging money, apples, ale, or doles of cake. In some parts specially baked cakes were prepared in readiness to give away; they were called soul-cakes.&quot; The individuals who go souling often chant rhymes as they go door to door; for example, an old saying goes: &quot;A Soule-cake, a soule-cake, have mercy on all Christian souls for a soule-cake.&quot; Historically, in France, on All Souls&#x27; Day, &quot;the burial fraternities were especially active in decorating the churchyard, and everywhere priests led a procession around the graveyard and blessed the graves.&quot;

<doc id="355033" wikidata="Q7321053" url="?curid=355033" title="Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence">
<text>Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI) was a statement adopted by the Cabinet of Rhodesia on 11 November 1965, announcing that Rhodesia (previously Southern Rhodesia), a British territory in southern Africa that had governed itself since 1923, now regarded itself as an independent sovereign state. The culmination of a protracted dispute between the British and Rhodesian governments regarding the terms under which the latter could become fully independent, it was the first unilateral break from the United Kingdom by one of its colonies since the United States Declaration of Independence in 1776. The UK, the Commonwealth, and the United Nations all deemed Rhodesia&#x27;s UDI illegal, and economic sanctions, the first in the UN&#x27;s history, were imposed on the breakaway colony. With the help of the Commonwealth Secretariat, members of the Commonwealth were able to cooperate and advise Rhodesian Africans on policy. Amid near-complete international isolation, Rhodesia continued as an unrecognised state with the assistance of South Africa and (until 1974) Portugal.

The Rhodesian government, which mostly comprised members of the country&#x27;s white minority of about 5%, was indignant when, amid the UK colonial government&#x27;s &quot;Wind of Change&quot; policies of decolonisation, African colonies to the north without comparable experience of self-rule quickly advanced to independence during the early 1960s while Rhodesia was refused sovereignty under the newly ascendant principle of &quot;no independence before majority rule&quot; (&quot;NIBMAR&quot;). Most white Rhodesians felt that they were due independence following four decades of self-government, and that the British government was betraying them by withholding it.

A stalemate developed between the British and Rhodesian prime ministers, Harold Wilson and Ian Smith respectively, between 1964 and 1965. The dispute largely surrounded the British condition that the terms for independence had to be acceptable &quot;to the people of the country as a whole&quot;; Smith contended that this was met, while the UK and African Nationalist Rhodesian leaders held that it was not. After Wilson proposed in late October 1965 that the UK might safeguard future black representation in the Rhodesian parliament by withdrawing some of the colonial government&#x27;s devolved powers, then presented terms for an investigatory Royal Commission that the Rhodesians found unacceptable, Smith and his Cabinet declared independence. Calling this treasonous, the British colonial governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, formally dismissed Smith and his government, but they ignored him and appointed an &quot;Officer Administering the Government&quot; to take his place.

While no country recognised the UDI, the Rhodesian High Court deemed the post-UDI government legal and &quot;de jure&quot; in 1968. The Smith administration initially professed continued loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II, but abandoned this in 1970 when it declared a republic in an unsuccessful attempt to win foreign recognition. The Rhodesian Bush War, a guerrilla conflict between the government and two rival communist-backed black Rhodesian groups, began in earnest two years later, and after several attempts to end the war Smith concluded the Internal Settlement with non-militant nationalists in 1978. Under these terms the country was reconstituted under black rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979, but this new order was rejected by the guerrillas and the international community. The Bush War continued until Zimbabwe Rhodesia revoked its UDI as part of the Lancaster House Agreement in December 1979. Following a brief period of direct British rule, the country was granted internationally recognised independence under the name Zimbabwe in 1980.

==Background==

The southern African territory of Rhodesia, officially Southern Rhodesia, was a unique case in the British Empire and Commonwealth: although a colony in name, it was internally self-governing and constitutionally not unlike a dominion. This situation dated back to 1923, when it was granted responsible government within the Empire as a self-governing colony, following three decades of administration and development by the British South Africa Company. Britain had intended Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s integration into the Union of South Africa as a new province, but this having been rejected by registered voters in the 1922 government referendum, the territory was moulded into a prospective dominion instead. It was empowered to run its own affairs in almost all respects, including defence.

Whitehall&#x27;s powers over Southern Rhodesia under the 1923 constitution were, on paper, considerable; the British Crown was theoretically able to cancel any passed bill within a year, or alter the constitution however it wished. These reserved powers were intended to protect the indigenous black Africans from discriminatory legislation and to safeguard British commercial interests in the colony, but as Claire Palley comments in her constitutional history of the country, it would have been extremely difficult for Whitehall to enforce such actions, and attempting to do so would have probably caused a crisis. In the event, they were never exercised. A generally co-operative relationship developed between Whitehall and the colonial government and civil service in Salisbury, and dispute was rare.

The 1923 constitution was drawn up in non-racial terms, and the electoral system it devised was similarly open, at least in theory. Voting qualifications regarding personal income, education and property, similar to those of the Cape Qualified Franchise, were applied equally to all, but since most blacks did not meet the set standards, both the electoral roll and the colonial parliament were overwhelmingly from the white minority of about 5%. The result was that black interests were sparsely represented if at all, something that most of the colony&#x27;s whites showed little interest in changing; they claimed that most blacks were uninterested in Western-style political process and that they would not govern properly if they took over. Bills such as the Land Apportionment Act of 1930, which earmarked about half of the country for white ownership and residence while dividing the rest into black purchase, tribal trust and national areas, were variously biased towards the white minority. White settlers and their offspring provided most of the colony&#x27;s administrative, industrial, scientific and farming skills, and built a relatively balanced, partially industrialised market economy, boasting strong agricultural and manufacturing sectors, iron and steel industries and modern mining enterprises. Everyday life was marked by discrimination ranging from job reservation for whites to petty segregation of trains, post office queues and the like. Whites owned most of the best farmland, and had far superior education, wages and homes, but the schooling, healthcare, infrastructure and salaries available to black Rhodesians were nevertheless very good by African standards.

In the wider Imperial context, Southern Rhodesia occupied a category unto itself because of the &quot;special quasi-independent status&quot; it held. The Dominions Office, formed in 1925 to handle British relations with the dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa and the Irish Free State (the Statute of Westminster 1931 delineated the rights of the dominions more clearly in that year), also dealt with Southern Rhodesia, and Imperial Conferences included the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister alongside those of the dominions from 1932. This unique arrangement continued following the advent of Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conferences in 1944. Southern Rhodesians of all races fought for Britain in the Second World War, and the colonial government gradually received more autonomy regarding external affairs. During the immediate post-war years, Southern Rhodesian politicians generally thought that they were as good as independent as they were, and that full autonomy in the form of dominionship would make little difference to them. Post-war immigration to Southern Rhodesia, mainly from Britain, Ireland and South Africa, caused the white community to swell from 68,954 in 1941 to 221,504 in 1961. The black population grew from 1,400,000 to 3,550,000 over the same period. Rhodesian authorities actively promoted immigration and reproduction of whites to boost their numbers while encouraging family planning for blacks to curtail their numbers. They hoped that by altering the demographic content of the territory enough they could have a stronger position from which to petition the British government for more autonomy.

===Federation and the Wind of Change===

Believing full dominion status to be effectively symbolic and &quot;there for the asking&quot;, Prime Minister Godfrey Huggins (in office from 1933 to 1953) twice ignored British overtures hinting at dominionship, and instead pursued an initially semi-independent Federation with Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, two colonies directly administered from London. He hoped that this might set in motion the creation of one united dominion in south-central Africa, emulating the Federation of Australia half a century before. The Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, defined in its constitution as indissoluble, began in 1953, mandated by the results of a mostly white referendum, with Southern Rhodesia, the most developed of the three territories, at its head, Huggins as Federal Prime Minister and Salisbury as Federal capital.

Coming at the start of the decolonisation period, the Federation of self-governing Southern Rhodesia with two directly ruled British protectorates was later described by the British historian Robert Blake as &quot;an aberration of history—a curious deviation from the inevitable course of events&quot;. The project faced black opposition from the start, and ultimately failed because of the shifting international attitudes and rising black Rhodesian ambitions of the late 1950s and early 1960s, often collectively called the Wind of Change. Britain, France and Belgium vastly accelerated their withdrawal from Africa during this period, believing colonial rule to be no longer sustainable geopolitically or ethically. The idea of &quot;no independence before majority rule&quot;, commonly abbreviated to &quot;NIBMAR&quot;, gained considerable ground in British political circles. When Huggins (who had been recently ennobled as Lord Malvern) asked Britain to make the Federation a dominion in 1956, he was rebuffed. The opposition Dominion Party responded by repeatedly calling for a Federal unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) over the next few years. Following Lord Malvern&#x27;s retirement in late 1956, his successor Sir Roy Welensky pondered such a move on at least three occasions.

Attempting to advance the case for Southern Rhodesian independence, particularly in the event of Federal dissolution, the Southern Rhodesian Prime Minister Sir Edgar Whitehead brokered the 1961 constitution with Britain, which he thought would remove all British powers of reservation over Southern Rhodesian bills and acts, and put the country on the brink of full sovereignty. Despite its containing no independence guarantees, Whitehead, Welensky and other proponents of this constitution presented it to the Southern Rhodesian electorate as the &quot;independence constitution&quot; under which Southern Rhodesia would become a dominion on a par with Australia, Canada and New Zealand if the Federation dissolved. White dissenters included Ian Smith, MP for Gwanda and Chief Whip for the governing United Federal Party (UFP) in the Federal Assembly, who took exception to the constitution&#x27;s omission of an explicit promise of Southern Rhodesian independence in the event of Federal dissolution, and ultimately resigned his post in protest. A referendum of the mostly white electorate approved the new constitution by a majority of 65% on 26 July 1961. The final version of the constitution included a few extra provisions inserted by the British, one of which—Section 111—reserved full powers to the Crown to amend, add to or revoke certain sections of the Southern Rhodesian constitution by Order in Council at the request of the British government. This effectively negated the relinquishment of British powers described elsewhere in the document, but the Southern Rhodesians did not initially notice it.

The black Rhodesian movement in Southern Rhodesia, founded and organised by urban black elites during the late 1950s, was repeatedly banned by the colonial government because of the political violence, industrial sabotage and intimidation of potential black voters that characterised its campaign. The principal nationalist group, led by the Bulawayo trade unionist Joshua Nkomo, renamed itself with each post-ban reorganisation, and by the start of 1962 was called the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU). Attempting to win black political support, Whitehead proposed a number of reforms to racially discriminatory legislation, including the Land Apportionment Act, and promised to implement these if his UFP won the next Southern Rhodesian election. But intimidation by ZAPU of prospective black voters impeded the UFP&#x27;s efforts to win their support, and much of the white community saw Whitehead as too radical, and soft on what they saw as black extremism. In the December 1962 Southern Rhodesian election, the UFP was defeated by the Rhodesian Front (RF), a newly formed alliance of conservative voices headed by Winston Field and Ian Smith, in what was widely considered a shock result. Field became Prime Minister, with Smith as his deputy.

===Federal dissolution; the roots of mistrust===
Meanwhile, secessionist black Rhodesian parties won electoral victories in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, and Harold Macmillan&#x27;s Conservative administration in Britain moved towards breaking up the Federation, resolving that it had become untenable. In February 1962, the British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, Duncan Sandys, secretly informed the Nyasaland nationalist leader Hastings Banda that secession would be allowed. A few days later, he horrified Welensky by telling him that &quot;we British have lost the will to govern&quot;. &quot;But we haven&#x27;t&quot;, retorted Julian Greenfield, Welensky&#x27;s Law Minister. Macmillan&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister and First Secretary of State, R A Butler, who headed British oversight of the Federation, officially announced Nyasaland&#x27;s right to secede in December 1962. Four months later, he informed the three territories that he was going to convene a conference to decide the Federation&#x27;s future.

As Southern Rhodesia had been the UK&#x27;s legislative partner in forming the Federation in 1953, it would be impossible (or at least very difficult) for Britain to dissolve the union without Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s co-operation. Field could therefore potentially hamstring the British by refusing to attend the conference until they pledged to grant his country full independence. According to Field, Smith and other RF politicians, Butler made several such guarantees orally to ensure their co-operation at the conference, but repeatedly refused to give anything on paper. The Southern Rhodesians claimed that Butler justified his refusal to give a written promise by saying that binding Whitehall to a document rather than his word would be against the Commonwealth&#x27;s &quot;spirit of trust&quot;—an argument that Field eventually accepted. &quot;Let&#x27;s remember the trust you emphasised&quot;, Smith warned, according to Field&#x27;s account wagging his finger at Butler; &quot;if you break that you will live to regret it.&quot; Southern Rhodesia attended the conference, which was held at Victoria Falls over a week starting from 28 June 1963, and among other things it was agreed to formally liquidate the Federation at the end of the year. In the House of Commons afterwards, Butler flatly denied suggestions that he had &quot;oiled the wheels&quot; of Federal dissolution with secret promises to the Southern Rhodesians.

Field&#x27;s government was startled by Britain&#x27;s announcement in October 1963 that Nyasaland would become fully independent on 6 July 1964. While no date was set for Northern Rhodesian statehood, it was generally surmised that it was going to follow shortly thereafter. Smith was promptly sent to London, where he held a round of inconclusive Southern Rhodesian independence talks with the new British Prime Minister, Sir Alec Douglas-Home. Around the same time, the presence and significance of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution emerged in Southern Rhodesia, prompting speculation in political circles that a future British government might, if it were so inclined, go against previous conventions by legislating for Salisbury without its consent, withdrawing devolved powers or otherwise altering the Southern Rhodesian constitution. Fearing what the Labour Party might do if it won the next British general election (which was projected for late 1964), the Southern Rhodesians stepped up their efforts, hoping to win independence before Britain went to the polls, and preferably not after Nyasaland. The Federation dissolved as scheduled at the end of 1963.

==Positions and motivations==

===British government stance===
The British government&#x27;s refusal to grant independence to Southern Rhodesia under the 1961 constitution was largely the result of the geopolitical and moral shifts associated with the Wind of Change, coupled with the UK&#x27;s wish to avoid opprobrium and loss of prestige in the United Nations (UN) and the Commonwealth. The issue gained international attention in Africa and worldwide as a flashpoint for questions of decolonisation and racism. By the early 1960s, general consensus in the post-colonial UN—particularly the General Assembly, where the communist bloc and the Afro-Asian lobby were collectively very strong—roundly denounced all forms of colonialism, and supported communist-backed black nationalist insurgencies across southern Africa, regarding them as racial liberation movements. Amid the Cold War, Britain opposed the spread of Soviet and Chinese influence into Africa, but knew it would become an international pariah if it publicly expressed reservations or backed down on NIBMAR in the Southern Rhodesia question. Once the topic of Southern Rhodesia came to the fore in the UN and other bodies, particularly the Organisation of African Unity (OAU), even maintaining the &quot;status quo&quot; became regarded as unacceptable internationally, causing the UK government a great deal of embarrassment.

In the Commonwealth context, too, Britain knew that simply granting independence to Southern Rhodesia was out of the question as many of the Afro-Asian countries were also Commonwealth members. Statehood for Salisbury without majority rule would split the Commonwealth and perhaps cause it to break up, a disastrous prospect for British foreign policy. The Commonwealth repeatedly called on Britain to intervene directly should Southern Rhodesian defiance continue, while liberals in Britain worried that if left unchecked Salisbury might drift towards South African-style apartheid. Anxious to avoid having to choose between Southern Rhodesia and the Commonwealth, Whitehall attempted to negotiate a middle way between the two, but ultimately put international considerations first, regarding them as more important.

At party level, the Labour Party, in opposition until October 1964, was overtly against Southern Rhodesian independence under the 1961 constitution and supportive of the black Rhodesian movement on ideological and moral grounds. The Liberal Party, holding a handful of parliament seats, took a similar stance. The Conservative Party, while also following a policy of decolonisation, was more sympathetic to the Southern Rhodesian government&#x27;s position, and included members who openly supported it.

===Southern Rhodesian government view===
The Southern Rhodesian government found it bizarre that Britain was making independent states out of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, which the Rhodesians considered to be less developed territories with little experience of self-rule, while withholding sovereign statehood from Southern Rhodesia, the Federation&#x27;s senior partner, which had already been self-governing for four decades and which was one of the most prosperous and developed countries in Africa. The principle of majority rule, the basis for this apparent inconsistency, was considered irrelevant by the Southern Rhodesians. They had presumed that in the event of Federal dissolution they would be first in line for independence without major adjustments to the 1961 constitution, an impression confirmed to them by prior intergovernmental correspondence, particularly the oral promises they claimed to have received from Butler. When it did not prove forthcoming they felt cheated. Salisbury contended that its predominantly white legislature was more deserving of independence than the untried black Rhodesian leaders as it had proven its competence over decades of self-rule.

The RF claimed that the bloody civil wars, military coups and other disasters that plagued the new majority-ruled African states to the north, many of which had become corrupt, autocratic or communist one-party states very soon after independence, showed that black Rhodesian leaders were not ready to govern. Influenced strongly by the white refugees who had fled south from the Congo, it presented chaotic doomsday scenarios of what black Rhodesian rule in Southern Rhodesia might mean, particularly for the white community. Proponents of the RF stand downplayed black Rhodesian grievances regarding land ownership and segregation, and argued that despite the racial imbalance in domestic politics—whites made up 5% of the population, but over 90% of registered voters—the electoral system was not racist as the franchise was based on financial and educational qualifications rather than ethnicity. They emphasised the colony&#x27;s proud war record on Britain&#x27;s behalf, and expressed a wish in the Cold War context to form an anti-communist, pro-Western front in Africa alongside South Africa and Portugal.

These factors combined with what RF politicians and supporters saw as British decadence, chicanery and betrayal to create the case they put forward that UDI, while dubious legally and likely to provoke international uproar, might nevertheless be in their eyes justifiable and necessary for the good of the country and region if an accommodation could not be found with Whitehall.

==Road to UDI==

===First steps, under Field===

Field&#x27;s failure to secure independence concurrently with the end of the Federation caused his Cabinet&#x27;s support for him to waver during late 1963 and early 1964. The RF caucus in January 1964 revealed widespread dissatisfaction with him on the grounds that the British seemed to be outwitting him. The Prime Minister was put under immense pressure to win the colony&#x27;s independence. Field travelled to England later that month to press Douglas-Home and Sandys for independence, and raised the possibility of UDI on a few occasions, but returned empty-handed on 2 February.

The RF united behind Field after Sandys wrote him a terse letter warning him of the likely Commonwealth reaction to a declaration of independence, but the Prime Minister then lost his party&#x27;s confidence by failing to pursue a possible route to at least &quot;de facto&quot; independence devised by Desmond Lardner-Burke, a lawyer and RF MP for Gwelo. During March 1964, the Legislative Assembly in Salisbury considered and passed Lardner-Burke&#x27;s motion that the Governor, Sir Humphrey Gibbs, should submit a petition to the Queen requesting alteration of Section 111 of the 1961 constitution so that the Royal Assent described therein would be exercised at the request of the Southern Rhodesian government rather than that of its British counterpart. This would both remove the possibility of British legislative interference and pave the way for an attempted assumption of independence by Order in Council.

The RF&#x27;s intention was partly to test whether or not the British would attempt to block this bill after Gibbs had granted Royal Assent to it, but this issue never came to a head because Sandys persuaded Field not to forward it to Gibbs for ratification on the grounds that it had not been unanimously passed. Lord Salisbury, one of Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s main supporters in Britain, despaired at Field&#x27;s lack of action, telling Welensky that as he saw it &quot;the simple time to have declared independence, whether right or wrong, would have been when the Federation came to an end&quot;. The RF hierarchy interpreted this latest backtrack by Field as evidence that he would not seriously challenge the British on the independence issue, and forced his resignation on 13 April 1964. Smith accepted the Cabinet&#x27;s nomination to take his place.

===Smith replaces Field; talks with Douglas-Home===
Smith, a farmer from the Midlands town of Selukwe who had been seriously wounded while serving in the British Royal Air Force during the Second World War, was Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s first native-born Prime Minister. Regarded in British political circles as a &quot;raw colonial&quot;—when he took over, Smith&#x27;s personal experience of the UK comprised four brief visits—he promised a harder line than Field in independence talks. The RF&#x27;s replacement of Field drew criticism from the British Labour Party, whose leader Harold Wilson called it &quot;brutal&quot;, while Nkomo described the new Smith Cabinet as &quot;a suicide squad ... not interested in the welfare of all the people but only in their own&quot;. Smith said he was pursuing a middle course between black Rhodesian rule and apartheid so that there would still be &quot;a place for the white man&quot; in Southern Rhodesia; this would benefit the blacks too, he claimed. He held that the government should be based &quot;on merit, not on colour or nationalism&quot;, and insisted that there would be &quot;no African nationalist government here in my lifetime&quot;.

Salisbury&#x27;s blunt refusal to be part of the Wind of Change caused the Southern Rhodesian military&#x27;s traditional British and American suppliers to impose an informal embargo, and prompted Whitehall and Washington to stop sending Southern Rhodesia financial aid around the same time. In June 1964, Douglas-Home informed Smith that Southern Rhodesia would not be represented at the year&#x27;s Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference, despite Salisbury&#x27;s record of attendance going back to 1932, because of a change in policy to only include representatives from fully independent states. This decision, taken by Britain to preempt the possibility of open confrontation with Asian and black African leaders at the conference, deeply insulted Smith. Lord Malvern equated Britain&#x27;s removal of Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s conference seat with &quot;kicking us out of the Commonwealth&quot;, while Welensky expressed horror at what he described as &quot;this cavalier treatment of a country which has, since its creation, staunchly supported, in every possible way, Britain and the Commonwealth&quot;.
At 10 Downing Street in early September 1964, impasse developed between Douglas-Home and Smith over the best way to measure black public opinion in Southern Rhodesia. A key plank of Britain&#x27;s Southern Rhodesia policy was that the terms for independence had to be &quot;acceptable to the people of the country as a whole&quot;—agreeing to this, Smith suggested that white and urban black opinion could be gauged through a general referendum of registered voters, and that rural black views could be obtained at a national &quot;indaba&quot; (tribal conference) of chiefs and headmen. Douglas-Home told Smith that although this proposal satisfied him personally, he could not accept it as he did not believe the Commonwealth, the United Nations or the Labour Party would also do so. He stressed that such a move towards accommodation with Smith might hurt the Conservatives&#x27; chances in the British general election the next month, and suggested that it might be in Smith&#x27;s best interests to wait until after the election to continue negotiations. Smith accepted this argument. Douglas-Home assured Smith that a Conservative government would settle with him and grant independence within a year.

Attempting to form a viable white opposition to the Rhodesian Front, the UFP resurrected itself around Welensky, renamed itself the Rhodesia Party, and entered the Arundel and Avondale by-elections that had been called for 1 October 1964. Perturbed by the prospect of having to face the political heavyweight Welensky in parliament at the head of the opposition, the RF poured huge resources into winning both of these former UFP safe seats, and fielded Clifford Dupont, Smith&#x27;s deputy, against Welensky in Arundel. The RF won both seats comfortably, and the Rhodesia Party soon faded away. Spurred on by this success, Smith organised the &quot;indaba&quot; for 22 October, and called a general independence referendum for 5 November 1964. Meanwhile, Wilson wrote a number of letters to black Southern Rhodesians, assuring them that &quot;the Labour Party is totally opposed to granting independence to Southern Rhodesia so long as the government of that country remains under the control of the white minority&quot;.

===Wilson&#x27;s Labour government; Salisbury&#x27;s tests of opinion===
Labour defeated the Conservatives by four seats in the British general election on 15 October 1964, and formed a government the next day. Both Labour and the Conservatives told Smith that a positive result at the &quot;indaba&quot; would not be recognised by Britain as representative of the people, and the Conservatives turned down Salisbury&#x27;s invitation to send observers. Smith pressed on, telling parliament that he would ask the tribal chiefs and headmen &quot;to consult their people in the traditional manner&quot;, then hold the &quot;indaba&quot; as planned. On 22 October 196 chiefs and 426 headmen from across the country gathered at Domboshawa, just north-east of Salisbury, and began their deliberations. Smith hoped that Britain, having taken part in such &quot;indabas&quot; in the past, might send a delegation at the last minute, but none arrived, much to his annoyance, particularly as the British government&#x27;s Commonwealth Secretary Arthur Bottomley was only across the Zambezi in Lusaka at the time.

While the chiefs conferred, Northern Rhodesia became independent Zambia on 24 October 1964, emulating Nyasaland, which had achieved statehood as Malawi three months earlier. Reasoning that it was no longer necessary to refer to itself as &quot;Southern&quot; in the absence of a northern counterpart, Southern Rhodesia began calling itself simply Rhodesia. The same day, the commander of the Rhodesian Army, Major-General John &quot;Jock&quot; Anderson, resigned, announcing publicly that he was doing so because of his opposition to UDI, which he said he could not go along with because of his oath of allegiance to the Queen. Interpreting this as a sign that Smith intended to declare independence if a majority backed it in the referendum, Wilson wrote a stiff letter to Smith on 25 October, warning him of the consequences of UDI, and demanding &quot;a categorical assurance forthwith that no attempt at a unilateral declaration of independence on your part will be made&quot;. Smith expressed confusion as to what he had done to provoke this, and ignored it.

When the &quot;indaba&quot; ended on 26 October, the chiefs and headmen returned a unanimous decision to support the government&#x27;s stand for independence under the 1961 constitution, attesting in their report that &quot;people who live far away do not understand the problems of our country&quot;. This verdict was rejected by the nationalist movement on the grounds that the chiefs received governmental salaries; the chiefs countered that the black MPs in parliamentary opposition also received such salaries, but still opposed the government. Malvern, who was becoming perturbed by the RF&#x27;s actions, dismissed the &quot;indaba&quot; as a &quot;swindle&quot;, asserting that the chiefs no longer had any real power; the British simply ignored the whole exercise. On 27 October, Wilson released a firm statement regarding Britain&#x27;s intended response to UDI, warning that Rhodesia&#x27;s economic and political ties with Britain, the Commonwealth and most of the world would be immediately severed amid a campaign of sanctions if Smith&#x27;s government went ahead with UDI. This was intended to discourage white Rhodesians from voting for independence in the referendum, for which the RF campaign slogan was &quot;Yes means Unity, not UDI&quot;. Wilson was pleased when Douglas-Home, his leading opponent in the House of Commons, praised the statement as &quot;rough but right&quot;. On 5 November 1964, Rhodesia&#x27;s mostly white electorate voted &quot;yes&quot; to independence under the 1961 constitution by a margin of 89%, prompting Smith to declare that the British condition of acceptability to the people as a whole had been met.

===Stalemate develops between Smith and Wilson===

Smith wrote to Wilson the day after the referendum, asking him to send Bottomley to Salisbury for talks. Wilson replied that Smith should instead come to London. The British and Rhodesians exchanged often confrontational letters for the next few months. Alluding to the British financial aid pledged to Salisbury as part of the Federal dissolution arrangements, Wilson&#x27;s High Commissioner in Salisbury, J B Johnston, wrote to the Rhodesian Cabinet Secretary Gerald B Clarke on 23 December that &quot;talk of a unilateral declaration of independence is bound to throw a shadow of uncertainty on the future financial relations between the two governments&quot;. Smith was furious, seeing this as blackmail, and on 13 January 1965 wrote to Wilson: &quot;I am so incensed at the line of your High Commissioner&#x27;s letter that I am replying directly to you ... It would appear that any undertakings given by the British government are worthless ... such immoral behaviour on the part of the British government makes it impossible for me to continue negotiations with you with any confidence that our standards of fair play, honesty and decency will prevail.&quot;
The two premiers were brought together in person in late January 1965, when Smith travelled to London for Sir Winston Churchill&#x27;s funeral. Following an episode concerning Smith&#x27;s non-invitation to a luncheon at Buckingham Palace after the funeral—noticing the Rhodesian&#x27;s absence, the Queen sent a royal equerry to Smith&#x27;s hotel to retrieve him, reportedly causing Wilson much irritation—the two Prime Ministers inconclusively debated at 10 Downing Street. They differed on most matters, but agreed on a visit to Rhodesia the next month by Bottomley and the Lord Chancellor, Lord Gardiner, to gauge public opinion and meet political and commercial figures. Bottomley and Gardiner visited Rhodesia from 22 February to 3 March, collected a wide cross-section of opinions, including some from black Rhodesians, and on returning to Britain reported to the House of Commons that they were &quot;not without hope of finding a way towards a solution that will win the support of all communities and lead to independence and prosperity for all Rhodesians&quot;. Bottomley also condemned black-on-black political violence, and dismissed the idea of introducing majority rule through military force.

The RF called a new general election for May 1965 and, campaigning on an election promise of independence, won all 50 &quot;A&quot;-roll seats (the voters for which were mostly white). Josiah Gondo, leader of the United People&#x27;s Party, became Rhodesia&#x27;s first black Leader of the Opposition. Opening parliament on 9 June, Gibbs told the Legislative Assembly that the RF&#x27;s strengthened majority amounted to &quot;a mandate to lead the country to its full independence&quot;, and announced that the new government had informed him of its intent to open its own diplomatic mission in Lisbon, separate from the British embassy there. The British and Rhodesians argued about this unilateral act by Salisbury, described by the historian J R T Wood as the &quot;veritable straw in the wind&quot;, alongside the independence issue until Portugal accepted the mission in late September, much to Britain&#x27;s fury and Rhodesia&#x27;s delight. Hoping to bring Smith to heel by stonewalling him, Wilson&#x27;s ministers deliberately delayed and frustrated the Rhodesian government in negotiations. Rhodesia was again excluded from the Commonwealth Prime Ministers&#x27; Conference in 1965. The UK&#x27;s refusal of aid, the Lisbon mission, the informal arms embargo and other issues combined with this to cause the Rhodesian government&#x27;s sense of alienation from Britain and the Commonwealth to deepen. In his memoirs, Smith accused the British of &quot;resorting to politics of convenience and appeasement&quot;. Wilson, meanwhile, became exasperated by what he saw as Rhodesian inflexibility, describing the gap between the two governments as &quot;between different worlds and different centuries&quot;.

===Final steps to UDI===
Amid renewed rumours of an impending Rhodesian UDI, Smith travelled to meet Wilson in London at the start of October 1965, telling the press that he intended to resolve the independence issue once and for all. Both the British and the Rhodesians were surprised by the large numbers of Britons who came out to support Smith during his visit. Smith accepted an invitation from the BBC to appear on its &quot;Twenty-Four Hours&quot; evening news and current affairs programme, but Downing Street blocked this at the last minute. Following largely abortive talks with Wilson, the Rhodesian Prime Minister flew home on 12 October. Desperate to avert UDI, Wilson travelled to Salisbury two weeks later to continue negotiations.

During these discussions, Smith referred to the last resort of a UDI on many occasions, though he said he hoped to find another way out of the quandary. He offered to increase black legislative representation by expanding the electorate along the lines of &quot;one taxpayer, one vote&quot;—which would enfranchise about half a million, but still leave most of the nation voteless—in return for a grant of independence. Wilson said this was insufficient, and countered that future black representation might be better safeguarded by Britain&#x27;s withdrawal from the colonial government of the power it had held since 1923 to determine the size and makeup of its parliament. The Rhodesians were horrified by this prospect, particularly as Wilson&#x27;s suggestion of it seemed to them to have removed the failsafe alternative of keeping the &quot;status quo&quot;. Before the British Prime Minister left Rhodesia on 30 October 1965, he proposed a Royal Commission to gauge public opinion in the colony regarding independence under the 1961 constitution, possibly chaired by the Rhodesian Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle, which would report its findings to both the British and Rhodesian Cabinets. Wilson confirmed in the House of Commons two days later that he intended to introduce direct British control over the Rhodesian parliamentary structure to ensure that progress was made towards majority rule.

Stalemate drew closer as the Rhodesian Cabinet resolved that since Wilson had ruled out maintenance of the &quot;status quo&quot;, its only remaining options were to trust in the Royal Commission or declare independence. When the terms for the commission&#x27;s visit were presented to Smith, he found that contrary to what had been discussed during the British Prime Minister&#x27;s visit, the Royal Commission would operate on the basis that the 1961 constitution was unacceptable to the British government, and that Britain would not commit itself to accepting the final report. Smith said these conditions amounted to a &quot;vote of no confidence in [the commission] before they commenced&quot;, and therefore rejected them. &quot;The impression you left with us of a determined effort to resolve our constitutional problem has been utterly dissipated&quot;, he wrote to Wilson on 5 November. &quot;It would seem that you have now finally closed the door which you publicly claimed to have opened.&quot;

Amid frantic efforts by Beadle and others on both sides to revive the Royal Commission, the Rhodesian government had Gibbs announce a state of emergency the same day on the grounds that black Rhodesian insurgents were reportedly entering the country. Smith denied that this foreshadowed a declaration of independence, but the publishing of his letter to Wilson in the press provoked a worldwide storm of speculation that UDI was imminent. Smith wrote again to Wilson on 8 November, asking him to appoint the Royal Commission under the terms they had agreed in Salisbury and to commit the British government to accepting its ruling, but Wilson did not immediately reply. On 9 November, the Rhodesian Cabinet sent a letter to Queen Elizabeth II, assuring her that Rhodesia would remain loyal to her personally &quot;whatever happens&quot;.

==Draft, adoption and signing==

The Rhodesian Minister for Justice and Law and Order, Desmond Lardner-Burke, presented the rest of the Cabinet with a draft for the declaration of independence on 5 November 1965. When Jack Howman, Minister of Tourism and Information, said that he was also preparing a draft, the Cabinet decided to wait to see his version too. The ministers agreed that if an independence proclamation were issued, they would all sign it. On 9 November, the Cabinet jointly devised an outline for the proclamation document and the accompanying statement to be made by Smith. The final version of the declaration of independence was prepared by a sub-committee of civil servants headed by Gerald Clarke, the Cabinet Secretary, with the United States Declaration of Independence of 1776, the only other such proclamation ever issued by British colonials, used as a model. Strongly alluding to Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s text throughout, the Rhodesians used one phrase —&quot;a respect for the opinions of mankind&quot;—but no reference was made to the assertion that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, nor to the &quot;consent of the governed&quot;, two omissions later stressed by a number of commentators.

Attached to the declaration of independence was a copy of the 1961 constitution amended for the circumstances, which became the 1965 constitution. In the eyes of the Smith administration, this document removed Whitehall&#x27;s remaining authority over Rhodesia and made Rhodesia a &quot;de jure&quot; independent state. However, the Smith government still professed loyalty to Elizabeth II, and accordingly the document reconstituted Rhodesia as a Commonwealth realm with Elizabeth as &quot;Queen of Rhodesia&quot;. The new constitution created the concept of allegiance to the &quot;Constitution of Rhodesia,&quot; and introduced the post of Officer Administering the Government, a viceregal figure empowered to sign passed legislation into law on behalf of the monarch if she did not appoint a Governor-General.

The Rhodesian Cabinet waited in vain for Wilson&#x27;s reply for the rest of 9 November and the next day. After briefly meeting Smith late on 10 November, Johnston warned Wilson that evening that the Rhodesians seemed poised to declare independence in the morning. The British Prime Minister tried repeatedly to call Smith, but did not get through until Smith was already chairing a Cabinet meeting on the independence issue around 08:00 Central Africa Time (06:00 in London) on 11 November. Wilson attempted to talk Smith out of unilateral action by telling him the &quot;status quo&quot; could continue, and the two argued inconclusively about the proposed Royal Commission. Returning to his Cabinet meeting, Smith reported the conversation to his ministers, and, after debating for a while, the Cabinet came to the conclusion that Wilson was simply attempting to buy more time and that there was no sign of actual progress. Smith asked if Rhodesia should declare its independence, and had each Cabinet minister answer in turn. According to Smith&#x27;s account, &quot;each one, quietly but firmly, without hesitation, said: &#x27;Yes&#x27;.&quot;

At 11:00 local time on 11 November 1965, Armistice Day, during the traditional two minutes&#x27; silence to remember the fallen of the two World Wars, Smith declared Rhodesia independent and signed the proclamation document, with Dupont and the other 10 ministers of the Cabinet following. The timing was intended to emphasise the sacrifices Rhodesia had made for Britain in wartime. As Ken Flower later said, &quot;the rebellion was made to appear as though it was not a rebellion&quot;. Smith and his ministers still pledged allegiance to Queen Elizabeth II, whose official portrait hung prominently behind them as they signed; the declaration even ended &quot;God Save The Queen&quot;. Four junior members of the Cabinet—Lance Smith, Ian Dillon, Andrew Dunlop and P K van der Byl—did not sign, but were included in the official photograph.

==Text of the declaration==

==Announcement and reactions==

===Announcement===
Prompted by the government, the Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation told the public to stand by for an important announcement from the Prime Minister at 13:15 local time. Smith went first to Government House to inform Gibbs that his Cabinet had declared independence, then to Pockets Hill Studios in east Salisbury to announce UDI to the nation. He read the proclamation aloud, then stated that independence had been declared because it had become &quot;abundantly clear that it is the policy of the British government to play us along with no real intention of arriving at a solution which we could possibly accept ... I promised the people of this country that I would continue to negotiate to the bitter end and that I would leave no stone unturned in my endeavours to secure an honourable and mutually accepted settlement; it now falls to me to tell you that negotiations have come to an end&quot;.

Smith said that he believed that he would be remiss in his duty if he allowed Rhodesia to continue to &quot;drift in its present paralysing state of uncertainty&quot;, and that following Britain&#x27;s abandonment of the Federation his government was determined that &quot;the same will never be allowed to happen here&quot;. He claimed that UDI did not mark &quot;a diminution in the opportunities which our African people have to advance and prosper in Rhodesia&quot;, described &quot;racial harmony in Africa&quot; as part of his agenda and condemned black Rhodesian activities as attempts to &quot;blackmail the British government into ... handing the country over to irresponsible rule&quot;. He then attempted to assuage fears that economic sanctions might destroy the economy, and asked Rhodesians to stand firm: &quot;The mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders ... In the lives of most nations there comes a moment when a stand has to be made for principles, whatever the consequences. This moment has come to Rhodesia ... the first Western nation in the last two decades to say &#x27;so far and no further&#x27;.&quot; He concluded with an assertion that the declaration of independence was &quot;a blow for the preservation of justice, civilisation and Christianity&quot;.

===Domestic reactions===

By the time Smith and Dupont arrived at Government House to see Gibbs, Whitehall had instructed the Governor to formally dismiss Smith and his ministers for treason. Gibbs complied without hesitation. Smith and his ministers ignored this, holding that under the new 1965 constitution Gibbs &quot;no longer ha[d] any executive powers in Rhodesia&quot;, and his reserve power to sack them no longer existed. The Rhodesian government hoped that Gibbs might obligingly resign in light of his impotent situation, but he did not; following orders from London, he remained at his post at Government House. Gibbs told the Rhodesian military&#x27;s senior officers, some of whom were troubled by the perceived choice between Queen and country, to remain at their posts to maintain law and order. He also refused some Army officers&#x27; requests for a warrant to arrest Smith. Wilson briefly flirted with the idea of sending Lord Mountbatten to Rhodesia to support Gibbs as a direct representative of the Queen, but this was dropped after Gibbs asked for somebody &quot;higher up&quot; in the royal family instead. &quot;Not likely&quot;, Wilson retorted. Prince Philip was suggested by diplomats to be appointed as Governor-General so he could legally sack Smith but this was refused due to the personal risk he would have been in.

The Rhodesian government accompanied UDI with emergency measures that it said were intended to prevent alarm, unrest and the flight of people and capital. Press censorship and petrol rationing were imposed, import licences were cancelled and emigration allowances were cut to £100. News of UDI was generally received calmly by the local citizenry, apart from some isolated incidents of passing cars being stoned in the black townships outside Bulawayo. A few expected dissenters were arrested, most prominently Leo Baron, Nkomo&#x27;s lawyer, whose links with black Rhodesians and communists were seen by authorities as &quot;subversive&quot;. Baron, the younger brother of the scientist Jacob Bronowski, was arrested nine minutes after UDI was made.

Welensky, who had opposed UDI, stated that he felt it was nevertheless &quot;the duty of every responsible Rhodesian to support the revolutionary government&quot; as he believed the only alternative was a descent into anarchy. João de Freitas Cruz, the Portuguese consul-general in Salisbury, reacted to the news with wild excitement; visiting the Smith residence later in the day, he declared &quot;Only Rhodesians could do this!&quot; A statement from ZAPU&#x27;s Jason Moyo, who was in London at the time, denounced UDI as an act of &quot;treason and rebellion&quot; and asserted that &quot;the lives particularly of four million unarmed Africans are in jeopardy&quot;. Davis M&#x27;Gabe of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) said that &quot;For all those who cherish freedom and a meaningful life, UDI has set a collision course which cannot be altered. [It has] marked the turning point of the struggle for freedom ... from a constitutional and political one to primarily a military struggle.&quot; Most major Christian denominational leaders in the country publicly rejected UDI and the assertion that it defended Christianity, with the exception of the local Dutch Reformed Church, which stated that it was apolitical and thereafter refrained from comment.

A week after UDI, Smith&#x27;s government announced that Dupont, the Deputy Prime Minister, had resigned from the Cabinet to accept the post of Officer Administering the Government created by the 1965 constitution. Attempting to assert his claimed prerogatives as Her Majesty&#x27;s Rhodesian Prime Minister, Smith advised the Queen by letter to appoint Dupont as Governor-General to supersede Gibbs. The letter was ignored, with Buckingham Palace characterising Smith&#x27;s request as &quot;purported advice&quot;. Whitehall maintained that Gibbs was the Queen&#x27;s only legitimate representative in what it still reckoned as the colony of Southern Rhodesia–and hence, the only lawful authority in the area. Dupont nevertheless effectively replaced the Governor. The Smith administration assigned him the Governor&#x27;s official residence at Government House, but no attempt was made to forcibly remove Gibbs and his entourage; the post-UDI government stated that the Officer Administering the Government would live at Governor&#x27;s Lodge instead &quot;until Government House, at present temporarily occupied by Sir Humphrey Gibbs in a private capacity, becomes available&quot;.

The Speaker of the Rhodesian parliament, A R W Stumbles, reconvened the Legislative Assembly on 25 November, resolving that if he did not there would be chaos. He feared that Gibbs might dramatically walk into the chamber in an attempt to stop the proceedings, but Gibbs did no such thing. The parliamentary opposition opened the meeting by asking whether the assembly was legal. Ahrn Palley, the lone white opposition MP, announced that as he saw it, &quot;certain Honourable Members in collusion have torn up the constitution under which this House meets. The proceedings have no legal validity whatsoever&quot;. Stumbles overruled this objection and two more interruptions from Palley, and suggested that any members with reservations might leave. Palley continued his loud protests until he was forcibly ejected by the Sergeant-at-Arms, shouting &quot;This is an illegal assembly! God save the Queen!&quot; Gondo and eight other opposition MPs followed Palley out; all ten of them rejoined the Legislative Assembly in February 1966.

Gibbs received threatening letters from the Rhodesian public, and on 26 November 1965 Smith&#x27;s government cut off the telephones at Government House, and removed the ceremonial guard, the official cars &quot;and even the typewriters&quot;, Wood records. Gibbs nevertheless refused to step down or to leave Government House, issuing a statement that he would remain there &quot;as the lawful Governor of Rhodesia until such time as constitutional government is restored, which I hope will be soon.&quot; He stayed at his post, ignored by the post-UDI government, until the declaration of a republic in 1970.

===British and international responses; sanctions===

Wilson was astonished by Smith&#x27;s actions, and found the timing of the declaration to coincide with the Armistice Day silence deeply insulting. Describing Salisbury as &quot;hell-bent on illegal self-destroying&quot;, the British Prime Minister, supported in the Commons by the Liberals and most Conservatives, called on Rhodesians to ignore the post-UDI government. Within hours of UDI, the UN General Assembly passed a condemnatory resolution, 107–2—South Africa and Portugal voted against, and France abstained—decrying Rhodesia&#x27;s actions and calling on Britain to end &quot;the rebellion by the unlawful authorities in Salisbury&quot;. The UN Security Council the next day adopted Resolution 216, which denounced the declaration of independence as illegal and racist, and called on all states to refuse recognition and assistance to the Rhodesian government. Security Council Resolution 217, following on 20 November, condemned UDI as an illegitimate &quot;usurpation of power by a racist settler minority&quot;, and called on nations neither to recognise what it deemed &quot;this illegal authority&quot; nor to entertain diplomatic or economic relations with it. Both of these measures were adopted by ten votes to none with France abstaining.

Rhodesian nationalists and their overseas supporters, prominently the OAU, clamoured for Britain to remove Smith&#x27;s government by force. The UN Committee on Independence also strongly advised military intervention. The British government dismissed this option because of various logistical issues, the risk of provoking a Rhodesian attack on Zambia and the psychological problems that were likely to accompany any confrontation between British and Rhodesian troops in what Smith said would be a &quot;fratricidal war&quot;. British Foreign Secretary Michael Stewart stated that the United Kingdom thought that Rhodesian forces were well-equipped, well-trained and highly motivated and that an invasion would lead to &quot;a medium sized war of uncertain duration&quot;. Wilson instead resolved to end the Rhodesian rebellion through economic sanctions; these principally comprised the expulsion of Rhodesia from the Sterling area, a ban on the import of Rhodesian sugar, tobacco, chrome and other goods and an oil boycott of Rhodesia. When the Rhodesians continued to receive oil, Wilson attempted to directly cut off their main supply lines, namely the Portuguese Mozambican ports at Beira and Lourenço Marques, by posting a Royal Navy squadron to the Mozambique Channel in March 1966. This blockade, the Beira Patrol, was endorsed the following month by UN Security Council Resolution 221. The United Nations proceeded to institute the first mandatory trade sanctions in its history with Security Council Resolutions 232 (December 1966) and 253 (April 1968), which required member states to cease all trade and economic links with Rhodesia.

Wilson predicted in January 1966 that the various boycotts would force Smith to give in &quot;within a matter of weeks rather than months&quot;, but the British and UN sanctions had little effect on Rhodesia, largely because South Africa and Portugal went on trading with the breakaway colony, providing it with oil and other commodities. Clandestine &quot;sanction-busting&quot; trade with other nations also continued, initially at a reduced level and the diminished presence of foreign competitors helped domestic industries to slowly mature and expand. Rhodesia thus avoided the economic collapse predicted by Wilson and gradually became more self-sufficient. The Rhodesian government set up a string of front holding companies in Switzerland, Luxembourg and Liechtenstein to help keep trade open with some success; goods that had been imported from Britain were replaced by Japanese, French and West German equivalents. Even many OAU states, while bombarding Rhodesia with vitriol, continued importing Rhodesian food and other products. The United States created a formal exception in its embargo with the Byrd Amendment of 1971, under which the US replaced its import of chrome from the Soviet Union with Rhodesian chrome ore. This breach of the UN sanctions, passed by the US Congress on the back of anti-communist Cold War considerations, was warmly welcomed by several white Southerners in Congress; it aided the Rhodesian economy until 1977, when the new president, Jimmy Carter, successfully pushed Congress to repeal it.

==Recognition==

===Foreign===

Official diplomatic recognition by other countries was key for Rhodesia as it was the only way it could regain the international legitimacy it had lost through UDI. Recognition by the UK itself through a bilateral settlement would be the &quot;first prize&quot;, in Smith&#x27;s words, as it would end sanctions and constitutional ambiguity and make foreign acceptance, at least in the West, far more likely. Considering their country a potentially important player in the Cold War as a &quot;bastion against communism&quot; in southern Africa, the RF posited that some Western countries might recognise UDI even without a prior Anglo-Rhodesian rapprochement. Specifically, it expected diplomatic recognition from South Africa and Portugal, and thought that France might recognise Rhodesia to annoy Britain and create a precedent for an independent Quebec. But although South Africa and Portugal gave economic, military and limited political support to the post-UDI government (as did France and other nations, to a lesser extent), neither they nor any other country ever recognised Rhodesia as a &quot;de jure&quot; independent state. Rhodesia&#x27;s unsuccessful attempts to win Western support and recognition included offers to the US government in 1966 and 1967, ignored by Lyndon B Johnson&#x27;s administration, to provide Rhodesian troops to fight alongside the Americans and other anti-communist forces in Vietnam.

Britain withdrew most of its High Commission staff from Salisbury in the days following UDI, leaving a small skeleton staff to man a &quot;residual mission&quot; intended to help Gibbs keep the British government informed of local happenings. Several countries followed Britain&#x27;s lead and closed their consulates in Salisbury, with one prominent exception to this being the United States, which retained its consulate-general in post-UDI Rhodesia, relabelling it a &quot;US Contacts Office&quot; to circumvent the problem of diplomatic recognition. South Africa and Portugal maintained &quot;Accredited Diplomatic Representative&quot; offices in Salisbury, which were embassies in all but name, while Rhodesia kept its pre-UDI overseas missions in Pretoria, Lisbon and Lourenço Marques. Unofficial representative offices of the Rhodesian government also existed in the US, Japan and West Germany, while a citizen of Belgium was employed to represent Rhodesian interests there with the Rhodesia Information Centre being in Australia to represent Rhodesia. The Rhodesian High Commission in London, located at Rhodesia House on the Strand, remained under the control of the post-UDI government and effectively became its representative office in the UK. Like the South African Embassy on Trafalgar Square, Rhodesia House became a regular target for political demonstrations. These continued even after Britain forced the office to close in 1969.

Because UDI claimed to make Rhodesia independent under the Queen as an effective dominion, many countries justified their retention of missions in Rhodesia concurrently with their non-recognition of the state by pointing out that the envoys&#x27; accreditation was to the Queen and not to Smith&#x27;s government &quot;per se&quot;. But Rhodesia moved away from its original line of independence as a constitutional monarchy and towards republicanism during the late 1960s, hoping to end ambiguity regarding its claimed constitutional status and elicit official foreign recognition. In March 1970, after the electorate had voted &quot;yes&quot; in a referendum the previous year both to a new constitution and to the abandoning of symbolic ties to the Queen, Smith&#x27;s government declared Rhodesia a republic. Far from prompting recognition, this led all countries apart from Portugal and South Africa to withdraw their consulates and missions, as the justification of royal accreditation could no longer be used. After Portugal&#x27;s Carnation Revolution in 1974, the Rhodesian mission in Lisbon was closed in May 1975, with its counterpart in Lourenço Marques following a month later on Mozambican independence. Portugal also withdrew its own remaining officials from Rhodesia, leaving South Africa as the only country with links to Salisbury. Rhodesia&#x27;s diplomatic activities were thereafter greatly diminished.

===Judicial===
The Rhodesian High Court&#x27;s nine Appellate and General Division judges initially neither rejected UDI nor openly supported it. The Chief Justice Sir Hugh Beadle, of the Appellate Division, announced simply that the judges would go on carrying out their duties &quot;according to the law&quot;. This originally noncommittal stance evolved over time, largely pivoting around legal cases argued at the High Court in Salisbury between 1966 and 1968. The first of these, &quot;Madzimbamuto v. Lardner-Burke N. O. and Others&quot;, concerned Daniel Madzimbamuto, a black Rhodesian who was detained without trial by the Rhodesian government on 6 November 1965, the day after the declaration of a state of emergency and five days before UDI, on the grounds that he might pose a danger to the public. Desmond Lardner-Burke, the Rhodesian Minister of Justice and Law and Order, prolonged the state of emergency in February 1966, prompting Madzimbamuto&#x27;s wife to appeal for his release, arguing that since the United Kingdom had declared UDI illegal and outlawed the Rhodesian government with the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965, the state of emergency (and, by extension, Madzimbamuto&#x27;s imprisonment) had no legal basis.

The General Division of the Rhodesian High Court ruled on 9 September 1966 that legal sovereignty lay with the British government, but that to &quot;avoid chaos and a vacuum in the law&quot; the Rhodesian government should be considered to be in control of law and order to the same extent as before UDI. In February 1968, ruling on Madzimbamuto&#x27;s appeal, Beadle concluded that the Smith administration would be recognised by the local judiciary as the &quot;de facto&quot; government by virtue of its &quot;effective control over the state&#x27;s territory&quot;, but that &quot;de jure&quot; recognition would be withheld as this was not &quot;firmly established&quot;. Madzimbamuto applied for the right to appeal to the British Privy Council; the Rhodesian Appellate Division promptly ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council considered his case anyway.

In late February 1968, considering the fate of James Dhlamini, Victor Mlambo and Duly Shadreck, three black Rhodesians convicted of murder and terrorist offences before UDI, Beadle ruled that Salisbury retained its pre-UDI powers regarding executions and could carry out death sentences. Whitehall announced on 1 March that at the request of the UK government, the Queen had exercised the royal prerogative of mercy and commuted the three death sentences to life imprisonment. Dhlamini and the others applied for a permanent stay of execution on this basis. At the hearing for Dhlamini and Mlambo on 4 March 1968, Beadle argued that he saw the statement from London as a decision by the UK government and not the Queen herself, and that in any case the 1961 constitution had transferred the prerogative of mercy from Britain to the Rhodesian Executive Council. &quot;The present government is the fully &quot;de facto&quot; government and as such is the only power that can exercise the prerogative&quot;, he concluded. &quot;It would be strange indeed if the United Kingdom government, exercising no internal power in Rhodesia, were given the right to exercise the prerogative of clemency.&quot; The Judge President Sir Vincent Quenet and Justice Hector Macdonald agreed, and the application was dismissed. Justice John Fieldsend of the High Court&#x27;s General Division resigned in protest, writing to Gibbs that he no longer believed the High Court to be defending the rights of Rhodesian citizens. Dhlamini, Mlambo and Shadreck were hanged on 6 March.

On 23 July 1968, the Privy Council in London ruled in Madzimbamuto&#x27;s favour, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether the 1961 or 1965 constitution was considered effective. It declared the latter, &quot;revolutionary&quot; constitution illegal, and ruled that the former was overridden by the Southern Rhodesia Act 1965, which had effectively outlawed the Rhodesian legislative, administrative and legal authorities in British law. Lord Reid, delivering the majority opinion (Lord Pearce dissented), argued that the &quot;usurper&quot; government, though the effective master of Rhodesia, could not be considered lawful as the UK government was still attempting to regain control and it was impossible to say whether or not it would succeed. He ruled that only Whitehall could determine what constituted the maintenance of &quot;law and order&quot; in Rhodesia, and that the Rhodesian emergency measures were unlawful as they had been formalised by the Officer Administering the Government, a post-UDI figure who was, in British eyes, unconstitutional. Reid concluded that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as they no longer accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice J R Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies&#x27; ruling on 12 August and four days later was sworn in as Chief Justice of Botswana.

The Rhodesian High Court granted full &quot;de jure&quot; recognition to the post-UDI government on 13 September 1968, while rejecting the appeals of 32 black Rhodesians who had been a month earlier convicted of terrorist offences and sentenced to death. Beadle declared that while he believed the Rhodesian judiciary should respect rulings of the Privy Council &quot;so far as possible&quot;, the judgement of 23 July had made it legally impossible for Rhodesian judges to continue under the 1961 constitution. He asserted that the court therefore faced a choice between the 1965 constitution and a legal vacuum, the latter of which he felt he could not endorse. Referring to the Privy Council&#x27;s decision that the UK might yet remove the post-UDI government, he said that &quot;on the facts as they exist today, the only prediction which this court can make is that sanctions will not succeed in overthrowing the present government ... and that there are no other factors which might succeed in doing so&quot;.

Macdonald, a member of Beadle&#x27;s ruling panel, argued that since UDI, the British government had acted unconstitutionally and illegally regarding Rhodesia by involving the United Nations in what should have been legally considered a domestic problem, and had concurrently abdicated its right to the allegiance of the Rhodesian people by waging economic war against the country and encouraging other nations to do the same. To support this argument, Macdonald referred to the assertion by the 17th-century Dutch jurist Hugo Grotius that &quot;the purpose of governing and the purpose of destroying cannot subsist together&quot;. Since Britain was in a state of economic war against Rhodesia, the court concluded, it could not at the same time be regarded as governing it. UDI, the associated 1965 constitution and the government were thereafter considered &quot;de jure&quot; by the Rhodesian legal system.

The British Commonwealth Secretary, George Thomson, promptly accused the Rhodesian judges of breaching &quot;the fundamental laws of the land&quot;, while Gibbs announced that since his position as Governor existed under the 1961 constitution, which allowed appeals to the Privy Council, he could only reject the Rhodesian court ruling. The Rhodesian judges continued regardless. Their recognition of the post-UDI order carried over to the 1969 republican constitution, adopted in 1970.

==Replacement of national symbols==

Vestiges of British ties were removed piecemeal by the government over the decade following UDI, and replaced with symbols and terminology intended to be more uniquely Rhodesian. A silver &quot;Liberty Bell&quot;, based on the bell of the same name in Philadelphia, was cast during 1966 and rung by the Prime Minister 12 times each year on Independence Day (the anniversary of UDI), with some in the press erroneously believing the number of chimes signifying the number of years since the declaration of independence. The Union Jack and Rhodesia&#x27;s Commonwealth-style national flag—a defaced Sky Blue Ensign with the Union Jack in the canton—continued to fly over government buildings, military bases and other official locations until 11 November 1968, the third anniversary of UDI, when they were superseded by a new national flag: a green-white-green vertical triband, charged centrally with the Rhodesian coat of arms. The Union Jack continued to be ceremonially raised at Cecil Square in Salisbury on 12 September each year as part of the Pioneers&#x27; Day holiday, which marked the anniversary of the establishment of Salisbury (and, by extension, Rhodesia) in 1890.

Since Elizabeth II was still the Rhodesian head of state in the eyes of Smith&#x27;s administration until 1970, &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; remained the Rhodesian national anthem, and continued to accompany official occasions such as the opening of the Rhodesian parliament. This was intended to demonstrate Rhodesia&#x27;s continued loyalty to the Queen, but the use of the unmistakably British song at Rhodesian state occasions soon seemed &quot;fairly ironic&quot;, as &quot;The Times&quot; put it. Salisbury started looking for a replacement anthem around the same time as its introduction of the new flag, and in 1974, after four years without an anthem (&quot;God Save the Queen&quot; was formally dropped in 1970), republican Rhodesia adopted &quot;Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia&quot;, an anthem coupling original lyrics with the tune of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;. The country&#x27;s head of state under the republican constitution was the President of Rhodesia, the first of whom was Dupont.

State press censorship, which had been introduced on UDI, was lifted in early April 1968. Decimalisation occurred on 17 February 1970, two weeks before Rhodesia&#x27;s reconstitution as a republic, with the new Rhodesian dollar replacing the pound at a rate of two dollars to each pound. Following the republic&#x27;s formal declaration the next month, the Rhodesian military removed nomenclatural and symbolic references to the Crown—the Royal Rhodesian Air Force and Royal Rhodesia Regiment dropped their &quot;Royal&quot; prefixes after the Queen formally revoked them because of the declaration, new branch and regimental flags were designed, and the St Edward&#x27;s Crown surmounting many regimental emblems was expunged in favour of the &quot;Lion and Tusk&quot;, a motif from the coat of arms of the British South Africa Company that had been used in Rhodesian military symbolism since the 1890s. The air force&#x27;s new roundel was a green ring with the lion and tusk on a white centre. Later that year, a system of new Rhodesian honours and decorations was created to replace the old British honours. Rhodesia&#x27;s police force, the British South Africa Police, was not renamed.

==Ending UDI==

Wilson told the British House of Commons in January 1966 that he would not enter any kind of dialogue with the post-UDI Rhodesian &quot;illegal regime&quot; until it gave up its claim of independence, but by mid-1966 British and Rhodesian civil servants were holding &quot;talks about talks&quot; in London and Salisbury. By November that year, Wilson had agreed to negotiate personally with Smith. The two Prime Ministers unsuccessfully attempted to settle aboard HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; in December 1966 and HMS &quot;Fearless&quot; in October 1968. In spite of this lack of success the United Kingdom on 17 March 1970 joined the United States in casting the latter&#x27;s first-ever veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution intended to sanction (if not end) Rhodesia.

After the Conservatives returned to power in Britain in 1970, provisional agreement was reached in November 1971 between the Rhodesian government and a British team headed by Douglas-Home (who was Foreign Secretary under Prime Minister Edward Heath), and in early 1972 a Royal Commission chaired by Lord Pearce travelled to Rhodesia to investigate how acceptable the proposals were to majority opinion. After extensive consultation, the commission reported that while whites, coloureds and Asians were largely in favour of the presented terms, most blacks rejected them. The deal was therefore shelved by the British government.

The Rhodesian Bush War, a guerrilla conflict pitting the Rhodesian Security Forces against the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army (ZANLA) and the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA), the respective armed wings of ZANU and ZAPU, began in earnest in December 1972, when ZANLA attacked Altena and Whistlefield Farms in north-eastern Rhodesia. The 1974 Carnation Revolution in Portugal, which over the next year replaced Portuguese support for Smith with an independent, Marxist–Leninist Mozambique on Rhodesia&#x27;s eastern frontier, greatly swung the war&#x27;s momentum in favour of the nationalists (particularly ZANU, which was allied with Mozambique&#x27;s governing FRELIMO party), and caused the sanctions on Rhodesia to finally begin having a noticeable effect. Diplomatic isolation, the sanctions, guerrilla activities and pressure from South Africa to find a settlement led the Rhodesian government to hold talks with the various black Rhodesian factions. Abortive conferences were held at Victoria Falls (in 1975) and Geneva (1976). Despite ideological and tribal rifts, ZANU and ZAPU nominally united as the &quot;Patriotic Front&quot; (PF) in late 1976 in a successful attempt to augment overseas support for the black Rhodesian cause.

By the mid-1970s, it was apparent that white minority rule could not continue forever. Even South Africa&#x27;s prime minister Vorster realized that white rule in a country where blacks outnumbered whites 22:1 was not a realistic option. Smith, who was decisively re-elected three times during the 1970s, eventually came to this conclusion as well. He announced his acceptance in principle of one man, one vote during Henry Kissinger&#x27;s Anglo-American initiative in September 1976, and in March 1978 concluded the Internal Settlement with non-militant nationalist groups headed by Bishop Abel Muzorewa, the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole and Chief Jeremiah Chirau. This settlement, boycotted by the PF and rejected internationally, led to multiracial elections and Rhodesia&#x27;s reconstitution under majority rule as Zimbabwe Rhodesia in June 1979. Muzorewa, the electoral victor, took office as the country&#x27;s first black Prime Minister at the head of a coalition Cabinet comprising 12 blacks and five whites, including Smith as minister without portfolio. Dismissing Muzorewa as a &quot;neocolonial puppet&quot;, ZANLA and ZIPRA continued their armed struggle until December 1979, when Whitehall, Salisbury and the Patriotic Front settled at Lancaster House. Muzorewa&#x27;s government revoked UDI, thereby ending the country&#x27;s claim to be independent after 14 years, and dissolved itself. The UK suspended the constitution and vested full executive and legislative powers in a new Governor, Lord Soames, who oversaw a ceasefire and fresh elections during February and March 1980. These were won by ZANU, whose leader Robert Mugabe became Prime Minister when the UK granted independence to Zimbabwe as a republic within the Commonwealth in April 1980. African nationalist politicians continued to cite their opposition to the UDI as a means of legitimising their rule of Zimbabwe into the 21st century. Since it was issued, the UDI has been recounted in scholarly literature, autobiographies of those involved in its creation, and works of fiction.

<text>Hell&#x27;s Angel is a television documentary programme criticising Mother Teresa which premiered in the UK on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Without Walls&quot; arts strand on 8 November 1994. It was hosted by Christopher Hitchens, directed by Jenny Morgan, and produced by journalist Tariq Ali. Hitchens and Ali co-wrote the programme&#x27;s script. Hitchens originally titled the documentary &quot;Sacred Cow&quot;, but the film&#x27;s backers instead chose &quot;Hell&#x27;s Angel&quot; as the title.

A precursor to Hitchens&#x27; book &quot;The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice&quot; (1995), the film argues that Mother Teresa urged the poor to accept their circumstances as their destiny and for the poor and sick in particular to submit to the substandard, unsafe, and non-therapeutic medical care provided by her clinics while she endorsed and accepted money from a variety of rich and powerful people who had stunning ethical lapses.

==Context==
&quot;Hell&#x27;s Angel&quot; stands as an opposition voice to what its creators perceived as the largely fawning and unquestioning press coverage of Mother Teresa at the time. Of the prior and contemporary press coverage, it states: &quot;This profane marriage between tawdry media hype and medieval superstition gave birth to an icon which few have since had the poor taste to question.&quot; Aroup Chatterjee&#x27;s criticisms of Mother Teresa inspired the creation of the film.

==Synopsis==
Christopher Hitchens narrates the documentary on camera, introducing and explaining a series of video clips to make a case against Mother Teresa and her enterprise. The documentary&#x27;s key claims and points are:
* The media&#x27;s credulous reporting on Mother Teresa started with a 1969 BBC documentary by Malcolm Muggeridge called &quot;Something Beautiful for God&quot;. It reported on Mother Teresa&#x27;s Home for the Dying in Kolkata, India. Some parts of the documentary were successfully filmed in dark interior spaces and Muggeridge claimed that the ability to see details in the film was due to Mother Teresa&#x27;s &quot;divine light.&quot; However, the camera operator at the time, Ken McMillan, is interviewed and says the real explanation was that a new, higher-sensitivity film from Kodak was being used.
* Mary Loudon, a writer and former volunteer at the Home for the Dying, says in an interview that it reminded her of photos she had seen of World War I facilities. There were basic cots but no chairs, no garden, and no yard. The dying patients were not being given any medication other than Aspirin or Ibuprofen. She also relayed a story about how drip needles were not sterilised between uses because the nuns saw no benefit to it and a story about how a sick, but treatable, 15-year-old boy should have been sent to the local hospital for help but the nuns refused.
* Hitchens relates that in 1980 Mother Teresa said that the Home for the Dying is &quot;how we fight abortion and contraception in Kolkata.&quot; In her 1979 acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize, Mother Teresa is shown calling abortion murder and the &quot;greatest destroyer of peace.&quot; She is also shown saying that abortion and birth control should remain illegal in Ireland. Hitchens charges that &quot;a campaign against family planning is low on the list of Kolkata&#x27;s many pressing needs&quot; and that Mother Teresa&#x27;s &quot;tenderness&quot; toward the unborn should be seen as an overtly political position since she also campaigns against birth control.
* Mihir Bose, author &amp; journalist, explains in an interview that the people of the West see Mother Teresa as one of them, making sacrifices for the poor in the third world and rescuing them.
* Mother Teresa is documented as having supported and been rewarded by Jean-Claude &quot;Baby Doc&quot; Duvalier (Haiti), Enver Hoxha (Albania), Charles Keating (U.S.), and Ronald Reagan (U.S.); all of whom had a need to publicly gloss over their various shortcomings.
* After the Union Carbide disaster in Bhopal, India, Mother Teresa&#x27;s advice to the victims was merely to &quot;forgive.&quot; Mihir Bose says that this shows how Mother Teresa is wholly uninterested in improving the lives of the poor in the world and tackling the problems of poverty.

==Reception==
The documentary was seen by 1.6 million viewers. The programme &quot;sparked an international debate&quot; on Mother Teresa&#x27;s work as its reporting contradicted the feel-good Mother Teresa narrative promulgated by the media. 130 complaints were submitted to the Independent Television Commission, which took no action. Hitchens reported that it led to &quot;venomous and irrational attacks.&quot;

==Follow up==
Christopher Hitchens&#x27; 1995 book, &quot;The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice&quot;, detailed and expanded on many of the same points made in the film.

Mother Teresa forgave the documentary&#x27;s creators for making it. Christopher Hitchens criticized that forgiveness, saying it was &quot;odd, since we had not sought forgiveness from her or from anyone else. Odder still if you have any inclination to ask by what right she assumes the power to forgive.&quot;

Mother Teresa died in 1997. Aroup Chatterjee and Christopher Hitchens took the position of &#x27;devil&#x27;s advocates&#x27;, or Promoters of Justice (), in the Catholic Church&#x27;s beatification procedures for Mother Teresa in 2003. She was canonized as a Roman Catholic saint in 2016. Sanal Edamaruku and others have argued against the two miracles that were required for her canonization and credited to her.

Gëzim Alpion wrote the critical book &quot;Mother Teresa: Saint or Celebrity?&quot; (2007) and Aroup Chatterjee wrote &quot;Mother Teresa: The Final Verdict&quot; (2003) which was reissued as &quot;Mother Teresa: The Untold Story&quot; in 2016.

<text>Skylab 2 (also SL-2 and SLM-1) was the first crewed mission to Skylab, the first American orbital space station. The mission was launched on an Apollo command and service module by a Saturn IB rocket on May 25, 1973, and carried NASA astronauts Pete Conrad, Joseph P. Kerwin, Paul J. Weitz to the station. The name Skylab 2 also refers to the vehicle used for that mission. The Skylab 2 mission established a twenty-eight-day record for human spaceflight duration. Its crew was the first space station occupants ever to return safely to Earth – the only previous space station occupants, the crew of the 1971 Soyuz 11 mission that had crewed the Salyut 1 station for twenty-four days, died upon reentry due to unexpected cabin depressurization.

The crewed Skylab missions were officially designated Skylab 2, 3, and 4. Miscommunication about the numbering resulted in the mission emblems reading &quot;Skylab I&quot;, &quot;Skylab II&quot;, and &quot;Skylab 3&quot; respectively.

==Mission highlights==

The Skylab station suffered significant damage on its May 14 launch: its micrometeorite shield, and one of its primary solar arrays had torn loose during launch, and the remaining primary solar array was jammed. Without the shield which was designed to also provide thermal protection, Skylab baked in the Sun, and rising temperatures inside the workshop released toxic materials into the station&#x27;s atmosphere and endangered on-board film and food. The first crew was supposed to launch on May 15, but instead had to train practicing repair techniques as they were developed by the engineers. Ground controllers purged the atmosphere with pure nitrogen four times, before refilling it with the nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere for the crew. The secret National Reconnaissance Office used a KH-8 Gambit 3 to photograph the damaged station.

On May 25, Skylab 2 lifted from LC-39B, the first Saturn IB launch in almost five years and only the second-ever launch from Pad 39B. Booster performance was nominal except for one momentary glitch that could have threatened the mission – when the Commit signal was sent to the Saturn at ignition, the instrument unit sent a command to switch the launch vehicle from internal to external power. This would have shut down the Saturn&#x27;s electrical system, but not the propulsion system, and likely cause the disaster scenario of an uncontrollable booster, requiring the Launch Escape System to be activated and the Command Module pulled away to safety, followed by Range Safety destroying the errant launch vehicle. However, the duration of the cutoff signal was less than one second, too short a time for the electrical relay in the booster to be activated, so nothing happened and the launch proceeded as planned. This glitch was traced to a modification of the pad electrical equipment and corrective steps were taken to prevent it from happening again. On reaching the station, Conrad flew their Apollo Command and Service Module (CSM) around it to inspect the damage, then soft-docked with it to avoid the necessity of station keeping while the crew ate, and flight controllers planned the first repair attempt. Then they undocked so that Conrad could position the CSM by the jammed solar panel, and Weitz could perform a stand-up EVA, trying to free the array by tugging at it with a 10-foot hooked pole, while Kerwin held onto his legs. This failed, and consumed a significant amount of the Skylab&#x27;s nitrogen maneuvering fuel to keep it steady in the process.

The crew then attempted to perform the hard dock to Skylab, but the capture latches failed to operate. After eight failed attempts, they donned their pressure suits again and partially dis-assembled the CSM&#x27;s docking probe; the next attempt worked. Once inside the station, the crew deployed a collapsible parasol through the small scientific airlock to act as a sunshade. (This approach was suggested and designed by NASA&#x27;s &quot;Mr. Fix It&quot; Jack Kinzler, who was awarded the NASA Distinguished Service Medal for the effort.) Successful deployment of the sunshade dropped inside temperatures to sustainable levels.
Two weeks later, Conrad and Kerwin performed a second EVA, freeing the stuck solar panel and increasing the electrical power to the workshop. They had prepared for this repair by practicing in the Neutral Buoyancy Simulator at the Marshall Space Flight Center. Without power from the panel, the second and third Skylab missions would have been unable to perform their main experiments, and the station&#x27;s critical battery system would have been seriously degraded. During this EVA, the sudden deployment of the solar panel structure caused both astronauts to be flung from the station&#x27;s hull, testing their nerves as well as the strength of their safety tethers. After recovering their composure, both astronauts returned to their positions on the station and completed the EVA.

For nearly a month they made further repairs to the workshop, conducted medical experiments, gathered solar and Earth science data, and performed a total of 392 hours of experiments. The mission tracked two minutes of a large solar flare with the Apollo Telescope Mount; they took and returned some 29,000 frames of film of the sun. The Skylab 2 astronauts spent 28 days in space, which doubled the previous U.S. record. The mission ended successfully on June 22, 1973, when Skylab 2 splashing down in the Pacific Ocean 9.6 km from the recovery ship USS &quot;Ticonderoga&quot;. Skylab 2 set the records for the longest duration crewed spaceflight, greatest distance traveled and greatest mass docked in space. Conrad set the record for most time in space for an astronaut.

==Mission insignia==
The mission patch was designed by Kelly Freas, a well-known artist highly regarded in the science fiction community, who was suggested to NASA by science fiction author and editor Ben Bova. The insignia features Skylab above the earth with the sun in the background. In an article for &quot;Analog Science Fiction/Science Fact&quot; magazine, Freas said, &quot;Among the suggestions the astronauts had made was the idea of a solar eclipse as seen from Skylab. It soon became clear that this idea would solve several problems at once: it pointed up the solar study function of Skylab, it would give me the large circular shape of the Earth as counterpoint to the angularity of the cluster, and it would establish firmly the connection of Skylab to the Earth. In addition, it would give a chance to get the necessary high contrast for good visibility of the tiny finished patch. ... I made several studies of cloud patterns on the planet, reducing them finally to very conventionalized swirls. The Skylab cluster was simplified and simplified again, till it became simply a black form with a white edgelight to set it off.&quot;

<text>&quot;Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia&quot; (or &quot;Voices of Rhodesia&quot;) was the national anthem of Rhodesia and Zimbabwe Rhodesia (renamed Zimbabwe in April 1980) between 1974 and 1979. The tune was that of &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, the Fourth Movement from Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, which had been adopted as the official European continental anthem by the Council of Europe in 1972 (it remains the European Union&#x27;s anthem today). The music used in Rhodesia was an original sixteen-bar arrangement by Captain Ken MacDonald, the bandmaster of the Rhodesian African Rifles. A national competition was organised by the government to find an appropriate set of lyrics to match the chosen tune, and won by Mary Bloom of Gwelo.

In the fallout from Rhodesia&#x27;s Unilateral Declaration of Independence from the United Kingdom on 11 November 1965, the country still claimed loyalty to Queen Elizabeth II as its professed head of state, and so retained &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; as its national anthem. With Rhodesia&#x27;s reconstitution in 1970 as a republic, however, the royal anthem was dropped along with many other references to the monarchy, leaving it without a national anthem until it adopted &quot;Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia&quot; in 1974. The national anthem lost its legal status in December 1979, when the United Kingdom retook interim control of the country pending its internationally recognised independence as Zimbabwe five months later. Rhodesia&#x27;s use of the well-known Beethoven tune has since caused the playing of &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; to be controversial in modern-day Zimbabwe.

==History==

===Background===

A dispute over the terms for the granting of full statehood to the self-governing colony of Rhodesia led its predominantly white minority government, headed by Prime Minister Ian Smith, to unilaterally declare independence from the UK on 11 November 1965. As Whitehall had been insisting on majority rule as a condition for independence, this declaration went unrecognised and caused the UK and the United Nations to impose economic sanctions on Rhodesia. Queen Elizabeth II continued to be &quot;Queen of Rhodesia&quot; in the eyes of Smith&#x27;s government, hence &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; remained the Rhodesian national anthem. Though this was intended to demonstrate Rhodesia&#x27;s enduring loyalty to the Queen, the retention of a song so associated with the UK in the midst of the Anglo-Rhodesian constitutional struggle soon gave Rhodesian state occasions &quot;a faintly ironic tone&quot;, in the words of the London &quot;Times&quot;.

===Adoption===

The Rhodesian government initiated a search for a new anthem around the time of its adoption of a new green-and-white flag in November 1968, but continued to use &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; until June 1969, when the mostly white electorate voted in favour of a republican form of government. The royal anthem officially remained in place until the formal declaration of a republic in March 1970, when it was abandoned along with numerous other overt references to the Crown. Republican Rhodesia was without an anthem for over four years before the chosen music was announced on 28 August 1974: the Fourth Movement, commonly called &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, from Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. The fact that the Council of Europe had adopted this tune as the &quot;Anthem of Europe&quot; in January 1972 apparently did not perturb the Rhodesian government; John Sutherland and Stephen Fender comment that Rhodesia&#x27;s choice proved deeply embarrassing for the UK&#x27;s Labour government, whose leaders now had to respect a melody associated with Rhodesia when attending official European functions. With a tune now in place, the Rhodesian government organised a nationwide competition to write matching lyrics, the winner of which would receive a cash prize of R$500 (equal to about US$1,000).

The Council of Europe, though less than pleased with Rhodesia&#x27;s selection, did not object to it, reasoning that so long as Rhodesia was using &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; in its original form, it could not be subject to reproach as the music was long out of copyright and in the public domain. It did announce, however, that should Rhodesia use the same arrangement as the Council of Europe, then the author of that score, Herbert von Karajan, would have grounds for a plagiarism lawsuit. Such an incident was averted when Rhodesia adopted an original sixteen-bar arrangement by Captain Ken MacDonald, the Rhodesian African Rifles&#x27; bandmaster. The anthem&#x27;s inaugural instrumental performance in Salisbury provoked mixed reactions: some were enthusiastic—including a coloured sergeant musician who proudly told the &quot;Rhodesia Herald&quot; that &quot;it&#x27;s just like &#x27;God Save Our Gracious Queen&#x27;&quot;—but many others were disappointed that the government had not commissioned an original tune. Rhys Lewis, music critic for the &quot;Herald&quot;, wrote that he was &quot;stupefied&quot; by the government&#x27;s choice, which he said was not only unoriginal, but also so associated with supranational brotherhood that it risked making internationally isolated Rhodesia the subject of ridicule. Phinias Sithole, who headed the African Trade Union Congress (a black Rhodesian trade union federation), commented that he did not believe most of the country&#x27;s blacks would identify with a song chosen while people of their ethnicity remained largely absent from the government&#x27;s top levels.

The winning lyricist was confirmed on 24 September 1974 to be Mary Bloom, a company director, music critic and poet from Gwelo, who had moved to Rhodesia from South Africa in 1947. Bloom titled her work &quot;Voices of Rhodesia&quot;, but the full first line, &quot;Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia&quot;, ultimately entered common parlance as the song&#x27;s title.

Foreign observers were less than impressed; the British journalist Richard West, remarking that white Rhodesians were &quot;renownedly philistine&quot;, asked &quot;how could one not... squirm with embarrassment when the TV ends at night with the Rhodesian national anthem to the tune of Beethoven&#x27;s Choral Symphony?&quot;

==Lyrics== 

The lyrics officially adopted were as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;
Rise, O voices of Rhodesia,
God may we Thy bounty share.
Give us strength to face all danger,
And where challenge is, to dare.
Guide us, Lord, to wise decision,
Ever of Thy grace aware,
Oh, let our hearts beat bravely always
For this land within Thy care.

Rise, O voices of Rhodesia,
Bringing her your proud acclaim,
Grandly echoing through the mountains,
Rolling o&#x27;er the far flung plain.
Roaring in the mighty rivers,
Joining in one grand refrain,
Ascending to the sunlit heavens,
Telling of her honoured name.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Fall from use and legacy==
&quot;Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia&quot; remained in official usage for the rest of Rhodesia&#x27;s history, as well as between June and December 1979, when Rhodesia was reconstituted as Zimbabwe Rhodesia, a black-ruled version of the same country, which also failed to achieve legitimacy in the eyes of the United Kingdom and the United Nations. Though the anthem remained in place during these six months, a new flag was adopted and Rhodesia&#x27;s national holidays, largely based around colonial figures and milestones, were replaced by alternatives intended to be more inclusive: President&#x27;s Day, Unity Day and Ancestors Day. The national anthem remained unchanged on 12 December 1979, when Zimbabwe Rhodesia came under the UK&#x27;s control for an interim period once again as Southern Rhodesia, before internationally recognised independence came in April 1980, with the country now called Zimbabwe. &quot;Ishe Komborera Africa&quot;, a Shona translation of Enoch Sontonga&#x27;s Xhosa hymn &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; (&quot;God Bless Africa&quot; in English), was made Zimbabwe&#x27;s first national anthem, and remained in place until 1994, when it was replaced by the present anthem, &quot;Simudzai Mureza wedu WeZimbabwe&quot; (&quot;Blessed be the Land of Zimbabwe&quot;).

Because of its use by &quot;Rise, O Voices of Rhodesia&quot;, the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; melody is controversial in Zimbabwe, where its annual playing at foreign embassies on Europe Day initially caused shock to Zimbabwean government officials who, according to historian Josephine Fisher, had not previously been aware of the tune&#x27;s use by the Council of Europe. During the 1980s, Derek Hudson, the long-time conductor of the Bulawayo Philharmonic Orchestra, had considerable difficulty securing official permission to give the first Zimbabwean performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Ninth Symphony. He was eventually able to do so, but only after prolonged negotiations with the authorities. When &quot;Ode to Joy&quot; was included in a fundraising organ recital held by a Harare church at Christmas 1994, it provoked angry protests from some who attended.

<text>El Tajín is a pre-Columbian archeological site in southern Mexico and is one of the largest and most important cities of the Classic era of Mesoamerica. A part of the Classic Veracruz culture, El Tajín flourished from 600 to 1200 AD and during this time numerous temples, palaces, ballcourts, and pyramids were built. From the time the city fell, in 1230, to 1785, no European seems to have known of its existence, until a government inspector chanced upon the Pyramid of the Niches.

El Tajín, named after the Totonac rain god, was named a World Heritage site in 1992, due to its cultural importance and its architecture. This architecture includes the use of decorative niches and cement in forms unknown in the rest of Mesoamerica. Its best-known monument is the Pyramid of the Niches, but other important monuments include the Arroyo Group, the North and South Ballcourts and the palaces of Tajín Chico. In total there have been 20 ballcourts discovered at this site, (the last 3 being discovered in March 2013). Since the 1970s, El Tajin has been the most important archeological site in Veracruz for tourists, attracting 386,406 visitors in 2017.

It is also the site of the annual Cumbre Tajin Festival, which occurs each March featuring indigenous and foreign cultural events as well as concerts by popular musicians.

==Location==
The site is located in Mexico in the highlands of the municipality of Papantla in modern-day Veracruz, not far from the city of Poza Rica, which lies northwest of the port and city of Veracruz. The city is set in the low rolling mountains that lead from the Sierra Madre Oriental to the Gulf coast near the Tecolutla River. In ancient times, this city was located in the northeast corner of what is called Mesoamerica, and controlled an area from between the Cazones and Tecolutla Rivers to the modern state of Puebla. The main city is defined by two streams which merge to form the Tlahuanapa Arroyo, a tributary of the Tecolutla River. These two streams provided the population&#x27;s potable water. Most of the buildings are at the southern end, where the land is relatively flat and the two streams converge. The site extends to the northwest where terraces were constructed to place more buildings, mostly for the city&#x27;s elite. However the city also had communities located on the hills east and west of the main city, with mostly lower-class dwellings. The total site extends for .

The area is rainforest, with a hot wet climate of the Senegal type. Average temperature for the year is 35 °C with hurricanes possible from June to October. It is also affected by a weather phenomenon called “nortes.” These are cold fronts with winds that come from the north and down the Tamaulipas and Veracruz coasts. The site has no major settlements located next to it. Surrounding it are tobacco fields, banana plantations, apiaries and vanilla groves. The closest settlement of any real size is Papantla.

==Name==
When it was rediscovered by officialdom in 1785, the site was known to the local Totonac, whose ancestors may also have built the city, as El Tajín, which was said to mean “of thunder or lightning bolt”. Related to this is their belief that twelve old thunderstorm deities, known as Tajín, still inhabit the ruins. However, a series of indigenous maps dating from the time of the Spanish conquest, found in nearby Tihuatlan and now known as the Lienzos de Tuxpan, suggest that the city might then have been called “Mictlan” or “place of the dead”, a common denomination for ancient sites whose original names have been lost. This name also appears in the Matricula de Tributos, a surviving Aztec tribute record, which later formed part of the Codex Mendoza. This may therefore be linked to another Totonac meaning claimed for El Tajín: “place of the invisible beings or spirits”.

==History of the city==
Chronology studies at Tajín and nearby sites show that the area has been occupied at least since 5600 BCE and show how nomadic hunters and gatherers eventually became sedentary farmers, building more complex societies prior to the rise of the city of El Tajin. The pace of this societal progression became more rapid with the rise of the neighboring Olmec civilization around 1150 BCE, although the Olmecs were never here in great numbers. It is unclear who built the city. Some argue in favor of the Totonacs and the Xapaneca; however, there is a significant amount of evidence that the area was populated by the Huastec at the time the settlement was founded in the 1st century CE Monumental construction started soon after and by 600 CE, El Tajín was a city. The rapid rise of Tajin was due to its strategic position along the old Mesoamerican trade routes. It controlled the flow of commodities, both exports such as vanilla and imports from other locations in what is now Mexico and Central America. From the early centuries, objects from Teotihuacan are abundant.

From 600 to 1200 CE, El Tajín was a prosperous city that eventually controlled much of what is now modern Veracruz state. The city-state was highly centralized, with the city itself having more than fifty ethnicities living there. Most of the population lived in the hills surrounding the main city, and the city obtained most of its foodstuffs from the Tecolutla, Nautla and Cazones areas. These fields not only produced staples such as corn and beans but luxury items such as cacao. One of the panels at the Pyramid of the Niches shows a ceremony being held at a cacao tree. The religion was based on the movements of the planets, the stars and the Sun and Moon, with the Mesoamerican ballgame and pulque having extremely important parts. This led to the building of many pyramids with temples and seventeen ballcourts, more than any other Mesoamerican site. The city began to have extensive influence starting around this time, which can be best seen at the neighboring site of Yohualichan, whose buildings show the kinds of niches that define El Tajin. Evidence of the city&#x27;s influence can be seen along the Veracruz Gulf coast to the Maya region and into the high plateau of central Mexico.

At the end of the Classic period, El Tajín survived the widespread social collapse, migrations and destruction that forced the abandonment of many population centers at the end of this period. El Tajín reached its peak after the fall of Teotihuacan, and conserved many cultural traits inherited from that civilization. It reached its apogee in the Epi-Classic (900-1100 CE) before suffering destruction and the encroachment of the jungle.

El Tajín prospered until the early years of the 13th century, when it was destroyed by fire, presumably started by an invading force believed to be the Chichimecs. The Totonacs established the nearby settlement of Papantla after the fall of El Tajín. El Tajín was left to the jungle and remained covered and silent for over 500 years. While the city had been completely covered by jungle from its demise until the 19th century, it is unlikely that knowledge of the place was completely lost to the native peoples. Archeological evidence shows that a village existed here at the time the Spanish arrived and the area has always been considered sacred by the Totonacs. However, there are no records by any Europeans about the place prior to the late 18th century.

==History of its rediscovery==
In 1785, an official by the name of Diego Ruiz stumbled upon the Pyramid of the Niches, whilst looking for clandestine tobacco plantings breaching the royal monopoly in this isolated area rarely visited by the authorities. He made a drawing of the pyramid and reported his find to a publication called Gaceta de Mexico. He claimed the natives had kept the place secret. The publication of the pyramid&#x27;s existence in the Gaceta influenced academic circles in New Spain and Europe, attracting the attention of antiquarians José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez and Ciriaco Gonazlez Carvajal, who wrote about it. It also gained the interest of several academics, who compared the pyramid with the constructions of ancient Rome. The pyramid was further advertised by Italian Pietro Márquez in Europe and by Alexander von Humboldt.
Since its discovery by Europeans, the site has attracted visitors for two centuries. German architect Charles Nebel visited the site in 1831 and was the first to graphically and narratively detail the Pyramid of the Niches as well as the nearby ruins of Mapilca and Tuzapan. He was also the first to speculate that the pyramid was part of a larger city. His drawings and descriptions were published in a book named &quot;Voyage pittoresque et archéologique&quot; published in Paris in 1836.

The first archeologists reached the site in the early 20th century and included Teobert Maler, Edward Seler, Francisco del Paso y Troncoso and Herbert and Ellen Spinden. With the discovery of oil in the area came roads that were built and improved from the 1920s to the 1940s. This allowed for more intensive investigation of the area. In 1935–1938, the first formal mapping, clearing and exploration was done by Agustin Garcia Vega. The first building to be completely cleared of jungle growth was the Pyramid of the Niches. He eventually cleared , uncovering more buildings and proposed that it be called &quot;The Archeological City of El Tajín.&quot; Starting from 1938, excavation and reconstruction work was sponsored by INAH and headed by Jose Garcia Payon, uncovering platforms, ballcourts and part of Tajín Chico with its palaces. He continued to explore the site for 39 years until his death in 1977 despite the challenges of working in the jungle and the lack of funds. By this time, he had uncovered most of the major buildings and established that Tajín was one of the most important cities of ancient Mexico. By the 1970s, the site was one of the few in Veracruz state that attracted significant numbers of tourists. From 1984 to 1994, Jürgen K. Brüggemann built on the work of García Payón, uncovering 35 more buildings. It is believed that only half of El Tajin archeological site has been uncovered.

==World Heritage Site==

El Tajín was inscribed as a World Heritage Site in 1992, because of its historical significance and architecture and engineering. “Its architecture, which is unique in Mesoamerica, is characterized by elaborate carved reliefs on the columns and frieze. The &#x27;Pyramid of the Niches&#x27;, a masterpiece of ancient Mexican and American architecture, reveals the astronomical and symbolic significance of the buildings.” The site is one of the most important in Mexico and the most important in the state of Veracruz.

Its significance is due to its size and unique forms of art and architecture. The borders of the city&#x27;s residential areas have not yet been defined but is the entire site is estimated at . To date, only about fifty percent of the city&#x27;s buildings has been excavated, revealing a series of plazas, palaces, and administrative buildings within a two-square-mile area. Unlike the highly rigid grid patterns of ancient cities in the central highlands of Mexico, the builders of El Tajin designed and aligned buildings as individual units.
There are several architectural features here which are unique to the place or seen in only rarely in Mesoamerica. Adornment in the form of niches and stepped frets are omnipresent, decorating even utilitarian buttresses and platform walls. Stepped frets are seen in other parts of Mesoamerica but rarely to this extent. The use of niches is unique to El Tajin.

One notable aspect of the construction at El Tajin is the use of poured cement in forms. Surviving roof fragments from Building C in the Tajín Chico section is an example of cement roof constructions. Due to the lack of beams or other materials to prop it up, this roof had to be very thick to support itself. To lighten the load and to bind the layers of cement, pumice stones and pottery shards were mixed into the cement. The cement could not be poured all at once but rather in successive layers. It has been suggested that the buildings were filled with earth to support the roof as it was being poured and dried. The finished roofs were nearly a meter thick and almost perfectly flat. While this kind of cement roof is common in modern times, it was unique in the Mesoamerican world. Impressions of baskets, tamale wrappers and other items have been found in the dried cement. The poured cement was used in the only building with two floors at the site, Building B, as a roof and as a separator between the ground and upper floor. The only other known example of two story construction is in the Mayan territories. Another feature shared only with the Mayans is the use of a light blue paint. (wikerson45) Another feature unique to El Tajin is that a number of the residences have windows placed to allow cool breezes to enter on hot days.

While ballcourts are common in Mesoamerica, El Tajin distinguishes itself by having seventeen. Two of these ballcourts contain sculpted panels which depict the ball game and its ritual significance. The most impressive of these panels are on the South Ballcourt which contain images of underworld deities and a ballplayer being decapitated in order to approach the gods and ask for pulque for his people.

Since becoming a World Heritage Site, research and conservation efforts have been made to promote knowledge of and protect the site. There have been a number of research projects as well as reconstruction projects and projects to make more of the site accessible to visitors. However, the director states that more needs to be done to conserve the site, especially its fragile murals, and to balance the needs of tourists against the need to conserve the site in general. Each year since 1992, the number of visitors to the site increases which now stands at 653,000 annually.

Air pollution from oil-drilling platforms and power stations along the coast causes high levels of acid rain in the region, which is eroding the intricately carved reliefs on the soft limestone buildings “at an alarming rate”, according to Humberto Bravo of the University of Mexico&#x27;s Center for Atmospheric Sciences in 2007.

== Major monuments ==

===The entrance and site museum===
The entrance to the site is located at the south end. In being named a World Heritage Site in 1992, new facilities have been added to this area, such as a cafeteria, information services, a park and administrative offices. The site museum is also located here. In addition, the &quot;Danza de los Voladores&quot; is enacted at the entrance to the site and is considered a requirement for visitors. The voladores appear every half-hour at the pole and circle erected just outside the main gate.

The park is named Parque Takilhsukut and is located about one km outside the site proper. It is a modern facility with the aim of being a center of Veracruz indigenous identity. It covers 17 hectares with a capacity of 40,000 people. It hosts fairs, conventions and other events, including part of the annual Cumbre Tajín cultural festival which is held in March. There are also facilities for workshops, exhibitions, alternative therapies, seminars and ceremonies.

The site museum is divided into two parts: an enclosed building and a roofed area covering large stone sculpture fragments. The enclosed room is for smaller objects that have been found during the years the site has been explored, most coming from the Pyramid of the Niches. One of the most interesting objects on display is an altar from Building 4. It is a large stone slab sculpted to depict four individuals standing in pairs with a figure of intertwined snakes between the two pairs. The snakes represent the ball game marker called the tlaxmalacatle in Aztec times. The main exhibits of the roofed area are the fragments recovered from the Building of the Columns, with a number partially reassembled. One tells the story of 13 Rabbit, a ruler of El Tajin who probably had the building constructed. The scene shows as dual procession with 13 Rabbit seated on a wooden throne and his feet on a severed head. In front is a sacrifice victim with his entrails slung over a frame. 13 Rabbit&#x27;s name glyph appears above as well as an attendant named 4 Axe. The rest of the procession consists of warriors holding captives by their hair.

===Arroyo Group===

This is called the Arroyo Group because two streams surround it on three sides. This area is one of the oldest sections of the city, and is more than . It is flanked by four high buildings, named Buildings 16, 18, 19 and 20, which were topped by temples. Stairways lead from the plaza floor to the temples above. Unlike the rest of the city, these four buildings are uniform in height and nearly symmetrical. The pyramids here are primitive in comparison to the rest of the site, with niches that are not as finely formed. The east and west pyramids of the arroyo group each held three temples at the top. Another unusual feature is that this plaza has no smaller structures such as buildings or altars to break up the space. It has been determined that this was the city marketplace because of the large plaza space for stalls and for a deity found here that is related to commerce. The merchant deity found here has features more in common with this kind of deity in the central highlands of Mexico than of Tajín. The market that filled this plaza consisted of stalls made with sticks and cloth offering regional products such as vanilla as well as products from other parts of Mesoamerica such as jaguar skins, exotic birds such as the parrot and the macaw and quetzal feathers. Slaves for service and sacrifice were also sold here. West of the building on the south side is a large ball court with sloped sides and sculpted friezes depicting the god Quetzalcoatl. When the city fell, most of the sculptures in this area were smashed or defaced with some being reused as building stone.

===The Pyramid of the Niches===

This pyramid has as a number of names, including El Tajín, Pyramid of Papantla, Pyramid of the Seven Stories and the Temple of the Niches. It has become the focus of the site because of its unusual design and good state of preservation. It was prominent in ancient times as well. A large quantity of sculpture was recovered from this pyramid. The building is mostly constructed of carefully cut and crafted flagstones, the largest of which is estimated to be about eight metric tons in weight. The stones, especially around the niches are fitted together as to need a minimum amount of lime and earth mortar. The structure originally was covered in stucco which served as the base for paint.

The pyramid has seven stories. Each of these consists of a sloping base wall called a talud and a vertical wall called a tablero, which was fairly common in Mesoamerica. What is unusual about this construction and others in the city are the addition of decorative niches with the top capped by what Jose Garcia Payon called a &quot;flying cornice&quot;, a triangular overhang. The stones are arranged in controlled lines and delicate proportions. Originally the structure was painted a dark red with the niches in black intended to deepen the shadows of the recessed niches. Niches are also found underneath the stairway along the east face, which indicates that the stairway was a later addition. The niches on the original structure, not counting those on the later stairway, total 365, the solar year. At the top of the pyramid there were tablets framed by grotesque serpent-dragons.

The ritual function of the building is not primarily calendaric. The deep niches imitate caves, which long have been considered to be passageways to the underworld, where many of the gods reside. Caves, especially those with springs, have been considered sacred in much of Mexico with offerings of flowers and candles being traditional. As late as the mid 20th century, remains of beeswax candles could still be found left on the first level of this pyramid. There is a popular belief that each niche contained an idol or effigy but archeological work here has ruled this out. The most important part of the structure was the temple that was on top of this pyramid; however, this was completely destroyed and little is known about what it might have looked like.

Sculpture from the temple is largely fragmentary. The larger tablets have depictions of the rain god, or a ruler dressed as the deity, involved in several ritual or mythological scenes. This seems to have been the most important god of the culture as other depictions are found in other places at the site. His appearance here underlies the significance of this pyramid. The stairway to the temple is adorned on the sides with frets, which are called &quot;xicalcoliuhqui&quot;. It is thought to symbolize lightning and while it is common in Mesoamerica, it is a very prominent motif here. These frets were probably painted blue as they were on other buildings, where remains of paint have been found. At the top of the stairway were probably two large three-dimensional stelae. One has survived mostly intact and is now in the site museum. Off the stairs and leading east from the pyramid are large round stone with holes in the middle, in which were probably placed banners. The interior of the pyramid is rocks and earth. This fill is strained between the sloping walls which become the taluds of each level of the pyramid. Buried under all of this is a smaller stricter with taluds but no niches.

The pyramid is flanked by two smaller structures named Building 2 and Building 4. Both are small temple-like platforms. Building 4 contains a smaller, older structure inside it that may be among the earliest structures at the site.

===Tajin Chico===
Tajin Chico is a multilevel portion of the site that stretches north-northwest from the older parts of the city up a hill. Much of this section was created by using massive amounts of landfill. It is an immense acropolis composed of numerous palaces and other civil structures. There are relatively few temples here. It is also more easily defended than other parts of the city. Tajin Chico is so named because it was initially thought to be a separate but related site. It is now known that it belonged to the center of the city. However, as the term was already in the literature about the site, it has stuck.

Building C was not a temple but its function is not entirely clear. Nearby buildings A and B were palaces. It is probably that this building was used by priests or rulers to receive visitors, petitioners and others. The roof of Building C was more than in size and covered two rooms on the west side as well as main room which opened to the east through five piers. The entire exterior of the building is covered in stepped frets, with these frets arranged to give the appearance as niches. To further this effect, the inside of the frets were painted dark red and the exterior portion light blue, similar to turquoise. The broad eastern stairway was also painted with cloud-like scroll motifs.

Building B is a two-story structure that was used as a residence and classified as a palace. Like other structures nearby, its roof is a thick slab of cement and there is another slab that separates the ground and upper floors. The entrance to the building from the plaza was through a divided stairway, leading to a single room in size. This space is broken by six stone and cement pillars which support the floor above. These columns were thickened over time as it became apparent to have stronger bracing for the weight of the two floors. The upper story is reached by narrow stairway. This floor is more spacious even though there are columns here as well. This is the only multistoried palace found outside the Mayan areas.

Building A has two levels, stepped frets and niches and is reminiscent of structures found in the Yucatán. However, the lower level of the building is not rooms but a solid base. The lower level is adorned with large rectangular panels which appear to have been painted red. The entrance is on the south side of the building and is quite elaborate. The upper level contains a corridor that goes all the way around and a number of rooms. The upper level was adorned with stepped frets and scrolls as well. These were painted yellow, blue, red and black. The panels inside were painted with murals, of which only fragments survive. At the east and west side of the corridors are entrances to the rooms, two interconnected rooms on each side of the building. Building A is constructed over older buildings that were buried when this area was filled in, some aspects of the building, like the buttresses been damage due to settling where there are no buildings below. The facade depicts a false stairway and balustrades of stepped frets capped by niches. It is unknown if the similarity between this building and the Pyramid of the Niches indicates a relationship between the two. The false stairs were originally adorned with scroll motifs done in blue and yellow paint, but very little remains. At the center of the false stairway are true stairs leading upwards under an arch to the first level of the palace.

The Building of the Columns dominates the highest portion of Tajin Chico. It is part of one of the last building complexes built at El Tajín. These buildings are situated on a platform-terrace with was formed on natural contours and filled in spaces. The other structure on this platform is called the Annex or the Building of the Tunnels, as it is connected to the Building of the Columns by a passageway. Behind these buildings is a large plaza with small low structures on its edges. This building is named for the columns that adorned the east facade of the structure. The columns were made by stacking circles cut from flagstone. Then the surface of the columns was sculpted with scenes celebrating a ruler named 13 Rabbit, who probably had this structure built. Most of the remains of these columns are on display at the site museum. This structure also had a cement roof, which was arched in the “porch” area between the columns and the inner rooms. There is an inner courtyard and ornately decorated, with stepped frets, other symbols in stone and cement which were painted. This complex was one of the last to be built and it also shows evidence of fire and other damage from the fall of the city.

Just east of Tajin Chico is an area of valley floor. There are numerous buildings in this section but many are not accessible to visitors due to the lack of trails and many have yet to be explored. Two have been partially explored. The first is the Great Xicalcoluihqui, or the Great Enclosure. This is a wall, which from above forms a giant stepped fret and encloses about . This structure is unique among Mesoamerican sites and contains two or three small ballcourts. The sides of the enclosure are formed by a slender platform with sloping sides and free standing niches, resembling the Pyramid of the Niches. There are more than a hundred niches in this wall, broken up by a number of entrances. The other structure is the Great Ballcourt, the largest court at El Tajin. It is located at the northwest corner of the Great Xicalcoluihqui and at the base of Tajin Chico. It has vertical sides and is about long. Unlike other ballccourts, there are no carved panels and no sculptures have been associated with this structure.

===Buildings 3, 23, 15 and 5===

Building 3 or the Blue Temple has some features that set it apart from other pyramids at the site. Except for six benches on the staircase and at the top of the balustrades, probably later additions, there are no niches. The seven stories of the pyramid are composed of gently sloping walling divided into panels of varying widths. The unreconstructed north side has a large indentation made by looters before the site was protected by guards. No sculpture is known to have come from this building and nothing of the temple at the top remains. The building was covered in cement several times over its history, and each layer of this cement was painted in blue rather than the more common red. Remnants of this paint can be seen on part of the stairway and on the side facing east toward Building 23. Blue is most often associated with the rain god but there is no other evidence to support this.

While the Blue Temple was a fairly early construction, the pyramid next to it, Building 23 was built very late in Tajin&#x27;s history. It consists of five stories in near vertical talud without niches. The original staircase was destroyed then reworked into its present form. The divider in the center is a buttress to hold the fill behind the stairs in place. The stairs are made from a mixture of lime, sand and clay without a stone core. The interior of the building is composed of loose stone, mostly rounded river boulders. At the top, there the temple was located, is a series of stepped merlons which look like medieval European battlements.

Just south of Buildings 3 and 23 is Building 15, which is only partially excavated. It faces west and appears to have a civil function much like Building C in Tajín Chico. It has stairways on both the east and west sides that lead to the top of the second level. The third story begins with a wall of niches and no visible stairs. The two lower levels are adorned with larger niches as is the top of the stairway divider. Beneath the larger niches is a line of seven panels. Under the fourth panel, an older panel was found. Deeper excavation found an older, damaged structure which was covered over by the visible structure. This building is thought to be the last built with niches.

Building 5 is considered to be the stateliest of the El Tajin site. While located next to the Pyramid of the Niches, its visual appeal is not lost to its more famous neighbor. It is located in the center of a pyramid complex and consists of a truncated pyramid rising from a platform that is over in size. Access to the first level of the pyramid, which is lined with niches, is via a single staircase on the west side or a double staircase on the east side. Access to the top of the pyramid, where the temple once stood, is via a double staircase on the east side. The top of the pyramid contains two platforms, both of which are decorated with stepped frets. Between the two sets of staircases on the first level on the east side is a tall column-line sculpture. It had been thrown down from the top of the pyramid in ancient times and broken. Archeologists reassembled it at the spot in which it was found. The sculpture is similar in style to the carved stone yokes of Veracruz. The figure seems to be an allegorical representation of a seated figure with a severed upper torso and a skull for a head. The arms are holding a serpent like form and the body contains scrolls, which may signify sacrificial blood. The small buildings that surround this pyramid are meant to complement it. However, the one on the northeast side has been completely destroyed due to centuries-old trail that was used when this area was still jungle.

===The North and South Ballcourts===

The North Ballcourt is constructed by three layers of large flagstones. There are six carved panels with ritual scenes and an ornamental frieze that runs along both walls. The court is long, which is considered to be unusually small and has vertical rather than sloping walls. It is probably one of the oldest structures at Tajín.

Portions of the panels and friezes are worn to the point that large areas are incomplete. The four end panels have scenes relating to the ritual of the ball game that result in entreaties to the gods. The central panels depict the gods responding or performing a ritual of their own. Variant forms of the god of pulque appear over each of the end panels, suggesting that the drink was an important part of the ritual. The southeast, east and northwest panels show a ruler on a throne. The southwest panel has a figure dressed as an eagle seated in a vat of liquid, probably pulque, and being fed by a female figure on the left and a male on the right. The deteriorated north central panel shows two cross-legged figures facing each other. One is seated on a throne and the other by a pulque vat. In the center are two intertwined serpents which seem to form the shape of a tlaxmalactl or ball game marker. The friezes running along the upper edges of the court are composed of interlocking scroll figures, each containing a central element of a head and an eye. Many have feathered headdresses and reptilian attributes and a few are human like.
The South Ballcourt, like the North Ball court, has only vertical walls which are sculpted. The sculpted panels on these walls remain largely intact and show in step-by-step fashion how the ball game was played here, complete with ceremonies, sacrifice and the response of the gods. The court has a general east-west alignment and is long and wide. Spectators could watch events from Building 5 to the north and Building 6 to the south as well as from stands built on one side of the court. The court is made of stones of up to ten tons in weight many of which came from outside the valley. Once the court walls were built six panels were sculpted at the corners and centers of the two walls. The panels on the ends show scenes from the ballgame itself and the center panels show responses from the gods.

The southeast panel illustrates the opening ritual when the principal participant is elaborately dressed and is being handed a bundle of spears. This is part of an initial activity before the game itself starts. Overlooking this scene is the death deity who rises from a vat of liquid, perhaps pulque. The glyphs above the deity identify it with the planet Venus. Next is the southwest panel in which a different ceremonial preparation is depicted. The principal participant is supine on a kind of a sofa. Two musicians are playing a turtle shell drum and clay rattles. A figure dressed as an eagle dances in front while a skeletal deity flies above and the death deity rises from liquid. The northwest panel shows the beginning of the ballgame. Two participants are standing in the center of the court with speech scrolls emerging from their mouths. One holds a large knife in his left hand and gestures with his right. Between them are intertwined slashes, the symbol of the ballgame and a ball. At their waists are the protective and ritual accoutrements which are very similar to the stone yokes, palmas and hachas common in elite burials. Behind the players are two figures, one with a deer head, who are watching from the court walls as well as the death deity again above. The northeast panel indicates that the game has been played and one of the participants is about to be sacrificed by having his head cut off. The three figures are all dressed in the garments and symbols of the ballgame. The center figure has his arms held back by the one on the left. The figure on the right holds a large knife which is at the center figure&#x27;s neck. There are scrolls indicating speech from the sacrifice as well as a depiction of the skeletal god.

After this point, the panels deal with the response of the gods. The north central panel represents the continuation of the ritual in the afterlife, and shows how the events of the game connect the society of El Tajin to the gods. At the center of the scene is a temple with the rain and wind gods seated on top and a vat of liquid within. The sacrificed player appears here, whole and with a pot under his arm. He points to the vat and addresses the rain god. The liquid is protected by a reclining chacmool, who is speaking. What is being requested is pulque, indicated by a glyph indicating the mythical origin of the drink and a split image of the god of pulque above the scene. On the south central panel is depicting a scene after the sacrificed ball player has received the pulque with the same temple, glyphs and depiction of the pulque god. The differences are a depiction of the moon as a rabbit, the rain god in front of the temple and the level of the liquid in the vat lowered. The rain god is shown in a rite of auto sacrifice running a spike through part of his penis. The blood falls into the vat and to refill it with pulque.

==The Cumbre Tajín event==
The Cumbre Tajín is an annual artistic and cultural festival which is held at the site in March. The Cumbre Tajín is considered to be an identity festival of the Totonacs, who are considered to be the guardians of El Tajín. Events include those traditional to the Totonac culture as well as modern arts and events from cultures from as far as Tibet. Some of the events include musical concerts, experiencing a &quot;temazcal&quot;, theatrical events and visiting El Tajín at night, with a total over 5,000 activities. Many of the cultural, craft and gastronomic events occur at the adjacent Parque Takilhsukut which just located just outside the archeological site. In 2008, 160,000 attended the event which featured Fito Páez, Ximena Sariñana and Los Tigres del Norte. Thirty percent of the revenue the event generates goes toward scholarships for Totonaca youth.

In 2009, the event added the Encuentro Internacional de Voladores (International Encounter of Voladores). For five days, voladores from various places perform at the poles erected at the site. The objective is not only to see the different costumes and styles of the groups but to share experiences about the fertility ritual. Voladores come from as far as San Luis Potosi and Guatemala.

The Cumbre Tajín has been criticized for its emphasis on modern shows rather than on cultural events. One criticism is the illumination of pyramids at night without any kind of cultural historical instruction. The criticism is that it disrespects the site and the Totonac people. There are also fears that large numbers of visitors to the site for events such as concerts by names such as Alejandra Guzmán damage the site. However, the Centro de Artes Indígenas de Veracruz states that it works very hard to preserve and promote Totonac culture through the event, sponsoring events such as traditional cooking, painting and the ritual of the Voladores.

<doc id="355052" wikidata="Q1910161" url="?curid=355052" title="ZANU–PF">
<text>The Zimbabwe African National Union – Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF) is a political organisation which has been the ruling party of Zimbabwe since independence in 1980. The party was led for many years by Robert Mugabe, first as prime minister with the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) and then as president from 1987 after the merger with the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU) and retaining the name ZANU–PF, until 2017, when he was removed as leader.

At the 2008 parliamentary election, the ZANU–PF lost sole control of parliament for the first time in party history and brokered a difficult power-sharing deal with the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai (MDC). ZANU-PF then won the 2013 election, gaining a two-thirds majority. The party narrowly held their super-majority in the 2018 election.

On 19 November 2017, following a coup d&#x27;état, ZANU–PF sacked Robert Mugabe as party leader, who resigned two days later, and appointed former Vice President Emmerson Mnangagwa in his place.

==History==

=== Predecessors (1955–1963) ===
The first militant African nationalist organisation in Southern Rhodesia was the City Youth League (CYL), formed in the colony&#x27;s capital, Salisbury, in August 1955 by James Chikerema, Dunduzu Chisiza, George Nyandoro, and Edson Sithole. On 12 September 1957, the CYL merged with the long-established but largely dormant Southern Rhodesia chapter of the African National Congress to form the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress (SRANC). The new organisation adopted the CYL&#x27;s principle of &quot;one man, one vote&quot; and elected Joshua Nkomo as its president. The SRANC, which demanded African majority rule, gained substantial support across the country, but was banned by the Southern Rhodesian government in February 1959. In turn, on 1 January 1960, the National Democratic Party (NDP) was formed. The NDP advocated a similarly militant platform, and was similarly banned in December 1961. In the same month, Nkomo formed the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union, which shared the same aims and tactics of its predecessor organisations. In September 1962, amid growing unrest in Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s major towns, ZAPU was banned and many of its leaders detained. The colony&#x27;s Unlawful Organisations Act was also amended in an attempt to prevent ZAPU from being reconstituted with a different name.

===Formation (1963)===
African nationalist politics in Rhodesia in the 1960s were characterised by internal rivalries and disputes over strategy. Divisions within ZAPU came to a head in April 1963 when Nkomo called a meeting of the party&#x27;s executive in Dar es Salaam, where he had gone after ZAPU was banned in late 1962. The main criticisms of Nkomo were directed against his initial support of Southern Rhodesia&#x27;s 1961 constitution (a position he later reversed), his extensive foreign travel in pursuit of international support for the movement, and his handling of the formation of a government in exile in Tanganyika. According to Nkomo, he had received permission to form a government in exile, but by the time the rest of ZAPU&#x27;s leadership arrived in Dar es Salaam, he had changed his mind and was opposed the idea. Other accounts describe a split between Nkomo, who preferred an externally-based movement, and others—including Enoch Dumbutshena and Ndabaningi Sithole—who favoured an internal struggle and pressured Nkomo to return to Rhodesia. President Julius Nyerere told the assembled ZAPU leaders that neither he nor other African heads of state supported the idea of a government in exile and that &quot;victory&quot; could only be achieved within Rhodesia.

Nkomo returned to Salisbury on 2 July 1963, after which a majority of the party executive that had remained in Dar es Salaam voted to remove him as president of ZAPU. In response, Nkomo suspended the various &quot;rebels&quot;, including Sithole and Robert Mugabe, from the party. Unable to outmaneuver Nkomo within ZAPU, his opponents decided to create their own organisation. On 8 August 1963, Sithole, Herbert Chitepo, Leopold Takawira, Edgar Tekere, Henry Hamadziripi, and Mukudzei Midzi gathered at the Highfield home of Enos Nkala to form the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU).

In response to ZANU&#x27;s formation, Nkomo called a mass meeting on 10 August 1963 at Cold Comfort Farm, a multiracial cooperative outside Salisbury, where he formed a new organisation, the People&#x27;s Caretaker Council (PCP), to replace ZAPU, which was still banned. To preempt ZANU&#x27;s growth, Nkomo took steps to solidify his hold on the masses, replacing ZAPU&#x27;s existing centralised structure with a larger number of new, smaller branches. In the ZAPU–ZANU split, most of Nkomo&#x27;s longtime allies who had been with him since the SRANC&#x27;s formation in 1957—including Jason Moyo and George Nyandoro—stayed with ZAPU, while many nationalist leaders who had come to prominence in 1960 or later—like Sithole and Mugabe—joined the new party.

On 22 August 1963, Sithole held ZANU&#x27;s first press conference, telling reporters, &quot;When the party came to power it would repeal the Land Apportionment Act. It would also repeal the Land Husbandry Act and replace both by a new land redistribution law.&quot; In addition to land reform, Sithole pledged that &quot;A bill of rights would be entrenched in the constitution guaranteeing the rights and freedom of every citizen.&quot; Sithole told the reporters that ZANU was &quot;nonracial&quot; and would accommodate &quot;people who share a common destiny and democratic rule by the majority, regardless of race, colour, creed, or tribe.&quot; ZANU&#x27;s platform was quickly taken up by the press, and stood in contrast to ZAPU, which had not made public a comprehensive platform. ZAPU responded by attacking ZANU leaders&#x27; character and ideological bona fides.

Almost immediately following the split, violent clashes broke out between supporters of the rival parties in urban areas across the country. At one ZANU meeting in August 1963 in Highfield, 200 supporters required the protection of Rhodesian police to hold their event, while a &quot;milling pro-Nkomo mob of [a] thousand threatening death to the &#x27;sellouts&#x27;&quot; waited outside and stoned the cars of ZANU leaders Sithole and Nathan Shamuyarira as they left. Nkomo&#x27;s support was even stronger in the African townships of Harare and Mufakose. The day after the meeting, Sithole &quot;acknowledged [a] miscalculation of Nkomo&#x27;s mass strength.&quot; In Bulawayo, two houses were bombed with Molotov cocktails, and on 17 August, three policemen were injured by a stone-throwing mob of Nkomo supporters. By 14 August, both Sithole and Nkomo were calling for an end the violence in the African press, to little effect. Nkomo blamed the violence on ZANU supporters, arguing that his followers were using &quot;self-defence against a group of power-hungry people who have failed to gain public support.&quot; Sithole likewise claimed that his supporters were not the instigators, stating that he had &quot;a group of well-disciplined officials who can control the youngsters.&quot;

Despite facing initial backlash, ZANU did gain a following, and found particularly strong support in the eastern districts around Fort Victoria and Umtali. Meanwhile, ZAPU maintained an advantage in Bulawayo and Matabeleland, and in and around the capital, Salisbury. Though neither party&#x27;s leaders belonged exclusively to one ethnic group, the division arguably had an ethnic component, with ZAPU finding disproportionate support among the Ndebele people and ZANU drawing its base largely from the Shona people. Compared to ZAPU, ZANU branded itself as taking a more confrontational approach to white-minority rule, while portraying Nkomo as weak, indecisive, and insufficiently revolutionary. ZANU messaging downplayed ethnicity as a factor in the divisions within the nationalist movement, instead highlighting strategic and ideological differences. By contrast, Nkomo pointed to tribalism as the main cause of the ZAPU–ZANU split in his autobiography.

=== Bush War/Second Chimurenga (1964–1980) ===
ZANU held its inaugural party congress in the Mkoba suburb of Gwelo from 21–23 May 1964. There, Ndabaningi Sithole was elected as the party&#x27;s first president, Leopold Takawira as vice-president, Robert Mugabe as secretary-general, Herbert Chitepo as national chairman, and Enos Nkala as treasurer. In his presidential address, Sithole told the congress that ZANU &quot;stands for democracy, socialism, nationalism, one man/one vote, freedom, pan-Africanism, non-racism, and republicanism.

The Patriotic Front (PF) was formed as a political and military alliance between ZAPU and ZANU during the war against white minority rule in Rhodesia (now called Zimbabwe). The PF included the Soviet Union-backed ZAPU, which was led by Joshua Nkomo and operated mainly from Zambia, and the Chinese-backed ZANU led by Robert Mugabe, which operated mainly from neighboring Mozambique. Both movements contributed to their respective military forces. ZAPU&#x27;s military wing was known as the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ZIPRA) and ZANU&#x27;s guerrillas were known as the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army. The objective of the PF was to overthrow the predominantly white minority government, headed by the Prime Minister Ian Smith, through political pressure and military force.

===Post-independence===
Their common goal was achieved in 1980, following the Lancaster House Agreement of December 1979, when the United Kingdom granted independence to Zimbabwe following a brief period of direct British control. During the 1980 general election campaign, the PF parties competed separately as ZANU–Patriotic Front (ZANU–PF) and Patriotic Front–ZAPU (PF–ZAPU). The election was won by Mugabe and ZANU–PF, with Nkomo and his PF–ZAPU retaining a stronghold in the provinces of Matabeleland.

In December 1981, agents of South Africa&#x27;s apartheid government bombed party headquarters, nearly killing many senior ZANU–PF leaders, including Robert Mugabe.

In December 1987, after five years of the low-level civil war known as Gukurahundi, the opposition ZAPU, led by Nkomo, was absorbed through the Unity Accord with ZANU to form an official ZANU–PF.

From 1999 to 2017, Mugabe faced a major political challenge from the opposition Movement for Democratic Change. Mugabe won 56% at the presidential elections of 9–11 March 2002.

At the December 2004 five-year conference, Joice Mujuru, a Zezuru Shona like Mugabe, and whose late-husband Solomon Mujuru was the retired head of the armed forces, was elevated to the post of vice president of the party (the first woman to hold that office) at the expense of contender Emmerson Mnangagwa and his supporters; Justice Minister Patrick Chinamasa and Information Minister Jonathan Moyo.

The 2005 Zimbabwe parliamentary elections were held on 31 March 2005. The party won 59.6% of the popular vote and 78 out of 120 elected seats. Later that year, 26 November, it won 43 of 50 elected senators. The parliamentary election was disputed as being unfair. The leader of the opposition MDC party said, &quot;We are deeply disturbed by the fraudulent activities we have unearthed&quot;, and various human rights groups reported that hundreds of thousands of &quot;ghost voters&quot; had appeared on the electoral roll of 5.8 million people.

At the 2008 parliamentary election, the ZANU–PF lost its majority in parliament for the first time since independence, and held 94 seats out of the expanded 210 seats, with Sokwanele stating that this figure would have been lower had it not been for gerrymandering, electoral fraud, and widespread intimidation.

At the 2008 presidential election, Morgan Tsvangirai, the MDC candidate, received the most votes, but did not gain an absolute majority; thus a runoff was necessary. Initial results led to MDC-T claiming the required majority. However, ballots were recounted at a National Command Centre over a period of over a month without the presence of independent observers. The election process that followed was marred by more violence against and intimidation of voters and party workers. Morgan Tsvangirai initially stated he intended to contest the second round but pulled out of the runoff saying a free and fair election was impossible in the current climate. The elections were held on 27 June with a single candidate, Robert Mugabe, who was re-elected.

Many blame ZANU–PF for neglecting to deal with Zimbabwe&#x27;s problem with the mounting 2008 Zimbabwean cholera outbreak, which by the start of December 2008 had already killed between 500 and 3,000 people.

Former President of South Africa Thabo Mbeki facilitated, under the auspices of Southern African Development Community (SADC), a Zimbabwean Government of National Unity between ZANU–PF, the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai and the Movement for Democratic Change – Mutambara.

===Post-Mugabe transition===

In 2014, a battle between Vice President Joice Mujuru and Justice Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa, and possibly First Lady Grace Mugabe, began over the succession to President Robert Mugabe. An elective congress was scheduled for December 2014, in which ZANU–PF would elect members to fill vacancies in the central committee, politburo, and presidium, and most likely endorse the party&#x27;s next candidate for president. This congress, which takes place every five years, is the most important elective organ for the party.

Although President Mugabe had not named a successor, Joice Mujuru was seen by many as the most likely candidate. She had support from both the politburo and the population at large (demonstrated by the election of her loyalists to the youth league). Minister Emmerson Mnangagwa was supported by a smaller group composed mainly of senior members of the security establishment, part of ZANU–PF&#x27;s parliamentary caucus, younger party members, and a few influential parts of the Zimbabwean business community. He had been with Mugabe since Zimbabwe gained independence and was regarded by many as a successor who could maintain stability after Mugabe eventually left office.

Mujuru lost the succession battle with Mnangagwa after being expelled from the party in 2015 a new power struggle began between Mnangagwa&#x27;s faction (known as Team Lacoste) and Grace Mugabe&#x27;s faction (known as Generation 40 or G40) which had become violent by 2017. Emmerson Mnangagwa was demoted from Minister of Justice following a cabinet reshuffle, soon after he publicly claimed that he was poisoned, in early-October 2017. On 15 November 2017, a military coup in Zimbabwe resulted in President Robert Mugabe being placed under house arrest and led to speculation over whether Grace Mugabe or Emmerson Mnangagwa would succeed him as leader of the party. Following the 2017 Zimbabwe coup, ZANU–PF voted to depose Robert Mugabe as party leader and install the banished Emmerson Mnangagwa as leader instead. Before the Zimbabwean parliament could vote to impeach Mugabe, he resigned from the presidency on 21 November 2017. Mnangagwa was sworn in as the new President of the Republic of Zimbabwe on 24 November 2017.

On 6 September 2019, Robert Mugabe died of cancer (according to Mnangagwa) at the age of 95. He was succeeded as President by Emmerson Mnangagwa.

In the March 2022 by-elections, ZANU–PF had a poor performance compared to the Citizens Coalition for Change. ZANU–PF won the 2023 Zimbabwean general election.

==Ideology==
Officially, ZANU–PF has a leftist ideology. The party maintains a Politburo and a Central Committee.

===Land redistribution===

Mugabe pursued a more left-wing populist policy on the issue of land redistribution in 2000s, encouraging seizure of commercial farms—usually owned by Zimbabwe&#x27;s white minority—&quot;for the benefit of landless black majority&quot;. The inauguration speech of President Mnangagwa threw this program&#x27;s support into question since he said that the &quot;government is committed to work on a compensation plan for former land owners.&quot; The compulsory acquisition of commercial farmland without compensation was discontinued in early 2018. In 2018, Mnangagwa stated that &quot;all foreign investments will be safe in Zimbabwe&quot; and called for &quot;increased production and capacity and new investment in the country.&quot;

== Organisation and structure ==
The ZANU–PF constitution establishes a hierarchical party structure consisting of: (1) the National People&#x27;s Congress, (2) the National People&#x27;s Conference, (3) the Central Committee, (4) the National Consultative Assembly, (5) the National Assembly of the Women&#x27;s League, (6) the National Assembly of the Youth League, (7) the provincial coordinating committees, (8) the provincial executive councils, (9) the district committees, (10) the branch committees, and (11) the cell/village committees.

The current first secretary of ZANU–PF, reelected at the party&#x27;s elective congress on 28 October 2022, is President Emmerson Mnangagwa. The other three members of the party&#x27;s presidium, appointed by Mnangagwa on 29 October 2022, are Second Secretaries Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi, and National Chairperson Oppah Muchinguri.

The party maintains a Women&#x27;s League and Youth League. A third wing, the War Veterans&#x27; League, was established in 2022 and held its inaugural conference on 9 September of that year.

== International relations ==
ZANU–PF is a member of the Former Liberation Movements of Southern Africa, an association of six socialist political parties that were involved in the nationalist and anti-colonialist movements of Southern Africa. ZANU–PF was previously affiliated with the Socialist International (SI), having sent representatives with guest status to the SI congresses in 1980, 1992, and 1996, and was present at the Socialist International Africa Committee meeting in Maputo, Mozambique, as recently as 1999. ZANU–PF has not attended any SI congresses or meetings since, and Zimbabwe&#x27;s then-leading opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change – Tsvangirai, joined the SI in 2008. The Socialist International has condemned the actions of Zimbabwe&#x27;s ZANU–PF-dominated government and military.

<text>CAcert.org is a community-driven certificate authority that issues free X.509 public key certificates. CAcert.org relies heavily on automation and therefore issues only Domain-validated certificates (and not Extended validation or Organization Validation certificates).

These certificates can be used to digitally sign and encrypt email; encrypt code and documents; and to authenticate and authorize user connections to websites via TLS/SSL.

== CAcert Inc. Association ==
On 24 July 2003, Duane Groth incorporated CAcert Inc. as a non-profit association registered in New South Wales, Australia and after, in September 2024, moved to Europe in Geneva, Switzerland. CAcert Inc runs CAcert.org—a community-driven certificate authority.

In 2004, the Dutch Internet pioneer Teus Hagen became involved. He served as board member and, in 2008, as a president.

== Certificate Trust status ==
CAcert.org&#x27;s root certificates are not included in the most widely deployed certificate stores and has to be added by its customers. As of 2021, most browsers, email clients, and operating systems do not automatically trust certificates issued by CAcert. Thus, users receive an &quot;untrusted certificate&quot; warning upon trying to view a website providing X.509 certificate issued by CAcert, or view emails authenticated with CAcert certificates in Microsoft Outlook, Mozilla Thunderbird, etc. CAcert uses its own certificate on its website.

=== Web browsers ===

Discussion for inclusion of CAcert root certificate in Mozilla Application Suite and Mozilla Firefox started in 2004. Mozilla had no CA certificate policy at the time. Eventually, Mozilla developed a policy which required CAcert to improve their management system and conduct audits. In April 2007, CAcert formally withdrew its application for inclusion in the Mozilla root program. At the same time, the CA/Browser Forum was established to facilitate communication among browser vendors and Certificate Authorities. Mozilla&#x27;s advice was incorporated into &quot;baseline requirements&quot; used by most major browser vendors. Progress towards meeting these requirements can hardly be expected in the near future.

=== Operating systems ===
FreeBSD included CAcert&#x27;s root certificate but removed it in 2008, following Mozilla&#x27;s policy. In 2014, CAcert was removed from Ubuntu, Debian, and OpenBSD root stores. In 2018, CAcert was removed from Arch Linux.

As of Feb 2022, the following operating systems or distributions include the CAcert root certificate by default:
* Arch Linux
* FreeWRT
* Gentoo (app-misc/ca-certificates only when USE flag cacert is set, defaults OFF from version 20161102.3.27.2-r2 )
* GRML
* Knoppix
* Mandriva Linux
* MirOS BSD
* Openfire
* Privatix
* Replicant (Android)
As of 2021, the following operating systems or distributions have an optional package with the CAcert root certificate:
* Debian
* openSUSE

== Web of trust ==

To create higher-trust certificates, users can participate in a web of trust system whereby users physically meet and verify each other&#x27;s identities. CAcert maintains the number of assurance points for each account. Assurance points can be gained through various means, primarily by having one&#x27;s identity physically verified by users classified as &quot;Assurers&quot;.

Having more assurance points allows users more privileges such as writing a name in the certificate and longer expiration times on certificates. A user with at least 100 assurance points is a Prospective Assurer, and may—after passing an Assurer Challenge—verify other users; more assurance points allow the Assurer to assign more assurance points to others.

CAcert sponsors key signing parties, especially at big events such as CeBIT and FOSDEM.

As of 2021, CAcert&#x27;s web of trust has over 380,000 verified users.

== Root certificate descriptions ==
Since October 2005, CAcert offers Class 1 and Class 3 root certificates. Class 3 is a high-security subset of Class 1.

<text>Kilmarnock ( ; ; , ), meaning &quot;the church of Mernóc&quot;, is a town and former burgh in East Ayrshire situated in southwest Scotland. The town has served as the administrative centre of East Ayrshire Council since 1996 and is the region&#x27;s main commercial and industrial centre. The town has a total of 284 listed buildings and structures as designed by Historic Environment Scotland, including the Dick Institute, Dean Castle, Loanhead School and the original 1898 building of Kilmarnock Academy, with post–war developments of the controversial 1970s regeneration such as The Foregate and Clydesdale Bank building being considered for listed building status. 

The first passenger conveying railway in Scotland originated in Kilmarnock in 1812 as a horse-drawn plateway and became known as the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway. The first printed collection of works by Scottish poet Robert Burns was published in 1786 in Kilmarnock. &quot;Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect&quot;, was published by John Wilson, and became known as the &quot;Kilmarnock Edition&quot;. The internationally best–selling whisky Johnnie Walker was established in the town in the 19th century and was produced and bottled at the Hill Street plant until closure in 2012, following an announcement by owners Diageo in 2009 that the plant would close as part of company restructuring.

The town grew considerably during the 1870s and the town&#x27;s growth subsumed the village of Bonnyton, and by the 1960s, new purpose built suburbs such as New Farm Loch were constructed to accommodate the increasing population of Kilmarnock. By mid–2020, the population of the town was estimated to be 46,970, making Kilmarnock the 14th most populated settlement in Scotland as well as the largest town in Ayrshire by population.

==Etymology==

The name Kilmarnock comes from the Gaelic &quot;cill&quot; (&quot;cell&quot;), and the name of Saint Marnock or Mernoc who is also remembered in the name of Portmarnock in Ireland and Inchmarnock. It may come from the three Gaelic elements &quot;mo&quot;, &#x27;my&#x27;, &quot;Ernán&quot; (name of the saint) and the diminutive &quot;ag&quot;, giving &quot;Church of My Little Ernán&quot;. According to tradition, the saint founded a church there in the 7th century. The name Kilmarnock literally means &quot;Marnock&#x27;s Church&quot;. There are 12 Church of Scotland congregations in the town, plus other denominations. In 2005, the Reverend David W. Lacy, minister of the town&#x27;s Henderson Church, was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland.

== History ==
===Origins===

The town&#x27;s precise origins are largely unclear, however, it is believed that a community was established between the fifth–seventh centuries at the Laigh Kirk Church by a Saint Marnock. The earliest known mention of the town was in the 14th century, with Clan Boyd coming to prominence in the area during that time, building the Keep of the Dean Castle. The Romans held a &quot;tentative grip&quot; on the area in and around Kilmarnock, with forts nearby at Loudoun Castle as well as possessing costal harbours around Ayrshire. Early references to the town are vague in regards to population numbers and the geographical size of the town, however, it is widely believed that at this time, the town was little more than a small cluster of dwellings situated around the Laigh Kirk church.

By the end of the sixteenth century, Kilmarnock had become a burgh of barony, and had a weekly market stall and by the 1600s had grown into a small network of narrow streets, with the population relying on industries such as spinning wool, knitting bonnets and the manufacturing of metal cutlery to make a living. A fire engulfed the town in 1668, following the hunting of Covenanters by government troops.

The core of the early town appears to have lain around what is now the Laigh Kirk, Kilmarnock (Low Church), although the oldest parts of the current building are no earlier than the 17th century, extending north and northwest. In 1668 the town was largely destroyed by an accidental fire. About 120 families lost most of their possessions and were forced to live destitute in the fields surrounding the town. These tradespeople had no other way of making a living and had already been driven to the edge of poverty by having troops stationed with them as part of the anti-Covenanter measures. Parish churches throughout Scotland collected money for the relief of these homeless citizens.

===Burgh of Barony, 1592===
In 1592, King James VI of Scotland granted a charter to Thomas, Lord Boyd, erecting Kilmarnock into a burgh of barony. The charter confirms that the Boyd family to be in possession of the land of Kilmarnock and assures any future line of succession. At the beginning of the 16th century, Kilmarnock was described as &quot;a large village and of great repair&quot; with nearby Kilmaurs notably larger than Kilmarnock. However, over the course of the next one hundred years, the expansion of Kilmarnock was evident. Its expansion led to Kilmarnock becoming larger than Kilmaurs and becoming Ayrshire&#x27;s largest inland centre and challenging the supremacy of the royal burghs of Ayr and Irvine. During the 19th century, due to the growing rate of expansion due to the industrial expansion, Kilmarnock&#x27;s population growth increased significantly from 6,000 in 1800, 21,000 in 1851 and 35,000 by 1901.

In the early nineteenth century, Kilmarnock was developed considerably, with the town improvement committee creating plans to improve the road network around the town as they considered the narrow streets that had been in place at the time to be a hindrance for potential trade and development. Plans for new grid-based streets were developed following the consideration of the town improvement committee which resulted in thoroughfares through King Street, Titchfield Street, John Finnie Street and surrounding roadways. The full planned course of the development were never fully completed, resulting in many of the towns older streets and lanes within the new grid-based developments, including Bank Street, Croft Street and Nelson Street not being redeveloped. The refurbished streets were lined with commercial properties, and John Finnie Street is considered one of the most complete examples of Victorian architecture in Scotland.

Although never granted the title of royal burgh, largely due to its geography as an inland settlement with no port to enhance trade at sea, Kilmarnock, as a parliamentary burgh was ranked as equal to other nearby royal burghs such as Ayr and Irvine. Its close proximity to Troon and its harbour helped Kilmarnock&#x27;s trade and economy and its reputation of a strong and important burgh despite its inland position. Goods such as coal were frequently transported from Kilmarnock to Troon for export, and by 1812 a new railway line between Kilmarnock and Troon was constructed to allow trade to flow from the town much easier. The line opened in 1812, and was the first railway in Scotland to obtain an authorising Act of Parliament; it would soon also become the first railway in Scotland to use a steam locomotive; the first to carry passengers; and the River Irvine bridge, &quot;Laigh Milton Viaduct&quot;, is the earliest railway viaduct in Scotland. It was a plateway, using L-shaped iron plates as rails, to carry wagons with flangeless wheels. In 1841, when more modern railways had developed throughout the West of Scotland, the line was converted from a plateway to a railway and realigned in places. The line became part of the Glasgow and South Western Railway system. Much of the original route is part of the present-day Kilmarnock to Barassie railway line, although the extremities of the original line have been lost.

When elected county councils were created in 1890 under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1889, the burgh of Kilmarnock was deemed capable of running its own affairs and so was excluded from the jurisdiction of Ayrshire County Council. Further local government reform in 1930 brought the burgh within the area controlled by Ayrshire County Council, but classed as a large burgh, which allowed the town to continue to run many local services itself. Kilmarnock Town Council was based at the Town Hall at 28 King Street, which was built in 1805 and demolished in the 1970s.

===Early growth===

The growth of Kilmarnock in population and geographical area swallowed up the old separate village communities
of Beansburn, Bonnyton, and Riccarton. This led to such communities and villages around the town losing their identities due to the process of rehousing people who were dispersed to the new housing schemes. These large new housing areas lacked adequate shopping and recreational facilities, and most of them were not within convenient walking distance of the old town centre. Despite the growth in population of Kilmarnock, the town did not grow in terms of proportion, and construction of new building took place mostly on &quot;gap sites&quot;, the construction of houses at Robertson Place by the Kilmarnock Building Company, being an exception.

This expansion led to the town becoming a major centre in the west of Scotland. By 1856, Kilmarnock was widely regarded as a key railway location when the Glasgow and South Western Railway re-located their workshops from Cook Street in Glasgow to Bonnyton. Homes were constructed for the workers of the Glasgow &amp; South Western Railway Company at Bonnyton Square and at other areas in Bonnyton. These houses were later demolished in 1966 and 1967.

===Industrial revolution===
A comparatively modest settlement until the Industrial Revolution, Kilmarnock extended considerably from around 1800 onwards, requiring the opening of King Street, Portland Street, and Wellington Street. Added later was John Finnie Street, which is regarded as &quot;one of the finest Victorian planned streets in Scotland.&quot; The Sandbed Street Bridge is the oldest known surviving bridge in the area.

During the 19th century, the traditional cottage crafts in the town which had been &quot;around for generations&quot;, expanded and grew into major industries. A number of Kilmarnock industries established both national and international reputations, such as leather makers who were sought to make items such as belts, saddles and other leather goods. Boots and shoes began to dominate the leather making industry in the town, and by 1837, local shoemakers were making in excess of 2,400 pairs of shoes and boots. In 1840, George Clark&#x27;s shoe making company, established and based in the town, began exporting shoes to Brazil, using the merchant venture system which was created to allow producers to make use of any spare space on cargo ships. It is widely believed that Clark used cargo ships mostly carrying Kilmarnock whisky exports, and as a result, both Kilmarnock whisky and shoe made products became widely popular in Brazil. The shoe production business continued to grow, and by 1900, Clark&#x27;s shoe business, Saxone, had a total of 40 shop premises in Brazil.

Additionally, Kilmarnock gained a reputation of being a location for quality carpet making, following Charlotte Maria Gardiner, half auntie of the 4th Earl of Kilmarnock, bringing a number of carpet makers from Dalkeith to Kilmarnock. BMK Carpets was founded in Kilmarnock in 1908, quickly earning a reputation for the top carpet manufacturer of choice for major venues. It remained Kilmarnock&#x27;s main employer until closure in 2005. Glenfield and Kennedy became the largest company of hydraulic engineers in the British Empire. All three companies – BMK Carpets, Saxone Shoes and Glenfield and Kennedy, became widely known and trusted in export markets internationally. Johnnie Walker whisky, established as a grocery shop in 1820, was transformed into a global whisky brand, and is the world&#x27;s best selling brand of whisky. The Titchfield Street drill hall was completed in 1914.

===World War efforts===

The Kilmarnock War Memorial was constructed in temple style and completed in 1927, becoming dedicated to local men who died &quot;for king and country&quot; during World War I. Following World War II, more plaques were added to the war memorial to commemorate local men who died during World War II, and later, plaques to commemorate those who fought in the Korean War were added.The first post–war housing scheme in Kilmarnock, at Shortlees, was completed by the 1960s, followed by Bellfield by the end of the decade.

Following the second World War, many of the towns factories and production sites had to be transformed into meeting civil needs, rather than those needs of the military, as had been expected during the war effort. A considerable effort began to construct &quot;homes for heroes&quot; in Kilmarnock following World War II, taking &quot;years, even decades, to complete&quot;. New companies opened in Kilmarnock by the late 1940s and early 1950s, such as Glacier Metal Massey–Harris. The first post–war housing scheme in Kilmarnock, at Shortlees, was completed by the 1960s, followed by Bellfield by the end of the decade.

During World War II, a local battalion of the Home Guard was established in the town to protect the area during the war. The Kilmarnock Guard was known as the 4th North Kyle Home Guard, with men from Kilmarnock, Galston, Newmilns, Darvel, Hurlford, Fenwick and Craigie part of the battalion. The battalion was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel D.M. Wilkie, with F. Richmond Paton as second in command, and Major Hugh B. Farrar as adjutant.

Kilmarnock based carpet manufacturing company BMK ceased production of carpets for a time during the second world war to manufacture bomb shells for the war effort. Glenfild &amp; Kennedy, also based in the town, made components for anti-tank guns among other war-related engineering projects, including valves for mulberry harbours. Local mansions around the town were requisitioned, such as Bellfield House, with many becoming operational bases for training Special Air Services personnel. Kilmarnock Swimming Baths were also used for this purpose. The town&#x27;s prominent cooling towers were painted in camouflage to prevent them being visible to the German Luftwaffe.

The town suffered one air raid attack by the Luftwaffe, which killed four people on 6 May 1943. The Luftwaffe dropped a total of fourteen bombs in a line, from South Dean Farm to Kilmarnock cemetery. A 50 kg bomb landed on a block of four residential houses in the towns Culzean Crescent, killing four residents; Janet MacGeachie, Alice MacGeachie, John Bissett and Dorothy Armour.

===Post–war===
====Expansion and housing====
In 1945 an attempt by the Burgh Council of Kilmarnock to cope with increasing traffic was made by removing the statue of Sir James Shaw and re-developing the Cross into a roundabout. In 1976, a one-way traffic system was introduced around the town centre which is still in use today as of December 2023, however, that same month, it was confirmed that studies were being conducted which would see the town centre converted back to a two way street for traffic. Considerable growth of the town occurred in the second half of the 19th century, and following World War I, major efforts began to construct new homes to be &quot;fit for heroes&quot;. New residential and commercial streets around the town were created, with large housing schemes being built in the years which followed the end of World War II. The first new housing estate in Kilmarnock following World War II would become Shortlees, followed by the Grange Estate, Bellfield and Onthank during the 1960s. During this period, the priority continued to be on the construction of council housing, however, there was still a demand for houses in the private market, and with that, the construction of the Grange Estate would push the boundary of Kilmarnock&#x27;s built up area.

Despite the new housing estates at Shortlees, Bellfield, Grange and Onthank, housing demand continued to be strong, and the construction of additional housing estates continued through the late 1960s and early 1970s. Mass housing construction to create the New Farm Loch estate aimed to meet the increased demands of the towns population by providing additional space for homes as well as vehicles. More land was allocated than in previous house building projects to meet these demands. A 1923 Act of Parliament granted the construction of new homes at Scott Roads Fulton&#x27;s Lane, Townholm and Landmark. Additional acts of Parliament in 1924 and 1925 allowed the commencement of construction of additional homes at Annanhill, Ayr Road, Bonnyton, Craigie Road, Granger Road, London Road, Longpark, New Mill Road, New Street, Stoneyhill Avenue and Yorke Place. By 1973, an outer-town bypass was formed to take away the heavy through traffic that had been travelling in and throughout the town. In 1974, the Foregate pedestrianised shopping area was opened, to be followed by a new bus station, a multistorey car park, a civic centre, and a re-shaped central precinct for the town.

====Economic====
The textile and manufacturing sectors across Scotland suffered significant decline in the post-war period and in particular from the 1960s, in the face of greater foreign competition. Kilmarnock was no exception, with the closure or significant reduction of many of its traditional large employers: Glenfield and Kennedy, Massey Ferguson, BMK and Saxone. Although significant attempts have been made to halt this decline and attract new employers, Kilmarnock saw a continuing net loss of jobs in the five years to 2005. 

Although traditionally a main shopping area for most of the surrounding districts, patterns have changed over the last 20 years; traditional centres such as Ayr have been joined by new developments at Braehead and East Kilbride. This difficult economic climate is most visible in the town centre, the eastern part of which has been extensively redeveloped, with important historic buildings such as King Street Church and the town hall being demolished and Duke Street (the link from Kilmarnock Cross to the Palace Theatre and out to the London Road) built over.

====Regeneration====
During the late 1960s and into the 1970s, Kilmarnock, predominately the town centre, underwent an extensive programme of regeneration which would see a number of historic structures particularly on King Street demolished to make way for new buildings as part of redevelopment plans. In 1966, the Kilmarnock Town Council appointed Edinburgh based firm Percy Johnson-Marshall to examine ways forward to combat increased traffic and land usage within the town centre. Amongst the plans were the construction of seven multi-storey carparks for shoppers to the town centre, however, only one of these were ever constructed. The multi-storey began being demolished in 2024 following structural concerns.

Other plans produced by the firm would see large sections of John Finnie Street, West George Street and several houses on Dundonald Road demolished to accommodate land for the projects. Additionally, the Newton area of the town was proposed to be demolished entirely, with residents to be offered new housing in the New Farm Loch estate which at that time was still be constructed. Such plans never materialised, instead, the town council approved Phase 1 of plans presented by Percy Johnson-Marshall which would see the eastern side and surroundings of both Portland Street and King Street to be demolished to create land for new developments. Duke Street and Waterloo Street were demolished entirely, after a developer had assessed them both as being &quot;obsolete&quot;. The town council purchased properties to demolish through a process of negotiation and ultimately Compulsory Purchase Orders in order to progress with redevelopment plans. 

Small and independent private traders were forcibly relocated from both Waterloo Street and Duke Street, with The Foregate, a new shopping area constructed as part of the regeneration plans to relocate such traders. Plans for The Foregate also included a high-rise hotel and a cinema, however, both proposals were later shelved, with the Kilmarnock Centre (now the Burns Shopping Centre) constructed instead. The Foregate was constructed in a style which saw extensive brick-built commercial developments including offices over shops with canted projecting plate-glass windows. 

The Clydesdale Bank building located at the top of The Foregate is considered an &quot;individual brutalist piece of architecture. The building is now occupied by a Virgin Money bank&quot; and has been described as &quot;one of the most vibrant and forceful Scottish bank buildings of the post war era&quot;.

Phases 2 and 3 of the regeneration project never materialised as a result of economic strains.

===Administrative centre, 1996===
In 1996 the two-tier system of regions and districts was abolished and Ayrshire was divided between the unitary council areas of East Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Kilmarnock &amp; Loudoun District and Cumnock &amp; Doon Valley District), North Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Cunninghame District Council) and South Ayrshire (covering the area of the former Kyle and Carrick District).

Following this, Kilmarnock now came under East Ayrshire Council which was formed in April 1995 to replace the Kilmarnock and Loudoun and Cumnock and Doon Valley District Councils, and the part of Strathclyde Regional Council which related to the area. The newly formed East Ayrshire Council were granted responsibility for areas such as education, social work, leisure and planning, among other services, for Kilmarnock and the wider East Ayrshire geographical area.

Kilmarnock became the administrative centre for the newly formed East Ayrshire Council, with the council purchasing the former James Hamilton Academy building on London Road for £1. The building was refurbished and has since been the meeting place for elected councillors, the cabinet of East Ayrshire Council and is the main seat for the Chief Executive of East Ayrshire Council, the provost of East Ayrshire and Depute Provost of East Ayrshire

===Recent history===

In 2004, the &quot;Rough Guide to Scotland&quot; described the town as &quot;shabby and depressed, saddled with some terrible shopping centres and a grim one-way system&quot;. In early 2006, an application to Historic Scotland&#x27;s Conservation Area Regeneration Scheme was successful, and in July 2006 an application under the Heritage Lottery Fund&#x27;s Townscape Heritage Initiative Scheme was pending, allowing work to be finished on a quality housing development on the site of the former Kilmarnock Infirmary, north of the town centre, which was completed by local property development company The KLIN Group. With a journey time of 20 minutes from Kilmarnock to Glasgow, the M77 motorway received an extensive upgrade in 2005 to accommodate Kilmarnock&#x27;s emerging status as a commuter town. As a result, new quality housing has been constructed on the northern fringes of the town for commuters to Glasgow and the central belt of Scotland. Recent house price in and around Kilmarnock have reflected the towns location for commuters to the country&#x27;s largest city.

In 2015, Kilmarnock was named &#x27;Scotland&#x27;s Most Improved Town&#x27; at the Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum awards. The panel recognised the improvements made to the town centre of Kilmarnock due to a £43 million investment, and local authority intervention to restore derelict buildings including the former Johnnie Walker bond building and the Opera House. In April 2018, East Ayrshire Council published a plan to protect and enhance the towns historic and listed buildings. Structures such as the former ABC cinema (previously the King&#x27;s Theatre) on Titchfield Street has lay derelict since the opening of the Odeon cinema at Queens Drive. Buildings such as this are considered to be irreplaceable listed buildings. East Ayrshire Council has committed to regenerating the town, with buildings such as the former Opera House on John Finnie Street which was destroyed by fire in the late 1980s, being reconstructed with its original facade retained and is now office space for East Ayrshire Council.

The end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century is widely regarded as a &quot;boom period&quot; for housing construction in Kilmarnock. Large numbers of farm land was purchased by housing developers, with an &quot;unprecedented&quot; number of houses being completed, notably at Southcraig, Dunsmuir Park and the Johnnie Walker estate. The largest house building projects in Kilmarnock were undertaken at Southcraig and Dunsmuir Park.

==Governance==


Kilmarnock, as part of the Kilmarnock and Loudoun parliamentary constituency, had long been considered a &quot;safe seat&quot; for the Scottish Labour Party, having been represented by a Labour MP since the establishment of the constituency in 1983. However, at the 2015 general election, the seat changed hands from Labour to the Scottish National Party with the election of Alan Brown, at an election which resulted in a landslide victory for the SNP at the expense of Scottish Labour. Brown defeated Labour candidate Cathy Jamieson with an overwhelming majority with Brown receiving 30,000 votes with Jamieson only receiving 16,363. At the 2024 election, Scottish Labour regained the seat from the SNP, the first time they have gained the seat from the SNP since 2015, when Scottish Labour candidate Lillian Jones won the election with 19,055 votes with a majority of 5,119.

The member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for Kilmarnock is Willie Coffey, having represented the area as the MSP of the Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley constituency since 2007.

Following the 2017 East Ayrshire Council election, the SNP formed a minority government for East Ayrshire, following the result of a hung council. At present, the Scottish Labour party is the opposition in the East Ayrshire parliament with their leader, Maureen McKay alongside the Scottish Conservative Party, independent councillors and one councillor elected from local campaign group party, The Rubbish Party.

Kilmarnock is the administrative centre of East Ayrshire Council, with the council headquarters and debating chamber situated on the London Road. In local council elections, Kilmarnock comprises four wards: Kilmarnock North, Kilmarnock East and Hurlford, Kilmarnock West and Crosshouse, and Kilmarnock South. The current leader of East Ayrshire Council is Councillor Douglas Reid of the SNP, who has been leader since 2007. The chief executive is Eddie Fraser, who has been Chief Executive since 2020.

==Demography==

Kilmarnock is both the largest town in East Ayrshire and its administrative centre, and the largest town in Ayrshire by population. The town had an estimated population of 46,970 residents in 2020, making it the 14th largest settlement in Scotland.

At Scotland&#x27;s 2011 census, Kilmarnock had a recorded population of 46,159 inhabitants. The census data highlighted that 45,379 were white (with 42,915 identifying as White Scottish), 121 mixed or multiple ethnic groups, 548 Asian, Asian Scottish or Asian British, 148 Asian, Asian Scottish or Asian British: Indian, Indian Scottish or Indian British and 204 Asian, Asian Scottish or Asian British: Chinese, Chinese Scottish or Chinese British. Other ethnic groups included Asian, Asian Scottish or Asian British: Bangladeshi, Bangladeshi Scottish or Bangladeshi British and Caribbean or Black: Caribbean, Caribbean Scottish or Caribbean British.

At the 2011 census, 12,143 residents were aged over 16 and had no formal qualifications, while 8,983 residents had at least one qualification in Level 1, with 5,185, 4,044 and 7,339 having a qualification Level 2, Level 3 and Level 4 (or above) respectively. There were a total of over 20,000 households in Kilmarnock at the time of the 2011 census, ranging from semi–detached, detached, bungalows, flats and maisonette properties. The 2011 census of Scotland recorded a working population of 34,104 (16–74) in Kilmarnock, with 4,915 recorded part–time employees, 13,504 full–time, 1,978 self–employed, 2,156 un–employed and 1,094 full–time students.

By the 2021 census, the population of Kilmarnock had increased to 54,235 people, with 48.3% male and 51.7% female. 16.8% lived in the least deprived Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) decile, whilst 33.8% lived in the most deprived. In 2022, there were a total of 26,303 dwellings in Kilmarnock, an increase from 25,737 in 2014. By 2022, a total of 542 dwellings were unoccupied in the town, compared to 676 in 2014. The most common council tax banding in Kilmarnock was Band A, with 37.7% of properties placed in Tax Band A, whilst Tax Band B was the second most common with 21.7%. 

Life expectancy in Kilmarnock is estimated at 74.6 years for males and 79.1 years for females. The life expectancy rate for females is largely in line with both the East Ayrshire and national averages, whilst for males, life expectancy for males in Kilmarnock is slightly below the East Ayrshire average (74.8 years), and two years below the Scottish average for males (76.5 years).

== Economy ==

The economy of Kilmarnock had historically been centred around heavy manufacturing and goods based services. However, in recent years, and in trend with other towns and cities across Scotland, Kilmarnock&#x27;s economic dependence has shifted from manufacturing and instead become more reliant on skills-based knowledge. Companies such as Vodafone (Webhelp Call Centre) and Teleperformance occupy a large part of the Rowallan Business Park, which is also home to Food Partners, a nationwide sandwich franchise. Nowadays, the economy of Kilmarnock is largely based on public service and office work, with local property redevelopment and regeneration company, The KLIN Group occupies the former Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co offices in West Langland Street, Brodie Engineering operate two production factories for locomotives in the town centre and Utopia Computers also have their headquarters and main site situated in Kilmarnock in High Glencairn Street. Kilmarnock is also home to The HALO Urban Regeneration with a focus on digital learning, inspiration to innovative thinking and providing a conducive environment for spin-out, new-start, scale-ups, digital, manufacturing and cyber businesses. HALO is set to provide £205 million of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to the Economy of Scotland. The window and door company, Scotia have their main headquarters in Kilmarnock, as well as a manufacturing and production plant.

The internationally best–selling Scotch whisky brand Johnnie Walker was established in Kilmarnock in 1820 by John &#x27;Johnnie&#x27; Walker. Originally known as &quot;Walker&#x27;s Kilmarnock Whisky&quot;, the brand first started trading from the town in the mid-1800s. The whisky was originally produced, blended and bottled at the Johnnie Walker Bond building, known as &quot;The Bond&quot;, in the town centre. Operations continued from The Bond until September 1956 when a new, state of the art and sector leading production plant was opened at Hill Street in the town. At the time of opening in 1956, the Hill Street plant was the world&#x27;s largest bottling plant. In 2009, to much public backlash as well as backlash from the Scottish Government, First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond and local MP and MSP Cathy Jamieson and Willie Coffey, the owner of Johnnie Walker, Diageo, decided to close the bottling plant, originally by the end of 2011, ending the link between the whisky brand and the town. In September 2009, Diageo confirmed the plant in Kilmarnock would close, despite local protests. Production of Johnnie Walker in Kilmarnock ceased during March 2012, after 192 years. It is now made at a new Diageo bottling plant in the eastern coast of Scotland in Leven, Fife. Over the years, Kilmarnock has been the home to other well-known companies, Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co., and Saxone Shoes. Following the closure of the Hill Street plant, the building was demolished and the site is now home to both the Kilmarnock campus of Ayrshire College and The HALO Urban Regeneration.

Kilmarnock&#x27;s traditional industries were based around textiles and heavy engineering such as locomotives (Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co) from 1837, and valves (Glenfield and Kennedy), which are still in production. Glenfield and Kennedy is now trading as Glenfield Valves and still operates a base from Kilmarnock, and Andrew Barclay Sons &amp; Co. is now trading as Brodie Engineering. Blackwood&#x27;s (often known as Blackwood Brothers) produced woollen garments and yarns in Kilmarnock for a number of years, and in 1908, Robert Blackwood formed a partnership with Gavin Morton, establishing Blackwood and Morton of Kilmarnock, which better became known as BMK which specialised in the manufacturing of carpets. Blackwood and Morton of Kilmarnock (BMK) ceased production and closed in 2005, following the closure of Stoddard Carpets and at this time, Stoddard Carpets was the oldest carpet manufacturing company still in operation at that time in Scotland. Carpets manufactured in Kilmarnock were internationally known for their quality and intricacy since the late 19th century. Shoe making was a dominating industry during the height of Kilmarnock&#x27;s industrial strength, with both Clarks and Saxone Shoes producing shoes from warehouses within the town. The Saxone Shoe factory in Kilmarnock was the largest shoe production factory in operation in Scotland with a staff base of 1,000 employees at the plants peak. Saxone Shoes was bought by the British Sears group and became defunct when Sears sold it to Stylo.

Coal was mined within the vicinity of Kilmarnock, with former mines being located within the areas of Grange, Bonnyton and Portland. Quarrying took place at areas such as Dean, Holm and elsewhere, with clay works for bricks and tiles being produced in Gargieston. Clay was also made into sanitary ware at Hillhead, Longpark and Bonnyton, with the produced products being exported extensively from Kilmarnock. Garden produce relied on the establishment and operation of a number of nurseries within Kilmarnock, namely at Westmoor, Holmes, Burnside, New Park and New Pit, despite the towns heavy reliance on heavy industry for economic strength. Kilmarnock had one of the earliest tram railways in the world, running to Troon over the recently restored Laigh Milton viaduct. The Glasgow &amp; South Western Railway set up their works here, producing nearly 400 locomotives by the time it was absorbed by the London, Midland &amp; Scottish Railway in 1923. Some work continued, but heavy repairs were sent to St Rollox. Locomotive repairs finished in 1952, and the works closed in 1959. Nevertheless, locomotives are still made by Brodie Engineering, as well as the maintenance of existing diesel and electric multiple units. From 1949 self-propelled combine harvesters were built in Kilmarnock in a large Massey-Harris factory on the outskirts of the town. It later became Massey Ferguson, and closed in 1980. Glenfield and Kennedy still survives, albeit with a fraction of its former workforce, which at its height numbered in the thousands.

==Health care==

Kilmarnock is served by NHS Ayrshire and Arran, one of fourteen regions of NHS Scotland. NHS Ayrshire and Arran was formed in 2004, with Kilmarnock being served by NHS Ayrshire and Arran&#x27;s largest hospital, University Hospital Crosshouse, situated less than one mile outwith Kilmarnock between the town and neighbour village Crosshouse.

The town was previously served by the Kilmarnock Infirmary which opened in 1868 in Portland Street, to meet the growing population of the town. The original building was designed by the prolific Kilmarnock architect, William Atkinson Railton. The foundation stone was laid in September 1867 and the building opened in October 1868. A children&#x27;s block and a nurses&#x27; training school were added in 1891. In 1923 it had a capacity of 130 beds. With hospital services transferred to Crosshouse Hospital, the infirmary building and the accident and emergency building were demolished in the late 1980s. The listed nurses&#x27; home was demolished under a Dangerous Building Notice in September 1997.

Work on University Hospital Crosshouse, which was commissioned to replace the Kilmarnock Infirmary, began on the site in August 1972 with completion expected in May 1977. The contractor, Melville Dundas &amp; Whitson, encountered difficulties with the water supply and ventilation systems and the facility was only officially opened by George Younger, Secretary of State for Scotland, as Crosshouse Hospital in June 1984. Services provided at University Hospital Crosshouse include an Emergency Department covering both East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire, Maternity Unit (covering the whole of the Ayrshire region), paediatric inpatient services, a Combined Assessment Unit and Ayrshire Doctors on Call (ADOC).

A new maternity unit, which replaced a similar facility at Ayrshire Central Hospital in Irvine was opened in the grounds of the hospital in 2006. In March 2012, the hospital officially became University Hospital Crosshouse as a result of a partnership with the University of the West of Scotland.

Kirklandside Hospital, in neighbouring village Hurlford closed between 2018 and 2020. Kirklandside hospital provided consultant-led services for frail elderly patients. It had 25 long-stay beds for inpatient care and a day hospital which provided assessment and rehabilitation facilities. Kilmarnock is served by a number of general practice (GP) surgeries under NHS Scotland and a variety of other healthcare services including dental treatment and pharmacies.

== Transport ==

Until the 18th century, means of transportation in and around Kilmarnock relied on rough tracks which were narrow, twisting and, at times, impassable, to link the town with neighbouring settlements. The Ayrshire Turnpike Act 1767 was passed which allowed for the rough tracks to be expanded in width and improved by turnpike trusts who additionally held responsibility for the maintenance of roads. Following the 1767 act, numerous new and improved roads were completed in the town, such as roads linking Kilmarnock with Ayr, Irvine, Kilmaurs, Stewarton, Kingswell and Flockbridge. An additional act, the Ayrshire Turnpike Act 1774, named a total of 39 new roads for Ayrshire, and included several roads in and around Kilmarnock to link the town with Symington, Riccarton, Dundonald and Hurlford. Improved roads around the town had a positive effect on trade and business in Kilmarnock. By the start of the 19th century, William Bentinck, 4th Duke of Portland, wanted &quot;the best way&quot; to transport coal between Kilmarnock and the seaside settlement of Troon for onward shipping.

In 1812, the Kilmarnock and Troon Railway opened, the first railway in Scotland, mainly to carry coal from the area to the harbour at Troon, but also had a regular passenger service provided prior to the construction work being complete. In 1904, Kilmarnock built its own tramway system, the Kilmarnock Corporation Tramways. An electric power station was built on the south bank of the River Irvine at Riccarton and overhead power lines and tram lines were laid. With continued upgrading and expansion, the tram network at its peak went from Ayr Road in Riccarton at its southerly point, to Knockinlaw Road in Beansburn in the north. 

Today the town is served by Kilmarnock railway station, which operates services from the town to all major locations in Scotland connecting with Stranraer for the ferries to the Port of Belfast as well as Larne Harbour in Northern Ireland and as far as Carlisle and Newcastle in England. Despite an expensive upgrade to the railway station clock in 2008, it was announced in December 2022 following a full cabinet meeting of East Ayrshire Council that the station clock was to be removed and landscaped &quot;with immediate affect&quot; due to continuous technical difficulties preventing the clock and its LED lighting from working properly.

The town&#x27;s &quot;Transport Station&quot; for bus travel opened in 1923, and was among the first custom–built bus stations in Scotland. It remained the town&#x27;s main bus station until 1974 when it was replaced by a new bus station, which itself has been upgraded extensively through 2021–2024. Kilmarnock has road links to Glasgow through the M77 motorway from Fenwick to its junction with the M8 at the Kingston Bridge. A south side motorway connects this point to the M74 near Calderpark when the latest phase of development is complete, eliminating some of the heavy traffic formerly travelling on the A71 through Hurlford, Galston, Newmilns, Darvel and Strathaven to join the M74 at Stonehouse. 

Stagecoach Group is the main transport provider in the town; it operates bus services to most major towns in the west of Scotland. Kilmarnock has its own bus station. As an early market town, Kilmarnock lies on the intersection of 3 main roads: the A71 which runs from Edinburgh to Irvine, the A76 from Dumfries, and the A77/M77 from Stranraer to Glasgow.

Kilmarnock has no international airport, however, the town, as well as surrounding settlements in the area, is served by nearby Glasgow Prestwick Airport (14 mi).

== Education ==

Kilmarnock has ten primary schools, three secondary schools (Kilmarnock Academy, Grange Academy and Saint Josephs&#x27; Academy) and thirteen nursery schools. The schools are managed by East Ayrshire Council. Further education in the town is provided by Ayrshire College, previously known as Kilmarnock College and, prior to that, Kilmarnock Technical College.

The town&#x27;s oldest secondary school Kilmarnock Academy dates back to the 1600s. The school in its present-day serves as a comprehensive school, one of three in Kilmarnock. It can trace its history back to the local burgh school founded in the 1630s and the first school to bear the name was established in 1876. Kilmarnock Academy is one of a small number of schools in the United Kingdom, and was the first school in Scotland, to have educated two Nobel Prize Laureates – Sir Alexander Fleming, discoverer of Penicillin, and The 1st Baron Boyd-Orr, for his scientific research into nutrition and his work as the first Director-General of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Grange Academy in the Bonnyton area of the town, is one of only seven Scottish Football Association (SFA) Performance Schools.

Loanhead Primary School was founded as Loanhead Public School, and was erected between 1903 and 1905 to accommodate primary aged pupils in the eastern part of Kilmarnock. The foundation stone was laid by Andrew Carnegie on 29 August 1903 before opening to pupils in 1905, and the building is a Category B listed building by Historic Environment Scotland At a construction cost of £15,000, Loanhead Public School was to become the seventh primary school built by the Kilmarnock School Board, as before the introduction of the Education (Scotland) Act 1872, pupils were either educated by schools operated by churches, private individuals or parish councils. Loanhead Primary School underwent a multi-mullion pound programme of investment between 2020 and 2021 to modernise the building and include provision for early years education within the town centre area of Kilmarnock.

In the years that followed the establishment of Loanhead Primary School in 1905, due to the towns growth and expansion, new primary schools were opened, including Shortlees Primary School (1951), Mount Carmel Primary School (1965), Annanhill Primary School (1973), St Matthew&#x27;s Primary School (1973), Gargieston Primary School (1975), Bellfield Primary School and Whattriggs Primary School (2019). Other primary schools to have been established in Kilmarnock since Loanhead include Silverwood Primary School, Onthank Primary School, Hillhead Primary School and Kirkstyle Primary School. Their dates of establishment remain unclear.

== Culture ==

Kilmarnock boasts a large number of listed buildings. The Dick Institute, opened in April 1901, was severely damaged by fire only eight years after it opened. Some of the museums collections were lost in the fire. It reopened two years after the fire in 1911. The Dick Institute was used as an Auxiliary Hospital in 1917 during World War One. It is now shared by the Arts and Museums Service, and the Libraries, Registration and Information Service. The two Art Galleries and three Museum Galleries house permanent and temporary displays of Fine Art, Contemporary Art and Craft, Local and Industrial History and Natural Sciences. The Lending Library, Audio Library, Junior Library, Reference Library, and Learning Centre are all housed on the ground floor.

The first collection of work by Scottish poet Robert Burns, &quot;Poems, Chiefly in the Scottish Dialect&quot; was published in Kilmarnock on 31 July 1786. It was published at the current site of the Burn&#x27;s Mall, dedicated to his work. This edition is known as the &quot;Kilmarnock Edition&quot; or &quot;Kilmarnock Volume&quot;. To commemorate Burns&#x27; association with the town, a statue of Burns and John Wilson, publisher of the &quot;Kilmarnock Edition&quot;, was erected at The Cross in the town centre and was unveiled by Anne, Princess Royal on 27 September 1995. The Burns Monument in the towns Kay Park was opened on 9 August 1879 and contained a museum of artefacts. Designed by Robert Ingram, the monument cost an estimated £2,892 to build and contained a marble statue of Robert Burns which was designed by W. G. Stevenson, as well as a tower which features rooms that could be visited by the public. When closed for renovations, the monument suffered a severe fire on 20 November 2004, with much of the original structure collapsing. The monument was partially reconstructed and re-opened as the Burns Monument Centre.

The ancestors of William Wallace held the Barony of Ricarton, where the suburb of Riccarton is now located, and, according to local tradition, Wallace was born at Ellerslie near Kilmarnock. John Bowring, polyglot and fourth governor of Hong Kong, was Member of Parliament for Kilmarnock in 1835. In the castle of Kilmarnock, Dean Castle, there is an exhibition of armour and weapons, and the Van Raalte collection of musical instruments.

In 2010, BBC Scotland filmed residents on the town&#x27;s Onthank and Longpark area for the TV programme &quot;The Scheme&quot; which broadcast in 2010 for two episodes so far, out of a planned four. &quot;The Scheme&quot; caused much controversy within residents of the community, who believed that the BBC only showed the &quot;worst parts&quot;, leading to others believing that they were &quot;pretty much the same&quot;. The series has been the subject of media criticism, with the series being labelled as &quot;poverty porn&quot; and described as giving a &quot;misleading impression&quot; of life on the estate. The final two episodes of the series were never broadcast due to legal issues.

Scottish duo The Proclaimers titled a song &quot;The Joyful Kilmarnock Blues&quot; on their debut album, &quot;This Is the Story&quot;, released in 1987, as a reference to the town. Additionally, &quot;The Ballroom Blitz&quot; by the band The Sweet was inspired by an event at the town&#x27;s Grand Hall music venue, when, in 1973, the band were performing at the venue and were driven off the stage by a barrage of bottles thrown from the crowd. The song went onto achieve worldwide fame and success, reaching the top ten on both the UK Singles Charts and the Billboard Hot 100 singles charts, with many still talking about the concept behind the song. In October 2022, the town&#x27;s Grand Hall played host to the 2022 BBC New Comedy Award.

===Sports===

The town is host to Kilmarnock F.C., a member of the Scottish Premiership and the oldest professional football club in Scotland. The club is one of eight founding members of the Scottish Football Association in 1873. Although not able to send a representative to the meeting which established the association, Kilmarnock F.C. did send a letter of willingness to join, and did so in time to compete in the inaugural Scottish Cup tournament in 1873–74. Their 2–0 defeat against Renton in the first round on 18 October 1873 is thought to have been the first match ever played in the competition.

There are two golf courses in the town, Annanhill Golf Course and Caprington Golf Course, which has both an 18-hole course and a 9-hole course. Annanhill Golf Course is owned and operated by East Ayrshire Council, while Caprington is privately owned by a community group. The local leisure complexes include the Galleon Centre which features a 25-metre swimming pool, baby pool, ice rink, squash courts, sauna, gym, games hall, bar area and bowling green, as well as the Northwest Centre (formerly the Hunter Centre) which contains a community gym and various local medical facilities. The new Ayrshire Athletics Centre was constructed in the Queens Drive area which includes a 400m running track outside of the main building. The athletics arena was used as part of the 2014 Commonwealth Games as a pre–games training ground for athletes from across the Commonwealth of Nations.

One of the towns secondary schools, Grange Academy, is a Scottish Football Association (SFA) performance school. Only six other performance schools are established in Scotland – Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow and Motherwell.

=== Twin towns – sister cities===
Kilmarnock – as part of East Ayrshire Council – is twinned with five cities and has received awards from the Council of Europe for its work in twinning. 

* Alès, France; 
* Herstal, Belgium; 
* Joué-lès-Tours, France; 
* Kulmbach, Germany; 
* Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Spain. 
The former Kilmarnock and Loudoun District Council is also twinned with Sukhumi, Abkhazia (Russian-occupied Georgia) on the Black Sea coast. Following a review of links, this link is now considered as a friendship link.

<text>Ward Leon Christensen (October 23, 1945 – October 11, 2024) was an American computer scientist who was the inventor of the XMODEM file transfer protocol and a co-founder of the CBBS bulletin board, the first bulletin board system (BBS) ever brought online.

==Early life==
Ward Leon Christensen was born on October 23, 1945, in West Bend, Wisconsin, to Florence (née Hohmann) and Roy Christensen. His father was a safety director at West Bend Company and his mother sold World Book encyclopedias. Christensen also had a brother, Donald Christensen.

Christensen attended West Bend High School. In his senior year of high school in 1963, he created a computer that won first place in a science fair. After graduating high school, Christensen attended the University of Wisconsin–Madison before transferring to Milton College. He graduated from Milton College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and chemistry in 1968.

==Career==
Christensen, along with collaborator Randy Suess, members of the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists&#x27; Exchange (CACHE), started development of the first BBS during a blizzard in Chicago, Illinois, and officially established CBBS four weeks later, on February 16, 1978. CACHE members frequently shared programs and had long been discussing some form of file transfer, and the two used the downtime during the blizzard to implement it.

In 1968, Christensen was hired by IBM as a systems engineer in the sales office. Christensen would work for IBM until his retirement in 2012. His last position with IBM was a field technical sales specialist.

Christensen was noted for building software tools for his needs. He wrote a cassette-based operating system before floppy disks and hard disks were common. When he lost track of the source code for some programs, he wrote ReSource, an iterative disassembler for the Intel 8080, to help him regenerate the source code. In 1977, he wrote XMODEM, a protocol to send computer files over phone lines. Jerry Pournelle wrote in 1983 of a collection of CP/M public-domain software that &quot;probably 50 percent of the really good programs were written by Ward Christensen, a public benefactor.&quot; In May 2005, Christensen and Suess were both featured in &quot;&quot;. Christensen taught soldering techniques, until his death, through Build-a-Blinkie, a non-profit organization that hosts &quot;learn-to-solder&quot; events in the Great Lakes area.

== Personal life ==
Christensen lived in Dolton, Illinois when he invented XMODEM in 1977 and co-invented CBBS in 1978. Christensen died from a heart attack at his home in Rolling Meadows, Illinois, on October 11, 2024 at the age of 78. At the time of his death, he was in a relationship with Debra Adamson. He also left behind his brother, Donald, and his nieces, Carin and Dana Christensen.

== Awards ==
Christensen received two 1992 Dvorak Awards for Excellence in Telecommunications, one with Randy Suess for developing the first BBS, and a lifetime achievement award &quot;for outstanding contributions to PC telecommunications.&quot; In 1993, he received the Pioneer Award from the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

<doc id="355058" wikidata="Q179194" url="?curid=355058" title="Morbid Visions">
<text>Morbid Visions is the debut studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, released on November 10, 1986, by Cogumelo Records. While later albums have a more political edge, &quot;Morbid Visions&quot; (along with the 1985 EP &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot;) is notable for Satanic themes and imagery. The band said many lyrics were fashioned after those of early extreme metal bands such as Venom and Celtic Frost (note the similarity of the album title to &quot;Morbid Tales&quot;).

The production quality of the album is rather poor. In the liner notes of Roadrunner&#x27;s reissue of the album (which includes the tracks from &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot;), Cavalera admits that the band neglected to tune their guitars during the recording. They were only starting to learn English at this point, so they had to translate the lyrics word-for-word using a dictionary. All pre-1992 releases of &quot;Morbid Visions&quot; featured the first movement of Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot; (&quot;O Fortuna&quot;) as an unnamed introduction. This composition was left off the CD re-release, probably due to copyright issues. This would mark the last appearance of the group&#x27;s original lead guitarist Jairo Guedz.

The album, alongside &quot;Bestial Devastation&quot;, was re-recorded by Max and Igor Cavalera under the Cavalera Conspiracy name in 2023.

<doc id="355065" wikidata="Q937894" url="?curid=355065" title="Schizophrenia (Sepultura album)">
<text>Schizophrenia is the second studio album by Brazilian heavy metal band Sepultura, released on October 30, 1987 by Cogumelo Records. It is the first album for the band with Andreas Kisser. The album&#x27;s sound leans more towards the death/thrash metal genre than the previous album &quot;Morbid Visions&quot;, which is stylistically closer to black metal. All songs were recorded during August 1987. The reissue of 1990 has a bonus track &quot;Troops of Doom&quot; which was recorded during August 26–27, 1990.

In America the band sent radio playlists at the time when they were struggling to book gigs because club owners were afraid to book them due to their style. Roadrunner Records signed them and released &quot;Schizophrenia&quot; internationally before seeing the band perform in person.

The album was re-recorded by Cavalera, featuring original Sepultura members Max and Igor Cavalera, for release on 21 June 2024.

<doc id="355069" wikidata="Q142035" url="?curid=355069" title="Beaconsfield, Quebec">
<text>Beaconsfield is a suburb on the Island of Montreal, Quebec, Canada, part of the Greater Montreal region locally referred to as the West Island. It is a residential community located on the north shore of Lac Saint-Louis, bordered on the west by Baie-D&#x27;Urfé, north by Kirkland and east by Pointe-Claire.

Incorporated in 1910, named in honour of Benjamin Disraeli, Earl of Beaconsfield, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and close confidant of Queen Victoria, the city&#x27;s historical roots go back as far as 1698. Beaconsfield, in its current form, was developed as a cottage community by affluent Montreal residents. Over the decades, the city has transformed from summer homes, to year-round residents, and has flourished.

The population of Beaconsfield, as of the Canada 2021 Census, is 19,277. While the population is predominantly anglophone, 77% of residents speak both official languages of Canada. Most residents live in single-family homes, though there are residents of townhouses and apartment buildings.

==History==

In 1678, the Sulpician Order, who owned the Island of Montreal at the time, granted the first concession in this area to Jean Guenet, one of the main merchants of Ville-Marie and tax collector for the island&#x27;s Seigneurs. Guenet named his concession, located at Pointe Beaurepaire or Thompson Point but now known as Pointe à Quenet, &quot;Beau Repaire&quot;. Following the Great Peace of Montreal Treaty in 1701, permanent settlement began that led to farming communities along Lake Saint-Louis.

In 1713, the Parish of St-Joachim de la Pointe Claire was created, which included the present territory of the cities of Beaconsfield, Kirkland and Pointe-Claire.

In 1855, the Grand Trunk Railway was built through the area, and the Canadian Pacific Railway in the 1880s. These brought summer residents from Montreal and the pioneer farming settlement began to transform to a summer cottage resort.

The name Beaconsfield is first attributed to John Henry Menzies who in 1870 bought a country estate then known as &quot;Le Bocage&quot; (originally built by Paul Urgèle Gabriel Valois in 1810). He renamed it in 1877 after Benjamin Disraeli, 1st Earl of Beaconsfield, who was his friend. In time, this name was also used for its train station (which opened in 1879), golf club (opened in 1902), and the Post Office (opened in 1904).

The City (&quot;Ville&quot;) of Beaconsfield was formed on June 30, 1910, when it split off from the Parish of Saint-Joachim de la Pointe-Claire. In the census of 1911, it had 375 persons, 60 families living in 60 houses. It grew slowly to 990 inhabitants by 1951. During the 1950s and 1960s, Beaconsfield rapidly developed as a residential suburb. By 1966, the last original farm concession began to be developed for residences.

On March 19, 1966, Beaconsfield changed statutes from &quot;Ville&quot; to &quot;Cité&quot; (&quot;city&quot;), but on September 18, 1982, this was reverted.

As part of the 2002–2006 municipal reorganization of Montreal Beaconsfield and neighbouring Baie-D&#x27;Urfé became the borough of Beaconsfield–Baie-D&#x27;Urfé and were merged into the city of Montreal. After a change of government, and the 2004 referendum, both Baie-D&#x27;Urfé and Beaconsfield voted to de-merge from Montreal. On January 1, 2006, they were reconstituted as independent municipalities. They still remain part of the urban agglomeration of Montreal.

<text>Arise is a Swedish death metal/thrash metal-band from Alingsås. Their name is taken from the Sepultura album of the same name.

== History ==
Arise was founded in 1996 in Alingsås (outside of Gothenburg, Sweden) under another name, but got the name Arise in 1998 when their first demo was released. Their third demo, &quot;Abducted Intelligence&quot;, was recorded in Los Angered Recordings 2000 by Andy LaRoque, and became &quot;demo recording of the month&quot; in Swedish Close-Up Magazine. In 2001 the band was signed by Spinefarm Records and released their first full-length record, &quot;The Godly Work of Art&quot;. The same year, the band was nominated to the Swedish Rockbjörnen award. Their second studio album, &quot;Kings of the Cloned Generation&quot;, was released in 2003, and Spinefarm Records were bought by Universal Records during that time. Their third CD, &quot;The Beautiful New World&quot;, was recorded and released in 2005.

In December 2005 Patrik Skoglöw and Erik Ljungqvist parted ways with Daniel Bugno and L-G Jonasson due to &quot;musical differences.&quot; They were replaced by Patrik Johansson (vocals), Sternberg (guitars), and Kaj (bass guitar).
