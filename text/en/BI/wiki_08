<text>Didcot ( ) is a railway town and civil parish in South Oxfordshire, England, located south of Oxford, east of Wantage and north west of Reading. Historically part of Berkshire, the town is noted for its railway heritage, Didcot station opening as a junction station on the Great Western Main Line in 1844. 

Today the town is known for the railway museum and as the gateway town to the Science Vale: three large science and technology centres in the surrounding villages of Milton (Milton Park), Culham (Culham Science Centre) and Harwell (Harwell Science and Innovation Campus which includes the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory).

==History==

===Ancient and Medieval eras===
The area around present-day Didcot has been inhabited for at least 9,000 years. A large archaeological dig between 2010 and 2013 produced finds from the Mesolithic, Neolithic, Iron Age and Bronze Age. In the Roman era the inhabitants of the area tried to drain the marshland by digging ditches through what is now the Ladygrove area north of the town near Long Wittenham, evidence of which was found during surveying in 1994. A hoard of 126 gold Roman coins dating from about 160 was found just outside the village in 1995 by an enthusiast with a metal detector. It is now displayed at the Ashmolean Museum on loan from the British Museum.

The Domesday Book of 1086 does not record Didcot. In 13th-century records the toponym appears as &quot;Dudecota&quot;, &quot;Dudecote&quot;, &quot;Doudecote&quot;, &quot;Dudcote&quot; or &quot;Dudecothe&quot;. Some of these spellings continued into later centuries, and were joined by &quot;Dodecote&quot; from the 14th century onward, &quot;Dudcott&quot; from the 16th century onward and &quot;Didcott&quot; from the 17th century onward. It is derived from Old English, meaning the house or shelter of Dudda&#x27;s people. The name is believed to be derived from that of Dida, a 7th-century Mercian sub-king who ruled the area around Oxford and was the father of Saint Frithuswith or Frideswide, now the patron saint of both Oxford and Oxford University.
Didcot was then a rural Berkshire village, and it remained so for centuries, only occasionally appearing in records. If Didcot existed at the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, it will have been much smaller than several surrounding villages, including Harwell and Long Wittenham, that modern Didcot now dwarfs. The nearest settlement recorded in the Domesday Book was &quot;Wibalditone&quot;, with 21 inhabitants and a church, whose name possibly survives in Willington&#x27;s Farm on the edge of Didcot&#x27;s present-day Ladygrove Estate. The oldest parts of the Church of England parish church of All Saints go back to the 12th century. They include the walls of the nave and east wall of the chancel, which were built about 1160. The church is a Grade II* listed building.

===Early modern era and the coming of the railways===

Parts of the original village survive in the Lydalls Road area around All Saints&#x27; church. In the 16th-century Didcot was a small village of landowners, tenants and tradespeople with a population of about 120. The oldest surviving house in Didcot is White Cottage, a 16th-century timber-framed building in Manor Road that has a wood shingle roof. It is a Grade II listed building. At that time the village centre consisted of a group of cottages and surrounding farms around Manor, Foxhall and Lydalls Roads. Those still surviving include The Nook, Thorney Down Cottage and Manor Cottage, which were all built in the early to mid-17th century. Didcot village was on the route between London and Wantage (now Wantage Road), which in 1752 was made a toll road. Didcot had three toll gates that collected revenue for the turnpike trust until 1879, when the trust was dissolved due to the growing use of the railway.

====Great Western Railway====
The Great Western Railway, engineered by Isambard Kingdom Brunel, reached Didcot in 1839. In 1844 the Brunel-designed Didcot station was opened. The original station burnt down in the late 19th century. Although longer, a cheaper-to-build line to Bristol would have been through Abingdon farther north but the landowner, the first Lord Wantage, is reputed to have prevented that alignment. The railway and its junction to assisted the growth of Didcot. The station&#x27;s name helped to standardise the spelling &quot;Didcot&quot;.

====Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway====
Didcot&#x27;s junction of the routes to London, Bristol, Oxford and to Southampton via the Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway (DN&amp;S) made the town militarily important, especially during the First World War campaign on the Western Front and the Second World War preparations for D-Day. The DN&amp;S line has since closed, and the large Army and Royal Air Force ordnance depots have disappeared beneath the power station and Milton Park Business Park; however the 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Search Regiment RLC is still based at the Vauxhall Barracks in the town.

Remains of the DN&amp;S railway survive in the eastern part of town. This line, designed to provide a direct link to the south coast from the Midlands and the North avoiding the indirect and congested route &quot;via&quot; Reading and Basingstoke, was built in 1879–82 after previous proposals had failed. It was designed as a main line and was engineered by John Fowler and built by contractors TH Falkiner and Sir Thomas Tancred, who together also constructed the Forth Railway Bridge. It was a very costly line to build due to the heavy engineering challenges of crossing the Berkshire and Hampshire Downs with a 1 in 106 gradient to allow for higher mainline speeds, and this initial cost and the initially lower than expected traffic volumes caused the company financial problems. It never independently reached Southampton, but instead joined the main London and South Western Railway line at Shawford, south of Winchester.

In the Second World War there was so much military traffic to the port of Southampton that the line was upgraded. The northern section between Didcot and Newbury was made double track. It was closed for 5 months in 1942–43 for this to be done. Several of the bridges in the area of Didcot and the Hagbournes were also strengthened and rebuilt. Although passenger trains between Didcot and were withdrawn in 1962, the line continued to be used by freight trains for a further four years, and there was regular oil traffic to the north from the refinery at Fawley near Southampton. But in 1966 this traffic was also withdrawn, and then the line was dismantled. The last passenger train was a re-routed &quot;Pines Express&quot; in May 1964, diverted due to a derailment at . A section of the abandoned embankment towards Upton, now designated as a Sustrans route, has views across the town and countryside.

===21st century===
As at 2011, Didcot had a population of more than 26,000, and by 2021, the population had grown to more than 31,000. The new town centre, the Orchard Centre, was opened in August 2005. As part of the Science Vale Enterprise Zone, Didcot is surrounded by one of the largest scientific clusters in the United Kingdom. There are a number of major science and technology campuses nearby, including the Culham Science Centre, Harwell Science and Innovation Campus, and Milton Park. The Diamond Light Source synchrotron, based at the Harwell Campus, is the largest UK-funded scientific facility to be built for more than 30 years.
Didcot has been designated as one of the three major growth areas in Oxfordshire; the Ladygrove development, to the north and east of the railway line on the former marshland, is set to double the number of homes in the town since construction began in the late 1980s. Originally, the Ladygrove development was planned to be complete by 2001, but the plans for the final section to the east of Abingdon Road were only announced in 2006. Before the Ladygrove development was completed, a prolonged and contentious planning enquiry decided that a 3,300-home development would be built to the west of the town, partly overlapping the boundary with the Vale of White Horse. This is now known as Great Western Park.

In 2008 a new £8 million arts and entertainment centre, Cornerstone, was opened in the Orchard Centre. It has exhibition and studio spaces, a café and a 236-seat auditorium. Designed by Ellis William Architects, the centre is clad with silvered aluminium panels and has a window wall, used to connect the building with passing shoppers. The United Kingdom government named Didcot a garden town in 2015, the first existing town to gain this status, providing funding to support sustainable and environmentally friendly town development over the coming 15 years. In 2017, researchers named Didcot as the most &quot;normal&quot; town in England.

==Railways==

===Didcot Railway Centre===

Formed by the Great Western Society in 1967 to house its collection of Great Western Railway locomotives and rolling stock, housed in Didcot&#x27;s 1932-built Great Western engine shed. The Railway Centre is often used as period film set and has featured in works including &quot;Anna Karenina&quot;, &quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot; and &quot;The Elephant Man&quot;. The centre is north of Didcot Parkway railway station, and is accessed from the station via the pedestrian subway.

===Didcot Parkway station===
The station was originally called Didcot but then renamed in 1985 by British Rail; the site of the old GWR provender stores, which had been demolished in 1976 (the provender pond was kept to maintain the water table) was made into a large car park to attract passengers from the surrounding area. An improvement programme for the forecourt of the station began in September 2012. This was viewed as being the first phase of better connecting the station to Didcot town centre.

==Economy==

===Power stations===
Didcot A Power Station (between Didcot and Sutton Courtenay) which was commissioned in 1968, ceased generating electricity for the National Grid in March 2013. &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine once voted the power station the third worst eyesore in Britain. The power station cooling towers were visible from up to away because of their location, but were designed with visual impact in mind (six towers in two separated groups apart rather than a monolithic 3×2 block), much in the style of what is sometimes called Didcot&#x27;s &#x27;sister&#x27; station – Fiddlers Ferry Power Station – at Widnes, Cheshire, constructed slightly earlier. The power station had also proved a popular man-made object for local photographers.

In October 2010, Didcot Sewage Works became the first in the UK to produce biomethane gas supplied to the National Grid, for use in up to 200 homes in Oxfordshire. On Sunday 27 July 2014 three of the six cooling towers were demolished in the early hours of the morning, using of explosives. The demolition was streamed live by webcam. On Tuesday 23 February 2016, part of the boiler house building at the power station collapsed; one person was declared dead, five injured and three missing. All were believed to have been preparing the site for demolition. On Sunday 17 July 2016, what remained of the structure was demolished in a controlled explosion. The bodies of the three missing men were still in the remains at that time. A spokesman said that because of the instability of the structure, it had not been possible to recover the three bodies. For safety reasons, robots were used to place the explosive charges, and the site was demolished just after 6am. On Sunday 18 August 2019, the remaining three cooling towers were demolished at 7am.

===Motor Racing===

Didcot has a strong connection with motorsports and most notably the Williams Grand Prix Engineering team as Frank Williams founded the team there in a former carpet warehouse on Station Road in 1977. After establishing themselves in Formula One, the factory, now including a small &#x27;Williams Museum&#x27;, moved within Didcot to a new factory adjacent to the Didcot A Power Station site on Basil Hill Road. They stayed there until 1995 when they finally outgrew the site, moving to the former Jansen Pharmaceutical site in nearby Grove where they are still based today. After Williams Grand Prix Engineering&#x27;s departure, the site was used for the design and production of the BMW V12 LM and BMW V12 LMR sports prototype racing cars, a joint collaboration between Williams and BMW which would go on to win the 1999 24 Hours of Le Mans. During the 1990s Williams also ran their joint British Touring Car Championship effort with Renault; Williams Touring Car Engineering from a warehouse on Churchward on the Southmead Industrial Estate in Didcot. In 2012 a road through the new Great Western Park development in Didcot was named &quot;Sir Frank Williams Avenue&quot; in honour of Williams&#x27; contribution to the town.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, Rich&#x27;s Sidings in Didcot was home to Maxperenco, a racing car manufacturer run by Andrew Duncan who produced both Single-Seater Formula cars and GT Sports cars.

During the 1980s and 1990s the Southmead Industrial Estate in Didcot was also home to Nissan Motorsports&#x27; Europe headquarters where they raced Nissan Primera touring cars in the British Touring Car Championship. This would go on to become Team RJN who are still based on the Southmead Industrial Estate to this day.

More recently, Didcot is home to a Pirelli distribution and logistics centre which provides tyres for Formula One Grand Prix motor racing events across Europe. In 2015 the head offices of the Bloodhound SSC Land Speed Record attempt team were moved to the new University Technical College (UTC) Oxfordshire site on the boundary between Didcot and Harwell. In 2019 the team relocated to Berkeley Green Technical College in Gloucestershire.

===Agriculture===

Didcot is surrounded by farmland which has historically grown traditional British crops such as wheat and barley, sheep farming is also common in the area. The area is also noted for farmers growing opium poppies for legal production of morphine and heroin to meet National Health Service demand. The poppies produced are sold to Macfarlan Smith, a major pharmaceutical company, who hold a licence from the United Kingdom&#x27;s Home Office.

Didcot formerly had a dairy bottling factory and chicken farm in the town from 1935 to 1987, initially operated by Job&#x27;s Dairy and later after 1970, Express Dairy; the site employed a large number of local people. The dairy was located in the Northbourne area of the town, and was later redeveloped into a residential area around Western Avenue, next to the former Didcot, Newbury and Southampton Railway line, now a cycle path.

===Printing===
From 2007 until 2017, the Daily Mail &amp; General Trust had a printing plant in Didcot.

==Military==
The British Army&#x27;s Vauxhall Barracks is on the edge of town. The regimental headquarters of 11 Explosive Ordnance Disposal and Search Regiment RLC is based in the town.

==Governance==

There are three tiers of local government covering Didcot, at parish (town), district and county level: Didcot Town Council, South Oxfordshire District Council and Oxfordshire County Council. The town council has its offices at the Civic Hall on Britwell Road.

The town council comprises 21 councillors representing the five wards in the town:
*All Saints – 5 members
*Ladygrove – 6 members 
*Milbrook – 1 member 
*Northbourne and Orchard – 4 members 
*Park – 5 members
Meetings of the town council are chaired by the mayor. Mayors are elected by the councillors for a one-year term; the mayor has been Councillor Andrew Jones (All Saints ward).

Didcot is also the largest town in the parliamentary constituency of Didcot and Wantage, which has been represented since 2024 at Westminster by Olly Glover, Liberal Democrat.

===Administrative history===
Didcot was an ancient parish in Berkshire. When elected parish and district councils were created in 1894, Didcot was given a parish council and included in the Wallingford Rural District. The rural district council moved its offices from Wallingford to Didcot in the 1950s. Wallingford Rural District was abolished in 1974 and the area was transferred to Oxfordshire and the new district of South Oxfordshire, becoming the largest town in the new district. After 1974 parish councils were allowed to declare their parishes to be towns and take the style town council, as Didcot has done. The Civic Hall was built for the town council in 1979 and also serves as a venue for public events.

==Health==
The district in England with the highest healthy life expectancy, according to an Office for National Statistics (ONS) study, is the 1990s-built Ladygrove Estate in Didcot. While the average UK healthy lifespan was thought to be 68.8 for women and 67 for men in 2001, people in Ladygrove district of Didcot could expect 86 healthy years. It is believed Ladygrove may have benefited from the local recreation grounds and sports centre.

==Education==
Didcot is served by seven primary schools: All Saints&#x27; C of E, Aureus, Ladygrove Park, Manor, Northbourne C of E, Stephen Freeman and Willowcroft. Along with these seven schools based in Didcot, a further six local village schools form the Didcot Primary Partnership: Blewbury Endowed C of E, Cholsey, Hagbourne, Harwell Community, Long Wittenham C of E and South Moreton County. Didcot Primary Academy, opened in 2016 in the Great Western Park area, falls under Harwell Parish.

Two of Didcot&#x27;s state secondary schools; St Birinus School and Didcot Girls&#x27; School are single-sex schools that join at sixth form to host &quot;Didcot Sixth Form&quot;. There are two other secondary schools in Didcot which have opened alongside the construction of the Great Western Park estate; UTC Oxfordshire (ages 14–19), in 2015, and Aureus School (ages 11–16), in 2017.

Didcot&#x27;s synonymous connection with railways was noted in Douglas Adams and John Lloyd&#x27;s humorous book the &quot;Meaning of Liff&quot;, published in 1983. The book, a &quot;dictionary of things that there aren&#x27;t any words for yet&quot;, referred to &quot;a Didcot&quot; as &quot;The small, oddly shaped bit of card which a ticket inspector cuts out of a ticket with his clipper for no apparent reason&quot;.

<text>George Stephen Boolos (; September 4, 1940 – May 27, 1996) was an American philosopher and a mathematical logician who taught at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

== Life ==
Boolos was of Greek-Jewish descent (Boolos is an Arabic form of the name Paulus/Paûlos common among Arabic speaking Greek Orthodox community). He graduated with an A.B. in mathematics from Princeton University after completing a senior thesis, titled &quot;A simple proof of Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem&quot;, under the supervision of Raymond Smullyan. Oxford University awarded him the B.Phil. in 1963. In 1966, he obtained the first PhD in philosophy ever awarded by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, under the direction of Hilary Putnam. After teaching three years at Columbia University, he returned to MIT in 1969, where he spent the rest of his career.

A charismatic speaker well known for his clarity and wit, he once delivered a lecture (1994b) giving an account of Gödel&#x27;s second incompleteness theorem, employing only words of one syllable. At the end of his viva, Hilary Putnam asked him, &quot;And tell us, Mr. Boolos, what does the analytical hierarchy have to do with the real world?&quot; Without hesitating Boolos replied, &quot;It&#x27;s part of it&quot;. An expert on puzzles of all kinds, in 1993 Boolos reached the London Regional Final of &quot;The Times&quot; crossword competition. His score was one of the highest ever recorded by an American. He wrote a paper on &quot;The Hardest Logic Puzzle Ever&quot;—one of many puzzles created by Raymond Smullyan.

Boolos died of pancreatic cancer on 27 May 1996.

== Work ==
Boolos coauthored with Richard Jeffrey the first three editions of the classic university text on mathematical logic, &quot;Computability and Logic&quot;. The book is now in its fifth edition, the last two editions updated by John P. Burgess.

Kurt Gödel wrote the first paper on provability logic, which applies modal logic—the logic of necessity and possibility—to the theory of mathematical proof, but Gödel never developed the subject to any significant extent. Boolos was one of its earliest proponents and pioneers, and he produced the first book-length treatment of it, &quot;The Unprovability of Consistency&quot;, published in 1979. The solution of a major unsolved problem some years later led to a new treatment, &quot;The Logic of Provability&quot;, published in 1993. The modal-logical treatment of provability helped demonstrate the &quot;intensionality&quot; of Gödel&#x27;s Second Incompleteness Theorem, meaning that the theorem&#x27;s correctness depends on the precise formulation of the provability predicate. These conditions were first identified by David Hilbert and Paul Bernays in their &quot;Grundlagen der Arithmetik&quot;. The unclear status of the Second Theorem was noted for several decades by logicians such as Georg Kreisel and Leon Henkin, who asked whether the formal sentence expressing &quot;This sentence is provable&quot; (as opposed to the Gödel sentence, &quot;This sentence is not provable&quot;) was provable and hence true. Martin Löb showed Henkin&#x27;s conjecture to be true, as well as identifying an important &quot;reflection&quot; principle also neatly codified using the modal logical approach. Some of the key provability results involving the representation of provability predicates had been obtained earlier using very different methods by Solomon Feferman.

Boolos was an authority on the 19th-century German mathematician and philosopher Gottlob Frege. Boolos proved a conjecture due to Crispin Wright (and also proved, independently, by others), that the system of Frege&#x27;s &quot;Grundgesetze&quot;, long thought vitiated by Russell&#x27;s paradox, could be freed of inconsistency by replacing one of its axioms, the notorious Basic Law V with Hume&#x27;s Principle. The resulting system has since been the subject of intense work.

Boolos argued that if one reads the second-order variables in monadic second-order logic plurally, then second-order logic can be interpreted as having no ontological commitment to entities other than those over which the first-order variables range. The result is plural quantification. David Lewis employed plural quantification in his &quot;Parts of Classes&quot; to derive a system in which Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory and the Peano axioms were all theorems. While Boolos is usually credited with plural quantification, Peter Simons (1982) has argued that the essential idea can be found in the work of Stanislaw Leśniewski.

Shortly before his death, Boolos chose 30 of his papers to be published in a book. The result is perhaps his most highly regarded work, his posthumous &quot;Logic, Logic, and Logic&quot;. This book reprints much of Boolos&#x27;s work on the rehabilitation of Frege, as well as a number of his papers on set theory, second-order logic and nonfirstorderizability, plural quantification, proof theory, and three short insightful papers on Gödel&#x27;s Incompleteness Theorem. There are also papers on Dedekind, Cantor, and Russell.

<text>Control Machete is a Mexican hip hop group from Monterrey, Nuevo León. Its members are Fermín IV (listed as Fermin IV Caballero Elizondo in credits), Patricio &quot;Pato Machete&quot; Chapa Elizalde, and Toy Kenobi (Antonio &quot;Toy&quot; Hernández).

==History==
The group moved to the mainstream after their song &quot;Sí Señor&quot; was used as backing in the Levi&#x27;s Super Bowl television commercial &quot;Crazy Legs&quot;. However, their debut album was already a bestseller, with 100,000 units sold in Mexico and 400,000 in all of Latin America.
In 1998, Control Machete covered the song &quot;Amnesia&quot; included in the album &quot;Volcán: Tributo a José José&quot;, a tribute to Mexican legend José José.

Fermin IV left Control Machete in 2002 and released a solo album, &quot;Boomerang&quot;. He also collaborated with Cypress Hill on the track &quot;Siempre Peligroso&quot; on their album &quot;Los grandes éxitos en español&quot;.

Control Machete&#x27;s track &quot;Danzón&quot; was recorded in Cuba with Buena Vista Social Club&#x27;s Rubén González. The songs &quot;Sí señor&quot;, &quot;De Perros Amores&quot; and &quot;Pesada&quot; were included in the Alejandro González Iñárritu film &quot;Amores perros&quot; and its soundtrack. The band&#x27;s music was also heard in the 2005 film &quot;Land of the Dead&quot; (&quot;En El Camino&quot;), as well as the 2006 film &quot;Crank&quot; (&quot;Bandera&quot;) starring Jason Statham. &quot;Humanos Mexicanos&quot; played in an episode from the fifth season of the FX series &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot;.

The group&#x27;s music has appeared in several video games, including &quot;Total Overdose&quot;, &quot;Crackdown&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

Their 2003 album reached No. 18 on the Latin Pop charts.

The group has been on an indefinite hiatus since 2004. Pato and DJ Toy have collaborated with other artists and released their own solo albums. They have stated since that while they have no concrete plans to reunite, they don&#x27;t discard the possibility if and when it feels right.

<doc id="340626" wikidata="Q574835" url="?curid=340626" title="First Special Service Force">
<text>The 1st Special Service Force (FSSF) was an elite joint American–Canadian commando unit in World War II, formed by Lieutenant Colonel Robert T. Frederick of the Operations Division of the U.S. General Staff. During the Italian campaign of World War II, it was commanded by Frederick and attached to the United States Fifth Army. In August 1944, the Force was attached to 1st Airborne Task Force (commanded by then Major General Frederick) for the campaign in southern France.

The unit was organized in 1942 and trained at Fort William Henry Harrison near Helena, Montana, in the United States. The Force served in the Aleutian Islands, fought in Italy and southern France, and was disbanded in December 1944.

The modern American and Canadian special operations forces trace their heritage to this unit. In 2013, the United States Congress passed a bill to award the 1st Special Service Force the Congressional Gold Medal.

==Origins and development==

===Background===
Geoffrey Pyke was an English journalist, educationalist, and later an inventor whose clever, but , ideas could be difficult to implement. In lifestyle and appearance, he fit the common stereotype of a scientist-engineer-inventor: in British slang, a &quot;boffin&quot;. This was part of the British approach to encouraging innovative warfare methods and weapons during World War II, which was personally backed by Prime Minister Winston Churchill. Hobart&#x27;s Funnies are another example.

While working for the British Combined Operations Command, Pyke devised a plan for the creation of a small, elite force capable of fighting behind enemy lines in winter conditions. This was to have been a commando unit that could be landed, by sea or air, in occupied Norway, Romania, or the Italian Alps for sabotage missions against hydroelectric plants and oil fields.

In Norway, the chief industrial threat was the production of the heavy water used in the German atomic weapon research at Rjukan. Furthermore, attacks on 14 designated Norwegian hydroelectrical power stations, those which would be vulnerable to special force snow vehicles, which supplied the country with 49% of its total power, might drive the Axis powers out of the country and give the Allies a direct link to the USSR. In Romania, there were the strategically important Ploiești oil fields that met one quarter of German consumption, and Italian hydroelectric plants powered most of south German industry. Pyke requested that a tracked vehicle be developed especially for the Norwegian operations, capable of carrying men and their equipment at high speed across snow-covered terrain.

===Project PLOUGH===
In March 1942 Pyke proposed Project PLOUGH to Lord Louis Mountbatten, Chief of Combined Operations Headquarters. Pyke suggested that Allied commandos be parachuted into the Norwegian mountains to establish a covert base on the Jostedalsbreen, a large glacier plateau in German-occupied Norway, for guerrilla actions against the German army of occupation. Equipped with Pyke&#x27;s proposed snow vehicle, they would attack strategic targets, such as 14 important hydroelectric power plants. Pyke persuaded Mountbatten that such a force would be virtually invulnerable in its glacier strongholds and would tie down large numbers of German troops trying to dislodge it.

However, given the demands upon both Combined Operations and British industry, Britain instead offered PLOUGH to the United States at the Chequers Conference of March 1942. General George Marshall, Chief of Staff of the United States Army, accepted PLOUGH. In April 1942, since no suitable vehicle existed, the US government asked automobile manufacturers to look into such a design. With input from an international team that included Canadian inventor George J. Klein, Studebaker subsequently created the T-15 cargo carrier, which later became the M29 Weasel.

In May 1942, PLOUGH was reviewed by Major Robert T. Frederick, a young officer in the Operations Division of the U.S. General Staff. Frederick predicted PLOUGH would be a military fiasco. Firstly, he argued that PLOUGH called for unrealistic objectives with the number of troops allocated. Similarly, he argued that the small, elite unit would be outnumbered and overwhelmed trying to hold a captured area. Furthermore, Frederick concluded that there was no definite way to evacuate the troops after a mission. Withdrawal would require significant troop lift and covering fighter support. All vehicles and equipment would have to be abandoned. Finally, PLOUGH had called for troops to be parachuted on their targets, which Frederick said was impossible at the moment, as there were no planes to fly the men into Norway. Additionally, significant aircraft would be necessary to drop the Weasels and resupply the force. Ultimately, he concluded that a small unit of elite men would not do enough damage to justify the risk of putting them into battle. He instead proposed a series of strategic bombings to achieve the plan&#x27;s objectives.

Generals Marshall and Eisenhower had already discussed PLOUGH with the British high command and were unwilling to give up a chance to open an American front in Europe. It was believed that PLOUGH offered the possibility of defeating the Germans, and the Americans wanted Allied efforts to shift to the Pacific Theater. The sooner the Germans were defeated, it was argued, the sooner this would become a reality.

The first officer picked to lead the unit, Lieutenant Colonel Howard R. Johnson, did not get along well with Pyke. Johnson was transferred after arguing with Mountbatten and Eisenhower about the feasibility of the plan. (Johnson went on to form and command the 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment.) He was replaced by Frederick, following a suggestion by Mountbatten, which was approved by Eisenhower. Frederick was given the task of creating a fighting unit for PLOUGH and was promoted to colonel to command it. By July 1942 Frederick had eased Pyke out of the picture.

The First Special Service Force (FSSF) was activated on 9 July 1942 as a joint Canadian-U.S. force of three small regiments and a service battalion, directly answerable to the joint Chiefs of Staff. US Army Fort William Henry Harrison in Helena, Montana, was chosen as the primary training location, due to its flat terrain for airborne training and its close proximity to mountains for ski and winter training.

Frederick had very high priority in obtaining equipment and training areas. Originally, due to its winter warfare mission, it had been intended that the FSSF should be equally made up of American, Canadian, and Norwegian troops. However, a lack of suitable Norwegians saw this changed to half American and half Canadian.

=== Canadian recruitment ===
In July 1942, the Canadian Minister of National Defence, James Ralston, approved the assignment of 697 officers and enlisted men for PLOUGH, under the guise that they were forming Canada&#x27;s first airborne unit, the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion (1CPB).

Due to a decision to raise an actual Canadian parachute battalion, the Canadian volunteers for PLOUGH were also sometimes known unofficially as the &quot;2nd Canadian Parachute Battalion&quot;. (The Canadians did not officially become a unit until April–May 1943, under the designation, 1st Canadian Special Service Battalion.)

While its members remained part of the Canadian Army, subject to its code of discipline and paid by the Canadian government, they were to be supplied with uniforms, equipment, food, shelter and travel expenses by the US Army. It was agreed that a Canadian would serve as second in command of the force and that half of the officers and initially one-half of the enlisted men would be Canadian. This resulted in a total force of 1,800 men: 900 US soldiers and 900 Canadian soldiers. As casualties depleted the Force, restrictions on the availability of Canadian replacements reduced the proportion of the Canadian contingent to about one-third of the total. After Lieutenant Colonel McQueen, the senior Canadian member, broke his leg during parachute training, the highest ranking Canadian in the force was Lieutenant Colonel Don Williamson, who commanded the 2nd Regiment.

=== US recruitment ===
The US volunteers for the force consisted initially of officers from Forts Belvoir and Benning.

Letters of recruitment were posted to all US Army units in the Southwest and on the Pacific coast. The letters called for single men, aged 21–35 with three or more years of grammar school. Occupations preferred: Rangers, lumberjacks, north woodsmen, hunters, prospectors, explorers, and game wardens. Married men were not accepted for the Force. Inspection teams also scoured the western camps for ideal candidates. Those chosen, due to the secrecy of the mission, were often told that they had been selected to undergo training for a parachute unit. Indeed, the unit was so secretive, that many soldiers did not know where they were when they arrived in Helena for training, as the windows of the trains carrying the troops were painted black.

The combat force was to be made up of three regiments. Each regiment was led by a lieutenant colonel and 32 officers and had 385 men. The regiments were divided into two battalions with three companies in each battalion and three platoons in each company. Each platoon had two sections.

Following initial training period in Montana, the FSSF relocated to Camp Bradford, Virginia, on 15 April 1943, and to Fort Ethan Allen, Vermont, on 23 May 1943.

=== Training and equipment ===
Because the unit needed to be trained quickly, the soldiers began parachuting within 48 hours of their arrival in Helena, Montana. The camp had no training towers and preliminary flights were not carried out, so for many this was their first experience at jumping. This training was completed before any other because it was believed that if all the soldiers earned their jumping badges simultaneously a sense of camaraderie would develop within the camp.

The men were on a strict and physically demanding three phase training schedule:
1) From August to October: parachuting, weapons, and demolitions usage, small unit tactics and physical training.
2) From October to November: unit tactics and problem solving.
3) From November to July: skiing, rock climbing, adaptation to cold climates and operation of the M29 Weasel.

The training schedule started with reveille at 04:30 from Monday to Saturday followed by breakfast at 06:30. The obstacle course was run by 08:00 four times a week, followed by the day&#x27;s training, which differed depending on the month. Soldiers were expected to march double time between training exercises to adhere to the strict schedule. Training lectures were given by veterans of overseas wars in the evenings from Monday to Friday. Soldiers were given Saturday evenings and Sundays off. Most of the men went into Helena to relax on their days off.

Marches were done on a course. The course record was set by the First Regiment of Colonel A. C. Marshall, which completed it in twenty hours. The FSSF trained with enemy weapons, taking them apart, reassembling and shooting them until they were as proficient with them as with their own.

The hand-to-hand combat instructor was Dermot (Pat) O&#x27;Neill, an ex-Shanghai International Police Officer, who was an expert at unarmed combat. O&#x27;Neill, who was well-versed in several forms of martial arts, taught the men to attack the eyes, throat, groin, and knees. He also taught knife fighting tactics and showed the men how to quick-draw their pistols. The men attacked one another with unsheathed bayonets as part of the training exercises and injuries were common.

Ski training, taught by Norwegian instructors, began in December. The men received lectures and demonstrations on skiing techniques and most had mastered the basics in two weeks. At this point the men were made to ski cross-country in formation from dawn until dusk with all of their equipment until they were up to Norwegian army standards.

As a light infantry unit destined for alpine or winter combat, the FSSF was issued various items of non-standard clothing, equipment and rations, including skis, parkas, haversacks and the Mountain ration. From the outset, the FSSF was armed with a variety of non-standard or limited-issue weapons, such as the M1941 Johnson machine gun. The Johnson light machine gun in particular helped greatly increase the firepower of the FSSF and was highly regarded by those who used it in combat. The men were also trained meticulously in the assembly and operation of German weapons in the event that it became necessary to utilize captured German machine guns on the battlefield. This training would later prove to be of crucial importance at Monte Majo.

Frederick&#x27;s staff even considered arming the men with blow darts but it was decided against on the grounds that it may have been considered a war crime. Frederick himself participated in the design of a fighting knife made exclusively for the FSSF called the V-42 combat knife, a derivative of the Fairbairn–Sykes fighting knife.

===Name, insignia and uniforms===
Legend has it that while carrying out beachhead operations at Anzio, a member of the FSSF found the journal of a German lieutenant from the Hermann Goering Division. The journal contained the following entry: &quot;The Black Devils are all around us every time we come into the line. We never hear them come.&quot; This legend was never verified as fact by any member of the FSSF; however, the FSSF was known as the Black Devils and as the Devil&#x27;s Brigade. The members of the FSSF preferred the latter. General Frederick had cards printed up with the FSSF insignia and the words or &quot;The worst is yet to come&quot; printed in red ink down the right side to be left on the bodies of dead Germans as a form of psychological warfare. This was so effective that Sergeant Victor Kaisner reported hearing a German soldier whisper (&quot;Black Devil&quot;) as the German&#x27;s throat was being sliced on the beachhead. However, recent historiography surrounding the FSSF debates whether or not Frederick and his general staff made up the nickname in order to instill fear in the enemy.

The FSSF was unofficially first known as the &quot;Braves&quot;. Their spearhead shoulder insignia was chosen with this name in mind. The formation patch was a red spearhead with the words USA written horizontally and CANADA written vertically. The branch of service insignia was the crossed arrows formerly worn by the United States Army Indian Scouts. The FSSF wore red, white, and blue piping on their garrison caps, and on the breast an oval (or trimming) behind their Parachutist Wings. Members of the FSSF also wore a red, white, and blue fourragère, lanyard, or shoulder cord made out of parachute suspension lines.

American members of the FSSF arrived for training in Helena in standard U.S. Army attire: green twill coveralls, some wearing khaki pants and fatigue hats. Others were dressed in trousers and green uniform jackets and wore green caps. Ultimately, however, the American uniforms did not differ widely from one another. The Canadian troops, however, arrived in all different manners of uniform: some wore kilts, others tartan trousers (trews), and others Bermuda shorts. Headgear differed just as widely, depending on where the soldier was from – wedge caps for some, black berets for troops taken from armoured regiments and large khaki Tam o&#x27; Shanters for soldiers from Scottish regiments. Under the Williamson-Wickham agreement, Canadian soldiers were issued and wore American uniforms. Eventually, it was decided that the uniforms would come from an American supplier and olive drab trousers and blouses were issued. Two uniform elements differentiated an American from a Canadian: the collar insignia had either &quot;U.S.&quot; or &quot;Canada&quot; above the crossed arrows; and Americans wore American metal ID tags and Canadians wore Canadian ID discs. Frederick instructed Major Orville Baldwin to develop a unique fourragère (also known as an aiguillette or lanyard) for all members of the unit, thereby replacing the regimental fourragère worn by the Canadian soldiers. The result was a braided fourragère made with red, white and blue parachute cord. For mountain warfare, the men were given baggy ski pants, parkas, and a helmet. Standard boots were originally the same as those issued to parachuting regiments, but these were replaced with infantry combat boots in Italy.

Colonel Frederick worried from the outset that the soldiers from both countries would have trouble forming a cohesive unit. On a base level, the techniques and commands used by either army were confusing to the other. Commands for marching, for example, had to be homogenized in order for the unit to operate in the field effectively. In order to satisfy the men from both countries, compromises were made. Canadian bagpipers were put into American unit marching bands to play &quot;Reveille&quot; every morning. The marching styles and commands of the American and Canadian armies were mixed and uniforms were made identical. In the end, Frederick&#x27;s fears were unfounded as the men bonded through training and dedication to the force.

==Assignments and battles==
===Aleutian Islands, 1943===
In February 1943,Norwegian SOE agents destroyed the heavy water and deuterium plants.

To prevent the FSSF from being disbanded, Frederick proposed using it against the Japanese in Alaska. It was decided that the FSSF would be used against Japanese forces occupying islands off Alaska. The FSSF arrived at the San Francisco Port of Embarkation on 4 July 1943.

On 10 July the Devil&#x27;s Brigade sailed for the Aleutian Islands off Alaska. On 15 August 1943, the FSSF was part of the invasion of the island of Kiska. The Japanese had evacuated the island, so the FSSF re-embarked. They returned to Fort Ethan Allen, arriving 9 September 1943.

===Italy deployment, 1943===
In October 1943, US Fifth Army commander Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark brought the FSSF to the Italian front. There the FSSF demonstrated the value of its unique skills and training. The FSSF arrived at Naples on 17 November 1943, and immediately went into the line with the US 36th Infantry Division.

===Monte la Difensa, 1943===
The FSSF was tasked with taking two heavily fortified German positions on the Camino ridge in the Italian mountains: Monte La Difensa, overlooking the Volturno River, and Monte La Remetanea, 1,200 yards to the west. These positions were held by the 104th Panzer Grenadier Regiment (an infantry formation) with the 1st Fallschirm-Panzer Division Hermann Göring (an armored division) in reserve. The German positions on La Difensa and La Remetanea were the last entrenched line before the Gustav Line. An Allied push through the mountains would advance closer to Rome. Strategically, the mountains provided a commanding view of the countryside and highway, giving German artillery on the mountain control of the surrounding area. The German artillery atop La Defensa were also using a new weapon - the Nebelwerfer. Previous large scale Allied attacks on the mountain had met the enemy head on and been repelled with disastrous casualties. The paths leading up La Difensa were heavily scouted by the FSSF before their attack. The scouts reported to Lt. Col. T. C. MacWilliam (who would lead the 2nd Regiment&#x27;s assault on La Remetanea) that the best way to approach the entrenched enemy was up an almost vertical escarpment over the right of the hill mass. By this approach, the FSSF hoped to catch the Germans off guard.

The assault was planned for 2 December. The men were trained in mountain climbing and fighting tactics at their temporary barracks at Santa Maria. The plan was as follows (all battalions were in the 2nd Regiment): At 16:30 hours on 1 December, 2nd Regiment would be trucked to within of the base of La Difensa and march the rest of the way (6-hour march). 1st Regiment, coupled with US 36th Infantry Division would be the reserve units for the 2nd Regiment. 3rd Regiment would be split in two, half to support the 2nd Regiment following the initial assault, and half to be reserves with the 1st Regiment and 36th Infantry Division. All identification on FSSF soldiers was to be removed except their dog tags.

After reaching the base of the mountain and having had a single night&#x27;s rest, 2nd Regiment (600 men total) began their ascent of La Difensa on 2 December at dusk under cover of a heavy artillery barrage. One soldier recalls the severity of the shelling: &quot;It looked as if we were marching into Hell. The whole mountain was being shelled and the whole mountain seemed to be on fire.&quot;

The soldiers of the 2nd Regiment came within range of the German positions at midnight and began to climb the final cliff, which jutted steeply upwards for . The men climbed with ropes tied to one another in the freezing rain. Upon reaching the top, MacWilliam signaled his men to move forward into a depression in front of the German entrenchment. Initially, the soldiers were given the order to hold their fire until 6 AM, but the Germans noticed the Allied movent after some FSSF men tripped over loose gravel while moving along the mountaintop. Germans shot flares into the air and the battle began. Through gun and mortar fire, the men of the 2nd Regiment managed to set up machine guns and return fire, surprising and overwhelming the Germans. The 5th Army Staff had guessed that the battle would last between 4–5 days, but within two hours, the Germans on La Difensa had retreated to La Remetanea.

When informed by General Eisenhower that the FSSF had taken Monte la Difensa, Prime Minister Winston Churchill exclaimed that Frederick was &quot;the greatest fighting general of all time&quot;.

Previously, American and British forces had suffered many casualties in futile attempts to take the important Camino ridge. The 1st SSF took their initial objective of La Difensa, but the attack on Monte La Remetanea (Hill 907) was halted after the death of 1st Battalion CO Lt. Col. T. C. MacWilliam. While Frederick wanted the attack to continue, he ordered a halt in the advance on 907 to wait for reinforcements and supplies. The FSSF dug in at Difensa, anticipating a German counterattack.

However, massive Allied artillery barrages and the flooding of both the Rapido and Garigliano rivers prevented the Germans from reforming. While waiting for the orders to attack Remetanea, the 2nd Regiment were resupplied by the 1st and 3rd Regiments, who brought them whiskey and condoms (to keep the barrels of their guns dry in the rain). Once the British forces broke through the German lines at Monte Camino, the FSSF was ordered to attack their primary objective (Hill 907). 

The successful assault on Difensa was the basis for the 1968 motion picture titled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;.

During the Monte la Difensa campaign the 1st SSF units engaged suffered 77% casualties: 511 total, 91 dead, 9 missing, 313 wounded with 116 exhaustion cases. They were relieved by the 142nd Infantry.

===Monte Majo, 1944===
The 1st SSF immediately continued its attack, assaulting Monte La Remetanea from 6 to 9 December. It captured Hill 720, starting from Monte Sammucro on 25 December, and after difficulties assaulted Monte Majo and Monte Vischiataro almost simultaneously on 8 January 1944.

The attack on Monte Majo would sustain the highest casualties of the Force in any battle. While the main German positions were located on the summit of Monte Majo, the heights of the mountain were guarded and surrounded by layers of German artillery and machine gun pits located on the approaching slopes. Lt. Col. Tom Gilday of 2nd Regiment planned a preliminary night action to clear an assault route through this defensive shield. Tommy Prince was ordered to lead a scout patrol and accomplish this mission with complete silence during the night. Prince, an expert in stealth combat, proceeded to a point near the lower slopes where he left his men behind as a support group. He then single-handedly approached and entered the gun emplacements. Prince eliminated the enemy gun platoons in the bunkers blocking the projected assault route one after another, beginning with the gun pits on the lower slopes and then proceeding with the middle slopes, without arousing any defensive alarms from the German positions. Prince then returned with his patrol to the Force forward outposts to give his report to Capt. Radcliffe.

The main attack led by Capt. Mark Radcliffe immediately followed Prince&#x27;s action. Radcliffe&#x27;s men passed by the now silent machine gun bunkers and reached the summit without firing a single bullet, the Germans taken by total surprise. The Monte Majo positions were secured by 05:30. 

However, following the loss of the summit to the Force, the Germans almost immediately launched large scale counter-attacks to attempt to recapture the summit which persisted throughout several days of fierce fighting. The Force made use of heavy machine guns left behind by the retreating Germans to help repel these counter-attacks.

Following the intense defensive action at Monte Majo, the size of the Force had been reduced from the initial 1,800 men at the start of the mountain campaign to only 400 men still fit for combat. Frederick himself was wounded three times at Monte Majo.

At the conclusion of the Monte Majo operation, Frederick was promoted to Brigadier General. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions and leadership at Monte Majo from 10-13 January, 1944.

===Anzio, 1944===
Following the Québec Conference in August 1943, General Dwight D. Eisenhower was moved to London to plan for the Normandy landings. Command of the Mediterranean Theater was given to British General Henry Maitland Wilson. General Sir Harold Alexander, commanding the Allied Armies in Italy, had formulated the plan to land Allied troops at Anzio in order to outflank German positions in the area. German Field Marshal Albert Kesselring commanded the four German divisions at Anzio, which included the Hermann Goering Division and the 35th Panzer Grenadier Regiment of the 16th SS Panzergrenadier Division Reichsführer-SS Division. Combined German and Italian strength at Anzio was an estimated 70,000 men.

The Special Force brigade was withdrawn from the mountains in January and, after bringing in new replacements for their previous losses, on 1 February was landed at the beachhead created by Operation Shingle at Anzio, south of Rome. They replaced the 1st and 3rd Ranger Battalions, which had suffered heavy losses in the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Cisterna. Together with the remnants of the Ranger battalions, who were seconded to the Force, the numbers of FSSF now were about 1,200 men. However, there was insufficient time to train the new additions to the same high level of skill as the first generation of FSSF soldiers, and Frederick reported that the capabilities of the Brigade were no longer as finely prepared for special assignments.

Their task was to hold and raid from the right-hand flank of the beachhead marked by the Mussolini Canal/Pontine Marshes. This length of perimeter defense was about eight miles, twice the length of a front to defend as assigned to the entire U.S. Third Division at Anzio. 1st Regiment was positioned on the force&#x27;s right front, which comprised one-third of the entire line, while the 3rd Regiment guarded the remaining two-thirds of the line. 2nd Regiment, which had been reduced to three companies following the attacks on La Difensa, Sammucio, and Majo, were tasked with running night patrols into Axis territory. Shortly after the SSF took over the Mussolini Canal sector, German units pulled back up to to avoid their aggressive patrols. The force&#x27;s constant night raids forced Kesselring to fortify the German positions in their area with more men than he had originally planned. Reconnaissance missions performed by the Devils often went as deep as behind enemy lines.

Frederick was greatly admired by the soldiers of the First Special Service Force for his willingness to fight alongside the men in battle. On the beachhead in Anzio, for example, a nighttime Force patrol walked into a German minefield and was pinned down by machine gun fire. Colonel Frederick ran into battle and assisted the litter bearers in clearing the wounded Force members.

German prisoners were often surprised at how few men the force actually contained. A captured German lieutenant admitted to being under the assumption that the force was a division. Indeed, General Frederick ordered several trucks to move around the forces area in order to give the enemy the impression that the force comprised more men than it actually did. An order was found on another prisoner that stated that the Germans in Anzio would be &quot;fighting an elite Canadian-American Force. They are treacherous, unmerciful and clever. You cannot afford to relax. The first soldier or group of soldiers capturing one of these men will be given a 10-day furlough.&quot;

It was at Anzio that the 1st Special Service Force inspired the &quot;Black Devils&quot; nickname, which appears to have been an invention of the Force&#x27;s intelligence officers. There is no record of any German ever referring to the Force as &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;. They were referred to as &quot;black&quot; devils because the brigade&#x27;s members smeared their faces with black boot polish for their covert operations in the dark of the night. During Anzio, the 1st SSF fought for 99 days without relief. It was also at Anzio that the 1st SSF used their trademark stickers; during night patrols soldiers would carry stickers depicting the unit patch and a slogan written in German: &quot;Das dicke Ende kommt noch,&quot; said to translate colloquially to &quot;The worst is yet to come&quot;. Its literal translation is actually &quot;The thick end is coming soon&quot;, implying that a larger force was on its way imminently, placing these stickers on German corpses and fortifications. Canadian and American members of the Special Force who lost their lives are buried near the beach in the Commonwealth Anzio War Cemetery and the American Cemetery in Nettuno, just east of Anzio.

When the U.S. Fifth Army&#x27;s breakout offensive began on 25 May 1944, the 1st SSF was sent against Monte Arrestino, and attacked Rocca Massima on 27 May. The 1st SSF was given the assignment of capturing seven bridges in the city to prevent their demolition by the withdrawing Wehrmacht. During the night of 4 June, members of the 1st SSF entered Rome, one of the first Allied units to do so. After they secured the bridges, they quickly moved north in pursuit of the retreating Germans.

In August 1944 1st SSF came under the command of Colonel Edwin Walker when Brigadier General Frederick, who had commanded the force since its earliest days, left on promotion to major general to command the 1st Airborne Task Force. Frederick became the youngest major general in the U.S. Army.

===France, 1944===
On 14 August 1944, the 1st SSF, now restored by recruitment to a 2,000-man unit, landed on the islands of Port Cros and Île du Levant during Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. They fought the small Battle of Port Cros in which they captured the five forts on the islands from the German Army. Nine men were killed in action or died of wounds received in combat.

On 22 August the Force was attached to Frederick&#x27;s 1st Airborne Task Force, a provisional Seventh Army airborne division, and later made part of the Task Force.

In the first week of September the Force advanced through the French Riviera sector and on September 5 attacked and either killed or captured an entire German battalion of about 1,000 men near L&#x27;Escarène. On 7 September it moved with the 1st Airborne Task Force to defensive positions on the Franco-Italian border.

During the war the 1,800-man unit accounted for some 12,000 German casualties, captured some 7,000 prisoners, and sustained an attrition rate of over 600%.

===Disbandment, 1944===
The 1st SSF was disbanded 5 December 1944 in a field near Villeneuve-Loubet, on the extreme southeast Mediterranean coast of France. Villeneuve-Loubet holds a special place in the history of the force, not only because the unit was broken up there, but also because it is one of the villages that the 1st SSF had the hardest time capturing in southern France, on 26 August 1944.

Frederick had come to believe that the Force was now reliant upon assisting units of artillery and tanks, due to the type of assignments they were now being given, and were no longer utilizing special operations skills. This was partly a result of the large numbers of recent recruits who were not trained to the same high standards of special operations as the initial Force members.

The day the unit was disbanded, the American commander held a parade honouring the unit. To end the ceremony, the Canadian elements were dismissed by being honoured by the American troops with a Pass in Review, eyes right, officers salute. After the unit&#x27;s break up, the Canadians were sent to other Canadian units (most of them became replacements for the 1st Canadian Parachute Battalion). Some American members were sent to airborne divisions as replacements, others to Ranger Battalions, and still others formed the 474th Infantry Regiment, which served with the Third United States Army and performed occupation duty in Norway. United States Army Special Forces Groups (lineal descendants of 1st Special Service Force) celebrate Menton Day every 5 December with their Canadian military comrades and surviving members of the force. Usually there is a combined parachute jump, a pass in review, and a formal ball.

==Unit awards, legacy and memorials==

=== Unit awards ===
The First Special Service Force was awarded the French Croix de Guerre with Silver-Gilt Star, as well as the US Distinguished Unit Citation for extraordinary heroism.

In 2006, the Canadian members of the 1st Special Service Force received the United States Army&#x27;s Combat Infantryman Badge for participation in front-line combat.

On 3 February 2015, the FSSF was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest award congress can give to civilians.

===Individual awards===
A large number of the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; members were honored for their acts of valor, including Tommy Prince, Canada&#x27;s most decorated First Nations soldier of World War II. Prince was not given an award for his actions at Monte Majo in order to avoid compromising the security of further secret operations. Classified stealth information would have been revealed in such an award citation. Special operations soldiers today are often not awarded to avoid public exposure of special techniques or skills.

Also, U.S. member Wendell C. Johnson (Fifth Company, Third Regiment, serial # 37 168 437), risking his life to save a fellow Black Devil, walked into a minefield and brought his brigade comrade to safety. When they tried to give him a medal for his act of heroism, Wendell declined saying, &quot;Give it to the man who lost his leg&quot;.

The First Special Service Force was a branch of service where acts of heroism were commonplace, given the unusually challenging assignments which they were ordered to achieve. The Force was awarded many unit awards which were shared by the members of the Brigade as a group.

=== Descendant units ===
The 1st Special Service Force is claimed as a direct ancestor by two modern special operations units; the Canadian Special Operations Regiment (CSOR) of the Canadian Special Operations Forces Command and the Special Forces Groups of the United States Army Special Operations Command.

In 1952, Colonel Aaron Bank (a former Jedburgh and Operational Group member of the Office of Strategic Services [OSS] during WW II) became the commander of 10th Special Forces Group (Airborne). Formal lineage for the 1st Special Forces Regiment (Not to be confused with the 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne)), established in 1958, was from the FSSF. (Special Forces carried the Ranger lineage from 1952 to 1958.) Much of the training in unconventional tactics, including strategies, and lessons learned, replicated training of the Operation Groups (OG) and Jedburghs of the OSS. In Canada Military Intelligence and Logistical Operations 1952–1988, the Canadian Airborne Regiment 1968–1995 which formed part of the Special Service Force 1977-1995 and today&#x27;s Canadian Special Operations Regiment, like United States Army Special Forces, trace their roots to the FSSF. Just like in World War II, Canada&#x27;s elite JTF2 and the United States&#x27; elite SFOD-D operators were united once again into a special assignment force for the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan.


=== Other memorials ===
In 1996, Interstate 15 in Montana between Helena and Sweet Grass was renamed the &quot;First Special Service Force Memorial Highway&quot;. This highway was chosen because it was the route taken in 1942 by the Canadian volunteers to join their American counterparts for training at Fort Harrison. The entire length of Alberta Highway 4 received the same name in 1999.

The force is also memorialized in several commemorative plaques mounted in city halls and along the route they fought in Italy and Southern France, including one outside the Protestant Cemetery, Rome, next to the Pyramid of Cestius and another on the Embassy of the United States in Rome, facing Via Vittorio Veneto.

=== U.S. Army Special Forces Tab ===
When the Special Forces Tab was created in 1983 for wear by members of the U.S. Army Special Forces, it was also retroactively awarded to members of wartime combat units that had been identified as predecessors of the Special Forces. Thus, any soldier who had spent 120 days in wartime service with the First Special Service Force is authorized to wear the Special Forces Tab.

==Media depictions==
&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; is a 1968 film starring William Holden, Cliff Robertson, and Vince Edwards, focusing on the force&#x27;s training and deployment to Italy.

The 1968 film &quot;Anzio&quot; featured Peter Falk as Corporal Jack Rabinoff, who identified himself to co-star Robert Mitchum as a member of the American-Canadian 1st Special Service Force.

Three documentaries have been made about the force: &quot;Black Devils&quot; in 2000, an episode of History Channel&#x27;s &quot;Dangerous Missions&quot; series, written produced and directed by Darryl Rehr; &quot;Daring to Die: The Story of the Black Devils&quot;, written and directed by Greg Hancock and Wayne Abbot, and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot;, a 2006 TV miniseries produced by Frantic Films.

In November, 2019, a Bravery In Arms documentary was produced of the First Special Service Force assault on Monte Majo. In the documentary, the actual location of the battle was shown.

Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 2009 film &quot;Inglourious Basterds&quot; features a character named Lt. Aldo Raine aka &quot;Aldo the Apache&quot; played by Brad Pitt who wears the unit&#x27;s crossed arrows collar insignia and red arrowhead shoulder patch. Tarantino cited the 1SSF as an influence.

&quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brigade&quot; by Robert H. Adleman &amp; George H. Walton is an autobiography and historical reference for the First Special Service Force.

The Marvel Comics character Wolverine claimed several times that he was a member of the Devil&#x27;s Brigade during the war — being Canadian-born during the last years of Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign, it fits. He also claimed he took part in Anzio and Cassino battles.

<text>In mathematics, a function space is a set of functions between two fixed sets. Often, the domain and/or codomain will have additional structure which is inherited by the function space. For example, the set of functions from any set into a vector space has a natural vector space structure given by pointwise addition and scalar multiplication. In other scenarios, the function space might inherit a topological or metric structure, hence the name function &quot;space&quot;.

==In linear algebra==

Let be a field and let be any set. The functions → can be given the structure of a vector space over where the operations are defined pointwise, that is, for any , : → , any in , and any in , define
formula_1
When the domain has additional structure, one might consider instead the subset (or subspace) of all such functions which respect that structure. For example, if and also itself are vector spaces over , the set of linear maps → form a vector space over with pointwise operations (often denoted Hom(,)). One such space is the dual space of : the set of linear functionals → with addition and scalar multiplication defined pointwise.

The cardinal dimension of a function space with no extra structure can be found by the Erdős–Kaplansky theorem.

==Examples==
Function spaces appear in various areas of mathematics:

* In set theory, the set of functions from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; may be denoted {&quot;X&quot; → &quot;Y&quot;} or &quot;Y&quot;&quot;X&quot;.
** As a special case, the power set of a set &quot;X&quot; may be identified with the set of all functions from &quot;X&quot; to {0, 1}, denoted 2&quot;X&quot;. 
* The set of bijections from &quot;X&quot; to &quot;Y&quot; is denoted formula_2. The factorial notation &quot;X&quot;! may be used for permutations of a single set &quot;X&quot;.
* In functional analysis, the same is seen for continuous linear transformations, including topologies on the vector spaces in the above, and many of the major examples are function spaces carrying a topology; the best known examples include Hilbert spaces and Banach spaces.
* In functional analysis, the set of all functions from the natural numbers to some set &quot;X&quot; is called a &quot;sequence space&quot;. It consists of the set of all possible sequences of elements of &quot;X&quot;.
* In topology, one may attempt to put a topology on the space of continuous functions from a topological space &quot;X&quot; to another one &quot;Y&quot;, with utility depending on the nature of the spaces. A commonly used example is the compact-open topology, e.g. loop space. Also available is the product topology on the space of set theoretic functions (i.e. not necessarily continuous functions) &quot;Y&quot;&quot;X&quot;. In this context, this topology is also referred to as the topology of pointwise convergence.
* In algebraic topology, the study of homotopy theory is essentially that of discrete invariants of function spaces;
* In the theory of stochastic processes, the basic technical problem is how to construct a probability measure on a function space of &quot;paths of the process&quot; (functions of time);
* In category theory, the function space is called an exponential object or map object. It appears in one way as the representation canonical bifunctor; but as (single) functor, of type formula_3, it appears as an adjoint functor to a functor of type formula_4 on objects;
* In functional programming and lambda calculus, function types are used to express the idea of higher-order functions.
* In domain theory, the basic idea is to find constructions from partial orders that can model lambda calculus, by creating a well-behaved Cartesian closed category.
* In the representation theory of finite groups, given two finite-dimensional representations and of a group , one can form a representation of over the vector space of linear maps Hom(,) called the Hom representation.

==Functional analysis==
Functional analysis is organized around adequate techniques to bring function spaces as topological vector spaces within reach of the ideas that would apply to normed spaces of finite dimension. Here we use the real line as an example domain, but the spaces below exist on suitable open subsets formula_5

*formula_6 continuous functions endowed with the uniform norm topology
*formula_7 continuous functions with compact support
* formula_8 bounded functions
* formula_9 continuous functions which vanish at infinity
* formula_10 continuous functions that have &quot;r&quot; continuous derivatives.
* formula_11 smooth functions
* formula_12 smooth functions with compact support (i.e. the set of bump functions)
*formula_13 real analytic functions
*formula_14, for formula_15, is the Lp space of measurable functions whose &quot;p&quot;-norm formula_16 is finite
*formula_17, the Schwartz space of rapidly decreasing smooth functions and its continuous dual, formula_18 tempered distributions
*formula_19 compact support in limit topology
* formula_20 Sobolev space of functions whose weak derivatives up to order &quot;k&quot; are in formula_21
* formula_22 holomorphic functions
* linear functions
* piecewise linear functions
* continuous functions, compact open topology
* all functions, space of pointwise convergence 
* Hardy space
* Hölder space
* Càdlàg functions, also known as the Skorokhod space
* formula_23, the space of all Lipschitz functions on formula_24 that vanish at zero.

==Norm==
If is an element of the function space formula_25 of all continuous functions that are defined on a closed interval , the norm formula_26 defined on formula_25 is the maximum absolute value of for ,
formula_28

is called the &quot;uniform norm&quot; or &quot;supremum norm&quot; (&#x27;sup norm&#x27;).

<text>Victoria Harbour is a natural landform harbour in Hong Kong separating Hong Kong Island in the south from the Kowloon Peninsula to the north. The harbour&#x27;s deep, sheltered waters and strategic location on South China Sea were instrumental in Hong Kong&#x27;s establishment as a British colony in 1841 and its subsequent development as a trading centre.

Throughout its history, the harbour has seen numerous reclamation projects undertaken on both shores, many of which have caused controversy in recent years. Environmental concerns have been expressed about the effects of these expansions, in terms of water quality and loss of natural habitat. It has also been proposed that benefits of land reclamation may be less than the effects of decreased harbour width, affecting the number of vessels passing through the harbour. Nonetheless Victoria Harbour still retains its founding role as a port for thousands of international vessels each year.
The harbour is a major tourist attraction of Hong Kong. Lying in the middle of the territory&#x27;s dense urban region, the harbour is the site of annual fireworks displays and its promenades are used as gathering places for residents and also tourists.

==History==

The first reference to what is now called Victoria Harbour is found in Zheng He&#x27;s sailing maps of the China coast, dated c.1425, which appear in the &quot;Wubei Zhi&quot; (&quot;A Treatise on Armament Technology&quot;), a comprehensive 17th-century military book. While the harbour was charted in later maps, the first map depicting it in detail is an 1810 marine chart prepared for the East India Company by Daniel Ross and Philip Maughan, lieutenants of the Bombay Marine.

Some of the first recreational activities to take place in the harbour were water competitions such as swimming and water polo in the 1850s, undertaken by members of Hong Kong&#x27;s first sports club, the Victoria Recreation Club.

During the Taiping Rebellion, armed rebels paraded the streets of Hong Kong. On 21 December 1854, the Hong Kong police arrested several armed rebels who were about to attack Kowloon City. On 23 January 1855, a fleet of Taiping war boats was on the verge of a naval battle against Chinese imperial war boats defending the harbour. The Chinese defenders were ordered away by the British colonial authorities. These incidents caused rising tension that would eventually lead to the Arrow War. The harbour was originally called &quot;Hong Kong Harbour&quot;, but was later renamed to &quot;Victoria Harbour&quot;, to assure shelter for the British fleet under Queen Victoria.
The subject of pollution came to the fore in the 1970s with the rapid growth of the manufacturing sector. The water club races were stopped in 1973 due to pollution in the harbour, a year after the former RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; burned and sank at the Tsing Yi island anchorage. Studies also showed excessive nitrogen input from discharges of the Pearl River Delta into the harbour for decades.

After completion of the Central and Wan Chai Reclamation Feasibility Study in 1989, the Land Development Policy Committee endorsed a concept for gradual implementation of this additional reclamation. It consists of three district development cells separated by parks, namely, Central, Tamar and Exhibition.

The latest proposed reclamation, extending along the waterfront from Sheung Wan to Causeway Bay, faced public opposition, as the harbour has become a pivotal location to Hongkongers in general. Activists have denounced the government&#x27;s actions as destructive not only to the natural environment, but also to what is widely considered one of the most prized natural assets of the territory. NGOs, including the Society for Protection of the Harbour, were formed to resist further attempts to reduce the size of the waterbody, with its chairman, Christine Loh, quoted as saying that the harbour &quot;...is a precious national asset and we must preserve it for future generations. I believe an insightful and visionary chief executive would support our stance and work with us to protect the harbour&quot;. Reclamation work also led to the demolition of Queen&#x27;s Pier and Edinburgh Place Ferry Pier, structures of historic significance, to massive public opposition.

==Geography==

Victoria Harbour covered an area of about in 2004. The eastern boundary is generally considered to be the line formed between the westernmost extremity of Siu Chau Wan (小酒灣) and A Kung Ngam. The western boundary is generally considered to consist of a line drawn from the westernmost point of Hong Kong Island to the westernmost point of Green Island, thence a straight line drawn from the westernmost point of Green Island to the southeasternmost point of Tsing Yi, thence along the eastern and northern coastal lines of Tsing Yi to its westernmost extremity, and thence a straight line drawn true north towards the mainland.

There are several islands within the harbour: 
*Green Island
*Little Green Island
*Kowloon Rock
*Tsing Yi Island

Due to land reclamation, the following are former islands that are now connected to adjacent lands or larger islands:
*Stonecutters Island (connected to Lai Chi Kok Bay, New Kowloon)
*Channel Rock (connected to Kwun Tong, New Kowloon)
*Kellett Island (connected to Causeway Bay, Hong Kong Island)
*Hoi Sham Island (connected to To Kwa Wan, Kowloon)
*Nga Ying Chau (connected to Tsing Yi Island, New Territories)
*Pillar Island (connected to Kwai Chung, New Territories)
*Mong Chau (connected to Kwai Chung, New Territories)
*Chau Tsai (connected to Tsing Yi Island)
*Rumsey Rock (within Tsim Sha Tsui/Hung Hom)

The geology around of the harbour is made of a granitic copula which in parts is intenselly weathered.

==Tourism==

Victoria Harbour is known for its panoramic night view and skyline, particularly in the direction towards Hong Kong Island where the skyline of skyscrapers is superimposed over the ridges behind. Among the best places to view the harbour are the Peak Tower atop Victoria Peak, or from the piazza at the Cultural Centre or the promenade of Tsim Sha Tsui on the Kowloon side. Rides on the Star Ferry, including the route between Central and Tsim Sha Tsui, are another way to view the harbour and cityscape.

As the natural centre of the territory, the harbour has played host to many major public shows, including the annual fireworks displays on the second night of the Lunar New Year. These shows are popular with tourists and locals alike, and the display is usually telecast on local television. To enhance the popularity of the harbour as a sightseeing location, the government introduced a show dubbed &quot;A Symphony of Lights&quot;.

Also recently opened was the &quot;Avenue of Stars&quot;, built along the promenade outside the New World Centre in Tsim Sha Tsui. Modeled on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, it honours the most illustrious people the Hong Kong film industry has produced over the past decades.

By the end of November every year, the outer walls of buildings in the central business districts on both sides of the harbours are dressed with Christmas-related decorations, and replaced with Lunar New Year-related ones by January.

==Port facilities==
Victoria Harbour is home to most of the port facilities of Hong Kong, making Hong Kong amongst the world&#x27;s busiest. An average of 220,000 ships visit the harbour each year, including both oceangoing vessels and river vessels, for both goods and passengers. The Kwai Tsing Container Terminals in the western part of the harbour is the main container handling facility, operating round the clock. Some 19.8 million containers (measured in TEUs) were handled by the region in 2016. Some 400 container ships serve Hong Kong weekly, connecting to over 500 destinations around the world.

For many years until 2004, Hong Kong handled the most containers TEUs but slipped to sixth place on declining volumes by 2016.

==Transport==

There is no bridge crossing the harbour, but there are three cross-harbour road tunnels: Cross-Harbour Tunnel (opened 1972), Eastern Harbour Crossing (1989), and Western Harbour Crossing (1997). The three tunnels act as important linkages between the Hong Kong Island and Kowloon.

Four Mass Transit Railway routes also run under the harbour. From west to east, they are:
*Tung Chung line and Airport Express, which share the same tunnel
*Tsuen Wan line
*East Rail line (parallel to the Cross Harbour Tunnel)
*Tseung Kwan O line (sharing an immersed tube with the Eastern Harbour Crossing)

The Star Ferry has been crossing the harbour since the late 19th century. The operated ferry routes today are: Central to Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai to Tsim Sha Tsui, the Wan Chai/Central to Hung Hom services closing in 2011 for lack of patronage. Other regular ferry services also operate in the harbour.

The Hongkong and Yaumati Ferry Company used to operate numerous cross-harbour routes between various piers of Kowloon and Hong Kong Island. Many of the routes are now operated by First Ferry. Some of the piers no longer exist because of reclamation projects, or many of the routes became unprofitable. Currently, the company continues to operate vehicular ferry services for vehicles carrying dangerous goods that are prohibited within tunnel crossings.

For international passenger traffic and traffic to mainland China and Macau, there are two ferry terminals, namely Hong Kong–Macau Ferry Terminal and Hong Kong China Ferry Terminal, and a terminal for cruises, the Ocean Terminal. Another cruise terminal (Kai Tak Cruise Terminal) has recently been opened.

<text>The New Zealand Parliament () is the unicameral legislature of New Zealand, consisting of the Sovereign and the New Zealand House of Representatives. The King is usually represented by his governor-general. Before 1951, there was an upper chamber, the New Zealand Legislative Council. The New Zealand Parliament was established in 1854 and is one of the oldest continuously functioning legislatures in the world. It has met in Wellington, the capital of New Zealand, since 1865 and in its current building since 1922.

The House of Representatives normally consists of 120 members of Parliament (MPs), though sometimes more due to overhang seats. There are 72 MPs elected directly in electorates while the remainder of seats are assigned to list MPs based on each party&#x27;s share of the total party vote. Māori were represented in Parliament from 1867, and in 1893 women gained the vote. Although elections can be called early, every three years Parliament is dissolved and goes up for reelection.

Parliament is supreme over all other government institutions. The legislature is closely linked to the executive. The New Zealand Government comprises a prime minister (head of government) and other ministers; in accordance with the principle of responsible government, they are always selected from and accountable to the House of Representatives.

Neither the monarch (currently King Charles III) nor his governor-general participates in the legislative process, save for signifying the King&#x27;s approval to a bill passed by the House, known as the granting of the royal assent, which is necessary for a bill to be enacted as law. The governor-general formally summons and dissolves Parliament—the latter in order to call a general election.

==Terminology==
In New Zealand the term &quot;parliament&quot; is used in a few different senses. Firstly, the term refers to the entire legislative branch consisting of the King (whose constitutional role in the legislative process is limited) and the House of Representatives. Secondly, it can mean each group of MPs voted into office following a general election. In this sense, the 1st Parliament sat from 24 May 1854 to 15 September 1855. The current Parliament, which started on 5 December 2023, is the 54th.

Lastly, &quot;Parliament&quot; may also refer to a physical place: most specifically the debating chamber where MPs meet, also the building in which the chamber is housed (normally Parliament House, Wellington), and more generally still this building and the several other buildings in which MPs have their offices.

==History==
===Westminster model===

The New Zealand Parliament is specifically modelled on the Westminster system of parliamentary representation, developed in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. This system can be traced back to the &quot;Model Parliament&quot; of 1295.

Over the centuries, parliaments progressively limited the power of the monarchy (constitutional monarchy). The Bill of Rights 1688 (which remains in force as received law in New Zealand) established a system where parliaments would be regularly elected. Among its provisions, it set out parliament&#x27;s role in taxation and supply. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the absolute privilege for freedom of speech in parliament.

===Establishment===
As early as 1846 the British settlers in New Zealand petitioned for self-government. The New Zealand Parliament was created by the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, an act of the British Parliament, which established a bicameral legislature officially named the General Assembly, later commonly referred to as Parliament. It had a lower house, called the House of Representatives, and an upper house, called the Legislative Council. The members of the House were elected under the first-past-the-post (FPP) voting system, while those of the Council were appointed by the governor. The first members were sworn in on 24 May 1854 in Auckland.

====Upper house abolished====
Initially, legislative councillors were appointed for life, but from the 1890s they were appointed for renewable seven-year terms. This change, coupled with responsible government (whereby the premier advised the governor on Council appointments) and party politics, meant that by the 20th century, the government usually controlled the Council as well as the House, and the passage of bills through the upper house became a mere formality. In 1951, the Council was ended altogether, making the New Zealand legislature unicameral. The Council sat for the last time on 1 December 1950, before it was formally abolished on 1 January 1951.

At the time of its abolition the upper house had fifty-four members, including its own speaker.

===Provincial government===
Under the Constitution Act, legislative power was also conferred on New Zealand&#x27;s provinces (originally six in number), each of which had its own elected provincial council. These provincial councils were able to legislate for their provinces on most subjects. New Zealand was never a federation comparable to Canada or Australia; Parliament could legislate concurrently with the provinces on any matter, and in the event of a conflict, the law passed by Parliament would prevail. Over a twenty-year period, political power was progressively centralised, and the provinces were abolished altogether in 1876.

===Māori representation===

New Zealand had representatives of the indigenous population in its parliament from an early date, in contrast to many other colonial states. Reserved Māori seats were created in 1867 during the term of the 4th Parliament; Māori men aged 21 and over, whether or not they owned property, could vote to elect four Māori members of the House of Representatives. The seats were initially intended to be temporary whilst common Māori land was broken up that would allow Māori to vote in regular seats as individual land owners. However this process was resisted and the seats became permanent in 1876. In 2002, the seats increased in number to seven.

===Country quota===
One historical speciality of the New Zealand Parliament was the country quota, which gave greater representation to rural politics. From 1889 on (and even earlier in more informal forms), districts were weighted according to their urban/rural split (with any locality of less than 2,000 people considered rural). Those districts which had large rural proportions received a greater number of nominal votes than they actually contained voters – as an example, in 1927, Waipawa, a district without any urban population at all, received an additional 4,153 nominal votes to its actual 14,838 – having the maximum factor of 28% extra representation. The country quota was in effect until it was abolished in 1945 by a mostly urban-elected Labour government, which switched to a one-vote-per-person system.

===Modern independent legislature===


Originally the New Zealand Parliament remained subordinate to the British Parliament, the supreme legislative authority for the entire British Empire—although, in practice, Britain&#x27;s role was minimal from the 1890s. The New Zealand Parliament received progressively more control over New Zealand affairs through the passage of Imperial (British) laws such as the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, constitutional amendments, and an increasingly hands-off approach by the British government. In 1947, the New Zealand Parliament passed the Statute of Westminster Adoption Act, giving that parliament full power over New Zealand law, and the New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1947, an act of the British Parliament, allowed the New Zealand Parliament to regulate its own composition. In 1973 a further amendment, the New Zealand Constitution Amendment Act 1973, expanded the territorial jurisdiction of New Zealand&#x27;s parliament.

In 1986 a new Constitution Act was passed, finally removing the power for the British Parliament to pass laws affecting New Zealand (which was by then only with New Zealand&#x27;s consent), restating the few remaining provisions of the 1852 Act, consolidating the legislation establishing Parliament, and officially replacing the name &quot;General Assembly&quot; with &quot;Parliament&quot;.

Beginning in the 1890s, when the New Zealand Liberal Party was established as the first formal political party in New Zealand, political power shifted from the House of Representatives to elections, parties and leaders. The conservative Reform Party was formed in 1909, and the New Zealand Labour Party in 1916. The New Zealand National Party emerged in 1936 from the amalgamation of Reform and a remnant of the Liberals, the United Party. , are National, Labour, Green, ACT, Te Pāti Māori, and New Zealand First.

Labour Member of Parliament Whetu Tirikatene-Sullivan was the longest-serving female MP (1967–1996) and was also the first MP to give birth while serving in office. National MP Ruth Richardson was the first MP to bring her baby into the debating chamber while fellow National MP Katherine Rich was the first MP to feed her baby in the House. During the 1990s, a child care centre was established for the children of MPs and parliamentary staff. In November 2017, the Speaker of the House Trevor Mallard announced that Parliament would becoming more &quot;baby friendly.&quot; Family friendly policies have included making an atrium near the parliamentary chamber accessible to MP&#x27;s children, giving carers and spouses the same security clearances as MPs, opening the Parliamentary swimming pool to the families of MPs and staff, and updating the family room to have baby-feeding and changing facilities, and a play area on Parliament&#x27;s lawn.
On 10 February 2021, Mallard announced that ties were no longer compulsory in Parliament following a Standing Orders meeting where the majority voted in favour of Te Pāti Māori&#x27;s submission calling for the elimination of neckties as part of Parliament&#x27;s compulsory business attire. This announcement followed an argument between Mallard and Te Pāti Māori co-leader Rawiri Waititi, who had been ejected from Parliament for refusing to wear a neck tie in favour of Māori business attire.

In 2024, the 2023 Standing Orders introduced two new &quot;scrutiny weeks&quot; to the Parliamentary calendar, which allows select committees to scrutinise government and public sector spending plans. The first scrutiny week for the 2024 year was held between 17 and 21 June while the second is scheduled to be held on 2 and 6 December 2024.

==Sovereignty==
Based on the Westminster system, the New Zealand Parliament is supreme, with no other government institution able to override its decisions. As such, legislative action is not justiciable—it cannot be challenged by the judiciary. The ability of Parliament to act is, legally, unimpeded. For example, the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 is a normal piece of legislation, not superior law, as codified constitutions are in some other countries.

The House of Representatives has the exclusive power to regulate its own procedures. The House has entrenched certain issues relating to elections. These include the length of a parliamentary term, deciding on who can vote, how they vote (via secret ballot), how the country should be divided into electorates, and the make-up of the Representation Commission, which decides on these electorates. These issues require either 75% of all MPs to support the bill or a referendum on the issue. As the entrenchment mechanism is not entrenched itself, it could be repealed by a simple majority, thus allowing the entrenched provisions of the Electoral Act to also be repealed by a simple majority.

==Monarch==

The monarch of New Zealand – currently King Charles III, represented in New Zealand by the governor-general, currently Dame Cindy Kiro – is one of the components of Parliament. This results from the role of the monarch to sign into law (i.e. give royal assent to) the bills that have been passed by the House of Representatives. MPs must make an oath or affirmation of allegiance to the monarch before they may take their seat, and the official opposition is traditionally dubbed &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Loyal Opposition&quot;.

==Houses==
===House of Representatives===


The House of Representatives was established as a lower house and has been the Parliament&#x27;s sole house since 1951. Since the introduction of MMP in 1996, the House consists of 120 members of Parliament (MPs), elected to a three-year term. Parliamentary elections use the mixed-member proportional (MMP) system, a hybrid of first-past-the-post and closed party-list proportional representation; 71 MPs represent single-member electorates of roughly the same population, while the remainder are list MPs. These MPs assemble to represent the people, pass laws and supervise the work of government. Members also form select committees of the House, appointed to deal with particular areas or issues.

Ministers in the New Zealand Government are drawn from amongst the members of the House of Representatives (with the possible exception of brief periods following an election). The government of the day, and by extension the prime minister, must achieve and maintain the support of the House in order to gain and remain in power. The Government is dependent on Parliament to implement its legislative agenda, and has always required the House&#x27;s approval to spend money.

===Upper house===
The Parliament does not have an upper house; there was an upper house up to 1951, and there have been occasional suggestions to create a new one. The Legislative Council chamber continues to be used during the Opening of Parliament. This is in keeping with the British tradition in which the monarch is barred from entering the lower house.

====Legislative Council====
The original Legislative Council was created by the &quot;Charter for Erecting the Colony of New Zealand&quot; on 16 November 1840, which saw New Zealand established as a Crown colony separate from New South Wales on 1 July 1841. Originally, the Legislative Council consisted of the governor, colonial secretary and colonial treasurer (who comprised the Executive Council), and three justices of the peace appointed by the governor. The Legislative Council had the power to issue ordinances (statutory instruments).

With the passing of the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, the Legislative Council was reconstituted as the upper house of the General Assembly. The Council was intended to scrutinise and amend bills passed by the House of Representatives, although it could not initiate legislation or amend money bills. Despite occasional proposals for an elected Council, members of the Legislative Council (MLCs) were appointed by the governor, generally on the recommendation of the prime minister. It was eventually decided that the Council was having no significant impact on New Zealand&#x27;s legislative process; its final sitting was on 1 December 1950.

====Senate proposals====
In September 1950, the National government of Sidney Holland set up a constitutional reform committee to consider an alternative second chamber, chaired by Ronald Algie. A report produced by the committee in 1952 proposed a nominated Senate, with 32 members, appointed by leaders of the parties in the House of Representatives according to the parties&#x27; strength in that House. Senators would serve for three-year-terms, and be eligible for reappointment. The Senate would have the power to revise, initiate or delay legislation, to hear petitions, and to scrutinise regulations and Orders in Council, but the proposal was rejected by the Prime Minister and by the Labour opposition, which had refused to nominate members to the committee.

After the 1990 election, the National government of Jim Bolger proposed the establishment of an elected Senate, thereby reinstating a bicameral system, and a Senate Bill was drafted. Under the Bill, the Senate would have 30 members, elected by STV, from six senatorial districts, four in the North Island and two in the South Island. Like the old Legislative Council it would not have powers to amend or delay money bills. The intention was to include a question on a Senate in the second referendum on electoral reform. Voters would be asked, if they did not want a new voting system, whether or not they wanted a Senate. However, following objections from the Labour opposition, which derided it as a red herring, and other supporters of the mixed-member proportional (MMP) representation system, the Senate question was removed by the Select Committee on Electoral Reform.

In 2010, the New Zealand Policy Unit of the Centre for Independent Studies proposed a Senate in the context of the 2011 referendum on MMP. They proposed a proportionally-elected upper house made up 31 seats elected using a proportional list vote by region, with the House of Representatives elected by FPP and consisting of 79 seats.

==Term==

A term of Parliament in New Zealand may not last more than three years. The Constitution Act 1986 outlines that the governor-general is responsible for dissolving Parliament, which is done by royal proclamation. Dissolution ends a parliamentary term, after which the writ for a general election is issued. Upon completion of the election, the governor-general, on the advice of the prime minister, then issues a proclamation summoning Parliament to assemble. On the date given, new MPs are sworn in and then are, along with returning MPs, called to the old Legislative Council chamber, where they are instructed to elect their speaker and return to the House of Representatives to do so before adjourning.

A new parliamentary session is marked by the Opening of Parliament, during which the governor-general reads the Speech from the Throne, on the King&#x27;s behalf. This speech is given at the start of every new Parliament, and explains why Parliament has been assembled. It outlines the Government&#x27;s legislative agenda. On occasion, the monarch may open Parliament and personally deliver the speech; for example, Queen Elizabeth II personally attended the Opening of Parliament in 1954 (to mark the legislature&#x27;s centenary), and more recently in 1986 and 1990.

MPs receive the royal summons to these events from the usher of the Black Rod, after the usher knocks on the doors of the House of Representatives chamber that have been slammed shut, to illustrate the MPs&#x27; right to deny entry to anyone, including the monarch.

==Passage of legislation==

Before any law is passed, it is first introduced in Parliament as a draft known as a bill. The majority of bills are promulgated by the government of the day. It is rare for government bills to be defeated (the first to be defeated in the 20th century was in 1998). It is also possible for individual MPs to promote their own bills, called members&#x27; bills; these are usually put forward by opposition parties, or by MPs who wish to deal with a matter that parties do not take positions on. All bills must go through three readings in the House of Representatives before receiving the royal assent to become an act of Parliament (see &quot;lists of acts of the New Zealand Parliament&quot;).

===House and committees===

Each bill goes through several stages before it becomes a law. The first stage is the first reading, where MPs debate the bill in principle. It is normally sent to a select committee where the public has the opportunity to make submissions on the bill and the committee can recommend amendments to the bill. The select committee stage is followed by the second reading, where MPs again debate the bill in principle and the select committee recommendations. This is followed by the committee of the whole house, where MPs debate individual clauses or parts and make amendments. In the third reading, MPs debate the final form of the bill. If a majority of MPs vote in favour of the bill at its third reading, the bill is passed. If a majority of MPs vote against the bill at any reading, the bill is rejected and goes no further through the process.

===Royal Assent===
If a bill passes its third reading, it is delivered to the governor-general by the clerk of the House of Representatives, who, assuming that constitutional convention is followed, will grant royal assent as a matter of course. Some constitutional lawyers, such as Professor Philip Joseph, believe the governor-general does retain the power to refuse royal assent to bills in exceptional circumstances—specifically if democracy were to be abolished. Others, such as former law professor and Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer and Professor Matthew Palmer argue any refusal of royal assent would cause a constitutional crisis.

As a practical reality, because the royal assent to a bill must follow quickly after its passage by the House of Representatives, if there is any substantial issue about the constitutional validity of a bill, the issue must be considered by the attorney-general before the bill is introduced into the House.

<text>Lindos (; ) is an archaeological site, a fishing village and a former municipality on the island of Rhodes, in the Dodecanese, Greece. Since the 2011 local government reform, it is part of the municipality Rhodes, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 178.9 km2. It lies on the east coast of the island. It is about 40 km south of the city of Rhodes and its fine beaches make it a popular tourist and holiday destination. Lindos is situated in a large bay and faces the fishing village and small resort of Charaki.

==History==

According to myth, Lindos was founded by the Dorians led by the king Tlepolemus of Rhodes, who arrived in about the 10th century BC. It was one of six Dorian cities in the area known as the Dorian Hexapolis. The eastern location of Rhodes made it a natural meeting place between the Greeks and the Phoenicians, and by the 8th century Lindos was a major trading centre. In the 6th century it was ruled by Cleobulus, one of the Seven Sages of Greece. The importance of Lindos declined after the foundation of the city of Rhodes in the late 5th century BC.

In classical times the acropolis of Lindos was dominated by the massive temple of Athena Lindia, which attained its final form in around 300 BC. In Hellenistic and Roman times the temple precinct grew as more buildings were added. In early medieval times these buildings fell into disuse, and in the 14th century they were partly overlaid by a large fortress built on the acropolis by the Knights of St John to defend the island against the Ottomans.

==Acropolis==

Above the modern town rises the acropolis of Lindos, a natural citadel which was fortified successively by the Greeks, the Romans, the Byzantines, the Knights of St John and the Ottomans. This makes the site difficult to excavate and interpret archaeologically. The acropolis has views of the surrounding harbours and coastline.

On the acropolis of Lindos today parts of the following buildings may still be seen:
* The Doric Temple of Athena Lindia, dating from about 300 BC, built on the site of an earlier temple. Inside the temple is the table of offerings and the base of the cult statue of Athena.
* The Propylaea of the Sanctuary, also dating from the 4th century BC. A monumental staircase leads to a D-shaped stoa and a wall with five door openings.
* The Hellenistic stoa with lateral projecting wings, dating from about 200 BC. The stoa was 87 metres long and consisted of 42 columns.
* The well-known relief of a Rhodian trireme (warship) cut into the rock at the foot of the steps leading to the acropolis. On the bow stood a statue of General Hagesander, the work of the sculptor Pythokritos. The relief dates from about 180 BC.
* The Hellenistic staircase (2nd century BC) leading to the main archaeological area of the acropolis.
* Remains of a Roman temple, possibly dedicated to the Emperor Diocletian and dating from about 300 AD.
* The Acropolis is surrounded by a Hellenistic wall contemporary with the Propylaea and the stairway leading to the entrance to the site. A Roman inscription says that the wall and square towers were repaired at the expense of P Aelius Hagetor, the priest of Athena in the 2nd century AD.
* The Castle of the Knights of St John, built some time before 1317 on the foundations of older Byzantine fortifications. The walls and towers follow the natural conformation of the cliff. A pentagonal tower on the south side commanded the harbour, the settlement and the road from the south of the island. There was a large round tower on the east facing the sea and two more, one round and the other on a corner, on the northeast side of the enceinte. Today one of the towers at the southwest corner and one to the west survive.
* The Greek Orthodox Church of St John, dating from the 13th or 14th century and built on the ruins of a previous church, which may have been built as early as the 6th century.

Some scenes of the well-known film, &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot;, were filmed here.

==Excavations==
Excavations were carried out at Lindos in the years 1900 to 1914 by the Carlsberg Institute of Denmark, directed by Karl Frederik Kinch and Christian Blinkenberg. The acropolis site was excavated down to bedrock and the foundations of all the buildings were uncovered.

During the Italian occupation of the island (1912–1945) major restoration work was carried out on the Lindos acropolis, but it was poorly done and was harmful to the historic record. The north-east side of the Temple of Athena was restored. The monumental staircase to the propylaea was rebuilt and many of the columns of the Hellenistic stoa were re-erected. Large surfaces were covered with concrete. Bases and inscribed blocks were taken from their locations and placed along the restored walls.

Judged by modern standards, this work took insufficient note of the evidence available from the excavations and in its methods did damage to the remains themselves. In recent years Greek and international archaeologists under the supervision of the Greek Ministry of Culture have been working to restore and protect the ancient buildings on the site.

==Climate==
Lindos has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: Csa) strongly influenced by the Mediterranean Sea. Lindos has mild winters and particularly hot and dry summers while rain falls mostly in the winter. Lindos has an annual average temperature of around and is Greece&#x27;s warmest area annually. In August 2021, the National Observatory of Athens station in Lindos registered the all-time highest mean monthly temperature in Europe. Also, during the summer of 2024, Lindos recorded the highest average summer temperature in Europe with . Moreover, according to the Hellenic National Meteorological Service SE Rhodes, where Lindos is near, registers the highest mean annual sunshine in Greece with over 3.100 hours.

<text>The Eurasian plate is a tectonic plate that includes most of Eurasia (a landmass consisting of the traditional continents of Asia and Europe), with the notable exceptions of the Arabian Peninsula, the Indian subcontinent, and the area east of the Chersky Range in eastern Siberia. It also includes oceanic crust extending westward to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and northward to the Gakkel Ridge.

==Boundaries==
The western edge is a triple junction plate boundary with the North American plate and Nubian plate at the seismically active Azores triple junction extending northward along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge towards Iceland. Ridges like the Mid-Atlantic ridge form at a divergent plate boundary. They are located deep underwater and very difficult to study. Scientists know less about ocean ridges than they do the planets of the solar system.

There is another triple junction where the Eurasian plate meets the Anatolian sub-plate and the Arabian plate. The Anatolian sub-plate is currently being squeezed by the collision of the Eurasian plate with the Arabian plate in the East Anatolian Fault Zone.

The boundary between the North American plate and the Eurasian plate in the area around Japan has been described as &quot;shifty&quot;. There are different maps for it based on recent tectonics, seismicity and earthquake focal mechanism. The simplest plate geometry draws the boundary from the Nansen Ridge through a broad zone of deformation in North Asia to the Sea of Okhotsk then south through Sakhalin Island and Hokkaido to the triple junction in the Japan Trench. But this simple view has been successfully challenged by more recent research. During the 1970s, Japan was thought to be located on the Eurasian plate at a quadruple junction with the North American plate when the eastern boundary of the North American plate was drawn through southern Hokkaido. New research in the 1990s supported that the Okhotsk microplate was independent from the North American plate and a boundary with the Amurian microplate, sometimes described as &quot;a division within the Eurasian plate&quot; with an unknown western boundary.

All volcanic eruptions in Iceland, such as the 1973 eruption of Eldfell, the 1783 eruption of Laki and the 2010 eruption of Eyjafjallajökull, are caused by the North American and the Eurasian plates moving apart, which is a result of divergent plate boundary forces.

The convergent boundary between the Eurasian plate and the Indian plate formed the Himalayas mountain range.
The geodynamics of Central Asia is dominated by the interaction between the Eurasian plate and the Indian plate. In this area, many sub-plates or crust blocks have been recognized, which form the Central Asian and the East Asian transit zones.

<text>Paul Reiser (; born March 30, 1956) is an American actor, comedian, and writer. He played the roles of Michael Taylor in the 1980s sitcom &quot;My Two Dads&quot;, Paul Buchman in the NBC sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;, Modell in the 1982 film &quot;Diner&quot;, and Detective Jeffrey Friedman in the &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; franchise. He has gained recognition for his roles as Jim Neiman in the 2014 film &quot;Whiplash&quot; and Dr. Sam Owens in the Netflix series &quot;Stranger Things&quot;.

Reiser portrayed Carter Burke in James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Aliens&quot;. He appeared in the second and third seasons of &quot;The Kominsky Method&quot; as Martin, Mindy Kominsky&#x27;s boyfriend.

Reiser is ranked 77th on Comedy Central&#x27;s 2004 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time&quot;. The name of his production company, Nuance Productions, is inspired by one of his lines in the film &quot;Diner&quot;, where his character explains his discomfort with the word &quot;nuance&quot;.

==Early life==
Reiser was born in New York City in 1956, the son of Helen Hollinger Reiser (1919–2012), a homemaker who was one of the first women to graduate from Baruch College; and Samuel H. Reiser (1914–1989), a wholesale health food distributor who served in the military. His family is of Romanian Jewish descent. He has three sisters. He attended the East Side Hebrew Institute and graduated from Stuyvesant High School. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Binghamton University, where he majored in music (piano, composition).

During his university years, Reiser was active in student theater productions at the Hinman Little Theater, an on-campus community theater organization in Hinman College, Reiser&#x27;s dorm community. He found his calling as a comedian while performing in New York clubs during university summer breaks.

==Career==

After developing his skills as a stand-up comedian, Reiser had a breakout film role in 1982 when he appeared in &quot;Diner&quot;, a coming-of-age film directed by Barry Levinson. Reiser&#x27;s character, Modell, a closet stand-up comedian, effectively brought Reiser&#x27;s abilities to the attention of Hollywood. He followed this success playing a detective in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot; (1984), a role he reprised in its sequel &quot;Beverly Hills Cop II&quot; (1987), and again in &quot;Beverly Hills Cop: Axel F&quot;. Reiser also appeared in James Cameron&#x27;s &quot;Aliens&quot; (1986), in which he played the villainous Carter Burke; and in &quot;The Marrying Man&quot; (1991) and &quot;Bye Bye Love&quot; (1995).

Reiser starred as one of two possible fathers of a teenage girl in the TV sitcom &quot;My Two Dads&quot; (1987–90), and later came to prominence in North America as Paul Buchman in &quot;Mad About You&quot; (1992–99), a comedy series he co-created, in which Helen Hunt co-starred as his on-screen wife. He was also the co-composer of the show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;The Final Frontier&quot; (with Don Was), and performed the piano for the theme&#x27;s recording. Reiser&#x27;s role in &quot;Mad About You&quot; earned nominations for an Emmy, a Golden Globe, an American Comedy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award for him. For the show&#x27;s final season, Reiser and Hunt received $1 million ($ million today) per episode. After signing onto a &quot;Mad About You&quot; revival in 2018, it was picked up as a 12-episode limited series by Spectrum Originals in March 2019, which became available for members of Amazon Prime Video as of fall 2020.

In 2001, Reiser played a dramatic role as a man desperate to locate his biological mother, after learning he has a serious illness, in the British TV film &quot;My Beautiful Son&quot;. In 2002, Reiser made a guest appearance as himself on Larry David&#x27;s HBO sitcom, &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm.&quot; In the TV comedy film &quot;Atlanta&quot; (2007), Reiser appears as one half of a couple who, after meeting at a funeral, are unable to stay away from each other. In 2010, Reiser collaborated with the singer Julia Fordham to create a CD album titled &quot;Unusual Suspects&quot;, which includes the song &quot;UnSung Hero&quot;, dedicated to American soldiers serving in Afghanistan. The two embarked on an acoustic tour after its release. Reiser also co-wrote the song, &quot;No There There&quot; with Melissa Manchester for her 2015 album, &quot;You Gotta Love the Life&quot;. Early in his career, Reiser was the opening act for Manchester, who warned him that music audiences can be rough on comedians and that the last comedian that opened for her left the stage in tears. Reiser reflects about this warning and on how he then bombed at the Concord Hotel in the chapter &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry if They Suck&quot; in &quot;I Killed: True Stories of the Road from America&#x27;s Top Comics&quot; (2010), by Ritch Shydner and Mark Schiff.
Reiser scripted and starred in the semi-autobiographical comedy series &quot;The Paul Reiser Show&quot;, which aired on NBC as a mid-season replacement during the 2010–11 TV season. &quot;This is nice&quot;, commented Reiser on the Stephanie Miller radio program, &quot;because you get to sit around and root for other shows to fail.&quot; However, due to the lack of lead time and promotion by NBC prior to its debut (as well as poor scheduling), the low-rated show was canceled on April 22, 2011, with only two episodes aired. He co-created (but did not star in) the 2017 dramedy &quot;There&#x27;s... Johnny!&quot;, set backstage at &quot;The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson&quot; in 1972. Originally created for Seeso, the seven-episode season was released on Hulu after Seeso&#x27;s collapse. In recent years Reiser has appeared in films such as &quot;Whiplash&quot; and TV series such as &quot;Red Oaks,&quot; &quot;Stranger Things&quot; and &quot;The Boys&quot;.

Reiser has written three books: &quot;Couplehood&quot;, about the ups and downs of being in a committed relationship; &quot;Babyhood&quot;, about his experiences as a first-time father; and &quot;Familyhood&quot; (released in May 2011), a collection of humorous essays. &quot;Couplehood&quot; is unique in that it starts on page 145; Reiser explained this as his method of giving the reader a false sense of accomplishment. In 1996, Reiser appeared on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in the middle of writing &quot;Babyhood&quot;. Since he had not yet decided on a title, he presented a prop book, titled simply &quot;Book&quot; and with the same cover as that of &quot;Couplehood&quot;. The term olive theory was first coined in &quot;Couplehood&quot;.

In 2022, Reiser appeared in the third season of &quot;The Boys&quot; as The Legend, and will reprise his role in the fifth season.

In 2024, Reiser will revisit his &quot;Aliens&quot; character for a new Marvel comic titled &quot;Aliens: What If...?&quot; which will explore what could have happened if Carter Burke survived the events of Hadley&#x27;s Hope. The book is co-written by his son, Leon Reiser, with art by Guiu Vilanova.

==Personal life==
Reiser married Paula Ravets on August 21, 1988. They have two sons: born in 1995 and 2000. His older son has cerebral palsy, which Reiser has spoken about publicly at fundraisers and other events. 

Reiser is the cousin of screenwriter and producer Will Reiser, who wrote the semi-autobiographical comedy-drama film &quot;50/50&quot; (2011).

Reiser&#x27;s first cousin is the legal scholar Richard Epstein.

<doc id="340665" wikidata="Q2609497" url="?curid=340665" title="F-Zero X">
<text>is a 1998 futuristic racing video game for the Nintendo 64 console, developed and published by Nintendo. It is a sequel to the original &quot;F-Zero&quot; (1990), and is the first &quot;F-Zero&quot; installment with 3D graphics. The game has a steep learning curve and its gameplay experience is similar to that of the original. An &quot;Expansion Kit&quot;, including a track and vehicle editor, was released in Japan in 2000.

&quot;F-Zero X&quot; introduced the ability to attack other racers, a Death Race mode, and a random track generator called the &quot;X Cup&quot;. In the Death Race, the player&#x27;s objective is to rapidly annihilate or pass the 29 other racers, and the X-Cup generates a different set of tracks each time played. Critics generally praised &quot;F-Zero X&quot; for its fast gameplay, abundance of courses and vehicles, track design, and maintaining a high framerate, although it has been widely criticized for its lack of graphical detail. &quot;F-Zero X&quot; was ported in 2004 to the iQue Player and had re-releases through the Virtual Console for Wii in 2007, later on Wii U, and through Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack, featuring online multiplayer, in 2022.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;F-Zero X&quot; is a fast-paced futuristic racing video game where 30 competitors race on high-altitude circuits inside plasma-powered hovercars in an intergalactic . Taking place after the original tournament was discontinued for several years due to the extreme danger of the sport, &quot;F-Zero X&quot; begins after the Grand Prix is brought back with the rules and regulations revised under the same name as the video game. The tracks include hills, loops, tunnels, corkscrews, and pipes. Players can drift into turns without losing momentum by using the control stick and trigger button. The game introduces 26 new vehicles, and reprises the 4 from the original &quot;F-Zero&quot; game. Each has its own performance abilities affected by its size and weight, and a grip, boost, and durability trait graded on an A to E (best to worst) scale. Before a race, players are able to adjust a vehicle&#x27;s balance between maximum acceleration and maximum top speed.

Each machine&#x27;s energy meter measures the machine&#x27;s health and is decreased, for example, when the machine hits another racer or the side of the track. This is also a boost meter for manually boosting, usually starting with the second lap of a race. Energy can be replenished by driving over recharge strips, located at various points around the track. The game introduces the ability to attack other racers with either a side or spin attack. Dash plates in various locations give a speed boost without using any energy. Courses may have obstacles that reduce speed and traps that launch vehicles into the air, reducing its energy. If the player has a &quot;spare machine&quot;—the equivalent of an extra life—then falls off a track or runs out of energy, the race can be restarted. Players get an additional spare machine for every 5 contenders eliminated.

=== Race modes ===
&quot;F-Zero X&quot; has 5 different gameplay modes: GP (Grand Prix) Race, Practice, Time Attack, Death Race, and VS Battle. In GP Race, the player races against 29 opponents through 3 laps of each track in a cup. Players get a certain number of points for finishing a track depending on where they placed, and the winner of the cup is the character who receives the most total points. Each cup has 4 selectable difficulty levels: Novice, Standard, Expert, and Master. The higher the difficulty level selected, the tougher the opponents, and less spare machines the player starts with. Furthermore, the 3 cups initially available are ordered by increasing difficulty (Jack, Queen, and King respectively) and 6 tracks each. Eventually, the player can unlock the Joker Cup with its set of 6 tracks, followed by the X Cup. The X Cup is a set of 6 tracks that are randomly generated on each playthrough. The randomized track elements lack loops and can be simplistic, but others are intricate.

Practice mode demonstrates any track with opponents. Time Attack lets the player choose a track and complete a 3-lap race in the shortest time possible. Transparent re-enactments of Time Attack performances, allow racing against ghost racers, recorded by the player or game developer. Up to 3 player-contributed ghosts can be raced against simultaneously, but only 1 can be saved per track. Death Race has the player annihilating the 29 other racers as speedily as possible on a specialized course. There is no selectable difficulty level, or set number of laps, but the boost is immediately available. Vs. Battle is the multiplayer mode where 2 to 4 players compete in a 3-lap race, and slots not in use by players can be operated by the artificial intelligence. A slot machine for those out of the race early will appear if the option is enabled. Players can adversely affect the energy levels of those still competing by matching symbols.

== Development and release==
In mid-1996, during &quot;Mario Kart 64&quot; development, Shigeru Miyamoto said he planned a sequel to &quot;F-Zero&quot; for the Nintendo 64. Initially titled &quot;F-Zero 64&quot;, &quot;Famitsu&quot; magazine revealed the project in mid-1997. Tadashi Sugiyama and Shigeru Miyamoto served as director and producer, respectively. Taro Bando and Hajime Wakai served as composers. Several key &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; programmers including the lead programmer made up the in-house development team. Developed by Nintendo EAD, it is a sequel to the original &quot;F-Zero&quot; (1990), and is the first &quot;F-Zero&quot; installment with 3D graphics. The game debuted at the Nintendo Space World event on November 20, 1997, publicly playable for the first time. IGN reported this version was 60% complete and consistently ran at 60 frames per second. That frame rate goal required developers to minimize background detail, texture detail, and polygon count on vehicles which reduce as they pass. They noted that &quot;[tracks] hide most of the limited backgrounds with their girth and undulating nature which block out almost everything else.&quot; Fogging effects are used to hide background shortcomings such as where the sky and ground meet.

The character voices in the game, including the announcer, Mr. Zero, were provided by Jim Wornell and Kayomi McDonald. Wornell based Mr. Zero&#x27;s voice on that of the announcer in &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;. The soundtrack includes remixes from its predecessor. including a half-sized monaural soundtrack and real-time stereo ambient effects. Some of its music is included in two soundtrack CDs. The &quot;F-Zero X Original Soundtrack&quot; was released on September 18, 1998, with 29 musical tracks. The &quot;F-Zero X Guitar Arrange Edition&quot; was released on January 27, 1999, with ten guitar arrangements. The game was released in Japan on July 14, 1998, but its North American release suffered a three-month delay due to Nintendo&#x27;s policy of evenly spacing the release of first-party games. It was released in North America on October 27, in Europe on November 6, and in China for the iQue Player on February 25, 2004. It was re-released on the Wii and Wii U Virtual Console in 2007 and around 2016, respectively. This was Europe&#x27;s 100th Wii Virtual Console game. A March 2022 re-release to Nintendo Switch Online Expansion Pack members has a 2 to 4-person online multiplayer mode.

=== &quot;Expansion Kit&quot; ===
The 64DD is a peripheral for the Nintendo 64, released only in Japan, The &quot;F-Zero X Expansion Kit&quot; is the 64DD&#x27;s first expansion disk, released on April 21, 2000, in Japan. It contains 12 new tracks, a machine creator, a course editor, and new stereophonic soundtracks. In addition to these 2 new cups, players can create a custom cup. The disk can save up to a 100 tracks and up to 3 ghost data per course. IGN singled out the course editor as the &quot;Expansion Kit&quot;″s strongest feature because the designers used a similar tool in-house for the original circuits. The machine creator&#x27;s variety of options on pre-existing parts, can be used to balance the creations&#x27; settings and performance abilities, and name the machine. The course editor allows the player to design racing circuits with detailed tracks. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout, and draw curves and hills. The player can add half pipes, cylinders, and numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.

The &quot;Expansion Kit&quot; disk requires the cartridge, which was programmed with &quot;64DD hooks&quot; to detect the 64DD and expansion disk. This provisions the possibility of many disk-based expansion packs such as track editors or course updates, but no more were made, and this one was not utilized outside Japan due to the 64DD&#x27;s commercial failure.

== Reception ==
Critical reception of &quot;F-Zero X&quot; was overall positive. The game has an aggregate average of 87.61% based on 15 reviews at GameRankings, and a metascore of 85 at Metacritic. Critics generally praised its fast gameplay, abundance of courses and vehicles, keeping a high framerate with up to thirty racers on screen at the same time, and track design. However, the lack of graphical detail has been widely criticized. Peer Schneider of &quot;IGN&quot; described the gameplay as &quot;god-like&quot;, &quot;hair-splitting&quot; speed; and he considered the game to rival its predecessor &quot;Wave Race 64&quot; with its &quot;perfectly fine-tuned controls and a fresh approach to racing&quot;. It received the Game of the Month award for November 1998 from &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. An editor stated that &quot;the graphics may be simple, but they&#x27;re smooth and the action is fast&quot;.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; stated: &quot;From the rocking guitar tunes (courtesy of the same composer who created the original&#x27;s music) to the insanely addictive Grand Prix races, the game is a blast.&quot;

&quot;Allgame&quot; described the graphical detail as &quot;certainly not up to Nintendo&#x27;s usual standards&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; criticized the low polygon count on the vehicles &quot;particularly uninspiring&quot; and saying that the &quot;track detail is also very limited, giving the track a spartan feel to it&quot;. Although the optimizations are strict, critics exalted the steady rate of 60 frames per second, which some thought made up for the lack of graphical detail with little room for improvement. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; found the framerate to give &quot;the game a major boost in the feel department [making it] seem like your vehicle is bursting through the sound barrier&quot;. According to &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;F-Zero X&quot; became the first racing game to run at 60 frames per second with up to 30 vehicles on screen at the same time, but in order to keep the frame rate, polygon counts on the vehicles, textures and track detail are sacrificed.

&quot;EGM&quot; considered the music &quot;really good with some excellent remixes of the old &quot;F-Zero&quot; tunes&quot;, and &quot;CVG&quot; called the music dreadful. &quot;The Electric Playground&quot; said it goes hand-in-hand to the simulation of speed in the game, but that &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t in a million years buy music like this to listen to&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s retrospective review gave it 6.5/10, calling it &quot;the black sheep of the series&quot; when compared with the other &quot;F-Zero&quot; games in &quot;visual style and technical flair&quot;. &quot;IGN&quot; described it as an exceptional update to the original game that &quot;only suffers under its generic look&quot;. Peer Schneider believed that unlike the original, it &quot;is not about showing off graphics or sound capabilitiesit&#x27;s all about gameplay&quot;.

In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; praised the game, ranking it 39th on a list of greatest Nintendo games.

Nintendo sold 383,642 units of &quot;F-Zero X&quot; in North America and 97,684 units in Japan. In its first week of sale in Japan, 56,457 copies were sold, but only about one fifth of that in the following week reportedly due to the Nintendo 64 having had a small dedicated fanbase there.

&quot;F-Zero X&quot; was named as a finalist by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences for &quot;Console Racing Game of the Year&quot; during the 2nd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

<doc id="340667" wikidata="Q2150634" url="?curid=340667" title="Richard Squires">
<text>Sir Richard Anderson Squires KCMG (January 18, 1880 – March 26, 1940) was the Prime Minister of Newfoundland from 1919 to 1923 and from 1928 to 1932.

As prime minister, Squires attempted to reform Newfoundland&#x27;s fishing industry, but failed at doing so. He also attempted to diversify Newfoundland&#x27;s economy. However, his two tenures as prime minister were both marred by serious corruption. He lost the position in 1923 after an arrest for bribery. In 1932, he narrowly escaped a riot, which forced him from power, and ended democracy in Newfoundland.

While Squires retired after the riot, he continued to campaign against rule by the British Crown under the Commission of Government. He died in 1940, at the age of 60.

==Early career==
Squires was born in Harbour Grace, Newfoundland in 1880. He started out practising law in St. John&#x27;s. He served as a member in the government of Edward Patrick Morris from 1913 to 1918. In 1919, Squires started a campaign for the vacant leadership of the Liberal Party. He won the leadership over William Warren.

==Prime minister==
Squires won the election of 1919 over Sir Michael Cashin of the Newfoundland People&#x27;s Party (later called the &quot;Liberal-Labour-Progressive Party&quot;). He did this by forming an alliance with the Fisherman&#x27;s Protective Union of William Coaker under the name of the &quot;Liberal Reform Party&quot;.

During his first government, Squires started the development of the Humber River. He also attempted many reforms suggested by Coaker. These reforms would have regulated the fishery but failed because of a collapse in fish prices which was blamed on Coaker&#x27;s reforms.

Squires&#x27;s government attempted to diversify the economy and, to this end, financially assisted the failing transinsular railway operated by the Reid Newfoundland Company, finally nationalizing the railway in 1923.

==Fall from power==
Squires&#x27;s government was accused of using bribes to win the 1923 General Election. A cabinet minister, Dr. Alex A. Campbell, was in the centre of the scandal. Several other cabinet members demanded Campbell be forced to resign. When Squires refused they said they would cross the floor. The Attorney General William Warren issued an arrest warrant for Squires. Squires was arrested and later released on bond. He then resigned as prime minister.

==Opposition==
Squires remained in the House of Assembly, as an independent member. In the next year, Newfoundland saw four governments fall. It was not until Walter Monroe won the 1924 election that stability was restored. Squires remained in the background working on a possible return to power. In 1928, Walter Monroe resigned as prime minister and was replaced by his cousin Frederick C. Alderdice. In the election of 1928, Squires returned as Liberal leader and defeated the Conservatives.

==Governing in the Depression==
His next government started out well, seeing the election of his wife Helena Squires as the first woman to sit in the House of Assembly. However, Newfoundland was struck hard by the Great Depression; fish prices fell and an already severe public debt worsened. In 1932 Canada refused his request to join the Canadian Confederation.

Widespread unemployment caused by the Great Depression and allegations of corruption against Squires and his government along with the government&#x27;s inability to deal with the economic crisis created widespread discontent and political instability.

In 1932, Squires&#x27;s finance minister, Peter John Cashin, resigned from the executive council accusing his fellow cabinet ministers of widespread corruption and Squires himself of having falsified council minutes to hide the fact that he had been receiving secret payments out of public funds. Cashin&#x27;s charge inflamed a public which had already been seized by discontent due to the deteriorating economic situation in the country.

On April 5, 1932, a large parade was organized by the opposition. They marched to the Colonial Building which was the seat of the House of Assembly. There were over 10,000 people at the protest and things got out of control, leading to the 1932 Colonial Building riot. 
The crowd got angry when no one came out to address them. After a short while, several people managed to break into the building. Squires and government members had to escape around the back. Squires was nearly caught trying to get into a cab; he got away only by running through a house on Colonial Street (near the Colonial Building) to a waiting cab on Bannerman Street.

==Fall from power==
Squires had little choice but to dissolve his government and call an election, the result of which was the defeat of the Liberal government and the loss of Squires&#x27;s own seat. The Liberals won only two seats out of 28. Alderdice, who was still leader of the opposition, came to power and went about putting into place a Commission of Government, ending democracy in Newfoundland until 1949, when Newfoundland joined Canada.

Squires retired but always remained active in his opposition to the Commission of Government. He died at the age of 60, in 1940.

At the time of his death he was Worshipful Grand Master of the Grand Orange Lodge of British America, one of the few democratic institutions operating during the Commission of Government period.

<text>Cercis is a genus of about 10 species in the subfamily Cercidoideae of the pea family Fabaceae. It contains small deciduous trees or large shrubs commonly known as redbuds in the USA. They are characterised by simple, rounded to heart-shaped leaves and pinkish-red flowers borne in the early spring on bare leafless shoots, on both branches and trunk (&quot;cauliflory&quot;). The genus contains ten species, native to warm temperate regions of North America, southern Europe, western and central Asia, and China.

Cercis is derived from the Greek word κερκις (&quot;kerkis&quot;) meaning &quot;weaver&#x27;s shuttle&quot;, which was applied by Theophrastus to &quot;C. siliquastrum&quot; due to the resemblance of the dry seed pod to a loom shuttle.

&quot;Cercis&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including mouse moth and &quot;Automeris io&quot; (both recorded on eastern redbud). The bark of &quot;C. chinensis&quot; has been used in Chinese medicine as an antiseptic.

&quot;Cercis&quot; fossils have been found that date to the Eocene.

==Species==
&quot;Cercis&quot; comprises the following species:



The Judas tree (&quot;Cercis siliquastrum&quot;) is 10–15 m tall tree native to the south of Europe and southwest Asia. It is found in Iberia, southern France, Italy, Bulgaria, Greece, and Asia Minor, and forms a low tree with a flat spreading head. In early spring it is covered with a profusion of magenta flowers which appear before the leaves. The flowers are edible and are sometimes eaten in a mixed salad or made into fritters with a flavor described as an agreeably acidic bite. The tree was frequently figured in the 16th and 17th-century herbals. It is said to be the tree from which Judas Iscariot hanged himself after betraying Christ, but the name may also derive from &quot;Judea&#x27;s tree&quot;, after the region encompassing Israel and Palestine where the tree is commonplace.

A smaller Eastern American woodland understory tree, the eastern redbud, &quot;Cercis canadensis&quot;, is common from southernmost Canada to Piedmont, Alabama, and East Texas. It differs from &quot;C. siliquastrum&quot; in its pointed leaves and slightly smaller size (rarely over 12 m tall). The flowers are also used in salads and for making pickled relish, while the inner bark of twigs gives a mustard-yellow dye. It is commonly grown as an ornamental.

The related western redbud, &quot;Cercis occidentalis&quot;, ranges from California east to Utah primarily in foothill regions. Its leaves are more rounded at the tip than the relatively heart-shaped leaves of the eastern redbud. The tree often forms multi-trunked colonies that are covered in bright pink flowers in early spring (February - March). White-flowered variants are in cultivation. It buds only once a year.

The species of &quot;Cercis&quot; in North America form a clade. Hopkins (1942) established a two-species system for North America which is still widely recognized. Alternatively, based on an exploratory morphometric analysis, Isely (1975)
inferred up to six separate entities (“phases”). Barneby (1989) recognized only one continental species and treated
all of western North American &quot;Cercis&quot; as &quot;C. canadensis var. orbiculata&quot;, but the justification was cursory and not definitive.
Morphometric studies of North American &quot;Cercis&quot; indicate that, although morphological variation is strongly correlated with geography across North America, considerable overlap in flower, fruit, and leaf characters limit their use for taxon delimitation.

In contrast to morphology, molecular phylogenetic analyses recover three geographically well-defined clades
within North America, with California &quot;Cercis&quot; forming a clade that is sister to a clade formed by Colorado Plateau and
eastern North American clades. Molecular dating suggests a divergence time among these three
clades of at least 12 million years. These clades were also inferred from a distance-based analysis of &quot;Cercis&quot; in the United States with isozyme data as reported in an unpublished Ph.D. dissertation (Ballenger 1992). On the basis of these
studies, &quot;Cercis&quot; is treated as comprising three species, with the Colorado Plateau and all Arizona specimens recognized
as &quot;C. orbiculata&quot;, distinct from &quot;C. occidentalis&quot; from California and &quot;C. canadensis&quot; from eastern North America. This
delimitation of species will also be employed for the treatment of the genus for Flora of North America (Ballenger and
Vincent, in preparation).

The chain-flowered redbud (&quot;Cercis racemosa&quot;) from western China is unusual in the genus in having its flowers in pendulous racemes, as in a Laburnum, rather than short clusters.

==Wood==
The wood is medium weight, somewhat brittle, of light tan color with a noticeably large heartwood area of darker brown, tinged with red.
The wood has attractive figuring and is used in wood turning, for making decorative items and in the production of wood veneer.

<text>The Three Jewels Temples (삼보사찰| Sambosachal) are the three principal Buddhist temples in Korea, each representing one of the Three Jewels of Buddhism, and all located in South Korea.

Tongdosa in South Gyeongsang Province represents the Buddha; Haeinsa, also in South Gyeongsang Province, represents the dharma or Buddhist teachings; and Songgwangsa in South Jeolla Province represents the sangha or Buddhist community.

In most Korean Buddhist temples, the highest, most important, and often largest building is the Mahavira Hall--the central hall containing statues of the historical Buddha and other important figures. In the Three Jewel Temples, however, the most important buildings are ones that emphasize each temple&#x27;s particular jewel. Thus, the main hall in Tongdosa opens out onto a stupa which the faithful claim contains relics of the Buddha; Haeinsa has two large buildings holding the &quot;Tripitaka Koreana&quot;; and Songgwangsa has several prominent buildings dedicated to its monastic community (including the numerous Seon (Zen) Masters the temple has produced).

<doc id="340678" wikidata="Q2122223" url="?curid=340678" title="Quantum group">
<text>In mathematics and theoretical physics, the term quantum group denotes one of a few different kinds of noncommutative algebras with additional structure. These include Drinfeld–Jimbo type quantum groups (which are quasitriangular Hopf algebras), compact matrix quantum groups (which are structures on unital separable C*-algebras), and bicrossproduct quantum groups. Despite their name, they do not themselves have a natural group structure, though they are in some sense &#x27;close&#x27; to a group.

The term &quot;quantum group&quot; first appeared in the theory of quantum integrable systems, which was then formalized by Vladimir Drinfeld and Michio Jimbo as a particular class of Hopf algebra. The same term is also used for other Hopf algebras that deform or are close to classical Lie groups or Lie algebras, such as a &quot;bicrossproduct&quot; class of quantum groups introduced by Shahn Majid a little after the work of Drinfeld and Jimbo.

In Drinfeld&#x27;s approach, quantum groups arise as Hopf algebras depending on an auxiliary parameter &quot;q&quot; or &quot;h&quot;, which become universal enveloping algebras of a certain Lie algebra, frequently semisimple or affine, when &quot;q&quot; = 1 or &quot;h&quot; = 0. Closely related are certain dual objects, also Hopf algebras and also called quantum groups, deforming the algebra of functions on the corresponding semisimple algebraic group or a compact Lie group.

== Intuitive meaning ==
The discovery of quantum groups was quite unexpected since it was known for a long time that compact groups and semisimple Lie algebras are &quot;rigid&quot; objects, in other words, they cannot be &quot;deformed&quot;. One of the ideas behind quantum groups is that if we consider a structure that is in a sense equivalent but larger, namely a group algebra or a universal enveloping algebra, then a group algebra or enveloping algebra can be &quot;deformed&quot;, although the deformation will no longer remain a group algebra or enveloping algebra. More precisely, deformation can be accomplished within the category of Hopf algebras that are not required to be either commutative or cocommutative. One can think of the deformed object as an algebra of functions on a &quot;noncommutative space&quot;, in the spirit of the noncommutative geometry of Alain Connes. This intuition, however, came after particular classes of quantum groups had already proved their usefulness in the study of the quantum Yang–Baxter equation and quantum inverse scattering method developed by the Leningrad School (Ludwig Faddeev, Leon Takhtajan, Evgeny Sklyanin, Nicolai Reshetikhin and Vladimir Korepin) and related work by the Japanese School. The intuition behind the second, bicrossproduct, class of quantum groups was different and came from the search for self-dual objects as an approach to quantum gravity.

==Drinfeld–Jimbo type quantum groups==
One type of objects commonly called a &quot;quantum group&quot; appeared in the work of Vladimir Drinfeld and Michio Jimbo as a deformation of the universal enveloping algebra of a semisimple Lie algebra or, more generally, a Kac–Moody algebra, in the category of Hopf algebras. The resulting algebra has additional structure, making it into a quasitriangular Hopf algebra.

Let &quot;A&quot; = (&quot;aij&quot;) be the Cartan matrix of the Kac–Moody algebra, and let &quot;q&quot; ≠ 0, 1 be a complex number, then the quantum group, &quot;Uq&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), where &quot;G&quot; is the Lie algebra whose Cartan matrix is &quot;A&quot;, is defined as the unital associative algebra with generators &quot;kλ&quot; (where &quot;λ&quot; is an element of the weight lattice, i.e. 2(λ, α&quot;i&quot;)/(α&quot;i&quot;, α&quot;i&quot;) is an integer for all &quot;i&quot;), and &quot;ei&quot; and &quot;fi&quot; (for simple roots, α&quot;i&quot;), subject to the following relations:

:formula_1

And for &quot;i&quot; ≠ &quot;j&quot; we have the &quot;q&quot;-Serre relations, which are deformations of the Serre relations:

:formula_2

where the q-factorial, the q-analog of the ordinary factorial, is defined recursively using q-number:

:formula_3

In the limit as &quot;q&quot; → 1, these relations approach the relations for the universal enveloping algebra &quot;U&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), where

:formula_4

and &quot;tλ&quot; is the element of the Cartan subalgebra satisfying (&quot;tλ&quot;, &quot;h&quot;) = &quot;λ&quot;(&quot;h&quot;) for all &quot;h&quot; in the Cartan subalgebra.

There are various coassociative coproducts under which these algebras are Hopf algebras, for example,

:formula_5

where the set of generators has been extended, if required, to include &quot;kλ&quot; for &quot;λ&quot; which is expressible as the sum of an element of the weight lattice and half an element of the root lattice.

In addition, any Hopf algebra leads to another with reversed coproduct &quot;T&quot; Δ, where &quot;T&quot; is given by &quot;T&quot;(&quot;x&quot; ⊗ &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;y&quot; ⊗ &quot;x&quot;, giving three more possible versions.

The counit on &quot;U&quot;&quot;q&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is the same for all these coproducts: &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;kλ&quot;) = 1, &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;ei&quot;) = &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;fi&quot;) = 0, and the respective antipodes for the above coproducts are given by

:formula_6

Alternatively, the quantum group &quot;U&quot;&quot;q&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) can be regarded as an algebra over the field C(&quot;q&quot;), the field of all rational functions of an indeterminate &quot;q&quot; over C.

Similarly, the quantum group &quot;U&quot;&quot;q&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) can be regarded as an algebra over the field Q(&quot;q&quot;), the field of all rational functions of an indeterminate &quot;q&quot; over Q (see below in the section on quantum groups at &quot;q&quot; = 0). The center of quantum group can be described by quantum determinant.

===Representation theory===
Just as there are many different types of representations for Kac–Moody algebras and their universal enveloping algebras, so there are many different types of representation for quantum groups.

As is the case for all Hopf algebras, &quot;Uq&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) has an adjoint representation on itself as a module, with the action being given by 
:formula_7
where 
:formula_8

====Case 1: &quot;q&quot; is not a root of unity====
One important type of representation is a weight representation, and the corresponding module is called a weight module. A weight module is a module with a basis of weight vectors. A weight vector is a nonzero vector &quot;v&quot; such that &quot;kλ&quot; · &quot;v&quot; = &quot;dλv&quot; for all &quot;λ&quot;, where &quot;dλ&quot; are complex numbers for all weights &quot;λ&quot; such that

:formula_9
:formula_10 for all weights &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;μ&quot;.

A weight module is called integrable if the actions of &quot;ei&quot; and &quot;fi&quot; are locally nilpotent (i.e. for any vector &quot;v&quot; in the module, there exists a positive integer &quot;k&quot;, possibly dependent on &quot;v&quot;, such that formula_11 for all &quot;i&quot;). In the case of integrable modules, the complex numbers &quot;d&quot;&quot;λ&quot; associated with a weight vector satisfy formula_12, where &quot;ν&quot; is an element of the weight lattice, and &quot;cλ&quot; are complex numbers such that

:*formula_13
:*formula_14 for all weights &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;μ&quot;,
:*formula_15 for all &quot;i&quot;.

Of special interest are highest-weight representations, and the corresponding highest weight modules. A highest weight module is a module generated by a weight vector &quot;v&quot;, subject to &quot;k&quot;&quot;λ&quot; · &quot;v&quot; = &quot;dλv&quot; for all weights &quot;μ&quot;, and &quot;ei&quot; · &quot;v&quot; = 0 for all &quot;i&quot;. Similarly, a quantum group can have a lowest weight representation and lowest weight module, &quot;i.e.&quot; a module generated by a weight vector &quot;v&quot;, subject to &quot;kλ&quot; · &quot;v&quot; = &quot;dλv&quot; for all weights &quot;λ&quot;, and &quot;fi&quot; · &quot;v&quot; = 0 for all &quot;i&quot;.

Define a vector &quot;v&quot; to have weight &quot;ν&quot; if formula_16 for all &quot;λ&quot; in the weight lattice.

If &quot;G&quot; is a Kac–Moody algebra, then in any irreducible highest weight representation of &quot;U&quot;&quot;q&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), with highest weight ν, the multiplicities of the weights are equal to their multiplicities in an irreducible representation of &quot;U&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) with equal highest weight. If the highest weight is dominant and integral (a weight &quot;μ&quot; is dominant and integral if &quot;μ&quot; satisfies the condition that formula_17 is a non-negative integer for all &quot;i&quot;), then the weight spectrum of the irreducible representation is invariant under the Weyl group for &quot;G&quot;, and the representation is integrable.

Conversely, if a highest weight module is integrable, then its highest weight vector &quot;v&quot; satisfies formula_18, where &quot;c&quot;&quot;λ&quot; · &quot;v&quot; = &quot;d&quot;&quot;λ&quot;&quot;v&quot; are complex numbers such that

:*formula_13
:*formula_14 for all weights &quot;λ&quot; and &quot;μ&quot;,
:*formula_15 for all &quot;i&quot;,

and &quot;ν&quot; is dominant and integral.

As is the case for all Hopf algebras, the tensor product of two modules is another module. For an element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;Uq(G)&quot;, and for vectors &quot;v&quot; and &quot;w&quot; in the respective modules, &quot;x&quot; ⋅ (&quot;v&quot; ⊗ &quot;w&quot;) = Δ(&quot;x&quot;) ⋅ (&quot;v&quot; ⊗ &quot;w&quot;), so that formula_22, and in the case of coproduct Δ1, formula_23 and formula_24

The integrable highest weight module described above is a tensor product of a one-dimensional module (on which &quot;k&quot;λ = &quot;c&quot;&quot;λ&quot; for all &quot;λ&quot;, and &quot;ei&quot; = &quot;fi&quot; = 0 for all &quot;i&quot;) and a highest weight module generated by a nonzero vector &quot;v&quot;0, subject to formula_25 for all weights &quot;λ&quot;, and formula_26 for all &quot;i&quot;.

In the specific case where &quot;G&quot; is a finite-dimensional Lie algebra (as a special case of a Kac–Moody algebra), then the irreducible representations with dominant integral highest weights are also finite-dimensional.

In the case of a tensor product of highest weight modules, its decomposition into submodules is the same as for the tensor product of the corresponding modules of the Kac–Moody algebra (the highest weights are the same, as are their multiplicities).

====Case 2: &quot;q&quot; is a root of unity====
===Quasitriangularity===

====Case 1: &quot;q&quot; is not a root of unity====
Strictly, the quantum group &quot;U&quot;&quot;q&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is not quasitriangular, but it can be thought of as being &quot;nearly quasitriangular&quot; in that there exists an infinite formal sum which plays the role of an &quot;R&quot;-matrix. This infinite formal sum is expressible in terms of generators &quot;ei&quot; and &quot;fi&quot;, and Cartan generators &quot;t&quot;&quot;λ&quot;, where &quot;kλ&quot; is formally identified with &quot;q&quot;&quot;t&quot;&quot;λ&quot;. The infinite formal sum is the product of two factors,
:formula_27
and an infinite formal sum, where &quot;λ&quot;&quot;j&quot; is a basis for the dual space to the Cartan subalgebra, and &quot;μ&quot;&quot;j&quot; is the dual basis, and &quot;η&quot; = ±1.

The formal infinite sum which plays the part of the &quot;R&quot;-matrix has a well-defined action on the tensor product of two irreducible highest weight modules, and also on the tensor product of two lowest weight modules. Specifically, if &quot;v&quot; has weight &quot;α&quot; and &quot;w&quot; has weight &quot;β&quot;, then 
:formula_28
and the fact that the modules are both highest weight modules or both lowest weight modules reduces the action of the other factor on &quot;v&quot; ⊗ &quot;W&quot; to a finite sum.

Specifically, if &quot;V&quot; is a highest weight module, then the formal infinite sum, &quot;R&quot;, has a well-defined, and invertible, action on &quot;V&quot; ⊗ &quot;V&quot;, and this value of &quot;R&quot; (as an element of End(&quot;V&quot; ⊗ &quot;V&quot;)) satisfies the Yang–Baxter equation, and therefore allows us to determine a representation of the braid group, and to define quasi-invariants for knots, links and braids.

====Case 2: &quot;q&quot; is a root of unity====
===Quantum groups at &quot;q&quot; = 0===
Masaki Kashiwara has researched the limiting behaviour of quantum groups as &quot;q&quot; → 0, and found a particularly well behaved base called a crystal base.

===Description and classification by root-systems and Dynkin diagrams===
There has been considerable progress in describing finite quotients of quantum groups such as the above &quot;Uq&quot;(g) for &quot;qn&quot; = 1; one usually considers the class of pointed Hopf algebras, meaning that all simple left or right comodules are 1-dimensional and thus the sum of all its simple subcoalgebras forms a group algebra called the coradical:

* In 2002 H.-J. Schneider and N. Andruskiewitsch finished their classification of pointed Hopf algebras with an abelian co-radical group (excluding primes 2, 3, 5, 7), especially as the above finite quotients of &quot;Uq&quot;(g) decompose into &quot;E&quot;′s (Borel part), dual &quot;F&quot;′s and &quot;K&quot;′s (Cartan algebra) just like ordinary Semisimple Lie algebras:
::formula_29
:Here, as in the classical theory &quot;V&quot; is a braided vector space of dimension &quot;n&quot; spanned by the &quot;E&quot;′s, and &quot;σ&quot; (a so-called cocycle twist) creates the nontrivial linking between &quot;E&quot;′s and &quot;F&quot;′s. Note that in contrast to classical theory, more than two linked components may appear. The role of the quantum Borel algebra is taken by a Nichols algebra formula_30 of the braided vectorspace. 

* A crucial ingredient was I. Heckenberger&#x27;s classification of finite Nichols algebras for abelian groups in terms of generalized Dynkin diagrams. When small primes are present, some exotic examples, such as a triangle, occur (see also the Figure of a rank 3 Dynkin diagram).
* Meanwhile, Schneider and Heckenberger have generally proven the existence of an arithmetic root system also in the nonabelian case, generating a PBW basis as proven by Kharcheko in the abelian case (without the assumption on finite dimension). This can be used on specific cases &quot;Uq&quot;(g) and explains e.g. the numerical coincidence between certain coideal subalgebras of these quantum groups and the order of the Weyl group of the Lie algebra g.

==Compact matrix quantum groups==
S. L. Woronowicz introduced compact matrix quantum groups. Compact matrix quantum groups are abstract structures on which the &quot;continuous functions&quot; on the structure are given by elements of a C*-algebra. The geometry of a compact matrix quantum group is a special case of a noncommutative geometry.

The continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space form a commutative C*-algebra. By the Gelfand theorem, a commutative C*-algebra is isomorphic to the C*-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on a compact Hausdorff topological space, and the topological space is uniquely determined by the C*-algebra up to homeomorphism.

For a compact topological group, &quot;G&quot;, there exists a C*-algebra homomorphism Δ: &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) → &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) ⊗ &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) (where &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) ⊗ &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is the C*-algebra tensor product - the completion of the algebraic tensor product of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) and &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;)), such that Δ(&quot;f&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;) for all &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), and for all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot; (where (&quot;f&quot; ⊗ &quot;g&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) for all &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) and all &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;). There also exists a linear multiplicative mapping &quot;κ&quot;: &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) → &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;), such that &quot;κ&quot;(&quot;f&quot;)(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;−1) for all &quot;f&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) and all &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;G&quot;. Strictly, this does not make &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) a Hopf algebra, unless &quot;G&quot; is finite. On the other hand, a finite-dimensional representation of &quot;G&quot; can be used to generate a *-subalgebra of &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) which is also a Hopf *-algebra. Specifically, if formula_31 is an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional representation of &quot;G&quot;, then for all &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; &quot;uij&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) and

:formula_32

It follows that the *-algebra generated by &quot;uij&quot; for all &quot;i, j&quot; and &quot;κ&quot;(&quot;uij&quot;) for all &quot;i, j&quot; is a Hopf *-algebra: the counit is determined by ε(&quot;uij&quot;) = δ&quot;ij&quot; for all &quot;i, j&quot; (where &quot;δ&quot;&quot;ij&quot; is the Kronecker delta), the antipode is &quot;κ&quot;, and the unit is given by

:formula_33

===General definition===
As a generalization, a compact matrix quantum group is defined as a pair (&quot;C&quot;, &quot;u&quot;), where &quot;C&quot; is a C*-algebra and formula_34 is a matrix with entries in &quot;C&quot; such that

:*The *-subalgebra, &quot;C&quot;0, of &quot;C&quot;, which is generated by the matrix elements of &quot;u&quot;, is dense in &quot;C&quot;;

:*There exists a C*-algebra homomorphism called the comultiplication Δ: &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot; ⊗ &quot;C&quot; (where &quot;C&quot; ⊗ &quot;C&quot; is the C*-algebra tensor product - the completion of the algebraic tensor product of &quot;C&quot; and &quot;C&quot;) such that for all &quot;i, j&quot; we have:
:::formula_35

:*There exists a linear antimultiplicative map κ: &quot;C&quot;0 → &quot;C&quot;0 (the coinverse) such that &quot;κ&quot;(&quot;κ&quot;(&quot;v&quot;*)*) = &quot;v&quot; for all &quot;v&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;0 and
:::formula_36
where &quot;I&quot; is the identity element of &quot;C&quot;. Since κ is antimultiplicative, then &quot;κ&quot;(&quot;vw&quot;) = &quot;κ&quot;(&quot;w&quot;) &quot;κ&quot;(&quot;v&quot;) for all &quot;v&quot;, &quot;w&quot; in &quot;C&quot;0.

As a consequence of continuity, the comultiplication on &quot;C&quot; is coassociative.

In general, &quot;C&quot; is not a bialgebra, and &quot;C&quot;0 is a Hopf *-algebra.

Informally, &quot;C&quot; can be regarded as the *-algebra of continuous complex-valued functions over the compact matrix quantum group, and &quot;u&quot; can be regarded as a finite-dimensional representation of the compact matrix quantum group.

===Representations===
A representation of the compact matrix quantum group is given by a corepresentation of the Hopf *-algebra (a corepresentation of a counital coassociative coalgebra &quot;A&quot; is a square matrix formula_37 with entries in &quot;A&quot; (so &quot;v&quot; belongs to M(&quot;n&quot;, &quot;A&quot;)) such that

:formula_38

for all &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot; and &quot;ε&quot;(&quot;vij&quot;) = δ&quot;ij&quot; for all &quot;i, j&quot;). Furthermore, a representation &quot;v&quot;, is called unitary if the matrix for &quot;v&quot; is unitary (or equivalently, if κ(&quot;vij&quot;) = &quot;v*ij&quot; for all &quot;i&quot;, &quot;j&quot;).

===Example===
An example of a compact matrix quantum group is SUμ(2), where the parameter μ is a positive real number. So SUμ(2) = (C(SUμ(2)), &quot;u&quot;), where C(SUμ(2)) is the C*-algebra generated by α and γ, subject to

:formula_39
:formula_40
:formula_41
:formula_42

and

:formula_43

so that the comultiplication is determined by ∆(α) = α ⊗ α − γ ⊗ γ*, ∆(γ) = α ⊗ γ + γ ⊗ α*, and the coinverse is determined by κ(α) = α*, κ(γ) = −μ−1γ, κ(γ*) = −μγ*, κ(α*) = α. Note that &quot;u&quot; is a representation, but not a unitary representation. &quot;u&quot; is equivalent to the unitary representation

:formula_44

Equivalently, SUμ(2) = (C(SUμ(2)), &quot;w&quot;), where C(SUμ(2)) is the C*-algebra generated by α and β, subject to

:formula_45
:formula_46
:formula_47
:formula_48

and

:formula_49

so that the comultiplication is determined by ∆(α) = α ⊗ α − μβ ⊗ β*, Δ(β) = α ⊗ β + β ⊗ α*, and the coinverse is determined by κ(α) = α*, κ(β) = −μ−1β, κ(β*) = −μβ*, κ(α*) = α. Note that &quot;w&quot; is a unitary representation. The realizations can be identified by equating formula_50.

When μ = 1, then SUμ(2) is equal to the algebra &quot;C&quot;(SU(2)) of functions on the concrete compact group SU(2).

==Bicrossproduct quantum groups==
Whereas compact matrix pseudogroups are typically versions of Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum groups in a dual function algebra formulation, with additional structure, the bicrossproduct ones are a distinct second family of quantum groups of increasing importance as deformations of solvable rather than semisimple Lie groups. They are associated to Lie splittings of Lie algebras or local factorisations of Lie groups and can be viewed as the cross product or Mackey quantisation of one of the factors acting on the other for the algebra and a similar story for the coproduct Δ with the second factor acting back on the first.

The very simplest nontrivial example corresponds to two copies of R locally acting on each other and results in a quantum group (given here in an algebraic form) with generators &quot;p&quot;, &quot;K&quot;, &quot;K&quot;−1, say, and coproduct

:formula_51
:formula_52
:formula_53

where &quot;h&quot; is the deformation parameter.

This quantum group was linked to a toy model of Planck scale physics implementing Born reciprocity when viewed as a deformation of the Heisenberg algebra of quantum mechanics. Also, starting with any compact real form of a semisimple Lie algebra g its complexification as a real Lie algebra of twice the dimension splits into g and a certain solvable Lie algebra (the Iwasawa decomposition), and this provides a canonical bicrossproduct quantum group associated to g. For su(2) one obtains a quantum group deformation of the Euclidean group E(3) of motions in 3 dimensions.

<text>Norton Juster (June 2, 1929 – March 8, 2021) was an American academic, architect, and writer. He was best known as an author of children&#x27;s books, notably for &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth&quot; (1961) and &quot;The Dot and the Line&quot; (1963).

==Early life==
Juster was born in Brooklyn on June 2, 1929. Both his parents were Jewish and immigrated to the United States. His father, Samuel Juster, was born in Romania and became an architect through a correspondence course. His mother, Minnie Silberman, was of Polish Jewish descent. His brother, Howard, became an architect as well. Juster studied architecture at the University of Pennsylvania, obtaining a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1952. He went on to study city planning at the University of Liverpool.

==Career==
Juster enlisted in the Civil Engineer Corps of the United States Navy in 1954, and rose to the rank of lieutenant junior grade. During one tour, to combat boredom, he began to write and illustrate a story for children, but the commanding officer later reprimanded him for it. Still, Juster also finished an unpublished satirical fairy tale called &quot;The Passing of Irving&quot;. Later posted in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, again to combat boredom, he made up a non-existent military publication called the &quot;Naval News Service&quot; as a scheme to request interviews with attractive women. It worked so amazingly well that a neighbor asked to come along as his assistant. His next scheme was to make the &quot;Garibaldi Society&quot; (inspired by a statue in Washington Square Park), whose &quot;&quot; was to reject anyone who applied for membership, designing an impressive logo, application, and rejection letter. It was at this time he met Jules Feiffer while taking out the trash.

Approximately six months after meeting Feiffer, Juster received his discharge from the Navy, and worked for a Manhattan architectural firm. He also did some part-time teaching and undertook other jobs. Juster, Feiffer, and another friend rented an apartment on State Street. Juster also resorted to pulling pranks occasionally on Feiffer. Juster&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Phantom Tollbooth,&quot; was published in 1961, with Feiffer doing the drawings. This was followed by &quot;The Dot and the Line&quot; (1963), which became a standard book in classrooms around the country. Juster went on to author &quot;Alberic the Wise and Other Journeys&quot; (1965), &quot;Stark Naked: A Paranomastic Odyssey&quot; (1969), &quot;Otter Nonsense&quot; (1982), and &quot;As Silly as Knees, as Busy as Bees&quot; (1998), among other works. He also published &quot;A Woman&#x27;s Place: Yesterday&#x27;s Women in Rural America&quot; in 1996 for an adult audience, based on his personal experience of residing on a farm in Massachusetts.

Although Juster enjoyed writing, his architectural career remained his primary emphasis. He served as a professor of architecture and environmental design at Hampshire College from 1970 to 1992, when he retired. He also co-founded a small architectural firm, Juster Pope Associates, in Shelburne Falls, Massachusetts, in 1970. The firm was renamed Juster Pope Frazier after Jack Frazier joined the firm in 1978.

==Later life==
Juster lived in Massachusetts during his later years. His wife, Jeanne, died in October 2018 after 54 years of marriage. Although he retired from architecture, he continued to write for many years. His book &quot;The Hello, Goodbye Window&quot;, published May 15, 2005, won the Caldecott Medal for Chris Raschka&#x27;s illustration in 2006. The sequel, &quot;Sourpuss and Sweetie Pie&quot;, was published in 2008. Two years later, he teamed up again with Feiffer for &quot;The Odious Ogre&quot;.

Juster died on March 8, 2021, at his home in Northampton, Massachusetts. He was 91, and suffered from complications of a stroke prior to his death.

<doc id="340684" wikidata="Q4892154" url="?curid=340684" title="Berkhamsted School">
<text>Berkhamsted School is a private day school (known in the UK as a public school), in the market town of Berkhamsted, in Hertfordshire, England. The present school was formed in 1997 by the amalgamation of the original Berkhamsted School, founded in 1541 by John Incent, Dean of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Berkhamsted School for Girls, established in 1888, and Berkhamsted Preparatory School. The new merged school was initially called Berkhamsted Collegiate School, but reverted to Berkhamsted School in 2008. In 2011 Berkhamsted School merged with Heatherton House School, a girls&#x27; preparatory school in Amersham, to form the Berkhamsted Schools Group. The Group acquired Haresfoot School in Berkhamsted and its on site day nursery in 2012, which became Berkhamsted Pre-Preparatory School for children aged three to seven, and Berkhamsted Day Nursery.

Berkhamsted School is a &quot;diamond school&quot; in which pupils are taught coeducationally in the Pre-Prep School, Prep School and Sixth Form, but independently in the traditional Senior years, between the ages of 11 and 16. The school has four main sites: the Pre-Prep School, the Prep School, the Castle Street Campus and Kings Road Campus (the latter two being the original boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; schools respectively).

The school is noted for its distinctive collegiate and pastoral structure, a varied sporting, outdoor education and cultural co-curricular programme and participation in the life of the local community. Richard Backhouse, previously principal of Monkton Combe School, became principal of the school in January 2016.

==House system==
All Berkhamsted pupils belong to a house throughout their time at the School. Each house is run by a house-master supported by several house tutors. Together they are responsible for providing pastoral support for their pupils and serve as the primary link between parents and the school. Houses are both physical environments and communities, each forming a distinct entity within the larger organisation of the school itself. Pupils attend their house for morning and afternoon registration, to play games throughout the day, and for the majority of the administration which governs their time at the school. They also participate in school events on behalf of their house.

===Senior boys&#x27; houses===

*Adders was formed in 1915 to accommodate the so-called &quot;train boys&quot; who, by nature of their daily commute to school, were often excluded from school activities. Various explanations have been given for the name &#x27;Adders&#x27;. It may be a casual abbreviation of &quot;the add-on house&quot;, or a contraction of &#x27;Adlebert House&#x27;, now the chaplain&#x27;s residence. However, according to an anecdote current in the 1960s, the boys were asked for suggestions and one proposed the present name (&quot;Bees&quot; and &quot;Swifts&quot; already existed). On being asked why, he explained, &quot;Puff adders, sir!&quot;, an allusion to the steam trains on which the pupils travelled. Adders is situated in a separate building next to Newcroft and it takes the ground floor while Fry&#x27;s house uses the top floor. Current head of house is Richard Margerison.
*Bartrum, the newest house, founded in 2019. Current head of house is Andrew Wilkes.
*Bees, dating back to 1897 and situated on Mill Street next to Swifts. Current head of house is Graeme Reid-Davies.
*Cox&#x27;s, opened in 1958 in response to the growing numbers of day boys. Named after Cuthbert Cox. Until September 2010, the house occupied a separate building located next to the Tesco carpark. Cox&#x27;s moved from its present location to the site of the old swimming pool, sharing with Tilmans. The former Cox&#x27;s house was renovated into a new drama studio. Current head of house is Jessica Thackaray.
*Fry&#x27;s is named after one of Berkhamsted&#x27;s former headmasters, Thomas Charles Fry. It is located above Adders. Current head of house is Andrew Harker.
*Greenes, found along the cloisters of the Grass Quad. The School&#x27;s association with the Greene family is recognised in its name. Current head of house is Max Stallard.
*Loxwood, also found along the cloisters. This house was named after a former girls&#x27; school house. Current head of house is Martin Middleton.
*Swifts, established at the same time as Bees. Current head of house is Douglas Foster.
*Tilman (formerly Incents), until September 2010, was both a boarding and day boy house. The boarding accommodation is situated along Chesham Road, and is the birthplace of Graham Greene. The house was named after John Incent, the school&#x27;s founder, and had its main entrance in the cloisters between Loxwood and Greenes. In September 2010, Incents day house closed and was renamed &#x27;Tilman&#x27; and moved to a new location on the site of the old swimming pool, sharing the site with Cox&#x27;s. The former Incents House was renovated into a study for the headmaster and deputy head of Berkhamsted Boys. The boarding house remained unchanged. Current head of house is George Campbell.

That at least three of the eight Senior Boys&#x27; Houses appear to be named after various fauna was not always intentional. When Swifts and Bees were formed in 1897, they were to be called &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;B&#x27; respectively, but the former&#x27;s first house master considered this dull, naming his House &#x27;Swifts&#x27;. &#x27;Bees&#x27; is thus phonetic. &#x27;Adders&#x27; may be wholly fortuitous; &#x27;Reeves&#x27; and &#x27;Hawks&#x27;, now sixth form houses, add to the confusion. Richard Reeve was the school&#x27;s first headmaster; Hawks was named by the apparent &quot;fauna tradition&quot; in 1933.

===Senior girls&#x27; houses===
*Holme
*New Stede 
*Old Stede 
*Russell 
*St David&#x27;s 
*Stephenson, founded in 2017, named in honour of microbiologist and biochemist Marjory Stephenson.
*Wolstenholme, founded in 2011, named after Sue Wolstenholme who was a school governor for 35 years.

===Sixth form houses===
*Ashby, named after the mother of John Incent&#x27;s second wife, Katherine. 
*Burgh, pronounced . 
*Churchill, after Clementine Churchill, Baroness Spencer-Churchill and formerly girls&#x27; boarding accommodation.
*Hawks, a former junior boys&#x27; house, established in 1934. 
*Nash, named after Henry Nash, a founder of Berkhamsted School for Girls.
*Reeves, named after Richard Reeve and founded as a junior boys&#x27; house, along with Hawks.
*St George&#x27;s, originally a junior house for the &quot;train boys&quot;, rather like Adders.
*School, variously the headmaster&#x27;s quarters and a boarding house.
*Spencer, a new sixth form house introduced in 2009.
*Tudor, a new sixth form house introduced in 2019.

==History of Berkhamsted School, 1541–1996==

===Founding===
High clergy of the 16th century frequently distinguished themselves by their furthering of the educational establishment and, in this respect, Berkhamsted owes much to John Incent. In 1523, he called upon the brothers of the local brotherhood of St John the Baptist to divert the funds they had hitherto donated to the monastic hospital (which had closed) to the Brotherhood House, about which little is known. In 1541, however, Incent applied to the King, Henry VIII, in pursuit of a licence &quot;to purchase £40 in land by the year,&quot; and was successful. Although Incent was Berkhamsted&#x27;s most famous descendant, it is considered an act of great piety that he chose to found a school outside what had become his sphere of influence.

By 1544, Berkhamsted School&#x27;s first building, now known as &#x27;Old Hall&#x27; was complete, later to be described by William Camden as &quot;the only structure in Berkhamsted worth a second glance.&quot; The formal opening is recorded in the Ancient Documents:

&quot;When the building of the said Schoole was thus finished, the Deane sent for the chiefe men of the Towne into the Schoole, where he kneeling downe, gave thanks to Almighty God, which had given him life to see the perfection of that work, which both he, the towne and the country had beene about for the space of 20 years as is manifest by the pmisses. First he read his licence. Then he called for Richd Reeve, and placed him in the seate there made for the Schoolemr. and so did ordaine, make and pnounce him to be the first Master of the said Schoole and after that tooke him by the hand and did give him and his successors for ever possession of the lodgings appteining to that office. In like manner he placed John Audley to be Usher, and John East to be Chaplen. This done he did give possession by his deed bearing date the 23 of March in the 36 yeare of Henry the 8 to the said Richd Reeve John Audley and John East and their successours for ever, of all the land to the sd Schoole then appointed, which are expressed pticularly in an act of pliamt. made 2 &amp; 3 Ed 6. Finally the Deane began TE DEUM LAUDAMUS which being finished with certaine other praiers and ceremonies, the whole Companie did there drink together and so depted.&quot;
Yet the legal foundation was not nearly so sound. When Incent died some 18 months later, his entire wealth (over £330) became the king&#x27;s, his documents stating that Berkhamsted&#x27;s founder, a highly educated lawyer, had died intestate. The authenticity of this claim is rightly questioned: shortly after Incent&#x27;s death, a complaint was made to the king &quot;by some evill persons that the Deane had laid to the Schoole more revenues than his licence [£40 annually] did permitt him.&quot; Furthermore, Henry VIII stood to gain £196 and &quot;a front of pearls&quot; from the Dean&#x27;s estate. However, there had been no formal incorporation of the school, and records suggest that Incent had spent much time since the opening preparing, but not realising, legal protection. An investigation into the claims that his annual endowment had been exceeded was commissioned and undertaken by John Waterhouse, a favourite not only of the king, but also a confidant of Incent, who had been present at the opening. His choice of commissioner suggests the foundation still had royal approval, something that had allowed the school to survive the first attack against it. The most enduring legacy of the foundation nonetheless remains the building itself.
===A Delicate establishment===

Incent&#x27;s death, which itself had created a threat to the school, was followed by that of Henry VIII in January 1547. The Chantries Act 1546, which could have jeopardised the post of chaplain at Berkhamsted, was replaced by new legislation, and the foundation was declared &quot;unperfect&quot;. A Foundation Act was introduced in parliament to settle the various claims to the Incent estate, but only those concerning the most immediate relatives of John. Thus claims to land of the school&#x27;s endowment in Sparkford near Winchester were made and tried, resulting in significant loss to the school.

An additional threat came when Edward VI, acting on advice, re-established the school under his own name. In reality, there was both initial benefit and ultimate disadvantage in this. Richard Reeve, the first headmaster, held strict Protestant views, and was dismissed by the Bishop of Lincoln, acting upon Queen Mary&#x27;s instructions, in 1555. He was replaced by William Barker, who offered an alternative religious policy, for he himself was removed when Elizabeth gained the throne.

===Fulfillment under Saltmarsh and Hunt===

William Saltmarsh enjoyed a longer headmastership than either Reeve or Barker. The latter had appointed Leonard Stepney as usher, but he lost his post in 1571 on charges of harbouring a Catholic priest. His successor, John Bristowe, had a still more colourful end, murdered gruesomely in 1597 by a local yeoman. Although this would have caused Saltmarsh concern, this was otherwise a very successful period in the history of Berkhamsted School. Pupil numbers continued to increase, and a handful of Berkhamstedians, as they would become known, achieved notoriety.

By 1616, some years after Saltmarsh&#x27;s death, it was written
&quot;Scholae Ludimagister cum 33 annos eidem praefuisset amplam pecuniam testamento suo moriens legavit reficiendis his aedibus&quot;
which Williams translates: &quot;William Saltmarsh, third Headmaster of this School, after presiding over it for 33 years, on his deathbed bequeathed a sum of money sufficient for the repair of this building.&quot;

It is uncertain why the building (by which it is meant Old Hall) had fallen into disrepair under an otherwise successful headmaster, but through his donation Saltmarsh had decisively added himself to Berkhamsted&#x27;s list of benefactors.

All available evidence, of which there is little, suggests that the Hunt years were also successful ones for the school. His period in the office probably witnessed greater stability in the school than in his personal life – he was married four times – and there was praise for his leadership, a former pupil recording &quot;much reverence and affect&quot; for Hunt. It also appears that he took as active a part in the life of Berkhamsted as had become and remains a tradition, serving as overseer for the poor and bailiff as well as contributing to church funds. He died in office, aged 70, in 1636.

===&#x27;So Mean a School&#x27;===
It is some indication of the extent of Berkhamsted&#x27;s degeneration under Fossan that his successor, Edmund Newboult, was recommended by the Bishop of Hereford as &quot;of parts sufficient for so mean a school,&quot; an endorsement described as &quot;comically unenthusiastic&quot;. The most prominent historical source on Newboult remains a reply he made to an educational researcher some years into his tenure, noting that &quot;The Statues of the Schoole were made in the time of popery, therefore not observed.&quot; During his 17 years of office, Newboult does appear to have provided a solid educational environment at Berkhamsted, at least relatively speaking, something continued under his successor, Thomas Wren. In his wake came John Theed, member of a prosperous Buckinghamshire family, and Berkhamsted&#x27;s longest serving headmaster. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, there were to be only four occupants of the post, an age not only of stability but stagnation. Nonetheless, the three inspections carried out during the three years found no cause for concern, and in their record is revealed the first reference to curriculum content, the boys having been examined on Ovid&#x27;s Metamorphoses.

Theed was the school&#x27;s second pluralist (it is no inspiration that the first was Fossan): his obituary in The Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine recorded him as vicar of Marsworth and made no mention of his Berkhamsted role – some suggest this is characteristic of an insouciant, unambitious approach to the school. A similar charge could not be made against Evan Price. Having served as usher for 16 of Theed&#x27;s less proactive years, Price had become accustomed to the day-to-day running of the school. On Theed&#x27;s death in 1734, his succession, still the jurisdiction of the sovereign, brought Price to the headmastership, despite his not having attended university and his flamboyant record – as curate of Bovingdon, he had been involved in an &quot;unseemly brawl&quot; during a burial he was officiating.

<text>Erik Ortvad (18 June 1917 in Copenhagen – 29 February 2008 in Kvänjarp) was a painter and a creator of many drawings. 
He debuted as a painter in 1935. He is mostly known for colorful surrealistic paintings. . 
He also created several hundred satiric drawings about the modern way of life under the pseudonym &quot;Enrico&quot;.

In 1948 he was a founding member of the COBRA avant-garde art movement.

He is represented in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and Statens Museum for Kunst in Copenhagen.

During the second world war he lived as a refugee in Sweden due to communist sympathies and a Jewish wife, and in 1962 he returned and settled in a croft in Kvänjarp, Ljungby Municipality, Småland, Sweden where he lived for the rest of his life.

<text>The Gleiwitz incident (; ) was a false flag attack on the radio station &quot;Sender Gleiwitz&quot; in Gleiwitz (then Germany and now Gliwice, Poland) staged by Nazi Germany on the night of 31 August 1939. Along with some two dozen similar incidents, the attack was manufactured by Germany as a &quot;casus belli&quot; to justify the invasion of Poland. Prior to the invasion, Adolf Hitler gave a radio address condemning the acts and announcing German plans to attack Poland, which began the next morning. Despite the German government using the attack as a justification to go to war with Poland, the Gleiwitz assailants were not Polish but were German SS officers wearing Polish uniforms. 

During his declaration of war, Hitler did not mention the Gleiwitz incident but grouped all provocations staged by the SS as an alleged &quot;Polish assault&quot; on Germany. The Gleiwitz incident is the best-known action of Operation Himmler, a series of special operations undertaken by the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) to serve German propaganda at the outbreak of war. The operation was intended to create the appearance of a Polish aggression against Germany to justify the invasion of Poland. On September 3, Britain and France declared war on Germany, and the European theatre of World War II had begun. Manufactured evidence for the Gleiwitz attack by the SS was provided by the undercover German SS officer Alfred Naujocks in 1945.

==Events at Gleiwitz==
Much of what is known about the Gleiwitz incident comes from the affidavit of &quot;SS-Sturmbannführer&quot; Alfred Naujocks at the Nuremberg Trials. In his testimony, he stated that he organised the incident under orders from Reinhard Heydrich and Heinrich Müller, chief of the Gestapo. On the night of 31 August, a small group of German operatives dressed in Polish uniforms and led by Naujocks seized the Gleiwitz station and broadcast a short anti-German message in Polish (sources vary on the content of the message). The operation was named &quot;Grossmutter gestorben&quot; (Grandmother died). The operation was to make the attack and the broadcast look like the work of Polish anti-German saboteurs. The operation was planned and carried out from the Sławięcice Palace (Schloss Slawentzitz).

To make the attack seem more convincing, the Gestapo executed Franciszek Honiok, a 43-year-old unmarried Upper Silesian Catholic farmer, known for sympathising with the Poles. He had been arrested the previous day by the Gestapo and dressed to look like a saboteur, then rendered unconscious by an injection of drugs, then killed by gunshot wounds. Honiok was left dead at the scene so that he appeared to have been killed while attacking the station. His corpse was then presented to the police and press as proof of the attack. Several prisoners from the Dachau concentration camp were drugged, shot dead on the site and their faces disfigured to make identification impossible. The Germans referred to them by the code phrase &quot;Konserve&quot; (canned goods). Some sources incorrectly refer to the incident as Operation Canned Goods.

In an oral testimony at the Nuremberg Trials, Erwin von Lahousen stated that his division of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; was one of two that were given the task of providing Polish Army uniforms, equipment and identification cards; he was later told by Wilhelm Canaris that people from concentration camps had been disguised in these uniforms and ordered to attack the radio stations.

Oskar Schindler played a role in supplying the Polish uniforms and weapons used in the operation as an agent for the &quot;Abwehr&quot;.

==Context==

The Gleiwitz incident was a part of a larger operation carried out by &quot;Abwehr&quot; and SS forces. Other orchestrated incidents were conducted along the Polish–German border at the same time as the Gleiwitz attack, such as a house burning in the Polish Corridor and spurious propaganda. The project was called Operation Himmler and comprised incidents intended to give the appearance of Polish aggression against Germany. German newspapers and politicians, including Adolf Hitler, had made accusations against Polish authorities for months before the 1939 invasion of organising or tolerating violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland. On 1 September, the day following the Gleiwitz attack, Germany launched &quot;Fall Weiss&quot; (Case White), the strategic plan for the invasion of Poland, which precipitated World War II in Europe. Hitler cited the border incidents in a speech in the Reichstag on the same day, with three of them called very serious, as justification for his invasion of Poland. Hitler had told his generals on 22 August, &quot;I will provide a propagandistic casus belli. Its credibility doesn&#x27;t matter. The victor will not be asked whether he told the truth&quot;.

==International reactions==
American correspondents were summoned to the scene the next day but no neutral parties were allowed to investigate the incident in detail and the international public was skeptical of the German version of the incident.

==In popular culture==
There have been several adaptations of the incident in cinema. &quot;Der Fall Gleiwitz&quot; (1961), directed by Gerhard Klein for DEFA studios (&quot;The Gleiwitz Case&quot;; English subtitles), is an East German film that reconstructs the events.

&quot;Operacja Himmler&quot; (1979) is a Polish film that covers the events.

Both &quot;Die Blechtrommel&quot; (1979), directed by Volker Schlöndorff, and &quot;Hitler&#x27;s SS: Portrait in Evil&quot; (1985), directed by Jim Goddard, briefly include the incident.

It was also mentioned in a video game; &quot;&quot; (2004), which stirred up some controversy in Poland where the game was briefly discussed in Polish media as anti-Polish falsification of history, before the issue was cleared up as a case of poor reporting.

<text>[[Evil Uno]] and [[Stu Grayson]] (previously known as Super Smash Brothers) are a Canadian professional wrestling tag team. They are the founding members of The Dark Order stable. Prior to AEW, Uno as Player Uno and Grayson as Stupefied and Player Dos wrestled across the independent circuit.

Their last match in Chikara was on October 24, 2010, in a losing effort against Bruderschaft des Kreuzes (Daizee Haze and Sara Del Rey).

On April 17, 2009, Super Smash Brothers made their Ring of Honor (ROH) debut in a dark match. On May 8, 2009, at &quot;Never Say Die&quot;, they made their official ROH in-ring debut, losing to Kenny King and Rhett Titus. On July 25, 2009, at &quot;Death Before Dishonor VII: Night Two&quot; in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, they defeated El Generico and Kevin Steen. On May 11, 2018, at &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, Evil Uno and Stu Grayson wrestled their long-time rivals The Young Bucks (Matt Jackson and Nick Jackson) in a losing effort. They would later challenge for the ROH World Tag Team Championship on November 11, 2018, at &quot;Global Wars: Toronto&quot;, where they lost to SoCal Uncensored (Frankie Kazarian and Scorpio Sky).

=== Pro Wrestling Guerrilla (2011–2013, 2019) ===
On September 10, 2011, Super Smash Brothers made their Pro Wrestling Guerilla (PWG) debut at &quot;The Perils Of Rock N&#x27; Roll Decadence&quot;, losing to The RockNES Monsters (Johnny Goodtime and Johnny Yuma). On April 21, 2012, they won the &quot;2012 Dynamite Duumvirate Tag Team Title Tournament&quot; (DDT4). They defeated The Young Bucks in the first round, Future Shock (Adam Cole and Kyle O&#x27;Reilly) in the semifinals, and 2 Husky Black Guys (El Generico and Willie Mack) in the final. On May 25, 2012, at &quot;Death To All But Metal&quot;, they defeated The Young Bucks in a No Disqualification match to win the vacant PWG World Tag Team Championship. Their first successful title defense was on July 21, 2012, at &quot;Threemendous III&quot;, was a three-way ladder match against Future Shock and The Young Bucks, and it was deemed SoCalUncensored.com&#x27;s 2012 Match of the Year. Their second successful title defense was on December 1, 2012, at &quot;Mystery Vortex&quot; against The RockNES Monsters. On January 12, 2013, at the &quot;2013 DDT4&quot;, they lost the tag titles to Unbreakable F&#x27;n Machines (Brian Cage and Michael Elgin). At Pro Wrestling Guerilla&#x27;s Sixteen, on July 26, 2019, they returned to PWG as The Dark Order. This marked their first appearance in the company since 2013, when they were known as Super Smash Brothers. They defeated Best Friends (Chuck Taylor and Trent) by disqualification, when Trent hit a low blow in retaliation for the Dark Order doing the same when the referee was down.

=== All Elite Wrestling (2019–2022) ===
On May 25, 2019, at Double or Nothing, Uno and Grayson made their All Elite Wrestling debut as The Dark Order.

<text>Socialist Organiser was a weekly socialist newspaper circulated in the Labour Party. The newspaper was founded in 1979 by the Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory, later renamed the Socialist Organiser Alliance.

The newspaper was originally a vehicle for united work between the International-Communist League (I-CL), the Workers&#x27; Socialist League (who merged with the ICL to become a new WSL), Workers Power and independent leftists, such as Ken Livingstone. Some independent Labour leftists split from the paper when it opposed the tactic of raising rates to offset cuts to local government services.

In the mid-1980s, the paper was sued by the Workers Revolutionary Party over claims they repeated that the WRP was partially funded by money from the Libyan and Iraqi governments, but the WRP abandoned the action.

The newspaper gradually became more identified with the new WSL. This process was completed when the ICL/WSL fusion broke, as &quot;Socialist Organiser&quot; re-evaluated many of its international policies and developed its own distinctive &quot;third camp&quot; position. 

As &quot;Socialist Organiser&quot; lost ground as a broad vehicle of left unity in the Labour Party, Sean Matgamna&#x27;s supporters from the former ICL began to work entirely through the Socialist Organiser Alliance. 

Socialist Organiser was denied the right to register with the Labour Party in 1990, but this had little practical effect and it continued to be published until the mid-1990s, when the Alliance for Workers&#x27; Liberty and International Socialist Group supported the launch of a new newspaper, &quot;Action for Solidarity&quot;.

<text>Apple bobbing, also known as bobbing for apples, is a game often played on Halloween and Bonfire Night. The game is played by filling a tub or a large basin with water and putting apples in the water. Because apples are less dense than water, they will float at the surface. Players (usually children) then try to catch one with their teeth. Use of arms is not allowed, and the hands are often tied behind the back to prevent cheating.

In Scotland, this may be called &quot;dooking&quot; (i.e., ). In northern England, the game is often called apple ducking or duck-apple. In Ireland and Newfoundland and Labrador, &quot;Snap Apple Night&quot; is a synonym for Halloween. Another variation involves using the mouth to drop a fork from above to &#x27;catch&#x27; the apple.

While bobbing for apples is the most common, other times the apples are substituted for nuts (most commonly hazel or chestnut).

==Apple on a String==

A common variant of bobbing of apples is the game snap apple or apple on a string, in which apples are hung from the ceiling and contestants jump to take bites - the winner is the contestant that manages to eat their entire apple first. To increase the difficulty, it is common to spin the apples beforehand or shake the cords, often catching contestants who are unaware or too slow in the face.

In Scotland, alongside dooking for apples, treacle scones, smeared in additional treacle, are strung from the ceiling at Halloween.

==History==
The tradition of bobbing for apples dates back to the Roman times, when the Roman army merged their own celebrations with traditional Celtic festivals. During an annual celebration, young unmarried people tried to bite into an apple floating in water or hanging from a string on a line; the first person to bite into the apple would be the next one to be allowed to marry. Apple bobbing was appropriated in the Irish festival Samhain, with apples serving as a sign of fertility and abundance.

Both apple bobbing and an apple on a string in 18th-century Ireland are mentioned by Charles Vallancey in his book &quot;Collectanea de Rebus Hibernicis&quot;.

A maiden who placed the apple she bobbed under her pillow was said to dream of her future sweetheart.

<doc id="340733" wikidata="Q5061023" url="?curid=340733" title="Central Electricity Generating Board">
<text>The Central Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) was responsible for electricity generation, transmission and bulk sales in England and Wales from 1958 until privatisation of the electricity industry in the 1990s.

It was established on 1 January 1958 to assume the functions of the Central Electricity Authority (1955–1957), which had in turn replaced the British Electricity Authority (1948–1955). The Electricity Council was also established in January 1958, as the coordinating and policy-making body for the British electricity supply industry.

== Responsibilities ==

The CEGB was responsible for electricity generation, transmission and bulk sales in England and Wales, whilst in Scotland electricity generation was carried out by the South of Scotland Electricity Board and the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board.

The CEGB&#x27;s duty was to develop and maintain an efficient, coordinated and economical system of supply of electricity in bulk for England and Wales, and for that purpose to generate or acquire supplies of electricity and to provide bulk supplies of electricity for the area electricity boards for distribution. It also had power to supply bulk electricity to the Scottish boards or electricity undertakings outside Great Britain.

The organisation was unusual in that most of its senior staff were professional engineers, supported in financial and risk-management areas.

== Corporate structure ==

=== Background ===
In 1954, six years after nationalisation, the Government appointed the Herbert Committee to examine the efficiency and organisation of the electricity industry. The committee found that the British Electricity Authority&#x27;s dual roles of electricity generation and supervision had led to central concentration of responsibility and to duplication between headquarters and divisional staff which led to delays in the commissioning of new stations. The Committee&#x27;s recommendations were enacted by the Electricity Act 1957 which established the Electricity Council to oversee the industry and the CEGB with responsibility for generation and transmission.

===Constitution===
The CEGB was established by section 2 of the Electricity Act 1957. It consisted of a Generating Board comprising a chairman and seven to nine full-time or part-time members, appointed by the Minister of Power, who had experience or capacity in &quot;the generation or supply of electricity, industrial, commercial or financial matters, applied science, administration, or the organisation of workers&quot;. The power of appointment later devolved to the Minister of Technology, then to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.

There were six chairmen of the CEGB:

* Christopher Hinton, Baron Hinton of Bankside, served from 1957 to 1964,
* Sir Stanley Brown served from 1965 to 1972,
* Sir Arthur Hawkins from 1972 to 1977,
* Glyn England from 1977 to 1982,
* Walter Marshall, Baron Marshall of Goring from 1982 to 1989,
* Gil Blackman was appointed chairman in January 1989 until 1990.

The executive comprised the chairman and the full-time board members. The Headquarters Operations Department provided a service to the board and executive and could supply specialist staff.

The chairman and two other members of the board plus the chairmen of the area boards were members of the Electricity Council.

=== Organisation ===
The design, construction and development functions associated with power stations and transmission was undertaken by two divisions: the Generation Development and Construction Division based in Cheltenham and then Barnwood Gloucester, and the Transmission Development and Construction Division based in Guildford. In 1979 the Transmission Division had been restructured as the Transmission and Technical Services Division based in Guildford, and a Technology Planning and Research Division based in London, the latter was formed from the Research Division System Technical and Generation Studies Branches.

A Corporate Strategy Department was formed in 1981 from some of the Planning Department. A Nuclear Operations Support Group was also formed in 1981 to provide expert support.

The sculpture &quot;Power in Trust&quot; from the CEGB logo was made by Norman Sillman to represent a hand made from boiler pipes and a turbine, it was commissioned in the 1961 for the opening of Staythorpe B Power Station.

When first constituted the CEGB&#x27;s London headquarters was at the former Central Electricity Authority&#x27;s building in Winsley Street W1, there were also offices in Buchanan House, 24/30 Holborn, London, EC1.

=== Employees ===
There were a total of 131,178 employees in the electricity supply industry 1989, composed as follows:
== Infrastructure ==
The CEGB spent more on industrial construction than any other organisation in the UK. In 1958 about 40 power stations were being planned or constructed at a capital cost of £800 million.

=== Power stations ===
Those public supply power stations that were in operation at any time between 1958 and 1990 were owned and operated by the CEGB. In 1971–1972 there were 183 power stations on 156 sites, with an installed capacity of 58,880.051 MW, and supplied 190,525 GWh. By 1981–1982 there were 108 power stations with a capacity of 55,185 MW and supplied 210,289 GWh.

=== National Grid ===
At its inception the CEGB operated 2,763 circuit km of high-tension 275 kV supergrid. The growth of the high voltage National Grid over the lifetime of the CEGB is demonstrated in the following table.
===Substations===

In 1981–2 there was a total of 203 substations operating at 275/400 kV, these sub-stations included 570 transformers operating at 275/400 kV.

== Operations ==

=== Control of generation and the National Grid ===
At the centre of operations was the National Control Centre of the National Grid in London, which was part of the control hierarchy for the system. The National Control Centre was based in Bankside House from 1962. There were also both area and district Grid Control Areas, which were originally at Newcastle upon Tyne, Leeds, Manchester, Nottingham, Birmingham, St Albans, East Grinstead and Bristol. The shift control engineers who worked in these control centres would cost, schedule and load-dispatch an economic commitment of generation to the main interconnected system (the 400/275/132kV network) at an adequate level of security. They also had information about the running costs and availability of every power producing plant in England and Wales. They constantly anticipated demand, monitored and instructed power stations to increase, reduce or stop electricity production. They used the &quot;merit order&quot;, a ranking of each generator in power stations based upon how much they cost to produce electricity. The objective was to ensure that electricity production and transmission was achieved at the lowest possible cost.

In 1981 the three-tier corporate transmission structure: National Control, area control rooms in the regions, and district control rooms (areas) was changed to a two-tier structure by merging the area and district control rooms.

=== Electricity supplies and sales ===
The electricity generated, supplied and sold by the CEGB, in GWh, was as follows:

Note: imports are bulk supplies from the South of Scotland and France and from private sources, exports are bulk supplies to the South of Scotland and France.

=== Financial statistics ===
A summary of the income and expenditure of the CEGB (in £ million) is as follows:
===Regions===
Detailed control of operational matters such planning, electricity generation, transmission and maintenance were delegated to five geographical regions. From January 1971 each region had a director-general, a director of generation, a director of operational planning, a director of transmission, a financial controller, a controller of scientific services and a personnel manager.

====Midlands Region====
Regional headquarters: Haslucks Green Road, Shirley, Solihull, West Midlands.

The Midlands Region was responsible for the operation of 38 power stations, over 170 sub-stations and nearly 2,000 miles of grid transmission line in an area that covered 11,000 square miles. The region produced more than a quarter of the electricity used in England and Wales and had a major share of the industrial construction programme mounted by the CEGB during the 1960s.

In 1948 the total generating capacity of all the power stations in the region was 2,016 MW only a little more than a modern 2,000 MW station. By 1957 the region&#x27;s capacity was up to 4,000 MW, doubling to 8,000 MW by 1966 and rising to 14,000 MW in 1969 and 16,000 MW by 1971.

Previous chairmen of the Midlands Region were Arthur Hawkins, Gilbert Blackman, and R. L. Batley.

Prior to 1968 the Midlands Region was divided into the West Midlands Division and the East Midlands Division. The number of power stations, installed capacity and electricity supplied in the Midlands Region was:
====North Eastern Region====
Regional Headquarters: Merrion Centre, Leeds (1971). Beckwith Knowle, Otley Road, Harrogate.

Extending through Northumberland, Durham, Yorkshire and North Lincolnshire the North Eastern Region was responsible for the operation of 32 power stations capable of producing 8,000 MW of electricity. 108 substations and over 1,200 route miles of overhead lines transmitted the electricity to the Yorkshire Electricity Board and the North Eastern Electricity Board for passing onto the customer.

A previous chairman of the North Eastern Region was P.J. Squire.

Prior to 1968 the North Eastern Region was divided into the Northern Division and the Yorkshire Division. The number of power stations, installed capacity and electricity supplied in the North Eastern Region was:
====North Western Region====
Regional Headquarters: 825 Wilmslow Road, Manchester, M20 (1971). Europa House, Bird Hall Lane, Cheadle Heath, Stockport.

Previous chairman of the North Western Region were J.L. Ashworth and G.B. Jackson.

The number of power stations, installed capacity and electricity supplied in the North Western Region was:
====South Eastern Region====
Regional Headquarters: Bankside House, Summer Street, London.

Past chairman of the South Eastern Region were G.N. Stone, H.J. Bennett and F.W. Skelcher.

Prior to 1968 the South Eastern Region was divided into the North Thames Division and the South Thames Division. The number of power stations, installed capacity and electricity supplied in the South Eastern Region was:
====South Western Region====
Regional Headquarters: 15–23 Oakfield Grove, Clifton, Bristol (1971). Bedminster Down, Bridgwater Road, Bristol. Previous chairman of the South Western Region were Douglas Pask, Roy Beatt, A.C. Thirtle and R.H. Coates. Prior to 1968 the South Western Region was divided into the Southern Division, the Western Division and the South Wales Division. The number of power stations, installed capacity and electricity supplied in the South Western Region was:
=== Supplies to area boards ===
The supplies of electricity from the CEGB Regions to the area electricity boards in 1971–2 and 1981–2 were as follows. The average charge in 1971–2 was 0.6519 pence/kWh, in 1981–2 the charge was 3.0615 pence/kWh.

During the lifetime of the CEGB peak demand had more than doubled from 19,311 MW in 1958 to 47,925 MW in 1987. Sales of electricity had increased from 79.7 TWh in 1958 to 240 TWh in 1988.

===Research and development===
The CEGB had an extensive R&amp;D section with its three principal laboratories at Leatherhead (Central Electricity Research Laboratories, CERL) (opened by the Minister of Power in May 1962), Marchwood Engineering Laboratory (MEL), and Berkeley Nuclear Laboratories (BNL). There were also five regional facilities and four project groups, North, South, Midlands and the Transmission Project Group. These scientific service departments (SSD) had a base in each region. A major SSD role was solving engineering problems with the several designs of 500 MW units. These were a significant increase in unit size and had many teething problems, most of which were solved to result in reliable service and gave good experience towards the design of the 660 MW units.

In the 1970s and 1980s, for the real-time control of power stations the R&amp;D team developed the Cutlass programming language and application system. After privatisation, CUTLASS systems in National Power were phased out and replaced largely with Advanced Plant Management System (APMS) – a SCADA solution developed in partnership by RWE npower (a descendant company of CEGB) and Thales UK. APMS itself has since become obsolete. However, Eggborough was the last station, particularly unit 2; fully operated using APMS until its decommissioning in 2017.

In contrast, PowerGen, later taken over by E.ON (which further split to form Uniper), undertook a programme to port the entire system to current hardware. The most current version of Cutlass, &#x27;PT-Cutlass Kit 9&#x27;, runs on Motorola PPC-based hardware, with the engineering workstation and administrative functions provided by a standard Microsoft Windows PC. It is fully compatible (with a few minor exceptions) with the DEC PDP-11 version (kit 1) released by PowerGen and has a high level of compatibility with the final version of kit 1 formerly used at National Power. It is used at three UK power stations: Ratcliffe-on-Soar, Cottam, and Fiddlers Ferry.

== Policies and strategies ==
The CEGB was subject to examination from external bodies and formed policies and strategies to meet its responsibilities.

=== External ===
A 1978 government white paper &quot;Re-organisation of the Electricity Supply in England and Wales&quot; proposed the creation of an Electricity Corporation to unify the fragmented structure of the industry. Parliamentary constraints prevented its enactment.

A report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, &quot;Central Electricity Generating Board: a Report on the Operation by the Board of its system for the generation and supply of Electricity in bulk&quot; was published in 1981. The report found that the CEGB&#x27;s operations were efficient but that their investment appraisal operated against the public interest.

=== Internal ===
In 1964 the CEGB chose the Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor, developed by the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority, for a programme of new station construction. The five stations were: Dungeness B, Hinkley Point B, Hartlepool, Heysham and Hunterston B.

In 1976 the CEGB introduced an accelerated power station closure programme. On 25 October 23 power stations were closed and 18 partly closed, with a combined capacity of 2,884 MW. Six further stations with a capacity of 649 MW were closed in March 1977.

In 1979 the CEGB and the National Coal Board entered a joint understanding that the CEGB would endeavour to take 75 million tonnes of coal per year to 1985 provided the pithead price did not increase above the rate of inflation.

In 1981 the CEGB applied for planning consent to build a 1,200 MW pressurized water reactor at Sizewell. There was a lengthy public inquiry.

In 1981 the CEGB introduced another accelerated power station closure programme. On 26 October 16 power stations were closed with a combined capacity of 3,402 MW. A further 1,320 MW of capacity was maintained unmanned in reserve.

==Privatisation==
The electricity market in the UK was built upon the break-up of the CEGB into four companies in the 1990s. Its generation (or upstream) activities were transferred to three generating companies, &#x27;PowerGen&#x27;, &#x27;National Power&#x27;, and &#x27;Nuclear Electric&#x27; (later &#x27;British Energy&#x27;, eventually &#x27;EDF Energy&#x27;); and its transmission (or downstream) activities to the &#x27;National Grid Company&#x27;.

The shares in National Grid were distributed to the regional electricity companies prior to their own privatisation in 1990. PowerGen and National Power were privatised in 1991, with 60% stakes in each company sold to investors, the remaining 40% being held by the UK government. The privatisation process was initially delayed as it was concluded that the &#x27;earlier decided nuclear power plant assets in National Power&#x27; would not be included in the private National Power. A new company was formed, Nuclear Electric, which would eventually own and operate the nuclear power assets, and the nuclear power stations were held in public ownership for a number of years.

In 1995, the government sold its 40% stakes, and the assets of Nuclear Electric and Scottish Nuclear were both combined and split. The combination process merged operations of UK&#x27;s eight most advanced nuclear plants – seven Advanced Gas Cooled Reactor (AGR) and one Pressurised Water Reactor (PWR) – into a new private company founded in 1996, &#x27;British Energy&#x27; (now &#x27;EDF Energy&#x27;). The splitting process created a separate company in 1996 called &#x27;Magnox Electric&#x27; to hold the older Magnox reactors, later combined with BNFL.

Although electricity privatisation began in 1990, the CEGB continued to exist until the &quot;Central Electricity Generating Board (Dissolution) Order 2001&quot;, a statutory instrument, came into force on 9 November 2001.

Powergen is now E.ON UK, owned by the German utility company E.ON, who then further split to form Uniper, who own the majority of the former E.On conventional power generation. National Power split into a UK business, &#x27;Innogy&#x27;, now &#x27;RWE npower&#x27;, owned by the German utility company RWE, and an international business, &#x27;International Power&#x27;, now Engie Energy International and owned by the French company Engie.

<doc id="340756" wikidata="Q1824214" url="?curid=340756" title="Couchette car">
<text>A couchette car is a railway carriage conveying non or semi-private sleeping accommodation.

==Overview==

The car is divided into a number of compartments (typically 8 to 10) accessed from the side corridor of the car, which in daytime are configured with a bench seat along each long side of the compartment. At an appropriate time in the journey, the attendant who travels in the car (or by agreement the passengers booked in the compartment) converts the compartment into its night-time configuration with two (1st class) or three (2nd class) bunks on each long side of the compartment, creating a total of four bunks in first class and six in second class.

Typically, in 2nd class the seat serves as the lowest bunk, and the back of the seat is turned into a horizontal position and serves as the middle bunk. There are two types of couchette car in countries of the former USSR: &quot;coupé&quot; and &quot;platzkart&quot;. &quot;Coupé&quot; cars are more expensive and comfortable with 4-bunk compartments fully separated from each other and the corridor. The cheaper &quot;Platzkart&quot; cars, use a somewhat different layout, with no wall between compartment and corridor, only four bunks along the long sides of the compartment, and two more mounted on the corridor wall, the lower bunk folding in the daytime to become two seats.

The attendant provides a sheet, blanket, and pillow for each passenger. Unlike in sleeping cars, couchette compartments are not always segregated by sex, and it is normal not to undress except for removing footwear.
One compartment at the end of the car is reserved for the use of the attendant (who may supervise two adjacent cars), who will sell (if not included in the fare) hot and cold drinks and continental breakfasts in the morning. In western Europe the attendant will take charge of passengers&#x27; tickets and passports at the start of the journey, returning them before arrival at the destination, thus ensuring that passengers are not disturbed by ticket and passport inspections. In some former eastern bloc countries this is not done, and it is normal for passengers to be awoken by border police and railway inspectors at each border crossing. Toilets and washrooms are located at the ends of the car.

Couchette cars have not been as popular in Britain (except on the Royal Train, presumably as staff accommodation); as they have been in continental Europe, although a number of sleeper trains can trace their history back to as early as the 1870s. It was normal practice, nevertheless, for British passengers to join long-distance overnight trains at Calais, Boulogne, Ostend or Hook of Holland after crossing the English Channel or North Sea by ferry. There has been a substantial decline in the number of long-distance overnight train services since the mid-1990s, caused by the increase in the number of high-speed daytime services, and competition from low-cost airlines. Environmental organizations are trying to make night trains more attractive again, as a more climate-friendly alternative to short-haul flights.

<doc id="340757" wikidata="Q180241" url="?curid=340757" title="Internal energy">
<text>The internal energy of a thermodynamic system is the energy of the system as a state function, measured as the quantity of energy necessary to bring the system from its standard internal state to its present internal state of interest, accounting for the gains and losses of energy due to changes in its internal state, including such quantities as magnetization. It excludes the kinetic energy of motion of the system as a whole and the potential energy of position of the system as a whole, with respect to its surroundings and external force fields. It includes the thermal energy, &quot;i.e.&quot;, the constituent particles&#x27; kinetic energies of motion relative to the motion of the system as a whole. Without a thermodynamic process, the internal energy of an isolated system cannot change, as expressed in the law of conservation of energy, a foundation of the first law of thermodynamics. The notion has been introduced to describe the systems characterized by temperature variations, temperature being added to the set of state parameters, the position variables known in mechanics (and their conjugated generalized force parameters), in a similar way to potential energy of the conservative fields of force, gravitational and electrostatic. Its author is Rudolf Clausius. Without transfer of matter, internal energy changes equal the algebraic sum of the heat transferred and the work done. In systems without temperature changes, internal energy changes equal the work done by/on the system.

The internal energy cannot be measured absolutely. Thermodynamics concerns &quot;changes&quot; in the internal energy, not its absolute value. The processes that change the internal energy are transfers, into or out of the system, of substance, or of energy, as heat, or by thermodynamic work. These processes are measured by changes in the system&#x27;s properties, such as temperature, entropy, volume, electric polarization, and molar constitution. The internal energy depends only on the internal state of the system and not on the particular choice from many possible processes by which energy may pass into or out of the system. It is a state variable, a thermodynamic potential, and an extensive property.

Thermodynamics defines internal energy macroscopically, for the body as a whole. In statistical mechanics, the internal energy of a body can be analyzed microscopically in terms of the kinetic energies of microscopic motion of the system&#x27;s particles from translations, rotations, and vibrations, and of the potential energies associated with microscopic forces, including chemical bonds.

The unit of energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J). The internal energy relative to the mass with unit J/kg is the &quot;specific internal energy&quot;. The corresponding quantity relative to the amount of substance with unit J/mol is the &quot;molar internal energy&quot;.

==Cardinal functions==
The internal energy of a system depends on its entropy S, its volume V and its number of massive particles: . It expresses the thermodynamics of a system in the &quot;energy representation&quot;. As a function of state, its arguments are exclusively extensive variables of state. Alongside the internal energy, the other cardinal function of state of a thermodynamic system is its entropy, as a function, , of the same list of extensive variables of state, except that the entropy, , is replaced in the list by the internal energy, . It expresses the &quot;entropy representation&quot;.

Each cardinal function is a monotonic function of each of its &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;canonical&quot; variables. Each provides its &quot;characteristic&quot; or &quot;fundamental&quot; equation, for example , that by itself contains all thermodynamic information about the system. The fundamental equations for the two cardinal functions can in principle be interconverted by solving, for example, for , to get .

In contrast, Legendre transformations are necessary to derive fundamental equations for other thermodynamic potentials and Massieu functions. The entropy as a function only of extensive state variables is the one and only &quot;cardinal function&quot; of state for the generation of Massieu functions. It is not itself customarily designated a &#x27;Massieu function&#x27;, though rationally it might be thought of as such, corresponding to the term &#x27;thermodynamic potential&#x27;, which includes the internal energy.

For real and practical systems, explicit expressions of the fundamental equations are almost always unavailable, but the functional relations exist in principle. Formal, in principle, manipulations of them are valuable for the understanding of thermodynamics.

==Description and definition==
The internal energy formula_1 of a given state of the system is determined relative to that of a standard state of the system, by adding up the macroscopic transfers of energy that accompany a change of state from the reference state to the given state:

where formula_3 denotes the difference between the internal energy of the given state and that of the reference state,
and the formula_4 are the various energies transferred to the system in the steps from the reference state to the given state.
It is the energy needed to create the given state of the system from the reference state. From a non-relativistic microscopic point of view, it may be divided into microscopic potential energy, formula_5, and microscopic kinetic energy, formula_6, components:
: formula_7

The microscopic kinetic energy of a system arises as the sum of the motions of all the system&#x27;s particles with respect to the center-of-mass frame, whether it be the motion of atoms, molecules, atomic nuclei, electrons, or other particles. The microscopic potential energy algebraic summative components are those of the chemical and nuclear particle bonds, and the physical force fields within the system, such as due to internal induced electric or magnetic dipole moment, as well as the energy of deformation of solids (stress-strain). Usually, the split into microscopic kinetic and potential energies is outside the scope of macroscopic thermodynamics.

Internal energy does not include the energy due to motion or location of a system as a whole. That is to say, it excludes any kinetic or potential energy the body may have because of its motion or location in external gravitational, electrostatic, or electromagnetic fields. It does, however, include the contribution of such a field to the energy due to the coupling of the internal degrees of freedom of the system with the field. In such a case, the field is included in the thermodynamic description of the object in the form of an additional external parameter.

For practical considerations in thermodynamics or engineering, it is rarely necessary, convenient, nor even possible, to consider all energies belonging to the total intrinsic energy of a sample system, such as the energy given by the equivalence of mass. Typically, descriptions only include components relevant to the system under study. Indeed, in most systems under consideration, especially through thermodynamics, it is impossible to calculate the total internal energy. Therefore, a convenient null reference point may be chosen for the internal energy.

The internal energy is an extensive property: it depends on the size of the system, or on the amount of substance it contains.

At any temperature greater than absolute zero, microscopic potential energy and kinetic energy are constantly converted into one another, but the sum remains constant in an isolated system (cf. table). In the classical picture of thermodynamics, kinetic energy vanishes at zero temperature and the internal energy is purely potential energy. However, quantum mechanics has demonstrated that even at zero temperature particles maintain a residual energy of motion, the zero point energy. A system at absolute zero is merely in its quantum-mechanical ground state, the lowest energy state available. At absolute zero a system of given composition has attained its minimum attainable entropy.

The microscopic kinetic energy portion of the internal energy gives rise to the temperature of the system. Statistical mechanics relates the pseudo-random kinetic energy of individual particles to the mean kinetic energy of the entire ensemble of particles comprising a system. Furthermore, it relates the mean microscopic kinetic energy to the macroscopically observed empirical property that is expressed as temperature of the system. While temperature is an intensive measure, this energy expresses the concept as an extensive property of the system, often referred to as the &quot;thermal energy&quot;, The scaling property between temperature and thermal energy is the entropy change of the system.
Statistical mechanics considers any system to be statistically distributed across an ensemble of formula_8 microstates. In a system that is in thermodynamic contact equilibrium with a heat reservoir, each microstate has an energy formula_4 and is associated with a probability formula_10. The internal energy is the mean value of the system&#x27;s total energy, i.e., the sum of all microstate energies, each weighted by its probability of occurrence:
: formula_11
This is the statistical expression of the law of conservation of energy.

===Internal energy changes===
Thermodynamics is chiefly concerned with the changes in internal energy formula_3.

For a closed system, with mass transfer excluded, the changes in internal energy are due to heat transfer formula_13 and due to thermodynamic work formula_14 done &quot;by&quot; the system on its surroundings. Accordingly, the internal energy change formula_3 for a process may be written
formula_16

When a closed system receives energy as heat, this energy increases the internal energy. It is distributed between microscopic kinetic and microscopic potential energies. In general, thermodynamics does not trace this distribution. In an ideal gas all of the extra energy results in a temperature increase, as it is stored solely as microscopic kinetic energy; such heating is said to be &quot;sensible&quot;.

A second kind of mechanism of change in the internal energy of a closed system changed is in its doing of work on its surroundings. Such work may be simply mechanical, as when the system expands to drive a piston, or, for example, when the system changes its electric polarization so as to drive a change in the electric field in the surroundings.

If the system is not closed, the third mechanism that can increase the internal energy is transfer of substance into the system. This increase, formula_17 cannot be split into heat and work components. If the system is so set up physically that heat transfer and work that it does are by pathways separate from and independent of matter transfer, then the transfers of energy add to change the internal energy:
formula_18

If a system undergoes certain phase transformations while being heated, such as melting and vaporization, it may be observed that the temperature of the system does not change until the entire sample has completed the transformation. The energy introduced into the system while the temperature does not change is called &quot;latent energy&quot; or latent heat, in contrast to sensible heat, which is associated with temperature change.

==Internal energy of the ideal gas==
Thermodynamics often uses the concept of the ideal gas for teaching purposes, and as an approximation for working systems. The ideal gas consists of particles considered as point objects that interact only by elastic collisions and fill a volume such that their mean free path between collisions is much larger than their diameter. Such systems approximate monatomic gases such as helium and other noble gases. For an ideal gas the kinetic energy consists only of the translational energy of the individual atoms. Monatomic particles do not possess rotational or vibrational degrees of freedom, and are not electronically excited to higher energies except at very high temperatures.

Therefore, the internal energy of an ideal gas depends solely on its temperature (and the number of gas particles): formula_19. It is not dependent on other thermodynamic quantities such as pressure or density.

The internal energy of an ideal gas is proportional to its amount of substance (number of moles) formula_8 and to its temperature formula_21
: formula_22

where formula_23 is the isochoric (at constant volume) molar heat capacity of the gas; formula_23 is constant for an ideal gas. The internal energy of any gas (ideal or not) may be written as a function of the three extensive properties formula_25, formula_26, formula_8 (entropy, volume, number of moles). In case of the ideal gas it is in the following way 

: formula_28

where formula_29 is an arbitrary positive constant and where formula_30 is the universal gas constant. It is easily seen that formula_1 is a linearly homogeneous function of the three variables (that is, it is &quot;extensive&quot; in these variables), and that it is weakly convex. Knowing temperature and pressure to be the derivatives 
formula_32 formula_33 the ideal gas law formula_34 immediately follows as below:

: formula_35
: formula_36
: formula_37
: formula_34

==Internal energy of a closed thermodynamic system==
The above summation of all components of change in internal energy assumes that a positive energy denotes heat added to the system or the negative of work done by the system on its surroundings.

This relationship may be expressed in infinitesimal terms using the differentials of each term, though only the internal energy is an exact differential. For a closed system, with transfers only as heat and work, the change in the internal energy is
: formula_39
expressing the first law of thermodynamics. It may be expressed in terms of other thermodynamic parameters. Each term is composed of an intensive variable (a generalized force) and its conjugate infinitesimal extensive variable (a generalized displacement).

For example, the mechanical work done by the system may be related to the pressure formula_40 and volume change formula_41. The pressure is the intensive generalized force, while the volume change is the extensive generalized displacement:
: formula_42
This defines the direction of work, formula_14, to be energy transfer from the working system to the surroundings, indicated by a positive term. Taking the direction of heat transfer formula_13 to be into the working fluid and assuming a reversible process, the heat is
: formula_45
where formula_21 denotes the temperature, and formula_25 denotes the entropy.

The change in internal energy becomes
: formula_48

===Changes due to temperature and volume===
The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is
This is useful if the equation of state is known.

In case of an ideal gas, we can derive that formula_49, i.e. the internal energy of an ideal gas can be written as a function that depends only on the temperature.

The expression relating changes in internal energy to changes in temperature and volume is

:formula_50

The equation of state is the ideal gas law

:formula_51

Solve for pressure:
:formula_52

Substitute in to internal energy expression:
:formula_53

Take the derivative of pressure with respect to temperature:
:formula_54

Replace:

:formula_55

And simplify:

:formula_56


To express formula_57 in terms of formula_58 and formula_41, the term

:formula_60

is substituted in the fundamental thermodynamic relation

:formula_48

This gives

:formula_62

The term formula_63 is the heat capacity at constant volume formula_64

The partial derivative of formula_25 with respect to formula_26 can be evaluated if the equation of state is known. From the fundamental thermodynamic relation, it follows that the differential of the Helmholtz free energy formula_67 is given by

:formula_68

The symmetry of second derivatives of formula_67 with respect to formula_21 and formula_26 yields the Maxwell relation:
:formula_72

This gives the expression above.
===Changes due to temperature and pressure===
When considering fluids or solids, an expression in terms of the temperature and pressure is usually more useful:

:formula_73

where it is assumed that the heat capacity at constant pressure is related to the heat capacity at constant volume according to

:formula_74
The partial derivative of the pressure with respect to temperature at constant volume can be expressed in terms of the coefficient of thermal expansion 
:formula_75

and the isothermal compressibility
:formula_76

by writing
and equating d&quot;V&quot; to zero and solving for the ratio d&quot;P&quot;/d&quot;T&quot;. This gives
{\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}\right)_{T}}= \frac{\alpha}{\beta_{T}}. &lt;/math&gt;|}}

Substituting () and () in () gives the above expression.
===Changes due to volume at constant temperature===
The internal pressure is defined as a partial derivative of the internal energy with respect to the volume at constant temperature:
:formula_77

==Internal energy of multi-component systems==

In addition to including the entropy formula_25 and volume formula_26 terms in the internal energy, a system is often described also in terms of the number of particles or chemical species it contains:

:formula_80

where formula_81 are the molar amounts of constituents of type formula_82 in the system. The internal energy is an extensive function of the extensive variables formula_25, formula_26, and the amounts formula_81, the internal energy may be written as a linearly homogeneous function of first degree:
: formula_86
where formula_87 is a factor describing the growth of the system. The differential internal energy may be written as
:formula_88

which shows (or defines) temperature formula_21 to be the partial derivative of formula_1 with respect to entropy formula_25 and pressure formula_40 to be the negative of the similar derivative with respect to volume formula_26,
: formula_32
: formula_33

and where the coefficients formula_96 are the chemical potentials for the components of type formula_97 in the system. The chemical potentials are defined as the partial derivatives of the internal energy with respect to the variations in composition:
:formula_98
As conjugate variables to the composition formula_99, the chemical potentials are intensive properties, intrinsically characteristic of the qualitative nature of the system, and not proportional to its extent. Under conditions of constant formula_21 and formula_40, because of the extensive nature of formula_1 and its independent variables, using Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem, the differential formula_103 may be integrated and yields an expression for the internal energy:
:formula_104

The sum over the composition of the system is the Gibbs free energy:
:formula_105
that arises from changing the composition of the system at constant temperature and pressure. For a single component system, the chemical potential equals the Gibbs energy per amount of substance, i.e. particles or moles according to the original definition of the unit for formula_99.

==Internal energy in an elastic medium==
For an elastic medium the potential energy component of the internal energy has an elastic nature expressed in terms of the stress formula_107 and strain formula_108 involved in elastic processes. In Einstein notation for tensors, with summation over repeated indices, for unit volume, the infinitesimal statement is

: formula_109

Euler&#x27;s theorem yields for the internal energy:

: formula_110

For a linearly elastic material, the stress is related to the strain by

: formula_111
where the formula_112 are the components of the 4th-rank elastic constant tensor of the medium.

Elastic deformations, such as sound, passing through a body, or other forms of macroscopic internal agitation or turbulent motion create states when the system is not in thermodynamic equilibrium. While such energies of motion continue, they contribute to the total energy of the system; thermodynamic internal energy pertains only when such motions have ceased.

==History==
James Joule studied the relationship between heat, work, and temperature. He observed that friction in a liquid, such as caused by its agitation with work by a paddle wheel, caused an increase in its temperature, which he described as producing a &quot;quantity of heat&quot;. Expressed in modern units, he found that c. 4186 joules of energy were needed to raise the temperature of one kilogram of water by one degree Celsius.

<text>A discussion group is a group of individuals, typically who share a similar interest, who gather either formally or informally to discuss ideas, solve problems, or make comments. Common methods of conversing including meeting in person, conducting conference calls, using text messaging, or using a website such as an Internet forum. People respond, add comments, and make posts on such forums, as well as on established mailing lists, in news groups, or in IRC channels. Other group members could choose to respond by posting text or image.

==Brief history==

Discussion group was evolved from USENET which is a traced back to early 80&#x27;s. Two computer scientists Jim Ellis and Tom Truscott founded the idea of setting a system of rules to produce &quot;articles&quot;, and then send back to their parallel news group. Fundamentally, the form of discussion group was generated on the concept of USENET, which emphasised ways of communication via email and web forums. Gradually, USENET had developed to be a system of channels which provide notifications and &quot;articles&quot; to meet general public&#x27;s needs. Nowadays, World Wide Web gradually takes on the major role of supporting and extending platforms for discussion group on the Internet by setting up various web servers.

==Small-Group Discussions==
Small-Group Discussions, consisting of a minimum of three and maximum of about 20 people, have been found to be more effective in medical teaching.

==Overview of popular online discussion group systems==

===Google Groups===

Google Groups has become one of the major online discussion groups, with a wide range of worldwide frequent users. Features include:
* the ability for anyone to create new groups and join existing groups.
* the ability to search for groups that focus on specific subject matter, as well as advanced search features that allow the search results to be filtered by date, language, and post author, among others.
* three levels of group participation: public, announcements only, and restricted.

===Facebook groups===

Facebook groups simplify processes and protect the privacy of users when they interact with people. Users can create a group and delegate admins. Group admins are able to make a range of adjustments to the group page, such as changing its cover photo, moderating posts and comments, and pinning posts so that they permanently appear at the top of the group page. Admins can also create group events, news updates and manage group members. By default, groups are public, and anyone can join them at the discretion of that group&#x27;s admins. However, groups may be marked as private — a user may only join such a group if an existing member sends them an invitation. A single user is capable of joining a maximum of 6000 groups.

===WhatsApp groups===

WhatsApp is a mobile messaging app with group discussion features. Users can create group chats to facilitate group discussions. By default, all group members are admins of that group, but this may be changed at the discretion of any existing admin. Admins have the ability to rename the group, add and remove members, and delete messages that have been sent to the group.

==Advantages==
*Advantages: the implementation of Google Groups comes with its own advantages. For diverse users, it provides the service of interpreting languages widely, which helps present a better way to communicate effectively with people in different countries. Considering of storage, one group member enjoys &quot;100 megabytes (MB)&quot; while there are no restrictions for the whole group. It delivers convenience for group members work on projects that need considerably more storage than normal files, for example, presentations. Studies conducted by Kushin and Kitchener indicates Facebook provide users in discussion groups with more opportunities to post content that has correlation with &quot;social, political, or sporting issues&quot;. For WhatsApp users, the communication service brings enjoyment to share ideas with comparatively low cost. Ideally, it enhanced the quality of communication regarding of its records saving, security and trustability.
*Information in Discussion groups are usually archived. For example, Google&#x27;s &quot;Groups&quot; (formerly DejaNews) is an archive of Usenet articles trace back to 1981. Discussion group archives are sometimes an effective way to find an answer to very ambiguous questions.

== Academic==
*Small group of professionals or students formally or informally negotiate about an academic topic within certain fields. This implementation could be seen as an investigation or research based on various academic levels. For instance, &quot;one hundred eighty college-level psychology students&quot; breakdown into different groups to participate in giving an orderly arrangement of preferred events. Nevertheless, discussion groups could support professional services and hold events to a range of demographics; another distinguished example is from &quot;The London Biological Mass Spectrometry Discussion Group&quot;, which sustainably operates by gathering &quot;technicians, clinicians, academics, industrialists and students&quot; to exchange ideas on an academic level. It attributes to the development of participants&#x27; cognitive, critical thinking, and analytical skills.

<doc id="340762" wikidata="Q4875869" url="?curid=340762" title="Beachhead">
<text>A beachhead is a temporary line created when a military unit reaches a landing beach by sea and begins to defend the area as other reinforcements arrive. Once a large enough unit is assembled, the invading force can begin advancing inland. The term is sometimes used interchangeably (both correctly and incorrectly) with &quot;bridgehead&quot; and &quot;lodgement&quot;. Beachheads were important in many military actions; examples include operations such as &quot;Operation Neptune&quot; during World War II, the Korean War (especially at Inchon), and the Vietnam War.

Although many references state that &quot;Operation Neptune&quot; refers to the naval operations in support of &quot;Operation Overlord&quot;, the most reliable references make it clear that &quot;Overlord&quot; referred to the establishment of a large-scale &quot;lodgement&quot; in Normandy, and that &quot;Neptune&quot; referred to the landing phase which created the beachhead; &quot;Neptune&quot; was therefore the first part of &quot;Overlord&quot;. According to the D-Day Museum:

Once an amphibious assault starts, victory tends to go to the side which can reinforce the beachhead most quickly. Occasionally, the amphibious forces do not expand their beachheads quickly enough to create a &quot;lodgement&quot; area before the defenders can reinforce their positions; in these cases, the defending forces tend to be victorious. This is exemplified by the landing at Suvla Bay in the Gallipoli Campaign during World War I and the amphibious landing at Anzio (during Operation Shingle) as part of the Italian Campaign of World War II.

<doc id="340772" wikidata="Q4894574" url="?curid=340772" title="Bernstein v. United States">
<text>Bernstein v. United States was a series of court cases filed by Daniel J. Bernstein, a mathematics Ph.D. student at the University of California, Berkeley, challenging U.S. government restrictions on the export of cryptographic software. In the early 1990s, the U.S. government classified encryption software as a &quot;munition,&quot; imposing strict export controls. As a result, Bernstein was required to register as an arms dealer and obtain an export license before he could publish his encryption software online.

With the support of the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), Bernstein filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government, arguing that the export controls violated his First Amendment rights. The case ultimately led to a relaxation of export restrictions on cryptography, which facilitated the development of secure international e-commerce. The decision has been recognized by First Amendment and technology advocacy groups for affirming a &quot;right to code&quot; and applying First Amendment protections to code as a form of expression.

==History==
The case was first brought in 1995, when Bernstein was a student at University of California, Berkeley, and wanted to publish a paper and associated source code on his Snuffle encryption system. Bernstein was represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, who hired outside lawyer Cindy Cohn and also obtained &quot;pro bono publico&quot; assistance from Lee Tien of Berkeley; M. Edward Ross of the San Francisco law firm of Steefel, Levitt &amp; Weiss; James Wheaton and Elizabeth Pritzker of the First Amendment Project in Oakland; and Robert Corn-Revere, Julia Kogan, and Jeremy Miller of the Washington, DC, law firm of Hogan &amp; Hartson. After four years and one regulatory change, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that software source code was speech protected by the First Amendment and that the government&#x27;s regulations preventing its publication were unconstitutional. Regarding those regulations, the EFF states:
The government requested &quot;en banc&quot; review. In &quot;Bernstein v. U.S. Dept. of Justice&quot;, 192 F.3d 1308 (9th Cir. 1999), the Ninth Circuit ordered that this case be reheard by the &quot;en banc&quot; court, and withdrew the three-judge panel opinion, &quot;Bernstein v. U.S. Dept. of Justice&quot;, 176 F.3d 1132 (9th Cir. 1999).

The government modified the regulations again, substantially loosening them, and Bernstein, then a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, challenged them again. This time, he chose to represent himself, although he had no formal legal training. On October 15, 2003, almost nine years after Bernstein first brought the case, the judge dismissed it and asked Bernstein to come back when the government made a &quot;concrete threat&quot;.

<doc id="340774" wikidata="Q2777701" url="?curid=340774" title="Steve Urkel">
<text>Steven Quincy Urkel is a fictional character on the American ABC/CBS sitcom &quot;Family Matters&quot;, portrayed by Jaleel White. Originally slated for a single appearance, he broke out to be the show&#x27;s most popular character, gradually becoming its protagonist. Due to the character&#x27;s off-putting characteristics, a tendency to stir up events, and his role in the show&#x27;s plotlines, he is considered a nuisance by the original protagonist&#x27;s family, the Winslows. However, they come to accept him over time.

The character epitomizes a geek or nerd of the era, with large, thick eyeglasses, flood pants held up by suspenders, bad posture, multi-colored cardigan sweaters, saddle shoes, and a high-pitched voice. He professes love for his neighbor Laura Winslow. This love often leads to mishaps that trigger plot points and crises, and is unrequited until the series&#x27; end.

Throughout the series, Urkel is central to many of its running gags, primarily property damage and personal injury resulting from his inventions going awry or his clumsiness. The character became associated with catchphrases including &quot;I&#x27;ve fallen and I can&#x27;t get up!&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t have to take this. I&#x27;m going home.&quot;, &quot;Did I do that?&quot;, &quot;Whoa, Mama!&quot;, and &quot;Look what you did!&quot;

== Character development ==
Steve Urkel first appeared in the show&#x27;s twelfth episode, &quot;Laura&#x27;s First Date&quot;, where he is introduced as a nerdy young boy who takes Laura Winslow out on a date. Despite him being madly in love with her, Laura finds Steve grating and doesn&#x27;t return his affection. While initially intended to be a minor character, Urkel became very popular with audiences for his oddball antics, and became a recurring character. To naturally introduce the character to audiences upon repeated viewings, the creators added a scene with Steve to the show&#x27;s fourth episode &quot;Rachel&#x27;s First Date&quot;, which became his first appearance in syndication. Steve joined the main cast beginning with the season-two premiere &quot;Rachel&#x27;s Place&quot;.

&quot;Family Matters&quot; co-creator Michael Warren named the character after his friend, writer and director Steve Erkel. Due to the show and the character&#x27;s tremendous popularity during the early 1990s, Erkel encountered difficulties using his own name. He received many prank phone calls from &quot;Laura&quot; asking for &quot;Steve&quot;, and businesses found his name to be suspicious. Warren stated that had he known the character would reappear for years, he would not have named him after his friend.

=== Portrayal ===
Steve Urkel embodies the stereotype of a socially inept intellectual who means well but often messes things up. Despite his intelligence, his actions often come across as clumsy and foolish. He is fiercely protective of and obsessed with Laura Winslow, and this admiration extends to the rest of the Winslow family. His attempts to help the Winslows often go awry. This puts him at odds with the family patriarch, Carl, who routinely throws Urkel out of his house. He has been shown to take responsibility for his own mistakes and reimburses the Winslows for damage he&#x27;s caused. Steve is close to Harriette Winslow, who is delighted when he comes over, much to Carl&#x27;s chagrin.

Later episodes suggest that Steve&#x27;s attachment to the Winslows stems from his bad relationship with his own family. Urkel often hints that most of his relatives, including his (never seen) parents, despise him and refuse to associate with him. This culminates in the two moving to Russia without him, and Urkel moving in with the Winslows. The show&#x27;s plots reveal that Steve has at least four relatives who care about him. They are Uncle Ernie, Uncle Cecil (who, despite his gambling problems, visits the Urkel home to keep an eye on him), Aunt Oona from Altoona (played by singer Donna Summer), who is like a mother to him, and cousin Myrtle. In the series finale, Steve is non-bothered when he tells Laura that his parents won&#x27;t be able to attend their wedding because their favorite episode of The Mod Squad will be airing in Russia, and later responds to Carl talking about how proud he is of his future son-in-law by saying &quot;Thanks, Dad.&quot;

Urkel dresses unfashionably and is most commonly seen wearing suspenders, brightly colored shirts, and high-water pants. His hobbies include polka dancing and accordion playing. His motor vehicle of choice is a tiny European microcar, an Isetta. Unlike his friends, he is not interested in popular culture or sports, though he enjoys playing basketball and attempts to join the school team. This causes Myra to be attracted to Urkel but he shows little interest in her, mainly due to her stalker behavior.

While he is unpopular with his schoolmates, Urkel is a brilliant student and is on a first-name basis with his teachers. He is a genius inventor, and his fantastical but unreliable gadgets (including a transformation device and a time machine) are central to many &quot;Family Matters&quot; plots and gags, especially during later seasons.

Urkel sometimes breaks the law as a result of peer pressure. He is depicted learning the consequences when finding himself in situations outside of his control.

=== Stefan Urquelle ===

During the season five episode &quot;Dr. Urkel and Mr. Cool&quot;, Urkel devises a plan to win Laura&#x27;s heart. In a spoof of the original &quot;Nutty Professor&quot; film, he transforms his DNA using a serum, suppressing his &quot;nerd genes&quot; and bringing out his &quot;cool genes&quot;. This creates the alter ego Stefan Urquelle, also played by Jaleel White in more stylish attire. Initially, Laura is enamored with the smoother Stefan, but she asks that he turn back into Steve when Stefan&#x27;s self-centeredness becomes apparent.

Steve improves the formula in the season five episode &quot;Stefan Returns&quot;. He reduces its negative effects on his personality and invents a &quot;transformation chamber&quot;, allowing him to become Stefan at will. He changes into Stefan several times – even while dating Myra – but circumstances force Steve to turn into his normal self again. With his narcissistic tendencies toned down, Laura falls deeply in love with Steve&#x27;s alter-ego. A major factor in creating and extensively utilizing Stefan was the simple fact that doing the distinctive voice of Steve Urkel was starting to cause damage to Jaleel White&#x27;s throat, so having him play a character who could speak in a normal voice gave him time to recover (White could still sound like Steve, but with less weight on that he was able to avoid any long-term issues). 

In the seventh-season finale &quot;Send in the Clones&quot;, Steve creates a cloning machine and winds up creating a perfect duplicate of himself. Myra is initially excited, but eventually realizes that two Steves are too much. Laura proposes that one of the Steves be permanently turned into Stefan, so that she and Myra can both be with the one they love. Stefan becomes a recurring character and eventually proposes to Laura in the ninth season. After weighing her choices in the episode &quot;Pop Goes the Question&quot;, Laura chooses Steve over Stefan. Stefan leaves and does not appear again.

== Cultural impact ==
In 2010, Westside Middle School in Memphis, Tennessee, outlined its dress code policy on sagging pants, asking students to pull them up or get &quot;Urkeled&quot;. Teachers would forcibly pull students&#x27; pants up and attach them to their waist using zip ties. Students would also have their photo taken and posted on a board in the hallway so that it would be visible to all their classmates. In an interview with NBC affiliate WMC-TV, Principal Bobby White stated that the general idea is to fight pop culture with pop culture. One teacher at the school claimed to have &quot;Urkeled&quot; up to 80 students per week, although after five weeks, the number dropped to 18.

=== Ratings effect ===
In syndication, Steve is incorporated into the teaser scene of &quot;Rachel&#x27;s First Date&quot;. His first appearance in the original broadcasts is in the 1989 episode &quot;Laura&#x27;s First Date&quot;. In the episode, Carl and Eddie separately set up dates for Laura for a dance or party. The first thing known about Steve is that he allegedly ate a mouse. He later makes reference to a mouse when speaking to Carl, implying that it might be true. Prior to Steve Urkel&#x27;s introduction, the show was at risk of cancellation due to mediocre ratings. After Urkel was introduced, several scripts had to be hastily rewritten to accommodate the character, while several first-season episodes that had been completed had new opening gag sequences filmed featuring Steve trying to push open the Winslows&#x27; front door while the family holds it shut. The addition of Steve immediately helped the show boost its modest ratings. White was credited as a guest star in the first season and became a regular member of the cast in season two. In the opening credits for seasons five to nine, White was the only regular whose character&#x27;s name appeared alongside his own during the opening credits. Season nine did not have the same credit sequence showing all the actors, it simply listed their names across the bottom of the screen, but White was listed &quot;as Steve Urkel&quot; there as well.

Jo Marie Payton, who played Harriette Winslow, admitted that she felt the Urkel character hogged much of the show&#x27;s attention and disrupted the close family relationship she had formed with the rest of the cast. Payton took particular umbrage when Jaimee Foxworth, who played youngest sibling Judy Winslow, was dismissed to make more room for Urkel plotlines. Payton felt particularly close to Foxworth, who was the baby of the cast. Payton experienced increasing burnout over the course of the show because the production staff gave White free rein to misbehave. She felt that the focus on Urkel had made the show jump the shark. She almost quit when the show moved to CBS but agreed to stay for the first several episodes until the role of Harriette was recast. Payton was replaced by Judyann Elder. In an interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, Payton recalled an instance in which White insisted upon inserting something that would have violated Broadcast Standards and Practices, to the point that he and Payton nearly came to physical blows with each other. White is one of the few living members of the cast with whom Payton no longer speaks regularly. Still, she speaks well of her experiences, appreciating Urkel&#x27;s impact on the show&#x27;s popularity and the resulting residuals. Reginald VelJohnson, in a 2022 interview with &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, acknowledged that White could be difficult to work with. He attributed the difficulties to White&#x27;s young age and being surrounded by other teenagers, which VelJohnson (who himself never had children) found overwhelming. On the whole, VelJohnson had &quot;nothing but good memories&quot; of working with White.

=== The Urkel Dance ===
The Urkel Dance was a novelty dance that originated in the season two episode, &quot;Life of the Party&quot;. It incorporated Urkel&#x27;s hitched-up pants and nasal voice. The dance was popular enough to appear on another show, &quot;Step by Step&quot;, when the Steve Urkel character appeared in a crossover in the season one episode, &quot;The Dance&quot;.

Jaleel White also performed the song in character during the 5th Annual American Comedy Awards. Bea Arthur (from &quot;Maude&quot; &amp; &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;) joined him on stage to &quot;Do The Urkel&quot;, after which she said, &quot;Hey, MC Hammer, try and touch that!&quot;

A promotional cassette single of the song that accompanies the dance was produced and distributed in limited numbers. A T-shirt was also produced featuring lyrics and Urkel&#x27;s likeness.

Rick Sanchez pays homage to The Urkel Dance with &quot;The Rick Dance&quot; in the &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; episode &quot;Ricksy Business&quot;.

=== Appearances on other shows === 
* &quot;Full House&quot; – In the 1991 episode, &quot;Stephanie Gets Framed&quot;, Steve is called in to help Stephanie Tanner (Jodie Sweetin) deal with her anxieties after she has to get glasses. He was cousin to a friend of D.J. He also jams with Uncle Jesse and gives Michelle a penny for her piggy bank, telling her that &quot;with prevailing interest rates, that penny will be worth three cents by the turn of the century&quot;. Incidentally, &quot;Family Matters&quot; did not air on the night of the episode&#x27;s original airdate (January 25, 1991). It is implied that he found himself in San Francisco in the &quot;Full House&quot; universe before paying a visit to the Lambert household from &quot;Step by Step&quot;.
* &quot;Step by Step&quot; – In the series&#x27; second episode, &quot;The Dance&quot;, Steve lands in the Lambert-Foster family&#x27;s backyard after launching himself with a rocket pack from the living room of the Winslows&#x27; house in the &quot;Family Matters&quot; episode &quot;Brain Over Brawn&quot;. The two scenes were shown in uninterrupted sequence, as &quot;Family Matters&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot; aired back to back on ABC&#x27;s TGIF lineup. Urkel then helps his science-fair pen pal, Mark Foster (Christopher Castile), and lifts Alicia &quot;Al&quot; Lambert (Christine Lakin)&#x27;s spirits after her potential date dumps her just before a school dance. White reprises his &quot;Do the Urkel&quot; dance in the scene where Al gives the boy that dumped her his comeuppance. White also makes a brief two-second cameo as Steve in the 1997 episode &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, snapping a clapperboard on the set of the movie that Al was cast in over her two sisters.
* In the &quot;Family Matters&quot; episode &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, Steve sends a chain letter to his friend Cory Matthews, who lived in Philadelphia. The reference is to Ben Savage&#x27;s character from &quot;Boy Meets World,&quot; but there were no on-screen crossovers. In an episode of &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, Cory says he receives a chain letter from his friend Steve. (In the sequel series &quot;Girl Meets World&quot;, though Urkel never appears, an unnamed Carl Winslow-like police officer, portrayed by VelJohnson, does.)
* &quot;Fuller House&quot; - In the Season 3 finale, Urkel was mentioned by D.J.. In a January 2018 interview with TVLine&#x27;s Andy Swift, series creator and former show runner Jeff Franklin mentioned that they have talked about White reprising the role and that they had some ideas for the character if White decides to reprise the role (Franklin was dismissed from the show before this materialized, and Urkel never appeared in the series).
* &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot; - White reprised his role on the animated series &quot;Scooby-Doo and Guess Who?&quot; in the episode &quot;When Urkel-Bots Go Bad!&quot;
* &quot;Urkel Saves Santa: The Movie&quot; - White reprised his role in an original animated Christmas movie
* Urkel would play a lead role in a sketch mocking the increasingly ridiculous plots of the later seasons of &quot;Family Matters&quot; in the series &quot;Key &amp; Peele&quot; (specifically in the season 4 episode &quot;Slap-Ass: In Recovery&quot;); in the sketch, Reginald VelJohnson and an ABC executive named only &quot;Gene&quot; are seen having an intense argument off-set over the outlandish plots and the obsessive reliance on Urkel; it is suddenly interrupted when Gene stopped mid-sentence, declared he was &quot;nothing&quot;, then pulled out and loaded a handgun, further declared &quot;the king is dead... long live the king&quot;, and shot himself in the head. Urkel, portrayed by Tyler James Williams, is then revealed to have &quot;forced&quot; Gene to shoot himself using telekinetic powers, and despite VelJohnson attempting to defend himself with Gene&#x27;s gun (which fails as Gene had only loaded one bullet), uses such powers to force VelJohnson to point the gun at himself, only stopping him when he agrees to not complain and simply perform the sketches.

=== Merchandise ===
At the height of his popularity in 1991, several Urkel-branded products were released. They included a short-lived fruit-flavored cereal, Urkel-Os, and a Steve Urkel pull-string doll. A T-shirt line was created in 2002 but was discontinued shortly after its inception.

In 2021, White launched his own cannabis brand featuring a strain called &quot;Purple Urkel&quot;. He reprised the Urkel role in a promotional skit with Snoop Dogg.

== Reception ==
In 1999, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked Urkel #27 on its list of the &quot;50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time&quot;. In 2004, he was listed at #98 in Bravo&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest TV Characters&quot;.

<doc id="340775" wikidata="Q5931175" url="?curid=340775" title="Hugh Hoyles">
<text>Sir Hugh Hoyles (October 17, 1814 – February 1, 1888) was a politician and lawyer who served as the third premier of the colony of Newfoundland. Hoyles was the first premier of Newfoundland to have been born in the colony, and served from 1861 to 1865. Born in St. John&#x27;s, he was the son of Newman Hoyles, the first leader of the Tory Party.

Educated in Nova Scotia Hoyles trained as a lawyer and returned to St John&#x27;s in 1842, quickly establishing a large and lucrative legal practice. He was eminent in the Natives&#x27; Society and the Newfoundland Church Society.

Hoyles was elected to the Assembly in 1848. He rapidly became the Conservative leader, opposing responsible government, on the grounds that the colony was not ready for it, and throwing his weight behind Bishop Feild&#x27;s campaign to divide the Protestant educational grant and put Anglicans on the same footing as Catholics. This proposal alienated Methodists who thereupon voted for the Catholic Liberal Party so that, in the 1855 election, the first after responsible government, Hoyles found himself leader of the Opposition. Even though he dropped his support for Feild, and adopted a more pan-Protestant stance, he still unsuccessful in the election of 1859.

In 1861, his chance came when he was hired as a lawyer by senior judges to fight Premier John Kent&#x27;s plans to reduce their salaries. When Kent accused the judges, the governor and the Conservatives of conspiracy the Governor fired Kent and appointed Hoyles as the new Premier. Hoyles&#x27; government was defeated in the legislature and had to fight an election in a highly charged sectarian atmosphere which resulted in riots and loss of life, requiring troops to be sent in, when the Conservatives narrowly won the election.

During his term as premier, he tried to cool sectarian tensions between Catholics and Protestants by inviting Catholics to join his administration and distributing all patronage fairly between religious groups. He sent delegates to the Canadian Confederation Conference at Quebec in 1864. Newfoundland had not been invited to Charlottetown. Those delegates, Ambrose Shea for the opposition, and Frederick Carter, for the government, did not have the power to negotiate.

Hoyles decided to leave office in 1865, before the crucial 1869 election which decided the fate of Confederation with Canada. He was succeeded by Sir Frederick Carter. Hoyles was appointed Chief Justice of Newfoundland, a post which he filled with great distinction. He retired to Halifax in 1880 to live with his married daughter. He died on February 1, 1888. D.W. Prowse, the nineteenth century Newfoundland historian, comments that &quot;we are all proud of Sir Hugh as the most distinguished Newfoundlander of our day&quot;.

==Family==

Hoyles married Jean Liddell (1813–1886), daughter of John Liddell, in 1842. The couple had four children. Hoyles&#x27; wife, Jean, died on January 17, 1886, and was buried at Halifax, Nova Scotia. Their son, N. W. Hoyles, Esquire, K.C., lived in Toronto, Ontario.

<text>Sean Leslie Flynn (May 31, 1941 – disappeared April 6, 1970; declared legally dead in 1984) was an American actor and freelance photojournalist best known for his coverage of the Vietnam War.

Flynn was the only child of Australian-American actor Errol Flynn and his first wife, French-American actress Lili Damita. After studying briefly at Duke University, he embarked on an acting career. He retired by the mid-1960s to become a freelance photojournalist under contract to &quot;Time&quot; magazine.

In search of exceptional images, Flynn traveled with U.S. Army Special Forces units and irregulars operating in remote areas. While on assignment in Cambodia in April 1970, Flynn and fellow photojournalist Dana Stone were captured by communist guerrillas. Neither man was seen or heard from again. In 1984, Flynn&#x27;s mother had him declared dead &quot;in absentia&quot;.

== Early life ==
Flynn was born in Los Angeles to Australian-American actor Errol Flynn and French-American singer and actress Lili Damita. His paternal grandfather Theodore Thomson Flynn was the first professor of biology in Tasmania and served as a marine biology and zoology professor at both the University of Tasmania and at Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast where he served as the Chair of Zoology. Flynn&#x27;s parents separated when he was young, and he was raised by his mother. Flynn graduated from the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, in 1960. When his father died, he left his son $5,000 to help with his college education. Flynn enrolled at Duke University but later left to pursue an acting career.

== Entertainment career ==
Sean Flynn first appeared in front of the cameras at the age of fifteen, when he appeared in an episode of his father&#x27;s television show, &quot;The Errol Flynn Theatre&quot;. The episode, &quot;Strange Auction,&quot; was broadcast in the U.K. in 1956 and in the U.S. in 1957.

Over a summer break in June 1960, Flynn visited his mother in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. At the suggestion of his friend, actor George Hamilton, Flynn filmed a scene in Hamilton&#x27;s picture &quot;Where the Boys Are&quot;, which was shooting in Fort Lauderdale at the time. Most of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor, but he can still be seen in a scene walking past wearing a blue &quot;Xavier University&quot; sweatshirt.

In May 1961, at the age of 20, Flynn accepted a contract with Sage Western Pictures to appear in 1962&#x27;s &quot;Il Figlio del Capitano Blood&quot;, a sequel to his father&#x27;s hit film &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. He was paid $110 a week for the testing period, going up to $10,000 for twelve weeks&#x27; work in the film. As Flynn was still legally a minor he needed his mother&#x27;s permission, which was granted. The test was successful. The film was released in the U.S. in 1964 as &quot;The Son of Captain Blood&quot;.

In September 1961 it was announced Flynn had signed a recording contract for a company known as Hi-Fidelity R.V. Records, and had already recorded four songs for them. Two came out: &quot;Secret Love&quot; b/w &quot;Stay in My Heart&quot;. The songs were released as a 45rpm single (Arvee A 5043, 1961, and HiFi Records R. 9003, 1962).

In 1962, Hamilton announced that he wanted to make &quot;The Brothers&quot;, based on a story by Hamilton, starring himself, Flynn, and Terry Thomas, but the film was never made. Around this time Flynn&#x27;s fiancé was Julie Payne, daughter of actors John Payne and Anne Shirley. A few years later he was engaged to Alessandra Panao.

Flynn made a few more films in Europe, including &quot;Il segno di Zorro&quot; (1963; released in 1964 as &quot;Duel at the Rio Grande&quot;), &quot;Verspätung in Marienborn&quot; with José Ferrer (1963; released in 1964 as &quot;Stop Train 349&quot;), &quot;Agent Special a Venise &quot;Voir Venise et...Crever&quot;&quot; (1964; sold to U.S. television syndication as &quot;Mission to Venice&quot;), and &quot;Sandok, Il Maciste della Jungla&quot; (1964; released in 1966 as &quot;Temple of the White Elephant&quot;).

Flynn became bored with acting, and he went to Africa in late 1964 to try his hand at being a guide for safaris and big-game hunting. He also spent time as a game warden in Kenya. In the latter part of 1965, Flynn needed money, so he made two Spaghetti Westerns in Spain and Italy that were released in 1966: &quot;Sette Magnifiche Pistole&quot; (&quot;Seven Guns for Timothy&quot;) and &quot;Dos Pistolas Gemelas&quot; (&quot;Sharp-Shooting Twin Sisters&quot;) co-starring the Spanish twin performers Pili and Mili. In the summer of 1966, Flynn went to Singapore to star in his eighth and final film, the French–Italian action film &quot;Cinq Gars Pour Singapour&quot; (1967; released in 1968 as &quot;Five Ashore in Singapore&quot;).

== Photojournalism career ==
=== Vietnam ===
Flynn arrived in South Vietnam in January 1966 as a freelance photojournalist, first for the French magazine &quot;Paris Match&quot;, then for Time Life, and finally for United Press International (UPI). Flynn&#x27;s photos were soon published around the world. He made a name for himself as one of a group of high-risk photojournalists which included Dana Stone, Tim Page, Henri Huet, John Steinbeck IV, Perry Deane Young, Nik Wheeler, and Chas Gerretsen, who would do anything to get the best pictures, even go into combat. In March 1966, Flynn was wounded in the knee while in the field.

In April 1966, Flynn was on patrol with some Green Berets and Nung mercenaries when they were ambushed by the Viet Cong. Flynn was carrying an M-16 rifle at the time and had to fight his way out along with the other soldiers. &quot;I thought not only me but all of us were greased.&quot; Flynn had been given the rifle by the Green Berets and been under fire with them before.

In June 1966, Flynn left Vietnam long enough to star in his last movie. Based on the 1959 novel &quot;Cinq Gars Pour Singapour&quot; by Jean Bruce, the film was shot in Paris and Singapore and was tentatively called &quot;OSS 117 Goes to Singapore&quot;, but was released as &quot;Cinq Gars Pour Singapour&quot; (&quot;Five Ashore in Singapore&quot;). He soon returned to Vietnam.

In November 1966, Flynn was credited with saving an Australian platoon from decimation by a mine by identifying the mine while photographing the troops near Vũng Tàu. He made a parachute jump with the 1st Brigade, 101st Airborne Division the following month.

=== Israel ===
In 1967, Flynn went to Jordan to cover the Arab–Israeli war of 1967.

=== Return to Vietnam ===
Flynn returned to Vietnam in 1968, after the Tet Offensive. In September of that year, he was working as a cameraman for CBS News when he was injured slightly by grenade fragments while shooting a battle between U.S. and North Vietnamese forces 85 miles south of Da Nang. Flynn went to Cambodia in early 1970 when news broke of North Vietnamese advances into that country.

== Disappearance ==
On April 6, 1970, Flynn and a group of journalists left Phnom Penh to attend a government-sponsored press conference in Saigon. Flynn (who was freelancing) and fellow photojournalist Dana Stone (who was on assignment for CBS) chose to travel on motorcycles instead of the limousines that the majority of the other journalists were using for traveling. Reporter Steve Bell, who was one of the last Westerners to see the two alive, later said that after the press conference, Flynn and Stone had received word that there was a makeshift checkpoint on Highway 1 manned by members of the Viet Cong. The checkpoint consisted of a white four-door sedan in which several missing journalists had been traveling, and which was now parked across the roadway. Flynn and Stone observed the checkpoint from some distance and spoke to several journalists already on scene. Surviving film footage captured both this moment as well as the sight of several persons, believed to be Viet Cong, moving around on the far side of the vehicle. Undaunted by the sight of a nearby platoon of government soldiers taking up defensive positions in a line perpendicular to the road, and eager to interview the Viet Cong, both Flynn and Stone chose to proceed alone to the checkpoint. Witnesses later reported that both Flynn and Stone were quickly relieved of their motorcycles and marched into a nearby treeline. Neither was ever seen alive again. Before they left, Bell snapped the last known photo taken of Flynn and Stone.

Four other journalists, two Frenchmen and two Japanese, had been captured by the Viet Cong inside Cambodia on the same day. By June 1970, 25 journalists had been captured in Cambodia in the previous three weeks. Three had been killed, some returned, and others were missing. Flynn and Stone were never seen again and their bodies have never been found. Although it is known that Flynn and Stone were captured by Viet Cong guerrillas at a checkpoint on Highway 1, their fate is unknown. Citing various government sources, it is believed that they were killed by factions of the Khmer Rouge. Flynn&#x27;s mother spent an enormous amount of money searching for her son, to no avail. In 1984 she had Flynn declared legally dead. She died in 1994. In 1991, the remains of two men were found in Cambodia; in 2003, the Pentagon&#x27;s Central Identification Lab in Hawaii confirmed by DNA testing that the remains were of Clyde McKay, a boat hijacker, and Larry Humphrey, an army deserter. In March 2010, a British team searching for Flynn&#x27;s body uncovered the remains of a Western hostage in Cambodia&#x27;s Kampong Cham province, allegedly executed by the Khmer Rouge. Test results on the human remains were released on June 30, 2010, and were found not to be the remains of Flynn. Wayne Perry of the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) said there was no match between DNA from the recovered remains and DNA samples they had on file from the Flynn family.

<doc id="340780" wikidata="Q4155159" url="?curid=340780" title="Daria Morgendorffer">
<text>Daria Morgendorffer is a fictional character and the eponymous main protagonist of the MTV adult animated series &quot;Daria&quot;, which originally aired from March 1997 to January 2002. She was initially designed and created by &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; staff writer David Felton as a supporting character, serving as an intelligent foil to the two main characters. Eventually, MTV sought to make an animated show catered more to female viewers, and thus Glenn Eichler and Susie Lewis Lynn co-developed &quot;Daria&quot;. She was voiced in both productions by Tracy Grandstaff.

In 2002, Daria placed at number 41 on the list of the &quot;Top 50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&quot; by &quot;TV Guide&quot; for her role in the two shows. She was also listed in AOL&#x27;s 100 Most Memorable Female TV Characters.

==Conception and development==
Mike Judge created the Daria character on advice of the network. MTV senior vice president and creative director Abby Terkuhle explained that when &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; &quot;became successful, we... created Daria&#x27;s character because we wanted a smart female who could serve as the foil.&quot; Terkuhle said that he added Daria &quot;to put Beavis and Butt-Head in their place&quot;. Judge says that Daria was named for a girl he knew in school who, like the character, was saddled with the nickname &quot;Diarrhea&quot;. Glenn Eichler, who created the &quot;Daria&quot; spin-off – sometimes incorrectly stated to be the character&#x27;s creator as well – was, along with Peggy Nicoll, one of the main writers of the series; other writers were Neena Beber, Anne D. Bernstein, Rachelle Romberg, Rachel Lipman, and Sam Johnson.

==In &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;==
In Daria&#x27;s first incarnation as a recurring character on &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, she formed an intelligent female foil to the two main characters. She went through three different outfits, had a stockier figure, and initially was a more expressive character; her iconic monotone voice developed over time. While she later became more sardonic, she showed early on that she could hold her own against the two and could react quickly to their antics.

In her debut episode, &quot;Scientific Stuff&quot;, she was forced to do a science class presentation with Beavis and Butt-Head. At first, Daria is horrified by this and voiced out her complaints to Mrs. Dickie against having to work with the pair due to their history of stupidity and lack of common sense. She later turned it to her advantage by using &quot;them&quot; as the presentation&#x27;s experiment. She had a minor role in her next two appearances, in &quot;Babes R Us&quot; and &quot;Sign Here&quot;. In &quot;Sign Here&quot; she answered questions from David Van Driessen on furriers and their treatment of animals. In later appearances, she alternated between being irritated by their antics and finding their stupidity to be amusing: in &quot;Sprout&quot;, she specifically came over to watch them fail at planting seeds, and in &quot;Walkathon&quot; she got them to unwittingly pledge $100 apiece on a charity walkathon. In &quot;Sporting Goods&quot; she gave three eye-popping gasps while Beavis and Butt-Head wear eye patches as athletic supporters, which is a dramatic contrast to her monotonous behavior in the later series. She lacked the passionate hatred for them that Principal McVicker and Coach Buzzcut had and was one of the very few characters that would willingly seek them out, but did not really believe there is any hope for them either, as Van Driessen had. On multiple occasions, she took it upon herself to explain simple concepts to them, such as informing them in &quot;U.S. History&quot; what graduation was (Beavis responded, &quot;You mean, like... school ends?&quot;) and in &quot;Sprout&quot; that you put seeds in the ground.

In a Christmas special, it is stated that Butt-Head had been responsible for giving her a negative outlook on boys. Aside from that, she was one of the few characters that the duo never managed to drive crazy as they had with many other students and teachers. Butt-Head sometimes treated her with some degree of respect, following her advice in &quot;Sprout&quot; and chuckling &quot;Daria&#x27;s &quot;cool!&quot;&quot; after she asked Bill Clinton if &quot;you were just jerking us around&quot; on a campaign promise.

John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; describes Daria as &quot;as sharp as B. &amp; B. are dimwitted&quot;. John Allemang of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; described Daria in &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; &quot;the prematurely wise girl who could be counted on to put their idiocy in perspective.&quot; Beavis and Butt-Head often call her &quot;Diarrhea&quot;.

In the final episode of season 7 (her only appearance in season 7 of Beavis and Butthead; by this time, her own series had been on the air for nearly 9 months), when the boys were believed dead, Daria expressed the sentiments that &quot;I guess it&#x27;s sad they&#x27;re dead&quot;, but they did not have very bright futures to look forward to.

Daria appeared frequently in the Marvel Comics adaptation of the TV show, and also got to appear on the cover of one issue and &quot;answer&quot; the fan mail in two others. In &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot;, she appears once throughout the film with a group of students, but does not have any dialogue.

Daria&#x27;s own show never mentioned Beavis and Butt-Head and named Highland only once at the beginning of the first episode of season one, carried over from the original and unbroadcast pilot. Despite this, it was frequently noted in media articles about the show that it was a spin-off from &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. During a 1998 MTV music video countdown of the &quot;Top 10 Animated Videos&quot;, in which Daria and Jane were the presenters, this was joked at when the Red Hot Chili Peppers&#x27;s cover of &quot;Love Rollercoaster&quot; made for the movie &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do America&quot; clocked in at #2; Jane quips that &quot;This one features two guys from Daria&#x27;s past! Do the names &quot;Beavis&quot; and &quot;Butt-Head&quot; ring a bell?&quot;, to which Daria calls her a &quot;ding-dork&quot; afterwards. In an &quot;interview&quot; on &quot;CBS Early Show&quot; on January 21, 2002, Daria was asked by Jane Clayson if she kept in touch with Beavis and Butt-Head; she responded &quot;I&#x27;d like to, but first they&#x27;d have to figure out that when the telephone makes that funny sound, you&#x27;re supposed to pick it up and say hello&quot;.

As revealed in a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview with Mike Judge, Daria would not return to the new episodes of &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; in 2011, but she was referenced in &quot;Drones&quot; during a music video when Beavis assumed she had committed suicide. However, Butt-Head incredulously tells his friend &quot;What are you talking about, Beavis? Daria didn&#x27;t die, she just moved away&quot;.

Daria made a brief, silent cameo in the 2022 Paramount+ film &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head Do the Universe&quot;, during Beavis and Butt-Head&#x27;s sentencing, upset with the fact that the boys got off scot-free with their crime.

In the 2022–23 season finale episode, &quot;Abduction&quot;, Daria plays &quot;Smart Daria&quot;, one of the judges who sentences Smart Butt-Head and Smart Beavis back to earth to try to complete a mission or face the death sentence.

==In &quot;Daria&quot;==
In the series &quot;Daria&quot;, which followed &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, Daria remains bespectacled and plain. She is an unfashionably dressed, highly intellectual, entirely pessimistic about life altogether, cynical, and sarcastic teenage girl who is portrayed as an icon of sanity in an insane household in an equally insane upper middle class suburb. She resides with her vacuous, fashion-obsessed younger sister Quinn and career-obsessed parents Helen and Jake. Their family name, &quot;Morgendorffer&quot; (lit. &quot;one from Dawn Village&quot;, + + ), indicates that her father&#x27;s family originally hails from Germanic roots. John Allemang of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; said that Daria is &quot;both the disappointment of her overachieving parents and an embarrassment to her boy-crazy sister Quinn&quot;. She had moved to a new school, having transferred from the one in &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;. Glenn Eichler said, in relation to &quot;Daria&quot; the series, of which he was a co-creator, &quot;I like to think that I&#x27;ve helped her come out of her shell.&quot;

David L. Coddon of the &quot;San Diego Union-Tribune&quot; described Daria as &quot;the anti-cheerleader, the un-social climber, the jaundiced eye in a cartoon world of too much makeup and superficial crayon colors&quot;. Coddon added that Daria &quot;may look like a misfit, but the catch is that Daria&#x27;s the only character on the show who &#x27;gets it&#x27;. It&#x27;s everyone else who&#x27;s a misfit.&quot; Daria states in the first episode that she does not have low self-esteem: she has low esteem for everybody else. Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;The secret of Daria&#x27;s popularity (everywhere but in her own home and school) may be our collective alienation.&quot; Gates says &quot;her tastes are a little dark.&quot; As an example, Gates used the fact that she reads &quot;Howl&quot; by Allen Ginsberg at a reading to the elderly program.

Eichler said, &quot;Apparently everyone, with the exception of a very few people who were hit on the head when they were very young, felt like they were outsiders. You either identify with her as an outsider or you sort of envy her ability to navigate her life as an outsider and stay sane.&quot; John J. O&#x27;Connor, a television critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said &quot;In short, Daria is the perfect anti-Barbie Doll. Merchants of fashion and cosmetics are beneath her contempt. Her refusal to be Miss Goody Consumer borders on the truly subversive.&quot; He concludes that Daria &quot;is every glorious misfit I ever knew&quot;.

Allemang said that in &quot;Daria&quot;, Daria &quot;seems more tortured and neurotic, if only because it&#x27;s more clear that the airheads have won&quot;. Daria often talks to herself. Allemang adds &quot;in a perky-teen world with its twisted values, soliloquies are the best hope of intelligent conversation.&quot; In addition he said &quot;There&#x27;s nothing intrinsically wrong with Daria, just because she can&#x27;t or won&#x27;t hang out with the cool kids.&quot; John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that Daria has &quot;a withering eye&quot; towards her classmates. Emily Nussbaum for &quot;Slate&quot; would praise the show both for having a character that many disaffected teenagers could relate to and for showing &quot;the flipside of her principled withdrawal from the world: her crippling terror of rejection, a streak of ugly self-righteousness&quot;.

Daria likes to watch the fictitious television show &quot;Sick, Sad World&quot;. Gates added that &quot;Daria is the kind of girl who reads &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; and Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &#x27;Telltale Heart&#x27; in class.&quot;

===Relationships with other characters===
Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; says &quot;The Morgendorffers don&#x27;t even seem to notice that Daria constantly gives them lip.&quot; In one scene, when Helen, her mother, says, &quot;There&#x27;s no course that can teach you to be a perfect mother,&quot; Daria responds &quot;That&#x27;s obvious.&quot; Gates says that &quot;nobody sends her to her room&quot;. Gates also said that Daria&#x27;s popular, self-absorbed sister Quinn is &quot;the greatest burden on the home front&quot;. Jane Lane, Daria&#x27;s best friend, met her at a self-esteem class. Gates adds that Jane &quot;knows all of Daria&#x27;s peculiarities and still loves her&quot;. Gates said that Daria&#x27;s &quot;silent intense crush&quot; on Jane&#x27;s brother Trent is her &quot;only discernible weakness&quot; and that &quot;the absolute proof that Jane is a good friend is that she knows how Daria feels about Trent and will never, ever tell.&quot; In spite of her early infatuation with Trent, Daria&#x27;s most significant romantic relationship is with Tom Sloane, who entered the show at the end of the third season and rapidly became Jane&#x27;s love interest before beginning a relationship with Daria that continued throughout the rest of the show and caused some friction between Daria and Jane.

===Movies===
The first &quot;Daria&quot; movie, &quot;Is It Fall Yet?&quot;, gave the principal characters time apart from one another in parallel narratives which foreshadowed further changes in their relationships.

By the time of the finale movie &quot;Is It College Yet?&quot;, Daria&#x27;s character has undergone noticeable growth. She chooses to attend Raft College. She graduates from Lawndale High, winning the Dian Fossey Award &quot;for dazzling academic achievements in face of near total misanthropy&quot;, and crowning her acceptance speech with the assertion that &quot;there is no aspect, no facet, no moment of life that can&#x27;t be improved with pizza.&quot;

==Appearance==
Daria has shoulder-length brown hair and wears glasses with round black frames. Her everyday outfit consists of an orange T-shirt underneath a green jacket, a black skirt, and black boots. John Allemang of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; said &quot;to surrender is to be normal, to sacrifice your brain in the rush to be popular and wear uncomfortable shoes that make your legs look hot. Daria, as always, keeps her integrity. She wears sensible shoes, and finds her intellectual reward in not being hot.&quot;

In &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot;, Daria wears square glasses, a black leather jacket, white T-shirt, a red skirt, black leggings and black boots. In the earlier episodes, she is seen wearing a brown jacket, beige skirt, green shirt and brown boots.

==MTV &quot;host&quot;==
During her run on MTV, Daria would narrate or &quot;host&quot; special events and shows, either with a real-life presenter or with Jane. She was part of the Cool Crap Auction in 1999, giving an overview of the goods for auction and talking &quot;live&quot; to the winner of one prize, answering machine messages recorded by her. Daria and Jane also hosted MTV&#x27;s &quot;Top Ten Animated Videos Countdown&quot; and two &quot;Daria Day&quot; marathons of their episodes; the &quot;Countdown&quot; and second marathon segments are included on the 2010 DVD release.

==Cameos==
Daria makes a brief cameo in the &quot;Drawn Together&quot; episode &quot;Lost in Parking Space, Part Two&quot;. She is being tortured in the basement of a Hot Topic along with other cartoon characters. She has a nail being hammered into her eye and says, &quot;This is men&#x27;s fault&quot;, in her infamous monotone and is rather indifferent to the pain. Also, at one point in the MTV animated series &quot;Undergrads&quot;, Gimpy is talking to his friends via webcam when a female hacker hacks into the video stream and edits Gimpy to look like Daria.

In late 2010, following the DVD release, Daria was licensed as a voice for Garmin and TomTom GPS systems; original putdowns and jokes were recorded.
In 2013, CollegeHumor created a parody trailer for a live-action &quot;Daria&quot; film starring Aubrey Plaza.

She appeared in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Bart vs. Itchy &amp; Scratchy&quot;, on a poster of Cartoon Women&#x27;s History.

She made a brief appearance in the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;Peter &amp; Lois&#x27; Wedding&quot;, where a pre-handicapped Joe Swanson tried to flirt with her at the MTV Beach House in a flashback of the 1990s, only to be rejected.

Daria appears in the &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episodes &quot;Kramer vs. Showgirls&quot; and &quot;May Cause Weebles to Fall Down&quot;.

==Reception==
Carol A. Stabile, author of &quot;Prime Time Animation: Television Animation and American Culture&quot;, said that &quot;for the cerebral, writerly types who liked television Daria was the outcast she-hero who dared to say things they were too scared to say in their teenage years.&quot; Van Toffler, then the general manager of MTV, said in 1998 that Daria &quot;has an attitude about parents, school, and siblings that is common to the experiences of our audience. She is a good spokesperson for MTV... intelligent but subversive.&quot; A 1997 &quot;The Nation&quot; article referred to Daria as &quot;a 10th grade Dorothy Parker&quot;. Another critic praising the character said that she is like &quot;a 50-year-old deadpan Jewish comic in the body of a 16-year-old&quot;. Jennifer Vineyard, a writer of &quot;My Life as Liz&quot;, said &quot;Daria made it cool to be a smart chick.&quot; Vineyard added, &quot;Just the presence of people or characters like Daria help make it cool to be yourself. There&#x27;s a tendency for young girls to play dumb. Characters like Daria show you that you don&#x27;t have to.&quot;

Some commentators believed that the character&#x27;s deadpan humor had too much morbidity for the teenage audience. A critic said that Daria uses her &quot;omnivorous deadpan&quot; contempt against other people, represented a variety of &quot;living death&quot;, and was &quot;a grim reaper in a dress&quot; who was more dangerous than Marilyn Manson. Anita Gates of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said &quot;And some people like her just because she says mean things. As far as I can tell, with her show well into its third season [...], Daria has never cracked a smile.&quot;

<text>Pykrete (, ) is a frozen ice composite, originally made of approximately 14% sawdust or some other form of wood pulp (such as paper) and 86% ice by weight (6 to 1 by weight). 

During World War II, Geoffrey Pyke proposed it as a candidate material for a supersized aircraft carrier for the British Royal Navy. Pykrete features unusual properties, including a relatively slow melting rate due to its low thermal conductivity, as well as a vastly improved strength and toughness compared to ordinary ice. These physical properties can make the material comparable to concrete, as long as the material is kept frozen.

Pykrete is slightly more difficult to form than concrete, as it expands during the freezing process. However, it can be repaired and maintained using seawater as a raw material. The mixture can be moulded into any shape and frozen, and it will be tough and durable, as long as it is kept at or below freezing temperature. Resistance to gradual creep or sagging is improved by lowering the temperature further, to .

==History==

===During World War II===
Geoffrey Pyke managed to convince Lord Mountbatten of the potential of his proposal (actually prior to the invention of pykrete) sometime around 1942, and trials were made at two locations in Alberta, Canada. The idea for a ship made of ice impressed the United States and Canada enough that a , 1,000-ton ship was built in one month on Patricia Lake in the Canadian Rockies. However, it was constructed using plain ice (from the lake), before pykrete was proposed. It took slightly more than an entire summer to melt, but plain ice proved to be too weak. Pyke learned from a report by Herman Mark and his assistant that ice made from water mixed with wood fibres formed a strong solid mass—much stronger than pure water ice. Max Perutz later recalled:

Perutz would later learn that Project Habakkuk was the plan to build an enormous aircraft carrier, actually more of a floating island than a ship in the traditional sense. The experiments of Perutz and his collaborators in Smithfield Meat Market in the City of London took place in great secrecy behind a screen of animal carcasses. The tests confirmed that pykrete is much stronger than pure ice and does not shatter, but also that it sags under its own weight at temperatures higher than .

Mountbatten&#x27;s reaction to the breakthrough is recorded by Pyke&#x27;s biographer David Lampe:
Another tale is that at the Quebec Conference of 1943, Mountbatten brought a block of pykrete along to demonstrate its potential to the entourage of admirals and generals who had come along with Winston Churchill and Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mountbatten entered the project meeting with two blocks and placed them on the ground. One was a normal ice block and the other was pykrete. He then drew his service pistol and shot at the first block. It shattered and splintered. Next, he fired at the pykrete to give an idea of the resistance of that kind of ice to projectiles. The bullet ricocheted off the block, grazing the trouser leg of Admiral Ernest King and ending up in the wall. According to Perutz&#x27;s own account, however, the incident of a ricochetting bullet hitting an Admiral actually happened much earlier in London and the gun was fired by someone on the project—not Mountbatten.

Despite these tests, the main Project Habakkuk was never put into action because of limitations in funds and the belief that the tides of the war were beginning to turn in favour of the Allies using more conventional methods.

According to the memoirs of British General Ismay:

===After World War II===
Since World War II, pykrete has remained a scientific curiosity, unexploited by research or construction of any significance. However, new concepts for pykrete crop up occasionally among architects, engineers and futurists, usually regarding its potential for mammoth offshore construction or its improvement by applying super-strong materials such as synthetic composites or Kevlar.

In 1985, pykrete was considered for a quay in Oslo harbour. However, the idea was later shelved, considering pykrete&#x27;s unreliability in the real-world environment. Since pykrete needs to be preserved at or below freezing point, and tends to sag under its own weight at temperatures above , an alternative was considered that would guarantee effectiveness and public safety.

In 2011, the Vienna University of Technology successfully built a pykrete ice dome, measuring in diameter in the Austrian village of Obergurgl. They improved on an original Japanese technique of spraying ice on a balloon by using the natural properties of ice and its strength. This structure managed to stand for three months before sunlight started melting the ice, rendering the structure unreliable. Researcher Johann Kollegger of Vienna University of Technology thinks his team&#x27;s alternative new method is easier, avoiding icy sprayback onto the workers. To build their freestanding structure, Kollegger and his colleagues first cut an plate of ice into 16 segments. To sculpt the segments to have a dome-like curve, the researchers relied on ice&#x27;s creep behavior. If pressure is applied to ice, it slowly changes its shape without breaking. One of the mechanisms by which glaciers move, called glacial creep, functions similarly, the researchers say.

In 2014, the Eindhoven University of Technology worked on a pykrete architecture project in Juuka, Finland, which included an ice dome and a pykrete scale model of the Sagrada Familia. They attempted to build the largest ice dome in the world. Due to human error, the plug to a compressor that kept the balloon inflated was pulled, leading to the balloon deflating. The team of Dutch students quickly re-inflated the balloon, and resprayed the part of the dome that had collapsed. They continued with their construction, and eventually opened the dome to the public. However within a matter of days the roof caved in; there were no visitors on the site at the time.

==Mechanical properties==
The durability of pykrete is still debated. Perutz has estimated a crushing strength value of around .

A September 1943 proposal for making smaller pykrete vessels included the following table of characteristics:&lt;ref name=&quot;ADM 1/15677&quot; &gt;The National Archives, ADM 1/15677 – Proposals and inventions of Mr Geoffrey Pyke; gravity propelled ball bomb, pykrete and power driven rivers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the media==
In 2009, the Discovery Channel program &quot;MythBusters&quot; episode 115 tested the properties of pykrete and the myths behind it. First, the program&#x27;s primary hosts, Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, compared the mechanical properties of common ice, pykrete, and a new material specially created for the show, dubbed &quot;super pykrete&quot;, which used newspapers instead of woodpulp. Both versions of pykrete indeed proved to be much stronger than the chunk of ice, withstanding hundreds of pounds of weight. The super pykrete was much stronger than the original version.

The MythBusters then built a full-size boat out of the super pykrete, naming it &quot;Yesterday&#x27;s News&quot;, and subjected it to real-world conditions. The MythBusters vessel did not contain refrigeration units to keep the pykrete frozen as the original plans called for, and the boat had a much thinner construction than the massive ships proposed in World War II. Though the boat managed to float and stay intact at speeds of up to , it quickly began to spring leaks as the boat slowly melted. After 20 minutes the boat was deteriorating, and the experiment was ended. The boat lasted another 10 minutes while being piloted back to shore. Though the boat worked, it was noted that it would be highly impractical for the original proposal, which claimed that an entire aircraft carrier could be built out of pykrete. Their conclusion was &quot;Plausible, but ludicrous&quot;, since it would involve building vessels out of tens of thousands of tons of the material that would sink without being kept cool.

In the same year, the story of Pyke and pykrete in the Second World War also played an important role in Giles Foden&#x27;s book &quot;Turbulence&quot;, about a (fictitional) British meteorologist and his contributions to D-Day weather forecasting. The main character is also involved in the post-War pykrete effort.

In 2010, the BBC programme &quot;Bang Goes the Theory&quot; episode 26 tested a , 5-tonne pykrete boat made with hemp rather than wood pulp. All four presenters, Jem Stansfield, Dallas Campbell, Liz Bonnin, and Yan Wong, had to be rescued from Portsmouth Harbour after the boat took on water through the engine mounts. It eventually capsized after melting much faster than anticipated in the warmer-than-expected September waters.

2013 German TV station WDR&#x27;s programme &quot;&quot; experimented with pykrete but replaced the woodpulp by hemp-fibres. A 5 cm (2.1 inch)-thick plate withstood even more than 80 kg without breaking, it only started to bend.

Neal Stephenson&#x27;s 2015 novel &quot;Seveneves&quot; describes the fictional use of pykrete to construct low Earth orbit habitats and spaceship hulls.

&quot;99% Invisible&#x27;s&quot; third volume of mini-stories podcasts includes an article about Project Habbakuk and the creation, proposal, and eventual scrapping of pykrete as a useful building material during WWII.

&quot;Science &amp; Futurism with Isaac Arthur&quot; Youtube episode &quot;Colonizing Ceres&quot; describes the fictional use of pykrete to construct a dome habitat on an asteroid to be mined.

<text>Peter Warren Finlay (born in 1961), also known as DBC Pierre, is an Australian author who wrote the novel &quot;Vernon God Little&quot;.

Pierre was born in South Australia, and largely raised in Mexico. He has resided in the Republic of Ireland and now, according to an August 2020 interview in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, lives in Cambridgeshire.

Pierre was awarded the 2003 Man Booker Prize for &quot;Vernon God Little&quot;, his first novel, becoming the third Australian-born author to be so honoured. Upon winning the Whitbread First Novel Award in 2003 he became the first writer to receive a Man Booker and a Whitbread for the same book. The book also won the Bollinger Wodehouse Everyman Prize for comic literature at the Hay Festival in 2003, and earned the author a James Joyce Award from the Literary and Historical Society of University College Dublin.

== Early life ==
Born in Old Reynella, South Australia, where his father was lecturing in genetics at the University of Adelaide, Pierre had, by the age of two, already spent time in the United States, the South Pacific and Great Britain. He was then raised from early childhood into his 20s in Mexico City&#x27;s community of Jardines del Pedregal, and attended Edron Academy.

Pierre was taken to revisit his home by Alan Yentob for the BBC television series &quot;Imagine&quot; in 2004.

He recalls, in a &quot;Guardian&quot; article of 1 September 2004, that he would later return to Durham most years, usually around the second week in July, to see the Durham Miners Gala. Aged seven, he fell ill with hepatitis and had to spend a year in bed. After he recovered, his parents were faced with the choice of keeping him a year behind in school, or letting him stay in his class and just catch up. They chose the latter. Pierre sees this as the moment &quot;when all the trouble began... &quot; as it meant his falling out with his peers.

His father, once decorated as a Lancaster Bomber pilot in World War II, by then a scientific partner to Nobel Peace Prize winner Norman E. Borlaug, fell ill when Pierre was sixteen, and died three years later.

==Middle years==
Pierre&#x27;s permanent residency in Mexico ended at Reynosa on the United States-Mexican border in the middle of the night when he claims he was stopped trying to import a 6-litre sports car. He claims he intended to drive through the Sonoran Desert to Mexico City, but Mexico at the time had a protectionist auto industry, making foreign vehicle imports illegal to all but tourists. Pierre succeeded in crossing with the car but found his papers cancelled by the time he reached Mexico City some 18 hours later. The border crossing at Reynosa is described in Pierre&#x27;s novel Vernon God Little, as is the journey by road from the border.

Pierre asserts that, of the following years, nine were spent in a drug-induced haze, culminating with a stay in Australia where he finally collapsed. He described this period of his life in an interview given on the Australian television show &quot;Enough Rope&quot; with Andrew Denton in 2006: 

During his twenties, he had been involved in a film production to explore the fall of the Aztec Empire and follow trails to the remains of Aztec Emperor Moctezuma, and possibly to his lost treasure, the whereabouts of which remains one of Mexico&#x27;s great mysteries.

During the 1990s, he wrote his first novel whilst living in Balham, south London, finally agreeing a publication deal with Faber &amp; Faber on 11 September 2001. In the following weeks, he relocated to County Leitrim, Ireland, where he began work on a second novel. The Man Booker Prize comes with a monetary award of £50,000. Upon being notified of his victory, Pierre said that the money would go part way toward paying off the debts incurred in his 20s when psychological issues and drug abuse were driving forces. The letters in his pen name stand for &quot;Dirty but clean&quot; in reference to his former hardships.

==Recent years==
In 2005 DBC Pierre revisited the Mexico of his youth to finally explore and document the downfall of the Aztecs. In this revealing Channel 4 documentary he revisits the Aztecs&#x27; epic tale of decline and conquest. &quot;The Last Aztec&quot;, part historical film and part road movie, was aired in 2006 and follows Pierre as he traces the advance of the Spanish conquistadors toward the Aztec capital. It also picks up the threads he had intended to pursue in his ill-fated production of years earlier, centring on the wizards and witches of an Otomi culture in a remote valley in the Sierra Madre mountains of central Mexico.

In 2007 his first novel, &quot;Vernon God Little&quot;, was adapted by Tanya Ronder for the London stage. It was directed by Rufus Norris at the Young Vic from 27 April – 9 June. To date, the work has been translated in more than 40 countries worldwide and produced as a play by at least four theatre companies.

In 2009, he donated the short story &quot;Suddenly Dr Cox&quot; to Oxfam&#x27;s Ox-Tales project, four collections of UK stories written by 38 authors. Pierre&#x27;s story was published in the &quot;Air&quot; collection. He is also a contributor to the 2009 rock biography on The Triffids &quot;Vagabond Holes: David McComb and the Triffids&quot;, edited by Australian academics Niall Lucy and Chris Coughran.

<text>The University of Illinois Chicago (UIC) is a public research university in Chicago, Illinois, United States. Its campus is in the Near West Side community area, adjacent to the Chicago Loop. The second campus established under the University of Illinois system, UIC is also the largest university in the Chicago metropolitan area, having more than 33,000 students enrolled in 16 colleges. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity.&quot;

UIC competes in NCAA Division I Missouri Valley Conference.

==History==
===Beginnings===
The University of Illinois Chicago traces its origins to several health colleges founded during the late 19th century, including the Chicago College of Pharmacy, which opened in 1859, the College of Physicians and Surgeons (1882), and the Columbian College of Dentistry (1893).

The University of Illinois was chartered in 1867 in Champaign-Urbana, as the state&#x27;s land-grant university. In exchange for agreeing to the Champaign-Urbana location, Chicago-area legislators were promised that a &quot;polytechnical&quot; branch would open in Chicago. The Chicago-based health colleges affiliated with the university in 1896–97, becoming fully incorporated into the University of Illinois in 1913, as the Colleges of Medicine, Dentistry, and Pharmacy on Chicago&#x27;s west side. Medical education and research expanded in the succeeding decades, leading to the development of several other health science colleges, which were brought together as the University of Illinois Chicago Professional Colleges. In 1936, the first act of newly elected state representative Richard J. Daley was to introduce a resolution calling for the establishment of an undergraduate Chicago campus of the University of Illinois.

===Navy Pier campus===
As World War II was drawing to a close, Congress passed the G.I. Bill in 1944, which sought to reward veterans for their military service. Among other benefits, it provided educational funding, making college degrees far more attainable to a much-wider selection of the American public. In 1945, Daley, who was then a state senator, introduced four bills calling for a university in Chicago. In 1946, realizing that they would be &quot;besieged with applications,&quot; University of Illinois officials opened what was to be a temporary branch campus called the Chicago Undergraduate Division (CUD) on Navy Pier. The campus was not a junior college, but rather had a curriculum based on Urbana&#x27;s courses, and students who successfully completed the first two years&#x27; requirements could go on to Urbana and finish their degree.

Classes at the CUD campus began in October 1946, and approximately 4,000 students enrolled each semester. Nicknamed &quot;Harvard on the rocks,&quot; three-quarters of its students were veterans on the G.I. Bill, many of whom were immigrants and most of whom worked other part-time jobs to support themselves. It also accommodated first-generation college students from working families who commuted from home. (Navy Pier makes an appearance in Robert Pirsig&#x27;s &quot;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&quot;; its protagonist taught freshman English there.)

Due to high demand for a public university education in Chicago, the university made plans to create a permanent degree-granting campus in Chicago. Students at CUD generally needed to transfer after two years to a more expensive private college in Chicago, or go to the main campus in Champaign–Urbana, where there were fewer opportunities for work, while at the same time as going to school.

===Congress Circle campus===
Daley succeeded in getting the state senate in 1951 to pass a bill calling for a Chicago campus. Daley then became mayor of Chicago in 1955 and pressed the University of Illinois to upgrade the Chicago Undergraduate Center to a full-fledged four-year institution. After a long and controversial site decision process, in 1961, Mayor Daley offered the Harrison and Halsted Streets site for the new campus. In December 1961, the final decision to establish a four-year university in Chicago was made. In that same year, the Chicago Professional Colleges became the University of Illinois at the Medical Center (UIMC).

Florence Scala led the fight against Mayor Richard J. Daley&#x27;s plan to demolish her Italian-American neighborhood to construct the campus. In 1963, the trustees of Hull House accepted an offer of $875,000 for the settlement building. Jessie Binford and Scala took the case to the Supreme Court. Scala led marches to protest the construction. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal and the settlement was closed on March 28, 1963. During the construction of the 100-acre (0.40 km2) UIC campus, 200 businesses and 800 homes were bulldozed in Little Italy, with 5,000 residents displaced.

In 1963, construction began on the university&#x27;s new Chicago campus at Harrison and Halsted Streets south of the Greektown neighborhood. In February 1965, the new Chicago campus opened and was named the University of Illinois at Congress Circle (UICC) referencing the nearby Circle Interchange of I-290 and I-90/I-94). Shortly before opening, the Congress Expressway was renamed the Eisenhower Expressway and the campus was renamed to University of Illinois at Chicago Circle (UICC). UICC was designed in the brutalist style by Walter Netsch of Skidmore, Owings and Merrill, a Chicago-based architectural firm responsible for many of today&#x27;s tallest skyscrapers. Unlike the CUD campus, Circle was a degree-granting institution. Within five years of the campus&#x27; opening, in addition to undergraduate degrees, virtually every department offered graduate degrees.

===Consolidation===
In September 1982, the University of Illinois system consolidated UICC and UIMC to form the &quot;University of Illinois at Chicago&quot; (UIC), later dropping the &quot;at&quot; to become University of Illinois Chicago. In 2000, UIC began developing the south campus. The expansion of UIC south of Roosevelt Road increased on-campus living space and research facilities.

In 2019, the John Marshall Law School, founded in 1899, became affiliated with the university. In 2021, the UI Trustees voted to officially rename UIC John Marshall Law School as UIC School of Law, citing John Marshall&#x27;s &quot;role as a slave trader, slave owner of hundreds of slaves, pro-slavery jurisprudence, and racist views.&quot;

==Campus==
UIC is Chicago&#x27;s largest university with more than 33,000 students, 12,000 employees, 16 colleges and the state&#x27;s major public medical center. The East Campus was designed in the brutalist style by Walter Netsch. The plan included second-story walkways that connected all of the buildings. Some of the later buildings in Netsch&#x27;s design were not rectilinear (the Behavioral Sciences Building) and even irregularly shaped (Science and Engineering South, and the never-completed Art &amp; Architecture building). These demonstrated his idea of &quot;field theory&quot;: designs which used squares and rotations of squares superimposed on one another. While the buildings are largely intact, the walkways were taken down in phases during the early 1990s to make the campus more welcoming. Considerable effort has been expended to modify the original Netsch campus plan to create the feel of a traditional college campus. For example, the area in front of the main administration building, University Hall, has been the site of several renovations in the last decade; and, Credit Union 1 Arena (formerly the UIC Pavilion, a sports arena) was added in 1982.

The East Campus is located on the Near West Side, just south of Greektown and a 15-minute walk from downtown Chicago. The juxtaposition of campus and commercial density was a direct result of large-scale urban renewal led by Mayor Richard J. Daley.

The West Campus, also on the Near West Side, is much older and includes some buildings built in the collegiate gothic style. The colleges of Medicine, Pharmacy, Nursing, Dentistry, Applied Health Sciences and Public Health, as well as the Library of the Health Sciences are all located on the West Campus. The West Campus is in the heart of the Illinois Medical District where the University of Illinois Medical Center is located.
The Chicago Transit Authority&#x27;s Blue Line, part of the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27;, runs through the median of the Eisenhower Expressway along the north side of the campus. Three Blue Line stations are close to the university: UIC-Halsted, Racine, and Illinois Medical District. The Pink Line serves UIC&#x27;s west campus on Polk Street and runs directly to the Loop.

===Campus housing===
UIC offers ten residence halls for its students. The East Campus contains five residence halls, the South Campus contains three, and the West Campus contains two. Until the South Campus expansion, UIC students were still predominantly commuters. However, the administration has worked to change the campus to one where most students are residential. Nearly 6,000 students live within one-and-a-half miles of campus. 3,800 students, including over half of all freshmen, live in UIC&#x27;s nine residence halls. There are also thousands of apartments within walking distance to classes.

On the East Campus, Commons West and Commons South are traditional halls with double rooms opening into a common hallway; each floor shares a common bathroom. Courtyard and Commons North are cluster-style buildings with rooms grouped to share a small private bathroom. These four buildings are connected to the Student Center East which houses a cafeteria, the campus bookstore, a convenience store, bowling/billiards, a barber shop, and the Inner Circle (an assortment of fast food restaurants).

West Campus housing is composed of the Single Student Residence (SSR, apartments for graduate students) and Polk Street Residence (cluster style rooms). South Campus is home to Marie Robinson Hall and Thomas Beckham Hall, both apartment style buildings. In the fall of 2007, James Stukel Towers opened containing suite style rooms with a bathroom and living room. In keeping with UIC culture, students often refer to residence halls by abbreviations instead of their full names (e.g. &quot;TBH&quot; instead of &quot;Thomas Beckham Hall&quot;).

The main purpose of the SSR is to house graduate students, undergraduate students of the ages 24 and older, and professional students. The third and fourth floors house undergraduate students of the ages of 21 through 23. The nursing house is located on the 16th floor. The fifth floor of the SSR has a pilot program for students with families. The program can house up to 15 families. Residents of the family program are zoned to Chicago Public Schools. Families living in the SSR are assigned to Washington Irving Elementary School and Crane High School.

The brand new Academic and Residential Complex, ARC, was opened in response to the ongoing enrollment increase at the university. The building consists of large lecture halls, smaller discussion section classrooms, meeting rooms, and student housing. The building also has a small gym for student occupants and a Starbucks.

===Student recreation===
The UIC Student Recreation Facility (SRF) is a recreational complex for UIC students. Opened in spring 2006, the SRF features a three-story climbing wall, multipurpose courts for games, and a pool with adjoining lazy river. There is also a recreational facility on the west side of the campus. The Sport and Fitness Center, SFC, comprises a fitness floor, Olympic pool, steam room, multipurpose courts, and racquetball courts and much more. UIC Campus Recreation also oversees the Outdoor Field Complex, OFC, on the south side of campus. This outdoor complex comprises two large multipurpose fields. Campus Recreation hosts a variety of programs that promotes the wellness and well-being of students throughout the academic year. Such events includes RecFest, Destress fest, and many more.

===Medical center and College of Medicine===
The University of Illinois College of Medicine offers a four-year program leading to the MD degree at three different sites in Illinois: Chicago, Peoria, and Rockford. (Urbana-Champaign faculty no longer participate in the University of Illinois College of Medicine, with the establishment of the Carle Illinois College of Medicine, hosted entirely at the flagship campus.) UIC is a major part of the Illinois Medical District (IMD). While IMD&#x27;s billing itself &quot;the nation&#x27;s largest urban medical district&quot; may be up for debate, the district is a major economic force contributing $3.3 billion to the local economy and supporting 50,000 jobs. In popular culture, UIC College of Medicine was the Medical School affiliated with Cook County Hospital in the television series E.R.

===Campus renovations===
After the major $550 million South Campus expansion, the university began renovating existing facilities on campus. This focus is in part due to a constrained state budget: state funds for new buildings are scarce. Since renovation is less costly, this approach is being used to update facilities.

The first such renovations were to three original &quot;pillbox&quot; buildings: Grant Hall, Lincoln Hall, and Douglas Hall. The renovated buildings use solar and geothermal power which required digging fifty wells 500 feet into the ground east of University Hall. The energy savings of 20–25% led to Lincoln Hall and Douglas Hall being certified US LEED Gold. Grant Hall did not apply for LEED certification even though it was the prototype for many of the features found on Lincoln and Douglas Halls. The new fascia are all glass and the buildings contain facilities for faculty and students. There are plans to expand the renovation project to every lecture hall cluster if the pilot program is successful.

Other campus renovations include the roof of the Behavioral Sciences Building and the terrace of the Education, Performing Arts, and Social Work building. A brand new building housing the College of Engineering was opened in 2019 to accommodate the increased enrollment in the college. It features the only high bay structural laboratory in the city of Chicago.

To accommodate the rising enrollment in the computer science department, a new building is being constructed called the Computer Design Research and Learning Center (CDRLC); it is slated to be completed in the fall of 2024, with a budget of $117.8 million.

===Sustainability===
The university&#x27;s Office of Sustainability was founded in January 2008. Current sustainability initiatives include lighting upgrades, building envelope improvements, metering upgrades, and landscape waste composting. Recent work on Grant, Lincoln, and Douglas Halls included upgrading them to use geothermal heat pumps, which efficiently heat and cool the building. The university has approved a Climate Action Plan.

===Regional campuses===
The College of Nursing operates on five other campuses in central and northern Illinois:
* Peoria Campus (The College of Nursing maintains an online campus, whereas the College of Medicine has a physical campus in Peoria.)
* Quad Cities Campus (Moline, Illinois)
** Students who live in Illinois or Iowa pay in-state tuition. 
* Rockford, Illinois (the UIC Health Sciences Campus)
** The UIC Health Sciences Campus in Rockford is shared with UIC&#x27;s colleges of medicine and pharmacy. 
* Springfield, Illinois (at the UIS campus)
* Urbana, Illinois (at the UIUC campus)

==Academics==
The University of Illinois Chicago offers over 90 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 100 master&#x27;s degrees, and 60 doctoral degrees through its 16 colleges, in addition to the university&#x27;s specialized honors college and the omnibus graduate college. UIC offers eleven inter-college programs, some of which are organized as centers.

The university is governed by the chancellor who is supported by seven vice chancellors, one CEO for administrative functions, and fifteen college deans. There is a library dean and three regional deans for colleges of medicine.

UIC merged with the John Marshall Law School in 2019 and formally became the University of Illinois Chicago School of Law. It is the first public law school in the city of Chicago.

One in ten Chicagoans with a college degree is a UIC alumnus. Approximately one in eight Illinois physicians is a graduate of the College of Medicine (the nation&#x27;s largest medical school). One in three Illinois pharmacists is a graduate of the College of Pharmacy. Half of all the dentists in Illinois are graduates of the College of Dentistry.

==Student body==

The student body at UIC consists of more than 30,000 total students, of which nearly 21,000 are undergraduate students. Demographic statistics for the student body were:
The chancellor operates six diversity-related committees on Asian Americans, Blacks, Latinos, LGBT issues, persons with disabilities, and women. The University of Illinois Chicago is a federally designated Hispanic-serving institution (HSI) and Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander-Serving Institution (AANAPISI), and is among the most ethnically diverse universities in the United States.

==Athletics==

The Illinois–Chicago (UIC) athletic teams are called the Flames, a reference to the 1871 Great Chicago Fire. The university is a member of the Division I level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Missouri Valley Conference (MVC) since the 2022–23 academic year. The Flames previously competed in the D-I Horizon League from 1994–95 to 2021–22; in the D-I Mid-Continent Conference (Mid-Con, now currently known as the Summit League since the 2007–08 school year) from 1982–83 to 1993–94; as an NCAA D-I Independent during the 1981–82 school year; and in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1949–50 to about 1980–81.

UIC competes in 18 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, soccer, swimming &amp; diving, tennis and track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor and outdoor) and volleyball.

===Men&#x27;s soccer===
In September 2006, the men&#x27;s soccer team earned its highest ranking in school history when the SoccerTimes.com College Coaches Poll pegged the Flames at No. 6 in the country. In November 2006, UIC defeated Western Illinois 3–0 in the opening round of the NCAA tournament before falling in the second round to Notre Dame 1–0. UIC finished the 2006 season as the nation&#x27;s best defensive squad after allowing a mere eight goals in over 1993 minutes of play during 21 matches for a goals-against average (GAA) of 0.36. The GAA was tops in the nation in 2006 and it also ranked fifth all-time in NCAA history. UIC posted 13 shutouts and never allowed more than a single goal in a match. UIC also allowed just two goals after intermission the entire season. Along with the GAA mark, UIC posted the nation&#x27;s best save percentage with a 0.908 rate.

In 2007, UIC soccer&#x27;s successful season culminated in an Elite-Eight appearance in the NCAA tournament by way of wins over No. 12 St. Louis, Northwestern, and No. 8 Creighton. In a bid for a Final-Four appearance, UIC fell to Massachusetts 2–1. At season&#x27;s end, UIC had a record of 13–6–6 and was named a top 10 team by the National Soccer Coaches Association of America (NSCAA).

===Baseball===
UIC&#x27;s baseball team recorded 30 or more victories in a nine-year stretch from 2001 to 2010, won seven straight Horizon League Championships, and advanced to an NCAA regional four times (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008). UIC baseball has recorded regional wins against No. 1 Long Beach State in 2007 and No. 2 Dallas Baptist University in 2008.

===Gymnastics===
In 1978 and 1979 the UIC men&#x27;s gymnastics team won the school&#x27;s only NCAA team titles at the Division II Championships. Following the 1979 season the men&#x27;s gymnastics program entered Division I competition and finished the season ranked 10th, Nationally. After the successful 1980 season the remainder of the UIC athletic teams ascended to Division I status. The 1996 men&#x27;s gymnastics team finished the season in 9th place, the school&#x27;s highest final ranking among all sports. UIC Men&#x27;s Gymnastics individual Division I All America honorees include: Paul Fina (Rings), Mike Costa (Pommel Horse, twice), Barry McDonald (Parallel Bars), Shannon Welker (Floor Exercise), Neil Faustino (Vault), and Andrew Stover (Horizontal Bar).

<text>Jorge Pullin (; born 1963) is an Argentine-American theoretical physicist known for his work on black hole collisions and quantum gravity. He is the Horace Hearne Chair in theoretical Physics at the Louisiana State University.

==Biography==
Jorge Pullin attended the University of Buenos Aires (electrical engineering) for two years before leaving for Instituto Balseiro in Argentina to finish a M.Sc. in Physics (1986). Then he moved to the University of Córdoba to pursue his Ph.D. which was submitted in 1988 to the Instituto Balseiro; his advisor was Reinaldo J. Gleiser.

He moved to Syracuse University in 1989 and to the University of Utah in 1991 as a postdoc. He joined the faculty of Penn State University in 1993, where he was promoted to associate professor in 1997 and full professor in 2000.
In 2001 he moved to Louisiana State University, where he is the co-director of the Horace Hearne Institute, along with Jonathan Dowling.

Pullin&#x27;s wife Gabriela González is also a gravitational physics researcher; she and Pullin met at a gravitational physics meeting in Córdoba, Argentina. Pullin and González spent six years living apart while Pullin was at Penn State and González held a position at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a situation that was resolved when they both were hired by LSU.

==Awards and honors==
In 1998, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation selected Pullin as a Guggenheim Fellow, and in 2001 he won a Fulbright Fellowship to visit the Universidad de la Republica in Uruguay. In 2001, the American Physical Society honored him with the Edward A. Bouchet Award, recognizing him as &quot;a distinguished minority physicist who has made significant contributions to physics research&quot;. He is a corresponding member of the National Academy of Science of Uruguay, the Mexican Academy of Sciences, the Argentinian National Academy of Sciences, and the Latin American Academy of Sciences, and a Fellow of the American Physical Society, of the Institute of Physics, and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

==Research==
Pullin&#x27;s book (with R. Gambini) &quot;Loops, Knots, Gauge Theories and Quantum Gravity&quot; surveys the state of the art in loop quantum gravity at the time of its publication. Reviewer Jerzy Lewandowski writes &quot;the book should allow people from outside the loopy circles to gain access in the current state of the art. But most of all it allows experts within this wide field to learn more about the original constructions which were invented and applied in quantization of gravity by Gambini and Pullin themselves.&quot; Chris Isham adds that &quot;this is a most valuable addition to the scientific literature&quot;, while Hugo A. Morales-Técotl calls it &quot;useful for an immersion in the subject.&quot;

Pullin&#x27;s most-cited research paper, on nonstandard optics, studies the propagation of light within theories of loop quantum gravity and shows that these theories lead to predictions of behavior different from Maxwell&#x27;s equations for light propagation in classical physics.
Pullin, Gambini, and Bernd Brügman also wrote a series of papers that make an important connection between knot theory and quantum gravity, by showing that the Jones polynomial can be used to solve a quantum form of Einstein&#x27;s equations.

Pullin is also known for a series of papers on the theory and numerical simulation of colliding black holes. Pullin&#x27;s early work on the subject (including his second most cited paper, from 1994) involves the &quot;close approximation&quot; in which a pair of nearby black holes is treated mathematically as a single non-spherical black hole; since joining LSU his work on this area has been based instead on supercomputer simulation.
Another pair of his papers studies a simplified mathematical model of the radiation emitted when a star collapses into a black hole, and shows that it compares favorably to numerical simulations.

==Quantum mechanics==

Pullin, along with R. Gambini, has proposed a new interpretation of quantum mechanics, called the `Montevideo interpretation&#x27;. This name was chosen for its similarity with the more orthodox `Copenhagen interpretation&#x27; and a reference to the city of origin. The Montevideo interpretation is an alternative to the Copenhagen interpretation, both seeking to understand the deepest meaning of quantum mechanics. The need for an interpretation is because the extremely-well-verified equations of quantum mechanics leaves unaddressed various issue concerning the nature of reality, the ultimate accuracy of measurement, hidden variables, and the idea of multiple universes. The issues revolve around the nature of the collapse of the quantum wave function as made by a measurement, with the famous example being understanding of Schroedinger&#x27;s Cat. The Montevideo interpretation adds gravity into the picture, where there must be fundamental limits on the accuracy of any clock, and this introduces a decoherence into all systems, which acts as a measurement. &quot;This interpretation explains the emergence of the classical world via decoherence through the interaction with the environment plus loss of coherence of the quantum theory when studied with real clocks and measuring rods... The combined effect of both losses of coherence implies that all information about quantum coherence in the system plus apparatus plus environment becomes inaccessible. After a while, there is no experimental arrangement that is able to decide if the evolution of the state of the complete quantum system was unitary or suffered a collapse. Whenever such situation of undecidability is reached, the interpretation assumes that an event (measurement) takes place.&quot; The physics of the Montevideo interpretation is all classical quantum mechanics and General Relativity, but the philosophical implications are deep.

<text>Arlington Hall (also called Arlington Hall Station) is a historic building in Arlington, Virginia. Originally it was a girls&#x27; school and later the headquarters of the United States Army&#x27;s Signal Intelligence Service (SIS) cryptography operations during World War II. The site houses the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center and the Army National Guard&#x27;s Herbert R. Temple Jr. Readiness Center. It is located on Arlington Boulevard (U.S. Route 50) between S. Glebe Road (State Route 120) and S. George Mason Drive.

== History ==

Arlington Hall was founded in 1927 as a private post-secondary women&#x27;s educational institution, which by 1941, was on a campus and was called the Arlington Hall Junior College for Women. The school had financial problems in the 1930s and eventually became a non-profit institution in 1940. On June 10, 1942, the U.S. Army took possession of the facility under the War Powers Act for use by its Signals Intelligence Service.

During World War II, Arlington Hall was in many respects similar to Bletchley Park in Buckinghamshire, England (although BP also covered naval codes) and was one of only two primary cryptography operations in Washington (the other was the Naval Communications Annex, which was also housed in a commandeered private girls&#x27; school).

Arlington Hall concentrated its efforts working on the Japanese systems (including PURPLE) while Bletchley Park concentrated on European combatants. Initially work was on Japanese diplomatic codes as Japanese army codes were not solved until April 1943, but in September 1943 with success on the Army codes they were put under Solomon Kullback in a separate branch B-II, with other mainly diplomatic work under Frank Rowlett in B-III (which also had the Bombes and Rapid Analytical Machinery). The third branch B-I translated Japanese decrypts.

The Arlington Hall effort was comparable in influence to other Anglo-American Second World War-era technological efforts, such as the cryptographic work at Bletchley Park, the Naval Communications Annex, development of sophisticated microwave radar at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
(MIT)&#x27;s Radiation Lab, and the Manhattan Project&#x27;s development of the atomic bombs used on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945 to abruptly end the war and which later initiated further development of nuclear weapons.

After World War II, the &quot;Russian Section&quot; at Arlington Hall expanded. Work on diplomatic messages benefited from additional technical personnel and new analysts—among them Samuel Chew, who had focused on Japan, and linguist Meredith Gardner, who had worked on both German and Japanese messages. Chew had considerable success at defining the underlying structure of the coded Russian texts. Gardner and his colleagues began analytically reconstructing the KGB (the Soviet Union&#x27;s Committee for State Security) spy agency codebooks. Late in 1946, Gardner broke the codebook&#x27;s &quot;spell table&quot; for encoding English letters. With the solution of the spell table, SIS could read significant portions of messages which included English names and phrases. Gardner soon found himself reading a 1944 message listing prominent atomic scientists, including several with the Manhattan Project. Efforts to decipher Soviet codes continued under the classified and caveated Venona project.

Another problem soon arose—that of determining how and to whom to disseminate the extraordinary information Gardner was developing. SIS&#x27;s reporting procedures did not seem appropriate because the decrypted messages could not even be paraphrased for Arlington Hall&#x27;s regular intelligence customers without divulging their source. By 1946, SIS knew nothing about the federal grand jury impaneled in Manhattan, New York to probe the espionage and disloyalty charges stemming from Elizabeth Bentley&#x27;s defection and other defectors from Soviet intelligence, so no one in the U.S. Government was aware that evidence against the Soviets was suddenly developing on two adjacent tracks. In late August or early September 1947, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) was informed that the Army Security Agency had begun to break into Soviet espionage messages.
By 1945, the Soviets had penetrated Arlington Hall with the placement of Bill Weisband who worked there for several years. The government&#x27;s knowledge of his treason apparently was not revealed until its publication in a 1990 book co-authored by a high-level KGB defector.

Arlington Hall came under the aegis of the National Security Agency after the agency was created in 1952. From 1945 to 1977, Arlington Hall was the headquarters of the United States Army Security Agency and for a brief time in late 1948, the newly formed United States Air Force Security Service (USAFSS) until they moved to Brooks Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. When the United States Army Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) was commissioned at Arlington Hall on January 1, 1977, INSCOM absorbed the functions of the Army Security Agency into its operations. INSCOM remained at Arlington Hall until the summer of 1989, when INSCOM left for Fort Belvoir, Virginia. Beginning in January 1963, Arlington Hall served as the premier facility of the newly created Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA). In 1984, DIA departed Arlington Hall for its new headquarters on Joint Base Anacostia–Bolling (former Bolling Air Force Base in Washington, D.C.), a move that was complete by December 1984.

Arlington Hall was also home in the late 1950s and early 1960s to the Armed Services Technical Information Agency (ASTIA) which disseminated classified research to defense contractors. In 1989, the U.S. Department of Defense transferred the eastern portion of Arlington Hall to the Department of State. In October 1993, this portion of the site became the National Foreign Affairs Training Center when the State Department&#x27;s Foreign Service Institute (FSI) moved there from its prior location in the Mayfair Building in Washington, D.C. The National Foreign Affairs Training Center was renamed as the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center in a ceremony held on May 29, 2002, named for George P. Shultz, former Secretary of the Treasury and Secretary of State.

In January 2008, construction workers discovered an unexploded Civil War-era Parrott rifle shell underneath Arlington Hall. The shell had a length of one foot and a diameter of five inches. U.S. Army explosive ordnance disposal technicians from Fort Belvoir were brought in to dispose of the antique munition.

== Current uses ==

The National Park Service determined that Arlington Hall Station Historic District was eligible for inclusion on the National Register of Historic Places on October 7, 1988 (although it has not been officially listed). The historic main building of the former girls&#x27; school now houses classrooms and administrative offices for components of the Foreign Service Institute, on the campus of the George P. Shultz National Foreign Affairs Training Center. The western portion of Arlington Hall site presently houses the Army National Guard Readiness Center, which was named for Herbert R. Temple Jr. in 2017.

<doc id="340812" wikidata="Q5174698" url="?curid=340812" title="Cossatot River State Park-Natural Area">
<text>Cossatot River State Park-Natural Area is a Arkansas state park in Howard County and Polk County, Arkansas in the United States. The park follows a rough, undeveloped of the Cossatot River. The river itself is included in Arkansas&#x27;s Natural and Scenic Rivers System and the National Park Service&#x27;s list of National Wild and Scenic Rivers, making it a whitewater rafting destination. The rough nature of the river, including Class III, IV, and dangerous Class V rapids, make the park-natural area a popular destination for skilled canoeists, kayakers, and playboaters. The park became a part of the system in 1988 after the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism and Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission agreed to cooperative management after acquiring the property from the Weyerhaeuser Corporation.

==History==
The Arkansas Natural Heritage Commission contacted the Weyerhaeuser Corporation, the land&#x27;s owner, about developing a park from the wilderness along the Cossatot River in 1975. Although receptive of the offer, Weyerhaeuser was concerned that the commission would not properly manage the dangerous rapids. It wasn&#x27;t until 1984 when the Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism offered to join the Commission in a joint venture to acquire the land in an attempt to allay the fears of Weyerhaeuser. After a joint meeting, The Nature Conservancy held the land in trust until state funds were allocated for the park. The duality of the park-natural area&#x27;s management is still represented.

The park was expanded after Arkla Gas Company donated in exchange for crossing the Cossatot River with a gas pipeline.

==Recreation==
The Cossatot River features Class III, IV, and dangerous Class V rapids making it one of the more challenging float rivers in the central United States. Brushy Creek Recreation Area offers restrooms, picnic tables, and access to the river via the Highway 246 bridge access point. Campsites are available at the Cossatot Falls Area (7 sites, no hookups), Sandbar Area (14 sites, no hookups), and the Ed Banks Area (one site, no hookups).

The park is also home to dozens of rare flora and fauna native only to the Ouachita Mountains and surrounding Ouachita National Forest. The terrain of the park is a rugged rocky canyon with old growth hardwoods and juniper glades. Hiking is available on the River Corridor Trail () and Harris Creek Trail (). A visitor center, built in 2004, offers a wildlife observation room, a water education laboratory, and a gift shop.

<doc id="340818" wikidata="Q562020" url="?curid=340818" title="Archery at the 1988 Summer Olympics">
<text>Four events were contested in archery at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. These events included team competitions for the first time in modern Olympic archery. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s individual competitions continued to be part of the schedule as well.

The format for the individual competition was altered for the first time since the 1972 Summer Olympics. In Seoul, instead of all archers using the double FITA round to determine rankings, a sort of elimination plan was introduced. Each archer shot a single FITA round to determine initial rankings. Most archers were cut from the competition after this, with only 24 advancing. These archers then shot one-fourth the number of arrows normal for a FITA round, with these scores being used to drop more archers. This process was repeated until only 8 archers finished the fourth segment of the second round.

==Competition format==

===Individual===
84 archers competed in the men&#x27;s individual competition while 62 competed in the women&#x27;s event with a maximum of 3 athletes from each country in each event. A preliminary ranking round was held where each archer shot a single FITA round. The top 24 ranked archers from the preliminary round advanced to eighth-final. In this round archers shot one-fourth the number of arrows normal for a FITA round with the top 18 advancing to the quarterfinals. The top 12 archers from the quarterfinals advanced to the semifinals where only the top 8 advanced to the final.

===Team===
Each country that had three archers in the individual competition may also compete in the team competition. In the first round the archers shot a single FITA round with the top 12 teams advancing to the semifinal. The top 8 teams from the semifinal advanced to the final.

<text>KDE Display Manager (KDM) was a display manager (a graphical login program) developed by KDE for the windowing systems X11.

KDE Display Manager was based on the source code of X display manager and was the default display manager of the KDE Software Compilation, until it was retired in KDE Plasma 5 in favour of SDDM.

KDM allowed the user to choose a desktop environment or window manager at login. KDM used the Qt application framework. It is configurable via KDE&#x27;s System Settings; its appearance can be customized by the user.

The default KDM login screen had a list of users. Each entry was comprised in the user&#x27;s username, personal name (if available), and an icon. Next to the list is a greeting and a picture. One of the customization options is to replace the picture with an analog clock. From this screen the user can also run a user management tool, shut down or reboot the computer, or restart the X Window System.

<doc id="340823" wikidata="Q2910735" url="?curid=340823" title="Border ballad">
<text>Border ballads are a group of songs in the long tradition of balladry collected from the Anglo-Scottish border. Like all traditional ballads, they were traditionally sung unaccompanied. There may be a repeating motif, but there is no &quot;chorus&quot; as in most popular songs. The supernatural is a common theme in border ballads, as are recountings of raids and battles.

==Ballad types==
The ballads belong to various groups of subjects, such as riding ballads like &quot;Kinmont Willie&quot;; historical ballads like &quot;Sir Patrick Spens&quot;; comic ballads like &quot;Get Up and Bar the Door&quot;; and those with supernatural themes including &quot;Thomas the Rhymer&quot; (also known as &quot;True Thomas&quot; or &quot;Thomas of Erceldoune&quot;) and &quot;Tam Lin&quot;.

==Writings about==
Some of the earliest known references (in Middle Scots) to the ballads appeared in &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot; (1549). 
Sir Walter Scott wrote about border ballads in &quot;Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border&quot;, first published in 1802–03.
A. L. Lloyd said of the ballads:

<doc id="340840" wikidata="Q5189259" url="?curid=340840" title="Crowley's Ridge State Park">
<text>Crowley&#x27;s Ridge State Park is a Arkansas state park in Greene County, Arkansas in the United States atop Crowley&#x27;s Ridge. Located on the former homesite of pioneer Benjamin Crowley, the park contains many excellent examples of the work done by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s. One of Arkansas&#x27;s most popular state parks, the parks is bisected by Crowley&#x27;s Ridge Parkway, a National Scenic Byway. The site became a state park in 1933 in an effort to honor Crowley and the heritage of the Crowley&#x27;s Ridge area.

==Recreation==

The park was originally constructed in the 1930s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and the original stone and log structures give the park a rustic feel. The park offers a fishing lake originally constructed by the Arkansas National Guard and which is well stocked with channel catfish and largemouth bass by the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission. The park also has a spring-fed swimming lake which is one of the most popular swimming areas in Arkansas.

The park has modern cabins with kitchens, picnic areas, a dining hall, snack bar, and other amenities. The park also provides group accommodations for up to 60 person groups. Five bunk cabins, four fully modern duplex-style cabins with kitchens, 18 Class B and 8 tent sites serve as lodging facilities.

==National Register of Historic Places==

The bathhouse, bridge, comfort station, and dining hall are separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places:
*Crowley&#x27;s Ridge State Park-Bathhouse
*Crowley&#x27;s Ridge State Park-Bridge
*Crowley&#x27;s Ridge State Park-Comfort Station

<doc id="340842" wikidata="Q4744962" url="?curid=340842" title="American Secular Union">
<text>The American Secular Union (ASU, also sometimes called the &quot;American Secular Union and Freethought Federation&quot;) espoused secularism and freethought at the end of the 19th century in the United States.

As the National Liberal League suffered crippling factionalism and radicalization over the period 1878 to 1885, liberals reorganized in a non-political &quot;American Secular Union&quot; in 1884. Colonel Robert Green Ingersoll (1833–1899) served as the first president of the Union. Ida Craddock was elected Secretary of the Philadelphia chapter of the Union in 1889.

The American Secular Union and Freethought Federation dedicated themselves to the separation of church and state, and for its platform used the nine demands of liberalism, namely:

# that churches and other ecclesiastical property shall be no longer exempt from taxation; 
# that the employment of chaplains in the United States Congress, in state legislaturess in the United States Army and United States Navy, and in prisons, asylums, and all institutions supported by public money, shall be discontinued, and that all religious services maintained by national, state, or municipal governments shall be abolished; 
# that all public appropriations for educational and charitable institutions of a sectarian character shall cease; 
# that, while advocating the loftiest instruction in morals and the inculcation of the strictest uprightness of conduct, religious teaching and the use of the Bible for religious purposes in public schools shall be prohibited; 
# that the appointment by the President of the United States and the governors of the various states of religious festivals, fasts, and days of prayer and thanksgiving shall be discontinued; 
# that the theological oath in the courts and in other departments of government shall be abolished, and simple affirmation under the pains and penalties of perjury, established in its stead; 
# that all laws directly or indirectly enforcing in any degree the religious and theological dogmaated, and that all laws shall be conformed to the requirements of natural morality, equal rights and impartial justice; 
# that, in harmony with the Constitution of the United States and the constitutions of the several states, no special privileges or advantages shall be conceded to Christianity or any other religion; that our entire political system shall be conducted and administered on a purely secular basis; and that whatever changes are necessary to this end shall be consistently, unflinchingly, and promptly made.

The American Secular Union published over a dozen pamphlets on topics regarding separation of church and state between 1886 and 1928.

Following Ingersoll&#x27;s death in 1899 various leadership changes occurred. The organization withered around 1919.

<text>Purchase is a hamlet in the town and village of Harrison, in Westchester County, New York, United States. One myth explains that its name is derived from Harrison&#x27;s purchase, where John Harrison was to be granted as much land as he could ride in one day. Purchase is home to State University of New York at Purchase and Manhattanville College and is one of the richest communities on the east coast.

==History==
In 1695, John Harrison, a Quaker from Flushing, Queens, &quot;purchased of the Indians a tract of land about nine miles in length and nearly three in width... The Indians reserved &#x27;such whitewood trees as shall be found suitable to make canoes of...&quot; Large numbers of Friends came to settle there. They called it &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Purchase,&quot; or simply &quot;The Purchase&quot; and it is still known today as Purchase, NY. A Quaker meeting house was erected there in 1727.

In 1967, 200 residents stated support for a plan to incorporate Purchase so corporations could not build in the community. In response, officials from the Town of Harrison put forward plans to try to become a city in an attempt to stop Purchase from seceding from the Town of Harrison.

There are many historic sites located in Purchase. The grounds that SUNY Purchase now occupies was once Strathglass Farms, a dairy farm. The Quaker Friends Meeting house was founded in the 18th century. The original building fell victim to fire years ago and the present one is an accurate reconstruction. Before the headquarters of Pepsi was built, the Blind Brook Polo Club was located on that site. Amelia Earhart flew her plane from the polo grounds. Many colonial era homes and unspoiled natural woodlands have decreased in the last 30 years due to residential development. The Old Oaks Country Club, originally named &#x27;Hill Crest&#x27;, is a splendid mansion house built in the late 1880s by millionaire Trenor Luther Park and his wife Julia Catlin Park. Trenor Luther was a Harvard Graduate, who studied law, and a silk merchant. His father, Trenor William Park, funded the Panama Railway, ran for Vice President of the United States in 1864 and was involved with the California Gold Mines. Purchase is also known for being one of the richest areas in the country.

The Reid Hall, Manhattanville College was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.

==Economy and business==

Mastercard&#x27;s headquarters, Mastercard International Global Headquarters; PepsiCo; Atlas Air and its subsidiary Polar Air Cargo; Central National-Gottesman and Teladoc Health are headquartered in Purchase. Pernod Ricard has offices in Purchase.

Lenovo had previously maintained its U.S. headquarters in Purchase. In 2006, the company announced it was moving to Morrisville, North Carolina.

The average household income in Purchase is estimated to be approximately $352,000.

In 2018, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; ranked 10577 the fifth wealthiest ZIP Code in the United States.

The hamlet &quot;was used to film a sizeable chunk of the second season&quot; of &quot;The Sinner&quot; in summer 2018; one featured location is the Cobble Stone Restaurant.

The Donald M. Kendall Sculpture Gardens at the PepsiCo headquarters and the Neuberger Museum of Art at Purchase College are two significant art collections found in the community.

During the 1980s, the city hosted the festival Pepsico Summerfare, known for their opera productions which included Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; (1981–84), David Eaton&#x27;s &quot;The Cry of Clytaemnestra&quot; (1982), and Peter Sellars&#x27;s &quot;Little Mahagonny/Cantata 60: Conversations with Fear and Hope After Death&quot; (1985), Peter Sellars&#x27;s productions of Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (1986), &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1987) and &quot;Le nozze di Figaro&quot; (1988).

<doc id="340855" wikidata="Q8578453" url="?curid=340855" title="Thames Valley Police">
<text>Thames Valley Police is the territorial police force responsible for policing the Thames Valley region, covering the counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire in South East England.
It is the largest non-metropolitan police force in England and Wales, covering and a population of 2.42 million people.

==History==
Prior to the Municipal Corporations Act 1835 there were ancient ways of keeping law and order through Parish constables or quasi police bodies who conducted a wide range of duties. Modern policing in Thames Valley can be traced back to the 1835 act when a number of boroughs set up police forces. For example Newbury Borough Police were operating as a small police force soon after the passing of the Act. The force was one of around twenty borough forces that were later amalgamated with their county police force. These were Buckinghamshire Constabulary, Oxfordshire Constabulary, Berkshire Constabulary, Reading Borough Police and Oxford City Police founded in 1857, 1857, 1856, 1836 and 1868 respectively. Under the Police Act 1964 these five forces were amalgamated on 1 April 1968 to form the Thames Valley Constabulary.

Thames Valley Police has changed its name only once in its own history in 1971, from Thames Valley Constabulary to Thames Valley Police, a common change in most police forces that makes them more accessible.

Thames Valley Police&#x27;s motto in Latin is &quot;Sit pax in valle tamesis&quot; meaning &#x27;Let there be Peace in the Thames Valley&#x27;, their slogan is &#x27;Reducing crime, disorder and fear&#x27;. The Thames Valley Police shield is made up of features from the shields of its five founding constabularies including a blue river depicting the Thames river and five crowns palisado depicting the five founding forces. The stag is a symbol of the county of Berkshire, the ox a symbol of the county of Oxfordshire and the swan a symbol of the county of Buckinghamshire. Together they represent the ceremonial counties of the force area.

===Chief Constables===
* Thomas Hodgson (19681970)
* David Holdsworth (19701978)
* Peter Imbert (19791985)
* Colin Smith (19851991)
* Charles Pollard (19912002)
* Peter Neyroud (20022007)
* Sara Thornton (20072015)
* Francis Habgood (20152019)
* John Campbell (20192023)
* Jason Hogg (2023present)

==Governance==
Thames Valley Police is overseen by a locally elected Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner. The incumbent commissioner is Matthew Barber, a Conservative Party candidate elected in May 2021. The police and crime commissioner is scrutinised by the Thames Valley Police and Crime Panel.

Thames Valley was previously overseen by a police authority consisting of 19 members, made up of councillors, members from unitary authorities, independents and a magistrate.

==Organisation==
In April 2011 the force adopted a local policing model and was split into twelve local policing areas (LPAs), each led by a Superintendent or Chief Superintendent. These consist of one or two local authority areas. The LPAs in turn are split into a number of &quot;neighbourhoods&quot; based on wards and parishes. 

=== Local Policing Areas ===
* Milton Keynes
* Aylesbury Vale
* Cherwell and West Oxfordshire
* Oxford
* South Oxfordshire and Vale of White Horse
* South Buckinghamshire
* Slough
* Windsor and Maidenhead
* Bracknell and Wokingham
* Reading
* West Berkshire
Each area is responsible for delivering response policing, neighbourhood policing teams, and local investigative units including a tasking, priority crime and Criminal Investigation Department (CID). Other functions that used to be held at a local level are now delivered at force headquarters level using a shared service approach, with resources deployed as required around the force area. 

=== Force Headquarters Teams ===
A number of teams are run from force headquarters and their staff are deployed at various locations around the area:

* Major Investigation Team
* Control and Communications
* Police Dog Section
* Counter Terrorism Unit
* Intelligence Agency

== Operations ==

=== Neighbourhood Policing Team (NHPT) ===
Each LPA is sub-divided into neighbourhood wards, which are covered by a dedicated policing team that works together with the local community and partners to tackle local priorities and community crimes. NHPTs are typically conduct high-visibility patrols in their local areas, engaging with the community and solving issues affecting them.

=== Incident Crime &amp; Response (ICR) ===
Frontline response officers who work out of patrol bases in the force area and are tasked with patrolling and responding to 999 calls. Officers also conduct investigations into the calls they attend. These officers are often issued with the TASER X2. ICR officers may be tasked to patrol high crime areas for an increased police presence or to conduct follow up investigations. Officers use the Vauxhall Astra Estate, Mitsubishi L200, Peugeot 308 SW and Vauxhall Vivaro to conduct their patrols. 

=== Dog Section ===
Thames Valley Police have approximately 52 operational police dogs. The dogs are mostly donated from the RSPCA or public, and are trained at the Force Training Centre. They usually serve until they are 8 years old, receiving refresher training every year, and then living with their handler after retirement. They are part of the Joint Operations Unit with Hampshire Police. The dog section operates with marked and unmarked Mitsubishi Outlanders and Ford Mondeo estates.

=== Roads Policing Unit (RPU) ===
Thames Valley Police patrols of motorways, the most of any police force in the UK. This includes the M1, M4, M40, A329(M), A404(M) and M25, as well as many other &#x27;A&#x27; route roads including the A43.

These units are based at 6 geographical traffic bases - Milton Keynes, Taplow, Three Mile Cross (Reading), Bicester, Amersham and Abingdon. Roads Policing in Thames Valley is part of the Joint Operations Unit which works together with Hampshire Constabulary&#x27;s Roads Policing Unit.

=== Armed Response Unit (ARU) ===
Thames Valley Police&#x27;s Armed Response Unit is a 24/7 unit that responds to major and serious crimes where firearms may be involved. This unit is shared with Hampshire Police as part of the Joint Operations Unit.

The training facility is at Sulhamstead with a state of the art firearms range. The unit mostly shares the traffic bases within the force.

=== Pro-Active Team ===

This team featured in the TV show &quot;Road Wars&quot;.

This unit is part of Roads Policing and mainly uses unmarked cars across the force area. Instead of just responding to incidents, the unit uses a proactive approach by actively looking for criminals and catching them in the act, as well as patrolling areas based on intelligence.

The team works in a number of areas including Forced Method of Entry, targeted intelligence and specialist surveillance of criminals both covertly and overtly.

=== Air Operations Unit ===

The Air Support Unit was officially created in 1982, but the use of helicopters in Thames Valley goes back to 1963, when Oxford City Police experimented with a Brantly helicopter with a dog basket attached to the skids. Thames Valley Police rented helicopters for use on special occasions in the 1970s and &#x27;80s. The unit was founded in 1982 when part-time daylight flights were routinely contracted and eight Sergeants were transferred from Traffic and Operations to ASU. In 1986, the unit was moved to RAF Abingdon.

In 1988, the department became a full-time operational unit, only the third in the country at the time and a sergeant and two police constables were seconded to the unit as observers. Throughout this time the helicopters and pilots were chartered from commercial companies.

In 1996, Thames Valley Police, Bedfordshire Police and Hertfordshire Constabulary amalgamated air support resources and founded the Chiltern Air Support Unit, having received funding in 1995 to buy a second helicopter. The alliance is recognised to have started unofficially in 1992, when Thames Valley would sell flying time to its nearby forces. Helicopters were based at RAF Henlow and RAF Benson, providing support 24/7, with night-time cover from at least one base. 

Since 2012, the management of police air-support nationally has moved to the National Police Air Service (NPAS). G-TVHB continues to be based at RAF Benson, whilst the Henlow base was closed and helicopter relocated elsewhere by NPAS.

===Search and Recovery Unit===
Founded in 1956 as the Underwater Search Unit of Berkshire Constabulary and transferred to Thames Valley Police under a new name, the unit today is made up of one sergeant and seven constables and respond to around 350 operations each year.

The unit are involved in a variety of searching operations in river, underwater, underground, and cliff face conditions, searching for bodies, explosives, drugs, property, contraband and firearms and environments that can be affected by Chemical, Biological, Radioactive and Nuclear radiation.

=== Marine Support Unit ===
The Marine Support Unit carries out regular patrols of the Thames Valley and Hampshire&#x27;s waterways, as well as covering special events including Henley Royal Regatta and Reading Festival.

=== Mounted Section ===
The Thames Valley Mounted Branch based at Milton Keynes Police Station. The unit has nine police horses.
The unit is responsible for preventing equine crime, assisting in searches of rural areas, and mainly maintaining public order at demonstrations and sporting events, including the four football grounds in Thames Valley, as well as conducting deployments in Hampshire.

=== Public Order Department ===
Based in Heyford Park, formerly RAF Upper Heyford, in Oxfordshire. The POD is responsible for providing tactical support during spontaneous or pre-planned events that may result in public disorder. This includes sporting events such as football matches and Royal Ascot, music festivals such as Reading Festival, and lawful demonstrations.

===Protection Group===
Thames Valley Police has the largest non-Metropolitan Police Service operated Protection Group. This specialist department are responsible for guarding multiple fixed locations and protecting any visiting parties that require special attention. They also supply an Armed Support Vehicle to support the static sites and deal with spontaneous incidents. The officers in the unit are required to pass stringent testing, they are Authorised Firearms Officers and also trained in advanced driving, advanced first aid, method of entry amongst many other specialist skills.

===Counter Terrorism Unit (CTPSE)===
Thames Valley Police&#x27;s Counter Terrorist Unit is responsible for responding to any search related or explosive or terrorist incident, working with Protection Group to guard anyone deemed to be at risk and with dog section to locate the explosive. The unit has four explosive ordnance disposal advisors.

=== South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU) ===
The South East Regional Organised Crime Unit (SEROCU) is responsible for delivering specialist and niche capabilities to Thames Valley Police, Hampshire Constabulary, Surrey Police and Sussex Police, including investigating cyber and complex, organised crime. 

==Locations==

The headquarters of Thames Valley Police is at Oxford Road, Kidlington, Oxfordshire. Thames Valley Police has 48 police stations, with 16 front counters open to the public.

The force is covered by two control rooms, one in Abingdon, and one in Milton Keynes.

The three police contact centres were formed in 2003, following the closure of local control rooms, to support the newly formed control rooms in Abingdon and Milton Keynes. They are located at the force headquarters in Kidlington, and separate teams within the Abingdon and Milton Keynes control rooms. The contact centres handle all emergency, non-emergency and enquiry calls from the public.

Sulhamstead House in Sulhamstead, near Reading, is the Force Training Centre. It also houses the Thames Valley Police Museum, as well as operational units and fleet workshops.

Upper Heyford Park serves as the force&#x27;s Public Order Department base and training centre.

There are also several roads policing bases at strategic locations around the force at Abingdon, Bicester, Taplow, Amersham, Milton Keynes, and Three Mile Cross. Many of these also feature armouries for the Armed Response Unit. 

==Presentation==
=== Headgear ===
 Male officers typically can wear a flat cap or traditional custodian helmet, while females are issued the bowler hat. The custodian helmet was dropped for practicality and cost reasons in 2009, but was reintroduced in 2018 yet is only typically seen by officers conducting foot patrols. Traffic officers wear either a white flat cap or bowler hat. 

In 2009 Thames Valley Police proposed to be the first force to introduce the use of baseball caps as a primary mode of headgear. After trials were conducted the proposal was dropped as being &#x27;a step too far from the professional image of the force&#x27;.

Other units tend to wear police baseball caps, with other specialist headgear worn accordingly.

=== Uniform ===
Officers wear a short- or long-sleeve, black wicking top under their body armour, and black uniform trousers with cargo pockets. Soft-shell and high-visibility jackets are also issued to all officers. Epaulettes feature the rank and shoulder number of an officer. Officers the rank of inspector or above may wear white shirts, with the force badge worn on the left of their chest.

Formal dress comprises an open-necked tunic, with a white shirt or blouse and tie for both male and female officers. All officers wear peaked caps and their rank on their epaulettes. The No.1 uniform is accompanied by black boots or shoes and occasionally gloves.

The operational uniform, until 2009, consisted of traditional white shirt and tie. This was dropped when it was deemed to be impractical and outdated – not withstanding the retention of this uniform by other forces and the almost universal retention of the helmet.
However, starting with the Royal Wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, TVP has started issuing the custodian helmet again.

Police Community Support Officers (PCSOs) wear a similar uniform to police officers on patrol, but consisting of a blue wicking top and single blue band on flat caps. Other staff may wear wicking tops or white shirts, depending on role.

=== Equipment ===
Police officers

* Sepura SC21 TETRA digital radios, encrypted on the Airwave network
* Reveal D-Series body-worn video camera
* Monadnock Autolock 22&quot; baton
* Captor360 PAVA spray
* TCH rigid handcuffs 
* Leg restraints
* A first aid, major trauma and resuscitation kit

PCSOs only carry a radio, BWV and paperwork required for their role.
Police vehicles contain a variety of equipment, which can include Arnold batons, shields, traffic cones, road signs, breathalysers, stingers, speed guns, ANPR cameras and more.

=== Livery ===
Marked vehicles use the modern yellow and blue retro-reflective battenberg markings on operational vehicles, as well as the Thames Valley Police shield and website link. Some semi-marked cars are used by Neighbourhood Policing Teams, which only have plain Thames Valley Police markings on the back and sides.

Thames Valley Police stopped using the &#x27;jam sandwich&#x27; police car markings between 2000 and 2005 when battenburg markings were adopted and implemented.

==Strength and recruitment==
Thames Valley Police employs 7,900 people and 908 volunteers. Of which 4,250 are warranted police officers, over 500 are police community support officers (PCSO) and 3,150 are civilian staff. Of the 908 volunteers, 500 are police support volunteers (PSV) and 280 are warranted special constables.

Training for new recruits in Thames Valley is held at the Force Training Centre, Sulhamstead. Officers attend a (sometimes residential) training course, and are then deployed for continued tutoring at their posting. Officers will achieve independent patrol status once on area, usually within four months of completing initial training. PCSOs receive 18 weeks of training at Sulhamstead. Special constables see between six and seven months of training at weekends, with mandatory online training in between. Special constables will achieve fit for independent patrol status, usually within one year, but this is dependent on the number of tours of duty.

Recruits receive their uniform and kit in the first week of training. Warrant cards are issued at attestation, where new officers swear their oath at the start of the second day of training.

===Future of Thames Valley Police===

In a report published by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary in July 2011, the impact on the number of police officers and staff partly due to the reduction to Thames Valley Police&#x27;s budget following the comprehensive spending review is as follows:

== Performance ==

=== His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary ===
A report from March 2010 by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary marked Thames Valley Police as &#x27;fair&#x27; on local crime and policing, &#x27;fair&#x27; on protection from serious harm and &#x27;fair&#x27; on confidence and satisfaction.

In detail, Thames Valley was awarded only one &#x27;excellent&#x27; for reducing road death and injury. They were &#x27;fair&#x27; in all other categories except &#x27;solving crime&#x27; and &#x27;comparative satisfaction of BME community&#x27; and &#x27;low/medium&#x27; for &#x27;number of police officers and PCSOs&#x27;. They were praised for their 14% reduction in burglary after &#x27;Operation Breaker&#x27; in July 2009.

=== Independent Police Complaints Commission ===
In the year 2008/9 the number of complaints recorded decreased by 2% but an increase of 8% above the previous years national average. The number of allegations recorded increased by 23% and 11% above the previous years national average.
Thames Valley Police received 947 complaints and 1903 allegations, the national average being 338 per 1000 officers, TVP has 372, and TVP is just above 369 per 1000 officers, the average from a group of similar forces.

Of allegations 23% were &#x27;failure or neglect in duty&#x27;, 19% were &#x27;incivility, impoliteness and intolerance&#x27;, 14% &#x27;assault&#x27;, 4% were &#x27;discrimination&#x27; and 1% were &#x27;breach of PACE Code A&#x27;.

And of the 1903 allegations, 51% were investigated, 36% were locally resolved, 6% were withdrawn, 7% were dispensed and 0% were discontinued. Of the 51% allegations investigated 13% were substantiated and 87% were unsubstantiated.

Thames Valley Police investigates the greatest amount of allegations compared to its peer forces, its investigation rate is 15% higher than the national average. Its use of &#x27;local resolution&#x27; has dropped 12% since 2005/6. Thames Valley has fewer allegations that are withdrawn, dispensed or discontinued.

===PEEL inspection 2022===
His Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire &amp; Rescue Services (HMICFRS) conducts a periodic police effectiveness, efficiency and legitimacy (PEEL) inspection of each police service&#x27;s performance. In its latest PEEL inspection, Thames Valley Police was rated as follows:

==Controversy==

===Firearms training incident===
On 30 May 2007 at Thames Valley Police headquarters in Kidlington whilst teaching a half-day course on firearms, PC David Micklethwaite demonstrated a Magnum .44 revolver which he had mistakenly loaded with live rounds. He pointed the gun at Keith Tilbury, a police phone operator attending the course, and fired the gun, almost killing Tilbury.

The firearms instructor was reported to have failed the qualification at a Metropolitan Police training course, but TVP decided he would pass their less stringent test and was therefore suitable to teach the lesson, despite not having been provided with additional training since failing the Metropolitan Police course. The instructor was told to cover the lesson at short notice and accidentally picked up a live round from the force&#x27;s armoury instead of dummy rounds. This mistake occurred due to both live and dummy rounds both being kept in the same Quality Street tin.

Keith Tilbury underwent immediate surgery to his bowel, kidney, lung and liver. In court, it was said he was unlikely to work again.

Thames Valley Police pleaded guilty to breaching regulations; they were fined £40,000 and £25,000 for legal costs. Constable Micklethwaite initially denied any wrongdoing, but later admitted to breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. PC Micklethwaite was not charged with misconduct because he retired from the Thames Valley Police before misconduct proceedings could be completed.

===Underage PCSOs===
In 2007 Thames Valley Police admitted to being one of five UK forces that had employed Police Community Support Officers that were aged 16. This is not illegal as the minimum age limit of 18 applies to Constables, not PCSOs. However, concerns were raised that this represented &quot;policing on the cheap&quot; as candidates aged under 18 have a different wage scale and could cost £10,000 less per annum. It was also feared that the officers were being placed in unreasonable danger as PCSOs and police have been attacked and stabbed in the past.

===Discrimination incident===

In August 2024, the Thames Valley Police were found to have unlawfully “directly discriminated” against three white officers two years prior by passing them over for a promotion due to higher-ups secretly wanting to only promote someone from a racial minority instead, automatically promoting an underqualified Asian sergeant into the position of Detective-Inspector in order to boost the diversity of its senior staff, without properly considering the said white British officers for the same position. 

==Budget cuts==

===Proposed merger===
Proposals made by the Home Secretary on 20 March 2006 would see the force stay as a single strategic police force for the area, a merger with Hampshire Constabulary having been rejected.

===Budget deficit===

In 2010, it was reported that Thames Valley Police had to make savings of £52million over the next four years. Chief Constable Thornton said that they would have to &#x27;cut back on all non-essential activity&#x27;. £347million of savings were identified including back office cuts and efficiency measures, as well as cutting officers numbers by 10%, meaning 800 officers.

==In the media==

The fictional &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;, the main character in 13 novels by Colin Dexter and 33 television episodes by ITV, works for Thames Valley Police, but in the spin-off series, &quot;Lewis&quot;, the force is referred to as Oxfordshire Police. The prequel spin-off &quot;Endeavour&quot; covers Morse&#x27;s early years in Oxford City Police and takes its merger into Thames Valley Police as a continuing theme.

In 1982 the BBC broadcast a nine-part series by Roger Graef and Charles Stewart entitled &quot;Police&quot;, which showed a fly-on-the-wall account of Thames Valley&#x27;s E Division based in Reading. This featured the rather demeaning treatment of a female victim of rape which was much discussed in the media at the time.

In 1987, Thames Valley police were in the news because they failed to stop a gunman from killing 15 members of the public and 1 unarmed Police Officer. The gunman took his own life before being arrested; this came to be known as the Hungerford massacre.

Between 2003 and 2008 a Sky1 programme, &quot;Road Wars&quot;, followed the Roads Policing Proactive and Problem Solving Team while they carried out their duties. The series followed a select group of officers on duty, who as a result became too well known causing the Chief Constable to ask Sky to move their programme to another force.

More recently, Thames Valley Police has featured in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Catching a Killer&quot;, which follows Major Crime Team officers as they investigate murders. 

Following the killing of Andrew Harper in service in 2019, &quot;The Killing of PC Harper: A Widow&#x27;s Fight for Justice&quot; aired in 2022.

==Other activities==

===IT resource merger===
Thames Valley Police and Hampshire Police authorities have agreed to share ICT support and infrastructure, with all IT workers now employees of Thames Valley Police. This will also include the Isle of Wight, a division of Hampshire Police. The partnership in Information Technology is the first of its kind in the country.

=== Chiltern Transport Consortium ===
Thames Valley Police is the lead force in the Chiltern Transport Consortium (CTC), providing the fleet and maintenance for 6 different police forces. Members include the British Transport Police, Civil Nuclear Constabulary, Bedfordshire Police, Hertfordshire Police and Cambridgeshire Police. 

===Thames Valley Police Museum===
The Thames Valley Police Museum is located within Sulhamstead House, known locally as the &#x27;White House&#x27;, at Sulhamstead in the English county of Berkshire. The site was formerly the headquarters of the Berkshire Constabulary, and is now the training centre for the Thames Valley Police. The museum is open by appointment and on Wednesdays 12-1pm.

The museum includes displays on the history of Thames Valley Police and the five police forces that were amalgamated to form the force in 1968; the Buckinghamshire Constabulary, the Berkshire Constabulary, Oxford City Police, the Oxfordshire Constabulary and the Reading Borough Police. The museum&#x27;s collections include items from the Great Train Robbery of 1963, uniforms, equipment, medals, photographs, scenes of crime evidence, and occurrence and charge books.

In 2006, the exhibition space of the museum was renovated. Since September 2017, the museum has been temporarily closed prior to relocation.

==Officers killed in the line of duty==

The Police Roll of Honour Trust and Police Memorial Trust list and commemorate all British police officers killed in the line of duty. Since its establishment in 1984, the Police Memorial Trust has erected 50 memorials nationally to some of those officers.

<text>Kathryn Dawn Lang (born November 2, 1961), known by her stage name k.d. lang (stylized in all lowercase), is a Canadian pop and country singer-songwriter and occasional actress. Lang has won Juno Awards and Grammy Awards for her musical performances. Her hits include the songs &quot;Constant Craving&quot; and &quot;Miss Chatelaine&quot;.

A mezzo-soprano, lang has contributed songs to movie soundtracks and has collaborated with musicians such as Roy Orbison, Tony Bennett, Elton John, the Killers, Anne Murray, Ann Wilson, Karen Carpenter, and Jane Siberry. She performed at the closing ceremony of the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, and at the opening ceremony of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, where she performed Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot;.

Lang has also been active as an animal rights, gay rights, and Tibetan human rights activist. She is a tantric practitioner of the old school of Tibetan Buddhism.

==Early life==
Lang was born in Edmonton, Alberta, the youngest child of Audrey Bebee and Adam Frederick Lang. She is of English, Irish, Scottish, German, Russian-Jewish, Icelandic, and Sioux ancestry. When lang was nine months old, her family moved to Consort, Alberta, where she grew up with two older sisters and one older brother in the Canadian prairies. Her father, a drugstore owner, left the family when she was twelve.

After secondary school, lang attended Red Deer College, where she became fascinated with the life and music of Patsy Cline and decided to pursue a career as a professional singer. She moved to Edmonton, Alberta, after her graduation in 1982.

== Career ==

=== k.d. lang and the Reclines (1983–1989) ===
Lang answered Jim Alexander&#x27;s classified ad in the Edmonton Journal looking for a singer for his country-swing band. After a show at Devil&#x27;s Lake Corral which drew over 500 people, lang joined with label owner and manager Larry Wanagas to form a Patsy Cline tribute band, the Reclines, in 1983. They recorded their debut single, &quot;Friday Dance Promenade&quot;, at Sundown Recorders. The first band featured Stu Macdougal on keys, Dave Bjarnason on drums, Gary Koligar on guitar and bassist Farley Scott.

The Reclines regularly played Edmonton&#x27;s popular Sidetrack Cafe, a local venue that featured live bands six nights a week. In 1983, lang presented a performance-art piece, a seven-hour re-enactment of the transplantation of an artificial heart for Barney Clark, a retired American dentist. &quot;A Truly Western Experience&quot; was released in 1984 and received strong reviews and led to national attention in Canada. In August 1984, lang was one of three Canadian artists to be selected to perform at the World Science Fair in Tsukuba, Japan (along with other performing and recording contracts throughout Japan).

Singing at country and western venues in Canada, lang began to establish an appearance and style referred to as &quot;cowboy punk&quot;. She was called a &quot;Canadian Cowpunk&quot; in the June 20, 1985, issue of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. She would later recall the inspiration for her defining look in an interview with the Canadian Press: &quot;I used to sew plastic cowboys and Indians on my clothes – just having fun with it on a budget. I was broke at the time, so I&#x27;d find things at Value Village or get my mom to make me a skirt from the curtains she was about to throw out. I loved playing with the clothes as much as the music.&quot;

Lang made several recordings that received very positive reviews and earned a 1985 Juno Award for Most Promising Female Vocalist. She accepted the award wearing a wedding dress borrowed from her male roommate. She also made numerous tongue-in-cheek promises about what she would and would not do in the future, thus fulfilling the title of &#x27;Most Promising&#x27;. She has won a total of eight Juno Awards.

In 1986, lang signed a contract with an American record producer in Nashville, Tennessee, and received critical acclaim for her 1987 album, &quot;Angel with a Lariat&quot;, which was produced by Dave Edmunds.

In 1989, lang released her last album with the Reclines, &quot;Absolute Torch And Twang,&quot; which won the Grammy for Best Female Country Vocal Performance.

=== Solo career ===
Lang chose to use a lower-case name, inspired by the poet E. E. Cummings.

Lang&#x27;s career received a huge boost when Roy Orbison chose her to record a duet of his standard, &quot;Crying&quot;, a collaboration that won them the Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals in 1989. The song was used in the Jon Cryer film &quot;Hiding Out&quot; released in 1987. Due to the success of the song, lang received the Entertainer of the Year award from the Canadian Country Music Association. Lang would win the same award for the next three years, in addition to two Female Vocalist of the Year awards in 1988 and 1989.

1988 marked the release of &quot;Shadowland&quot;, an album of torch country produced by Owen Bradley. In late 1988, &quot;Shadowland&quot; was named Album of the Year by the Canadian Country Music Association. That year she also performed &quot;Turn Me Round&quot; at the closing ceremonies of the XV Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, and sang background vocals with Jennifer Warnes and Bonnie Raitt for Orbison&#x27;s acclaimed television special, &quot;Roy Orbison and Friends, A Black and White Night&quot;.

Lang first earned international recognition in 1988 when she performed as &quot;The Alberta Rose&quot; at the closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics. Canadian women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Chatelaine&quot; selected lang as its &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; in 1988.

In 1990, lang contributed the song &quot;So in Love&quot; to the Cole Porter tribute album &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization. In 1998, she contributed &quot;Fado Hilário&quot; to the AIDS benefit compilation album &quot;Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon&quot; produced by the same organization.

=== Grammy Awards and mainstream success ===
Lang won the Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance for her 1989 album &quot;Absolute Torch and Twang&quot;. The single &quot;Full Moon Full of Love&quot; that stemmed from that album became a modest hit in the United States in the middle of 1989 and a Number 1 hit on the RPM Country chart in Canada. In 1989, she sang a duet, &quot;Sin City&quot;, with Dwight Yoakam on his album &quot;Just Lookin&#x27; for a Hit&quot;.

The 1992 album &quot;Ingénue&quot;, a set of adult-oriented pop songs that showed comparatively little country influence, contained her most popular song, &quot;Constant Craving&quot;. That song brought her multi-million sales and much critical acclaim. Coming out as lesbian the same year saw several US country stations banning her music, and she faced a picket line outside the 1993 Grammy Awards ceremony where she would receive the Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance. Another top ten single from the record was &quot;Miss Chatelaine&quot;. The salsa-inspired track was ironic; &quot;Chatelaine&quot;, a women&#x27;s magazine, once chose lang as its &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;, and the song&#x27;s video depicted lang in an exaggeratedly feminine manner, surrounded by bright pastel colours and a profusion of bubbles reminiscent of a performance on &quot;The Lawrence Welk Show&quot;.

She received a writing credit for the Rolling Stones 1997 song, &quot;Anybody Seen My Baby?&quot;, whose chorus sounds similar to &quot;Constant Craving&quot;. Jagger and Richards claimed to have never heard the song before and when they discovered the similarity prior to the song&#x27;s release, were flummoxed as to how the songs could be so similar. Jagger discovered his daughter listening to a recording of &quot;Constant Craving&quot; on her stereo and realized he had heard the song before many times but only subliminally. The two gave lang credit, along with her co-writer Ben Mink, to avoid any possible lawsuits. Afterwards, lang said she was &quot;completely honoured and flattered&quot; to receive the songwriting credit.

She contributed much of the music towards Gus Van Sant&#x27;s soundtrack of the film &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;, and also did a cover of &quot;Skylark&quot; for the 1997 film adaptation of &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot;. She performed &quot;Surrender&quot; for the closing titles of the James Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;Drag&quot;, an album of cover tunes dedicated to &quot;smoke&quot; (specifically cigarette smoking), was released. The album cover and booklet photographs show lang in a man&#x27;s suit, referring to cross-dressing as another possible meaning of the word &quot;drag&quot;. The songs on &quot;Drag&quot; include &quot;Smoke Dreams&quot;, from the &#x27;40s, Steve Miller Band&#x27;s &quot;The Joker&quot;, &quot;Smoke Rings&quot;, the theme from the cult film &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, and eight other smoke-themed songs.

In 1999, lang ranked No. 33 on &quot;VH-1&#x27;s 100 Greatest Women in Rock &amp; Roll&quot;, and she ranked No. 26 on &quot;CMT&#x27;s 40 Greatest Women in Country Music&quot; in 2002, one of eight women to make both lists.

=== 2000s ===
In 2003, she won her fourth Grammy Award, for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album for her collaboration with Tony Bennett on &quot;A Wonderful World&quot;.

In 2004, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Few singers command such perfection of pitch. Her voice, at once beautiful and unadorned and softened with a veil of smoke, invariably hits the middle of a note and remains there. She discreetly flaunted her technique, drawing out notes and shading them from sustained cries into softer, vibrato-laden murmurs. She balanced her commitment to the material with humor, projecting a twinkling merriment behind it all.&quot;

In the same year, lang released &quot;Hymns of the 49th Parallel&quot;, which featured cover versions of songs by iconic English-speaking Canadian singer-songwriters: Bruce Cockburn, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell, Ron Sexsmith, Jane Siberry, and Neil Young. According to the Canadian Record Industry Association (CRIA), in April 2006, the album went platinum in Canada selling over 100,000 copies. In December 2007, the album reached double platinum status in Australia selling over 140,000 copies.

Also in 2004, she sang the song &quot;Little Patch of Heaven&quot; for the Disney film &quot;Home on the Range&quot;.

On July 29, 2006, lang performed her hit &quot;Constant Craving&quot; at the opening ceremonies of the Outgames held in Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

In 2006, she paired with singer Madeleine Peyroux on a cover of the Joni Mitchell song &quot;River&quot;, for Peyroux&#x27;s album, &quot;Half the Perfect World&quot;. That same year lang was featured in Nellie McKay&#x27;s second album, &quot;Pretty Little Head&quot;, singing with McKay in &quot;We Had it Right&quot;. As well, lang sang a version of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Golden Slumbers&quot; for the &quot;Happy Feet&quot; film soundtrack. She also sang a duet with Ann Wilson on the Heart singer&#x27;s solo album &quot;Hope &amp; Glory&quot; covering the Lucinda Williams song &quot;Jackson&quot;.

In 2007, she teamed up with one of her childhood idols, Anne Murray, on a remake of Anne&#x27;s hit, &quot;A Love Song&quot;, that was featured on Anne&#x27;s album &quot;Anne Murray Duets: Friends &amp; Legends&quot;.

On February 5, 2008, she released an album of new material entitled &quot;Watershed&quot;. It was her first collection of original material since the release of her 2000 album &quot;Invincible Summer&quot;.

=== 2010s ===
Lang&#x27;s first complete greatest-hits collection was released on February 2, 2010, on the Nonesuch label as &quot;Recollection&quot;. 

In 2010, she was in Nashville, working on a new album, titled &quot;Sing it Loud&quot;. The Nonesuch album was released by lang and the Siss Boom Bang in a spring 2011 release. The band toured North America in summer 2011.

=== Semi-retirement ===
In 2019, lang said in an interview that she considers herself semi-retired and may not be writing and recording new songs in the future. &quot;I&#x27;m not feeling any particular urge to make music right now. The muse is eluding me. I am completely at peace with the fact that I may be done.&quot;

She has also made guest appearances on the sitcoms &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot;, &quot;Dharma &amp; Greg&quot;, and the famous coming out episode of &quot;Ellen&quot;. She appeared on the Christmas special of &quot;Pee Wee&#x27;s Playhouse&quot;, where she performed the song &quot;Jingle Bell Rock&quot;. She also made a guest appearance on the &quot;Garbage&quot; episode of &quot;The Jim Henson Hour&quot;, and in 2008 appeared on Rove McManus&#x27; live hour show &quot;Rove&quot;.

Lang performed with the BBC Concert Orchestra for an intimate crowd at 18th-century church LSO St Luke&#x27;s in London on February 3, 2008. First aired as part of the BBC Four Sessions, the concert was released as a DVD entitled &quot;Live in London&quot; in 2009.

On February 12, 2010, she performed Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot; at the Olympics Opening Ceremony in Vancouver, British Columbia. In early May 2010, lang filled in at the last minute for Susan Boyle at the Australian TV Logie Awards to reprise her Winter Olympics performance of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, receiving an extended standing ovation. In 2010, she sang &quot;You&#x27;re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&quot; with Matthew Morrison in a Christmas episode of &quot;Glee&quot;, and is featured on &quot;&quot;. In February 2013, she appeared in Season 8 of the CBS sitcom, &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;, as herself.

On February 16, 2020, she performed at Fire Fight Australia at ANZ Stadium in Sydney, Australia. This was a concert organised to raise money for those affected by the 2019 bushfires in Australia.

In September 2024, lang will reunite with her old band The Reclines to perform together for the first time in 35 years at the 2024 Canadian Country Music Awards in Edmonton, Alberta.

==Activism==

Lang, who came out as a lesbian in a June 1992 article of the LGBT news magazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;, has championed gay rights causes.

She has supported many causes over the years, including HIV/AIDS care and research. Her cover of Cole Porter&#x27;s &quot;So in Love&quot; (from the Broadway musical, &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;), appears on the &quot;Red Hot + Blue&quot; compilation album and video from 1990 (a tribute to Cole Porter to benefit AIDS research and relief). Her 2010 greatest hits album, &quot;Recollection&quot;, also includes this cover of &quot;So in Love&quot;. Lang also recorded the song &quot;Fado Hilário&quot;, singing in Portuguese, for the 1999 Red Hot AIDS benefit album &quot;Onda Sonora: Red Hot + Lisbon&quot;, a traditional fado from Portugal.

She is a vegetarian. Her &quot;Meat Stinks&quot; campaign in the 1990s created much controversy, particularly in her hometown, in the middle of Alberta&#x27;s cattle ranching industry—she was banned from more than 30 Alberta radio stations. A sign in Consort, Alberta, stating &quot;Home of k.d. lang&quot; was burned to the ground. Alberta&#x27;s agriculture minister at the time said it was &quot;extremely unfortunate that she has decided to side with the animal rightists. There&#x27;s a certain feeling of betrayal – we have supported k.d. fairly well in Alberta&quot;. More than a dozen radio stations in the U.S. throughout Kansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, Montana, and Nebraska also boycotted playing her records due to her &quot;Meat Stinks&quot; campaign.

Lang appeared on the cover of the August 1993 issue of &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; photographed by Herb Ritts. The cover featured lang in a barber chair while model Cindy Crawford appeared to shave her face with a straight razor, which lang would later say was inspired by the French film &quot;Le mari de la coiffeuse&quot;. The issue contained a detailed article about lang which observed that she had thought that she would be ostracized by the country music industry when she came out as a lesbian. &quot;I presented myself as myself. I didn&#x27;t try to dispel lesbian rumors. I sang songs like &#x27;Bopalina,&#x27; which was about my girlfriend. I didn&#x27;t take boyfriends to the Grammys. I didn&#x27;t do anything to cover it up; I just lived my life. There was a part of me that really didn’t think it was important to make an announcement. But to the gay community, saying &#x27;I&#x27;m a lesbian&#x27; is dispelling any doubt.&quot; However, they were accepting, and her records continued to sell, but when she appeared in an ad for PETA, they were less impressed, owing to the relationship between country music and cattle ranching.

In April 2008, lang spent time in Melbourne, Australia, as a guest editor for &quot;The Age&quot;. This was in connection with her support for the Tibet human rights issues. On April 24, 2008, she joined pro-Tibet protesters in Canberra as the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics torch relay made its way through the Australian capital.

In 2011, lang was inducted to Q Hall of Fame Canada in recognition of the work she has done to further equality for all peoples around the world.

Lang reflected on coming out in a 2016 interview with The Canadian Press, saying it &quot;felt like it was the most responsible thing for society and myself&quot; at the time. She also noted that dealing with the fallout was something she struggled with in the years that followed. &quot;It&#x27;s a very hard thing to unravel for me and decipher&quot;, she said. &quot;In a way you can&#x27;t. It&#x27;s all just a big ball of wax of who I am and what my role in popular culture was – and what pop culture&#x27;s role was in me.&quot;

Lang is a member of Canadian charity Artists Against Racism.

== Achievements ==
In 1996, she was made an Officer of the Order of Canada.

In 1998, she was inducted into The ArQuives: Canada&#x27;s LGBTQ2+ Archives&#x27; National Portrait Collection.

In November 2005, lang received the National Arts Centre Award, a companion award of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards. On June 3, 2008, it was announced that she would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. In 2018 lang was appointed to the Alberta Order of Excellence.

On April 21, 2013, during the 2013 Juno Awards, lang was formally inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame. She is notable for praising Canadians and &quot;letting your freak flags fly&quot; during her acceptance speech. Also in 2013, the Alberta Ballet Company staged &quot;Balletlujah!&quot; set to the songs of lang&#x27;s music and inspired by lang. The ballet was later made into a film broadcast on CBC.

In June 2024, lang was announced to be the 2024 Canadian Country Music Hall of Fame Artist inductee.

==Personal life==
A 2008 article in which lang is interviewed states that &quot;when she isn&#x27;t working, Lang is mostly a homebody, living quietly with a girlfriend she refers to as &#x27;my wife&#x27; — they are not legally married — and her two dogs.&quot; On November 11, 2009, she entered into a domestic partnership with Jamie Price, whom she had met in 2003. After separating on September 6, 2011, lang filed for a dissolution of the partnership in Los Angeles County Superior Court in Los Angeles, California, on December 30, 2011.

== Musical style and influences ==
Early in life, lang was listening to and was influenced by female artists, such as Joni Mitchell, Rickie Lee Jones, Kate Bush, Emmylou Harris, and Linda Ronstadt. Lang pursued country music in the 1980s, but viewed it as a brief obsession. &quot;I fell in love with the emotion of country music, and the kitschness of it. I sang country music for mentors like Patsy [Cline] and Loretta [Lynn], people I loved who were telling their stories. I loved the direct human emotion they had through country. It’s just when you pull out into a bigger demographic, it gets a little scary for me. I never fell in love with the politics of country and western. I enjoyed a liaison with the musical genre but in no way did I ever think that’s who I was. I still cringe when people call me a country and western singer because I do not align with the politics of it whatsoever.&quot;

Lang&#x27;s voice is described as a mezzo soprano. She has a powerful, husky tone in her lower range, and has a beautiful higher range. Her voice lies between the soprano and the contralto voice types.

<text>The Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America was a union of African-American tenant farmers and sharecroppers, organized by Robert L. Hill. A meeting of this union near Elaine, Arkansas, was disrupted on the evening of September 30, 1919. The fatal shooting of a white man sparked retaliation by whites; hundreds poured into the area, attacking blacks on sight and resulting in the Elaine Race Riot, believed to be the deadliest in American history.

==Background==
The Progressive Farmers and Household Union of America was formed by Robert L. Hill of Winchester, Arkansas, a black tenant farmer. He claimed chapters in 15 to 20 counties, and the union had several lodges in the Elaine area. 

In late 1919 the union organized resistance among blacks in the Elaine area: black women stopped working in domestic positions in white households, and the union demanded higher wages for cotton pickers. The union had also hired lawyers at the state capital and planned to sue landlords for shares allegedly withheld from tenant farmers and sharecroppers.

==Elaine race riot==

The union was largely destroyed by the violent riots and white repression that followed in Phillips County. Hundreds of whites formed militias to hunt down blacks throughout the county and suppress what they claimed was an &quot;insurrection&quot;. The Governor of Arkansas, Charles Hillman Brough, led a detachment of federal troops into the county, and hundreds of blacks were arrested. A total of five whites and an estimated 100–237 blacks were killed in the following days, some by troops. Other blacks were required to have passes signed by military authorities and attested by a reputable white citizen in order to move about in public. In the week after the shooting, roving bands of whites and federal troops killed an estimated 100 to 200 blacks in the area. 

After the violence, a grand jury, made up of all-white local landlords and merchants, decided who would be indicted. Those black men willing to testify against others and who agreed to work on whatever terms their landlords set for them were freed. Blacks labeled as ringleaders or who were judged &quot;unreliable&quot; were indicted. According to the affidavits later supplied by the defendants, many of the prisoners had been beaten, whipped or tortured by electric shocks to extract testimony or confessions; they were threatened with death if they were to recant such testimony.

Robert Hill escaped to the state of Kansas during the first days of the riot. He was arrested there but the governor refused to extradite him to Arkansas to face charges. 

Some 122 blacks were indicted in Arkansas, with 73 charged with murder; no whites were prosecuted. Many suspects were beaten and tortured through electric shock to elicit forced testimony. The trials by all-white juries were dominated by armed whites milling around outside the courthouse, with some armed men inside the courtroom. 

Twelve men were convicted of murder and sentenced to death. Their appeals took two tracks, with six men (Ware et al.) winning reversals of their convictions in state court; they were retried and convicted, but won another appeal in the state supreme court. They were released in 1923 under Arkansas law after the state failed to retry them within two years. 

The convictions of the remaining six defendants (Moore et al.) were eventually reversed by the United States Supreme Court in &quot;Moore v. Dempsey&quot; , on the basis of violation of their right to due process because of the conditions of the trial and related publicity. This was an important precedent for the Supreme Court to review state criminal trials through application of the Bill of Rights. The NAACP, which had helped fund and commission the defense team, strengthened its reputation for working on behalf of African Americans. Walter F. White, the NAACP field secretary who had investigated the riot in the field, gained renown for his reporting on the massacre, including its high number of black fatalities. He later served for decades as executive secretary of the NAACP.

<doc id="340875" wikidata="Q2455683" url="?curid=340875" title="Lucena position">
<text>The Lucena position is a position in chess endgame theory where one side has a rook and a pawn and the defender has a rook. Karsten Müller said that it may be the most important position in endgame theory. It is fundamental in the rook and pawn versus rook endgame. If the side with the pawn can reach this type of position, they can forcibly win the game. Most rook and pawn versus rook endgames reach either the Lucena position (with the King of the stronger side in front of the pawn) or the Philidor position (with the defending King in front of the pawn) if played accurately. The side with the pawn will try to reach the Lucena position to win; the other side will try to reach the Philidor position to draw.

Rook and any number of pawns endgames, which occur in 8–10% of all games, may simplify to the Lucena position. As it is a known win, the player with the pawn will often try to reach the Lucena position, while the other player will try to prevent it. There is an alternate method for winning this type of position that works only for pawns on the c-file through the f-file (see ).

==Introduction==
The Lucena position is, incorrectly, named after the Castillian Luis Ramírez de Lucena, since the position does not appear in his book on chess, &quot;Repetición de Amores e Arte de Axedrez&quot; (1497). The earliest preserved discussion of the position is in Alessandro Salvio&#x27;s &quot;Il Puttino&quot; (1634), a romance on the career of the chess player Leonardo da Cutro, and it is in that form that it is given here. Salvio attributes it to Scipione Genovino. It is likely that the error arose from the sixth edition of the &quot;Handbuch des Schachspiels&quot; (1880), in which editor Constantin Schwede incorrectly attributed the position to &quot;Lucena 96&quot;, possibly as a result of confusion over the references in Antonius van der Linde&#x27;s 1874 work &quot;Das Schachspiel des XVI. Jahrhunderts&quot;.

The position is shown above and below (the position can be moved as a whole or mirrored so that the pawn is on any of the b through g). White&#x27;s aim is to either promote his pawn or else compel Black to give up his rook for it – either result will leave White with an overwhelming advantage and a straightforward win. White has managed to advance his pawn to the seventh rank, but it is prevented from queening because his own king is in the way. White would like to move his king and then promote his pawn, but is prevented from moving to the a-file by the black rook, and prevented from moving to the c-file by the black king.

The essential characteristics of the position are:
* the pawn is any pawn except a rook pawn
* the pawn has advanced to the seventh 
* the attacking king (the one with the pawn) is on the queening square of its pawn
* the attacking rook cuts off the opposing king from the pawn by at least one 
* the defending rook is on the file on the other side of the pawn

A straightforward approach by White (in the position above) such as 
: 1. Rd1+ Ke7
: 2. Kc7

gets nowhere. Black can simply harass the white king with checks, and White makes no progress: 
: 2... Rc2+
: 3. Kb6 Rb2+
: 4. Ka7 Ra2+
: 5. Kb8 

==The winning method: building a bridge==

In the Lucena position, the side with the pawn has a winning method that always works for any pawn except a rook pawn (i.e. on the a- or h-file). In some circumstances, it also works for a rook pawn.

In the Lucena position, White can win with 
: 1. Rd1+ Ke7
: 2. Rd4
Now, if Black plays a , such as 
: 2... Ra1
hoping to harass the white king with checks again as in the above variation, White continues 
: 3. Kc7 Rc1+
: 4. Kb6 Rb1+
: 5. Kc6 Rc1+
Or 5.Ka6 Ra1+.
: 6. Kb5 Rb1+
: 7. Rb4!

The black rook can no longer check the white king without exchanging rooks, and Black cannot prevent the pawn from queening. Aron Nimzowitsch described this way for White to shield their king and pawn with their rook as &quot;building a bridge&quot;.

It is important that the white rook go initially to the fourth rank if Black uses his most active defense: repeatedly checking the white king. If Black abandons this defense, the white rook can build a bridge on the fifth rank. In the line above, after 
:5. Kc6
if Black moves 
:5... Ke6
there is a trap for White: if 6.Rd5 (to build a bridge on the fifth rank) then 6...Rxb7! draws. However, if 
:6. Rd6+
6.Re4+ followed by either 7.Re8 or (if 7...Kf7) 8.Re5 works as well. 
:6... Ke7
:7. Rd5!
and White can build a bridge on the fifth rank by getting the rook to b5, the king to b6, and then the pawn can promote (position reflected):

:7... Rc1+
:8. Kb6 Rb1+
:9. Rb5
and White wins.

If the defending rook is on the rank that would prevent moving the rook to the crucial rank (i.e. 2.Rd4), the win is straightforward, see .

===Black to move===

If Black is to move in the diagrammed position, he can prevent the white rook from going to the fourth rank, but then White still wins:
:1... Ra4
:2. Rd1+ Ke7
:3. Kc7 Rc4+
:4. Kb6 Rb4+
:5. Ka6 Rb2
(The black rook is not sufficiently far away to keep checking: if 5...Ra4+ then 6.Kb5 wins.) Now White wins by blocking the checks with
:6. Rd5
followed by
:7. Rb5
===Bridge on the fifth rank===

A bridge can also be built on the fifth rank (but it is better to build one on the fourth rank). The main line goes:
: 1. Rf5
(Instead of 1.Rf4!)
: 1... Rc1
: 2. Ke7
Threatening to promote the pawn, Black can just delay it with checks.
: 2... Re1+
: 3. Kd6 Rd1+
: 4. Rd5
and the pawn will promote. Or
: 1... Kg6
: 2. Ke7
Better is 2.Rf8 Kg7 3.Rf4!, back to a bridge on the fourth rank.
: 2... Kxf5!
: 3. d8=Q
and White has a winning (but difficult) queen versus rook endgame (see pawnless chess endgame).
==Alternate plan for the defense==
Alternative approaches are no better for Black. After 1.Rd1+ Ke7 2.Rd4 above, after
: 2... Rb2
for example, White can still carry out his plan as above, or he can win with the simple 
: 3. Ra4 Kd7
: 4. Ka8 (or 4.Ka7) Kc7
: 5. Rc4+
which chases the black king away and allows the pawn to promote. (Or, 5.b8=Q+ Rxb8 6.Rc4+ wins the rook.)

==Rook pawn==

The Lucena method also works with a rook pawn if the white rook is already on the fourth rank, the black rook is not on the file adjacent to the pawn, and White is to move. Otherwise, the defending king must be cut off four files from the pawn, as in the diagram. This is not a true Lucena position since the king is cut off by more than one file. White wins:
: 1. Rc1 Ke7
: 2. Rc8 Kd6!
: 3. Rb8 Ra2
: 4. Kb7 Rb2+
: 5. Kc8 Rc2+
: 6. Kd8 Rh2!
: 7. Rb6+ Kc5
: 8. Rc6+! Kxc6
: 9. a8=Q+
and White has a won queen versus rook endgame – one that is easier to win than one where the rook is close to its king.

==Some exceptions==

Not all similar positions are wins. In this position, Black draws because he can safely check from the side. For this defense to work, there must be at least three files between the defending rook and the attacking king, and the defending king must be positioned such that it does not block the checks; that is, the defending king is on the &quot;short side&quot; of the pawn (the one with fewer files between the pawn and the edge of the board). (See the &quot;short-side defense&quot; at rook and pawn versus rook endgame for more details.)
==Examples from praxis==
;Rice versus Snape

In this 2000 game between Rice and Ian Snape, Black uses the above procedure:
:81... Re7+
:82. Kd2 Re5!
:83. Rg8 Kf2
:84. Rf8+ Kg3
:85. Rg8+ Kf3
Here White deviates from the above:
:86. Kd1 Re4
White resigns, but the alternative is:
:86. Rf8+ Kg4
:87. Rg8+ Rg5
and Black wins.

;Andersson versus Åkesson

In this position from a 1999 game between Ulf Andersson and Ralf Åkesson, White exchanges pawns in order to get to the Lucena position.
: 79. e4! dxe4
: 80. Rxe4 Kd7
: 81. Kg6
and Black resigned. White will reach a Lucena position: 81...Rg1+ 82.Kf7 Rf1 83.f6 Rf2 84.Kg7 Rg2+ 85.Kf8 Rf2 86.f7 Rg2 (a Lucena position) 87.Rd4+ Kc7 (if 87...Ke6 then 88.Ke8 wins) 88.Ke7 Re2+ 89. Kf6 Rf2+ 90.Ke6 Re2+ 91.Kf5 Rf2+ 92.Rf4 and White wins.

<text>The epistemic virtues, as identified by virtue epistemologists, reflect their contention that belief is an ethical process, and thus susceptible to intellectual virtue or vice. Some epistemic virtues have been identified by W. Jay Wood, based on research into the medieval tradition. Epistemic virtues are sometimes also called intellectual virtues.

== Foundations of epistemology ==
The foundation for epistemic virtues is epistemology, the theory of what we know to be true according to our own perception in relation to reality. Philosophers are interested in how the mind relates to reality and the overall nature of knowledge. Epistemology battles with skepticism by trying to come up with a base from which all knowledge and science can be built up. Skepticism promotes an impasse to this because we must doubt what we know in order to know if what we know is indeed true.

== Epistemic virtues and well-being ==
Virtues in general are characteristic habits or ways of relating to the world that exhibit or promote human flourishing. Epistemic virtues are those characteristic habits that promote the acquisition of and utilization of true knowledge.

There is potential tension between these two concepts because learning the truth can sometimes make a person worse off, and so remaining ignorant can arguably be the better option.

==Overview==
Being an epistemically virtuous person is often equated with being a critical thinker and focuses on the human agent and the kind of practices that make it possible to arrive at the best accessible approximation of the truth.

Epistemic virtues include conscientiousness as well as the following:
* attentiveness
* benevolence (principle of charity)
* creativity
* curiosity (see below)
* discernment
* honesty
* humility
* objectivity
* parsimony
* passion (rational)
* studiousness/assiduity
** scrutiny
* understanding
* warranty
* wisdom

These can be contrasted to the &quot;epistemic vices&quot; such as:
* curiosity (see below)
* denial / wishful thinking
* dishonesty
* dogmatism (irrational)
* epistemic blindness
* folly
** gullibility
* hubris
* laziness
* passion (irrational)
* obtuseness
** superficiality of thought
* superstition
* willful naïveté
** anti-intellectualism
** apathy

Note that, in the vice context, &quot;curiosity&quot; bears the medieval connotation of attraction to unwholesome things, in contrast to the positive &quot;studious&quot; (or perhaps &quot;inquisitive&quot;).

<doc id="340882" wikidata="Q7922862" url="?curid=340882" title="Vertical vowel system">
<text>A vertical vowel system is the system of vowels in a language that requires only vowel height to phonemically distinguish vowels. Theoretically, rounding, frontness and backness could also be used in one-dimensional vowel systems; however, &quot;vertical&quot; refers specifically to the usage of vowel height as the sole distinguishing feature.

Vertical vowel systems have only been uncovered in the underlying representation of various languages&#x27; phonology. Phonetically, all known natural languages employ both front and back vowels; however, in a vertical vowel system, the occurrence of front vs. back vowels is predictable, governed by one or more phonological processes.

Two different diachronic mechanisms may give rise to a vertical vowel system. In some cases, the front-back distinction may simply be lost when vowels are merged. This has occurred in Wichita, in which an old vowel (preserved in the related language Pawnee) has merged with . However, the Wichita vowel system is not &quot;phonetically&quot; vertical, as is realised as open back, as open-mid front, and as close to close-mid front; hence, the feature [± back] is relevant to the &quot;phonetics&quot; of the language, even though it is not a salient phonological distinction. Similarly, the vowel is heard in Wichita utterances, although this vowel is usually the phonetic result of a contraction of sequences of [short vowel + w + short vowel], a phenomenon also noted in other languages with vertical vowel systems.

More striking is a phenomenon whereby one or more phonological features of vowels are lost and reassigned to the consonants at the syllable periphery, leaving all vowels underspecified for frontness, rounding, or both. This has occurred in Arrernte, in which vowel rounding has been lost and consonantal labialisation gained as a result. All members of the Northwest Caucasian family have reassigned both rounding and frontness to the syllable periphery, the former surfacing as consonantal labialisation, and the latter as palatalisation. This has also occurred in Marshallese. Some argue that the short vowels of Irish have similarly lost their frontness specification, forming a rudimentary vertical system. However, almost all Irish consonants appear in palatalised and non-palatalised forms, so the loss of frontness specification is viewed as a consequence, rather than a cause, of consonant palatalisation. Furthermore, the loss of frontness specification in Irish is limited to the short vowels of the language; the long vowels of Irish retain a front-back distinction. Marshallese also has front-back distinction for its long vowels, but these are phonemically sequences of where is a semiconsonant; for example, &quot;&quot; &quot;rose&quot; is broadly , but more narrowly .

&quot;Zero&quot;-dimensional vowel systems, with one phonemic vowel only, have been postulated for Nuxálk, Kabardian, and some Abkhaz dialects, as well as several Central Chadic languages such as Moloko. A phonological analysis with no phonemic vowels at all has been shown to be possible for Mofu-Gudur.

Vertical vowel systems been noted for the following languages:

* Northwest Caucasian
** Abkhaz (two degrees)
** Adyghe (three degrees)
** Kabardian (two, perhaps three degrees)
** Ubykh (two, perhaps three degrees)
* Caddoan
** Wichita (three degrees)
*Pama-Nyungan
**Arrernte (two degrees)
* Austronesian
** Marshallese (four degrees)
* Sepik–Ramu languages
* Goidelic
** Irish (three degrees for short vowels &quot;only&quot;)
* Sinitic
** Mandarin Chinese (two degrees, according to some analyses)

Kazakh, Mongolian and Tundra Nenets have vowel systems resembling a vertical vowel system in that backness is not phonemic; however, they are not one-dimensional. Backness has in Kazakh and Mongolian been reinterpreted as advanced tongue root, while in Tundra Nenets backness is determined according to the palatalization of adjacent consonants. Vowels are otherwise distinguished, in addition to height, by diphthongization and, in Kazakh and Tundra Nenets, rounding.

==Vowel prosody system==

Complex interaction between a vertical vowel system and vowel harmony, known as a vowel prosody system, appears in many of the Central Chadic languages. One of the best known cases is Margi, but the phenomenon has been documented in more than thirty languages of the group altogether, including all or most languages of five geographically adjacent subgroups:
* Daba group: Buwal, Daba, Mbudum, Mina
* Hurza group: Mbuko, Vame
* Musgum group: Mbara, Muskum
* Mafa group: Cuvok, Mafa
* Mofu group: Dugwor, Gemzek, Mada, Merey, Mofu-Gudur, Moloko, Muyang, Ouldeme, Zulgo
Further examples of the system of the appear in e.g. Gidar and Podoko.

A typical feature for these languages is that vowel frontness or roundedness cannot be considered a segmental feature but is instead a suprasegmental feature, spanning an entire morpheme or phonological word. All Central Chadic languages allow frontness as a prosody and therefore contrast minimal pairs such as vs. ; only some allow roundedness as a prosody, and in others, rounded vowels are found only next to labialized velar consonants.

<doc id="340883" wikidata="Q932859" url="?curid=340883" title="To His Coy Mistress">
<text>&quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot; is a metaphysical poem written by the English author and politician Andrew Marvell (1621–1678) either during or just before the English Interregnum (1649–60). It was published posthumously in 1681.

This poem is considered one of Marvell&#x27;s finest and is possibly the best recognised carpe diem poem in English. Although the date of its composition is not known, it may have been written in the early 1650s. At that time, Marvell was serving as a tutor to the daughter of the retired commander of the New Model Army, Sir Thomas Fairfax.

==Synopsis==
The speaker of the poem starts by addressing a woman who has been slow to respond to his romantic advances. In the first stanza he describes how he would pay court to her if he were to be unencumbered by the constraints of a normal lifespan. He could spend centuries admiring each part of her body and her resistance to his advances (i.e., coyness) would not discourage him. In the second stanza, he laments how short human life is. Once life is over, the speaker contends, the opportunity to enjoy one another is gone, as no one embraces in death. In the last stanza, the speaker urges the woman to requite his efforts, and argues that in loving one another with passion they will both make the most of the brief time they have to live.

==Structure==

The poem is written in iambic tetrameter and rhymes in couplets. The first verse paragraph (&quot;Had we...&quot;) is ten couplets long, the second (&quot;But...&quot;) six, and the third (&quot;Now therefore...&quot;) seven.
The logical form of the poem runs: if... but... therefore...

==Critical reception and themes==

Until recently, &quot;To His Coy Mistress&quot; had been received by many as a poem that follows the traditional conventions of carpe diem love poetry. Some modern critics, however, argue Marvell&#x27;s use of complex and ambiguous metaphors challenges the perceived notions of the poem. It as well raises suspicion of irony and deludes the reader with its inappropriate and jarring imagery.

Some critics believe the poem is an ironic statement on sexual seduction. They reject the idea that Marvell&#x27;s poem carries a serious and solemn mood. Rather, the poem&#x27;s opening lines—&quot;Had we but world enough, and time/ This coyness, Lady, were no crime&quot;—seems to suggest quite a whimsical tone of regret. In the second part of the poem, there is a sudden transition into imagery that involves graves, marble vaults and worms. The narrator&#x27;s use of such metaphors to depict a realistic and harsh death that awaits the lovers seems to be a way of shocking the lady into submission. Critics have also noted the narrator&#x27;s sense of urgency in the poem&#x27;s third section, especially the alarming comparison of the lovers to &quot;amorous birds of prey&quot;.

==Allusions in other works==
At least two poets have taken up the challenge of responding to Marvell&#x27;s poem in the character of the lady so addressed. Annie Finch&#x27;s &quot;Coy Mistress&quot; suggests that poetry is a more fitting use of their time than lovemaking, while A.D. Hope&#x27;s &quot;His Coy Mistress to Mr. Marvell&quot; turns down the offered seduction outright.

Many authors have borrowed the phrase &quot;World enough and time&quot; from the poem&#x27;s opening line to use in their book titles. The most famous is Robert Penn Warren&#x27;s 1950 novel &quot;World Enough and Time: A Romantic Novel,&quot; about murder in early-19th-century Kentucky. With variations, it has also been used for books on the philosophy of physics (&quot;World Enough and Space-Time: Absolute versus Relational Theories of Space and Time&quot;), geopolitics (&quot;World Enough and Time: Successful Strategies for Resource Management&quot;), a science-fiction collection (&quot;Worlds Enough &amp; Time: Five Tales of Speculative Fiction&quot;), and a biography of the poet (&quot;World Enough and Time: The Life of Andrew Marvell&quot;). The phrase is used as a title chapter in Andreas Wagner&#x27;s pop science book on the origin of variation in organisms, &quot;Arrival of the Fittest&quot;. The verse serves as an epigraph to &quot;&quot;, literary critic Erich Auerbach&#x27;s most famous book. It is also the title of an episode of Big Finish Productions&#x27;s &quot;The Diary of River Song&quot; series 2, and of part 1 of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;″s Series 10 finale. It is the title of a &quot;Star Trek New Voyages&quot; fan episode where George Takei reprises his role as Sulu after being lost in a rift in time. The title of Robert A. Heinlein&#x27;s 1973 novel &quot;Time Enough for Love&quot; also echoes this line.

Also in the field of science fiction, Ursula K. Le Guin wrote a Hugo-nominated short story whose title, &quot;Vaster than Empires and More Slow&quot;, is taken from the poem. Ian Watson notes the debt of this story to Marvell, &quot;whose complex and allusive poems are of a later form of pastoral to that which I shall refer, and, like Marvell, Le Guin&#x27;s nature references are, as I want to argue, &quot;pastoral&quot; in a much more fundamental and interesting way than this simplistic use of the term.&quot; There are other allusions to the poem in the field of Fantasy and Science Fiction: the first book of James Kahn&#x27;s &quot;New World Series&quot; is titled &quot;World Enough, and Time&quot;; the third book of Joe Haldeman&#x27;s &quot;Worlds&quot; trilogy is titled &quot;Worlds Enough and Time&quot;; and Peter S. Beagle&#x27;s novel &quot;A Fine and Private Place&quot; about a love affair between two ghosts in a graveyard. The latter phrase has been widely used as a euphemism for the grave, and has formed the title of several mystery novels.

Brian Aldiss&#x27;s novel &quot;Hothouse&quot;, set in a distant future in which the earth is dominated by plant life, opens with &quot;My vegetable love should grow / vaster than empires, and more slow.&quot;

Terry Pratchett opens his poem An Ode to Multiple Universes with &quot;I do have worlds enough and time / to spare an hour to find a rhyme / to take a week to pen an article / a day to find a rhyme for ‘particle’.&quot;

The phrase &quot;there will be time&quot; occurs repeatedly in a section of T. S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock&quot; (1915), and is often said to be an allusion to Marvell&#x27;s poem. Prufrock says that there will be time &quot;for the yellow smoke that slides along the street&quot;, time &quot;to murder and create&quot;, and time &quot;for a hundred indecisions ... Before the taking of a toast and tea&quot;. As Eliot&#x27;s hero is, in fact, putting off romance and consummation, he is (falsely) answering Marvell&#x27;s speaker. Eliot also alludes to the lines near the end of Marvell&#x27;s poem, &quot;Let us roll all our strength and all / Our sweetness up into one ball&quot;, with his lines, &quot;To have squeezed the universe into a ball / To roll it toward some overwhelming question,&quot; as Prufrock questions whether or not such an act of daring would have been worth it. Eliot returns to Marvell in &quot;The Waste Land&quot; with the lines &quot;But at my back in a cold blast I hear / The rattle of the bones&quot; (Part III, line 185) and &quot;But at my back from time to time I hear / The sound of horns and motors&quot; (Part III, line 196).

The line &quot;deserts of vast eternity&quot; is used in the novel &quot;&quot;, by Virginia Woolf, which was published in 1928.

Archibald MacLeish&#x27;s poem &quot;&quot;, alludes to the passage of time and to the growth and decline of empires. In his poem, the speaker, lying on the ground at sunset, feels &quot;the rising of the night&quot;. He visualizes sunset, moving from east to west geographically, overtaking the great civilizations of the past, and feels &quot;how swift how secretly / The shadow of the night comes on.&quot;

B. F. Skinner quotes &quot;But at my back I always hear / Time&#x27;s wingèd chariot hurrying near&quot;, through his character Professor Burris in &quot;Walden Two&quot;, who is in a confused mood of desperation, lack of orientation, irresolution and indecision. (Prentice Hall 1976, Chapter 31, p. 266). This line is also quoted in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novel &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot;, as in Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Ultimate Melody&quot;.

The same line appears in full in the opening minutes of Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&#x27;s &quot;A Matter of Life and Death&quot; (1946), spoken by the protagonist, pilot and poet Peter Carter: &#x27;But at my back I always hear / Time&#x27;s wingéd chariot hurrying near; And yonder all before us lie / Deserts of vast eternity. Andy Marvell, What a marvel&#x27;.

Primo Levi roughly quotes Marvell in his 1983 poem &quot;The Mouse,&quot; which describes the artistic and existential pressures of the awareness that time is finite. He expresses annoyance at the sentiment to seize the day, stating, &quot;And at my back it seems to hear / Some winged curved chariot hurrying near. / What impudence! What conceit! / I really was fed up.&quot;

The line &quot;A fine and private place, but none, I think, do there embrace&quot; appears in Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;.

One of the Flavia de Luce novels by Alan Bradley is titled “the Grave’s a Fine and Private Place”.

The line &quot;My vegetable love should grow / Vaster than empires, and more slow&quot; is quoted by William S. Burroughs in the last entry of his diary (July 29, 1997). It is also used as the lyrics in the first track of the 2024 film &quot;Queer&quot;, based on the book by Burroughs; the song was composed by Trent Reznor, Atticus Ross, and Caetano Veloso.

The song &quot;Am I alone and unobserved?&quot; in the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta Patience contains the line, &quot;If he&#x27;s content with a vegetable love that would certainly not suit me...&quot; in reference to the aesthete protagonist affecting to prefer the company of flowers to that of women.

The poem, along with Marvell&#x27;s &#x27;The Definition of Love&#x27;, is heavily referenced throughout the 1997 film &quot;The Daytrippers&quot;, in which the main character finds a note she believes may be from her husband&#x27;s mistress. In several scenes, the two Marvell poems are alluded to, quoted, and sometimes directly discussed.

The line &quot;I would Love you ten years before the Flood, And you should, if you please, refuse Till the conversion of the Jews. My vegetable love should grow Vaster than empires, and more slow.&quot; Is used as the preamble to part three of Greg Bear&#x27;s Nebula award winning novel &quot;Moving Mars&quot;.

In &quot;The Time Traveler&#x27;s Wife&quot;, by Audrey Niffenegger, one of the main characters, Henry, recites the line &quot;To world enough, and time,&quot; at several crucial points in the story.

&quot;Le char ailé du Temps&quot; (Time&#x27;s winged chariot) is the French translation (by Bernard Sigaud, 2013) of a short story by Nina Allan (2009), whose original title is just &quot;Time&#x27;s Chariot&quot;.

Brian quotes the line &quot;Had we but world enough, and time&quot; in season 5 episode 5 of &quot;Queer as Folk&quot;.

&quot;World and Time Enough&quot; is a 1994 independent gay-themed romantic comedy-drama written and directed by Eric Mueller.

In Frasier (season 10, episode 9), Niles, who has recently had heart surgery, says: &quot;Good health is not a competition. When you&#x27;ve heard time&#x27;s winged chariot hurrying near, as I have, every day is a gift.&quot;

<text>Southern New England Telecommunications Corporation (SNET) started operations in 1986 as the holding company for the Southern New England Telephone Company, the dominant local phone carrier in Connecticut, which had been a minority holding of AT&amp;T until February 1986, when AT&amp;T sold its 23% ownership. SNET then became its own company, operating a telecommunications sales division, Sonecor Systems Division, which began operations on January 1, 1983, and sold equipment in competition with AT&amp;T before the Bell System divestiture. SNET also operated SNET America, which sold long-distance services to Southern New England Telephone customers within Connecticut.

Under threats of a hostile takeover, Southern New England Telephone underwent a restructuring in 1986, creating Southern New England Telecommunications as the holding company of SNET and its related businesses.

Southern New England Telecommunications was acquired by SBC Communications in 1998.

SNET Corporation was merged into AT&amp;T Teleholdings, formerly Ameritech, in 2006 and ceased to exist.

==Sale of former assets==
On December 17, 2013, AT&amp;T announced plans to sell the former subsidiaries of SNET, The Southern New England Telephone Company and long-distance subsidiary SNET America, to Frontier Communications for $2 billion. The transaction closed on October 25, 2014.

<doc id="340898" wikidata="Q712462" url="?curid=340898" title="Wilfrid Sellars">
<text>Wilfrid Stalker Sellars (; May 20, 1912 – July 2, 1989) was an American philosopher and prominent developer of critical realism, who &quot;revolutionized both the content and the method of philosophy in the United States&quot;.

==Life and career==
His father was the Canadian-American philosopher Roy Wood Sellars, a leading American philosophical naturalist in the first half of the twentieth-century. Wilfrid was educated at the University of Michigan (BA, 1933), the University at Buffalo, and Oriel College, Oxford (1934–1937), where he was a Rhodes Scholar, obtaining his highest earned degree, an MA, in 1940. During World War II, he served in military intelligence. He then taught at the University of Iowa (1938–1946), the University of Minnesota (1947–1958), Yale University (1958–1963), and from 1963 until his death, at the University of Pittsburgh. He served as president of the Metaphysical Society of America in 1977. He was a founder of the journal &quot;Philosophical Studies&quot;.

Sellars is well known as a critic of foundationalist epistemology—the &quot;Myth of the Given&quot; as he called it. However, his philosophical works are more generally directed toward the ultimate goal of reconciling intuitive ways of describing the world (both those of common sense and traditional philosophy) with a thoroughly naturalist, scientific account of reality. He is widely regarded both for great sophistication of argument and for his assimilation of many and diverse subjects in pursuit of a synoptic vision. Sellars was perhaps the first philosopher to synthesize elements of American pragmatism with elements of British and American analytic philosophy and Austrian and German logical positivism. His work also reflects a sustained engagement with the German tradition of transcendental idealism, most obviously in his book &quot;Science and Metaphysics: Kantian Variations&quot;.

==Philosophical work==
Sellars coined certain now-common idioms in philosophy, such as the &quot;space of reasons&quot;. This idiom refers to two things. It:
# Describes the conceptual and behavioral web of language that humans use to get intelligently around their world,
# Denotes the fact that talk of reasons, epistemic justification, and intention is not the same as, and cannot necessarily be mapped onto, talk of causes and effects in the sense that physical science speaks of them.
Note: (2) corresponds in part to the distinction Sellars makes between the manifest image and the scientific image.

===&quot;Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind&quot;===

Sellars&#x27;s most famous work is &quot;Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind&quot; (1956). In it, he criticizes the view that knowledge of what we perceive can be independent of the conceptual processes which result in perception. He named this &quot;The Myth of the Given,&quot; attributing it to sense-data theories of knowledge.

The work targets several theories at once, especially C. I. Lewis&#x27; Kantian pragmatism and Rudolf Carnap&#x27;s positivism. He draws out &quot;The Myth of Jones,&quot; to defend the possibility of a strict behaviorist world-view. The parable explains how thoughts, intelligent action, and even subjective inner experience can be attributed to people within a scientific model. Sellars used a fictional tribe, the &quot;Ryleans,&quot; since he wanted to address Gilbert Ryle&#x27;s &quot;The Concept of Mind&quot;.

Sellars&#x27;s idea of &quot;myth&quot;, heavily influenced by Ernst Cassirer, is not necessarily negative. He saw it as something that can be useful or otherwise, rather than true or false. He aimed to unite the conceptual behavior of the &quot;space of reasons&quot; with the concept of a subjective sense experience. This was one of his most central goals, which his later work described as Kantian.

===&quot;The Language of Theories&quot;===
In his paper &quot;The Language of Theories“ (1961), Sellars introduces the concept of Kantian empiricism. Kantian empiricism features a distinction between (1) claims whose revision requires abandonment or modification of the system of concepts in terms of which they are framed (i.e., modification of the fallible set of constitutive principles underlying knowledge, otherwise known as framework-relative &quot;a priori&quot; truths) and (2) claims revisable on the basis of observations formulated in terms of a system of concepts which remained fixed throughout.

===&quot;Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man&quot;===
In his &quot;Philosophy and the Scientific Image of Man&quot; (1962), Sellars distinguishes between the &quot;manifest image&quot; and the &quot;scientific image&quot; of the world.

The manifest image includes intentions, thoughts, and appearances. Sellars allows that the manifest image may be refined through &#x27;correlational induction&#x27;, but he rules out appeal to imperceptible entities.

The scientific image describes the world in terms of the theoretical physical sciences. It includes notions such as causality and theories about particles and forces.

The two images sometimes complement one another, and sometimes conflict. For example, the manifest image includes practical or moral claims, whereas the scientific image does not. There is conflict, e.g. where science tells us that apparently solid objects are mostly empty space. Sellars favors a synoptic vision, wherein the scientific image takes ultimate precedence in cases of conflict, at least with respect to empirical descriptions and explanations.

===&quot;Meaning as Functional Classification&quot;===
In &quot;Meaning as Functional Classification&quot; (1974) Sellars elaborated upon a version of functional role semantics that he had previously defended in prior publications. For Sellars, thoughts are analogous to linguistic utterances, and both thoughts and linguistic utterances gain their content through token thoughts or utterances standing in certain relations with other thoughts, stimuli, and responses. 

==Politics==
The son of a socialist, Sellars was involved in left-wing politics. As a student at the University of Michigan, Wilfrid Sellars was one of the founding members of the first North-American cooperative house for university students, which was then called &quot;Michigan Socialist House&quot; (and which was later renamed &quot;Michigan Cooperative House&quot;). He also campaigned for the socialist candidate Norman Thomas of the Socialist Party of America.

==Legacy==
Robert Brandom, his junior colleague at Pittsburgh, named Sellars and Willard Van Orman Quine as the two most profound and important philosophers of their generation. Sellars&#x27;s goal of a synoptic philosophy that unites the everyday and scientific views of reality is the foundation and archetype of what is sometimes called the Pittsburgh School, whose members include Brandom, John McDowell, and John Haugeland. Especially Brandom introduced a Hegelian variety of the Pittsburgh School, often called analytic Hegelianism.

Other philosophers strongly influenced by Sellars span the full spectrum of contemporary English-speaking philosophy, from neopragmatism (Richard Rorty) to eliminative materialism (Paul Churchland) to rationalism (Laurence BonJour). Sellars&#x27;s philosophical heirs also include Ruth Millikan, Daniel Dennett, Héctor-Neri Castañeda, Bruce Aune, Jay Rosenberg, Johanna Seibt, Matthew Burstein, Ray Brassier, Andrew Chrucky, Jeffrey Sicha, Pedro Amaral, Thomas Vinci, Willem A. de Vries, David Rosenthal, Ken Wilber and Michael Williams. Sellars&#x27;s work has been drawn upon in feminist standpoint theory, for example in the work of Quill Kukla.

Sellars&#x27;s death in 1989 was the result of long-term alcohol use. A collection of essays devoted to &#x27;Sellars and his Legacy&#x27; was published by Oxford University Press in 2016 (James O&#x27;Shea, ed., &quot;Wilfrid Sellars and his Legacy&quot;), with contributions from Brandom, deVries, Kraut, Kukla, Lance, McDowell, Millikan, O&#x27;Shea, Rosenthal, Seibt, and Williams.

<text>Yan&#x27;an is a prefecture-level city in the Shaanbei region of Shaanxi province, China, bordering Shanxi to the east and Gansu to the west. It administers several counties, including Zhidan (formerly Bao&#x27;an), which served as the headquarters of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) before the city of Yan&#x27;an proper took that role.

Yan&#x27;an was near the endpoint of the Long March, and became the center of the Chinese Communist Revolution from late 1935 to early 1947. Chinese communists celebrate Yan&#x27;an as the birthplace of the revolution.

As of 2019, Yan&#x27;an has approximately 2,255,700 permanent residents.

==History==

Yan&#x27;an was populated at least as early as the Xia dynasty. During the Spring and Autumn period, the area was inhabited by the Beidi people. During the Western Wei the area was organized as . Under the Sui dynasty, the area was re-organized as , and a military base was established. The area became an important defensive outpost for the subsequent Tang dynasty, which renamed the area Yanzhou in 758 CE. Yanzhou was a location of strategic military importance for the Chinese empire and Tanguts of the Western Xia dynasty. It was once successfully defended by the Song dynasty era Chinese scientist, statesman, and general Shen Kuo. However, it was eventually taken over by the Tanguts in 1082 once Shen&#x27;s defensive victories were marginalized and sacrificed by the new chancellor Cai Que (who handed the city over to the Tanguts as terms of a peace treaty). In 1089, under the Song dynasty, Yanzhou was renamed to Yan&#x27;an, and was promoted to a fu (). Yan&#x27;an and the whole of Shaanxi were taken over by the Mongols in the late 1220s, only after their leader Genghis Khan had died during the siege of the Western Xia capital in 1227.

The demographic impacts of this was felt for decades, as the local economy cratered, and insufficient government support hindered recovery efforts: In 1823, Bao&#x27;an (present-day Zhidan County) had a population of 51,000, but only 170 remained in 1868; while Yan&#x27;an (present-day Baota District) had 61,200 inhabitants in 1823, but only about 10,000 in 1930. One account from a British traveler in 1911 described Yan&#x27;an as &quot;a city of pretentious Government Offices long fallen into decay...Gazing down a vista of dim distant years one caught a glimpse of past splendour; but the living forces of which it had been the drapery and symbols had long since died out, leaving stagnation, corruption and decay to reign in its halls&quot;.

After the fall of the Qing dynasty, the city became part of the newly created Republic of China, and was reorganized by the Republican government in 1913 under .

Throughout the Republic of China, feudal-like landlordism persisted in Yan&#x27;an, and a number of observers found it to be worse in the region than elsewhere in rural China.

===Red Capital and the Chinese Civil War===

In 1934, two regional soviets were established. In October 1935, following the Long March, forces of the Chinese Red Army arrived in the area from Jiangxi. The following month, communist forces established a regional government in Wayaobu and re-organized regional soviet administrations. In May 1936, the area was re-organized by communist forces as Shaan-Gan-Ning Province (). In December 1936, at the start of the Second United Front, Yan&#x27;an was taken over by the Chinese Communists. When Edgar Snow went there in 1936, it was under Kuomintang control and a Red army siege had recently been lifted. Unknown to him at the time, there had also been contacts there between the Communists and the generals who later staged the Xi&#x27;an Incident. Snow actually met Mao at Bao&#x27;an (Pao An).

Having rebelled against Chiang, the local warlords decided to hand over Yan&#x27;an to the Communists, who were now allies. They pulled out, and in January 1937, the Red Army entered Yan&#x27;an, without a fight. This is described by Agnes Smedley in her book Battle Hymn of China. She was in Xi&#x27;an at the time and got to Yan&#x27;an shortly after the take-over.

On September 6, 1937, Yan&#x27;an became the seat of the communist government of what became known as the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region. It became the center for intensive training of party members and army troops. Thousands of intellectuals traveled to Yan&#x27;an from all over the country. From 1937 through 1941, the Communist government organized large-scale migrations to Yan&#x27;an, predominantly from Suide to the northeast, which was a significantly more densely populated area. Many farmers from the region were attracted to Yan&#x27;an for the prospect of working more land, as well as the Communists&#x27; land and tax reforms. From 1937 to 1939, over 1,500,000 &quot;mu&quot; of previously unused land was cleared for agriculture. During this time, the large drive for intense rural labor earned its detractors, and was publicly criticized by some for &quot;giving people a distaste for collective labour&quot;. Subsequently, these types of large-scale labor projects would be handled by the army. In 1941, Mao Zedong put special influence on a series of training programs to &quot;correct unorthodox tendencies&quot; and essentially mold the peasantry to the communist model. One of the first CCP programs launched was the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement. 
===World War II and resumption of the Chinese Civil War===
During the Second World War almost all buildings, except a pagoda, were destroyed by Japanese bombing, and most inhabitants took to living in yaodongs, artificial caves or dugouts carved into hillsides which were traditional dwellings in Shaanxi. While Yan&#x27;an was the center of Chinese communist life many prominent Western journalists including Edgar Snow and Anna Louise Strong met with Mao Zedong and other important leaders for interviews. Other Westerners, such as Hsiao Li and Michael Lindsay, were part of the resistance movement in Yan&#x27;an.

Beginning in 1944, Yan&#x27;an played host to the United States Army Observation Group, also known as the Dixie Mission. This group sought to establish relations with Chinese Communist forces, investigate the Communist Party politically and militarily, and determine whether the United States should back Communist forces. Prominent Americans tasked with evaluating the Communist forces politically and militarily include John S. Service of the United States Department of State, and Colonel David D. Barrett of the United States Army. The mission explored possible plans for cooperation against the Japanese. The Americans had a presence in Yan&#x27;an from 1944 to 1947.

Yan&#x27;an was briefly captured in the Battle of Yan&#x27;an by the Kuomintang forces in the Chinese Civil War. The Communist leadership learned of a planned attack in advance and decided to pull out. From then until their capture of Beijing they were usually based somewhere else, often with a mobile headquarters.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
In May 1950, under the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Yan&#x27;an was re-organized as Yan&#x27;an District, and was further re-organized as a special district () in October. Yan&#x27;an was later established as an area ().

On November 5, 1996, Yan&#x27;an Area was revoked and established as a prefecture-level city.

Yan&#x27;an&#x27;s experienced fast-paced urbanization during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan period (2006–2010). From 2011 to 2015, it underwent a red tourism-oriented beautification project.

Xi Jinping visited Yan&#x27;an in 2015. During the visit, he emphasized the importance of studying the Communist Party&#x27;s history in Yan&#x27;an and called for a renewed focus on the principles of Marxism–Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and the party&#x27;s revolutionary tradition.

==Geography and climate==

Yan&#x27;an is located in northern Shaanxi on the Loess Plateau, with a latitude spanning from 35°21′ to 37°31′ N, and a longitude spanning from 107°41′ to 110°31′ E. The city is bordered by Yulin to the north, Xianyang, Tongchuan, and Weinan in the Guanzhong region to the south, Linfen and Lüliang of Shanxi to the east across the Yellow River, and Qingyang of Gansu to the west across the Ziwu Ridge (). The city&#x27;s elevation is hilly, and is higher in the northwest, and lower in the southeast, ranging from above sea level in elevation. The average elevation of Yan&#x27;an is approximately , and Yan&#x27;an&#x27;s urban core has an elevation of about above sea level. In addition to the Yellow River flowing through Yan&#x27;an, the city&#x27;s major rivers include the Yan River and the Luo River.

Yan&#x27;an City is located in the middle reaches of the Yellow River and belongs to the hilly and ravine area of the Loess Plateau. The terrain is high in the northwest and low in the southeast, with an average altitude of about 1,200 meters.

 Yan&#x27;an has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Dwa&quot;) that borders on a steppe climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), with cold, dry, and moderately long winters, and hot, somewhat humid summers. Spring and autumn are short transition seasons in between. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . The area receives of precipitation, 47% of which falls in July and August. Yan&#x27;an averages around 300 days of sunshine per year.

== Administrative divisions ==
== Demographics ==
As of 2019, Yan&#x27;an has approximately 2,255,700 permanent residents, a slight decrease from the 2,259,400 recorded in 2018. As of 2019, there are 2,336,587 people with a Yan&#x27;an hukou registration. This discrepancy reflects China&#x27;s system of internal migration, as many hukou holders in more rural areas migrate to larger and more developed cities.

Approximately 674,700 people lived in Yan&#x27;an&#x27;s two districts (Baota and Ansai) as of 2019.

=== Vital statistics ===

<text>On the Road is a 1957 novel by American writer Jack Kerouac, based on the travels of Kerouac and his friends across the United States. It is considered a defining work of the postwar Beat and Counterculture generations, with its protagonists living life against a backdrop of jazz, poetry, and drug use. The novel is a &quot;roman à clef&quot;, with many key figures of the Beat movement represented by characters in the book, including Kerouac, himself, as the narrator, Sal Paradise. The idea for the book formed during the late 1940s in a series of notebooks and was then typed out, on a continuous reel of paper, during three weeks in April 1951. It was first published by Viking Press.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; hailed the book&#x27;s appearance as &quot;the most beautifully executed, the clearest, and the most important utterance yet made by the generation Kerouac, himself, named years ago as &#x27;beat,&#x27; and whose principal avatar he is.&quot; In 1998, the Modern Library ranked &quot;On the Road&quot; 55th on its list of the 100 best English-language novels of the 20th century. The novel was chosen by &quot;Time&quot; magazine as one of the 100 best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005.

==Plot==
The two main characters of the book are the narrator, Sal Paradise, and his friend Dean Moriarty, much admired for his carefree attitude and sense of adventure, a free-spirited maverick eager to explore all kicks and an inspiration and catalyst for Sal&#x27;s travels. The novel contains five parts, three of them describing road trips with Dean. The narrative takes place in the years 1947 to 1950, is full of Americana, and marks a specific era in jazz history, &quot;somewhere between its Charlie Parker &quot;Ornithology&quot; period and another period that began with Miles Davis&quot; (Pt. 1, Ch. 3). The novel is largely autobiographical, Sal being the alter ego of the author and Dean standing for Neal Cassady. Like Kerouac, Sal Paradise is a writer who published two books over the course of the plot, even though the names are not told.

===Part One===
The first section describes Sal&#x27;s first trip to San Francisco. Disheartened after a divorce, his life changes when he meets Dean Moriarty, who is &quot;tremendously excited with life&quot;, and begins to long for the freedom of the road: &quot;Somewhere along the line I knew there would be girls, visions, everything; somewhere along the line the pearl would be handed to me&quot;. In July 1947, he sets off from his aunt&#x27;s house in Paterson with $50 () in his pocket. After taking several buses and hitchhiking, he arrives in Denver, where he meets up with Carlo Marx, Dean, and their friends. There are parties—among them an excursion to the ghost town of Central City. Eventually Sal leaves by bus and gets to San Francisco, where he meets Remi Boncoeur and his girlfriend Lee Ann. Remi arranges for Sal to take a job as a night watchman at a boarding camp for merchant sailors waiting for their ship. Not holding this job for long, Sal hits the road again. &quot;Oh, where is the girl I love?&quot; he wonders. Soon he meets Terry, the &quot;cutest little Mexican girl&quot;, on the bus to Los Angeles. They stay together, traveling back to Bakersfield, then to Sabinal, &quot;her hometown&quot;, where her family works in the fields. He meets Terry&#x27;s brother Ricky, who teaches him the true meaning of &quot;mañana&quot; (&quot;tomorrow&quot;). Working in the cotton fields, Sal realizes that he is not made for this type of work. Leaving Terry behind, he takes a bus back east to Pittsburgh, and then hitchhikes his way to Times Square in New York City. Once there he bums a quarter off a preacher who looks the other way, and arrives at his aunt&#x27;s house, just missing Dean, who had come to see him, by two days.

===Part Two===
In December 1948, Sal is celebrating Christmas with his relatives in Testament, Virginia, when Dean shows up with Marylou (having left his second wife, Camille, and their newborn baby, Amy, in San Francisco) and Ed Dunkel. Sal&#x27;s Christmas plans are shattered as &quot;now the bug was on me again, and the bug&#x27;s name was Dean Moriarty.&quot; First they drive to New York, where they meet Carlo and party. Dean wants Sal to make love to Marylou, but Sal declines. In Dean&#x27;s Hudson, they take off from New York in January 1949 and make it to New Orleans. In Algiers, they stay with the morphine-addicted Old Bull Lee and his wife, Jane. Galatea Dunkel joins her husband in New Orleans while Sal, Dean, and Marylou continue their trip. Once in San Francisco, Dean again leaves Marylou to be with Camille. &quot;Dean will leave you out in the cold anytime it is in the interest of him,&quot; Marylou tells Sal. Both of them stay briefly in a hotel, but soon she moves out, following a nightclub owner. Sal is alone and on Market Street has visions of past lives, birth, and rebirth. Dean finds him and invites him to stay with his family. Together, they visit nightclubs and listen to Slim Gaillard and other jazz musicians. The stay ends on a sour note: &quot;what I accomplished by coming to Frisco I don&#x27;t know,&quot; and Sal departs, taking the bus back to New York.

===Part Three===
In the spring of 1949, Sal takes a bus from New York to Denver. He is depressed and lonesome; none of his friends are around. After receiving some money, he leaves Denver for San Francisco to see Dean. Camille is pregnant and unhappy, and Dean has injured his thumb trying to hit Marylou for sleeping with other men. Camille throws them out, and Sal invites Dean to come to New York, planning to travel further to Italy. They meet Galatea, who tells Dean off: &quot;You have absolutely no regard for anybody but yourself and your kicks.&quot; Sal realizes she is right—Dean is the &quot;HOLY GOOF&quot;—but also defends him, as &quot;he&#x27;s got the secret that we&#x27;re all busting to find out&quot;. After a night of jazz and drinking in Little Harlem on Folsom Street, they depart. On the way to Sacramento they meet a &quot;fag&quot;, who propositions them. Dean tries to hustle some money out of this but is turned down. During this part of the trip Sal and Dean have ecstatic discussions having found &quot;IT&quot; and &quot;TIME&quot;. In Denver a brief argument shows the growing rift between the two, when Dean reminds Sal of his age, Sal being the older of the two. They get a 1947 Cadillac that needs to be taken to Chicago from a travel bureau. Dean drives most of the way, crazy, careless, often speeding at over , delivering the car in a disheveled state. By bus they move on to Detroit and spend a night on Skid Row, Dean hoping to find his homeless father. From Detroit they share a ride to New York and arrive at Sal&#x27;s aunt&#x27;s new flat in Long Island. They go on partying in New York, where Dean meets Inez and gets her pregnant while his wife is expecting their second child.

===Part Four===
In the spring of 1950, Sal gets the itch to travel again while Dean is working as a parking lot attendant in Manhattan, living with his girlfriend Inez. Sal notices that he has been reduced to simple pleasures—listening to basketball games and looking at erotic playing cards. By bus Sal takes to the road again, passing Washington, D.C., Ashland, Cincinnati, and St. Louis, and eventually reaching Denver. There he meets Stan Shephard, and the two plan to go to Mexico City when they learn that Dean has bought a car and is on the way to join them. In a rickety &#x27;37 Ford sedan the three set off across Texas to Laredo, where they cross the border. They are ecstatic, having left &quot;everything behind us and entering a new and unknown phase of things&quot;. Their money buys more (10 cents for a beer), police are laid back, cannabis is readily available, and people are curious and friendly. The landscape is magnificent. In Gregoria, they meet Victor, a local kid, who leads them to a bordello where they have their last grand party, dancing to mambo, drinking, and having fun with prostitutes. In Mexico City, Sal becomes ill from dysentery and is &quot;delirious and unconscious.&quot; Dean leaves him, and Sal later reflects: &quot;When I got better I realized what a rat he was, but then I had to understand the impossible complexity of his life, how he had to leave me there, sick, to get on with his wives and woes.&quot;

===Part Five===
Dean, having obtained divorce papers in Mexico, had first returned to New York to marry Inez, only to leave her and go back to Camille. After his recovery from dysentery in Mexico, Sal returns to New York in the fall. He finds a girl, Laura, and plans to move with her to San Francisco. Sal writes to Dean about his plan to move to San Francisco. Dean writes back saying that he&#x27;s willing to come and accompany Laura and Sal. Dean arrives more than five weeks early, but Sal is out taking a late-night walk alone. Sal returns home, sees a copy of Proust, and knows it is Dean&#x27;s. Sal realizes his friend has arrived, but at a time when Sal doesn&#x27;t have the money to relocate to San Francisco. On hearing this Dean makes the decision to head back to Camille, Sal&#x27;s friend Remi Boncoeur denies Sal&#x27;s request to give Dean a short lift to 40th Street on their way to a Duke Ellington concert at the Metropolitan Opera House. Sal&#x27;s girlfriend Laura realizes this is a painful moment for Sal and prompts him for a response as the party drives off without Dean. Sal replies: &quot;He&#x27;ll be alright&quot;. Sal later reflects as he sits on a river pier under a New Jersey night sky about the roads and lands of America that he has travelled and states: &quot;... I think of Dean Moriarty, I even think of Old Dean Moriarty the father we never found, I think of Dean Moriarty.&quot;

==Characters==

Kerouac often based his fictional characters on friends and family.

==Production and publication==
After Kerouac dropped out of Columbia University, he served as a Merchant Marine on several different sailing vessels, before returning to New York to write. He met and mixed with Beat Generation figures Allen Ginsberg, William Burroughs, and Neal Cassady. Between 1947 and 1950, while writing what would become &quot;The Town and the City&quot; (1950), Kerouac engaged in the road adventures that would form &quot;On the Road&quot;. Kerouac carried small notebooks, in which much of the text was written as the eventful span of road trips unfurled. He started working on the first of several versions of the novel as early as 1948, based on experiences during his first long road trip in 1947, but he remained dissatisfied with the novel. Inspired by a 10,000-word rambling letter from his friend, Neal Cassady, Kerouac, in 1950, outlined the &quot;Essentials of Spontaneous Prose&quot; and decided to tell the story of his years on the road with Cassady, as if writing a letter to a friend in a form that reflected the improvisational fluidity of jazz. In a letter to a student in 1961, Kerouac wrote: &quot;Dean and I were embarked on a journey through post-Whitman America to FIND that America and to FIND the inherent goodness in American man. It was really a story about two Catholic buddies, roaming the country, in search of God. And we found him.&quot;

The first draft of what was to become the published novel was written in three weeks in April 1951, while Kerouac lived with Joan Haverty, his second wife, at 454 West 20th Street in New York City&#x27;s Manhattan. The manuscript was typed on what he called &quot;the scroll&quot;—a continuous, scroll of tracing paper sheets that he cut to size and taped together. The roll was typed single-spaced, without margins or paragraph breaks. In the following years, Kerouac continued to revise this manuscript, deleting some sections (including some sexual depictions deemed pornographic in the 1950s) and adding smaller literary passages. Kerouac wrote a number of inserts intended for &quot;On the Road&quot; between 1951 and 1952, before eventually omitting them from the manuscript and using them to form the basis of another work, &quot;Visions of Cody&quot; (1951–1952). &quot;On the Road&quot; was championed within Viking Press by Malcolm Cowley and was published by Viking in 1957, based on revisions of the 1951 manuscript. Besides differences in formatting, the published novel was shorter than the original scroll manuscript and used pseudonyms for all of the major characters.

Viking Press released a slightly edited version of the original manuscript, titled &quot;On the Road: The Original Scroll&quot; (August 16, 2007), corresponding with the 50th anniversary of original publication. This version has been transcribed and edited by English academic and novelist Howard Cunnell. As well as containing material that was excised from the original draft, due to its explicit nature, the scroll version also uses the real names of the protagonists, so Dean Moriarty becomes Neal Cassady and Carlo Marx becomes Allen Ginsberg, etc.

In 2007, Gabriel Anctil, a journalist of Montreal daily &quot;Le Devoir&quot;, discovered in Kerouac&#x27;s personal archives in New York almost 200 pages of his writings entirely in Quebec French, with colloquialisms. The collection included 10 manuscript pages of an unfinished version of &quot;On the Road&quot;, written on January 19, 1951.

The original scroll of &quot;On the Road&quot; was bought in 2001 by Jim Irsay for $2.43 million (equivalent to $ million in ). It has occasionally been made available for public viewing, with the first 30 feet (9 m) unrolled. Between 2004 and 2012, the scroll was displayed in several museums and libraries in the United States, Ireland, and the UK. It was exhibited in Paris, in the summer of 2012, to celebrate the movie based on the book.

==Reception==

&quot;On the Road&quot; received mixed critical reactions upon its publication in 1957. While some early reviewers of the book spoke favorably of it, the backlash to these reviews was swift and strong. Since its publication, critical attention has focused on issues of both the context and the style, addressing the actions of the characters as well as the nature of Kerouac&#x27;s prose.

===Initial reaction===
In his review for &quot;The New York Times,&quot; Gilbert Millstein wrote, &quot;...its publication is a historic occasion in so far as the exposure of an authentic work of art is of any great moment in an age in which the attention is fragmented and the sensibilities are blunted by the superlatives of fashion&quot; and praised it as &quot;a major novel.&quot; Millstein was already sympathetic toward the Beat Generation and his promotion of the book in the &quot;Times&quot; did wonders for its recognition and acclaim. Not only did he like the themes, but also the style, which would come to be just as hotly contested in the reviews that followed. &quot;There are sections of &quot;On the Road&quot; in which the writing is of a beauty almost breathtaking ... there is some writing on jazz that has never been equaled in American fiction, either for insight, style, or technical virtuosity.&quot; Kerouac and Joyce Johnson, a younger writer he was living with, read the review shortly after midnight at a newsstand at 69th Street and Broadway, near Joyce&#x27;s apartment in the Upper West Side. They took their copy of the newspaper to a neighborhood bar and read the review over and over. &quot;Jack kept shaking his head,&quot; Joyce remembered later in her memoir &quot;Minor Characters&quot;, &quot;as if he couldn&#x27;t figure out why he wasn&#x27;t happier than he was.&quot; Finally, they returned to her apartment to go to sleep. As Joyce recalled: &quot;Jack lay down obscure for the last time in his life. The ringing phone woke him the next morning, and he was famous.&quot;

A backlash began a few days later in the same publication. David Dempsey published a review that contradicted most of what Millstein had promoted in the book. &quot;As a portrait of a disjointed segment of society acting out of its own neurotic necessity, &quot;On the Road&quot;, is a stunning achievement. But it is a road, as far as the characters are concerned, that leads to nowhere&quot;. While he did not discount the stylistic nature of the text (saying that it was written &quot;with great relish&quot;), he dismissed the content as a &quot;passionate lark&quot; rather than a novel.

Other reviewers were also less than impressed. Phoebe Lou Adams in &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot; wrote that it &quot;disappoints because it constantly promises a revelation or a conclusion of real importance and general applicability, and cannot deliver any such conclusion because Dean is more convincing as an eccentric than as a representative of any segment of humanity.&quot; While she liked the writing and found a good theme, her concern was repetition. &quot;Everything Mr. Kerouac has to say about Dean has been told in the first third of the book, and what comes later is a series of variations on the same theme.&quot;

Robert Kirsch in &quot;The Los Angeles Times&quot; said, &quot;Mr. Kerouac may one day be a good writer, but that day will come when he stops riding around in a compulsive search for &quot;material&quot; and settles down to learn some of the first things about the craft...Mr. Kerouac calls this &quot;The Beat Generation,&quot; but a much more accurate description would be &quot;The Deadbeat Generation.&quot; I don&#x27;t know whether such people really exist, but if they do, he has thoroughly failed to make them believable.&quot;

The review from &quot;Time&quot; exhibited a similar sentiment. &quot;The post-World War II generation—beat or beatific—has not found symbolic spokesmen with anywhere near the talents of Fitzgerald, Hemingway, or Nathanael West. In this novel, talented Author Kerouac, 35, does not join that literary league, either, but at least suggests that his generation is not silent. With his barbaric yawp of a book, Kerouac commands attention as a kind of literary James Dean.&quot; It considers the book partly a travel book and partly a collection of journal jottings. While Kerouac sees his characters as &quot;mad to live ... desirous of everything at the same time,&quot; the reviewer likens them to cases of &quot;psychosis that is a variety of Ganser Syndrome&quot; who &quot;aren&#x27;t really mad—they only seem to be.&quot;

===Critical study===
Thomas Pynchon described &quot;On the Road&quot; as &quot;one of the great American novels&quot;.

&quot;On the Road&quot; has been the object of critical study since its publication. David Brooks of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compiled several opinions and summarized them in an Op-Ed from October 2, 2007. Whereas Millstein saw it as a story in which the heroes took pleasure in everything, George Mouratidis, an editor of a new edition, claimed &quot;above all else, the story is about loss&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s a book about death and the search for something meaningful to hold on to—the famous search for &#x27;IT,&#x27; a truth larger than the self, which, of course, is never found,&quot; wrote Meghan O&#x27;Rourke in Slate. &quot;Kerouac was this deep, lonely, melancholy man,&quot; Hilary Holladay of the University of Massachusetts Lowell told &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. &quot;And if you read the book closely, you see that sense of loss and sorrow swelling on every page&quot;. &quot;In truth, &quot;On the Road&quot; is a book of broken dreams and failed plans,&quot; wrote Ted Gioia in &quot;The Weekly Standard&quot;.

John Leland, author of &quot;Why Kerouac Matters: The Lessons of On the Road (They&#x27;re Not What You Think),&quot; said &quot;We&#x27;re no longer shocked by the sex and drugs. The slang is passé and at times corny. Some of the racial sentimentality is appalling&quot; but added &quot;the tale of passionate friendship and the search for revelation are timeless. These are as elusive and precious in our time as in Sal&#x27;s, and will be when our grandchildren celebrate the book&#x27;s hundredth anniversary.&quot;

To Brooks, this characterization seemed limited. &quot;Reading through the anniversary commemorations, you feel the gravitational pull of the great Boomer Narcissus. All cultural artifacts have to be interpreted through whatever experiences the Baby Boomer generation is going through at that moment. So a book formerly known for its youthful exuberance now becomes a gloomy middle-aged disillusion.&quot; He lamented that the book&#x27;s spirit seems to have been tamed by the professionalism of America today and how it has only survived in parts. The more reckless and youthful parts of the text that gave it its energy are the parts that have &quot;run afoul of the new gentility, the rules laid down by the health experts, childcare experts, guidance counselors, safety advisers, admissions officers, virtuecrats and employers to regulate the lives of the young.&quot; He claims that the &quot;ethos&quot; of the book has been lost.

Mary Pannicia Carden saw traveling as a way for the characters to assert their independence: they &quot;attempt to replace the model of manhood dominant in capitalist America with a model rooted in foundational American ideals of conquest and self-discovery.&quot; &quot;Reassigning disempowering elements of patriarchy to female keeping, they attempt to substitute male brotherhood for the nuclear family and to replace the ladder of success with the freedom of the road as primary measures of male identity.&quot;

Kerouac&#x27;s writing style has attracted the attention of critics. &quot;On the Road&quot; has been considered by Tim Hunt to be a transitional phase between the traditional narrative structure of &quot;The Town and the City&quot; (1951) and the &quot;wild form&quot; of his later books like &quot;Visions of Cody&quot; (1972). Kerouac&#x27;s own explanation of his style in &quot;Essentials of Spontaneous Prose&quot; (1953) is that his writing is like the Impressionist painters who sought to create art through direct observation. Matt Theado feels he endeavored to present a raw version of truth which did not lend itself to the traditional process of revision and rewriting but rather the emotionally charged practice of the spontaneity he pursued. Theado argues that the personal nature of the text helps foster a direct link between Kerouac and the reader; that his casual diction and very relaxed syntax was an intentional attempt to depict events as they happened and to convey all of the energy and emotion of the experiences.

==Music in &quot;On the Road&quot;==
Music is an important part of the scene that Kerouac sets in &quot;On the Road&quot;. Early in the book (Pt. 1, Ch. 3), he establishes the time period with references to the musical world: &quot;At this time, 1947, bop was going like mad all over America. The fellows at the Loop blew, but with a tired air, because bop was somewhere between its Charlie Parker Ornithology period and another period that began with Miles Davis. And as I sat there listening to that sound of the night which bop has come to represent for all of us, I thought of all my friends from one end of the country to the other and how they were really all in the same vast backyard doing something so frantic and rushing-about.&quot;

Main characters Sal Paradise and Dean Moriarty are clearly enthusiastic fans of the jazz/bebop and early rhythm-and-blues musicians and records that were in the musical mix during the years when story took place, 1947 to 1950. Sal, Dean, and their friends are repeatedly depicted listening to specific records and going to clubs to hear their musical favorites.

For example, in one of two separate passages where they go to clubs to hear British jazz pianist George Shearing, the effect of the music is described as almost overwhelming for Dean (Pt. 2, Ch. 4): &quot;Shearing began to play his chords; they rolled out of the piano in great rich showers, you&#x27;d think the man wouldn&#x27;t have time to line them up. They rolled and rolled like the sea. Folks yelled for him to &#x27;Go!&#x27; Dean was sweating; the sweat poured down his collar. &#x27;There he is! That&#x27;s him! Old God! Old God Shearing! Yes! Yes! Yes!&#x27; And Shearing was conscious of the madman behind him, he could hear every one of Dean&#x27;s gasps and imprecations, he could sense it though he couldn&#x27;t see. &#x27;That&#x27;s right!&#x27; Dean said. &#x27;Yes!&#x27; Shearing smiled; he rocked. Shearing rose from the piano, dripping with sweat; these were his great 1949 days before he became cool and commercial. When he was gone Dean pointed to the empty piano seat. &#x27;God&#x27;s empty chair,&#x27; he said.&quot;

Kerouac mentions many other musical artists and their records throughout &quot;On the Road&quot;: Charlie Parker – &quot;Ornithology&quot; (Pt. 1, Ch. 3; also Pt. 3, Ch. 10); Lionel Hampton – &quot;Central Avenue Breakdown&quot; (Pt. 1, Ch. 13; also Pt. 4, Ch. 4); Billie Holiday – &quot;Lover Man&quot; (Pt.1, Ch. 13; also Pt. 3, Ch. 4); Dexter Gordon and Wardell Gray – &quot;The Hunt&quot; (Pt. 2, Ch. 1; Pt. 2, Ch. 4); Dizzy Gillespie – &quot;Congo Blues&quot; (Pt. 3, Ch. 7 – recorded under Red Norvo&#x27;s name and also featuring Charlie Parker; also Pt. 3, Ch. 10; Pt. 4, Ch. 3); Willis Jackson – &quot;Gator Tail&quot; (Pt. 4, Ch. 1 – recorded with the Cootie Williams Orchestra); Wynonie Harris – &quot;I Like My Baby&#x27;s Pudding&quot; (Pt. 4, Ch. 4); and Perez Prado -- &quot;More Mambo Jambo,&quot; &quot;Chattanooga de Mambo,&quot; &quot;Mambo Numero Ocho&quot; (&quot;Mambo No. 8&quot;) (Pt. 4, Ch. 5).

Kerouac also notes several other musical artists without mentioning specific records: Miles Davis (Pt. 1, Ch. 3; Pt. 3, Ch. 10); George Shearing and his drummer Denzil Best (Pt. 2, Ch. 4; Pt. 3, Ch. 10); Slim Gaillard (Pt. 2, Ch. 11); Lester Young (Pt. 3, Ch. 10; Pt. 4, Ch. 1); Louis Armstrong (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); Roy Eldridge (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); Count Basie (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); Bennie Moten (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); Hot Lips Page (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); Thelonious Monk (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); Anita O&#x27;Day (Pt. 3, Ch. 10); Stan Getz (Pt. 4, Ch. 1); Lucky Millinder (Pt. 4, Ch. 4); and Duke Ellington (Pt. 5).

Jazz and other types of music are also featured more generally as a backdrop, with the characters often listening to music in clubs or on the radio. For example, while driving across the upper Midwest toward New York City, Sal mentions that he and Dean are listening to the radio show of well-known jazz deejay Symphony Sid Torin (Pt. 3, Ch. 11).

Kerouac also delves into the classical music genre briefly, having Sal attend a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s sole opera, &quot;Fidelio&quot; (1805), in Central City, Colorado, as performed by &quot;stars of the Metropolitan&quot; who are visiting the area for the summer (Pt. 1, Ch. 9).

==Influence==
&quot;On the Road&quot; has been an influence on poets, writers, actors, and musicians–including Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Jim Morrison, Jerry Garcia, David Bowie, Hunter S. Thompson and Matty Healy.

From journalist Sean O&#x27;Hagan, in a 2007 article published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;:

In his book &quot;Light My Fire: My Life with The Doors&quot;, Ray Manzarek (keyboard player of The Doors) wrote, &quot;I suppose if Jack Kerouac had never written &quot;On the Road&quot;, The Doors would never have existed.&quot;

&quot;On the Road&quot; influenced an entire generation of musicians, poets, and writers including Allen Ginsberg. Because of Ginsberg&#x27;s friendship with Kerouac, Ginsberg was written into the novel through the character Carlo Marx. Ginsberg recalled that he was attracted to the beat generation, and Kerouac, because the beats valued &quot;detachment from the existing society,&quot; while at the same time calling for an immediate release from a culture in which the most &quot;freely&quot; accessible items—bodies and ideas—seemed restricted. Ginsberg incorporated a sense of freedom of prose and style into his poetry as a result of the influence of Kerouac.

Eric Kripke, creator of long-running series &quot;Supernatural&quot;, has also cited &quot;On the Road&quot; as a major inspiration for the fantasy series.

==Film adaptation==
A film adaptation of &quot;On the Road&quot; had been proposed in 1957 when Jack Kerouac wrote a one-page letter to actor Marlon Brando, suggesting that he play Dean Moriarty while Kerouac would portray Sal Paradise. Brando never responded to the letter; later Warner Bros. offered $110,000 for the rights to Kerouac&#x27;s book, but his agent, Sterling Lord, declined it, hoping for a $150,000 deal from Paramount Pictures, which did not occur.

The film rights were bought in 1980 by producer Francis Ford Coppola for $95,000. Coppola tried out several screenwriters, including Michael Herr, Barry Gifford, and novelist Russell Banks, even writing a draft himself with his son Roman, before settling on José Rivera. Several different plans were considered: Joel Schumacher as director, with Billy Crudup as Sal Paradise, and Colin Farrell as Dean Moriarty; then Ethan Hawke as Paradise and Brad Pitt as Moriarty; in 1995, he planned to shoot on black-and-white 16mm film and held auditions with poet Allen Ginsberg in attendance, but all those projects fell through.

After seeing Walter Salles&#x27; &quot;The Motorcycle Diaries&quot; (2004), Coppola appointed Salles to direct the movie. In preparation for the film, Salles traveled the United States, tracing Kerouac&#x27;s journey and filming a documentary on the search for &quot;On the Road&quot;. Sam Riley starred as Sal Paradise. Garrett Hedlund portrayed Dean Moriarty. Kristen Stewart played Mary Lou. Kirsten Dunst portrayed Camille. The film screened at the Cannes Film Festival in 2012 and was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or.

In 2007, BBC Four aired &quot;Russell Brand On the Road&quot;, a documentary presented by Russell Brand and Matt Morgan about Kerouac, focusing on &quot;On the Road&quot;. In 2014 a feature documentary by Kurt Jacobsen and Warren Leming entitled &quot;American Road&quot;, which explores the mystique of the road with an ample section on Kerouac, premiered at the American Documentary Film Festival in Palm Springs and then screened at two dozen more film festivals.

==Beat Generation ==
While many critics still consider the word &quot;beat&quot; in its literal sense of &quot;tired and beaten down,&quot; others, including Kerouac himself promoted the generation more in sense of &quot;beatific&quot; or blissful. Holmes and Kerouac published several articles in popular magazines in an attempt to explain the movement. In the November 16, 1952 &quot;New York Times Sunday Magazine&quot;, he wrote a piece exposing the faces of the Beat Generation. &quot;[O]ne day [Kerouac] said, &#x27;You know, this is a really beat generation&#x27; ... More than mere weariness, it implies the feeling of having been used, of being raw. It involves a sort of nakedness of mind, and ultimately, of soul: a feeling of being reduced to the bedrock of consciousness. In short, it means being undramatically pushed up against the wall of oneself.&quot; He distinguishes Beats from the Lost Generation of the 1920s pointing out how the Beats are not lost but how they are searching for answers to all of life&#x27;s questions. Kerouac&#x27;s preoccupation with writers like Ernest Hemingway shaped his view of the beat generation. He uses a prose style which he adapted from Hemingway and throughout &quot;On the Road&quot; he alludes to novels like &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;. &quot;How to live seems much more crucial than why.&quot; In many ways, it is a spiritual journey, a quest to find belief, belonging, and meaning in life. Not content with the uniformity promoted by government and consumer culture, the Beats yearned for a deeper, more sensational experience. Holmes expands his attempt to define the generation in a 1958 article in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine. This article was able to take more of a look back at the formation of the movement as it was published after &quot;On the Road&quot;. &quot;It describes the state of mind from which all unessentials have been stripped, leaving it receptive to everything around it, but impatient with trivial obstructions. To be beat is to be at the bottom of your personality, looking up.&quot;

<text>The Waldo Patent, a letters patent also known as the Muscongus Patent or the Lincolnshire Patent, was a document granting title to of land in what is now the U.S. state of Maine. It is named variously for businessman Samuel Waldo, who eventually gained control of the patent, and for the Muscongus River, one of the grant&#x27;s boundaries.

==History==
In March 1630, John Beauchamp of London, England, and Thomas Leverett of Boston, England, obtained a grant of land from a company acting under the authority of the government of England.

This grant was first known as the Muscongus Patent from the Muscongus River that formed a part of the western boundary. From the seacoast, it extended northerly between Penobscot Bay and the Penobscot River on the east, and the Muscongus River on the west, to the line that now constitutes the southern boundary of the towns Hampden, Newburgh and Dixmont.

This grant or patent conveyed nothing but the right of exclusive trade with the Native Americans—perhaps the Penobscot or Abenaki peoples—for which a trading house was built and supplied with such articles of exchange as were necessary to successful traffic. Trade was carried on without interruption to the mutual advantage of the European-American settlers and natives until the opening of the first Indian Wars in 1675, a period of 45 years.

After 1675, the patent lay dormant until 1719 when Leverett&#x27;s great-grandson, John Leverett, President of Harvard College, revived the ancient claim and formed the Lincolnshire Proprietors, also known as the Ten Proprietors, so named for the ten shares distributed, one to each member. Samuel Waldo of Boston acquired a controlling interest in the patent in 1729 and it henceforward become known as the Waldo Patent.

General Samuel Waldo was proprietor of the Waldo Patent. He is said to have gone to Europe to recruit German immigrants to settle his 576,000 acre (2,331 km2) grant, which included parts of what are now Waldo, Penobscot and Lincoln counties and all of Knox County, Maine, along with the islands within three miles of its border.

In 1759, Waldo accompanied the governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay, Thomas Pownall, and his 400 men to help establish this site. To open the Penobscot River area to settlement, the governor selected Fort Point in Stockton Springs to build a breastwork and blockhouse. Called Fort Pownall, the fort included a trading post. But Waldo died on May 23 near present-day Bangor while exploring the northern reaches of his property. He was buried without monument at Fort Point. Ownership of the Waldo Patent then transferred to his heirs, who included the Fluckers of Boston. Lucy Flucker married Henry Knox, who served as a general in the American Revolutionary War, and the Knoxes eventually acquired most of the patent. Much of their land was eventually sold to William Bingham, leading those lands to become known as the Bingham Purchase.

<text>Yang Liwei (; born 21 June 1965) is a Chinese major general, former military pilot, and former taikonaut of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.

In October 2003, Yang became the first person sent into space by the Chinese space program. This mission, Shenzhou 5, made China the third country to independently send humans into space. He is currently a vice chief designer of China Manned Space Engineering.

== Early life and education ==
Yang Liwei was born in Suizhong County, Huludao, Liaoning. His mother was a teacher and his father was an accountant at a state agricultural firm. Yang Liwei married Zhang Yumei with whom they had a son together. Zhang Yumei was a part of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army and was a teacher in China&#x27;s Space Program.

In 1983, he enlisted for the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA) and was admitted to the Air Force Second Flight Academy (), graduating in 1987 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree. He participated in the screening process for astronauts in 1996. In the PLAAF, he logged 1,350 hours of flight time as a fighter pilot before he went to space training.

Yang entered Tsinghua University in Beijing for doctoral studies in 2004 and received a Doctor of Philosophy in Management in 2009.

==Spaceflight career==
Yang was selected as a taikonaut candidate in 1998 and has trained for space flight since then. He was chosen from the final pool of 14 candidates to fly on China&#x27;s first crewed space mission. A former fighter pilot in the Aviation Military Unit of the PLA, he held the rank of Lieutenant Colonel at the time of his mission. He was promoted to full Colonel on 20 October 2003. According to the &quot;Youth Daily&quot;, the decision had been made in advance of his spaceflight without Yang being made aware of it.

The launch window of Shenzhou 5, was chosen to be 15 October 2003 because it would coincide with the conclusion of a Communist Party conference in Beijing and a day before President Hu Jintao&#x27;s visit to Thailand for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit. President Hu was present at the launch site to supervise the launch of Shenzhou 5. The launch was not broadcast on live television to prevent negative publicity in the event of a disaster. 

He was launched into space aboard his Shenzhou 5 spacecraft atop a Long March 2F rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in the Gobi Desert at 09:00 CST (01:00 UTC) on 15 October 2003. Prior to his launch almost nothing was made public about the Chinese taikonaut candidates; his selection for the Shenzhou 5 launch was only leaked to the media one day before the launch. The other two potential candidates for the space mission were Nie Haisheng and Zhai Zhigang who were also on standby as backup crews on the day of the launch.

Yang Liwei reported the occurrence of abnormal vibrations two minutes after launch which he described as &quot;very uncomfortable&quot;. The vibrations were later discovered to have come from the launcher rocket. As a consequence, corrective measures were swiftly taken to the design of the following CZ-2F carrier rocket for the Shenzhou-6. 

Yang punctuated his journey with regular updates on his condition; variations of &quot;I feel good&quot;, the last coming as the capsule floated to the ground after re-entry. He spoke to his wife as the Shenzhou 5 started its eighth orbit around the Earth, assuring her from space: &quot;I feel very good, don&#x27;t worry&quot;. He ate specially designed packets of shredded pork with garlic, Kung Pao chicken and eight treasure rice, along with Chinese herbal tea. During the flight, Yang slept two times in 3-hour intervals. In the middle of the journey, state television broadcast footage of Yang waving a small flag of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and that of the United Nations inside his capsule.

State media said Yang&#x27;s capsule was supplied with a gun, a knife and tent in case he landed in the wrong place.

Yang&#x27;s craft landed in the grasslands of the Chinese region of Inner Mongolia at around 06:30 CST on 16 October 2003 (22:00 UTC), having completed 14 orbits and travelled more than 600,000 km. Yang was in space for a total of 21 hours, Yang left the capsule about 15 minutes after landing, and was congratulated by Premier Wen Jiabao. But the astronaut&#x27;s bleeding lips seen in the official images broadcast sparked rumors of a hard landing confirmed by accounts of personnel present at the landing site.

Although the first Chinese citizen in space, Yang Liwei is not the first person of Chinese origin in space. Shanghai-born Taylor Wang flew on Space Shuttle mission STS-51-B in 1985. Wang, however, had become a United States citizen in 1975. Taylor Wang was not the first person born in China to go to orbit. William Anders was born in Hong Kong on 17 October 1933. Anders would be a part of the Apollo 8 lunar orbital mission in 1968.

Yang visited Hong Kong on 31 October 2003, holding talks and sharing his experiences during a six-day stay in the territory. The visit coincided with an exhibition that featured his reentry capsule, spacesuit and leftover food from his 21-hour mission. On 5 November he travelled to Macau.

On 7 November, Yang received the title of &quot;Space Hero&quot; from Jiang Zemin, the Chairman of the PRC Central Military Commission (CMC). He also received a badge of honour during a ceremony at the Great Hall of the People. Russia awarded him the Gagarin medal. The Chinese University of Hong Kong has given Yang an honorary doctorate.

The asteroid 21064 Yangliwei and the fossil bird &quot;Dalingheornis liweii&quot; are named after him.

==After Shenzhou 5==

In a move similar to that taken by the Soviet Union with national space flight hero Yuri Gagarin, an official decision to no longer assign him to future spaceflight missions was made. Yang was promoted to Major General on 22 July 2008.

After the successful space flight of Shenzhou 5, Yang was given the position of vice-commander-in-chief of the astronauts system of China&#x27;s crewed spaceflight project.

Yang became an alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party at the 17th Party Congress in October 2007.

The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization awarded the UNESCO Medal on Space Science to Yang in October 2017.

Yang Liwei is the director of the China Manned Space Engineering Office.
