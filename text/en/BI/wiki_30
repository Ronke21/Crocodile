<text>The Berghof was Adolf Hitler&#x27;s holiday home in the Obersalzberg of the Bavarian Alps near Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, Germany. Other than the &quot;Wolfsschanze&quot; (&quot;Wolf&#x27;s Lair&quot;), his headquarters in East Prussia for the invasion of the Soviet Union, he spent more time here than anywhere else during his time as the &quot;Führer&quot; of Nazi Germany. It was also one of the most widely known of his headquarters, which were located throughout Europe.

The Berghof was rebuilt and renamed in 1935 and was Hitler&#x27;s holiday residence for ten years. It was damaged by British bombs in late April 1945, and again in early May by retreating SS troops, and it was looted after Allied troops reached the area. The Bavarian government demolished the burned shell in 1952.

==History==
The Berghof began as a much smaller chalet called &quot;Haus Wachenfeld&quot;, a holiday home built in 1916 (or 1917) by &quot;Kommerzienrat&quot; Otto Winter, a businessman from Buxtehude. It was located near the &quot;Platterhof&quot;, the former &quot;Pension Moritz&quot; where Hitler had stayed in 1922–23. By 1926, the family running the pension had left, and Hitler did not like the new owner. He moved first to the &quot;Marineheim&quot; and then to a hotel in Berchtesgaden, the &quot;Deutsches Haus&quot;, where he dictated the second volume of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; in the summer of 1926. Hitler met his girlfriend at that time, Maria Reiter, who worked in a shop on the ground floor of the hotel, during another visit in autumn 1926. In 1928, Winter&#x27;s widow rented &quot;Haus Wachenfeld&quot; to Hitler, and his half-sister Angela came to live there as housekeeper, although she left soon after her daughter Geli&#x27;s 1931 death in Hitler&#x27;s Munich apartment.

By 1933, Hitler had purchased &quot;Haus Wachenfeld&quot; with funds he received from the sale of his political manifesto &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The small chalet-style building was refurbished and much expanded by architect Alois Degano during 1935–36 under the supervision of Martin Bormann, when it was renamed &quot;The Berghof&quot; (English: &quot;Mountain Court&quot;). The renovated interiors were designed by Gerdy Troost.

A large terrace was built and featured big, colourful, resort-style canvas umbrellas. The entrance hall &quot;was filled with a curious display of cactus plants in majolica pots.&quot; A dining room was panelled with very costly cembra pine. Hitler&#x27;s large study had a telephone switchboard room. The library contained books &quot;on history, painting, architecture and music.&quot; A great hall was furnished with expensive Teutonic furniture, a large globe, and an expansive red marble fireplace mantel. Behind one wall was a projection booth for evening screenings of films (often, Hollywood productions, including Mickey Mouse).

A sprawling picture window could be lowered into the wall to give a sweeping, open-air view of the snow-capped mountains in Hitler&#x27;s native Austria. The house was maintained much like a small resort hotel by several housekeepers, gardeners, cooks, and other domestic workers. 

The Berghof became a centrepiece of Nazi propaganda. The Nazi-controlled German press as well as the English-language international press covered Hitler&#x27;s life at home in a positive light. These stories helped to soften his image by portraying him as a man of culture, dog lover, and good neighbour. Writer William George Fitz-Gerald, under the pseudonym Ignatius Phayre, published many articles about visiting Hitler at home that were fabricated from Nazi propaganda sources.

Based on German propaganda sources, Fitz-Gerald, writing for the British &quot;Homes &amp; Gardens&quot; magazine, described Hitler as &quot;his own decorator, designer, and furnisher, as well as architect&quot;, and the chalet as &quot;bright and airy&quot; with &quot;a light jade-green colour scheme&quot;; caged Harz Roller canaries were kept in most of the rooms, which were furnished with antiques, mostly German furniture from the 18th century. Old engravings hung in the guest bedrooms, along with some of Hitler&#x27;s small watercolour sketches. His personal valet Heinz Linge stated that Hitler and his longtime companion Eva Braun had two bedrooms and two bathrooms with interconnecting doors, and Hitler would end most evenings alone with her in his study drinking tea.

Though Hitler did not smoke, smoking was allowed on the terrace. His vegetarian diet was supplied by nearby kitchen gardens and, later, a greenhouse. A large complex of mountain homes for the Nazi leadership, and many buildings for their security and support staff, were constructed nearby. To acquire the land for these projects, many neighbours were compelled to sell their properties and leave. A mountaintop structure, the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot;, nicknamed &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; by André François-Poncet, a French diplomat, was built in 1937–38 above the Berghof, but Hitler rarely went there.

The area became a German tourist attraction during the mid-1930s, after Hitler came to power as dictator. Visitors gathered at the end of the driveway or on nearby public paths in the hope of catching a glimpse of Hitler. This led to the introduction of severe restrictions on access to the area and other security measures. A large contingent of the &quot;Leibstandarte SS Adolf Hitler&quot; was housed in barracks adjacent to the Berghof. Under the command of &quot;Obersturmbannführer&quot; Bernhard Frank, they patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone that encompassed the nearby homes of the other Nazi leaders. With the outbreak of war extensive anti-aircraft defences were also installed, including smoke-generating machines to conceal the Berghof complex from hostile aircraft.

The nearby former hotel &quot;Türken&quot; was turned into quarters to house the &quot;Reichssicherheitsdienst&quot; (Reich Security Service; RSD) SS security men who patrolled the grounds of the Berghof. It was later occupied by the &quot;Generalmajor&quot; of the Police. (The hotel was rebuilt in 1950 and reopened as a hotel before Christmas, the Hotel zum Türken. Visitors can still explore the historic underground hallways and tunnels that had been used by the Nazis.)

Whenever Hitler was in residence, members of the RSD and &quot;Führerbegleitkommando&quot; (Führer Escort Command; FBK) were present. While the RSD men patrolled the grounds, the FBK men provided close security protection for Hitler. Several Wehrmacht mountain troop units were also housed nearby. Hence, the British never planned a direct attack on the compound.

===Guests===
Guests at the Berghof included political figures, monarchs, heads of state, and diplomats along with painters, singers, and musicians. The important visitors personally greeted on the steps of the Berghof by Hitler included David Lloyd George (3 March 1936), the Aga Khan (20 October 1937), Duke and Duchess of Windsor (22 October 1937), Kurt von Schuschnigg (12 February 1938), Neville Chamberlain (15 September 1938), and Benito Mussolini (19 January 1941). At the end of July 1940, Hitler summoned his military chiefs from OKW and OKH to the Berghof for the &#x27;Berghof Conference&#x27; at which the &#x27;Russian problem&#x27; was studied. On 11 May 1941, Karlheinz Pintsch visited the Berghof to deliver a letter from Rudolf Hess informing Hitler of his illegal flight to Scotland.

Hitler&#x27;s social circle at his Berghof retreat – which his intimates referred to as &quot;on the &quot;Berg&quot;&quot; – included Eva Braun and her sister Gretl, Herta Schneider and her children, Eva&#x27;s friend Marion Schönmann, Heinrich Hoffmann, and the wives and children of other Nazi leaders and Hitler&#x27;s staff who would all pose for an annual group photograph on the occasion of Hitler&#x27;s birthday. The social scene at the Berghof ended on 14 July 1944, when Hitler left for his military headquarters in East Prussia, never to return.

Silent colour films shot by Eva Braun survived the war and showed Hitler and his guests relaxing at the Berghof. In 2006, computer lip-reading software identified several parts of their conversations. Among those identified in the films were Joseph Goebbels, Reinhard Heydrich, Heinrich Himmler, Joachim von Ribbentrop, Albert Speer, and Karl Wolff.

Two guests planned to use a visit to the Berghof as an opportunity to assassinate Hitler. On 11 March 1944, Captain Eberhard von Breitenbuch arrived with a concealed pistol with the intention of shooting Hitler in the head, but guards would not allow him into the same room. On 7 June 1944, Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg planned to detonate a bomb at a meeting there, but his fellow conspirators would not give him approval to do so because Himmler and Hermann Göring were also not present.

===British assassination plan===
The Allies rejected suggestions about derailing Hitler&#x27;s train to Obersalzberg and using poison in the train&#x27;s drinking water, but the British developed a plan named Operation Foxley in 1944. This called for a sniper to kill Hitler on his daily 15–20 minute walk from the Berghof residence to the &quot;Teehaus&quot; on the Mooslahnerkopf Hill, which had been revealed by a prisoner of war. The operation would be undertaken by a German-speaking Pole and a British sniper wearing German uniforms after being parachuted into Austria. They would be housed and led to the area by an anti-Nazi, identified as &quot;Heidentaler&quot; who lived nearby in Salzburg. The Foxley plan did not proceed, due to a dispute as to whether killing Hitler was a prudent idea and the lack of intelligence about his exact daily routine. By the time that the plan might have proceeded, Hitler had stopped visiting his mountain retreat; he never returned to the compound after 14 July 1944.

==Post-war ruins==


The Obersalzberg was bombed by hundreds of British RAF Lancaster heavy bombers, including aircraft from No. 617 Squadron RAF (the &quot;Dambusters&quot;), which attacked Obersalzberg on 25 April 1945. At least two bombs struck the Berghof and did considerable damage to the building. Retreating SS troops set fire to the villa on 4 May, four days after Hitler&#x27;s suicide in Berlin. Only hours later, the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division arrived at Berchtesgaden along with the French 2nd Armoured Division. The Americans having only invested the town of Berchtesgaden, the French took advantage of this to attack Obersalzberg where the Berghof was located. In their Jeep, Captain Laurent Touyeras and his driver, Brigadier François Borg, overtook the half-tracks of the 2nd DB which were struggling to climb the slope. They were thus the first Allied soldiers to reach the chalet which was still burning. The French discovered kilometers of underground bunkers housing art objects looted from all over Europe, but also thousands of bottles of fine wines, tons of provisions and more surprising pieces, such as a collection of bras amassed by Göring. Allied soldiers thoroughly looted and stripped the house over the next few days. The American 1st Battalion of the 506th Infantry Regiment arrived on 8 May. The 3rd Battalion of the 506th came into Berchtesgaden by a different route and sustained casualties in a skirmish with the crews of two German 88mm anti-aircraft/anti-tank guns. One of the most notable artifacts taken by American soldiers was the Columbus Globe for State and Industry Leaders, known more commonly as &quot;Hitler&#x27;s Globe&quot;.

The teahouse on Mooslahnerkopf hill was unscathed in the April 1945 bombing raid, but the Bavarian government knocked it down by 1951 because of its link with Hitler. For 55 years, the ruins lay in the woods by the 13th hole of the Gutshof golf course, but these were taken away altogether during the summer of 2006. The Berghof&#x27;s shell survived until 1952, when the Bavarian government demolished it with explosives on 30 April. The Berghof, the houses of Göring and Bormann, the SS barracks, the Kampfhäusl, and the teahouse were all destroyed. This had been part of an agreement under which the Americans handed the area back to the Bavarian authorities. There was fear that the ruins would become a neo-Nazi shrine and tourist attraction.

More than 50 Obersalzberg Nazi buildings were destroyed. The Platterhof had been a nearby hostel for visitors to the area, and it was turned into the General Walker Hotel for American troops after the war. It was demolished in 2001.

==Location of the Berghof and Hitler&#x27;s other headquarters==

The Berghof was one of the headquarters used by Hitler during the war. There were about 14 known completed &quot;Führer&quot; Headquarters.

<text>The  (known in English as the Eagle&#x27;s Nest) is a Nazi-constructed building erected atop the summit of the Kehlstein, a rocky outcrop that rises above Obersalzberg near the southeast German town of Berchtesgaden. It was used exclusively by members of the Nazi Party for government and social meetings. It was visited on 14 documented instances by Adolf Hitler. Today, it is open seasonally as a restaurant, beer garden, and tourist site.

==Construction==

The &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; sits on a ridge atop the Kehlstein, a subpeak of the Hoher Göll that rises above the town of Berchtesgaden. It was commissioned by Martin Bormann in the summer of 1937. Paid for by the Nazi Party, it was completed in 13 months. Twelve workers died during its construction.

A wide approach road climbs over ; it includes five tunnels and one hairpin turn. It cost to build (about $247 million USD, inflation-adjusted for 2022). Hitler&#x27;s birthday in April 1939 was considered a deadline for the project&#x27;s completion, so work continued throughout the winter of 1938, even at night with the worksite lit by searchlights.

From a large car park, a entry tunnel leads to an ornate elevator that ascends the final to the building. The tunnel is lined with marble and was originally heated with warm air from an adjoining service tunnel. However it was normal for visiting high-officials to be driven through the tunnel to the elevator. Their driver would then have to reverse the car for the entire length of the tunnel as there was no space to turn.

The inside of the large elevator is surfaced with polished brass, Venetian mirrors, and green leather. The building&#x27;s main reception room is dominated by a fireplace of red Italian marble presented by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, which was damaged by Allied soldiers chipping off pieces to take home as souvenirs. The building had a completely electric appliance kitchen, which was unusual in 1937, but was never used to cook meals; instead meals were prepared in town and taken to the kitchen on the mountain top to be reheated. The building also has heated floors, with heating required for at least two days before visitors arrived. A MAN submarine diesel engine and an electrical generator were installed in an underground chamber close to the main entrance, to provide back-up power.

Much of the furniture was designed by Paul László.

==Use==

Hitler first visited on 16 September 1938 and returned to inaugurate it on 20 April 1939, his 50th birthday, though it was not intended as a birthday gift.

There are two ways to approach and enter the building: the road and the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; elevator. Hitler did not trust the elevator, continually expressed his reservations of its safety, and disliked using it; his biggest fear was that the elevator&#x27;s winch mechanism on the roof would attract a lightning strike. Bormann took great pains to never mention the two serious lightning strikes that occurred during construction.

The &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; lies several miles directly above the Berghof, Hitler&#x27;s summer home. In a rare diplomatic engagement, Hitler received departing French ambassador André François-Poncet on 18 October 1938, here. It was he who coined the name &quot;Eagle&#x27;s Nest&quot; for the building while later describing the experience; this has since become a commonly used name for the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot;.

A wedding reception for Eva Braun&#x27;s sister Gretl was held there following her marriage to Hermann Fegelein on 3 June 1944. While Hitler more often than not left the entertaining duties to others, he believed the house presented an excellent opportunity to entertain important and impressionable guests.

Referred to as the &quot;D-Haus&quot;, short for &quot;Diplomatic Reception House&quot;, the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; is often conflated with the teahouse on Mooslahnerkopf Hill near the Berghof, which Hitler walked to daily after lunch. The teahouse was demolished by the Bavarian government after the war, due to its connection to Hitler.

==Allied capture==
The &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; was a target for the 25 April 1945 bombing of Obersalzberg. This was a Royal Air Force bombing raid conducted by No. 1, No. 5, and No. 8 Group and No. 617 Squadron. The small house proved an elusive target for the force of 359 Avro Lancasters and 16 de Havilland Mosquitoes, which bombed and severely damaged the Berghof area instead.

It is uncertain which Allied military unit was the first to reach the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot;. The matter is compounded by popular confusion of it being taken on 4 May by forward elements of the &quot;2e Division Blindée&quot; (specifically &quot;La Nueve&quot;, a company composed of Spanish Republicans), with the town of Berchtesgaden, taken by elements of the U.S. 7th Infantry Regiment.

Reputedly, members of the 7th went as far as the elevator to the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot;, with at least one person claiming that he and a partner continued on to the top. In a Library of Congress interview and more recent interviews, Herman Louis Finnell of the 3rd Infantry Division said that his regiment entered the Berghof, not the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot;. However, the 101st Airborne claims it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot;.

Meanwhile, troops of the &quot;2e Division Blindée&quot;, including Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis, and Paul Répiton-Préneuf, were present on the night of 4-5 May, and took Hitler&#x27;s personal items and several photographs before the Americans arrived and before leaving on 10 May at the request of U.S. command. This is corroborated by numerous testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them.

Undamaged in the 25 April bombing raid, the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; was subsequently used by the Allies as a military command post until 1960, when it was handed back to the State of Bavaria.

==Today==
Today the building is owned by a charitable trust, and operates as a restaurant offering indoor dining and an outdoor beer garden. It is a popular tourist attraction due to its historical significance. The road has been closed to private vehicles since 1952 because it is too narrow for two-way travel. The house can be reached on foot (in two hours) from Obersalzberg, or by bus from the Documentation Centre. The Documentation Centre directs visitors to the coach station where tickets are purchased. The bus ticket serves as an entry ticket, as it permits the holder entry to the building&#x27;s elevator. The buses are specially modified to ascend the steep road leading to the peak. In 2023 the shuttle busses were converted to fully electric. The &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; interior offers little information about its past. Photos displayed and described along the wall of the sun terrace document the pre-construction location and later history.

Informal tours of the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; can be booked through the website. Due to concern about neo-Nazis and post-war Nazi sympathisers, no external guides are permitted to conduct tours.

The lower rooms are not part of the restaurant but can be visited with a guide. They offer views of the building&#x27;s past through plate-glass windows. Graffiti left by Allied troops is still clearly visible in the surrounding woodwork. The red Italian marble fireplace remains damaged by Allied souvenir hunters, though this was later halted by signage posted that the building was U.S. government property, and damage to it was cause for disciplinary action. Hitler&#x27;s small study is now a storeroom for the cafeteria.

A trail leads above the &quot;Kehlsteinhaus&quot; towards the Mannlgrat ridge reaching from the Kehlstein to the summit of the Hoher Göll. The route, which is served by a Klettersteig, is regarded as the easiest to the top.

<doc id="343983" wikidata="Q3404636" url="?curid=343983" title="Gandhi Peace Award">
<text>The Gandhi Peace Award is an award and cash prize presented annually since 1960 by Promoting Enduring Peace to individuals for &quot;contributions made in the promotion of international peace and good will.&quot; It is named in honor of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, but has no personal connection to Mohandas Gandhi or his family.

Recent award winners include Tom B.K. Goldtooth (2015), Kathy Kelly of Voices for Creative Nonviolence (2015), Omar Barghouti (2017), Ralph Nader (2017), Jackson Browne (2018), Dr. Zaher Sahloul of MedGlobal, and Mayson Almisri, a leader of the Syrian White Helmets (2020), and Kali Akuno, co-founder of Cooperation Jackson in Jackson, Mississippi (2023).

Since 1960, when the first award was accepted by Eleanor Roosevelt, the award has been presented in person to &quot;peace heroes&quot; who have exemplified to the members of Promoting Enduring Peace the courage of nonviolent resistance to abusive power, to armed conflict, to violent oppression, and to environmental negligence. The award is also intended to recognize individuals for having made significant contributions, through cooperative and non-violent means in the spirit of Gandhi, to the struggle to achieve a sustainable world civilization founded on enduring international peace.

In the 21st century the award is especially intended by its presenters to honor those whose lives and works exemplify the principle that international peace, universal socioeconomic justice, and planetary environmental harmony are interdependent and inseparable, and all three are essential to the survival of civilization.

The award itself is symbolized by a heavy medallion and a certificate with an inscription summing up the recipient&#x27;s work. The medallion, forged from Peace Bronze (a metal rendered from decommissioned nuclear missile command systems, evoking &quot;swords into plowshares&quot;), features Gandhi&#x27;s profile and his words &quot;Love Ever Suffers/Never Revenges Itself&quot; cast in bronze. The award has been presented at a ceremony held typically once a year in New York or New Haven at which the recipient is invited to present a message of challenge and hope.

== History ==
The Gandhi Peace Award was conceived by the founder of Promoting Enduring Peace, Yale Professor Jerome Davis. Davis first proposed the award to the board of Promoting Enduring Peace on 13 March 1959, with the name intended to pay tribute to the modern era&#x27;s foremost advocate of nonviolent resistance, and partly to help rectify the failure of the Nobel Committee to award its Peace Prize to Gandhi before his death in 1948. The award has been issued since 1960, when it was first presented to Eleanor Roosevelt, and consists of a certificate, a ceremony, and the presentation of a bronze medallion inscribed with a quotation by Gandhi: &quot;Love Ever Suffers / Never Revenges Itself.&quot; A prominent New York sculptor, Don Benaron/Katz, was commissioned to create a work of art to serve as the symbol of the award. He researched Gandhi at the library of the India House in New York City and by 1960 had carved a striking bas-relief portrait in wood of the founder of the century’s international movement for nonviolent change. He wrote of the medallion he also created, “I carved the Gujarati word for peace on one side, and on the other a symbolic plowshare and pruning hook inspired by Isaiah 2:4...″
::They shall beat their swords into plowshares
::and their spears into pruning hooks;
::nation shall not lift up sword against nation,
::neither shall they learn war any more.

Since 2011 the award has included a cash prize. The presentation ceremony is held in New Haven, Connecticut, USA. At present the laureates are and have been North Americans and British subjects. A book about the award from its inception through 1997, In Gandhi&#x27;s Footsteps: The First Half Century of Promoting Enduring Peace, was written and published by James Clement van Pelt.

==Notable laureates==
In 1989 the award was presented to Cesar Chavez, founder of the United Farm Workers of America, for his use of nonviolent tactics, including a national consumer boycott, to improve the conditions and compensation for migrant farm workers. (His acceptance speech may be viewed here.)

In 2011 the award was presented to Rabbi Ehud Bandel and Rabbi Arik Ascherman for their leadership of Rabbis for Human Rights and its nonviolent resistance to the persecution of Palestinians in the occupied territories. (Their acceptance speeches may be viewed here.)

In 2012 the award was presented to Amy Goodman for her contribution to promoting a sustainable peace through the promotion of transparently truthful journalism—one essential part of which is to report the true nature and long-term after-effects of war. Goodman is an internationally known broadcast journalist, syndicated columnist, investigative reporter, author, and the anchor and co-founder of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot;, an independent global news program broadcast daily on radio and television and via the Internet. (Her acceptance speech may be viewed here.)

The 2013 award was presented to Bill McKibben who is one of the most well-known leaders of the environmentalist movement in the United States. His first book was &quot;The End of Nature&quot; published in 1989. An activist and journalist, his work has appeared in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly, Harper&#x27;s Magazine, Mother Jones,&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. (His acceptance speech may be viewed here.)

Promoting Enduring Peace announced in January 2014 that the Gandhi Peace Award for that year would be received by Medea Benjamin.

In 2015 the award was presented to Tom B.K. Goldtooth and Kathy Kelly.

In 2017 the laureates were Ralph Nader and Omar Barghouti.

The laureate in 2018 was Jackson Browne. He is the first artist to receive the award.

==Laureates==
^ * Martin Luther King Jr. was designated to receive the award in 1964 and did formally accept it, but shortly thereafter was designated as the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate for that year. Thereafter he was unable to attend a ceremony for the formal presentation of the award prior to his assassination.

^ ** Daniel Berrigan formally accepted the award. Shortly thereafter he made remarks critical of Israeli treatment of Palestinians that led to a proposal by a PEP member that the award to Fr. Berrigan should be rescinded. Although the organization rejected that course, Fr. Berrigan heard about the proposal and resigned the award.

<text>Dinnington is a town in the civil parish of Dinnington St John&#x27;s, in the Metropolitan Borough of Rotherham, in South Yorkshire, England. It is near to the towns of Worksop and Rotherham and cities of Sheffield and Doncaster.

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Dinnington is the principal settlement in the civil parish of Dinnington St John&#x27;s, which also includes the small satellite hamlets of Throapham and St John&#x27;s. The Dinnington St John&#x27;s parish is the most populous constituent of the St John&#x27;s ward, which also includes the parishes of Laughton-en-le-Morthen, Firbeck, Letwell and Gildingwells. In 2001 this ward had a population of 11,476, with Dinnington St John&#x27;s itself making up 9,161 of that figure. The population of the ward at the 2011 Census had increased to 12,517. Dinnington is about above sea level.

==History==
Excavations show Dinnington to have been inhabited since at least Neolithic times, and it has been suggested that the settlement takes its name from a local barrow, though a more traditional interpretation of &quot;Dinnington&quot; would be &quot;Dunn&#x27;s Farmstead&quot;, or &quot;Town of Dunn&#x27;s People&quot;.

Dinnington was originally a small, isolated farming community, based around the New Road area of the town. Quarrying in the area helped expand the population, but it was the sinking of the Dinnington Main Colliery in 1905 that led to the real growth of the settlement. The census of 1911 shows a twenty-fold increase in population of the parish since 1901, from 250 to 5,000. In 1951 the parish had a population of 7,053.

The coal miners initially lived in a prefabricated shanty town in Laughton Common, colloquially known as &quot;Tin Town&quot; or &quot;White City&quot; but later moved into colliery-built terrace houses around the central shopping area of Laughton Road.

Dinnington was an ancient parish which became a civil parish in 1866. On 1 April 1954 the civil parish was abolished and merged with the civil parish of St Johns with Throapham, to form the civil parish of Dinnington St John&#x27;s.

Dinnington continued to expand throughout the 20th century, largely through the growth of commuter living that followed the Second World War. As the housing estates spread, Dinnington began to merge seamlessly into the neighbouring settlements of Throapham and North Anston. The result is a strip of urban development that mainly acts as a commuter base for Sheffield, Rotherham and Worksop, although with the closure of coal mines and steel mills, the area saw a rapid decline in the late 1980s and early 1990s and despite steady growth, still boasted the highest level of unemployment in the UK in 2001.

Dinnington Colliery was closed in 1992. This damaged the local community, and had a large negative impact on the local economy with initial job losses and knock-on effect closures to local business. In 2019 Conservative Alexander Stafford was voted as the MP for the Rother Valley constituency, of which Dinnington is a part, many in Dinnington were understandably unhappy given the towns history with Conservative party. In 2023 Councillor Charlie Wooding was removed from his position after it was revealed that he had failed to attend council meeting while continuing to claim his wages, causing outrage in the town, a by-election was triggered and local resident Julia Hall was elected to take his place 

In 1995, Dinnington was featured in an episode of the BBC1 TV documentary series &quot;Everyman&quot;, entitled Simon&#x27;s Cross. The programme described the life of Dinnington parish priest, the Rev Simon Bailey, detailing his life, work and reflections while living with AIDS, and the way members of the parish of Dinnington came to terms with it and supported him. &quot;Scarlet Ribbons: A Priest with AIDS&quot;, an account of his story, was written by Simon Bailey&#x27;s sister, Rosemary Bailey and published by Serpent&#x27;s Tail in 1997. In 2003, Dinnington was declared a town as part of an attempt to attract more investment and improve the local economy.

Controversy arose in the village over plans to redevelop the Miners&#x27; Welfare. The Welfare buildings and sports fields were provided originally for the miners at the local colliery by CISWO in 1926. The property had been leased to Rotherham Borough Council and was used for Safe@Start programmes up until 2007. It has remained empty since that date and has been subject to vandalism and lack of repairs. Controversy over development resulted in the formation of a local residents&#x27; group opposing the development plans and asking for the regeneration of the site as an amenity for local people.

Dinnington had a population of 9,077 in the 2011 census, which makes it slightly larger than Wath-upon-Dearne. Here are the three areas known as Dinnington:

* Dinnington Civil Parish (town proper) population 9,077
* Dinnington Ward population 12,517
* Built up area (contains Dinnington, Anston and Throapham) population 20,152

==Community==
Dinnington&#x27;s two further education establishments are Rotherham College of Arts and Technology and the sixth form at Dinnington High School.

Dinnington&#x27;s high street and main shopping areas include Tesco, Savers, Domino&#x27;s and Aldi stores, as well as small traders, including several take-aways, a haberdashery and an indoor market.

Manor Motorsport, known in Formula One as Virgin Racing from 2010 to 2011, Marussia F1 from 2012 to 2014 and currently known as Manor Marussia F1 were once based in the town.

The town&#x27;s only football club Dinnington Town F.C. play at Phoenix Park, situated at the Dinnington Resource Centre.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Sheffield, Heart Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio South Yorkshire, Hits Radio South Yorkshire, and Redload FM, a community based radio station that broadcast from Rotherham.

The town is served by these local newspapers:
*&quot;Rotherham Advertiser&quot;
*&quot;Worksop Guardian&quot;
*&quot;The Star&quot;

==Transport==

Dinnington Interchange is a small bus station operated by Travel South Yorkshire in Dinnington town centre. Opened next to Dinnington Market in the late 1990s, replacing on-street bus stops on the congested Laughton Road, the Interchange consists of three bus stands with a covered indoor waiting area, toilets and a staffed ticket office at peak times. Dinnington Interchange provides a local hub for bus services between Sheffield, Rotherham and Worksop.

<doc id="343999" wikidata="Q208338" url="?curid=343999" title="Baldassare Galuppi">
<text>Baldassare Galuppi (18 October 17063 January 1785) was a Venetian composer, born on the island of Burano in the Venetian Republic. He belonged to a generation of composers, including Johann Adolph Hasse, Giovanni Battista Sammartini, and C. P. E. Bach, whose works are emblematic of the prevailing galant music that developed in Europe throughout the 18th century. He achieved international success, spending periods of his career in Vienna, London and Saint Petersburg, but his main base remained Venice, where he held a succession of leading appointments.

In his early career Galuppi made a modest success in &quot;opera seria&quot;, but from the 1740s, together with the playwright and librettist Carlo Goldoni, he became famous throughout Europe for his comic operas in the new &quot;dramma giocoso&quot; style. To the succeeding generation of composers, he was known as &quot;the father of comic opera&quot;. Some of his mature &quot;opere serie&quot;, for which his librettists included the poet and dramatist Metastasio, were also widely popular.

Throughout his career Galuppi held official positions with charitable and religious institutions in Venice, the most prestigious of which was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the Doge&#x27;s chapel, St Mark&#x27;s Basilica. In these various capacities he composed a large amount of sacred music. He was also highly regarded as a virtuoso performer on and composer for keyboard instruments.

In the latter half of the 18th century, Galuppi&#x27;s music was largely forgotten outside of Italy, and Napoleon&#x27;s invasion of Venice in 1797 resulted in Galuppi&#x27;s manuscripts being scattered around Western Europe, and in many cases, destroyed or lost. Galuppi&#x27;s name persists in the English poet Robert Browning&#x27;s 1855 poem &quot;A Toccata of Galuppi&#x27;s&quot;, but this has not helped maintain the composer&#x27;s work in the general repertoire. Some of Galuppi&#x27;s works were occasionally performed in the 200 years after his death, but it was not until the last years of the 20th century that his compositions were extensively revived in live performance and on recordings.

== Biography ==

===Early years===

Galuppi was born on the island of Burano in the Venetian Lagoon, and from as early as age 22 was known as &quot;Il Buranello&quot;, a nickname which even appears in the signature on his music manuscripts, &quot;Baldassare Galuppi, called &#x27;Buranello&#x27;.&quot; His father was a barber, who also played the violin in theatre orchestras, and is believed to have been his son&#x27;s first music teacher. Although there is no documentation, oral tradition as related to Francesco Caffi in the nineteenth century says that the young Galuppi was trained in composition and harpsichord by Antonio Lotti, the chief organist at St Mark&#x27;s Basilica. At the age of 15 Galuppi composed his first opera, &quot;Gli amici rivali&quot;, which, according to Caffi, was performed unsuccessfully at Chioggia and equally unsuccessfully in Vicenza under the title &quot;La fede nell&#x27;incostanza&quot;.

From 1726 to 1728, Galuppi was harpsichordist at the Teatro della Pergola in Florence. On his return to Venice in 1728, he produced a second opera, &quot;Gl&#x27;odi delusi dal sangue&quot;, written in collaboration with another Lotti pupil, Giovanni Battista Pescetti; it was well received when it was presented at the Teatro San Angelo. The collaborators followed it with an &quot;opera seria&quot;, &quot;Dorinda&quot;, the next year. This, too, was modestly successful, and Galuppi began to receive commissions for operas and oratorios.

In 1740, Galuppi was appointed &quot;maestro di coro&quot; at the Ospedale dei Mendicanti in Venice, where his duties ranged from teaching and conducting to composing liturgical music and oratorios. In his first year of service at the Mendicanti, he composed 31 works: 16 motets, 13 settings of the &quot;Salve Regina&quot;, and two psalm settings. Although he became internationally known as an operatic composer, he maintained a steady output of sacred music throughout his career.

In 1741 Galuppi was invited to work in London. He petitioned the Mendicanti authorities for leave of absence, to which they agreed.
He was in England for 18 months, supervising productions for the Italian opera company at the King&#x27;s Theatre. Of the 11 operas under his direction, at least three are known to have been his own compositions, &quot;Penelope&quot;, &quot;Scipione in Cartagine&quot; and &quot;Sirbace&quot;; a fourth was presented shortly after he left London to return to Venice. Rival composer Handel attended one of these productions. Galuppi also attracted attention as a keyboard virtuoso and composer. His contemporary, the English musicologist Charles Burney, wrote that &quot;Galuppi had had more influence on English music than any other Italian composer&quot;. However, in Burney&#x27;s view Galuppi&#x27;s skills were still immature during his spell in London. Burney wrote, &quot;He now copied the hasty, light and flimsy style which reigned in Italy at this time, and which Handel&#x27;s solidity and science had taught the English to despise.&quot;

On his return to Venice in May 1743, Galuppi returned to his employment with the Mendicanti, and to composing for the opera houses. The operatic fashion in Venice was on the point of changing from &quot;opera seria&quot; to a new style of comic opera, &quot;dramma giocoso&quot;. Full-length comic operas from Naples and Rome were becoming fashionable; Galuppi adapted three of them for Venetian audiences in 1744, and the following year composed one of his own, &quot;La forza d&#x27;amore&quot;, which was only a mild success. He continued to compose serious operas, sometimes in partnership with the librettist Metastasio. The latter believed firmly that the music was there to serve the text rather than vice versa. He grumbled about Galuppi in 1749, &quot;He is, I presume, an excellent composer for violins, for cellos and for voices, but he is an exceedingly bad one for poets. When he writes he thinks as much about the words as you do about being elected Pope ... As far as the public is concerned, he is appreciated by those who judge with their ears but not their souls.&quot; Nevertheless, their joint work prospered, and was staged in other countries. In Vienna, their &quot;Demetrio&quot; and &quot;Artaserse&quot; were great successes, the former breaking all local box-office records. 

In May 1748 Galuppi was appointed &quot;vice-maestro&quot; of the Doge&#x27;s chapel, St Mark&#x27;s. In time this would lead to a large body of religious compositions, but for the present Galuppi was chiefly engaged in operatic work. It is not clear to Denis Arnold why he accepted the post at St Mark&#x27;s. The musicologist writes, &quot;He was already a very successful opera composer and with his duties at the Mendicanti he must have had enough to do. The salary at St Mark&#x27;s was only 120 ducats. ... At this time it was not a very distinguished &quot;cappella&quot;. The choir probably numbered about 30; but since their posts continued up to death, a fair proportion of the singers were old.&quot; However, Daniel Heartz points out that Galuppi&#x27;s salary eventually increased to 400 ducats per annum, and then to 600 ducats. In addition to the prestige of the position, Galuppi was given a house near the basilica in which he and his family lived rent-free, and as he had very few firm obligations as vice-maestro, the position left him with the flexibility to compose for other venues, including opera houses in Venice, Vienna, London, and Berlin. By the time of his death, Galuppi and Gluck were two of the highest paid composers of the 18th century. (See Heartz, 2003)

Galuppi was fortunate that when he turned once more to comic opera in 1749 he collaborated with Carlo Goldoni. Although an established and eminent playwright by the time he worked with Galuppi, Goldoni was happy for his libretti to be subservient to the music. He was as warm in his regard for Galuppi as Metastasio was cold. Their first collaboration was &quot;Arcadia in Brenta&quot; followed by four more joint works within a year. They were enormously popular at home and abroad, and to meet the demand for new &quot;drammi giocosi&quot; and &quot;opere serie&quot; Galuppi had to resign his post at the Mendicanti in 1751. By the middle of the 1750s he was, in the words of musicologist Dale Monson, &quot;the most popular opera composer anywhere&quot;.

For the next ten years, Galuppi remained in Venice, with occasional sorties elsewhere for commissions and premieres, producing a series of secular and religious works. His operas, serious or comic, were in demand across Europe. Of the British premiere of &quot;Il filosofo di campagna&quot; in 1761 Burney wrote, &quot;This burletta surpassed in musical merit all the comic operas that were performed in England, till the &quot;Buona Figliuola&quot;.&quot;

In April 1762 Galuppi was appointed to the leading musical post in Venice, &quot;maestro di capella&quot; of St Mark&#x27;s, and in July of the same year he was also appointed &quot;maestro di coro&quot; (choir master) at the Ospedale degli Incurabili. At St Mark&#x27;s, he set about reforming the choir. He persuaded the Basilica authorities, the Procurators, to be more flexible in payments to singers, allowing him to attract performers with first-rate voices such as Gaetano Guadagni and Gasparo Pacchiarotti.

===Saint Petersburg===
Early in 1764 Catherine the Great of Russia made it known through diplomatic channels that she wished Galuppi to come to Saint Petersburg as her court composer and conductor. There were prolonged negotiations between Russia and the Venetian authorities before the Senate of Venice agreed to release Galuppi for a three-year engagement at the Russian court. The contract required him to &quot;compose and produce operas, ballets and cantatas for ceremonial banquets&quot;, at a salary of 4,000 rubles and the provision of accommodation and a carriage. Galuppi was reluctant, but Venetian officials assured him that his post and salary as &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s were secure until 1768 as long as he supplied a &quot;Gloria&quot; and a &quot;Credo&quot; for the Basilica&#x27;s Christmas mass each year.

In June 1764 the senate granted Galuppi formal leave to go. He resigned his post at the Incurabili, made provision for his wife and daughters (who were to remain in Venice, while his son travelled with him), and set off for Russia. He made detours on his journey, visiting C.P.E. Bach in Berlin and encountering Giacomo Casanova by chance outside of Riga, before arriving in Saint Petersburg on 22 September 1765.

For the empress&#x27;s court, Galuppi composed new works, both operatic and liturgical, and revived and revised many others. He wrote one opera there, &quot;Ifigenia in Tauride&quot; (1768), and two cantatas, &quot;La virtù liberata&quot; (1765) and &quot;La pace tra la virtù e la bellezza&quot; (1766), the latter to words by Metastasio. In addition to the work for which he had been contracted, Galuppi gave weekly recitals at the harpsichord, and sometimes conducted orchestral concerts. To improve standards he was a hard taskmaster to the court orchestra, but was from the outset enormously impressed by the court choir. He is reported to have exclaimed, &quot;I&#x27;d never heard such a magnificent choir in Italy&quot;. Galuppi took pride in his prestigious appointments; the title page of his 1766 Christmas mass for St Mark&#x27;s describes him as: &quot;First Master and Director of all the Music for Her Imperial Majesty the Empress of all the Russias, etc. etc. and First Master of the Ducal Chapel of St. Mark&#x27;s in Venice.&quot; In 1768, as had been agreed, he returned to Venice, detouring again on his journey, this time to visit Johann Adolph Hasse in Vienna.

===Later years===
On his return to Venice, Galuppi resumed his duties at St Mark&#x27;s and successfully applied for reappointment at the Incurabili, holding the post until 1776, when financial constraints obliged all the &quot;ospedali&quot; to cut back their musical activities. In his later years he wrote more sacred than secular music. His output continued to be considerable in both quantity and quality. Burney, who visited him in Venice, wrote in 1771:
Galuppi told Burney his definition of good music: &quot;vaghezza, chiarezza, e buona modulazione&quot; (beauty, clearness, and good modulation)&quot;. Burney commented on Galuppi&#x27;s prodigious workload that in addition to his duties at St Mark&#x27;s and the Incurabili, &quot;he has a hundred sequins a year as domestic organist to the family of Gritti, and is organist of another church, of which I have forgotten the name&quot;.

The last opera by Galuppi was &quot;La serva per amore&quot;, premiered in October 1773. In May 1782 he conducted concerts to mark a papal visit to Venice by Pope Pius VI. Thereafter he continued to compose, despite declining health. His last known completed work is the 1784 Christmas mass for St Mark&#x27;s.

After a two-month illness, Galuppi died on 3 January 1785. He was buried in the church of San Vitale, and, much mourned, was commemorated by a requiem mass &quot;solemnized in the church of Santo Stefano, paid for by professional musicians, at which the actors of the Teatro S Benedetto sang&quot;.

==Music==

===Operas===

According to &quot;The Musical Times&quot; Galuppi, with 109 operas, was the sixth most prolific opera composer. His output was exceeded by his contemporaries Draghi, Piccinni, Paisiello, Guglielmi, and the most prolific of all, with 166 operas, Wenzel Müller; the only composer of later generations who approached his output was Offenbach 100 years later. Like most of his contemporaries, Galuppi did not hesitate to re-use his own music, sometimes simply transplanting it and at other times reworking it substantially.

He was called &quot;the father of comic opera&quot; by musicians of the generation that followed him. The 21st-century editor and musicologist Francesco Luisi writes that although this description is not strictly accurate, the Galuppi–Goldoni operas were &quot;a genuinely new beginning for musical theatre&quot;. In Luisi&#x27;s view these works fundamentally changed the nature of opera by making the music part of the drama and not merely a decoration. Galuppi&#x27;s contemporary Esteban de Arteaga wrote approvingly that the composer was able to &quot;illumine the personalities of the characters and the situations in which they find themselves by selecting the most appropriate type of voice and style of singing&quot;.

As well as his general contribution to the essentials of comic opera, establishing the music as at least as important as the words, Galuppi&#x27;s (and Goldoni&#x27;s) more specific legacy to comic opera was the large-scale &quot;buffo&quot; finale to end the acts. Hitherto acts had ended in short choruses or ensembles, but the elaborate and substantial finales introduced by Galuppi and his librettist set the pattern for Haydn and Mozart.

Galuppi&#x27;s music for his comic operas is described by Luisi as &quot;largely syllabic … designed to enhance the intelligibility of the text … without impairing the fluidity of the melodic lines.&quot; In his &quot;opere serie&quot; he observed the convention of the &quot;da capo&quot; aria, but used it sparingly in his comic works. In performances of his serious operas, leading soloists would as a matter of course interpolate arias written by other composers: the &quot;opus integer&quot; – a complete work not to be tampered with – was not the rule in 18th-century &quot;opera seria&quot;.

===Sacred music===
Among the corpus of Galuppi&#x27;s authenticated sacred works are at least 284 works: 52 masses and movements pertaining to the mass, 73 settings of psalms and music for the offices, 8 motets, and 26 uncategorized works, including hymns, &quot;versetti&quot;, a setting of St. John&#x27;s Passion for women&#x27;s voices, and a &quot;Baccanale&quot; for the church of San Rocco. The largest repository of manuscripts outside of Italy is the Sächsische Landesbibliothek – Staats- und Universitätsbibliothek in Dresden, but manuscripts are also found in collections in Munich, Paris, Prague, Vienna, and New York, among others. In recent years Ines Burde, Franco Passadore, and Franco Rossi have all made progress toward a comprehensive catalogue of Galuppi&#x27;s sacred music, but a complete inventory is still out of reach due to the large number of lost or missing manuscripts, spurious attributions, and forgeries.

In his religious works, Galuppi mixed modern and antique styles. It was then the custom to incorporate into new church music the &quot;stile antico&quot; with smooth vocal lines in the tradition of Palestrina and a good deal of counterpoint. However, Galuppi applied the &quot;stile antico&quot; sparingly, and when he felt constrained to write contrapuntal music for the choir he would balance it with a bright modern style for the orchestral accompaniment. His masses and psalm settings for St Mark&#x27;s exploit all the resources available to a modern composer in the mid-18th century, with choir supported by an orchestra of strings and some or all of flutes, oboes, bassoons, horns, trumpets, and organ. In his &quot;tutti&quot; choral writing, Galuppi generally leaned toward syllabic settings, reserving the technically demanding melismatic passages for soloists.

Monson notes that the church music composed by Galuppi in Saint Petersburg had a lasting influence on Russian church music: &quot;His 15 &quot;a cappella&quot; works on Russian texts for the Orthodox liturgy proved to be a watershed. Their Italian, light contrapuntal style joined with native melodic idioms was continued by Traetta and Sarti and maintained by, among others, D.S. Bortnyans&#x27;ky, his pupil.&quot; Marina Ritzarev comments that the Italian Vincenzo Manfredini was Galuppi&#x27;s predecessor as Russian court composer, and may have paved the way for his successor&#x27;s innovations.

Several works long attributed to Galuppi by publishers were shown to be the work of Vivaldi. In 2003, a &quot;Nisi Dominus&quot; previously thought to be by Galuppi was reattributed to Vivaldi. The music of the latter, a generation earlier than Galuppi, had gone out of fashion after his death, and unscrupulous copyists and editors found that Galuppi&#x27;s name on the title page increased a work&#x27;s appeal. Three other works in the Saxon State Collection have also been reattributed from Galuppi to Vivaldi: a &quot;Beatus Vir&quot;, a &quot;Dixit Dominus&quot; and a &quot;Laetatus sum&quot;.

===Instrumental works===
Galuppi was much admired for his keyboard music. Few of his sonatas were published in his lifetime, but many survive in manuscript. Some of them follow the Scarlatti single-movement model; others are in the three-movement form later adopted by Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven and others.

Galuppi&#x27;s skill as keyboard player is well documented. Hillers &quot;Wöchentliche Nachrichten&quot; in 1772 made this mention of Galuppi&#x27;s reputation in Saint Petersburg: &quot;Chamber concerts were held every Wednesday in the antechamber of the imperial apartments, in order to enjoy the special style and fiery accuracy of the clavier playing of this great artist; thus did the virtuoso earn the overall approval of the court.&quot; It is no surprise that a number of Galuppi&#x27;s keyboard works should make it into print during his lifetime, including two sets of six sonatas, published in London as opus 1 (1756) and opus 2 (1759) respectively. Felix Raabe mentions the round number of 125 &quot;sonatas, toccatas, divertimenti and etudes&quot; for keyboard, based on Fausto Torrefranca&#x27;s 1909 thematic catalogue of Galuppi&#x27;s cembalo works. However, given some of the outrageous assertions on this topic that Torrefranca makes elsewhere (such as that the classical sonata form was created by Italian keyboard composers) the accuracy of this figure must be accepted only cautiously.

Galuppi&#x27;s seven experimental &quot;Concerti a quattro&quot; are particularly innovative chamber music pieces that foreshadow the development of the classical string quartet. Each of the concerti is a three-movement work for two violins, viola and cello that integrates the counterpoint of the sonata da chiesa with daring chromatic twists and harmonic detours that become more pronounced as the set progresses quartet by quartet. Innovations such as the chromatically raised 5th that Burney singled out in Galuppi&#x27;s arias of the 1740s appear, and many harmonic features of the late-classical period are foreshadowed, such as the final deceptive cadence in which an augmented sixth chord is substituted before the ultimate resolution.

Among other instrumental compositions by Galuppi, &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; lists sinfonias, overtures, trios and string quartets, and concerti for solo instruments and strings.

==Legacy==
Robert Browning&#x27;s poem &quot;A Toccata of Galuppi&#x27;s&quot; refers to Galuppi and his work. It is not known whether Browning was thinking of any one piece by Galuppi; in Galuppi&#x27;s time, the terms &quot;toccata&quot; and &quot;sonata&quot; were less clearly differentiated than they later became, and were used interchangeably. A number of pieces have been suggested as Browning&#x27;s inspiration, but as Charles van den Borren wrote in &quot;The Musical Times&quot;, &quot;every poet has the right to evade the prosaic minutiae of fact&quot;, and it is impossible to state with confidence that one Galuppi piece has more claim than another to be the inspiration for the poem. The poem inspired a 1989 setting, in modern idiom but with musical quotations from Galuppi&#x27;s works, by the composer Dominick Argento.

Browning&#x27;s poem was followed by a few revivals of Galuppi works, and the composer&#x27;s music was played at memorials for the poet, both in church and in the concert hall. But performances of Galuppi&#x27;s music remained sporadic. &quot;La diavolessa&quot; was revived for the first time at the Venice Music Festival in 1952; &quot;Il filosofo di campagna&quot; was revived in 1959, starring Ilva Ligabue and Renato Capecchi, and was staged at the Buxton Festival in 1985.

===Recordings===
From the late 20th century onwards an increasing number of Galuppi&#x27;s works have been committed to disc. Among the opera recordings on CD or DVD are &quot;Il caffè di campagna&quot; (2011), &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; (2010), &quot;La diavolessa&quot; (2004), &quot;Didone abbandonata&quot; (2007), &quot;Il filosofo di campagna&quot; (1959 and 2001), &quot;Gustavo primo re di Svezia&quot; (2005), &quot;Il mondo alla roversa&quot; (2007), and &quot;L&#x27;Olimpiade&quot; (2009). Three series of recordings of the keyboard sonatas have been launched, by Peter Seivewright on the Divine Art label, Matteo Napoli on Naxos. and on Radio Vatican Studios own label. In addition, Brilliant Classics released, in 2016, a two-CD set of keyboard sonatas performed on the organ by . Choral works put on CD include the 1766 &quot;Messa per San Marco&quot; (2007), a cantata, &quot;L&#x27;oracolo del Vaticano&quot;, to words by Goldoni (2004), and motets (2001).

<doc id="344000" wikidata="Q548694" url="?curid=344000" title="Fo Guang Shan">
<text>Fo Guang Shan (FGS) () is an international Chinese Mahāyāna Buddhist organization and monastic order based in Taiwan that practices Humanistic Buddhism whose roots are traced to the Linji school of Chan Buddhism. The headquarters, Fo Guang Shan Monastery, is located in Dashu District, Kaohsiung, and is the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. The organization is also one of the largest charity organizations in Taiwan. The organization&#x27;s counterpart for laypeople is known as the Buddha&#x27;s Light International Association.

Founded in 1967 by Hsing Yun, the order promotes Humanistic Buddhism and is known for its efforts in the modernization of Chinese Buddhism. The order is famous for its use of technology and its temples are often furnished with the latest equipment. Hsing Yun&#x27;s stated position for Fo Guang Shan is that it is an &quot;amalgam of all Eight Schools of Chinese Buddhism&quot; (). The Fo Guang Shan order has several associated colleges, among them Fo Guang University in Taiwan and University of the West in the United States, which offers undergraduate and postgraduate degrees in both Buddhist Studies and secular fields.

In Taiwan, Hsing Yun is popularly referred to as one of the &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot; and Fo Guang Shan is considered one of the &quot;Four Great Mountains&quot; or four major Buddhist organizations of Taiwanese Buddhism, along with Dharma Drum Mountain, Tzu Chi, and Chung Tai Shan.

== History ==
In 1967, Hsing Yun purchased more than 30 hectares in Dashu Township, Kaohsiung County as the site for the construction of a monastery. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on 16 May 1967.

Fo Guang Shan has embarked on many construction projects, including university buildings, shrines, rectories, retirement homes, and a cemetery. In 1975, Fo Guang Shan&#x27;s iconic 36-metre tall statue of Amitābha Buddha was consecrated. In 1981, 15 years after its establishment, the Great Hero Hall was built. During these times, many other Fo Guang Shan temples outside the order&#x27;s mother monastery were also built. In May 1997, Hsing Yun announced that he would close the mountain gate of Fo Guang Shan to the general public. His reason in closing the monastery was to give monastics the cloistered atmosphere they need for their Buddhist practice. In practice, many Chinese monasteries have also closed their mountain gates to give a cloistered atmosphere to the temple residents. At the end of 2000, then President Chen Shui-bian of the Republic of China (Taiwan) and government officials from Kaohsiung visited Fo Guang Shan, bringing with them the wish from their constituents that Fo Guang Shan reopen its mountain gate. After due consideration, Fo Guang Shan decided to reopen the monastery to some extent, thereby providing the public a place to practice Pure Land Buddhism. On top of its headquarters being the largest monastery in Taiwan, it has a network of over 300 branches throughout Taiwan.

In the 2010s, Fo Guang Shan began establishment in mainland China, focusing more on charity and Chinese cultural revival rather than Buddhist propagation in order to avoid conflict with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which opposes organized religion. Fo Guang Shan&#x27;s presence in China increased under the leadership of CCP general secretary Xi Jinping after he started a program to revive traditional Chinese faiths.

As of 2017, the order had over 1,000 monks and nuns, and over 1 million followers worldwide, with branches in fifty countries.

On 5 February 2023 founder Hsing Yun died at his residence at the age of 95 in Kaoshiung, Taiwan. His funeral took place on 12 February 2023 in the presence of Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and Premier Chen Chien-jen.

== Activities ==
Temples and organizations have been established in 173 countries throughout the world, and now encompasses more than 3,500 monastics. The organization emphasizes education and service, maintaining universities, Buddhist colleges, libraries, publishing houses, translation centres, Buddhist art galleries, teahouses, and mobile medical clinics. It has also established a children&#x27;s room, retirement home, high school and television station.

=== Social and medical programs ===
The social and medical programs of Fo Guang Shan include a free medical clinic with mobile units that serve remote villages, an annual winter relief program organized to distribute warm clothing and food supplies to the needy, a children&#x27;s and seniors&#x27; home, wildlife conservation areas to protect living creatures, and a cemetery for the care of the deceased. Fo Guang Shan&#x27;s social work focuses primarily on helping the poor in remote areas.

The organization also runs orphanages, homes for the elderly, and drug rehabilitation programs in prisons. Fo Guang Shan has also been involved in some international relief efforts.

=== Educational programs ===
The educational programs of Fo Guang Shan include four Buddhist colleges, three regular colleges, and various community colleges. The Fo Guang University was established in 2000. It focuses mainly on the humanities and social sciences. The Chinese Buddhist research institute is subdivided into four separate departments; a women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s college, and an international and English Buddhist studies department. Tuition fees and lodging are provided by Fo Guang Shan, free of charge. Other prominent universities the order has established include Nanhua University in Taiwan and the University of the West in the United States.

The organization also operates Pu-Men High School in Taipei, Jiun Tou Elementary and Junior High School, Humanities Primary and Junior High School, which provides regular curriculum for students. Fo Guang Shan also has nursery schools, kindergartens, and Sunday schools for children.

Along with Tzu Chi, Fo Guang Shan is the only major Buddhist organization in Taiwan that offers some form of strictly secular education, as opposed to purely religious.

In mainland China, Fo Guang Shan operates numerous cultural education programs and has built several libraries, even having gotten several books published through state controlled media.

=== Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum ===

Building plans for the Fo Guang Shan Buddha Museum (formerly called the Buddha Memorial Center) started with support from the Taiwanese government. The museum&#x27;s Jade Buddha Shrine is purported to hold tooth relics of the historic Buddha. The site is situated immediately adjacent to the main monastery and covers more than 100 hectares. The complex faces east and is built along a central axial line. Beyond the Welcoming Hall are eight Chinese-styled pagodas on either side of the main avenue leading up to the Bodhi Square, about which are statues of the Buddha&#x27;s main disciples and of the founders of the principal schools of Chinese Buddhism. The path leads onto the Memorial Hall, which holds several shrines including the Jade Buddha Shrine. Above the hall are four stupas that symbolize the Four Noble Truths. Standing behind but separate from it, there is an enormous seated metal Shakyamuni Buddha 108 meters high. The Center was opened at an international ceremony on 25 December 2011 and the first anniversary celebrated on Christmas Day 2012.

== Governance == 
=== Board of directors ===
In 1972, Hsing Yun established a nine-member council, known as the Fo Guang Shan Religious Affairs Committee, later renamed the Fo Guang Shan Board of Directors. These nine members govern and oversee the operations of the order through making appointments to various departments and other temples from within the order’s network. Each of the nine members are elected prior to the resignation, death, or the ending of a term of an abbot. Once elected by members of Fo Guang Shan, the votes are openly counted. The nine members then nominate their next abbot, who in practice was chosen by Hsing Yun personally. Eight members of the council are ordained monastics, and one is a non-voting layperson.

=== Abbots ===
Unlike a traditional Mahayana Buddhist monastery, where the incumbent abbot usually selects his successor, Fo Guang Shan directly elects an abbot to head the Order and its temple branches worldwide. The head of the FGS order and all of its branches is the abbot and chief executive of Fo Guang Shan Monastery. The abbot is the chairperson of the Board of Directors, serving a term of six years, with one reappointment by popular vote and, under exceptional circumstances, a second reappointment by two-thirds vote. The abbot is elected by all monastic members of Fo Guang Shan through public vote. 

Per tradition, the abbot-elect then begins to use their &quot;inner name&quot;, in place of his/her own dharma name, with the first character being &quot;Hsin&quot; (&quot;心&quot;, &quot;xin&quot;, or heart). In fact, all monastics of Fo Guang Shan have such a name, and several Elders also use theirs publicly. At the beginning of the year, the abbot-elect is inaugurated as the new director of Fo Guang Shan through a traditional dharma transmission ceremony, receiving the robe, bowl, khakkhara, and a copy of the FGS constitution. In the case of Venerable Hsin Bau’s inauguration in 2013, he and 72 other monastics received dharma transmission from Hsing Yun along with him.

Hsing Yun is the only abbot to have served as such for more than two terms and was not elected by the board of directors. In the case of Venerable Hsin Ping, he was also not officially elected, as he was Hsing Yun&#x27;s designated heir apparent. After Hsin Ping died of sudden illness in 1995, the vice director of Fo Guang Shan, Venerable Hsin Ting was immediately elevated to serve the remaining years of Hsin Ping&#x27;s term before he was elected to a term in his own right. Abbots have been elected according to FGS&#x27;s constitution since then.

As with Hsing Yun, emeritus abbots do not leave the order when they retire. They continue to make Dharma talks throughout the world and become elder teachers of the order in their later years. Following Hsing Yun’s death, current abbot Hsin Bau became the permanent guiding teacher of the order.

== Dharma propagation ==

Dharma programs of Fo Guang Shan include lectures given in prisons and factories; programs on television, radio, and online, large-scale public lectures in Taiwan and overseas, and the five precepts initiation given twice a year at the monastery.

All branches of Fo Guang Shan organize pilgrimages to bring devotees to the monastery from different parts of Taiwan and overseas. 

In mainland China the order focuses strongly on cultural exchange rather than religion to introduce Buddhist ideas, as proselytizing is illegal in China.

Fo Guang Shan&#x27;s approach to Dharma propagation focuses on simplifying Buddhism in order to make it more appealing to the masses. The organization is known for utilizing modern marketing techniques and preaching methods such as the use of laser shows and multimedia displays. Fo Guang Shan temples have no entrance fee, and do not allow many of the practices commonly found in other Chinese temples, such as fortune-telling or the presence of sales vendors. Despite the popularity of the organization, Fo Guang Shan has received criticism for being &quot;too focused on commercialism, expanding its membership base, and building large temples.&quot; (Schak and Hsiao)

<doc id="344003" wikidata="Q712634" url="?curid=344003" title="Hsing Yun">
<text>Hsing Yun (; 19 August 1927 – 5 February 2023) was a Chinese Buddhist monk, teacher, and philanthropist based in Taiwan. He was the founder of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist monastic order as well as the layperson-based Buddha&#x27;s Light International Association. Hsing Yun was considered a major proponent of Humanistic Buddhism and one of the most influential teachers of modern Taiwanese Buddhism. In Taiwan, he was popularly referred to as one of the &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot; of Taiwanese Buddhism, along with his contemporaries: Master Sheng-yen of Dharma Drum Mountain, Master Cheng Yen of Tzu Chi and Master Wei Chueh of Chung Tai Shan.

== Biography ==
Hsing Yun was born Lee Kuo-shen (pinyin: &quot;Lǐ Guóshēn&quot;) in 1927 in Jiangdu village (modern day Yangzhou), Jiangsu Province in the Republic of China. Hsing Yun&#x27;s first exposure to Buddhism came from his grandmother, a practicing Buddhist and meditator. Just prior to monastic life, he had accompanied his mother to Nanjing to search for his missing father but they were unsuccessful. In 1938 he entered the monastic life at the age of 12, ordaining as a novice at Qixia Temple under Zhikai, where he received the novice name Jinjue. He received the upasampadā vinaya precepts under Ruoshun at the same temple in 1941 and received the dharma name Wuche.

Shortly after taking the full precepts, Hsing Yun was first inspired by Buddhist modernism in 1945 while studying at Jiaoshan Buddhist College. There he learned about Buddhist teacher Taixu&#x27;s calls for reform in Buddhism and the Sangha. At a certain point, he adopted the name &quot;Hsing Yun&quot;—&quot;nebula&quot; in Chinese—to reflect his new philosophy. He fled mainland China to Taiwan in 1949 following the communist victory in the civil war but was arrested along with several other Buddhist monastics. Hsing Yun and the others were released after 23 days, and he then spent the next several years developing a large following and founding numerous temples. In 1966, Hsing Yun bought some land in Kaohsiung and started building a large monastery. After partial completion, the temple opened in 1967 and would later become the headquarters of the Fo Guang Shan Buddhist organization.

Hsing Yun&#x27;s Fo Guang Shan Buddhist order is a proponent of &quot;Humanistic&quot; Buddhism, and Hsing Yun himself was the abbot of the order until his resignation in 1985. Following his resignation, Hsing Yun founded the Buddha&#x27;s Light International Association (BLIA) as a layperson based Humanistic Buddhist organization.

Fo Guang Shan eventually grew to become one of the most significant social actors in Taiwan; the organization has established several schools and colleges, and runs orphanages, homes for the elderly, and drug rehabilitation programs in prisons. Fo Guang Shan has also been involved in some international relief efforts.

Fo Guang Shan entered mainland China in the early 21st century, focusing more on charity and Chinese cultural revival rather than Buddhist propagation in order to avoid conflict with the Chinese government, which opposes proselytizing. Fo Guang Shan&#x27;s presence in China increased under the premiership of General Secretary Xi Jinping after he started a program to revive traditional Chinese faiths. According to Hsing Yun, his goal in mainland China was to work with the mainland government to rebuild China&#x27;s culture following the destruction of the Cultural Revolution, rather than promote Buddhism in the mainland.

The headquarters of Fo Guang Shan in Kaohsiung is currently the largest Buddhist monastery in Taiwan. On top of that, the order has a network of over 300 branches throughout Taiwan, as well as several branches worldwide in at least fifty countries, including the United States, Australia, South Africa, and Brazil.

== Politics ==

In Taiwan, Hsing Yun was notable for his activity in political affairs, particularly as a supporter of the One-China policy as well as government legislation supported by the Kuomintang, and was criticized for his views by those in favor of Taiwan independence and by religious figures, as being overtly political and &quot;considerably far afield from traditional monastic concerns&quot;. During the 2008 presidential election, Hsing Yun publicly endorsed Kuomintang candidate Ma Ying-jeou. During the second World Buddhist Forum in 2009, Hsing Yun asserted that there are &quot;no Taiwanese&quot; and that Taiwanese &quot;are Chinese&quot;. During the 2016 presidential election campaign, Hsing Yun caused considerable comment when he compared DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen to the Chinese goddess Mazu, commenting that those traits would probably help Tsai be elected president, which she eventually was. To dispel rumors of party switching, Hsing Yun publicly gave his endorsement to KMT candidate Hung Hsiu-chu, who eventually withdrew from the race. Despite his Kuomintang partisanship, Hsing Yun was generally known to be respected by politicians of both parties. 

He encouraged reconciliation between China and the Dalai Lama, but tried hard to avoid causing rifts between him and his organisation and the Chinese government.

== Illness and death ==
On 26 December 2011, Hsing Yun suffered a minor ischemic stroke, his second in that year. In his older years Hsing Yun began suffering from numerous health issues, including diabetes and near blindness.
Hsing Yun died at his residence in Fo Guang Shan monastery on the afternoon of 5 February 2023, after years of unstable health. He was 95 (97 according to East Asian age reckoning), and had spent 85 years of his life as a monastic.

The next day his body was placed in a seated position inside a dome-like container in the shape of the Parinirvana Stupa in Kushinagar, India. His body was placed upon a dais inside the Cloud Dwelling Building where he lay in state for seven days while visitors paid their respects. 

Hsing Yun&#x27;s funeral was held on 13 February, with President Tsai Ing-wen, Premier Chen Chien-jen, KMT chairman Eric Chu, and Kaohsiung mayor Chen Chi-mai in attendance. His remains were cremated at Daxian Temple in nearby Tainan, Baihe District. His urn was returned to Fo Guang Shan&#x27;s Longevity Memorial Park the same evening. His ashes were interred inside the Patriarch&#x27;s Shrine nearby the Fo Guang Shan monastery campus.

== Awards ==
In 2008, Hsing Yun was awarded the honorary Doctor of Humane Letters (L.H.D.) from Whittier College.

<text>The Buddhist Tzu Chi Charity Foundation () is a Taiwanese international humanitarian and nongovernmental organization. Its work includes medical aid, disaster relief, and environmental work. 

The foundation was founded on 14 April 1966 by Cheng Yen, a Taiwanese Buddhist nun, as a Buddhist humanitarian organization, initially funded by housewives. Tzu Chi expanded its services over time, opening a free medical clinic in 1972 and building its first hospital in 1986. The organization underwent rapid expansion in the late 1980s and early 1990s, coinciding with a surge of popularity in Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan. In the 1990s, the organization started major international disaster relief efforts, including the construction of new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship. 

Today, Tzu Chi has a policy of being secular in its humanitarian work, with Buddhist teachings being integrated into its practices for volunteers. Cheng Yen is also considered to be one of the &quot;Four Heavenly Kings&quot; of Taiwanese Buddhism, with Tzu Chi itself being considered to be one of the &quot;Four Great Mountains&quot;, of Taiwanese Buddhist organizations, along with Fo Guang Shan, Dharma Drum Mountain, and Chung Tai Shan. 

Tzu Chi has a special consultative status at the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It is also a co-chair of the UN Inter-agency Task Force on Religion and Sustainable Development Multi-Faith Advisory Council for 2022-2023. The foundation has several sub-organizations, such as the Tzu Chi International Medical Association and the Tzu Chi Collegiate Youth Association (Tzu Ching). Tzu Chi volunteers and relief workers are known for their blue and white uniforms, which are known as &quot;blue sky, white clouds&quot; in Chinese (). As of May 2024, the organization had over 10 million members worldwide across 68 countries and regions with relief efforts reaching 136 countries and regions around the world.

==History==
The Tzu Chi Foundation was founded as a charity organization with Buddhist origins by the Buddhist nun Cheng Yen in 1966 in Hualien, Taiwan after Cheng Yen saw the humanitarian work of Christian missionaries in Taiwan in the post World War II period. She was inspired by her master and mentor, the late Yin Shun, a proponent of Humanistic Buddhism, who exhorted her to work &quot;for Buddhism and for all sentient beings&quot;. The organization began with a motto of &quot;instructing the rich and saving the poor&quot; as a group of thirty housewives who saved 50 NT cents (US$0.02) every day and stored them in bamboo coin banks to donate to needy families.

Tzu Chi experienced modest growth in the first two decades of its establishment, it grew to 293 members in 1968 and by 1986 had just 8,000 members. The foundation gradually expanded its services since starting as a group of thirty housewives, raising money for disaster relief after a small fire in 1970 that destroyed 43 buildings and opening its first free medical clinic in 1972. In 1986 the foundation established its first hospital in Hualien City.

With the surge in popularity of Humanistic Buddhism in Taiwan in the late 1980s and 1990s, and the publicity from fundraising to build its first hospital, Tzu Chi enjoyed a rapid expansion in membership alongside several other major Taiwanese Buddhist organizations during this time. From 1987 to 1991, Tzu Chi membership doubled in size each year, by 1994, it boasted a membership of 4 million members. Tzu Chi&#x27;s expanded its aid work to the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1991 during the eastern China floods. In 1993, the foundation created a bone marrow registry, an effort that eventually caused Taiwan to alter its bone marrow laws, and organized a nationwide volunteer program for Taiwan in 1996. In the early 2000s, it expanded its services into recycling and environmental issues.

The foundation achieved much media attention in Taiwan in 2015 with a plan to develop a plot of land in Neihu District into a disaster relief center and cultural park which led to the destruction of parts of the Neihu conservation zone. The incident led to widespread critical coverage of Tzu Chi by the Taiwanese media, and scrutiny into its finances. During this time several unsubstantiated reports circulated in Taiwan about the foundation, including unfounded claims that the foundation invested in tobacco and weapons companies. Despite authorities not finding any illicit activity with its finances, calls for greater transparency were made.

Tzu Chi has grown to become a significant actor in civil society, Tzu Chi is not only the largest Buddhist organization in Taiwan, but also Taiwan&#x27;s largest owner of private land. As of May 2024, the organization was estimated to have approximately 10 million members worldwide, and chapters in 68 countries.

== Organization ==

The Four Major Missions of Tzu Chi are &quot;Charity&quot;, &quot;Medicine&quot;, &quot;Education&quot;, and &quot;Humanistic Culture&quot;, as highlighted by the official motto, or concept of &quot;Four Missions, Eight Footprints&quot; (). The Eight Footprints are an extension of the Four Missions with the addition of &quot;International Relief&quot;, &quot;Bone Marrow Donation&quot;, &quot;Environmental Protection&quot; and &quot;Community Volunteerism&quot;.

The official website for the organization states that the organization started with Charity, and then extended its aims to include Medicine, Education and Culture. Its stated goal is to promote &quot;sincerity, integrity, trust, and honesty&quot;.

Tzu Chi is notably distinct from the other Four Great Mountains in respect to three main unique characteristics. First of all, the founder of the organization is a female. Secondly, the founder is not a Buddhist scholar who promotes a specific interpretation of Buddhism nor started any kind of religious movement. And finally, the organization is officially a charitable organization and Tzu Chi itself focuses primarily on humanitarianism and community service rather than Buddhist spiritual development.

As a Buddhist nun, Master Cheng Yen ordains only nuns, who live at Tzu Chi&#x27;s headquarters. Tzu Chi nuns follow the monastic rules for Buddhist nuns (&quot;bhikkhuni&quot;) but are not ordained in the traditional communal ritual typically done at Buddhist monasteries. Many Buddhist groups consider the lack of a traditional ordination as disqualifying Tzu Chi nuns as official Buddhist nuns, although scholars have noted that Tzu Chi members themselves largely don&#x27;t care about this. Tzu Chi also has a special status between layperson and monastic known as &quot;qin xiou shi&quot; or &#x27;pure practitioners&#x27;. This status is available to both men and women and consists of laypeople who take most of the monastic vows but do not shave their heads like monastics do and take on leadership roles within Tzu Chi.

===Logo===
Consisting of a ship that also simultaneously bears the lotus fruit and flower, the Tzu Chi logo symbolizes that the world can be made a better place by planting good karmic seeds. Followers believe that these &quot;seeds&quot; are required for flowers to bloom and bear fruit, or in other words, that a better society can be created with good actions and pure thoughts. The ship represents Tzu Chi steering a ship of compassion, representing their goal in saving all beings that suffer, while the Eight Petals represent the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism, which Tzu Chi uses as their guide.

===Tzu Chi&#x27;s Ten Precepts===
Tzu Chi also has its own customized version of the Buddhist Precepts as formulated by Cheng Yen. The Ten Precepts of Tzu Chi are:
# No killing
# No stealing
# No fornication
# No lying
# No drinking
# No smoking or use of narcotics or betel nuts
# No gambling
# Practice filial piety and develop pleasant manners and speech
# Abide by traffic laws
# No participation in political activities or demonstrations

Cheng Yen developed these rules based on the new needs of modern society.

== Medical mission ==
One of the first major initiatives Tzu Chi took part in was the &quot;Tzu Chi Medical Mission&quot;. This effort was inspired in 1970 after Cheng Yen noticed a link between poverty and illness after spending six years among the poor of eastern Taiwan.

Tzu Chi&#x27;s first medical outreach occurred in 1972 when a free clinic was opened in Hualien.

=== Tzu Chi Hospital ===

The Foundation established its first Tzu Chi Hospital in Hualien in 1986. A 600-bed general hospital had been planned in 1979 to service the impoverished eastern coast of Taiwan. A primary concern for Cheng Yen was that the area was isolated and the people in the area were cut off from aid during disasters. Despite setbacks both in funding for the hospital and finding an acceptable site. Ground was broken on the site eventually chosen on 5 February 1983 at a ceremony officiated by then Provincial Governor (later President) Lee Teng-Hui. However, two weeks after ground was broken, Cheng Yen received a notice from the military telling her that the property was needed by the military and that construction would have to stop.

A new site was obtained for the hospital with help from Minister of the Interior Lin Yang-kang. A second groundbreaking occurred on 2 April 1984 at the new site. The publicity of the project to build the hospital led to a significant increase in the number of Tzu Chi volunteers, with Tzu Chi membership increasing six-fold by the time of the second groundbreaking since the announcement of the project in 1979. Construction was completed and the hospital opened on 17 August 1986.

Tzu Chi has since built hospitals in Yuli, Hualien County; Dalin, Chiayi County; Guanshan, Taitung County; Tanzi District, Taichung City; and Xindian, New Taipei City. It has also a hospital in Jakarta, Indonesia.

In addition to building hospitals the Tzu Chi College of Nursing was founded on 17 September 1989 in Hualien in order to address the shortage of nurses on Taiwan&#x27;s east coast, with a focus on serving the poor. It was the first private nursing college in Taiwan to waive tuition for selected courses, in addition to providing full scholarships for qualified Taiwan aborigine students.

=== Bone marrow registry ===

Tzu Chi created the Tzu Chi Bone Marrow Registry, in 1993 after a young follower of Cheng Yen was diagnosed with Leukemia. Cheng Yen referred to the concept of bone marrow donation as a way to &quot;save a life without harming yourself.&quot; This effort to register bone marrow donors from an organization with such massive membership like Tzu Chi caused Taiwan to change its laws regarding organ donations. This registry became a division of the new Tzu Chi Stem Cells Center, which was founded to improve research and treatment capabilities. By 2007 the program had saved the lives of almost 1,500 people in 25 different countries. By 2008, Tzu Chi had registered more than 307,657 bone marrow donors.

=== College of Medicine ===
Tzu Chi established the Tzu Chi College of Medicine in 1994. This college became Tzu Chi University in 2000. In the meantime Cheng-Yen appealed to the Taiwanese public to donate their bodies for medical training, attempting to dispel traditional taboos in the process. As a result of this appeal, public support for body donations surged nationwide. Consequently, at the Tzu Chi College of Medicine, there is one body for every four students to study as opposed to one body for every two hundred students at one school, the ratio is the lowest in the country.

In 1995, the Athletic Drug Testing Center was established at the request of the Ministry of Education and went into operation in 1996 during a national sporting event when gold medal winners were tested for banned drugs.

== Disaster relief ==

Tzu Chi is most well-known for its disaster relief efforts worldwide. In carrying out these projects, Tzu Chi has a policy that forbids public gatherings for the sole purpose of specific political, economic, and religious groups. Tzu Chi volunteers are not to discuss business, politics, or preach religion while giving aid. One of the most iconic attributes of Tzu Chi disaster relief efforts is that volunteers not only provide short term aid but also partake in long-term projects to rebuild the communities affected. Tzu Chi often builds new homes, schools, hospitals, and places of worship (including churches and mosques for non-Buddhists) for victims following a disaster.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===
Tzu Chi&#x27;s involvement with providing aid in the People&#x27;s Republic of China was difficult at first. Cheng Yen has referred to relief work in China as &quot;Building a Bridge of Love.&quot; The initial problems with providing aid in China involved the political tensions between Taiwan and China and Communist China&#x27;s disdain for religion. In Taiwan, it was difficult to convince Taiwanese to help the Chinese, and in China, it was difficult to convince government officials normally wary of religious organizations to accept Tzu Chi.

Tzu Chi&#x27;s involvement in the People&#x27;s Republic of China began in 1991, when it undertook relief operations after severe floods hit central and eastern China. The aid provided to China was Tzu Chi&#x27;s first major effort at international relief aid, it also allowed Tzu Chi to develop its principles of delivering aid and establish relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Since then, the foundation has built schools, nursing homes and entire villages, including infrastructure in poor inland areas, such as Guizhou province.

Over the past twenty years, Tzu Chi expanded their humanitarian work and influence to 28 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions in China. Projects include relief work after major disasters like the Sichuan earthquake; distribution of rice and goods to the poor; social programs like regular visits to the needy; scholarship programs to the less privileged students; medical missions like bone marrow donation and free clinics; and educational outings of environmental protection and recycling activities.

In March 2008, Tzu Chi became the first organization represented by a non-Mainland resident to be registered with the Chinese government.

In the aftermath of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake, Tzu Chi sent food, blankets and medical aid to survivors, while volunteers in China set out for the disaster zone. Tzu Chi was also one of the few organizations the Chinese government allowed to bring in aid workers from overseas to join the relief effort. With the motto &quot;First to arrive, last to leave,&quot; the organization has continued with long-term reconstruction work in Sichuan, and by 2010, had rebuilt thirteen schools in the region.

In August 2010, Tzu Chi became the first overseas NGO to receive permission from the Ministry of Civil Affairs to set up a nationwide charity foundation. Normally, overseas organizations must register with the Ministry of Commerce as businesses. The foundation received the China Charity Award from the Ministry of Civil Affairs for its work in charity and promoting the well-being of society in 2006 and again in 2008.

=== Republic of China (Taiwan) ===
In 1996, Tzu Chi started a nationwide volunteer program where volunteers are registered according to where they live with the goal of &quot;neighbors helping neighbors.&quot; The community volunteer initiative began as a disaster relief effort started in response to Typhoon Herb.
Tzu Chi volunteers were one of the first responders in the Chi-Chi earthquake (known in Taiwan as the 921 earthquake) of 1999, mobilizing within 2 hours to provide thousands of sets of food and relief supplies to victims. The volunteers followed a strict system of organization where commissioners and teams of volunteers were assigned to specific townships, and teams were assigned to specific areas within the townships. This organizational structure was what allowed the volunteers to be mobilized so quickly and efficiently. The earthquake prompted Cheng Yen to start &quot;Project Hope&quot;, a long-term project to rebuild 51 schools for those effected by the disaster. Tzu Chi raised more relief funds for the earthquake than any other religious organization in Taiwan, raising nearly sixty times as much funds for the relief effort than the next largest fundraiser, Fo Guang Shan. The 921 earthquake was credited for prompting Tzu Chi to create a disaster relief coordination center at its headquarters to organize quicker disaster response services.

Tzu Chi was also active in providing aid after Typhoon Nepartak struck Taiwan in 2016, providing relief supplies, rebuilding communities, and providing medical care through its medical support staff in Taimali, Taiwan which have been holding medical outreach free clinics in the area since 2006.

=== Outside Greater China ===
Tzu Chi has participated in numerous other relief projects around the world, including sending teams to Indonesia and Sri Lanka in the wake of the tsunami resulting from the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake as well as to Pakistan after the 2005 earthquake in their northern mountains. The later was done despite poor relations between the governments of the two countries.

Following the disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in 2014, Tzu Chi immediately sent their specially trained teams to Beijing and Malaysia to provide trauma relief and emotional support to families and others affected by the tragedy, in accordance with a 2007 agreement with Malaysia Airlines to fulfill the need for emergency response support services.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, the organization announced on 18 November 2012 a donation of $10 million in the form of $300 and $600 Visa debit cards to those affected in the New York and New Jersey area. Volunteers handed out these cards in parts of Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. Tzu Chi was also active in providing aid following the 2015 Nepal earthquake. Tzu Chi was also active in relief efforts during Hurricane Harvey in 2017, the group provided aid, as well as cash gifts for those who helped the community during the disaster. In 2016, the organization distributed in the United States over $2 million in cash cards to disaster victims. As of 2015, Tzu Chi has provided disaster relief aid to over 85 countries worldwide.

During the Covid pandemic, the Tzu Chi foundation continued its disaster relief work, providing resources to families struggling with poverty. For example, after months of searching, in December 2020 the Tzu Chi found a location for a pandemic-related food distribution event, partnering with the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and the Echame La Mano Pura Vida Foundation to provide food, water, and other essentials. The foundation has also had pre-pandemic humanitarian work in the United States, such as their Happy Campus Program, Mobile Food Pantry Program, and educational programs.

Following the 2023 Monterey Park shooting, in the United States, Tzu Chi volunteers went to relay information in Mandarin and Cantonese to victims’ families, of whom many were Taiwanese Americans, and assist in funeral arrangements. Tzu Chi volunteers were also recruited by the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office to translate personal information, and link families’ needs to government resources.

==Global presence==
Tzu Chi&#x27;s headquarters is located in Xincheng Township, Hualien County, Taiwan.
===Portfolios===
Tzu Chi&#x27;s portfolios include case management, medical, educational and disaster relief.

The organization builds and operates many hospitals and schools, with outreach efforts that range from visits to nursing homes to providing bone marrow surgery, as well as offering items such as washing machines to struggling single mothers. The television &quot;Da Ai&quot; network operates with its own news and television programming. Chinese schools have also been established abroad, such as in Australia and the United States, which, apart from teaching Chinese and sign language, also guides students in ways of compassion and community service.
===Recycling===
A significant fraction of funds raised by Tzu Chi revolves around environmentally friendly goals in encouraging the recycling of items such as water bottles as well as using reusable items or reusing items to reduce waste.

As of 2014, the foundation operates over 5,600 recycling stations. One of the foundation&#x27;s projects is the recycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic bottles for the production of textiles. The project, which was started in 2006, collects PET plastic bottles and recycles them into cloth. The project is handled by the Tzu Chi sponsored nonprofit Da Ai Technology Co. The products are all designed by members of the paid staff and recycled plastic bottles make up about half of the raw materials for the products. The project collects about 2,000 tons of plastic bottles each year. Tzu Chi&#x27;s recycling centers have been a source of criticism however, with critics arguing that Tzu Chi&#x27;s recycling efforts result in lost income for poor trash collectors.

Since 2007, the foundation has produced over 460,000 polyester blankets out of recycled plastic bottles, many of which have been distributed as part of Tzu Chi&#x27;s disaster relief programs throughout the world. Other items made with the recycled resins include thermal underwear, T-shirts, hospital bed sheets, medical gowns, suitcases, stuffed animals and uniforms for Tzu Chi volunteers. While the project relies on recycled plastic bottles for the production of its products, its leaders have stated that it is still best for people to not use plastic bottles at all.
===Dharma===
The teachings of the Buddha and founder Cheng Yen play a core role in the workings of the organization. &quot;Tzu Chi Day&quot; is celebrated every year on the second Sunday of May which generally coincides with the Buddha&#x27;s birthday (Vesak Day), and Mother&#x27;s Day (as recognised in Taiwan). Celebrations during Tzu Chi Day include the bathing of the Buddha ceremony, the tradition&#x27;s message is that it is the people that need cleansing before they become better individuals. Tzu Chi promotes many of the teachings of Buddhism, in particular the Lotus Sutra, 
and also has sutra adaptations through the use of sign language on the Sutra of the Infinite Meanings, which teaches that sentient existence is challenging and filled with disasters in the absence of observations of virtue, as well as the Water Repentance Sutra, which advocates and symbolizes the need to repent karmic transgressions. Despite these activities, Tzu Chi has a policy of not proselytizing religion directly at its public activities. Apart from not proselytizing, Tzu Chi&#x27;s adaptation of Buddhist principles is apolitical.

In disaster regions where a particular religious faith is prominent, Tzu Chi regularly works together with local religious organizations. Tzu Chi has re-built mosques and churches in disaster zones where faith plays an important role in local society.

Tzu Chi nuns (bhikkhunis) do not rely on donations for their livelihood, something uncommon among most Buddhist orders. In earlier days, the nuns sustained themselves by farming, weaving and other handicrafts. More recently, they sustained themselves by the manufacture of electrical circuit breakers and other products.

===International branches===
Tzu Chi has volunteers in 68 countries and regions including USA, Canada, Australia, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and various locations in Asia, Europe and Africa.
===Television and satellite network===
On 17 August 1999, a television network was formed in Taiwan under the Tzu Chi Foundation of the Culture of Communication, Inc with the slogan &quot;Love to make the world light up&quot;. Formally known as Da Ai Television, the network grew into a global broadcasting presence with offerings of a radio service and three television channels, including a channel in Indonesia.

===Jing Si Books &amp; Café===
Jing Si Books &amp; Café is a chain of nonprofit bookstores and cafes operated by Tzu Chi offering Tzu Chi merchandise and publications by Cheng Yen.

==Youth==
The Tzu Chi Collegiate Association (; abbreviated ) is the foundation&#x27;s college youth organization, and was officially established in Taiwan on 31 May 1992. With chapters at universities worldwide, its goal is to allow university students to be involved with Tzu Chi&#x27;s activities. Tzu Ching volunteers are given the opportunity to participate in large-scale events such as disaster relief and international NGO conferences such as the annual UN Youth Assembly. Cheng Yen encourages the Tzu Ching volunteers to actively communicate with each other, with the goals of learning and improving. Each year an international Tzu Ching officer training retreat camp is held at the foundation headquarters in Hualien.

Tzu Shao () is the Tzu Chi branch for youths under the age of 18. Young volunteers in this group do community services such as helping out at free clinics, soup kitchens, and nursing homes.

==Year-end Blessings Ceremonies==
Each year, Tzu Chi conducts a Year-End Blessings Ceremony attended by Tzu Chi workers, volunteers and members in January or February, where Cheng Yen distributes blessings in the form of red packets that embosses a coin in Taiwanese currency together with auspicious words for the coming year.

<doc id="344016" wikidata="Q1642740" url="?curid=344016" title="John Galt (novelist)">
<text>John Galt (; 2 May 1779 – 11 April 1839) was a Scottish novelist, entrepreneur, and political and social commentator. Galt has been called the first political novelist in the English language, due to being the first novelist to deal with issues of the Industrial Revolution.

Galt was the first superintendent of the Canada Company (1826–1829). The company was formed to populate a part of what is now Southern Ontario (then known as Upper Canada) in the first half of the 19th century; it was later called &quot;the most important single attempt at settlement in Canadian history&quot;.

In 1829, Galt was recalled to Great Britain for mismanagement of the Canada Company (particularly incompetent bookkeeping), and was later jailed for failing to pay his son&#x27;s tuition. Galt&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography&quot;, published in London in 1833, includes a discussion of his life and work in Upper Canada.

He was the father of Sir Alexander Tilloch Galt of Montreal, Quebec, one of the leading Fathers of Confederation from Lower Canada.

==Life==
Born on 2 May 1779 in the seaport of Irvine in Ayrshire, Galt was the son of a shipmaster and trader. Every year, Galt&#x27;s whole family moved seasonally to Greenock. He grew up tall but rather delicate, and spent a lot of time listening to the &quot;marvellous narrations&quot; of some elderly women who lived in the close behind his grandmother&#x27;s house. After tutoring at home, he joined Irvine Grammar public school in 1787, becoming a lifetime friend of his schoolfellow Henry Eckford. Around 1789, Galt&#x27;s father owned and commanded a West Indiaman trading with Jamaica, and had a house built in Greenock. The family settled there, and at school Galt became close friends with classmates William Spence, a budding mathematician, and James Park, who spurred Galt&#x27;s enthusiasm for writing and poetry. Their education, well suited to commerce, covered penmanship, arithmetic, French, geography, astronomy and mathematics, including navigation using a sextant on local hills in 1794.

===Career, early publications===

It was usual in Greenock for lads starting careers in commerce to first improve their penmanship by copying entries in the books of the custom house, so Galt and Park were &quot;desked&quot; there for a few months. At the age of 17, Galt became a junior clerk at a Greenock firm of merchants. He was a &quot;voracious reader&quot; using the town&#x27;s subscription library. With his friends, he went long walks, wrote essays and stories, some of which were published in Constable&#x27;s &quot;The Scots Magazine&quot;, and founded a Literary and Debating Society. In early 1804, at the Tontine Hotel, this hosted James Hogg, who described the discussion as &quot;much above what I had ever been accustomed to hear&quot;.

Though seemingly doing well, Galt &quot;felt at Greenock as if I was never in my proper element&quot;, and was restless about &quot;the narrowness of my prospects&quot;. Incensed by an abusive letter, he pursued its author to Leith and got a written apology, then on return told his father and the merchants&#x27; firm he intended to quit Greenock. Galt made preparations and, accompanied by his father, took post chaise and mail coach to London in May 1804. Letters of introduction got him, at most, dinner invitations. In 1805 he used an advance of his father&#x27;s patrimony to fund a partnership with a factor. In 1809 he began studying law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn.

During a subsequent trip to Europe, where he was commissioned by a merchant firm to establish trade agreements, Galt met and befriended Lord Byron in Gibraltar. He traveled with Byron and his companion, John Hobhouse, 1st Baron Broughton, to Malta. He met them again in Greece. Parting company, Galt continued alone to Constantinople, Adrianople and then Sofia. He returned to Greenock via Ireland. He then embarked to London to pursue business plans, but these did not come to fruition and he took to writing. Galt wrote an account of his travels, which met with moderate success. Decades later, he would also publish the first full biography of Lord Byron. He also published the first biography of the painter Benjamin West, &quot;The Life and Studies of Benjamin West&quot; (1816, expanded 1820).

In 1813, Galt attempted to establish a Gibraltarian trading company, in order to circumvent Napoleon&#x27;s embargo on British trade; however, Wellington&#x27;s victory in Spain made this no longer necessary. Galt then returned to London and married Elizabeth Tilloch, daughter of Alexander Tilloch. They had three boys, John Galt Jr (1814–1866), Thomas Galt (1815–1901), and Alexander Tilloch Galt (1817–1893). In 1815, he became Secretary of the Royal Caledonian Asylum in London. He also privately consulted in several business ventures.

Galt started to submit articles to &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in late 1819, and in March 1829 he sent Blackwood the publishers the plan for &quot;The Ayrshire legatees&quot;.

Concentrating on his writing for the next several years, Galt lived at times in London, Glasgow, Edinburgh and elsewhere, writing fiction and a number of school texts under the pseudonym Reverend T. Clark. Around 1821 he moved his family from Greenock to Eskgrove near Musselburgh. In addition to moving his residence frequently during this period, Galt also switched publishers several times, moving from &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; to Oliver and Boyd and then back again. In 1821 &quot;Annals of the parish&quot; was published as were two instalments of &quot;The steam boat&quot; and he started work on the novel &quot;Sir André Wylie&quot;. &quot;Annals of the parish&quot; established Galt&#x27;s reputation overnight. &quot;Sir Andrew Wylie&quot; was published in 1822.

===The Canada Company===

In 1824, Galt was appointed secretary of the Canada Company, a charter company established to aid in the colonization of the Huron Tract in Upper Canada along the eastern shore of Lake Huron. After the company was incorporated by royal charter on 19 August 1826, Galt traveled across the Atlantic on the man-of-war HMS &quot;Romney&quot;, arriving at New York City and then traveling by road. Sadly, soon after arriving, word was sent that his mother had suffered a stroke. He returned to her (in Musselburgh) in 1826 and she died a few months later. He returned to Canada in 1826. While in Canada, Galt lived in York in Upper Canada (now Ontario), but located the headquarters of the Canada Company at Guelph, a town he also founded in 1827. Later that year, he co-founded the town of Goderich with Tiger Dunlop. The community of Galt, Ontario, was named after him.

During his tenure with the Canada Company, Galt ran afoul of several colonial authorities, including Sir Peregrine Maitland, who was Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada at the time. He was heavily criticised by his employers for his lack of basic accounting skills and failure to carry out their established policies. This resulted in his dismissal and recall to Great Britain in 1829.

===Return, debts and health problems===
Soon after his return to Great Britain, he spent several months in King&#x27;s Bench Prison for failure to pay debts. One of Galt&#x27;s last novels, &quot;The Member&quot;, has political corruption as its central theme.

In 1831 he moved to Barn Cottage in Old Brompton.

Galt&#x27;s three sons returned to Canada in 1833. The eldest, John Jr., would be appointed Collector of Customs and Registrar of Deeds at Goderich and become part of the Colborne Clique. His youngest son Alexander became one of the fathers of Confederation and Canada&#x27;s first minister of finance.

Despite failing health (following a trip over a tree root whilst in Canada), Galt was involved in another colonial business venture, the British American Land Company, which was formed to develop lands in the Eastern Townships of Lower Canada (now Quebec). Galt served as secretary but was forced to resign in December 1832 because of his health. By this stage his spinal injury was not only crippling him but also affecting his speech and handwriting.

===Return to Scotland===

In 1834 he moved to Edinburgh following the publishing of his two-volume &quot;Autobiography&quot; in 1833. Galt here met the travel writer Harriet Pigott. Pigott persuaded Galt to edit her &quot;Records of Real Life in the Palace and the Cottage&quot;. She received some criticism for this as it was suspected that she was just taking advantage of Galt. However, her unfinished biography of him which is in the Bodleian Library implies that it was more of mutual respect than her critics allowed. &quot;Records of Real Life in the Palace and the Cottage&quot; had an introduction by Galt, and this three-volume work was published in 1839.
He retired to his old home in Greenock in August 1834 following the departure of three of his sons to Canada. Finding the accommodation unsuitable he lived temporarily in Gourock before moving in December 1834 to a more comfortable house, sited in central Greenock on Westburn Street, at its corner with West Blackhall Street. He stayed there with his wife and sister. Galt died on 11 April 1839, and was buried in the family tomb of his parents in the New Burying Ground in Greenock (now called the Old Greenock Cemetery or Inverkip Street Cemetery).

==Commemoration==
In Greenock, John Galt is commemorated by the John Galt memorial fountain on the Esplanade, and by a plaque at the old cemetery where he is buried. Sheltered housing (for seniors) built next to the cemetery in 1988, on the site of the old Greenock Royal Infirmary, is named John Galt House in his honour. 

He is also commemorated in Makars&#x27; Court, outside The Writers&#x27; Museum, Lawnmarket, Edinburgh. The paving slab is engraved with the Scots language words &quot;birr and smeddum&quot; (vigour and liveliness) quoting his 1821 book &quot;Annals of the Parish&quot;. 

The city of Galt, Ontario was named after John Galt, but was absorbed into Cambridge, Ontario in 1973. His original home in Guelph, known as the &quot;Priory&quot; (built 1827-1828), stood on the banks of the Speed River near the current River Run Centre for performing arts. The building later became the first Canadian Pacific Railway station in the city; the conversion was completed in 1888. The building was no longer required by the Canadian Pacific Railway which built a new station in 1910. A photograph from 1914 depicts it as boarded up. In spite of attempts by various individuals in Guelph to save the structure, it was torn down in 1926.

A historical plaque commemorates Galt&#x27;s role with the Canada Company in populating the Huron Tract, calling it &quot;the most important single attempt at settlement in Canadian history&quot;. In 2006, the community of Guelph proclaimed the first Monday in August, &quot;John Galt Day&quot;.

<text>Laura Nyro ( ; born Laura Nigro; October 18, 1947 – April 8, 1997) was an American songwriter and singer. She achieved critical acclaim with her own recordings, particularly the albums &quot;Eli and the Thirteenth Confession&quot; (1968) and &quot;New York Tendaberry&quot; (1969), and had commercial success with artists such as Barbra Streisand and the 5th Dimension recording her songs. Wider recognition for her artistry was posthumous, while her contemporaries such as Elton John idolized her. She was praised for her emotive three-octave mezzo-soprano voice.

Between 1968 and 1970, a number of artists had hits with her songs: the 5th Dimension with &quot;Blowing Away&quot;, &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;, &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot;, &quot;Sweet Blindness&quot;, and &quot;Save the Country&quot;; Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears and Peter, Paul and Mary with &quot;And When I Die&quot;; Three Dog Night and Maynard Ferguson with &quot;Eli&#x27;s Comin&#x27;&quot;; and Barbra Streisand with &quot;Stoney End&quot;, &quot;Time and Love&quot;, and &quot;Hands off the Man (Flim Flam Man)&quot;. Nyro&#x27;s best-selling single was her recording of Carole King&#x27;s and Gerry Goffin&#x27;s &quot;Up on the Roof&quot;.

Nyro was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2010, and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Life and career==
===Early life===

Nyro was born Laura Nigro in The Bronx, New York City, the daughter of Louis Nigro, a piano tuner and jazz trumpeter, and Gilda (née Mirsky) Nigro, a bookkeeper. Laura had a younger brother, Jan Nigro, who has become a children&#x27;s musician. Laura was of Russian Jewish and Polish Jewish descent, with Italian American ancestry from her paternal grandfather. Her father gave her the name &quot;Laura&quot;, after hearing the title theme of the 1944 film &quot;Laura&quot;. Nigro and his family often insisted that their surname be pronounced as instead of to avoid racial connotations. However, after Laura left high school, she chose her own surname, &quot;Nyro&quot;, having it pronounced as .

&quot;I&#x27;ve created my own little world, a world of music, since I was five years old&quot;, Nyro told &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine in 1970, adding that music provided, for her, a means of coping with a difficult childhood: &quot;I was never a bright and happy child.&quot; As a child, she taught herself piano, read poetry, and listened to her mother&#x27;s records by Leontyne Price, Nina Simone, Judy Garland, Billie Holiday, and classical composers such as Debussy and Ravel. She composed her first songs at age eight. With her family, she spent summers in the Catskills, where her father played trumpet at resorts. She credited the Sunday school at the New York Society for Ethical Culture with providing the basis of her education; she also attended Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Music &amp; Art.

Nyro was close to her aunt and uncle, artists Theresa Bernstein and William Meyerowitz, who helped support her education and early career.

While attending Joseph Wade Junior High School in the Bronx, Nyro performed an early version of the song &quot;Eli&#x27;s Coming&quot; in music class to prove to the teacher that rock and roll &quot;wasn&#x27;t junk&quot;.

While in high school, she sang with a group of friends in subway stations and on street corners. She said, &quot;I would go out singing, as a teenager, to a party or out on the street, because there were harmony groups there, and that was one of the joys of my youth.&quot; She commented: &quot;I was always interested in the social consciousness of certain songs. My mother and grandfather were progressive thinkers, so I felt at home in the peace movement and the women&#x27;s movement, and that has influenced my music.&quot;

===Early career===

Louis Nigro&#x27;s work brought her into contact with record company executive Artie Mogull and his partner Paul Barry, who auditioned Laura in 1966 and became her first managers. However, Nigro later said he did &quot;not even once&quot; mention Laura to any of his clients.&quot;

Mogull had negotiated a recording and management contract for her, and Nyro recorded her debut album, &quot;More Than a New Discovery&quot;, for the Verve Folkways label (later re-named Verve Forecast). Other songs from the album later became hits for The 5th Dimension, Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears, and Barbra Streisand.

On July 13, 1966, Nyro recorded &quot;Stoney End&quot; and &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; as well as an early version of &quot;Time and Love&quot;, as part of &quot;More Than A New Discovery&quot; at Bell Sounds Studios, 237 West 54th Street, Manhattan. About a month later, she sold &quot;And When I Die&quot; to Peter, Paul, and Mary for $5,000. On September 17, 1966, Nyro and Verve Folkways released &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot;/&quot;Stoney End&quot; as a single. &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; became a minor hit, especially on the west coast. She completed &quot;More Than A New Discovery&quot; in New York on November 29, 1966; and, starting on January 16, 1967, made her first extended professional appearance at age 19, performing nightly for about a month at the &quot;hungry i&quot; coffeehouse in San Francisco. In February 1967, Verve Folkways released &quot;More Than A New Discovery&quot;. On March 4, 1967, Nyro appeared on &quot;Clay Cole&#x27;s Diskoteck&quot;, Episode 7.23, along with Dion and the Belmonts and others, but the recording of the episode is lost. On March 21, 1967, she appeared on &quot;Where the Action Is&quot; (episode 3.140) with videos of &quot;Wedding Bell Blues&quot; (partially extant), &quot;Blowin&#x27; Away&quot; (lost) and &quot;Goodbye Joe&quot; (lost).

On June 17, 1967, Nyro appeared at the Monterey Pop Festival. Although some accounts described her performance as a fiasco that culminated in her being booed off the stage, recordings later made publicly available contradict this version of events. &quot;Newsweek&quot; reporter Michael Lydon reviewed her performance very negatively, writing that &quot;the evening hit bottom&quot; during Nyro&#x27;s &quot;melodramatic&quot; set.

Soon afterwards, David Geffen approached Mogull about taking over as Nyro&#x27;s agent. Nyro successfully sued to void her management and recording contracts on the grounds that she had entered into them while still a minor. Geffen became her manager, and the two established a publishing company, Tuna Fish Music, under which the proceeds from her future compositions would be divided equally between them. Geffen also arranged Nyro&#x27;s new recording contract with Clive Davis at Columbia Records, and purchased the publishing rights to her early compositions. In his memoir &quot;Clive: Inside the Record Business&quot;, Davis recalled Nyro&#x27;s audition for him: She had invited him to her New York apartment, turned off every light except that of a television set next to her piano, and played him the material that would become &quot;Eli and the Thirteenth Confession&quot;. Around this time, she considered becoming lead singer for Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears after the departure of founder Al Kooper, but was dissuaded by Geffen. Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears went on to have a hit with a cover of Nyro&#x27;s &quot;And When I Die&quot;.

The new contract allowed Nyro more artistic freedom and control. In 1968, Columbia released &quot;Eli and the Thirteenth Confession&quot;, her second album, which received high critical praise for the depth and sophistication of its performance and arrangements, which merged pop structure with inspired imagery, rich vocals, and avant-garde jazz; it is widely considered one of her best works. It was followed in 1969 by &quot;New York Tendaberry&quot;, another highly acclaimed work that cemented Nyro&#x27;s artistic credibility. &quot;Time and Love&quot; and &quot;Save the Country&quot; emerged as two of her most well-regarded and popular songs in the hands of other artists. During the weekend after Thanksgiving in November 1969, she gave two concerts at Carnegie Hall. Her own recordings sold mostly to a faithful cadre of followers. This prompted Clive Davis, in his memoir, to note that her recordings, as solid as they were, came to resemble demonstrations for other performers.

In 1969, Verve reissued Nyro&#x27;s debut album as &quot;The First Songs&quot;. The same year Geffen and Nyro sold Tuna Fish Music to CBS for $4.5 million. Under the terms of his partnership with Nyro, Geffen received half of the proceeds of the sale, making them both millionaires.

Nyro&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Christmas and the Beads of Sweat&quot;, was released at the end of 1970. It contained &quot;Upstairs By a Chinese Lamp&quot; and &quot;When I Was a Freeport and You Were the Main Drag&quot; and featured Duane Allman and other Muscle Shoals musicians. The following year&#x27;s &quot;Gonna Take a Miracle&quot; was a collection of Nyro&#x27;s favorite &quot;teenage heartbeat songs&quot;, recorded with vocal group Labelle (Patti LaBelle, Nona Hendryx, and Sarah Dash) and the production team of Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. With the exception of her attribution of &quot;Désiree&quot; (originally &quot;Deserie&quot; by the Charts), it was Nyro&#x27;s sole album of wholly non-original material, featuring such songs as &quot;Jimmy Mack&quot;, &quot;Nowhere to Run&quot; and &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot;.

During 1971, David Geffen worked to establish his own recording label, Asylum Records, in part because of the trouble he had trying to secure a recording contract for another of his clients, Jackson Browne (with whom Nyro was in a relationship at the time). Geffen invited Nyro to join the new label and announced that she would be Asylum&#x27;s first singer; however, shortly before the signing was due to take place, Geffen learned that Nyro had re-signed with Columbia instead, without telling him. When interviewed about the matter for a 2012 PBS documentary on his life, Geffen, who&#x27;d considered Nyro his best friend, described her rejection as the biggest betrayal of his life up to that point, and said he &quot;cried for days&quot; afterwards.

By the end of 1971, Nyro was married to carpenter David Bianchini. She was reportedly uncomfortable with attempts to market her as a celebrity and she announced her retirement from the music business at the age of 24. In 1973, her Verve debut album was reissued as &quot;The First Songs&quot; by Columbia Records.

===Later career===
By 1976, her marriage had ended, and she released an album of new material, &quot;Smile&quot;. She then embarked on a four-month tour with a full band, which resulted in the 1977 live album &quot;Season of Lights&quot;.

After the 1978 album &quot;Nested&quot;, recorded when she was pregnant with her only child, she again took a break from recording, this time until 1984&#x27;s &quot;Mother&#x27;s Spiritual&quot;. She began touring with a band in 1988, her first concert appearances in 10 years. The tour was dedicated to the animal rights movement. The shows led to her 1989 release, &quot;&quot;, which included six new compositions.

Her final album of predominantly original material, &quot;Walk the Dog and Light the Light&quot; (1993), her last album for Columbia, was co-produced by Gary Katz, best known for his work with Steely Dan. The release sparked reappraisal of her place in popular music, and new commercial offers began appearing. She turned down lucrative film-composing offers, although she contributed a rare protest song to the Academy Award-winning documentary &quot;Broken Rainbow&quot;, about the unjust relocation of the Navajo people.

Nyro performed increasingly in the 1980s and 1990s with female musicians, including her friend Nydia &quot;Liberty&quot; Mata, a drummer, and several others from the lesbian-feminist women&#x27;s music subculture, such as members of the band Isis. She appeared at such venues as the 1989 Michigan Womyn&#x27;s Music Festival and the 1989 Newport Folk Festival, of which a CD containing portions of her performance was released. On July 4, 1991, she opened for Bob Dylan at the Tanglewood Music Center in Lenox, Massachusetts. Among her last performances were at Union Chapel, Islington, London, England in November 1994; The New York Bottom Line Christmas Eve Show in 1994; and at McCabe&#x27;s in Los Angeles February 11 and 12, 1995. 
&quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; pursued Nyro for TV appearances, but she turned them down, citing her discomfort with appearing on television. (She made only a handful of early TV appearances, and one fleeting moment on VH-1 performing the title song from &quot;Broken Rainbow&quot; on Earth Day in 1990.) According to producer Gary Katz, she also turned down an invitation to be the musical guest on the 1993 season opener of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. She never released an official video, although there was talk of filming some of &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; appearances in the 1990s.

==Personal life==
Nyro was bisexual, though this fact was known only to her closest friends. She had a perhaps yearlong relationship with Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears bassist Jim Fielder starting in 1968, and with Crosby, Stills and Nash drummer Dallas Taylor for about six months after that. She also had a brief relationship with singer/songwriter Jackson Browne in late 1970 to early 1971. (Browne was Nyro&#x27;s opening act at the time.)

Nyro married Vietnam War veteran David Bianchini in October 1971 after a whirlwind romance and spent the next three years living with him in a small town in Massachusetts. The marriage ended after three years, during which time she had grown accustomed to rural life, as opposed to the life in the city, where she had recorded her first five records.

After Nyro split from Bianchini in 1975, she suffered the trauma of the death of her mother Gilda to ovarian cancer at the age of 49. She consoled herself largely by recording a new album, enlisting Charlie Calello, with whom she had collaborated on &quot;Eli and the Thirteenth Confession&quot;.

In 1978, a short-lived relationship with Harindra Singh produced a son, Gil Bianchini (also known as musician Gil-T), whom she gave the surname of her ex-husband.

In the early 1980s, Nyro began living with painter Maria Desiderio (1954–1999), a relationship that lasted 17 years, the rest of Nyro&#x27;s life.

Nyro was a feminist and openly discussed it on a number of occasions, once saying, &quot;I may bring a certain feminist perspective to my songwriting, because that&#x27;s how I see life.&quot;

By the late 1980s, Nyro had become an animal rights activist and vegetarian, and began to offer literature on the subject at her concerts.

==Death==
In late 1996, Nyro, like her mother, was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. After the diagnosis, Columbia Records, with Nyro&#x27;s involvement, prepared a two-CD retrospective of material from her years at the label. She lived to see the release of &quot;Stoned Soul Picnic: The Best of Laura Nyro&quot; in 1997.

She died of ovarian cancer in Danbury, Connecticut, on April 8, 1997, at 49, the same age at which her mother died. Her ashes were scattered beneath a maple tree on the grounds of her house in Danbury.

==Legacy==

===Posthumous releases===
Nyro&#x27;s posthumous releases include &quot;Angel In The Dark&quot; (2001), which includes her final studio recordings made in 1994 and 1995, and &quot;The Loom&#x27;s Desire&quot; (2002), a set of live recordings with solo piano and harmony singers from &quot;The Bottom Line&quot; Christmas shows of 1993 and 1994.

===Influence===

Nyro&#x27;s influence on popular musicians has also been acknowledged by such artists as Joni Mitchell, Carole King, Tori Amos, Patti Smith, Kate Bush, Suzanne Vega, Diamanda Galas, Bette Midler, Rickie Lee Jones, Elton John, Jackson Browne, Alice Cooper, Elvis Costello, Cyndi Lauper, Todd Rundgren, Steely Dan, Sarah Cracknell, Melissa Manchester, Lisa Germano, and Rosanne Cash.

Todd Rundgren stated that once he heard her, he &quot;stopped writing songs like the Who and started writing songs like Laura.&quot;

Cyndi Lauper said that her rendition of the song &quot;Walk On By&quot;, on her Grammy Award-nominated 2003 cover album &quot;At Last&quot;, was inspired by Nyro.

Elton John and Elvis Costello discussed Nyro&#x27;s influence on both of them during the premiere episode of Costello&#x27;s interview show . When asked by the host if he could name three great performers/songwriters who have largely been ignored, John cited Nyro as one of his choices. He also addressed Nyro&#x27;s influence on his 1970 song &quot;Burn Down the Mission&quot;, from &quot;Tumbleweed Connection&quot;, in particular. &quot;I idolized her,&quot; he concluded. &quot;The soul, the passion, just the out and out audacity of the way her rhythmic and melody changes came was like nothing I&#x27;ve heard before.&quot;

Bruce Arnold, leader of the pioneering soft rock group Orpheus, was a fan of Nyro&#x27;s music. They both worked with legendary studio drummer Bernard Purdie. While recording with Purdie, Arnold mentioned his love of Nyro&#x27;s music, and the drummer responded with a story about Nyro: At Nyro&#x27;s home one night in the late 1970s, Purdie mentioned that he was the uncredited drummer for Orpheus. Nyro got excited and brought him into a room where she kept her record collection. She pulled out well-worn copies of every Orpheus LP, as well as copies sealed for posterity.

Diane Paulus and Bruce Buschel co-created &quot;Eli&#x27;s Comin&quot;&#x27;, a musical revue of the songs of Nyro, which, among others, starred Anika Noni Rose.

Louis Greenstein and Kate Ferber wrote &quot;One Child Born: The Music of Laura Nyro&quot;, a one-woman show featuring Ferber and directed by Adrienne Campbell-Holt. &quot;One Child Born&quot; was developed at CAP21 in New York City and has sold out Joe&#x27;s Pub and the Laurie Beechman Theatre in New York, World Cafe Live in Philadelphia, and other venues.

The Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the National Ballet of Canada have also included her music in their performances; notably, &quot;Been On A Train&quot; from &quot;Christmas and the Beads of Sweat&quot;, in which a woman describes watching her lover die from a drug overdose, comprises the second movement of Ailey&#x27;s 1971 solo for Judith Jamison, &quot;Cry&quot;. Alvin Ailey choreographed &quot;Quintet&quot; in 1968 with 5 female members of his troupe dancing to several of Laura&#x27;s songs from the first two albums.

On October 2, 2007, three-time Tony nominee Judy Kuhn released her new album &quot;Serious Playground: The Songs of Laura Nyro&quot;. The album, which debuted as a concert to a sold-out house at Lincoln Center&#x27;s American Songbook Series in January 2007, includes several of Nyro&#x27;s biggest hits (&quot;Stoned Soul Picnic&quot;, &quot;Stoney End&quot;) as well as some of her lesser known gems.

In 1992, English shoegaze/Britpop band Lush released a song about Laura Nyro (&quot;Laura&quot;) on their first full-length album &quot;Spooky&quot;. Several of the band&#x27;s songs (specifically those written by Emma Anderson) have echoed Nyro&#x27;s music in their titles – &quot;When I Die&quot;, &quot;Single Girl&quot;. More recently, in 2012, Anderson has referred to Laura Nyro as &quot;wondrous&quot; on her Twitter account.

On her 2006 album &quot;Build a Bridge,&quot; the operatic/Broadway soprano Audra McDonald included covers of Nyro&#x27;s songs &quot;To a Child&quot; and &quot;Tom Cat Goodbye&quot;.

The musical theater composer Stephen Schwartz credits Nyro as a major influence on his work.

Alice Cooper has mentioned on his syndicated radio show that Laura Nyro is one of his favorite songwriters.

Jenny Lewis of Rilo Kiley, when promoting her 2006 solo album &quot;Rabbit Fur Coat&quot; repeatedly cited Nyro&#x27;s 1971 album &quot;Gonna Take a Miracle&quot; as a big influence on her music. Lewis performed the first track on that album &quot;I Met Him on a Sunday&quot; on the Rabbit Fur Coat tour.

In the 2004 drama film &quot;A Home at the End of the World&quot; can be heard Nyro&#x27;s recordings of &quot;Désiree&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Take a Miracle&quot;, both songs from the album &quot;Gonna Take a Miracle&quot;.

Paul Shaffer, bandleader for the CBS Orchestra and sidekick on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, stated that his desert island album would be &quot;Eli and the Thirteenth Confession&quot;.

Paul Stanley of Kiss has mentioned on several occasions that he is a big admirer of Nyro&#x27;s music.

Exene Cervenka of the punk rock band X listed Nyro as one of her favorite songwriters.

===Biographies, analyses and tributes===

On October 27, 1997, a large-scale tribute concert was produced by women at the Beacon Theatre in New York. Performers included Rickie Lee Jones, Sandra Bernhard, Toshi Reagon, and Phoebe Snow.
&quot;And a World To Carry On&quot;, an original tribute show celebrating the music and life of Laura Nyro, written by Barry Silber and Carole Coppinger, was first performed in 2008 (2nd performance late August 2015) at Carrollwood Players Theatre in Tampa, Fla.

&quot;To Carry On&quot;, an original tribute show celebrating the music and life of Laura Nyro, starring Mimi Cohen, is in its second return engagement as of January 19, 2011, at Cherry Lane Theatre in Manhattan.

A biography of Nyro, &quot;Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro&quot;, written by Michele Kort, was published in 2002 by Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin&#x27;s Press. &quot;On Track: Laura Nyro&quot;, a detailed song-by-song survey by Philip Ward, was published by Sonicbond in 2022.

An analysis of Nyro&#x27;s music by music theorist Ari Shagal was written at the University of Chicago in 2003, linking Nyro&#x27;s work to the Great American Songbook by demonstrating the similarities between her chordal language and those of Harold Arlen, Harry Warren, and George Shearing.

Nyro&#x27;s life and music were celebrated in a 2005 BBC Radio 2 documentary, &quot;Shooting Star – Laura Nyro Remembered&quot;, which was narrated by her friend Bette Midler and included contributions from her one-time manager David Geffen, co-producers Arif Mardin and Gary Katz, and performers Suzanne Vega and Janis Ian. It was rebroadcast on April 4, 2006.

Janis Ian, who attended the High School of Music and Art in New York at the same time as Nyro, discussed her friendship with Nyro during the late 1960s in her autobiography, &quot;Society&#x27;s Child&quot;. Ian described her as looking like a &quot;Morticia Addams&quot; caricature with her long, dark hair, and called her a &quot;brilliant songwriter&quot; but &quot;oddly inarticulate&quot; in terms of musical terminology. Ian was a fan of Nyro&#x27;s work with producer Charlie Calello and chose him as the producer of her 1969 album &quot;Who Really Cares&quot; on the basis of his work with Nyro.

Comedian, writer, and singer Sandra Bernhard has spoken extensively of Laura Nyro as an ongoing inspiration. She dedicated a song, &quot;The Woman I Could&#x27;ve Been&quot; on &quot;Excuses for Bad Behavior (Part One)&quot;, to her. She also sang Nyro&#x27;s &quot;I Never Meant to Hurt You&quot; in her film &quot;Without You I&#x27;m Nothing&quot;.

Rickie Lee Jones&#x27;s album &quot;Pirates&quot; and songs such as &quot;We Belong Together&quot; and &quot;Living It Up&quot; are reminiscent of early Laura Nyro songs, and Jones acknowledged Nyro&#x27;s influence. In her memoir, &quot;Last Chance Texaco&quot;, Jones describes discovering Nyro&#x27;s music in the summer of 1970, saying &quot;Somehow, the moment I fell in love with Laura I loved myself just a little more. I believe an invisible cord came out of me and attached itself to Laura Nyro that summer. Or vice versa.&quot;

Todd Rundgren has also acknowledged the strong influence of Nyro&#x27;s 1960s music on his own songwriting. While a member of the pop group Nazz, his great admiration for Nyro led him to arrange a meeting with her (which took place shortly after she had recorded the &quot;Eli and the Thirteenth Confession&quot; LP). Nyro invited Rundgren to become the musical director of her backing group, but his commitments to Nazz obliged him to decline. Rundgren&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;Runt&quot; (1970) includes the strongly Nyro-influenced &quot;Baby Let&#x27;s Swing&quot; which was written about her and mentions her by name. Rundgren and Nyro remained friends for much of her professional career and he subsequently assisted her with the recording of her album &quot;Mother&#x27;s Spiritual&quot;.

On April 14, 2012, Laura Nyro was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The induction speech was delivered by singer Bette Midler and the award was accepted by her son, Gil Bianchini. The song &quot;Stoney End&quot; was performed by singer Sara Bareilles at the induction ceremony.

A hybrid daylily named for Laura Nyro was introduced in 2000.

The Scottish band Cosmic Rough Riders released a tribute song, &quot;Laura Nyro,&quot; on their 2001 album &quot;Pure Escapism&quot;.

The song &quot;Mean Streets&quot; by the band Tennis is a tribute to Nyro.

Kanye West sampled Nyro on his widely acclaimed 2007 album &quot;Graduation&quot;.

On July 22, 2014, composer/arranger Billy Childs released &quot;Map to the Treasure: Reimagining Laura Nyro&quot;. The album features ten Laura Nyro songs performed by a long list of stars including Rickie Lee Jones, Shawn Colvin, Alison Krauss, Dianne Reeves, and Wayne Shorter. The album was nominated for three Grammys, with the &quot;New York Tendaberry&quot; track featuring Renee Fleming and Yo-Yo Ma winning for Best Arrangement, Instrumental and Vocals.

In 2015, the Christine Spero Group released &quot;Spero Plays Nyro&quot;, the Music of Laura Nyro along with a highly acclaimed live tour. The album features eleven of Nyro&#x27;s songs and an original song, &quot;Laura and John&quot; by Christine Spero, a tribute to Laura Nyro and John Coltrane, whom Nyro admired.

A documentary on Nyro was announced in 2022, which will be associate produced by her son Gil and partly based on the Michele Kort biography.

<doc id="344025" wikidata="Q1479785" url="?curid=344025" title="Hyperreality">
<text>Hyperreality is a concept in post-structuralism that refers to the process of the evolution of notions of reality, leading to a cultural state of confusion between signs and symbols invented to stand in for reality, and direct perceptions of consensus reality. Hyperreality is seen as a condition in which, because of the compression of perceptions of reality in culture and media, what is generally regarded as real and what is understood as fiction are seamlessly blended together in experiences so that there is no longer any clear distinction between where one ends and the other begins.

The term was proposed by French philosopher Jean Baudrillard, whose postmodern work contributed to a scholarly tradition in the field of communication studies that speaks directly to larger social concerns. Postmodernism was established through the social turmoil of the 1960s, spurred by social movements that questioned preexisting conventions and social institutions. Through the postmodern lens, reality is viewed as a fragmented, complimentary and polysemic system with components that are produced by social and cultural activity. Social realities that constitute consensus reality are constantly produced and reproduced, changing through the extended use of signs and symbols which hence contribute to the creation of a greater hyperreality.

== Origins and usage ==
The postmodern semiotic concept of hyperreality was contentiously coined by Baudrillard in &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot; (1981). Baudrillard defined &quot;hyperreality&quot; as &quot;the generation by models of a real without origin or reality&quot;; and his earlier book &quot;Symbolic Exchange and Death&quot;. Hyperreality is a representation, a sign, without an original referent. According to Baudrillard, the commodities in this theoretical state do not have use-value as defined by Karl Marx but can be understood as signs as defined by Ferdinand de Saussure. He believes hyperreality goes further than confusing or blending the &#x27;real&#x27; with the symbol which represents it; it involves creating a symbol or set of signifiers which represent something that does not actually exist, like Santa Claus. Baudrillard borrows, from Jorge Luis Borges&#x27; &quot;On Exactitude in Science&quot; (already borrowed from Lewis Carroll), the example of a society whose cartographers create a map so detailed that it covers the very things it was designed to represent. When the empire declines, the map fades into the landscape. He says that, in such a case, neither the representation nor the real remains, just the hyperreal.

Baudrillard&#x27;s idea of hyperreality was heavily influenced by phenomenology, semiotics, and the philosophy of Marshall McLuhan. Baudrillard, however, challenges McLuhan&#x27;s famous statement that &quot;the medium is the message,&quot; by suggesting that information devours its own content. He also suggested that there is a difference between the media and reality and what they represent. Hyperreality is the inability of consciousness to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, especially in technologically advanced societies. However, Baudrillard&#x27;s hyperreality theory goes a step further than McLuhan&#x27;s medium theory: &quot;There is not only an implosion of the message in the medium, there is, in the same movement, the implosion of the medium itself in the real, the implosion of the medium and of the real in a sort of hyperreal nebula, in which even the definition and distinct action of the medium can no longer be determined&quot;.

Italian author Umberto Eco explores the notion of hyperreality further by suggesting that the action of hyperreality is to desire reality and in the attempt to achieve that desire, to fabricate a false reality that is to be consumed as real. Linked to contemporary western culture, Umberto Eco and post-structuralists would argue that in current cultures, fundamental ideals are built on desire and particular sign-systems. Temenuga Trifonova from University of California, San Diego notes,
== Significance ==
Hyperreality is significant as a paradigm to explain current cultural conditions. Consumerism, because of its reliance on sign exchange value (e.g. brand X shows that one is fashionable, car Y indicates one&#x27;s wealth), could be seen as a contributing factor in the creation of hyperreality or the hyperreal condition. Hyperreality tricks consciousness into detaching from any real emotional engagement, instead opting for artificial simulation, and endless reproductions of fundamentally empty appearance. Essentially (although Baudrillard himself may balk at the use of this word), fulfillment or happiness is found through simulation and imitation of a transient simulacrum of reality, rather than any interaction with any &quot;real&quot; reality.

While hyperreality is not a new concept, its effects are more relevant in modern society, incorporating technological advancements like artificial intelligence, virtual reality and neurotechnology (simulated reality). This is attributed to the way it effectively captured the postmodern condition, particularly how people in the postmodern world seek stimulation by creating unreal worlds of spectacle and seduction and nothing more. There are dangers to the use of hyperreality within our culture; individuals may observe and accept hyperreal images as role models when the images don&#x27;t necessarily represent real physical people. This can result in a desire to strive for an unobtainable ideal, or it may lead to a lack of unimpaired role models. Daniel J. Boorstin cautions against confusing celebrity worship with hero worship, &quot;we come dangerously close to depriving ourselves of all real models. We lose sight of the men and women who do not simply seem great because they are famous but who are famous because they are great&quot;. He bemoans the loss of old heroes like Moses, Odysseus, Aeneas, Jesus, Julius Caesar, Muhammed, Joan of Arc, William Shakespeare, George Washington, Napoleon, and Abraham Lincoln, who did not have public relations (PR) agencies to construct hyperreal images of themselves. The dangers of hyperreality are also facilitated by information technologies, which provide tools to dominant powers that seek to encourage it to drive consumption and materialism. The danger in the pursuit of stimulation and seduction emerge not in the lack of meaning but, as Baudrillard maintained, &quot;we are gorged with meaning and it is killing us.&quot;

Hyperreality, some sources point out, may provide insights into the postmodern movement by analyzing how simulations disrupt the binary opposition between reality and illusion but it does not address or resolve the contradictions inherent in this tension.

== Key relational themes ==
The concepts most fundamental to hyperreality are those of simulation and the simulacrum, first conceptualized by Jean Baudrillard in his book &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;. The two terms are separate entities with relational origin connections to Baudrillard&#x27;s theory of hyperreality.

===Simulation===
Simulation is characterized by a blending of &#x27;reality&#x27; and representation, where there is no clear indication of where the former stops and the latter begins. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being, or a substance; &quot;It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: a hyperreal.&quot; Baudrillard suggests that simulation no longer takes place in a physical realm; it takes place within a space not categorized by physical limits i.e., within ourselves, technological simulations, etc.

===Simulacrum===
The simulacrum is &quot;an image without resemblance&quot;; as Gilles Deleuze summarized, it is the forsaking of &quot;moral existence in order to enter into aesthetic existence&quot;. However, Baudrillard argues that a simulacrum is not a copy of the real, but becomes—through sociocultural compression—truth in its own right. 

There are four steps of hyperreal reproduction:
# Basic reflection of reality, i.e. in immediate perception
# Perversion of reality, i.e. in representation
# Pretense of reality, where there is no model
# Simulacrum, which &quot;bears no relation to any reality whatsoever&quot;

===Hyperstition===
The concept of &quot;hyperstition&quot; as expounded upon by the English collective Cybernetic Culture Research Unit generalizes the notion of hyperreality to encompass the concept of &quot;fictional entities that make themselves real.&quot; In Nick Land&#x27;s own words:
The concept of hyperstition is also related to the concept of &quot;theory-fiction&quot;, in which philosophy, critical theory and postmodern literature speculate on actual reality and engage with concepts for potentialities and virtualities. An oft-cited example of such a concept is &quot;cyberspace&quot;—originating in William Gibson&#x27;s 1984 novel &quot;Neuromancer&quot;—which is a concept for the convergence between virtualities and actualities. By the mid-1990s, the realization of this concept had begun to emerge on a mass scale in the form of the internet.

=== Consequence ===
The truth was already being called into question with the rise of media and technology, but with the presence of hyperreality being used most and embraced as a new technology, there are a couple of issues or consequences of hyperreality. It&#x27;s difficult enough to hear something on the news and choose not to believe it, but it&#x27;s quite another to see an image of an event or anything and use your empirical sense to determine whether the news is true or false, which is one of the consequences of hyperrealism. The first is the possibility of various simulations being used to influence the audience, resulting in an inability to differentiate fiction from reality, which affects the overall truth value of a subject at hand. Another implication or disadvantage is the possibility of being manipulated by what we see.

The audience can interpret different messages depending on the ideology of the entity behind an image. As a result, power equates to control over the media and the people. Celebrities, for example, have their photographs taken and altered so that the public can see the final result. The public then perceives celebrities based on what they have seen rather than how they truly are. It can progress to the point where celebrities appear completely different. As a result of celebrities&#x27; body modifications and editing, there has been an increase in surgeries and a decrease in self-esteem during adolescence. Because the truth is threatened, a similar outcome for hyperreality is possible.

== In culture ==

As society has transitioned toward a consumer culture, the combination of the free market economy and the advancements found within media and communication technologies have influenced this development towards a hyperreality. Through the emergence of new media technologies and the ever-growing role of media found within the modern day, a growing link is displayed between the incorporation and effects of hyperreality. The transition from Web 1.0 to Web 2.0 to Web3 has been studied as a process of transitioning towards hyperreality. On the basic level of hyperreality, Web 1.0 was designed for freely downloading and reading information, with readers being able to search for topics; Yahoo, Google, and MSN are examples of Web 1.0. Instagram, TikTok, and Messenger are examples of Web 2.0 platforms that transformed what was once a reading platform into an interaction platform. Web3 is a newer platform that allows users to fully integrate the virtual world into decentralized and autonomously controlled environments, such as Filecoin and the metaverse.

There is a strong link between media and the impact that the presence of hyperreality has on its viewers. This has shown to blur the lines between artificial realities and reality, influencing the day to day experiences of those exposed to it. As hyperreality captures the inability to distinguish reality from a simulation of reality, common media outlets such as news, social media platforms, radio and television contribute to this misconception of true reality. Descriptions of the impact of hyperreality can be found in popular media. They present themselves as becoming blended with reality, which influences the experience of life and truth for its viewers.

Baudrillard, like Roland Barthes before him, explained that these impacts have a direct effect on younger generations who idolize the heroes, characters or influencers found on these platforms. As media is a social institution that shapes and develops its members within society, the exposure to hyperreality found within these platforms presents an everlasting effect. Baudrillard concludes that exposure to hyperreality over time will lead, from the conservative perspective of the institutions themselves, to confusion and chaos, in turn leading to the destruction of identity, originality and character while ironically still being the mainstay of the institutions.

=== Social media and public image ===
With the introduction of the smartphone in the early 2000s, online presence and presence in the real world have become synonymous. An individual&#x27;s digital footprint can often tell us more about an individual than their real lives. This is because people&#x27;s behaviors can change dramatically on the internet with virtually no repercussions or laws telling them to do so; the internet has become the anarchist&#x27;s safe haven. The role of social media in society has dramatically increased in recent decades and creating a public image or online presence has become an online standard. Twitter has become a main source for public figures to express themselves and for corporations to inform the public. The hyperreality environment on the internet has shifted dramatically over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, so much so that it has an influence on the Italian Stock Exchange in 2021. The hyperreality created on social media platforms has been regarded as strong and influential enough for its quality and emotion to be translated into social reality, where value is lost and careers are damaged. Emotions expressed on social media are directly having real-life effects on numerous sectors despite having any factual basis or tangible information. As social media becomes more ingrained into the daily lives of countless individuals, the distinction between stories on the internet and truth in real life are becoming more blurred as it descends into the core of hyperreality.

&quot;Squid Game&quot; created hyperreal conditions on the internet where millions were sharing their own feelings and opinions about the show, even going as far as to play the games and practice the activities portrayed in the show. The hyperreal conditions were created so effectively that individuals were picking up unique Korean cultural aspects but only giving credit to the show and not the country; individuals believed the show created these games. This is hugely significant because it illustrates Baudrillard&#x27;s notion of models of reality without reality; a fictional TV show produced real events and practices and completely removed the real cultural significance. The Hollywood sign in Los Angeles, California, itself produces similar notions, but is more a &quot;symbol&quot; of a facet of hyperreality—the creation of a city with its main target being media production.

The increase in social media influencers has given rise to a popular &quot;storytelling&quot; trend, where creators recount past experiences, often exaggerating and dramatizing the experience for perceived importance and relevance. The trend mixes reality with the virtual world as viewers often feel part of the creators&#x27; life and identify with this given image the creator produces for their audience. Social media currently offers what news and other sources of media could not forty years ago: the chance to not only share news but to also create news. To exaggerate this even further, TikTok has seen the nuance of AI accounts that present themselves as human-like animated beings with unique personalities, artificial social circles and personal likes and interests. Once designed by humans, now completely independent of any influence, these AI creations have mass followings that present conditions of perfect four-dimensional simulation as described by Baudrillard. With the incentive for viewership and notoriety, social media influencers/creators have little incentive to produce meaningful and actual news and instead lean toward these storytelling methods that produce large reactions that blur the lines of reality and false online narratives.

=== Disneyland ===
Both Umberto Eco and Jean Baudrillard refer to Disneyland as an example of hyperreality. Eco believes that Disneyland with its settings such as Main Street and full sized houses has been created to look &quot;absolutely realistic&quot;, taking visitors&#x27; imagination to a &quot;fantastic past&quot;. This false reality creates an illusion and makes it more desirable for people to buy this reality. Disneyland works in a system that enables visitors to feel that technology and the created atmosphere &quot;can give us more reality than nature can&quot;. The &quot;fake nature&quot; of Disneyland satisfies our imagination and daydream fantasies in real life. The idea is that nothing in this world is real. Nothing is original, but all are endless copies of reality. Since we do not imagine the reality of simulations, both imagined and real are equally hyperreal, for example, the numerous simulated rides, including the submarine ride and the Mississippi boat tour. When entering Disneyland, consumers form into lines to gain access to each attraction. Then they are ordered by people with special uniforms to follow the rules, such as where to stand or where to sit. If the consumers follow each rule correctly, they can enjoy &quot;the real thing&quot; and see things that are not available to them outside of Disneyland&#x27;s doors.

In his work &quot;Simulacra and Simulation&quot;, Baudrillard argues the &quot;imaginary world&quot; of Disneyland magnetizes people inside and has been presented as &quot;imaginary&quot; to make people believe that all its surroundings are &quot;real&quot;. But he believes that the Los Angeles area is not real; thus it is hyperreal. Disneyland is a set of apparatuses which tries to bring imagination and fiction to what is called &quot;real&quot;. This concerns the American values and way of life in a sense and &quot;concealing the fact that the real is no longer real, and thus of saving the reality principle.&quot;

&quot;The Disneyland imaginary is neither true or false: it is a deterrence machine set up in order to rejuvenate in reverse the fiction of the real. Whence the debility, the infantile degeneration of this imaginary. It&#x27;s meant to be an infantile world, in order to make us believe that the adults are elsewhere, in the &quot;real&quot; world, and to conceal the fact that real childishness is everywhere, particularly among those adults who go there to act the child in order to foster illusions of their real childishness.&quot;
=== Examples ===
*The hyperrealist painter Denis Peterson intentionally emphasized familiar signs and images which did not in fact faithfully reveal true reality. Instead, he coalesced these alternate perceptions of realities into subliminal depictions of contemporary cultures and boldly launched them into his body of work as hyperreality. No longer satisfied with an art-for-art&#x27;s sake approach to realist cityscapes and the like, Peterson saw hyperreality as a vehicle for social change, oftentimes conjuring themes of corruption, decadence, and genocide in his subject matter.
*The 1999 film &quot;Existenz&quot; follows Allegra Geller, a game designer who finds herself targeted by assassins while playing a virtual reality game of her own creation.
* The 1999 film &quot;The Thirteenth Floor&quot;: a murder mystery set within a cutting edge computer simulator, exploring ownership and abuse within the Utopian ideals of AI.
* The 2008 film &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; in which the life of the main character Caden Cotard is lived in the confines of a warehouse made to be the set of a play which is about his life, blurring all distinction between what is real and the simulation.
* The 2014 film &quot;Birdman&quot; portrays a theater director haunted by making his show as authentic as possible, leading to people getting hurt.
* Films in which characters and settings are either digitally enhanced or created entirely from CGI (e.g., &quot;300&quot;, where the entire film was shot in front of a blue/green screen, with all settings super-imposed).
* In &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;, when Alex says, &quot;It&#x27;s funny how the colors of the real world only seem really real when you viddy them on the screen&quot; (sic.) when he undergoes Ludovico&#x27;s Technique.
* A well-manicured garden (nature as hyperreal).
* Any massively promoted versions of historical or present &quot;facts&quot; (e.g., &quot;General Ignorance&quot; from &quot;QI&quot;, where the questions have seemingly obvious answers, which are actually wrong).
* Professional sports athletes as super, invincible versions of human beings.
* Many world cities and places which did not evolve as functional places with some basis in reality, as if they were &quot;creatio ex nihilo&quot; (literally &#x27;creation out of nothing&#x27;): Black Rock City; Disney World; Dubai; Celebration, Florida; Cancun and Las Vegas.
* TV and film in general (especially &quot;reality&quot; TV), due to its creation of a world of fantasy and its dependence that the viewer will engage with these fantasy worlds. The current trend is to glamorize the mundane using histrionics.
* A retail store that looks completely stocked and perfect due to facing, creating an illusion of more merchandise than there actually is.
* A high end sex doll used as a simulacrum of an unattainable partner.
* A newly made building or item designed to look old, or to recreate or reproduce an older artifact, by simulating the feel of age or aging. Such as Reborn Dolls. 
* Constructed languages (such as E-Prime) or &quot;reconstructed&quot; extinct dialects.
* &quot;Second Life&quot;, where the distinction becomes blurred when it becomes the platform for RL (real life) courses and conferences or leads to real world interactions behind the scenes.
* Weak virtual reality.
* The superfictional airline company Ingold Airlines.
* Works within the spectrum of the Vaporwave musical genre often encompass themes of hyperreality through parody of the information revolution.
* Plastic surgery, which can be described as the construction of faces that efface the distinction between &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;artificial&quot; in the syntax of beauty.
* Airbrushed images of men and women; for example, Dove&#x27;s Campaign for Real Beauty.
* Heidiland, is a region in eastern Switzerland named after the &quot;Heidi&quot; novels by Johanna Spyri, encompassing alpine landscapes, villages, and recreational areas inspired by the story&#x27;s setting. The labels throughout the village attraction treat Heidi as a historical figure with few hints of make-believe. 
* The restaurant Chain, which features nostalgic callbacks to real fast food chains (in particular Pizza Hut) though is a pastiche of fast food restaurants from a previous era. 
* The superfictional video game &quot;Petscop&quot;.
* ChatGPT is highly proficient at confidently generating answers which can be either right or wrong, even blending both truth and falsities. For example, it has argued with all seriousness that the word cat starts with the letter S, but can employ many different formats, from essays to casual conversations. See Hallucination (artificial intelligence).

<text>University College, popularly referred to as UC, is a constituent college of the University of Toronto, created in 1853 specifically as an institution of higher learning free of religious affiliation. It was the founding member of the university&#x27;s modern collegiate system, and its non-denominationalism contrasted with contemporary colleges at the time, such as Trinity College and St. Michael&#x27;s College, both of which later became part of the University of Toronto.

University College is one of two places in the University of Toronto that has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada, along with Annesley Hall of Victoria College. It is home to the oldest student government in Canada, the Literary and Athletic Society.

== History ==

Shortly after taking power in the first responsible government of the Province of Canada, Reformist politicians led by Robert Baldwin wrested control of King&#x27;s College from the Church of England in 1849 and renamed it the University of Toronto. Baldwin envisioned that denominational colleges would soon decide to affiliate themselves under the secular University of Toronto &quot;with some vague status, perhaps as divinity halls&quot;. His hopes were dashed when the Presbyterian Queen&#x27;s College in Kingston opted to stay independent. Baldwin resigned as premier in 1851, leaving his successor, Francis Hincks, to find another way to persuade the denominational colleges. Hincks decided that the university should adopt the collegiate university governance model, used for centuries at Oxbridge and more recently at the University of London.

On 22 April 1853, University College was created as the Provincial College, and it retains that designation in the current University of Toronto Act. It was the first constituent college of the University of Toronto, inheriting the teaching functions and resources of the former King&#x27;s College, while the university itself became an examination body. Frederick William Cumberland was appointed in 1856 as the university architect to design and oversee the construction of the college&#x27;s new building, completed in 1859. Until Wycliffe College joined the university in 1889, University College was the only member college within the University of Toronto, and therefore the principal of the college was also the &quot;de facto&quot; chief of the entire university. The following year, Knox College and Victoria College also joined the University of Toronto.
University College was severely damaged by a fire that gutted the entire eastern wing and the college library on 14 February 1890. The fire spread rapidly when servants accidentally dropped two kerosene lamps on a wooden staircase at around 7 p.m. while preparing the illumination for an annual college exhibition. In Ottawa, Edward Blake, the university&#x27;s chancellor and a Member of Parliament, interrupted his speech to inform the House of Commons, &quot;The great institution, the crown and glory, I may be permitted to say, of the educational institutions in our country is at the moment in flames ... and is now, so far as its material fabric goes, a ruin tottering to the ground.&quot; Only about 100 books were rescued before the fire consumed more than 33,000 volumes at the college library. Despite the initial fears, University College recovered from the fire with remarkable ease and speed. Wycliffe College and Knox College both offered space for classes to accommodate displaced students. The board of trustees commissioned a swift restoration of the structure with insurance compensations and additional investments. Within two years, the library was replenished with donations from institutions throughout the British Empire.
On 15 February 1895, more than seven hundred University College students attended what was then described as the &quot;largest mass meeting in the history of the University&quot; to discuss the government&#x27;s dismissal of William Dale, the popular professor of Latin at the college. William Lyon Mackenzie King, a senior undergraduate who would later become Prime Minister of Canada, introduced a successful motion at the meeting to &quot;abstain from attendance at lectures at University College until a proper investigation be granted by the provincial government into the difficulties existing at the university.&quot; During the boycott of classes, professor of history George MacKinnon Wrong wrote to Chancellor Blake in England that only one student turned up at one of his lectures. The strike continued until 20 February, when students voted to return to classes after the government agreed to call a commission of inquiry.

In 1968, University College was designated a National Historic Site, in recognition of its historical role in creating the collegiate system at the University of Toronto, and as one of the earliest examples of the collegiate model at universities in the Commonwealth.

== Grounds and architecture ==

The main building of University College was built between 1856 and 1859, designed by architects Frederick William Cumberland and William George Storm. The selection of architectural styles was the result of &quot;a tangle of disagreements and concessions, political as well as artistic&quot;, including the college&#x27;s emphasis on freedom from denominational control. Cumberland met the requirements asked of him after taking part on a research and experience based trip to Europe in February 1856: &quot;This course of action was consistent with Victorian architectural practice when new public buildings were being planned, which was to carefully study applicable building forms and adapt them, to the requirements of the job at hand. The design committee led by Cumberland initially designed a Gothic structure, but Governor General Edmund Walker Head disliked the style and suggested Italian instead, later changing his preference to Byzantine.

The design committee would eventually include Norman, Romanesque Revival, and &quot;faint traces of Byzantium and the Italian palazzo&quot; styles in the design. In particular, the Byzantine, Norman and early English styles were deemed &quot;fitting for educational institutions&quot;. Cumberland chose Norman Romanesque as the main influence because he thought it was the most appreciate for the topography in Canada. To achieve a picturesque approach, Cumberland ignored the classical symmetry and deliberately gave an asymmetrical architectural expression. The building was an unconventional combination of varied parts incorporating British design for educational structures in England and Ireland.

Like most Romanesque buildings, University College has extremely thick masonry walls, built of many types of brick and stone layered upon each other. The main materials include wood, stone, brick, slate, iron, mortar, and tile. Only about one third of the exterior is stone, with the rest being a very pale yellow brick produced at a brickyard on Yonge Street. University College has the characteristic arched and rounded windows as well as huge, cavernous facades. A major feature of University College is arches laid out in series and sets. The arches are semicircular, and consist of small columns that provide the structural support to hold up vaults on the side of walkways. There is much ornamentation, especially in the form of stone carvings, liberally applied on the walls, arches, columns and façades of the building. Carved images include nature, animals, mysterious creatures as well as the college shield and motto. The building also features several stained glass windows, including the rose window by Robert McCausland.
Some of the basic original layout plans remain at University College today. The focal point of the structure is at the south façade, where the stone tower at the centre of the composition contains the main entrance of the college. The quadrangle and cloisters are enclosed within elaborately carved walls faced with stone, &quot;felicitously sited amid landscaped grounds&quot;. Until the Laidlaw Wing was completed in the 1960s, University College was a U-shaped structure that was open on the north end. Before the fire of 1890, the building was laid out such that the east wing provided access to the convocation hall, the museum and the library, and contained an entrance to the quadrangle. Residences and dining halls, classrooms, and public reading rooms were on the west range of the structure. The chemistry laboratory was relocated at the southwest range, in the present Croft Chapter House, because it was more logical than in the first study which was in the north. Today, the west wing is no longer used as living quarters, which are now provided by the college&#x27;s three dedicated residential halls, while the convocation functions have long since been moved to Convocation Hall.

=== Revitalization ===
The historic University College building underwent a major revitalization beginning in January 2018. The revitalization project included: improving the accessibility of the building, relocating the library to its original location in the East Hall, transforming the West Hall into a new event space called the Clark Reading Room, creating a conference centre in Croft Chapter House, and introducing a café called the Owlery located on the third floor outside of the Library.

== Academics ==

The University College Council is the college&#x27;s governing body, overseeing administrative, budgetary and academic matters. The principal, in addition to chairing the College Council, serves as the chief executive of the college. Student are represented on the College Council by the leaders of the Literary and Athletic Society and eight additional students.

University College houses several academic programs within the University of Toronto, further varied by major, minor and specialist concentrations, including Canadian studies, cognitive science, drama, health studies, and sexual diversity studies. The college houses a number of visiting fellows who take residence and office at the college.
University College hosts five sets of annual public lecture series. The Alexander Lectures, founded in 1928 and named for English professor W.J. Alexander, focuses on literature over four successive lectures. The Graham Lectures, established in 1930, explores scientific topics from astronomy to zoology in a non-technical manner. The F.E.L. Priestley Memorial Lectures in the History of Ideas are interdisciplinary, encompassing topics in social science and humanities such as literature, economics, history, geography, philosophy, theology, science, political science, as well as applied fields such as business, law, and medicine. The Stubbs Lecture, founded in 1988, focuses on Greek, Latin, or English literature. The Teetzel Lectures concentrates on art and architecture over three successive days.

The Laidlaw Library was the main library of University College from the 1960s until the College&#x27;s Revitalization project in 2018. The library has since moved back to its original location in the East Hall where the library was housed until the fire of 1890. The modern University College Library specialized in subjects related to the college&#x27;s in-house academic programs in the humanities and social sciences. It comprises a main collection of over 20,000 volumes, including the Avie Bennett Collection and the Al Purdy Collection.

==Student life and traditions==

===Legend of Diabolos and Reznikoff===
The famous ghost story of the University College, started from the carving &quot;Crocodiles and vermin&quot;. The sculptor was a Russian, named Ivan Reznikoff. It is said that he was buried in the northeast corner of the quadrangle. Since then, his ghost has been seen at regular intervals.
The newel in the east staircase is a wooden Griffin. The griffin is a magical creature that is a mix of a lion and an eagle. Some students believe that touching the Griffin will bring good luck, such as passing their exams with great marks.

Diabolos&#x27; is University College&#x27;s not-for-profit coffee bar that has been overseen by the Lit and student-run since 1966. It provides fair trade coffee, tea, vegan and vegetarian products to University College students. It is located in University College&#x27;s Junior Common Room and is open during the academic school year on Monday to Thursday 8:30am – 6pm and Friday 8:30am – 4pm.

===Literary and Athletic Society===

The University College Literary and Athletic Society, colloquially known as the &#x27;Lit&#x27;, is the oldest student government in Canada dating back to 1854. Established in 1854 as the &quot;Literary and Scientific Society&quot; and renamed &quot;The University College Literary and Athletic Society&quot; in 1921 it merged with the &quot;University College Women&#x27;s Undergraduate Association&quot; in 1958 to become representative of all students attending the college.

Every student of University College is a member of the society. The Lit&#x27;s mandate is to provide services, host events, facilitate student involvement, represent the student body, and foster a sense of community among students in the college. The Lit is also responsible for the student-run Diabolos&#x27; coffee bar, and the annual Fireball formal, commemorating the 1890 fire which destroyed the college. They also provide some support for Orientation Week, a week dedicated to help first-year students transition into university.

&quot;The Gargoyle&quot;, established in 1954, is the student newspaper of University College, named after the gargoyle statue in the college building. It is staffed by an editorial collective of undergraduate students, as well as a group of staff and regular contributors.

===Residential halls===

The college&#x27;s three residence buildings hold about 720 students, and are fully co-ed, although Whitney started out as the women&#x27;s residence and Sir Daniel Wilson&#x27;s as the men&#x27;s. The current Sir Daniel Wilson Hall was built in 1954, and the original Whitney Hall was built in 1931. A third residence, Morrison Hall, was added in 2005. Demand for places is high for a number of reasons: most rooms are singles, the community life is accepting and diverse and most main academic buildings are right across the street. Off-campus students can participate in the residence community life by becoming associate members of one of the houses.

There are a total of fifteen residential divisions, known as &quot;houses&quot;, in the residences. There are six houses within the Sir Daniel Wilson Residence: Jeanneret, Taylor, Wallace, Hutton, Loudon, and McCaul. In addition, there are four houses within the Whitney Residence: Cody, Mulock, Falconer, and Ferguson. Finally, there are five houses in Morrison Hall: Landsberg-Lewis, Perron, Wolfe, Bratty, and Langley. Hutton House is named after Maurice Hutton, a University College, University of Toronto classics professor. He also acted as Principal of University College, University of Toronto from 1901 to 1928. During 1906 and 1907 he was acting President of the university.

== Principals ==
In March 2019, Professor Markus Stock was appointed to be the 17th Principal of University College. His term will begin 1 January 2020 and will conclude on 30 June 2024. Stock replaces Donald Ainslie who has served as Principal since 2011.

<text>Thomas Clap or Thomas Clapp (June 26, 1703 – January 7, 1767) was an American academic and educator, a Congregational minister, and college administrator. He was both the fifth rector and the earliest official to be called &quot;president&quot; of Yale College (1740–1766). He is best known for his successful reform of Yale in the 1740s, partnering with the Rev. Dr. Samuel Johnson to restructure the forty-year-old institution along more modern lines. He convinced the Connecticut Assembly to exempt Yale from paying taxes. He opened a second college house and doubled the size of the college.

Yale graduated more students than Harvard beginning in 1756. He introduced Enlightenment math and science and Johnson&#x27;s moral philosophy into the curriculum, while retaining its Puritan theology. He also helped found the Linonian Society in 1753, a literary and debating society and one of Yale&#x27;s oldest secret societies. He personally built the first Orrery in America, a milestone of American science, and awarded his friend Benjamin Franklin an honorary degree.

His educational accomplishments were marred by many political, theological, and polity conflicts, with first the New Light faction in Connecticut, then the Anglicans, then the Old Light faction. He fought with the Connecticut Assembly, the Yale board, and finally, with his own tutors and students. He was forced to resign as president of Yale in 1766 and died soon after.

==Early life==
Clap was born in Scituate, Massachusetts, and studied with Rev. James McSparran, a missionary to Narragansett from the &quot;Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts&quot;, and with Rev. Nathiel Eells, of Scituate. He entered Harvard University (then known as Harvard College) at age 15, graduating in 1722. He preached at Windham, Connecticut, in 1725 and was ordained to succeed the Rev. Samuel Whiting as minister there in 1726, marrying Rev. Whiting&#x27;s daughter Mary in 1727, and remaining 14 years with a ministry marked by a rather severe orthodoxy (he once traveled to Springfield to oppose the ordination of a minister accused of Arminian tendencies).

==Early years of reform and religious conflict at Yale==
He was elected rector of Yale College following Elisha Williams&#x27;s resignation, largely because the trustees believed he would oppose Arminianism at Yale, and was inducted in 1740. His administration was to become known for its orthodoxy, pugnaciousness, authoritarianism, and embroilment in controversy. In 1743, his nephew Nathan Whiting, whom he and his wife Mary had raised after the death of his parents, graduated from Yale. He was learned both in theology and in science and constructed the first orrery in America. After the death of his first wife he married Mary Haynes on February 5, 1740 or 1741.

He was known as a &quot;rigid&quot;, &quot;dogmatic and obstinate&quot; leader who used &quot;autocratic methods&quot; to impose discipline at the college. His religious views and personality led to conflict within the school: he objected to the teachings of English minister George Whitefield, an itinerant minister of the Great Awakening, and other itinerant teachers such as Gilbert Tennent. Rev. Joseph Noyes, pastor in New Haven, invited James Davenport to his congregation to preach: Davenport used the opportunity to brand him an &quot;unconverted man&quot; and a &quot;hypocrite&quot;: the congregation was eventually physically split, resulting in the two Congregational Churches that still stand on the New Haven Green.

In 1741, two masters&#x27; candidates at Yale were denied their degrees for their &quot;disorderly and reckless endeavors to propagate&quot; the Great Awakening, and the college made it an offence for a student to imply that the rector, trustees, or tutors were &quot;carnal or unconverted men&quot; or &quot;hypocrites&quot;. It was not long before a student, David Brainerd, did so, saying that Tutor Whittelsey &quot;had no more grace than a chair&quot;, and was expelled. Jonathan Edwards, Rev. Aaron Burr (father of the vice-president), and Jonathan Dickinson unsuccessfully appealed for Brainerd&#x27;s reinstatement.

Clap campaigned for laws to inhibit itinerant preachers and lay exhorters and to stop the disintegration of churches by separation. Religious disputation continued to fragment to student body, who refused to submit to discipline, avoided religious instruction from the &quot;Old Lights&quot; (preachers established before the Great Awakening), and attended separatist meetings. In 1742, Clap closed the college, sending the students home. He was supported by the General Assembly, and many of the more ardent students transferred to other institutions when Yale reopened in 1743.

While he was feuding with the New Lights, Clap was partnering with the Anglicans. Beginning in 1740, he worked with the Rev. Samuel Johnson of Stratford, Connecticut, to reform Yale. He brought math and science into Yale&#x27;s curriculum, and undergraduate studies in divinity were replaced by Johnson&#x27;s non-denominational moral philosophy. Clap published a Yale library catalog in 1743, with an index system based on his friend Samuel Johnson&#x27;s map of learning, and drafted a new charter of the school, granted by the General Assembly in 1745, incorporating the institution as &quot;The President and Fellows of Yale College in New Haven&quot;. Clap was sworn in as Yale&#x27;s first President on June 1, 1745. His formulation of a new code of laws for Yale in Latin became, in 1745, the first book printed in New Haven.

Whitefield returned to New England to preach, and Yale issued &quot;The Declaration of the Rector and Tutors of Yale College against the Rev. Mr. George Whitefield, his Principles and Designs, in a Letter to him&quot;. In 1746, Clap expelled Samuel Cooke from the Yale Corporation for his role in setting up the separatist congregation in New Haven.

In May 1747, the General Assembly granted Yale the right to hold a lottery to raise funds: this income, together with the proceeds from the sale of a French boat captured by the colony&#x27;s frigate, were used to build Connecticut Hall, the second major structure at Yale. It was completed in 1753.

==Later religious conflict==

Clap, meanwhile, was concerned by the poor preaching of Joseph Noyes and by the initiation of Anglican services in New Haven. To avoid loss of students to the College of New Jersey (now Princeton), founded by those who had defended Brainerd&#x27;s expulsion, and to defend orthodoxy, he convinced the trustees to appoint him as professor of divinity and to authorize separate worship for the students each Sunday. Both the Old Lights and the Episcopalians objected to this. In 1753, Rev. Samuel Johnson wrote to Clap that were he to continue with separate worship, the Episcopalians would complain, and that the charter of 1745 would be found to be invalid, as only the King could make a corporation, and that Yale would cease to exist. Clap agreed to let the Anglican students attend their own church.

Perhaps more important to Clap than questions of religion, the New Lights increased their political power in the Connecticut Assembly and the state established Congregational Church. In 1754, Thomas Fitch, an outspoken Old Light, was elected governor, while William Pitkin, who supported the New Lights, was elected deputy governor, and almost all the Connecticut Congregationalist associations and consociations had New Light majorities.

Meanwhile, there were conflicts within the Corporation. Benjamin Gale, son-in-law of Jared Eliot, a corporation member, had published a pamphlet arguing for discontinuation of the colonial grant to the college, and no grant was given in 1755. Clap set out to raise an endowment for a professorship of divinity, and Naphtali Daggett was appointed the Livingstonian Professor of Divinity on March 4, 1756. Noyes offered to share his pulpit with the new professor, agreeing to subscribe to the Assembly&#x27;s Catechism and the Savoy Confession of Faith, and the students returned to his First Church for worship.

Clap, however, became disenchanted with Noyes&#x27; Old Light orthodoxy and poor preaching and obtained a decision that not only could Yale students worship separately, they could form their own congregation and administer Communion. The announcement of the corporation&#x27;s decision on June 30, 1757, was bitterly controversial, and, in the aftermath, discipline at the college collapsed. The General Assembly intervened, threatened a Yale &quot;visitation&quot;. Despite being now distrusted by both Old and New Light factions, Clap&#x27;s defense of the college as separate from the state caused the assembly to ultimately side with Clap.

He was not so successful with his own tutors and students. The student body was caught up in the rebellious spirit of the 1760s, resolving to drink no &quot;foreign spiritous Liquors any more&quot; and declaiming in chapel against the British Parliament, and petitioning the Corporation with their grievances, insisting on the removal of the disciplinarian Clap. The students stopped going to classes and prayers and generally abused the tutors, who resigned.

The corporation ordered an early spring vacation, and few undergraduates returned. President Clap offered his resignation at the corporation meeting in July 1766. He continued as the head of Yale until commencement on September 10, 1766, when he presided over his last commencement, delivered his valedictory address, and resigned. Professor Naphtali Daggett followed him as president &quot;pro tempore&quot;.

Clap died four months later in New Haven at the age of sixty-three.

Jackson Turner Main finds that teaching in colonial days was a poorly paid, part-time, temporary job. Young men typically moved on to more secure occupations as soon as possible. There was one great exception: Reverend Clap. At his death he lft an estate worth £6,656, including 600 acres of land. His wealth came from marriage and his attention to lucrative investments.

<text>The coat of arms of Manitoba is the heraldic symbol representing the Canadian province of Manitoba. The arms contains symbols reflecting Manitoba&#x27;s British heritage along with local symbols. At the upper part of the shield is the red cross of St. George, representing England. On the left, the unicorn represents Scotland. The lower portion of the shield features a bison standing atop a rock on a green background, a symbol of First Nations peoples of the area who derived food and clothing from the animal.

The original arms, consisting of only the shield, were granted by royal warrant of King Edward VII on 10 May 1905. The arms were further augmented with supporters, a crest, and motto, by a warrant of then-Governor General Ramon Hnatyshyn on 23 October 1992.

The shield also features on the provincial flag.

==History==
The coat of arms was augmented on 23 October 1992 by a vice-regal warrant of then-Governor General Ramon Hnatyshyn to include a crest, supporters, and motto.

==Symbolism==

<text>Lee is a common surname in English-speaking countries.

In Canada, &quot;Lee&quot; was the 4th-most-common surname outside of Quebec. In the United States during the 2000 census, &quot;Lee&quot; was the 22nd-most-common surname.

== Origins ==

=== England ===

There are several distinct origins of the Lee surname. The most common is derived from Old English &quot;lēah&quot;, meaning a meadow or forest clearing.

This developed variously into the surnames Lee, Lea, and Leigh.

=== Ireland ===

The name in Ireland has several diverse origins, resulting in widely dispersed clusters of the name in South Western, Western (Galway) and North Eastern Counties. One recognized root was the anglicization of the Irish surname &quot;Ó Laoidigh&quot; which resulted in several variants, such as Lee, Lea, and Maclee. Other Lees have English roots and still others may have derived from the Norman &quot;Du Lea&quot;. The 1901 Irish census list 4912 entries primarily in Galway, Dublin, Cork, Antrim, Limerick and Down counties.

=== Norway ===

Originating from Norway as &quot;Lie&quot;, this surname was altered when it arrived in the Americas in the late 1800s to fit the English language&#x27;s pronunciation.

<text>Streatham Hill railway station is one of three stations serving the district of Streatham, in the London Borough of Lambeth. It is measured from . The wooden station building at street level faces the busy &quot;Streatham High Road&quot; (A23) at the junction with &quot;Leigham Court Road&quot;. Services are operated by Southern.

Access to the platforms – which are in a cutting below street level, and which continue under a bridge beneath the road – is possible via a pair of staircases or lifts. A project to replace the staircases and introduce lift access was completed in 2009. The station is served by Class 377s.

== History ==

The railway station was opened by the West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway on 1 December 1856, originally being named &#x27;Streatham&#x27;. Trains were operated from the outset by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway. It was renamed Streatham &amp; Brixton Hill on 1 September 1868 before receiving its present name on 1 January 1869.

There is a depot for maintenance of the passenger carriages at the London end of the station. Some of the lighting gantries above the sidings are remains of the pioneering &quot;overhead electric&quot; power supply that the LB&amp;SCR introduced on this line on 12 May 1911. This was abandoned in June 1928 when the Southern Railway replaced it with third rail electrification.

== Services ==
All services at Streatham Hill are operated by Southern using EMUs.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to 

During the evening, the services between London Victoria and West Croydon do not run.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 45, 50, 57, 109, 133, 159, 201, 250, 255, 319, 333, 417 and P13 and night routes N109, N133 and N137 serve the station.

<text>Boyd&#x27;s syllabic shorthand is a system of shorthand invented by Robert Boyd, published originally in 1903, and updated in 1912. In this system, symbols are distinguished both by orientation and by shape, with the shape representing the vowel and the orientation the consonant. Thus, &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;am&quot; would be represented by the same shape of mark (in this case an L-shape), oriented differently; and &quot;ab&quot; and &quot;eb&quot; would be represented by differently shaped marks, oriented the same way.Syllables with the vowel &quot;a&quot; are represented by L shapes. Those with the vowel &quot;e&quot; are hook-ended, approximately shaped like a &quot;J.&quot; (However, a smaller version of the same shape represents an extra consonant without a vowel.) Most of the syllables with the vowel &quot;i&quot; have a shape like the &quot;a&quot; series, except that the angle between the short tick and the long line is approximately 45° rather than 90°; there are a few &quot;i&quot; forms that do not fit the pattern (such as &quot;is&quot; and &quot;it&quot;) because they are especially common, and some of the forms that might be expected to represent &quot;i&quot; plus a consonant have been turned to other purposes, such as the prefix &quot;circum-.&quot; The syllables with the vowel &quot;o&quot; have ovaline ends, and those with &quot;u&quot; have hooks like those of the &quot;e&quot; series, but the main, longer part of the mark is curved, rather than straight.

In addition to these syllables, there are several additional characters including a simple straight line, a shallow curve, and a line with a curl at the end. These are assigned arbitrarily to combinations of sounds such as &quot;fl,&quot; &quot;sp,&quot; &quot;gr,&quot; and &quot;ch.&quot; The 1912 edition of the system expands the use of these characters to include longer sequences like &quot;contr&quot; and &quot;circum.&quot;

Letters and reversal of them, are similar to optical telegraph letters.

<text>Aeshnidae, also called aeshnids, hawkers, or darners, is a family of dragonflies, found nearly worldwide, with more than 50 genera and over 450 species. 

The family includes some of the largest dragonflies.

==Description==
Common worldwide or nearly worldwide genera are &quot;Aeshna&quot; and &quot;Anax&quot;. &quot;Anax&quot; includes some of the largest dragonflies, including the North American &quot;A. walsinghami&quot;, Hawaiian &quot;A. strenuus&quot;, European &quot;A. imperator&quot; and &quot;A. immaculifrons&quot;, and African &quot;A. tristis&quot;, but these are all exceeded by another member of the family, the Asian &quot;Tetracanthagyna plagiata&quot;, which by wingspan and weight is the world&#x27;s largest dragonfly.

There are 41 North American species in 11 genera in this family. Most European species belong to &quot;Aeshna&quot;. Their American name &quot;darner&quot; stems from the female abdomens looking like a sewing needle, as they cut into plant stem when they lay their eggs through the ovipositor.

The dragonflies mate in flight. The eggs are deposited in water or close by. The larvae (nymphs or naiads) are generally slender compared to those of other families, with a long and flat extensible lower lip (labium). The larvae are aquatic predators, feeding on other insects and even small fish.

The adults spend large amounts of time in the air and seem to fly tirelessly with their four large and powerful wings. They can fly forwards or backwards or hover like a helicopter. The wings are always extended horizontally.

Their abdomens are long and thin. Most are colored blue and or green, with black and occasionally yellow. Their large, hemispherical, compound eyes touch in the midline and nearly cover their heads. They have an extremely good sight, and are voracious insect predators, using their sharp, biting mouthparts. They are therefore very beneficial to mankind.

All are extremely hard to catch because of their flying abilities and keen sight.

==Taxonomy and genera==
The name Aeshnidae was first proposed as a family by Elford Leach in 1815.

The spelling of Aeshnidae may have resulted from a printer&#x27;s error in spelling the Greek &quot;Aechma&quot;, &quot;a spear&quot;. The spelling Aeschnidae has been intermittently used over a period of time, but is now abandoned for the original name Aeshnidae. However, derived genus names (such as &quot;Rhionaeschna&quot;) retain the &#x27;sch&#x27; spelling, as this is how they were first cited.

<text>Corey Burton is an American voice actor. He is the current voice of Captain Hook, Ludwig Von Drake and others for The Walt Disney Company, Shockwave on &quot;The Transformers&quot;, Brainiac in the DC Animated Universe, Count Dooku and Cad Bane in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise, Zeus in &quot;&quot; and the &quot;God of War&quot; series, and Hugo Strange in &quot;&quot;.

==Career==
===Early career===
Burton started his career at age 17 under the stage name Corey Weinman, with an imitation performance of Hans Conried for Disney. He studied radio acting with Daws Butler for four years and went on to work with nearly all of the original Hollywood radio actors in classic-style radio dramas. He was unsure at first about pursuing voice-work, due to his shy demeanor and Asperger syndrome, but credits the diverse world and character design of Disney&#x27;s The Haunted Mansion attraction as his inspiration to move forward.

===Disney===
Burton has done extensive voice-work for Disney, including animated features and theme park attractions at the Disneyland Resort, Walt Disney World, and Tokyo Disney Resort. He provided the narration for many of the behind-the-scenes programs of Disney movies on many of their VHS issues from the 1990s. He provided the voice of Captain Hook in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Return to Never Land&quot; and dubbed the voice of Deems Taylor in &quot;Fantasia&quot; for the film&#x27;s 2000 and 2010 re-releases.

Burton has voiced sound-alikes and original characters for over 50 Disney Storyteller records. His roles include:
* Ludwig Von Drake since 1987
* Dale and Zipper in &quot;Chip &#x27;n Dale Rescue Rangers&quot;.
* The How-to Narrator in &quot;Goof Troop&quot; and later Disney media
* The White Rabbit and Mad Hatter in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;.
* Gruffi Gummi and Toadwart in &quot;Adventures of the Gummi Bears&quot; (following the death of Bill Scott).
* Zeus in the animated series &quot;Hercules&quot; (replacing Rip Torn).
* Quint and Speedy the Snail in &quot;Timon &amp; Pumbaa&quot;.
* Gaetan &quot;Mole&quot; Molière in &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;.
* Ansem the Wise in the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series.
* Professor Owl in the &quot;Disney Sing-Along Songs&quot; series.
* King Stefan in &quot;Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams&quot;.
* Buzz Lightyear in the Disney on Ice adaptation of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot;.
* Yen Sid and Captain Hook in the &quot;Epic Mickey&quot; and &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series.
* Doc Hudson in various &quot;Cars&quot; media and &quot;Radiator Springs Racers&quot; (replacing Paul Newman).
* General Knowledge from the former Cranium Command attraction at Epcot.
* Dale, Bruno Biggs, and Moe Whiplash from &quot;Walt Disney World Quest: Magical Racing Tour&quot;.
* Mayor Loudmouth from The Adventures of the Eto Rangers.
* Doctor Buscona from Animalistics Unleashed.
* Goji Rokakku from JSRF: Jet Set Radio Future.

===Paul Frees===
Burton, for many years, served as a protégé to voice actor Paul Frees. Following Frees&#x27; death and his son Fred&#x27;s temporary takeover, Burton stepped in and imitated Frees&#x27; voice as the Ghost Host in Disneyland&#x27;s Haunted Mansion Holiday attraction. He also recited the classic line &quot;Welcome, foolish mortals&quot; in the opening of the 2003 film adaption and currently serves as the Ghost Host&#x27;s voice in every Haunted Mansion franchise-related media, adoptions, and events.

He was approached to record a new safety spiel for the intro to the original Haunted Mansion ride. He declined and the spiel was instead recorded by voice actor Joe Leahy.

He provides many other Paul Frees-like voices for Disneyland Park, including several newer pirates in the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction (like the &quot;Pooped Pirate&quot; and the pirate voice that guides you on and off the boat), Grumpy on the Seven Dwarfs Mine Train attraction, and several voices in Mr. Toad&#x27;s Wild Ride.

He performed another Frees imitation for comedian Stan Freberg&#x27;s album &quot;Stan Freberg Presents The United States of America, Volume Two&quot;.

He performed a Frees imitation as the voice of the announcer in the 1999 film &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; and did likewise as the voices of the alien foreheads in Larry Blamire&#x27;s 2008 satire &quot;Trail of the Screaming Forehead&quot;.

===&quot;Transformers&quot;===
Burton appeared as Shockwave, Sunstreaker, Brawn, and Spike Witwicky in the original &quot;Transformers&quot; animated series by Sunbow Productions and Marvel Productions. He would later voice Megatron, Ratchet, Ironhide, Brawn, Cyrus &quot;The Colossus&quot; Rhodes, Spike Witwicky, and Longarm Prime / Shockwave in &quot;&quot; by Cartoon Network.

Burton stated in an interview that Shockwave was by far his favorite character to perform in the original series. Despite this, he turned down the offer to reprise the role in &quot;&quot;, as he felt he had voiced the character enough times. Consequently, the part was given to Frank Welker, the voice of Megatron / Galvatron.

===&quot;Star Wars&quot;===
For &quot;Star Wars&quot;, Burton voiced Count Dooku, Cad Bane, and Ziro the Hutt in &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars,&quot; and has continued to voice Cad Bane in &quot;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&quot; and &quot;The Book of Boba Fett&quot;. He has also voiced several characters in video games.

===&quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;===
For the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; series, Burton voiced Ansem the Wise in &quot;Chain of Memories&quot;, &quot;Birth by Sleep&quot;, and &quot;Dream Drop Distance&quot; due to Christopher Lee&#x27;s health problems. For the cinematic version of &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;, he re-dubbed Lee&#x27;s lines that he had previously recorded for the Nintendo DS version. He reprised his role as Ansem the Wise for &quot;Kingdom Hearts III.&quot;

===Brainiac===
Burton has portrayed the supervillain Brainiac in the DC Animated Universe. He appeared as the character in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Justice League&quot;, &quot;Static Shock&quot;, and &quot;Justice League Unlimited&quot;, as well as the non-DCAU media &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;, &quot;DC Universe Online&quot;, and &quot;Lego DC Super-Villains&quot;.

<doc id="344064" wikidata="Q11983535" url="?curid=344064" title="Lee (Korean surname)">
<text>Lee, I, or Yi () is the second-most-common surname in Korea, behind Kim (). As of the South Korean census of 2015, there were 7,306,828 people by this name in South Korea or 14.7% of the population.

Historically, was written as Ni () in Korea. The spelling formally changed to I () in 1933 when the initial sound rule () was established. In North Korea, it is romanized as [[McCune–Reischauer|Ri]] () because there is no distinction between the alveolar liquids /l/ and /r/ in modern Korean.

==Latin-alphabet spelling==
Though the Revised Romanization spelling of this surname is I, South Korea&#x27;s National Institute of the Korean Language noted in 2001 that one-letter surnames were quite rare in English and other foreign languages and could cause difficulties when traveling abroad. However, the NIKL still hoped to promote systemic transcriptions for use in passports, and thus recommended that people who bore this surname should spell it Yi in the Roman alphabet.

However, the majority of South Koreans with this surname continue to spell it as Lee, because conditions for changing passport names are strict. In a study based on 2007 application data for South Korean passports, it was found that 98.5% of people with this surname spelled it in Latin letters as &quot;Lee&quot; in their passports, while only 1.0% spelled it &quot;Yi&quot;.

A few people with this surname historically spelled it Ye, as in Ye Wanyong of the Korean Empire. Rhee has also been used, as in Syngman Rhee and Simon Hang-bock Rhee.

==Clans==

As with all Korean family names, the holders of the &quot;Yi&quot; surname are divided into patrilineal clans, or lineages, known in Korean as &quot;bon-gwan&quot;, based on their ancestral seat. Most such clans trace their lineage back to a specific founder, and are generally not related to one another. This system was at its height under the &quot;yangban&quot; aristocracy of Joseon, but it remains in use today. There are approximately 241 such clans claimed by South Koreans. Most people with surname Yi () in Korea belong to either the Jeonju or Gyeongju clans. Also, surnames Yi () and Yi () each have a different clans.

===Jeonju clan===

The founder of this clan was Yi Han, a native of Baekje who later married a Silla princess and became a high-ranking official in Silla. His 22nd-generation descendant, Yi Seong-gye, went on to found the Joseon Dynasty. The House of Yi ruled the country for 518 years (between 1392 and 1910) and established many of the cultural, artistic and linguistic foundations for modern-day Korea.

During its reign, the House of Yi consolidated its effective rule over the territory of current Korea, which encouraged the entrenchment of Confucian ideals and doctrines in Korean society, imported and adapted Chinese culture, and promoted classical Korean culture, trade, science, literature, and technology.

, the pretender to the Joseon throne is Yi Seok. Members of the different branches of Jeonju Yi survived until the formation of the current Republic of Korea. Many families claim membership in the House of Yi, but few actually descend from this lineage. South Korea&#x27;s first president, Syngman Rhee, claims descent from the lineage.

===Gyeongju clan===

The founder of the Gyeongju clan was Yi Al-pyeong (), one of the village headmen who chose Park Hyeokgeose as the first King of Silla. According to the &quot;Samguk Sagi&quot;, the Yi name was officially bestowed on the family by King Yuri around 9 CE.

The Gyeongju Yi clan, according to the 2000 South Korean census, numbered over 1.4 million individuals, making it the most numerous of the clans that bear the surname Yi.

===Jinwi clan===

The Jinwi clan is a family that turned out six queens during the Joseon Dynasty. Lee Bang, who served as an adviser to the king and a teacher to the crown prince in the early Goryeo Dynasty, is the founder. Lee Bang&#x27;s ancestors are the descendant of Lee Geomyeong, an ancestor of Gyeongju Lee Clan.

===Pyeongchang clan===
The founder of the Pyeongchang clan was Yi Gwang, an official and military commander during the Joseon Dynasty. Yi Seung-hun, who was the first person that brought Catholicism to Korea, was a member of this clan. This was a &quot;yangban&quot; clan, founded somewhere between 1580 and 1607.

===Deoksu clan===
The founder of this clan was Yi Dong-su, an official of the Goryeo period. This was a prominent &quot;yangban&quot; clan during the Joseon Dynasty, producing figures including the legendary admiral Yi Sun-sin and the highly influential government official and philosopher Yi I. The clan takes immense pride in producing both Korea&#x27;s top military commander and arguably top scholar. Both Yi Sun-shin and Yi I are depicted on South Korea&#x27;s money and have taekwondo forms named in their honor. The clan seat, corresponds to Deoksu-&quot;hyeon&quot;, an old division of what is now Kaepung County, North Korea.

===Jinbo clan===
The Jinbo Yi clan was known for the famous Joseon scholar Yi Hwang, who founded the Yeongnam School and started a private Confucian academy. He also became one of the 18 Sages of Korea (). The progenitor of this clan was Yi Seok of the Goryeo Dynasty.

===Seongju clan===
The founder of this clan was Yi Sun-yu, a prominent official of late Silla. His 12th-generation descendant, Yi Jang-gyeong, was also a prominent official during the Goryeo Dynasty. Eight generations of Jang Kyung&#x27;s descendants yielded 75 civil examination qualifiers. As of the 2000 census, 186,188 Koreans of the Seongju Yi clan live in South Korea.

===Hongju clan===
The founder of the Hongju Yi clan was Yi Yu-seong, a member of the King&#x27;s inner circle during late Goryeo. The clan&#x27;s ancestral seat was bestowed when his 9th generation descendant, Yi Gi-jong, was titled. Hongyang/Hongju is located in present-day Hongseong County, South Chungcheong Province. Especially during the late Goryeo and early Joseon Dynasties, the Hongju Yi clan produced many influential people, including Yi Jong-jang.

===Yeonan clan===

The Yeonan Yi clan were aristocrats during the Joseon Dynasty. Several members were Chief State Councillors. The clan also had a high number of Chief Scholars during that period. The progenitor was Yi Mu, who came from Tang China.

===Hansan clan===
It is based in Hansan-&quot;myeon&quot;, Seocheon County, South Chungcheong Province. There are two different branches (Hojanggong family and Kwonjigong family). The founder of this clan is Yi Yoon-kyung. One member of the clan is Yi Saek, a Confucian scholar during late Goryeo. He founded an academy that educated the founders of Joseon. The Hansan Yi clan also produced many scholars in the Joseon Dynasty such as Yi San-hae. Modern figures belonging to Hansan Yi clan include Yi Sang-jae, an independence activist during the Japanese occupation.

<text>The Dirty War () is the name used by the military junta or civic-military dictatorship of Argentina () for its period of state terrorism in Argentina from 1974 to 1983. During this campaign, military and security forces and death squads in the form of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA, or Triple A) hunted down any political dissidents and anyone believed to be associated with socialism, left-wing Peronism, or the Montoneros movement.

It is estimated that between 22,000 and 30,000 people were killed or disappeared, many of whom were impossible to formally document due to the nature of state terrorism; however, Argentine military intelligence at the time estimated that 22,000 people had been murdered or disappeared by 1978. The primary targets were communist guerrillas and sympathisers but also included students, militants, trade unionists, writers, journalists, artists and any citizens suspected of being left-wing activists. The disappeared included those thought to be a political or ideological threat to the junta. According to human rights organisations in Argentina, between 1,900 and 3,000 Jews were among the 30,000 who were targeted by the Argentine military junta. It is a disproportionate number, as Jews comprised between 5–12% of those targeted but only 1% of the population. All were killed in an attempt by the junta to silence social and political opposition.

By the 1980s, economic collapse, public discontent, and the disastrous handling of the Falklands War resulted in the end of the junta and the restoration of democracy in Argentina, effectively ending the Dirty War. Many members of the junta are currently in prison for crimes against humanity and genocide. The Dirty War left a profound impact on Argentine culture, which is still felt to this day.

== Overview ==

In the decades before the 1976 coup, the Argentine military, supported by the Argentine establishment, opposed Juan Perón&#x27;s populist government and attempted a coup in 1951 before succeeding in 1955 with the Revolución Libertadora. After taking control, the armed forces proscribed Peronism, a decision that triggered the organization of Peronist resistance in workplaces and trade unions, as the working classes sought to protect the economic and social improvements obtained under Perón&#x27;s rule. Over time, as democratic rule was partially restored, but promises of legalizing the expression and political liberties for Peronism were not respected, guerrilla groups began to operate in the 1960s, namely &quot;Uturuncos&quot; and the EGP (People&#x27;s Guerrilla Army).

As Perón returned from exile in 1973, the Ezeiza massacre marked the end of the alliance between left- and right-wing factions of Peronism. In 1974, Perón withdrew his support for Montoneros shortly before his death. By the time his widow Isabel was president, the Minister of Social Welfare José López Rega had already organized the far-right death squad known as Argentine Anticommunist Alliance (AAA, or Triple A). In 1975, during Operativo Independencia, Isabel Perón and later her replacement Ítalo Luder signed four decrees empowering the military and the police to &quot;annihilate&quot; left-wing &quot;subversive elements&quot;.

The junta, calling itself the National Reorganization Process, organized and carried out strong repression of political dissidents (or perceived as such) through the government&#x27;s military and security forces. They were responsible for the arrest, torture, killings and/or forced disappearances of an estimated 22,000 to 30,000 people. With the help of Washington, the junta was aided with $50 million in military aid. Prior to the 1976 coup, the Alianza Anticomunista Argentina, otherwise known as Triple A, was another far right group which provoked many deaths and installed methods that continued to be used by the dictatorship. Both the juntas and Triple A targeted young professionals, high school and college students and trade union members. These groups of people became main targets because of their involvement in political organizations that resisted the work of the right-wing group. Assassinations were carried out via mass shootings and &quot;death flights&quot;, the throwing of people from airplanes into the South Atlantic. Additionally, 12,000 prisoners, many of whom had not been convicted through legal processes, were detained in a network of 340 secret concentration camps located throughout Argentina. Military personnel, such as Navy captain Adolfo Scilingo, who was tried for genocide, 30 counts of murder, 93 of causing injury, 255 of terrorism and 286 of torture. These actions against victims called &quot;desaparecidos&quot; because they simply &quot;disappeared&quot; without explanation were confirmed via Scilingo, who has publicly confessed his participation in the Dirty War, stating that the Argentine military &quot;did worse things than the Nazis&quot;. In 1983, the National commission on Disappeared People forced Scilingo to testify where he described how &quot;prisoners were drugged, loaded onto military planes, and thrown, naked and semi-conscious, into the Atlantic Ocean&quot;. A vast majority of those who were killed disappeared without a trace and no record of their fate.

The junta referred to their policy of suppressing opponents as the National Reorganization Process (&quot;Proceso de Reorganización Nacional&quot;). Argentine military and security forces also created paramilitary death squads, operating behind &quot;fronts&quot; as supposedly independent units. Argentina coordinated actions with other South American dictatorships during Operation Condor. Faced with increasing public opposition and severe economic problems, the military tried to regain popularity by occupying the disputed Falkland Islands. During the resulting Falklands War, the military government lost any remaining popularity after Argentina&#x27;s defeat by Britain, forcing it to step aside in disgrace and allow for free elections to be held in late 1983.

=== Restoration of democracy and trial of the juntas ===
The democratic government of Raúl Alfonsín was elected to office in 1983. Alfonsín organized the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (&quot;Comisión Nacional sobre la Desaparición de Personas&quot;, CONADEP) to investigate crimes committed during the Dirty War, and heard testimony from hundreds of witnesses and began to build cases against offenders. The commission organized a tribunal to conduct a transparent prosecution of offenders, holding the Trial of the Juntas in 1985. Among the nearly 300 people prosecuted, many of the leading officers were charged, convicted and sentenced for their crimes.

The Argentine armed forces opposed subjecting more of its personnel to the trials, threatening the civilian leadership with another coup. In 1986, the military forced the passage of the &quot;Ley de Punto Final&quot; (Full Stop Law) in 1986, which &quot;put a line&quot; under previous actions and ended prosecutions for crimes committed by the National Reorganization Process. Fearing military uprisings, Argentina&#x27;s first two presidents sentenced only the two top Dirty War former commanders. The Punto Final Law stated that military personnel involved in torture were doing their &quot;jobs&quot;. In 1994, President Carlos Menem praised the military in their &quot;fight against subversion&quot;.

=== Repeal of laws ===
In 2003, Congress repealed the Pardon Laws, and in 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court ruled they were unconstitutional. Under the presidency of Nestor Kirchner, the Argentine government re-opened its investigations on crimes against humanity and genocide in 2006 and began the prosecution of military and security officers.

== Origin of the term ==
The term &quot;Dirty War&quot; was used by the military junta, which claimed that a war, albeit with &quot;different&quot; methods (including the large-scale application of torture and rape), was necessary to maintain social order and eradicate political subversives. This explanation has been questioned in court by human rights NGOs, as it suggests that a &quot;civil war&quot; was going on and implies justification for the killings. During the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, public prosecutor Julio Strassera suggested that the term &quot;Dirty War&quot; was a &quot;euphemism to try to conceal gang activities&quot; as though they were legitimate military activities.

Although the junta said its objective was to eradicate guerrilla activity because of its threat to the state, it conducted wide-scale repression of the general population. It worked against all political opposition and those it considered on the left: trade unionists (half of the victims), students, intellectuals including journalists and writers, rights activists and other civilians and their families. Many others went into exile to survive and many remain in exile today despite the return of democracy in 1983. During the Trial of the Juntas, the prosecution established that the guerrillas were never strong enough to pose a real threat to the state and could not be considered a belligerent as in a war:

The guerrilla had not taken control of any part of the national territory; they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency, they were not massively supported by any foreign power, and they lacked the population&#x27;s support.

The program of extermination of dissidents was referred to as genocide by a court of law for the first time during the trial of Miguel Etchecolatz, a former senior official of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police.

Crimes committed during this time (genocide of civilian population and other crimes against humanity) are not covered under the laws of war (&quot;jus in bello&quot;), which shields enlisted personnel from prosecution for acts committed under orders given by a superior officer or the state. Estela de Carlotto, president of the Argentine human rights non-governmental organization Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo states:

[That term] is a way to minimize state terrorism and is a term born outside the country. It is a totally wrong concept; there was no war, dirty nor clean.

== Previous events ==

=== Return of Peronism ===

In 1955, former army officer Juan Perón was ousted from the presidency by a coup (&quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot;) three months after the Bombing of Plaza de Mayo, a failed coup attempt considered by some as state terrorism. Since then Peronism was proscribed and hostility against it and against populist politics dominated Argentine politics. Pedro Eugenio Aramburu&#x27;s Decree Law 4161/56 prohibited the use of Perón&#x27;s name and when General Lanusse, who was part of the Argentine Revolution, called for elections in 1973, he authorized the return of political parties. However, Perón, who had been invited back from exile, was barred from seeking office.

In May 1973, Peronist Héctor José Cámpora was elected as president, but everyone understood that Perón was the real power behind him, as Cámpora&#x27;s campaign stated. Peronism has been difficult to define according to traditional political classifications and different periods must be distinguished. A populist and nationalist movement, it has sometimes been accused of fascist tendencies. Following nearly two decades of weak civilian governments, economic decline and military interventionism, Perón returned from exile on 20 June in 1973, as the country was becoming engulfed in financial, social and political disorder. The months preceding his return were marked by important social movements as in the rest of South America and in particular of the Southern Cone before the military intervention of the 1970s, thus during Héctor Cámpora&#x27;s first months of government (May–July 1973) approximately 600 social conflicts, strikes and factory occupations had taken place.

Upon Perón&#x27;s arrival at Buenos Aires Airport, snipers opened fire on the crowds of left-wing Peronist sympathizers. Known as the 1973 Ezeiza massacre, this event marked the split between left-wing and right-wing factions of Peronism. Perón was re-elected in 1973, backed by a broad coalition that ranged from trade unionists in the center to fascists on the right (including members of the neo-fascist &quot;Movimiento Nacionalista Tacuara&quot;) and socialists like the Montoneros on the left. Following the Ezeiza massacre and Perón&#x27;s denouncing of &quot;bearded immature idealists&quot;, Perón sided with the Peronist right, the trade unionist bureaucracy and Radical Civic Union of Ricardo Balbín, Cámpora&#x27;s unsuccessful rival at the May 1973 elections. Some leftist Peronist governors were deposed, among them Ricardo Obregón Cano, governor of Córdoba, who was ousted by a police coup in February 1974. According to historian Servetto, &quot;the Peronist right... thus stimulated the intervention of security forces to resolve internal conflicts of Peronism&quot;.

On 19 January 1974, the Trotskyist People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army attacked the military garrison in the Buenos Aires city of Azul, prompting a harsh response from the then constitutional president Juan Perón and contributing to his shift towards the rightist faction of the justicialist movement during the last months of his life.

Extreme right wing vigilante organizations—linked to Triple A or its kind of &quot;subsidiary&quot; Córdoba &quot;Comando Libertadores de América&quot;—assassinated the union leader and ex-Peronist governor of Córdoba, Atilio López, as well as leftist lawyers Rodolfo Ortega Peña and Silvio Frondizi - brother of the ousted former Argentine president Arturo Frondizi, who had served as first president between May 1, 1958, and March 29, 1962. Also in 1974, the Third World priest Carlos Mugica and dozens of political activists from left.

=== Isabel Perón&#x27;s government ===
Juan Perón died on 1 July 1974 and was replaced by his vice president and third wife, Isabel Perón, who ruled Argentina until she was overthrown in March 1976 by the military. The 1985 CONADEP human rights commission counted 458 assassinations from 1973 to 1975 in its report &quot;Nunca Más&quot; (&quot;Never Again&quot;): 19 in 1973, 50 in 1974 and 359 in 1975, carried out by paramilitary groups, who acted mostly under the José López Rega&#x27;s parapolice and paramilitary Triple A death squad (according to &quot;Argenpress&quot;, at least 25 trade-unionists were assassinated in 1974). However, the repression of the social movements had already started before the attempt on Yrigoyen&#x27;s life: on 17 July 1973, the CGT section in Salta was closed while the CGT, SMATA and Luz y Fuerza in Córdoba were victims of armed attacks. Agustín Tosco, Secretary General of Luz y Fuerza, successfully avoided arrest and went into hiding until his death on 5 November 1975.

Trade unionists were also targeted by the repression in 1973 as Carlos Bache was assassinated on 21 August 1973; Enrique Damiano, of the Taxis Trade Union of Córdoba, on 3 October; Juan Avila, also of Córdoba, the following day; Pablo Fredes, on 30 October in Buenos Aires; and Adrián Sánchez, on 8 November 1973 in the Province of Jujuy. Assassinations of trade unionists, lawyers and so on continued and increased in 1974 and 1975 while the most combative trade unions were closed and their leaders arrested. In August 1974, Isabel Perón&#x27;s government took away the rights of trade unionist representation of the &quot;Federación Gráfica Bonaerense&quot;, whose Secretary General Raimundo Ongaro was arrested in October 1974. During the same month of August 1974, the SMATA Córdoba trade-union, in conflict with the company Ika Renault, was closed by the national direction of trade unions and the majority of its leaders and activists arrested. Most of them were assassinated during the 1976–1983 dictatorship. Atilio López, General Secretary of the CGT of Córdoba and former Vice Governor of the Province, was assassinated in Buenos Aires on 16 September 1974.

Peronist guerrillas, estimated at 300 to 400 active members (Montoneros) in 1977 (and 2000 at its peak in 1975, though almost half of them related to militia), committed a number of attacks during this period such as bombings at the Goodyear and Firestone distributors, Riker and Eli pharmaceutical laboratories, Xerox Corporation, and Pepsi-Cola bottling companies. Director-general of the Fiat Concord company in Argentina was kidnapped by ERP guerrillas in Buenos Aires on 21 March 1972 and found murdered on 10 April. In 1973, a Ford Motor Company executive was killed in a kidnapping attempt. A Peugeot representative was kidnapped and later released for a reported US$200,000, and FAP guerrillas killed John Swint, the American general manager of the Ford Motor Company. On December, the director of Peugeot in Argentina was kidnapped. 
In 1974, FAP guerrillas killed the labour relations manager of the IKA-Renault Motor Company in Córdoba. In 1975 a manager of an auto parts factory and a production manager of Mercedes-Benz were kidnapped by Montoneros, and an executive of the US Chrysler Corporation and a manager of the Renault plant in Córdoba were killed. In 1976, Enrique Aroza Garay of German-owned Borgward automobile factory and a Chrysler executive were killed. In all, 83 servicemen and policemen were killed in left-wing guerrilla incidents.

==== Annihilation decrees ====

In 1975, the Guevarist People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army (ERP), inspired by Che Guevara&#x27;s foco theory, began a small rural insurgency in the province of Tucumán with no more than 100 men and women, but were soon defeated by the Argentine Army. In February 1975, Isabel Perón signed the secret presidential decree 261, which ordered the army to illegally neutralize and/or &quot;annihilate&quot; the insurgency in Tucumán, the smallest province in Argentina. &quot;Operativo Independencia&quot; granted power to the armed forces to &quot;execute all military operations necessary for the effects of neutralizing or annihilating the action of subversive elements acting in the Province of Tucumán&quot;. Extreme right-wing death squads used their hunt for far-left guerrillas as a pretext to exterminate any and all ideological opponents on the left and as a cover for common crimes.

In July, there was a general strike. The government, presided temporarily by provisional president of the Senate Ítalo Luder from the Peronist party, replacing Isabel (who was ill for a short period), issued three decrees, 2770, 2771 and 2772. These created a Defense Council headed by the president and including his ministers and chiefs of the armed forces. It was given the command of the national and provincial police and correctional facilities and its mission was to &quot;annihilate [...] subversive elements throughout the country&quot;.

==== March 1975 raid in Santa Fe ====
Isabel Perón&#x27;s government ordered a raid on 20 March 1975, which involved 4,000 military and police officers, in Villa Constitución, Santa Fe in response to various trade-unionist conflicts. Many citizens and 150 activists and trade unionist leaders were arrested while the Unión Obrera Metalúrgica&#x27;s subsidiary in Villa Constitución was closed down with the agreement of the trade unions&#x27; national direction, headed by Lorenzo Miguel. Repression affected trade unionists of large firms such as Ford, Fiat, Renault, Mercedes-Benz, Peugeot and Chrysler and was sometimes carried on with support from the firms&#x27; executives and from the trade unionist bureaucracies.

== Military&#x27;s rise to power ==

The sentence at the Trials of the Juntas stated the following: &quot;The subversives had not taken control of any part of the national territory; they had not obtained recognition of interior or anterior belligerency, they were not massively supported by any foreign power, and they lacked the population&#x27;s support&quot;. However, the supposed threat was used for the coup.

In 1975, President Isabel Perón, under pressure from the military establishment, appointed Jorge Rafael Videla commander-in-chief of the Argentine Army. &quot;As many people as necessary must die in Argentina so that the country will again be secure&quot;, declared Videla in 1975 in support of the death squads. He was one of the military heads of the coup that overthrew Isabel Perón on 24 March 1976. In her place, a military junta, headed by General Jorge Rafael Videla, Admiral Emilio Eduardo Massera and General Orlando Agosti and was installed.

The junta, which dubbed itself National Reorganization Process, systematized the repression, in particular through the way of &quot;forced disappearances&quot; (&quot;desaparecidos&quot;), which made it very difficult as was the case in Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s Chile to file legal suits as the bodies were never found. This generalization of state terror tactics has been explained in part by the information received by the Argentine military in the infamous School of Americas and also by French instructors from the secret services, who taught them &quot;counter-insurgency&quot; tactics first experimented during the Algerian War (1954–1962).

By 1976, Operation Condor was at its height. Chilean exiles in Argentina were threatened again and had to seek refuge in a third country. Chilean General Carlos Prats had already been assassinated by the Chilean DINA in Buenos Aires in 1974, with the help of former DINA agents Michael Townley and Enrique Arancibia. Cuban diplomats were also assassinated in Buenos Aires in the infamous &quot;Automotores Orletti&quot; torture center, one of the 300 clandestine prisons of the dictatorship, managed by the &quot;Grupo de Tareas 18&quot;, headed by Aníbal Gordon, previously convicted for armed robbery and who answered directly to the General Commandant of the SIDE, Otto Paladino. &quot;Automotores Orletti&quot; was the main base of foreign intelligence services involved in Operation Condor. One of its survivors, José Luis Bertazzo, who was detained for two months there, identified Chileans, Uruguayans, Paraguayans and Bolivians among the prisoners. These captives were interrogated by agents from their own countries.

According to John Dinges&#x27;s &quot;Los años del Cóndor&quot;, Chilean MIR prisoners in Orletti center told José Luis Bertazzo that they had seen two Cuban diplomats, Jesús Cejas Arias and Crescencio Galañega, tortured by Gordon&#x27;s group and interrogated by a man who came from Miami to interrogate them. The two Cuban diplomats, charged with the protection of the Cuban ambassador to Argentina Emilio Aragonés, had been kidnapped on 9 August 1976 by 40 armed SIDE agents who blocked off all sides of the street with their Ford Falcons, the cars used by the security forces during the dictatorship. According to John Dinges, the FBI as well as the CIA were informed of their abduction. In his book, Dinges published a cable sent by Robert Scherrer, an FBI agent in Buenos Aires on 22 September 1976, where he mentions in passing that Michael Townley, later convicted of the assassination on 21 September 1976 of former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C., had also taken part to the interrogation of the two Cubans. The former head of the DINA confirmed to Argentine federal judge María Servini de Cubría on 22 December 1999, in Santiago de Chile, the presence of Townley and Cuban Guillermo Novo Sampoll in the Orletti center. The two men traveled from Chile to Argentina on 11 August 1976 and &quot;cooperated in the torture and assassination of the two Cuban diplomats&quot;. According to the &quot;terror archives&quot; discovered in Paraguay in 1992, 50,000 persons were murdered in the frame of Condor, 22,000–30,000 disappeared (desaparecidos) and 400,000 incarcerated.

== Civil accomplices ==

There were also some companies complicit in crimes against humanity. There has been participation of senior executives of Ford, Mercedes-Benz, Acindar, Dálmine Siderca, Ingenio Ledesma, and Astarsa

Victoria Basualdo, from Columbia University, investigated the complicity between large companies and armed forces. She found six companies in which dozens of union representatives were kidnapped and tortured, often detained inside the companies and transferred to clandestine detention centers (CDC) in vehicles provided by the companies. In the case of Dálmine Siderca, a CDC had been installed next to the factory, connected through a door. In the case of Acindar, a detention and interrogation center, staffed and operated by the Federal Police, was already in existence in 1975 during the Peronist government of Maria Estela Martinez de Peron.

Judge Alicia Vence was in charge of the investigation of acts of State terrorism committed in facilities and with the participation of authorities of the companies Ford and Mercedes-Benz. According to witnesses, the center at Mercedes Benz was led by the racing driver Juan Manuel Fangio. In 2015, an investigation was conducted to investigate these claims.
José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, president of the metallurgical company Acindar, who was Minister of Economy between 1976 and 1980, was criminally prosecuted in the case of the kidnapping of the businessmen Federico and Miguel Gutheim, owners of SADECO cotton company.

=== Papel Prensa ===

There was also suspected participation from national media outlets such as Clarin, La Nación and La Razón, the three most important Argentine newspapers at the time. Together they negotiated the buyout of Papel Prensa, the largest national manufacturer of newsprint, then owned by the widow of David Graiver, Lidia Papaleo and his family estate, after his death in a plane crash on August 7, 1976.

Papaleo and the other private partners negotiated the sale of their shares on November 2, 1976. She, along with Graiver&#x27;s brother and father, were illegally detained by the Buenos Aires Province Police on March 14, 1977, on suspected financial connections her late husband had with the guerrilla organization Montoneros, and sentenced to 15 years imprisonment, though an appeals court later cleared the defendants of all charges.

According to Papaleo, the sale was made under duress. She had been receiving death threats and had been told by Papel Prensa&#x27;s president, Pedro Martínez Segovia, who said was representing then Minister of Economy José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz, that she should sell her stake in the company. She, along with her family, attended a night meeting at the &quot;La Nación&quot; offices on November 2. There, she testified, that the representative of Clarín, Hector Magnetto, presented her with a document which said &quot;Sign, or it will cost you your daughter&#x27;s life and your own&quot;.

In September 1978, a group of businessmen, among whom were Ernestina Herrera de Noble and Hector Magnetto from Grupo Clarín and Bartolomé Luis Mitre from La Nación, along with members of the military junta inaugurated the Papel Prensa plant in San Justo.

In 2016, Magnetto, Mitre and Noble were declared innocent. Federal Judge Julián Ercolini ruled that there was not enough evidence of any wrongdoing to accuse them.

== False flag actions by SIDE agents ==
During a 1981 interview whose contents were revealed by declassified CIA documents in 2000, former DINA agent Michael Townley explained that Ignacio Novo Sampol, member of the CORU anti-Castro organization, had agreed to involve the Cuban Nationalist Movement in the kidnapping in Buenos Aires of the president of a Dutch bank. The abduction was organized by civilian SIDE agents to obtain a ransom. Townley said that Novo Sampol had provided $6,000 from the Cuban Nationalist Movement, forwarded to the civilian SIDE agents to pay for the preparation expenses of the kidnapping. After returning to the United States, Novo Sampol sent Townley a stock of paper, used to print pamphlets in the name of &quot;Grupo Rojo&quot; (Red Group), an imaginary Argentine Marxist terrorist organization, which was to claim credit for the abduction of the Dutch banker. Townley declared that the pamphlets were distributed in Mendoza and Córdoba together with false flag bombings perpetrated by SIDE agents. The aim was to establish the existence of the fake Grupo Rojo. However, the SIDE agents procrastinated too much and the kidnapping was never carried out.

== Human rights violations ==
The exact chronology of the repression occurring before the Operation Condor&#x27;s beginning in March 1976 is still debated, but some sectors claim the long political conflict started in 1969 as individual cases of state-sponsored terrorism against Peronism and the left can be traced back to the bombing of Plaza de Mayo and &quot;Revolución Libertadora&quot; in 1955. The Trelew massacre of 1972, the actions of the Argentine Anticommunist Alliance since 1973 and Isabel Martínez de Perón&#x27;s &quot;annihilation decrees&quot; against left-wing guerrillas during &quot;Operativo Independencia&quot; (Operation Independence) in 1975 have also been suggested as dates for the beginning of the Dirty War.

The discontent with Perón in 1973 started due to his drift to the right after having been a popular leftist leader for the first half of the 20th century. Many of the groups that supported him throughout the 1940s and 1950s argued that &quot;Peron was betraying the movement by aligning himself with industrialists foreign interests.&quot; CIA research paper, &quot;Insurgent Success and Failure: Selected Case Studies.&quot; Secret, May 1983 The attacks by the left were met by ruthless action by the government and the Argentina Anticommunist Alliance (AAA), a group known since the 1930s for its violent and brutal stance towards leftist groups.

Targets of the junta were anyone believed to be associated with activist groups, including trade union members and students. These included underage students, like the ones tortured and murdered in the Night of the Pencils, an operation directed by Ramón Camps, General and head of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police from April 1976 to December 1977. The rationale behind attacks against non-combatants was the belief that anyone not sharing government ideology or supporting its actions was a threat; it was believed that &quot;any party that has supported or continues to support the enemy shall be considered a party of the enemy&quot;.

Other junta targets were people who uncovered evidence of government corruption and those thought to hold left-wing views (including French nuns Léonie Duquet and Alice Domon, kidnapped by Alfredo Astiz). Ramón Camps told &quot;Clarín&quot; in 1984 that he had used torture as an interrogation method and orchestrated 5,000 forced disappearances. He had justified the appropriation of newborns from their imprisoned mothers &quot;because subversive parents will raise subversive children&quot;. The individuals who suddenly vanished are called &quot;los desaparecidos&quot;, meaning &quot;the missing ones&quot; or &quot;disappeared&quot;. The people that disappeared throughout the 1970s came from a variety of backgrounds: not just suspected terrorists, but also non-combatants. According to a declassified 1979 document from the U.S. Department of State, fifty-five disappearances were occurring per month, or approximately two per day. Additionally, people who sought to stay &quot;peaceful&quot; during the attacks were targeted by the government, based on the belief that if left alone, they would pose an even greater danger. This was despite the fact that 80 percent of Argentine torture victims had no knowledge of subversive activities.

In December 1976, 22 captured Montoneros responsible for the death of General Cáceres Monié and the attack on the Argentine Army 29th Mountain Infantry Regiment were tortured and executed during the massacre of Margarita Belén in the military Chaco Province, for which Videla would be found guilty of homicide during the 1985 Trial of the Juntas, in addition to the guilty verdicts against Cristino Nicolaides, junta leader Leopoldo Galtieri and Santa Fe Provincial Police chief Wenceslao Ceniquel. The same year, 50 unknown persons were illegally executed by firing squad in Córdoba. Victims&#x27; relatives uncovered evidence that some children taken from their mothers soon after birth were being raised as the adopted children of military servicemembers, as in the case of Silvia Quintela, a member of the Montoneros guerrillas movement. For three decades, the Mothers and Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo, a group founded in 1977, has demanded the return of these kidnapped children, estimated to number as many as 500. In 1979, security forces violently arrested and threatened the members of this group, made up predominantly of mothers who held weekly silent demonstrations in the capital&#x27;s main square for over two years to demand justice for their disappeared children. That same year, over 38 bodies, &quot;many without heads or hands&quot;, were found on Argentina&#x27;s shorelines. Department of State report, &quot;Next Steps in Argentina,&quot; Secret, January 26, 1979

A declassified May 1978 U.S. State Department memorandum asserts that &quot;if there has been a net reduction in reports of torture, this is not because torture has been forsworn but &#x27;derives from fewer operations&#x27; because the number of terrorists and subversives has diminished&quot;. The memorandum adds that disappearances &quot;include not only suspected terrorists but also encompass a broader range of people, for example, labor leaders, workers, clergymen, human rights advocates, scientists, doctors, and political party leaders&quot;. It also describes torture methods used to intimidate and extract information, including electric shocks, prolonged immersion in water, cigarette burns, sexual abuse, rape, removal of teeth and fingernails, castration, and burning with boiling water, oil and acid. Another declassified U.S. State Department memorandum stated that security forces &quot;simply murdered&quot; a couple in their own home without even taking them to a detention center, showing the power the military had in 1976 and beyond.

According to a 2000 Human Rights Review, previous Argentina coups had imposed a strong military presence, the military portraying its struggle as one seeking to preserve Argentine values, which justified their human rights violations. But none had been as violent and brutal as the 1976 coup.

In late 1979, Amnesty International accused the Videla military government of being responsible for the disappearance of 15,000 to 20,000 Argentine citizens since the 1976 coup. The &quot;Registro Unificado de Víctimas del Terrorismo de Estado&quot; (Ruvte) unconvered records of 662 people disappeared under the presidency of Isabel Perón, and another 6,348 disappeared during the military dictatorship.

In 1980, Adolfo Pérez Esquivel, a Catholic human rights activist who had organized the Servicio de Paz y Justicia (Peace and Justice Service) and suffered torture while held without trial for 14 months in a Buenos Aires concentration camp, was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in defense of human rights.

Declassified documents of the Chilean secret police cite an official estimate by the Batallón de Inteligencia 601 of 22,000 killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; between 1975 and mid-1978. During this period, at least 12,000 &quot;disappeared&quot; were detained by PEN (&quot;Poder Ejecutivo Nacional&quot;, anglicized as National Executive Power) and kept in clandestine detention camps throughout Argentina, before eventually being freed under diplomatic pressure. In 2003, the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons recorded the forced disappearance of 8,961 persons from 1976 to 1983, although it noted that the actual number is higher. Military junta members currently in prison for crimes against humanity refused to give Argentine courts the lists of names (and numbers) of kidnapped, tortured, murdered or disappeared people, so the exact number of victims remains uncertain.

Under the Carlos Menem government, Congress passed legislation to provide compensation to victims&#x27; families. Some 11,000 Argentine next of kin have applied to the relevant authorities and received up to US$200,000 each as monetary compensation for the loss of loved ones during the military dictatorship, while others such as the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo refused to take any money from a government they considered to follow the same neoliberal policies dictated by Operation Condor. After a 2017 ruling by the Supreme Court, the National Congress of Argentina excluded convicts of crimes against humanity from the reduced sentences granted to other convicts.

=== Role of the Southern Cone of South America ===
In an unclassified memorandum from the U.S. Department of State written in 1976, it was stated the cooperation efforts there were among Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Brazil, etc. to fight against subversive groups. These efforts ranged from bilateral communications between these countries to capture and monitor these groups; the fight against these &quot;terrorist exponents&quot; proposed to unify the greatest enemies of South America: Brazil and Argentina given that they saw the threat of communism as more dangerous than each other. ARA Monthly Report (July) &quot;The &#x27;Third World War&#x27; and South America&quot; August 3, 1976 An example of this alliance was the deportation of two Montoneros that were to arrive from Mexico in Brazil for a meeting with the leftist group but before the two Montoneros were intercepted in Rio de Janeiro by the Argentine military with permission of the Brazilian military intelligence. Conversation with Argentine Intelligence Source, April 7, 1980

The cooperation between these countries was closely monitored by the United States government given that it has always had interests in maintaining hegemony over this part of the continent. The United States worried that &quot;these regimes threaten[ed] their increasing isolation from the West and the opening of deep ideological divisions among the countries of the hemispheres.&quot; The National Security Archive Even when the United States refused to call the conflict between these South American countries and the subversive groups a &#x27;Third World War&#x27;, according to the Memorandum, it was important for Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay egos, salaries, and their equipment-budgets to believe in this &#x27;Third World War&#x27;. Additionally, the U.S. states its critical goal which is to get the political ideology out of human rights in order to avoid &quot;charges of &#x27;intervention&#x27;&quot; in any of these Latin American countries.

=== United States and violation of human rights in Argentina ===

The interests of the United States in Argentina during the Cold War were rooted in more factors than the threat of the spread of communism in South America than may appear at first sight. Although the subversive groups that were attacking the Argentine government were leftist groups and some Marxist groups, the United States was also interested in the nuclear power that Argentina possessed. According to a U.S. Department of State memorandum, Argentina was part of the &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot;, which was a list of countries that either had the capability of acquiring nuclear weapons but no motivation to do so, or that had the motivation to acquire nuclear weapons but lacked the capability. In the document, it is noted that the biggest security concerns for Argentina were rivals Brazil and Chile, given that these three countries wanted hegemony in Latin America.

In the same realm, the Argentine economy needed to stop depending on fossil fuels and had strong motivation to expand their nuclear program; this could be one of the motivations behind the U.S.&#x27;s lack of action against the human rights violations that were happening in Argentina. In a 1976 declassified memorandum from the U.S. Department of State, it is stated the importance to let President Videla the &quot;adverse effect revelation of the assassination scheme will have on Argentina efforts to obtain loans and otherwise come up with solutions for improving its economy&quot;. In this same document it is stated that &quot;Argentina is the country which [the United States] should be able to exert the most leverage&quot;, which demonstrates the American desire for hegemony in the region, trying to exploit the &#x27;weaknesses&#x27; of the Argentine dictatorship for its own benefit. The United States knew that it had to react to the human rights atrocities happening in Argentine because if it did not then &quot;our singling out of Uruguay, Paraguay, and Chile will appear highly politicized and will serve to fuel the critics who argue that US human rights policy is focused on countries where major US interests are not at stake.&quot;

In 2012 Professor Melisa Slatman published &quot;Actividades extraterritoriales represivas de la Armada Argentina durante la última dictadura civil militar de Seguridad Nacional (1976-1983)&quot; in the Facultad de Humanidades y Ciencias de la Educación (FaHCE) of Universidad Nacional de la Plata where she gives her perspective about the creation of Operation Condor. Slatman argues that this operation was a product of a social construct where there was no empirical evidence other than the desire for repressive states to gain hegemony on the Southern of the hemisphere whether that was by the United States and its perceived fight against communism or by the Southern Cone and their desire of control.

She states that there is no way in which the people can truly know what happens during this operation given that the documents that have been released are merely a reflection of the voices and factors that played a part, but it is only one side of the story. The use of these documents as the only sources that there are about Operation Condor fails to inform experts if it was truly an operation or if it was much more extensive than that more like a system. Furthermore, Slatman argues that these documents present a biased point of view given that the majority of them come from American institutions that seek to present the information that established American hegemony and the unilateral relationships between the U.S. and South American countries.

== Disappeared held under PEN ==
By the time of the coup on 24 March 1976, the number of disappeared held under &quot;Poder Ejecutivo Nacional&quot; (PEN) stood at least 5,182. Some 18,000 disappeared in the form of PEN detainees were imprisoned in Argentina by the end of 1977 and it is estimated that some 3,000 deaths occurred in the Navy Engineering School (ESMA) alone. These disappeared were held incommunicado and reportedly tortured. Some, like senator Hipolito Solari Yrigoyen and socialist leader professor Alfredo Bravo, were &quot;detenidos-desaparecidos&quot;.

By refusing to acknowledge the existence of what was later established to be at least 340 concentration camps throughout the country they also denied the existence of their occupants. The total number of people who were detained for long periods was 8,625. Among them was future President Carlos Menem, who between 1976 and 1981 had been a political prisoner.

Some 8,600 PEN disappeared were eventually released under international pressure. Of these, 4,029 were held in illegal detention centers for less than a year, 2,296 for one to three years, 1,172 for three to five years, 668 for five to seven years and 431 for seven to nine years. Of these, 157 were murdered after being released from detention. In one frank memo, written in 1977, an official at the Foreign Ministry issued the following warning:

Our situation presents certain aspects which are without doubt difficult to defend if they are analyzed from the point of view of international law. These are: the delays incurred before foreign consuls can visit detainees of foreign nationality (contravening article 34 of the Convention of Vienna), the fact that those detained under Executive Power (PEN) are denied the right to legal advice or defense, the complete lack of information of persons detained under PEN, the fact that PEN detainees are not processed for long periods of time, the fact that there are no charges against detainees. The kidnapping and disappearance of people.

=== Children of the disappeared ===
At the time when the CONADEP report was prepared, the &quot;Asociación Abuelas de Plaza de Mayo&quot; (Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo or &quot;Abuelas&quot;), had records of 172 children who disappeared together with their parents or were born at the numerous concentration camps and had not been returned to their families. The Grandmothers of the Plaza de Mayo now believe up to 500 grandchildren were stolen and 102 are believed to have been located. On 13 April 2000, the grandmothers received a tip that the birth certificate of Rosa Roisinblit&#x27;s infant grandson, born in detention, had been falsified and the child given to an Air Force civil agent and his wife. Following the anonymous phone call, he was located and agreed to a DNA blood test, confirming his true identity. Rodolfo Fernando, grandson of Roisinblit, is the first known newborn of missing children returned to his family through the work of the grandmothers. On 6 October 1978, Roisinblit&#x27;s daughter, 25-year-old Patricia Julia Roisinblit de Perez, who was active in the Montoneros, was kidnapped along with her husband, 24-year-old José Martínas Pérez Rojo.

The case of Maria Eugenia Sampallo (born some time in 1978) also received considerable attention as Sampallo sued the couple who adopted her illegally as a baby after her parents disappeared, both Montoneros. Her grandmother spent 24 years looking for her. The case was filed in 2001 after DNA tests indicated that Osvaldo Rivas and Maria Cristina Gomez were not her biological parents. Along with army Captain Enrique Berthier, who furnished the couple with the baby, they were sentenced respectively to 8, 7 and 10 years in prison for kidnapping.

=== Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo ===

The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo is the best-known Argentine human rights organization. For over thirty years, the Mothers have campaigned to find out about the fate of their lost relatives. The Mothers first held their vigil at Plaza de Mayo in 1977, where they continue to gather there every Thursday afternoon. An article of the Madres of the Plaza de Mayo monthly publication caused quite a stir in the mid-1980s, when the Human Rights Group Familiares were quoted as saying: &quot;Familiares assumes the causes of their children&#x27;s fight as their own, vindicates all the disappeared as fighters of the people, [...] [and when occurs] the defeat of imperialism and the sovereignty of the people, we will have achieved our objectives&quot;.

In 1986, the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo split into two groups: Las Madres de Plaza de Mayo – Linea Fundadora (Founding Line) remains focused in recovering the remains of the missing and bringing former police and military commanders to justice. On the other hand, the Asociacion de Madres de Plaza de Mayo (Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo Association) is opposed to the search for and identification of the missing and have also rejected monetary compensation. In April 2004, the former head of the Mothers of Plaza Hebe de Bonafini declared her admiration for her missing children Jorge Omar and Raúl Alfredo for taking up arms as left-wing guerrillas.

To this day, white handkerchiefs are painted on the streets of Argentina, as a reminder of the terroristic actions of the military junta and grief felt by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo.

== Coordination on international criminal operations ==

In 1980, the Argentine military helped Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie, Stefano Delle Chiaie and major drug lords mount the bloody Cocaine Coup of Luis García Meza Tejada in neighboring Bolivia. They hired 70 foreign agents for this task, which was managed in particular by the 601st Intelligence Battalion headed by General Guillermo Suárez Mason. After having been trained by the French military, in the frame of Operation Charly the Argentine Armed Forces would train their counterparts not only in Nicaragua, but also El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala. From 1977 to 1984, after the Falklands War the Argentine Armed Forces exported counter-insurgency tactics, including the systemic use of torture, death squads and disappearances. Special force units, such as &quot;Batallón de Inteligencia 601&quot;, headed in 1979 by Colonel Jorge Alberto Muzzio, trained the Nicaraguan Contras in the 1980s, in particular in Lepaterique base.

Following the release of classified documents and an interview with Duane Clarridge, former CIA responsible for operations with the Contras, the &quot;Clarín&quot; showed that with the election of President Jimmy Carter in 1977 the CIA was blocked from engaging in the special warfare it had previously been engaged in. In conformity with the National Security Doctrine, the Argentine military supported U.S. goals in Latin America while they pressured the United States to be more active in counter-revolutionary activities. In 1981, following the election of Ronald Reagan the CIA took over training of the Contras from Batallón 601. Many Chilean and Uruguayan exiles in Argentina were murdered by Argentine security forces (including high-profile figures such as General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires in 1974, Héctor Gutiérrez Ruiz and Zelmar Michelini in Buenos Aires in 1976). Others, such as Wilson Ferreira Aldunate escaped death.

== United States involvement with the junta ==

Although at least six U.S. citizens had been &quot;disappeared&quot; by the Argentine military by 1976, high-ranking state department officials including then Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had secretly backed up Argentina&#x27;s new military rulers. After leaving the US government, Kissinger congratulated Argentina&#x27;s military junta for combating the left, stating that in his opinion &quot;the government of Argentina had done an outstanding job in wiping out terrorist forces&quot;. The importance of his role was not known about until &quot;The Nation&quot; published in October 1987 an exposé written by Martin Edwin Andersen, a &quot;Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; special correspondent, Kissinger had secretly given the junta a &quot;green light&quot; for their state policies, being the U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA), founded in 1946 assigned the specific goal of teaching anti-communist counterinsurgency training, the place where several Latin American dictators, generations of their military where educated in state terrorism tactics, including the uses of torture in its curriculum. In 2000/2001, the institute was renamed to WHINSEC. According to a &quot;Command and General Foundation News&quot; issue, the current curriculum at WHINSEC is compatible with curriculum taught at U.S. military academies. WHINSEC faculty members travel to Fort Leavenworth in Kansas throughout the year in order to remain up to date on curriculum changes. However, the school remains controversial due to its influence over affairs in Latin America and its education of Latin American state actors on crimes against humanity within the military and law enforcement.

In Buenos Aires, Robert C. Hill, a five-time conservative Republican ambassadorial appointee, worked behind the scenes to keep the Argentina military junta from engaging in massive human rights violations. Upon finding out that Kissinger had given the Argentine generals a &quot;green light&quot; for the state terrorism of the junta in June 1976 while at an Organization of American States meeting in Santiago (at the Hotel Carrera, later made famous as the Hotel Cabrera in the film &quot;Missing&quot;), Hill quietly scrambled to try to roll back the Kissinger decision. Hill did this although Kissinger aides told him that if he continued, Kissinger would likely have him fired. During that meeting with Argentine foreign minister César Augusto Guzzetti, Kissinger assured him that the United States was an ally.

In October 1987, &quot;The Nation&quot; noted: &quot;&#x27;Hill was shaken, he became very disturbed, by the case of the son of a thirty-year embassy employee, a student who was arrested, never to be seen again,&#x27; recalled former &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Juan de Onis. &#x27;Hill took a personal interest.&#x27; He went to the Interior Minister, an army general with whom he had worked on drug cases, saying, &#x27;Hey, what about this? We&#x27;re interested in this case.&#x27; He buttonholed (Foreign Minister Cesar) Guzzetti and, finally, President Jorge R. Videla himself. &#x27;All he got was stonewalling; he got nowhere.&#x27; de Onis said. &#x27;His last year was marked by increasing disillusionment and dismay, and he backed his staff on human rights right to the hilt.&quot; &quot;It sickened me,&quot; said Patricia Derian, the Mississippi civil rights crusader who became President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s State Department point person on human rights, after Hill reported to her Kissinger&#x27;s real role, &quot;that with an imperial wave of his hand, an American could sentence people to death on the basis of a cheap whim. As time went on I saw Kissinger&#x27;s footprints in a lot of countries. It was the repression of a democratic ideal&quot;.

In 1978, former secretary Kissinger was feted by the &quot;dirty war&quot; generals as a much touted guest of honor at the World Cup soccer matches held in Argentina. In a letter to &quot;The Nation&quot; editor Victor Navasky, protesting publication of the 1987 article, Kissinger claimed: &quot;At any rate, the notion of Hill as a passionate human rights advocate is news to all his former associates&quot;. Ironically, Kissinger&#x27;s posthumous lampooning of Hill (who had died in 1978) as human rights advocate was later shown to be false by none other than once and future Kissinger aide Henry Shlaudeman, later ambassador to Buenos Aires, who told William E. Knight, an oral historian working for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training (ADST) Foreign Affairs Oral History Project:

State Department documents obtained in 2003 during the George W. Bush administration by the National Security Archive under the Freedom of Information Act show that in October 1976 Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and other high-ranking U.S. officials gave their full support to the Argentine military junta and urged them to hurry up and finish their actions before the Congress cut military aid. On 5 October 1976, Kissinger met with Argentina&#x27;s Foreign Minister and stated:

The United States was also a key provider of economic and military assistance to the Videla regime during the earliest and most intense phase of the repression. In early April 1976, the Congress approved a request by the Ford administration, written and supported by Henry Kissinger, to grant $50,000,000 in security assistance to the junta. At the end of 1976, Congress granted an additional $30,000,000 in military aid and recommendations by the Ford administration to increase military aid to $63,500,000 the following year were also considered by Congress. U.S. assistance, training and military sales to the Videla regime continued under the successive Carter administration up until at least 30 September 1978 when military aid was officially called to a stop within section 502B of the Foreign Assistance Act.

In 1977 and 1978, the United States sold more than $120,000,000 in military spare parts to Argentina and in 1977 the Department of Defense was granted $700,000 to train 217 Argentine military officers. By the time the International Military Education and Training (IMET) program was suspended to Argentina in 1978, total U.S. training costs for Argentine military personnel since 1976 totalled $1,115,000. The Reagan administration, whose first term began in 1981, asserted that the previous Carter administration had weakened U.S. diplomatic relationships with Cold War allies in Argentina and reversed the previous administration&#x27;s official condemnation of the junta&#x27;s human rights practices. The re-establishment of diplomatic ties allowed for CIA collaboration with the Argentine intelligence service in training and arming the Nicaraguan Contras against the Sandinista government. The 601 Intelligence Battalion, for example, trained Contras at Lepaterique base in Honduras.

U.S. corporations such as Ford Motor Company and Citibank also collaborated with the junta in the repression and disappearance of workers active in unions.

== French connection ==
Investigating French military influence in Argentina, French journalist Marie-Monique Robin found in 2003 the original document proving that a 1959 agreement between Paris and Buenos Aires initiated a &quot;permanent French military mission&quot; in Argentina and reported on it (she found the document in the archives of the &quot;Quai d&#x27;Orsay&quot;, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs). The mission was formed of veterans who had fought in the Algerian War and it was assigned to the offices of the chief of staff of the Argentine Armed Forces. It was continued until 1981, date of the election of socialist François Mitterrand.

After release of her documentary film &quot;Escadrons de la mort, l&#x27;école française&quot; in 2003 which explored the French connection with South American nations, Robin said in an interview with &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot; newspaper: &quot;French have systematized a military technique in urban environment which would be copied and pasted to Latin American dictatorships&quot;. She noted that the French military had systematized the methods they used to suppress the insurgency during the 1957 Battle of Algiers and exported them to the War School in Buenos Aires. Roger Trinquier&#x27;s famous book on counter-insurgency had a very strong influence in South America. In addition, Robin said she was shocked to learn that the DST French intelligence agency gave DINA the names of refugees who returned to Chile (Operation Retorno) from France during their counterinsurgency. All of these Chileans have been killed: &quot;Of course, this puts in cause [&quot;sic&quot; – this makes responsible] the French government, and Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, then President of the Republic. I was very shocked by the duplicity of the French diplomatic position which, on one hand, received with open arms the political refugees, and, on the other hand, collaborated with the dictatorships&quot;.

On 10 September 2003, Green members of parliament Noël Mamère, Martine Billard and Yves Cochet filed a request to form a Parliamentary Commission to examine the &quot;role of France in the support of military regimes in Latin America from 1973 to 1984&quot; before the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly, presided by Edouard Balladur (UMP). Apart from &quot;Le Monde,&quot; French newspapers did not report this request. UMP deputy Roland Blum, in charge of the commission, refused to let Marie-Monique Robin testify on this topic. The Commission in December 2003 published a 12-page report claiming that the French had never signed a military agreement with Argentina.

When Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin travelled to Chile in February 2003, he claimed that no co-operation between France and the military regimes had occurred. People in Argentina were outraged when they saw the 2003 film, which included three generals defending their actions during the Dirty War. Due to public pressure, President Néstor Kirchner ordered the military to bring charges against the three for justifying the crimes of the dictatorship. They were Albano Hargindeguy, Reynaldo Bignone and Ramón Genaro Díaz Bessone.

The next year, Robin published her book under the same title &quot;Escadrons de la mort: l&#x27;école française&quot; (&quot;Death Squads: The French School&quot;, 2004), revealing more material. She showed how Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing&#x27;s government secretly collaborated with Videla&#x27;s junta in Argentina and with Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s regime in Chile. Alcides Lopez Aufranc was among the first Argentine officers to go in 1957 to Paris to study for two years at the Ecole de Guerre military school, two years before the Cuban Revolution and when no Argentine guerrillas existed:

In practice, declared Robin to &quot;Página/12&quot;, the arrival of the French in Argentina led to a massive extension of intelligence services and of the use of torture as the primary weapon of the anti-subversive war in the concept of modern warfare.

The annihilation decrees signed by Isabel Perón had been inspired by French texts. During the Battle of Algiers, the police forces were put under the authority of the Army. 30,000 persons were &quot;disappeared&quot;. In Algeria. Reynaldo Bignone, named President of the Argentine junta in July 1982, said in Robin&#x27;s film: &quot;The March 1976 order of battle is a copy of the Algerian battle&quot;. The same statements were made by Generals Albano Harguindeguy, Videla&#x27;s Interior Minister; and Diaz Bessone, former Minister of Planification and ideologue of the junta. The French military would transmit to their Argentine counterparts the notion of an &quot;internal enemy&quot; and the use of torture, death squads and &quot;quadrillages&quot; (grids).

Marie-Monique Robin also demonstrated that since the 1930s, there had been ties between the French far-right and Argentina, in particular through the Catholic fundamentalist organisation &quot;Cité catholique&quot;, created by Jean Ousset, a former secretary of Charles Maurras, the founder of the royalist &quot;Action Française&quot; movement. &quot;La Cité&quot; edited a review, &quot;Le Verbe&quot;, which influenced militaries during the Algerian War, notably by justifying the use of torture. At the end of the 1950s, the &quot;Cité catholique&quot; founded groups in Argentina and organised cells in the Army. It greatly expanded during the government of General Juan Carlos Onganía, in particular in 1969. The key figure of the &quot;Cité catholique&quot; in Argentina was priest Georges Grasset, who became Videla&#x27;s personal confessor. He had been the spiritual guide of the Organisation armée secrète (OAS), the pro-French Algeria terrorist movement founded in Franquist Spain.

Robin believes that this Catholic fundamentalist current in the Argentine Army contributed to the importance and length of the French-Argentine co-operation. In Buenos Aires, Georges Grasset maintained links with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of Society of St. Pius X in 1970, who was excommunicated in 1988. The Society of Pius-X has four monasteries in Argentina, the largest one in La Reja. A French priest from there said to Marie-Monique Robin: &quot;To save the soul of a Communist priest, one must kill him.&quot; Luis Roldan, former Secretary of Cult under Carlos Menem, President of Argentina from 1989 to 1999, was presented by Dominique Lagneau, the priest in charge of the monastery, to Robin as &quot;Mr. Cité catholique in Argentina&quot;. Bruno Genta and Juan Carlos Goyeneche represent this ideology.

Antonio Caggiano, archbishop of Buenos Aires from 1959 to 1975, wrote a prologue to Jean Ousset&#x27;s 1961 Spanish version of &quot;Le Marxisme-léninisme&quot;. Caggiano said that &quot;Marxism is the negation of Christ and his Church&quot; and referred to a Marxist conspiracy to take over the world, for which it was necessary to &quot;prepare for the decisive battle&quot;.

Argentine Admiral Luis María Mendía, who had started the practice of &quot;death flights&quot;, testified in January 2007 before Argentine judges, that a French intelligence agent, Bertrand de Perseval, had participated in the abduction of the two French nuns, Léonie Duquet and Alice Domont. Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, denied any links with the abduction. He has admitted being a former member of the OAS and having escaped from Algeria after the March 1962 Évian Accords put an end to the Algerian War (1954–1962).

During the 2007 hearings, Luis María Mendía referred to material presented in Robin&#x27;s documentary, titled &quot;The Death Squads – the French School&quot; (2003). He asked the Argentine Court to call numerous French officials to testify to their actions: former French President Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, former French Premier Pierre Messmer, former French ambassador to Buenos Aires Françoise de la Gosse, and all officials in place in the French embassy in Buenos Aires between 1976 and 1983. Besides this &quot;French connection&quot;, María Mendía also charged former head of state Isabel Perón and former ministers Carlos Ruckauf and Antonio Cafiero, who had signed the &quot;anti-subversion decrees&quot; before Videla&#x27;s 1976 coup. According to Graciela Dalo, a survivor of the ESMA interrogations, Mendía was trying to establish that these crimes were legitimate, as the 1987 &quot;Obediencia Debida&quot; Act claimed them to be and further that the ESMA actions had been committed under Isabel Perón&#x27;s &quot;anti-subversion decrees&quot; (which would give them a formal appearance of legality, although torture is forbidden by the Argentine Constitution). Alfredo Astiz also referred to the &quot;French connexion&quot; when testifying in court.

== Truth commission and decrees revoked ==
The junta relinquished power in 1983. After democratic elections, President elect Raúl Alfonsín created the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) in December 1983, led by writer Ernesto Sábato, to collect evidence of Dirty War crimes. The gruesome details, including documentation of the disappearance of nearly 9,000 people identified by name, shocked the world. Jorge Rafael Videla, head of the junta, was among the generals convicted of human rights crimes, including forced disappearances, torture, murders and kidnappings. President Alfonsín ordered that the nine members of the military junta be judicially charged during the 1985 Trial of the Juntas. , most of the military officials were in trial or jail. In 1985, Videla was sentenced to life imprisonment at the military prison of Magdalena. Several senior officers also received jail terms. In the Prologue to the &quot;Nunca Más&quot; report (&quot;Never Again&quot;), Ernesto Sábato wrote:

From the moment of their abduction, the victims lost all rights. Deprived of all communication with the outside world, held in unknown places, subjected to barbaric torture, kept ignorant of their immediate or ultimate fate, they risked being either thrown into a river or the sea, weighted down with blocks of cement, or burned to ashes. They were not mere objects, however, and still possessed all the human attributes: they could feel pain, could remember a mother, child or spouse, could feel infinite shame at being raped in public.

Reacting to the human rights trials, hardliners in the Argentine army staged a series of uprisings against the Alfonsín government. They barricaded themselves in several military barracks, demanding an end to the trials. During Holy Week (&quot;Semana Santa&quot;) in April 1987, Lieutenant Colonel Aldo Rico (commander of the 18th Infantry Regiment in Misiones province) and several junior army officers barricaded themselves in the Campo de Mayo army barracks. The military rebels, called the carapintadas, demanded an end to the trials and the resignation of army chief of staff General Héctor Ríos Ereñú. Rico believed that the Alfonsin government would be unwilling or unable to put down the uprising. He was partially correct in that the Second Army Corps commander&#x27;s orders to surround the barracks were ignored by his subordinates. Alfonsin called on the people to come to the Plaza de Mayo to defend democracy; hundreds of thousands answered his call.

After a helicopter visit by Alfonsin to Campo de Mayo, the rebels finally surrendered. There were denials of a deal, but several generals were forced into early retirement and General Jose Dante Caridi soon replaced Erenu as commander of the army. In January 1988, a second military rebellion took place when Rico refused to accept the detention orders issued by a military court for having led the previous uprising. This time he barricaded himself in the 4th Infantry Regiment in Monte Caseros and rejected Caridi&#x27;s calls to turn himself in. Rico again demanded an end to the human rights trials, saying Alfonsin&#x27;s promises to the rebels had not been fulfilled. Caridi ordered several army units to suppress the rebellion. Their advance to the Monte Caseros barracks was slowed by rain and reports that rebel soldiers had laid mines which had wounded three loyal officers. Nevertheless, Rico&#x27;s forces were defeated after a three-hour battle. They surrendered on 17 January 1988, and 300 rebels were arrested and sentenced to prison terms.

A third uprising took place in December 1988. This time the uprising was led by Lieutenant-Colonel Mohammed Alí Seineldín and supported by 1,000 rebel troops. This uprising proved successful. Several of Seineldín&#x27;s and his followers&#x27; demands were agreed to. Caridi was forced into retirement and replaced by General Francisco Gassino, who had served in the Falklands War and was held in high esteem by the carapintadas. On 5 October 1989, as part of sweeping reforms, newly elected President Carlos Menem pardoned those convicted in the human right trials and the rebel leaders imprisoned for taking part in the military uprisings.
Foreign governments whose citizens were victims of the Dirty War (which included citizens of Czechoslovakia, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Spain, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom, Paraguay, Bolivia, Chile, Uruguay, Peru and several other nations) are pressing individual cases against the former military regime. France has sought the extradition of Captain Alfredo Astiz for the kidnapping and murder of its nationals, among them nuns Léonie Duquet and Alice Domon.

== Continuing controversies ==
On 23 January 1989, an armed group of around 40 guerrillas, a faction of the &quot;Movimiento Todos por la Patria&quot; (MTP or All for the Fatherland Movement), attacked the La Tablada army barracks on the outskirts of Buenos Aires to &quot;prevent&quot; a military coup. The attack resulted in 28 of the guerrillas killed, five &quot;disappeared&quot; and 13 imprisoned. Eleven police and military died, and 53 were wounded in the fighting. The guerrillas claimed to have acted to prevent a military coup. Among the dead at La Tablada was Jorge Baños, a human rights lawyer who had joined the guerrillas. The MTP attack to prevent a military coup has been suspected to be led by infiltrated Intelligence military service.

In 2002, Máxima, daughter of Jorge Zorreguieta, a civilian cabinet minister of Argentina during the early phase of the Dictatorship, married Willem-Alexander, crown prince of the Netherlands. All of the Netherlands had wrestled in controversy over her suitability, but ultimately the marriage took place without the presence of her parents. Máxima thus became Queen when her husband ascended to the throne in 2013. In August 2016, Argentine President Mauricio Macri was widely condemned by human rights group for calling into question the number of 30,000 disappeared and for referring to the period as a &quot;Dirty War&quot;.

During the Argentine Bicentennial Independence Celebrations (on 9 July 2016), former Colonel Carlos Carrizo Salvadores drew criticism from the left for leading the march of Falklands War veterans and Veterans of Operation Independence, the counterinsurgency campaign in Northern Argentina. Carrizo Salvadores had been sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013 for his part as a paratrooper captain in the so-called Rosario Chapel massacre in Catamarca Province but was acquitted under the new government of Mauricio Macri.

In 2016, a group of Argentinian-Israelis origin filed a freedom of information request to demand the Israeli government release all documents on military and diplomatic ties between Israel and the junta since it is believed that Israel supported the military dictatorship.

On 16 November 2023, it was revealed that Luis Kyburg, a former Argentinean naval officer who was believed to have killed at least 150 people during the Dirty War, died in Berlin. He had been living in Berlin since 2013 and his death, which was revealed to have happened in October, came three weeks before he was scheduled to face trial for 23 of the murders he was accused of committed during the Dirty War.

== Repeal of Pardon Laws and renewal of prosecutions ==
Under Néstor Kirchner&#x27;s term as president in 2003, the Argentine Congress revoked the longstanding amnesty laws, also called the Pardon Laws. In 2005, the Argentine Supreme Court ruled these laws were unconstitutional. The government re-opened prosecution of war crimes. From then through October 2011, 259 persons were convicted for crimes against humanity and genocide and sentenced in Argentine courts, including Alfredo Astiz, a notorious torturer, that month.

In 2006, 24 March was designated as a public holiday in Argentina, the Day of Remembrance for Truth and Justice. That year on the 30th anniversary of the coup, a huge crowd filled the streets to remember what happened during the military government and ensure it did not happen again.

In 2006, the government began its first trials of military and security officers since the repeal of the &quot;Pardon Laws&quot;. Miguel Etchecolatz, the police commissioner of the province of Buenos Aires in the 1970s, faced trial on charges of illegal detention, torture and homicide. He was found guilty of six counts of murder, six counts of unlawful imprisonment and seven counts of torture and sentenced in September 2006 to life imprisonment.

In February 2006, some former Ford Argentine workers sued the U.S.-based company, alleging that local managers worked with the security forces to detain union members on the premises and torture them. The civil suit against Ford Motor Company and Ford Argentina called for four former company executives and a retired military officer to be questioned. According to Pedro Norberto Troiani, one of the plaintiffs, 25 employees were detained in the plant, located from Buenos Aires. Allegations have surfaced since 1998 that Ford officials were involved in state repression, but the company has denied the claims. Army personnel were reported to have arrived at the plant on the day of the military coup on 24 March 1976 and &quot;disappearances&quot; immediately started.

On 14 December 2007, some 200 men who were at military service during the dictatorship demanded an audience with the governor of Tucumán Province, claiming they too were victims of the Junta as they had no choice and suffered hunger, abandonment, physical and psychological injuries, demanding a military pension.

In February 2010, a German court issued an international arrest warrant for former dictator Jorge Videla in connection with the death of 20-year-old Rolf Stawowiok in Argentina. He was a German citizen born in Argentina while his father was doing development work there. Rolf Stawowiok disappeared on 21 February 1978. In earlier cases, France, Italy and Spain had requested extradition of the Navy captain Alfredo Astiz for war crimes related to his work with ESMA but were never successful.
In 1977, General Albano Harguindeguy, Interior Minister, admitted that 5,618 people disappeared in the form of PEN detenidos-desaparecidos were being held in detention camps throughout Argentina. According to a secret cable from DINA (Chilean secret police) in Buenos Aires, an estimate by the Argentine 601st Intelligence Battalion in mid-July 1978, which started counting victims in 1975, gave the figure of 22,000 persons – this document was first published by John Dinges in 2004.

== Participation of Catholic Church members ==
On 15 April 2005, a human rights lawyer filed a criminal complaint against Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio (now Pope Francis), accusing him of conspiring with the junta in 1976 to kidnap two Jesuit priests. So far, no hard evidence has been presented linking the cardinal to this crime. It is known that the cardinal headed the Society of Jesus of Argentina in 1976 and had asked the two priests to leave their pastoral work following conflict within the Society over how to respond to the new military dictatorship, with some priests advocating a violent overthrow. The cardinal&#x27;s spokesman flatly denied the allegations.

It has since been revealed that Cardinal Bergoglio made efforts behind the scenes to save and evacuate suspected dissidents who face persecution by the Argentine military Junta when he was the head of the Jesuits It is estimated that during his time as the head of the Jesuits Bergoglio saved the lives of over 1000 dissidents The Mothers of the Plaza De Mayo, initially harsh critics of Bergoglio, would end up reconciling with him when he became Pope, with Hebe Bonafini their leader saying he is &quot;with the people&quot;

A priest, Christian von Wernich, was chaplain of the Buenos Aires Provincial Police while it was under the command of General Ramón Camps during the dictatorship, with the rank of inspector. On 9 October 2007, he was found guilty of complicity in 7 homicides, 42 kidnappings and 32 instances of torture and sentenced to life imprisonment.

Some Catholic priests sympathised with and helped the Montoneros. Radical priests, including Father Alberto Carbone, who was eventually indicted in the murder of Aramburu, preached Marxism and presented the early Church fathers as model revolutionaries in an attempt to legitimise the violence. A Catholic youth leader, Juan Ignacio Isla Casares, with the help of the Montoneros commander Eduardo Pereira Rossi (nom de guerre &quot;El Carlón&quot;) was the mastermind behind the ambush and killing of five policemen near San Isidro Cathedral on 26 October 1975.

Mario Firmenich, who later became the leader of the Montoneros, was the ex-president of the Catholic Action Youth Group and a former seminarian himself. The Montoneros had ties with the Movement of Priests for the Third World and a Jesuit priest, Carlos Mugica.

== &quot;The United States Declassification Project on Argentina&quot; ==
According to its front page, &quot;The United States Declassification Project on Argentina&quot; &quot;represents a historic effort by United States government departments and agencies to identify, review, and provide public access to records that shed light on human rights abuses in Argentina between 1975 and 1984&quot;. The project was announced by President Barack Obama in 2016 after a request from Argentine President Mauricio Macri and human rights groups on the 40th anniversary of the 1976 military coup in Argentina. The documents were released in three tranches, in August 2016, December 2016 and April 2019. Gastón Chillier, of the Cels human rights group said &quot;There are documents from six or seven different US intelligence agencies. We&#x27;re hopeful there may be information there that could help in the continuing trials against human rights offenders from the period&quot;. Contained within the documents are descriptions of the methods used by the Argentine dictatorship to kill its victims and dispose of their bodies. In addition, during his 2016 visit to Argentina, President Obama said that the United States &quot;was too slow&quot; to condemn human rights atrocities during the military junta years but stopped short of apologizing for Washington&#x27;s early support for the military government.

<doc id="344070" wikidata="Q336087" url="?curid=344070" title="Arame of Urartu">
<text>Arame or Aramu () was the first known king of Urartu.

Living at the time of King Shalmaneser III of Assyria (), Arame fought against the threat of the Assyrian Empire. His capital at Arzashkun was captured by Shalmaneser. Sagunia, a previous capital, which was also captured by Shalamaneser, seems to have been located in the vicinity of Lake Van or Lake Urmia. Subsequent Urartian rulers probably came from a different dynasty than Arame.

Arame has been suggested as the prototype of both Aram (and, correspondingly the popular given name Aram) and Ara the Beautiful, two of the legendary forefathers of the Armenian people. Khorenatsi&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; (1.5) puts them six and seven generations after Hayk.

It has been hypothesized that Aramu was a military leader of Aramean origin. Philologist Armen Petrosyan writes that Aramu may be identified with the legendary Armenian Aram, and proposes that Aramu may have been named after the Armenian or related deity *&quot;Aram-.&quot; Petrosyan further writes, &quot;Bearing in mind the Armenian etymologies of the names of the first king of Urartu Aramu and one of his royal cities Arṣašku, one may conclude that the first king of Urartu was an Armenian ruler and the Armenians inhabited Arṣašku.&quot;

He is not to be confused with another king Aramu (also known as Adramu and Atarsamek) who ruled at the same time in Bit Agusi and also fought Shalemaneser III.

<doc id="344071" wikidata="Q13083721" url="?curid=344071" title="Kim (Korean surname)">
<text>Kim () is the most common surname in Korea. As of the 2015 South Korean census, there were 10,689,959 people by this name in South Korea or 21.5% of the population. Although the surname is always pronounced the same, dozens of different family clans () use it. The clan system in Korea is unique from the surname systems of other countries. Kim is written as () in both North and South Korea. The hanja for Kim, , can also be transliterated as () which means &#x27;gold, metal, iron&#x27;. While romanized as Kim by 99.3% of the population, other rare variant romanizations such as Gim, Ghim, and Kin make up the remaining 0.7%.

==Origin==
The first historical document that records the surname dates to 636 and references it as the surname of Korean King Jinheung of Silla (526–576). In the Silla kingdom (57 BCE935 CE)—which variously battled and allied with other states on the Korean peninsula and ultimately unified most of the country in 668—Kim was the name of a family that rose to prominence and became the rulers of Silla for 586 years. Many scholars have suggested that Kim Al-chi (Alti) may have been the chief of a &quot;gold&quot; () clan of Korea and Manchuria, whose story is similar to the legend of Alji Geo-seo-khan.

==Clans==
As with other Korean surnames, different clans, known as , are inherited from a father to his children. These designate the region of Korea or paternal ancestor from which they claim to originate.

The 2000 South Korean census listed 348 extant Kim lineages.

===Major clans===
====Uiseong====
The Uiseong Kim () clan traces its lineage back to Kim Seok, also known as Kim Jung-seok, the son of Gyeongsun of Silla.

====Andong====

The Andong Kim clan () consists of two separate clans, distinguished as Gu () and Shin (), that have two separate progenitors.

Some notable Gu Andong Kim clan members were General Kim Si-min and Prime Minister Kim Sa-hyeong, who was involved with the Gangnido map, as well as Royal Noble Consort Hwi who was banished for witchcraft.

The Shin Andong Kim clan was one of the powerful clans that dominated the later part of Joseon. One of the most powerful members from the clan was Kim Jo-sun, who was the father-in-law to Sunjo of Joseon. Kim Josun&#x27;s daughter was Queen Sunwon.

====Gimhae (Kimhae)====
The origin of the clan traces back to Suro of Geumgwan Gaya and his ten children, who started the Kim dynasty of Geumgwan Gaya, the capital of which was in present-day Gimhae. Famous ancient members of this clan, aside from the kings of Geumgwan Gaya, include the Silla general Kim Yu-sin. In Later Silla, members of the Gimhae Kim family were admitted to all but the highest level of the Silla bone rank system.

This clan is by far the most populous of all Korean clans. According to the 2015 South Korean census, there were 4,456,700 Gimhae Kim clan members in South Korea.

====Gyeongju====
The Gyeongju Kims () trace their descent from the ruling family of Silla. The founder of this clan is said to have been Kim Al-chi, an orphan adopted by King Talhae of Silla in the 1st century CE. Alji&#x27;s seventh-generation descendant was the first member of the clan to take the throne, as King Michu of Silla in the year 262. According to the South Korean census of 2015, there were 1,800,853 Gyeongju Kims in South Korea.

====Nagan====
The Nagan Kim clan () is small. Its progenitor, Kim Sujing (), was a descendant of the last king of Silla and established their ancestral home in Suncheon. In the South Korean census of 2000, less than 10,000 citizens claimed to be Nagan Kims.

====Hamchang====
The Hamchang Kim clan () trace their origin to the founder of the little-known Gaya confederacy state of Goryeong Gaya, King Taejo. His alleged tomb, rediscovered in the sixteenth century, is still preserved by the modern-day members of the clan. This clan numbered only 26,300 members in the 2000 South Korean census.

====Gwangsan====

The Gwangsan Kim clan () was one of the most prominent clans during Joseon. The Gwangsan Kims are the descendants of Kim Heung-gwang (김흥광, 金興光), who was the third prince of Sinmu of Silla, its 45th monarch.

====Yaseong====
The Yaseong Kim clan () is from Yeongdeok County. The name Yeongdeok replaced an earlier name, Yaseong, which means &#x27;city in the wilderness&#x27;, and dates its origins back to Silla.

====Cheongpung====
The Cheongpung Kim clan () was one of the aristocratic families during the Joseon. Two queens were from this clan during that period. Several members of the clan also became prime ministers.

====Yonan====

The Yonan Kim clan was an aristocratic family clan that had members in high government positions during the Joseon era. Six members of the clan were prime ministers. The founder of the Yonan Kim clan was Kim Sŏm-han (), a descendant of Kim Al-chi.

====Gangneung====

The Gangneung Kim clan () originated from Gangneung in Gangwon Province. The progenitor was Kim Chu-wŏn, who was a descendant of Muyeol of Silla.

====Sangsan====
The Sangsan Kim clan () originated from Sangju in North Gyeongsang Province. The progenitor was Kim Su () and the clan had members that participated in the Joseon government.

====Ulsan====
The Ulsan Kim clan () originated from Ulsan in Yeongnam. One of the members of this clan, Kim Inhu, was one of the 18 Sages of Korea and honored as a Munmyo Bae-hyang ().

====Seoheung====
The Seoheung Kim clan () was one of the smaller Kim clans during the Joseon. The progenitor was Kim Bo () and one of the members was Kim Gwoeng-pil (), who was one of the 18 Sages of Korea and honored as Munmyo Bae-hyang ().

====Wonju====
The Wonju Kim clan () might be one of the smallest Kim clans during the Joseon. They had two members that became prime ministers during that period.

====Jeonju====

According to the South Korean census of 2015, there were 56,989 members of the Jeonju Kim clan in South Korea. Its progenitor, Kim T&#x27;ae-sŏ, was descended from the last king of Silla, Gyeongsun of Silla. South Korean artist Kim Hee-chul is from the Jeonju clan, as are the North Korean leaders Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il, and Kim Jong Un.

<text>Woolen (American English) or woollen (Commonwealth English) is a type of yarn made from carded wool. Woolen yarn is soft, light, stretchy, and full of air. It is thus a good insulator, and makes a good knitting yarn. Woolen yarn is in contrast to worsted yarn, in which the fibers are combed to lie parallel rather than carded, producing a hard, strong yarn.

==Commercial manufacture==

The woolen and worsted process both require that the wool (and other similar animal fibres, cashmere, camel, etc.) be cleaned before mechanical processing. Woolen and worsted nomenclatures apply only to the textile processing of animal fibres, but it has become common to include fibre blends under these terms.

The resultant fabrics will be classified as being either woolen or worsted, but this designation is assigned during fiber processing and yarn formation, not in the cloth or finished garment.

A woven woolen fabric is one which is subjected to fabric finishing techniques designed to add a directional pile — in that the end consumer can &#x27;stroke&#x27; the garment in a single direction (shoulder to cuff etc.), such as a casual jacket. This feels like the fibers are directionally arranged.

Woolen yarn formation is also very common for knitwear, where the resultant garment has some bulk and the requirement for visual aesthetics (of fibre alignment) is minimal.

The worsted processing route is more complex and requires the removal of short fibres and the use of a focused mechanical process to make the individual fibres parallel to each other. The yarn formation process is significantly more comprehensive and results in a very sleek yarn which will offer a clean looking woven fabric, such as for . The worsted process is more expensive and is seldom used for knitwear.

==Handspinning woolen yarn==

Woolen yarn is handspun using the long draw technique, and the yarn is spun from a rolag. Most handspinners make a blend of a woolen and worsted yarn, using techniques from both categories, and thus ending up with a mix. The first step to spin a true woolen yarn, however, is to card the fiber into a rolag using handcarders.

The rolag is spun without much stretching of the fibers from the cylindrical configuration. This is done by allowing twist into a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back, without letting the rolag change position in your hands, until the yarn is the desired thickness. The twist will concentrate in the thinnest part of the roving, thus when the yarn is pulled, the thicker sections with less twist will tend to thin out. Once the yarn is the desired thickness, enough twist is added to make the yarn strong. Then the yarn is wound onto the bobbin, and the process starts again.

<doc id="344077" wikidata="Q2241899" url="?curid=344077" title="Battersea Park railway station">
<text>Battersea Park is a suburban railway station in the London Borough of Wandsworth, south London. It is at the junction of the South London line and the Brighton Main Line (although the physical connection between the lines has been removed), measured from . It is close to Battersea Park, and not far from Battersea Power Station.

The station has an out-of-station interchange with Battersea Power Station tube station on the newly opened Northern line extension to Battersea, part of the London Underground. It is also a short walking distance from Queenstown Road station. Additionally, Battersea Park receives a limited service on the Windrush line of the London Overground, with a small number of early morning and late evening services terminating here instead of at Clapham Junction.

==Description==
The station has a polychrome brick Venetian Gothic facade. It is a Grade 2 listed building designed by Charles Henry Driver.

Access to the five platforms is via steep wooden staircases. Most services at the station call at Platforms 3 and 4, on the slow lines into Victoria. Platform 1 (the former down South London line platform) is made completely from wood and ceased to be used from December 2012, and the tracks have since been lifted. Platform 2 (the former up South London line platform) is used by the limited London Overground services that serve the station; it is now a terminal platform since the adjacent Platform 3 was extended over the former junction between the South London and main lines in 2014. Platform 5, on the down fast line from Victoria, is rarely used, usually during engineering works or congestion problems in London Victoria with services passing towards Clapham Junction. London Overground has a daily service to Dalston Junction.

The station is within short walking distance of Battersea Power Station Underground station, an extension of the Northern line to Battersea Power Station which opened in September 2021. The two stations serve as an out of station interchange.

==History==

The first station to carry the name &quot;Battersea Park&quot; was opened by the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) as &quot;Battersea&quot; on 1 October 1860 and was located at the southern end of what is now Grosvenor Bridge. It was named &quot;Battersea Park&quot; on 1 July 1862 but was sometimes called &quot;Battersea Park and Steamboat Pier&quot;. It closed on 1 November 1870 concurrently with the opening of Grosvenor Road station situated at the north end of Grosvenor Bridge.
The LB&amp;SCR opened a high-level line between Pouparts Junction and Battersea Pier Junction on 1 May 1867 as a means of reducing congestion at Stewarts Lane. York Road (Battersea) station opened at this time.
The station was renamed Battersea Park and York Road 1 January 1877 and Battersea Park on 1 June 1885.

The South London line through the station to London Bridge was electrified on 1 December 1909 &#x27;Elevated Electric&#x27; overhead system. and to Crystal Palace on 12 May 1911, on the LB&amp;SCR &#x27;Elevated Electric&#x27; overhead system.

At the end of August 2009, electronic ticket gates were installed. There was some staffing provision but the station has been fully staffed from first to last train as part of the Southern franchise from September 2009.

With the redevelopment of Battersea Power Station into &quot;The Power Station London&quot;, the station is due a complete refurbishment.

==Services==

Most services at Battersea Park are operated by Southern using EMUs.

The typical off peak service in trains per hour is:
* 6 tph to 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via 

Additional services towards Sutton via Norbury call at the station twice per hour during the peak hours.

The station is also served by a very limited service on the Windrush line of the London Overground, consisting of two trains per day to and one train per day from via , operated using EMUs. London Overground can also use Battersea Park if for whatever reason they are unable to serve Clapham Junction.

==Accidents==
===1881 crash===
On 24 December 1881, a train hauled by LBSC Terrier No.70 &quot;Poplar&quot; collided with the rear of the 11:35pm from London Bridge owing to a fogman&#x27;s error.

===1937 crash===

On 2 April 1937, two electric passenger trains collided just south of the station; ten people were killed and 17 seriously injured. The signalman at Battersea Park, believing there to be a fault with his equipment, overrode the electrical interlocking and allowed the second train into the occupied section.

===1985 crash===
On 31 May 1985, 1D91 09:20 Gatwick Airport to Victoria Gatwick express formed of GLV, 8301, 8203, 8313, 73117 collided with 2L51 08:51 East Grinstead to Victoria formed of DEMU 1113 and 1309 travelling along the up fast main line from Clapham Junction. Train 1D91 was following 2L51 along the Up Fast line, through Clapham Junction station, at which the latter train had made a scheduled stop and beyond towards Battersea Park. 1D91 had closed sufficiently on 2L51 that the former passed a series of signals displaying a &#x27;single yellow&#x27; caution aspect, at which the driver cancelled the AWS warning and continued, as he was entitled to, at a speed of around . Train 2L51 was then stopped for 1–2 minutes at signal VC552 displaying a red aspect. When that signal cleared, 2L51 was accelerating past it when it was struck from behind by 1D91 which had passed the protecting signal, VC564, at Danger.

A consensus of evidence suggests that at the moment of collision 2L51 had reached a speed of between , whilst 1D91 was still travelling at between , so that the net collision speed was about . After the collision the trains separated and came to rest apart. There was no derailment but the shock of collision passing down each train caused damage throughout the length of both. Only one vehicle sustained severe structural damage; this was the leading passenger coach of 1D91, running immediately behind the GLV. This coach sustained a small degree of telescoping at underframe level, and hinging down of its trailing end, so that the saloon floor buckled upwards by about with consequent displacement of seats in one bay. One window each side was broken when this deformation occurred through the window opening, but the general integrity of the vehicles could be judged by the fact that these were the only external windows broken throughout the two trains.

The trains were conveying a large number of passengers, one estimate being as high as 800. In the collision 104 persons suffered injury and were taken to two hospitals by means of ten ambulances, the first of which arrived at 09:58. Most of the injured suffered only cuts and bruises and were discharged after treatment, but eighteen had serious injuries requiring detention in hospital for periods between one and fourteen nights. Twenty other passengers later reported having suffered injury. The uninjured passengers were conveyed forward to Victoria at 10:58 by a special train, the unobstructed Slow lines having been re-energised for electric trains at 10:45 after an initial complete isolation of the conductor rails in the area. During the day the damaged trains were made fit to move and hauled into sidings so that, there being no damage to the track or signalling equipment, normal working was resumed at 16:12.

==Motive power depots==
The West End of London and Crystal Palace Railway opened an engine shed off what is now Prince of Wales Drive on 29 March 1858. It closed in 1877.

The London Brighton and South Coast Railway built a roundhouse a few yards north of the station on the lower level in 1869, extended with a second adjoining roundhouse in 1870 and a third in 1889. It closed 15 July 1934, but remained in use as a road transport depot until demolished in 1986.

==Connections==
London Buses routes 44, 137, 156, 211, 344, 436, 452 and night routes N44 and N137 serve the station.

<doc id="344083" wikidata="Q850536" url="?curid=344083" title="Lamborghini Miura">
<text>The Lamborghini Miura is a sports car produced by Italian automaker Lamborghini between 1966 and 1973. The car was the first high-performance production road car with a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout, which has since become the standard for performance-oriented sports cars. When released, it was the fastest production car in the world.

The Miura was originally conceived by Lamborghini&#x27;s engineering team, which designed the car in its spare time against the wishes of company founder Ferruccio Lamborghini, who preferred powerful yet sedate grand touring cars over the race car-derived machines produced by local rival Ferrari. However, when the development mule was revealed to Ferruccio, he gave approval for its development to continue.

The Miura&#x27;s rolling chassis was presented at the 1965 Turin Auto Show, and the prototype P400 debuted at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show. It received stellar receptions from showgoers and the motoring press alike, each impressed by Marcello Gandini&#x27;s sleek styling and the car&#x27;s revolutionary mid-engine design.

Lamborghini&#x27;s flagship, the Miura received periodic updates and remained in production until 1973. A year later the Countach entered the company&#x27;s lineup, amid tumultuous financial times for the company.

== Development ==

During 1965, Lamborghini&#x27;s three top engineers, Giampaolo Dallara, Paolo Stanzani and Bob Wallace put their own time into developing a prototype car known as the P400. The engineers envisioned a road car with racing pedigree, one which could win on the track and be driven on the road by enthusiasts. The three men worked on its design at night, hoping to convince company founder Ferruccio Lamborghini such a vehicle would neither be too expensive nor distract from the company&#x27;s focus. When finally brought aboard, Lamborghini gave his engineers a free hand in the belief the P400 was a potentially valuable marketing tool, if nothing more.

The car featured a transversely-mounted mid-engine layout, a departure from previous Lamborghini cars. The V12 was also unusual in that it was effectively merged with the transmission and differential, reflecting a lack of space in the tightly wrapped design. The rolling chassis was displayed at the Turin Salon in 1965. Impressed showgoers placed orders for the car despite the lack of a body to go over the chassis.

Bertone was placed in charge of styling the prototype, which was finished just days before its debut at the 1966 Geneva Motor Show. None of the engineers had found time to check if the engine fitted inside its compartment. Committed to showing the car, they decided to fill the engine bay with ballast and keep the hood locked throughout the show, as they had three years earlier for the début of the 350GTV. Sales head Ubaldo Sgarzi was forced to turn away members of the motoring press who wanted to see the P400&#x27;s power plant. Despite this setback, the car was the highlight of the show, immediately boosting stylist Marcello Gandini&#x27;s reputation.

The favourable reaction at Geneva meant the P400 was to go into production by the following year. The name &quot;Miura&quot;, after the famous Spanish fighting bull breeder (), was chosen and featured in the company&#x27;s newly created badge. The car gained the worldwide attention of automotive enthusiasts when it was chosen for the opening sequence of the original 1969 version of &quot;The Italian Job&quot;.

== Production history ==

=== P400 ===

The earliest model of the Miura was known as the P400 (for &quot;Posteriore 4 litri&quot;). It was powered by a version of the Lamborghini V12 engine used in the 400GT at the time. The engine was mounted transversely and produced . Exactly 275 P400s were produced between 1966 and 1969 – a success for Lamborghini despite its then-steep price of .

Taking a cue from the Morris Mini, Lamborghini formed the engine and gearbox in one casting. Its shared lubrication continued until the last 96 SVs, when the case was split to allow the correct oils to be used for each element.

An unconfirmed claim holds the first 125 Miuras were built of 0.9 mm steel and are therefore lighter than later cars. All cars had steel frames and doors, with aluminium front and rear skinned body sections. When leaving the factory they were originally fitted with Pirelli Cinturato 205VR15 tyres (CN72).

==== Awards ====
The prototype version of the Miura won the prestigious Gran Turismo Trophy at the 2008 Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance, and has been re-created for use in the &quot;Gran Turismo 5&quot; video game.

=== P400S ===
The P400S Miura, also known as the Miura S, made its introduction at the Turin Motor Show in November 1968, where the original chassis had been introduced three years earlier. It was slightly revised from the P400, with the addition of power windows, bright chrome trim around external windows and headlights, new overhead inline console with new rocker switches, engine intake manifolds made 2 mm larger, different camshaft profiles, and notched trunk end panels (allowing for slightly more luggage space). The engine changes were reportedly good for an additional . The P400S had 215/70VR15 Pirelli Cinturato CN12 tyres on the front and 225/70VR15 CN12 tyres on the rear.

Other revisions were limited to creature comforts, such as a locking glovebox lid, a reversed position of the cigarette lighter and windshield wiper switch, and single release handles for front and rear body sections. Other interior improvements included the addition of power windows and optional air conditioning, available for . About 338 P400S Miura were produced between December 1968 and March 1971. One S #4407 was owned by Frank Sinatra. Miles Davis also owned a Miura; in October 1972, he crashed it while attempting to turn off of the West Side Highway at while under the influence of cocaine, breaking both of his ankles and totaling the car. Eddie Van Halen can be heard revving the engine of his Miura on the Van Halen song &quot;Panama&quot;.

=== P400SV ===
The last and most famous Miura, the P400SV or Miura SV, was presented in 1971. It featured different cam timing and altered 4X3-barrel Weber carburetors. These gave the engine an additional , to at 7,850 rpm and a maximum torque of at 5,750 rpm. The last 96 SV engines had a split sump. The gearbox now had its lubrication system separate from the engine, which allowed the use of the appropriate types of oil for the gearbox and the engine. This also alleviated concerns that metal shavings from the gearbox could travel into the engine with disastrous and expensive results, and made the application of an optional limited-slip differential far easier.
The SV can be distinguished from its predecessors by its lack of &quot;eyelashes&quot; around the headlamps, wider rear fenders to accommodate the new rear wheels and Pirelli Cinturato tyres 215/70R15 CN12 &amp; 255/60R15 CN12, and different taillights. A total of 150 SVs were produced.

There was a misprint in the SV owners manual indicating bigger intake valves in English size (but correct size in metric). The intake and exhaust valves in all 4 litre Lamborghini V12 engines remained the same throughout all models. This intake size misprint carried forward into Espada 400GT and Countach LP 400/LP 400S owners manuals as well.
=== P400 Jota ===
In 1970, Lamborghini development driver Bob Wallace created a test mule that would conform to the FIA&#x27;s Appendix J racing regulations. The car was appropriately named the Miura Jota (the pronunciation of the letter &#x27;J&#x27; in Spanish). Wallace made extensive modifications to the standard Miura chassis and engine. Weight reductions included replacing steel chassis components and body panels with the lightweight aluminium alloy Avional and replacing side windows with plastic, with the resulting car weighing approximately less than a production Miura. A front spoiler was added and the headlights were replaced with fixed, faired-in units. Wallace substituted two smaller, sill-mounted fuel tanks for the single larger original unit. The suspension was reworked and the wheels widened (9&quot; in the front, 12&quot; in the rear), and lightweight wheels were fitted. The engine was modified to produce at 8800 rpm, with an increased compression ratio (from 10.4:1 to 11.5:1), altered cams, electronic ignition, dry-sump lubrication and a less restrictive exhaust system. This single example was eventually sold to a private buyer after extensive testing. In April 1971, the car crashed on the yet-unopened ring road around the city of Brescia, and burned to the ground.

It was once widely believed that the Jota had the chassis number of #5084 (a number well out of sequence for the date in question), it has been clarified by Miura expert Joe Sackey in his book The Lamborghini Miura Bible that this is not the case, and that #5084 is in fact a factory modified SV to SVJ spec.

After the Miura Jota had been destroyed, its original owner Walter Ronchi commissioned two former Lamborghini employees to build a P400S-based tribute car. This vehicle is known under the nickname &quot;Millechiodi&quot; and has been specially modified both inside and outside to match the specifications of the original Jota.

Another recreation of the Jota was later undertaken by Chris Lawrence of Wymondham Engineering for Lamborghini owner Piet Pulford from the United Kingdom on chassis #3033. Chassis #4280 is also known to be another Jota recreation based on a Miura S specification, receiving an SV engine stamped #30633 and a Jota conversion in Japan.
=== P400 SV/J ===

There are six examples of the Miura SV/J known to be built by the factory while the Miura was still in production, one was built new (chassis #5090) and five were converted from existing SVs (chassis #4934, #4860, #4892, #4990 &amp; #5084)

One of these cars, chassis #4934, was built for the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The Shah stored this car under protection of armed guards along with another SV at the Royal Palace in Tehran. After he fled the country during the Iranian Revolution, his cars were seized by the Iranian government. The SV/J was sold to a collector in Dubai during 1995. In 1997 this car was sold in a Brooks auction to Nicolas Cage, at , becoming the model&#x27;s highest ever price at auction. Cage sold the car in 2002. Higher prices have been reached several times since then, including by SVJ #4892 selling for over $1.9M.

Of the six known original cars #4892 is a recent addition to the list of known genuine SVJ&#x27;s with factory documentation now having come to light.

A seventh SV/J was built at the Lamborghini factory between 1983 and 1987 from an unused Miura S chassis. This was made for Jean Claude Mimran, one of the Mimran brothers, the then owner of Lamborghini. Most experts do not recognize this as an &quot;official&quot; SVJ due to it being converted (albeit done by the factory) long after the Miura went out of production.

Further Miuras were subsequently upgraded to SVJ specifications (trying to imitate the real factory SVJs) by various garages in Switzerland, the USA and Japan.

=== Roadster ===
Another one-off, the Miura Roadster (actually more of a targa-model, but without a removable roof) was built by Bertone as a show car. Based on a P400, it was first shown at the 1968 Brussels Auto Show. After having been exhibited at several auto salons the car was sold to the International Lead Zinc Research Organization who turned it into a display-vehicle showcasing the possibilities of using zinc alloys in cars. The car was named the ZN75. A few other Miuras have had their tops removed, but this Bertone Miura Roadster was the only factory open-top Miura.

In 2006 the ZN75 was purchased by New York City real estate developer Adam Gordon. Gordon had Bobileff Motorcars in San Diego, California return the car to its original Bertone Roadster form. The restored car was first shown in August 2008 at the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance.

The one-of-a-kind Miura Roadster was shown at the Amelia Island Concours d&#x27;Elegance in 2013.
=== P400 SVJ Spider ===
This one-off example of the Miura was displayed at the 1981 Geneva Motor Show alongside other new Lamborghini models (Jalpa and LM002) shortly after new company CEO, Patrick Mimran, took over the factory although it was never factory authorized as a model.
Finished in pearl white, the SVJ Spider was the formerly yellow Miura S presented at the 1971 Geneva Motor Show, and uses chassis #4808
Equipped with wide wheels and a rear wing reflecting the marque&#x27;s revival, it was wrongly considered by some as a prototype for a possible limited series of Miura Spiders whereas in fact it was simply a one-off show car constructed on behalf of the Swiss Lamborghini importer Lambo-Motor AG (and as such is not an official factory modification or indeed has any link to the factory bar its original 1970 build).

Subsequently, when bought by Swiss Lamborghini collector Jean Wicki, the car had its rear wing and chin spoiler removed and was painted silver, bringing the car&#x27;s style closer to the Berlinetta SVJ. Lamborghini specialist Autodrome (France) purchased the car from Wicki and restored its bodywork and upholstery in partnership with Carrosserie Lecoq (Paris). Painted traditional Miura lime green, the car was eventually sold to a Parisian collector. The car has stiffness issues and does not drive that well (as described by Miura expert Joe Sackey).

Other than private modifications, there are only two &quot;open&quot; Miuras, officially presented in International Motor shows: the Bertone Miura Roadster, exhibited on Bertone&#x27;s own stand at Brussels in 1968, and this non-factory example, shown on the Lamborghini stand at the Geneva Motor Show in 1981.

== 2006 Miura concept ==

A Miura concept car was presented at the American Museum of Television &amp; Radio on 5 January 2006, alongside the Los Angeles Auto Show, though it was not presented at the show itself. Instead, the Miura concept car officially debuted at the North American International Auto Show two weeks later. It was the first design to be penned by Lamborghini design chief Walter de&#x27;Silva, commemorating the 40th anniversary of the 1966 Geneva introduction of the original Miura.

Lamborghini president and CEO Stefan Winkelmann denied that the concept would mark the Miura&#x27;s return to production, saying “The Miura was a celebration of our history, but Lamborghini is about the future. Retro design is not what we are here for. So we won&#x27;t do the Miura.”
== 2016 Lamborghini Special edition Aventador Miura Homage ==

To celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Miura, Lamborghini unveiled the Aventador Miura Homage at the 2016 Goodwood Festival of Speed. The special edition car has been created by the company&#x27;s Ad Personam customization division. There were only 50 units.

== Specifications ==
== Appearances in media ==
An orange Miura is seen driving through the Alps in the opening sequence of &quot;The Italian Job &quot;(1969). Although the film&#x27;s events see the car destroyed by a bulldozer, the actual vehicle used in most of the shots still exists and was restored by Lamborghini&#x27;s Polo Storico division in 2019. Two cars were supplied to Paramount Pictures by the Lamborghini factory for the scene, one of which was already wrecked and used for the post-crash scenes in the film.

<doc id="344086" wikidata="Q2529003" url="?curid=344086" title="John Davies (poet, born 1569)">
<text>Sir John Davies (16 April 1569 (baptised)8 December 1626) was an English poet, lawyer, and politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1597 and 1621. He became Attorney General for Ireland and formulated many of the legal principles that underpinned the British Empire.

==Early life==

Davies was born in Wiltshire, possibly at Chicksgrove Manor at Lower Chicksgrove, to John and Mary Davies. He was educated at Winchester College for four years, a period in which he showed much interest in literature. He studied there until the age of sixteen and went to further his education at the Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, where he stayed for just eighteen months, with most historians questioning whether he received a degree.

Davies spent some time at New Inn after his departure from Oxford, and it was at this point that he decided to pursue a career in law. In 1588 he enrolled in the Middle Temple, where he did well academically, although suffering constant reprimands for his behaviour. Following several suspensions, his behaviour cost him his enrolment.

Davies travelled to the Netherlands in 1592 with others of the Middle Temple (William Fleetwood, Richard Martin). There, in Leiden, he met the jurist Paul Merula, to whom the group had a letter of introduction from William Camden.

In 1594, Davies&#x27;s poetry brought him into contact with Queen Elizabeth. She wished him to continue his study of law at the Middle Temple and had him sworn in as a servant-in-ordinary. In the following year, his poem, &quot;Orchestra&quot;, was published in July, prior to his call to the bar from the Middle Temple. He was elected Member of Parliament for Shaftesbury in 1597.

In February 1598, Davies was disbarred for the offence of entering the dining hall of the Inns in the company of two swordsmen and striking Richard Martin with a cudgel. The victim Martin was a noted wit who had insulted him in public, and Davies immediately took a boat at the Temple steps and retired to Oxford, where he chose to write poetry. Another of his works, &quot;Nosce Teipsum&quot; (&quot;Know Thyself&quot;), was published in 1599 and found favour with the queen and with Lord Mountjoy, later Lord Deputy of Ireland.

Davies became a favourite of the queen, to whom he addressed his work &quot;Hymns to Astraea&quot; in 1599. Later that year, however, his &quot;Epigrams&quot; was included in a list of published works that the state ordered to be confiscated and burned. In 1601 he was readmitted to the bar, having made a public apology to Martin, and in the same year sat as the member of Parliament for Corfe Castle.

In 1603, he was part of the deputation sent to bring King James VI of Scotland to London as the new monarch. The Scots king was also an admirer of Davies&#x27;s poetry, and rewarded him with a knighthood and appointments (at Mountjoy&#x27;s recommendation) as solicitor-general and, later attorney-general, in Ireland.

==Ireland==

Davies arrived in Dublin in November 1603, where Mountjoy had accepted the submission of the rebel Hugh O&#x27;Neill some six months earlier, at the close of the Nine Years War.

Finding pestilence and famine all over Ireland, Davies noted that the courts still commanded respect, but that the sloth of the protestant clergy and the ruin of the churches were detrimental to religion. He condemned the practice of issuing debased coinage and, in pursuit of the establishment of regular quarter-sessions of the courts, went on the Leinster circuit through seven counties in April 1604. In 1605 he travelled to England with the commendation of Sir Arthur Chichester, who succeeded Mountjoy in government, and had returned to Ireland by July.

Davies was very much committed to reform not just in the law but in religious affairs too. He was all for banishing Catholic clergy from Ireland and for enforcing church attendances, and strict measures to this end were taken on his return. He delivered a powerful speech on 23 November 1605 in the Court of Castle Chamber, dealing with the summonsing of recusants to answer their contempt of the king&#x27;s proclamations.

In May 1606, he submitted his report of his circuit of the province of Munster to Sir Robert Cecil, the king&#x27;s secretary, and was made serjeant at law after his appointment as Attorney General. In the summer he travelled through counties Monaghan, Fermanagh and Cavan, and a year later through Meath, Westmeath, Longford, King&#x27;s and Queen&#x27;s counties, both of which circuits he reported to Cecil. Davies always looked at Ireland as a stepping-stone towards major political office in England but he knew that his chances were hurt by the death of Cecil, his patron, and his own absence from the court.

Davies became heavily involved in government efforts to establish a plantation in the lately rebellious province of Ulster. In September 1607, he delivered to Cecil his report of the Flight of the Earls, a seminal event in Irish history and, before long, had travelled into the absent earls&#x27; territories to lay indictments against them there.

In August 1608, he went with Chichester to view the escheated lands, reporting that the people, &quot;&quot;wondered as much to see the king&#x27;s deputy as the ghosts in Vurgil wondered to see AEneas alive in hell&quot;[sic]&quot;. In October, he was in England, pushing for the plantation of the province.

In May 1609, Davies was made serjeant, with a grant of lands valued at £40 p.a. He revisited England in 1610 on plantation business, which had so advanced that he thought his assistance to the commission charged with bringing the project to fruition would no longer be needed.

In 1610, he defended proceedings brought by the Irish against the plans for the plantation of Cavan, but in the following year, he begged for recall from Ireland. At about this time he wrote the &quot;Discoverie of the True Causes why Ireland was never entirely subdued&quot; (pub. 1612), a well-written – albeit polemical – account of the constitutional standing of Ireland.

==Speaker of the Irish House of Commons==

In England, Davies spent much time preparing the way for the Irish Parliament of 1613, to which he was returned for County Fermanagh. In the first sitting, he was proposed as speaker with the Crown&#x27;s approval, but he met fierce opposition from the Catholic members, who formed a very large minority and nominated a former High Court judge, Sir John Everard, the knight of the shire for County Tipperary. Everard was an open recusant, and despite his behaviour on this occasion, a man of good reputation. A scene of comical disorder ensued when Everard was placed in the chair and refused to vacate in favour of the government candidate. Davies, always a very heavy man, was seized by his own supporters and lifted bodily into his opponent&#x27;s lap; Everard was then ejected from the chair and withdrew from the chamber with 98 supporters, whereupon the vote was taken in their absence. Davies was approved as speaker by Chichester, and delivered a memorable speech on the history and role of parliament in Ireland. Everard, his rival, was summoned to England and briefly imprisoned, but was quickly pardoned and thereafter loyally supported the Crown.

In 1615, Davies&#x27;s reports of Irish cases were published; he had appeared as counsel in many of these, including the case of the Bann fishery and the cases of tanistry and gavelkind, which set precedents in Irish constitutional law, with wider implications for British colonial policy.

==Later career==
In 1617 Davies failed to win the position of Solicitor General for England and Wales and consequently resigned as Attorney-General in Ireland, having ensured that he would be replaced by his nephew William Ryves. In 1619 he returned to England permanently, in the expectation that his chance of gaining office there would be improved by his presence. He practised as king&#x27;s serjeant, and eventually went on circuit as a judge. He was a founder member of the Society of Antiquaries. In 1621, he was elected MP for Hindon, and Newcastle-under-Lyme, choosing to sit for the latter constituency. He occasionally spoke in parliament on Irish matters. Davies retired to Englefield House in Berkshire, but was then appointed Lord Chief Justice. He had always been corpulent, and on 7 December 1626 he died in his bed of apoplexy brought on after a supper party, and thus never enjoyed the appointment he had been angling for throughout his career.

==Poetry==
Davies wrote poetry in numerous forms, but is best known for his epigrammes and sonnets. In 1599 he published &quot;Nosce Teipsum&quot; (Know thyself) and &quot;Hymnes of Astraea&quot;. Queen Elizabeth became an admirer of Davies&#x27;s work, and these poems contain acrostics that spell out the phrase &quot;Elisabetha Regina&quot;.

His most famous poem, &quot;Nosce Teipsum&quot;, gained him the favour of James I, by which he won promotion in Ireland. The three-part poem is written in decasyllabic quatrains, and is concerned with one&#x27;s self-knowledge and the immortality of the soul. A. H. Bullen described it as being &quot;singularly readable for such a subject: highly accomplished verse, no Elizabethan quaintness, both subtle and terse&quot;.

Bullen also described Davies&#x27;s &quot;Orchestra, or a Poem of Dancing&quot; as &quot;brilliant and graceful&quot;. This poem, written in rhyme royal, reveals a typical Elizabethan pleasure: contemplating and trying to understand the relationship between the natural order and human activity.

Davies&#x27;s works are very well represented in Elizabethan anthologies. The last complete edition of his poems appeared in 1876 and is long out of print.

==Legacy==
In political terms, Davies was significant in his work on constitutional law and in framing the terms of the Plantation of Ulster, a model that served the English crown as it extended its colonial reach in North America and elsewhere. In literary terms, he was a fine poet who lay quite neglected from the mid-17th century, until his cause was championed by T. S. Eliot. Davies&#x27;s poem &quot;I know my soul hath power to know all things&quot; was set to music by the composer Hubert Parry in his choral work, Songs of Farewell (1916–18).

==Family and death==
Davies married Eleanor Touchet, daughter of the first Earl of Castlehaven, in March of 1609. She was one of the most prolific women writing in early seventeenth-century England, author of almost seventy pamphlets and prophecies, and one of the first women in England to see her works through to print.

During the marriage, Eleanor published numerous books of prophecy, particularly anagrammatic prophecies; her prophetic writings were a source of conflict in the marriage and Davies burned a set of the prophecies that Eleanor had been writing. Davies was exasperated by his wife&#x27;s excesses and once addressed her, &quot;I pray you weep not while I am alive, and I will give you leave to laugh when I am dead&quot;. She is said to have accurately foretold the date of his death and wore mourning clothes for the three years leading up to the predicted time: as the date approached – three days before – she &quot;gave him pass to take his long sleep&quot;.

Davies had three children by his marriage. His only son to survive infancy, John (Jack), was deaf and dumb; his daughter Lucy married Ferdinando Hastings and became Countess of Huntingdon.

On 28 July 1625, Eleanor was working on a commentary of the Book of Daniel and believed she heard the voice of the prophet; she wrote about the experience and took it to the Archbishop of Canterbury. When Davies found and burned her writing she predicted he would die within three years, and went into mourning. In November 1626, Davies was appointed to high office in England. In early December, following her husband&#x27;s appointment, Eleanor started weeping during a dinner with friends. When asked why, she explained it was in anticipation of Davies&#x27;s funeral. Davies was found in his home, dead of apoplexy, on the morning of 8 December.

In 1633, Eleanor was brought before the high commission in England on charges relating to her religious anagram practices. During a fruitless examination of her under oath, one of the commissioners devised an anagram of his own: &quot;Dame Eleanor Davys – never so mad a ladye&quot;. She was sent to prison, and afterwards remarried, but was deserted by her new husband and buried next to Davies on her death in 1652. She had continued to make prophesies until her death.

<doc id="344089" wikidata="Q468805" url="?curid=344089" title="Jorge Quiroga">
<text>Jorge Fernando &quot;Tuto&quot; Quiroga Ramírez (born 5 May 1960) is a Bolivian politician and industrial engineer who served as the 62nd president of Bolivia from 2001 to 2002. A former member of Nationalist Democratic Action, he previously served as the 36th vice president of Bolivia from 1997 to 2001 under Hugo Banzer and as minister of finance under Jaime Paz Zamora in 1992. During the interim government of Jeanine Áñez, he was briefly appointed from 2019 to 2020 as the country&#x27;s international spokesperson to denounce alleged human rights violations by the previous government.

Quiroga was a candidate in the 2005 and 2014 presidential elections, in which President Evo Morales was elected for a first and third term respectively. In both elections, Quiroga ran on the Christian Democratic Party ticket. In the 2020 presidential election, Quiroga ran as a candidate for the Libre21 coalition, but withdrew his candidacy on 11 October 2020 (seven days prior to the election) in an unsuccessful attempt to unify the Bolivian opposition and prevent the socialist MAS-IPSP candidate Luis Arce from emerging victorious.

==Background and early life==

Quiroga was born in Cochabamba. He graduated from Texas A&amp;M University in 1981 with a degree in industrial engineering, becoming the first head of state from that university. He went on to work for IBM in Austin, Texas while earning a master&#x27;s degree in business administration from St. Edward&#x27;s University. He and his American wife Virginia then moved back to Bolivia. He has 4 children: Vanessa Elena, Cristina Andrea, Adriana Patricia and Jorge Cristian.

==Vice President of Bolivia (1997–2001)==
Quiroga was Minister of Finance in 1992. He was elected as Vice President of Bolivia in 1997 running on the Nationalist Democratic Action ticket with former dictator Hugo Banzer. At 37, he was the youngest vice president in Bolivia&#x27;s history.

==President of Bolivia (2001–2002)==

He became president when Banzer resigned because of aggravated health problems (he died a year following his resignation). Quiroga assumed office as acting president on 1 July 2001 and was sworn in on 7 August, to complete Banzer&#x27;s five-year mandate.

Soon after becoming president he told a reporter from the &quot;New Yorker&quot; &quot;We [Bolivia] will be the vital heart of South America..&quot; believing that gas exports would lift the economy, that a long-anticipated transcontinental highway connecting Brazil to Chile would be built passing through the Bolivian city of Cochabamba, and that fibre-optic cables would soon be laid. He blamed Bolivia&#x27;s lack of economic progress on hypocrisy on free trade in the United States and Europe, saying &quot;Bolivia is the most open economy in Latin America. Meanwhile, American and European farm subsidies, along with tariffs on textiles and agricultural products, make it impossible for Bolivia to sell its exports in the Global North. They tell us to be competitive while tying our arms behind our backs.&quot; When asked about the Bolivian Water Wars of 2000, he said “A lot of things certainly could have been different along the way, from a lot of different actors. The net effect is that we have a city today with no resolution to the water problem. In the end it will be necessary to bring in private investment to develop the water.&quot;

== Post-presidency (2002–present) ==

Quiroga ran for president in his own right in the 2005 election, as the candidate for a new right-of-center coalition known as Social and Democratic Power (PODEMOS), which included the bulk of Banzer&#x27;s former ADN organization. His main opponent was the leftist Evo Morales of the Movement Towards Socialism. Morales won the election and Quiroga finished a distant second place, receiving 28.6% of the vote.

He has also worked as a consultant for the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 2002, he was honored in a tribute exhibit at his alma mater, Texas A&amp;M University. He is, as of November 2016, active in the private sector and many international organizations, among them: as vice-president of Club de Madrid with almost 100 former heads of state and government; on the board of Results for Development-R4D in Washington D.C.; as a member of the Inter-American Dialogue and the International Advisory Council of the China Economic Club; and in different capacities on the Global Adaptation Institute, the Foro Iberoamericano and many others. He has presided FUNDEMOS since 2002, a Bolivian public policy foundation. His areas of expertise are: management of international aid and cooperation for developing countries; macroeconomic policy; constitutional, legal and institutional reforms; private and official external debt restructuring and relief; programs to reduce drug trafficking and cocaine production; and broadly in Latin American public policy, trade, economics, finance and banking, integration, politics and development issues.

He was appointed as vice president of the Club de Madrid in 2011.

On 2 December 2019, the interim government of Jeanine Áñez appointed Quiroga as an international delegate on a special mission to denounce alleged human rights violations by the ousted Morales administration. He held the post for just over a month, before resigning on 8 January 2020 in order to announce his presidential candidacy for the snap elections to be held later that year. Throughout the election cycle, he remained around sixth place reaching between 1 and 2% in opinion polling and never surpassing 7%. On 11 October, one week before the scheduled election, Quiroga announced he was dropping out of the presidential race. He indicated in his withdrawal announcement that he wished to prevent an outright victory of Luis Arce of the Movement for Socialism party in the first electoral round by consolidating the right around Carlos Mesa.

He currently holds the role of a senior advisor at New Direction, a think tank affiliated with the European Conservatives and Reformists Party in the European Parliament.

He supported far-right candidate Javier Milei in the 2023 Argentine general election.

<text>Vincent Rodney Cheesman (21 May 194314 February 1989), known professionally as Vincent Crane, was an English keyboardist, best known as the organist for the Crazy World of Arthur Brown (he was a co-writer of that group&#x27;s 1968 hit single &quot;Fire&quot;) and subsequently for Atomic Rooster.

== Biography ==
Born Vincent Rodney Cheesman in Reading, Berkshire, he taught himself boogie woogie piano as a teenager before attending Trinity College of Music between 1961 and 1964. Influenced by Graham Bond, he took up the Hammond organ. In late 1966 he formed the Vincent Crane Combo, which comprised bass player Binky McKenzie, sax player John Claydon and drummer Gordon Hadler. In 1967 he teamed up with Arthur Brown in the Crazy World of Arthur Brown. Their debut album &quot;The Crazy World of Arthur Brown&quot; (1968) contained the song &quot;Fire&quot;, co-written by Crane, which was a chart-topping hit single in the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada, featuring Crane&#x27;s organ and brass arrangements.

During their first tour of the United States in 1968, Crane had a nervous breakdown and returned to the United Kingdom where he spent some months in the mental hospital at Banstead. Crane rejoined the band but on a subsequent tour of the United States, the band disintegrated in June 1969 when Arthur Brown temporarily disappeared to a commune and Crane and drummer Carl Palmer left to form Atomic Rooster, playing their first concert at the Lyceum in London on 29 August, headlining over Deep Purple. Atomic Rooster enjoyed success in 1971 with two hit singles, &quot;Tomorrow Night&quot; (written by Crane) and &quot;Devil&#x27;s Answer&quot;. Crane was the one constant member of the band through their many different lineups, and wrote a slim majority of their material.

Atomic Rooster published their first eponymous album in 1970, and then drummer Carl Palmer left to form Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer that same year.

Crane lived with bipolar disorder from at least 1968 onwards, periodically necessitating treatment at both out- and inpatient mental health treatment facilities.

He collaborated with other musicians on a number of albums, including Rory Gallagher (&quot;Rory Gallagher&quot;, 1971), Arthur Brown (&quot;Faster Than the Speed of Light&quot;, 1979), Peter Green, Richard Wahnfried, and Dexys Midnight Runners (&quot;Don&#x27;t Stand Me Down&quot;, 1985). In 1983, he was part of the one-off blues outfit, Katmandu, with Ray Dorset, Len Surtees, and Peter Green, who recorded the album &quot;A Case for the Blues&quot;.

As a result of his mental health issues, Crane died of a deliberate overdose of painkillers in 1989 at age 45.

<doc id="344101" wikidata="Q4656557" url="?curid=344101" title="A Door into Ocean">
<text>A Door into Ocean is a 1986 feminist science fiction novel by Joan Slonczewski. It is the first book in Slonczewski&#x27;s Elysium Cycle. The novel&#x27;s themes include ecofeminism and nonviolent revolution, as well as Slonczewski&#x27;s own knowledge in the field of biology.

== Plot ==
The novel is set in the future, on the fictional planets of Shora and Valedon. Shora is a moon of Valedon, covered by water. The inhabitants of this planet, known as Sharers, are all female. Sharers use genetic engineering to control the ecology of their planet. They are peaceful beings who &quot;share&quot; — that is, they have a spiritual and linguistic union with each other and treat everyone equally. Valedon, by contrast, is one of many planets ruled by a transhuman figure called &quot;The Patriarch.&quot;

At the beginning of the novel, the Sharers encounter a non-Sharer community from another planet, which threatens them. The Sharer Merwen the Impatient realizes that they must find out whether other kinds of &quot;people&quot; can share their life or not. Merwen goes to Valedon, to recruit a young Valan, Spinel, to return to Shora and attempt to learn their ways. This venture leads to disagreement within the Sharer community, despite the fact that a Valan noblewoman, Lady Berenice, who takes the Sharer name, Nisi the Deceiver, has lived amongst the Sharers before. Berenice, daughter of the first traders to settle on Shora, spent her childhood among the Sharers and returned to Valedon to spend time with her fiancé, Realgar, a Sardish Valan general.

To Spinel&#x27;s initial distress, after some time on Shora, his skin takes on a purple hue as his body becomes acclimated to the breathmicrobes that allow Sharers to stay longer underwater. He gradually learns the Sharer way, as a man and is finally accepted by Merwen&#x27;s daughter, Lystra, who risks her life to save him from a Shockwraith, a deadly underwater creature. Lystra&#x27;s former &#x27;lovesharer&#x27;, Rilwen, is &quot;stonesick&quot;, meaning that she has developed an addictive fascination with the stones and gems the Valan traders bring to Shora. After Rilwen&#x27;s death, Lystra and Spinel become lovesharers.

Realgar and Malachite, an envoy of the Patriarch, visit Shora to place it under Patriarchal rule. After this visit, Realgar, Berenice, and Spinel return to Valedon. Berenice eventually realizes Realgar has no intention of letting her return to Shora and that the Patriarch has arranged for Shora to come under patriarchal rule rather than exist self-governed. She fakes her death and sneaks away to Shora, despite the fact that travel has become forbidden. Meanwhile, Spinel returns to his family, who are living under Dolomite rule after the siege of their city. He helps the citizens stage a peaceful act of rebellion against the Dolomites and becomes a &quot;spirit caller.&quot; When Spinel hears what has happened to Shora while he has been away, he returns to the capital of Valedon to try and gain passage back to Shora.

Realgar, still grieving the death of Berenice but obeying orders, returns to Shora to force the Sharers to obey Patriarchal rule and Valan law. The Sharers peacefully continue their way of life, despite the increasing military presence and escalating violence of Realgar&#x27;s soldiers. Realgar has several Sharers kidnapped and probed for information, though the Sharers enter &quot;whitetrance&quot;, a vulnerable state close to death in which their bodies turn wholly white as their minds retreat within. Some kidnapped Sharers, including Lystra, are taken to Valedon. Spinel sees Lystra and calls out to her, breaking her whitetrance. Spinel&#x27;s ability to reach the Sharers causes Realgar to take him and the Sharers back to Shora, where the Sharers are tortured. Several of Realgar&#x27;s soldiers become increasingly sympathetic to the Sharers. Among them is the scientist, Siderite, who is tasked with learning the Sharer&#x27;s advanced science for the Patriarch and becomes apprenticed to Usha, a &quot;lifesharer&quot; who practices advanced medicine.

After finding out Berenice still lives, Realgar publicly executes several Sharers, and almost executes Merwen before taking her back to the military compound. Merwen attempts to &quot;share&quot; with Realgar to cure him of what the Sharers consider the Valan&#x27;s sickness, the fear that causes them to &quot;hasten death&quot; (kill). The Sharers continue to protest through non-violence, though this results in many Sharer deaths. They discover a cure for the microbes the Valans have released to keep away the dangerous seaswallowers and counteract it to allow the seaswallowers to return and bring the planet back into harmony. The return of the seaswallowers nearly destroys the Valan military compounds, forcing the Valan troops to withdraw. Travel between the two planets becomes banned. Berenice remains on Shora, while Spinel almost returns to Valedon to spread nonviolent resistance against the Patriarch. However, when Lystra decides not to follow, Spinel decides to stay as well.

== Major themes ==

=== Ecofeminism ===
Slonczewski&#x27;s Sharers are committed to environmental sustainability. They restrict their own reproduction to sustainable levels and view all species on their world as interconnected, including seaswallowers, a dangerous species that often destroy the rafts on which Sharers live and whose natural actions result in the deaths of Sharers. The Sharer worldview extends to their environment, their surrounding ecosystem. They cannot act upon their plants and animals without being acted upon in return. So, for example, because Sharers consume plants and animals as food, they accept the fact that they in turn will become food for other life forms; that predators will ultimately consume them.

Slonczewski&#x27;s premise associates the exploitative and patriarchal practices of Valedon as males and ecological wisdom as female. Eric C. Otto argues that Slonczewski subverts this essentialism by depicting women, not as more in tune with ecology than men, but as allies with the non-human natural due to their shared subordinate status under patriarchy and their subjection to capitalist practices. The Sharers are not depicted as &quot;noble savages&quot; nor are they aligned with nature because they lack technology; rather, the Sharers are revealed to be extremely technologically knowledgeable and use their advanced scientific techniques for ecological purposes.

=== Language ===
A unique expression of the Sharer way is their language, in which subject and object are interchangeable. The Sharers know by context what subject and object are—but their language is bidirectional and does not make a distinction. As a result, they always know that what one person &quot;forces&quot; upon another can always go the other way. Their language impedes anyone from &quot;giving orders&quot; to dominate others. For example, if a stranger says, &quot;You must obey me,&quot; the Sharer hears, &quot;I must obey you,&quot; or (the closest translation), &quot;We must share agreement.&quot; Their language reinforces the Sharers&#x27; inability to accept any situation in which one individual dominates another by force.

Even the language&#x27;s verbs enforce the Sharer&#x27;s beliefs. All verbs &quot;embed the notion of reciprocity in every action&quot; says Vint, who gives the verb examples, “learnsharing, worksharing, lovesharing” (37). The verb &quot;hitsharing&quot; is also an example because the verb is described as hitting a rock, which will hit back in turn, because of the vibrations one feels on their arms. In this way, the Sharers&#x27; language attributes agency beyond the human, with even non-living matter having the capacity to act. 

=== Non-violence ===
Sharers do not engage in physical violence as, in the Sharer language, to hurt is to be hurt. However, Slonczewski is also careful not to clearly assign violence and non-violence strictly along Sharer/Valan or male/female lines. Some Sharers are willing to attempt violence, while some Valans, both male and female, embrace the Sharer lifestyle and ideals.

The Sharers take egalitarianism for granted because they share and they lack the concept of &quot;power-over&quot;, making their society one in which conflicts are settled without violence. When they are being threatened by an outside power, they resist nonviolently because they refuse to believe in power. Thus, the Sharers can never be subdued by force. The Sharer way of nonviolence is more than spiritual. It is based on historical realities of nonviolent resistance. The author based the events of their novel on much historical research, particularly the writings of peace historian Gene Sharp. The novel includes much biological research into the evolution of innate capacities for nonviolence. For example, the participation of children in nonviolent resistance draws on deep instinctual responses found in humans and related mammals.

=== LGBT themes ===
The novel has been described as depicting a &quot;lesbian feminist eco-utopia&quot; and lesbian separatism. The women of Shora love and reproduce with each other, while homosexuality is illegal on Valedon and referred to as &quot;immoral cohabitation.&quot; Slonczewski has stated that &quot;The ocean women of &quot;A Door into Ocean&quot; are pansexual – they love regardless of gender&quot;.

Jane L. Donawerth argues that &quot;A Door Into Ocean&quot; complicates the conventions of science fiction lesbian separatist utopias through the incorporation of a young male into the Sharers of Shora. She writes that Spinel &quot;is asked to become a truly female man, a lesbian man&quot; in entering a sexual relationship with Lystra, a Sharer, without penetration.

=== Quakerism ===
The Sharer&#x27;s nonviolence is a reflection of Slonczewski&#x27;s Quaker ethos. Slonczewski has said that, &quot;Sharers have a lot in common with Quakers, particularly in the dynamic of their &quot;meetings.&quot;&quot;

== Development history ==
Slonczewski described her motiviations to write &quot;A Door Into Ocean&quot;, saying &quot;I really wanted to write about how the countries of Eastern Europe could free themselves from Soviet domination.&quot; The book was rejected by Del Rey Books, which had published Slonczewski&#x27;s earlier novel, &quot;Still Forms on Foxfield&quot;, as well as several other publishers. In an interview, Slonczewski explained that these rejections by saying, &quot;This was before the collapse of the Soviet Union, and there was an absolute dogma that peace never works. Nobody wanted to look at a book that said otherwise.&quot;

&quot;A Door Into Ocean&quot; is the first book in the Elysium series, and is followed by &quot;Daughter of Elysium&quot; (1993), &quot;The Children Star&quot; (1998), and &quot;Brain Plague&quot; (2000).

<text>An aerodrome or airfield is a location from which aircraft flight operations take place, regardless of whether they involve air cargo, passengers, or neither, and regardless of whether it is for public or private use. Aerodromes include small general aviation airfields, large commercial airports, and military air bases.

The term &quot;airport&quot; may imply a certain stature (having satisfied certain certification criteria or regulatory requirements) that not all aerodromes may have achieved. That means that all airports are aerodromes, but not all aerodromes are airports. Usage of the term &quot;aerodrome&quot; (or &quot;airfield&quot;) remains more common in Commonwealth English, and is conversely almost unknown in American English, where the term &quot;airport&quot; is applied almost exclusively.

A water aerodrome is an area of open water used regularly by seaplanes, floatplanes or amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off.

In formal terminology, as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), an aerodrome is &quot;a defined area on land or water (including any buildings, installations, and equipment) intended to be used either wholly or in part for the arrival, departure, and surface movement of aircraft.&quot;

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;aerodrome&quot; derives from Ancient Greek (aḗr), &quot;air&quot;, and (drómos), &quot;road&quot; or &quot;course&quot;, literally meaning &quot;air course&quot;. An ancient linguistic parallel is &quot;hippodrome&quot; (a stadium for horse racing and chariot racing), derived from (híppos), &quot;horse&quot;, and δρόμος (drómos), &quot;course&quot;. A modern linguistic parallel is &quot;velodrome&quot;, an arena for velocipedes. Αεροδρόμιο is the word for airport in Modern Greek, which transliterates as aerodromio.

In British military usage, the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War, and the Royal Air Force in the First and Second World Wars, used the term—it had the advantage that their French allies, on whose soil they were often based, and with whom they co-operated, used the cognate term &quot;aérodrome&quot;.

In Canada and Australia, &quot;aerodrome&quot; is a legal term of art for any area of land or water used for aircraft operation, regardless of facilities.

International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) documents use the term &quot;aerodrome&quot;, for example, in the Annex to the ICAO Convention about aerodromes, their physical characteristics, and their operation. However, the terms &quot;airfield&quot; or &quot;airport&quot; mostly superseded use of &quot;aerodrome&quot; after the Second World War, in colloquial language.

== History ==
In the early days of aviation, when there were no paved runways and all landing fields were grass, a typical airfield might permit takeoffs and landings in only a couple of directions, much like today&#x27;s airports, whereas an aerodrome was distinguished, by virtue of its much greater size, by its ability to handle landings and takeoffs in any direction. The ability to always take off and land directly into the wind, regardless of the wind&#x27;s direction, was an important advantage in the earliest days of aviation when an airplane&#x27;s performance in a crosswind takeoff or landing might be poor or even dangerous. The development of differential braking in aircraft, improved aircraft performance, utilization of paved runways, and the fact that a circular aerodrome required much more space than did the &quot;L&quot; or triangle shaped airfield, eventually made the early aerodromes obsolete.

The unimproved airfield remains a phenomenon in military aspects. The DHC-4 Caribou served in the United States military in Vietnam (designated as the CV-2), landing on rough, unimproved airfields where the C-130 Hercules workhorse could not operate. Earlier, the Ju 52 and Fieseler &quot;Storch&quot; could do the same, one example of the latter taking off from the Führerbunker whilst completely surrounded by Soviet troops.

== Types ==

===Airport===

In colloquial use in certain environments, the terms &quot;airport&quot; and &quot;aerodrome&quot; are often interchanged. However, in general, the term &quot;airport&quot; may imply or confer a certain stature upon the aviation facility that other aerodromes may not have achieved. In some jurisdictions, &quot;airport&quot; is a legal term of art reserved exclusively for those aerodromes certified or licensed as airports by the relevant civil aviation authority after meeting specified certification criteria or regulatory requirements.

===Air base===

An air base is an aerodrome with significant facilities to support aircraft and crew. The term is usually reserved for military bases, but also applies to civil seaplane bases.

===Airstrip===

An airstrip is a small aerodrome that consists only of a runway with perhaps fueling equipment. They are generally in remote locations, e.g. . Many airstrips (now mostly abandoned) were built on the hundreds of islands in the Pacific Ocean during the Second World War. A few airstrips grew to become full-fledged airbases as the strategic or economic importance of a region increased over time.

An advanced landing ground was a temporary airstrip used by the Allies in the run-up to and during the invasion of Normandy, and these were built both in Britain, and on the continent.

===Water aerodrome===
A water aerodrome or seaplane base is an area of open water used regularly by seaplanes, floatplanes and amphibious aircraft for landing and taking off. It may have a terminal building on land and/or a place where the plane can come to shore and dock like a boat to load and unload (for example, Yellowknife Water Aerodrome). Some are co-located with a land based airport and are certified airports in their own right. These include Vancouver International Water Airport and Vancouver International Airport. Others, such as Vancouver Harbour Flight Centre have their own control tower, Vancouver Harbour Control Tower.

== By country ==

===Canada===
The Canadian Aeronautical Information Manual says &quot;...for the most part, all of Canada can be an aerodrome&quot;, however, there are also &quot;registered aerodromes&quot; and &quot;certified airports&quot;. To become a registered aerodrome, the operator must maintain certain standards and keep the Minister of Transport informed of any changes. To be certified as an airport the aerodrome, which usually supports commercial operations, must meet safety standards. Nav Canada, the private company responsible for air traffic control services in Canada, publishes the Canada Flight Supplement, a directory of all registered Canadian land aerodromes, as well as the Canada Water Aerodrome Supplement (CWAS).

===Republic of Ireland===

Casement Aerodrome is the main military airport used by the Irish Air Corps. The term &quot;aerodrome&quot; is used for airports and airfields of lesser importance in Ireland, such as those at Abbeyshrule; Bantry; Birr; Inisheer; Inishmaan; Inishmore; Newcastle, County Wicklow; and Trim.

<text>David Davies (1742–1819) was a Welsh clergyman in the Church of England and author. He was born on 9 February 1742 of Welsh parentage at Machynlleth and educated at Codrington College, Barbados and Jesus College, Oxford. His father was Richard Davies.

He was Rector of Barkham in Berkshire, England, from 1781 until his death.

Davies studied the condition of the labouring poor, recorded statistics of their wages, cost of food, etc. in various districts of England and Scotland. A controversial rapid rise in Poor Law costs at the time (especially in rural parishes) instigated debates on the issue, and inspired Davies to compile statistics from which he produced data covering the income and expenditure of certain families in the country (including three in the parishes of Llandegla and Llanarmon (Denbighshire), and two in the parishes of Llanfor and Llanycil (Merioneth).

He published his findings in 1795 as a book called &quot;Cases of Labourers in Husbandry Stated and Considered in Three Parts&quot;, an important work in social history. Part 1, Section 2 contains what is considered the first usage of household surveys. Davies claims to have collected 2–3 surveys from every county in the kingdom with the help of his friends. From these surveys, poor households on average spent 75% of their income on food. 
Through this publication, Davies called for a marked improvement in the standard of living for agricultural labourers. He demonstrated that the &#x27;Poor Rates&#x27; were used as a means to keep wages down. He presented calculations in Section 7, which show that the number of days an average laborer had to work to afford a quarter of wheat doubled between the 14th century and the 18th century. For policy recommendations, he advocated the principle of a minimum wage.

He died on 6 February 1819 at Barkham.

<doc id="344107" wikidata="Q5382993" url="?curid=344107" title="Epilobium canum">
<text>Epilobium canum, also known as California fuchsia or Zauschneria, is a species of willowherb in the evening primrose family (Onagraceae). It is native to dry slopes and in chaparral of western North America, especially California. It is a perennial plant, notable for the profusion of bright scarlet flowers in late summer and autumn.

The name reflects that in the past it used to be treated in a distinct genus &quot;Zauschneria&quot;, but modern studies have shown that it is best placed within the genus &quot;Epilobium&quot;. Other common names include California-fuchsia (from the resemblance of the flowers to those of fuchsias), hummingbird flower or hummingbird trumpet (the flowers are very attractive to hummingbirds), and firechalice.

The original genus name was in honor of Johann Baptista Josef Zauschner (1737–1799), a professor of medicine and botany in Prague.

==Description==
It is a subshrub growing to 60 cm tall. Native populations of these plants exhibit considerable variation in appearance and habit. The small leaves may be opposite or alternate, lance-shaped or ovate, with short to nonexistent stalks, and range in color from green to nearly white. Overall shape may be matting or mounding, the plants commonly spreading via rhizomes. The racemes of tubular or funnel-shaped flowers are terminal, and colors are mostly reddish, ranging from fuchsia to pink to red-orange.

The wide degree of variation has led to the description of many subspecies, mostly no longer recognised as distinct due to the extensive intergradation between them; the following are still recognised:
* &quot;Epilobium canum&quot; subsp. &quot;canum&quot; (including subsp. &quot;angustifolia&quot;, subsp. &quot;microphylla&quot;)
* &quot;Epilobium canum&quot; subsp. &quot;garrettii&quot;
* &quot;Epilobium canum&quot; subsp. &quot;latifolium&quot;
==Cultivation==
As befits their origin, they prefer to be cultivated in well-drained soil exposed to full sun but protected from the wind, and need little watering. &quot;Epilobium canum&quot; subsp. &quot;canum&quot; is hardy to USDA zone 8a. &quot;Epilobium canum&quot; (or its cultivar(s)) is a recipient of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit under the &quot;Zauschneria californica&quot; name.

A small number of hybrid cultivars have been introduced by various growers, in some cases by working from isolated populations, such as those on Santa Cruz Island off the California coast.

<doc id="344108" wikidata="Q7101355" url="?curid=344108" title="Oregon State Board of Higher Education">
<text>The Oregon State Board of Higher Education was the statutory governing board for the Oregon University System from 1909 to 2015. The board was composed of eleven members appointed by the Governor of Oregon and confirmed by the Oregon State Senate. Nine members were appointed for four year terms; two members were students and appointed for two year terms.

== History ==
The board was first known as the Oregon State Board of Higher Curricula and maintained that name from 1909 to 1929. In 1929 the Oregon Legislature passed chapter 251, Oregon Laws 1929, that officially unified the state&#x27;s public universities under the auspices of the newly renamed &quot;Oregon State Board of Higher Education&quot;. Part of that law abolished each public school&#x27;s board of regents and created a nine-member State Board of Higher Education. Becky Johnson, the first person whose appointment to a state Commission was subject to Senate approval, served on the Board from 1962 - 1975.

Former Governor of Oregon Neil Goldschmidt was appointed and selected as the board&#x27;s president in January 2004, but the Senate confirmation process that approved his appointment also led to revelations of a decades-old sex scandal. Goldschmidt resigned from the board three months after his appointment. Governor Ted Kulongoski took the unusual step of assuming the board presidency following Goldschmidt&#x27;s resignation.

The most recent addition to the Board was Jim Francesconi, former Portland City Councillor and mayoral candidate. He was confirmed by a vote of 28-1 in February, 2007, with Senator Vicki Walker casting the sole &quot;no&quot; vote, and Senator Rick Metsger absent.

Both the Oregon State Board of Higher Education and the Oregon University System closed permanently on June 30, 2015. Most of the authorizations and programs of those two agencies were assumed by the Oregon Higher Education Coordinating Commission, which was formed in 2011 and expanded by the legislature in 2013 when independent boards were established for Oregon State University, University of Oregon, and Portland State University.

<text>Canadian Baptist Ministries (CBM) or is an Baptist Christian denomination in Canada. It is a member of the Baptist World Alliance. The headquarter is in Mississauga, Ontario.

==History==
The first Baptist church in what is now Canada was founded by an American pastor in Sackville, New Brunswick in 1763. More churches were founded throughout Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Lower Canada, and Upper Canada by American pastors and itinerant preachers.

===Mission Boards===
The first Baptist born in Canada sent out as a missionary was Samuel S. Day, who was born in Upper Canada, and sent to India by the American Baptist Missionary Union (ABMU) in 1835. In 1866, A.V. Timpany was also appoint by the ABMU to go to India, and that prompted the creation of a Canadian auxiliary to the ABMU in 1866. In 1869, the Canadian auxiliary was reorganised as the Regular Baptist Foreign Missionary Society of Canada, and in 1889, the name was changed to The Board of Foreign Missions of the regular Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec.

Meanwhile, Baptist Churches in the Maritime colonies had been supporting the work of Adoniram Judson in Burma since 1814. In 1845, the Churches sent out Rev. R.E. Burpee and his wife Laleah to Burma, also under the auspices of the ABMU. The Maritime Baptist Convention formed a Foreign Mission Board in 1865.

In 1874, the Canadian Baptist Foreign Missionary Society was founded in Ontario.

The &quot;Canadian Baptist Foreign Mission Board&quot; (CBFMB) was founded in 1912. The Canadian Baptist Foreign Mission Board was renamed to &quot;Canadian Baptist Overseas Missions Board&quot; (CBOMB) on May 1, 1970. The Canadian Baptist Overseas Missions Board was renamed again to &quot;Canadian Baptist International Ministries&quot; (CBIM) in 1990.

===National Federation===
Efforts to form a national Baptist body date back to 1900. In 1900, delegates from across Canada met in Winnipeg and formed the &quot;National Baptist Convention of Canada&quot;. Inexplicably, it never met again. As such, no national coordinating body of Baptists existed in Canada until the Baptist Federation of Canada was organized at Saint John, New Brunswick in 1944. The Canadian Baptists of Ontario and Quebec, the Canadian Baptists of Western Canada, and the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada initiated the Federation and were joined by l&#x27;Union d&#x27;Églises baptistes francophones du Canada in 1970. 

In 1947, the Baptist Convention of Ontario and Quebec authorized the ordination of women ministers and Muriel Spurgeon Carder was the first ordained woman. In the United Baptist Convention of the Atlantic Provinces, Josephine Moore was the first in 1954. In the Baptist Union of Western Canada, Mae Benedict was the first in 1959.

It was renamed &quot;Canadian Baptist Federation&quot; (CBF) in 1982.

===Merger===
In 1995, the &quot;Canadian Baptist Federation&quot; merged with the &quot;Canadian Baptist International Ministries&quot; to form the Canadian Baptist Ministries.

==Statistics==
According to a census published by the association in 2023, it claimed 971 churches and 81,685 members.

==Humanitarian aid==

CBM support humanitarian projects in Canada and worldwide.

It engages in international mission on behalf of Canadian Baptist churches and brokers national cooperation among the four regional denominations and Women&#x27;s groups.

== Regions ==
It has 4 regional unions of churches : Canadian Baptists of Ontario and Quebec, Canadian Baptists of Western Canada, the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada and Union d&#x27;Églises baptistes francophones du Canada.

== Schools ==

The regional conventions of the convention have participated in the founding of various universities which have gone public. There was the founding of Acadia University by the Canadian Baptists of Atlantic Canada in 1838, the founding of McMaster University by the Canadian Baptists of Ontario and Quebec in 1881 and Brandon University by the Canadian Baptists of Western Canada in 1890. 

The organization has several theological institutes affiliated and a partner university, Crandall University.
