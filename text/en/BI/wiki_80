<text>Ipswich Town Football Club is a professional football club based in Ipswich, Suffolk, East Anglia, England. The club competes in the Premier League, the top tier of English football, following back to back promotions from League One and the Championship. 

Ipswich Town were founded in 1878 but did not turn professional until 1936; the club was elected to the Football League in 1938. Ipswich won the league title in 1961–62, their first season in the top flight, and finished runners-up in 1980–81 and 1981–82. They finished in the top six in the First Division for ten years, and won the FA Cup in 1978 and UEFA Cup in 1981. They have never lost at home in European competition, having defeated teams such as Real Madrid, AC Milan, Inter Milan, Lazio and Barcelona.

Ipswich play their home games at Portman Road. They have a long-standing rivalry with Norwich City, against whom they contest the East Anglian derby. The club&#x27;s traditional home colours are blue shirts with white shorts and blue socks.

== History ==


=== Early years and entry to the Football League (1878–1954) ===
The club was founded as an amateur side in 1878 and were known as Ipswich A.F.C. until 1888 when they merged with Ipswich Rugby Club to form Ipswich Town Football Club. The team won a number of local cup competitions, including the Suffolk Challenge Cup and the Suffolk Senior Cup. After playing in the Norfolk &amp; Suffolk League from 1899 and the South East Anglian League between 1903 and 1906, they joined the Southern Amateur League in 1907 and, with results improving steadily, became champions in the 1921–22 season. The club won the league a further three times, in 1929–30, 1932–33 and 1933–34, before becoming founder members of the Eastern Counties Football League at the end of the 1934–35 season. A year later, the club turned professional and joined the Southern League, which they won in its first season and finished third in the next.

Ipswich were elected to the Football League on 30 May 1938, and played in the Third Division South until the end of the 1953–54 season, when they won the title and promotion to the Second Division.

=== Promotion and First Division success (1954–1963) ===
The club were immediately relegated back to the Third Division South the following year at the end of a poor season, but made better progress after Scott Duncan was replaced as team manager by Alf Ramsey in August 1955. The club won the Third Division South title again in 1956–57, and returned to the higher division. This time, Ipswich established themselves in the Second Division, and as the division champions, won promotion to the top level of English football, the First Division, in 1960–61.
In the top flight for the first time, Ipswich became champions of the Football League at the first attempt in 1961–62. As English league champions, they qualified for the 1962–63 European Cup, defeating Maltese side Floriana 14–1 on aggregate before losing to AC Milan. Ramsey left the club in April 1963 to take charge of the England national team. Under his leadership the England team won the 1966 World Cup. He received a knighthood for &quot;services to football&quot; in 1967.

=== Decline and revival after Ramsey (1963–1969) ===
Ramsey was replaced by Jackie Milburn, under whose leadership fortunes on the pitch plummeted. Two years after winning the league title, Ipswich slipped down to the Second Division in 1964, conceding 121 league goals in 42 games – one of the worst-ever defensive records in English senior football. Milburn quit after just one full season and was replaced by Bill McGarry in 1964. The club remained in the Second Division for four years until McGarry guided Ipswich to promotion along with his assistant Sammy Chung in the 1967–68 season, winning the division by a single point ahead of Queens Park Rangers. During the summer of 1968, Steve Stacey, signed from fourth division side Wrexham, went on to make his debut on 14 September 1968 becoming the first black player to represent the club in the football league. McGarry left to manage Wolves and was replaced by Bobby Robson in January 1969.

=== The Bobby Robson era (1969–1982) ===
Robson led Ipswich to two major trophies and several seasons in top flight European football. The successful period began in 1973 when the club won the Texaco Cup and finished fourth in the league, qualifying for the UEFA Cup for the first time. In the 1974–75 season they reached the semi-finals of the FA Cup for the first time, losing to West Ham United after a replay, and finished third in the league. By the late 1970s, Robson had built a strong side with talent in every department, introducing the Dutch pair Arnold Mühren and Frans Thijssen to add flair to a team that featured British internationals including John Wark, Terry Butcher and Paul Mariner, although the Ipswich squad perhaps lacked the depth of established big clubs like Liverpool and Manchester United. Ipswich regularly featured in the top five of the league and in the UEFA Cup. At their peak in the 1979–80 season, they beat Manchester United 6–0 in a league game at Portman Road, a game where United goalkeeper Gary Bailey also saved three penalties. The defeat cost United two points – the margin which eventually separated them and champions Liverpool. Major success came in 1978 when Ipswich beat Arsenal at Wembley Stadium to win their only FA Cup trophy. The triumph was followed by almost winning the triple in 1980–81. Ipswich led the top division for most of the season and were on course to win a second league title plus FA Cup and European honours. However, injuries and fixture congestion (a squad of thirteen players played over sixty matches) took its toll and Ipswich ultimately came runners up to Aston Villa (a side they had beaten home and away in the league and in the FA Cup) and were semi-finalists in the FA Cup. Ipswich did win the UEFA Cup, however, in 1981 with a 5–4 victory over AZ Alkmaar in the two-legged final. The run to the final included a 4–1 win at St Etienne, captained by Michel Platini. The club also finished league runners-up in the subsequent 1981/82 season.

Robson&#x27;s success with Ipswich attracted the attention of many bigger clubs, and he was linked with the Manchester United job when Dave Sexton was sacked in May 1981, but the job went to Ron Atkinson instead. The Football Association lured Robson away from Portman Road a year later, when he accepted their offer to manage the England national team in July 1982.

=== Relegation after Robson and promotion under Lyall (1982–1994) ===
Robson&#x27;s successor at Ipswich was his assistant manager Bobby Ferguson. Under Ferguson, Town finished mid-table twice, but worsening performances meant that they began to struggle in the top division. The recent construction of an expensive new stand at Portman Road limited the club&#x27;s budget, despite the money gained from sales of key players including Thijssen and Wark.

Ipswich were finally relegated to the Second Division at the end of the 1985–86 season. Butcher, the last remaining key player from the successful 1981 team, was sold to Rangers that summer. Ferguson, who had remained in charge despite the relegation, left the club in May 1987 after his contract expired, following Ipswich&#x27;s failure to return to the First Division. Ipswich Town were then managed by John Duncan for three years until he was replaced by former West Ham United boss John Lyall in May 1990, with Ipswich still in the Second Division. Lyall guided Ipswich to the Second Division title and promotion to the new FA Premier League, ready for the 1992–93 season. Suffering only two league defeats before the New Year, Ipswich started the season well and were fourth in the Premier League in January 1993, but a dip in form during the final weeks of the season saw them finish 16th. Poor form continued into the following season and Ipswich only avoided relegation that year when Sheffield United suffered a 3–2 defeat at Chelsea on the final day of the season. Six months later, fortunes on the pitch had not improved, and Lyall was sacked in December 1994 with the club bottom of the Premiership.

=== Relegation and revival under George Burley (1994–2002) ===
Lyall&#x27;s successor, George Burley, was unable to turn team performances around, and Ipswich were dealt a Premiership record defeat, 9–0, at Manchester United, on their way to relegation. Back in the second tier of the league, Burley led the club to three consecutive promotion playoffs, but they were to endure defeats in all three semi-finals. Ipswich finally returned to the Premiership in 2000 after coming from behind to beat Barnsley 4–2 in the last Division One playoff final at Wembley Stadium. Ipswich performed well in the Premiership in their first season with Burley&#x27;s side finishing in an impressive fifth place—being pipped by Liverpool on the last day of the season for a place in the Champions League. Consolation was a UEFA Cup place and FA Premier League Manager of the Year Award for Burley.

However, the following season was not so successful. The team took only one win in their opening seventeen league games, leaving them bottom in December. Despite a good run of form in January and February, Burley could not save the club from relegation back to the Championship at the end of the season. The loss of income due to relegation also led to the club going into financial administration. There was the minor consolation of again qualifying for the UEFA Cup, this time via the UEFA Fair Play ranking, and Ipswich survived two ties before losing in the second round proper to Czech side Slovan Liberec. A slow start to the season, culminating in a 0–3 defeat at struggling Grimsby Town, meant that Burley was sacked in October 2002 after nearly eight years as manager.

=== Years in the Championship (2002–2019) ===
First team coach Tony Mowbray was given four matches as caretaker manager, winning once, but he was ultimately replaced as manager by the former Oldham Athletic, Everton and Manchester City manager Joe Royle, who had played for local rival Norwich City. Royle inherited a side struggling near the Division One relegation zone, but revived fortunes such that the team narrowly failed to reach the playoffs. The 2003–04 season saw the club come out of administration and continue to challenge for promotion back to the Premier League. They finished that season in fifth, but were defeated in the playoff semi-finals by West Ham United.

Narrowly missing automatic promotion in 2004–05, Royle again took Ipswich to the play-offs, but once more they lost to West Ham United in the semi-finals. 2005–06 saw Ipswich finish in 15th place—the club&#x27;s lowest finish since 1966. Joe Royle resigned by mutual consent on 11 May 2006, and a month later, Jim Magilton was officially announced as the new manager. In November 2007, the club were involved in takeover discussions with both businessman Marcus Evans and former Birmingham City director David Sullivan. In December 2007, Evans completed his takeover of the club, purchasing an 87.5% stake in the club, investing around £44 million, which included the purchase of the club&#x27;s existing £32 million debt. The club agreed a sponsorship deal with the Marcus Evans Group on 20 May 2008, lasting until 2018, the longest in the club&#x27;s history.

After failing to reach the playoffs despite substantial investment, Magilton was sacked in April 2009, and new Chief Executive Simon Clegg replaced him with former Manchester United player, Roy Keane. Keane&#x27;s spell as manager came to an end after an unsuccessful 18 months, when he was sacked in January 2011, to be replaced briefly by Ian McParland in a caretaker role before Paul Jewell took the reins on a permanent basis. A poor start to the 2012/13 season with Ipswich bottom of the Championship after winning only one of their first twelve games, led to Jewell leaving his position on 24 October 2012 by mutual consent.

He was replaced temporarily by Chris Hutchings for a single match in a caretaker role, before former Wolves boss Mick McCarthy was appointed full-time on 1 November 2012. McCarthy led Ipswich to avoid relegation, taking them from bottom of the league in November to finish in 14th position. The following season produced a 9th-place finish and in the 2014–15 season a 6th place and play-off finish – though the club lost in the semi-finals to local rivals Norwich City 4–2 on aggregate. Ipswich ended the 2016–17 season in 16th place, their lowest finish since the 1958–59 season. McCarthy announced that he would be leaving the club at the end of the 2017–18 season on 23 March 2018, though he ultimately left the role early with four games to go. He was replaced until the end of the season by Bryan Klug as a caretaker manager and Ipswich finished the season in 12th.

On 30 May 2018, Paul Hurst was announced as the new manager of the club on a three-year contract. However, after a poor start to the season and with the team bottom of the table, Hurst was sacked in October 2018 after less than five months in charge – making him the shortest serving manager in the club&#x27;s history. He was replaced by former Norwich City manager Paul Lambert, but he was unable to prevent relegation to League One at the end of the 2018–19 season, ending Ipswich&#x27;s 63-year stay in the top two tiers of English football.

=== League One and rise to the Premier League (2019–present) ===

Lambert remained as manager following relegation to take charge of Ipswich&#x27;s first season in the third tier since 1957. Ipswich finished the season in 11th place, the club&#x27;s lowest finish since 1953. The standings were decided by points-per-game due to the season&#x27;s suspension in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. After failing to mount a promotion challenge during the following season, Lambert left the club by mutual consent on 28 February 2021. Former Wigan boss Paul Cook was appointed as his replacement three days later.

On 7 April 2021, the club announced that US investment group Gamechanger 20 Limited had purchased a majority stake in the club. The consortium was made up of Ohio-based investment group ORG Portfolio Management, the &quot;Three Lions Fund&quot; (made up of three Phoenix Rising FC board members including Brett M. Johnson, Berke Bakay and Mark Detmer) and former owner Marcus Evans, who remained as a minority shareholder. Mike O&#x27;Leary, former West Bromwich Albion chief executive, was appointed as the club&#x27;s chairman following the acquisition.

Ipswich finished the 2020–21 season in ninth place, three places outside the play-offs. Expectations were high ahead of the following season, but following a series of disappointing results, Cook was sacked in December 2021. On 16 December 2021, Kieran McKenna, first-team coach at Manchester United, was appointed to replace Cook. Ipswich finished the 2021–22 season in 11th place.
With McKenna&#x27;s first full season in charge, the following season proved more successful. After an undefeated streak of 18 league games, with several club records broken, Ipswich were promoted back to the Championship as runners-up. Ipswich finished the 2022–23 season in second place, with 98 points and scoring 101 league goals.

After winning their final league game of the 2023–24 season, Ipswich achieved back-to-back promotions, becoming the fifth team to do so, and were promoted as runners-up to end their 22-year absence from the top tier. They sealed the runner-up spot with 96 points, boasting the highest goal tally of 92.
== Crest and colours ==
=== Crest ===
Ipswich Town&#x27;s shirts did not sport a crest until the mid-1960s, when they adopted a design based on the Ipswich coat of arms, featuring a gold lion rampant guardant on a red background on the left half and three gold ramparts on a blue background on the right half. In 1972, the crest was redesigned as the result of a competition, won by the Treasurer of the Supporters Club, John Gammage. Each element of the new design was intended to represent the region.
 This crest was re-used on the home and goalkeeper kit during the 2020–21 season, in commemoration of the 40th anniversary of Ipswich&#x27;s UEFA Cup triumph. The crest was modified in 1995 after consultation with a Supporters Forum, with the turrets of the Wolsey Gate moved to the top of the crest, the yellow background changed to red, the Suffolk Punch given a more dominant physique and the F.C. expanded to &quot;Football Club&quot;. Three stars were added to the sleeve of the team&#x27;s away shirt for the 2004–05 season, and also to the home kit for the 2005–06 season. These stars were added to represent the three major trophies which Ipswich Town have won; the FA Cup, the UEFA Cup and the old First Division. The stars were relocated directly above the crest when the shirt was redesigned prior to the 2007–08 season, with them being moved again in 2022–23 to the back of the shirt.

=== Colours ===

Ipswich Town&#x27;s traditional home colours are blue shirts with white shorts and blue socks. One of Ipswich Town&#x27;s nicknames is &quot;The Blues&quot;, stemming from their traditional kit. The club&#x27;s first registered colours were blue and white striped shirts with black shorts. All-blue shirts and white shorts were first worn in the 1936–37 season, following the clubs entry into the Southern Football League after turning professional. These have stood as the primary colours of the club&#x27;s home kits ever since.

Since turning professional, Ipswich have used a number of away colours, including white, orange, red and black vertical stripes, claret and green, cream and black vertical stripes and dark blue and claret. In 2006, the club donated 500 orange and blue-and-white shirts to children in Iraq.

=== Kit suppliers and sponsors ===
In 1981, Ipswich Town announced a sponsorship deal with Japanese-based electronics company Pioneer Corporation, who became the first official sponsors of the club. Pioneer Corporation also sponsored the west stand of the club&#x27;s Portman Road stadium up until 1999, formerly known as the West Stand. Pioneer would continue to sponsor the club&#x27;s kits until 1985, when a new sponsorship deal was agreed with local Suffolk radio station Radio Orwell. The radio station would only sponsor the club&#x27;s kits for a single season before being replaced with pharmaceutical and horticultural chemical manufacturers Fisons. Fisons were the main sponsors of the club from the 1986–87 season through to the 1994–95 season, including the 1991–92 season when the club won the Second Division championship and gained promotion to the inaugural season of the newly founded Premier League.

Since then Ipswich have had multiple kit sponsors, including Suffolk-based brewing company Greene King from 1995 to 2001, and the energy companies TXU Energi (2001–2003), Powergen (2003–2006) and E.ON (2006–2008). After the club&#x27;s takeover by Marcus Evans in 2007, Marcus Evans Group became the club&#x27;s new primary sponsor and would go on to be the football club&#x27;s main sponsor from 2008 until 2018. In January 2018, the club agreed a new three year sponsorship deal worth almost £2 million with British online casino company Magical Vegas. In May 2020, Magical Vegas revealed that they had donated the final year of their shirt sponsor rights to The Carers Trust charity for the 2020–21 season. On 6 May 2021, the club announced that popular artist and longtime Ipswich fan Ed Sheeran would be the club&#x27;s new shirt sponsor for the 2021–22 season, a deal which was later extended to cover until the end of the 2023–24 season. On 14 June 2022, Ipswich announced that the club had signed a 4-year contract with Umbro to become the new kit manufacturers for both the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s teams, marking the first time since 1995 that Ipswich&#x27;s kits were made by Umbro.
== Stadium ==

Between 1878 and 1884, Ipswich Town played at two grounds in the town, Broomhill and Brook&#x27;s Hall, but in 1884, the club moved to Portman Road and have played there ever since. At their new home, Ipswich became one of the first clubs to implement the use of goal nets, in 1890, but the more substantial elements of ground development did not begin until, in 1901, a tobacco processing plant was built along the south edge of the ground. The first stand, a wooden structure, was built on the Portman Road side of the pitch in 1905. In 1911 the roof was blown off, and the ground was later commandeered by the British Army for the duration of World War I. The club turned professional in 1936, and work began on the first bank of terracing at the north end of the pitch. The following year, on the back of winning the Southern League, a similar terrace was built at the southern &#x27;Churchmans&#x27; end.

All sides were terraced by 1954, and floodlights were erected in 1959 for use in lower light conditions. The two-tier Portman Stand was built along the east side of the ground in place of the existing terraces in 1971, and the West Stand was extended in 1982 by the addition of a third tier. The rebuilt West Stand was renamed the Pioneer Stand as a result of the club&#x27;s sponsorship by the electronics company Pioneer Corporation and was converted to all-seating in 1990. In 1992, following the recommendations of the Taylor Report in the wake of the Hillsborough disaster three years earlier, the terraces in both the north and south stands were also converted to all-seating, creating the first complete all-seater stadium in the top flight of English football - post Taylor Report (Highfield Road was previously all-seater in the early 1980s), with a spectator capacity of 22,600.

Success that took place on the pitch led to further investment in the infrastructure, with the club spending over £22 million on redeveloping both North and South stands, resulting in a current capacity of 30,311, making it the largest-capacity football stadium in East Anglia. In the past ten years, statues of both Sir Alf Ramsey and Sir Bobby Robson have been unveiled outside the stadium. The North Stand was renamed in honour of former manager Sir Bobby Robson in September 2009. On 31 March 2012, in conjunction with celebrations of the 50th anniversary of Ipswich Town winning the First Division, the South Stand was renamed in honour of Ipswich and England&#x27;s former manager Alf Ramsey. Portman Road now features two stands named after their two most successful managers in the club&#x27;s history, as well as being England&#x27;s two most successful managers. On 10 July 2012, the West Stand, formerly known as the &quot;Pioneer Stand&quot; and the &quot;Britannia Stand&quot;, was renamed the &quot;East of England Co-operative Stand&quot; following a sponsorship deal with the East of England Co-operative Society. The Co-op&#x27;s sponsorship lasted until 2021, when it was not renewed and returned to be simply the West Stand. The East Stand of Portman Road, formerly known as the &quot;Portman Stand&quot;, is called the &quot;Cobbold Stand&quot;, named after the former owners of the club. The playing surface at Portman Road is highly regarded and has been voted best pitch in the league on a number of occasions. The former groundsman, Alan Ferguson, received a number of accolades, including both Premiership and Championship Groundsman of the Year. The stadium has also hosted many England youth international matches, and one senior England friendly international match, against Croatia in 2003.

== Supporters ==
A recent nickname for Town is &quot;The Tractor Boys&quot;, which was coined during the club&#x27;s brief period in the Premier League from 2000–01 to 2001–02, when the team regularly competed against more fashionable clubs. The nickname is an example of self-deprecating humour referring to Suffolk&#x27;s agricultural heritage. The origins of the nickname are not certain, but the first generally accepted use of the nickname was created whilst playing at Leeds United in 2000–2001: Ipswich were winning the game 2–1 and the Leeds fans started chanting, &quot;We&#x27;re being beaten by a bunch of tractor drivers&quot;. Barracking by supporters of more established Premiership clubs during Town&#x27;s spell in the Premiership lent the ironic chant &quot;1–0 to the Tractor Boys&quot; increased potency and publicity, and the nickname is commonly used by the media. Former Town manager Jim Magilton commented in the local press that he disliked the nickname and said that it conjured up &quot;images of carrot-crunching yokels&quot;, while players such as Matt Holland accepted the chant with good humour.

Ipswich have a global fan base, with the official Ipswich Town Supporters Club having supporters branches across the world. The club has a particularly strong affiliation with German club Fortuna Düsseldorf, with Fortuna fans making an annual visit to Portman Road since 2006. Ipswich fans also organise visits to the Merkur Spiel-Arena in Düsseldorf to support Fortuna at their home matches. The two clubs organised two pre-season friendlies in Düsseldorf in 2015 and in Ipswich in 2024.

=== Rivalries ===
The club&#x27;s main rivals are Norwich City. When the two teams meet it is known as the East Anglian derby, or, informally, as the &quot;Old Farm derby&quot;, a comic reference to the &quot;Old Firm Derby&quot; played between Scottish teams Celtic and Rangers and the prominence of agriculture in East Anglia. The series began in the early 20th century, when both clubs were amateur organisations. The first derby was held between the two clubs on 15 November 1902, with the first derby between the two professional clubs taking place in 1939. Locally, much is made of the informal title &quot;Pride of Anglia&quot;. Fans claim the title for either winning the East Anglian Derby, finishing highest in the league, having the better current league position and having the more successful club history.

== Records and statistics ==
Mick Mills holds the record for Ipswich league appearances, having played 741 first-team matches between 1966 and 1982. The club&#x27;s top league goalscorer is Ray Crawford, who scored 203 goals between 1958 and 1969, while Ted Phillips holds the record for the most league goals scored in a season, 41 in the 1956–57 season in Third Division South. Allan Hunter won the most international caps whilst a player at the club, making 47 appearances for Northern Ireland during his time at Ipswich.

The club&#x27;s widest victory margins in the league have been their 7–0 wins against Portsmouth in the Second Division in 1964, against Southampton in the First Division in 1974 and against West Bromwich Albion in the First Division in 1976. Their heaviest defeats in the league were 10–1 against Fulham in 1963 and 9–0 against Manchester United in 1995.

Ipswich&#x27;s record home attendance is 38,010 for a sixth round FA Cup match against Leeds United on 8 March 1975. With the introduction of regulations enforcing all-seater stadiums, it is unlikely that this record will be beaten in the foreseeable future.

The highest transfer fee received for an Ipswich player is £8.1 million as part of a deal worth in excess of £12 million from Sunderland for Connor Wickham in June 2011, while the most spent by the club on a player was £20 million for Omari Hutchinson from Chelsea in June 2024, following the club&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League.

Bobby Robson is the club&#x27;s longest serving manager in terms of games managed, managing Ipswich for 709 matches between 1969 and 1982. Scott Duncan is the club&#x27;s longest serving manager in terms of time spent as manager at the club, managing the club for 6,487 days between 1937 and 1955.

Ipswich still maintain an undefeated home record in European competition. This record began in 1962, when the club first qualified for the European Cup. For 45 years, Ipswich held the record for the longest unbeaten run of games at home in European competition, with a run of 31 home matches undefeated but, due to the team&#x27;s absence from such tournaments in recent years, this record was broken by Dutch club AZ Alkmaar.

=== Under-21s and Academy ===

Ipswich currently runs a Category Two Academy, with a five-year plan to improve to Category One. The academy is run by Bryan Klug. The academy was particularly successful in the 1990s, producing a number of first-team players including Kieron Dyer, Richard Wright and Titus Bramble. In more recent years, the academy has produced more young players going onto the main team including Connor Wickham, Jordan Rhodes, Luke Woolfenden, Flynn Downes and Andre Dozzell, who like his father Jason Dozzell, scored on his debut at the age of 16.

=== Player of the Year ===

Towards the end of each season, a player is voted as the &#x27;Player of the Year&#x27; by the club&#x27;s fans.

=== Hall of Fame ===

In 2007, the club created a hall of fame into which a number of personnel associated with the club are inducted every year. The inaugural members, Ray Crawford, Mick Mills, Ted Phillips and John Wark, were selected in 2007 by a ballot of former Ipswich players.

<text>The Palace of the Parliament (), also known as the House of the Republic () or People&#x27;s House/People&#x27;s Palace (), is the seat of the Parliament of Romania, located atop Dealul Spirii in Bucharest, the national capital. The Palace reaches a height of , has a floor area of and a volume of . The Palace of the Parliament is the heaviest building in the world, weighing about , and is the third largest administrative building in the world.

The building was designed and supervised by chief architect Anca Petrescu, with a team of approximately 700 architects, and constructed over a period of 13 years (1984–1997) in modernist Neoclassical architectural forms and styles, with socialist realism in mind. The Palace was ordered by Nicolae Ceaușescu (1918–1989), the president of Communist Romania and the second of two long-ruling heads of state in the country since World War II, during a period in which the personality cult of political worship and adoration increased considerably for him and his family.

Known for its ornate interior composed of 23 sections, the palace houses the two chambers of the Parliament of Romania: the Senate () and the Chamber of Deputies (), along with three museums and an international conference center. The museums in the Palace are the National Museum of Contemporary Art, the Museum of Communist Totalitarianism (established in 2015) and the Museum of the Palace. Though originally named the House of the Republic when under construction, the palace became widely known as The People&#x27;s House after the Romanian Revolution of December 1989. Due to its impressive characteristics, events organized by state institutions and international bodies such as conferences and symposia take place there, but despite this about 70% of the building remains empty.

, the Palace of the Parliament is valued at €4 billion, making it the most expensive administrative building in the world. The cost of heating and electricity alone exceeds $6 million per year.

The old Palace of the Chamber of Deputies is now the Palace of the Patriarchate.

== Location ==
The Palace is in Sector 5 in the central part of Bucharest, at the top of Dealul Spirii (Spirea&#x27;s Hill), also known as Dealul Arsenalului (Arsenal Hill). It is at the west end of the Bulevardul Unirii (Union Boulevard), constructed at the same time as the Palace, and is ringed by Izvor Street to the west and northwest, United Nations Avenue to the north, Liberty Avenue to the east and Calea 13 Septembrie to the south.

== History ==


The construction of the Palace of the Parliament was the most extreme expression of the systematization program imposed on Romania by Nicolae Ceaușescu. Systematization was a program of urban planning carried out by Ceaușescu, who was impressed by the societal organization and mass adulation he saw in North Korea&#x27;s Juche ideology during his East Asia visit in 1971. Ceaușescu decided to implement similar policies in his country, with the stated goal of turning Romania into a &quot;multilaterally developed socialist society.&quot;

A systematization project existed since the 1930s (during the time of King Carol II) for the Unirii–Dealul Arsenalului area. The Vrancea earthquake of 4 March 1977 gave Ceaușescu a pretext to demolish parts of old Bucharest. He wanted a civic center more in line with the country&#x27;s political stance and started a reconstruction plan of Bucharest based on the socialist realism style. The House of the Republic was the centrepiece of Ceaușescu&#x27;s project. Named &quot;Project Bucharest&quot;, it began in 1978 as an intended replica of the North Korean capital, Pyongyang. North Korean President Kim Il Sung had started construction on a similarly monumental residence, the Kumsusan Palace, two years earlier.

A contest was held and won by Anca Petrescu (1949–2013), who was appointed chief architect of the project at the age of 28. The team that coordinated the work was made up of 10 assisting architects, which supervised a further 700. Construction of the palace began on 25 June 1984, and the inauguration of the work was attended by Ceaușescu, who also frequently inspected the site.

Uranus Hill was leveled, and the Uranus-Izvor neighborhood was destroyed so the building could be erected. The area had also been home to the National Archives, Mihai Vodă Monastery and other monasteries, Brâncovenesc Hospital, as well as about 37 old factories and workshops. Demolition in the Uranus area began in 1982. Approximately of the old city centre were demolished, with 40,000 people being relocated from the area.

The works were carried out with forced labour in addition to soldiers, minimizing costs.

Between 20,000 and 100,000 people worked on the site and project, operating in three shifts made up of 5,000 Romanian People&#x27;s Army soldiers and huge numbers of &quot;volunteers&quot;. The number of deaths that occurred during construction is a matter of controversy, the official data suggests 27 but workers involved in the construction of the building talk of a much higher number, some say thousands.

During the 1980s, the Romanian government implemented a crippling austerity policy to pay the foreign debt.
In 1989, the building costs were estimated at US$1.75 billion, and in 2006 at US$3 billion. In 1990, Australian-born business and media magnate Rupert Murdoch tried to buy the building for US$1 billion, but his bid was rejected.

=== After 1989 ===
Since 1994, the palace has housed the lower house of the Romanian Parliament, the Chamber of Deputies, after its former seat, the Palace of the Chamber of Deputies (now the Palace of the Patriarchate), was donated by the state to the Romanian Orthodox Church. Since 2004, the upper house, the Senate of Romania, has also been housed in the Palace of the Parliament, after having left the former headquarters of the Central Committee of the Romanian Communist Party.

Six years after the palace&#x27;s completion, between 2003 and 2004, a glass annex was built alongside the external elevators. This was done to facilitate outside access to the National Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in 2004 in the west wing of the palace. During the same period, a project aiming to hoist a huge flag was cancelled following public protests. A flag already hoisted outside the building was also removed after the protests.

A restaurant inside the palace, accessible only to politicians, was refurbished. Since 1998, the building has also housed an office for the Regional Southeast European Cooperative Initiative (SECI) Centre for Fighting Transborder Crime.

In 2008, the Palace hosted the 20th summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. In 2010, politician Silviu Prigoană proposed re-purposing the building into a shopping centre and entertainment complex. Citing costs, Prigoană said that the Romanian Parliament should move to a new building, since they occupied only 30% of the massive palace. While the proposal sparked debate in Romania, politician Miron Mitrea dismissed the idea as a &quot;joke&quot;.

The palace has also been the background for several motorsports events, including the 2011 Drift Grand Prix Romania, which brought together professional drifters from all over Europe.

==== Copyrights over the building&#x27;s image ====
Although the Palace of the Parliament was financed from public funds and the architects did work for hire, after the death of chief architect Anca Petrescu, her heirs sued the Chamber of Deputies for using images of the iconic building without authorization. The chamber was accused of copyright infringement for selling photos and souvenirs depicting the building&#x27;s image. In other lawsuits, the heirs claimed violation of trademarks owned by the chief architect through the depiction of the palace from different angles.

While legal experts state that no restrictions exist for tourists wishing to photograph the iconic building for non-commercial purposes, Petrescu&#x27;s heirs have clearly set out that any commercial use of the building&#x27;s image is subject to a 2% royalty fee. It is believed the situation could have been avoided if an agreement between the chief architect and the beneficiary (the Romanian state) had addressed the intellectual property rights and Romania had implemented freedom of panorama, restricting the scope of copyright law in such cases.

== Technical details ==
Construction of the palace began in 1984 and was initially scheduled for completion in two years. The project was extended to 1990, but in 2013 it was reported that only 400 rooms and two large meeting rooms were finished and being used, out of a total of 1,100 rooms.

The building has eight underground levels, the deepest housing a nuclear bunker, linked to main state institutions by of tunnels. Nicolae Ceaușescu feared nuclear war. The bunker is a room with concrete walls said to be impervious to radiation. The shelter is composed of a main hall – headquarters which would have had telephone connections with all military units in Romania – and several residential apartments for state leadership, to be used in the event of war.

The palace&#x27;s floor area of makes it the world&#x27;s third-largest administrative building after the Pentagon outside of Washington, D.C. in the United States and the Sappaya-Sapasathan in Thailand. It is also among the most massive buildings in terms of volume, measuring : for comparison, the building exceeds by 2% the volume of the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, leading some sources to label it &quot;pharaonic&quot;.

The Palace of the Parliament sinks each year due to its weight. Romanian specialists who have analyzed the data have explained that the palace&#x27;s massive weight is causing the layers of sediment below the building to settle.

=== Materials ===
The building was constructed almost entirely of materials of Romanian origin. Among the few exceptions are the doors of Nicolae Bălcescu Hall, received by Ceaușescu as a gift from his friend Mobutu Sese Seko, longtime totalitarian President of Zaire (today the Democratic Republic of the Congo).

Among the materials are 3,500 tonnes of crystal – 480 chandeliers, 1,409 ceiling lights and mirrors were manufactured; 700,000 tonnes of steel and bronze for monumental doors and windows, chandeliers and capitals; of marble, of wood (over 95% domestic) for parquet and wainscotting, including walnut, oak, sweet cherry, elm, sycamore maple; of woollen carpets of various dimensions (machines had to be moved inside the building to weave some of the larger carpets); velvet and brocade curtains adorned with embroideries and passementeries in silver and gold.

== In popular culture ==
The Palace of the Parliament has featured in a variety of films, most famously as the Vatican in the 2018 horror film &quot;The Nun&quot;. Other films include &quot;War Dogs&quot;, starring Jonah Hill; &quot;Dying of the Light&quot;, starring Nicolas Cage; and &quot;What About Love&quot; (2022), starring Sharon Stone and Andy García.

It also appeared on an episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot; in 2009, titled &quot;Romanian GT Road Trip to Find the Transfagarasan Highway&quot;.

<text>Soyuz 23 (, &quot;Union 23&quot;) was an October 1976, Soviet crewed space flight, the second to the Salyut 5 space station. Cosmonauts Vyacheslav Zudov and Valery Rozhdestvensky arrived at the station, but an equipment malfunction did not allow docking and the mission had to be aborted.

The crew returned to Earth, but landed on partially frozen Lake Tengiz, the first crewed splashdown in the Soviet space program. While there was no concern about any immediate threat to the crew, the capsule sank under the surface of the frozen lake, and recovery took nine hours owing to fog and other adverse conditions. The landing marked the only example of an unintentional splashdown of a crewed spacecraft as of November 2024.

== Mission highlights ==
Soyuz 23 was launched 14 October 1976 with an estimated 73- to 85-day mission planned aboard the orbiting Salyut 5 space station. Other sources suggest a 17- to 24-day mission was a more likely intention. It was the first visit to the station after the sudden termination of the Soyuz 21 mission in August 1976. However, on 15 October 1976, during the automatic approach phase, the automatic docking system malfunctioned before the craft was within 100 metres of the station. Crews were trained for a manual dock, but not for a manual approach. The mission, accordingly, had to be abandoned.

The craft had only two days of battery power, so systems were powered off, including the radio, to conserve power. The day&#x27;s landing opportunity had already passed, so they had to wait for the next day&#x27;s landing opportunity near the Baikonur Cosmodrome. On 16 October 1976, Soyuz 23 returned to Earth and landed at 17:45:53 UTC, but weather conditions were poor and the cosmonauts experienced an unusual recovery. They landed on a freezing Lake Tengiz (average depth 2.5 m, max depth 6.7 m), at 8 km from shore, in the middle of a blizzard, with fog and temperatures at −22 °C. It was the first water landing by a Soviet crew. The capsule was designed to land in any conditions, even in a body of water, so the only concern was the increased difficulty in finding the capsule and crew.

The parachute quickly sank beneath water and dragged the capsule and its crew beneath the surface; in addition an electrical short caused by the water impact caused the reserve parachute to accidentally deploy. The capsule cooled in the freezing water, and the cosmonauts removed their pressure suits and donned their normal flight suits, expecting a quick rescue. The parachutes became waterlogged and pulled the capsule onto its side, preventing the hatch from being opened. The transmission antennas were also under water, so the crew could not communicate with rescue teams. The capsule&#x27;s beacons could not be seen in the heavy fog, and rubber rafts used to try to reach them were blocked by ice and sludge. Amphibious vehicles were airlifted to the vicinity, but could not reach the capsule owing to bogs surrounding the lake. Accordingly, the rescue was called off until dawn. The cosmonauts were safe, but they were low on power, so they were forced to shut down everything but a small interior light.

The next morning, frogmen were dropped in by helicopters and attached flotation devices to the Soyuz craft. The capsule was too heavy to be lifted by the helicopter, so it was dragged to shore. The recovery operation had taken nine hours. No attempt was made to open the hatch as the recovery crews assumed the cosmonauts were dead, so they called for a special team to remove their bodies. Eventually, eleven hours after splashdown, the capsule was opened, and the crew was found unconsious due to CO2 accumulation in the submerged and powered down vessel. The cosmonauts were rescued, if badly chilled (the interior of the descent module was coated with frost).

Press releases by Soviet news agency TASS announced that there had been a water landing and that the cosmonauts were recovered safely, but made no mention of the rescue operation involved and the details of it were not revealed until the era of glasnost a decade later.

<doc id="352851" wikidata="Q845900" url="?curid=352851" title="Start-stop system">
<text>A vehicle start-stop system or stop-start system (also known as S&amp;S, micro hybrid, or micro hybrid electric vehicle (μHEV)) automatically shuts down and restarts the internal combustion engine to reduce the amount of time the engine spends idling, thereby reducing fuel consumption and emissions. This is most advantageous for vehicles that spend significant amounts of time waiting at traffic lights or frequently come to a stop in traffic jams. Start-stop technology may become more common with more stringent government fuel economy and emissions regulations. This feature is present in hybrid electric vehicles, but has also appeared in vehicles that lack a hybrid electric powertrain. For non-electric vehicles, fuel economy gains from this technology are typically in the range of 3–10%, potentially as high as 12%. In the United States, according to the Department of Energy, idling wastes more than of fuel per year.

In a manual transmission vehicle, stop-start is activated by stopping the car, shifting the gear to neutral, and releasing the clutch. The engine will not stop if the car is moving, even if the aforementioned steps are followed (this is not true for all cars). The engine restarts when the clutch is pressed prior to selecting a gear to move the car. The engine may also restart if there is a demand for power from, for example, the air conditioning system.

Since automobile accessories like compressors and water pumps have typically been designed to run on a serpentine belt on the engine, those systems must be redesigned to function properly when the engine is turned off. Typically, an electric motor is used to power these devices instead. In vehicles where the air conditioner compressor still runs from the drive belt, some drivers turn on the air conditioner as an improvised way to disable start-stop. In the Mazda 3, a supercapacitor is used to power the air conditioner and other accessories as part of the i-ELOOP system; the air conditioner and fans are lowered significantly to minimum settings when the engine is off. With the air conditioning and fan at maximum settings, the supercapacitor will be drained in five seconds, and the engine will automatically turn on.

This technology has also been used on Honda scooters in Asian markets for the last decade. Honda&#x27;s PCX 125 cc model was released in 2010 with this technology for the European market, though its North American model does not feature it.

== Characteristics ==
Start-stop technology was introduced in Europe first because of regulatory differences: 25 percent of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) is spent idling, while only an estimated 11 percent of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) test is spent idling. Start-stop activation depends on specific driver inputs as well as operating conditions. The engine must have reached the proper temperature to ensure adequate light-off of its catalytic converter and proper lubrication for an effortless restart.

In a car with a manual transmission, engine shutdown typically occurs when braking to a complete stop, shifting the gearbox to neutral, and releasing the clutch. Cars with automatic transmissions shut down upon braking to a full stop; the shutdown is activated by pressing the foot brake pedal when the car comes to a halt. If the car is slowed initially by manual use of the automatic gearbox and final stoppage is achieved by using the handbrake, the engine will not shut down.

== Enhanced components ==
The system needs to be implemented in conjunction with modifications and reinforcements on many of the car&#x27;s components in order to reinforce the engine and electrical system durability and long-term wear resistance, as added stopping and starting cycles impose increased loads on those systems. To accomplish similar levels of durability, comfort and user experience to that of older cars without the system, the car&#x27;s manufacturer can include any of the following enhancements in the car&#x27;s industrial design:

* The engine main (crankshaft) bearings are coated with special polymers that have properties of dry lubricants, such as polyamide. This aids the lack of the motor oil film and hydrodynamic lubrication when the crankshaft stops, preventing metal-to-metal contact that would otherwise produce accelerated wear on the bearing surfaces.
* The main battery is either absorbent glass mat (AGM) or enhanced flooded battery (EFB) technology, both supporting an increased number of charging cycles and increased load. This is important because all the car&#x27;s electrical system must be maintained by the battery after the alternator stops generating current. Often the battery will be labeled as supporting or specifically designed for start-stop.
* The starter is reinforced and designed to withstand continuous use without wearing too fast or overheating.
* An independent cooling circuit is added in conjunction with an electrical runoff water pump that keeps on running when the main mechanical pump goes out. This ensures the coolant supply to heat sensitive engine components like turbocharger bearings and to keep cabin temperature in wintertime. 
* Special sensors and engine control units (ECUs) can be added to ensure proper system running conditions, and to keep parameters between tolerance like a good battery charge, essential to guarantee future starts.

==History==
Carbon monoxide emissions and the fuel shortage/oil crisis of the 1970s pushed car manufacturers to find solutions to reduce gas consumption. The first vehicle to use the automatic on/off switch was the six-cylinder Toyota Crown in 1974 and was already claiming a 10% gas saving in traffic. In the 1980s, the Fiat Regata &quot;ES&quot; with the City-matic system and Volkswagen Polo &quot;Formel E&quot; also used similar devices. The Volkswagen Group also adopted it in the Golf &quot;Ecomatic&quot; in 1994 and in the Volkswagen Lupo &quot;3L&quot; and the Audi A2 &quot;3L&quot; in 1999. Though these early implementations were considered rather disconcerting by many drivers, and high pricing failed to yield these cars much commercial success, both the Volkswagen Lupo and the Audi A2 (in their &quot;3 litre&quot; leverage) were more efficient than any production car available in the US at the time of their release.

Since European emission standard Euro 5, more and more vehicles include a start-stop system, whatever the price level, as reducing idling also reduces vehicles&#x27; emissions of CO2, a prime cause of global warming.

Manufacturers continued to refine the system. In 2010, Valeo declared that its second Start-Stop generation would appear in the same year. This new generation would be called &quot;i-StARS&quot;.The Valeo system is included in Citroën, Land Rover, Peugeot, Smart, and Volvo, while the Bosch system is included in Fiat, Nissan, SEAT, and Volkswagen, with various motorization including essence and diesel. Bosch developed a system for automatic cars.

The Mazda Smart Idle Stop System (SISS) uses combustion start instead of electrical start. By sensing the position of the pistons in the cylinders, the engine is stopped in a configuration that allows immediate starting by combustion. Mazda claims quieter and quicker engine restart within 0.35 seconds.

The Kia ISG EcoDynamics system uses Bosch, Valeo, and Varta components.

==Manufacturers==
=== Alexander Dennis ===
Some Alexander Dennis Enviro200 MMC and Enviro400 MMC buses are equipped with stop-start systems that will stop the engine at bus stops.

===Bentley===
Stop-start technology was fitted to a Bentley for the first time in 2016 on the Bentayga model. Bentley&#x27;s system stops the engine when the car is stopped or moving slowly.

===BMW===
BMW is including the technology across many of its cars and the MINI line for 2008 as part of its Efficient Dynamics brand. BMW has been interested in ways to reduce parasitic losses on engines, so the company took the technology a step further. Instead of using an Integrated Starter Generator (ISG), BMW has used an enhanced starter which is a conventional starter, developed by Robert Bosch GmbH, that can withstand the increased number of engine-starts in a stop-start vehicle.

BMW has developed the system such that the alternator is not activated most of the time. This means that electrical components in the vehicle are normally running on battery power. When the battery needs to be charged or when decelerating or braking, the alternator is activated to recharge the battery (regenerative braking). Since this battery experiences very different load characteristics than a normal car battery, BMW used an absorptive glass mat (AGM) type instead.

Due to the use of regenerative braking, some have started calling this type of system a micro hybrid, a step below a mild hybrid system where the ISG can be used to assist the engine or even drive the vehicle.

===Citroën===

Citroën introduced a more refined system in its C2 and C3 models by 2006, named &quot;Stop and Start&quot;. The Citroën implementation combines a SensoDrive automated gearbox and an electronically controlled reversible alternator or integrated starter-generator (ISG). An ISG, also known as &quot;integrated starter-alternator&quot;, combines the role of the starter and alternator into one unit; manufacturers include Valeo and Denso.

===Fiat Chrysler Automobiles===

FCA introduced the Robert Bosch GmbH made system in the end of 2008 in the Fiat 500. Starting in September 2009, Alfa Romeo also introduced this system in its Alfa Romeo Mito series utilising Fiat Powertrain Technologies (FPT) 1.4 L Turbo petrol MultiAir engines.

===Ford===

Late in 2010, Ford announced that its start-stop system, already used in its hybrids as well as several mainstream models in Europe, would be introduced in North America with the 2012 models, initially with 4-cylinder engines and later proliferating into V6s and V8s. Eventually, the system became available in all Ford vehicles.

In 2013, it announced that start-stop technology would be brought into the second generation Ford Fusion models, and it built start-stop systems into the Ford F150 2015 model for the first time as a standard feature rather than an option. Formerly, only the 2.7-liter turbocharged V-6 version came with stop-start, which requires a more robust (and expensive) absorbent-glass-mat (AGM) battery that can better handle the constant cycling and the heavier draw from vehicle accessories with the engine off.

===General Motors===

In 2008, General Motors released its Chevrolet Tahoe hybrid model with AHS2 two-mode technology, which combines start-stop technology with regenerative braking and electric vehicle mode in certain conditions under 29 mph.

In 2012, General Motors released its Chevrolet Malibu Eco model with eAssist technology, which combines start-stop technology with regenerative braking and electric boost in certain conditions.

In 2014, General Motors announced that the Chevrolet Impala and Malibu would have a (non-eAssist) start-stop system across all models.

===Honda===

Honda has been using the start-stop function for over a decade via its IMA mild hybrid system in first-generation Insight models in the Japanese domestic market since 1999 and more recently on the Civic Hybrid.

===Hyundai===

While both the Kia Rio and Rio5 share the same new direct-injected four-cylinder 1.6 L engine with its cousin Hyundai Accent/Verna (also newly redesigned for 2012), Hyundai made no mention of this feature in their Accent line. Hyundai 1.4 manual has the ISG (Intelligent Stop &amp; Go) system (in Israel).

===Jaguar===

Jaguar&#x27;s &quot;Intelligent Eco Stop/Start&quot; was first fitted to the XF and XJ models in 2011 before expanding to the rest of the range.

===Kia===

The redesigned 2012 Kia Rio and Rio5 (hatchback) debuted at the 2011 New York Auto Show was announced with their Intelligent Stop and Go (ISG) feature, or stop-start technology.

Kia claims the combination of direct fuel injection and stop-start will offer 30 mpg for city driving and 40 mpg on the highway in both 6 speed manual and automatic transmissions.

===Land Rover===

In 2008, Land Rover fitted its Freelander with Stop/Start which could reduce fuel consumption and emissions by up to 10%. As of 2016 all Land Rover and Range Rover models are fitted with &quot;Intelligent Eco Stop/Start&quot;.

===Mahindra &amp; Mahindra===

Mahindras were the first in India to launch stop-start based Micro Hybrid system in May 2000. This involved home-grown technology and first of its kind component development like Hall sensor based neutral and clutch pedal sensors, and later a joint venture with Bosch for common rail based vehicles.

===Mazda===

The i-Stop system, Mazda&#x27;s first start stop system, detects which piston is in the best position to restart quickest, which is the one in the combustion stroke phase, where air and fuel are in the cylinder, ready to be ignited. The mixture in this cylinder is ignited by the spark plug, forcing that piston down, and with assistance from the starter motor, results in a near instantaneous engine restart time of 0.35 seconds.

In 2011, Mazda announced i-ELOOP, a system which uses a variable-voltage alternator to convert kinetic energy to electric power during deceleration. The energy stored in a double-layer capacitor, is used to supply power needed by vehicle electrical systems. When used in conjunction with Mazda&#x27;s start-stop system, i-Stop, the company claims fuel savings of up to 10%.

===Nissan===
Nissan uses the &quot;S-Hybrid&quot; (stylized in all caps as &quot;S-HYBRID&quot;) brand for their micro hybrid system. The S-Hybrid system is entirely contained within the engine compartment and does not require a traction battery. Vehicles with the S-Hybrid system are equipped with an &quot;Energy Control&quot; (ECO) motor, which serves as the gasoline engine&#x27;s alternator and starter motor. These vehicles are also equipped with an additional &quot;sub-battery&quot; located in the engine compartment to power the vehicle&#x27;s electric accessories when the gasoline engine has shut down, instead of using a constantly-driven alternator. When the driver lifts off the throttle or brakes, the ECO motor is driven as an alternator to maintain &quot;sub-battery&quot; charge. In addition to being used to restart the engine, the ECO motor also applies of torque for one second to the crankshaft when driving away from a stop, providing a small amount of electric motor assist.

===Opel/Vauxhall===

In 2010, Opel introduced Start/stop in their &quot;EcoFLEX&quot; branded models. The system is used with Family 0, Ecotec and MGE petrol and MultiJet, Circle L, and Family B diesel engines.
===Perodua===

Perodua first introduced the start/stop system in 2016 which is called &quot;Eco idle&quot; in the Bezza. Initially, it was only limited to the range-topping Advance variant. Subsequently, newer models such as the Myvi, Aruz, Ativa, and Alza started to feature this system as standard, even on base models.

===Renault===

Renault introduced the technology in all of its European models in 2010.

===Roewe===

In 2009, Roewe&#x27;s Rover 75 based 750 was fitted with stop-start as standard with the hybrid 1.8 Rover K-series engine.

===SAAB===
A start-stop function was fitted to the second-generation 9-5 in 2009. The button to control the system was placed next to the gearshift like SAAB ignition keys of old.

===Subaru===
Many Subaru vehicles have been equipped with an automatic stop-start system. It was first launched in 2011 for the Impreza and Crosstrek.

===Suzuki===

Suzuki&#x27;s start-stop system is called EASS (Engine Auto Start Stop).

Some car makers such as Suzuki have one additional small 12V lithium-ion battery inside the car. The system is marketed as &quot;SHVS Mild Hybrid System&quot; (Smart Hybrid Vehicle by Suzuki) and available as an option in Ignis, Swift, Baleno in several markets.

===Tata===

Tata Motors introduced this system on its LCV Tata Ace.

===Toyota===
Toyota showed a prototype of its six-cylinder Toyota Crown equipped with an automatic on/off switch in 1974, claiming a 10-percent gas saving in traffic.

More recently, Toyota has been selling cars with start-stop system on their internal combustion engine vehicles since 2009, and since 1997 in their Prius hybrid line. Both Toyota and Mazda introduced stop-start technology, available also outside of Japan, in some of their 2009 model year vehicles.

===Volkswagen===

Volkswagen began using start-stop systems with the Polo Formel E with SSA around 1983, after having previewed the system on the 1981 Auto 2000 research car. Later the LUPO 3L, and after that in the Polo, Golf and Passat BlueMotion, which also include weight and aerodynamic improvements. The system is now commonplace in the Volkswagen range, fitted to all vehicles with the Bluemotion Technology package, though certain other models have the technology too. For the Lupo 3L, with an automated manual gearbox and clutch, the engine stops four seconds after the car becomes stationary with the driver&#x27;s foot on the brake pedal. No other action is necessary. Removing the foot from the brake pedal initiates engine start and the car can be driven away. The gear lever remains in the drive D position throughout. The same applies to the Audi A2 1.2TDi, which is almost identical mechanically.

===Volvo===

Volvo introduced its start-stop technology in 2009 under their DRIVe branding.

===Mitsubishi===
Mitsubishi Motors introduced this system in 1999 under its AS&amp;G (Auto Stop &amp; Go) branding, on their kei-car Mitsubishi Pistachio. Mitsubishi has been marketing AS&amp;G Technology in its ClearTec branded models in the European market since 2008. AS&amp;G system is also available on Mitsubishi Colt (EU), which went on sale in Europe in 2008. Since 2010, this system has also been used in the Mitsubishi ASX (EU). In 2015, AS&amp;G was added to the Mitsubishi Eclipse Cross.

==Concerns==
Hybrid/electric assist vehicles experience almost no delay in power from a stop, thanks to the instant availability of power from the battery to the electric motors. Gasoline and microhybrid vehicles, on the other hand, generally experience slight delays (albeit fractions of a second).

In February 2001, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) raised questions about non-hybrid Honda vehicles equipped with the company&#x27;s &quot;Idle Stop&quot; transmissions due to concerns over the &quot;sudden lurching forward of a vehicle in an automatic restart&quot; – rather than the &quot;gradual creeping forward found in current transmission designs&quot;.

A common issue of stop-start systems is that long-term use may induce additional wear due to lack of oil lubrication. For the crankshaft bearing half shells and the big end bearings this can translate into frequent high-speed rotary movement before a hydrodynamic film is established. During this phase of boundary lubrication, metal-to-metal contact can occur between the crankshaft surface and the bearing&#x27;s sliding surface. This was not an issue while the number of engine restarts totaled what was generally understood to be a normal magnitude. However, in a vehicle with a start-stop system this effect can necessitate new technological solutions to avoid premature bearing wear, depending on the driving cycle. Consequently, future engines for start-stop applications need to be designed for 250,000 to 300,000 starts. Traditional bearing shells with aluminum or copper lining show severe wear after only 100,000 cycles.

Some implementations do not use a starter motor, eliminating concerns of starter motor wear. The Mazda i-stop used in the Mazda3/Axela line (in Europe and JDM) uses combustion to assist the starter motor by sensing the position of the piston in the cylinder. They claim quieter and quicker engine restart within 0.35 seconds.

Some car makers such as Suzuki have one lithium-ion battery inside the car.

Many vehicle consumers have expressed frustration over what they perceive as government overreach, inconvenience, and annoyance regarding the required auto stop-start feature. Additionally, the auto stop-start button defaults to the &quot;on&quot; position each time the vehicle is started, instead of defaulting to the &quot;off&quot; position, which would allow the consumer to choose whether to activate the feature. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) currently offers gas mileage rating incentives to car manufacturers who ensure their auto stop-start systems default to the &quot;on&quot; position. If the system is &quot;non-latching&quot; (i.e., it does not stay off after the car is switched off), the EPA only calculates fuel economy figures when the system is engaged. If the car manufacturer allows the system to be permanently disabled, then the EPA tests the fuel economy with the system both on and off, then averages the two fuel economy figures. Since that average will always be lower than the economy with the system engaged, car manufacturers choose to switch it back on when the vehicle is restarted. As a result, to turn off the auto stop-start feature, vehicle operators are forced by both the government and car manufacturers to press the auto stop-start button every time they start the vehicle. This inconvenience leads many consumers to either live with the hassle of pressing the button each time they start their car, search for aftermarket workarounds, or avoid vehicle models with the feature altogether.

<text>The title of Lord President of the Supreme Court was formerly the title of the head of the judiciary in Malaysia, until 1994 when the office was renamed &quot;Chief Justice of the Federal Court&quot;.

The lord president was head of the highest court in Malaysia after the abolition of appeals from Malaysia to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in 1985. Below him were the chief justices of the High Courts of Malaya and Borneo (and, until 1969, Singapore: see Law of Singapore).

==History==

===Origins===

The office of Lord President of the Federal Court was created with the formation of Malaysia in 1963. The first Lord President of the Federal Court was &quot;Tun&quot; Sir James Thomson, previously Chief Justice of Malaya, and a Scotsman. It is after the Scottish office of Lord President of the Court of Session that the office was named.

When the right of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was abolished in 1985, the Federal Court was renamed the Supreme Court and the title was changed accordingly.

===The 1988 constitutional crisis===

In 1988, Lord President &quot;Tun&quot; Salleh Abas was brought before a tribunal convened by the Prime Minister Dr Mahathir Mohamad on the grounds of misconduct. The Supreme Court in the years leading up to 1988 had been fiercely independent and increasingly active, and was at the time due to hear an appeal to determine the future of the ruling party UMNO, which had been declared an illegal society by the High Court of Malaya on the grounds of procedural irregularity. As a result of criticisms of the judiciary made by the Prime Minister, a letter of protest was written by &quot;Tun&quot; Salleh to the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on behalf of the judiciary. This letter was later used as grounds for the convening of the tribunal.

When the Supreme Court granted an injunction prohibiting the tribunal as constituted from hearing the misconduct allegations, five Supreme Court Justices were suspended (and two were subsequently removed), and the injunction overturned. The tribunal later removed &quot;Tun&quot; Salleh Abas from the office of Lord President, in which office he was succeeded by the then-Chief Justice of Malaya, &quot;Tun&quot; Hamid Omar, who had been the chairman of the tribunal.

The 1988 constitutional crisis was widely considered to be the greatest blow to judicial independence in Malaysian history, and at the time led to the Bar Council of Malaysia refusing to recognise the new Lord President. Around the same time, the Federal Constitution was amended to divest the courts of the &quot;judicial power of the Federation&quot;, granting them instead such judicial powers as the Parliament of Malaysia might grant them.

===Renaming of the office===

In 1994, in a move regarded as a further downgrading of the judiciary, the office of Lord President was renamed &quot;Chief Justice of the Federal Court&quot;, and the offices of Chief Justices of the High Courts in Malaya and in Borneo renamed &quot;Chief Judge of the High Court in Malaya&quot; and &quot;Chief Judge of the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak&quot; respectively. The Supreme Court reverted to the name of Federal Court.

<doc id="352874" wikidata="Q27442" url="?curid=352874" title="European pied flycatcher">
<text>The European pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca) is a small passerine bird in the Old World flycatcher family. One of the four species of Western Palearctic black-and-white flycatchers, it hybridizes to a limited extent with the collared flycatcher. It breeds in most of Europe and across the Western Palearctic. It is migratory, wintering mainly in tropical Africa. It usually builds its nests in holes on oak trees.
This species practices polygyny, usually bigamy, with the male travelling large distances to acquire a second mate. The male will mate with the secondary female and then return to the primary female in order to help with aspects of child rearing, such as feeding.

The European pied flycatcher is mainly insectivorous, although its diet also includes other arthropods. This species commonly feeds on spiders, ants, bees and similar prey.

The European pied flycatcher has a very large range and population size and so it is of least concern according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Taxonomy==
The European pied flycatcher is an Old World flycatcher, part of a family of insectivorous songbirds which typically feed by darting after insects. The Latin word &quot;ficedula&quot; means &quot;small fig-eating bird&quot;. The term &quot;hypoleuca&quot; comes from two Greek roots, &quot;hupo&quot;, &quot;below&quot;, and &quot;leukos&quot;, &quot;white&quot;.

The species was described in Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot; (1746), a work that was not binomial and that is therefore unavailable nomenclaturally. Later, in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;
and the next edition of &quot;Fauna Svecica&quot; (1761), Linnaeus confused this flycatcher with the Eurasian blackcap and the whinchat. To this point, the European pied flycatcher still lacked a proper valid binominal name. The species was finally named as &quot;Motacilla hypoleuca&quot; by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764. However, he described this species anonymously in the appendix of a sales catalogue of the collection of Adriaan Vroeg, popularly known simply as the &quot;Adumbratiunculae&quot; among ornithologists. The authorship of the Adumbratiunculae would later be attributed to Pallas. Given the initial anonymity of the publication and the inferred authorship by external evidence, the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature advocates that Pallas&#x27;s name should appear enclosed in square brackets in the species&#x27; name. Thus, the correct form of the scientific name of the European pied flycatcher is &quot;Ficedula hypoleuca&quot; ([Pallas], 1764).

&quot;Ficedula hypoleuca&quot; currently has three recognized subspecies: the nominate &quot;F. h. hypoleuca&quot; ([Pallas], 1764), &quot;F. h. iberiae&quot; (Witherby, 1928), and &quot;F. h. tomensis&quot; (Johansen, 1916). The subspecies &quot;F. h. muscipeta&quot; (Bechstein, 1792) is currently considered synonymous with &quot;F. h. hypoleuca&quot;, but could represent an actual distinct subspecies. The name &quot;F. h. atricapilla&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) is a junior subjective synonym of &quot;F. h. hypoleuca&quot;; and the name &quot;F. h. sibirica&quot; Khakhlov, 1915 is invalid, the correct form being &quot;F. h. tomensis&quot; (Johansen, 1916). The very similar Atlas pied flycatcher (&quot;Ficedula speculigera&quot;), of the mountains of north west Africa was formerly classed as subspecies of the European pied flycatcher.

==Description==
This is a long bird. The breeding male is mainly black above and white below, with a large white wing patch, white tail sides and a small forehead patch. The Iberian subspecies &quot;iberiae&quot; (known as Iberian pied flycatcher) has a larger forehead patch and a pale rump. Non-breeding males, females and juveniles have the black replaced by a pale brown, and may be very difficult to distinguish from other &quot;Ficedula&quot; flycatchers, particularly the collared flycatcher, with which this species hybridizes to a limited extent.

The bill is black, and has the broad but pointed shape typical of aerial insectivores. As well as taking insects in flight, this species hunts caterpillars amongst the oak foliage, and will take berries. It is therefore a much earlier spring migrant than the more aerial spotted flycatcher, and its loud rhythmic and melodious song is characteristic of oak woods in spring.
They are birds of deciduous woodlands, parks and gardens, with a preference for oak trees. They build an open nest in a tree hole, and will readily adapt to an open-fronted nest box. 4–10 eggs are laid.

==Distribution and habitat==
The European pied flycatcher has a very large range and population size, and is thus deemed to be of least concern by the IUCN. This species occupies areas of many different countries in Europe and northern Africa, also being present in the west Asian portion of Russia. More specifically, the nominate subspecies &quot;F. h. hypoleuca&quot; inhabits the UK, central Europe and Scandinavia, &quot;F. h. iberiae&quot; inhabits in the Iberian Peninsula, and &quot;F. h. tomensis&quot; in eastern Europe and Russia. The species is noted as a vagrant species in places in other countries in Africa and South Asia, such as Sudan and Afghanistan. This flycatcher typically spends winter in tropical Africa.

The European pied flycatcher is a terrestrial bird, typically inhabiting open forests, woodlands, and towns. In 2005, the European population was listed to hold 3–7 million pairs.

==Mating systems==

The European pied flycatcher predominately practices a mixed mating system of monogamy and polygyny. Their mating system has also been described as successive polygyny. Within the latter system, the males leave their home territory once their primary mates lays their first eggs. Males then create a second territory, presumably in order to attract a secondary female to breed. Even when they succeed at acquiring a second mate, the males typically return to the first female to exclusively provide for her and her offspring. Males will sometimes care for both mates if the nests of the primary and secondary female are close together. The male may also care for both mates once the offspring of the primary female have fledged. The male bird usually does not exceed two mates, practicing bigamy. Only two cases of trigyny have been observed.

===Sex difference in mating behaviour===
The male mating behavior has two key characteristics: desertion of the primary female and polyterritoriality. The males travel large distances, an average of , to find his second mate. After breeding with the secondary female, the males return to their first mate. The males of this species are polyterritorial; the males will acquire multiple nest sites to attract a female. Upon breeding with this first female, the male will procure more nesting sites, typically some distance from the site of the primary female, in order to attract a second female for mating. The males that have better success at polygyny are typically larger, older and more experienced at arriving earlier to the mating sites.
The female behaviour has also been studied in depth, especially due to the fact that some females accept polygyny while others are able to maintain monogamous relationships. The first female in a polygynous relationship does not suffer much in comparison to females in monogamous situations. These primary females gain greater reproductive success because they are able to secure full-time help from the male once he returns from his search for a second mate. The second female, however, often suffers from polygyny. These females have 60% less offspring than females that are in a monogamous relationship. These findings are consistent with the polygyny threshold model, which is depicted at the right. Additionally, the secondary female lays a smaller clutch which she is more likely to be able to rear on her own.

Another behaviour that is relatively frequent in European pied flycatchers is the practice of extra-pair copulations (EPC). Thus, the male practising EPC will have a group of offspring raised successfully without any parental investment on his part. The female may benefit from EPC if the second male is judged to have superior genes to the original male. Another benefit that EPC adds is that there is an increase in genetic variability. However, females are not typically very welcoming of EPC. A female that is being pursued for an EPC will either passively allow the male to copulate with her, or will resist it and risk injury due to the male&#x27;s aggression.

===Breeding dispersal===
In an experiment conducted from 1948 to 1964 in the Forest of Dean in Gloucestershire, two hundred and fifty nest boxes were carefully recorded for their locations and then analyzed for their inhabitance. The median breeding dispersal (the distance between successive nests) of the European pied flycatcher ranges from about , with the average distance between nest sites being about . This distance typically depended on the breeding density in each year. The study found little evidence to suggest a difference in breeding dispersal between years or between monogamous and polygynous males. As a result, the data for the separate categories could be combined. The breeding dispersal over longer distances could result in both mate fidelity as well as mate change, the latter of which occurs either while the previous mate is still alive, or following the death of the mate. The breeding dispersal distances of birds that survive more than three breeding seasons were studied, and the results showed that the site fidelity increased with more successive breeding attempts. The same long-term study also found that older European pied flycatchers, both male and female, were more likely to move shorter distances between breeding seasons than younger birds were. When mates were observed to re-establish their pair bond, they tended to occupy certain areas that were near the nest site established in the previous breeding season. In addition, female birds were less likely to return to a former breeding site following the death of, or divorce from, their former partner. When a pair divorces, the females have been observed to move greater distances away than the males. As a result, females that keep the same mates from year to year end up moving shorter distances for each mating period than those that divorce. Divorce has little influence on the likelihood of males moving away from their original nest site. The study found that males that keep the same mate do not move significantly smaller distances than males that divorce.

===Evolution of polygyny===
Since most bird species exhibit monogamous mating behaviors, the polygynous behavior of the European pied flycatcher has sparked much research. There are three main hypotheses that seek to explain why females settle polygynously when it lowers their overall fitness and reproductive success compared to a monogamous relationship.

====&quot;Sexy son&quot; hypothesis====

The first hypothesis is the &quot;sexy son&quot; hypothesis which asserts that although females experience an initial reproductive loss with their first generation, the reproductive success of the second generation compensates for the initial loss. The second generation of males is thought to be privileged because it will inherit the increased mating ability, or attractiveness, from their fathers and thus will have high success in procuring mates upon maturation. Since these &quot;sexy sons&quot; are projected to have heightened reproductive success, the secondary female&#x27;s reproductive success in turn improves. Some researchers, however, have refuted this theory, stating that offspring born to secondary females suffered from poor nutrition, which resulted in shorter tarsi and lower weights than the progeny of primary and monogamous females. These phenotypic traits contribute to lesser success in mate acquisition, rejecting the &quot;sexy son&quot; hypothesis.

====Deception hypothesis====
The second hypothesis claims that deception from the male flycatcher explains a female&#x27;s choice to mate with an already-mated male despite the relative decrease in reproductive success. The deception arises from the polyterritoriality of the males, meaning that the males are able to deceive the females through the use of separate territories. This hypothesis attempts to describe why males have developed polyterritorial behavior. The typical long distances between nest sites suggest that males acquire multiple nest sites to facilitate the deception of the secondary female. A study showed that females leave the male upon discovering that he is already mated, as long as she discovers this fact before laying season. However, another experiment with European pied flycatchers in Norway produced results that refute the deception hypothesis. The secondary female birds in their study raised larger clutches than primary females. The study also showed that deception is not an evolutionarily stable strategy for males, because secondary females would notice the frequent visits to the primary females and then elect to choose another mate. According to the deception hypothesis, already-mated males display polyterritorial behavior that increases their chances of acquiring another mate. Unmated males were shown to display mating behavior, consisting mostly of singing, at their nest site. On the other hand, already-mated males would need to disrupt their singing at their secondary territories in order to return to their primary nest. This can occur both before and after the time of their second mating. As a result, it decreases the chance that females would be deceived, leading to an evolutionarily unstable strategy.

====Female aggression hypothesis====
The third hypothesis asserts that females settle for polygyny because it is hard to find unmated males. This theory assumes that there is aggression between females to find mates and asserts that polyterritoriality actually helps to alleviate this aggression, allowing the second female a place to settle and breed peacefully. Although the deception hypothesis suggests that males are more successful at farther secondary territories because they can hide their marital status, the female-female aggression suggests that males occupy distant secondary territories to reduce aggression between the primary and secondary females. Primary females display aggression and prevent other females from settling near the initial nest to ensure that they acquire the male parental care. Primary females were seen in experiments to visit the second territory and behave aggressively towards the secondary female. The number of such visits decreased with increasing distance between the nests. It is also important for the primary female to be able to detect an intruding female as soon as possible, because the longer the intruder has been present in a territory, the more difficult it will be to evict the female. Female flycatchers are known to have the capacity to identify the songs of their own mates and check if they establish a second territory. The primary male was also shown to spend less time in the second territories during incubation periods than before they acquired a secondary mate, especially with greater distances between the two territories.

=== Speciation by reinforcement ===
&quot;F. hypoleuca&quot; (pied flycatcher) and &quot;F. albicollis&quot; (collared flycatcher) are speciating from each other, providing evidence for speciation by reinforcement (selection against hybrid). The two species diverged less than two million years ago, which is considered recent on the time scale of evolution. Still, hybrids of the two species already suffer from low fertility and metabolic dysfunction. It was also believed that sexual selection causes reinforcement and pied flycatcher evolved different colouration in sympatry versus allopatry to prevent hybridization, though some evidence suggests heterospecific competition instead of reinforcement as the underlying mechanism. Mating choice tests of the species find that females of both species choose conspecific males in sympatry, but heterospecific males in allopatry (see conspecific song preference). The patterns could suggest mimicry, driven by interspecific competition; however, song divergence has been detected that shows a similar pattern to the mating preferences.

==Parental care==

Studies were also done to examine the amount of contribution the male European pied flycatcher provided in parental care as well as why some females choose to mate with mated males. When older and younger monogamous males were compared, there was no difference in feeding rate between each nest. When females were studied, scientists found that monogamous and primary females benefited significantly more from the male in terms of parental care than polygynous females did. The latter group could only partially compensate for the absence of a male, leading to secondary females and widows raising fewer offspring than the monogamous pairs did. In the study, differences in mates and the qualities of the territories were slight and therefore not considered, since they lead to no advantages for females to choose between the territories belonging to monogamous or already-mated males. The results of the study suggest that the males can control multiple territories and are thus able to deceive females into accepting polygyny, while the females do not have enough time to discover the marital status of the males.

In terms of male parental care to clutches, the rate of male incubation feeding was directly related to the physical condition of the males, and negatively correlated with the ambient temperature. Polygynously mated females also received far less feeds than monogamously mated females, despite having no difference in the food delivery rates by the male. The reduction in delivery rate to the polygynously mated females led to a negative effect on their incubation efficiency, because the females needed to spend more time away from the nest acquiring food. This also prolonged the incubation period when compared to monogamous females. The male feeding behavior is related to the reproductive value as represented by the nests, as well as to the costs and benefits of incubation feeding.

==Feeding==
The main diet of the European pied flycatcher is insects. In fact, their name comes from their habit of catching flying insects, but they also catch insects or arthropods from tree trunks, branches, or from the ground. Studies have found that the majority of food catches were made from the ground. It was also found that airborne prey were captured more during the early part of the season (May to June) than in the later part (August to September); the converse trend appeared in prey taken from trees. There are also many overlaps in the foraging techniques with the collared flycatcher, the spotted flycatcher, and the common redstart.

Courtship feeding, or incubation feeding, occurs when the male feeds the female in the pairing, egglaying stages, and incubation. An interpretation of this behavior is that it strengthens the pair bond between mates.

===Diet===

The diet of the European pied flycatcher is composed nearly entirely of insects. One study analyzed the stomach contents of birds during the breeding season and found that ants, bees, wasps and beetles made up the main diet. Ants made up approximately 25% of the diet.
Food given to nestlings include spiders, butterflies, moths, flies, mosquitoes, ants, bees, wasps, and beetles. For Lepidoptera and Hymenoptera, larvae appear to be consumed more than adult insects; the opposite is true for other insect orders. There is also variation between the proportions of larvae and adult insects between different habitats. Nestlings were also found to consume more spiders, butterfly, and moth larvae, while adult flycatchers consume more ants.

==Status==
It has on average decreased in population by 25% within the last 25 years. It has ceased to breed in several parts of its former range within Britain. It is a very rare and irregular breeder in Ireland, with only one or two pairs recorded as breeding in most years. Records of its location can be found on that National Biodiversity Network. In the Netherlands it has declined by 90% due to nestling peaks mistiming.

===Lifecycle===
*mid-September to mid-April: lives in sub Saharan Africa
*mid April to end of May: migrates and arrives in countries such as the United Kingdom
*June to August: breeding season, one brood only
*August to mid September: flies back to sub Saharan Africa

===Management and conservation===
They breed in upland broadleaf woodland. This means that in Britain they are limited due to geography to the North and West. They prefer mature oak woodland, but also breed in mature upland ash and birch woods.

They require very high horizontal visibility - a low abundance of shrub and understorey, but with high proportion of moss and grass. Grazing needs to be managed to maintain this open character, but also allow the occasional replacement trees.

They will sometimes use mature open conifer woodland where natural tree holes occur. Generally they prefer trees that have tree holes, i.e. dead trees, or dead limbs on healthy trees. They also like lichens that grow on trees.

====Grant funding for conservation====
The Forestry Commission offers grants under a scheme called England&#x27;s Woodland Improvement Grant (EWIG); as does Natural England&#x27;s Environmental Stewardship Scheme.

<text>The collared flycatcher (Ficedula albicollis) is a small passerine bird in the Old World flycatcher family, one of the four species of Western Palearctic black-and-white flycatchers. It breeds in southeast Europe (isolated populations are present in the islands of Gotland and Öland in the Baltic Sea, Sweden) and Eastern France to the Balkan Peninsula and Ukraine and is migratory, wintering in sub Sahara Africa. It is a rare vagrant in western Europe.

This is a 12–13.5 cm long bird. The breeding male is mainly black above and white below, with a white collar, large white wing patch, black tail (although some males have white tail sides) and a large white forehead patch. It has a pale rump. The bill is black and has the broad but pointed shape typical of aerial insectivores. As well as taking insects in flight, this species hunts caterpillars amongst the oak foliage, and will take berries.
Non-breeding males, females and juveniles have the black replaced by a pale brown, and may be very difficult to distinguish from other &quot;Ficedula&quot; flycatchers, particularly the European pied flycatcher (&quot;F. hypoleuca&quot;) and the semicollared flycatcher (&quot;F. semitorquata&quot;), with which this species hybridizes to a limited extent. &quot;F. albicollis&quot; &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; &quot;F. hypoleuca&quot; are speciating from each other by reinforcement, as evidenced by differences between colouration in sympatry versus allopatry. This is evidence for speciation by reinforcement.

They are birds of deciduous woodlands, parks and gardens, with a preference for old trees with cavities in which it nests. They build an open nest in a tree hole, or man-made nest-boxes. Normally 5-7 eggs are laid. The song is slow strained whistles, quite unlike the pied flycatcher. Pied flycatchers can mimic the song of the collared flycatcher in sympatric populations.

The genus name is from Latin and refers to a small fig-eating bird (&quot;ficus&quot;, &quot;fig&quot;) supposed to change into the blackcap in winter. The specific &quot;albicollis&quot; is from Latin &quot;albus&quot;, white, and &quot;collum&quot;, &quot;neck&quot;.

The collared flycatcher is used as a model species in both ecology and genetics and it was one of the first birds that had its full genome sequenced. Repeated spectrometric data taken from male Collared Flycatchers has revealed that plumage reflectance should be measured during courtship, the primary period of sexual signalling, with spectral traits declining over the breeding season.

In a natural population of &quot;F. albicollis&quot; inbreeding appeared to be rare, but when it did occur it had severe negative consequences for fitness characteristics such as hatching success rate.

<text>In nuclear astrophysics, the rapid neutron-capture process, also known as the &quot;r&quot;-process, is a set of nuclear reactions that is responsible for the creation of approximately half of the atomic nuclei heavier than iron, the &quot;heavy elements&quot;, with the other half produced by the p-process and &quot;s&quot;-process. The &quot;r&quot;-process usually synthesizes the most neutron-rich stable isotopes of each heavy element. The &quot;r&quot;-process can typically synthesize the heaviest four isotopes of every heavy element; of these, the heavier two are called &quot;r-only nuclei&quot; because they are created exclusively via the &quot;r&quot;-process. Abundance peaks for the &quot;r&quot;-process occur near mass numbers (elements Se, Br, and Kr), (elements Te, I, and Xe) and (elements Os, Ir, and Pt).

The &quot;r&quot;-process entails a succession of &quot;rapid&quot; neutron captures (hence the name) by one or more heavy seed nuclei, typically beginning with nuclei in the abundance peak centered on 56Fe. The captures must be rapid in the sense that the nuclei must not have time to undergo radioactive decay (typically via β− decay) before another neutron arrives to be captured. This sequence can continue up to the limit of stability of the increasingly neutron-rich nuclei (the neutron drip line) to physically retain neutrons as governed by the short range nuclear force. The &quot;r&quot;-process therefore must occur in locations where there exists a high density of free neutrons.

Early studies theorized that 1024 free neutrons per cm3 would be required, for temperatures of about 1 GK, in order to match the waiting points, at which no more neutrons can be captured, with the mass numbers of the abundance peaks for &quot;r&quot;-process nuclei. This amounts to almost a gram of free neutrons in every cubic centimeter, an astonishing number requiring extreme locations. Traditionally this suggested the material ejected from the reexpanded core of a core-collapse supernova, as part of supernova nucleosynthesis, or decompression of neutron star matter thrown off by a binary neutron star merger in a kilonova. The relative contribution of each of these sources to the astrophysical abundance of &quot;r&quot;-process elements is a matter of ongoing research .

A limited &quot;r&quot;-process-like series of neutron captures occurs to a minor extent in thermonuclear weapon explosions. These led to the discovery of the elements einsteinium (element 99) and fermium (element 100) in nuclear weapon fallout.

The &quot;r&quot;-process contrasts with the &quot;s&quot;-process, the other predominant mechanism for the production of heavy elements, which is nucleosynthesis by means of &quot;slow&quot; captures of neutrons. In general, isotopes involved in the &quot;s&quot;-process have half-lives long enough to enable their study in laboratory experiments, but this is not typically true for isotopes involved in the &quot;r&quot;-process. The &quot;s&quot;-process primarily occurs within ordinary stars, particularly AGB stars, where the neutron flux is sufficient to cause neutron captures to recur every 10–100 years, much too slow for the &quot;r&quot;-process, which requires 100 captures per second. The &quot;s&quot;-process is &quot;secondary&quot;, meaning that it requires pre-existing heavy isotopes as seed nuclei to be converted into other heavy nuclei by a slow sequence of captures of free neutrons. The &quot;r&quot;-process scenarios create their own seed nuclei, so they might proceed in massive stars that contain no heavy seed nuclei. Taken together, the &quot;r&quot;- and &quot;s&quot;-processes account for almost the entire abundance of chemical elements heavier than iron. The historical challenge has been to locate physical settings appropriate to their time scales.

==History==
Following pioneering research into the Big Bang and the formation of helium in stars, an unknown process responsible for producing heavier elements found on Earth from hydrogen and helium was suspected to exist. One early attempt at explanation came from Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and Louis R. Henrich who postulated that elements were produced at temperatures between 6×109 and 8×109 K. Their theory accounted for elements up to chlorine, though there was no explanation for elements of atomic weight heavier than 40 amu at non-negligible abundances.
This became the foundation of a study by Fred Hoyle, who hypothesized that conditions in the core of collapsing stars would enable nucleosynthesis of the remainder of the elements via rapid capture of densely packed free neutrons. However, there remained unanswered questions about equilibrium in stars that was required to balance beta-decays and precisely account for abundances of elements that would be formed in such conditions.

The need for a physical setting providing rapid neutron capture, which was known to almost certainly have a role in element formation, was also seen in a table of abundances of isotopes of heavy elements by Hans Suess and Harold Urey in 1956. Their abundance table revealed larger than average abundances of natural isotopes containing magic numbers of neutrons as well as abundance peaks about 10 amu lighter than stable nuclei containing magic numbers of neutrons which were also in abundance, suggesting that radioactive neutron-rich nuclei having the magic neutron numbers but roughly ten fewer protons were formed. These observations also implied that rapid neutron capture occurred faster than beta decay, and the resulting abundance peaks were caused by so-called &quot;waiting points&quot; at magic numbers. This process, rapid neutron capture by neutron-rich isotopes, became known as the &quot;r&quot;-process, whereas the &quot;s&quot;-process was named for its characteristic slow neutron capture. A table apportioning the heavy isotopes phenomenologically between &quot;s&quot;-process and &quot;r&quot;-process isotopes was published in 1957 in the B2FH review paper,  which named the &quot;r&quot;-process and outlined the physics that guides it. Alastair G. W. Cameron also published a smaller study about the &quot;r&quot;-process in the same year.

The stationary &quot;r&quot;-process as described by the B2FH paper was first demonstrated in a time-dependent calculation at Caltech by Phillip A. Seeger, William A. Fowler and Donald D. Clayton, who found that no single temporal snapshot matched the solar &quot;r&quot;-process abundances, but, that when superposed, did achieve a successful characterization of the &quot;r&quot;-process abundance distribution. Shorter-time distributions emphasize abundances at atomic weights less than , whereas longer-time distributions emphasized those at atomic weights greater than . Subsequent treatments of the &quot;r&quot;-process reinforced those temporal features. Seeger et al. were also able to construct more quantitative apportionment between &quot;s&quot;-process and &quot;r&quot;-process of the abundance table of heavy isotopes, thereby establishing a more reliable abundance curve for the &quot;r&quot;-process isotopes than B2FH had been able to define. Today, the &quot;r&quot;-process abundances are determined using their technique of subtracting the more reliable &quot;s&quot;-process isotopic abundances from the total isotopic abundances and attributing the remainder to &quot;r&quot;-process nucleosynthesis. That &quot;r&quot;-process abundance curve (vs. atomic weight) has provided for many decades the target for theoretical computations of abundances synthesized by the physical &quot;r&quot;-process.

The creation of free neutrons by electron capture during the rapid collapse to high density of a supernova core along with quick assembly of some neutron-rich seed nuclei makes the &quot;r&quot;-process a &quot;primary nucleosynthesis process&quot;, a process that can occur even in a star initially of pure H and He. This in contrast to the B2FH designation which is a &quot;secondary process&quot; building on preexisting iron. Primary stellar nucleosynthesis begins earlier in the galaxy than does secondary nucleosynthesis. Alternatively the high density of neutrons within neutron stars would be available for rapid assembly into &quot;r&quot;-process nuclei if a collision were to eject portions of a neutron star, which then rapidly expands freed from confinement. That sequence could also begin earlier in galactic time than would &quot;s&quot;-process nucleosynthesis; so each scenario fits the earlier growth of &quot;r&quot;-process abundances in the galaxy. Each of these scenarios is the subject of active theoretical research.
Observational evidence of the early &quot;r&quot;-process enrichment of interstellar gas and of subsequent newly formed stars, as applied to the abundance evolution of the galaxy of stars, was first laid out by James W. Truran in 1981. He and subsequent astronomers showed that the pattern of heavy-element abundances in the earliest metal-poor stars matched that of the shape of the solar &quot;r&quot;-process curve, as if the &quot;s&quot;-process component were missing. This was consistent with the hypothesis that the &quot;s&quot;-process had not yet begun to enrich interstellar gas when these young stars missing the &quot;s&quot;-process abundances were born from that gas, for it requires about 100 million years of galactic history for the &quot;s&quot;-process to get started whereas the &quot;r&quot;-process can begin after two million years. These &quot;s&quot;-process–poor, &quot;r&quot;-process–rich stellar compositions must have been born earlier than any &quot;s&quot;-process, showing that the &quot;r&quot;-process emerges from quickly evolving massive stars that become supernovae and leave neutron-star remnants that can merge with another neutron star. The primary nature of the early &quot;r&quot;-process thereby derives from observed abundance spectra in old stars that had been born early, when the galactic metallicity was still small, but that nonetheless contain their complement of &quot;r&quot;-process nuclei.

Either interpretation, though generally supported by supernova experts, has yet to achieve a totally satisfactory calculation of &quot;r&quot;-process abundances because the overall problem is numerically formidable. However, existing results are supportive; in 2017, new data about the &quot;r&quot;-process was discovered when the LIGO and Virgo gravitational-wave observatories discovered a merger of two neutron stars ejecting &quot;r&quot;-process matter. See Astrophysical sites below.

Noteworthy is that the &quot;r&quot;-process is responsible for our natural cohort of radioactive elements, such as uranium and thorium, as well as the most neutron-rich isotopes of each heavy element.

==Nuclear physics==
There are three natural candidate sites for &quot;r&quot;-process nucleosynthesis where the required conditions are thought to exist: low-mass supernovae, Type II supernovae, and neutron star mergers.

Immediately after the severe compression of electrons in a Type II supernova, beta-minus decay is blocked. This is because the high electron density fills all available free electron states up to a Fermi energy which is greater than the energy of nuclear beta decay. However, nuclear capture of those free electrons still occurs, and causes increasing of matter. This results in an extremely high density of free neutrons which cannot decay, on the order of 1024 neutrons per cm3, and high temperatures. As this re-expands and cools, neutron capture by still-existing heavy nuclei occurs much faster than beta-minus decay. As a consequence, the &quot;r&quot;-process runs up along the neutron drip line and highly-unstable neutron-rich nuclei are created.

Three processes which affect the climbing of the neutron drip line are a notable decrease in the neutron-capture cross section in nuclei with closed neutron shells, the inhibiting process of photodisintegration, and the degree of nuclear stability in the heavy-isotope region. Neutron captures in &quot;r&quot;-process nucleosynthesis leads to the formation of neutron-rich, weakly bound nuclei with neutron separation energies as low as 2 MeV. At this stage, closed neutron shells at &quot;N&quot; = 50, 82, and 126 are reached, and neutron capture is temporarily paused. These so-called waiting points are characterized by increased binding energy relative to heavier isotopes, leading to low neutron capture cross sections and a buildup of semi-magic nuclei that are more stable toward beta decay. In addition, nuclei beyond the shell closures are susceptible to quicker beta decay owing to their proximity to the drip line; for these nuclei, beta decay occurs before further neutron capture. Waiting point nuclei are then allowed to beta decay toward stability before further neutron capture can occur, resulting in a slowdown or &quot;freeze-out&quot; of the reaction.

Decreasing nuclear stability terminates the &quot;r&quot;-process when its heaviest nuclei become unstable to spontaneous fission, when the total number of nucleons approaches 270. The fission barrier may be low enough before 270 such that neutron capture might induce fission instead of continuing up the neutron drip line. After the neutron flux decreases, these highly unstable radioactive nuclei undergo a rapid succession of beta decays until they reach more stable, neutron-rich nuclei. While the &quot;s&quot;-process creates an abundance of stable nuclei having closed neutron shells, the &quot;r&quot;-process, in neutron-rich predecessor nuclei, creates an abundance of radioactive nuclei about 10 amu below the &quot;s&quot;-process peaks. These abundance peaks correspond to stable isobars produced from successive beta decays of waiting point nuclei having &quot;N&quot; = 50, 82, and 126—which are about 10 protons removed from the line of beta stability.

The &quot;r&quot;-process also occurs in thermonuclear weapons, and was responsible for the initial discovery of neutron-rich almost stable isotopes of actinides like plutonium-244 and the new elements einsteinium and fermium (atomic numbers 99 and 100) in the 1950s. It has been suggested that multiple nuclear explosions would make it possible to reach the island of stability, as the affected nuclides (starting with uranium-238 as seed nuclei) would not have time to beta decay all the way to the quickly spontaneously fissioning nuclides at the line of beta stability before absorbing more neutrons in the next explosion, thus providing a chance to reach neutron-rich superheavy nuclides like copernicium-291 and -293 which may have half-lives of centuries or millennia.

==Astrophysical sites==
The most probable candidate site for the &quot;r&quot;-process has long been suggested to be core-collapse supernovae (spectral types &quot;Ib&quot;, &quot;Ic&quot; and &quot;II&quot;), which may provide the necessary physical conditions for the &quot;r&quot;-process. However, the very low abundance of &quot;r&quot;-process nuclei in the interstellar gas limits the amount each can have ejected. It requires either that only a small fraction of supernovae eject &quot;r&quot;-process nuclei to the interstellar medium, or that each supernova ejects only a very small amount of &quot;r&quot;-process material. The ejected material must be relatively neutron-rich, a condition which has been difficult to achieve in models, so that astrophysicists remain uneasy about their adequacy for successful &quot;r&quot;-process yields.

In 2017, new astronomical data about the &quot;r&quot;-process was discovered in data from the merger of two neutron stars. Using the gravitational wave data captured in GW170817 to identify the location of the merger, several teams observed and studied optical data of the merger, finding spectroscopic evidence of &quot;r&quot;-process material thrown off by the merging neutron stars. The bulk of this material seems to consist of two types: hot blue masses of highly radioactive &quot;r&quot;-process matter of lower-mass-range heavy nuclei ( such as strontium) and cooler red masses of higher mass-number &quot;r&quot;-process nuclei () rich in actinides (such as uranium, thorium, and californium). When released from the huge internal pressure of the neutron star, these ejecta expand and form seed heavy nuclei that rapidly capture free neutrons, and radiate detected optical light for about a week. Such duration of luminosity would not be possible without heating by internal radioactive decay, which is provided by &quot;r&quot;-process nuclei near their waiting points. Two distinct mass regions ( and ) for the &quot;r&quot;-process yields have been known since the first time dependent calculations of the &quot;r&quot;-process. Because of these spectroscopic features it has been argued that such nucleosynthesis in the Milky Way has been primarily ejecta from neutron-star mergers rather than from supernovae.

These results offer a new possibility for clarifying six decades of uncertainty over the site of origin of &quot;r&quot;-process nuclei. Confirming relevance to the &quot;r&quot;-process is that it is radiogenic power from radioactive decay of &quot;r&quot;-process nuclei that maintains the visibility of these spun off &quot;r&quot;-process fragments. Otherwise they would dim quickly. Such alternative sites were first seriously proposed in 1974 as decompressing neutron star matter. It was proposed such matter is ejected from neutron stars merging with black holes in compact binaries. In 1989 (and 1999) this scenario was extended to binary neutron star mergers (a binary star system of two neutron stars that collide). After preliminary identification of these sites, the scenario was confirmed in GW170817. Current astrophysical models suggest that a single neutron star merger event may have generated between 3 and 13 Earth masses of gold.

<text>The slow neutron-capture process, or &quot;s&quot;-process, is a series of reactions in nuclear astrophysics that occur in stars, particularly asymptotic giant branch stars. The &quot;s&quot;-process is responsible for the creation (nucleosynthesis) of approximately half the atomic nuclei heavier than iron.

In the &quot;s&quot;-process, a seed nucleus undergoes neutron capture to form an isotope with one higher atomic mass. If the new isotope is stable, a series of increases in mass can occur, but if it is unstable, then beta decay will occur, producing an element of the next higher atomic number. The process is &quot;slow&quot; (hence the name) in the sense that there is sufficient time for this radioactive decay to occur before another neutron is captured. A series of these reactions produces stable isotopes by moving along the valley of beta-decay stable isobars in the table of nuclides.

A range of elements and isotopes can be produced by the &quot;s&quot;-process, because of the intervention of alpha decay steps along the reaction chain. The relative abundances of elements and isotopes produced depends on the source of the neutrons and how their flux changes over time. Each branch of the &quot;s&quot;-process reaction chain eventually terminates at a cycle involving lead, bismuth, and polonium.

The &quot;s&quot;-process contrasts with the &quot;r&quot;-process, in which successive neutron captures are &quot;rapid&quot;: they happen more quickly than the beta decay can occur. The &quot;r&quot;-process dominates in environments with higher fluxes of free neutrons; it produces heavier elements and more neutron-rich isotopes than the &quot;s&quot;-process. Together the two processes account for most of the relative abundance of chemical elements heavier than iron.

==History==
The &quot;s&quot;-process was seen to be needed from the relative abundances of isotopes of heavy elements and from a newly published table of abundances by Hans Suess and Harold Urey in 1956. Among other things, these data showed abundance peaks for strontium, barium, and lead, which, according to quantum mechanics and the nuclear shell model, are particularly stable nuclei, much like the noble gases are chemically inert. This implied that some abundant nuclei must be created by slow neutron capture, and it was only a matter of determining how other nuclei could be accounted for by such a process. A table apportioning the heavy isotopes between &quot;s&quot;-process and &quot;r&quot;-process was published in the famous B2FH review paper in 1957. There it was also argued that the &quot;s&quot;-process occurs in red giant stars. In a particularly illustrative case, the element technetium, whose longest half-life is 4.2 million years, had been discovered in s-, M-, and N-type stars in 1952 by Paul W. Merrill. Since these stars were thought to be billions of years old, the presence of technetium in their outer atmospheres was taken as evidence of its recent creation there, probably unconnected with the nuclear fusion in the deep interior of the star that provides its power.

A calculable model for creating the heavy isotopes from iron seed nuclei in a time-dependent manner was not provided until 1961. That work showed that the large overabundances of barium observed by astronomers in certain red-giant stars could be created from iron seed nuclei if the total neutron flux (number of neutrons per unit area) was appropriate. It also showed that no one single value for neutron flux could account for the observed &quot;s&quot;-process abundances, but that a wide range is required. The numbers of iron seed nuclei that were exposed to a given flux must decrease as the flux becomes stronger. This work also showed that the curve of the product of neutron-capture cross section times abundance is not a smoothly falling curve, as B2FH had sketched, but rather has a &quot;ledge-precipice structure&quot;. A series of papers in the 1970s by Donald D. Clayton utilizing an exponentially declining neutron flux as a function of the number of iron seed exposed became the standard model of the &quot;s&quot;-process and remained so until the details of AGB-star nucleosynthesis became sufficiently advanced that they became a standard model for &quot;s&quot;-process element formation based on stellar structure models. Important series of measurements of neutron-capture cross sections were reported from Oak Ridge National Lab in 1965 and by Karlsruhe Nuclear Physics Center in 1982 and subsequently, these placed the &quot;s&quot;-process on the firm quantitative basis that it enjoys today.

==The &quot;s&quot;-process in stars==

The &quot;s&quot;-process is believed to occur mostly in asymptotic giant branch stars, seeded by iron nuclei left by a supernova during a previous generation of stars. In contrast to the &quot;r&quot;-process which is believed to occur over time scales of seconds in explosive environments, the &quot;s&quot;-process is believed to occur over time scales of thousands of years, passing decades between neutron captures. The extent to which the &quot;s&quot;-process moves up the elements in the chart of isotopes to higher mass numbers is essentially determined by the degree to which the star in question is able to produce neutrons. The quantitative yield is also proportional to the amount of iron in the star&#x27;s initial abundance distribution. Iron is the &quot;starting material&quot; (or seed) for this neutron capture-beta minus decay sequence of synthesizing new elements.

The main neutron source reactions are:

One distinguishes the main and the weak &quot;s&quot;-process component. The main component produces heavy elements beyond Sr and Y, and up to Pb in the lowest metallicity stars. The production sites of the main component are low-mass asymptotic giant branch stars. The main component relies on the 13C neutron source above. The weak component of the &quot;s&quot;-process, on the other hand, synthesizes &quot;s&quot;-process isotopes of elements from iron group seed nuclei to 58Fe on up to Sr and Y, and takes place at the end of helium- and carbon-burning in massive stars. It employs primarily the 22Ne neutron source. These stars will become supernovae at their demise and spew those &quot;s&quot;-process isotopes into interstellar gas.

The &quot;s&quot;-process is sometimes approximated over a small mass region using the so-called &quot;local approximation&quot;, by which the ratio of abundances is inversely proportional to the ratio of neutron-capture cross-sections for nearby isotopes on the &quot;s&quot;-process path. This approximation is – as the name indicates – only valid locally, meaning for isotopes of nearby mass numbers, but it is invalid at magic numbers where the ledge-precipice structure dominates.
Because of the relatively low neutron fluxes expected to occur during the &quot;s&quot;-process (on the order of 105 to 1011 neutrons per cm2 per second), this process does not have the ability to produce any of the heavy radioactive isotopes such as thorium or uranium. The cycle that terminates the &quot;s&quot;-process is:

 captures a neutron, producing , which decays to by β− decay. in turn decays to by α decay:

 then captures three neutrons, producing , which decays to by β− decay, restarting the cycle:

The net result of this cycle therefore is that 4 neutrons are converted into one alpha particle, two electrons, two anti-electron neutrinos and gamma radiation:

The process thus terminates in bismuth, the heaviest &quot;stable&quot; element, and polonium, the first non-primordial element after bismuth. Bismuth is actually slightly radioactive, but with a half-life so long—a billion times the present age of the universe—that it is effectively stable over the lifetime of any existing star. Polonium-210, however, decays with a half-life of 138 days to stable lead-206.

==The &quot;s&quot;-process measured in stardust==

Stardust is one component of cosmic dust. Stardust is individual solid grains that condensed during mass loss from various long-dead stars. Stardust existed throughout interstellar gas before the birth of the Solar System and was trapped in meteorites when they assembled from interstellar matter contained in the planetary accretion disk in early Solar System. Today they are found in meteorites, where they have been preserved. Meteoriticists habitually refer to them as presolar grains. The &quot;s&quot;-process enriched grains are mostly silicon carbide (SiC). The origin of these grains is demonstrated by laboratory measurements of extremely unusual isotopic abundance ratios within the grain. First experimental detection of &quot;s&quot;-process xenon isotopes was made in 1978, confirming earlier predictions that &quot;s&quot;-process isotopes would be enriched, nearly pure, in stardust from red giant stars. These discoveries launched new insight into astrophysics and into the origin of meteorites in the Solar System. Silicon carbide (SiC) grains condense in the atmospheres of AGB stars and thus trap isotopic abundance ratios as they existed in that star. Because the AGB stars are the main site of the &quot;s&quot;-process in the galaxy, the heavy elements in the SiC grains contain almost pure &quot;s&quot;-process isotopes in elements heavier than iron. This fact has been demonstrated repeatedly by sputtering-ion mass spectrometer studies of these stardust presolar grains. Several surprising results have shown that within them the ratio of &quot;s&quot;-process and &quot;r&quot;-process abundances is somewhat different from that which was previously assumed. It has also been shown with trapped isotopes of krypton and xenon that the &quot;s&quot;-process abundances in the AGB-star atmospheres changed with time or from star to star, presumably with the strength of neutron flux in that star or perhaps the temperature. This is a frontier of &quot;s&quot;-process studies in the 2000s.

<text>The term p-process (&quot;p&quot; for proton) is used in two ways in the scientific literature concerning the astrophysical origin of the elements (nucleosynthesis). Originally it referred to a proton capture process which was proposed to be the source of certain, naturally occurring, neutron-deficient isotopes of the elements from selenium to mercury. These nuclides are called p-nuclei and their origin is still not completely understood. Although it was shown that the originally suggested process cannot produce the p-nuclei, later on the term p-process was sometimes used to generally refer to any nucleosynthesis process supposed to be responsible for the p-nuclei.

Often, the two meanings are confused. Recent scientific literature therefore suggests to use the term p-process only for the actual proton capture process, as it is customary with other nucleosynthesis processes in astrophysics.

==The proton capture p-process==
Proton-rich nuclides can be produced by sequentially adding one or more protons to an atomic nucleus. Such a nuclear reaction of type (p,γ) is called &quot;proton capture reaction&quot;. By adding a proton to a nucleus, the element is changed because the chemical element is defined by the proton number of a nucleus. At the same time the ratio of protons to neutrons is changed, resulting in a more neutron-deficient isotope of the next element. This led to the original idea for the production of p-nuclei: free protons (the nuclei of hydrogen atoms are present in stellar plasmas) should be captured on heavy nuclei (&quot;seed nuclei&quot;) also already present in the stellar plasma (previously produced in the &quot;s&quot;-process and/or &quot;r&quot;-process).

Such proton captures on stable nuclides (or nearly stable), however, are not very efficient in producing p-nuclei, especially the heavier ones, because the electric charge increases with each added proton, leading to an increased repulsion of the next proton to be added, according to Coulomb&#x27;s law. In the context of nuclear reactions this is called a Coulomb barrier. The higher the Coulomb barrier, the more kinetic energy a proton requires to get close to a nucleus and be captured by it. The average energy of the available protons is given by the temperature of the stellar plasma. Even if this temperature could be increased arbitrarily (which is not the case in stellar environments), protons would be removed faster from a nucleus by photodisintegration than they could be captured at high temperature. A possible alternative would be to have a very large number of protons available to increase the effective number of proton captures per second without having to raise the temperature too much. Such conditions, however, are not found in core-collapse supernovae which were supposed to be the site of the p-process.

Proton captures at extremely high proton densities are called rapid proton capture processes. They are distinct from the p-process not only by the required high proton density but also by the fact that very short-lived radionuclides are involved and the reaction path is located close to the proton drip line. Rapid proton capture processes are the rp-process, the νp-process, and the pn-process.

==History==
The term p-process was originally proposed in the famous B2FH paper in 1957. The authors assumed that this process was solely responsible for the p-nuclei and proposed that it occurs in the hydrogen-shell (see also stellar evolution) of a star exploding as a type II supernova. It was shown later that the required conditions are not found in such supernovae.

At the same time as B2FH, Alastair Cameron independently realized the necessity to add another nucleosynthesis process to neutron capture nucleosynthesis but simply mentioned proton captures without assigning a special name to the process. He also thought about alternatives, for example photodisintegration (called the γ-process today) or a combination of p-process and photodisintegration.

<doc id="352913" wikidata="Q241499" url="?curid=352913" title="Red-breasted flycatcher">
<text>The red-breasted flycatcher (Ficedula parva) is a small passerine bird in the Old World flycatcher family. It breeds in eastern Europe and across Central Asia and is migratory, wintering in south Asia. The bird is a regular passage migrant in western Europe, whereas the collared flycatcher which breeds further east is rare. This is because of the different migration direction.
The Asian species &quot;Ficedula albicilla&quot;, previously considered a subspecies of the red-breasted flycatcher, has the red throat surrounded by grey and a different song. It is usually now separated as the taiga flycatcher (Pallas, 1811).

The breeding male of this small 11–12 cm long flycatcher is mainly brown above and white below, with a grey head and orange throat. The bill is black and has the broad but pointed shape typical of aerial insectivores. As well as taking insects in flight, this species hunts caterpillars amongst the oak foliage, and will take berries. The base of the outertail feather is white and the tail is often flicked upwards as they perch looking out for insect prey which are caught on the wing or sometimes from the ground. In winter they are mostly silent but have a typical &quot;chip-chip-chr-rrr&quot; flycatcher call. In their breeding season, the song consists of melodious whistles, like that of the European pied flycatcher.

Non-breeding males, females and juveniles have brown heads and lack the throat collar, but are easily distinguished from other &quot;Ficedula&quot; flycatchers on size and the wheatear-like tail pattern, with an inverted dark T against the white tail sides.

They are found mainly deciduous woodlands, especially near water. They build an open nest in a tree hole or similar recess. 4–7 eggs are laid.

Studies on their spring arrivals to the breeding quarters in Poland from 1973–2002 show that males are returning earlier with increasing temperatures.

The genus name is from Latin and refers to a small fig-eating bird (&quot;ficus&quot;, &quot;fig&quot;) supposed to change into the blackcap in winter. The specific &quot;parva&quot; is Latin for &quot;small&quot;.

<text>The taiga flycatcher or red-throated flycatcher (Ficedula albicilla) is a migratory bird in the family Muscicapidae. The species was first described by Peter Simon Pallas in 1811. The female has brown upper parts with a blackish tail flanked by white. The breast is buffish with underparts mostly white. The male has ear coverts and sides of the neck blue-tinged grey with breeding males having orange-red coloration on the throats. Unlike the taiga flycatcher, the female of the similar red-breasted flycatcher has a brown tail while the red colour in breeding males extends to the breast in the red-breasted flycatcher. It breeds in northern Eurasia from eastern Russia to Siberia and Mongolia. It is a winter visitor to South and South-east Asia in Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Nepal, Malaysia, Thailand, China, Vietnam, and Japan. Its natural habitat is taiga forest. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe.

It was formerly considered a subspecies of the red-breasted flycatcher.

The genus name is from Latin and refers to a small fig-eating bird (&quot;ficus&quot;, fig) supposed to change into the blackcap in winter. The specific name &quot;albicilla&quot; is from Latin &quot;albus&quot;, white, and Neo-Latin &quot;cilla&quot; tail; this meaning of &quot;cilla&quot; arose from a misunderstanding of &quot;motacilla&quot;, the name for the wagtail.

<doc id="352927" wikidata="Q1506059" url="?curid=352927" title="Modern Language Association">
<text>The Modern Language Association of America, often referred to as the Modern Language Association (MLA), is widely considered the principal professional association in the United States for scholars of language and literature. The MLA aims to &quot;strengthen the study and teaching of language and literature&quot;. The organization includes over 20,000 members in 100 countries, primarily academic scholars, professors, and graduate students who study or teach language and literature, including English, other modern languages, and comparative literature. Although founded in the United States, with offices in New York City, the MLA&#x27;s membership, concerns, reputation, and influence are international in scope.

==History==

The MLA was founded in 1883, as a discussion and advocacy group for the study of literature and modern languages (that is, all but classical languages, such as ancient Latin and Greek). According to its profile featured by the American Council of Learned Societies (ACLS), &quot;The Modern Language Association is formed for educational, scientific, literary, and social objects and purposes, and more specifically for the promotion of the academic and scientific study of English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, and other so-called modern languages and literatures.&quot;

==Officers and governance==
The officers of the MLA are elected by its members. The 2019–2020 president was Simon Gikandi, the first vice-president was Judith Butler and the second vice-president was Barbara Fuchs. The 2020–2021 president is Judith Butler.

The MLA is governed by an Executive Council, elected periodically by its members, according to the &quot;MLA Constitution&quot;. The Executive Director is Paula Krebs.

==Activities==
The MLA publishes several academic journals, including Publications of the Modern Language Association of America, one of the most prestigious journals in literary studies, and &quot;Profession&quot;, which is now published online on &quot;MLA Commons&quot; and discusses professional issues faced by teachers of language and literature. The association also publishes the &quot;MLA Handbook&quot;, a guide that is geared toward high school and undergraduate students and has sold more than 6,500,000 copies. The MLA produces the online database, &quot;MLA International Bibliography&quot;, the standard bibliography in language and literature.

Since 1884 the MLA has held a national, four-day convention. For many years it was held the last week in December. Beginning in 2011, the convention dates moved to the first Thursday following 2 January. Approximately eight to twelve thousand members attend, depending on the location, which alternates among major cities in various regions of the United States. The MLA Annual Convention is the largest and most important of the year for scholars of languages and literature. Language departments of many universities and colleges interview candidates for teaching positions at the convention, although hiring occurs all year long. The organization&#x27;s &quot;Job Information List&quot; (&quot;JIL&quot;) is available online.

In addition to its job-placement activities, the convention features about 800 sessions, including presentations of papers and panel discussions on diverse topics (special sessions, forums, poetry readings, film presentations, interdisciplinary studies involving art and music, governance meetings) and social events hosted by English and language departments and allied or affiliated organizations. There are also extensive book exhibits in one of the main hotel or convention center exhibition areas.

In November 2016, the association launched &quot;Humanities Commons&quot;, an open-access, crossdisciplinary hub for anyone interested in humanities research and scholarship. Other not-for-profit organizations involved in this project include College Art Association; Association for Jewish Studies; and the Association for Slavic, East European, and Eurasian Studies.

The MLA&#x27;s Web site features the MLA Language Map, which presents overviews and detailed data from the United States 2000 Census about the locations and numbers of speakers of thirty languages and seven groups of less commonly spoken languages in the United States and Canada.

The association has highlighted issues such as race, gender and class in its professional deliberations. In &quot;The New Criterion&quot;, a classicist and politically conservative magazine, Roger Kimball and Hilton Kramer argued that this was part of a &quot;rampant politicization of literary study that the MLA has aggressively supported&quot; in American colleges and universities, including elevating popular culture to a position of parity with great works of literature as subjects for classroom study, and other &quot;radical&quot; postures.

=== Proposed academic boycott of Israel ===
On January 7, 2017, the MLA rejected a proposed boycott of Israeli academic institutions in a 113–79 vote during its annual meeting in Philadelphia. Activists within the association had since 2014 pushed for such a boycott because they believed Israel was guilty of human rights violations and should be subjected to a boycott similarly to how South Africa was boycotted by the Anti-Apartheid Movement. The inspiration for the boycott came from the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement which is a global movement that calls for comprehensive boycotts of Israel. 

The activists calling themselves &quot;MLA Members for Justice in Palestine&quot; presented a resolution in December 2016 calling for a boycott. The call to boycott received support from scholars such as Judith Butler and novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen, but also opposition from scholars such as Cary Nelson and historian Kenneth Waltzer as well as a group calling itself &quot;MLA Members for Scholars Rights.&quot; A group of Israeli scholars sent videotaped messages stating Israeli universities are multicultural and calling the BDS campaign one of harassment and slander. On the other side of the debate, another group of Israeli scholars came out in support of the boycott, arguing that &quot;the Israel-led campaign against the boycott of Israeli academic institutions rallies around the claim that if adapted it will hurt progressive Israeli scholars. Campaigners use this tactic to divert attention from the plight of the entire Palestinian population living under Israel&#x27;s elaborate system of colonial repression and injustice to a manufactured victimization of Israeli academics. This is a manipulative inversion of victimhood.&quot; 

In a strongly worded letter, the pro-Israeli Brandeis Center threatened to sue MLA if the resolution was adopted. In the letter addressed to the association&#x27;s President Kwame Anthony Appiah and Executive Director Rosemary G. Feal, the center claimed that the resolution was &quot;ultra vires&quot;. That is, that it would take the association in a direction that went beyond its original mission. Supporters of the boycott argued that it was not &quot;ultra vires&quot; because the Association had in the past been engaged in human rights issues.

At the 2025 annual meeting in New Orleans, the MLA executive council blocked a member vote on a resolution endorsing BDS and acknowledging Palestinian genocide accusation and scholasticide, prompting protest and campaign for members to lapse membership in the organization. The executive council released a statement in advance stating that while they are &quot;appalled by the continued attack on Gaza,&quot; a BDS resolution would present &quot;legal and fiduciary&quot; challenges.

==Regional associations==

<doc id="352939" wikidata="Q834903" url="?curid=352939" title="Comparative literature">
<text>Comparative literature studies is an academic field dealing with the study of literature and cultural expression across linguistic, national, geographic, and disciplinary boundaries. Comparative literature &quot;performs a role similar to that of the study of international relations but works with languages and artistic traditions, so as to understand cultures &#x27;from the inside&#x27;&quot;. While most frequently practised with works of different languages, comparative literature may also be performed on works of the same language if the works originate from different nations or cultures in which that language is spoken.

The characteristically intercultural and transnational field of comparative literature concerns itself with the relation between literature, broadly defined, and other spheres of human activity, including history, politics, philosophy, art, and science. Unlike other forms of literary study, comparative literature places its emphasis on the interdisciplinary analysis of social and cultural production within the &quot;economy, political dynamics, cultural movements, historical shifts, religious differences, the urban environment, international relations, public policy, and the sciences&quot;.

==Overview==
Students and instructors in the field, usually called &quot;comparatists&quot;, have traditionally been proficient in several languages and acquainted with the literary traditions, literary criticism, and major literary texts of those languages. Many of the newer sub-fields, however, are more influenced by critical theory and literary theory, stressing theoretical acumen and the ability to consider different types of art concurrently over proficiency in multiple languages.

The interdisciplinary nature of the field means that comparatists typically exhibit acquaintance with sociology, history, anthropology, translation studies, critical theory, cultural studies, and religious studies. As a result, comparative literature programs within universities may be designed by scholars drawn from several such departments. This eclecticism has led critics (from within and without) to charge that comparative literature is insufficiently well-defined or that comparatists too easily fall into dilettantism because the scope of their work is, of necessity, broad. Some question whether this breadth affects the ability of PhDs to find employment in the highly specialized environment of academia and the career market at large, although such concerns do not seem to be borne out by placement data, which shows comparative literature graduates to be hired at similar or higher rates than English literature graduates.

The terms &quot;comparative literature&quot; and &quot;world literature&quot; are often used to designate a similar course of study and scholarship. Comparative literature is the more widely used term in the United States, with many universities having comparative literature departments or comparative literature programs.

Comparative literature is an interdisciplinary field whose practitioners study literature across national borders, time periods, languages, genres, boundaries between literature and the other arts (music, painting, dance, film, etc.), and across disciplines (literature and psychology, philosophy, science, history, architecture, sociology, politics, etc.). Defined most broadly, comparative literature is the study of &quot;literature without borders&quot;. Scholarship in comparative literature includes, for example, studying literacy and social status in the Americas, medieval epic and romance, the links of literature to folklore and mythology, colonial and postcolonial writings in different parts of the world, and asking fundamental questions about the definition of literature itself. What scholars in comparative literature share is a desire to study literature beyond national boundaries and an interest in languages so that they can read foreign texts in their original form. Many comparatists also share the desire to integrate literary experience with other cultural phenomena such as historical change, philosophical concepts, and social movements.

The discipline of comparative literature has scholarly associations such as the International Comparative Literature Association (ICLA) and comparative literature associations in many countries. There are many learned journals that publish scholarship in comparative literature: see &quot;Selected Comparative Literature and Comparative Humanities Journals&quot; and for a list of books in comparative literature see &quot;Bibliography of (Text)Books in Comparative Literature&quot;.

==Early work==
Work considered foundational to the discipline of comparative literature include Spanish humanist Juan Andrés&#x27;s work, Transylvanian Hungarian Hugo Meltzl de Lomnitz&#x27;s scholarship, also the founding editor of the journal &quot;Acta Comparationis Litterarum Universarum&quot; (1877) and Irish scholar H.M. Posnett&#x27;s &quot;Comparative Literature&quot; (1886). However, antecedents can be found in the ideas of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe in his vision of &quot;world literature&quot; (&quot;Weltliteratur)&quot; and Russian Formalists credited Alexander Veselovsky with laying the groundwork for the discipline. Viktor Zhirmunsky, for instance, referred to Veselovsky as &quot;the most remarkable representative of comparative literary study in Russian and European scholarship of the nineteenth century&quot; (Zhirmunsky qtd. in Rachel Polonsky, &quot;English Literature and the Russian Aesthetic Renaissance&quot; [Cambridge UP, 1998. 17]; see also David Damrosch
During the late 19th century, comparatists such as Fyodor Buslaev were chiefly concerned with deducing the purported Zeitgeist or &quot;spirit of the times&quot;, which they assumed to be embodied in the literary output of each nation. Although many comparative works from this period would be judged chauvinistic, Eurocentric, or even racist by present-day standards, the intention of most scholars during this period was to increase the understanding of other cultures, not to assert superiority over them (although politicians and others from outside the field sometimes used their works for this purpose).

==French School==

From the early part of the 20th century until the Second World War, the field was characterised by a notably empiricist and positivist approach, termed the &quot;French School&quot;, in which scholars like Paul Van Tiegham examined works forensically, looking for evidence of &quot;origins&quot; and &quot;influences&quot; between works from different nations often termed &quot;rapport des faits&quot;. Thus a scholar might attempt to trace how a particular literary idea or motif traveled between nations over time. In the French School of Comparative Literature, the study of influences and mentalities dominates. Today, the French School practices the nation-state approach of the discipline although it also promotes the approach of a &quot;European Comparative Literature&quot;. The publications from this school include, &quot;La Littérature Comparée&quot; (1967) by C. Pichois and A.M. Rousseau, &quot;La Critique Littéraire&quot; (1969) by J.-C. Carloni and Jean Filloux and &quot;La Littérature Comparée&quot; (1989) by Yves Cheverel, translated into English as &quot;Comparative Literature Today: Methods &amp; Perspectives&quot; (1995).

==German School==

Like the French School, German Comparative Literature has its origins in the late 19th century. After World War II, the discipline developed to a large extent owing to one scholar in particular, Peter Szondi (1929–1971), a Hungarian who taught at the Free University Berlin. Szondi&#x27;s work in Allgemeine und Vergleichende Literaturwissenschaft (German for &quot;General and Comparative Literary Studies&quot;) included the genre of drama, lyric (in particular hermetic) poetry, and hermeneutics: &quot;Szondi&#x27;s vision of Allgemeine und Vergleichende Literaturwissenschaft became evident in both his policy of inviting international guest speakers to Berlin and his introductions to their talks. Szondi welcomed, among others, Jacques Derrida (before he attained worldwide recognition), Pierre Bourdieu and Lucien Goldman from France, Paul de Man from Zürich, Gershom Sholem from Jerusalem, Theodor W. Adorno from Frankfurt, Hans Robert Jauss from the then young University of Konstanz, and from the US René Wellek, Geoffrey Hartman and Peter Demetz (all at Yale), along with the liberal publicist Lionel Trilling. The names of these visiting scholars, who form a programmatic network and a methodological canon, epitomize Szondi&#x27;s conception of comparative literature. However, German comparatists working in East Germany were not invited, nor were recognized colleagues from France or the Netherlands. Yet while he was oriented towards the West and the new allies of West Germany and paid little attention to comparatists in Eastern Europe, his conception of a transnational (and transatlantic) comparative literature was very much influenced by East European literary theorists of the Russian and Prague schools of structuralism, from whose works René Wellek, too, derived many of his concepts. These concepts continue to have profound implications for comparative literary theory today&quot; ... A manual published by the department of comparative literature at the LMU Munich lists 31 German departments which offer a diploma in comparative literature in Germany, albeit some only as a &#x27;minor&#x27;. These are: Augsburg, Bayreuth, Free University Berlin, Technische Universität Berlin, Bochum, Bonn, Chemnitz-Zwickau, Erfurt, Erlangen-Nürnberg, Essen, Frankfurt am Main, Frankfurt an der Oder, Gießen, Göttingen, Jena, Karlsruhe, Kassel, Konstanz, Leipzig, Mainz, München, Münster, Osnabrück, Paderborn, Potsdam, Rostock, Saarbrücken, Siegen, Stuttgart, Tübingen, Wuppertal. (Der kleine Komparatist [2003]). This situation is undergoing rapid change, however, since many universities are adapting to the new requirements of the recently introduced Bachelor and Master of Arts. German comparative literature is being squeezed by the traditional philologies on the one hand and more vocational programmes of study on the other which seek to offer students the practical knowledge they need for the working world (e.g., &#x27;Applied Literature&#x27;). With German universities no longer educating their students primarily for an academic market, the necessity of a more vocational approach is becoming ever more evident&quot;.

==American (US) School==
Reacting to the French School, postwar scholars, collectively termed the &quot;American School&quot;, sought to return the field to matters more directly concerned with literary criticism, de-emphasising the detective work and detailed historical research that the French School had demanded. The American School was more closely aligned with the original internationalist visions of Goethe and Posnett (arguably reflecting the postwar desire for international cooperation), looking for examples of universal human truths based on the literary archetypes that appeared throughout literatures from all times and places.

Prior to the advent of the American School, the scope of comparative literature in the West was typically limited to the literatures of Western Europe and Anglo-America, predominantly literature in English, German and French literature, with occasional forays into Italian literature (primarily for Dante) and Spanish literature (primarily for Miguel de Cervantes). One monument to the approach of this period is Erich Auerbach&#x27;s book &quot;&quot;, a survey of techniques of realism in texts whose origins span several continents and three thousand years.

The approach of the American School would be familiar to current practitioners of cultural studies and is even claimed by some to be the forerunner of the Cultural Studies boom in universities during the 1970s and 1980s. The field today is highly diverse: for example, comparatists routinely study Chinese literature, Arabic literature and the literatures of most other major world languages and regions as well as English and continental European literatures.

==Current developments==
There is a movement among comparativists in the United States and elsewhere to re-focus the discipline away from the nation-based approach with which it has previously been associated towards a cross-cultural approach that pays no heed to national borders. Works of this nature include Alamgir Hashmi&#x27;s &quot;The Commonwealth, Comparative Literature and the World&quot;, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Discipline&quot;, David Damrosch&#x27;s &quot;What is World Literature?&quot;, Steven Tötösy de Zepetnek&#x27;s concept of &quot;comparative cultural studies&quot;, and Pascale Casanova&#x27;s &quot;The World Republic of Letters&quot;. It remains to be seen whether this approach will prove successful given that comparative literature had its roots in nation-based thinking and much of the literature under study still concerns issues of the nation-state. Given developments in the studies of globalization and interculturalism, comparative literature, already representing a wider study than the single-language nation-state approach, may be well suited to move away from the paradigm of the nation-state. Joseph Hankinson&#x27;s stress on comparison&#x27;s &#x27;affiliative&#x27; potential is one recent effort in this direction. While in the West comparative literature is experiencing institutional constriction, there are signs that in many parts of the world the discipline is thriving, especially in Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean, and the Mediterranean. Current trends in Transnational studies also reflect the growing importance of post-colonial literary figures such as J. M. Coetzee, Maryse Condé, Earl Lovelace, V. S. Naipaul, Michael Ondaatje, Wole Soyinka, Derek Walcott, and Lasana M. Sekou.

Giulia De Gasperi &amp; Joseph Pivato (2018). In response to Pivato Canadian comparatists Susan Ingram and Irene Sywenky co-edited &quot;Comparative Literature in Canada: Contemporary Scholarship, Pedagogy, and Publishing in Review&quot; (2019), an initiative of the Canadian Comparative Literature Association.

<text>Heatmiser was an American rock band, formed in Portland, Oregon, in October 1991. Consisting of Elliott Smith (guitar and vocals), Neil Gust (guitar and vocals), Brandt Peterson (bass; later replaced by Sam Coomes, frontman of Quasi) and Tony Lash (drums), they were known for their well-crafted lyrics and songs often featuring the juxtaposition of melancholic and cheery words and melodies. The pop-oriented songs of Elliott Smith were a contrast to the darker songs of Neil Gust, while both Smith&#x27;s and Gust&#x27;s songs touched on subjects such as anger, alienation, loneliness and despair.

== History ==
=== Pre-Heatmiser early years (1987–1990) ===

In 1987, while both of them were attending classes at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, Neil Gust and Elliott Smith met and formed a band, Swimming Jesus. In addition to covers of songs by Ringo Starr and Elvis Costello, the pair performed original songs in clubs in nearby Northampton. The two were prolific: besides Swimming Jesus, Gust and Smith had another pre-Heatmiser college band, featuring &quot;a friend named Dylan and two others&quot;, and recorded &quot;stupid and embarrassing&quot; music on rented four-track recorders with &quot;poetry on top&quot;, recited by a &quot;Southern Californian stoner-photographer guy&quot; friend.

=== Heatmiser early years: &quot;Dead Air&quot; and &quot;Cop and Speeder&quot; (1991–1993) ===

Following their graduation from Hampshire College in 1991, Gust and Smith returned to Portland, Oregon. In Portland, Gust and Smith formed Heatmiser with Smith&#x27;s high school friend Tony Lash, who&#x27;d been working at a recording studio and playing drums in local band Nero&#x27;s Rome. Early versions of Heatmiser included Jason Hornick. In high school, Lash and Smith played together in the school band—Lash played flute, Smith played clarinet—and Lash played drums in Smith&#x27;s band Stranger Than Fiction. Lash and Smith had bonded over a mutual love of Rush, and outside of their high school band class, they began to work out &quot;insanely complicated songs&quot; together, recording after school with Eric Hedford, future Dandy Warhols drummer. Tony Lash recalled about recording with Hedford: &quot;We recorded all the backing band tracks for [Stranger Than Fiction&#x27;s] &quot;Still Waters More or Less&quot; at Eric Hedford&#x27;s house in 1985–86. He had a basement with drums, mics, a piano, and a mixer. He helped us set up, but he didn&#x27;t play on any of it.&quot;

With Heatmiser in need of a bassist, a high school friend suggested Brandt Peterson to fill the position. Peterson had played in a few punk bands, but &quot;was feeling ambivalent about another.&quot; Smith convinced him to join Heatmiser, at least until their February 14, 1992 live debut at Portland&#x27;s X-Ray Cafe. Over the next few years, Heatmiser was a regular act at local Portland venues like the X-Ray Cafe, screenprinting shop Hand Prints, and La Luna, whose cheap, packed Monday night concerts were a hub for the city&#x27;s twenty-something underground social scene.

Brandt Peterson played bass on the albums &quot;Dead Air&quot; and &quot;Cop and Speeder&quot;, the &quot;Yellow No. 5&quot; EP, and several singles. He wrote at least two songs for Heatmiser: &quot;Just a Little Prick&quot;, released on &quot;The Music of Heatmiser&quot;, and &quot;Glamourine&quot;, a &quot;bass-line with lyrics&quot; that remains unreleased. Peterson did a cover design for the &quot;Yellow No. 5&quot; EP that ultimately wasn&#x27;t used; additionally, he did the cover art for &quot;Dead Air&quot;.

=== Later years: line-up changes and &quot;Mic City Sons&quot; (1994–1996) ===

Peterson left the band in August 1994 and was replaced by Sam Coomes, a friend of Smith&#x27;s. Coomes played on Heatmiser&#x27;s last album, &quot;Mic City Sons&quot;, and on tour. Coomes has a modest view of his contributions to the album: &quot;There&#x27;s two levels of playing for me [on &quot;Mic City Sons&quot;],&quot; he added, laughing. &quot;Decent and could be better.&quot; After Peterson&#x27;s departure, the band &quot;struggled [on tour] to draw the same crowds they&#x27;d built in Portland. They played wherever they could, even a laundromat.&quot;

Smith discussed Coomes&#x27; entry into the band:
Regarding his friendships with Neil Gust and Tony Lash, Smith recalled:
Discussing the tension in the band, Peterson later recalled: 
Lash also recalled his memories of the band&#x27;s tense relationship while recording &quot;Mic City Sons&quot;, and their eventual breakup:
Lash left Heatmiser in late 1996, prior to what would be their final tour. John Moen (later of The Decemberists) was brought in to play drums.

Regarding &quot;Mic City Sons&quot;, Coomes said:
Lash recalled:
Gust stated: 
=== Disbandment ===

The band broke up in the fall of 1996, prior to the release of their third and last album, &quot;Mic City Sons&quot;. &quot;It was kind of ridiculous to carry it up to a certain point and then drop the ball or the bomb, like quitting the band right after we had signed to Virgin,&quot; recalled Smith. &quot;I was the guy who made that gravy-train crash so to speak, and it was a gravy-train at the time. The breakup happened almost immediately after the contract was signed. I watched myself put my paw in the bear trap on that one because there was this clause about leaving members. In the event of the band dissolving, any members could be kept to that contract with or without their consent under the same terms. They didn&#x27;t pick up Neil&#x27;s option, only mine. It turned out to be a fucked-up situation because they said the reason they had signed Heatmiser was that they&#x27;d been hoping this [the breakup] would happen-or something to that effect. They said that right in front of Neil and I couldn&#x27;t believe it.&quot;

The recording sessions for &quot;Mic City Sons&quot; also &quot;found the band dissolving. Smith had his solo career to tend. Gust spent time in the house [the band had rented for recording] alone, learning to work the studio; as engineer, Lash felt he&#x27;d become an &#x27;obstacle&#x27; to Smith, who wanted to bring in Beck producers Rob Schnapf and Tom Rothrock to shepherd the sessions. The buffer of the new producers helped bring the album together, but at some point in 1996, the band fell apart. &quot;Mic City Sons&quot; was released on a smaller Virgin sister label, Caroline, and slipped into the world quietly.&quot;

Going on unemployment after losing a bakery side-job had given Smith more time to devote to recording, which also shifted his focus away from Heatmiser and toward his own solo music endeavors. Gust recalled: &quot;That was like the state giving [him] a grant because for a year, he didn&#x27;t work. All he did was record at his girlfriend&#x27;s house. His process just went &#x27;boom!&#x27; It was amazing to watch. It was also intimidating because I was working, we had the band and there [were] things to deal with the band, but he just drifted into his own thing.&quot;
Despite Smith&#x27;s burgeoning solo career, there wasn&#x27;t tension between him and Gust. &quot;There was never any animosity between me and him about it, because it was art,&quot; Gust said. &quot;It only became problematic with scheduling stuff, if the band needed to go on tour or something. He had to give up on doing some things on his own to do it with the band and became less and less willing to do that.&quot;

After Heatmiser&#x27;s breakup, Smith and Lash &quot;didn&#x27;t talk for a couple years,&quot; Lash said, but they reconnected in London in 1999, as Smith toured for &quot;XO&quot; at the height of his post-Oscars fame, with Coomes in [his] backing band. And Gust had a new project, No. 2, that brought Smith and Lash together again. &quot;We hung out a little bit when he was working on the first No. 2 record. I started to get a feeling like, &#x27;Oh, you know, even if it wasn&#x27;t Heatmiser...&#x27; It was fun to think about the possibility of maybe doing something with him. So it was hard when that door was closed.&quot;

Gust went on to play in the band No. 2. Coomes carried on as half of Quasi, as well as working as a guest musician and producer for other bands, including Built to Spill, Sleater-Kinney, and Bugskull. Lash currently keeps himself busy as a producer. He produced the first two albums by The Dandy Warhols and he helped with the production of Death Cab for Cutie&#x27;s first two studio albums (&quot;Something About Airplanes&quot; and &quot;We Have the Facts and We&#x27;re Voting Yes&quot;). Peterson teaches anthropology at Michigan State University. Smith went on to a successful solo career before his death on October 21, 2003.

Neil Gust recalled that the last time that he saw Elliott Smith, in 2002, Smith said he wanted to make another Heatmiser record. The pair recorded just one new song together, &quot;Who&#x27;s Behind the Door?&quot;

Gust recalled how &quot;Who&#x27;s Behind the Door?&quot; came together in the studio and how that was the last session he shared with Smith before his passing in 2003:
== Artistry ==
=== Musical style ===

Heatmiser was labeled as a &quot;homocore&quot; or &quot;queercore&quot; band by the mainstream press, because of the themes espoused in the songs of the openly gay Gust. It was also speculated that Gust and Smith were lovers. Elliott Smith repeatedly denied this in interviews or that he was even gay. Smith also said that Gust&#x27;s being gay was &quot;not a big deal, [nor] anyone&#x27;s business&quot;.

Elliott Smith later dismissed the group&#x27;s music as &quot;loud&quot;, and his own singing on their first album as &quot;an embarrassment&quot;. Smith also bemoaned that being in Heatmiser changed the songs he was writing at the time into &quot;loud rock songs with no dynamic.&quot; Heatmiser also frustrated the members of the band. In an interview, Smith recalled:
Gust stated that touring behind their first album, &quot;Dead Air&quot;, meant that Heatmiser &quot;had to be this much more muscular, single-minded kind of band than we really felt any of us were interested in being.&quot;

JJ Gonson, Heatmiser&#x27;s manager (and later, Smith&#x27;s girlfriend) recalled her impressions of Heatmiser:
Their musical style has been described as indie rock, indie pop, alternative rock, and post-hardcore.

=== Performance style ===

Gonson spoke of the uniqueness of the 1990s Portland music scene in relation to Heatmiser:

Brendan Benson was the opening act for Heatmiser on their final tour. Reporter Jeff Stark&#x27;s &quot;SF Weekly&quot; article about a date on that tour, a December 1, 1996 show at San Francisco&#x27;s Bottom of the Hill club, recalled Smith as &quot;part charismatic rock star, part bar-band regular, oozing nonchalant confidence&quot;.

Heatmiser also had a less-serious side:
== Legacy ==

Later in his career, Smith believed that his blatant dismissal of the band in interviews for his solo albums hurt Neil Gust and led to discontent between them. The success of &quot;Roman Candle&quot; and &quot;Elliott Smith&quot; caused tensions in the band, especially between Smith and Gust, and led to the band&#x27;s break-up.

Gust has &quot;the fondest memories&quot; of the band, and he has stated that &quot;[his] view of the legacy of Heatmiser is those records. It was a great time in my life. It&#x27;s been something that has paid off in my life over and over, far more than it ever paid at the time.&quot; Tony Lash also looks back on his time in Heatmiser favorably: &quot;I have a lot of fond memories of that time. Portland still has an extremely vibrant music scene, but there was a bit more of a united, focused community with the bands and the people that came to see music then. La Luna, along with a few other places, was the epicenter of that, the place where the large shows happened. We definitely packed our shows, and people were really into it.&quot;

In 2013, photos taken by Gonson of Heatmiser appeared in the &quot;Elliott Smith: The Portland Years&quot; photo show and series.

<doc id="352960" wikidata="Q550675" url="?curid=352960" title="Hysterectomy">
<text>Hysterectomy is the surgical removal of the uterus and cervix. Supracervical hysterectomy refers to removal of the uterus while the cervix is spared. These procedures may also involve removal of the ovaries (oophorectomy), fallopian tubes (salpingectomy), and other surrounding structures. The term “partial” or “total” hysterectomy are lay-terms that incorrectly describe the addition or omission of oophorectomy at the time of hysterectomy. These procedures are usually performed by a gynecologist. Removal of the uterus renders the patient unable to bear children (as does removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes) and has surgical risks as well as long-term effects, so the surgery is normally recommended only when other treatment options are not available or have failed. It is the second most commonly performed gynecological surgical procedure, after cesarean section, in the United States. Nearly 68 percent were performed for conditions such as endometriosis, irregular bleeding, and uterine fibroids. It is expected that the frequency of hysterectomies for non-malignant indications will continue to fall given the development of alternative treatment options.

==Medical uses==
Hysterectomy is a major surgical procedure that has risks and benefits. It affects the hormonal balance and overall health of patients. Because of this, hysterectomy is normally recommended as a last resort after pharmaceutical or other surgical options have been exhausted to remedy certain intractable and severe uterine/reproductive system conditions. There may be other reasons for a hysterectomy to be requested. Such conditions and/or indications include, but are not limited to:
* Endometriosis: growth of the uterine lining outside the uterine cavity. This inappropriate tissue growth can lead to pain and bleeding.
* Adenomyosis: a form of endometriosis, where the uterine lining has grown into and sometimes through the uterine wall musculature. This can thicken the uterine walls and also contribute to pain and bleeding.
* Heavy menstrual bleeding: irregular or excessive menstrual bleeding for greater than a week. It can disturb regular quality of life and may be indicative of a more serious condition.
* Uterine fibroids: benign growths on the uterus wall. These muscular noncancerous tumors can grow in single form or in clusters and can cause extreme pain and bleeding.
* Uterine prolapse: when the uterus sags down due to weakened or stretched pelvic floor muscles potentially causing the uterus to protrude out of the vagina in more severe cases.
* Reproductive system cancer prevention: especially if there is a strong family history of reproductive system cancers (especially breast cancer in conjunction with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation), or as part of recovery from such cancers.
* Gynecologic cancer: depending on the type of hysterectomy, can aid in treatment of cancer or precancer of the endometrium, cervix, or uterus. In order to protect against or treat cancer of the ovaries, would need an oophorectomy.
* Transgender (trans) male affirmation: aids in gender dysphoria, prevention of future gynecologic problems, and transition to obtaining new legal gender documentation.
* Severe developmental disabilities: this treatment is controversial at best. In the United States, specific cases of sterilization due to developmental disabilities have been found by state-level Supreme Courts to violate the patient&#x27;s constitutional and common-law rights.
* Postpartum: to remove either a severe case of placenta praevia (a placenta that has either formed over or inside the birth canal) or placenta percreta (a placenta that has grown into and through the wall of the uterus to attach itself to other organs), as well as a last resort in case of excessive obstetrical haemorrhage.
* Chronic pelvic pain: should try to obtain pain etiology, although may have no known cause.
*PMS and menstrual pain and other psychic and physical conditions caused by menstrual period and causing suffering and diminishing life quality.

==Risks and adverse effects==
In 1995, the short-term mortality (within 40 days of surgery) was reported at 0.38 cases per 1000 when performed for benign causes. Risks for surgical complications were presence of fibroids, younger age (vascular pelvis with higher bleeding risk and larger uterus), dysfunctional uterine bleeding and parity.

The mortality rate is several times higher when performed in patients who are pregnant, have cancer or other complications.

Long-term effect on all case mortality is relatively small. Women under the age of 45 years have a significantly increased long-term mortality that is believed to be caused by the hormonal side effects of hysterectomy and prophylactic oophorectomy. This effect is not limited to pre-menopausal women; even women who have already entered menopause were shown to have experienced a decrease in long-term survivability post-oophorectomy.

Approximately 35% of women after hysterectomy undergo another related surgery within 2 years.

Ureteral injury is not uncommon and occurs in 0.2 per 1,000 cases of vaginal hysterectomy and 1.3 per 1,000 cases of abdominal hysterectomy. The injury usually occurs in the distal ureter close to the infundibulopelvic ligament or as a ureter crosses below the uterine artery, often from blind clamping and ligature placement to control hemorrhage.

===Recovery===
Hospital stay is 3 to 5 days or more for the abdominal procedure and between 1 and 2 days (but possibly longer) for vaginal or laparoscopically assisted vaginal procedures. After the procedure, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends not inserting anything into the vagina for the first 6 weeks (including inserting tampons or having sex).

===Unintended oophorectomy and premature ovarian failure===
Removal of one or both ovaries is performed in a substantial number of hysterectomies that were intended to be ovary sparing.

The average onset age of menopause after hysterectomy with ovarian conservation is 3.7 years earlier than average. This has been suggested to be due to the disruption of blood supply to the ovaries after a hysterectomy or due to missing endocrine feedback of the uterus. The function of the remaining ovaries is significantly affected in about 40% of people, some of them even require hormone replacement therapy. Surprisingly, a similar and only slightly weaker effect has been observed for endometrial ablation which is often considered as an alternative to hysterectomy.

A substantial number of women develop benign ovarian cysts after a hysterectomy.

===Effects on sexual life and pelvic pain===
After hysterectomy for benign indications the majority of patients report improvement in sexual life and pelvic pain. A smaller share of patients report worsening of sexual life and other problems. The picture is significantly different for hysterectomy performed for malignant reasons; the procedure is often more radical with substantial side effects. A proportion of patients who undergo a hysterectomy for chronic pelvic pain continue to have pelvic pain after a hysterectomy and develop dyspareunia (painful sexual intercourse).

===Premature menopause and its effects===
Estrogen levels fall sharply when the ovaries are removed, removing the protective effects of estrogen on the cardiovascular and skeletal systems. This condition is often referred to as &quot;surgical menopause&quot;, although it is substantially different from a naturally occurring menopausal state; the former is a sudden hormonal shock to the body that causes rapid onset of menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes, while the latter is a gradually occurring decrease of hormonal levels over a period of years with uterus intact and ovaries able to produce hormones even after the cessation of menstrual periods.

One study showed that risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease is substantially increased for women who had hysterectomy at age 50 or younger. No association was found for women undergoing the procedure after age 50. The risk is higher when ovaries are removed but still noticeable even when ovaries are preserved.

Several other studies have found that osteoporosis (decrease in bone density) and increased risk of bone fractures are associated with hysterectomies. This has been attributed to the modulatory effect of estrogen on calcium metabolism and the drop in serum estrogen levels after menopause can cause excessive loss of calcium leading to bone wasting.

Hysterectomies have also been linked with higher rates of heart disease and weakened bones. Those who have undergone a hysterectomy with both ovaries removed typically have reduced testosterone levels as compared to those left intact. Reduced levels of testosterone in women are predictive of height loss, which may occur as a result of reduced bone density, while increased testosterone levels in women are associated with a greater sense of sexual desire.

Oophorectomy before the age of 45 is associated with a fivefold mortality from neurologic and mental disorders.

===Urinary incontinence and vaginal prolapse===
Urinary incontinence and vaginal prolapse are well known adverse effects that develop with high frequency a very long time after the surgery. Typically, those complications develop 10–20 years after the surgery. For this reason exact numbers are not known, and risk factors are poorly understood. It is also unknown if the choice of surgical technique has any effect. It has been assessed that the risk for urinary incontinence is approximately doubled within 20 years after hysterectomy. One long-term study found a 2.4 fold increased risk for surgery to correct urinary stress incontinence following hysterectomy.

The risk for vaginal prolapse depends on factors such as number of vaginal deliveries, the difficulty of those deliveries, and the type of labor. Overall incidence is approximately doubled after hysterectomy.

===Adhesion formation and bowel obstruction===
The formation of postoperative adhesions is a particular risk after hysterectomy because of the extent of dissection involved as well as the fact the hysterectomy wound is in the most gravity-dependent part of the pelvis into which a loop of bowel may easily fall. In one review, incidence of small bowel obstruction due to intestinal adhesion was found to be 15.6% in non-laparoscopic total abdominal hysterectomies vs. 0.0% in laparoscopic hysterectomies.

===Wound infection===
Wound infection occurs in approximately 3% of cases of abdominal hysterectomy. The risk is increased by obesity, diabetes, immunodeficiency disorder, use of systemic corticosteroids, smoking, wound hematoma, and preexisting infection such as chorioamnionitis and pelvic inflammatory disease. Such wound infections mainly take the form of either incisional abscess or wound cellulitis. Typically, both confer erythema, but only an incisional abscess confers purulent drainage. The recommended treatment of an incisional abscess after hysterectomy is by incision and drainage, and then coverage by a thin layer of gauze followed by sterile dressing. The dressing should be changed and the wound irrigated with normal saline at least twice each day. In addition, it is recommended to administer an antibiotic active against staphylococci and streptococci, preferably vancomycin when there is a risk of MRSA. The wound can be allowed to close by secondary intention. Alternatively, if the infection is cleared and healthy granulation tissue is evident at the base of the wound, the edges of the incision may be reapproximated, such as by using butterfly stitches, staples or sutures. Sexual intercourse remains possible after hysterectomy. Reconstructive surgery remains an option for women who have experienced benign and malignant conditions. 

===Other rare problems===
Hysterectomy may cause an increased risk of the relatively rare renal cell carcinoma. The increased risk is particularly pronounced for young women; the risk was lower after vaginally performed hysterectomies. Hormonal effects or injury of the ureter were considered as possible explanations. In some cases the renal cell carcinoma may be a manifestation of an undiagnosed hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome.

Removal of the uterus without removing the ovaries can produce a situation that on rare occasions can result in ectopic pregnancy due to an undetected fertilization that had yet to descend into the uterus before surgery. Two cases have been identified and profiled in an issue of the &quot;Blackwell Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology&quot;; over 20 other cases have been discussed in additional medical literature. On very rare occasions, sexual intercourse after hysterectomy may cause a transvaginal evisceration of the small bowel. The vaginal cuff is the uppermost region of the vagina that has been sutured closed. A rare complication, it can dehisce and allow the evisceration of the small bowel into the vagina.

==Alternatives==

Depending on the indication there are alternatives to hysterectomy:

===Heavy bleeding===
Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices are highly effective at controlling dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) or menorrhagia and should be considered before any surgery.

Menorrhagia (heavy or abnormal menstrual bleeding) may also be treated with the less invasive endometrial ablation which is an outpatient procedure in which the lining of the uterus is destroyed with heat, mechanically or by radio frequency ablation. Endometrial ablation greatly reduces or eliminates monthly bleeding in ninety percent of patients with DUB. It is not effective for patients with very thick uterine lining or uterine fibroids.

===Uterine fibroids===
Levonorgestrel intrauterine devices are highly effective in limiting menstrual blood flow and improving other symptoms. Side effects are typically very moderate because the levonorgestrel (a progestin) is released in low concentration locally. There is now substantial evidence that Levongestrel-IUDs provide good symptomatic relief for women with fibroids.

Uterine fibroids may be removed and the uterus reconstructed in a procedure called &quot;myomectomy&quot;. A myomectomy may be performed through an open incision, laparoscopically, or through the vagina (hysteroscopy).

&quot;Uterine artery embolization&quot; (UAE) is a minimally invasive procedure for treatment of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the femoral artery at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine artery. A mass of microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block the flow of blood through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.

Uterine fibroids can be removed with a non-invasive procedure called Magnetic Resonance guided Focused Ultrasound (MRgFUS).

===Uterine prolapse===
Prolapse may also be corrected surgically without removal of the uterus. There are several strategies that can be utilized to help strengthen pelvic floor muscles and prevent the worsening of prolapse. These include, but are not limited to, use of &quot;kegel exercises&quot;, vaginal pessary, constipation relief, weight management, and care when lifting heavy objects.

==Types==
Hysterectomy, in the literal sense of the word, means merely removal of the uterus. However other organs such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, and the cervix are very frequently removed as part of the surgery.
* Radical hysterectomy: complete removal of the uterus, cervix, upper vagina, and parametrium. Indicated for cancer. Lymph nodes, ovaries, and fallopian tubes are also usually removed in this situation, such as in &quot;&quot;.
* Total hysterectomy: complete removal of the uterus and cervix, with or without oophorectomy.
* Subtotal hysterectomy: removal of the uterus, leaving the cervix in situ.

Subtotal (supracervical) hysterectomy was originally proposed with the expectation that it may improve sexual functioning after hysterectomy, it has been postulated that removing the cervix causes excessive neurologic and anatomic disruption, thus leading to vaginal shortening, vaginal vault prolapse, and vaginal cuff granulations. These theoretical advantages were not confirmed in practice, but other advantages over total hysterectomy emerged. The principal disadvantage is that risk of cervical cancer is not eliminated and women may continue cyclical bleeding (although substantially less than before the surgery).
These issues were addressed in a systematic review of total versus supracervical hysterectomy for benign gynecological conditions, which reported the following findings:
* There was no difference in the rates of incontinence, constipation, measures of sexual function, or alleviation of pre-surgery symptoms.
* Length of surgery and amount of blood lost during surgery were significantly reduced during supracervical hysterectomy compared to total hysterectomy, but there was no difference in post-operative transfusion rates.
* Febrile morbidity was less likely and ongoing cyclic vaginal bleeding one year after surgery was more likely after supracervical hysterectomy.
* There was no difference in the rates of other complications, recovery from surgery, or readmission rates.

In the short-term, randomized trials have shown that cervical preservation or removal does not affect the rate of subsequent pelvic organ prolapse.

Supracervical hysterectomy does not eliminate the possibility of having cervical cancer since the cervix itself is left intact and may be contraindicated in women with increased risk of this cancer; regular pap smears to check for cervical dysplasia or cancer are still needed.

==Technique==
Hysterectomy can be performed in different ways. The oldest known technique is vaginal hysterectomy. The first planned hysterectomy was performed by Konrad Johann Martin Langenbeck - Surgeon General of the Hannovarian army, although there are records of vaginal hysterectomy for prolapse going back as far as 50BC.

The first abdominal hysterectomy recorded was by Ephraim McDowell. He performed the procedure in 1809 for a mother of five for a large ovarian mass on her kitchen table.

In modern medicine today, laparoscopic vaginal (with additional instruments passing through ports in small abdominal incisions, close or in the navel) and total laparoscopic techniques have been developed.

===Abdominal hysterectomy===
Most hysterectomies in the United States are done via laparotomy (abdominal incision, not to be confused with laparoscopy). A transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision is made through the abdominal wall, usually above the pubic bone, as close to the upper hair line of the individual&#x27;s lower pelvis as possible, similar to the incision made for a caesarean section. This technique allows physicians the greatest access to the reproductive structures and is normally done for removal of the entire reproductive complex. The recovery time for an open hysterectomy is 4–6 weeks and sometimes longer due to the need to cut through the abdominal wall. Historically, the biggest problem with this technique was infections, but infection rates are well-controlled and not a major concern in modern medical practice. An open hysterectomy provides the most effective way to explore the abdominal cavity and perform complicated surgeries. Before the refinement of the vaginal and laparoscopic vaginal techniques, it was also the only possibility to achieve subtotal hysterectomy; meanwhile, the vaginal route is the preferable technique in most circumstances.

===Vaginal hysterectomy===
Vaginal hysterectomy is performed entirely through the vaginal canal and has clear advantages over abdominal surgery such as fewer complications, shorter hospital stays and shorter healing time. Abdominal hysterectomy, the most common method, is used in cases such as after caesarean delivery, when the indication is cancer, when complications are expected, or surgical exploration is required.

===Laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy===
With the development of laparoscopic techniques in the 1970s and 1980s, the &quot;laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy&quot; (LAVH) has gained great popularity among gynecologists because compared with the abdominal procedure it is less invasive and the post-operative recovery is much faster. It also allows better exploration and slightly more complicated surgeries than the vaginal procedure. LAVH begins with laparoscopy and is completed such that the final removal of the uterus (with or without removing the ovaries) is via the vaginal canal. Thus, LAVH is also a total hysterectomy; the cervix is removed with the uterus. If the cervix is removed along with the uterus, the upper portion of the vagina is sutured together and called the vaginal cuff.

===Laparoscopic-assisted supracervical hysterectomy===
The &quot;laparoscopic-assisted supracervical hysterectomy&quot; (LASH) was later developed to remove the uterus without removing the cervix using a morcellator which cuts the uterus into small pieces that can be removed from the abdominal cavity via the laparoscopic ports.

===Total laparoscopic hysterectomy===
Total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) was developed in the early 90s by Prabhat K. Ahluwalia in Upstate New York. TLH is performed solely through the laparoscopes in the abdomen, starting at the top of the uterus, typically with a uterine manipulator. The entire uterus is disconnected from its attachments using long thin instruments through the &quot;ports&quot;. Then all tissue to be removed is passed through the small abdominal incisions.

===Other techniques===
Supracervical (subtotal) laparoscopic hysterectomy (LSH) is performed similar to the total laparoscopic surgery but the uterus is amputated between the cervix and fundus.

Dual-port laparoscopy is a form of laparoscopic surgery using two 5 mm midline incisions: the uterus is detached through the two ports and removed through the vagina.

&quot;Robotic hysterectomy&quot; is a variant of laparoscopic surgery using special remotely controlled instruments that allow the surgeon finer control as well as three-dimensional magnified vision.

===Comparison of techniques===
Patient characteristics such as the reason for needing a hysterectomy, uterine size, descent of the uterus, presence of diseased tissues surrounding the uterus, previous surgery in the pelvic region, obesity, history of pregnancy, the possibility of endometriosis, or the need for an oophorectomy, will influence a surgeon&#x27;s surgical approach when performing a hysterectomy.

Vaginal hysterectomy is recommended over other variants where possible for women with benign diseases. Vaginal hysterectomy was shown to be superior to LAVH and some types of laparoscopic surgery causing fewer short- and long-term complications, more favorable effect on sexual experience with shorter recovery times and fewer costs.

Laparoscopic surgery offers certain advantages when vaginal surgery is not possible but also has the disadvantage of significantly longer time required for the surgery.

In one 2004 study conducted in the UK comparing abdominal (laparotomic) and laparoscopic techniques, laparoscopic surgery was found to cause longer operation time and a higher rate of major complications while offering much quicker healing. In another study conducted in 2014, laparoscopy was found to be &quot;a safe alternative to laparotomy&quot; in patients receiving total hysterectomy for endometrial cancer. Researchers concluded the procedure &quot;offers markedly improved perioperative outcomes with a lower reoperation rate and fewer postoperative complications when the standard of care shifts from open surgery to laparoscopy in a university hospital&quot;.

The abdominal technique is very often applied in difficult circumstances or when complications are expected. Given these circumstances the complication rate and time required for surgery compares very favorably with other techniques, however time required for healing is much longer.

Hysterectomy by abdominal laparotomy is correlated with much higher incidence of intestinal adhesions than other techniques.

Time required for completion of surgery in the eVAL trial is reported as follows:
* abdominal 55.2 minutes average, range 19–155
* vaginal 46.6 minutes average, range 14–168
* laparoscopic (all variants) 82.5 minutes average, range 10–325 (combined data from both trial arms)

Morcellation has been widely used especially in laparoscopic techniques and sometimes for the vaginal technique, but now appears to be associated with a considerable risk of spreading benign or malignant tumors. In April 2014, the FDA issued a memo alerting medical practitioners to the risks of power morcellation.

Robotic assisted surgery is presently used in several countries for hysterectomies. Additional research is required to determine the benefits and risks involved, compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery.

A 2014 Cochrane review found that robotic assisted surgery may have a similar complication rate when compared to conventional laparoscopic surgery. In addition, there is evidence to suggest that although the surgery make take longer, robotic assisted surgery may result in shorter hospital stays. More research is necessary to determine if robotic assisted hysterectomies are beneficial for people with cancer.

Previously reported marginal advantages of robotic assisted surgery could not be confirmed; only differences in hospital stay and cost remain statistically significant. In addition, concerns over widespread misleading marketing claims have been raised.
==Incidence==

===Canada===
In Canada, the number of hysterectomies between 2008 and 2009 was almost 47,000. The national rate for the same timeline was 338 per 100,000 population, down from 484 per 100,000 in 1997. The reasons for hysterectomies differed depending on whether the woman was living in an urban or rural location. Urban women opted for hysterectomies due to uterine fibroids and rural women had hysterectomies mostly for menstrual disorders.

===United States===
Hysterectomy is the second most common major surgery among women in the United States (the first is cesarean section). In the 1980s and 1990s, this statistic was the source of concern among some consumer rights groups and puzzlement among the medical community, and brought about informed choice advocacy groups like Hysterectomy Educational Resources and Services (HERS) Foundation, founded by Nora W. Coffey in 1982.

According to the National Center for Health Statistics, of the 617,000 hysterectomies performed in 2004, 73% also involved the surgical removal of the ovaries. There are currently an estimated 22 million women in the United States who have undergone this procedure. Nearly 68 percent were performed for benign conditions such as endometriosis, irregular bleeding and uterine fibroids. Such rates being highest in the industrialized world has led to the controversy that hysterectomies are being largely performed for unwarranted reasons. More recent data suggests that the number of hysterectomies performed has declined in every state in the United States. From 2010 to 2013, there were 12 percent fewer hysterectomies performed, and the types of hysterectomies were more minimally invasive in nature, reflected by a 17 percent increase in laparoscopic procedures.

===United Kingdom===
In the UK, 1 in 5 women is likely to have a hysterectomy by the age of 60, and ovaries are removed in about 20% of hysterectomies.

===Germany===
The number of hysterectomies in Germany has been constant for many years. In 2006, 149,456 hysterectomies were performed. Additionally, of these, 126,743 (84.8%) successfully benefitted the patient without incident. Women between the ages of 40 and 49 accounted for 50 percent of hysterectomies, and those between the ages of 50 and 59 accounted for 20 percent. In 2007, the number of hysterectomies decreased to 138,164. In recent years, the technique of laparoscopic or laparoscopically assisted hysterectomies has been raised into the foreground.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, the number of hysterectomies from the 1980s to the 1990s decreased by 38 percent. In 1988, there were 173 such surgeries per 100,000 women, and by 1998 this number had been reduced to 107. The proportion of abdominal supracervical hysterectomies in the same time period grew from 7.5 to 41 percent. A total of 67,096 women underwent hysterectomy during these years.

<text>Ian Lindsay Tuxworth (18 June 1942 – 21 January 2020) was an Australian politician, who was Chief Minister of the Northern Territory of Australia from 17 October 1984 until his resignation on 10 May 1986.

==Early life==
Tuxworth was born on 18 June 1942 in Wollongong, New South Wales, to Lindsay and historian Hilda Elsie Tuxworth, and moved with his family to Tennant Creek in 1951. He was educated at Tennant Creek Primary School, and Rostrevor College in Adelaide.

Before entering politics, Tuxworth, known affectionately as &quot;Slim&quot;, started a soft drink factory in Tennant Creek, called Crystal Waters, with his father and brother Robert (Bob), which was later sold to Coca-Cola Amatil. Tuxworth also played baseball and was a member of the 1975 North Australian Kiewaldt team.

==Member of the Legislative Assembly==


|}

Tuxworth was elected as the Country Liberal Party (CLP) member for the electoral division of Barkly (which included Tennant Creek), in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly at its inaugural election in 1974. As the representative for Barkly, Tuxworth was instrumental in facilitating the government support for the construction of the Mary Ann Dam, north of the town of Tennant Creek.

Following the resignation of Paul Everingham, Tuxworth was elected Chief Minister on 17 October 1984. In 1985, he opposed the federal government&#x27;s transfer of the ownership of Uluru to its traditional owners, the Aṉangu people and boycotted the hand-over ceremony. However, 30 years later, he acknowledged the hand-back had been a success. He resigned as Chief Minister and from the CLP on 10 May 1986 to form the NT Nationals party

At the 1987 election Tuxworth was elected as the NT Nationals member for Barkly by 19 votes. His victory was annulled by the Court of Disputed Returns after a successful challenge from losing independent candidate Maggie Hickey. On 5 September 1987, he won a by-election, again defeating Hickey, who was then representing the Labor Party (ALP). After a redistribution turned Barkly into a nominally Labor-held seat, Tuxworth stood unsuccessfully for the seat of Goyder at the 1990 election.

Tuxworth became the first CLP leader not to lead the party to an election. Until Natasha Fyles&#x27; resignation in 2023, Tuxworth was the only Chief Minister who never faced an election.

==After politics==
Following his defeat, Tuxworth moved to Perth, Western Australia, where he died on 21 January 2020, aged 77. He was survived by his wife Ruth, children Sonia, Guy and Gemma, and eight grandchildren.

<text>Benjamin Jerome Cayetano (born November 14, 1939) is an American politician and author who served as the fifth governor of the State of Hawaii from 1994 to 2002. He is the first Filipino American to serve as a state governor in the United States.

== Early years ==
Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, Cayetano was estranged from his mother at a young age. Cayetano was raised by his father in Kalihi, an ethnic Filipino neighborhood west of downtown Honolulu. He would grow up as a latchkey child. In Kalihi, he attended Wallace Rider Farrington High School, a public school aptly known locally as &quot;Home of the Governors&quot; as its buildings were named after several early Hawaii statesmen. The school was only a few blocks from his home. Cayetano received poor grades throughout his years at Farrington and was often disciplined by his teachers and counselors. He barely made marks qualifying him to graduate.

Upon graduation Cayetano married Lorraine Gueco, his high school sweetheart. After the birth of his son Brandon in 1959, he worked a variety of entry-level jobs, such as a metal-packer in a junkyard, truck driver, apprentice electrician, and finally as a draftsman. Frustrated by what he felt were racially motivated and politically unfair hiring practices, he and his family moved to Los Angeles, California in 1963 in pursuit of an education in law.

Cayetano attended Los Angeles Harbor College and transferred to the University of California, Los Angeles in 1966. In 1968, he graduated from UCLA with a major in political science and minor in American history. In 1971, he earned his Juris Doctor degree from Loyola Law School at the Loyola Marymount University.

In 1972, Cayetano was appointed to the Hawaii Housing Authority by Governor John A. Burns. In 1974, he was elected to the state house as a Democrat representing Pearl City.

== Lieutenant governor ==
Cayetano joined the John D. Waihe&#x27;e III gubernatorial ticket in 1986 and became the first Filipino American lieutenant governor in the United States. The Waihee–Cayetano ticket was re-elected to a second term in 1990. In his capacity as Hawaii&#x27;s lieutenant governor, Cayetano established the A+ Program, a state-funded, universal, after-school care program with chartered organizations at each public elementary school in Hawaii.

== Governor of Hawaii ==

Term limits forced Waihe&#x27;e into retirement and the Democratic Party nominated Cayetano to run for Governor of Hawaii in 1994. With attorney Mazie Hirono as his running mate, Cayetano was voted into office.

In 1998, Mayor of Maui Linda Lingle was nominated by the Republican Party to run against Cayetano on an agenda of government reform. For months leading into election day, Cayetano trailed Lingle in the major media polls. In the closest election in Hawaii&#x27;s history, Cayetano won a second term by a single percentage point validated by an official recount of ballots.

Throughout his tenure in office, Cayetano had to contend with economic uncertainty and serious fiscal problems. Declining tax revenues led to budget shortfalls, and the governor often found himself at odds with his fellow Democrats in the state legislature as he attempted to implement budget cuts to balance the state budget.

On education, the Cayetano administration built thirteen new schools, and he was able to persuade the teachers&#x27; union to extend the school year by seven days. Also under his administration, the University of Hawaii system gained autonomy over internal affairs. On the other hand, labor disputes with UH professors and public school teachers in April 2001 led to simultaneous strikes by both unions that crippled the state&#x27;s entire educational system for three weeks.

Cayetano left office in December 2002. He was succeeded by former Republican challenger Lingle.

== Mayoral race and rail issues ==
On January 19, 2012, Cayetano came out of retirement to run for the office of Honolulu Mayor. Cayetano&#x27;s stated focus in his mayoral campaign was greater transparency in local government, but its core was ending the Honolulu Rail Transit Project, a plan to build a 20-mile elevated steel on steel rail system in the city. In the primary election on August 11, 2012, he received more votes than either of his pro-rail primary opponents, Kirk Caldwell and Peter Carlisle. He did not achieve the majority required to win the election outright, and faced Caldwell in the general election on November 6. Cayetano subsequently lost the mayoral election to Kirk Caldwell, in a vote that was widely viewed as a referendum on the rail project. He continued his opposition to the rail, in 2017 urging the Federal Transit Authority to terminate further funding for it. In an ad paid for by the Abigail Kapiolani Kawānanakoa Foundation, Cayetano asked President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao to withhold $800 million for the project.

== Personal life ==

Cayetano and his first wife, Lorraine Cayetano (née Gueco), divorced in 1996, ending their 37-year marriage. He became the first sitting governor of Hawaii to divorce while in office.

Cayetano is married to his second wife, Vicky Cayetano (née Tiu), whom he married on May 5, 1997. Vicky was president of United Laundry Services at the time of their wedding. She played a major supporting role opposite Elvis Presley in the musical film, &quot;It Happened at the World&#x27;s Fair&quot;.

Ben Cayetano has five children. He has three children from his first marriage to Lorraine Cayetano: Brandon, Janeen, and Samantha. Vicky Cayetano also has two children, Marissa and William, from a previous marriage.

He appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;Baywatch Hawaii&quot; in 1999.

<doc id="352980" wikidata="Q1902766" url="?curid=352980" title="Marshall Perron">
<text>Marshall Bruce Perron (born 5 February 1942) is a former Australian politician, who was Chief Minister of the Northern Territory from 1988 to 1995. He served as a Country Liberal Party member of the Legislative Assembly in the Northern Territory from the formation of the Assembly in 1974 until his resignation in 1995. From 1975 to 1995, save for an 11-month break in 1986 and 1987, he served as a cabinet minister or its equivalent.

==Early life==
Perron was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1942. His family was from Darwin, but had been evacuated to Perth due to the threat of Japanese attack during World War II. Perron was born on 5 February, two weeks before the bombing of Darwin, and he would later jokingly blame &quot;the Japanese for denying him his birthright as a Territorian.&quot;

==Political career==


|}
Perron entered politics in 1974, when he was elected as a member of the first Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, which replaced the partly elected Legislative Council. He represented the division of Stuart Park for the Country Liberal Party.

After surviving Cyclone Tracy, a year later, Perron was promoted to cabinet. As self-government was not granted to the Northern Territory until 1978, until then the ministers under Majority Leaders Goff Letts and Paul Everingham were known as Executive Members. Perron joined Letts&#x27; executive in December 1975 as Executive Member for Municipal and Consumer Affairs and Cabinet Member for Education and Planning from 1976 to 1977.

After the 1977 election, Perron was named deputy leader of the CLP under Everingham, and hence became Deputy Majority Leader (deputy premier), also taking the Finance and Planning portfolio. From 1 July 1978, when self-government came into effect, Perron became Deputy Chief Minister, Treasurer and Minister for Lands and Housing until 1980 when he took the Industrial Development and Community Development portfolios instead of Lands and Housing, although he regained that position in 1982.

In 1982, Stuart Park was abolished in a redistribution, even as the size of the Assembly was increased from 19 to 25 seats. In the 1983 election, Perron stood for election in the division of Fannie Bay, which had absorbed most of Stuart Park in the redistribution. He won the seat from the incumbent Labor Party candidate Pam O&#x27;Neil.

In December 1984, Chief Minister Ian Tuxworth took on Perron&#x27;s role as Treasurer, with Perron taking the position of Attorney-General and Minister for Mines and Energy. Perron was Attorney-General when the discovery of a matinee jacket near Ayers Rock (Uluru) raised doubts about the conviction of Lindy Chamberlain for the alleged murder of her infant daughter Azaria. Perron announced Chamberlain&#x27;s immediate release from prison, and the establishment of a Royal Commission into the convictions of Lindy and her husband Michael. Perron returned to the backbench in May 1986, but returned in 1987 as Minister for Industries and Development under Stephen Hatton.

Perron became Chief Minister on 14 July 1988, after having rejected previous offers for the position. He also served as his own Treasurer, and was Minister for Police, Fire and Emergency Services from September 1989 until July 1994. He stayed in office for just under seven years, longer than any head of government in the Territory except Everingham. He restored a measure of stability to the government, which had seen three Chief Ministers in four years.

Perron faced his first electoral test at the 1990 Territory election. Although independent polls suggested that Labor had its first realistic chance of winning power since the granting of self-government, the election saw the CLP win its sixth term in government with a healthy nine-percent primary vote swing. CLP-commissioned polls conducted by social researcher Mark Textor predicted the CLP would win comfortably. He was reelected almost as easily in 1994.

An advocate for voluntary euthanasia, Perron was instrumental in devising the Rights of the Terminally Ill Bill which he introduced to Parliament on 22 February 1995. The bill was passed on 25 May, becoming the Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 and was enacted into law on 1 July 1996. Perron resigned as Chief Minister and retired from politics on the morning of the debate over the bill, maintaining that he did not want his position to influence the debate.

<text>Denis Gabriel Burke (born 22 September 1948) is a former Australian politician. A former Australian Army officer, he served as a Country Liberal Party member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly from 1994 to 2005. He spent two years as Chief Minister after succeeding Shane Stone, but oversaw the CLP&#x27;s defeat at the 2001 election, ending 27 years of continuous CLP government in the Northern Territory. Burke later served as Opposition Leader from 2001 to 2003 before being toppled, but was re-elected as leader in 2005. He subsequently took the party to defeat at the 2005 election, culminating in the shock loss of his own seat.

==Early life==
Burke was born in Townsville, Queensland, and entered the army as a national serviceman in 1969. In a 25-year career, he rose to become Commanding Officer of the Darwin-based 2nd Cavalry Regiment. His army career included overseas service with the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation (UNTSO) peacekeeping in the Middle East in 1984–85 (in Beirut, Lebanon and the Sinai peninsula in Egypt). He was a graduate of the Army Command and Staff College and served as an instructor in tactics at the United States Armor School, Fort Knox, Kentucky. Upon return to Australia, he was selected to be the first Army Instructor at the Royal Australian Navy Staff College at HMAS Penguin.

==Political rise==

In 1994, Burke left the army and entered politics, winning Country Liberal Party endorsement to contest the Palmerston-based seat of Brennan, at the expense of sitting member and Perron government minister Max Ortmann. Ortmann subsequently contested the seat as an independent, but was easily defeated by Burke.

Burke was first promoted to the Cabinet of the Northern Territory the following year, serving as Minister for Water and Power, for Work Health, and Minister Responsible for the Territory Insurance Office. He rose through the party, and in June 1996, was appointed Attorney-General and Minister for Health. He was re-elected at the 1997 election, and was once again promoted, taking on several more minor portfolios, as well as being appointed vice-president of the executive council. In early 1998, he was one of two Country Liberal Party parliamentary delegates to the territory&#x27;s Statehood Convention. In October 1998 he was appointed as the Leader of Government Business, and in December, took on a new set of responsibilities – among them industry, regional development, gaming and defence support.

==Chief Minister==
In February 1999, CLP Chief Minister Shane Stone resigned, and Burke was soon appointed as his replacement. He also continued on as Attorney-General, and took on several additional portfolios. Burke&#x27;s term as Chief Minister is probably most remembered for his vehement defence of the territory&#x27;s mandatory sentencing policy, which required a minimum of 90 days imprisonment after someone had been convicted three times, regardless of how minor the offence. Though it had been introduced by the Stone government, much of the controversy surrounding the laws fell to the new Burke government. The policy was eventually toned down slightly for juveniles after Prime Minister John Howard and federal Attorney-General Daryl Williams intervened. While the policy led to criticism from some prominent organisations, it also created a significant debate about the issue on a national level, and some national polls suggested that a majority of Australians supported the stand. However, Burke&#x27;s stance was also to lead to some scandal in late 2000, when he demanded the resignation of a magistrate (Alasdair McGregor) who had criticised his mandatory sentencing laws. The comments sparked contempt of court charges and angry criticism from the Chief Justice and the bar.

By the time Burke faced his first election at the 2001 election, the Country Liberal Party had been in power in the Northern Territory for 27 years. He called the election on a minor high, only weeks after the beginning of construction on the Adelaide-Darwin Railway, a major infrastructure project that had been planned for decades. However, his chances suffered a blow when a planned deal concerning gas from the Timor Sea, in which he had played a central role and which would have produced significant employment opportunities in the territory, ran into difficulties and had to be postponed. The deal was finalised shortly after the election. He also did himself no favours by not opposing a CLP party decision to preference the right-wing populist One Nation Party – which was considerably unpopular in the territory&#x27;s large ethnic community – over the left-wing Labor Party in five seats around Katherine. This had the effect of allowing ALP Opposition Leader Clare Martin to claim that the only way to resist One Nation influence was to vote for the ALP. Several weeks later, Burke apologised for the decision, admitting that the tactic had backfired and had cost him a number of votes.

In addition, the election fell against the backdrop of an ALP resurgence across the nation. In the preceding eighteen months, two Liberal state governments that had been thought highly secure (Victoria and Western Australia) had fallen to the ALP and two incumbent ALP governments had been easily re-elected. There was some speculation that the ALP could win their first NT election as in the sensitive electorate of Darwin&#x27;s Northern Suburbs the CLP had two retiring incumbents. Most commentators were predicting a close result, but suggesting that the CLP would be returned. However, in a shock result, the ALP achieved majority government by one seat, and Burke, suddenly out of government, became Opposition Leader.

==Fall, second coming, final fall and new beginnings==

As Opposition Leader, Burke struggled to get the better of Martin. He also presided over a disunited party that found it difficult to come to terms with being in opposition after spending almost its entire history in government. Amidst this environment, speculation soon began that Burke would step aside in favour of rival Terry Mills, who represented the nearby electorate of Blain. Burke was determined to remain leader, however, and fended off several leadership challenges by Mills, with the support of several influential MPs, such as Jodeen Carney. He was also briefly boosted by a victory in the 2003 Katherine by-election, despite a significant swing to Labor.

His support began to wane when he made comments on radio suggesting that he had tolerated marijuana use in his unit while an army officer, allegedly prompting the Chief of the Defence Forces, Peter Cosgrove, to call him a &quot;goose&quot;. While Cosgrove quickly backed away from the comment, it had nevertheless damaged his leadership. The final straw came when Burke refused to allow a conscience vote on the issue of lowering the age of consent for gay males from 18 years to 16. Mills promised Carney, Sue Carter, newcomers Fay Miller and Peter Maley that he would allow a conscience vote if elected leader which set the scene for Mills to launch a successful challenge to Burke&#x27;s leadership at the next party wing meeting.

After being toppled as leader, Burke&#x27;s political career seemed largely over. It had a sudden revival, however, when fourteen months later, Mills abruptly resigned from the leadership, stating he did not feel capable of leading the CLP into the election due that year. Burke nominated for the vacancy in the absence of anyone else, and was unanimously reelected on 7 February 2005.

He was almost immediately faced with readying the CLP for an election that was called four months later. The CLP was roundly defeated, falling to only four seats in the 25-member legislature. In the most shocking result of all, Burke lost his own seat to ALP challenger James Burke (no relation). There was virtually no hint that Burke was in any danger, as it is almost unheard of for a major-party leader at any level in Australia to be defeated in his own seat. Indeed, it had happened only one other time in the Territory&#x27;s history, when Goff Letts was ousted in his own seat in 1977 despite being Majority Leader (the equivalent of Chief Minister at the time).

Additionally, Labor had never come close to winning any seat in Palmerston in the Assembly&#x27;s history. Robertson Barracks, long a solid base of Army support for the CLP and particularly for Burke, had been redistributed out of the electorate. Even with the loss of the barracks, Burke still held Brennan with a seemingly insurmountable majority of 19 percent, making it the CLP&#x27;s safest seat. However, James Burke rolled him on a 20-point swing, which came as a shock even to Labor. Burke had promised to resign if he failed to win the election, but his unseating forced the CLP to immediately replace him with Carney. From 2007 to 2011, Burke worked in the United Arab Emirates as a high level Advisor to the Abu Dhabi Government.

==Family==

He is married with two children, Sam Burke (a former prosecutor with the Department of Public Prosecutions and now Ministerial Advisor to the Northern Territory Attorney General) and Tom Burke (lawyer at global law firm Linklaters and based in Moscow). He also has two daughters from his first marriage, Lisa and Angela. His second wife, Annette, was elected Mayor of Palmerston in 1998 and resigned in 2007 after winning consecutive elections. The Burkes returned to the Northern Territory in 2012 and reside in Darwin.

Sam Burke is married to Lia Finocchiaro who is the Leader of the Country Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition since 2020.

<text>Chen Jingrun (; 22 May 1933 – 19 March 1996), also known as Jing-Run Chen, was a Chinese mathematician who made significant contributions to number theory, including Chen&#x27;s theorem and the Chen prime.

==Life and career==
Chen was the third son in a large family from Fuzhou, Fujian, China. His father was a postal worker. Chen Jingrun graduated from the Mathematics Department of Xiamen University in 1953. His advisor at the Chinese Academy of Sciences was Hua Luogeng.

His work on the twin prime conjecture, Waring&#x27;s problem, Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture and Legendre&#x27;s conjecture led to progress in analytic number theory. In a 1966 paper he proved what is now called Chen&#x27;s theorem: every sufficiently large even number can be written as the sum of a prime and a semiprime (the product of two primes) – e.g., 100 = 23 + 7·11. Despite being persecuted during the Cultural Revolution, he expanded his proof in the 1970s.

After the end of the Cultural Revolution, Xu Chi wrote a biography of Chen entitled &quot;Goldbach&#x27;s Conjecture&quot; (). First published in &quot;People&#x27;s Literature&quot; in January 1978, it was reprinted on the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; a month later and became a national sensation. Chen became a household name in China and received a sackful of love letters from all over the country within two months.

Chen died of complications of pneumonia on 19 March 1996, at the age of 62 years.

==Legacy==

The asteroid 7681 Chenjingrun, discovered in 1996, was named after him.

In 1999, China issued an 80-cent postage stamp, titled &quot;The Best Result of Goldbach Conjecture,&quot; with a silhouette of Chen and the inequality:

: formula_1

Several statues in China have been built in memory of Chen. At Xiamen University, the names of Chen and four other mathematicians — Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Matti Jutila, Yuri Linnik, and Pan Chengdong — are inscribed in the marble slab behind Chen&#x27;s statue (see image).

<doc id="352986" wikidata="Q3249421" url="?curid=352986" title="Administrator of the Northern Territory">
<text>The administrator of the Northern Territory is an official appointed by the governor-general of Australia to represent the Crown in right of the Northern Territory. They perform functions similar to those of a state governor.

Strictly speaking, the appointment of an administrator is made by the governor-general acting on the advice of the Australian government, rather than the advice of the government of the Northern Territory. However, ministers have described the process as being based on &quot;advice from the Australian and Northern Territory governments&quot;.

Unlike an Australian state governor, the administrator is not the direct representative of the King in the Territory but is instead appointed by the King&#x27;s federal representative in Australia, the governor-general, to administer the Territory in accordance with the Act. In practice, however, the administrator performs a similar constitutional role to that of a state governor.

The administrator formally appoints the chief minister of the Northern Territory and the members of the Cabinet after every election. In all but a few cases, they are required by convention to act on the Cabinet&#x27;s advice. The Administrator gives royal assent to all bills passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Although the Governor-General (in practice, the Commonwealth Government) has the power to veto any territorial bill, in practice this right is almost never exercised.

The office of the deputy of the administrator was created in 1997.

In 2014, the governor-general granted current, future and living former administrators the title of &quot;The Honourable&quot; for life, following the lead of Governors-General and Governors of New South Wales in granting the title.

The present administrator is Hugh Heggie.

==Crest of administrator==
The crest of Administrator of the Northern Territory which is similar to the one used by the Governor-General of Australia except that the flower below the Crown is the Sturt Desert Rose, the floral emblem of the Northern Territory.

== South Australia (1863 to 1912) ==
On 6 July 1863, land now known as the Northern Territory was annexed to the Colony of South Australia. Legislation regulating the sale of land in the Northern Territory which was given assent on 12 November 1863 included provision for both the appointment of a Government Resident and a description of the powers of this office.

== Commonwealth of Australia (1912 to present) ==

Administrators and Government Residents of the Northern Territory after transfer of control to the Commonwealth Government:

=== Administrator (1912 to 1919) ===

=== Director (1919 to 1921) ===

=== Administrator (1921 to 1927) ===

=== Government Resident (1927 to 1931) ===

From 1926 to 1931, the Northern Territory was divided into the territories of Central Australia and North Australia, with the border at the 20th parallel south. Each territory was administered by a Government Resident located respectively in Alice Springs (then known as Stuart) and in Darwin. 
Both territories were reincorporated as the Northern Territory in 1931.

=== Administrator (1931 to present) ===

== Deputy of the Administrator (1997 to present) ==

The office of the &quot;Deputy of the Administrator&quot; was established in 1997.

<text>Shabbington is a village and civil parish in west Buckinghamshire, England, about west of Thame in neighbouring Oxfordshire, and southwest of Aylesbury. Named after Lord Steve Shabbington.

The village is close to the River Thame, which forms much of the southern boundary of the parish and also part of the county boundary with Oxfordshire. The parish has an area of .

==Toponym==
The toponym is derived from the Old English for &quot;Scobba&#x27;s farm&quot;. It appears as &quot;Sobintone&quot; in Domesday Book of 1086 and again in a record from the 14th century. It is spelt &quot;Shobindon&quot; in records from the 15th and 16th centuries. Until the Victorian era it was alternatively spelt &quot;Shobington&quot;; it was at about this time that the name changed to its current spelling.

==Manor==
In the reign of Edward the Confessor a Saxon thegn, Wigod of Wallingford, held the manor of Shabbington. In the Norman conquest of England, Wigod supported the invader William of Normandy and afterwards Wigod gave his daughter Ealdgyth in marriage to the Norman baron Robert D&#x27;Oyly, who had Wallingford Castle built. Ealdgyth bore D&#x27;Oyly no male heir so the D&#x27;Oyly estates passed to their daughter Maud or Matilda, and then to her first husband Miles Crispin, who may have been the first castellan of Wallingford Castle. Shabbington remained part of the Honour of Wallingford until the 16th century, when the Wallingford estates became part of the Honour of Ewelme.

After the Norman conquest, Shabbington Manor represented two knight&#x27;s fees. The tenancy was held by the Valognes family until 1299 when Joan de Valognes, widow of Robert de Grey, alienated the manor in free alms to the Knights Hospitaller of St. John of Jerusalem. Joan held the manor until her death in 1312, but in 1326–29 her grandson and heir John de Grey disputed the Hospitallers&#x27; tenure and successfully reclaimed the manor. John de Grey died in 1359 leaving Shabbington to his son John de Grey, 2nd Baron Grey de Rotherfield, to whom the Hospitallers surrendered their claim in 1360. Robert de Grey, 4th Baron Grey de Rotherfield died in 1388 with no male heir, so when his daughter Joan married John, Lord Deyncourt in 1401, Shabbington joined his estate of Wooburn Deyncourt.

In 1466 Shabbington was settled on Sir William Lovel, 7th Baron Morley, who in 1474 released the manor to feoffees including Richard Piggott, who in turn transferred it to other feoffees, of whom the principal was Richard Fowler. Fowler died in 1477; also Richard, was knighted in 1501 and sold Shabbington in 1515–18.

The buyer was John Clerke, who was later knighted and died in about 1540. In 1660 a later John Clerke was made the first Clerke Baronet, of Hitcham, but made Shabbington the main seat of his baronetcy. The manor descended with the baronetcy until Sir John Clerke, 4th Baronet sold Shabbington in 1716.
The buyer was Francis Heywood, whose son William died in 1762. William&#x27;s two sisters and their nephew John Crewe inherited the manor in 1763. Crewe became sole owner in 1788, succeeded by his widow Elizabeth, who in turn left Shabbington to their son-in-law George Boscawen, 3rd Viscount Falmouth. When the Viscount died in 1808, his Shabbington estate was sold in lots.

William Beasley bought the manor and in 1815 and sold them in 1827 to Sir Edward Blount, 8th Baronet, of Sodington, Worcestershire. Shabbington then descended to the 9th and 10th Baronets, and was still in the Blount family in the 1920s.

==Parish church==
The nave and chancel of the Church of England parish church of Saint Mary Magdalene are 11th century. The chancel windows are the 13th century and the Perpendicular Gothic bell-tower is later medieval. The pulpit is Jacobean and was made in 1626. The present nave windows are Victorian Gothic Revival additions. St. Mary Magdalene&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building.

The tower has a ring of six bells. All except the treble bell were cast in 1718 by Abraham I Rudhall of Gloucester. Mears and Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the treble bell in 1881. There is also a Sanctus bell cast by Thomas I Mears of Whitechapel in 1794.

The parish registers date from 1714. St. Mary Magdalene is now part of the Benefice of Worminghall with Ickford, Oakley and Shabbington.

==School==

The former school room and master&#x27;s house are now two private homes. The oldest part is timber framed and was built in the 17th century. In the 18th century the three-bay west range was added as the schoolmaster&#x27;s accommodation and a gothic east window was inserted in the older part of the building. A new schoolroom was added in about 1850.

==Amenities==
Shabbington has a public house, The Old Fisherman, that is also a restaurant.

The Great Bucks Steam and Country Fair is held at Shabbington each summer in early August. The first fair was in 1982 and since then it has been called off three times, once because of heavy rain; another time because of foot and mouth; and lastly due to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.

In 2011 there were 21 working steam engines as well as fire engines, motorbikes and vintage cars. 8,000 steam engine fanatics and vintage car enthusiasts came to Shabbington for the fair. The chairman Maria Millan said: &quot;A lot of people travel quite far to get here and like it because it has a local feel and is organised by a family and a few friends.&quot;

<doc id="352991" wikidata="Q856284" url="?curid=352991" title="Country–western dance">
<text>Country–western dance encompasses any of the dance forms or styles which are typically danced to country-western music, and which are stylistically associated with American country and/or western traditions. Many are descended from dances brought to the United States by immigrants from the United Kingdom and Europe as early as the 1700s, which became integrated into American popular culture. Country dancing is also known as &quot;kicker dancing&quot; in Texas.

== Dances ==
Western couple dancing is a form of social dance. Many different dances are done to country-western music. These dances include: Two Step, Waltz, Cowboy or Traveling Cha Cha, Polka Ten Step (also known as Ten Step Polka), Schottische, and other Western promenade dances, East Coast Swing, West Coast Swing, and Nightclub Two Step. The Two Step and various Western promenade or pattern couples dances are unique to country western dancing.

Western group dances include the following:
*Line dance
*Square dance
**Traditional square dance
**Modern western square dance

Country dancing is informal. Because of cowboy boots, country western dance is more likely to feature a flat-footed glide with some heel and toe touches rather than a lot of &quot;toe type&quot; dancing.

There are many versions of each dance, and many have no one &quot;correct&quot; set of steps. Individual dances may have different names in different areas of the United States. Some dances even have specific names local to particular dance venues. Cowboy, or &quot;country&quot; waltz consists of gliding steps that are consistent with wearing cowboy boots, rather than &quot;on the balls of the feet&quot; quick steps of the classic version. Neither foot is lifted completely from the ground. Steps should be a light footed glide rather than a flat footed shuffle.

==Lead and follow==
In traditional country–western dance, the man leads the dance by establishing the pace and length of stride, as well as deciding when to change the step. He leads his partner, usually a woman, by assertively yet gently directing her movements. The partner is expected to synchronize with the man, performing her part of the dance at his pace. In cases where the woman knew the routine and the man did not, it was acceptable for her to subtly direct the man, although she would still be the following partner. 

In frontier days men danced with each other when women were not available. According to an early settler in Texas, &quot;The gentle sex were few in number at the dance... Two men had to dance together to make a set.&quot; Another account states that &quot;due to the scarcity of young women, a number of young bachelors who were either smooth shaven or wore polished shoes were designated as ladies.&quot; There were also &quot;stag&quot; dances with no women. &quot;Heifer branded&quot; men, those dancing the woman&#x27;s role, wore handkerchiefs tied around one arm. A photograph from one early &quot;stag&quot; dance shows a &quot;closed&quot; dance position, with the &quot;man&#x27;s&quot; right arm around the back of the &quot;woman&quot;. At other times men dancing the role of the woman wore aprons. 

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Country–western dance originated in the dances and music brought to the United States by the people of the British Isles and continental Europe. In particular, there was a fad for French culture in the United States during the French Revolution of 1789–1799, and many French dances were absorbed into American popular culture. The American version of the Virginia Reel, for example, is based on the French dance called &quot;Sir Roger de Coverly&quot;. French dancing teachers also brought quadrilles, dances which featured four couples dancing in a square. The cotillion appears to have originated from a quadrillion. These dances were particularly influential in the development of the square dance. 

These dances soon developed into less formal dances, particularly the jig. One 1774 account states that &quot;Betwixt the country dances they have what I call everlasting Jigs. A couple gets up and begins to cut a jig (to some Negro tune). Others come and cut them out, and these dances always last as long as the fidler can play.&quot; Another author wrote of whites doing &quot;giggs&quot;. Southern wrote that &quot;the whites themselves, and especially the younger ones, were apt to move into reels and jigs at their own dances after a few perfunctory bows in the direction of &quot;society sets&quot; such as minuets and cotillions.

Popular reels, danced with a partner, included Lady Walpole&#x27;s Reel, aka Boston Fancy, Lady Washington&#x27;s Reel and Speed the Plow. In the 1880s the &quot;Devil&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which bore a decided resemblance to the &quot;Old Zip Coon&quot;, was a popular dance. In the late 19th century a type of country dance known as &quot;swinging&quot; appeared, which involved couples twirling around the dance floor together at high speed, much to the disapproval of many &quot;etiquette experts&quot;.

In the early 19th century, large farmhouses were sometimes built with rooms intended for dancing. In smaller houses, the kitchen was used for this purpose. Town halls were also used for gatherings. House dances were called &quot;junkets&quot; or &quot;heel-burners,&quot; and they were casual affairs. These dances would last from mid-afternoon through the next morning. In the early 19th century, Richmond, Virginia closed out yearly horse racing with a ball featuring reels, contradances, congos, hornpipes, and jigs.

Early solo dancing was composed mostly of extemporaneous jigging done by men. The term &quot;jig&quot; has been used to describe various forms of solo dance steps, as well as music, and has not been well defined. Jigs, clogs, shuffles, leaps, heel clicking, hornpipes, and other step dances may have come from various ethnic traditions, or nothing more than an individual improvisation. Other early terms used to describe either solo dancing or steps done as part of a circle or square dance were buck-and-wing, flat-footing, double shuffle, hoedown, and breakdown. Jigging was sometimes referred to as &quot;making the splinters fly&quot;, and jig contests were sometimes held as side entertainment at dance parties. A Texan &quot;stag dance&quot; held in 1829 included jigs and hornpipes accompanied by patting juba. Music was often provided by fiddlers, many of whom were black, or with improvised &quot;instruments&quot;: clevis and pin, scraping on a cotton hoe with a knife, patting of the foot, blowing on a comb through a thin piece of paper, tapping against drinking glasses, or even blowing on a peach leaf. Military bands and string bands were used in larger towns and/or on special occasions.

Dances on the prairie frontier included the scamperdown, double shuffle, western-swing, and half-moon.

&quot;Frolics&quot; were community events often associated with communal work such as corn shucking or house raising. When the work was complete, the participants celebrated with a feast and dancing. A fiddler, often a black man, was the main source of music for dances at these events. The banjo, too, derived from earlier African instruments, was also important. Reels, square dances, waltzes, polkas and other couple dances were performed with a spirit of freedom and improvisation, which music historian Bill C. Malone describes as &quot;all so mingled that it is a dance without a name&quot;.

In West Texas, large dance events were a major community function. Those held at ranches were sometimes called &quot;ranch dances&quot;. Dances for local people in smaller areas lasted for the evening, and the participants would go home after. Larger dances drew participants from a wider area, some of whom travelled by horseback or car to attend. Because it would be tiring to return the same day, these events could go on all night. While children slept, adults danced and socialized until morning. Unusually, the cooking at these events was handled by cowboys rather than women. They would serve a large midnight meal of barbecue and other country foods. When crowds were large, dancers would take turns dancing, paying a fee each time they danced so that the musicians could be paid.

=== 1920s onwards ===
Commercialization of country music ramped up in the 1920s. Despite that trend, dance parties in private homes were still popular in the American South, featuring popular music played by fiddlers. Although many of the songs they played, such as &quot;The Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe&quot;, or &quot;The Virginia Reel&quot; were once associated with specific dances, these associations faded over the years until the songs were completely separated from their original dances.

From the late 1930s to the 1950s, Western swing was extremely popular at dance venues in the Great Plains. Popular steps for the dance-focused style included foxtrots, waltzes of the &quot;Mexican&quot; and &quot;cowboy&quot; varieties, and even simple one-step and two-steps.

The extensive movements of workers and troops within the United States and overseas as a result of World War II indirectly caused the spread of country music, as enthusiasts brought their favored music and dances to their new homes. During World War II, the Venice neighborhood of Los Angeles teemed with National Guardsmen keeping watch for enemy ships. As a result, Venice developed a bustling nightlife scene of dance halls and lounges that featured country western and swing music.

From 1951 to 1961, the largest barn dance in California was held in Compton. Broadcast on radio and television as the &quot;Town Hall Party&quot;, the Town Hall featured popular country and western musicians of the day.

During the 1970s and 1980s, the country and western dance club Gilley&#x27;s Club in Pasadena, Texas was certified by the Guinness Book of World Records as the world&#x27;s largest nightclub, with a capacity of 6,000 people and a floor space of .

One writer, Skippy Blair, noted in 1994 that, &quot;At this writing, Country has become the dance of the decade.&quot; Blair lists Two Step, Waltz, East Coast Swing and West Coast Swing as the most popular couple country dances.

=== Clogging ===
Clogging is a step dance which is usually danced in groups to bluegrass music. It originates from the Appalachian region and is associated with the predecessor to bluegrass — &quot;old-time&quot; music, which is based on Irish and Scots-Irish fiddle tunes. It could be described as a more animated version of Irish step dance or a country version of tap dancing. There are dance competitions for clogging.

<doc id="352992" wikidata="Q186291" url="?curid=352992" title="Great Hurricane of 1780">
<text>The Great Hurricane of 1780 was the deadliest tropical cyclone in the Western Hemisphere. An estimated 22,000 people died throughout the Lesser Antilles when the storm passed through the islands from October 10 to October 16. Specifics on the hurricane&#x27;s track and strength are unknown, as the official Atlantic hurricane database only goes back to 1851.

The hurricane struck Barbados likely as a Category 5 hurricane, with one-minute maximum sustained winds at possibly 175 mph (280 km/h), and at least one estimate of wind gusts as high as , before moving past Martinique, Saint Lucia, and Sint Eustatius, and causing thousands of deaths on those islands. Coming in the midst of the American Revolution, the storm caused heavy losses to the British fleet contesting for control of the area, significantly weakening British control over the Atlantic. The hurricane later passed near Puerto Rico and over the eastern portion of Hispaniola, causing heavy damage near the coastlines. It ultimately turned to the northeast and was last observed on October 20 southeast of Atlantic Canada.

The death toll from the Great Hurricane alone exceeds that of many entire decades of Atlantic hurricanes. Estimates are significantly higher than for the 1998 Hurricane Mitch, the second-deadliest Atlantic storm, for which figures are likely more precise. The hurricane was part of the disastrous 1780 Atlantic hurricane season, with two other deadly storms occurring in October.

==Meteorological history==
This hurricane was first encountered by a boat in the eastern Caribbean Sea, but it may have developed in early October in the eastern Atlantic Ocean off the Cape Verde Islands. The system ultimately strengthened and expanded as it tracked slowly westward; affecting Barbados late on October 9. On October 10, the worst of the hurricane passed over the island, with at least one estimate of gusts as high as during landfall. Early on October 11, the hurricane turned north-northwest about east of Saint Lucia, and later that night it neared the island of Martinique. The cyclone gradually weakened as it passed to the southwest of Dominica early on October 12 and subsequently struck the island of Guadeloupe.

After hitting Guadeloupe, the hurricane turned west-northwest, passing about southwest of Saint Kitts. The hurricane steadily neared Puerto Rico as it paralleled the southern coastline, and on October 14 made its closest point of approach, to the southwest portion of the island. It subsequently turned to the northwest, going through the Mona Passage before making landfall near the present-day Dominican Republic province of Samaná. Late on October 15, it reached the Atlantic Ocean and after passing about east of Grand Turk Island; it is estimated to have recurved to the northeast. The hurricane passed southeast of Bermuda on October 18, and was last observed two days later about southeast of Cape Race, Newfoundland, Canada.

On October 19, strong winds and high tides were reported in the British province of East Florida (the northeastern portion of present-day Florida). NOAA employees, Christopher W. Landsea and Al Sandrik write that it is possible the hurricane passed much closer to the province than previously thought. Another possibility considered was an extension to a hurricane in the western Caribbean Sea. Because of lack of data, the exact track of the Great Hurricane is unknown.

==Impact==

Estimates of the death toll from the hurricane range from 22,000 to about 28,500, making it the deadliest hurricane in the recorded history of the Atlantic hurricane basin.

===British islands===

About 4,500 people died on Barbados. The hurricane began affecting the island with rain late on October 9. The ships in the bay broke their moorings by 4:00 the afternoon of October 10, and the full impact arrived around 6:00 in the evening. The hurricane produced violent winds &quot;so deafening that people could not hear their own voices.&quot;

The hurricane stripped the bark off trees and left none standing on Barbados. Cuban meteorologist José Carlos Millás has estimated that this damage could be caused only by winds exceeding . Every house and fort on Barbados was destroyed. According to British Admiral George Brydges Rodney, the winds carried their heavy cannons aloft .

The wind directions recorded during the hurricane suggest that the eye missed Barbados to the north. Northwesterly winds increased through the day on October 10. The wind gradually backed to westerly through the night of October 10 and peaked at midnight. Wind speed returned to normal by 8:00 the morning of October 11.

Strong winds affected Antigua and Saint Kitts, with many ships in Saint Kitts washed ashore. At Grenada, nineteen Dutch ships were wrecked.

The hurricane later grounded 50 ships near Bermuda.

===French islands===

The hurricane produced a storm surge on Martinique, destroying all houses in Saint-Pierre and causing 9,000 deaths. A storm surge also struck the south coast of Guadeloupe and caused considerable damage.

In Saint Vincent, the hurricane destroyed 584 of the 600 houses in Kingstown.

On Saint Lucia, rough waves and a strong storm tide struck the fleet of Admiral Rodney at Port Castries, with one ship destroying the city&#x27;s hospital after being lifted on top of it. The hurricane destroyed all but two houses in Port Castries, and about 6,000 perished on the island.

High winds, heavy rains, and storm surge caused severe damage at Roseau in Dominica.

The attorney general of Guadeloupe writes:The gale of wind which happened on the 12th Oct. was the most severe perhaps ever known. Barbadoes suffered amazingly, 6500 souls perished. Tobago laid waste, Grenades, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Martinique, suffered more than any person can conceive. St. Kitts and Eustatia, did not escape without damage: this island did but just feel it.

===Dutch islands===

A Dutch sea-officer was on a ship that was blown from Sint Eustatius to Martinique. When he returned to Sint Eustatius, he reported on the damage in Saint-Pierre, Martinique, Saint Vincent, and St. Lucia. He writes in his letter:A short while ago it pleased the Lord Almighty to show us his power. Here we had from 12 to 22 October of this year a very fierce wind &amp; a heavy see that ruined a lot of houses and warehouses, yes even many ships were wrecked and many people were killed. The wall has been completely washed away by the sea and the back of the house has been left only on single struts, yes it was so heavy that the sea flew over our house but we may thank the Lord for his mercy that we have come off so well.

He did not mention a dramatic death toll on the island. He also said that the situation there was not as bad as on the French and English islands.

===Spanish islands===

Heavy damage was reported in southern Puerto Rico, primarily in Cabo Rojo and Lajas. Severe damage also occurred in the eastern region of the Captaincy General of Santo Domingo.

===Losses by the British navy===
Among the ships lost from Rodney&#x27;s fleet were the frigates HMS &quot;Blanche&quot;, which disappeared without a trace, and HMS &quot;Andromeda&quot; and HMS &quot;Laurel&quot;, which were wrecked on Martinique with heavy loss of life. By far the worst losses in the Royal Navy, however, were those ships under the command of Vice-Admiral Peter Parker and Rear-Admiral Joshua Rowley. At the time of the hurricane, Rowley was off the coast of New York with a portion of the fleet, including HMS &quot;Sandwich&quot;, while Parker was in Port Royal, Jamaica. Many of their ships, however, were in the hurricane&#x27;s path. The ships of the line HMS &quot;Thunderer&quot; and HMS &quot;Stirling Castle&quot;, the post ship HMS &quot;Deal Castle&quot; and the sloop HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; were lost, and seven other warships were dismasted.

===Losses by the French navy===

A fleet of 40 French ships was struck off Martinique during the hurricane. Several hundred military personnel and about 9,000 civilians died; however, the French Navy&#x27;s only loss was the frigate &quot;Junon&quot;.

== Name ==

The storm was named the &quot;San Calixto&quot; hurricane in Puerto Rico because the eye of the cyclone made landfall there on October 14, the Christian feast day of Pope Callixtus I, venerated by the Roman Catholic Church as Saint Callixtus (&quot;San Calixto&quot; in Spanish). Since European arrival in the Americas in 1492, all storms and hurricanes had been named after the name of the saint of the feast day on which the storm hit Puerto Rico; for example, the 1867 San Narciso hurricane, the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane, the 1928 San Felipe hurricane, and the 1932 San Ciprian hurricane.

It was not until 1953 that the United States Weather Bureau (now the National Weather Service) started naming hurricanes by human names, a practice relinquished in 1979 to the World Meteorological Organization, though it was only in 1960 that hurricanes stopped being officially named after saints in Puerto Rico.

<text>In certain sports, a magic number is a number used to indicate how close a front-running team is to clinching a division title and/or a playoff spot. It represents the total of additional wins by the front-running team or additional losses (or any combination thereof) by the rival teams after which it is mathematically impossible for the rival teams to capture the title in the remaining number of games, assuming some highly unlikely occurrence such as disqualification or expulsion from the competition or retroactive forfeiture of games does not occur.

The widespread use of magic numbers is generally limited to sports where games only count in the standings when the result is a win and a loss. Magic numbers are not usually used in sports where teams can be credited in some manner for part-wins in case of results such as ties and overtime losses. It could also be referred to as the &quot;clinching number&quot;.

Teams other than the front-running team have what is called an elimination number (or &quot;tragic number&quot;) (often abbreviated &quot;E#&quot;). This number represents the number of wins by the leading team or losses by the trailing team which will eliminate the trailing team. The largest elimination number among the non-first place teams is the magic number for the leading team.

The magic number is calculated as &quot;G&quot; + 1 − &quot;W&quot;&quot;A&quot; − &quot;L&quot;&quot;B&quot;, where
*&quot;G&quot; is the total number of games in the season
*&quot;W&quot;&quot;A&quot; is the number of wins that Team A has in the season
*&quot;L&quot;&quot;B&quot; is the number of losses that Team B has in the season

For example, in Major League Baseball there are 162 games in a season. Suppose the top of the division standings late in the season are as follows:

Then the magic number for Team B to be eliminated is 162 + 1 − 96 − 62 = 5.

Any combination of wins by Team A and losses by Team B totaling 5 makes it impossible for Team B to win the division title.

The &quot;+1&quot; in the formula serves the purpose of eliminating ties; without it, if the magic number were to decrease to zero and stay there, the two teams in question would wind up with identical records. If circumstances dictate that the front-running team would win the tiebreaker regardless of any future results, then the additional constant 1 can be eliminated. For example, the NBA uses complicated formulae for breaking ties, using several other statistics of merit besides overall win–loss record; however the &quot;first&quot; tiebreaker between two teams is their head-to-head record; if the front-running team has already clinched the better head-to-head record, then the +1 is unnecessary. In 2022, Major League Baseball introduced tiebreaking scenarios (such as head-to-head for division ties) that made the use of the &quot;+1&quot; pointless (as Game 163 was eliminated).

The magic number can also be calculated as &quot;W&quot;&quot;B&quot; + &quot;GR&quot;&quot;B&quot; − &quot;W&quot;&quot;A&quot; + 1, where
*&quot;W&quot;&quot;B&quot; is the number of wins that Team B has in the season
*&quot;GR&quot;&quot;B&quot; is the number of games remaining for Team B in the season
*&quot;W&quot;&quot;A&quot; is the number of wins that Team A has in the season

This second formula basically says: &quot;Assume Team B wins every remaining game. Calculate how many games team A needs to win to surpass team B&#x27;s maximum total by 1&quot;. Using the example above and with the same 162-game season, team B has 7 games remaining.

The magic number for Team A to win the division is still &quot;5&quot;: 93 + 7 − 96 + 1 = 5.

Team B can win as many as 100 games. If Team A wins 101, Team B is eliminated. The magic number would decrease with a Team A win and would also decrease with a Team B loss, as its maximum win total would decrease by one.

A variation of the above looks at the relation between the losses of the two teams. The magic number can be calculated as &quot;L&quot;&quot;A&quot; + &quot;GR&quot;&quot;A&quot; − &quot;L&quot;&quot;B&quot; + 1, where
*&quot;L&quot;&quot;A&quot; is the number of losses that Team A has in the season
*&quot;GR&quot;&quot;A&quot; is the number of games remaining for Team A in the season
*&quot;L&quot;&quot;B&quot; is the number of losses that Team B has in the season

This third formula basically says: &quot;Assume Team A loses every remaining game. Calculate how many games team B needs to lose to surpass team A&#x27;s maximum total by 1&quot;. Using the example above and with the same 162-game season, team A has 8 games remaining.

The magic number for Team A to win the division is still &quot;5&quot;: 58 + 8 − 62 + 1 = 5. As you can see, the magic number is the same whether calculating it based on potential wins of the leader or potential losses of the trailing team. Indeed, mathematical proofs will show that the three formulas presented here are mathematically equivalent.

Team A can lose as many as 66 games. If Team B loses 67, Team B is eliminated. Once again, the magic number would decrease with a Team A win and would also decrease with a Team B loss.

In some sports, ties are broken by an additional one-game playoff(s) between the teams involved. When a team gets to the point where its magic number is 1, it is said to have &quot;clinched a tie&quot; for the division or the wild card. However, if they end the season tied with another team, and only one is eligible for the playoffs, the extra playoff game will erase that &quot;clinching&quot; for the team that loses the playoff game.

Some sports use a tiebreaker formula instead of staging a one-game playoff. In such cases, it is necessary to look beyond the won-lost records of the teams to determine the magic number, since a team that has already guaranteed itself the edge in the tiebreaker formula would not need to include &quot;+1&quot; in calculating its magic number. For example, assume a basketball league that plays an 82-game season with no one-game tiebreakers shows division standings late in the season as follows:

Suppose further that the first step in the league&#x27;s tiebreaker formula is results in head-to-head meetings. Team A and Team B have met four times during the season with Team A winning three of the four games. They are not scheduled to meet again in the regular season. Therefore, Team A holds a tiebreaker edge over Team B and only needs to finish with the same number of wins as Team B in order to be placed ahead of Team B in the standings. Therefore, we can calculate Team A&#x27;s magic number as 82 – 60 – 20 = 2. If Team A wins two of its seven remaining games, it will finish 62–20. If Team B wins all seven of its remaining games, it will also finish 62–20. However, since Team B loses the tiebreaker on head-to-head results, Team A is the division winner. In cases where the winners of potential tiebreakers have not yet been determined (for example, because the teams still have some games to play against each other) the usual convention is to calculate the magic numbers of the teams involved as if they will lose the tiebreaker, and to calculate the elimination numbers of such teams as if they will win the tiebreaker.

By convention, the magic number typically is used to describe the first place team only, relative to the teams it leads. However, the same mathematical formulas could be applied to any team, teams that are tied for the lead, as well as teams that trail. In these cases, a team that is not in first place will depend on the leading team to lose some games so that it may catch up, so the magic number will be larger than the number of games remaining. Ultimately, for teams that are no longer in contention, their magic number would be larger than their remaining games + the remaining games for the first place team — which would be impossible to overcome.

==Derivation==
The formula for the magic number is derived straightforwardly as follows. As before, at some particular point in the season let Team A have &quot;W&quot;&quot;A&quot; wins and &quot;L&quot;&quot;A&quot; losses. Suppose that at some later time, Team A has &quot;w&quot;&quot;A&quot; additional wins and &quot;l&quot;&quot;A&quot; additional losses, and define similarly &quot;W&quot;&quot;B&quot;, &quot;L&quot;&quot;B&quot;, &quot;w&quot;&quot;B&quot;, &quot;l&quot;&quot;B&quot; for Team B. The total number of wins that Team B needs to make up is thus given by (&quot;W&quot;&quot;A&quot; + &quot;w&quot;&quot;A&quot;) − (&quot;W&quot;&quot;B&quot; + &quot;w&quot;&quot;B&quot;). Team A clinches when this number exceeds the number of games Team B has remaining, since at that point Team B cannot make up the deficit even if Team A fails to win any more games. If there are a total of &quot;G&quot; games in the season, then the number of games remaining for Team B is given by &quot;G&quot; − (&quot;W&quot;&quot;B&quot; + &quot;w&quot;&quot;B&quot; + &quot;L&quot;&quot;B&quot; + &quot;l&quot;&quot;B&quot;). Thus the condition for Team A to clinch is that (&quot;W&quot;&quot;A&quot; + &quot;w&quot;&quot;A&quot;) − (&quot;W&quot;&quot;B&quot; + &quot;w&quot;&quot;B&quot;) = 1 + &quot;G&quot; − (&quot;W&quot;&quot;B&quot; + &quot;w&quot;&quot;B&quot; + &quot;L&quot;&quot;B&quot; + &quot;l&quot;&quot;B&quot;). Canceling the common terms, we obtain &quot;w&quot;&quot;A&quot; + &quot;l&quot;&quot;B&quot; = &quot;G&quot; + 1 − &quot;W&quot;&quot;A&quot; − &quot;L&quot;&quot;B&quot;, which establishes the magic number formula.

==Games played quirk==

In the following example, Team A&#x27;s Magic Number is 5, because even though it can eliminate second-place Team B in 4 additional games, it would take 5 games to assuredly eliminate third-place Team C. Calculating the magic number requires using the lowest number of losses among the other competing teams: 162 + 1 − 88 − 70 = 5.

==Tie-breaker quirk==

Another scenario where the Magic Number may vary from the mathematical calculation of the number can occur when there is a tie-breaker scenario. Most sports have a number of tie-breaker methods set up to deal with eventualities of tying records at the end of the season. Typically, the first of these methods involves head-to-head matchups of the teams and which team has won more games against the other during the season.

In the below example, Teams A and B both have 12 games remaining and the mathematical formula would dictate a Magic Number of 6 for Team A. 162+1-83-74=6.

However, if Team A wins only 5 of their remaining games and ends the season with a record of 88-74 and Team B wins all remaining games and ends the season with a tying record, Team A would win the division title if they have a winning record over Team B during the season, which would mean that in the below example, Team A actually has a Magic Number of 5.

==Subtlety==
Sometimes a team can appear to have a mathematical chance to win even though they have actually been eliminated already, due to scheduling. In this Major League Baseball scenario, there are three games remaining in the season. Teams A, B and C are assumed to be eligible only for the division championship; teams with better records in other divisions have already clinched the three available &quot;wild card&quot; spots:

If Team C were to win all three remaining games, it would finish at 88–74, and if both Teams A and B were to lose their three remaining games, they would finish at 87–75, which would make Team C the division winner. However, if Teams A and B are playing against each other in the final weekend (in a 3-game series), it would be impossible for both teams to lose the three remaining games. One of them will win at least two games and thereby clinch the division title with a record of either 90–72 or 89–73. The more direct consequence of this situation is that it is also not possible for Teams A and B to finish in a tie with each other, and Team C cannot win the division.

One can say definitely whether a team has been eliminated by use of the algorithm for the maximum flow problem.

The addition of a second Wild Card team makes the reverse scenario (in which a team has actually clinched a postseason berth even though it appears they could still be eliminated) possible in baseball. In this scenario for the Wild Card:
If Teams B and C are playing their final three games against each other and all other teams have clinched their divisions or been mathematically eliminated from catching Team A, then Team A will have clinched at least the second Wild Card berth since it will be impossible for Teams B and C to both win enough games to catch Team A.

The reverse scenario is more common in sports that have more postseason berths, benefitting teams that are in the final playoff positions but being chased by teams that still have to play each other. Sometimes, both scenarios can occur simultaneously. In the following National Basketball Association scenario for teams placed seventh through tenth in the conference standings:

If Teams B and C have to play one of their last two games against each other and Team A holds the tiebreaker against Teams B, C and D, then Team A will have clinched a playoff berth since they cannot be overtaken by both Teams B and C. Also, if Team D does not hold a tiebreaker against any of Teams A, B and C then it will be out of playoff contention since it cannot overtake both Teams B and C. 

A similar scenario occasionally occurs in European soccer leagues and other competitions that use promotion and relegation. In this scenario for a 20 team soccer league that plays a double round robin format, awards three points for a win and one for a draw and relegates the 18th, 19th and 20th place teams:

If Team A loses its last two matches, it will finish with 38 points while if Team D wins its last two matches, it will finish with 34. Nevertheless, regardless of goal difference or any other tiebreaker, if Teams B and C still have to play each other then Team A is safe from relegation since Teams B and C cannot both reach 38 points, while Team D will be relegated since Teams B and C cannot both finish with less than 35 points.

==Alternative method==

Another method can be used to determine the Elimination Number which uses only the Games Remaining (formula_1) and Games Behind Leader (GBL) statistics, as follows: formula_2,
&lt;br&gt;where formula_3 means Games Remaining for Leader (similarly, formula_4 means Games Remaining for Trailer).

&lt;br&gt;Refer back to the example presented above. The elimination number for Team B is once again &quot;5&quot;: formula_5.

&lt;br&gt;It is necessary to use this method if the teams play different numbers of games in the full season, for instance due to cancellations or ties that will not be replayed. Note that this algorithm also is limited by the aforementioned subtleties.

<text>In computer programming, a magic number is any of the following:

* A unique value with unexplained meaning or multiple occurrences which could (preferably) be replaced with a named constant
* A constant numerical or text value used to identify a file format or protocol )
* A distinctive unique value that is unlikely to be mistaken for other meanings (e.g., Globally Unique Identifiers)

== Unnamed numerical constants ==
The term magic number or magic constant refers to the anti-pattern of using numbers directly in source code. This has been referred to as breaking one of the oldest rules of programming, dating back to the COBOL, FORTRAN and PL/1 manuals of the 1960s. The use of unnamed magic numbers in code obscures the developers&#x27; intent in choosing that number, increases opportunities for subtle errors (e.g. is every digit correct in 3.14159265358979323846 and can be rounded to 3.14159?) and makes it more difficult for the program to be adapted and extended in the future. Replacing all significant magic numbers with named constants (also called explanatory variables) makes programs easier to read, understand and maintain.

Names chosen to be meaningful in the context of the program can result in code that is more easily understood by a maintainer who is not the original author (or even by the original author after a period of time). An example of an uninformatively named constant is codice_1, while codice_2 is more descriptive.

The problems associated with magic &#x27;numbers&#x27; described above are not limited to numerical types and the term is also applied to other data types where declaring a named constant would be more flexible and communicative. Thus, declaring codice_3 is better than several occurrences of the &#x27;magic value&#x27; codice_4 in a test suite.

For example, if it is required to randomly shuffle the values in an array representing a standard pack of playing cards, this pseudocode does the job using the Fisher–Yates shuffle algorithm:

 for i from 1 to 52
 j := i + randomInt(53 - i) - 1
 a.swapEntries(i, j)

where codice_5 is an array object, the function codice_6 chooses a random integer between 1 and &quot;x&quot;, inclusive, and codice_7 swaps the &quot;i&quot;th and &quot;j&quot;th entries in the array. In the preceding example, codice_8 and codice_9 are magic numbers, also not clearly related to each other. It is considered better programming style to write the following:

 &quot;int&quot; deckSize:= 52
 for i from 1 to deckSize
 j := i + randomInt(deckSize + 1 - i) - 1
 a.swapEntries(i, j)

This is preferable for several reasons:
* It is easier to read and understand. A programmer reading the first example might wonder, &quot;What does the number 52 mean here? Why 52?&quot; The programmer might infer the meaning after reading the code carefully, but it is not obvious. Magic numbers become particularly confusing when the same number is used for different purposes in one section of code.
* It is easier to alter the value of the number, as it is not duplicated. Changing the value of a magic number is error-prone, because the same value is often used several times in different places within a program. Also, when two semantically distinct variables or numbers have the same value they may be accidentally both edited together. To modify the first example to shuffle a Tarot deck, which has 78 cards, a programmer might naively replace every instance of 52 in the program with 78. This would cause two problems. First, it would miss the value 53 on the second line of the example, which would cause the algorithm to fail in a subtle way. Second, it would likely replace the characters &quot;52&quot; everywhere, regardless of whether they refer to the deck size or to something else entirely, such as the number of weeks in a Gregorian calendar year, or more insidiously, are part of a number like &quot;1523&quot;, all of which would introduce bugs. By contrast, changing the value of the codice_10 variable in the second example would be a simple, one-line change.
* It encourages and facilitates documentation. The single place where the named variable is declared makes a good place to document what the value means and why it has the value it does. Having the same value in a plethora of places either leads to duplicate comments (and attendant problems when updating some but missing some) or leaves no &quot;one&quot; place where it&#x27;s both natural for the author to explain the value and likely the reader shall look for an explanation.
* The declarations of &quot;magic number&quot; variables are placed together, usually at the top of a function or file, facilitating their review and change.
* It helps detect typos. Using a variable (instead of a literal) takes advantage of a compiler&#x27;s checking. Accidentally typing &quot;62&quot; instead of &quot;52&quot; would go undetected, whereas typing &quot;codice_11&quot; instead of &quot;codice_10&quot; would result in the compiler&#x27;s warning that codice_11 is undeclared.
* It can reduce typing in some IDEs. If an IDE supports code completion, it will fill in most of the variable&#x27;s name from the first few letters.
* It facilitates parameterization. For example, to generalize the above example into a procedure that shuffles a deck of any number of cards, it would be sufficient to turn codice_10 into a parameter of that procedure, whereas the first example would require several changes.

 function shuffle (int deckSize)
 for i from 1 to deckSize
 j := i + randomInt(deckSize + 1 - i) - 1
 a.swapEntries(i, j)

Disadvantages are:
* When the named constant is not defined near its use, it hurts the locality, and thus comprehensibility, of the code. Putting the 52 in a possibly distant place means that, to understand the workings of the &quot;for&quot; loop completely (for example to estimate the run-time of the loop), one must track down the definition and verify that it is the expected number. This is easy to avoid (by relocating the declaration) when the constant is only used in one portion of the code. When the named constant is used in disparate portions, on the other hand, the remote location is a clue to the reader that the same value appears in other places in the code, which may also be worth looking into.
* It may make the code more verbose. The declaration of the constant adds a line. When the constant&#x27;s name is longer than the value&#x27;s, particularly if several such constants appear in one line, it may make it necessary to split one logical statement of the code across several lines. An increase in verbosity may be justified when there is some likelihood of confusion about the constant, or when there is a likelihood the constant may need to be changed, such as reuse of a shuffling routine for other card games. It may equally be justified as an increase in expressiveness.
* It may be slower to process the expression codice_15 at run-time than the value &quot;53&quot;, although most modern compilers and interpreters will notice that codice_10 has been declared as a constant and pre-calculate the value 53 in the compiled code. Even when that&#x27;s not an option, loop optimization will move the addition so that it is performed before the loop. There is therefore usually no (or negligible) speed penalty compared to using magic numbers in code. Especially the cost of debugging and the time needed trying to understand non-explanatory code must be held against the tiny calculation cost.

=== Accepted uses ===

In some contexts, the use of unnamed numerical constants is generally accepted (and arguably &quot;not magic&quot;). While such acceptance is subjective, and often depends on individual coding habits, the following are common examples:
* the use of 0 and 1 as initial or incremental values in a for loop, such as 
* the use of 2 to check whether a number is even or odd, as in codice_17, where codice_18 is the modulo operator
* the use of simple arithmetic constants, e.g., in expressions such as codice_19, or for calculating the discriminant of a quadratic equation as codice_20
* the use of powers of 10 to convert metric values (e.g. between grams and kilograms) or to calculate percentage and per mille values
* exponents in expressions such as codice_21 for formula_1

The constants 1 and 0 are sometimes used to represent the Boolean values true and false in programming languages without a Boolean type, such as older versions of C. Most modern programming languages provide a codice_22 or codice_23 primitive type and so the use of 0 and 1 is ill-advised. This can be more confusing since 0 sometimes means programmatic success (when -1 means failure) and failure in other cases (when 1 means success).

In C and C++, 0 represents the null pointer. As with Boolean values, the C standard library includes a macro definition codice_24 whose use is encouraged. Other languages provide a specific codice_25 or codice_26 value and when this is the case no alternative should be used. The typed pointer constant codice_27 has been introduced with C++11.

== Format indicators ==
=== Origin ===
Format indicators were first used in early Version 7 Unix source code.

Unix was ported to one of the first DEC PDP-11/20s, which did not have memory protection. So early versions of Unix used the relocatable memory reference model. Pre-Sixth Edition Unix versions read an executable file into memory and jumped to the first low memory address of the program, relative address zero. With the development of paged versions of Unix, a header was created to describe the executable image components. Also, a branch instruction was inserted as the first word of the header to skip the header and start the program. In this way a program could be run in the older relocatable memory reference (regular) mode or in paged mode. As more executable formats were developed, new constants were added by incrementing the branch offset.

In the Sixth Edition source code of the Unix program loader, the exec() function read the executable (binary) image from the file system. The first 8 bytes of the file was a header containing the sizes of the program (text) and initialized (global) data areas. Also, the first 16-bit word of the header was compared to two constants to determine if the executable image contained relocatable memory references (normal), the newly implemented paged read-only executable image, or the separated instruction and data paged image. There was no mention of the dual role of the header constant, but the high order byte of the constant was, in fact, the operation code for the PDP-11 branch instruction (octal 000407 or hex 0107). Adding seven to the program counter showed that if this constant was executed, it would branch the Unix exec() service over the executable image eight byte header and start the program.

Since the Sixth and Seventh Editions of Unix employed paging code, the dual role of the header constant was hidden. That is, the exec() service read the executable file header (meta) data into a kernel space buffer, but read the executable image into user space, thereby not using the constant&#x27;s branching feature. Magic number creation was implemented in the Unix linker and loader and magic number branching was probably still used in the suite of stand-alone diagnostic programs that came with the Sixth and Seventh Editions. Thus, the header constant did provide an illusion and met the criteria for magic.

In Version Seven Unix, the header constant was not tested directly, but assigned to a variable labeled ux_mag and subsequently referred to as the magic number. Probably because of its uniqueness, the term magic number came to mean executable format type, then expanded to mean file system type, and expanded again to mean any type of file.

=== In files === 

Magic numbers are common in programs across many operating systems. Magic numbers implement strongly typed data and are a form of in-band signaling to the controlling program that reads the data type(s) at program run-time. Many files have such constants that identify the contained data. Detecting such constants in files is a simple and effective way of distinguishing between many file formats and can yield further run-time information.

;Examples
* Compiled Java class files (bytecode) and Mach-O binaries start with hex codice_28. When compressed with Pack200 the bytes are changed to codice_29.
* GIF image files have the ASCII code for &quot;GIF89a&quot; (codice_30 codice_31 codice_32 codice_33 codice_34 codice_35) or &quot;GIF87a&quot; (codice_30 codice_31 codice_32 codice_33 codice_40 codice_35)
* JPEG image files begin with codice_42 codice_43 and end with codice_42 codice_45. JPEG/JFIF files contain the null terminated string &quot;JFIF&quot; (codice_46 codice_32 codice_31 codice_32 codice_50). JPEG/Exif files contain the null terminated string &quot;Exif&quot; (codice_51 codice_52 codice_53 codice_54 codice_50), followed by more metadata about the file.
* PNG image files begin with an 8-byte signature which identifies the file as a PNG file and allows detection of common file transfer problems: &quot;\211PNG\r\n\032\n&quot; (codice_56 codice_57 codice_58 codice_30 codice_60 codice_61 codice_62 codice_61). That signature contains various newline characters to permit detecting unwarranted automated newline conversions, such as transferring the file using FTP with the &quot;ASCII&quot; transfer mode instead of the &quot;binary&quot; mode.
* Standard MIDI audio files have the ASCII code for &quot;MThd&quot; (MIDI Track header, codice_64 codice_65 codice_66 codice_67) followed by more metadata.
* Unix or Linux scripts may start with a shebang (&quot;#!&quot;, codice_68 codice_69) followed by the path to an interpreter, if the interpreter is likely to be different from the one from which the script was invoked.
* ELF executables start with the byte codice_70 followed by &quot;ELF&quot; (codice_70 codice_51 codice_73 codice_32).
* PostScript files and programs start with &quot;%!&quot; (codice_75 codice_69).
* PDF files start with &quot;%PDF&quot; (hex codice_75 codice_57 codice_79 codice_32).
* DOS MZ executable files and the EXE stub of the Microsoft Windows PE (Portable Executable) files start with the characters &quot;MZ&quot; (codice_64 codice_82), the initials of the designer of the file format, Mark Zbikowski. The definition allows the uncommon &quot;ZM&quot; (codice_82 codice_64) as well for dosZMXP, a non-PE EXE.
* The Berkeley Fast File System superblock format is identified as either codice_85 codice_65 codice_87 codice_85 or codice_87 codice_85 codice_65 depending on version; both represent the birthday of the author, Marshall Kirk McKusick.
* The Master Boot Record of bootable storage devices on almost all IA-32 IBM PC compatibles has a code of codice_92 codice_93 as its last two bytes.
* Executables for the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance handheld video game systems have a 48-byte or 156-byte magic number, respectively, at a fixed spot in the header. This magic number encodes a bitmap of the Nintendo logo.
* Amiga software executable Hunk files running on Amiga classic 68000 machines all started with the hexadecimal number $000003f3, nicknamed the &quot;Magic Cookie.&quot;
* In the Amiga, the only absolute address in the system is hex $0000 0004 (memory location 4), which contains the start location called SysBase, a pointer to exec.library, the so-called kernel of Amiga.
* PEF files, used by the classic Mac OS and BeOS for PowerPC executables, contain the ASCII code for &quot;Joy!&quot; (codice_46 codice_95 codice_96 codice_69) as a prefix.
* TIFF files begin with either &quot;II&quot; or &quot;MM&quot; followed by 42 as a two-byte integer in little or big endian byte ordering. &quot;II&quot; is for Intel, which uses little endian byte ordering, so the magic number is codice_31 codice_31 codice_100 codice_50. &quot;MM&quot; is for Motorola, which uses big endian byte ordering, so the magic number is codice_64 codice_64 codice_50 codice_100.
* Unicode text files encoded in UTF-16 often start with the Byte Order Mark to detect endianness (codice_106 codice_42 for big endian and codice_42 codice_106 for little endian). And on Microsoft Windows, UTF-8 text files often start with the UTF-8 encoding of the same character, codice_110 codice_111 codice_112.
* LLVM Bitcode files start with &quot;BC&quot; (codice_113 codice_114).
* WAD files start with &quot;IWAD&quot; or &quot;PWAD&quot; (for &quot;Doom&quot;), &quot;WAD2&quot; (for &quot;Quake&quot;) and &quot;WAD3&quot; (for &quot;Half-Life&quot;).
* Microsoft Compound File Binary Format (mostly known as one of the older formats of Microsoft Office documents) files start with codice_115 codice_116 codice_117 codice_118, which is visually suggestive of the word &quot;DOCFILE0&quot;.
* Headers in ZIP files often show up in text editors as &quot;PK♥♦&quot; (codice_57 codice_120 codice_121 codice_122), where &quot;PK&quot; are the initials of Phil Katz, author of DOS compression utility PKZIP.
* Headers in 7z files begin with &quot;7z&quot; (full magic number: codice_40 codice_124 codice_125 codice_126 codice_127 codice_128).

;Detection
The Unix utility program codice_129 can read and interpret magic numbers from files, and the file which is used to parse the information is called &quot;magic&quot;. The Windows utility TrID has a similar purpose.

=== In protocols ===
;Examples
* The OSCAR protocol, used in AIM/ICQ, prefixes requests with codice_100.
* In the RFB protocol used by VNC, a client starts its conversation with a server by sending &quot;RFB&quot; (codice_8 codice_32 codice_113, for &quot;Remote Frame Buffer&quot;) followed by the client&#x27;s protocol version number.
* In the SMB protocol used by Microsoft Windows, each SMB request or server reply begins with &#x27;codice_42 codice_9 codice_64 codice_113&#x27;, or codice_138 at the start of the SMB request.
* In the MSRPC protocol used by Microsoft Windows, each TCP-based request begins with codice_139 at the start of the request (representing Microsoft DCE/RPC Version 5), followed immediately by a codice_50 or codice_87 for the minor version. In UDP-based MSRPC requests the first byte is always codice_122.
* In COM and DCOM marshalled interfaces, called OBJREFs, always start with the byte sequence &quot;MEOW&quot; (codice_64 codice_51 codice_145 codice_146). Debugging extensions (used for DCOM channel hooking) are prefaced with the byte sequence &quot;MARB&quot; (codice_64 codice_148 codice_8 codice_113).
* Unencrypted BitTorrent tracker requests begin with a single byte containing the value codice_85 representing the header length, followed immediately by the phrase &quot;BitTorrent protocol&quot; at byte position 1.
* eDonkey2000/eMule traffic begins with a single byte representing the client version. Currently codice_152 represents an eDonkey client, codice_153 represents eMule, and codice_154 represents compressed eMule.
* The first 4 bytes of a block in the Bitcoin Blockchain contains a magic number which serves as the network identifier. The value is a constant codice_155, which indicates the main network, while the constant codice_156 indicates the testnet.
* SSL transactions always begin with a &quot;client hello&quot; message. The record encapsulation scheme used to prefix all SSL packets consists of two- and three- byte header forms. Typically an SSL version 2 client hello message is prefixed with a codice_157 and an SSLv3 server response to a client hello begins with codice_158 (though this may vary).
* DHCP packets use a &quot;magic cookie&quot; value of &#x27;codice_159 codice_160 codice_161 codice_159&#x27; at the start of the options section of the packet. This value is included in all DHCP packet types.
* HTTP/2 connections are opened with the preface &#x27;codice_163&#x27;, or &quot;codice_164&quot;. The preface is designed to avoid the processing of frames by servers and intermediaries which support earlier versions of HTTP but not 2.0.

=== In interfaces ===
Magic numbers are common in API functions and interfaces across many operating systems, including DOS, Windows and NetWare:

;Examples
* IBM PC-compatible BIOSes use magic values codice_165 and codice_166 to decide if the system should count up memory or not on reboot, thereby performing a cold or a warm boot. Theses values are also used by EMM386 memory managers intercepting boot requests. BIOSes also use magic values codice_167 to determine if a disk is bootable.
* The MS-DOS disk cache SMARTDRV (codenamed &quot;Bambi&quot;) uses magic values BABE and EBAB in API functions.
* Many DR-DOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS drivers developed in the former &quot;European Development Centre&quot; in the UK use the value 0EDC as magic token when invoking or providing additional functionality sitting on top of the (emulated) standard DOS functions, NWCACHE being one example.

=== Other uses ===
;Examples
* The default MAC address on Texas Instruments SOCs is DE:AD:BE:EF:00:00.

== Data type limits ==
This is a list of limits of data storage types:
== GUIDs ==
It is possible to create or alter globally unique identifiers (GUIDs) so that they are memorable, but this is highly discouraged as it compromises their strength as near-unique identifiers. The specifications for generating GUIDs and UUIDs are quite complex, which is what leads to them being virtually unique, if properly implemented.

Microsoft Windows product ID numbers for Microsoft Office products sometimes end with codice_168 (&quot;OFFICE&quot;), such as {codice_169}, the product ID for the &quot;Office 16 Click-to-Run Extensibility Component&quot;.

Java uses several GUIDs starting with codice_170.

In the GUID Partition Table of the GPT partitioning scheme, BIOS Boot partitions use the special GUID {codice_171} which does not follow the GUID definition; instead, it is formed by using the ASCII codes for the string &quot;codice_172&quot; partially in little endian order.

== Debug values ==
Magic debug values are specific values written to memory during allocation or deallocation, so that it will later be possible to tell whether or not they have become corrupted, and to make it obvious when values taken from uninitialized memory are being used. Memory is usually viewed in hexadecimal, so memorable repeating or hexspeak values are common. Numerically odd values may be preferred so that processors without byte addressing will fault when attempting to use them as pointers (which must fall at even addresses). Values should be chosen that are away from likely addresses (the program code, static data, heap data, or the stack). Similarly, they may be chosen so that they are not valid codes in the instruction set for the given architecture.

Since it is very unlikely, although possible, that a 32-bit integer would take this specific value, the appearance of such a number in a debugger or memory dump most likely indicates an error such as a buffer overflow or an uninitialized variable.

Famous and common examples include:


Most of these are 32 bits longthe word size of most 32-bit architecture computers.

The prevalence of these values in Microsoft technology is no coincidence; they are discussed in detail in Steve Maguire&#x27;s book &quot;Writing Solid Code&quot; from Microsoft Press. He gives a variety of criteria for these values, such as:
* They should not be useful; that is, most algorithms that operate on them should be expected to do something unusual. Numbers like zero don&#x27;t fit this criterion.
* They should be easily recognized by the programmer as invalid values in the debugger.
* On machines that don&#x27;t have byte alignment, they should be odd numbers, so that dereferencing them as addresses causes an exception.
* They should cause an exception, or perhaps even a debugger break, if executed as code.

Since they were often used to mark areas of memory that were essentially empty, some of these terms came to be used in phrases meaning &quot;gone, aborted, flushed from memory&quot;; e.g. &quot;Your program is DEADBEEF&quot;.

<text>The Polish–Soviet War (14 February 1919 – 18 March 1921) was fought primarily between the Second Polish Republic and the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic, following World War I and the Russian Revolution.

After the collapse of the Central Powers and the Armistice of 11 November 1918, Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Soviet Russia annulled the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and moved forces westward to reclaim the &quot;Ober Ost&quot; regions abandoned by the Germans. Lenin viewed the newly independent Poland as a critical route for spreading communist revolutions into Europe. Meanwhile, Polish leaders, including Józef Piłsudski, aimed to restore Poland’s pre-1772 borders and secure the country&#x27;s position in the region. Throughout 1919, Polish forces occupied much of present-day Lithuania and Belarus, emerging victorious in the Polish–Ukrainian War. However, Soviet forces regained strength after their victories in the Russian Civil War, and Symon Petliura, leader of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, was forced to ally with Piłsudski in 1920 to resist the advancing Bolsheviks.

In April 1920, Piłsudski launched the Kiev offensive with the goal of securing favorable borders for Poland. On 7 May, Polish and allied Ukrainian forces captured Kiev, though Soviet armies in the area were not decisively defeated. The offensive lacked local support, and many Ukrainians joined the Red Army rather than Petliura’s forces. In response, the Soviet Red Army launched a successful counteroffensive starting in June 1920. By August, Soviet troops had pushed Polish forces back to Warsaw. However, at the decisive Battle of Warsaw (1920), Polish forces achieved an unexpected victory between 12 and 25 August 1920, turning the tide of the war. This battle, often referred to as the &quot;Miracle on the Vistula,&quot; is considered one of the most important military triumphs in Polish history.

The war ended with a ceasefire on 18 October 1920, and peace negotiations led to the Peace of Riga, signed on 18 March 1921. The treaty divided disputed territories between Poland and Soviet Russia. Poland’s eastern border was established about 200 km east of the Curzon Line, securing Polish control over parts of modern-day Ukraine and Belarus. The war resulted in the official recognition of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic as Soviet states, undermining Piłsudski’s ambitions for an &quot;Intermarium&quot; federation led by Poland. Despite this, Poland&#x27;s success at the Battle of Warsaw cemented its position as an important player in Eastern European geopolitics in the interwar period.

== Names and ending dates ==
The war is known by several names. &quot;Polish–Soviet War&quot; is the most common but other names include &quot;Russo–Polish War&quot; (or &quot;Polish–Russian War&quot;) and &quot;Polish–Bolshevik War&quot;. This last term (or just &quot;Bolshevik War&quot; ()) is most common in Polish sources. In some Polish sources it is also referred to as the &quot;War of 1920&quot; ().

The ending year of the conflict is variously given as either 1920 or 1921; this confusion stems from the fact that while the ceasefire came into force on 18 October 1920, the official treaty ending the war was signed on 18 March 1921. While the events of late 1918 and 1919 can be described as a border conflict and only in spring 1920 were both sides engaged in an all-out war, the warfare that took place in late April 1920 was an escalation of the fighting that had begun a year and a half earlier.

== Background ==


The war&#x27;s main territories of contention lie in what is now Ukraine and Belarus. Until the mid-13th century, they formed part of the medieval state of Kievan Rus&#x27;. After a period of internal wars and the 1240 Mongol invasion, the lands became objects of expansion for the Kingdom of Poland and for the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In the first half of the 14th century, the Principality of Kiev and the land between the Dnieper, Pripyat, and Daugava (Western Dvina) rivers became part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1352, Poland and Lithuania divided the Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia between themselves. In 1569, in accordance with the terms of the Union of Lublin between Poland and Lithuania, some of the Ukrainian lands passed to the Polish Crown. Between 1772 and 1795, many of the East Slavic territories became part of the Russian Empire in the course of the Partitions of Poland–Lithuania. In 1795 (the Third Partition of Poland), Poland lost formal independence. After the Congress of Vienna of 1814–1815, much of the territory of the Duchy of Warsaw was transferred to Russian control and became the autonomous Congress Poland (officially the Kingdom of Poland). After young Poles refused conscription to the Imperial Russian Army during the January Uprising of 1863, Tsar Alexander II stripped Congress Poland of its separate constitution, attempted to force general use of the Russian language and took away vast tracts of land from Poles. Congress Poland was incorporated more directly into imperial Russia by being divided into ten provinces, each with an appointed Russian military governor and all under complete control of the Russian Governor-General at Warsaw.

In the aftermath of World War I, the map of Central and Eastern Europe changed drastically. The German Empire&#x27;s defeat rendered obsolete Berlin&#x27;s plans for the creation of Eastern European German-dominated states (&quot;Mitteleuropa&quot;), which included another rendition of the Kingdom of Poland. The Russian Empire collapsed, which resulted in the Russian Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The Russian state lost territory due to the German offensive and the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, signed by the emergent Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. Several nations of the region saw a chance for independence and seized their opportunity to gain it. The defeat of Germany on the Western Front and the withdrawal of the Imperial German Army in the Eastern Front had left Berlin in no position to retaliate against Soviet Russia, which swiftly repudiated the treaty and proceeded to recover many of the former territories of the Russian Empire. However, preoccupied with the civil war, it did not have the resources to react swiftly to the national rebellions.

In November 1918, Poland became a sovereign state. Among the several border wars fought by the Second Polish Republic was the successful Greater Poland uprising (1918–1919) against Weimar Germany. The historic Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth included vast territories in the east. They had been incorporated into the Russian Empire in 1772–1795 and had remained its parts, as the Northwest Territory, until World War I. After the war they were contested by the Polish, Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Lithuanian, and Latvian interests.

In newly independent Poland, politics were strongly influenced by Józef Piłsudski. On 11 November 1918, Piłsudski was made head of Polish armed forces by the Regency Council of the Kingdom of Poland, a body installed by the Central Powers. Subsequently, he was recognized by many Polish politicians as temporary chief of state and exercised in practice extensive powers. Under the Small Constitution of 20 February 1919, he became chief of state. As such, he reported to the Legislative Sejm.

With the collapse of the Russian and German occupying authorities, virtually all of Poland&#x27;s neighbours began fighting over borders and other issues. The Finnish Civil War, the Estonian War of Independence, the Latvian War of Independence, and the Lithuanian Wars of Independence were all fought in the Baltic Sea region. Russia was overwhelmed by domestic struggles. In early March 1919, the Communist International was established in Moscow. The Hungarian Soviet Republic was proclaimed in March and the Bavarian Soviet Republic in April. Winston Churchill, in a conversation with Prime Minister David Lloyd George, commented sarcastically: &quot;The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begin.&quot; The Polish–Soviet War was the longest lasting of the international engagements.

The territory of what had become Poland had been a major battleground during World War I and the new country lacked political stability. It had won the hard-fought Polish–Ukrainian War against the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic by July 1919 but had already become embroiled in new conflicts with Germany (the 1919–1921 Silesian Uprisings) and the January 1919 border conflict with Czechoslovakia. Meanwhile, Soviet Russia focused on thwarting the counterrevolution and the 1918–1925 intervention by the Allied powers. The first clashes between Polish and Soviet forces occurred in autumn and winter 1918/1919, but it took a year and a half for a full-scale war to develop.

The Western powers considered any significant territorial expansion of Poland, at the expense of Russia or Germany, to be highly disruptive to the post-World War I order. Among other factors, the Western Allies did not want to give Germany and Russia a reason to conspire together. The rise of the unrecognized Bolshevik regime complicated this rationale.

The Treaty of Versailles, signed on 28 June 1919, regulated Poland&#x27;s western border. The Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920) had not made a definitive ruling in regard to Poland&#x27;s eastern border but on 8 December 1919, the Allied Supreme War Council issued a provisional boundary (its later version would be known as the Curzon Line). It was an attempt to define the areas that had an &quot;indisputably Polish ethnic majority&quot;. The permanent border was contingent on the Western powers&#x27; future negotiations with White Russia, presumed to prevail in the Russian Civil War. Piłsudski and his allies blamed Prime Minister Ignacy Paderewski for this outcome and caused his dismissal. Paderewski, embittered, withdrew from politics.
The leader of Russia&#x27;s new Bolshevik government, Vladimir Lenin, aimed to regain control of the territories abandoned by Russia in the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918 (the treaty was annulled by Russia on and to set up Soviet governments in the emerging countries in the western parts of the former Russian Empire. The more ambitious goal was to also reach Germany, where he expected a socialist revolution to break out. By the end of summer 1919, the Soviets had taken over most of eastern and central Ukraine (formerly parts of the Russian Empire) and driven the Directorate of Ukraine from Kiev. In February 1919, they set up the Socialist Soviet Republic of Lithuania and Belorussia (Litbel). However, it is unlikely that the Soviets forced planned further incursions westward.

From late 1919, Lenin, encouraged by the Red Army&#x27;s civil war victories over the White Russian forces and their Western allies, began to envision the future of world revolution with greater optimism. The Bolsheviks proclaimed the need for the dictatorship of the proletariat and agitated for a worldwide communist community. They intended to link the revolution in Russia with a communist Revolutions and interventions in Hungary (1918–1920) they had hoped for and to assist other communist movements in Europe. To be able to provide direct physical support to revolutionaries in the West, the Red Army would have to cross the territory of Romania.

According to the historian Andrzej Chwalba, however, the scenario was different in late 1919 and winter–spring 1920. The Soviets, facing decreasing revolutionary fervor in Europe and having to deal with Russia&#x27;s own problems, attempted to make peace with its neighbors, including Poland.

According to Aviel Roshwald, (Piłsudski) &quot;hoped to incorporate most of the territories of the defunct Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth into the future Polish state by structuring it as the Polish-led, multinational federation.&quot; Piłsudski had wanted to break up the Russian Empire and set up the &quot;Intermarium&quot; federation of various different states: Poland, Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine and other Central and East European countries that emerged from the crumbling empires after World War I. In Piłsudski&#x27;s vision, Poland would replace a truncated and vastly reduced Russia as the great power of Eastern Europe. His plan excluded negotiations prior to military victory. He had hoped that the new Poland-led union would become a counterweight to any potential imperialist intentions of Russia or Germany. Piłsudski believed that there could be no independent Poland without a Ukraine free of Russian control, thus his main interest was in splitting Ukraine from Russia. He used military force to expand the Polish borders in Galicia and Volhynia and crush a Ukrainian attempt at self-determination in the disputed territories east of the Curzon Line, which contained a significant Polish minority. On 7 February 1919, Piłsudski spoke on the subject of Poland&#x27;s future frontiers:&quot;At the moment Poland is essentially without borders and all that we can gain in this regard in the west depends on the Entente – on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany. In the east, it&#x27;s a different matter; there are doors here that open and close and it depends on who forces them open and how far&quot;.Polish military forces had thus set out to expand far in the eastern direction. As Piłsudski imagined, &quot;Closed within the boundaries of the 16th century, cut off from the Black Sea and Baltic Sea, deprived of land and mineral wealth of the South and South-east, Russia could easily move into the status of second-grade power. Poland, as the largest and strongest of the new states, could easily establish a sphere of influence stretching from Finland to the Caucasus&quot;.Piłsudski&#x27;s concepts appeared more progressive and democratic in comparison with the rival National Democracy&#x27;s plans, although both pursued the idea of direct incorporation and Polonization of the disputed eastern lands. However Piłsudski used his &quot;federation&quot; idea instrumentally. As he wrote to his close associate Leon Wasilewski in April 1919, (for now)&quot;I want to be neither an imperialist nor a federalist. ... Taking into account that, in this God&#x27;s world, an empty talk of the brotherhood of people and nations as well as the American little doctrines seem to be winning, I gladly side with the federalists&quot;.According to Chwalba, the differences between Piłsudski&#x27;s vision of Poland and that of his rival National Democratic leader Roman Dmowski were more rhetorical than real. Piłsudski had made many obfuscating statements, but never specifically stated his views regarding Poland&#x27;s eastern borders or political arrangements he intended for the region.

=== Preliminary hostilities ===
From late 1917, Polish revolutionary military units were formed in Russia. They were combined into the Western Rifle Division in October 1918. In summer 1918, a short-lived Polish communist government, led by Stefan Heltman, was created in Moscow. Both the military and civilian structures were meant to facilitate the eventual introduction of communism into Poland in the form of a Polish Soviet Republic.
Given the precarious situation resulting from the withdrawal of German forces from Belarus and Lithuania and the expected arrival of the Red Army there, Polish Self-Defence had been organized in autumn 1918 around major concentrations of Polish population, such as Minsk, Vilnius and Grodno. They were based on the Polish Military Organisation and were recognized as part of the Polish Armed Forces by the decree of Polish Chief of State Piłsudski, issued on 7 December 1918.

The German of &quot;Ober Ost&quot; declared on 15 November that its authority in Vilnius would be transferred to the Red Army.

In late autumn 1918, the Polish 4th Rifle Division fought the Red Army in Russia. The division operated under the authority of the Polish Army in France and General Józef Haller. Politically, the division fought under the Polish National Committee (KNP), recognized by the Allies as a temporary government of Poland. In January 1919, per Piłsudski&#x27;s decision, the 4th Rifle Division became part of the Polish Army.

The Polish Self-Defence forces were defeated by the Soviets at a number of locations. Minsk was taken by the Russian Western Army on 11 December 1918. The Socialist Soviet Republic of Byelorussia was declared there on 31 December. After three days of heavy fighting with the Western Rifle Division, the Self-Defence units withdrew from Vilnius on 5 January 1919. Polish–Soviet skirmishes continued in January and February.

The Polish armed forces were hurriedly formed to fight in several border wars. Two major formations manned the Russian front in February 1919: the northern, led by General Wacław Iwaszkiewicz-Rudoszański, and the southern, under General Antoni Listowski.

=== Polish–Ukrainian War ===

On 18 October 1918, the Ukrainian National Council was formed in Eastern Galicia, still part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; it was led by Yevhen Petrushevych. The establishment of a Ukrainian state there was proclaimed in November 1918; it had become known as the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and it claimed Lwów as its capital. Because of Russia-related political considerations, the Ukrainian attempts failed to generate support of the Entente powers.

Key buildings in Lwów were seized by the Ukrainians on 31 October 1918. On 1 November, Polish residents of the city counterattacked and the Polish–Ukrainian War began. Lwów was under Polish control from 22 November. To Polish politicians, the Polish claim to Lwów and eastern Galicia was indisputable; in April 1919, the Legislative Sejm unanimously declared that all of Galicia should be annexed by Poland. In April to June 1919, the Polish Blue Army of General Józef Haller arrived from France. It consisted of over 67,000 well-equipped and highly trained soldiers. The Blue Army helped drive the Ukrainian forces east past the Zbruch River and decisively contributed to the outcome of the war. The West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic was defeated by mid-July and eastern Galicia had come under Polish administration. The destruction of the West Ukrainian Republic confirmed the belief held by many Ukrainians that Poland was the main enemy of their nation.

From January 1919 fighting also took place in Volhynia, where the Poles faced the forces of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic led by Symon Petliura. The Polish offensive resulted in a takeover of the western part of the province. The Polish–Ukrainian warfare there was discontinued from late May, and in early September an armistice was signed.

On 21 November 1919, after contentious deliberations, the Allied Supreme War Council mandated Polish control over eastern Galicia for 25 years, with guarantees of autonomy for the Ukrainian population. The Conference of Ambassadors, which replaced the Supreme War Council, recognized the Polish claim to eastern Galicia in March 1923.

=== Polish intelligence ===
Jan Kowalewski, a polyglot and amateur cryptographer, broke the codes and ciphers of the army of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and of General Anton Denikin&#x27;s White Russian forces. In August 1919, he became chief of the Polish General Staff&#x27;s cryptography section in Warsaw. By early September, he had gathered a group of mathematicians from the University of Warsaw and the University of Lwów (most notably the founders of the Polish School of Mathematics – Stanisław Leśniewski, Stefan Mazurkiewicz and Wacław Sierpiński), who succeeded in breaking the Soviet Russian ciphers as well. During the Polish–Soviet War, the Polish decryption of Red Army radio messages made it possible to use Polish military forces efficiently against Soviet Russian forces and to win many individual battles, most importantly the Battle of Warsaw.

== War ==

=== Early progression of the conflict ===
On 5 January 1919, the Red Army took Vilnius, which led to the establishment of the Socialist Soviet Republic of Lithuania and Belorussia (Litbel) on 28 February. On 10 February, Soviet Russia&#x27;s People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs Georgy Chicherin wrote to Polish Prime Minister Ignacy Paderewski, proposing resolution of matters of disagreement and establishment of relations between the two states. It was one of the series of notes exchanged by the two governments in 1918 and 1919.

In February, Polish troops marched east to face the Soviets; the new Polish Sejm declared the need to liberate &quot;the northeast provinces of Poland with their capital in Wilno [Vilnius]&quot;. After the German World War I troops had been evacuated from the region, the Battle of Bereza Kartuska, a Polish–Soviet skirmish, took place. It occurred during a local Polish offensive action of 13–16 February, led by General Antoni Listowski, near Byaroza, Belarus. The event has been presented as the beginning of the war of liberation by the Polish side, or of Polish aggression by the Russian side. By late February, the Soviet westward offensive had come to a halt. As the low-level warfare continued, the Polish units crossed the Neman River, took Pinsk on 5 March and reached the outskirts of Lida; on 4 March, Piłsudski ordered further movement to the east stopped. The Soviet leadership had become preoccupied with the issue of providing military assistance to the Hungarian Soviet Republic and with the Siberian offensive of the White Army, led by Alexander Kolchak.

By July 1919 Polish armies eliminated the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. Secretly preparing an assault on Soviet-held Vilnius, in early April Piłsudski was able to shift some of the forces used in Ukraine to the northern front. The idea was to create a &quot;fait accompli&quot; and to prevent the Western powers from granting the territories claimed by Poland to White Russia (the Whites were expected to prevail in the Russian Civil War).

A new Polish offensive started on 16 April. Five thousand soldiers, led by Piłsudski, headed for Vilnius. Advancing to the east, the Polish forces took Lida on 17 April, Novogrudok on 18 April, Baranavichy on 19 April and Grodno on 28 April. Piłsudski&#x27;s group entered Vilnius on 19 April and captured the city after two days of fighting. The Polish action drove the Litbel government from its proclaimed capital.

Upon the taking of Vilnius, in pursuit of his federation objectives, Piłsudski issued a &quot;Proclamation to the inhabitants of the former Grand Duchy of Lithuania&quot; on 22 April. It was sharply criticized by his rival National Democrats, who demanded direct incorporation of the former Grand Duchy lands by Poland and signaled their opposition to Piłsudski&#x27;s territorial and political concepts. Piłsudski had thus proceeded to restore the historic territories of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by military means, leaving the necessary political determinations for later.

On 25 April, Lenin ordered the Western Front commander to reclaim Vilnius as soon as possible. The Red Army formations that attacked the Polish forces were defeated by Edward Rydz-Śmigły&#x27;s units between 30 April and 7 May. While the Poles extended their holdings further, the Red Army, unable to accomplish its objectives and facing intensified combat with the White forces elsewhere, withdrew from its positions.

The Polish &quot;Lithuanian–Belarusian Front&quot; was established on 15 May and placed under command of General Stanisław Szeptycki.

In a statute passed on 15 May, Polish Sejm called for the inclusion of the eastern borderline nations in the Polish state as autonomous entities. It was intended to make a positive impression on the participants at the Paris Peace Conference. At the conference, Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ignacy Paderewski declared Poland&#x27;s support for self-determination of the eastern nations, in line with Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s doctrine and in an effort to secure Western support for Poland&#x27;s policies in regard to Ukraine, Belarus and Lithuania.

The Polish offensive was discontinued around the line of German trenches and fortifications from World War I, because of high likelihood of Poland&#x27;s war with Weimar Germany over territorial and other issues. Half of Poland&#x27;s military strength had been concentrated on the German front by mid-June. The offensive in the east was resumed at the end of June, following the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty, signed and ratified by Germany, preserved the &quot;status quo&quot; in western Poland.

On the southern front in Volhynia, in May and in July the Polish forces confronted the Red Army, which was in process of pushing Petliura&#x27;s Ukrainian units out of the contested territories. The rural Orthodox population there was hostile to the Polish authorities and actively supported the Bolsheviks. Also in Podolia and near the eastern reaches of Galicia, the Polish armies kept slowly advancing to the east until December. They crossed the Zbruch River and displaced Soviet forces from a number of localities.

The Polish forces took Minsk on 8 August. The Berezina River was reached on 18 August. On 28 August, tanks were deployed for the first time and the town of Babruysk was captured. By 2 September, Polish units reached the Daugava River. Barysaw was taken on 10 September and parts of Polotsk on 21 September. By mid-September, the Poles secured the region along the Daugava from the Dysna River to Daugavpils. The frontline had also extended south, cutting through Polesia and Volhynia; along the Zbruch River it reached the Romanian border. A Red Army assault between the Daugava and Berezina Rivers was repelled in October and the front had become relatively inactive with sporadic encounters only, as the line designated by Piłsudski to be the goal of the Polish operation in the north was reached.

In autumn 1919, the Sejm voted to incorporate into Poland the conquered territories up to the Daugava and Berezina Rivers, including Minsk.

The Polish successes in summer 1919 resulted from the fact that the Soviets prioritized the war with the White forces, which was more crucial for them. The successes created an illusion of Polish military prowess and Soviet weakness. As Piłsudski put it, &quot;I am not worried about the strength of Russia; if I wanted to, I could go now, say to Moscow, and no one would be able to resist my power ...&quot;. The offensive was restrained in late summer by Piłsudski, because he did not want to improve the strategic situation of the advancing Whites.

In early summer 1919, the White movement had gained the initiative and its forces, commanded by Anton Denikin and known as the Volunteer Army, marched on Moscow. Piłsuski refused to join the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War because he considered the Whites more threatening to Poland than the Bolsheviks. Piłsudski&#x27;s adversarial relationship with tsarist Russia went back to the earlier stages of his career. He engaged in warfare with Soviet Russia from the beginning of his tenure as Polish commander-in-chief. Based on this experience, he underestimated the strength of the Bolsheviks. Piłsudski also thought he could get a better deal for Poland from the Bolsheviks than from the Whites, who represented, in his opinion, the old Russian imperial policies, hostile to strong Poland and Ukraine independent from Russia, Piłsudski&#x27;s main objectives. The Bolsheviks had proclaimed the partitions of Poland to be invalid and declared their support for self-determination of the Polish nation. Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the internationalist Bolsheviks, who were also alienated from the Western powers, than with the restored Russian Empire, its traditional nationalism, and its partnership with Western politics. By his refusal to join the attack on Lenin&#x27;s struggling government, he ignored strong pressure from the Triple Entente leaders and possibly saved the Bolshevik government in summer to fall 1919, although a full-scale attack by the Poles to support Denikin would not have been possible. Mikhail Tukhachevsky later commented on the likely disastrous consequences for the Bolsheviks if the Polish government undertook military cooperation with Denikin at the time of his advance on Moscow. In a book he later published, Denikin pointed at Poland as the savior of the Bolshevik power.

Denikin twice appealed to Piłsudski for help, in summer and in autumn 1919. According to Denikin, &quot;The defeat of the south of Russia will make Poland face the power that will become a calamity for the Polish culture and will threaten the existence of the Polish state&quot;. According to Piłsudski, &quot;The lesser evil is to facilitate a White Russia&#x27;s defeat by Red Russia. ... With any Russia, we fight for Poland. Let all that filthy West talk all they want; we&#x27;re not going to be dragged into and used for the fight against the Russian revolution. Quite to the contrary, in the name of permanent Polish interests, we want to make it easier for the revolutionary army to act against the counter-revolutionary army.&quot; On 12 December, the Red Army pushed Denikin out of Kiev.

The self-perceived interests of Poland and White Russia were irreconcilable. Piłsudski wanted to break up Russia and create a powerful Poland. Denikin, Alexander Kolchak and Nikolai Yudenich wanted territorial integrity for the &quot;one, great and indivisible Russia&quot;. Piłsudski held the Bolshevik military forces in low regard and thought of Red Russia as easy to defeat. The victorious in the civil war communists were going to be pushed far to the east and deprived of Ukraine, Belarus, the Baltic lands, and the southern Caucasus; they would no longer constitute a threat to Poland.

From the beginning of the conflict, many peace initiatives had been declared by the Polish and Russian sides, but they were intended as cover or stalling for time, as each side concentrated on military preparations and moves. One series of Polish-Soviet negotiations commenced in Białowieża after the termination of the summer 1919 military activities; they were moved in early November 1919 to Mikashevichy. Piłsudski&#x27;s associate met there with Lenin&#x27;s emissary Julian Marchlewski. Buoyed by their armies&#x27; successes in the Russian Civil War, the Soviet government rejected the tough Polish armistice conditions in December. Piłsudski broke off the Mikashevichy talks two days after the Soviet takeover of Kiev, but major military operations had not been resumed. Early in the talks, Boerner informed Marchlewski that Poland had no intention of renewing its offensive; it allowed the Soviets to move forty-three thousand troops from the Polish front to fight Denikin.

The only exception to the Polish policy of front stabilization since autumn 1919 was the winter attack on Daugavpils. Rydz-Śmigły&#x27;s previous attempts to capture the city in summer and early autumn had been unsuccessful. A secret political and military pact regarding a common attack on Daugavpils was signed between representatives of Poland and the Latvian Provisional Government on 30 December. On 3 January 1920, Polish and Latvian forces (30,000 Poles and 10,000 Latvians) commenced a joint operation against the surprised enemy. The Bolshevik 15th Army withdrew and had not been pursued; the fighting terminated on 25 January. The taking of Daugavpils was accomplished primarily by the 3rd Legions Infantry Division under Rydz-Śmigły. Afterwards, the town and its vicinity were handed over to the Latvians. The outcome of the campaign disrupted communications between Lithuanian and Russian forces. A Polish garrison was stationed in Daugavpils until July 1920. Simultaneously, the Latvian authorities pursued peace negotiations with the Soviets, which resulted in the signing of a preliminary armistice. Piłsudski and the Polish diplomacy were not notified and had not been aware of this development.

The fighting in 1919 resulted in the formation of a very long frontline, which, according to the historian Eugeniusz Duraczyński, favored Poland at this stage.

In late 1919 and early 1920, Piłsudski undertook his gargantuan task of breaking up Russia and creating the &quot;Intermarium&quot; bloc of countries. Given the refusal of Lithuania and other eastern Baltic region countries to participate in the project, he set his sights on Ukraine.

=== Abortive peace process ===
In late autumn 1919, to many Polish politicians it appeared that Poland had achieved strategically desirable borders in the east and therefore fighting the Bolsheviks should be terminated and peace negotiations should commence. The pursuit of peace also dominated popular sentiments and anti-war demonstrations had taken place.

The leadership of Soviet Russia confronted at that time a number of pressing internal and external problems. In order to effectively address the difficulties, they wanted to stop the warfare and offer peace to their neighbors, hoping to be able to come out of the international isolation they had been subjected to. Courted by the Soviets, the potential allies of Poland (Lithuania, Latvia, Romania, or the South Caucasus states) were unwilling to join a Polish-led anti-Soviet alliance. Faced with the diminishing revolutionary fervor in Europe, the Soviets were inclined to delay their hallmark project, a Soviet republic of Europe, to some indefinite future.

The peace offers sent to Warsaw by Russia&#x27;s Foreign Secretary Georgy Chicherin and other Russian governing institutions between late December 1919 and early February 1920 had not been responded to. The Soviets proposed a favorable for Poland troop demarcation line consistent with the current military frontiers, leaving permanent border determinations for later.

While the Soviet overtures generated considerable interests on the parts of the socialist, agrarian and nationalist political camps, the attempts of the Polish Sejm to prevent further warfare turned futile. Piłsudski, who ruled over the military and to a considerable degree over the weak civilian government, prevented any movement toward peace. By late February, he directed the Polish representatives to engage in pretended negotiations with the Soviets. Piłsudski and his collaborators stressed what they saw as the increasing with time Polish military advantage over the Red Army and their belief that the state of war had created highly favorable conditions for Poland&#x27;s economic development.

On 4 March 1920, General Władysław Sikorski initiated a new offensive in Polesia; the Polish forces had driven a wedge between Soviet forces to the north (Belarus) and south (Ukraine). The Soviet counter-offensive in Polesia and Volhynia was pushed back.

Polish–Russian peace negotiations in March 1920 produced no results. Piłsudski was not interested in a negotiated solution to the conflict. Preparations for a large-scale resumption of hostilities were being finalized and the newly declared (over the protest of a majority of parliamentary deputies) marshal and his circle expected the planned new offensive to lead to the fulfillment of Piłsudski&#x27;s federalist ideas.

On 7 April, Chicherin accused Poland of rejecting the Soviet peace offer and notified the Allies of the negative developments, urging them to prevent the forthcoming Polish aggression. The Polish diplomacy claimed the necessity to counteract the immediate threat of a Soviet assault in Belarus, but the Western opinion, to whom the Soviet arguments seemed reasonable, rejected the Polish narrative. The Soviet forces on the Belarusian front were weak at the time and the Bolsheviks had no plans for an offensive action.

=== Piłsudski&#x27;s alliance with Petliura ===
Having resolved Poland&#x27;s armed conflicts with the emerging Ukrainian states to Poland&#x27;s satisfaction, Piłsudski was able to work on a Polish–Ukrainian alliance against Russia. On 2 December 1919, Andriy Livytskyi and other Ukrainian diplomats declared their readiness to give up the Ukrainian claims to eastern Galicia and western Volhynia, in return for Poland&#x27;s recognition of the independence of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic (UPR). The Treaty of Warsaw, Piłsudski&#x27;s agreement with Hetman Symon Petliura, the exiled Ukrainian nationalist leader, and two other members of the Directorate of Ukraine, was signed on 21 April 1920. It appeared to be Piłsudski&#x27;s major success, potentially signifying the beginning of a successful implementation of his long-held designs. Petliura, who formally represented the government of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, which had &quot;de facto&quot; been defeated by the Bolsheviks, fled with some Ukrainian troops to Poland, where he found political asylum. His control extended only to a sliver of land near the Polish-controlled areas. Petliura had therefore little choice but to accept the Polish offer of alliance, largely on Polish terms, as determined by the outcome of the recent warfare between the two nations.

By concluding an agreement with Piłsudski, Petliura accepted the Polish territorial gains in western Ukraine and the future Polish–Ukrainian border along the Zbruch River. In exchange for renouncing the Ukrainian territorial claims, he was promised independence for Ukraine and Polish military assistance in reinstating his government in Kiev. Given the powerful opposition against Piłsudski&#x27;s eastern policy in war-tired Poland, the negotiations with Petliura were conducted in secrecy and the text of the 21 April agreement remained secret. Poland recognized in it Ukraine&#x27;s right to parts of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (before 1772) east of the Zbruch. A military convention was added on 24 April; it placed Ukrainian units under Polish command. By 1 May, a Polish–Ukrainian trade agreement was negotiated. It had not been signed, to prevent its far-ranging provisions anticipating exploitation of Ukraine by Poland from being revealed and from causing catastrophic damage to Petliura&#x27;s political reputation.
For Piłsudski, the alliance gave his campaign for the &quot;Intermarium&quot; federation an actual starting point and potentially the most important federation partner, satisfied his demands regarding parts of Polish eastern border relevant to the proposed Ukrainian state and laid a foundation for a Polish-dominated Ukrainian state between Russia and Poland. According to Richard K. Debo, while Petliura could not contribute real strength to the Polish offensive, for Piłsudski the alliance provided some camouflage for the &quot;naked aggression involved&quot;. For Petliura, it was the final chance to preserve the Ukrainian statehood and at least a theoretical independence of the Ukrainian heartlands, despite his acceptance of the loss of West Ukrainian lands to Poland.

The British and the French did not recognize the UPR and blocked its admission to the League of Nations in autumn 1920. The treaty with the Ukrainian republic did not generate any international support for Poland. It caused new tensions and conflicts, especially within the Ukrainian movements that aimed for the country&#x27;s independence.

Regarding the deal they had concluded, both leaders encountered strong opposition in their respective countries. Piłsudski faced stiff opposition from Roman Dmowski&#x27;s National Democrats, who opposed Ukrainian independence. To protest the alliance and the upcoming war over Ukraine, Stanisław Grabski resigned the chairmanship of the foreign affairs committee in the Sejm, where the National Democrats were a dominant force (their approval would be needed to finalize any future political settlement). Petliura was criticized by many Ukrainian politicians for entering a pact with the Poles and for abandoning western Ukraine (after the destruction of the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, western Ukraine was – from their point of view – occupied by Poland).

During their occupation of the territory meant for the UPR, Polish officials engaged in forced requisitions, some of which were intended for troop supply, but also in extensive looting of Ukraine and its people. It ranged from activities approved and promoted at the highest level, such as the widespread theft of trains loaded with goods, to plunder perpetrated by Polish soldiers in Ukrainian countryside and cities. In his 29 April and 1 May letters to General Kazimierz Sosnkowski and Prime Minister Leopold Skulski, Piłsudski emphasized that the railroad booty had been enormous, but he could not divulge further because the appropriations took place in violation of Poland&#x27;s treaty with Ukraine.

The alliance with Petliura gave Poland 15,000 allied Ukrainian troops at the beginning of the Kiev campaign, which increased to 35,000 by recruitment and from Soviet deserters during the war. According to Chwalba, 60,000 Polish soldiers and 4,000 Ukrainians took part in the original offensive; there were only 22,488 Ukrainian soldiers on the Polish food ration list as of 1 September 1920.

=== From Kiev offensive to armistice ===
==== Polish forces ====

The Polish Army was made up of soldiers who had served in the armies of the partitioning empires (especially professional officers), as well as many new enlistees and volunteers. The soldiers had come from different armies, formations, backgrounds and traditions. While veterans of Piłsudski&#x27;s Polish Legions and the Polish Military Organisation formed a privileged stratum, integrating the Greater Poland Army and the Blue Army into the national force presented many challenges. The unification of the Greater Poland Army led by General Józef Dowbor-Muśnicki (a highly regarded force of 120,000 soldiers), and the Blue Army led by General Józef Haller, with the main Polish Army under Piłsudski, had been finalized on 19 October 1919 in Kraków, in a symbolic ceremony.

Within the young Polish state whose continuous existence was uncertain, members of many groups resisted conscription. For example, Polish peasants and small town dwellers, Jews, or Ukrainians from Polish-controlled territories tended to avoid service in Polish armed forces for different reasons. The Polish military was overwhelmingly ethnically Polish and Catholic. The intensifying desertion problem in summer 1920 led to the introduction of death penalty for desertion in August. The summary military trials and the executions often took place on the same day.

Female soldiers functioned as members of the Voluntary Legion of Women; they were normally assigned auxiliary duties. A system of military training for officers and soldiers was established with significant help from the French Military Mission to Poland.

The Polish Air Force had about two thousand planes, mostly old. 45% of them had been captured from the enemy. Only two hundred could be airborne at any given time. They were used for various purposes including combat, but mostly for reconnaissance. 150 French pilots and navigators flew as part of the French Mission.

According to Norman Davies, estimating the strength of the opposing sides is difficult and even generals often had incomplete reports of their own forces.

The Polish forces grew from approximately 100,000 by the end of 1918 to over 500,000 in early 1920 and 800,000 in the spring of that year. Before the Battle of Warsaw, the army reached the total strength of about one million soldiers, including 100,000 volunteers.

The Polish armed forces were aided by military members of Western missions, especially the French Military Mission. Poland was supported, in addition to the allied Ukrainian forces (over twenty thousand soldiers), by Russian and Belarusian units and volunteers of many nationalities. Twenty American pilots served in the Kościuszko Squadron. Their contributions in spring and summer 1920 on the Ukrainian front were considered to be of critical importance.

Russian anti-Bolshevik units fought on the Polish side. About one thousand White soldiers fought in summer 1919. The largest Russian formation was sponsored by the Russian Political Committee represented by Boris Savinkov and commanded by General Boris Permikin. The &quot;3rd Russian Army&quot; reached over ten thousand battle-ready soldiers and in early October 1920 was dispatched to the front to fight on the Polish side; they did not engage in combat because of the armistice that took effect at that time. Six thousand soldiers fought valiantly on the Polish side in the &quot;Cossack&quot; Russian units from 31 May 1920. Various smaller Belarusian formations fought in 1919 and 1920. However, the Russian, Cossack and Belarusian military organizations had their own political agendas and their participation has been marginalized or omitted in the Polish war narrative.

Soviet losses and the spontaneous enrollment of Polish volunteers allowed rough numerical parity between the two armies; by the time of the Battle of Warsaw, the Poles may have had gained a slight advantage in numbers and logistics. One of the major formations on the Polish side was the First Polish Army.

==== Red Army ====
In early 1918, Lenin and Leon Trotsky embarked on the rebuilding of the Russian armed forces. The new Red Army was established by the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars (Sovnarkom) on 28 January, to replace the demobilized Imperial Russian Army. Trotsky became commissar of war on 13 March and Georgy Chicherin took over Trotsky&#x27;s previous job as foreign minister. On 18 April, the Commissar Bureau was created; it initiated the practice of assigning political commissars to military formations. One million German soldiers occupied the western Russian Empire, but on 1 October, after the first indications of German defeat in the West, Lenin ordered general conscription with the intention of building a multi-million member army. While over 50,000 former tsarist officers had joined the White Army, 75,000 of them ended up in the Red Army by summer 1919.

The Revolutionary Military Council of the Russian Republic was established in September 1918. It was chaired by Trotsky. Trotsky lacked military experience or expertise, but knew how to mobilize troops and was a master of war propaganda. Revolutionary war councils of particular fronts and armies were placed under the council of the republic. The system was intended as implementation of the concept of collective leadership and management of military affairs.

The Red Army&#x27;s chief commander, from July 1919, was Sergey Kamenev; he was installed by Joseph Stalin. Kamenev&#x27;s Field Staff was led by former tsarist generals. His every decision had to be approved by the Military Council. The actual command center was placed in an armored train, used by Trotsky to travel around the front areas and coordinate military activity.

Hundreds of thousands of recruits deserted from the Red Army, which resulted in 600 public executions in the second half of 1919. The army, however, conducted operations on several fronts and had remained an effective fighting force.

Officially, there were five million soldiers in the Red Army as of 1 August 1920, but only 10 or 12 percent of them could be counted as the actual fighting force. Female volunteers served in combat on the same basis as men, also in Semyon Budyonny&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Army. The Red Army was particularly weak in the areas of logistics, supplies, and communication. Great quantities of Western arms had been captured from the White and Allied forces and domestic production of military equipment kept increasing throughout the war. Still, the stocks were often critically short. As in the Polish Army, boots had been in short supply and many fought barefoot. There were relatively few Soviet airplanes (220 at the most at the Western Front) and the Polish air formations soon came to dominate the air space.
When the Poles launched their Kiev offensive, the Russian Southwestern Front had about 83,000 Soviet soldiers, including 29,000 front-line troops. The Poles had some numerical superiority, which was estimated from 12,000 to 52,000 personnel. During the Soviet counter-offensive in mid-1920, on all fronts, the Soviets numbered about 790,000, at least 50,000 more than the Poles. Mikhail Tukhachevsky estimated that he had 160,000 combat ready soldiers, while Piłsudski estimated Tukhachevsky&#x27;s forces at 200,000–220,000.

In 1920, the Red Army personnel numbered 402,000 on the Soviet Western Front and 355,000 on the Southwestern Front in Galicia, according to Davies. Grigori F. Krivosheev gives 382,071 personnel for the Western Front and 282,507 for the Southwestern Front between July and August.

After the reorganization of the Western Rifle Division in mid-1919, there were no separate Polish units within the Red Army. Within both the Western and the Southwestern Fronts, besides Russian units, there had been separate Ukrainian, Latvian, and German–Hungarian units. In addition, many communists of various nationalities, for example the Chinese, fought in integrated units. The Lithuanian Army supported the Soviet forces to some degree.

Among the commanders leading the Red Army offensive were Semyon Budyonny, Leon Trotsky, Sergey Kamenev, Mikhail Tukhachevsky (the new commander of the Western Front), Alexander Yegorov (the new commander of the Southwestern Front), and Hayk Bzhishkyan.

==== Logistics and plans ====
Logistics were very bad for both armies and were supported by whatever equipment was left over from World War I or could be captured. The Polish Army, for example, used guns made in five countries and rifles manufactured in six, each of which used different ammunition. The Soviets had at their disposal many military depots that were left by the German armies after their withdrawal in 1918–1919, and modern French armaments that were captured in great numbers from the White Russians and the Allied expeditionary forces during the Russian Civil War. Still, they suffered a shortage of arms, as both the Red Army and the Polish forces were grossly underequipped by Western standards.

However, the Red Army had at its disposal an extensive arsenal as well as fully functional armament industry concentrated in Tula, both inherited from tsarist Russia. In contrast, the partitioning powers had all deliberately avoided industrializing ethnically Polish territories, let alone permit the establishment of any meaningful armaments industry within them. As a result, there were no firearm factories in Poland and everything, including rifles and ammunition, had to be imported. Gradual progress in the area of military manufacturing had been made and after the war there were in Poland 140 industrial establishments producing military items.

The Polish–Soviet War was fought not by trench warfare but by maneuverable formations. The total front was 1500 km (over 900 mi) long and was manned by relatively small amounts of troops. Around the time of the Battle of Warsaw and afterwards, the Soviets suffered from overly long transportation lines and had been unable to supply their forces in a timely manner.

By early 1920, the Red Army had been very successful against the White movement. In January 1920, the Soviets began concentrating forces on the Polish northern front, along the Berezina River. British Prime Minister David Lloyd George ordered the Baltic Sea blockade of Soviet Russia lifted. Estonia signed with Russia the Treaty of Tartu on 3 February, recognizing the Bolshevik government. European arms merchants proceeded with supplying the Soviets with items needed by the military, for which the Russian government paid with gold and valuables taken from the imperial stock and confiscated from individuals.

From early 1920, both the Polish and Soviet sides had prepared for decisive confrontations. However, Lenin and Trotsky had not yet been able to dispose of all the White forces, including especially the army of Pyotr Wrangel, threatening them from the south. Piłsudski, unconstrained by such limitations, was able to attack first. Convinced that the Whites were no longer a threat to Poland, he resolved to take care of the remaining enemy, the Bolsheviks. The plan for the Kiev offensive was to beat the Red Army on Poland&#x27;s southern flank and to install the pro-Polish Petliura government in Ukraine.

Victor Sebestyen, author of a 2017 biography of Lenin, wrote: &quot;The newly independent Poles started the war. With England and France&#x27;s backing, they invaded Ukraine in spring 1920.&quot; Some Allied leaders had not supported Poland, including former British Prime Minister H. H. Asquith, who called the Kiev offensive &quot;a purely aggressive adventure, a wanton enterprise&quot;. Sebestyen characterized Piłsudski as a &quot;Polish nationalist, not a socialist&quot;.

==== Kiev offensive ====


On 17 April 1920, the Polish General Staff ordered the armed forces to assume attack positions. The Red Army, which had been regrouping since 10 March, was not fully ready for combat. The main goal of the military operation was to create a Ukrainian state, formally independent but under Polish patronage, which would separate Poland from Russia.

On 25 April, the southern group of Polish armies under Piłsudski&#x27;s command commenced an offensive in the direction of Kiev. The Polish forces were assisted by thousands of Ukrainian soldiers under Petliura, who represented the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic.

Alexander Yegorov, commander of the Russian Southwestern Front, had at his disposal the 12th and 14th Armies. They faced the invading force, but were small (15,000 battle-ready soldiers), weak, poorly equipped and had been distracted by peasant rebellions in Russia. Yegorov&#x27;s armies had been gradually reinforced since the Soviets had found out of the Polish war preparations.

On 26 April, in his &quot;Call to the People of Ukraine&quot;, Piłsudski told his intended audience that &quot;the Polish Army would only stay as long as necessary until a legal Ukrainian government took control over its own territory&quot;. However, although many Ukrainians were anti-communist, many were anti-Polish and resented the Polish advance.

The well-equipped and highly mobile Polish 3rd Army under Rydz-Śmigły quickly overpowered the Red Army in Ukraine. The Soviet 12th and 14th Armies had for the most part declined to engage in combat and suffered limited losses; they withdrew or were pushed past the Dnieper River. On 7 May, the combined Polish–Ukrainian forces, led by Rydz-Śmigły, encountered only token resistance as they entered Kiev, mostly abandoned by the Soviet military.

The Soviets proceeded with their first counteroffensive using the Western Front forces. Following the order of Trotsky, Mikhail Tukhachevsky launched an offensive on the Belarusian front before the (planned by the Polish command) arrival of Polish troops from the Ukrainian front. On his forces attacked the somewhat weaker Polish armies there and penetrated the Polish-held areas (territories between the Daugava and the Berezina Rivers) to the depth of 100 km. After two Polish divisions arrived from Ukraine and the new Reserve Army was assembled, Stanisław Szeptycki, Kazimierz Sosnkowski and Leonard Skierski led a Polish counteroffensive from 28 May. The result was the Polish recovery of the bulk of the lost territory. From 8 June, the front had stabilised near the Avuta River and remained inactive until July.

This Polish thrust into Ukraine was met with Red Army counterattacks from 29 May. By that time, Yegorov&#x27;s Southwestern Front had been considerably reinforced and he initiated an assault maneuver in the Kiev area.

Semyon Budyonny&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Army (&quot;Konarmia&quot;) conducted repeated attacks and broke the Polish–Ukrainian front on 5 June. The Soviets deployed mobile cavalry units to disrupt the Polish rearguard and target communications and logistics. By 10 June, the Polish armies were in retreat along the entire front. Following Piłsudski&#x27;s order, Rydz-Śmigły, with the Polish and Ukrainian troops under his command, abandoned Kiev (the city was not being attacked) to the Red Army.

==== Soviet victories ====
On 29 April 1920, the Central Committee of the Bolshevik Communist Party of Russia appealed for volunteers for the war with Poland, to defend the Russian republic against a Polish usurpation. The first units of the volunteer army departed Moscow and headed for the front on 6 May. On 9 May, the Soviet newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; printed an article &quot;Go West!&quot; (): &quot;Through the corpse of White Poland lies the way to the World Inferno. On bayonets, we will carry happiness and peace to working humanity&quot;. On 30 May 1920, General Aleksei Brusilov, the last Tsarist commander-in-chief, published in &quot;Pravda&quot; an appeal titled &quot;To All Former Officers, Wherever They Might Be&quot;, in which he encouraged anti-Bolshevik Russians to forgive past grievances and join the Red Army. Brusilov considered it a patriotic duty of all Russian officers to enlist with the Bolshevik government, which he thought to be defending Russia against foreign invaders. Lenin understood the importance of the appeal to Russian nationalism. The Soviet counteroffensive was indeed boosted by Brusilov&#x27;s call: 14,000 former Imperial Russian Army officers and over 100,000 soldiers of lower ranks enlisted in or returned to the Red Army. Thousands of civilian volunteers also contributed to the war effort.

The 3rd Army and other Polish formations avoided destruction in the course of their long retreat from the Kiev frontier, but remained tied down in western Ukraine. They could not support the Polish northern front and reinforce, as planned by Piłsudski, the defences at the Avuta River.

Poland&#x27;s 320 km (200 mi) long northern front was manned by a thin line of 120,000 troops, backed by some 460 artillery pieces, with no strategic reserves. This approach to holding ground harked back to the World War I practice of establishing a fortified line of defense. The Polish–Soviet front, however, bore little resemblance to that war&#x27;s conditions, as it was weakly manned, supported with inadequate artillery, and had almost no fortifications. Such arrangement allowed the Soviets to attain numerical superiority at strategically crucial locations.

Against the Polish line, the Red Army gathered its Western Front led by Tukhachevsky. Its numbers exceeded 108,000 infantry and 11,000 cavalry, supported by 722 artillery pieces and 2,913 machine guns.

According to Chwalba, Tukhachevsky&#x27;s 3rd, 4th, 15th and 16th Armies had a total of 270,000 soldiers and a 3:1 advantage over the Poles in the area of the Western Front&#x27;s attack.

A stronger and better prepared Soviet second northern offensive was launched on 4 July along the Smolensk–Brest axis and crossed the Avuta and the Berezina Rivers. Important role was played by the 3rd Cavalry Corps, known as the &quot;assault army&quot; and led by Hayk Bzhishkyan. On the first day of fighting, the Polish first and second lines of defense were overpowered and on 5 July the Polish forces commenced a full and quick retreat along the entire front. The combat strength of the First Polish Army was reduced by 46% during the first week of fighting. The retreat soon turned into a chaotic and disorganized flight.

On 9 July, Lithuania&#x27;s talks with the Soviets commenced. The Lithuanians launched a series of attacks against the Poles and disorganized the planned relocation of Polish forces. Polish troops withdrew from Minsk on 

Along the line of old German trenches and fortifications from World War I, only Lida was defended for two days. Bzhishkyan&#x27;s units together with Lithuanian forces captured Vilnius on 14 July. To the south, in eastern Galicia, Budyonny&#x27;s cavalry approached Brody, Lwów and Zamość. It had become clear to the Poles that the Soviet objectives were not limited to countering the effects of the Kiev offensive but that Poland&#x27;s independent existence was at stake.

The Soviet armies moved toward the west at a remarkable speed. Carrying out a bold maneuver, Bzhishkyan took Grodno on 19 July; the strategically important and easy to defend Osowiec Fortress was captured by Bzhishkyan&#x27;s 3rd Cavalry Corps on 27 July. Białystok fell on 28 July and Brest on 29 July. A Polish counteroffensive Piłsudski aimed for was thwarted by the unexpected fall of Brest. The Polish high command attempted to defend the Bug River line, reached by the Russians on 30 July, but the quick loss of the Brest Fortress forced a cancellation of Piłsudski&#x27;s plans. On the same day Polish forces delayed the Soviet offensive in the Battle of Żabinka. After crossing the Narew River on 2 August, the Western Front was only about 100 km (62 mi) from Warsaw.

By that time, however, Polish resistance intensified. The shortened front facilitated greater concentrations of Polish troops involved in defensive operations; they were being constantly reinforced due to the closeness of Polish population centers and the influx of volunteers. Polish supply lines had become short, while the opposite was true regarding the enemy logistics. As General Sosnkowski was able to generate and energize 170,000 new Polish soldiers within a few weeks, Tukhachevsky noted that instead of quickly concluding their mission as expected, his force encountered determined resistance.

The Southwestern Front pushed the Polish forces out of most of Ukraine. Stalin thwarted Sergey Kamenev&#x27;s orders and directed the formations under Budyonny&#x27;s command to close on Zamość and Lwów, the largest city in eastern Galicia and garrison of the Polish 6th Army. The protracted Battle of Lwów began in July 1920. Stalin&#x27;s action was detrimental to the situation of the forces of Tukhachevsky in the north, since Tukhachevsky needed relief from Budyonny near Warsaw, where in August decisive battles were fought. Instead of performing a concentric attack on Warsaw, the two Soviet fronts were getting further apart. Piłsudski used the resulting void to launch his counteroffensive on 16 August, during the Battle of Warsaw.

Fighting the Battle of Brody and Berestechko (29 July–3 August), the Polish forces attempted to stop Budyonny&#x27;s advance on Lwów, but the effort was terminated by Piłsudski, who mustered two divisions to take part in the approaching struggle for the Polish capital.

On 1 August 1920, Polish and Soviet delegations met at Baranavichy and exchanged notes, but their armistice talks produced no results.

==== Diplomatic front ====

The Western Allies were critical of Polish politics and unhappy with Poland&#x27;s refusal to cooperate with the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War, but they supported the Polish forces fighting the Red Army nevertheless, shipping to Poland armaments, extending credits and supporting the country politically. France was especially disappointed, but also particularly interested in defeating the Bolsheviks, so Poland was a natural ally in this respect. British politicians represented a gamut of opinions on the Polish–Russian issue, but many were highly critical of Polish policies and actions. In January 1920, the United States Secretary of War Newton D. Baker accused Poland of conducting imperial politics at the expense of Russia. In early spring 1920 the Allies, irritated by the Polish conduct, considered the idea of transferring the lands east of the Bug River to Allied control, under auspices of the League of Nations.

In autumn 1919, the British government of Prime Minister David Lloyd George agreed to provide arms for Poland. On 17 May 1920, following the Polish takeover of Kiev, the cabinet spokesman asserted in the House of Commons that &quot;no assistance has been or is being given to the Polish government&quot;.

The initial success of the Kiev offensive caused enormous euphoria in Poland and Piłsudski&#x27;s leading role was recognized by most politicians. However, with the tide turning against Poland, Piłsudski&#x27;s political power weakened, and that of his opponents, including Roman Dmowski, rose. The government of Leopold Skulski, Piłsudski&#x27;s ally, resigned in early June. After protracted bickering, an extra-parliamentary government of Władysław Grabski was appointed on 23 June 1920.

The Western Allies were worried by the progress of the Bolshevik armies but blamed Poland for the situation. The conduct of Polish leaders was adventurous in their opinion and amounted to foolishly playing with fire. It could lead to the destruction of the work of the Paris Peace Conference. Western societies wanted peace and good relations with Russia.

As the Soviet armies advanced, the Soviet leadership&#x27;s confidence soared. In a telegram, Lenin exclaimed, &quot;We must direct all our attention to preparing and strengthening the Western Front. A new slogan must be announced: Prepare for war against Poland&quot;. The Soviet communist theorist Nikolai Bukharin, writing for the newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;, wished for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw, &quot;right up to London and Paris&quot;. According to General Tukhachevsky&#x27;s exhortation, &quot;Over the corpse of White Poland lies the path to world conflagration ... On to ... Warsaw! Forward!&quot; As the victory seemed more certain to them, Stalin and Trotsky engaged in political intrigues and argued about the direction of main Soviet offensive.

At the height of the Polish–Soviet conflict, Jews were subjected to antisemitic violence by Polish forces, who considered them a potential threat and often accused of supporting the Bolsheviks. The perpetrators of the pogroms that took place were motivated by &quot;Żydokomuna&quot; accusations. During the Battle of Warsaw, the Polish authorities interned Jewish soldiers and volunteers and sent them to an internment camp.

To counter the immediate Soviet threat, national resources were urgently mobilized in Poland and competing political factions declared unity. On 1 July, the Council of Defense of the State was appointed. On 6 July, Piłsudski was outvoted in the council, which resulted in the trip of Prime Minister Grabski to the Spa Conference in Belgium made to request Allied assistance for Poland and their mediation in setting up peace negotiations with Soviet Russia. The Allied representatives made a number of demands as conditions for their involvement. On 10 July, Grabski signed an agreement containing several terms as required by the Allies: Polish forces would withdraw to the border intended to delineate Poland&#x27;s eastern ethnographic frontier and published by the Allies on 8 December 1919; Poland would participate in a subsequent peace conference; and the questions of sovereignty over Vilnius, Eastern Galicia, Cieszyn Silesia and Danzig would be left up to the Allies. Promises of possible Allied help in mediating the Polish–Soviet conflict were made in exchange.

On 11 July 1920, the British Foreign Secretary George Curzon sent a telegram to Georgy Chicherin. It requested the Soviets to halt their offensive at what had since become known as the Curzon Line and to accept it as a temporary border with Poland (along the Bug and San Rivers) until a permanent border could be established in negotiations. Talks in London with Poland and the Baltic states were proposed. In case of a Soviet refusal, the British threatened to assist Poland with unspecified measures. Roman Dmowski&#x27;s reaction was that Poland&#x27;s &quot;defeat was greater than the Poles had realized&quot;. In the Soviet response issued on 17 July, Chicherin rejected the British mediation and declared willingness to negotiate only directly with Poland. Both the British and the French reacted with more definitive promises of help with military equipment for Poland.

The Second Congress of the Communist International deliberated in Moscow between 19 July and 7 August 1920. Lenin spoke of the increasingly favorable odds for the accomplishment of the World Proletarian Revolution, which would lead to the World Soviet Republic; the delegates eagerly followed daily reports from the front. The congress issued an appeal to workers in all countries, asking them to forestall their governments&#x27; efforts to aid &quot;White&quot; Poland.

Piłsudski lost another vote at the Defense Council and on 22 July the government dispatched a delegation to Moscow to ask for armistice talks. The Soviets claimed interest in peace negotiations only, the subject the Polish delegation was not authorized to discuss.

Sponsored by the Soviets, the Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee (Polrewkom) was formed on 23 July to organise the administration of Polish territories captured by the Red Army. The committee was led by Julian Marchlewski; Feliks Dzierżyński and Józef Unszlicht were among its members. They found little support in Soviet-controlled Poland. On 30 July in Białystok, the Polrewkom decreed the end of the Polish &quot;gentry–bourgeoisie&quot; government. At Polrewkom&#x27;s Białystok rally on 2 August, its representatives were greeted on behalf of Soviet Russia, the Bolshevik party and the Red Army by Mikhail Tukhachevsky. The Galician Revolutionary Committee (Galrewkom) was established already on 8 July.

On 24 July, the all-party Polish Government of National Defense under Wincenty Witos and Ignacy Daszyński was established. It eagerly adopted a radical program of land reform meant to counter Bolshevik propaganda (the scope of the promised reform was greatly reduced once the Soviet threat had receded). The government attempted to conduct peace negotiations with Soviet Russia; a new Polish delegation tried to cross the front and establish contact with the Soviets from 5 August. On 9 August, General Kazimierz Sosnkowski became Minister of Military Affairs.

Piłsudski was severely criticized by politicians ranging from Dmowski to Witos. His military competence and judgement were questioned and he displayed signs of mental instability. However, a majority of members of the Council of National Defense, which was asked by Piłsudski to rule on his fitness to lead the military, quickly expressed their &quot;full confidence&quot;. Dmowski, disappointed, resigned his membership in the council and left Warsaw.

Poland suffered from sabotage and delays in deliveries of war supplies when Czechoslovak and German workers refused to transit such materials to Poland. After 24 July in Danzig, given the Germany-instigated strike of seaport workers, the British official and Allied representative Reginald Tower, having consulted the British government, used his soldiers to unload commodities heading for Poland. On 6 August, the British Labour Party printed in a pamphlet that British workers would not take part in the war as Poland&#x27;s allies. In 1920 London dockworkers refused to allow a ship bound for Poland until the weapons were off-loaded. The Trades Union Congress, the Parliamentary Labour Party, and the National Executive Committee also all threatened a general strike if the British Armed Forces directly intervened in Poland. The French Section of the Workers&#x27; International declared in its newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Humanité&quot;: &quot;Not a man, not a sou, not a shell for the reactionary and capitalist Poland. Long live the Russian Revolution! Long live the Workers&#x27; International!&quot;. Weimar Germany, Austria and Belgium banned transit of materials destined for Poland through their territories. On 6 August the Polish government issued an &quot;Appeal to the World&quot;, which disputed the charges of Polish imperialism and stressed Poland&#x27;s belief in self-determination and the dangers of a Bolshevik invasion of Europe.

Hungary offered to send a 30,000 cavalry corps to Poland&#x27;s aid, but President Tomáš Masaryk and Foreign Minister Edvard Beneš of Czechoslovakia were opposed to assisting Poland and the Czechoslovak government refused to allow them through. On 9 August 1920, Czechoslovakia declared neutrality regarding the Polish–Soviet War. Significant amounts of military and other badly needed supplies from Hungary did arrive in Poland. The leading Polish commander Tadeusz Rozwadowski spoke of the Hungarians in September 1920: &quot;You were the only nation that really wanted to help us&quot;.

The Soviets presented their armistice conditions to the Allies on 8 August in Britain. Sergey Kamenev issued assurances of Soviet recognition of Poland&#x27;s independence and right to self-determination, but the conditions he presented amounted to demands for surrender of the Polish state. Prime Minister David Lloyd George and the British House of Commons approved the Soviet demands as just and reasonable and the British ambassador in Warsaw presented the United Kingdom&#x27;s categorical advice on that matter to Foreign Minister Eustachy Sapieha. On 14 August, the Polish delegation finally went to Tukhachevsky&#x27;s headquarters in Minsk for the official peace talks. Severe conditions for peace were presented to them by Georgy Chicherin on 17 August. Decisive battles were already taking place on the outskirts of Warsaw. Most foreign deputations and Allied missions had left the Polish capital and went to Poznań.

In summer 1919, Lithuania had been engaged in territorial disputes and armed skirmishes with Poland over the city of Vilnius and the areas around Sejny and Suwałki. Piłsudski&#x27;s attempt to take control of Lithuania by engineering a coup in August 1919 contributed to worsening of the relations. The Soviet and Lithuanian governments signed on 12 July 1920 the Soviet–Lithuanian Peace Treaty; it recognised Vilnius and extended territories as parts of a proposed Greater Lithuania. The treaty contained a secret clause that allowed Soviet forces unrestricted movement in Lithuania during any Soviet war with Poland, which led to questions regarding Lithuanian neutrality during the ongoing Polish–Soviet War. The Lithuanians also provided the Soviets with logistic support. Following the treaty, the Red Army occupied Vilnius; the Soviets returned the city to Lithuanian control just before it was recaptured by Polish forces in late August. The Soviets had also encouraged their own communist government, the Litbel, and planned a Soviet-sponsored Lithuanian regime when they win the war with Poland. The Soviet–Lithuanian Treaty was a Soviet diplomatic victory and Polish defeat; it had, as predicted by the Russian diplomat Adolph Joffe, a destabilizing effect on Poland&#x27;s internal politics.

The French Military Mission to Poland of four hundred members arrived in 1919. It consisted mostly of French officers but included also a few British advisers led by Adrian Carton de Wiart. In summer 1920, there were one thousand officers and soldiers in the mission, under General Paul Prosper Henrys. Members of the French Mission, through the training programs they conducted and frontline involvement, contributed to battle readiness of Polish forces. The French officers included Captain Charles de Gaulle. During the Polish–Soviet War he won the Virtuti Militari, Poland&#x27;s highest military decoration. In France, de Gaulle had enlisted in General Józef Haller&#x27;s &quot;Blue Army&quot;. The army&#x27;s transit to Poland in 1919 was facilitated by France. Blue Army troops were mostly of Polish origin but included also international volunteers who had been under French command during World War I. In 1920, France was reluctant to aid Poland in Poland&#x27;s war with Soviet Russia. Only after the Soviet armistice conditions were presented on 8 August, France declared, through its representative in Warsaw, the intention to support Poland morally, politically and materially in its fight for independence.

On 25 July 1920, the expanded Interallied Mission to Poland arrived in Warsaw. Led by the British diplomat Edgar Vincent, it included the French diplomat Jean Jules Jusserand and Maxime Weygand, chief of staff to Marshal Ferdinand Foch, the supreme commander of the victorious Entente. The Allied politicians expected to assume control over Poland&#x27;s foreign affairs and military policies, with Weygand becoming top military commander in the war. It was not allowed and General Weygand accepted an advisory position. The dispatch of the Allied mission to Warsaw was a proof that the West had not given up on Poland and gave the Poles a reason to believe that not all was lost. The mission members made a significant contribution to the war effort. However, the crucial Battle of Warsaw was fought and won primarily by the Poles. Many in the West erroneously believed that it was the timely arrival of the Allies that had saved Poland; Weygand occupied the central role in the myth that was created.

As Polish–French cooperation continued, French weaponry, including infantry armament, artillery and Renault FT tanks, were shipped to Poland to reinforce its military. On 21 February 1921, France and Poland agreed to a formal military alliance. During the Polish-Soviet negotiations, Polish Ministry of Foreign Affairs paid particular attention to keeping the Allies informed of their course and making them feel co-responsible for the outcome.

The Soviet emphasis had gradually shifted from promoting world revolution to dismantling the Treaty of Versailles system, which, in Lenin&#x27;s words, was the treaty of the &quot;triumphant world imperialism&quot;. Lenin made remarks to that effect during the 9th Conference of the Russian Communist Party RKP(b), convened on 22–25 September 1920. He repeatedly referred to the Soviet military defeat, for which he indirectly held himself largely responsible. Trotsky and Stalin blamed each other for the war&#x27;s outcome. Stalin sharply rebutted Lenin&#x27;s accusations regarding Stalin&#x27;s judgement ahead of the Battle of Warsaw. As Lenin saw it, the conquest of Warsaw, not very important in itself, would have allowed the Soviets to demolish the Versailles European order.

==== Before the battle ====
According to the plan of the commander-in-chief of the Red Army Kamenev as of 20 July 1920, two Soviet fronts, Western and Southwestern, were going to execute a concentric attack on Warsaw. However, after consulting Tukhachevsky, the Western Front commander, Kamenev concluded that the Western Front alone could manage the occupation of Warsaw.
Tukhachevsky&#x27;s intention was to destroy the Polish armies in the region of Warsaw. His plan was to have one of his armies attack the Polish capital from the east, while three other were to force their way across the Vistula further north, between Modlin and Toruń. Parts of this formation were going to be used to outflank Warsaw from the west. He issued orders to this effect on 8 August. It had soon become apparent to Tukhachevsky that his designs were not producing the desired result.

The Southwestern Front was given the task of attacking Lwów. Accordingly (and in agreement with his own previously expressed views) Stalin, member of the Revolutionary Council of the Southwestern Front, directed Budyonny to unleash an assault on Lwów, aimed at taking the city (Budyonny&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Army and other Southwestern Front forces were originally supposed to head north in the direction of Brest, to execute, together with Tukhachevsky&#x27;s armies, an assault on Warsaw). Budyonny&#x27;s forces fought in the vicinity of Lwów until In the meantime, already on 11 August, Kamenev ordered the 1st Cavalry Army and the 12th Army of the Southwestern Front to proceed in the northwestern direction toward the Western Front area to fight there under Tukhachevsky&#x27;s command. Kamenev repeated his order on 13 August, but Budyonny, following Stalin&#x27;s directives, refused to obey. On 13 August, Tukhachevsky in vain pleaded with Kamenev to expedite the redirecting of both Southwestern armies to his area of combat. Such circumstances led to a Soviet disadvantage as the crucial Battle of Warsaw was about to unfold.

Trotsky interpreted Stalin&#x27;s actions as insubordination, but the historian Richard Pipes asserts that Stalin &quot;almost certainly acted on Lenin&#x27;s orders&quot; in not moving the forces toward Warsaw. According to Stalin&#x27;s biographer Duraczyński, Stalin, despite his devotion to Lenin, displayed a great deal of initiative and boldness. Unlike other Soviet officials, including Lenin, he had not become euphoric about the Soviet victories. However, he insisted on the exceptional importance of the activities of the Southwestern Front, which turned out to be costly for the Soviets.

Stalin may have been motivated by the letter Lenin wrote to him on 23 July. Regarding the defeat of the Polish armies as already practically accomplished, the Soviet leader suggested a redirection of main Soviet efforts toward the south-west, into Romania, Hungary, Austria, and ultimately Italy. Stalin agreed and he saw the conquest of Lwów on the way as fitting well with the overall scheme.

Tukhachevsky later blamed Stalin for his defeat at the Battle of Warsaw.

Piłsudski had his counteroffensive plan figured by 6 August. He resolved to reinforce the Warsaw and Modlin region, tie-up the Soviet assault forces there, and then use the divisions taken from the front and others in a risky maneuver of attacking the rear of Tukhachevsky&#x27;s forces from the Wieprz River area. The Soviets found a copy of Piłsudski&#x27;s order, but Tukhachevsky thought it to be a hoax. In the final parade Piłsudski received before the attack, about half of his worn out and undersupplied soldiers marched barefoot.

==== Battle of Warsaw ====


In August 1919, Polish military intelligence first decrypted the Red Army&#x27;s radio messages. From the spring of 1920, the Polish high command had been aware of current Soviet moves and plans, which may have had decisively influenced the outcome of the war.

On 8 August 1920, Tukhachevsky ordered some of the Soviet forces to cross the Vistula River in the area of Toruń and Płock. The 4th Army and the formations under Hayk Bzhishkyan&#x27;s command were supposed to take Warsaw from the west, while the main attack came from the east. On 19 August, after intense fighting, the Soviets were repelled from Płock and Włocławek. Bzhishkyan&#x27;s corps came close to crossing the Vistula, but ended up retreating toward East Prussia. Of the four Soviet armies attacking from the east, none had been able to force its way across the river.

On 10 August, Polish Chief of staff Tadeusz Rozwadowski, who co-authored the offensive concept, ordered a two-pronged attack, from the Wkra and the Wieprz Rivers.

Piłsudski, still harshly criticized, submitted a letter of resignation as commander-in-chief to Prime Minister Witos on 12 August. Witos refused to consider the resignation and kept the matter to himself.

On 12 August, Tukhachevsky&#x27;s 16th and 3rd Armies commenced their assault on Warsaw from the east. The Polish 1st Army under General Franciszek Latinik retreated at first, but having received reinforcements stopped the enemy at the Battle of Radzymin and on 15 August initiated offensive actions of its own. The pitched Battle of Ossów, fought on 13–14 August at a nearby location, became the first clear Polish victory in the Warsaw area.

The Polish 5th Army, under General Władysław Sikorski, counterattacked on 14 August from the area of the Modlin Fortress and crossed the Wkra River. It faced the combined forces of the Soviet 3rd and 15th Armies, which were numerically and materially superior. The attack split the Soviet front into two parts. The Soviet advance toward Warsaw and Modlin was halted and had soon turned into a retreat, which contributed to the success of the drive by the main Polish formation coming from the Wieprz River area under Piłsudski&#x27;s command.

By 16 August, the Polish counteroffensive had been joined by Piłsudski&#x27;s group coming from the Wieprz, south-east of Warsaw. The weak Mozyr Group, which was supposed to protect the link between the Soviet fronts, was destroyed. The Poles continued their northward offensive and reached the rear of Tukhachevsky&#x27;s forces. The Soviet armies were unable to communicate; Tukhachevsky and Kamenev became disoriented and issued orders not relevant to the situation. A rapid pursuit of the Russians followed and continued to the East Prussian border and to the Neman River. Of the four armies of the Western Front, two disintegrated; the 4th Army with a cavalry corps crossed into East Prussia, where they were interned.

Tukhachevsky, at his headquarters in Minsk, on 18 August belatedly ordered the remnants of his forces to regroup. He hoped to straighten the front line, halt the Polish attack and regain the initiative, but it was too late and on 19 August he directed his armies to retreat over the entire front.

In order to reorganize the Polish forces ahead of new operations, the chase after the retreating Russians was stopped on 25 August. A large portion of the defeated Soviet troops had been taken prisoner (over 50,000) or interned in Prussia (45,000). Twelve of the twenty two Soviet divisions survived. Rydz-Śmigły&#x27;s formations manned the new frontline, which ran from Brest to Grodno. The victory allowed the Poles to regain the initiative and undertake further military offensive.

The outcome of the struggle for the Polish capital saddened the leadership in Moscow, as well as communists and their sympathizers all over the world. Clara Zetkin spoke of the flower of revolution having been frozen.

To diminish Piłsudski&#x27;s military achievement and his role in the saving of Warsaw, at the instigation of his Polish detractors, the Battle of Warsaw had been referred to as the &quot;Miracle on the Vistula&quot;, and the phrase has since remained in Catholic and popular use in Poland. The &quot;miracle&quot; was attributed to the Virgin Mary.

According to Piłsudski and his people, on the other hand, the miracle was performed solely by the marshal. After the May Coup of 1926, the possibly indispensable contributions of Sikorski or Rozwadowski would never be mentioned in school textbooks or official accounts. The myth of the great marshal was propagated and became dominant through the Sanation politics of remembrance. In the West, it was mostly Maxime Weygand who had been assigned a &quot;veni, vidi, vici&quot; kind of role, even though Weygand himself had honestly denied having such an impact.

==== Conclusion of military campaigns ====
The progress of the Soviet forces on the southern front in Ukraine was slower than in the north. The losses suffered by Budyonny&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Army at the Battle of Brody and Berestechko delayed its advance on Lwów. On 16 August, the army got going and soon reported being 15 km from the center of the city.

On 17 August, at the Battle of Zadwórze, a Polish battalion sacrificed itself to stop Budyonny. On 20 August, Budyonny&#x27;s cavalry belatedly terminated its attacks in the Lwów area in order to come to the aid of Soviet forces retreating from Warsaw. 1st Army units moved on Zamość on 29 August but the . On 31 August, the much reduced 1st Cavalry Army was defeated by Polish cavalry under Colonel Juliusz Rómmel at the Battle of Komarów near Hrubieszów. It was the largest battle of Polish cavalry since 1831. The remains of Budyonny&#x27;s army retreated towards Volodymyr on and on 29 September were withdrawn from the Polish front.

Heading east into Volhynia, the Polish 3rd Army under Sikorski crossed the Bug River and on 13 September took Kovel. The Polish 6th Army under Haller, together with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army, launched their offensive from eastern Galicia. By the end of September, the front reached the Pinsk–Sarny–Khmelnytskyi–Yampil line. In October, Juliusz Rómmel&#x27;s cavalry corps arrived at Korosten, Ukraine.

The immediate Soviet threat having been repelled, the Council of National Defense voted to continue the Polish offensive. By 15 September, forces were assembled for the &quot;Niemen operation&quot;. At that time, the Polish armies had an advantage over the Soviet Western Front in manpower (209,000 to 145,000 soldiers) and armaments.

From 26 August Tukhachevsky established a new frontline, running from the Polish–Lithuanian border area in the north to Polesia, centered on the Neman and Svislach Rivers line. The Soviet commander utilized a three-week lull in the fighting to reorganize and reinforce his battered forces, expected to be ready to attack by the end of September. The Poles struck already on 20 September and soon became engaged in the Battle of the Niemen River, the second greatest battle of the campaign. After heavy fighting, they secured Grodno on Rydz-Śmigły led from there an outflanking maneuver, as a result of which Lida was taken and the Red Army&#x27;s rear destabilized. Polish frontal attacks followed, the Soviet units disintegrated and rapidly retreated. After the battle, the Soviet forces lost the ability to effectively resist and the Poles unleashed a continuous pursuit. The Polish units reached the Daugava River and in mid-October entered Minsk.

In the south, Petliura&#x27;s Ukrainian forces defeated the Bolshevik 14th Army and took control of the left bank of the Zbruch River on 18 September. In October, they moved east to the Yaruha–Sharhorod–Bar–Lityn line. They now numbered 23,000 soldiers and controlled territories immediately to the east of the Polish-controlled areas. They had planned an offensive in Ukraine for 11 November but were attacked by the Bolsheviks on 10 November. By 21 November, after several battles, they were driven into Polish-controlled territory.

From the order &quot;At the end of the war&quot; issued on 18 October 1920 by Józef Pilsudski:

==Peace negotiations==


Peace negotiations commenced in Minsk in mid-August 1920. Initially, the Soviets made harsh demands on the Polish side; their implementation would turn Poland into a Soviet-dependent state. After the Battle of Warsaw defeat, Adolph Joffe became chief Soviet negotiator and the original Soviet conditions for an armistice were withdrawn. The negotiations were moved to Riga on 21 September. As winter approached and there had not been a military resolution to the conflict (the Red Army, despite many defeats, had not been destroyed), both sides decided to stop fighting. The Polish Council of National Defense ruled, against the insistence of Piłsudski and his supporters, that Poland could not afford to continue fighting the war. &quot;Poland must conclude a peace even without guarantees of its durability&quot; – declared Foreign Minister Eustachy Sapieha. Limited continuation of the current offensive was allowed (until the armistice) to improve Poland&#x27;s bargaining position. The Soviets, in addition to their battlefield losses, were pressured by events that necessitated the use of their military elsewhere, such as developments in the Turkish–Armenian War, Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s White Army still occupying the Crimea, or peasant rebellions in Russia.

The Preliminary Treaty of Peace and Armistice Conditions was signed on 12 October and the armistice went into effect on 18 October. Ratifications were exchanged at Liepāja on 2 November. The peace treaty negotiations ensued and were concluded, between Poland on one side and Soviet Ukraine, Soviet Russia and Soviet Belarus on the other, on 18 March 1921. The Peace of Riga, signed on that day, determined the Polish–Soviet border and divided the disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between Poland and the Soviet Union (soon to be officially established). The treaty also regulated various other aspects of Polish–Soviet relations. It complemented the Treaty of Versailles and laid foundations for the relatively peaceful coexistence in Eastern Europe that lasted less than two decades.

The armistice preliminary stipulations required foreign allied forces to leave Poland. Signing the treaty with the Soviet republics, Poland had to rescind its recognition of Petliura&#x27;s Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic and other Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian &quot;White&quot; governments and organizations; the allied military units of the three nationalities present in Poland were disbanded. The Ukrainian People&#x27;s Army crossed the armistice line and fought the Red Army for a month. Its remnants returned into the Polish territory, where they were interned.

The Peace of Riga was approved by the All-Russian Central Executive Committee on 14 April 1921, by the Polish Sejm on 15 April, and by the Central Executive Committee of Soviet Ukraine on 17 April. Until late summer 1939, the Soviet Union refrained from officially questioning the Riga treaty settlement, but it had been understood that the Soviet policy objective was to have it overturned.

During the Polish–Soviet War, about 100,000 people were killed. A complicated problem of prisoners of war was left to be resolved. On both sides, great destruction and economic losses, as well as deep psychological trauma resulted. Piłsudski&#x27;s goal of separating Ukraine from Russia was not accomplished and the compromise Polish–Soviet border attained indicated future instability.

=== Russia ===
Thousands of peasant disturbances and rebellions took place in Russia between 1917 and 1921. The Pitchfork uprising of February–March 1920 greatly distracted the Soviet leadership and negatively affected their military preparedness in Ukraine and Belarus before the Polish Kiev offensive. Lenin considered the peasant resistance to grain requisitions and other privations of war communism more threatening to Soviet Russia than the White movement. The last and possibly the greatest of peasant uprisings was the Tambov Rebellion of 1920–1921. Acute food shortages reached also Moscow and Saint Petersburg and contributed to the outbreak of the Kronstadt rebellion in March 1921.

Soviet Russia was unable to accomplish many of the political objectives of its war with Poland. Despite the support of Weimar Germany, it could not destroy the Versailles-imposed European system and the two powers had to wait for another opportunity to redress their grievances.

The Polish delegation at the Riga peace talks, led by Jan Dąbski, concentrated on an armistice line and the future border. For the Soviets, these were secondary concerns. The statehood status of the Ukrainian and Belarusian Soviet republics was of utmost importance and their recognition was the most fateful concession the Polish negotiators had made.

The Anglo-Soviet Trade Agreement, signed on 16 March 1921, was the first of a series of such international treaties. It broke diplomatic isolation of Soviet Russia. The resulting influx of foreign arms and equipment contributed to the success of the offensive against the partisans in the Tambov province, executed by Tukhachevsky and completed by July.

The grain requisition practices were eventually replaced by the New Economic Policy, announced by Lenin on 23 March 1921. It represented a partial compromise with capitalism.

On 16 April 1922, Russia and Germany signed the Treaty of Rapallo. Diplomatic relations were established and the Russian negotiators obtained favorable resolution of their financial concerns.

After the Peace of Riga, Soviet Russia withdrew behind its &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;. Its leaders abandoned in reality the cause of the international revolution. The result was the Stalinist &quot;socialism in one country&quot; pursuit. The Soviet Union entered a period of intensive industrialization, to eventually become the second greatest industrial power in the world.

=== Poland ===
Their losses during and after the Battle of Warsaw made the Soviets offer the Polish peace delegation substantial territorial concessions, including Minsk and other areas occupied by Polish forces. Polish resources were also exhausted and Polish public opinion wanted a settlement. Piłsudski and his camp were opposed to the peace process and wanted the warfare to continue to make a realization of the &quot;Intermarium&quot; concept possible. Fulfilment of Piłsudski&#x27;s territorial and political ideas was precluded already on 11 September 1920, when the Defense Council voted on Poland&#x27;s border expectations. Despite the positive outcome of the Battle of Warsaw, Piłsudski&#x27;s political position remained weak and he was unable to prevent developments that meant ruin to his long-held vision of a grand Polish-led alliance.

The negotiations were controlled by Dmowski&#x27;s National Democrats. The National Democrats wanted to directly incorporate into the Polish state the lands they found desirable. The Sejm was controlled by Dmowski&#x27;s allies, whose ideas on the nature of the Polish state and the arrangement of its borders had since permanently prevailed.

Because of the failed Kiev Expedition, Piłsudski had lost his ability to act as the main player, to manipulate people and events in Polish politics. The consensus on his dominant role was gone. As a consequence, he was allowed to win the war, but the conditions of peace were determined already by his opponents.
The National Democrats, led at the Riga talks by Stanisław Grabski, wanted only the territory they viewed as &quot;ethnically or historically Polish&quot; (had Polish-dominated cities) or, in their opinion, could be Polonised. In the east, Polish culture was weakly represented even in the cities, except for a few in the western part of the disputed territories, and Grabski refrained from seeking a border along the so-called Dmowski&#x27;s Line, previously promoted by his movement. Despite the Red Army&#x27;s defeat and the willingness of the chief Soviet negotiator, Adolph Joffe, to concede most of the areas occupied by Polish troops, the National Democratic politics allowed the Soviets to regain some of the territories acquired by the Polish armies during the campaign. The National Democrats worried that Poland would not be able to control overly extended territories, dominated by national minorities; Grabski wanted lands where Poles could predominate. Among the territories evacuated by the Polish Army were Minsk in the north and Kamianets-Podilskyi and other areas east of the Zbruch River in the south. The &quot;Grabski Corridor&quot;, a strip of land inserted to separate Lithuania from Russia and connect Poland to Latvia, made Piłsudski&#x27;s so-called Żeligowski&#x27;s Mutiny and the Polish annexation of the Vilnius area possible. The National Democrats were also conscious of the weakening of their electoral position that would result from annexing more territories dominated by non-Polish ethnic groups. The failed federalist orientation was represented at Riga by Piłsudski&#x27;s associate, Leon Wasilewski.

In the long run, the National Democrats&#x27; scheme had not quite worked, because &quot;the Riga settlement created a Poland which was too westerly to be a federation, but not westerly enough to remain a national state&quot;. Poland ended up with the largest total percentage of ethnic minorities of any unitary state in interwar Europe (only about two thirds of Polish citizens considered themselves ethnically Polish or of Polish nationality). Still, the refusal of the easternmost areas considered was beneficial to the National Democrats&#x27; electoral prospects. The resolution of the war had thus dealt a death blow to the &quot;Intermarium&quot; project. One consequence of the outcome of the Polish–Soviet War was that Poland&#x27;s elites acquired an exaggerated perspective of the country&#x27;s military capabilities. This point of view was not shared by Western observers, who stressed that Poland was able to defend itself only because of the financial, logistic and material support from the Allies. 99,000 Polish soldiers died or went missing and the country suffered enormous other losses and destruction.

=== Ukraine ===
The Peace of Riga partitioned Ukraine and gave a portion of its territory to Poland (eastern Galicia and most of Volhynia) and the other portion to the Soviets. The Ukrainian Soviet Republic and the Byelorussian Soviet Republic were recognized by Poland. Historian Timothy Snyder writes: &quot;That the Soviet Union established in 1922 included a Ukrainian SSR was the most important consequence of the attempts to establish an independent Ukrainian state in 1918–1920.&quot;

The Treaty of Warsaw between Poland and the Directorate of Ukraine had been invalidated. The Riga treaty violated the spirit of Poland&#x27;s prior alliance with the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic. From the beginning of the talks, the Polish side &quot;de facto&quot; recognized the Ukrainian SSR and the armistice agreement stipulated termination of support for foreign forces allied against the other side. Members of the Ukrainian faction that accepted the alliance with Poland and fought within that alliance were now interned by the Polish authorities. The peace negotiations and their outcome were condemned and bitterly criticized by Ukrainian politicians and military leaders. As Polish democracy was &quot;alien, unrepresentative, and eventually curtailed&quot;, great resentment had been generated in the remaining interwar years because of repressive policies of Polish governments towards Ukrainians living in 

In the 1920s, the Soviet policy was to help create a modern Ukrainian culture. Ukrainian intellectuals, co-opted by the communist party, were encouraged to create in the Ukrainian language and the result was cultural revival and a period of great productivity. Children were educated and most books and newspapers were published in the native language. The Ukrainian Autocephalous Orthodox Church was established. The liberal policies ended under Stalin&#x27;s rule, when the new church was banned and the Ukrainian intelligentsia destroyed in massive purges.

Given the circumstances, in the 1930s Poland&#x27;s eastern Galicia had become the center of Ukrainian political and cultural activity. Despite the atrocities that took place in Soviet Ukraine, Poland was regarded by Ukrainian activists as the principal enemy. They felt disappointed by the failed alliance and the Peace of Riga and were annoyed by daily domination of the Polish authorities and local Polish elites. Many perceived the Soviet Union primarily as the creator of a Ukrainian state, the Ukrainian SSR.

=== Belarus ===
On 11 July 1920, Soviet forces entered Minsk and on 1 August the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic was officially established. Belarus, like Ukraine, was partitioned between Poland and the Soviet Union after the Peace of Riga. The policies of the Byelorussian Soviet Republic were determined by Moscow.

Unlike in the cases of Lithuania and Ukraine, Piłsudski or his allies had not proposed a Belarusian state associated with Poland until the Riga talks, when they wanted to claim Minsk as capital of a Belarusian People&#x27;s Republic in that role.

Like the Ukrainian Petliura&#x27;s forces, in Belarus the Volunteer Allied Army under General Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz attacked the Soviets after the armistice. Bułak-Bałachowicz&#x27;s troops commenced their offensive on 5 November and after temporary successes had to retreat back into Polish-controlled territory on 28 November. The Belarusian soldiers were also interned by the Polish authorities.

Belarusian activists regarded the Peace of Riga results as a tragic betrayal. Without Minsk, Polish Belarusians were reduced to being a mostly rural, marginalized group. To many of them, the Soviet republic to the east seemed an attractive alternative. In 1922, the Soviet Union was established as a formal federation of republics. Its policy called for an eventual extension of the Byelorussian SSR, to include the Belarusian lands under Polish administration. The Communist Party of Western Belorussia, established in Poland, was under Soviet control. The territory of the Byelorussian SSR was extended to the east in 1923, 1924 and 1926 by lands taken from the Russian Republic. In contrast to the repressive Polish policies, in the 1920s the Soviet Union supported Belarusian culture; several major national institutions and thousands of Belarusian schools had been established. However, the official Belarusian progress was mostly destroyed under Stalin in the 1930s.

Belarusian activists held a Congress of Representatives in Prague in the fall of 1921, to discuss the Peace of Riga and its consequences for Belarus. Vera Maslovskaya was sent there as the delegate of the Białystok area, and she proposed a resolution to fight for the unification of Belarus. She sought independence of all Belarusian lands and denounced the partition. Though the convention did not adopt a proposal instituting armed conflict, it passed Maslovskaya&#x27;s proposal, which led to immediate retaliation from the Polish authorities. They infiltrated the underground network fighting for Belarusian unification and arrested the participants. Maslovskaya was arrested in 1922 and tried in 1923, along with 45 other participants, mostly peasants. Among the arrested were also a sister and brother of Maslovskaya and several teachers and professionals. Maslovskaya accepted all responsibility for the underground organisation, but specifically stated that she was guilty of no crime, having acted only to protect the interests of Belarus against foreign occupiers, in a political and not military action. Unable to prove that the leaders had participated in armed rebellion, the court found them guilty of political crimes and sentenced to six years in prison.

=== Lithuania ===
Pressured by the Entente powers, Poland and Lithuania signed the Suwałki Agreement on 7 October 1920; the armistice line left Vilnius on the Lithuanian side of the border. However, Polish military activities, especially the so-called Żeligowski&#x27;s Mutiny launched two days after the Suwałki Agreement, allowed Poland to capture the Vilnius Region, where a Polish-dominated Governance Committee of Central Lithuania was formed. On 8 January 1922, the Polish military enforced local legislative elections, but they were boycotted by Jews, Belarusians and Lithuanians. The resulting Vilnius assembly voted for the incorporation of &quot;Central Lithuania&quot; into Poland on 20 February 1922 and Polish Sejm approved the annexation on 24 March. The Western powers condemned the Polish actions but on 15 March 1923 the Conference of Ambassadors, convinced of the desirability of geographical separation of Lithuania from the Soviet Union, approved Poland&#x27;s eastern borders, as already determined by the League of Nations in early February (the Soviet Union rejected the granting of Vilnius to Poland). Lithuania refused to comply; the events and the incorporation worsened Polish–Lithuanian relations for decades to come. According to Alfred E. Senn, even though Lithuania lost territory to Poland, it was only the Polish victory against the Soviets in the Polish–Soviet War that derailed the Soviet plans for westward expansion and gave Lithuania the period of interwar independence.

=== Latvia ===
Latvia&#x27;s fighting with the Bolsheviks ended with the Latvian–Soviet Peace Treaty on 11 August 1920. The Peace of Riga negotiations followed; it established a Polish-Latvian border in the area of Daugavpils. That same year Latvia passed a comprehensive land reform and in 1922 introduced a democratic constitution. The Warsaw Accord was signed by foreign ministers of Latvia, Estonia, Finland and Poland on 17 March 1922. However, the Treaty of Rapallo, signed on 16 April 1922, effectively placed the Baltic states in the German and Soviet spheres of influence.

== Prisoners, war crimes and other controversies ==
According to sources quoted by Chwalba, of the 80–85 thousand Soviet prisoners of war, 16–20 thousand died in Polish captivity. Of the 51 thousand Polish prisoners, 20 thousand died. The practice of disproportionate killing of Polish commissioned officers continued into World War II, when a series of executions known as the Katyn massacre took place.

The war and its aftermath resulted in controversies, such as the situation of prisoners of war in Poland and in Soviet Russia and Lithuania, treatment of the civilian population, or the behaviour of some commanders, including Semyon Budyonny, Hayk Bzhishkyan, Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz, and Vadim Yakovlev. The reported pogroms of Jews by the Polish military caused the United States to send a commission, led by Henry Morgenthau, to investigate the matter.

== Development of a military strategy ==
The Polish–Soviet War influenced the Polish military doctrine; under Piłsudski&#x27;s leadership, it emphasized the mobility of elite cavalry units. It also influenced Charles de Gaulle, who was an instructor in the Polish Army with a rank of major and fought in several of the battles, including the Battle of Warsaw. He and Sikorski correctly predicted, based on their experiences during the war, the importance of maneuver and mechanization in the next war. Although they had failed to convince their respective military establishments to heed those lessons during the interwar period, during World War II, they rose to the command of their respective armed forces in exile.

== Aftermath and legacy ==
Despite the final retreat of Soviet forces and the annihilation of three Soviet field armies, historians do not universally agree on the question of victory. Lenin spoke of a great military defeat suffered by Soviet Russia. Sebestyen wrote: &quot;The Poles heavily defeated and embarrassed the Soviet state – one of Lenin&#x27;s biggest setbacks.&quot; The conflict, however, is also viewed as military victory for Poland coupled with political defeat. In the Peace of Riga, Poland formally gave up its ambitions of helping build independent Ukraine and Belarus. Western Ukraine and western Belarus became parts of Poland, which recognized the two countries (geographically, their central and eastern parts) as states and dependencies of Moscow. The countries envisioned by Piłsudski as members of Poland-led &quot;Intermarium&quot; federation had instead, under Lenin and Stalin, become incorporated into the Soviet Union.

In the autumn of 1920, both combatants had realized that they could not win a decisive military victory. Internally, the newly reestablished Polish state had proved its viability, as an overwhelming majority of its people contributed to the defense of the country and turned out insensitive to Bolshevik appeals for joining the revolution. As for the main protagonists, neither one was able to accomplish his principal objective. For Piłsudski, it was to recreate in some form the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. For Lenin, to cause the downfall of capitalist edifice in Europe by facilitating revolutionary processes in key states of the Western Europe.

Russian and Polish historians tend to assign victory to their respective countries. Outside assessments vary mostly between calling the result a Polish victory or inconclusive. The Poles claimed a successful defence of their state, but the Soviets claimed a repulse of the Polish invasion of Ukraine and Belarus, which they viewed as a part of the Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War. Some British and American military historians argue that the Soviet failure to destroy the Polish Army ended Soviet ambitions for international revolution.

Andrzej Chwalba lists a number of ways in which the Polish military victory in reality turned out being a loss (the fundamental &quot;status quo&quot; – Poland&#x27;s sovereign existence – had been preserved). The perception of Poland as the aggressor damaged the country&#x27;s reputation. Historians and publicists, in the West as well as in the East, have presented the country&#x27;s eastern policy in negative terms, as irresponsible and adventurous. In 1920 and its aftermath, likely hundreds of thousands of people died without any territorial or political gain for Poland.

After signing the armistice with Poland in October 1920, the Soviets transferred troops toward Crimea and attacked the Isthmus of Perekop. Pyotr Wrangel&#x27;s White Army was ultimately defeated there. By 14 November, 83,000 soldiers and civilians had been evacuated aboard French and Russian ships to Istanbul (the British government refused to provide any assistance), while 300,000 White collaborators were left behind. The Red Army then diverted its troops into the Tambov region of central Russia to crush an anti-Bolshevik peasant uprising.

In September 1926, the Soviet–Lithuanian Non-Aggression Pact was signed. The Soviets renewed their recognition of the Lithuanian claim to the Vilnius area. In 1939, after the Soviet invasion of Poland, Stalin gave Vilnius to Lithuania. In 1940, Lithuania was incorporated into the Soviet Union as a Soviet republic. This arrangement, interrupted by the German occupation of Lithuania in 1941–44, had lasted until the restoration of Lithuanian independent state in 1990. Under the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic, Vilnius became a city dominated by ethnic Lithuanians.

After the Soviet invasion of Poland of September 1939, the partition of Belarus and Ukraine ended on Soviet terms. After Operation Barbarossa and occupation by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union returned in 1944 and the two Soviet republics permanently reclaimed what had been Polish &quot;Kresy&quot; from 1920 to 1939. Since the post-World War II adjustments, the borders of the republics had remained stable, except for the 1954 transfer of Crimea from the Russian SFSR to the Ukrainian SSR. The Soviet republics&#x27; borders had been preserved as borders of independent Belarus and Ukraine following the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

In 1943, during the course of World War II, the subject of Poland&#x27;s eastern borders was reopened and was discussed at the Tehran Conference. Winston Churchill argued in favour of the 1920 Curzon Line rather than the Peace of Riga borders, and an agreement among the Allies to that effect was reached at the Yalta Conference in 1945. The Western Allies, despite having alliance treaties with Poland and despite the Polish contribution to the war, left Poland within the Soviet sphere of influence. The Allies allowed Poland to be compensated for the territorial losses in the east with the bulk of the former eastern territories of Germany. The post-war arrangement imposed had become known to many Poles as the Western betrayal.

From the end of World War II until 1989, the communists held power in Poland, and the Polish–Soviet War was omitted or minimised in Polish and other Soviet Bloc countries&#x27; history books, or was presented as a foreign intervention during the Russian Civil War.

Polish Lieutenant Józef Kowalski was the last living veteran of the war. He was awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta on his 110th birthday by President Lech Kaczyński of Poland. He died on 7 December 2013 aged 113.

<text>The Dionne quintuplets (; born May 28, 1934) are the first quintuplets known to have survived their infancy. The identical girls were born just outside Callander, Ontario, near the village of Corbeil. All five survived to adulthood.

The Dionne girls were born premature. After four months with their family, custody was signed over to the Red Cross, which paid for their care and oversaw the building of a hospital for the sisters. Less than a year after this agreement was signed, the Ontario government stepped in and passed the &quot;Dionne Quintuplets&#x27; Guardianship Act, 1935&quot;, which made them wards of the Crown until the age of 18. The Ontario provincial government and those around them began to profit by making them a significant tourist attraction.

The identical quintuplet girls were, in order of birth:
# Yvonne Édouilda Marie Dionne (died 2001)
# Annette Lillianne Marie Allard (living)
# Cécile Marie Émilda Langlois (living)
# Émilie Marie Jeanne Dionne (died 1954)
# Marie Reine Alma Houle (died 1970)

==Family==
The Dionne family was headed by father Oliva-Édouard (1904–1979) and mother Elzire Dionne (; 1909–1986), who married on September 15, 1925. They lived just outside Corbeil, in a farmhouse in unregistered territory. The Dionnes were a French-speaking farming family with five older children: Ernest (1926–1995), Rose Marie (1928–1995), Thérèse (1929–2021), Daniel (1932–1995), and Pauline (1933–2018), who was only eleven months older than the quintuplets. A sixth child, Léo (1930–1930), died of pneumonia shortly after birth.

The Dionnes also had three sons after the quintuplets: Oliva Jr. (1936–2017), Victor (1938–2007), and Claude (1946–2009).

==Birth==
Elzire was 24 when she gave birth to the quintuplets. She suspected she was carrying twins, but no one was aware that quintuplets were even possible. The quintuplets were born prematurely. In 1938, the doctors had a theory that was later proven correct when genetic tests showed that the girls were identical, meaning they were created from a single egg cell. Elzire reported having cramps in her third month and passing a strange object which may have been a sixth fetus.

Dr. Allan Roy Dafoe is credited with ensuring the successful live birth of the quintuplets. Organised pre-natal care was not practiced at that place and time so based upon his observations, he thought Elzire&#x27;s baby may have a &quot;fetal abnormality&quot;. Throughout her pregnancy she suffered from fluid retention and anaemia. Dafoe delivered the babies with the help of two midwives, Aunt Donalda and Madame Benoît Lebel, who were summoned by Oliva Dionne in the middle of the night.

Émilie and Marie shared an amniotic sac, as did Annette and Yvonne. Based on reports from Elzire, it is suspected that Cécile shared an amniotic sac with a sixth fetus: at approx. 12 weeks she passed what seemed a miscarried fetus. All but Émilie were later discovered to be right-handed and all but Marie had a counterclockwise whorl in their hair.

The quintuplets&#x27; total weight at birth was . The highest weight was and the lowest weight was . Their individual weights and measurements were not recorded. The quintuplets were immediately wrapped in cotton sheets and old napkins, and laid in the corner of the bed. Elzire went into shock, but she recovered in two hours.

The babies were kept in a wicker basket borrowed from the neighbours, covered with heated blankets. They were taken into the kitchen and set by the open door of the stove to keep warm. One by one, they were taken out of the basket and massaged with olive oil. Every two hours for the first twenty-four, they were fed water sweetened with corn syrup. By the second day they were moved to a slightly larger laundry basket and kept warm with hot-water bottles. They were watched constantly and often had to be roused. They were then fed with &quot;seven-twenty&quot; formula: cow&#x27;s milk, boiled water, two spoonfuls of corn syrup, and one or two drops of rum for a stimulant.

News of the unusual birth spread quickly, sparked by Oliva&#x27;s brother&#x27;s inquiry to the local newspaper editor about how much he would charge for an announcement of five babies at a single birth. Before long, people from all over North America were offering assistance. Individuals sent supplies and well-meant advice. A famous letter from Appalachia recommended tiny doses of burnt rye whisky to prevent diarrhea. Charlie Blake, a reporter from the &quot;Chicago American&quot; newspaper found an old incubator from 1895 that did not run on electricity, which was important because the Dionne home did not have electricity, and brought it to the Dionne home.

A second incubator was brought by the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; newspaper, who had three more built from antique blueprints. Assistance was offered by women who donated their breast milk to the quintuplets. The women were compensated for their donations, receiving ten cents per ounce of milk donated. This allowed women to help with household income during the Great Depression. Once the milk was received, it was preserved and sent by train to the quintuplets. Dr. Alan Brown of Toronto&#x27;s Hospital for Sick Children ensured that a train with twenty-eight ounces of breast milk was delivered to the quintuplets each morning.

==Removal from family==
Oliva Dionne was approached by fair exhibitors for Chicago&#x27;s Century of Progress exhibition within days of the girls&#x27; birth, seeking to put the quintuplets on display and show them to the world. At the time it was not unusual for so-called &quot;incubator babies&quot; to be displayed at fairs and other exhibitions. The parents were persuaded to agree on the advice of the doctor present at the birth, Dr. Dafoe, and the family priest, Father Daniel Routhier.

Oliva Dionne revoked the contract only days later, citing that it was invalid because his wife, Elzire Dionne, did not sign it. The Tour Bureau claimed otherwise. On approximately July 27, 1934, the first guardianship bill was signed. Oliva and Elzire Dionne signed custody of the quintuplets over to the Red Cross for a period of two years to protect them from this contract and in return the Red Cross would cover all medical costs. This included the nurses&#x27; wages, supplies, and ensuring that enough breast milk was shipped to the hospital. They oversaw the building of a hospital built specifically for the Dionne quintuplets. In February 1935 the Dionnes travelled to Chicago as &quot;Parents of the World Famous Babies&quot;, and made stage appearances.

The Premier of Ontario at the time, Mitchell Hepburn, used the Dionne vaudeville trip as an excuse to extend the guardianship. He claimed that they must save the babies from further exploitation and, in March 1935, pushed the &quot;Dionne Quintuplets Act&quot; through government, that officially made the girls wards of the Crown and extended guardianship to the age of eighteen. Oliva Dionne had a seat on the Board of Guardians but he rarely attended meetings, as he felt his vote wouldn&#x27;t matter against the other three guardians: Dr. Dafoe; Joseph Valin, a French-Canadian judge from North Bay; and Minister of Welfare David Croll.

These three guardians met once a month and had full control over business matters involving the quintuplets. They were involved in caring for the girls, managing money, and creating contracts for business opportunities such as appearances in films and commercials. The stated reason for removing the quintuplets from their parents&#x27; legal custody was to ensure their survival and protection from promoters.

The government realized there was enormous public interest in the sisters and proceeded to engender a tourist industry around them. The girls were made wards of the provincial Crown, planned until they reached the age of 18.

==Dafoe Nursery==
Across the road from their birthplaces, the Dafoe Hospital and Nursery was built for the five girls and their new caregivers. The girls were moved from the farmhouse to this nursery on September 21, 1934, and lived there until they were nine years old. The compound had an outdoor playground designed to be a public observation area. It was surrounded by a covered arcade, which allowed tourists to observe the sisters behind one-way screens. The one-way screens were installed to prevent noise and distraction. The facility was funded by a Red Cross fundraiser. The sisters were brought to the playground two or three times a day in front of the crowd. It was a nine-room nursery with a staff house nearby. The staff house held the three nurses and the three police in charge of guarding them, while a housekeeper and two maids lived in the main building with the quintuplets. The buildings were surrounded by a seven-foot (2.13 m) barbed-wire fence.

The Dionne sisters were constantly tested, studied, and examined, with records taken of everything. While living at the compound, they had a somewhat rigid lifestyle. They were not required to participate in chores and were privately tutored in the same building where they lived. Cared for primarily by nurses, they had limited exposure to the world outside the boundaries of the compound except for the daily rounds of tourists, who, from the sisters&#x27; point of view, were generally heard but not seen. They also had occasional contact with their parents and siblings across the road. When their parents were allowed in the nursery, they argued with the nurses. Elzire pushed the nurses and objected to the foods that they were fed.

Every morning they dressed together in a big bathroom, drank orange juice and cod liver oil, then had their hair curled. They then said a prayer, a gong sounded, and they ate breakfast in the dining room. After 30 minutes, they cleared the table. They then played in the sunroom for 30 minutes, took a 15-minute break, and at nine o&#x27;clock had their morning inspection with Dr. Dafoe. Every month, they had a different timetable of activities. They bathed every day before dinner and put on their pyjamas. Dinner was served at precisely six o&#x27;clock. They then went into the quiet playroom to say their evening prayers. Each girl had a color and a symbol to mark whatever belonged to her. Annette&#x27;s color was red and her design a maple leaf, Cécile&#x27;s green and a turkey. Émilie had white and a tulip, Marie blue and a teddy bear, and Yvonne pink and a bluebird.

Until the quintuplets&#x27; birth, Dafoe was a country doctor. He received additional attention when he delivered the quintuplets and was seen as a doctor having much knowledge on child care and health. Until 1942 when Dafoe retired, he was known as the world&#x27;s best doctor. He wrote a book and numerous pamphlets, and had a radio broadcast, all with the intention of helping mothers with infant care. His broadcasts were sponsored by companies and brands such as Lysol wipes, which were seen as effective at preventing infections for newborn babies. Mothers were highly appreciative of Dr. Dafoe&#x27;s advice as they were actively looking for advice from professionals in the health care or child care fields. Eventually Dafoe was viewed as taking advantage of his newly-come fame. He spent much money and was removed as one of the three primary caretakers of the quintuplets. This removal involved Oliva Dionne as he took legal action to regain custody over his children. The general public did not know that Dafoe profited $182,466 in 1943 ().

When visits first started, the visitors watched the quintuplets through a window in the hospital. The hospital quickly realized that this was not good for the quintuplets as they were excited when visitors came and became irritated when they left. Telling visitors not to make loud noises was not enough to prevent them from doing so. They were displayed four times a day. The observatory opened on Canada Day in 1936. Thousands of tourists came to see the sisters and hundreds of cars flooded in. The visitors were told to stay silent and not speak to the girls, continue moving to avoid blockages, if the weather was bad the girls would not be shown, and no photographs were allowed. The girls knew they were watched as they could hear screams and laughter. The one-way screens did not fully block out the visitors, acting more as frosted glass.
Approximately 3,000 people per day visited the observation gallery that surrounded the outdoor playground to view the Dionne sisters. Ample parking was provided and almost 3,000,000 people walked through the gallery between 1936 and 1943. Oliva Dionne ran a souvenir shop and a woollen store opposite the nursery, and the area acquired the name &quot;Quintland&quot;. The souvenirs, picturing the five sisters, included autographs and framed photographs, spoons, cups, plates, plaques, candy bars, books, postcards, and dolls. Available to the public for free in bins were stones from the area that claimed to have the magical power of fertility – the bins would need to be refilled almost every day.

Women without children would touch Elzire Dionne, believing that she could increase their chances of fertility. Midwives Madame LeGros and Madame Lebel worked at five different souvenir shops at different times. The quintuplets brought in more than $50 million in total tourist revenue to Ontario. Quintland became Ontario&#x27;s biggest tourist attraction of the era, surpassing the Canadian side of Niagara Falls. It was only rivalled by Radio City Music Hall, Mount Vernon, and Gettysburg in the United States. Hollywood stars who came to Callander to visit the Quints included Clark Gable, James Stewart, Bette Davis, James Cagney, and Mae West. Amelia Earhart also visited Callander just six weeks before her ill-fated flight in 1937. Only five people could be in a room with the quintuplets at one time. These individuals were sprayed with disinfectant.

The sisters, their likenesses and images, along with Dr. Dafoe, were used to publicize commercial products including Karo corn syrup, Quaker Oats, Lysol, Palmolive soap, Colgate, Aluminum Goods Manufacturing Co., Beehive Corn Syrup, Canada Starch Company, Carnation Milk, Colgate-Palmolive-Peet Co., Corn Products Refining and Crown Brand Corn Syrup, and Baby Ruth. They promoted the sales of condensed milk, toothpaste, disinfectant, candy bars, and many other products.

==Film careers==
The Dionne girls starred in three Hollywood feature films, which were essentially fictionalized versions of their story. They played the &quot;Wyatt quintuplets&quot; in all three films:
* &quot;The Country Doctor&quot; (1936) – directed by Henry King and starring Jean Hersholt as &quot;Dr. John Luke&quot;
* &quot;Reunion&quot; (1936) – directed by Norman Taurog and starring Hersholt
* &quot;Five of a Kind&quot; (1938) – directed by Herbert Leeds and starring Hersholt, as well as Claire Trevor and Cesar Romero as competitive radio journalists

In the first two films, the Dionne quintuplets didn&#x27;t so much act as simply appear. Their scenes were filmed at Quintland in Callander and largely consisted of them playing and interacting with each other, as one would expect of normal 2- and 4-year-old children. Both films concentrated more on telling the (fictionalized) story of the heroic doctor who delivered the Wyatts and took care of them, than it did on the Wyatt quintuplets themselves.

The Dionne quintuplets also appeared in numerous newsreels and a short documentary film called &quot;Five Times Five&quot; in 1939. This film was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Two-reel) in 1940. In 1942, they appeared in one of James A. Fitzpatrick&#x27;s Traveltalks &quot;Land of the Quintuplets&quot; shortly before they were returned to their parents. In 1998, the three surviving sisters, Cécile, Annette and Yvonne, participated in an hour-long documentary, &quot;Full Circle: The Untold Story of the Dionne Quintuplets&quot;, written and directed by Maya Gallus, and broadcast on the CBC documentary series &quot;Life &amp; Times&quot;.

== Trust fund ==
The quintuplets&#x27; trust fund grew rapidly with each newspaper and newsreel that shared their name. In 1934, a photographer from the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;, Fred Davis, signed a contract stating that the $10,000 () the Newspaper Enterprise Association put into the trust fund disallows anyone else from photographing the quintuplets for a year, including their parents. Each newsreel that Pathé News made meant that a deposit between $12,000 to $15,000 was made in the trust fund. The Madame Alexander Doll Company offered the quintuplets five percent of its total sales ($25,000) as many people bought dolls that resembled the quintuplets, especially during Christmas. By their second birthday, their bank account had $250,000.

Although the quintuplets&#x27; trust fund was secured by the Canadian government, they were not rich nor living comfortably. They were making $746 monthly. The money in their trust fund decreased through spending on marriage, houses, child support, and divorce. It was discovered that their trust fund contained less money than what was made from advertisements and photographs of the quintuplets. Instead of the government paying for research, food, and travel expenses for photographers and filmmakers, the payment came from the quintuplets&#x27; trust fund. When the sisters released their book revealing the harsh memories from their childhood, the government was unmoved.

They did not consider the suffering their actions caused and their impact on the quintuplets&#x27; childhoods. The sisters requested $10 million from the Canadian government and received no response. With the help of Cecile&#x27;s son Bertrand, news was released that documents concerning the quintuplets from 1934 to 1937 were burned, resulting in Premier Mike Harris offering $2000 per month to the three living sisters, who believed this offer to be an insult to them and insufficient to pay off the damage that had been done. They just wanted what was stolen from their trust fund. They took their need to media. The sisters turned down offers of 2 and 3 million dollars. They accepted 4 million dollars and an analysis of their trust accounts. Harris visited the sisters and apologized on behalf of the government. The quintuplets had finally put their story in the public&#x27;s eye and challenged the Ontario government.

==Return to family==

By 1939 Dr. Dafoe had resigned as guardian and Oliva Dionne was gaining more support to have his family reunited. The family was reunited because their parents made efforts to regain custody of their children. Also, the Catholic Church and French-speaking communities in both Quebec and Ontario pressured the government to give Oliva Dionne custody. These efforts and pressure stemmed from the fact that the Dionnes had never agreed to the removal of the quintuplets from their custody.

In 1942, the Dionne family moved into the nursery with the quintuplets while they waited for their new home to be completed. In November 1943, the entire Dionne family moved into their new home. The yellow brick, 20-room mansion was paid for out of the quintuplets&#x27; fund. The home had many amenities that were considered luxuries at the time, including telephones, electricity and hot water and was nicknamed &quot;The Big House&quot;. The building is now a retirement home.

The nursery was eventually converted into an accredited school house where the sisters finished their secondary education along with ten Roman Catholic girls from the area who were chosen to attend. In later years, the old Dafoe Hospital was used by the Recluses of Corbeil as a convent.

When they were reunited, many struggles followed. The quintuplets felt distanced from their siblings. They struggled to communicate as they spoke French and their siblings preferred English. Once Oliva received custody, he wanted the attention. He made police accompany his vehicle as he took the quintuplets out, constantly drawing attention to them and himself.

While the parents claimed that they wished to integrate the quintuplets into the family, the sisters frequently travelled to perform at various functions, and still dressed identically. According to the accounts of the surviving sisters, the parents often treated them at home as a five-part unit, and frequently lectured them about the trouble they had caused the family by existing. They claimed physical abuse at the hands of their mother. They were unaware for many years that the lavish house, the expensive food and the series of cars the family enjoyed were paid for with money they themselves had earned, but they were aware of the fact that their upbringing meant they would never feel truly part of the large Dionne family, and called their time in the Big House, &quot;the saddest home we ever knew&quot;.

In particular, Oliva Dionne was resentful and suspicious of outsiders as a result of his having lost custody of the girls. In 1995, the three surviving sisters alleged that their father had sexually abused them during their teenage years. Their father violated them. He bought liniment claiming it would help with Yvonne&#x27;s chest cold. As a 13-year-old she felt pressured to undress in front of her father. Her father rubbed the liniment on her neck, sternum, shoulders, and ribs. Then, he turned to Émilie and told her he needed to apply the liniment on her too. The quintuplets feared going for car drives with their father and felt the need to dress extra conservatively on these drives because of him. Annette wore turtlenecks to prevent her father from violating her. During car rides the girls were squished up front with their father as the back seats were in for repair. He allegedly French kissed them and put his fingers down their blouses.

==Adult years==
The quintuplets left the family home upon turning 18 years old in 1952 and had little contact with their parents afterwards. Three went on to marry and have children: Marie had two daughters, Emilie and Monique; Annette had three sons, Jean-François, Charlie, and Eric; and Cécile had five children, Claude, Patrice, twins Bruno (who died aged 15 months) and Bertrand, and Elizabeth. Émilie devoted her brief life to becoming a nun. Yvonne finished nursing school before turning to sculpting, then later becoming a librarian.

Émilie died at age 20 as a result of a seizure. She had a series of seizures while she was a postulant at a convent and had asked not to be left unattended, but the nun who was supposed to be watching her thought she was asleep and went to Mass. Émilie had another seizure, rolled onto her stomach and, unable to raise her face from her pillow, accidentally suffocated. In 1970, Marie was living alone in an apartment and her sisters were worried after not hearing from her in several days. Her doctor went to her home and found her in bed, having been dead for days. A blood clot was found on her brain.

Annette and Cécile both eventually divorced, and by the 1990s the three surviving sisters were living together in the Montreal suburb of Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville.

In 1965, author James Brough wrote a book, in cooperation with the then four surviving sisters, called &quot;We Were Five&quot;. Pierre Berton published a biography called &quot;The Dionne Years: A Thirties Melodrama&quot; in 1977 and narrated a 1978 National Film Board of Canada documentary. John Nihmey and Stuart Foxman published the fictional &quot;Time of Their Lives – The Dionne Tragedy&quot; in 1986. Nihmey&#x27;s and Foxman&#x27;s book was the basis for the 1994 TV miniseries &quot;Million Dollar Babies&quot;, produced by CBC and CBS and starring Beau Bridges, Roy Dupuis and Céline Bonnier.
In 1997, the three surviving sisters wrote an open letter to the parents of the McCaughey septuplets, warning against allowing too much publicity for the children, after which they reached a $4 million settlement with the Ontario government as compensation for their exploitation.

All nine of the siblings of the quintuplets have died, the most recent in 2021. Only two sisters, Annette and Cécile, are alive today. Yvonne died in 2001.

==Museums==
The original family homestead was moved around 1960 to a location on Highway 11B, near the present Clarion Resort, and again in 1985 to North Bay and converted into the non-profit Dionne Quintuplets Museum. The museum was first located at the intersection of Highway 11 and the Trans Canada Highway and features many artifacts from the quints&#x27; early days and their growing years. , the museum closed, and the city of North Bay was considering selling the building as surplus, though a petition was circulated by citizens to have it designated and preserved as a historical structure. In 2017, plans surfaced for the city to sell the building, and relocate it to a fairground in the village of Sundridge 75 km south of North Bay.

On November 9, 2017, the City of North Bay announced plans to move the house on November 19 to a new site in downtown North Bay, on Oak Street in a vacant area between Marina Point Retirement Residence and Discovery North Bay Museum, a former Canadian Pacific Railway Station c. 1903, and reopened in spring 2019.

A second museum, the Callander Bay Heritage Museum, also features many artifacts from the Dionne quintuplets and is located in the previous home of Dr. Dafoe.

==In popular culture==

In the short story &quot;Mandarin Jade&quot;, Raymond Chandler wrote in Chapter 3 of &quot;an advertising calendar showing the Dionne quintuplets rolling around on a sky-blue floor&quot;. In chapter 11 of his 1939 novel &quot;The Big Sleep&quot;, Chandler described &quot;an advertising calendar showing the Quints rolling around on a sky-blue floor, in pink dresses, with seal-brown hair and sharp black eyes as large as mammoth prunes&quot;.
Canadian mystery writer Louise Penny said the fictional Ouellet quintuplets in her book &quot;How The Light Gets In&quot; &quot;were certainly inspired by the Dionne girls&quot;.

In the 1935 film &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot;, Chico makes an oblique reference to the quintuplets, when he says that &quot;duplicates&quot; are &quot;those five kids up in Canada&quot;.

In the 1936 film &quot;My Man Godfrey&quot;, Angelica Bullock, played by Alice Brady, references the Dionne quintuplets with the line, &quot;If a woman in Canada can have five children, why can&#x27;t Godfrey?&quot;

Three of the Dionne quintuplets (Marie, Annette, Yvonne) were referenced by Curly Howard in the &quot;Three Stooges&quot; short &quot;False Alarms&quot;, saying, &quot;Look at the little baby hoses, quintuplets!&quot;) released on August 16, 1936.

In &quot;Oily to Bed, Oily to Rise&quot; (1939), towards the end of the film, Moe Howard tells Curly to wish for quintuplets and Curly responds, &quot;we&#x27;ll honeymoon in Canada&quot; with their new found loves to make the wish come true, a reference to the Dionne quintuplets.

In the 1937 British comedy film &quot;Oh, Mr Porter!&quot;, Will Hay&#x27;s character &quot;Porter&quot; puns on &quot;Murphy&quot; telling him his wife&#x27;s had quinsy (a complication of tonsillitis), replying &quot;What, like that woman in Canada?&quot;

In the 1939 film &quot;The Women&quot;, Joan Crawford&#x27;s character Crystal Allen schemes to convince her boyfriend of her domestic skills. Her friend jokingly asks her, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you borrow the quintuplets for the evening?&quot;

In the 1941 film &quot;Dumbo&quot;, a musical number, titled &quot;Look Out for Mr. Stork&quot;, contains lyrics mentioning &quot;those quintuplets and the woman in the shoe&quot;.

In the 1944 film &quot;The Miracle of Morgan&#x27;s Creek&quot;, an American girl has six boys. The news makes headlines around the world. A newspaper headline is shown: &quot;Canada Protests: &#x27;Possible But Not Probable.&#x27; Says Premier&quot;.

In the 1945 film &quot;Duffy&#x27;s Tavern&quot;, Archie played by Ed Gardner, asks another character (Miss Duffy), &quot;what else did you see while you were up there [in Canada], did you see the, uh, quintuplets?!&quot;

In the 1946 &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; cartoon &quot;Baby Bottleneck&quot;, Daffy Duck is shown taking phone calls from a handful of celebrity fathers including Eddie Cantor, Bing Crosby and Oliva Dionne (who is quickly dismissed by Daffy with a curt &quot;Mr. Dionne, puh-lease!&quot;).

Stephen Sondheim referenced the quintuplets in his song &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; from the musical &quot;Follies&quot; with the line &quot;I got through &quot;Abie&#x27;s Irish Rose&quot;, five Dionne babies, Major Bowes ...&quot;.

A 1978 documentary &quot;Dionne Quintuplets&quot;, narrated by Pierre Berton, included news footage and interviews.

The 1994 TV miniseries &quot;Million Dollar Babies&quot; was based on the novel &quot;Time of Their Lives—The Dionne Tragedy&quot;.

The publicity around the birth and display of the quintuplets inspired the 1999 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Eight Misbehavin&#x27;.

In 2018, the birth of the quintuplets was named a National Historic Event.

The fourth episode of the Amazon television series &quot;The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel&quot; is called &quot;The Disappointment of the Dionne Quintuplets&quot;.

E.L. Doctorow references the quintuplets in his novel &quot;World&#x27;s Fair&quot; (1985) in a chapter 2 passage &quot;I don&#x27;t trust that doctor&quot;, she said of the physician attending the Dionne quintuplets. &quot;He likes the limelight too much.&quot;

Shelley Wood&#x27;s novel about the sisters, &quot;The Quintland Sisters&quot;, was published on March 5, 2019. It is a fictionalized account of the sisters&#x27; story from the point of view of one of the midwives&#x27; assistants.

Disney: &quot;Pluto&#x27;s Quin-Puplets&quot; (1937)the first animated short officially starring Plutowas cleverly created in the wake of the 1930s craze kicked up by the celebrated Dionne quintuplets: Pluto and Fifi are seen as &quot;Mr. And Mrs. Pluto&quot;, the parents of five mischievous mini-Plutos.

<doc id="353007" wikidata="Q1612134" url="?curid=353007" title="Earl Shilton">
<text>Earl Shilton ( or locally [ɪw ʃɪwʔn̩] &#x27;ill Shilton&#x27;) is a market town in Leicestershire, England, about from Hinckley and about from Leicester. The 2011 Census recorded its population as 10,047.

==Toponymy==
The town&#x27;s name derives from the Old English for &#x27;farm/settlement on a shelved terrain&#x27;. In the Domesday Book (1086) it is recorded as &quot;Scheltone&quot;. Schulton or Scheltone is an ancient word, which means shelf; Shilton is therefore Scheltone or shelf-town, a derivation supported by the village&#x27;s standing on the top of a long, narrow ridge in the southwest of the county.

==History==
===Pre-Norman period===

====Pre-history====
The village of Earl Shilton would evolve on Shilton Hill in what would be south Leicestershire. Below the hill ran an ancient trackway known as the Salt Road, connecting east and west Leicestershire. A tribe known as the Corieltauvi constructed this road, running along the southern edge of the Great Leicester Forest, a vast tract of woodland which entirely covered west Leicestershire and stretched up into Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire. The Salt Road was a major artery of trade and passage for many centuries to come.

The Corieltauvi tribe had moved to Britain from continental Europe some time after 100 BC. They were a confederation of Belgic warriors who carved out a kingdom which stretched from the Humber to south Leicestershire. These ancient Britons were not really a unified tribe, but a collection of peoples sharing the same way of life. The tribe generally did not rely on hill forts for their protection. It appears that the Corieltauvi were better farmers than warriors, for they lived in lowland settlements, usually beside streams, frequently surrounded, or even hidden, by areas of thick forest.

====Roman period====
The Roman army arrived in Britain in 43 AD, and quickly set about its conquest. Roman Legions spread north and west and by AD 47 were advancing into Leicestershire. At this time, Corieltauvi tribal chiefs were being severely harassed by their neighbours, the Brigantes, and so welcomed the Romans as a source of protection and stability. Ostorius Scapula, the Roman Governor in Britain, established the frontier zone delineated by the Fosse Way through the middle of friendly Corieltauvi territory.

Earl Shilton’s first industry arrived during this period, as a pottery was established on Shilton Heath, (behind the modern day Heathfield High School). There was an excellent vein of clay found in the vicinity of Earl Shilton’s Roman kiln. Early in the second century it started producing low grade, grey ware pots, used for everyday cookery and storage (&quot;John Lawrence&quot;).
Locally there was another pottery at Desford, and Stoney Stanton lived up to its name by the opening of a Roman quarry.

====Saxon and Danish periods====
Earl Shilton lay in the kingdom of the Middle Angles. Middle Anglia and Mercia were built around the River Trent and the rivers that flow into it, such as the Soar.

The first recorded attacks on Saxon England by Viking raiders came at the end of the eighth century. Being well inland, early Viking raids did not affect the villagers of Earl Shilton but in 874—875 a great heathen army of Danes moved up the River Trent and into the heart of Mercia. They attacked and overran Nottingham before moving their ships along the River Trent into north Leicestershire.

Domesday records show that Shultone had 5 ploughlands worth 5 shillings at the time of Edward the Confessor. Shultone’s neighbour, the village of Barwell, stood on the lands of Leofric, Earl of Mercia (&quot;John Lawrence).&quot;

===Early Medieval Earl Shilton===
==== Grandmesnil ====
Following the Norman Conquest William besieged and captured the city of Leicester in 1068, about two years after the Battle of Hastings. William handed the government of Leicester over to Hugh de Grandmesnil, one of the Norman adventurers. He also gave De Grandmesnil 100 manors for his services, sixty-five of them in Leicestershire, including Earl Shilton. He was appointed sheriff of the county of Leicester. He married Adeliza, daughter of Ivo, Count of Beaumont-sur-l&#x27;Oise. Hugh de Grandmesnil and his wife, who died in 1087, had five sons and as many daughters together.

====Domesday Survey, 1086====
Earl Shilton, like many English villages, first appears in recorded history in the Domesday Book of 1086, the first complete tax record for the whole of England. One of the parcels of land granted to Hugh de Grandmesnil by William the Conqueror was the village of &quot;Scheltone&quot;, now known as Earl Shilton. The village measured some . The village boasted 3 ploughs, with 1 serf and 4 sokemen. Sokemen were the highest class of free peasants, a lower aristocracy, and were thought to be the descendants of the Danes who settled in the East Midlands. The village also had a priest, 10 villeins and 5 bordars. Villeins and bordars were below sokemen and tied to the land. Villeins often held between , while bordars were of a lower standing and usually had a smallholding.
Attached to the village of Sheltone were of meadow and a mill of 16 pence (£0.07) value, with woodland in length and 3 broad valued at 70 shillings (£3.50). Following the Norman invasion there must have been some inflation as during the time of Edward the Confessor Sheltone&#x27;s woodland was valued at 5 shillings (£0.25). The population of the village would have been 75 to 80 people.

The fields of Earl Shilton manor were open spaces divided into long narrow strips. Only the fields being grazed by cattle were fenced. The others were open and were identifiable as separate fields only by the crops which they bore. The unusual detail was that the single crop in each field was separately farmed - in individual strips - by peasant families of the local village.

Some of the strips which belonged to the local lord, were farmed for him by the peasants under their feudal obligations. Strip-farming was central to the life of a medieval rural community. It involved an intrinsic element of fairness, for each peasant&#x27;s strips were widely spread over the entire manor; every family would have the benefit of good land in some areas, while accepting a poor yield elsewhere. The strips also enforced an element of practical village democracy. The system only worked if everyone sowed the same crop on their strip of each open field. What to sow and when to harvest it were communal decisions. The field could not be fenced, or the cattle let into it, until each peasant had reaped his own harvest. When the harvest was in the peasant would compulsorily pay their lord to grind the corn in his mill.

Ploughing too was a communal affair. The heavy wheeled plough needed for northern soils was expensive, as were horses or oxen to pull it, so a team of horses and a plough worked successive strips of an open field for different peasants. The long narrow shape of the strips reflected the difficulty of turning the team at each end. In addition to the open fields, each village or manor had common land where peasants had the right to graze cattle, collect wood, cut turf and at times catch fish.

====Robert de Beaumont====

Ivo de Grandmesnil died on a crusade to Jerusalem, and when he did not return Robert Beaumont broke his oaths and took control of the whole of Leicester. He dispossessed Ivo’s children and added all the Grandmesnil estates to his own. By sleight of hand, Earl Shilton manor was now held by Robert Beaumont, who was created the first Earl of Leicester by the king.

Beaumont died in 1118, and his son, another Robert, known as &quot;Bossu&quot;, became the 2nd Earl of Leicester. Although Robert Bossu held lands throughout the country, in the 1120s he began to rationalise his estates in Leicestershire. The estates of the See of Lincoln and the Earl of Chester were seized by force. This gave Bossu a compact block of estates which were bounded by Nuneaton, Loughborough, Melton Mowbray and Market Harborough.

=== Later Medieval Earl Shilton ===

==== Earl Shilton Castle ====
Robert Bossu was a close adviser to King Stephen of England. As such Bossu fortified his lands to protect his interests against the partisans of the Empress Matilda. During the civil war of 1135-53, it is likely that Robert Bossu began the fortification of Shilton Hill. The Earl of Leicester’s new motte and bailey castle would protect the vale of Kirkby, along with Beaumont’s lines of communication to the South and West. Earl Shilton&#x27;s castle was built around the site of an existing twelfth-century chapel called Saint Peter&#x27;s that lies between Church Street and Almey’s Lane. This area is known locally as &#x27;Hall Yard&#x27;. Nearby are the springs, from which the castle drew its water, now known as Spring Gardens.

The castle, as a fortress, lasted for 30 to 40 years before its destruction, and subsequent conversion to a hunting lodge. There are no records of a siege or fighting in the area of Earl Shilton, even during the civil war, which probably shows that the castle was doing its job (&quot;John Lawrence&quot;). When the parish church was rebuilt in 1854, the stone from the castle was used for its construction.

In 1173 Prince Henry started a rebellion against his father King Henry II. Robert de Beaumont, 3rd Earl of Leicester was in France when the rebellion began and joined the Prince’s faction, fighting several battles. While still on the road, on 17 October at Fornham, outside Bury St Edmunds, the king’s supporters attacked. The Earls of Norfolk and Leicester were surprised and defeated. Beaumont was captured and imprisoned at Falaise in Normandy. The king set about destroying the rebel Earl&#x27;s castles, including Earl Shilton. Only the fortress of Leicester and Mountsorrel survived this destruction. However, Earl Shilton manor would remain, being a good source of revenue.

==== Shilton Park ====
Shilton Park was probably created by Simon de Montfort, after he became Earl of Leicester. De Montfort’s association with the village was such that the prefix &#x27;Earl&#x27; was added to its name.

The original purpose of Shilton Park was to provide a hunting ground, stocked with game, for the lord of the manors&#x27; sport and food. The park was surrounded by a deep ditch, to keep the animals in, and beyond that, a high fence to keep the general population out. The Earl of Leicester’s park of Tooley sat below Shilton Hill, stretching into the northwest towards Desford, enclosing .

The upkeep of the park lay in the hands of the Earl&#x27;s bailiff, or &#x27;Keeper of the park&#x27;, a responsible occupation, as the park generated substantial revenue to help offset its huge running costs. It supplied a rich source of timber, horses were raised, and the park provided a continual supply of fresh meat, while fees were levied on anyone wishing to graze their animals on parklands. The bailiff could graze his own animals in the park freely, at the Earl’s discretion.

====Edmund Crouchback and after====
King Henry briefly held Shilton manor and park following the death of Simon de Montfort, before giving it to his son Edmund &#x27;Crouchback&#x27;. Created Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, Edmund &#x27;Crouchback&#x27; took possession of Earl Shilton in 1272, for a security of 3,000 gold marks, and the parish was held of Lancaster from this time (John Lawrence).

The Earl appointed Richard de Schulton, the elder, to manage the running of the estate in Earl Shilton. He also collected the Earl&#x27;s dues for the Earls of Lancaster for roughly the next thirty years.

The Manor of Sheltone 1297
The main house with gardens and all its issues are worth three shillings.
There are worth yearly £7 at 6d per acre. There are in villainage 34 bovates of land for which the villains render 10/- 5d. There are of land in villeinage which render 49s 8d. The natives hold 27 acres 1 rood which render 27s 41/2d. Free tenants render 27s 7½ d. The cottars render 80 hens worth 6s 8d. There is a windmill and a watermill worth 53s 4d, a pasture worth 40shillings. The grazing is worth 10s. The Park of Tolowe (Tooley) is not extended because the bailiff has all his animals there.

A knight, Richard de Schulton, held the land from Edmund, Earl of Lancaster, and saw to the daily business of the estate. Richard is the earliest landowner known to have lived and worked in Earl Shilton. His recorded history began when he attended King Edward I&#x27;s Easter court at Leicester in 1283. De Schulton and his wife, Constance, became lord and lady of the manor, and had at least two sons, Richard, the younger, and John. The family were minor Leicestershire gentry who are known to have held other lands in Thurleston, Mershton, Normanton juxta Thurleston, Weston juxta Blaby, Normanton Turville, Countesthorp and Bitmeswelle.

Thomas of Lancaster became the new overlord of Shilton Manor in 1298, on the death of his father Edmund &#x27;Crouchback&#x27;. Earl Shilton manor at this time had worth yearly £7.

Richard de Schulton, the elder, died in 1314. His wife remarried, and William de Nevil moved into the manor with her. This took up much court time, as the family squabbled over their inheritance with the younger Richard de Shulton.

William de Nevil was also in court for various crimes and thefts of his property. In 1321 three men from Shilton, Ricard Blodewe, John Annys and John, son of Rodger, were all charged with taking Will de Nevils&#x27; boar, worth 20 shillings and hunting it maliciously with dogs.

In 1324 Henry, who had succeeded his brother to the title of Leicester and Lancaster, met with John Norton, Mayor of Leicester and his burgesses at Shulton Manor. The great Earl&#x27;s arrival at Earl Shilton must have been a grand occasion, as accommodation and food were made available for a large retinue of barons, knights and servants.

Cost to the Mayor and Burgess of Leicester for meeting Henry, the Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, at the manor of Shulton 1324.

The burgesses&#x27; records recall the expenses of the occasion

Total £17 17s 31/2d

====Various goings on====
An armed raid took place in Earl Shilton in 1326. Nicholas de Charnels, at the head of a band of brigands, rode into Earl Shilton intent on plunder &quot;(John Lawrence).&quot; This party of raiders included three other knights, the parson of Aylmesthorp (Elmsthorpe), along with their servants and retainers. They broke into the manor house yard, taking away goods and chattels worth £300. In the Trinity Court of Edward II, held in Leicester 1326, Nicolas de Carnels, Parson John de Charnels, Walter de Bodicote of Weston, Richard de la Hay of Aylmersthorp and Roger de Claybrook of Leycester, were made to answer for their crime.

The widowed lady of the manor Constance de Shulton died on 20 May 1349, the year the Black Death arrived at Earl Shilton. Her second husband William de Nevil had already died, in 1337. Her son Richard, who must have been in his 50s, took over running the family estates at Earl Shilton. Richard de Shulton also lived for over seventy years, but by 1361 John de Neld held the manor at Shulton on the death of Henry Grosmont, Earl of Leicester.

In September 1365, burglars raided in Neubold Verdon. Tomas Danyel of Shulton and William Bannebury of Neubold, took away goods and chattels from the home of William Savage, the parson, and &#x27;dispastured his hurbage with cattle.&#x27;

The manor of Earl Shilton was given to John of Gaunt as part of her dowry when he married in 1359 Blanche, younger daughter of Henry Plantagenet, Duke of Lancaster. John of Gaunt would often enjoy the hunting offered by Shilton Park and its Manor, when he was in residence at Leicester Castle.

Robert de Swillington, a knight, was leasing a plot of land in Shilton Park by 1392. This included Priors Wood, in Kirkby Mallory, and Shilton Wood, another . It was passed onto Roger de Swillington, who on his death, in 1418, left the property to his son John, who died the following year. The woodland was passed to his sister Joan. The De Swillington family’s association with Shilton Park ended with the death of Joan in 1427.

A gang of serial poachers were caught in Shilton Park in 1420. Three men from Thorneton, Yeoman Thomas Harryson, together with Thomas Jakes and William Northowe, both husbandmen, aided by John Oakes of Odeston, were all charged with &#x27;breaking the kings park of Schulton and hunting therein&#x27;. William Armeston, representing the king also accused them of the same crime at Desford and Leicester Firth (New Parks). How the court found these poachers is not recorded, but the punishment would probably be administered in a swift and grisly fashion.

During the reign of the Yorkist King Edward IV, the Shilton Park laws were rescinded, probably as it had belonged to the Lancastrian princes, and the land was given over to the Ruding family.

====Richard III====
On Friday, 19 August 1485 King Richard III mustered his army in Leicester. He learned from his scouts that the army of Lord Stanley was at Stoke Golding while William Stanley was at Shenton. Henry Tudor and his small army were camped around Atherstone. On the following day, Richard and the royal army left Leicester expecting to meet his rival near Hinckley. Swinging to the southwest, Richard is thought to have used the ancient track way to Shilton Hill and his army spent the night camped around the churches of Shulton and Elmesthorpe. No doubt all the food in the village was requisitioned before the royal army moved on to Sutton Cheyney and Ambion Hill where Richard was defeated and killed.

At the end of the Wars of the Roses Edward Trussel held plots of land in Derby and Earl Shilton and was Overseer of Elmesthorpe manor held from Lord de la Zouche. Elmesthorpe was valued at £34 at this time, while his holdings in Earl Shilton were worth 40 shillings. When Trussel died his children were still young and his lands were held by the king, for his son, John Trussel, was still in his minority. Unfortunately John Trussel did not have very long to enjoy his estates, dying on 20 December 1499. The next heir was John’s sister, Elizabeth, who was born in 1497, and was ten years old when the court granted her inheritance in 1507. Elizabeth Trussel&#x27;s fate is unknown but shortly after this period Elmesthorpe was depopulated and the church fell into disrepair.

===Tudor era===
After the Battle of Bosworth Field, Henry VII reinstated the Park laws for Earl Shilton. Henry Churchman was appointed bailiff for the parks upkeep, and also bow bearer for the park of Leicester Firth (New Parks). George Hastings became the keeper of Earl Shilton and Hinckley Parks in 1507, and by 1560 the keeper was George Vincent.

In the reign of Henry VIII, the Crown gave a piece of the lands in Earl Shilton to Trinity Hospital, Cambridge.

In 1564, there were ten families living in Earl Shilton, less than in 1086.

===Stuart era===
In the reign of Charles I the Crown sold Earl Shilton’s farm to the Earl of Ilchester whose rents were later given up to Guy’s Hospital, London which received them for many years.

In 1636, John Wightman gave £50 for the poor of Hinckley and a field in Earl Shilton was also let, earning £3 5s per year. By 1711 Peter Cappur was the steward of the manor in Shilton and John Wightman&#x27;s legacy was in dispute. At the Court Baron for that year, on 13 October, Francis Thompson, a tenant of Studford Close, Earl Shilton, surrendered a field of 2½ acres to Nathaniel Ward and Thomas Sansome, held in trust for the poor of Hinckley. This charity ran for some time for in 1809, Rob Thompson and Thomas Sansome were the trustees.

By 1664 Earl Shilton had 34 households assessed for hearth tax, and in the reign of James II in 1687 there were 52 houses assessed in the village.

===Sale of Shilton Park at Tooley===
In 1608 Tooley contained 3,500 trees worth nearly £1000. Henry Morrison was knighted in 1627 and he and his wife bought Simon de Montfort&#x27;s hunting park of Tooley. Their daughter Letticia was married to Lucius Cary, 2nd Viscount Falkland and they lived for a time at the Park.

From the start of the English Civil War in 1642 the broad tract of country between Ashby de la Zouch, Leicester and Watling Street became the buffer zone between the rival garrisons of Royalists and the Parliamentarians. One of the first shocks that the war had in store for the civilian population was the sudden increase in the number of new taxes that had to be raised for the support of these new garrisons. Records show that the Parliamentary tax for the combined parishes of Burbage and Sketchley was £2-8 shillings and 4 pence per month.

Following the Civil War the Parliamentarians took revenge on their enemies. Earl Shilton’s Richard Churchman was listed among the gentry who in 1645 were &#x27;compounded&#x27; for their estates with the Parliamentary Sequestration Committee, along with Thomas Crofts, another Royalist. This meant that they had to pay a heavy fine to retrieve their estates.

Also the local curate William Holdsworth was accused of being a Royalist or &#x27;malignant&#x27;. John Walker, who wrote about the &quot;Sufferings of the Clergy during the Grand Rebellion&quot;, records that Holdsworth was hauled before the County Committee in 1646 for &#x27;reviling&#x27; Parliament (see also the Committee for Plundered Ministers). His offences included ignoring the Directory set by Parliament to enforce puritan reforms, refusing sacraments to those not kneeling, allowing Sunday games and reading a Royalist &quot;Protestation&quot; in the middle of a sermon. He was also accused of being &quot;several times drunk&quot; and using &quot;old notes as new sermons&quot; for the past twenty years.

===The Baptists===
There were Baptists in Earl Shilton from 1651. These Dissenters from the established church met in cottages around Church Street and Mill Street as their religion was against the law. In the Restoration the Baptists were still persecuted, and the Shilton dissenters continued to worship in secret. Eventually Baptist worship was licensed by an act of Parliament. King Charles II’s state papers say that licences to Edward Cheyney and William Biges of Earl Shilton were granted.

John Goadby died in 1714, and in his will he bequeathed to the &#x27;minister and poor Baptists in Earl Shilton - my close and its associated lands, commonly called Crowhearst. And to take any rents, fines or profits, for the disposal of the said Baptists.&#x27;

Many generations of Cheneys also worked for the Baptists, the last dying in 1815. A Baptist meeting house was built in 1758 and enlarged in 1844. The Sunday school began in 1801.

In 1861 economic disaster struck the village when the American Civil War broke out and cotton could not be exported. The Baptist minister, Reverend Parkinson, was forced to resign through lack of funds. Crowhearst and its land was eventually sold to Mr W H Cotton in 1928 and the money invested in government stock.

Not all dissenters were Baptists. William Randen was a Presbyterian.

Earl Shilton still has a Baptist church which celebrated its 360th anniversary with a special service on 22 May 2011.

===Thomas Boothby of Tooley===
In 1696, and at 15 years of age, Thomas Boothby inherited the estate of Tooley Park. Married three times, he acquired through his wives various estates in Staffordshire. From his mother, he inherited land at Foston in Derbyshire and Peatling, Countesthorpe and Earl Shilton in Leicestershire.

The ease of his position was such that the young &#x27;Tom O&#x27; Tooley&#x27; was able to devote himself almost exclusively to the pursuit of hunting. He established the first true pack of foxhounds in the country and the Quorn Hunt with a number of hounds inherited with the Tooley estate. Boothby embarked on an astonishing career of 55 seasons as founding Master of the Quorn Hunt.

Boothby kept a mistress, Catherine Holmes, at Groby Pool House. A local clergyman informed Boothby&#x27;s wife about her husband&#x27;s mistress. After his wife had confronted him, Boothby got hold of the minister in question and almost drowned him in Groby Pool.

His eldest son, Thomas Boothby-Skrymsher, was briefly member of parliament for Leicester.

===Superstition and witchcraft===
Superstition was rife in 18th-century England, and there are many tales of ghosts, witches and spirits. A woman of Earl Shilton parish declared &#x27;that she had been bewitched by an old woman from Aston in 1776. Her accuser saw the old woman unceremoniously thrown into the horse pond, despite her 80 years of age. Luckily the old woman just managed to escape with her life.&#x27;
Extract from &quot;Leicester and Nottingham Journal&quot;,
July 6, 1776:

“A woman of the parish of Earl Shilton, in the County of Leicester, has been subject for some years to a disorder resembling the bite of the tarantula, and so astonishing the ignorance of many, that they imagine that she has been bewitched by an old lady in the neighbouring village of Aston.

On Thursday, June 20th last, the afflicted, her husband and son went to the old woman, and with dreadful imprecations, threatened to destroy her instantly unless she would submit to have blood drawn from some part of her body, and unless she would give the woman a blessing and remove her disorder. The son, who is a soldier, drew his sword and pointing to her breast, swore he would plunge it into her heart if she did not immediately comply.

When the old woman had gone through the ceremony they went off, but the person not being cured they collected a great many people and on Monday last returned to Aston pretending to have a warrant to justify their proceedings. Then with uncommon brutality they took the poor creature from her house, stripped her quite naked, and after tying her hands and legs together threw her in a horse pond. She was then taken out, and in this shameful condition exhibited for the sport of an inhuman mob. As she did not sink they concluded she really was a witch, and several returning the following day determined to discipline her in this cruel manner until they should put an end to her wretched existence. The posse was not sufficiently strong, so she escaped for that time. The consideration of the old woman being over 80 years of age, and of her being a pauper and friendless, render it the duty of magistrates to exert themselves to bring to punishment these atrocious offenders.
There was also the strange tale that came to light in 1778. A house in Earl Shilton, was said to be plagued by its former long dead occupant. Tables and chairs were known to dance about the room, while pewter dishes jumped off the shelves but alarm was worse when wigs and hats flew off the heads of their wearers. Villagers agreed that the disturbed spirit was a local man who could not rest in his grave because he had been defrauded in life. (&quot;Palmer 2002)&quot;

===Peg-Leg Watts and the stocks===
In 1705, the payment by the Reeve for Shilton manor was £34 8s 6d. The Reeve was voted into office annually by the freeholders of the parish. There were 61 freeholders who voted in 1719, but this number had dropped to 28 by 1785.

The Overseer of the manor had various facets to his job. Daniel Marvin, Overseer in 1755, made charges of 5 shillings for ale at the burial of a pauper.

In 1760, Alderman Gabriel Newton, of Leicester gave to Earl Shilton and Barwell £20 16s from his charity, for the educating of 20 poor boys from each village.

James Perrott was a successful surgeon who worked in Earl Shilton. He married the widow, Lady Ann Sharpe, and they lived in the village for over 40 years, until she died 1791, at the age of 62 years.

Famous for his prowess as a wrestler Samuel Marvin also lived in Earl Shilton.

The last person to be incarcerated in the Earl Shilton stocks was a man called &#x27;Peg-leg Watts&#x27; for a now unknown offence. The stocks were situated opposite the old churchyard. Also in the vicinity there was the village round house or gaol or lock-up. Unfortunately all traces of which have now disappeared.
An inclosure act, the (18 Geo. 3. c. &quot;40&quot; ), was passed on 27 March 1778. Earl Shilton&#x27;s open fields, meadows and 1,500 acres (6 km2) of heath land were all enclosed. Thomas, Viscount Wentworth, was entitled to all small tithes vacarial dues in Shilton.

Scrymshire Boothby had the entitlement of the great tithes, payment in lieu of tithes, hay and meadow lands in Hall fields and Breach field. The following year Scrymshire Boothby sold Tooley Park to John Dod, and the remainder of the estate was divided.

Shilton Heath, famed for over a century for its steeple chasing, was gone for good.

Viscount Wentworth also had his lands in Elmsthorpe enclosed, including an extensive rabbit warren. He exchanged these after 1778 for of land in Shilton parish.

===Earl Shilton Turnpike===
The turnpike trust had two toll gates at Earl Shilton. One at the bottom of Shilton Hill, which was kept by a man called Harrison for many years. The other tollgate was where the Belle Vue road meets the Hinckley road. Travellers were said to have gone around by Elmesthorpe to avoid the gate and its tolls.

The gates were administered by the turnpike trusts, but were bid for every year by prospective candidates, which led to local corruption. Bribes were offered to win the contract, and not all of the money was spent on the upkeep of the roads. Many small parishes like Earl Shilton had a large mileage of roads within their boundaries and found it well-nigh impossible to maintain them.

Roads and pathways were very bad indeed. Cart-ruts ran deep down the main streets and the stones on the old &quot;corseys&quot; (footpaths) must have been very dangerous at times. Loose stone was very often strewn about, and it remained for the carts to roll them in, and in the era of the toll-gate the wider the wheels the less toll they paid to go through them. A great handicap, however, was the fact that these carts often followed in the existing ruts as a matter of course, and so made them worse. Roads and repairs were paid for through the Vestry, which had replaced the Barons Court of the 17th century. The Vestry met for many years in the Plough Inn, Church Street, setting the parson&#x27;s rate, church rate, poor rate, overseers rate, watch rate and the highway rate for the parish.

Stagecoaches passed frequently through Earl Shilton, it being on the route to Hinckley and Birmingham from Leicester. Coaches with names such as &quot;The Accommodation&quot;, &quot;The Magnet&quot; and &quot;The Alexander&quot; were all running in 1830. Coaches stopped at a place near to the White House in Wood Street, beside the Lord Nelson Inn. On one tragic occasion a coach overturned near to the entrance of Burbage Common and a man was killed in the resulting wreckage.

In 1800 there were 249 inhabited houses in Earl Shilton, with a further 8 uninhabited. The population stood at 1,287, 655 males and 632 females. Agriculture employed 118 villagers, while the 716 people employed in trade and manufacture showed the dramatic rise of stocking manufacture.

===The latter days of knitwear industry===
The economy of the village in the 19th century was based mainly on boots and stockings. Stocking makers worked ten, twelve and even 15 hours a day at their frames, for seven or eight shillings per week. Frame rents were high and varied from one shilling to three shillings per week. Poverty and disease were rife. In Hinckley there was a framework knitters&#x27; strike in 1824. Two years later, disorder in the town was quelled when a detachment of lancers arrived, killing one man.

The Earl Shilton village population had risen to 2,017 by 1831.

Many Earl Shilton people in the 1840s became destitute and sought refuge in the Union Workhouse at Hinckley, locally known as &quot;The Bastille&quot;. Economic conditions had become very bad, the decade became spoken of as the &quot;Hungry Forties&quot;. Queen Victoria ordered an inquiry into the distress, and in 1843 sent a commission headed by a Mr. Muggeridge, who obtained much information from interviewing work-people and employers. Earl Shilton frame-work knitters and hosiers gave evidence at the enquiry. Rich Wileman, of Shilton, described himself as the oldest stocking manufacturer in the kingdom, and stated that many thousands of dozens of socks were sent to the American market every year.

At a time when a reasonable daily wage was 4/-, a report showed the weekly earnings in 27 parishes varied from 4/- to 8/- a week, Hinckley district being 5/3, Bosworth 4/6, Ibstock 4/- and Shepshed 5/6. Frame rents in the cottages were high and varied in different parishes from 1/- to 3/- per week. This rent and the addition of the Truck Act 1831, made poverty and disease rife in the Leicestershire parishes. The Truck Act stated that goods had to be paid for in cash instead of in kind and, as usual, hit the poorest the hardest. Had it not been for their allotments grounds, things would have been much worse, as it was many were close to starvation.

Sheep stealing, highway robbery and burglary were common in the 1840s. It was not safe to go out after dark. If a man was caught sheep stealing, he was sentenced to 14 years transportation, which was also the sentence for anyone who was driven by hunger to take a pheasant from the woods.

In 1844 there were in Shilton alone 650 stocking frames. Mr. J. Homer, giving evidence to the commission, said that the whole of these were in the houses of the workpeople at that time. Neither the workshop, nor the factory system was in operation in Earl Shilton until after the findings of the commission were made public.

Stocking making in the home quickly died out with the introduction of the factory system. Both the boot and shoe and the hosiery industry eagerly took to the new system of working and for the first time people began to be regulated by time, as the factory needed villagers to work in unison. The last known stocking-frame in Earl Shilton disappeared when its owner, a man named Mr. Pratt, who lived in Wood Street, died.

Earl Shilton saw its first hosiery strike in 1859. The employers involved were Messrs. Homer &amp; Everard. Almost 130 operatives took strike action, and an appeal was sent out to workers of three counties for aid for the Earl Shilton strikers to fight it.

===The Old Volunteers===
The traditional greeting of the Leicestershire miners was &#x27;old bud&#x27; (old bird). This has now been replaced by &#x27;me duck&#x27;.

Many Shilton men joined the old &#x27;Volunteers&#x27;, belonging to the Hinckley Company; these were later incorporated in the &#x27;Militia&#x27;. Clad in their red jackets, blue trousers and pipe clayed trimmings with pointed helmets, it is said that on Saturday nights Earl Shilton resembled a garrison town when everyone wore their uniform.

The &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot; was first published in 1836. Newspapers in the 18th and 19th century were very few, and many Shiltonians brought up before the First World War remembered when one copy was shared by several families. These were read aloud in the candlelight of the poor homes of the villagers, the few people able to read being in great demand. The old Candle House, where candles were made, stood for many years in Almeys Lane, and during renovations to the Baptist Chapel much brickwork of the Candle House was incorporated in the building.

Election days in the village were, prior to the universal franchise, very hectic. The candidates usually arrived at the polling stations (usually the schools) in horse cabs. They were often assaulted by the crowds, and top hats worn in those days were often sent flying. Many of the rougher element were given beer and locked up for the day to preserve the peace.

Morris dancing took place on Plough Monday, when the dancers went round the village to collect money. If this was refused they entered the house and refused to quit until ransom was paid either in cash or food. Fishing nets on long canes were carried to reach bedroom windows where they had locked doors. German bands also visited the village, as did travelling bears, which danced to music.

In 1861 the village crier was Thomas Foster, who advertised sales, meetings and public news. The last man to hold this post was a blind man called Bannister, who also made baskets.

Houses in the village were rented by groups of men who, when they had finished their work, then &quot;shopped it&quot;, or took it, to some central depot in the village, and were usually paid each trip. &#x27;Sweaters&#x27;, or child labour, were often exploited, and regularly after a period of drunkenness these sweaters were compelled to sit working all night with their elders to make up for lost time. Many worked from the age of eight or nine, in the local parlance &quot;got more kicks than half pence.&quot;

===Job Toon===
In the middle of the 19th century Job Toon began trading as a grocer and licensed victualler in Earl Shilton. Job was a devout Methodist, and his shop was still trading in 1868. In 1850 he installed his first stocking frame in his home, which laid the foundations of J Toon and Son. He worked the stocking frame with his wife Matilda, and gradually purchased more frames and rented them out in the community. Job would pay for the stockings produced, minus the rent of the frame. Job purchased a small building just off Wood Street, and the early factory was powered by steam. Horse and drey took the factory produce to Elmesthorpe station.

Job Toon had three sons Alfred, James and Carey. Alfred and James went into the hosiery business, while Carey became a successful local farmer. Alfred was the senior partner and earned a salary of £5 per week. In those early days stockings were not so delicate and were sold by weight, warmth not high fashion appears to be paramount as the heaviest were the most expensive. In this period much of Toon’s trade was with South America. Alfred had four sons, two of them died in the 1930s, and his two surviving sons, Stanley and Carey, took over the firm that now operated over 1,000 knitting machines.

===The Wake===
The &#x27;Wake&#x27;, or local fair, was a holiday in Earl Shilton and held always held on the last Sunday in October, traditionally on the saints day of the parish church. According to old accounts in the parish, Ale drunk on Feast Day (Wake) in 1809 was £5 12s. 0d, and in 1820 £6 5s. 6d. People had a full week’s holiday from work, public houses were open all day, and &quot;captains&quot; were elected to take charge of the singing. The captain was also responsible for the whips round for beer, which entitled all and sundry to drink together and so retain the company.

The wide portion of the Hollow, nearest the Wesleyan Chapel, was the earliest site for the Wake amusements. The stalls and roundabouts extended the full length of Wood Street. The wakes also incorporated a procession around the village.

Mr. Hopkins, a well-known resident of Keat’s Lane, was a proprietor of amusements. A large boat on wheels, and drawn by horses, went the whole length of the village, for the use of the children.

At the turn of the 20th century a field in Station road also became the site for the annual wake or fair. The amusement part of the &quot;Wakes,&quot; roundabouts, etc., were very prominent on this field.

On the other side of the road there were also numerous entertainments from time to time, including those well-known &quot;Strolling Players&quot; of Holloway’s Theatre. Many people enjoyed these shows and were able to see fresh plays every night in the players&#x27; stay at Shilton. No one may now recall the plays &quot;Maria Martin and the Red Barn,&quot; &quot;The Face at the Window,&quot; &quot;The Dumb Man of Manchester,&quot; but they did drawcrowds.

===The Pinfold===
An old stone building, which stood near to the Baptist Chapel, was known as the Pinfold. This was a place for penning stray cattle prior to the enclosure of the common fields - 1758. It was latterly used as a place for weighing stone from the old Parish Quarry.

In the village a knocker-up was employed in the 1880s and for over 50 years ensured that people attended the early Sunday morning classes.

===The Old Smock Mill===
The Old Smock Mill stood near to the Parish Quarry. Built around 1800, at a cost of £800, it stood for over a century before being demolished. It was a noted landmark and a favourite place for rambles and picnics. There were two other mills in Earl Shilton, one stood on the Wood Street Recreational ground near the &#x27;Mount&#x27;, while the other was near the top of Birds Hill.

It is possible to go the whole length of &quot;Old Shilton&quot; without touching the main street, via a maze of paths known as &quot;The Backs.&quot; The reason for their preservation is believed to be that the old field pathways have kept their rights of way throughout the centuries, and the haphazard planning of the straggling village made desirable the small alleys leading to the main street.

Wood Street, locally known as Wood End, is the way leading to the wood referred to in the Domesday Survey, via the &quot;Heath Lane,&quot; which was noted in the 17th century for steeple chasing. The Raven family possessed an enormous mangle. This was considered to be an outsize of its kind, and washing came from the village to The Hollow to be mangled by it.

The Workhouse Gardens and Spring Gardens are names to be conjured with in this area near the church. No doubt both had great bearing in the life of the community in bygone days. Rackett Court once stood near to the &quot;Hill Top.&quot; These were old Tudor buildings, and a flue sketch of them can be seen in &quot;Highways and Byways of Leicestershire.&quot; A recluse by the name of John Freestone was the last occupant. On the opposite side of the road is an ancient barn, containing very massive oak beams. This gives the name to this part of the locality of the Barn-end.

There are a few old Georgian three-storied houses around &quot;Hill Top,&quot; and a very old thatched house opposite the &quot;Roebuck Inn,&quot; with date on the front of the year 1714. It is one of the very few thatched ones surviving in Shilton. Keats Lane was formerly known as &quot;Cake Lane,&quot; and once it contained many old-fashioned houses. It overlooks the Vale of Kirkby and other scenery. 

A bake-house was situated many years ago near to Whitemore’s factory, and a bell was rung when the oven was hot. This was when the bread was made at home and sent to the bakers. This is probably, too, the origination of &quot;Cake Lane.&quot; There was also a bake house in Candle Maker Alley, a small lane running between Almys Lane and the top of The Meadows, where between the World Wars, local folk would take their roasts along to be cooked in the oven.

Near to the present West Street stood the old Yew Tree Farm, prior to the erection of the present Jubilee Terrace. A malt-house once stood on this spot, and when it was demolished a large wall was built with the bricks, facing the present &quot;Fender Row.&quot; This wall has now disappeared with the building of the Council houses.

The &quot;Dog and Gun Inn&quot; was removed in the 1930s to another site at Keat’s Lane, a little distance from where the old licensed house had sold beer for over 150 years. This old building still exists today as a private house.

There was also in Keat’s Lane, up until the 1940s, a glove business that used hand frames, and was run by Mr Linney. Spindle Hall, close by, was the last dwelling house in memory to contain the old glove frames. &quot;Wightmans Row&quot; and the old &quot;Glove-Yard&quot; have, like many more old houses, been demolished.

===Trade and the Civil War in America===
In 1861 the American Civil War broke out, and Earl Shilton was hard hit by the Union blockade of the Confederate States&#x27; ports, preventing cotton exports. Conditions akin to famine prevailed in Earl Shilton as the chief trade of the area was frame-work knitting, carried out in nearly every house. The Baptist minister, the Rev. Parkinson, had to resign through lack of funds. The Rev. Freesdon said &quot;that a church that could not support its minister, and a pastorate that had commenced with so many signs of blessing, ended through a war raging on the other side of the Atlantic&quot;.

At this time building of Elmesthorpe Road was begun as relief work. Many of the workers received no more than bread and meat for their labour. At this time more than 1,200 people were out of employment. The work was sponsored by the Earl of Lovelace and his daughter, the Lady Anne Noel, and carried out in 1862–63. They also forwarded £800 to the unemployed cotton workers to work worsted instead of cotton.

The depression seemed to continue for many years, and the figures given by the Hinckley District Relief Committee in July, 1864, make interesting reading -
Subscriptions raised in Earl Shilton parish were to the amount of £161 1s. 4d, while the destitute poor received from that fund £992 10s. 4d., in addition of flour, 30 sides of bacon, 100 tons of coal and left-off clothing were distributed by this fund in the district.

Toward the end of the 19th century several pieces of land were held by the parish as charitable lands. They were Town Land Meadow, Town Land Close, the Barn Close (near Hill Top), the Old Close and part of Breach Field. These lands were rented out and the income used for poor relief. Among other relief the poor of the parish would receive bread at Easter and Coal at Christmas. Allotments were also set-aside for the poor. One set of plots was at the bottom of Shilton Hill and a second in the Townlands off Breach Lane.

===The Brick Works and Gas Works===
Station road was known as Breach Lane before the railway arrived, and with the exception of &quot;The Lodge&quot; and a few houses near to the Hollow it was very thinly populated.

The old brickworks were situated on the site of present Metcalfe Street, which was named after Mr. James Metcalfe, for many years a headmaster at the High Street Church of England School.

The Gas Works (now dismantled) were also situated in Station road, and were built in 1866 by the Earl Shilton Gas Light and Coke Company. Mr A Lee was the manager.

===The Social Institute===
The Social Institute (known locally as the &#x27;Stute&#x27;) was founded at the turn of the 20th century to provide a social and sporting outlet for the young men of Earl Shilton. Its first home was in two rooms above the H.U.D.C. gas showroom in Wood Street.

A Grand Bazaar was held in Earl Shilton on 28–29 December 1908, at the High Street School, to raise funds for a new building for the Social Institute. There was also a public subscription, and a mortgage guaranteed by local industrialists, who were the founders and formed the Management Committee. The new premises were built in Station Road in 1909. The Institute organised football, cricket, chess club, skittles and billiards, and had a rifle range. The building is now used by the community and has 5 full size snooker tables and hosts regular Ju Jitsu classes &amp; Little Stars play school and a food bank once a week.

===Harrys===
Annually circuses and wild animal shows were held in Earl Shilton, before to the advent of the cinema.

In 1910 the Royal Rink roller skating rink was opened. Later Mr H S Cooper converted it into the Picture House cinema. It was popularly nicknamed &#x27;Harrys&#x27;.

After the Second World War generations grew up attending the Saturday matinees at the Picture House, or sessions at the new, outdoor, roller skating rink built beside it. The grandeur of the old Royal Rink could never match the Danilo or Gaumont in Hinckley, but it still drew a sizeable crowd. In the 1960s the cinema was taken over by Mr Cooper&#x27;s daughter Freda, and her husband Jack Aldridge, who had formerly run a local taxi firm.

===Roman Catholic church and Normanton Hall===
The Roman Catholic church of St Peter was built in 1908 in Mill Lane. The Roman Catholic school next to it was built in 1910 for the education of 80 children. A convent and priest’s house were added later. The church was under the patronage of the Worswick family, who had their country seat at Normanton Hall (now demolished), which was outside Earl Shilton on the road to Thurleston.

In the First World War, German prisoners of war were held at Normanton Hall. A fire destroyed Normanton Hall in 1925, and the property was subsequently sold off. Shortly after the demolition of the house, the ornate altar was presented to St Peter&#x27;s church. A fire in the 1940s, destroyed part of the building.

The convent was several times empty in the 1930s and 1940s, but was reconditioned and used as a seminary. It was for some years also used as a hosiery factory.

In 1983 a new Roman Catholic Church of SS Peter and Paul was completed in Melton Street.

===Boy Scouts===
The first Boy Scouts troop was formed around 1916. The original Master for the Earl Shilton troop was Mr Horace Perkins, and Mr W Cotton was president.

Mr Perkins recalled -
&#x27;Much of the Scouts equipment was homemade. In the early days we water proofed heavy bed sheets and would sew them into tents&#x27;. The Scout troop took part in the World Jamboree, at Olympia, London in 1920. During the Jamboree they camped at Barnet, Hertfordshire.

===First World War===
A thousand men from Earl Shilton served in UK forces in the First World War. Many men from Earl Shilton, in the Fifth Battalion, the Leicestershire Regiment, also served in Ireland in the 1916 Easter Rising. The village factories also supplied the Government with thousands of pairs of socks and army boots. These same manufacturers also supplied vast orders for the Russian Cossacks.

In the latter part of the war, Earl Shilton held a &#x27;big gun week&#x27;, when a large howitzer was paraded around the village. Many were invited to buy War Bonds. Military bands often visited the village to inspire recruiting. In a very different age when information was seriously censored and patriotism was paramount, young men clamoured to join up. In one week alone 80 enlisted, and were cheered on by crowds of happy followers as they marched to Elmesthorpe station on their way to the Western Front.

Hostilities ended on 11 November 1918. All work was suspended for the day, while flags and bunting appeared in windows. Fireworks were let off and a comic band toured the streets. Watching silently were the German prisoners of war who were working in the area and billeted at nearby Normanton Hall.

A captured field gun stood for a time near the Wesleyan Chapel, and was removed for a time to a field off station road. The gun&#x27;s final resting place was the Wood Street Recreation Ground, which was once a sand pit, where the gun was later buried.

More than 100 men from the village were killed in the conflict, and a cenotaph was erected in their memory. Two soldiers, both Earl Shilton men, who died in 1916 and 1917, are buried in the parish churchyard. On wake Sunday 1919, and for many years afterwards, the British Legion, public bodies and factories held a parade for the dead.

===Second World War===
In the Second World War there were 192 air raid alerts in Earl Shilton, the first occurring on 26 June 1940 and the last on 20 March 1945. The village siren was erected on the factory of Toon and Son in Wood Street. Many villagers had shelters put in their gardens, but there were also public shelters in Wood Street, Station Road, Almey’s Lane, Keats Lane, The Hollow and Belle Vue.

The Home Guard, was organised in June 1940. They had their headquarters in a large house near Birds Hill called &#x27;Holydene&#x27;. Three parachute mines were dropped on the night of 20 November 1940. One landed in Barwell while the other two came down in the Northwest corner of Earl Shilton. One of these mines failed to explode, and there were no casualties.

More incendiaries fell in Elmesthorpe on 4 December 1940. The German plane was brought down near Leicester Forest East. The Earl Shilton Home Guard were called out to the scene and prisoners were taken.

At 7am on 27 July 1942, a lone German bomber dived out of the clouds near the church and let go of three stick bombs. They landed at the back of Mr T Carter’s farm in Church Street, destroying a barn and badly damaging a house. Mr Carter had a very lucky escape himself, as he was out in his yard at the time only from the blast. A bull was so badly injured that it had to be put down. The plane went on to machine gun those unfortunate enough to be going to work.

At the top end of the village, the Air Raid Patrol wardens, met in the back room of the Plough, a Public House then run by Joe Lucas. They patrolled the streets checking the blackout and fire watching.

There was a munitions factory opened in the village. The village also took child refugees from Coventry, Birmingham and London.

Soldiers were billeted in most of the public buildings in the war. The military authorities requisitioned the Working Men&#x27;s Club dance hall, the Adult School Hall, the Social Institute, Constitutional Club, and the Co-op village hall. After the Dunkirk evacuation, the Sussex Yeomanry moved into the village, being replaced in turn by the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Royal Artillery, Royal Marines and the Pioneer Corps. The Wesleyan Chapel in the Hollow was transformed into a British Restaurant, for the troops. Training was undertaken on the recreation grounds and other open spaces around the village. Mr Astley’s sand pit in Heath Lane was used as a shooting range.

About 900 local men and women served in the UK armed forces, of whom 25 were killed on active service. One local man, Ordinary Seaman Ernest Holt, of , who died in October 1939, is buried in the parish churchyard Two soldiers are buried in the separate Earl Shilton Cemetery.

==Industry==
William Iliffe introduced the knitting frame to Hinckley in 1640. In 1694, Sir Verney Noel, of Kirkby Mallory, left £100 for the poor children of Earl Shilton to be sent to London, to be taught the art of Framework Kitting.

Between the 19th and late 20th centuries, Earl Shilton was an industrial village with numerous shoe, hosiery and knitwear factories. The boot and shoe factories included Orton&#x27;s, Eatough&#x27;s and Pinchess&#x27;s, and other, smaller, operations. At one time Earl Shilton produced boots for the Russian army.

Many of these businesses have now closed due to competition, but a few continue into the 21st century. Alongside the boot and shoe trade other businesses thrived, including local carriers such as Woodwards (now the bakery distribution business) and Crowfoots (still operating as a parcel carrier). Both of these businesses are now based nearby in Barwell.

The Earl Shilton Building Society was established in the village in 1857 and still has its head office here. In 2022 it was the second-smallest building society in the UK.

==Transport==
The town is on the A47 road, with a bypass opened in 2009. Bus services come from Arriva Midlands and Stagecoach Midlands, with services running around the town to Hinckley, Nuneaton and Leicester.

The South Leicestershire Railway, formed in 1850, extended its line to Elmesthorpe where a station was built to serve Earl Shilton and Barwell in 1863. It closed in 1968. The nearest railway station today is at Hinckley.

== Education ==
===Earliest school===
Thomas Green succeeded to the Baptist Church in Earl Shilton and in 1801, started the village&#x27;s first school, where reading and writing were taught, as well as elementary knowledge of the Christian faith. In 1850 John Green kept the school and was the master. He was given notice to quit; having displeased the Church. The notice, however, was cancelled and he was advised to &quot;keep things in order.&quot; This school kept going until 1858, when the Church of England Schools were built. The Church of England Schools had room for 200 children and cost £1,050 to build, the money being raised by subscription and grants. One school stood in the High Street and another in Wood Street.

===Wood Street School===
In 1871 Wood Street School opened for around 30 pupils and the headmistress was a Miss Witnall. Wood Street was a very small school with only 2 classrooms. In 1907 they added 2 extra classrooms and a corridor, as village expansion led to overcrowding at the school. By 1965, numbers had risen to such a degree that they used the church hall for school dinners, physical education and music and movement sessions.
Wood Street School was partly burned down in the early hours of 17 January 1984, following a break in. The curtains were set alight which in turn ignited an oil feed pipe, causing major damage and ultimately the school&#x27;s demolition.

===Present day===
Four primary schools serve the town, as well as the secondary school Heath Lane Academy (formed in 2016 by the merger of William Bradford Academy and Heathfield Academy) in the north of the town.

==Media==
Television signals are received from either the Waltham or Sutton Coldfield TV transmitters. The town is served by both BBC CWR and BBC Radio Leicester. Other radio stations including Capital East Midlands, Smooth East Midlands, Hits Radio East Midlands, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands and Carillon Radio, a community based station. The town is served by these newspapers, &quot;Leicester Mercury&quot;, &quot;Hinckley Times&quot; and &quot;Earl Shilton News&quot; which is an online local newspaper. 

==Sport==
Sport has been represented in Earl Shilton by several worthy exponents, especially at cricket. The present Earl Shilton Town Cricket Club play at Keats Lane to the north of the town. Sam Coe (1873-1956), Arthur Hampson (1878-1952), Loni Brown and Joe Brown were all selected for county honours. Billy Ball and George Panter, of an older generation, were also outstanding. Earl Shilton had a regular fixture at one period with Coventry and North Warwickshire Sports Club.

Shilton Victors, a football team who had their headquarters at the &quot;King William IV&quot; public house, won three cups in a single day, a very noteworthy achievement. Most of the factories in the village ran sides for the benefit of the Earl Shilton Sunshine League. These matches were played after tea when work ceased, and very keen rivalry was witnessed, and good football without the frills was usually served up for the large crowds that assembled. Mr. H. Bradbury presented a silver cup that was played for each year by knock-out competition. The venue for these hectic matches was in a field off Station Road at the rear of the Constitutional Club. By 1923 Earl Shilton had many football clubs playing. The church and chapel fielded useful sides, also very often second elevens. The Adult School fielded three sides for quite a long time, and rented two fields, one which was situated on The Mount. The town&#x27;s present-day football team, Earl Shilton Albion FC play in the Leicestershire Senior League Division One, and their home stadium is Stoneycroft Park.
Bob Newton (1946–2009), a professional footballer who appeared in Football League matches for Leicester City and Bradford City, was born in Earl Shilton.

Norman Dagley (1930-1999) was born and raised in Earl Shilton and when he turned 14, like most boys of his time he joined The Earl Shilton Social Institute and there under the tutoring of Reg and Jack Wright he learned the game of billiards. Norman was a naturally gifted billiards player and won many county and national competitions and eventually he turned professional and reached the world professional championship in 1977. Norman became the first billiard player to win all the major billiard trophies in one season. Since his death Norman’s trophies and cue and case are on display in The Stute snooker hall near his favourite table 3.

Foot racing was once very popular, and many wagers were run for around the local fields. On one occasion the village sweep who was to cycle on his three-wheeler, challenged a well-known local runner to race from Shilton Hill to Kirkby, the runner to have the length of the hill start. The runner was easily passed down the Kirkby Lane and retired.

Between the World Wars Earl Shilton boasted a horticultural society, which held an annual flower and sports event in a field in Kings Walk. Cycle racing, high jumps, donkey racing and all manner of foot racing were part of its programme.

A short lived greyhound racing track was opened during 1928. The racing was independent (not affiliated to the sports governing body the National Greyhound Racing Club) and was known as a flapping track, which was the nickname given to independent tracks.

<text>A solo dance is a dance done by an individual dancing alone, as opposed to couples dancing together but independently of others dancing at the same time, if any, and as opposed to groups of people dancing simultaneously in a coordinated manner. Solo dancers are usually the best dancers in a group or dance school. Most solo dancers start after about 6–7 years of dance or sooner. Most soloists are company kids from their dance school. They are usually in more than one dance.

In Comparsas, there are various soloists who strut in front. They usually dance at the edges of the street so that the viewing public can appreciate their moves. Most male soloists carry a large lantern-like artifact on a large pole, resting on an oily pouch, which they spin at will. Dance is a way to express emotions.

<doc id="353009" wikidata="Q7885077" url="?curid=353009" title="Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act">
<text>The Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act (1985, revised 1989), was recommended as a Uniform Act in the United States. The Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act subsequently was passed by many states. The Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act was replaced as a recommended Uniform act by the Uniform Health-Care Decision-making Act in 1993. The law allows a person to declare a living will specifying that, if the situation arises, he or she does not wish to be kept alive through life support if terminally ill or in a coma. The patient may also obtain a health care power of attorney. This power of attorney appoints an agent to make medical decision for the patient in case the patient becomes incompetent.

Many people make use of this act because they do not wish to endure any pain or suffering if weakened by a fatal disease. They want to &quot;die with dignity,&quot; so that family members will not have to go through emotional pain of watching their loved one sleep through many years of life with no response to any stimuli.

This form of death is known as passive euthanasia, where death is not inflicted with drugs, but is allowed by cutting off life support.

<doc id="353010" wikidata="Q1612298" url="?curid=353010" title="Barwell">
<text>Barwell is a village and civil parish in Leicestershire, England, with a population of 8,750 residents in 2001, increasing to 9,022 at the 2011 census. The name &quot;Barwell&quot; literally translates as &quot;Stream of the Boar&quot; and is said to originate from a boar that used to drink from the well near a brook in Barwell. It was originally known as &quot;Borewell&quot;, but later became &quot;Barwell&quot;. The brook is now called the River Tweed, and is a tributary of the River Trent.

The village has two churches; Barwell Methodist Church in Chapel Street, and St Mary&#x27;s Church, Barwell in Church Lane. St. Mary&#x27;s was built in 1220. A board inside the church lists all of the rectors up to the present day, beginning with &quot;William&quot; in 1209.

The village has two football clubs, Barwell FC and AFC Barwell, as well cricket teams and a large indoor bowling complex.

The Queens Head is the oldest public house, and second oldest building in the village. In 1902 the pub was owned by one Sarah Ann Powers. It was later owned by the Haines family. In recent years, the old pub roof has naturally deformed so that it is no longer straight. In the 1980s the front of the building was completely restored and returned to its original style after years of Victorian style &quot;black and white&quot;.

==History==
It was on the lands of Leofric, Earl of Mercia, a rich and powerful magnate who had fought alongside Canute in his wars against Wessex. In old English, &quot;wella&quot; is the word for stream and &quot;bar&quot; the name for boar, and so this clearing in the woods was known in the Saxon tongue as Barwelle. In 1043, Earl Leofric and his wife, Godiva, established a Benedictine Abbey at Coventry and gave the Abbot and his twenty-four attendant monks, lands for their upkeep. Barwelle, along with nineteen other villages passed into the domains of the Abbot of Coventry.

Following the Norman Conquest, Barwelle was still held by the Abbey of Coventry. By 1086, there were 14 villagers with a priest, and 3 smallholders with 2 ploughs; a plough being a plot of land that can be cultivated by one team of oxen. There was a meadow 1 furlong by 1 furlong (201 by 201 m) in size and woodland 3 furlongs by 1 league (604 by 5556 m). The value of which was 30 shillings (£1.50).

The manor of Barwell which is described in Domesday Book as &quot;ancient demesne&quot;, was later given to Hugh de Hastings, a steward and favourite of Henry I, and held in fee along with many other local manors from the priory of Coventry for the service of a single knight&#x27;s fee.

In 1564 there were 48 families living in Barwell, according to a church census.

John Nichols describes an interesting tale of a wych-elm called &quot;The Spreading Tree&quot; or &quot;Captain Shenton&#x27;s tree&quot; (pg. 476). As recounted, Captain Shenton who served in the royalist army returned to his house at Barwell with several other officers after the battle of Worcester. Hearing that the parliamentarians were looking for him he sank his portmanteau and valuables in the moat which surrounded the house, and sought refuge in the tree. Despite being close enough to overhear his enemies discussing the price on his head the bold Captain Shenton escaped capture and kept his estate, passing it on through his daughters. The tree was apparently held sacred for many years by the Powers family for preserving their ancestor.

In June 1646 the inhabitants of Barwell and surrounding villages made several submissions to the county committee for losses and free quarter from the local parliamentary garrisons. In June, 1646 Mr Gearey from Barwell claimed that Captain Ottaway from the Coventry garrison took a gelding worth five founds and that William Capenkwist and Thomas Bacon, his servants, had taken a mare worth one pound (Exchequer SP 28/161).

After a long and confusing list of owners, the manor of Barwell was purchased in 1660 by a certain John Oneby. Barwell was well known for its market gardeners that traditionally supplied the Leicester market with fresh produce. Nichols provides an interesting illustration of the church and its adjoining parsonage house (p. 477) pulled down in 1746 and rebuilt.

Until recent times, Barwell, together with neighbouring Earl Shilton, was a centre for shoe production in the East Midlands. The area is also known for hosiery, especially in nearby Hinckley.

===Barwell meteorite===

Barwell and neighbouring Earl Shilton were the site of a meteor event when, on Christmas Eve 1965, the villages were showered with fragments from an object about the size of a traditional Christmas turkey. No one was hurt, although some minor damage to buildings and property occurred.

One meteorite went through the front of a car, destroying its engine. When the owner of the car attempted to claim on his insurance company, they replied that it was an &quot;Act of God&quot; and would not pay. Outraged, the owner went to the priest of the local church and asked for the money, saying &quot;If it was an Act of God, the Church should pay for his car.&quot; The owner never received any money to repair his car.

Professor Sylvester-Bradley of Geology Dept at Leicester University confirmed that the fragments were from a chondrite and appealed for further specimens. Locals were requested not to wash any pieces found, but to wrap them in newspaper and hand in at the local police station.

A piece of the meteorite is on display at the Herbert Museum in Coventry.

In December 2016, Leicestershire County Council unveiled a plaque in Barwell, marking the meteorite event that happened within the village. The plaque was originally nominated by Barwell Parish Council and was later accepted by the County Council as part of their Green Plaque Awards Scheme. The plaque is situated towards the southern part of the village, close to the site of the original meteorite fall.

The inscription on the plaque reads:

==Community facilities==
The local council launched a community house in 2009 to help tackle anti-social behaviour. As part of the scheme, the House hosts a number of events throughout the year.

Since 2017, the Barwell Bloomers have been brightening up the village with planters and hanging baskets.

===Sport===
Barwell takes part in the longest continuous cricket fixture in the world, when they play Coventry and North Warwickshire in their annual match. The match traditionally took place in Wakes week. The fixture began when the pastors of Coventry church and Barwell church arranged a game. The game was even played throughout the war, when representatives from each team would come and bowl an over at each other.

The village has a senior football team, Barwell, who play in the Southern Football League Premier Division Central. Following the demise in 2013 of Hinckley United this became the largest football side in the area. Barwell plays their home matches at Kirby Road.

In addition to the senior team, AFC Barwell is another football team which plays in the village. AFC Barwell has achieved community charter standard status and operates in the Earl Shilton and Hinckley area as well as Barwell. AFC Barwell offers football coaching and matches to around 300 children, both girls and boys, between the ages of 3 and 18 years old. AFC Barwell teams play in matches at weekends and train twice a week.

Since 2013, AFC Barwell&#x27;s home has been a purpose-built Sports Complex located off Dovecote Way, Barwell. The £700,000 building was built by Barwell Parish Council with most of the grant funding coming from the Football Foundation.

==Industry==
Between the 19th and late 20th centuries, Barwell was a busy industrial village consisting of numerous shoe, hosiery and knitwear factories. These once large factories have all ceased trading. Competitive pressure from abroad was partly to blame; other factors included the 1965 credit squeeze which affected shoe and hosiery firms.

Nevertheless, Barwell still retains several industrial estates, including Dawsons Lane, Stapleton Lane (Stapleton Lane industrial estate has been demolished by the local council and is now a residential area with approximately thirty houses) and the larger Moat Way, which ostensibly specialise in warehousing and distribution. Examples include the parcel company Crowfoots Carriers employing around 100 people, Bachmann Industries Europe who design products locally, but have them manufactured in China by their parent company, Kader Industries.

Some smaller and specialist manufacturers still remain, such as Labelsco, which produces labels for the pharmaceutical industry.

Arriva Midlands operate their Hinckley local bus services from a depot within the village alongside the ArrivaClick operations serving nearby New Lubbesthorpe.

<doc id="353011" wikidata="Q1168846" url="?curid=353011" title="Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union">
<text>Seventeen days after the German invasion of Poland in 1939, which marked the beginning of the Second World War, the Soviet Union entered the eastern regions of Poland (known as the &quot;Kresy&quot;) and annexed territories totalling with a population of 13,299,000. Inhabitants besides ethnic Poles included Belarusian and Ukrainian major population groups, and also Czechs, Lithuanians, Jews, and other minority groups.

These annexed territories were subsequently incorporated into the Lithuanian, Byelorussian, and Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republics and remained within the Soviet Union in 1945 as a consequence of European-wide territorial rearrangements configured during the Tehran Conference of 1943 (see Western Betrayal). Poland was compensated for this territorial loss with the pre-War German eastern territories, at the expense of losing its eastern regions. The Polish People&#x27;s Republic regime described the territories as the &quot;Recovered Territories&quot;. The number of Poles in the Kresy in the year 1939 was around 5.274 million, but after ethnic cleansing in 1939-1945 by Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union and Ukrainian nationalist forces, Kresy consisted of approximately 1.8 million inhabitants. The post-World War II territory of Poland was slightly smaller than the pre-1939 land areas, shrinking by some (roughly equalling that of the territories of Belgium and the Netherlands combined).

==Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact==
Early in the morning of August 24, 1939, the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed a 10-year non-aggression pact, called the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact. Most notably, the pact contained a secret protocol, revealed only after Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1945, according to which the states of Northern and Eastern Europe were divided into German and Soviet &quot;spheres of influence&quot;. In the North, Finland, Estonia and Latvia were assigned to the Soviet sphere. Poland was to be partitioned in the event of its &quot;political rearrangement&quot;—the areas east of the Narev, Vistula and San Rivers going to the Soviet Union while Germany would occupy the west. Initially annexed by Poland in a series of wars between 1918 and 1921 (primarily the Polish-Soviet War), these territories had mixed urban national populations with Poles and Ukrainians being the most numerous ethnic groups, with significant minorities of Belarusians and Jews. Much of this rural territory had its own significant local non-Polish majority (Ukrainians in the south and Belarusians in the north).

Lithuania, adjacent to East Prussia, would be in the German sphere of influence, although a second secret protocol agreed in September 1939 assigned the majority of Lithuania to the USSR. According to the secret protocol, Lithuania would retrieve its historical capital Vilnius, subjugated during the inter-war period by Poland.

==Soviet annexation of eastern Poland, 1939–1941==

The Polish–Soviet border, as of 1939, had been determined in 1921 at the Treaty of Riga peace talks, which followed the Polish–Soviet War. Under the terms of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, two weeks after the German invasion of western Poland, the Soviet Union invaded the portions of eastern Poland assigned to it by the Pact, followed by co-ordination with German forces in Poland. See map.

During the Interbellum period, the Second Polish Republic had carried out an oppressive programme of Polonization against its Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Jewish minorities. In a programme referred to as the Pacification of Ukrainians in Eastern Galicia, the buildings, belongings, and property of Ukrainians were destroyed and their inhabitants were often beaten and arrested. According to Ukrainian-Canadian historian, Orest Subtelny, these events constituted &quot;collective punishment&quot; meted out on thousands of &quot;mostly innocent peasants&quot; and resulted in the exacerbation of animosity between the Polish state and the Ukrainian minority. Similar oppressive actions were also carried out against the Belarusian population of Poland. The Soviet Union cited a &quot;need to protect&quot; the Ukrainian and Belarusian majority populations in these regions as a reason justifying the Soviet invasion of Eastern Poland (including Western Ukraine and Belarus), carried out in the wake of Poland&#x27;s dismemberment under the Nazi invasion with Warsaw being besieged and with Poland&#x27;s government being in the process of evacuation. Consequently, many Ukrainians, Belarusians and Jews welcomed the Soviet troops into the occupied territories. The total area, including the area given to Lithuania, was , with a population of 13.299 million, of which 5.274 million were ethnic Poles and 1.109 million were Jews. An additional 138,000 ethnic Poles and 198,000 Jews fled the German occupied zone and became refugees in the Soviet occupied region. The borders were finalized in the September 28 German–Soviet Frontier Treaty, most of whose contents were kept secret.

Soviet authorities immediately started a campaign of sovietization. Passportization and residence registration of the population in the newly acquired territories began. Inhabitants of Kresy, on whom Soviet citizenship was imposed in November 1939, had to return documents issued by &quot;former Poland&quot; and obtain new citizenship of the USSR. The NKVD used the passportization system to carefully select people still living in Western Belarus and Western Ukraine. Those who did not receive the citizenship or refused to accept it (claiming that they were Polish citizens or not agreeing to enter Ukrainian or Belarusian nationality) were arrested or deported.

In March 1940, the authorities also decided about the fate of refugees from western Poland, who from September 1939 were in Kresy. Deportation of this group of about 75–80 thousand people, consisting mainly of Jews (about 84%), finally began on June 29, 1940, and lasted for nearly a month.

The Soviets organized staged elections, the result of which was to become a legitimization of Soviet annexation of eastern Poland. Soviet authorities attempted to erase Polish history and culture, withdrew the Polish currency without exchanging ruble, collectivized agriculture, and nationalized and redistributed private and state-owned Polish property. Soviet authorities regarded service for the pre-war Polish state as a &quot;crime against revolution&quot; and &quot;counter-revolutionary activity&quot;, and subsequently started arresting large numbers of Polish citizens. During the initial Soviet invasion of Poland, between 230,000 to 450,000 Poles were taken as prisoner, some of whom were executed. NKVD officers conducted lengthy interrogations of the prisoners in camps that were, in effect, a selection process to determine who would be killed. On March 5, 1940, pursuant to a note to Stalin from Lavrenty Beria, the members of the Soviet Politburo (including Stalin) signed an order to execute POWs, labeled &quot;nationalists and counterrevolutionaries&quot;, kept at camps and prisons in occupied western Ukraine and Belarus. This became known as the Katyn massacre, in all some 22,000 were executed.

During Perestroika, former top ministers of Stalin such as Lazar Kaganovich and Vyacheslav Molotov claimed that in Katyn, of the 22,000 Polish officers, roughly 3,000 were killed by the NKVD in 1940, while others were later executed by Nazis.

During 1939–1941 1.45 million of the people inhabiting the region were deported by the Soviet regime, of whom 63.1% were Poles, and 7.4% were Jews. Previously it was believed that about one million Polish citizens died at the hands of the Soviets, however recently Polish historians, based mostly on queries in Soviet archives, estimate the number of deaths at about 350,000 people deported in 1939–1945.
Andrzej Paczkowski puts the number of Polish deaths at 90–100,000 of the 1.0 million persons deported and 30,000 executed by the Soviets.

The Vilnius Region, annexed by Poland in 1920, was transferred to Lithuania on the basis of Lithuania-Soviet Union agreement. Other northern territories were attached to Belastok Region, Hrodna Region, Navahrudak Region (soon renamed to Baranavichy Region), Pinsk Region and Vileyka (later Maladzyechna) Region in Byelorussian SSR. The territories to the south were transferred to the Ukrainian SSR: Drohobych Oblast, Lviv Oblast, Rivne Oblast, Stanislav (later known as Ivano-Frankivsk) Oblast, Ternopil Oblast and Volyn Oblast.

==German occupation 1941–1944==
These areas were conquered by Nazi Germany in 1941 during Operation Barbarossa. The Nazis divided them up as follows:
* &quot;Bezirk Białystok&quot; (district of Białystok), which included the Białystok, Bielsk Podlaski, Grajewo, Łomża, Sokółka, Vaukavysk, and Hrodna counties and was &quot;attached to&quot; (not incorporated into) East Prussia;
* &quot;Generalbezirk Litauen&quot; – the Vilna Province was incorporated into Lithuania, itself incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ostland;
* &quot;Generalbezirk Weißruthenien&quot; – most of the Polish part of White Ruthenia (the western section of modern-day Belarus) was incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ostland;
* &quot;Generalbezirk Wolhynien und Podolien&quot; – the Polish provinces of Volhynia and Polesie, which was incorporated into the Reichskommissariat Ukraine; and
* &quot;District Galicia&quot;, East Galicia, which was incorporated into the General Government and became its fifth district.

During 1943–1944 ethnic cleansing operations took place in Ukraine (commonly known as the Massacres of Poles in Volhynia) which brought about an estimated 100,000 deaths and an exodus of ethnic Poles from this territory.

The Polish and Jewish language population of the regions in 1939 totaled about 6.7 million. During the war, an estimated 2 million persons perished (including 1.2 million Jews). These numbers are included with Polish war losses. 2 million (including 250,000 Jews) became refugees to Poland or the West, 1.5 million were in the territories returned to Poland in 1945 and 1.2 million remained in the USSR. Contemporary Russian historians also include the war losses of Poles and Jews from this region with Soviet war dead.

==Soviet 1945 re-annexation and incorporation of the majority of the territories==

At the end of World War II, the Soviet Union annexed most of the territory it had invaded in 1939.

===Preliminary arrangements=== 
Soon after the Soviet re-entry to Poland in July 1944 in pursuit of the German army, the Polish prime minister from London flew to Moscow along with Churchill in an attempt to prevent the Soviet annexation of Poland in accordance with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact signed by the Soviet Union. He offered a smaller section of land, but Stalin declined, telling him that he would allow the exiled government to participate in the Polish Committee of National Liberation. An agreement between the Allies was reluctantly reached at the Yalta Conference where the Soviets would annex the entirety of their Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact portion of Eastern Poland but would grant Poland part of Eastern Germany in return. These agreements were then confirmed and consolidated at the Potsdam Conference. Thereafter, eastern Poland was annexed into the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic and the Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic. The Western Allies were unaware of the existence of the secret clause dividing Poland between Hitler and Stalin already in 1939 along the Curzon Line.

===Returned areas===
Some parts of eastern Poland occupied by the Soviet Union in 1939 with an area of and 1.5 million inhabitants near Białystok and Przemyśl were returned to postwar Poland.

===Border treaty===

On August 16, 1945 the Communist-dominated Provisional Government of National Unity signed a treaty with the USSR to formally cede these territories. The total population of the territories annexed by the USSR, not including the portion returned to Poland in 1945, had an estimated population of 10,653,000 according to the 1931 Polish census. In 1939 this had increased to about 11.6 million. The composition by language group was Ukrainian 37.1%, Polish 36.5%, Belarusian 15.1%, Yiddish 8.3%, Other 3%. Religious affiliation: Eastern Orthodox 31.6%, Roman Catholic 30.1%, Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church 26.7%, Jewish 9.9%, Other 1.7%.

==Further events==
From 1944 until 1952 the Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UIA) were engaged in an armed struggle against the communists. As a result of the skirmishes between the UIA and Soviet units, the Soviets deported 600,000 people from these territories and in the process 170,000 of the local population were killed in the fighting. See also Operation Vistula.

In June 1951, the Soviet–Polish border was realigned in two areas.

<text>The Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995 (NT) was a law legalising euthanasia in the Northern Territory of Australia, which was passed by the territory&#x27;s Legislative Assembly in 1995. The Act was passed by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 25 May 1995 by a vote of 15 to 10, received the Administrator&#x27;s assent on 16 June 1995, and entered into force on 1 July 1996. A year later, a repeal bill was brought before the Northern Territory Parliament in August 1996, but was defeated by 14 votes to 11.

The effect of the law was nullified in 1997 by the federal Parliament of Australia which passed the &quot;Euthanasia Laws Act 1997&quot;. The Act continues on the Territory&#x27;s statute books, however this was repealed in December 2022 with the passing of Restoring Territory Rights Act. Dr Philip Nitschke founded Exit International in response to the overturning of the Act.

While voluntary euthanasia had previously been condoned officially in the Netherlands and the US state of Oregon, the act was the first time that a legislative assembly passed a law explicitly legalising euthanasia.

==Provisions of Act==

The Act allowed a terminally ill patient to end their life with medical assistance, either by the direct involvement of a physician or by procurement of drugs.

The Act set out a somewhat lengthy application process, designed to ensure that a patient was both mentally competent to make the decision and in fact terminally ill. Under the Act:

* a patient had to be over 18 and be mentally and physically competent to request their own death,
* the request had to be supported by three doctors, including a specialist who confirmed that the patient was terminally ill and a psychiatrist who certified that the patient was not suffering from treatable depression,
* once the paperwork was complete, a nine-day &quot;cooling-off period&quot; was required before the death could proceed.

Those who assist in the ending of a person&#x27;s life under the Act were immune from prosecution or other legal consequences if acting in good faith. (Sections 16 and 20).

Euthanasia was legalised in Australia&#x27;s Northern Territory, by the &quot;Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995&quot;. It passed the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly by a vote of 15 to 10. In August 1996 a repeal bill was brought before the Parliament but was defeated by 14 votes to 11. The law was later voided by the federal &quot;Euthanasia Laws Act 1997&quot;, which is a federal law that was in effect until 13 December 2022 and prevented parliaments of territories (Specifically the Northern Territory, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island) from legalising euthanasia or assisted dying. Before the federal override occurred, three people died through physician assisted suicide under the legislation, aided by Dr Philip Nitschke. The first person was a carpenter, Bob Dent, who died on 22 September 1996.

==Reaction to Act==
The passage of the Bill—one of the first of its kind in the world—provoked a furor in Australia, and indeed in much of the rest of the world. The Act received both widespread support from &quot;death with dignity&quot; and right to die groups who saw it as a model to be followed elsewhere, and widespread condemnation from euthanasia opponents, such as right to life groups, who sought to overturn it.

Opponents also included the Australian Medical Association, and the Bishop of Darwin, Edmund John Patrick Collins.

==Use of Act==
While the law was in effect, four people undertook euthanasia through its provisions.

The first was carpenter Bob Dent, 66, who died on 22 September 1996. Dent was a prostate cancer sufferer who became Australia&#x27;s first person to lawfully end his life by means of physician assisted suicide. Dent, who had been suffering from prostate cancer for five years in what he called &quot;a rollercoaster of pain&quot;, left an open letter when he died that stated: &quot;If I were to keep a pet animal in the same condition I am in, I would be prosecuted. If you disagree with voluntary euthanasia, then don&#x27;t use it, but don&#x27;t deny the right to me to use it.&quot; He died with the help of Dr Philip Nitschke.

The law applied to non-residents of the Northern Territory as well, and one non-resident did take advantage of the law. A resident of South Australia, Janet Mills, 52, came to Darwin in December 1996. She had suffered for some 10 years from a rare disease known as mycosis fungoides. She used Nitschke&#x27;s device to take her life on 2 January 1997.

In addition, an anonymous 69-year-old male cancer patient used the law and Nitschke&#x27;s device to die on 22 January 1997. A further two people had received approval to use the law when the law was nullified; a proposed amendment to the &quot;Voluntary Euthanasia Laws Bill&quot; allowing them to proceed did not pass.

==Overturning of the Act==
While some people in the Northern Territory were unhappy with the Act and campaigned for its repeal, the Northern Territory legislature was unwavering in its support. Views in the rest of Australia were much less supportive, however, and opponents began demanding that the federal parliament overturn the law, which it had the power to do since the Northern Territory does not have the same standing in Australian jurisprudence as the states. The federal parliament could not have overturned an identical state law, since the states are sovereign entities possessing legislative power in their own right. However, self-governing territories like the Northern Territory derive their power by way of a grant from the federal parliament. Consequently, the federal parliament retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the right to territory laws. In practice, it very rarely exercised that right.

On 25 March 1997, the federal parliament passed the &quot;Euthanasia Laws Act 1997&quot;, which, although not technically repealing the &quot;Rights of the Terminally Ill Act&quot;, for all practical purposes rendered it of no legal effect. Rather than repeal the Act directly, the law instead amended the &quot;Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978&quot;, the act under which the Commonwealth Parliament has delegated legislative power to the Northern Territory Parliament—effectively the territory&#x27;s &quot;constitution&quot; or &quot;charter&quot;—removing the Territory&#x27;s constitutional power to pass any law permitting euthanasia. The Act technically remains in force in the Territory, but has been essentially made null and void and has no legal effect.

Although passed as a reaction to the situation in the Northern Territory, the &quot;Euthanasia Laws Act 1997&quot; made similar amendments with respect to Australia&#x27;s two other self-governing territories, the Australian Capital Territory and Norfolk Island, also preventing them from passing a law permitting euthanasia. The &quot;Euthanasia Laws Act 1997&quot; has no effect on the power of an Australian state to pass any law permitting euthanasia.

=== Current status ===
Following the passage of the &quot;Euthanasia Laws Act 1997&quot;, several attempts were made to repeal the Act in the federal Parliament. On 1 December 2022, the &quot;Restoring Territory Rights Act 2022&quot; was passed, repealing the 1997 Act and returning power to the parliament of the Northern Territory and other self-governing territories to legislate euthanasia laws. In September 2023, Northern Territory chief minister Natasha Fyles formed a panel to take public inquiries regarding euthanasia laws. The panel reported its findings in July 2024.

<doc id="353015" wikidata="Q27074928" url="?curid=353015" title="Hairy woodpecker">
<text>The hairy woodpecker (Leuconotopicus villosus) is a medium-sized woodpecker that is found over a large area of North America. It is approximately in length with a wingspan. With an estimated population in 2020 of almost nine million individuals, the hairy woodpecker is listed by the IUCN as a species of least concern. Some nomenclature authorities, such as the eBird/Clements checklist, place this species in the genus &quot;Dryobates&quot;.

==Taxonomy==

The hairy woodpecker was described and illustrated with a hand-coloured plate by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; which was published between 1729 and 1732. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the twelfth edition, he included the downy woodpecker, coined the binomial name &quot;Picus villosus&quot; and cited Catesby&#x27;s book. The specific epithet &quot;villosus&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;hairy&quot;. Linnaeus specified the type locality as &quot;America septentrionali&quot; (North America), with specific mention of Raccoon, New Jersey. The hairy woodpecker was formerly usually placed in either &quot;Dendrocopos&quot; or &quot;Picoides&quot; but a molecular phylogenetic study published in 2015 found that these genera did not form monophyletic groups. In the revised generic classification, the hairy woodpecker was moved to the genus &quot;Leuconotopicus&quot; that was erected by the French ornithologist Alfred Malherbe in 1845. Some taxonomic authorities place the hairy woodpecker in an expanded &quot;Dryobates&quot; that includes all the species in the genera &quot;Leuconotopicus&quot; and &quot;Veniliornis&quot;.

Seventeen subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;L. v. septentrionalis&quot; (Nuttall, 1840) – west North America from south Alaska to Ontario to New Mexico
* &quot;L. v. picoideus&quot; (Osgood, 1901) – Queen Charlotte Island (off British Columbia, Canada)
* &quot;L. v. harrisi&quot; (Audubon, 1838) – southeast Alaska to north California
* &quot;L. v. terraenovae&quot; (Batchelder, 1908) – Newfoundland
* &quot;L. v. villosus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766) – southeast Canada, north central and northeast USA
* &quot;L. v. orius&quot; (Oberholser, 1911) – south central British Columbia to southeast California and southwest Utah
* &quot;L. v. monticola&quot; (Anthony, 1898) – central British Columbia to north New Mexico
* &quot;L. v. leucothorectis&quot; (Oberholser, 1911) – southeast California to west Texas
* &quot;L. v. audubonii&quot; (Swainson, 1832) – southeast USA
* &quot;L. v. hyloscopus&quot; (Cabanis &amp; Heine, 1863) – west and south California, north Baja California (Mexico)
* &quot;L. v. icastus&quot; (Oberholser, 1911) – southeast Arizona, southwest New Mexico to west Mexico
* &quot;L. v. intermedius&quot; (Nelson, 1900) – east Mexico
* &quot;L. v. jardinii Malherbe, 1845 –&quot; south central and east central Mexico
* &quot;L. v. sanctorum&quot; (Nelson, 1897) – southeast Mexico to northwest Nicaragua
* &quot;L. v. extimus&quot; (Bangs, 1902) – north central Costa Rica to west Panama
* &quot;L. v. piger&quot; (Allen, GM, 1905) – north Bahamas
* &quot;L. v. maynardi&quot; (Ridgway, 1887) – south Bahamas

==Description==
Adults are mainly black on the upper parts and wings, with a white or pale back and white spotting on the wings; the throat and belly vary from white to sooty brown, depending on subspecies. There is a white bar above and one below the eye. They have a black tail with white outer feathers. Adult males have a red patch or two side-by-side patches on the back of the head; juvenile males have red or rarely orange-red on the crown.

The hairy woodpecker measures from in length, in wingspan and in weight. It is virtually identical in plumage to the smaller downy woodpecker. The downy has a shorter bill relative to the size of its head, which is, other than size and voice, the best way to distinguish them in the field. These two species are not closely related, however, and are likely to be separated in different genera. Another way to tell the two species apart is the lack of spots on its white tail feathers (present in the downy). Their outward similarity is a spectacular example of convergent evolution. As to the reason for this convergence, only tentative hypotheses have been advanced; in any case, because of the considerable size difference, ecological competition between the two species is slight.

==Distribution and habitat==
The hairy woodpecker inhabits mature deciduous forests in the Bahamas, Canada, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, and the United States. It is a vagrant to Puerto Rico and the Turks and Caicos Islands. Mating pairs will excavate a hole in a tree, where they will lay, on average, four white eggs.

These birds are mostly permanent residents. Birds in the extreme north may migrate further south; birds in mountainous areas may move to lower elevations.

==Behavior and ecology==
These birds forage on trees, often turning over bark or excavating to uncover insects. They mainly eat insects, but also fruits, berries and nuts, as well as sometimes tree sap. They are a predator of the European corn borer, a moth that costs the US agriculture industry more than $1 billion annually in crop losses and population control.

<doc id="353016" wikidata="Q5803752" url="?curid=353016" title="List of municipalities of Norway">
<text>Municipalities in [[Norway]] are the basic unit of local government. Norway is divided into 15 administrative regions, called counties. These counties are subdivided into 357 municipalities (as of 2024). The capital city Oslo is both a county and a municipality.
Municipalities are responsible for primary education (through 10th grade), outpatient health services, senior citizen services, welfare and other social services, zoning, economic development, and municipal roads and utilities. The municipality is governed by a municipal council of directly elected representatives. The mayor is indirectly elected by a vote of the municipal council. Law enforcement and church services are provided at a national level in Norway.

Municipalities are undergoing continuous change by dividing, consolidating, and adjusting boundaries. In 1930, there were 747 municipalities in Norway. As of 2024, there are 357 municipalities. See the list of former municipalities of Norway for further details about municipal mergers.

The consolidation effort has been underway since the work of the Schei Committee in the 1960s. This work has been complicated by a number of factors. Since block grants are made by the national government to the municipalities based on an assessment of need, there is little incentive for the municipalities to lose local autonomy. The national policy is that municipalities should only merge voluntarily, and studies are underway to identify potential gains.

== Terminology ==
There are two different writing standards in Norway: Bokmål and Nynorsk. Norwegian municipalities are named or (plural) or (the singular form is the same in both Bokmål and Nynorsk). The Norwegian word is loaned from the French word , which ultimately derives from Latin word , (&quot;common&quot;). The Kven equivalent is . Historically, the word or was used in Norway as the name for municipalities. That word derived from the old hundred that was used all over northern Europe. Since the 1960s, that name has fallen out of use across Norway, although a small group of municipalities in the Hardanger region of Western Norway still use the name &quot;herad&quot; such as Voss herad, Ulvik herad, and Kvam herad. Ullensvang Municipality used the name &quot;herad&quot; until 2020.

Norway also has some municipalities that are bilingual or trilingual due to the presence of many native Sami people living there. In Northern Sámi, there are two words for a municipality: and . Both are loan words from Scandinavian languages, the first of which is related to the Norwegian words sokn and sogn (a parish). The second term is related to the Norwegian word (prestegjeld). Lule Sámi likewise has two words for municipalities: and . The Southern Sámi word is .

== Administration ==
Each municipality has its own governmental leaders: the mayor ( or ) and the municipal council (). The mayor is the executive leader. The municipal council is the deliberative and legislative body of the municipality and it is the highest governing body in the municipality. The members of the municipal council are elected for a four-year term. A subdivision of the full council is the executive council (), composed of five members. Historically, the council has been known as a , using the old name for a municipality.

<doc id="353017" wikidata="Q319511" url="?curid=353017" title="Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal">
<text>D. Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal and 1st Count of Oeiras (13 May 1699 – 8 May 1782), known as the Marquis of Pombal ( ), was a Portuguese statesman and diplomat who despotically ruled the Portuguese Empire from 1750 to 1777 as chief minister to King Joseph I. A strong advocate for absolutism, and the ideals of the Age of Enlightenment, Pombal led Portugal&#x27;s recovery from the 1755 Lisbon earthquake and reformed the kingdom&#x27;s administrative, economic, and ecclesiastical institutions. During his lengthy ministerial career, Pombal accumulated and exercised autocratic power. His cruel persecution of the Jesuits and Portuguese lower classes led him to be known as Nero of [[Trafaria]] (), after a village he ordered to be burned with all its inhabitants inside, for refusing to follow his orders.

The son of a country squire and nephew of a prominent cleric, Pombal studied at the University of Coimbra before enlisting in the Portuguese Army, where he reached the rank of corporal. Pombal subsequently returned to academic life in Lisbon, but retired to his family&#x27;s estates in 1733 after eloping with a nobleman&#x27;s niece. In 1738, with his uncle&#x27;s assistance, he secured an appointment as King John V&#x27;s ambassador to Great Britain. In 1745, he was named ambassador to Austria and served until 1749. When Joseph I acceded to the throne in 1750, Pombal was appointed as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.

Despite entrenched opposition from the hereditary Portuguese nobility, Pombal gained Joseph&#x27;s confidence and, by 1755, was the king&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; chief minister. Pombal secured his preeminence through his decisive management of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, one of the deadliest earthquakes in history; he maintained public order, organized relief efforts, and supervised the capital&#x27;s reconstruction in the Pombaline architectural style. Pombal was appointed as Secretary of State for Internal Affairs in 1757 and consolidated his authority during the Távora affair of 1759, which resulted in the execution of leading members of the aristocratic party and allowed Pombal to suppress the Society of Jesus. In 1759, Joseph granted Pombal the title of Count of Oeiras and, in 1769, that of Marquis of Pombal.

A leading &quot;estrangeirado&quot; strongly influenced by his observations of British commercial and domestic policy, Pombal implemented sweeping commercial reforms, establishing a system of royal monopolistic companies and guilds governing each industry. These efforts included the demarcation of the Douro wine region, created to regulate the production and trade of port wine. In foreign policy, although Pombal desired to decrease Portuguese reliance on Great Britain, he maintained the Anglo-Portuguese Alliance, which successfully defended Portugal from Spanish invasion during the Seven Years&#x27; War. Pombal enacted domestic policies that prohibited the import of black slaves into mainland Portugal and Portuguese India, and established the &quot;Companhia Geral de Pernambuco e Paraíba&quot; to strengthen the commerce of African slaves to Brazil, put the Portuguese Inquisition under his control with his brother as chief inquisitor, granted civil rights to the New Christians, and institutionalized Censorship with &quot;Real Mesa Censória&quot;. Pombal governed autocratically, curtailing individual liberties, suppressing political opposition, and fostered the black slaves trade to Brazil. Following the accession of Queen Maria I in 1777, Pombal was stripped of his offices and ultimately exiled to his estates, where he died in 1782. His legacy was only partially rehabilitated about a century after his death, due to efforts by his descendants, and remains highly controversial.

==Early life==

Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo () was born in Sernancelhe, Viseu, Portugal, the son of Manuel de Carvalho e Ataíde, a country squire with properties in the Leiria region, and of his wife Teresa Luísa de Mendonça e Melo. His uncle, Paulo de Carvalho, was a politically-influential cleric and professor at the University of Coimbra. During his youth Sebastião José studied at the University of Coimbra and then served briefly in the army, reaching the rank of corporal, before returning to academic study. He then moved to Lisbon and eloped with Teresa de Mendonça e Almada (1689–1737), the niece of the Count of Arcos. The marriage was a turbulent one, as she had married him against her family&#x27;s wishes. Her parents made life unbearable for the young couple; they eventually moved to Melo properties near Pombal. Sebastião José continued his academic pursuits, studying law and history and securing admission in 1734 to a royal historical society.

Sebastião José was fluent in Portuguese and French.

==Political career==
Prior to his appointment as prime minister in 1755, Pombal had a relatively obscure career.

In 1738, with his uncle&#x27;s assistance, Pombal received his first public appointment as the Portuguese ambassador to Great Britain, where, in 1740, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. Carvalho e Melo used his circulation among influential people to &quot;investigate the causes, techniques, and mechanisms of British commercial and naval power.&quot; He did not become fluent in the English language during his time in London.

In 1745, he served as the Portuguese ambassador to Austria. The Queen consort of Portugal, Archduchess Mary Anne Josepha of Austria (1683–1754), was fond of him; after his first wife died she arranged for him to marry the daughter of the Austrian field marshal Leopold Josef, Count von Daun. The King, John V, was not pleased, however, and recalled him in 1749. John V died the following year and his son Joseph I of Portugal was crowned king. Joseph I was fond of Pombal; with the Queen Mother&#x27;s approval he appointed him as Minister of Foreign Affairs. As the King&#x27;s confidence in him increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. 

By 1755, the King appointed him Prime Minister. Impressed by Britain&#x27;s economic success which he had witnessed as ambassador, Pombal successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal.

In February 1761, during the reign of D.José I, Pombal banned the import of black slaves within mainland Portugal and Portuguese India, not for humanitarian reasons, which were contrary to his nature, but because they were necessary labor workforce in Brazil. At the same time, he encouraged the trade in black slaves (&quot;the pieces&quot;, in the terms of that time) to that colony, and two companies were founded, with the support and direct involvement of the Marquês de Pombal - the Grão Pará and Maranhão Company and the &quot;Companhia Geral de Pernambuco e Paraíba&quot; - whose main activity was precisely the trafficking of slaves, mostly Africans, to brazilian lands. The list of shareholders of the two companies included, in addition to the Marquis, many nobles and clergy. Between 1757 and 1777, a total of 25,365 black slaves were imported to Pará and Maranhão, coming from West African ports.

He reorganised the army and the navy, and ended the Limpeza de Sangue (cleanliness of blood) civil statutes and their discrimination against New Christians, the Jews that had converted to Christianity, to escape the Portuguese Inquisition, and their descendants regardless of genealogical distance,

==Pombaline Reforms==
The Pombaline Reforms were a series of reforms intended to make Portugal economically self-sufficient by means of expanding Brazilian territory, streamlining the administration of colonial Brazil, and fiscal and economic reforms both in the colony and in Portugal. However, these encountered difficulties and ultimately failed in modernizing both the Portuguese and the Brazilian economies.

During the Age of Enlightenment Portugal was considered small and unprogressive. It was a country of three million people in 1750. The economy of Portugal before the reforms was a relatively stable one, though it had become dependent on colonial Brazil for much of its economic support, and England for much of its manufacturing support, based on the Methuen Treaty of 1703. Even exports from Portugal went mostly through expatriate merchants like the English port wine shippers and French businessmen like Jácome Ratton, whose memoirs are scathing about the efficiency of his Portuguese counterparts.

The need to grow a manufacturing sector in Portugal was made more imperative by the excessive spending of the Portuguese crown, the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, the expenditures on wars with Spain for South American territories, and the exhaustion of gold mines and diamond mines in Brazil.

His greatest reforms were, however, economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He created the Douro Wine Company which demarcated the Douro wine region for production of Port, to ensure the wine&#x27;s quality; his was the second attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe, after the Tokaj region of Hungary. He ruled with a heavy hand, imposing strict laws upon all classes of Portuguese society, from the high nobility to the poorest working class, and via his widespread review of the country&#x27;s tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart; but also from the common people who saw the centralization and control of the wine production as harmful to their own businesses. After the Company was established in the city of Porto, several riots began in the city against Pombal&#x27;s reforms. The rioteers even managed to barge their way inside the Company&#x27;s headquarters and take the Director of the Company as a hostage. The riots were eventually calmed but Pombal&#x27;s brutality was once more shown when he ordered the main rioteers to be executed and their bodies displayed above Porto&#x27;s medieval gates. After a few months of not being allowed to take the bodies down, the Bishop of Porto had to officially ask the king to allow the bodies to be put to rest.

Further important reforms were carried out in education by Pombal: he expelled the Jesuits in 1759, created the basis for secular public primary and secondary schools, introduced vocational training, created hundreds of new teaching posts, added departments of mathematics and natural sciences to the University of Coimbra, closed University of Evora, and introduced new taxes to pay for these reforms. However, many of these reforms were a complete failure, as the old Jesuits schools were not adequately replaced, and it took over one century to recover the same levels of literacy in Portugal.

==Lisbon earthquake==
Disaster fell upon Portugal on the morning of 1 November 1755, when Lisbon was awakened by a violent earthquake with an estimated magnitude of 9 on the Richter scale. The city was razed by the earthquake and ensuing tsunami and fires. Pombal survived by a stroke of luck and, unshaken, immediately took upon the task of rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: &quot;What now? We bury the dead and heal the living.&quot; Despite the calamity, Lisbon suffered no epidemics and, within less than a year, was already partially rebuilt. This rapid recovery can be attributed to the quick response on the part of the Marquis to enact several &quot;Providences&quot; with the aim of stabilizing the situation and helping the inhabitants of Lisbon.

The new central area of Lisbon was designed by a group of architects specifically to resist subsequent earthquakes, employing a new construction method, &quot;caging&quot;, which consisted of a wooden framework erected in the early stages of construction, granting the building a better chance of withstanding an earthquake due to the inherent flexibility of the material. Architectural models were built for tests, with the effects of an earthquake being simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and major squares of the Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon are one of its main attractions: they are the world&#x27;s first earthquake-resistant buildings. Pombal also ordered a pioneering survey that was sent to every parish in the country with several questions, including about the earthquake — the Parochial Memories of 1758.

The questionnaire asked whether dogs or other animals behaved strangely prior to the earthquake, whether there was a noticeable difference in the rise or fall of the water level in wells, and how many buildings had been destroyed and what kind of destruction had occurred. It seems that the results were not properly analysed during the 18th century, in part due to the death of the person in charge, but the answers have allowed modern Portuguese scientists to reconstruct the event with greater precision.

Because the marquis was the first to attempt an objective scientific description of the broad causes and consequences of an earthquake, he is regarded as a forerunner of modern seismological scientists.

==Spanish invasion==
In 1761 Spain concluded an alliance with France by which Spain would enter the Seven Years&#x27; War in an effort to prevent British hegemony. The two countries saw Portugal as Britain&#x27;s closest ally, due to the Treaty of Windsor. As part of a wider plan to isolate and defeat Britain, Spanish and French envoys were sent to Lisbon to demand that the King and Pombal agree to cease all trade or co-operation with Britain or face war. While Pombal was keen to make Portugal less dependent on Britain, this was a long-term goal, and he and the King rejected the Bourbon ultimatum.

On 5 May 1762, Spain sent troops across the border and penetrated into Trás-os-Montes to capture Porto, but they were repelled by the guerrillas and forced to abandon all their conquests but Chaves, after suffering huge losses (10,000 casualties). Thereby the Spanish general, Nicolás de Carvajal, Marquis of Sarriá, soon lost the Spanish King&#x27;s confidence, and was replaced by Count of Aranda. 
In a second invasion (Province of Lower Beira, July 1762) a combined Franco-Spanish army was initially successful in capturing Almeida and several almost undefended fortresses, but they were soon ground to a halt by a small Anglo-Portuguese force entrenched in the hills East of Abrantes. Pombal had sent urgent messages to London requesting military assistance, consequently 7,104 British troops were sent together with William, Count of Schaumburg-Lippe and military staff to organise the Portuguese Army. 
Victory in the battles of Valencia de Alcántara and Vila Velha – and above all – a scorched earth tactic coupled with guerrilla actions in the Spanish logistic lines induced starvation and eventually the disintegration of the Franco-Spanish army (15,000 casualties, many of them inflicted by the peasants), whose remnants were driven back and pursued to Spain. The Spanish headquarters in Castelo Branco was taken by a Portuguese force under Townshend, and all the strongholds that had previously been occupied by the Bourbon invaders were retaken, with the exception of Almeida.

A third Spanish offensive in the Alentejo (November 1762) also met defeat in Ouguela, Marvão and Codiceira. The invaders were chased again back into Spain and saw several men captured by the advancing allies. According to a report sent to the British government by British ambassador in Portugal, Edward Hay, the Bourbon armies had suffered 30,000 casualties during their invasion of Portugal.

In the Treaty of Paris, Spain had to restore to Portugal Chaves and Almeida plus all the territory taken from Portugal in South America in 1763 (most of Rio Grande do Sul and Colonia do Sacramento). Only the second was given back, while the vast territory of Rio Grande do Sul (together with present-day Roraima) would be reconquered from Spain in the undeclared Hispano-Portuguese war of 1763–1777. However, Portugal also conquered Spanish territory in South America during the Seven Years&#x27; War: most of the Rio Negro Valley (1763) and defeated a Spanish invasion aiming to occupy the right bank of the Guaporé River (in Mato Grosso, 1763) and also in the battle of Santa Bárbara, Rio Grande do Sul (1 January 1763). Portugal was able to keep all these territorial gains.

In the years after the invasion, and despite the crucial British assistance, Pombal began to be increasingly concerned at the rise of British power. Despite being an Anglophile he suspected the British were interested in acquiring Brazil and he was alarmed by the seeming ease by which they had taken Havana and Manila from Spain in 1762. As noted by historian Andreas Leutzsch:
==Opposition to the Jesuits==

Having lived outside of Portugal in Vienna and London, the latter city in particular being a major centre of the Enlightenment, Pombal increasingly believed that the Society of Jesus, also known as the &quot;Jesuits&quot;, had a grip on science and education, and that they were an inherent drag on an independent, Portuguese-style &quot;iluminismo&quot;. He was especially familiar with the anti-Jesuit tradition of Britain, and in Vienna he had made friends with Gerhard van Swieten, a confidant of Maria Theresa of Austria and a staunch adversary of the Austrian Jesuits&#x27; influence. As prime minister Pombal engaged the Jesuits in a propaganda war, which was watched closely by the rest of Europe, and he launched a number of conspiracy theories regarding the order&#x27;s desire for power. During the Távora affair (see below) he accused the Society of Jesus of treason and attempted regicide, a major public relations catastrophe for the order, in the age of absolutism.

Historians today emphasise the Society&#x27;s role in trying to protect Native Americans in the Portuguese and Spanish colonies, and the fact that the limitations placed upon the order resulted in the so-called Guarani War in which the population of the Guarani people was halved by Spanish and Portuguese troops. According to a census conducted in 1756 the population of the Guarani from the seven missions was 14,284, which was about 15,000 less than the population in 1750. The former Jesuit missions were occupied by the Portuguese until 1759.

Pombal named his brother, D. Paulo António de Carvalho e Mendonça, chief inquisitor and used the inquisition against the Jesuits. Pombal was thus an important precursor for the suppression of the Jesuits throughout Europe and its colonies, which culminated in 1773, when European absolutists forced Pope Clement XIV to issue a bull empowering them to suppress the order in their domains.

== Expulsion of the Jesuits and consolidation of power ==

Following the earthquake, Joseph I gave his Prime Minister even more authority. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. On September 3, 1758, Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination when he was returning from a visit to his mistress, the young married Marchioness Teresa de Távora. On December 9, 1758, Pombal formed a special investigatory tribunal (its members were himself and the other secretaries of state). Approximately sixty individuals were convicted by the tribunal on January 12, 1759. 
Several nobles, including members of the Távora family and the Duke of Aveiro - who was generally regarded as the head of the conspiracy - were sentenced to death, while other nobles were sentenced to indefinite imprisonment. Death sentences were executed by breaking wheel, burning alive, strangling, and beheading. The brutality of the executions stirred controversy in Europe at the time.

In December 1760, the Marquis, who himself was a &quot;&quot;familiar&quot; do Santo Oficio&quot; (a lay officer of the Inquisition), denounced Father Gabriel Malagrida, a Jesuit, to the Inquisition on charges of heresy. He was sentenced to death. On 21 September 1761, Malagrida was strangled at the garrote in Rossio Square, then burned on a bonfire and the ashes were thrown into the Tagus river.

After the execution of the Távoras, the persecution of the nobility never stopped. When Pombal left power, around eight hundred political prisoners were released, but in the meantime around two thousand and four hundred had died in prison.

After Pombal had been removed from power by Maria I, an inquiry in the Tavora trial endorsed the guilty verdict of the Duke of Aveiro but exonerated the Tavora family.

There were long-standing tensions between the Portuguese crown and the Jesuits, so that the Távora affair could be considered a pretext for the climax to the conflict that resulted in the Jesuits’ expulsion from Portugal and its empire in 1759. Jesuit assets were confiscated by the crown. According to historians James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, the Jesuits&#x27; &quot;independence, power, wealth, control of education, and ties to Rome made the Jesuits obvious targets for Pombal&#x27;s brand of extreme regalism.&quot; Pombal showed no mercy, prosecuting every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy and ensured the Prime Minister&#x27;s victory against his enemies. In reward for his swift resolve, Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of Oeiras in 1759. Following the Távora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Having become the Marquis of Pombal in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I&#x27;s death in 1777.

In 1771, botanist Domenico Vandelli published &quot;Pombalia&quot;, a genus of flowering plants from America, belonging to the family Violaceae and named in honour of the &quot;Marquis of Pombal&quot;.

=== Trafaria and Monte Gordo fires and other episodes ===
In January of 1777, the village of Trafaria was deliberately and completely burned down, with the purpose of capturing rebels who were taking refuge there, with many people dying, either by the fire, or killed by Pina Manique&#x27;s troops who surrounded the exits .

Pombal ordered the fire of the huts in Monte Gordo aiming to transfer the fishermen to Vila Real de Santo António, where many of those who escaped preferred to later settle in Spain, in Higuerita (Isla Cristina).

In 1757, a popular revolt against the &quot;Companhia Geral de Agricultura dos Vinhos do Alto Douro&quot;, which had raised the price of wine in the taverns it had a monopoly over, was fiercely repressed by the Marquis. In his own words, &quot;the whole Portuguese nation is horrified by the slightest movement that might appear to be unfaithful to its sovereign&quot;. As a result, the city of Porto was occupied by thousands of soldiers, summary trials were carried out and around thirty people were hanged, including several women. The gallows with their corpses were placed in various parts of the city, and later, the heads of the executed were stuck on poles at the entrance to the city.

==Decline and death==

King Joseph&#x27;s daughter and successor, Queen Maria I of Portugal, loathed Pombal. After acceding to the throne, Maria forced Pombal from office.

She also issued one of history&#x27;s first restraining orders, commanding that Pombal not be closer than 20 miles to her presence. If she were to travel near his estates, he was compelled to remove himself from his house to fulfill the royal decree. The slightest reference to Pombal in her presence was said to have induced fits of rage in the Queen.

Pombal&#x27;s removal was the cause of much rejoicing and disorder in the streets. The Marquis took refuge first in Oeiras and then in his estate near Pombal. The crowd tried to burn down his house in Lisbon, which had to be protected by the troops. Almost all of his former allies abandoned him.

Pombal built a palace in Oeiras, designed by Carlos Mardel. The palace featured formal French gardens enlivened with traditional Portuguese glazed tile walls. There were waterfalls and waterworks set within vineyards.

Pombal died of leprosy on his estate at Pombal in 1782. He was a controversial figure in his own era as it is today; today one of Lisbon&#x27;s busiest squares and the busiest underground station is named &quot;Marquês de Pombal&quot; in his honour. There is an imposing statue of the Marquis depicting a lion next to him in the square, symbolising the merits of despotic power. This was the first public statue inaugurated by the Military Dictatorship of 1934, based on early projects by one of Pombal&#x27;s descendants who was mayor of Lisbon. Several intellectuals of the time, such as Almada Negreiros, expressed their dismay and asked this statue to be removed, but it became an important symbol for the Dictatorship and later for the Portuguese Estado Novo.

João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha was his grandson.

<text>In the theory of computation, a Moore machine is a finite-state machine whose current output values are determined only by its current state. This is in contrast to a Mealy machine, whose output values are determined both by its current state and by the values of its inputs. Like other finite state machines, in Moore machines, the input typically influences the next state. Thus the input may indirectly influence subsequent outputs, but not the current or immediate output. The Moore machine is named after Edward F. Moore, who presented the concept in a 1956 paper, “Gedanken-experiments on Sequential Machines.”

== Formal definition ==

A Moore machine can be defined as a 6-tuple formula_1 consisting of the following:
* A finite set of states formula_2
* A start state (also called initial state) formula_3 which is an element of formula_2
* A finite set called the input alphabet formula_5
* A finite set called the output alphabet formula_6
* A transition function formula_7 mapping a state and the input alphabet to the next state
* An output function formula_8 mapping each state to the output alphabet

&quot;Evolution across time&quot; is realized in this abstraction by having the state machine consult the time-changing input symbol at discrete &quot;timer ticks&quot; formula_9 and react according to its internal configuration at those idealized instants, or else having the state machine wait for a next input symbol (as on a FIFO) and react whenever it arrives.

A Moore machine can be regarded as a restricted type of finite-state transducer.

==Visual representation==

===Table===
A state transition table is a table listing all the triples in the transition relation formula_7.

===Diagram===
The state diagram for a Moore machine, or Moore diagram, is a state diagram that associates an output value with each state.

==Relationship with Mealy machines==
As Moore and Mealy machines are both types of finite-state machines, they are equally expressive: either type can be used to parse a regular language.

The difference between Moore machines and Mealy machines is that in the latter, the output of a transition is determined by the combination of current state and current input (formula_11 as the domain of formula_12), as opposed to just the current state (formula_2 as the domain of formula_12). When represented as a state diagram,
* for a Moore machine, each node (state) is labeled with an output value;
* for a Mealy machine, each arc (transition) is labeled with an output value.

Every Moore machine formula_15 is equivalent to the Mealy machine with the same states and transitions and the output function formula_16, which takes each state-input pair formula_17 and yields formula_18, where formula_19 is formula_15&#x27;s output function and formula_21 is formula_15&#x27;s transition function.

However, not every Mealy machine can be converted to an equivalent Moore machine. Some can be converted only to an &quot;almost&quot; equivalent Moore machine, with outputs shifted in time. This is due to the way that state labels are paired with transition labels to form the input/output pairs. Consider a transition formula_23 from state formula_24 to state formula_25. The input causing the transition formula_23 labels the edge formula_27. The output corresponding to that input, is the label of state formula_24. Notice that this is the source state of the transition. So for each input, the output is already fixed before the input is received, and depends solely on the present state. This is the original definition by E. Moore. It is a common mistake to use the label of state formula_25 as output for the transition formula_23.

==Examples==
Types according to number of inputs/outputs.

===Simple===

Simple Moore machines have one input and one output:
* edge detector using XOR
* clocked sequential systems (a restricted form of Moore machine where the state changes only when the global clock signal changes)

Most digital electronic systems are designed as clocked sequential systems. Clocked sequential systems are a restricted form of Moore machine where the state changes only when the global clock signal changes. Typically the current state is stored in flip-flops, and a global clock signal is connected to the &quot;clock&quot; input of the flip-flops. Clocked sequential systems are one way to solve metastability problems. A typical electronic Moore machine includes a combinational logic chain to decode the current state into the outputs (lambda). The instant the current state changes, those changes ripple through that chain, and almost instantaneously the output gets updated. There are design techniques to ensure that no glitches occur on the outputs during that brief period while those changes are rippling through the chain, but most systems are designed so that glitches during that brief transition time are ignored or are irrelevant. The outputs then stay the same indefinitely (LEDs stay bright, power stays connected to the motors, solenoids stay energized, etc.), until the Moore machine changes state again.

====Worked Example====
A sequential network has one input and one output. The output becomes 1 and remains 1 thereafter when at least two 0&#x27;s and two 1&#x27;s have occurred as inputs.

A Moore machine with nine states for the above description is shown on the right. The initial state is state A, and the final state is state I. The state table for this example is as follows:
===Complex===
More complex Moore machines can have multiple inputs as well as multiple outputs.

== Gedanken-experiments ==

In Moore&#x27;s 1956 paper &quot;Gedanken-experiments on Sequential Machines&quot;, the formula_31 automata (or machines) formula_2 are defined as having formula_33 states, formula_34 input symbols and formula_35 output symbols. Nine theorems are proved about the structure of formula_2, and experiments with formula_2. Later, &quot;formula_2 machines&quot; became known as &quot;Moore machines&quot;.

At the end of the paper, in Section &quot;Further problems&quot;, the following task is stated:
Another directly following problem is the improvement of the bounds given at the theorems 8 and 9.

Moore&#x27;s Theorem 8 is formulated as:
Given an arbitrary formula_31 machine formula_2, such that every two of its states are distinguishable from one another, then there exists an experiment of length formula_41 which determines the state of formula_2 at the end of the experiment.

In 1957, A. A. Karatsuba proved the following two theorems, which completely solved Moore&#x27;s problem on the improvement of the bounds of the experiment length of his &quot;Theorem 8&quot;.

Theorem A. If formula_2 is an formula_31 machine, such that every two of its states are distinguishable from one another, then there exists a branched experiment of length at most formula_45 through which one may determine the state of formula_2 at the end of the experiment.

Theorem B. There exists an formula_31 machine, every two states of which are distinguishable from one another, such that the length of the shortest experiments establishing the state of the machine at the end of the experiment is equal to formula_45.

Theorems A and B were used for the basis of the course work of a student of the fourth year, A. A. Karatsuba, &quot;On a problem from the automata theory&quot;, which was distinguished by testimonial reference at the competition of student works of the faculty of mechanics and mathematics of Moscow State University in 1958. The paper by Karatsuba was given to the journal &quot;Uspekhi Mat. Nauk&quot; on 17 December 1958 and was published there in June 1960.

Until the present day (2011), Karatsuba&#x27;s result on the length of experiments is the only exact nonlinear result, both in automata theory, and in similar problems of computational complexity theory.

<doc id="353021" wikidata="Q584521" url="?curid=353021" title="Homeomorphism (graph theory)">
<text>In graph theory, two graphs formula_1 and formula_2 are homeomorphic if there is a graph isomorphism from some subdivision of formula_1 to some subdivision of formula_2. If the edges of a graph are thought of as lines drawn from one vertex to another (as they are usually depicted in diagrams), then two graphs are homeomorphic to each other in the graph-theoretic sense precisely if their diagrams are homeomorphic in the topological sense.

==Subdivision and smoothing ==
In general, a subdivision of a graph &quot;G&quot; (sometimes known as an expansion) is a graph resulting from the subdivision of edges in &quot;G&quot;. The subdivision of some edge &quot;e&quot; with endpoints {&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;&amp;hairsp;} yields a graph containing one new vertex &quot;w&quot;, and with an edge set replacing &quot;e&quot; by two new edges, {&quot;u&quot;,&quot;w&quot;&amp;hairsp;} and {&quot;w&quot;,&quot;v&quot;&amp;hairsp;}. For directed edges, this operation shall reserve their propagating direction.

For example, the edge &quot;e&quot;, with endpoints {&quot;u&quot;,&quot;v&quot;&amp;hairsp;}:

can be subdivided into two edges, &quot;e&quot;1 and &quot;e&quot;2, connecting to a new vertex &quot;w&quot; of degree-2, or indegree-1 and outdegree-1 for the directed edge:

Determining whether for graphs &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;, &quot;H&quot; is homeomorphic to a subgraph of &quot;G&quot;, is an NP-complete problem.

===Reversion===
The reverse operation, smoothing out or smoothing a vertex &quot;w&quot; with regards to the pair of edges (&quot;e&quot;1, &quot;e&quot;2) incident on &quot;w&quot;, removes both edges containing &quot;w&quot; and replaces (&quot;e&quot;1, &quot;e&quot;2) with a new edge that connects the other endpoints of the pair. Here, it is emphasized that only degree-2 (i.e., 2-valent) vertices can be smoothed. The limit of this operation is realized by the graph that has no more degree-2 vertices.

For example, the simple connected graph with two edges, &quot;e&quot;1 {&quot;u&quot;,&quot;w&quot;&amp;hairsp;} and &quot;e&quot;2 {&quot;w&quot;,&quot;v&quot;&amp;hairsp;}: 

has a vertex (namely &quot;w&quot;) that can be smoothed away, resulting in:

===Barycentric subdivisions===

The barycentric subdivision subdivides each edge of the graph. This is a special subdivision, as it always results in a bipartite graph. This procedure can be repeated, so that the &quot;n&quot;th barycentric subdivision is the barycentric subdivision of the &quot;n&quot;−1st barycentric subdivision of the graph. The second such subdivision is always a simple graph.

==Embedding on a surface==
It is evident that subdividing a graph preserves planarity. Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem states that 
: a finite graph is planar if and only if it contains no subgraph homeomorphic to &quot;K&quot;5 (complete graph on five vertices) or &quot;K&quot;3,3 (complete bipartite graph on six vertices, three of which connect to each of the other three).

In fact, a graph homeomorphic to &quot;K&quot;5 or &quot;K&quot;3,3 is called a Kuratowski subgraph.

A generalization, following from the Robertson–Seymour theorem, asserts that for each integer &quot;g&quot;, there is a finite obstruction set of graphs formula_5 such that a graph &quot;H&quot; is embeddable on a surface of genus &quot;g&quot; if and only if &quot;H&quot; contains no homeomorphic copy of any of the formula_6. For example, formula_7 consists of the Kuratowski subgraphs.

==Example==
In the following example, graph &quot;G&quot; and graph &quot;H&quot; are homeomorphic.

If &quot;G′&quot; is the graph created by subdivision of the outer edges of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H′&quot; is the graph created by subdivision of the inner edge of &quot;H&quot;, then &quot;G′&quot; and &quot;H′&quot; have a similar graph drawing:

Therefore, there exists an isomorphism between &quot;G&#x27;&quot; and &quot;H&#x27;&quot;, meaning &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; are homeomorphic.

===mixed graph===
The following mixed graphs are homeomorphic. The directed edges are shown to have an intermediate arrow head.

<doc id="353022" wikidata="Q189061" url="?curid=353022" title="CW complex">
<text>In mathematics, and specifically in topology, a CW complex (also cellular complex or cell complex) is a topological space that is built by gluing together topological balls (so-called &quot;cells&quot;) of different dimensions in specific ways. It generalizes both manifolds and simplicial complexes and has particular significance for algebraic topology. It was initially introduced by J. H. C. Whitehead to meet the needs of homotopy theory.
CW complexes have better categorical properties than simplicial complexes, but still retain a combinatorial nature that allows for computation (often with a much smaller complex). 

The C in CW stands for &quot;closure-finite&quot;, and the W for &quot;weak&quot; topology.

==Definition==

=== CW complex ===
A CW complex is constructed by taking the union of a sequence of topological spaces formula_1 such that each formula_2 is obtained from formula_3 by gluing copies of k-cells formula_4, each homeomorphic to the open formula_5-ball formula_6, to formula_3 by continuous gluing maps formula_8. The maps are also called attaching maps. Thus as a set, formula_9.

Each formula_2 is called the k-skeleton of the complex.

The topology of formula_11 is weak topology: a subset formula_12 is open iff formula_13 is open for each k-skeleton formula_2.

In the language of category theory, the topology on formula_15 is the direct limit of the diagram formula_16The name &quot;CW&quot; stands for &quot;closure-finite weak topology&quot;, which is explained by the following theorem:

This partition of &quot;X&quot; is also called a cellulation.

==== The construction, in words ====
The CW complex construction is a straightforward generalization of the following process:
* A 0-&quot;dimensional CW complex&quot; is just a set of zero or more discrete points (with the discrete topology).
* A 1-&quot;dimensional CW complex&quot; is constructed by taking the disjoint union of a 0-dimensional CW complex with one or more copies of the unit interval. For each copy, there is a map that &quot;glues&quot; its boundary (its two endpoints) to elements of the 0-dimensional complex (the points). The topology of the CW complex is the topology of the quotient space defined by these gluing maps.
* In general, an &quot;n-dimensional CW complex&quot; is constructed by taking the disjoint union of a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional CW complex (for some formula_17) with one or more copies of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional ball. For each copy, there is a map that &quot;glues&quot; its boundary (the formula_18-dimensional sphere) to elements of the formula_5-dimensional complex. The topology of the CW complex is the quotient topology defined by these gluing maps.
* An &quot;infinite-dimensional CW complex&quot; can be constructed by repeating the above process countably many times. Since the topology of the union formula_20 is indeterminate, one takes the direct limit topology, since the diagram is highly suggestive of a direct limit. This turns out to have great technical benefits.

===Regular CW complexes===
A regular CW complex is a CW complex whose gluing maps are homeomorphisms. Accordingly, the partition of &quot;X&quot; is also called a regular cellulation.

A loopless graph is represented by a regular 1-dimensional CW-complex. A closed 2-cell graph embedding on a surface is a regular 2-dimensional CW-complex. Finally, the 3-sphere regular cellulation conjecture claims that every 2-connected graph is the 1-skeleton of a regular CW-complex on the 3-dimensional sphere.

===Relative CW complexes===
Roughly speaking, a &quot;relative CW complex&quot; differs from a CW complex in that we allow it to have one extra building block that does not necessarily possess a cellular structure. This extra-block can be treated as a (-1)-dimensional cell in the former definition.

== Examples ==

=== 0-dimensional CW complexes ===
Every discrete topological space is a 0-dimensional CW complex.

=== 1-dimensional CW complexes ===
Some examples of 1-dimensional CW complexes are:

* An interval. It can be constructed from two points (&quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;), and the 1-dimensional ball &quot;B&quot; (an interval), such that one endpoint of &quot;B&quot; is glued to &quot;x&quot; and the other is glued to &quot;y&quot;. The two points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are the 0-cells; the interior of &quot;B&quot; is the 1-cell. Alternatively, it can be constructed just from a single interval, with no 0-cells.
* A circle. It can be constructed from a single point &quot;x&quot; and the 1-dimensional ball &quot;B&quot;, such that &quot;both&quot; endpoints of &quot;B&quot; are glued to &quot;x&quot;. Alternatively, it can be constructed from two points &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; and two 1-dimensional balls &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, such that the endpoints of &quot;A&quot; are glued to &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;, and the endpoints of &quot;B&quot; are glued to &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; too.
* A graph. Given a graph, a 1-dimensional CW complex can be constructed in which the 0-cells are the vertices and the 1-cells are the edges of the graph. The endpoints of each edge are identified with the incident vertices to it. This realization of a combinatorial graph as a topological space is sometimes called a topological graph.
**3-regular graphs can be considered as &quot;generic&quot; 1-dimensional CW complexes. Specifically, if &quot;X&quot; is a 1-dimensional CW complex, the attaching map for a 1-cell is a map from a two-point space to &quot;X&quot;, formula_21. This map can be perturbed to be disjoint from the 0-skeleton of &quot;X&quot; if and only if formula_22 and formula_23 are not 0-valence vertices of &quot;X&quot;.
* The &quot;standard CW structure&quot; on the real numbers has as 0-skeleton the integers formula_24 and as 1-cells the intervals formula_25. Similarly, the standard CW structure on formula_26 has cubical cells that are products of the 0 and 1-cells from formula_27. This is the standard &quot;cubic lattice&quot; cell structure on formula_26.

=== Finite-dimensional CW complexes ===
Some examples of finite-dimensional CW complexes are:
* An &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere. It admits a CW structure with two cells, one 0-cell and one n-cell. Here the n-cell formula_29 is attached by the constant mapping from its boundary formula_30 to the single 0-cell. An alternative cell decomposition has one (&quot;n&quot;-1)-dimensional sphere (the &quot;equator&quot;) and two &quot;n&quot;-cells that are attached to it (the &quot;upper hemi-sphere&quot; and the &quot;lower hemi-sphere&quot;). Inductively, this gives formula_31 a CW decomposition with two cells in every dimension k such that formula_32.
* The &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real projective space. It admits a CW structure with one cell in each dimension.
* The terminology for a generic 2-dimensional CW complex is a shadow.
* A polyhedron is naturally a CW complex.
*Grassmannian manifolds admit a CW structure called Schubert cells.
*Differentiable manifolds, algebraic and projective varieties have the homotopy type of CW complexes.
* The one-point compactification of a cusped hyperbolic manifold has a canonical CW decomposition with only one 0-cell (the compactification point) called the Epstein–Penner Decomposition. Such cell decompositions are frequently called ideal polyhedral decompositions and are used in popular computer software, such as SnapPea.

=== Infinite-dimensional CW complexes ===

* The infinite dimensional sphere formula_33. It admits a CW-structure with 2 cells in each dimension which are assembled in a way such that the formula_34-skeleton is precisely given by the formula_34-sphere.
* The infinite dimensional projective spaces formula_36, formula_37 and formula_38. formula_36 has one cell in every dimension, formula_37, has one cell in every even dimension and formula_38 has one cell in every dimension divisible by 4. The respective skeletons are then given by formula_42, formula_43 (2n-skeleton) and formula_44 (4n-skeleton).

=== Non CW-complexes ===

* An infinite-dimensional Hilbert space is not a CW complex: it is a Baire space and therefore cannot be written as a countable union of &quot;n&quot;-skeletons, each of which being a closed set with empty interior. This argument extends to many other infinite-dimensional spaces.
* The hedgehog space formula_45 is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex (the point) but it does not admit a CW decomposition, since it is not locally contractible.
* The Hawaiian earring has no CW decomposition, because it is not locally contractible at origin. It is also not homotopy equivalent to a CW complex, because it has no good open cover.

== Properties ==
* CW complexes are locally contractible.
* If a space is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex, then it has a good open cover. A good open cover is an open cover, such that every nonempty finite intersection is contractible.
* CW complexes are paracompact. Finite CW complexes are compact. A compact subspace of a CW complex is always contained in a finite subcomplex.
* CW complexes satisfy the Whitehead theorem: a map between CW complexes is a homotopy equivalence if and only if it induces an isomorphism on all homotopy groups.
* A covering space of a CW complex is also a CW complex.
* The product of two CW complexes can be made into a CW complex. Specifically, if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are CW complexes, then one can form a CW complex &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; in which each cell is a product of a cell in &quot;X&quot; and a cell in &quot;Y&quot;, endowed with the weak topology. The underlying set of &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; is then the Cartesian product of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, as expected. In addition, the weak topology on this set often agrees with the more familiar product topology on &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot;, for example if either &quot;X&quot; or &quot;Y&quot; is finite. However, the weak topology can be finer than the product topology, for example if neither &quot;X&quot; nor &quot;Y&quot; is locally compact. In this unfavorable case, the product &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; in the product topology is &quot;not&quot; a CW complex. On the other hand, the product of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; in the category of compactly generated spaces agrees with the weak topology and therefore defines a CW complex.
* Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be CW complexes. Then the function spaces Hom(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) (with the compact-open topology) are &quot;not&quot; CW complexes in general. If &quot;X&quot; is finite then Hom(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex by a theorem of John Milnor (1959). Note that &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are compactly generated Hausdorff spaces, so Hom(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;) is often taken with the compactly generated variant of the compact-open topology; the above statements remain true.
* Cellular approximation theorem

==Homology and cohomology of CW complexes==

Singular homology and cohomology of CW complexes is readily computable via cellular homology. Moreover, in the category of CW complexes and cellular maps, cellular homology can be interpreted as a homology theory. To compute an extraordinary (co)homology theory for a CW complex, the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence is the analogue of cellular homology.

Some examples:

* For the sphere, formula_46 take the cell decomposition with two cells: a single 0-cell and a single &quot;n&quot;-cell. The cellular homology chain complex formula_47 and homology are given by:
::formula_48 
:since all the differentials are zero.

:Alternatively, if we use the equatorial decomposition with two cells in every dimension 
::formula_49 
:and the differentials are matrices of the form formula_50 This gives the same homology computation above, as the chain complex is exact at all terms except formula_51 and formula_52

* For formula_53 we get similarly
::formula_54

Both of the above examples are particularly simple because the homology is determined by the number of cells—i.e.: the cellular attaching maps have no role in these computations. This is a very special phenomenon and is not indicative of the general case.

== Modification of CW structures ==

There is a technique, developed by Whitehead, for replacing a CW complex with a homotopy-equivalent CW complex that has a &quot;simpler&quot; CW decomposition.

Consider, for example, an arbitrary CW complex. Its 1-skeleton can be fairly complicated, being an arbitrary graph. Now consider a maximal forest &quot;F&quot; in this graph. Since it is a collection of trees, and trees are contractible, consider the space formula_55 where the equivalence relation is generated by formula_56 if they are contained in a common tree in the maximal forest &quot;F&quot;. The quotient map formula_57 is a homotopy equivalence. Moreover, formula_55 naturally inherits a CW structure, with cells corresponding to the cells of formula_15 that are not contained in &quot;F&quot;. In particular, the 1-skeleton of formula_55 is a disjoint union of wedges of circles.

Another way of stating the above is that a connected CW complex can be replaced by a homotopy-equivalent CW complex whose 0-skeleton consists of a single point.

Consider climbing up the connectivity ladder—assume &quot;X&quot; is a simply-connected CW complex whose 0-skeleton consists of a point. Can we, through suitable modifications, replace &quot;X&quot; by a homotopy-equivalent CW complex where formula_61 consists of a single point? The answer is yes. The first step is to observe that formula_61 and the attaching maps to construct formula_63 from formula_61 form a group presentation. The Tietze theorem for group presentations states that there is a sequence of moves we can perform to reduce this group presentation to the trivial presentation of the trivial group. There are two Tietze moves:

: 1) Adding/removing a generator. Adding a generator, from the perspective of the CW decomposition consists of adding a 1-cell and a 2-cell whose attaching map consists of the new 1-cell and the remainder of the attaching map is in formula_61. If we let formula_66 be the corresponding CW complex formula_67 then there is a homotopy equivalence formula_68 given by sliding the new 2-cell into &quot;X&quot;.

: 2) Adding/removing a relation. The act of adding a relation is similar, only one is replacing &quot;X&quot; by formula_69 where the new &quot;3&quot;-cell has an attaching map that consists of the new 2-cell and remainder mapping into formula_63. A similar slide gives a homotopy-equivalence formula_68.

If a CW complex &quot;X&quot; is &quot;n&quot;-connected one can find a homotopy-equivalent CW complex formula_66 whose &quot;n&quot;-skeleton formula_73 consists of a single point. The argument for formula_74 is similar to the formula_75 case, only one replaces Tietze moves for the fundamental group presentation by elementary matrix operations for the presentation matrices for formula_76 (using the presentation matrices coming from cellular homology. i.e.: one can similarly realize elementary matrix operations by a sequence of addition/removal of cells or suitable homotopies of the attaching maps.

==&#x27;The&#x27; homotopy category==

The homotopy category of CW complexes is, in the opinion of some experts, the best if not the only candidate for &quot;the&quot; homotopy category (for technical reasons the version for pointed spaces is actually used). Auxiliary constructions that yield spaces that are not CW complexes must be used on occasion. One basic result is that the representable functors on the homotopy category have a simple characterisation (the Brown representability theorem).
