<text>Mary Anning (21 May 1799 – 9 March 1847) was an English fossil collector, dealer, and palaeontologist. She became known internationally for her discoveries in Jurassic marine fossil beds in the cliffs along the English Channel at Lyme Regis in the county of Dorset, Southwest England. Anning&#x27;s findings contributed to changes in scientific thinking about prehistoric life and the history of the Earth.

Anning searched for fossils in the area&#x27;s Blue Lias and Charmouth Mudstone cliffs, particularly during the winter months when landslides exposed new fossils that had to be collected quickly before they were lost to the sea. Her discoveries included the first correctly identified ichthyosaur skeleton when she was twelve years old; the first two nearly complete plesiosaur skeletons; the first pterosaur skeleton located outside Germany; and fish fossils. Her observations played a key role in the discovery that coprolites, known as bezoar stones at the time, were fossilised faeces, and she also discovered that belemnite fossils contained fossilised ink sacs like those of modern cephalopods.

Anning struggled financially for much of her life. As a woman, she was not eligible to join the Geological Society of London, and she did not always receive full credit for her scientific contributions. However, her friend, geologist Henry De la Beche, who painted &quot;Duria Antiquior&quot;, the first widely circulated pictorial representation of a scene from prehistoric life derived from fossil reconstructions, based it largely on fossils Anning had found and sold prints of it for her benefit.

Anning became well known in geological circles in Britain, Europe, and America, and was consulted on issues of anatomy as well as fossil collecting. The only scientific writing of hers published in her lifetime appeared in the &quot;Magazine of Natural History&quot; in 1839, an extract from a letter that Anning had written to the magazine&#x27;s editor questioning one of its claims. After her death in 1847, Anning&#x27;s unusual life story attracted increasing interest.

== Life and career ==

=== Early childhood ===

Mary Anning was born in Lyme Regis in Dorset, England, on 21 May 1799. Her father, Richard Anning (&quot;c&quot;. 1766–1810), was a cabinetmaker and carpenter who supplemented his income by mining the coastal cliff-side fossil beds near the town, and selling his finds to tourists; her mother was Mary Moore (&quot;c&quot;. 1764–1842) known as Molly. Anning&#x27;s parents married on 8 August 1793 in Blandford Forum and moved to Lyme, living in a house built on the town&#x27;s bridge. They attended the Dissenter chapel on Coombe Street, whose worshippers initially called themselves independents and later became known as Congregationalists. Shelley Emling writes that the family lived so near to the sea that the same storms that swept along the cliffs to reveal the fossils sometimes flooded the Annings&#x27; home, on one occasion forcing them to crawl out of an upstairs bedroom window to avoid drowning.

Molly and Richard had ten children. The first child, also Mary, was born in 1794. She was followed by another daughter, who died almost at once; Joseph in 1796; and another son in 1798, who died in infancy. In December that year, the oldest child, (the first Mary) then four years old, died after her clothes caught fire, possibly while adding wood shavings to the fire. The incident was reported in the &quot;Bath Chronicle&quot; on 27 December 1798: &quot;A child, four years of age of Mr. R. Anning, a cabinetmaker of Lyme, was left by the mother for about five minutes ... in a room where there were some shavings ... The girl&#x27;s clothes caught fire and she was so dreadfully burnt as to cause her death.&quot;

When Anning was born five months later, she was thus named Mary after her dead sister. More children were born after her, but none of them survived more than a year or two. Only the second Mary Anning and her brother Joseph, who was three years older than her, survived to adulthood. The high child mortality rate for the Anning family was not unusual. Almost half the children born in the UK in the 19th century died before the age of five, and in the crowded living conditions of early 19th-century Lyme Regis, infant deaths from diseases like smallpox and measles were common.

On 19 August 1800, when Anning was 15 months old, an event occurred that became part of local lore. She was being held by a neighbour, Elizabeth Haskings, who was standing with two other women under an elm tree watching an equestrian show being put on by a travelling company of horsemen when lightning struck the tree—killing all three women below. Onlookers rushed the infant home, where she was revived in a bath of hot water. A local doctor declared her survival miraculous. Anning&#x27;s family said she had been a sickly baby before the event, but afterwards she seemed to blossom. For years afterwards, members of her community would attribute the child&#x27;s curiosity, intelligence and lively personality to the incident.

Anning&#x27;s education was extremely limited, but she was able to attend a Congregationalist Sunday school, where she learned to read and write. Congregationalist doctrine, unlike that of the Church of England at the time, emphasised the importance of education for the poor. Her prized possession was a bound volume of the &quot;Dissenters&#x27; Theological Magazine and Review&quot;, in which the family&#x27;s pastor, the Reverend James Wheaton, had published two essays, one insisting that God had created the world in six days, the other urging dissenters to study the new science of geology.

=== Fossils as a family business ===


By the late 18th century, Lyme Regis had become a popular seaside resort, especially after 1792 when the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars made travel to the European mainland dangerous for the English gentry, and increasing numbers of wealthy and middle-class tourists were arriving there. Even before Anning&#x27;s time, locals supplemented their income by selling what were called &quot;curios&quot; to visitors. These were fossils with colourful local names such as &quot;snake-stones&quot; (ammonites), &quot;devil&#x27;s fingers&quot; (belemnites), and &quot;verteberries&quot; (vertebrae), to which were sometimes attributed medicinal and mystical properties. Fossil collecting was in vogue in the late 18th and early 19th century, at first as a pastime, but gradually transforming into a science as the importance of fossils to geology and biology was understood. The source of most of these fossils were the coastal cliffs around Lyme Regis, part of a geological formation known as the Blue Lias. This consists of alternating layers of limestone and shale, laid down as sediment on a shallow seabed early in the Jurassic period (about 210–195 million years ago). It is one of the richest fossil locations in Britain. The cliffs could be dangerously unstable, however, especially in winter when rain weakened them, causing landslides. It was precisely during the winter months that collectors were drawn to the cliffs because the landslides often exposed new fossils.

Their father, Richard, often took Anning and her brother Joseph on fossil-hunting expeditions to supplement the family&#x27;s income. They offered their discoveries for sale to tourists on a table outside their home. This was a difficult time for England&#x27;s poor; the French Revolutionary Wars, and the Napoleonic Wars that followed, caused food shortages. The price of wheat almost tripled between 1792 and 1812, but wages for the working class remained almost unchanged. In Dorset, the rising price of bread caused political unrest, even riots. At one point, Richard Anning was involved in organising a protest against food shortages.

In addition, the family&#x27;s status as religious dissenters—not followers of the Church of England—attracted discrimination. In the earlier nineteenth century, those who refused to subscribe to the Articles of the Church of England were still not allowed to study at Oxford or Cambridge or to take certain positions in the army, and were excluded by law from several professions. Anning&#x27;s father had been suffering from tuberculosis and injuries he suffered from a fall off a cliff, contributing to his death in November 1810 (aged 44). He left the family with debts and no savings, forcing them to apply for poor relief.

The family continued collecting and selling fossils together and set up a table of curiosities near the coach stop at a local inn. Although the stories about Anning tend to focus on her successes, Dennis Dean writes that her mother and brother were astute collectors too, and Anning&#x27;s parents had sold fossils before the father&#x27;s death.

Their first well-known find was in 1811 when Mary Anning was 12; her brother Joseph dug up a 4-foot ichthyosaur skull, and a few months later Anning herself found the rest of the skeleton. Henry Hoste Henley of Sandringham House in Sandringham, Norfolk, who was lord of the manor of Colway, near Lyme Regis, paid the family about £23 for it, and in turn he sold it to William Bullock, a well-known collector, who displayed it in London. There it generated interest, as public awareness of the age of the Earth and the variety of prehistoric creatures was growing. It was later sold for £45 and five shillings at auction in May 1819 as a &quot;Crocodile in a Fossil State&quot; to Charles Konig, of the British Museum, who had already suggested the name &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot; for it.

Anning&#x27;s mother Molly initially ran the fossil business after her husband Richard&#x27;s death, but it is unclear how much actual fossil collecting Molly did herself. As late as 1821, Molly wrote to the British Museum to request payment for a specimen. Her son Joseph&#x27;s time was increasingly taken up by his apprenticeship to an upholsterer, but he remained active in the fossil business until at least 1825. By that time, Mary Anning had assumed the leading role in the family specimen business.

=== Birch auction ===
The family&#x27;s keenest customer was Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch, later Bosvile, a wealthy collector from Lincolnshire, who bought several specimens from them. In 1820 Birch became disturbed by the family&#x27;s poverty. Having made no major discoveries for a year, they were at the point of having to sell their furniture to pay the rent. So he decided to auction on their behalf the fossils he had purchased from them. He wrote to the palaeontologist Gideon Mantell on 5 March that year to say that the sale was &quot;for the benefit of the poor woman and her son and daughter at Lyme, who have in truth found almost &quot;all&quot; the fine things which have been submitted to scientific investigation ... I may never again possess what I am about to part with, yet in doing it I shall have the satisfaction of knowing that the money will be well applied.&quot; The auction was held at Bullocks in London on 15 May 1820, and raised £400 (the equivalent of £ in 2025). How much of that was given to the Annings is not known, but it seems to have placed the family on a steadier financial footing, and with buyers arriving from Paris and Vienna, the three-day event raised the family&#x27;s profile within the geological community.

=== Fossil shop and growing expertise in a risky occupation ===
Anning continued to support herself selling fossils. Her primary stock in trade consisted of invertebrate fossils such as ammonite and belemnite shells, which were common in the area and sold for a few shillings. Vertebrate fossils, such as ichthyosaur skeletons, sold for more, but were much rarer. Collecting them was dangerous winter work. In 1823, an article in &quot;The Bristol Mirror&quot; said of her:

The risks of Anning&#x27;s profession were illustrated when in October 1833 she barely avoided being killed by a landslide that buried her black-and-white terrier, Tray, her constant companion when she went collecting. Anning wrote to a friend, Charlotte Murchison, in November of that year: &quot;Perhaps you will laugh when I say that the death of my old faithful dog has quite upset me, the cliff that fell upon him and killed him in a moment before my eyes, and close to my feet ... it was but a moment between me and the same fate.&quot;

As Anning continued to make important finds, her reputation grew. On 10 December 1823, she found the first complete &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot;, and in 1828 the first British example of the flying reptiles known as pterosaurs, called a flying dragon when it was displayed at the British Museum, followed by a &quot;Squaloraja&quot; fish skeleton in 1829. Despite her limited education, she read as much of the scientific literature as she could obtain, and often laboriously hand-copied papers borrowed from others. Palaeontologist Christopher McGowan examined a copy Anning made of an 1824 paper by William Conybeare on marine reptile fossils and noted that the copy included several pages of her detailed technical illustrations that he was hard-pressed to tell apart from the original. She also dissected modern animals including both fish and cuttlefish to gain a better understanding of the anatomy of some of the fossils with which she was working. Lady Harriet Silvester, the widow of the former Recorder of the City of London, visited Lyme in 1824 and described Anning in her diary:


In 1826, aged 27, Anning managed to save enough money to purchase a house with a glass store-front window for her shop, &quot;Anning&#x27;s Fossil Depot&quot;. The business had become important enough that the move was covered in the local paper, which noted that the shop had a fine ichthyosaur skeleton on display. Many geologists and fossil collectors from Europe and America visited her at Lyme, including the geologist George William Featherstonhaugh, who called Anning a &quot;very clever funny Creature.&quot; He purchased fossils from Anning for the newly opened New York Lyceum of Natural History in 1827. King Frederick Augustus II of Saxony visited her shop in 1844 and purchased an ichthyosaur skeleton for his extensive natural history collection. The king&#x27;s physician and aide, Carl Gustav Carus, wrote in his journal:

Carus asked Anning to write her name and address in his pocketbook for future reference—she wrote it as &quot;Mary Annins&quot;—and when she handed it back to him she told him: &quot;I am well known throughout the whole of Europe&quot;. As time passed, Anning&#x27;s confidence in her knowledge grew, and in 1839 she wrote to the &quot;Magazine of Natural History&quot; to question the claim made in an article, that a recently discovered fossil of the prehistoric shark &quot;Hybodus&quot; represented a new genus, as an error since she had discovered the existence of fossil sharks with both straight and hooked teeth many years ago. The extract from the letter that the magazine printed was the only writing of Anning&#x27;s published in the scientific literature during her lifetime. Some personal letters written by Anning, such as her correspondence with Frances Augusta Bell, were published while she was alive, however.

=== Interactions with the scientific community ===
As a woman, Anning was treated as an outsider to the scientific community. At the time in Britain, women were not allowed to vote, hold public office, or attend university. The newly formed, but increasingly influential Geological Society of London did not allow women to become members, or even to attend meetings as guests. The only occupations generally open to working-class women were farm labour, domestic service, and work in the newly opened factories.

Although Anning knew more about fossils and geology than many of the wealthy fossilists to whom she sold, it was always the gentlemen geologists who published the scientific descriptions of the specimens she found, often neglecting to mention Anning&#x27;s name. She became resentful of this. Anna Pinney, a young woman who sometimes accompanied Anning while she collected, wrote: &quot;She says the world has used her ill ... these men of learning have sucked her brains, and made a great deal of publishing works, of which she furnished the contents, while she derived none of the advantages.&quot; Anning herself wrote in a letter: &quot;The world has used me so unkindly, I fear it has made me suspicious of everyone&quot;. Torrens writes that these slights to Anning were part of a larger pattern of ignoring the contributions of working-class people in early 19th-century scientific literature. Often a fossil would be found by a quarryman, construction worker, or road worker who would sell it to a wealthy collector, and it was the latter who was credited if the find was of scientific interest.

Along with purchasing specimens, many geologists visited Anning to collect fossils or discuss anatomy and classification. Henry De la Beche and Anning became friends as teenagers following his move to Lyme, and he, Anning, and sometimes her brother Joseph, went fossil-hunting together. De la Beche and Anning kept in touch as he became one of Britain&#x27;s leading geologists. William Buckland, who lectured on geology at the University of Oxford, often visited Lyme on his Christmas vacations and was frequently seen hunting for fossils with Anning. It was to him Anning made what would prove to be the scientifically important suggestion (in a letter auctioned for over £100,000 in 2020 ) that the strange conical objects known as bezoar stones were really the fossilised faeces of ichthyosaurs or plesiosaurs. Buckland would name the objects coprolites. In 1839 Buckland, Conybeare, and Richard Owen visited Lyme together so that Anning could lead them all on a fossil-collecting excursion.

Anning also assisted Thomas Hawkins with his efforts to collect ichthyosaur fossils at Lyme in the 1830s. She was aware of his penchant to &quot;enhance&quot; the fossils he collected. Anning wrote: &quot;he is such an enthusiast that he makes things as he imagines they ought to be; and not as they are really found...&quot;. A few years later there was a public scandal when it was discovered that Hawkins had inserted fake bones to make some ichthyosaur skeletons seem more complete, and later sold them to the government for the British Museum&#x27;s collection without the appraisers knowing about the additions.

The Swiss palaeontologist Louis Agassiz visited Lyme Regis in 1834 and worked with Anning to obtain and study fish fossils found in the region. He was so impressed by Anning and her friend Elizabeth Philpot that he wrote in his journal: &quot;Miss Philpot and Mary Anning have been able to show me with utter certainty which are the ichthyodorulite&#x27;s dorsal fins of sharks that correspond to different types.&quot; He thanked both of them for their help in his book, &quot;Studies of Fossil Fish&quot;.

Another leading British geologist, Roderick Murchison, did some of his first fieldwork in southwest England, including Lyme, accompanied by his wife, Charlotte. Murchison wrote that they decided Charlotte should stay behind in Lyme for a few weeks to &quot;become a good practical fossilist, by working with the celebrated Mary Anning of that place...&quot;. Charlotte and Anning became lifelong friends and correspondents. Charlotte, who travelled widely and met many prominent geologists through her work with her husband, helped Anning build her network of customers throughout Europe, and she stayed with the Murchisons when she visited London in 1829. Anning&#x27;s correspondents included Charles Lyell, who wrote to ask her opinion on how the sea was affecting the coastal cliffs around Lyme, as well as Adam Sedgwick—one of her earliest customers—who taught geology at the University of Cambridge and who numbered Charles Darwin among his students. Gideon Mantell, discoverer of the dinosaur Iguanodon, also visited Anning at her shop.

=== Financial difficulties and change in church affiliation ===

By 1830, because of difficult economic conditions in Britain that reduced the demand for fossils, coupled with long gaps between major finds, Anning was having financial problems again. Her friend, the geologist Henry De la Beche, assisted her by commissioning Georg Scharf to make a lithographic print based on De la Beche&#x27;s watercolour painting, &quot;Duria Antiquior&quot;, portraying life in prehistoric Dorset that was based largely on fossils Anning had found. De la Beche sold copies of the print to his fellow geologists and other wealthy friends and donated the proceeds to Anning. It became the first such scene from what later became known as deep time to be widely circulated. In December 1830, Anning finally made another major find, a skeleton of a new type of plesiosaur, which sold for £200.

It was around this time that Anning switched from attending the local Congregational church, where she had been baptised and in which she and her family had always been active members, to the Anglican church. The change was prompted in part by a decline in Congregational attendance that began in 1828 when its popular pastor, John Gleed, a fellow fossil collector, left for the United States to campaign against slavery. He was replaced by the less likeable Ebenezer Smith. The greater social respectability of the established church, in which some of Anning&#x27;s gentleman geologist customers such as Buckland, Conybeare, and Sedgwick were ordained clergy, was also a factor. Anning, who was devoutly religious, actively supported her new church as she had her old.

Anning suffered another serious financial setback in 1835 when she lost most of her life savings, about £300, in a bad investment. Sources differ somewhat on what exactly went wrong. Deborah Cadbury says that she invested with a conman who swindled her and disappeared with the money, but Shelley Emling writes that it is not clear whether the man ran off with the money or whether he died suddenly leaving Anning with no way to recover the investment. Concerned about Anning&#x27;s financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions to the science of geology. The £25 annual pension gave Anning some financial security.

=== Illness and death ===

Anning died from breast cancer at the age of 47 on 9 March 1847. Her fossil work had tailed off during the last few years of her life because of her illness, and as some townspeople misinterpreted the effects of the increasing doses of laudanum she was taking for the pain, there had been gossip in Lyme that she had a drinking problem. The regard in which Anning was held by the geological community was shown in 1846 when, upon learning of her cancer diagnosis, the Geological Society raised money from its members to help with her expenses and the council of the newly created Dorset County Museum made Anning an honorary member. She was buried on 15 March in the churchyard of St Michael&#x27;s, the local parish church. Members of the Geological Society contributed to a stained-glass window in Anning&#x27;s memory, unveiled in 1850. It depicts the six corporal &quot;acts of mercy&quot;—feeding the hungry, giving drink to the thirsty, clothing the naked, sheltering the homeless, visiting prisoners and the sick, and the inscription reads: &quot;This window is sacred to the memory of Mary Anning of this parish, who died 9 March AD 1847 and is erected by the vicar and some members of the Geological Society of London in commemoration of her usefulness in furthering the science of geology, as also of her benevolence of heart and integrity of life.&quot;
After Anning&#x27;s death, Henry De la Beche, president of the Geological Society, wrote a eulogy that he read to a meeting of the society and published in its quarterly transactions, the first such eulogy given for a woman. These were honours normally only accorded to fellows of the society, which did not admit women until 1904. The eulogy began:

I cannot close this notice of our losses by death without adverting to that of one, who though not placed among even the easier classes of society, but one who had to earn her daily bread by her labour, yet contributed by her talents and untiring researches in no small degree to our knowledge of the great Enalio-Saurians, and other forms of organic life entombed in the vicinity of Lyme Regis ...

An anonymous article about Anning&#x27;s life was published in February 1865 in Charles Dickens&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;All the Year Round&quot;. The profile, &quot;Mary Anning, The Fossil Finder,&quot; was long attributed to Dickens himself but, in 2014, historians of palaeontology Michael A. Taylor and Hugh S. Torrens identified Henry Stuart Fagan as the author, noting that Fagan&#x27;s work was &quot;neither original nor reliable&quot; and &quot;introduced errors into the Anning literature which are still problematic.&quot; Specifically, they noted that Fagan had largely and inaccurately plagiarised his article from an earlier account of Anning&#x27;s life and work by Dorset native Henry Rowland Brown, from the second edition of Brown&#x27;s 1859 guidebook, &quot;The Beauties of Lyme Regis.&quot; The article emphasised the difficulties Anning had overcome, especially the scepticism of her fellow townspeople. Fagan ended the article with: &quot;The carpenter&#x27;s daughter has won a name for herself, and has deserved to win it.&quot;

== Major discoveries ==
=== Ichthyosaurs ===
Anning&#x27;s first famous discovery was made shortly after her father&#x27;s death when she was still a child of about 12. In 1811 (some sources say 1810 or 1809) her brother Joseph found a skull, but failed to locate the rest of the animal. After Joseph told Anning to look between the cliffs at Lyme Regis and Charmouth, she found the skeleton— long in all—a few months later. The family hired workmen to dig it out in November that year, an event covered by the local press on 9 November, who identified the fossil as a crocodile.

Other ichthyosaur remains had been discovered in years past at Lyme and elsewhere, but the specimen found by the Annings was the first to come to the attention of scientific circles in London. It was purchased by the lord of a local manor, who passed it to William Bullock for public display in London where it created a sensation. At a time when most people in Britain still believed in a literal interpretation of Genesis, that the Earth was only a few thousand years old and that species did not evolve or become extinct, the find raised questions in scientific and religious circles about what the new science of geology was revealing about ancient life and the history of the Earth. Its notoriety increased when Sir Everard Home wrote a series of six papers, starting in 1814, describing it for the Royal Society. The papers never mentioned who had collected the fossil, and in the first one he even mistakenly credited the painstaking cleaning and preparation of the fossil performed by Anning to the staff at Bullock&#x27;s museum. Perplexed by the creature, Home kept changing his mind about its classification, first thinking it was a kind of fish, then thinking it might have some kind of affinity with the duck-billed platypus (only recently known to science); finally in 1819 he reasoned it might be a kind of intermediate form between salamanders and lizards, which led him to propose naming it Proteo-Saurus. By then Charles Konig, an assistant curator of the British Museum, had already suggested the name &quot;Ichthyosaurus&quot; (fish lizard) for the specimen and that name stuck. Konig purchased the skeleton for the museum in 1819. The skull of the specimen is still in the possession of the Natural History Museum in London (to which the fossil collections of the British Museum were transferred later in the century), but at some point, it became separated from the rest of the skeleton, the location of which is not known.

Anning found several other ichthyosaur fossils between 1815 and 1819, including almost complete skeletons of varying sizes. In 1821, William Conybeare and Henry De la Beche, both members of the Geological Society of London, collaborated on a paper that analysed in detail the specimens found by Anning and others. They concluded that ichthyosaurs were a previously unknown type of marine reptile, and based on differences in tooth structure, they concluded that there had been at least three species. Also in 1821, Anning found the skeleton from which the species &quot;Ichthyosaurus platydon&quot; (now &quot;Temnodontosaurus platyodon&quot;) would be named. In the 1980s it was determined that the first ichthyosaur specimen found by Joseph and Mary Anning was also a member of &quot;Temnodontosaurus platyodon&quot;.

In 2022, two plaster casts of the first complete ichthyosaur skeleton fossil found by Anning that was destroyed in the bombing of London during the Second World War, were discovered in separate collections. One is at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University in the US and the other at the Natural History Museum in Berlin, Germany. The casts may be secondary, being made from a direct cast of the fossil, but are determined to be of good condition, &quot;historically important&quot;, and likely taken from the specimen put for sale at auction by Anning in 1820.

=== &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; ===

In the same 1821 paper he co-authored with Henry De la Beche on ichthyosaur anatomy, William Conybeare named and described the genus &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; (near lizard), called so because he thought it more like modern reptiles than the ichthyosaur had been. The description was based on a number of fossils, the most complete of them specimen OUMNH J.50146, a paddle and vertebral column that had been obtained by Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas James Birch. Christopher McGowan has hypothesised that this specimen had originally been much more complete and had been collected by Anning, during the winter of 1820/1821. If so, it would have been Anning&#x27;s next major discovery, providing essential information about the newly recognised type of marine reptile. No records by Anning of the find are known. The paper thanked Birch for giving Conybeare access to it, but does not mention who discovered and prepared it.
In 1823, Anning discovered a second, much more complete plesiosaur skeleton, specimen NHMUK OR 22656 (formerly BMNH 22656). When Conybeare presented his analysis of plesiosaur anatomy to a meeting of the Geological Society in 1824, he again failed to mention Anning by name, even though she had possibly collected both skeletons and had made the sketch of the second skeleton he used in his presentation. Conybeare&#x27;s presentation was made at the same meeting at which William Buckland described the dinosaur &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and the combination created a sensation in scientific circles.

Conybeare&#x27;s presentation followed the resolution of a controversy over the legitimacy of one of the fossils. The fact that the plesiosaur&#x27;s long neck had an unprecedented 35 vertebrae raised the suspicions of the eminent French anatomist Georges Cuvier when he reviewed Anning&#x27;s drawings of the second skeleton, and he wrote to Conybeare suggesting the possibility that the find was a fake produced by combining fossil bones from different kinds of animals. Fraud was far from unknown among early 19th-century fossil collectors, and if the controversy had not been resolved promptly, the accusation could have seriously damaged Anning&#x27;s ability to sell fossils to other geologists. Cuvier&#x27;s accusation had resulted in a special meeting of the Geological Society earlier in 1824, which, after some debate, had concluded the skeleton was legitimate. Cuvier later admitted he had acted in haste and was mistaken.

Anning discovered yet another important and nearly complete plesiosaur skeleton in 1830. It was named &quot;Plesiosaurus macrocephalus&quot; by William Buckland and was described in an 1840 paper by Richard Owen. Once again Owen mentioned the wealthy gentleman who had purchased the fossil and made it available for examination, but not the woman who had discovered and prepared it.

=== Fossil fish and pterosaur ===

Anning found what a contemporary newspaper article called an unrivalled specimen of &quot;Dapedium politum&quot;. This was a ray-finned fish, which would be described in 1828. In December of that same year she made an important find consisting of the partial skeleton of a pterosaur. In 1829 William Buckland described it as &quot;Pterodactylus macronyx&quot; (later renamed &quot;Dimorphodon macronyx&quot; by Richard Owen), and unlike many other such occasions, Buckland credited Anning with the discovery in his paper. It was the first pterosaur skeleton found outside Germany, and it created a public sensation when displayed at the British Museum. Recent research has found that these creatures were not inclined to fly continuously in their search for fish.

In December 1829 she found a fossil fish, &quot;Squaloraja&quot;, which attracted attention because it had characteristics intermediate between sharks and rays.

=== Invertebrates and trace fossils ===
Vertebrate fossil finds, especially of marine reptiles, made Anning&#x27;s reputation, but she made numerous other contributions to early palaeontology. In 1826 Anning discovered what appeared to be a chamber containing dried ink inside a belemnite fossil. She showed it to her friend Elizabeth Philpot who was able to revivify the ink and use it to illustrate some of her own ichthyosaur fossils. Soon other local artists were doing the same, as more such fossilised ink chambers were discovered. Anning noted how closely the fossilised chambers resembled the ink sacs of modern squid and cuttlefish, which she had dissected to understand the anatomy of fossil cephalopods, and this led William Buckland to publish the conclusion that Jurassic belemnites had used ink for defence just as many modern cephalopods do. It was also Anning who noticed that the oddly shaped fossils then known as &quot;bezoar stones&quot; were sometimes found in the abdominal region of ichthyosaur skeletons. She noted that if such stones were broken open they often contained fossilised fish bones and scales, and sometimes bones from small ichthyosaurs. Anning suspected the stones were fossilised faeces and suggested so to Buckland in 1824. After further investigation and comparison with similar fossils found in other places, Buckland published that conclusion in 1829 and named them coprolites. In contrast to the finding of the plesiosaur skeletons a few years earlier, for which she was not credited, when Buckland presented his findings on coprolites to the Geological Society, he mentioned Anning by name and praised her skill and industry in helping to solve the mystery.

== Recognition and legacy ==
Anning&#x27;s discoveries became key pieces of evidence for extinction. Georges Cuvier had argued for the reality of extinction in the late 1790s based on his analysis of fossils of mammals such as mammoths. Nevertheless, until the early 1820s it was still believed by many scientifically literate people that just as new species did not appear, so existing ones did not become extinct—in part because they felt that extinction would imply that God&#x27;s creation had been imperfect; any oddities found were explained away as belonging to animals still living somewhere in an unexplored region of the Earth. The bizarre nature of the fossils found by Anning,—some, such as the plesiosaur, so unlike any known living creature—struck a major blow against this idea.

The ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, and pterosaur she found, along with the first dinosaur fossils which were discovered by Gideon Mantell and William Buckland during the same period, showed that during previous eras the Earth was inhabited by creatures different from those living today, and provided important support for another controversial suggestion of Cuvier&#x27;s: that there had been an &quot;age of reptiles&quot; when reptiles rather than mammals had been the dominant form of animal life. This phrase became popular after the publication in 1831 of a paper by Mantell entitled &quot;The Age of Reptiles&quot; that summarised the evidence that there had been an extended geological era when giant reptiles had swarmed the land, air, and sea. These discoveries also played a key role in the development of a new discipline of geohistorical analysis within geology in the 1820s that sought to understand the history of the Earth by using evidence from fossils to reconstruct extinct organisms and the environments in which they lived. This discipline eventually came to be called palaeontology. Illustrations of scenes from &quot;deep time&quot; (now known as palaeoart), such as Henry De la Beche&#x27;s ground-breaking painting &quot;Duria Antiquior&quot;, helped convince people that it was possible to understand life in the distant past. De la Beche had been inspired to create the painting by a vivid description of the food chain of the Lias by William Buckland that was based on analysis of coprolites. The study of coprolites, pioneered by Anning and Buckland, would prove to be a valuable tool for understanding ancient ecosystems.

Throughout the 20th century, beginning with H. A. Forde and his &quot;The Heroine of Lyme Regis: The Story of Mary Anning the Celebrated Geologist&quot; (1925), a number of writers saw Anning&#x27;s life as inspirational. According to P. J. McCartney in &quot;Henry De la Beche: Observations on an Observer&quot; (1978), she was the basis of Terry Sullivan&#x27;s lyrics to the 1908 song which, McCartney claimed, became the popular tongue twister, &quot;She Sells Seashells&quot;:

However, Stephen Winick of the American Folklife Center has shown that no evidence has been presented for any causal connection between Anning and the lyrics (which are about a music-hall performer who has difficulty with tongue-twisters); in particular, Winick consulted McCartney&#x27;s original text and discovered that not only did McCartney not provide any sources to support his statement, he merely said that Anning was &quot;reputed to be&quot; the subject of the song. Winick also pointed out that the tongue-twister pre-dated Sullivan by decades, and stated that there is a &quot;very imperfect fit between the details of the song and those of Mary Anning&#x27;s life&quot;, and &quot;not even a real female character in the song, let alone anyone recognizable as Mary Anning&quot;, ultimately concluding that if the song was intended as a tribute to Anning, it is &quot;a pretty ineffective one.&quot;

Much of the material written about Anning was aimed at children, and tended to focus on her childhood and early career. Much of it was also highly romanticised and not always historically accurate. Anning has been referenced in several historical novels, most notably in &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (1969) by John Fowles, who was critical of the fact that no British scientist had named a species after her in her lifetime.

In 1999, on the 200th anniversary of Anning&#x27;s birth, an international meeting of historians, palaeontologists, fossil collectors, and others interested in her life was held in Lyme Regis. In 2005 the Natural History Museum added Anning, alongside scientists such as Carl Linnaeus, Dorothea Bate, and William Smith, as one of the &quot;gallery characters&quot; (actors dressed in period costumes) it uses to walk around its display cases. In 2007, American playwright/performer Claudia Stevens premiered &quot;Blue Lias, or the Fish Lizard&#x27;s Whore&quot;, a solo play with music by Allen Shearer depicting Anning in later life. Among the presenters of its thirty performances around the Charles Darwin bicentennial were the Cleveland Museum of Natural History, museums of natural history at the University of Michigan and the University of Kansas, and the Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History. 

In 2009, Tracy Chevalier wrote a historical novel entitled &quot;Remarkable Creatures&quot;, in which Anning and Elizabeth Philpot were the main characters. Another historical novel about Anning, &quot;Curiosity&quot; by Joan Thomas, was published in March 2010.

In 2010, 163 years after her death, the Royal Society included Anning in a list of the ten British women who have most influenced the history of science.

In 1902, the Lyme Regis Museum was built on the site of her former home. It was commissioned by Thomas Philpot, a relative of the Philpot sisters. The area where she collected fossils is now part of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site.

In 2021, the Royal Mint issued sets of commemorative fifty pence coins called &quot;The Mary Anning Collection&quot;, minted in acknowledgement of her lack of recognition as &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s greatest fossil hunters.&quot; The coins have images of &quot;Temnodontosaurus&quot;, &quot;Plesiosaurus&quot; and &quot;Dimorphodon&quot;, which she discovered, and her discoveries were &quot;often overlooked at a time when the scientific world was dominated by men&quot;, and as &quot;a working-class woman.&quot;

In March 2024, the Royal Mail issued a set of four stamps celebrating Mary Anning and her discoveries.

In May 2024, a book that once belonged to Anning was returned to the museum in Lyme Regis from Australia on her 225th birthday. It is thought that the copy of JS Miller&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of the Crinoidea&quot; was stolen between 1946 and 1979, before Museums Victoria bought the book for £300 from Blackwell&#x27;s booksellers of Oxford in 1985.

=== Eponyms ===
The only person who did name a species after Anning during her lifetime was the Swiss-American naturalist, Louis Agassiz. In the early 1840s, he named two fossil fish species after Anning—&quot;Acrodus anningiae&quot;, and &quot;Belonostomus anningiae&quot; (now &quot;Saurorhynchus anningiae&quot;)—and another after her friend Elizabeth Philpot. Agassiz was grateful for the help the women had given him in examining fossil fish specimens during his visit to Lyme Regis in 1834. After Anning&#x27;s death, other species, including the ostracod &quot;Cytherelloidea anningi&quot;, and two genera, the therapsid reptile genus &quot;Anningia&quot;, and the bivalve mollusc genus &quot;Anningella&quot;, were named in her honour. In 2012, the plesiosaur genus &quot;Anningasaura&quot; was named after Anning and the species &quot;Ichthyosaurus anningae&quot; was named after her in 2015.

In 1991 &quot;Anning Paterae&quot;, a cluster of shallow volcanoes in the northern hemisphere of Venus and in 1999, &quot;(3919) Maryanning&quot;, an asteroid were named after her. In 2018, a new research and survey vessel was launched as &quot;Mary Anning&quot; for Swansea University.

===Statue===

In August 2018, a campaign called &quot;Mary Anning Rocks&quot; was formed by an 11-year-old schoolgirl from Dorset, Evie Swire, supported by her mother Anya Pearson. The campaign was set up to remember Anning in her hometown of Lyme Regis by erecting a statue and creating a learning legacy in her name. A crowdfunding campaign began but was put on hold due to the coronavirus pandemic; it resumed in November 2020, led by the charity &quot;Mary Anning Rocks&quot;. By January 2021, the sculptor Denise Dutton had been commissioned to produce the work. The statue was granted planning permission by Dorset Council for a space overlooking Black Ven, where Anning made many of her finds. Professor Alice Roberts and Swire unveiled the statue on 21 May 2022, the 223rd anniversary of Anning&#x27;s birth.

=== In fiction ===
Mary Anning appears in the web manga &quot;Learn Even More with Manga!&quot;, derived from the 2015 video game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot;. Her depiction in that manga brings several features from Anning&#x27;s life into play, such as fossil-collecting gear, fossils, and live versions of ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs. In 2022, Anning was added to the video game &quot;Fate/Grand Order&quot; as a gacha character for a limited time.

The film &quot;Ammonite&quot;, directed by Francis Lee, and based on segments of Anning&#x27;s life and legacy, premiered at the 2020 Toronto International Film Festival. Kate Winslet portrays Anning and Saoirse Ronan portrays Charlotte Murchison, with the two engaged in a fictional lesbian relationship.

<text>Pāli (, IAST: pāl̤i), also known as Pali-Magadhi, is a classical Middle Indo-Aryan language on the Indian subcontinent. It is widely studied because it is the language of the Buddhist &quot;Pāli Canon&quot; or &quot;Tipiṭaka&quot; as well as the sacred language of &quot;Theravāda&quot; Buddhism. Pali was designated as a classical language by the Government of India on 3 October 2024.

==Origin and development==
===Etymology===
The word &#x27;Pali&#x27; is used as a name for the language of the Theravada canon. The word seems to have its origins in commentarial traditions, wherein the (in the sense of the line of original text quoted) was distinguished from the commentary or vernacular translation that followed it in the manuscript. K. R. Norman suggests that its emergence was based on a misunderstanding of the compound , with being interpreted as the name of a particular language.

The name Pali does not appear in the canonical literature, and in commentary literature is sometimes substituted with , meaning a string or lineage. This name seems to have emerged in Sri Lanka early in the second millennium CE during a resurgence in the use of Pali as a courtly and literary language.

As such, the name of the language has caused some debate among scholars of all ages; the spelling of the name also varies, being found with both long &quot;ā&quot; and short &quot;a&quot; , and also with either a voiced retroflex lateral approximant or non-retroflex &quot;l&quot; sound. Both the long ā and retroflex are seen in the ISO 15919/ALA-LC rendering, ; however, to this day there is no single, standard spelling of the term, and all four possible spellings can be found in textbooks. R. C. Childers translates the word as &quot;series&quot; and states that the language &quot;bears the epithet in consequence of the perfection of its grammatical structure&quot;.

===Geographic origin===
There is persistent confusion as to the relation of to the vernacular spoken in the ancient kingdom of Magadha, which was located in modern-day Bihar. Beginning in the Theravada commentaries, Pali was identified with &#x27;Magadhi&#x27;, the language of the kingdom of Magadha, and this was taken to also be the language that the Buddha used during his life. In the 19th century, the British Orientalist Robert Caesar Childers argued that the true or geographical name of the Pali language was Magadhi Prakrit, and that because &quot;pāḷi&quot; means &quot;line, row, series&quot;, the early Buddhists extended the meaning of the term to mean &quot;a series of books&quot;, so &quot;pāḷibhāsā&quot; means &quot;language of the texts&quot;.

However, modern scholarship has regarded Pali as a mix of several Prakrit languages from around the 3rd century BCE, combined and partially Sanskritized. There is no attested dialect of Middle Indo-Aryan with all the features of Pali. In the modern era, it has been possible to compare Pali with inscriptions known to be in Magadhi Prakrit, as well as other texts and grammars of that language. While none of the existing sources specifically document pre-Ashokan Magadhi, the available sources suggest that Pali is not equatable with that language.

Modern scholars generally regard Pali to have originated from a western dialect, rather than an eastern one. Pali has some commonalities with both the western Ashokan Edicts at Girnar in Saurashtra, and the Central-Western Prakrit found in the eastern Hathigumpha inscription. These similarities lead scholars to associate Pali with this region of western India. Nonetheless, Pali does retain some eastern features that have been referred to as &quot;Māgadhisms&quot;.

Pāḷi, as a Middle Indo-Aryan language, is different from Classical Sanskrit more with regard to its dialectal base than the time of its origin. A number of its morphological and lexical features show that it is not a direct continuation of  Sanskrit. Instead it descends from one or more dialects that were, despite many similarities, different from .

===Early history===

The Theravada commentaries refer to the Pali language as &quot;Magadhan&quot; or the &quot;language of Magadha&quot;. This identification first appears in the commentaries, and may have been an attempt by Buddhists to associate themselves more closely with the Maurya Empire.

However, only some of the Buddha&#x27;s teachings were delivered in the historical territory of Magadha kingdom. Scholars consider it likely that he taught in several closely related dialects of Middle Indo-Aryan, which had a high degree of mutual intelligibility.

Theravada tradition, as recorded in chronicles like the Mahavamsa, states that the &quot;Tipitaka&quot; was first committed to writing during the first century BCE. This move away from the previous tradition of oral preservation is described as being motivated by threats to the &quot;Sangha&quot; from famine, war, and the growing influence of the rival tradition of the Abhayagiri Vihara. This account is generally accepted by scholars, though there are indications that Pali had already begun to be recorded in writing by this date. By this point in its history, scholars consider it likely that Pali had already undergone some initial assimilation with Sanskrit, such as the conversion of the Middle-Indic &quot;bahmana&quot; to the more familiar Sanskrit &quot;brāhmana&quot; that contemporary brahmans used to identify themselves.

In Sri Lanka, Pali is thought to have entered into a period of decline ending around the 4th or 5th century (as Sanskrit rose in prominence, and simultaneously, as Buddhism&#x27;s adherents became a smaller portion of the subcontinent), but ultimately survived. The work of Buddhaghosa was largely responsible for its reemergence as an important scholarly language in Buddhist thought. The &quot;Visuddhimagga&quot;, and the other commentaries that Buddhaghosa compiled, codified and condensed the Sinhala commentarial tradition that had been preserved and expanded in Sri Lanka since the 3rd century BCE.

With only a few possible exceptions, the entire corpus of Pali texts known today is believed to derive from the Anuradhapura Maha Viharaya in Sri Lanka. While literary evidence exists of Theravadins in mainland India surviving into the 13th century, no Pali texts specifically attributable to this tradition have been recovered. Some texts (such as the Milindapanha) may have been composed in India before being transmitted to Sri Lanka, but the surviving versions of the texts are those preserved by the Mahavihara in Ceylon and shared with monasteries in Theravada Southeast Asia.

The earliest inscriptions in Pali found in mainland Southeast Asia are from the first millennium CE, some possibly dating to as early as the 4th century. Inscriptions are found in what are now Burma, Laos, Thailand and Cambodia and may have spread from southern India rather than Sri Lanka. By the 11th century, a so-called &quot;Pali renaissance&quot; began in the vicinity of Pagan, gradually spreading to the rest of mainland Southeast Asia as royal dynasties sponsored monastic lineages derived from the Mahavihara of Anuradhapura. This era was also characterized by the adoption of Sanskrit conventions and poetic forms (such as &quot;kavya&quot;) that had not been features of earlier Pali literature. This process began as early as the 5th century, but intensified early in the second millennium as Pali texts on poetics and composition modeled on Sanskrit forms began to grow in popularity. One milestone of this period was the publication of the Subodhalankara during the 14th century, a work attributed to Sangharakkhita Mahāsāmi and modeled on the Sanskrit Kavyadarsa.

Peter Masefield devoted considerable research to a form of Pali known as Indochinese Pali or &#x27;Kham Pali&#x27;. Up until now, this has been considered a degraded form of Pali, But Masefield states that further examination of a very considerable corpus of texts will probably show that this is an internally consistent Pali dialect. The reason for the changes is that some combinations of characters are difficult to write in those scripts. Masefield further states that upon the third re-introduction of Theravada Buddhism into Sri Lanka (The Siyamese Sect), records in Thailand state that large number of texts were also taken. It seems that when the monastic ordination died out in Sri Lanka, many texts were lost also. Therefore, the Sri Lankan Pali canon had been translated first into Indo-Chinese Pali, and then back again into Pali.

Despite an expansion of the number and influence of Mahavihara-derived monastics, this resurgence of Pali study resulted in no production of any new surviving literary works in Pali. During this era, correspondences between royal courts in Sri Lanka and mainland Southeast Asia were conducted in Pali, and grammars aimed at speakers of Sinhala, Burmese, and other languages were produced. The emergence of the term &#x27;Pali&#x27; as the name of the language of the Theravada canon also occurred during this era.

====Manuscripts and inscriptions====

While Pali is generally recognized as an ancient language, no epigraphical or manuscript evidence has survived from the earliest eras. The earliest samples of Pali discovered are inscriptions believed to date from 5th to 8th century located in mainland Southeast Asia, specifically central Siam and lower Burma. These inscriptions typically consist of short excerpts from the Pali Canon and non-canonical texts, and include several examples of the Ye dhamma hetu verse.

The oldest surviving Pali manuscript was discovered in Nepal dating to the 9th century. It is in the form of four palm-leaf folios, using a transitional script deriving from the Gupta script to scribe a fragment of the Cullavagga. The oldest known manuscripts from Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia date to the 13th–15th century, with few surviving examples. Very few manuscripts older than 400 years have survived, and complete manuscripts of the four Nikayas are only available in examples from the 17th century and later.

====Early Western research====
Pali was first mentioned in Western literature in Simon de la Loubère&#x27;s descriptions of his travels in the kingdom of Siam. An early grammar and dictionary was published by Methodist missionary Benjamin Clough in 1824, and an initial study published by Eugène Burnouf and Christian Lassen in 1826 (&quot;Essai sur le Pali, ou Langue sacrée de la presqu&#x27;île au-delà du Gange&quot;). The first modern Pali-English dictionary was published by Robert Childers in 1872 and 1875. Following the foundation of the Pali Text Society, English Pali studies grew rapidly and Childer&#x27;s dictionary became outdated. Planning for a new dictionary began in the early 1900s, but delays (including the outbreak of World War I) meant that work was not completed until 1925.

T. W. Rhys Davids in his book &quot;Buddhist India&quot;, and Wilhelm Geiger in his book &quot;Pāli Literature and Language&quot;, suggested that Pali may have originated as a lingua franca or common language of culture among people who used differing dialects in North India, used at the time of the Buddha and employed by him. Another scholar states that at that time it was &quot;a refined and elegant vernacular of all Aryan-speaking people&quot;. Modern scholarship has not arrived at a consensus on the issue; there are a variety of conflicting theories with supporters and detractors. After the death of the Buddha, Pali may have evolved among Buddhists out of the language of the Buddha as a new artificial language. R. C. Childers, who held to the theory that Pali was Old Magadhi, wrote: &quot;Had Gautama never preached, it is unlikely that Magadhese would have been distinguished from the many other vernaculars of Hindustan, except perhaps by an inherent grace and strength which make it a sort of Tuscan among the Prakrits.&quot;

====Modern scholarship====
According to K. R. Norman, differences between different texts within the canon suggest that it contains material from more than a single dialect. He also suggests it is likely that the viharas in North India had separate collections of material, preserved in the local dialect. In the early period it is likely that no degree of translation was necessary in communicating this material to other areas. Around the time of Ashoka there had been more linguistic divergence, and an attempt was made to assemble all the material. It is possible that a language quite close to the Pali of the canon emerged as a result of this process as a compromise of the various dialects in which the earliest material had been preserved, and this language functioned as a lingua franca among Eastern Buddhists from then on. Following this period, the language underwent a small degree of Sanskritisation (i.e., MIA bamhana &gt; brahmana, tta &gt; tva in some cases).

Bhikkhu Bodhi, summarizing the current state of scholarship, states that the language is &quot;closely related to the language (or, more likely, the various regional dialects) that the Buddha himself spoke&quot;. He goes on to write:

According to A. K. Warder, the Pali language is a Prakrit language used in a region of Western India. Warder associates Pali with the Indian realm (&quot;janapada&quot;) of Avanti, where the Sthavira nikāya was centered. Following the initial split in the Buddhist community, the Sthavira nikāya became influential in Western and South India while the Mahāsāṃghika branch became influential in Central and East India. Akira Hirakawa and Paul Groner also associate Pali with Western India and the Sthavira nikāya, citing the Saurashtran inscriptions, which are linguistically closest to the Pali language.

====Emic views of Pali====
Although Sanskrit was said in the Brahmanical tradition to be the unchanging language spoken by the gods in which each word had an inherent significance, such views for any language was not shared in the early Buddhist traditions, in which words were only conventional and mutable signs. This view of language naturally extended to Pali and may have contributed to its usage (as an approximation or standardization of local Middle Indic dialects) in place of Sanskrit. However, by the time of the compilation of the Pali commentaries (4th or 5th century), Pali was described by the anonymous authors as the natural language, the root language of all beings.

Comparable to Ancient Egyptian, Latin or Hebrew in the mystic traditions of the West, Pali recitations were often thought to have a supernatural power (which could be attributed to their meaning, the character of the reciter, or the qualities of the language itself), and in the early strata of Buddhist literature we can already see Pali s used as charms, as, for example, against the bite of snakes. Many people in Theravada cultures still believe that taking a vow in Pali has a special significance, and, as one example of the supernatural power assigned to chanting in the language, the recitation of the vows of  are believed to alleviate the pain of childbirth in Sri Lanka. In Thailand, the chanting of a portion of the  is believed to be beneficial to the recently departed, and this ceremony routinely occupies as much as seven working days. There is nothing in the latter text that relates to this subject, and the origins of the custom are unclear.

===Pali today===
Pali died out as a literary language in mainland India in the fourteenth century but survived elsewhere until the eighteenth. Today Pali is studied mainly to gain access to Buddhist scriptures, and is frequently chanted in a ritual context. The secular literature of Pali historical chronicles, medical texts, and inscriptions is also of great historical importance. The great centres of Pali learning remain in Sri Lanka and other Theravada nations of Southeast Asia: Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Cambodia. Since the 19th century, various societies for the revival of Pali studies in India have promoted awareness of the language and its literature, including the Maha Bodhi Society founded by Anagarika Dhammapala.

In Europe, the Pali Text Society has been a major force in promoting the study of Pali by Western scholars since its founding in 1881. Based in the United Kingdom, the society publishes romanized Pali editions, along with many English translations of these sources. In 1869, the first &quot;Pali Dictionary&quot; was published using the research of Robert Caesar Childers, one of the founding members of the Pali Text Society. It was the first Pali translated text in English and was published in 1872. Childers&#x27; dictionary later received the Volney Prize in 1876.

The Pali Text Society was founded in part to compensate for the very low level of funds allocated to Indology in late 19th-century England and the rest of the UK; incongruously, the citizens of the UK were not nearly so robust in Sanskrit and Prakrit language studies as Germany, Russia, and even Denmark. Even without the inspiration of colonial holdings such as the former British occupation of Sri Lanka and Burma, institutions such as the Danish Royal Library have built up major collections of Pali manuscripts, and major traditions of Pali studies.

==Pali literature==

Pali literature is usually divided into canonical and non-canonical or extra-canonical texts. Canonical texts include the whole of the Pali Canon or &quot;Tipitaka&quot;. With the exception of three books placed in the Khuddaka Nikaya by only the Burmese tradition, these texts (consisting of the five Nikayas of the Sutta Pitaka, the Vinaya Pitaka, and the books of the Abhidhamma Pitaka) are traditionally accepted as containing the words of the Buddha and his immediate disciples by the Theravada tradition.

Extra-canonical texts can be divided into several categories:
* Commentaries (&quot;Atthakatha&quot;) which record additional details and explanations regarding the contents of the Suttas.
* Sub-commentaries (&quot;ṭīkā&quot;) which explain and add contents to the commentaries
* Chronicles (&quot;Vaṃsa&quot;) which relate the history of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, as well as the origins of famous relics and shrines and the deeds of historical and mythical kings
* Manuals and treatises, which include summaries of canonical books and compendia of teachings and techniques like the Visuddhimagga
* Abhidhamma manuals, which explain the contents of the Abhidhamma Pitaka

Other types of texts present in Pali literature include works on grammar and poetics, medical texts, astrological and divination texts, cosmologies, and anthologies or collections of material from the canonical literature.

While the majority of works in Pali are believed to have originated with the Sri Lankan tradition and then spread to other Theravada regions, some texts may have other origins. The Milinda Panha may have originated in northern India before being translated from Sanskrit or Gandhari Prakrit. There are also a number of texts that are believed to have been composed in Pali in Sri Lanka, Thailand and Burma but were not widely circulated. This regional Pali literature is currently relatively little known, particularly in the Thai tradition, with many manuscripts never catalogued or published.

==Relationship to other languages==
===Paiśācī===

 is a largely unattested literary language of classical India that is mentioned in Prakrit and Sanskrit grammars of antiquity. It is found grouped with the Prakrit languages, with which it shares some linguistic similarities, but was not considered a spoken language by the early grammarians because it was understood to have been purely a literary language.

In works of Sanskrit poetics such as Daṇḍin&#x27;s &quot;Kavyadarsha&quot;, it is also known by the name of , an epithet which can be interpreted as &#x27;dead language&#x27; (i.e., with no surviving speakers), or means past and means language i.e. &#x27;a language spoken in the past&#x27;. Evidence which lends support to this interpretation is that literature in Paiśācī is fragmentary and extremely rare but may once have been common.

The 13th-century Tibetan historian Buton Rinchen Drub wrote that the early Buddhist schools were separated by choice of sacred language: the Mahāsāṃghikas used Prakrit, the Sarvāstivādins used Sanskrit, the Sthaviravādins used Paiśācī, and the Saṃmitīya used Apabhraṃśa. This observation has led some scholars to theorize connections between Pali and Paiśācī; Sten Konow concluded that it may have been an Indo-Aryan language spoken by Dravidian people in South India, and Alfred Master noted a number of similarities between surviving fragments and Pali morphology.

===Ardha-Magadhi Prakrit===

Ardhamagadhi Prakrit was a Middle Indo-Aryan language and a Dramatic Prakrit thought to have been spoken in modern-day Bihar &amp; Eastern Uttar Pradesh and used in some early Buddhist and Jain drama. It was originally thought to be a predecessor of the vernacular Magadhi Prakrit, hence the name (literally &quot;half-Magadhi&quot;). Ardhamāgadhī was prominently used by Jain scholars and is preserved in the Jain Agamas.

Ardhamagadhi Prakrit differs from later Magadhi Prakrit in similar ways to Pali, and was often believed to be connected with Pali on the basis of the belief that Pali recorded the speech of the Buddha in an early Magadhi dialect.

===Magadhi Prakrit===

Magadhi Prakrit was a Middle Indic language spoken in present-day Bihar, and eastern Uttar Pradesh. Its use later expanded southeast to include some regions of modern-day Bengal, Odisha, and Assam, and it was used in some Prakrit dramas to represent vernacular dialogue. Preserved examples of Magadhi Prakrit are from several centuries after the theorized lifetime of the Buddha, and include inscriptions attributed to Asoka Maurya.

Differences observed between preserved examples of Magadhi Prakrit and Pali lead scholars to conclude that Pali represented a development of a northwestern dialect of Middle Indic, rather than being a continuation of a language spoken in the area of Magadha in the time of the Buddha.

==Lexicon==
Nearly every word in Pāḷi has cognates in the other Middle Indo-Aryan languages, the Prakrits. The relationship to Vedic Sanskrit is less direct and more complicated; the Prakrits were descended from Old Indo-Aryan vernaculars. Historically, influence between Pali and Sanskrit has been felt in both directions. The Pali language&#x27;s resemblance to Sanskrit is often exaggerated by comparing it to later Sanskrit compositions—which were written centuries after Sanskrit ceased to be a living language, and are influenced by developments in Middle Indic, including the direct borrowing of a portion of the Middle Indic lexicon; whereas, a good deal of later Pali technical terminology has been borrowed from the vocabulary of equivalent disciplines in Sanskrit, either directly or with certain phonological adaptations.

Post-canonical Pali also possesses a few loan-words from local languages where Pali was used (e.g. Sri Lankans adding Sinhala words to Pali). These usages differentiate the Pali found in the  from later compositions such as the Pali commentaries on the canon and folklore (e.g., commentaries on the Jataka tales), and comparative study (and dating) of texts on the basis of such loan-words is now a specialized field unto itself.

Pali was not exclusively used to convey the teachings of the Buddha, as can be deduced from the existence of a number of secular texts, such as books of medical science/instruction, in Pali. However, scholarly interest in the language has been focused upon religious and philosophical literature, because of the unique window it opens on one phase in the development of Buddhism.

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
Vowels may be divided in two different ways:

## pure vowels: &quot;a, ā, e, o&quot;
## sonant vowels: &quot;i, ī, u, ū&quot;
## vowels short by nature: &quot;a, i, u&quot;
## vowels long by nature: &quot;ā, ī, ū&quot;
## vowels of variable length: &quot;e, o&quot;

Long and short vowels are only contrastive in open syllables; in closed syllables, all vowels are always short. Short and long e and o are in complementary distribution: the short variants occur only in closed syllables, the long variants occur only in open syllables. Short and long e and o are therefore not distinct phonemes.

&quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot; are long in an open syllable: at the end of a syllable as in [ne-tum̩] เนตุํ &#x27;to lead&#x27; or [so-tum̩] โสตุํ &#x27;to hear&#x27;. They are short in a closed syllable: when followed by a consonant with which they make a syllable as in [upek-khā] &#x27;indifference&#x27; or [sot-thi] &#x27;safety&#x27;.

&quot;e&quot; appears for &quot;a&quot; before doubled consonants:

: &quot;seyyā&quot; = Skt. &quot;śayyā&quot; &#x27;bed&#x27;
: &quot;pheggu&quot; = Skt. &quot;phaigu&quot; &#x27;empty, worthless&#x27;

The vowels ⟨i⟩ and ⟨u⟩ are lengthened in the flexional endings including: &quot;-īhi, -ūhi and -īsu&quot;

A sound called &quot;anusvāra&quot; (Skt.; Pali: &quot;niggahīta&quot;), represented by the letter &#x27; (ISO 15919) or &#x27; (ALA-LC) in romanization, and by a raised dot in most traditional alphabets, originally marked the fact that the preceding vowel was nasalized. That is, &#x27;, &#x27; and &#x27; represented , and . In many traditional pronunciations, however, the anusvāra is pronounced more strongly, like the velar nasal , so that these sounds are pronounced instead , and . However pronounced, &#x27; never follows a long vowel; ā, ī and ū are converted to the corresponding short vowels when is added to a stem ending in a long vowel, e.g. &#x27; becomes &#x27;, not , &#x27; becomes &#x27;, not *.

Changes of vowels due to the structure of the word

Final vowels

The final consonants of the Sanskrit words have been dropped in Pali and thus all the words end in a vowel or in a nasal vowel: &quot; -&gt; kantā &#x27;from the loved one″&quot;; &quot; -&gt; &#x27;the loved one″&quot;

The final vowels were usually weak in pronunciation and hence they were shortened: &quot;akārsit -&gt; akāsi &#x27;he did&#x27;.&quot;

===Consonants===

Among the labial consonants, is labiodental and the rest are bilabial. Among the dental/alveolar consonants, the majority is dental but and are alveolar.

Of the sounds listed above only the three consonants in parentheses, ṅ, ḷ, and ḷh, are not distinct phonemes in Pali: ṅ only occurs before velar stops, while ḷ and ḷh are intervocalic allophones of single ḍ and ḍh.

In the Pali language, the consonants may be divided according to their strength or power of resistance. The strength decreases in the order of: &quot;mutes, sibilant, nasals, l, v, y, r&quot;

When two consonants come together, they are subject to one of the following change:

# they are assimilated to each other
# they are first adapted and then assimilated to each other
# they give rise to a new consonant group
# they separated by the insertion of an epenthetic vowel
# they are sometimes interchanged by metathesis

Aspirate consonants

when one of the two consonants is the sibilant s, then the new group of consonants has the aspiration in the last consonant: &quot;as-ti (root: √as) &gt; atthi&quot; &#x27;is&#x27;

the sibilant s, followed by a nasal, is changed to h and then it is transposed after the nasal (metathesis): &quot;akas-ma &gt; akah-ma &gt; akamha&quot; &#x27;we did&#x27;

Alternation between &quot;y&quot; and &quot;v&quot;

Pali v appears for Skr. y. For instance, &quot;āvudha -&gt; āyudha&quot; &#x27;weapon&#x27;; &quot;kasāva -&gt; kasāya&quot; &#x27;dirt, sin&#x27;. After the svarabhakti-vowel I there appear v instead of y as in &quot;praṭyamsa -&gt; pativimsa.&quot;

Alternation between &quot;r&quot; and &quot;l&quot;

Representation of &quot;r&quot; by &quot;l&quot; is very common in Pali, and in Pkr. it is the rule for Magadhi, although this substitution occurs sporadically also in other dialect. This, initially, in &quot;lūjjati -&gt; rūjyate &#x27;falls apart″&quot;; sometimes both forms with l and r occur in Skr.: &quot;lūkha -&gt; lūksa, rūksa &#x27;gross, bad″&quot;

==Morphology==
Pali is a highly inflected language, in which almost every word contains, besides the root conveying the basic meaning, one or more affixes (usually suffixes) which modify the meaning in some way. Nouns are inflected for gender, number, and case; verbal inflections convey information about person, number, tense and mood.

===Nominal inflection===
Pali nouns inflect for three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and two numbers (singular and plural). The nouns also, in principle, display eight cases: nominative or &quot;paccatta&quot; case, vocative, accusative or &quot;upayoga&quot; case, instrumental or &quot;&quot; case, dative or &quot;sampadāna&quot; case, ablative, genitive or &quot;sāmin&quot; case, and locative or &quot;bhumma&quot; case; however, in many instances, two or more of these cases are identical in form; this is especially true of the genitive and dative cases.

====a-stems====
a-stems, whose uninflected stem ends in short &quot;a&quot; (), are either masculine or neuter. The masculine and neuter forms differ only in the nominative, vocative, and accusative cases.

====ā-stems====
Nouns ending in ā () are almost always feminine.

====i-stems and u-stems====
i-stems and u-stems are either masculine or neuter. The masculine and neuter forms differ only in the nominative and accusative cases. The vocative has the same form as the nominative.

==Linguistic analysis of a Pali text==

From the opening of the Dhammapada:

The three compounds in the first line literally mean:
: &quot;whose precursor is mind&quot;, &quot;having mind as a fore-goer or leader&quot;
: &quot;whose foremost member is mind&quot;, &quot;having mind as chief&quot;
: &quot;consisting of mind&quot; or &quot;made by mind&quot;

The literal meaning is therefore: &quot;The dharmas have mind as their leader, mind as their chief, are made of/by mind. If [someone] either speaks or acts with a corrupted mind, from that [cause] suffering goes after him, as the wheel [of a cart follows] the foot of a draught animal.&quot;

A slightly freer translation by Acharya Buddharakkhita
:Mind precedes all mental states. Mind is their chief; they are all mind-wrought.
:If with an impure mind a person speaks or acts suffering follows him
:like the wheel that follows the foot of the ox.

==Conversion between Sanskrit and Pali forms==
Pali and Sanskrit are very closely related and the common characteristics of Pali and Sanskrit were always easily recognized by those in India who were familiar with both. A large part of Pali and Sanskrit word-stems are identical in form, differing only in details of inflection.

Technical terms from Sanskrit were converted into Pali by a set of conventional phonological transformations. These transformations mimicked a subset of the phonological developments that had occurred in Proto-Pali. Because of the prevalence of these transformations, it is not always possible to tell whether a given Pali word is a part of the old Prakrit lexicon, or a transformed borrowing from Sanskrit. The existence of a Sanskrit word regularly corresponding to a Pali word is not always secure evidence of the Pali etymology, since, in some cases, artificial Sanskrit words were created by back-formation from Prakrit words.

The following phonological processes are not intended as an exhaustive description of the historical changes which produced Pali from its Old Indic ancestor, but rather are a summary of the most common phonological equations between Sanskrit and Pali, with no claim to completeness.

===Vowels and diphthongs===
* Sanskrit ai and au always monophthongize to Pali e and o, respectively
::Examples: maitrī (friendliness, benevolence) → mettā, auṣadha (medical herb) → osadha
* Sanskrit āya, ayā and avā reduce to Pali ā
::Examples: katipayāha (someone) → katipāha, vaihāyasa (sky-dwelling) → vehāsa, yāvagū (barley) → yāgu
* Sanskrit aya and ava likewise often reduce to Pali e and o
::Examples: dhārayati (one maintains, one holds) → dhāreti, avatāra (descent) → otāra, bhavati (one becomes) → hoti
* Sanskrit avi and ayū becomes Pali e (i.e. avi → ai → e) and o
::Examples: sthavira (broad, thick, compact) → thera, mayūra (peacock) → mora
* Sanskrit ṛ appears in Pali as a, i or u, often agreeing with the vowel in the following syllable. ṛ also sometimes becomes u after labial consonants.
::Examples: kṛta (done) → kata, tṛṣṇa (thirst) → taṇha, smṛti (remembrance, reminiscence) → sati, ṛṣi (cleric) → isi, dṛṣṭi (vision, sight) → diṭṭhi, ṛddhi (growth, increase) → iddhi, ṛju (straight) → uju, spṛṣṭa (touched) → phuṭṭha, vṛddha (old) → vuddha
* Sanskrit long vowels are shortened before a sequence of two following consonants.
::Examples: kṣānti (patience, forbearance, endurance, indulgence) → khanti, rājya (kingdom) → rajja, īśvara (lord) → issara, tīrṇa (crossed, surpassed) → tiṇṇa, pūrva (east) → pubba

===Consonants===

====Sound changes====
* The Sanskrit sibilants ś, ṣ, and s merge as Pali s
::Examples: śaraṇa (protector, defender) → saraṇa, doṣa (night, darkness) → dosa
* The Sanskrit stops ḍ and ḍh become ḷ and ḷh between vowels (as in Vedic)
::Example: cakravāḍa (cyclic) → cakkavāḷa, virūḍha (mounted, sprouted) → virūḷha

====Assimilations====

=====General rules=====
*Many assimilations of one consonant to a neighboring consonant occurred in the development of Pali, producing a large number of geminate (double) consonants. Since aspiration of a geminate consonant is only phonetically detectable on the last consonant of a cluster, geminate kh, gh, ch, jh, ṭh, ḍh, th, dh, ph and bh appear as kkh, ggh, cch, jjh, ṭṭh, ḍḍh, tth, ddh, pph and bbh, not as &quot;khkh, ghgh&quot; etc.
*Initial consonant clusters are simplified to a single consonant.
::Examples: prāṇa (respiration) → pāṇa (not &quot;ppāṇa&quot;), sthavira (compact, dense) → thera (not &quot;tthera&quot;), dhyāna (meditation) → jhāna (not &quot;jjhāna&quot;), jñāti (intelligence) → ñāti (not &quot;ññāti&quot;)
*When assimilation would produce a sequence of three consonants in the middle of a word, geminates are simplified until there are only two consonants in sequence.
::Examples: uttrāsa (fear, terror) → uttāsa (not &quot;utttāsa&quot;), mantra (instrument of thought, speech) → manta (not &quot;mantta&quot;), indra (conqueror) → inda (not &quot;indda&quot;), vandhya (barren, fruitless, deprived) → vañjha (not &quot;vañjjha&quot;)
*The sequence vv resulting from assimilation changes to bb.
::Example: sarva (all, every, various) → savva → sabba, pravrajati (one moves forth) → pavvajati → pabbajati, divya (supernatural, wonderful, magical) → divva → dibba, nirvāṇa (deceased, extinguished; extinction, cessation, vanishing, disappearance) → nivvāṇa → nibbāna

=====Total assimilation=====
Total assimilation, where one sound becomes identical to a neighboring sound, is of two types: progressive, where the assimilated sound becomes identical to the following sound; and regressive, where it becomes identical to the preceding sound.

======Regressive assimilations======
* Internal visarga assimilates to a following voiceless stop or sibilant
::Examples: duḥkṛta (=duṣkṛta, wrong-done) → dukkata, duḥkha (difficult, unagreeable) → dukkha, duḥprajña (misknowledge) → duppañña, niḥkrodha (=niṣkrodha, wrath) → nikkodha, niḥpakva (=niṣpakva, well-cooked, decocted, infused) → nippakka, niḥśoka (ugly, unhappy, inglorious)→ nissoka, niḥsattva → nissatta
* In a sequence of two dissimilar Sanskrit stops, the first stop assimilates to the second stop
::Examples: vimukti → vimutti, dugdha → duddha, utpāda → uppāda, pudgala → puggala, udghoṣa → ugghosa, adbhuta → abbhuta, śabda → sadda
* In a sequence of two dissimilar nasals, the first nasal assimilates to the second nasal
::Example: unmatta → ummatta, pradyumna → pajjunna
* j assimilates to a following ñ (i.e., jñ becomes ññ)
::Examples: prajñā → paññā, jñāti → ñāti
* The Sanskrit liquid consonants r and l assimilate to a following stop, nasal, sibilant, or v
::Examples: mārga → magga, karma → kamma, varṣa → vassa, kalpa → kappa, sarva → savva → sabba
* r assimilates to a following l
::Examples: durlabha → dullabha, nirlopa → nillopa
* d sometimes assimilates to a following v, producing vv → bb
::Examples: udvigna → uvvigga → ubbigga, dvādaśa → bārasa (beside dvādasa)
* t and d may assimilate to a following s or y when a morpheme boundary intervenes
::Examples: ut+sava → ussava, ud+yāna → uyyāna

======Progressive assimilations======
* Nasals sometimes assimilate to a preceding stop (in other cases epenthesis occurs)
::Examples: agni (fire) → aggi, ātman (self) → atta, prāpnoti → pappoti, śaknoti → sakkoti
* m assimilates to an initial sibilant
::Examples: smarati → sarati, smṛti → sati
* Nasals assimilate to a preceding stop+sibilant cluster, which then develops in the same way as such clusters without following nasals
::Examples: tīkṣṇa → tikṣa → tikkha, lakṣmī → lakṣī →lakkhī
* The Sanskrit liquid consonants r and l assimilate to a preceding stop, nasal, sibilant, or v
::Examples: prāṇa → pāṇa, grāma → gāma, śrāvaka → sāvaka, agra → agga, indra → inda, pravrajati → pavvajati → pabbajati, aśru → assu
* y assimilates to preceding non-dental/retroflex stops or nasals
::Examples: cyavati → cavati, jyotiṣ → joti, rājya → rajja, matsya → macchya → maccha, lapsyate → lacchyate → lacchati, abhyāgata → abbhāgata, ākhyāti → akkhāti, saṁkhyā → saṅkhā (but also saṅkhyā), ramya → ramma
* y assimilates to preceding non-initial v, producing vv → bb
::Example: divya → divva → dibba, veditavya → veditavva → veditabba, bhāvya → bhavva → bhabba
* y and v assimilate to any preceding sibilant, producing ss
::Examples: paśyati → passati, śyena → sena, aśva → assa, īśvara → issara, kariṣyati → karissati, tasya → tassa, svāmin → sāmī
* v sometimes assimilates to a preceding stop
::Examples: pakva → pakka, catvāri → cattāri, sattva → satta, dhvaja → dhaja

=====Partial and mutual assimilation=====
* Sanskrit sibilants before a stop assimilate to that stop, and if that stop is not already aspirated, it becomes aspirated; e.g. śc, st, ṣṭ and sp become cch, tth, ṭṭh and pph
::Examples: paścāt → pacchā, asti → atthi, stava → thava, śreṣṭha → seṭṭha, aṣṭa → aṭṭha, sparśa → phassa
* In sibilant-stop-liquid sequences, the liquid is assimilated to the preceding consonant, and the cluster behaves like sibilant-stop sequences; e.g. str and ṣṭr become tth and ṭṭh
::Examples: śāstra → śasta → sattha, rāṣṭra → raṣṭa → raṭṭha
* t and p become c before s, and the sibilant assimilates to the preceding sound as an aspirate (i.e., the sequences ts and ps become cch)
::Examples: vatsa → vaccha, apsaras → accharā
* A sibilant assimilates to a preceding k as an aspirate (i.e., the sequence kṣ becomes kkh)
::Examples: bhikṣu → bhikkhu, kṣānti → khanti
* Any dental or retroflex stop or nasal followed by y converts to the corresponding palatal sound, and the y assimilates to this new consonant, i.e. ty, thy, dy, dhy, ny become cc, cch, jj, jjh, ññ; likewise ṇy becomes ññ. Nasals preceding a stop that becomes palatal share this change.
::Examples: tyajati → cyajati → cajati, satya → sacya → sacca, mithyā → michyā → micchā, vidyā → vijyā → vijjā, madhya → majhya → majjha, anya → añya → añña, puṇya → puñya → puñña, vandhya → vañjhya → vañjjha → vañjha
* The sequence mr becomes mb, via the epenthesis of a stop between the nasal and liquid, followed by assimilation of the liquid to the stop and subsequent simplification of the resulting geminate.
::Examples: āmra → ambra → amba, tāmra → tamba

====Epenthesis====
An epenthetic vowel is sometimes inserted between certain consonant-sequences. As with ṛ, the vowel may be a, i, or u, depending on the influence of a neighboring consonant or of the vowel in the following syllable. i is often found near i, y, or palatal consonants; u is found near u, v, or labial consonants.
* Sequences of stop + nasal are sometimes separated by a or u
::Example: ratna → ratana, padma → paduma (u influenced by labial m)
* The sequence sn may become sin initially
::Examples: snāna → sināna, sneha → sineha
* i may be inserted between a consonant and l
::Examples: kleśa → kilesa, glāna → gilāna, mlāyati → milāyati, ślāghati → silāghati
* An epenthetic vowel may be inserted between an initial sibilant and r
::Example: śrī → sirī
* The sequence ry generally becomes riy (i influenced by following y), but is still treated as a two-consonant sequence for the purposes of vowel-shortening
::Example: ārya → arya → ariya, sūrya → surya → suriya, vīrya → virya → viriya
* a or i is inserted between r and h
::Example: arhati → arahati, garhā → garahā, barhiṣ → barihisa
* There is sporadic epenthesis between other consonant sequences
::Examples: caitya → cetiya (not &quot;cecca&quot;), vajra → vajira (not &quot;vajja&quot;)

====Other changes====
* Any Sanskrit sibilant before a nasal becomes a sequence of nasal followed by h, i.e. ṣṇ, sn and sm become ṇh, nh, and mh
::Examples: tṛṣṇa → taṇha, uṣṇīṣa → uṇhīsa, asmi → amhi
* The sequence śn becomes ñh, due to assimilation of the n to the preceding palatal sibilant
::Example: praśna → praśña → pañha
* The sequences hy and hv undergo metathesis
::Examples: jihvā → jivhā, gṛhya → gayha, guhya → guyha
* h undergoes metathesis with a following nasal
::Example: gṛhṇāti → gaṇhāti
* y is geminated between e and a vowel
::Examples: śreyas → seyya, Maitreya → Metteyya
* Voiced aspirates such as bh and gh on rare occasions become h
::Examples: bhavati → hoti, -ebhiṣ → -ehi, laghu → lahu
* Dental and retroflex sounds sporadically change into one another
:: Examples: jñāna → ñāṇa (not &quot;ñāna&quot;), dahati → ḍahati (beside Pali dahati) nīḍa → nīla (not &quot;nīḷa&quot;), sthāna → ṭhāna (not &quot;thāna&quot;), duḥkṛta → dukkaṭa (beside Pali dukkata), granthi→ gaṇṭhi, pṛthivī → paṭhavī/puṭhuvī (beside Pali pathavī/puthuvī/puthavī)

===Exceptions===
There are several notable exceptions to the rules above; many of them are common Prakrit words rather than borrowings from Sanskrit.
* ārya (noble, pure) → ayya (beside ariya)
* guru (master) → garu (adj.) (beside guru (n.))
* puruṣa (man) → purisa (not &quot;purusa&quot;)
* vṛkṣa (tree) → rukṣa → rukkha (not &quot;vukkha&quot;)

==Writing==

Emperor Ashoka erected a number of pillars with his edicts in at least three regional Prakrit languages in Brahmi script, all of which are quite similar to Pali. Historically, the first written record of the Pali canon is believed to have been composed in Sri Lanka, based on a prior oral tradition. According to the Mahavamsa (the chronicle of Sri Lanka), due to a major famine in the country Buddhist monks wrote down the Pali canon during the time of King Vattagamini in 100 BCE. Bilingual coins containing Pali written in the Kharosthi script and Greek writing were used by James Prinsep to decipher the Kharosthi abugida. This script became particularly significant for the study of early Buddhism following the discovery of the Gandharan Buddhist texts.

The transmission of written Pali has retained a universal system of alphabetic values, but has expressed those values in a variety of different scripts. In the 1840s, Thai king Mongkut invented the Ariyaka script, adapted from the Greek and Burmese-Mon scripts, as a universal medium for transcribing Pali, intended to replace other existing regional scripts, including Khom Thai and Tai Tham. The script did not come into popular use. Theravada Buddhist-professing regions use distinct scripts to transcribe Pali:
* India: Devanāgarī, Ahom script
* Nepal: Pracalit script
* Bangladesh: Bengali, Chakma
* Sri Lanka: Sinhala
* Myanmar: Mon-Burmese, Lik-Tai (historically, Pyu script).
* Cambodia: Khmer
* Thailand: Thai (since 1893; historically Tai Tham, Khom Thai and Ariyaka script)
* Laos: Lao (since 1930; historically Tai Tham)

===Alphabet with diacritics===

Since the 19th century, Pali has also been written in the Roman script. An alternate scheme devised by Frans Velthuis, called the Velthuis scheme (see § Text in ASCII) allows for typing without diacritics using plain ASCII methods, but is arguably less readable than the standard IAST system, which uses diacritical marks.

The Pali alphabetical order is as follows:
* a ā i ī u ū e o ṃ k kh g gh ṅ c ch j jh ñ ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ t th d dh n p ph b bh m y r l ḷ v s h

ḷh, although a single sound, is written with ligature of ḷ and h.

=== Transliteration on computers ===

There are several fonts to use for Pali transliteration. However, older ASCII fonts such as Leedsbit PaliTranslit, Times_Norman, Times_CSX+, Skt Times, Vri RomanPali CN/CB etc., are not recommendable, they are deprecated, since they are not compatible with one another, and are technically out of date. Instead, fonts based on the Unicode standard are recommended.

However, not all Unicode fonts contain the necessary characters. To properly display all the diacritic marks used for romanized Pali (or for that matter, Sanskrit), a Unicode font must contain the following character ranges:

:* Basic Latin: U+0000 – U+007F
:* Latin-1 Supplement: U+0080 – U+00FF
:* Latin Extended-A: U+0100 – U+017F
:* Latin Extended-B: U+0180 – U+024F
:* Latin Extended Additional: U+1E00 – U+1EFF

Some Unicode fonts freely available for typesetting Romanized Pali are as follows:

The Velthuis scheme was originally developed in 1991 by Frans Velthuis for use with his &quot;devnag&quot; Devanāgarī font, designed for the TeX typesetting system. This system of representing Pali diacritical marks has been used in some websites and discussion lists. However, as the Web itself and email software slowly evolve towards the Unicode encoding standard, this system has become almost unnecessary and obsolete.

The following table compares various conventional renderings and shortcut key assignments:
== Influence on other languages ==
Pali has influenced the languages of mainland Southeast Asia and South Asia to various degrees, among them Burmese, Khmer, and Lao, Sinhala, and Thai.

In Cambodia, Pali replaced Sanskrit as a prestige language in the 13th century, coinciding with the spread of Theravada Buddhism there. Throughout the 1900s, Chuon Nath used Pali roots to coin Khmer neologisms to describe modern phenomena, such as the &#x27;train.&#x27; Similarly, in 20th century Thailand and Laos, local scholars, including Jit Bhumisak and Vajiravudh coined new words using Pali roots to describe foreign concepts and technological innovations.

In Myanmar, since its earliest stage as Old Burmese, the Burmese language has readily adopted thousands of loanwords from Pali, particularly in the domains of religion, government, arts, and science, whereas the adoption of Sanskrit loanwords has been confined to specialized subjects like astrology, astronomy, and medicine. The first to tenth ordinal numbers in Burmese are also directly borrowed form Pali. Burmese has a long history of using and repurposing Pali roots to coin Burmese neologisms well into the 20th century, including the words for &#x27;feudalism&#x27; (from Pali ), &#x27;organization&#x27; (from Pali ), and &#x27;leader&#x27; (from Pali ). Pali has also influenced Burmese grammatical structures, particularly in the literary register of Burmese. By the 13th century, the third person pronoun in Pali () had become grammaticized into the Burmese grammatical particle &quot;so&quot; (သော), which is still used to modify nouns, following Pali syntax. Until the 19th century, Burmese prose writing was heavily influenced by Pali texts, in particular &quot;nissaya&quot; texts that first emerged in the 15th century.

In Sri Lanka, Pali has enriched the Sinhala language since the Anuradhapura period, particularly in the realm of literature, as exemplified by the Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa chronicles, both written in Pali verse. Following the Anuradhapura period, Sanskrit became more influential in the development of Sinhala

<text>Frame Relay is a standardized wide area network (WAN) technology that specifies the physical and data link layers of digital telecommunications channels using a packet switching methodology.

Frame Relay was originally developed as a simplified version of the X.25 system designed to be carried over the emerging Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) networks. X.25 had been designed to operate over normal telephone lines that were subject to noise that would result in lost data, and the protocol featured extensive error correction to address this. ISDN offered dramatically lower error rates, in effect zero, and the extensive error correction overhead was no longer needed. The new protocol suite was essentially a cut-down X.25 with no error correction, leading to lower overhead, better channel efficiency, and often significantly overall higher performance than X.25.

Like X.25, Frame Relay is normally used in a circuit switched layout, where connections between two endpoints are long-term (in computer terms at least). This matches the normal use of the telephone network, which X.25 was designed to run on top of. This contrasts with protocols design to be short-term, like the internet protocol, where every packet might go to a different endpoint. In practice, Frame Relay was often used as a bridging mechanism to link together local area network (LAN) systems or devices with dedicated links to back-end systems. Users are provided with a connection that encapsulates their data (in some cases including voice in VoFR) and sends that to a Frame Relay node which then forwards that to another endpoint where it is injected into the remote network, appearing as if it were local traffic. It is less expensive than using leased lines for this purpose and that is one reason for its popularity. The extreme simplicity of configuring user equipment in a Frame Relay network offers another reason for Frame Relay&#x27;s popularity.

With the advent of Ethernet over fiber optics, MPLS, VPN and dedicated broadband services such as cable modem and DSL, Frame Relay has become less popular in recent years.

== Technical description ==
The designers of Frame Relay aimed to provide a telecommunication service for cost-efficient data transmission for intermittent traffic between local area networks (LANs) and between end-points in a wide area network (WAN). Frame Relay puts data in variable-size units called &quot;frames&quot; and leaves any necessary error-correction (such as retransmission of data) up to the end-points. This speeds up overall data transmission. For most services, the network provides a permanent virtual circuit (PVC), which means that the customer sees a continuous, dedicated connection without having to pay for a full-time leased line, while the service-provider figures out the route each frame travels to its destination and can charge based on usage.

An enterprise can select a level of service quality, prioritizing some frames and making others less important. Frame Relay can run on fractional T-1 or E1, or full T-carrier or E-carrier system carriers. Frame Relay complements and provides a mid-range service between basic rate ISDN, which offers bandwidth at 128 kbit/s, and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM), which operates in somewhat similar fashion to Frame Relay but at speeds from 155.520 Mbit/s to 622.080 Mbit/s.

Frame Relay has its technical base in the older X.25 packet-switching technology, designed for transmitting data on analog voice lines. Unlike X.25, whose designers expected analog signals with a relatively high chance of transmission errors, Frame Relay is a fast packet switching technology operating over links with a low chance of transmission errors (usually practically lossless like PDH), which means that the protocol does not attempt to correct errors. When a Frame Relay network detects an error in a frame, it simply drops that frame. The end points have the responsibility for detecting and retransmitting dropped frames. (However, digital networks offer an incidence of error extraordinarily small relative to that of analog networks.)

Frame Relay often serves to connect local area networks (LANs) with major backbones, as well as on public wide-area networks (WANs) and also in private network environments with leased lines over T-1 lines. It requires a dedicated connection during the transmission period. Frame Relay does not provide an ideal path for voice or video transmission, both of which require a steady flow of transmissions. However, under certain circumstances, voice and video transmission do use Frame Relay.

Frame Relay originated as an extension of integrated services digital network (ISDN). Its designers aimed to enable a packet-switched network to transport over circuit-switched technology. The technology has become a stand-alone and cost-effective means of creating a WAN.

Frame Relay switches create virtual circuits to connect remote LANs to a WAN. The Frame Relay network exists between a LAN border device, usually a router, and the carrier switch. The technology used by the carrier to transport data between the switches is variable and may differ among carriers (i.e., to function, a practical Frame Relay implementation need not rely solely on its own transportation mechanism).

The sophistication of the technology requires a thorough understanding of the terms used to describe how Frame Relay works. Without a firm understanding of Frame Relay, it is difficult to troubleshoot its performance.

Frame-relay frame structure essentially mirrors almost exactly that defined for LAP-D. Traffic analysis can distinguish Frame Relay format from LAP-D by its lack of a control field.

=== Protocol data unit ===
Each Frame Relay protocol data unit (PDU) consists of the following fields:

# Flag Field. The flag is used to perform high-level data link synchronization which indicates the beginning and end of the frame with the unique pattern 01111110. To ensure that the 01111110 pattern does not appear somewhere inside the frame, bit stuffing and destuffing procedures are used.
# Address Field. Each address field may occupy either octet 2 to 3, octet 2 to 4, or octet 2 to 5, depending on the range of the address in use. A two-octet address field comprises the EA=ADDRESS FIELD EXTENSION BITS and the C/R=COMMAND/RESPONSE BIT.
## DLCI-Data Link Connection Identifier Bits. The DLCI serves to identify the virtual connection so that the receiving end knows which information connection a frame belongs to. Note that this DLCI has only local significance. A single physical channel can multiplex several different virtual connections.
## FECN, BECN, DE bits. These bits report congestion:
##* FECN=Forward Explicit Congestion Notification bit
##* BECN=Backward Explicit Congestion Notification bit
##* DE=Discard Eligibility bit
# Information Field. A system parameter defines the maximum number of data bytes that a host can pack into a frame. Hosts may negotiate the actual maximum frame length at call set-up time. The standard specifies the maximum information field size (supportable by any network) as at least 262 octets. Since end-to-end protocols typically operate on the basis of larger information units, Frame Relay recommends that the network support the maximum value of at least 1600 octets in order to avoid the need for segmentation and reassembling by end-users.
# Frame Check Sequence (FCS) Field. Since one cannot completely ignore the bit error-rate of the medium, each switching node needs to implement error detection to avoid wasting bandwidth due to the transmission of &quot;err&quot;ed frames. The error detection mechanism used in Frame Relay uses the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) as its basis.

=== Congestion control ===
The Frame Relay network uses a simplified protocol at each switching node. It achieves simplicity by omitting link-by-link flow-control. As a result, the offered load has largely determined the performance of Frame Relay networks. When offered load is high, due to the bursts in some services, temporary overload at some Frame Relay nodes causes a collapse in network throughput. Therefore, Frame Relay networks require some effective mechanisms to control the congestion.

Congestion control in Frame Relay networks includes the following elements:

# Admission Control. This provides the principal mechanism used in Frame Relay to ensure the guarantee of resource requirement once accepted. It also serves generally to achieve high network performance. The network decides whether to accept a new connection request, based on the relation of the requested traffic descriptor and the network&#x27;s residual capacity. The traffic descriptor consists of a set of parameters communicated to the switching nodes at call set-up time or at service-subscription time, and which characterizes the connection&#x27;s statistical properties. The traffic descriptor consists of three elements:
# Committed Information Rate (CIR). The average rate (in bit/s) at which the network guarantees to transfer information units over a measurement interval T. This T interval is defined as: T = Bc/CIR.
# Committed Burst Size (BC). The maximum number of information units transmittable during the interval T.
# Excess Burst Size (BE). The maximum number of uncommitted information units (in bits) that the network will attempt to carry during the interval.

Once the network has established a connection, the edge node of the Frame Relay network must monitor the connection&#x27;s traffic flow to ensure that the actual usage of network resources does not exceed this specification. Frame Relay defines some restrictions on the user&#x27;s information rate. It allows the network to enforce the end user&#x27;s information rate and discard information when the subscribed access rate is exceeded.

Explicit congestion notification is proposed as the congestion avoidance policy. It tries to keep the network operating at its desired equilibrium point so that a certain quality of service (QoS) for the network can be met. To do so, special congestion control bits have been incorporated into the address field of the Frame Relay: FECN and BECN. The basic idea is to avoid data accumulation inside the network.

FECN means forward explicit congestion notification. The FECN bit can be set to 1 to indicate that congestion was experienced in the direction of the frame transmission, so it informs the destination that congestion has occurred.
BECN means backwards explicit congestion notification. The BECN bit can be set to 1 to indicate that congestion was experienced in the network in the direction opposite of the frame transmission, so it informs the &quot;sender&quot; that congestion has occurred.

==Origin==
Frame Relay began as a stripped-down version of the X.25 protocol, releasing itself from the error-correcting burden most commonly associated with X.25. When Frame Relay detects an error, it simply drops the offending packet. Frame Relay uses the concept of shared access and relies on a technique referred to as &quot;best-effort&quot;, whereby error-correction practically does not exist and practically no guarantee of reliable data delivery occurs. Frame Relay provides an industry-standard encapsulation, utilizing the strengths of high-speed, packet-switched technology able to service multiple virtual circuits and protocols between connected devices, such as two routers.
Although Frame Relay became very popular in North America, it was never very popular in Europe. X.25 remained the primary standard until the wide availability of IP made packet switching almost obsolete.
It was used sometimes as backbone for other services, such as X.25 or IP traffic. Where Frame Relay was used in the USA also as carrier for TCP/IP traffic, in Europe backbones for IP networks often used ATM or PoS, later replaced by Carrier Ethernet

===Relationship to X.25===

X.25 was an important early WAN protocol, and is often considered to be the grandfather of Frame Relay as many of the underlying protocols and functions of X.25 are still in use today (with upgrades) by Frame Relay.

X.25 provides quality of service and error-free delivery, whereas Frame Relay was designed to relay data as quickly as possible over low error networks. Frame Relay eliminates a number of the higher-level procedures and fields used in X.25. Frame Relay was designed for use on links with error-rates far lower than available when X.25 was designed.

X.25 prepares and sends packets, while Frame Relay prepares and sends frames. X.25 packets contain several fields used for error checking and flow control, most of which are not used by Frame Relay. The frames in Frame Relay contain an expanded link layer address field that enables Frame Relay nodes to direct frames to their destinations with minimal processing. The elimination of functions and fields over X.25 allows Frame Relay to move data more quickly, but leaves more room for errors and larger delays should data need to be retransmitted.

X.25 packet switched networks typically allocated a fixed bandwidth through the network for each X.25 access, regardless of the current load. This resource allocation approach, while apt for applications that require guaranteed quality of service, is inefficient for applications that are highly dynamic in their load characteristics or which would benefit from a more dynamic resource allocation. Frame Relay networks can dynamically allocate bandwidth at both the physical and logical channel level.

==Virtual circuits==
As a WAN protocol, Frame Relay is most commonly implemented at Layer 2 (data link layer) of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) seven layer model. Two types of circuits exist: permanent virtual circuits (PVCs) which are used to form logical end-to-end links mapped over a physical network, and switched virtual circuits (SVCs). The latter are analogous to the circuit-switching concepts of the public switched telephone network (PSTN), the global phone network.

==Local management interface==

Initial proposals for Frame Relay were presented to the Consultative Committee on International Telephone and Telegraph (CCITT) in 1984. Lack of interoperability and standardization prevented any significant Frame Relay deployment until 1990, when Cisco, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), Northern Telecom, and StrataCom formed a consortium to focus on its development. They produced a protocol that provided additional capabilities for complex inter-networking environments. These Frame Relay extensions are referred to as the local management interface (LMI).

Datalink connection identifiers (DLCIs) are numbers that refer to paths through the Frame Relay network. They are only locally significant, which means that when device-A sends data to device-B it will most likely use a different DLCI than device-B would use to reply. Multiple virtual circuits can be active on the same physical end-points (performed by using subinterfaces).

The LMI global addressing extension gives Frame Relay data-link connection identifier (DLCI) values global rather than local significance. DLCI values become DTE addresses that are unique in the Frame Relay WAN. The global addressing extension adds functionality and manageability to Frame Relay internetworks. Individual network interfaces and the end nodes attached to them, for example, can be identified by using standard address-resolution and discovery techniques. In addition, the entire Frame Relay network appears to be a typical LAN to routers on its periphery.

LMI virtual circuit status messages provide communication and synchronization between Frame Relay DTE and DCE devices. These messages are used to periodically report on the status of PVCs, which prevents data from being sent into black holes (that is, over PVCs that no longer exist).

The LMI multicasting extension allows multicast groups to be assigned. Multicasting saves bandwidth by allowing routing updates and address-resolution messages to be sent only to specific groups of routers. The extension also transmits reports on the status of multicast groups in update messages.

==Committed information rate==
Frame Relay connections are often given a committed information rate (CIR) and an allowance of burstable bandwidth known as the extended information rate (EIR). The provider guarantees that the connection will always support the C rate, and sometimes the PRa rate should there be adequate bandwidth. Frames that are sent in excess of the CIR are marked as &quot;discard eligible&quot; (DE) which means they can be dropped should congestion occur within the Frame Relay network. Frames sent in excess of the EIR are dropped immediately.

==Market reputation==
Frame Relay aimed to make more efficient use of existing physical resources, permitting the over-provisioning of data services by telecommunications companies to their customers, as clients were unlikely to be using a data service 45 percent of the time. In more recent years, Frame Relay has acquired a bad reputation in some markets because of excessive bandwidth overbooking.

Telecommunications companies often sell Frame Relay to businesses looking for a cheaper alternative to dedicated lines; its use in different geographic areas depended greatly on governmental and telecommunication companies&#x27; policies. Some of the early companies to make Frame Relay products included StrataCom (later acquired by Cisco Systems) and Cascade Communications (later acquired by Ascend Communications and then by Lucent Technologies).

As of June 2007, AT&amp;T was the largest Frame Relay service provider in the US, with local networks in 22 states, plus national and international networks.

==FRF.12==
When multiplexing packet data from different virtual circuits or flows, quality of service concerns often arise. This is because a frame from one virtual circuit may occupy the line for a long enough period of time to disrupt a service guarantee given to another virtual circuit. IP fragmentation is a method for addressing this. An incoming long packet is broken up into a sequence of shorter packets and enough information is added to reassemble that long frame at the far end. FRF.12 is a specification from the Frame Relay Forum which specifies how to perform fragmentation on frame relay traffic primarily for voice traffic. The FRF.12 specification describes the method of fragmenting Frame Relay frames into smaller frames.

<doc id="38341" wikidata="Q17298" url="?curid=38341" title="Harlequin">
<text>Harlequin (, , ; , ) is the best-known of the comic servant characters (Zanni) from the Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte, associated with the city of Bergamo. The role is traditionally believed to have been introduced by the Italian actor-manager Zan Ganassa in the late 16th century, was definitively popularized by the Italian actor Tristano Martinelli in Paris in 1584–1585, and became a stock character after Martinelli&#x27;s death in 1630.

The Harlequin is characterised by his checkered costume. His role is that of a light-hearted, nimble, and astute servant, often acting to thwart the plans of his master, and pursuing his own love interest, Columbine, with wit and resourcefulness, often competing with the sterner and melancholic Pierrot. He later develops into a prototype of the romantic hero. Harlequin inherits his physical agility and his trickster qualities, as well as his name, from a mischievous &quot;devil&quot; character in medieval Passion Plays.

The Harlequin character first appeared in Bergamo, Italy, early in the 17th century and took centre stage in the derived genre of the Harlequinade, developed in the early 18th century by John Rich. As the Harlequinade portion of the English dramatic genre pantomime developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character Clown. As developed by Joseph Grimaldi around 1800, Clown became the mischievous and brutish foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who became more of a romantic character. The most influential portrayers of the Harlequin character in Victorian England were William Payne and his sons the Payne Brothers, the latter active during the 1860s and 1870s.

==Origin of the name==

The name Harlequin is taken from that of a mischievous &quot;devil&quot; or &quot;demon&quot; character in popular French Passion Plays. It originates with an Old French term &quot;herlequin&quot;, &quot;hellequin&quot;, first attested in the 11th century, by the chronicler Orderic Vitalis, who recounts a story of a monk who was pursued by a troop of demons when wandering on the coast of Normandy, France, at night. These demons were led by a masked, club-wielding giant and they were known as &quot;familia herlequin&quot; (var. &quot;familia herlethingi&quot;). This medieval French version of the Germanic Wild Hunt, &quot;Mesnée d&#x27;Hellequin&quot;, has been connected to the English figure of &quot;Herla cyning&quot; (&#x27;host-king&#x27;; German: &quot;Erlkönig&quot;). Hellequin was depicted as a black-faced emissary of the devil, roaming the countryside with a group of demons chasing the damned souls of evil people to Hell. The physical appearance of Hellequin offers an explanation for the traditional colours of Harlequin&#x27;s red-and-black mask. The name&#x27;s origin could also be traced to a knight from the 9th century, Hellequin of Boulogne, who died fighting the Normans and originated a legend of devils. In Cantos XXI and XXII from Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; there is a devil by the name of Alichino. The similarities between the devil in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; and the Arlecchino are more than cosmetic. The prank-like antics of the devils in the aforementioned antics reflect some carnivalesque aspects.

The first known appearance on stage of Hellequin is dated to 1262, the character of a masked and hooded devil in &quot;Jeu da la Feuillière&quot; by Adam de la Halle, and it became a stock character in French passion plays.

==History==

The re-interpretation of the &quot;devil&quot; stock character as a Zanni character of the commedia dell&#x27;arte took place in the 16th century in France. Zan Ganassa, whose troupe is first mentioned in Mantua in the late 1560s, is one of the earliest known actors suggested to have performed the part, although there is &quot;little hard evidence to support [it]&quot;. Ganassa performed in France in 1571, and if he did play the part there, he left the field open for another actor to take up the role, when he took his troupe to Spain permanently in 1574.

Among the earliest depictions of the character are a Flemish painting () in the Museum of Bayeux and several woodblock prints probably dating from the 1580s in the Fossard collection, discovered by Agne Beijer in the 1920s among uncatalogued items in the Nationalmuseum, in Stockholm.
Tristano Martinelli is the first actor definitely known to have used the name &quot;Harlequin&quot; (or &quot;Arlequin&quot;) from French folklore and adapted it for the comic &quot;secondo&quot; Zanni role, and he probably first performed the part in France in (or just before) 1584 and only later did he bring the character to Italy, where he became known as Arlecchino. The motley costume is sometimes attributed to Martinelli, who wore a linen costume of colourful patches, and a hare-tail on his cap to indicate cowardice. Martinelli&#x27;s Harlequin also had a black leather half-mask, a moustache and a pointed beard. He was very successful, even playing at court and becoming a favourite of Henry IV of France, to whom he addressed insolent monologues (&quot;Compositions de Rhetorique de Mr. Don Arlequin&quot;, 1601).
Martinelli&#x27;s great success contributed to the perpetuation of his interpretation of the Zanni role, along with the name of his character, after his death in 1630, among others, by Nicolò Zecca, active in Bologna as well as Turin and Mantua.

The character was also performed in Paris at the Comédie-Italienne in Italian by Giambattista Andreini and Angelo Costantini () and in French as &quot;Arlequin&quot; in the 1660s by (1636–1688), who combined the Zanni types, &quot;making his Arlecchino witty, neat, and fluent in a croaking voice, which became as traditional as the squawk of Punch&quot;. 
The Italians were expelled from France in 1697 for satirizing King Louis XIV&#x27;s second wife, Madame de Maintenon, but returned in 1716 (after his death), when Tommaso Antonio Vicentini (&quot;Thomassin&quot;, 1682–1739) became famous in the part. The rhombus shape of the patches arose by adaptation to the Paris fashion of the 17th century by Biancolelli.

==Characteristics and dramatic function==
===Physicality===
The primary aspect of Arlecchino was his physical agility. He was very nimble and performed the sort of acrobatics the audience expected to see. The character would never perform a simple action when the addition of a cartwheel, somersault, or flip would spice up the movement.

Early characteristics of Arlecchino paint the character as a &quot;second&quot; Zanni servant from northern Italy with the paradoxical attributes of a dimwitted fool and an intelligent trickster. Arlecchino is sometimes referred to as putting on a show of stupidity in a metatheatrical attempt to create chaos within the play. Physically, Arlecchino is described as wearing a costume covered in irregular patches, a hat outfitted with either a rabbit or fox&#x27;s tail, and a red and black mask. The mask itself is identified by carbuncles on the forehead, small eyes, a snub nose, hollow cheeks, and sometimes bushy brows with facial hair. Arlecchino is often depicted as having a wooden sword hanging from a leather belt on his person, and sometimes holding a marotte (fool&#x27;s scepter).
Aside from his acrobatics, Arlecchino is also known for having several specific traits such as: 
* Appearing humpbacked without artificial padding
* The ability to eat large amounts of food quickly
* Using his wooden sword like a fan
* A parody of &quot;bel canto&quot;
and several other techniques.

===Speech===
One of the major distinctions of commedia dell&#x27;arte is the use of regional languages. Arlecchino&#x27;s speech evolved with the character. Originally speaking in a Bergamo dialect of Lombard language, the character adopted a mixture of French, Lombard and Italian dialects when the character became more of a fixture in France so as to help the performers connect to the common masses.

===Dramatic function===
Various troupes and actors would alter his behaviour to suit style, personal preferences, or even the particular &quot;scenario&quot; being performed. He is typically cast as the servant of an &quot;innamorato&quot; or &quot;vecchio&quot; much to the detriment of the plans of his master. Arleqin often had a love interest in the person of Columbine, or in older plays any of the soubrette roles, and his lust for her was only superseded by his desire for food and fear of his master. Occasionally, Harlequin would pursue the &quot;innamorata&quot;, although rarely with success, as in the &quot;Recueil Fossard&quot; of the 16th century where he is shown trying to woo Donna Lucia for himself by masquerading as a foreign nobleman. He also is known to try to win any given lady for himself if he chances upon anyone else trying to woo her, by interrupting or ridiculing the new competitor. His sexual appetite is essentially immediate, and can be applied to any passing woman.

Between the 16th and 17th centuries Harlequin gained some function as a politically aware character. In the &quot;Comédie-Italienne&quot; Harlequin would parody French tragedies as well as comment on current events.

==Variants==

Duchartre lists the following as variations on the Harlequin role:

Trivelino or Trivelin. Name is said to mean &quot;Tatterdemalion&quot;. One of the oldest versions of Harlequin, dating to the 15th century. Costume almost identical to Harlequin&#x27;s, but had a variation of the 17th century where the triangular patches were replaced with moons, stars, circles and triangles. In 18th century France, Trivelino was a distinct character from Harlequin. They appeared together in a number of comedies by Pierre de Marivaux including &quot;L&#x27;Île des esclaves&quot;.

Truffa, Truffaldin or Truffaldino. Popular characters with Gozzi and Goldoni, but said to be best when used for improvisations. By the 18th century was a Bergamask caricature.

Guazzetto. In the seventeenth century, a variety of anonymous engravings show Guazzetto rollicking, similar to Arleqin. He wears a fox&#x27;s brush, a large three-tiered collarette, wide breeches, and a loose jacket tied tightly by a belt. He also dons a neckerchief dropped over the shoulders like a small cape. Guazzetto&#x27;s mask is characterised with a hooked nose and a mustache. His bat is shaped like a scimitar-esque sword.

Zaccagnino. Character dating to the 15th century.

Bagatino. A juggler.

Pedrolino or Pierotto. A servant or valet clad in mostly white, created by Giovanni Pellesini.

==English harlequinade and pantomime==
The Harlequin character came to England early in the 17th century and took center stage in the derived genre of the Harlequinade, developed in the early 18th century by the Lincoln&#x27;s Fields Theatre&#x27;s actor-manager John Rich, who played the role under the name of Lun. He developed the character of Harlequin into a mischievous magician who was easily able to evade Pantaloon and his servants to woo Columbine. Harlequin used his magic batte or &quot;slapstick&quot; to transform the scene from the pantomime into the harlequinade and to magically change the settings to various locations during the chase scene. As the Harlequinade portion of English pantomime developed, Harlequin was routinely paired with the character Clown.

Two developments in 1800, both involving Joseph Grimaldi, greatly changed the pantomime characters. Grimaldi starred as Clown in Charles Dibdin&#x27;s 1800 pantomime, &quot;Peter Wilkins: or Harlequin in the Flying World&quot; at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre. For this elaborate production, Dibdin and Grimaldi introduced new costume designs. Clown&#x27;s costume was &quot;garishly colourful ... patterned with large diamonds and circles, and fringed with tassels and ruffs&quot;, instead of the tatty servant&#x27;s outfit that had been used for a century. The production was a hit, and the new costume design was copied by others in London. Later the same year, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, in &quot;Harlequin Amulet; or, The Magick of Mona.&quot; Harlequin was modified to become &quot;romantic and mercurial, instead of mischievous&quot;, leaving Grimaldi&#x27;s mischievous and brutish Clown as the &quot;undisputed agent&quot; of chaos, and the foil for the more sophisticated Harlequin, who retained and developed stylized dance poses during the 19th century. The most influential pair playing Harlequin and Clown in Victorian England were the Payne Brothers, active during the 1860s and 1870s, who contributed to the development of 20th-century &quot;slapstick&quot; comedy.

<text>Zanni (), Zani or Zane is a character type of commedia dell&#x27;arte best known as an astute servant and a trickster. The Zanni comes from the countryside and is known to be a &quot;dispossessed immigrant worker&quot;. Through time, the Zanni grew to be a popular figure who was first seen in &quot;commedia&quot; as early as the 14th century. The English word &quot;&quot; derives from this character. The longer the nose on the characters mask, the more foolish the character.

==Origin of the name==
The name &quot;Zanni&quot; (as well as &quot;Zuan&quot;) is a variant of the name &quot;Gianni&quot; and was common in the Lombard-Venetian countryside which provided most of the servants to the wealthy nobles and merchants of Venice. In Italian it is specifically a name of someone whose identity is not of any importance. It is one of the oldest characters in commedia dell&#x27;arte, but over the course of time became subdivided into a number of similar characters with more specific traits. These included Harlequin (Arlecchino), Pulcinella, Mezzettino and Truffaldino, as well as Beltrame and Brighella. Harlequin, for example, was more representative of a jester than an ordinary servant and was frequently depicted as very acrobatic. Zanni was shortened to Zan when used to provide further identification of an individual. For example, Zan Ganassa was the stage name of Alberto Naseli, who was one of the first actors specializing in Zanni roles to perform outside of Italy.

Overall, the Zanni in early commedia dell&#x27;arte is the name for the &#x27;carter&#x27;, which is the servant. The name Zanni became a &quot;technical term to define all of the servants&quot;.

===Variations===
Some characters in &quot;commedia&quot; that are derived from Zanni are Harlequin, Brighella, Scapino, Mescolino and Mezzettino, Scaramuccia (aka Scaramouche), Pulcinella, Pedrolino, Giangurgolo, Tartaglia, Trappolino, and Burratino.

==Characteristics==
The earliest literary evidence portrays Zanni as a servant of Pantalone. Of all of the &quot;commedia&quot; archetypes, Zanni&#x27;s survival instinct is the strongest. Zanni is also always hungry, which leads to a vision of Utopia where &quot;everything is comestible, reminiscent of the followers of gluttony in carnival processions&quot;. A Zanni also has an animistic view of the world in that he senses a spirit in everything, so it could be eaten. Zanni is ignorant, loutish, and has no self-awareness. The simple act of thinking does not seem to be natural to Zanni. He is a very faithful individual who prefers to live in the present day. Zanni never looks for a place to sleep; it just seems to happen to him often in situations where it shouldn&#x27;t, like a drunkard. Lastly, all of his reactions are completely emotional.

Zanni is born into an immigrant background and is known for performing both &quot;duty and necessity&quot; and also plays an active role in the &quot;game&quot; of breaking up and unifying relationships. Zanni is also known for his ability to scheme and manipulate. The role of Zanni is known as being a &quot;stupid genius&quot;; this contradiction prevents Zanni from approaching daily life in a rational manner. Zanni&#x27;s stupidity prevents him from performing simple tasks, while his genius gives him the ability to make the impossible possible.

==Two types of Zanni==
The evolution of the character Zanni was of two distinct types, one of the silly servant and the other of the cunning servant. These two components developed over the course of the history of the commedia dell&#x27;arte, and players began to specialize in the two types who were called &quot;first Zanni&quot; (cunning) and &quot;second Zanni&quot; (silly). Mezzetino and Brighella are examples of the first Zanni; Harlequin and Pulcinella are examples of the second. A scenario must always have at least two Zanni. 

The first Zanni is known to be clever and witty, and is known as &quot;il furbo&quot; (). The first Zanni can trick and cheat anyone whom they come across. It is a must that they are cynically sharp. The first Zanni is also known to be the go-between. The job of the first Zanni is to advance the action and give it some movement, with a slightly cynical twist. In some traditions, first Zanni are said to be from Val Brembana, in the province of Bergamo; in others they are attributed to the upper city of Bergamo. 

The second Zanni is known as &quot;lo stupido&quot;. The second Zanni must be foolish, clumsy, and dull. The second Zanni is also unable to tell his right hand from his left. He is a dull-witted peasant who can be simple and also ridiculous. Second Zanni, in particular with Harlequin, does not so much advance plot as maintain a steady stream of comic relief throughout the scenario. Second Zanni are assumed to be from the lower city of Bergamo. Between the two of them they make up one person of &quot;less than average intelligence&quot;. Before developing this dualistic person of the two types of clever and silly servant, Zanni was a character in its own right.

==Actors==
The performance of a &quot;commedia&quot; actor relies on the acting itself. A scenario should be playable in different ways and seem different each time the audience sees it. The actors who play Zanni must be clever and equally talented, because an actor&#x27;s success relies primarily on their dialogue partner. If the partner does not reply to them at the right moment or interrupts them in the wrong place, the actor&#x27;s &quot;discourse falters and the liveliness of their wit is extinguished&quot;. He must be acrobatic, able to walk on his hands and on stilts, dance, skip and somersault. In this respect, the Zanni is one of the most physically demanding of all the Masks.

==Costume and mask==

The Zanni&#x27;s costume usually consists of white baggy clothing. This clothing was traditionally made out of flour sacks. This was similar to the dress of peasants and farmworkers of the time. A specific type of Zanni, Brighella, wore accents of green to indicate his tricky and devious nature. Harlequin, however, was known for his irregular colored patches that eventually became the essence of the entire outfit. The Zanni are also known to sport a peaked hat and a wooden sword. The Zanni at first wore a full faced carnival mask, but because of the need for dialogue between Pantalone and the Zanni, the bottom of the mask was hinged and eventually cut away altogether. The longer the nose of the Zanni, the stupider he is said to be.

==Stance==
The stance of Zanni has a &quot;lowered centre of gravity&quot; either from the earth or from carrying heavy bags and chairs. Zanni&#x27;s back is arched when he stands up and his knees are bent and apart with splayed feet. The support knee is bent and the other leg is extended with his toe pointed. He switches his feet a lot while speaking or listening within the same position, and without his head moving up and down. Zanni&#x27;s elbows are usually bent and arms half lifted. Zanni also has a variety of poses. These include crouching with the elbows on the knees and the chin in the hands, or sitting with the feet splayed bending at the hips with the elbows slightly elevated.

==Six types of walks==
In &quot;commedia&quot;, Zanni has a variety of at least six different types of walks. These walks include The Little Zanni, The Big Zanni, Zanni Running, Zanni Jubilant, Vain Zanni, and Soldier Zanni.

The Little Zanni walk is a development of a basic stance. The Zanni&#x27;s feet are constantly changing but on each shift, The Zanni takes a tiny step forward. The feet are to be pointed, shoulders down, and elbows forward. The Zanni&#x27;s knees come high off of the ground and to the side. The Zanni&#x27;s head is to peck like a chicken, but the Zanni have to be sure not to bob their head up and down. A two-time rhythm is used with even beats.

The Big Zanni walk includes sticking the chest forward and the backside up. The feet need to be in fourth extended with the knees bent. The Zanni has to lower his center of gravity. This walk can be used by a Zanni when he pretends to cross the stage without being seen or when he wants to get himself out of a difficult situation.

Zanni Running includes swift movements with legs kicking out in front of him with his toes pointed. His arms move opposite to his legs.

Zanni Jubilant involves skipping on his toes with his center of gravity moving from side to side. This type of walk also involves the hands being placed on the belt.

Vain Zanni&#x27;s steps are a smaller version of the Big Zanni walk with the hands placed on the belt as seen in the Zanni Jubilant. When the Zanni&#x27;s leg lifts, his chest is forward and his arms are in the position of a chicken. This type of walk is used when the Zanni has a &quot;...new button or a feather on his cap&quot;.

Soldier Zanni holds a stick in one hand and inclines it over his shoulder like he is holding a rifle. The Zanni marches with his shoulders moving up and down in a two-time rhythm but in three beats: &quot;tramper-tramp, tramper-tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp...&quot;.

==Speech==
The Zanni is loud and his voice is coarse due to making a living outdoors trying to be heard in a market or busy street. Zanni is also known to be vocal with sounds including farting, burping, and snoring.

The following sample dialogue shows how the Zanni uses his speech in &quot;commedia&quot;:

:Pantalone: Zanni, I want you to earn yourself a sovereign.
:Zanni: A gold coin?
:Pantalone: A gold castle.
:Zanni: Ah, right (He lies down and falls asleep).
:Pantalone: Zanni, wake up you animal and come here.
:Zanni (rising): At your service, boss, as always.
:Pantalone: Dear Zanni, take the sonnet.
:Zanni: Give me the sovereign first.
:Pantalone: I will give it to you.
:Zanni: Where is it, then?
:Pantalone: It&#x27;s there.
:Zanni: Show it to me.
:Pantalone: There it is.
::&quot;(Zanni tries to snatch the coin but Pantalone grabs it back at the last moment)&quot;
:Zanni: Darn!
:Pantalone: It&#x27;s yours.
:Zanni: How can it be mine since you’ve got it?
:Pantalone: Trust me, my dear Zanni; take the sonnet and I will give it to you.
==&quot;Lazzi&quot;==
A &quot;lazzo&quot; is a joke or gag in mime or in words.

The following &quot;lazzi&quot; examples are short comic routines by the character type Zanni.

In &quot;Lazzi of the Cat&quot; the Zanni mimics the actions of a cat, demonstrating how the cat hunts for wild birds or how the cat cleans himself by scratching his ears with his feet and cleaning his body with his mouth.

Sexual / Scatological Lazzi: in &quot;Lazzi of Burying the Urine&quot;, the Zanni is told that burying his urine and the urine produced by his wife will give him a son. Zanni gets a urinal that produces both and before he spills it into the soil, he treats it as a special fluid.

Stupidity/ Inappropriate Behavior: in &quot;Lazzi of Counting Money&quot;, the Zanni divides Pantalone&#x27;s money between Pantalone and himself in the following way: &quot;One for Pantalone, two for me (gives one coin to Pantalone and two to himself); two for Pantalone, three for me (gives one coin to Pantalone and three to himself), etc.&quot;

Another popular &quot;lazzi&quot; was Zanni walking behind his master mounted on a mule and goading it to go faster by blowing air from a pair of bellows onto the animal&#x27;s anus.

==Props==
A Zanni is known to take and briefly keep items that belong to someone else. Some items that the Zanni would keep would be bags, letters, valuables, or food.

==Relationship with the audience==
Zanni&#x27;s relationship to the audience is that he is the most sympathetic character and treats the audience collectively so he is able to address the audience directly. Zanni contributes to the plot by being the &quot;principal contributor to any confusion&quot;.

<text>George Shipway (25 May 1908 – 1982) was a British author best known for his historical novels, but he also tried his hand at political satire in his book &quot;The Chilian Club&quot;.

==Military career==
George Frederick Morgan Shipway was born on 25 May 1908 at Allahabad in India and was educated at Clifton. He then attended the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned on to the Unattached List for the Indian Army on 30 August 1928. He arrived in India on 5 October 1928 and was attached to a British regiment: the 2nd Battalion The Prince of Wales&#x27;s Volunteers (South Lancashire), for one year from 14 October 1928. This was a standard practice, intended to enable junior officers on the Unattached List to gain practical military experience in an Indian environment before joining their regiments.

After his year Shipway was posted to the 13th Duke of Connaught&#x27;s Own Lancers on 20 November 1929. Shipway was later to wryly claim that his motive in joining an Indian cavalry regiment was to give him the opportunity to play polo on a regular basis.

He spent two years (1936–1938) as Adjutant of the Mekran Levy Corps. After attending the Quetta Staff college in 1940–41 he became a General Staff Officer, 3rd grade at General Headquarters, India. He remained on the staff until 1944 when he was posted to serve with the Hyderabad Lancers, an Indian State Forces unit.

Shipway retired as a Major and honorary Lieutenant-Colonel on 9 January 1948, following Indian independence. After retiring he became a teacher at Cheam School in Berkshire for 19 years before becoming a novelist at the age of 60.

==Novels==
Shipway&#x27;s cavalry background served him well when he took up writing; his descriptions of cavalry battles are full of minute detail and his works generally were meticulously researched. His first novel &quot;Imperial Governor&quot; (1968) made use of both his military and teaching knowledge to analyse the character of the Roman general Suetonius Paulinus, who suppressed Boudicca&#x27;s rebellion of AD 60. Other novels dealt with pre-classical Greek, medieval and Indian historical themes.

In his 1969 novel &quot;Knight in Anarchy&quot; Shipway describes the life of Humphrey de Visdelou as he follows Geoffrey de Mandeville to his doom. In the book Shipway indicates that he lives on the estates that de Visdelou once owned. The Vis de Lou family certainly held lands in Berkshire post-Conquest.

Shipway died in 1982.

<doc id="38346" wikidata="Q915623" url="?curid=38346" title="Brighella">
<text>Brighella (Bergamasque dialect: &quot;Brighèla&quot;) is a comic, masked character from the Italian theatre style commedia dell&#x27;arte. His early costume consisted of loosely fitting, white smock and pants with green trim and was often equipped with a &#x27; (also&#x27; or &quot;&quot;, depending on region) or slapstick, or else with a wooden sword. Later, he took to wearing a sort of livery with a matching cape. He wore a greenish half-mask (traditionally olive-green) displaying a look of preternatural lust and greed. It is distinguished by a hook nose and thick lips, along with a thick twirled mustache to give him an offensive characteristic. He evolved out of the general Zanni, as evidenced by his costume, and came into his own around the start of the 16th century.

He is loosely categorized as one of the Zanni or servant characters, although he often was portrayed as a member of the middle class, such as a tavern owner: his character could be adapted to whatever the needs to the scenario might be, just as Brighella himself is adaptable to any circumstance. He is essentially Harlequin&#x27;s smarter and much more vindictive older brother. They both share the same traditional birthplace: Bergamo, a city in northern Italy. As in a stereotype of those who have risen from poverty, he is often most cruel to those beneath him on the social ladder; he even goes so far as to kill on occasion. In later versions of his character these violent and malicious traits were lessened substantially. Pierre Louis Duchartre, in his &quot;The Italian Comedy&quot;, theorizes that in France, the gentrified Brighella eventually culminated in the character of Figaro, known from the plays and operas.

Brighella is a masterful liar, and can make up a spur-of-the moment lie for any situation. He is an inveterate schemer, and he is good at what he does. If his plans failed, it was almost always out of luck on behalf of the other characters. When he is a servant, he will either serve his master devotedly or look for every opportunity to ruin and take advantage of him as he happens to see fit—whatever will gain the greatest advantage for himself and himself alone. He is fond of money, but spends it rapidly, and tends to be especially fond of the drink. In fact, he has few good qualities, save for his ability to entertain the audience.

His walk is distinguishable from the traditional Zanni movement by the torso bending from side to side, while the head stays vertical. The knees stay open and the elbows bend down with each movement of the leg.

His character is usually from uptown Milano or Bergamo, and in the original Italian would often speak with the local accent. He could be very witty and fond of wordplay. He is also an accomplished singer, dancer and musician, and sometimes would play the guitar on stage.

His name comes from an Italian word which can mean &#x27;bother&#x27; or &#x27;contention&#x27;; &quot;Florio&#x27;s 1611 Italian-English Dictionary&quot; defines &quot;briga&quot; as meaning &#x27;a brable, a braule, a contention&#x27;. Brighella in English would be therefore something like &#x27;Fighty&#x27; or &#x27;Brawly&#x27;. The other Italian word &quot;attaccabrighe&quot; (&#x27;hellraiser&#x27;) utilizes the same element.

==Famous Brighellas==
17th century:
* Domenico Boroncini

18th century:
* Giuseppe Antonio Angeleri
* Tommaso Fortunati
* Pietro Gandini
* Carlo Campi
* Atanasio Zanoni

==Variants==
A list of variations of the character, according to Duchartre, are:

*Beltrame: from the 17th century, a &quot;wilfully blind husband and rascal as crafty as Brighella&quot;. He was Milanese and spoke the local dialect. As part of his costume, he apparently wore a distinctive large tunic.
*Scapin, or Scapino: a much more nervous and cowardly version of Brighella.
*Truccagnino: see Fenocchio.
*Mezzetino: a gentler version of Brighella, fond of the ladies even if they were not fond of him.
*Fenocchio: more prone to playing pranks than committing serious intrigues, he otherwise shared Brighella&#x27;s fondness for malice.
*Flautino: a musical Brighella, often singing a cappella. The Comédie-Italienne actor Giovanni Gherardi, who performed this role, was able to perform the part of an entire orchestra with his voice alone.
*Sbrigani: sometimes the exact opposite of Brighella, otherwise an identical character; like twins. Frequently appeared alongside Brighella onstage.
*Franca Trippa, Francatrippa or Francatrippe: created in the late 16th century, spoke a mixture of Bolognese and Tuscan dialects. An upper-class Brighella. Could be capable of gymnastic or other physical feats. 
*Turlupin or Tirelupin: a French Brighella created by Henri Legrand. The name means, according to Duchartre, &#x27;unlucky&#x27;. However, the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; mentions an etymology relating to a cult that modelled themselves on the Cynics and lived off of &quot;lupins&quot; that they gathered (&quot;tiraient&quot;). The character was reputedly fond of vulgar wordplay. 
*Gandolin: a French Brighella, very fond of wordplay and puns. Sometimes wears a fur-lined plumed hat.
*Fritellino or Fristelin: see Francatrippa. 
*Sgnarelle: a chronic drunk.
*Bagatino 
*Gradelino 
*Pasquariel 
*Buffet 
*Gian Fritello 
*Narcisino 
*Grattelard 
*Mascarille 
*La Montagne 
*Frontin 
*Labranche 
*Figaro: as created by Beaumarchais. See &quot;Le Barbier de Séville&quot;.

<doc id="38348" wikidata="Q17302" url="?curid=38348" title="Columbine (stock character)">
<text>Columbine (Italian: Colombina; French: Colombine; ) is a stock character in the commedia dell&#x27;arte. She is Harlequin&#x27;s mistress, a comic servant playing the tricky slave type, and wife of Pierrot. Rudlin and Crick use the Italian spelling Colombina in &quot;Commedia dell&#x27;Arte: A Handbook for Troupes&quot;.

==History==
The role of the female servant was originally that of an entr&#x27;acte dancer. Women were not allowed to be part of the story that was being played out on stage, but they were allowed to have a dance in-between the action. Eventually these women became the buxom and gossipy servants of characters that were already allowed on stage, and then, later, the counterparts to the Zanni characters. Columbine was very down to earth and could always see the situation for what it actually was. She was also sometimes portrayed as a prostitute. She was very infrequently without something to say to or about someone.

She is dressed in a very short ragged and patched dress, appropriate to a master of the arts. These characters were usually played unmasked, but with bonnets and metal chokers. She was also known to wear heavy makeup around her eyes and carry a tambourine, which she could use to fend off the amorous advances of Pantalone. Columbine was sometimes chased after by Harlequin (Arlecchino) or was close friends with him. There is record of Columbine using numerous disguises to trick or seduce Harlequin. Where most other characters are content with one disguise, Gheraldi&#x27;s Columbine has several different disguises to confuse Harlequin and to keep the audience on their toes. 

She was sometimes the only functional intellect on the stage, but not always. Columbine aided her mistress, the &quot;innamorata&quot;, to gain the affections of her one true love. She is sometimes the lover of Harlequin, but not always. They sometimes engage in sexual activity, but not always. She may be a flirtatious and impudent character, indeed a soubrette.

In the &quot;verismo&quot; opera &quot;Pagliacci&quot; by Ruggero Leoncavallo, the head of the troupe&#x27;s wife, Nedda, playing as Columbine, cheats on her husband, Canio, playing as Pierrot, both onstage with Harlequin and offstage with Silvio.

Although Columbine is one name associated with the female servant prostitute character archetype, other names under which the same character is played in commedia dell&#x27;arte performances include Franceschina, Smeraldina, Oliva, Nespola, Spinetta Ricciolina, and Corallina Diamantina. Colombina became the most common name used to describe the &quot;sobretta&quot; character, especially as Colombine in France and Columbine in England.

One of the actresses who made this character famous was Silvia Roncagli, the first woman recorded doing a seretta role named Francheschina in about 1570. One of the first women to play the role named Colombina was Italian actress Isabella Franchini Biancolelli. Her granddaughter, Caterina Biancolelli, was one of the most famous serettas whose name was Colombina. She played the part about 1683.

There is record of the French playwright Molière having attended many performances of the Comédie-Italienne, or commedia dell&#x27;arte. He is even referenced in a performance by Angelo Costantini of his show &quot;Une Vie de Scaramouche&quot;, which refers to the writer and poet. This might suggest that the servant character in many of Molière&#x27;s plays, such as Dorine in his play &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, might be based on this particular character archetype from the commedia dell&#x27;arte.

<text>A rapier () is a type of sword originally used in Spain (known as &quot;&quot; -) and Italy (known as &quot;spada da lato a striscia&quot;). The name designates a sword with a straight, slender and sharply pointed two-edged long blade wielded in one hand. It was widely popular in Western Europe throughout the 16th and 17th centuries as a symbol of nobility or gentleman status.

It is called because it was carried as an accessory to clothing, generally used for fashion and as a weapon for dueling, self-defense and as a military side arm. Its name is of Spanish origin and appears recorded for the first time in the &quot;&quot;, by Juan de Mena, written approximately between 1445 and 1450:

As Fencing spread throughout Western Europe, important sources for rapier fencing arose in Spain, known under the term (&quot;dexterity&quot;), in Italy and France. The French small sword or court sword of the 18th century was a direct continuation of this tradition of fencing.

Rapier fencing forms part of Historical European Martial Arts.

==Terminology==
The origin of the name &#x27;rapier&#x27; is Spanish. Its name is a &quot;derisive&quot; description of the Spanish term . The Spanish term refers to a sword used with clothes (, ), due to it being used as an accessory for clothing, usually for fashion and as a self-defense weapon. The English term &quot;rapier&quot; comes from the French and appears both in English and German, near-simultaneously, in the mid-16th century, for a light, long, pointed two-edged sword. It is a loan from Middle French , first recorded in 1474, a nickname meaning .

The 16th-century German described what was considered a foreign weapon, imported from Spain, Italy, and France. Du Cange in his Middle Latin dictionary cites a form from a Latin text of 1511. He envisages a derivation . Adelung in his 1798 dictionary records a double meaning for the German verb : on one hand, and on the other.

The terms used by the Spanish, Italian and French masters during the heyday of this weapon were simply the equivalent of &quot;sword&quot;, i.e. , spada and (). When it was necessary to specify the type of sword the Spanish used . The name was registered for the first time in las Coplas de la panadera, by Juan de Mena, written between 1445 and 1450 approximately.

Clements (1997) categorizes thrusting swords with poor cutting abilities as rapiers, and swords with both good thrusting and cutting abilities as cut-and-thrust swords.

The term &quot;rapier&quot; is also applied by archaeologists to an unrelated type of Bronze Age sword.

== Description ==
The word &quot;rapier&quot; generally refers to a relatively long-bladed sword characterized by a protective hilt which is constructed to provide protection for the hand wielding the sword. Some historical rapier samples also feature a broad blade mounted on a typical rapier hilt. The term &quot;rapier&quot; can be confusing because this hybrid weapon can be categorized as a type of broadsword. While the rapier blade might be broad enough to cut to some degree (but nowhere near that of the wider swords in use around the Middle Ages such as the longsword), it is designed to perform quick and nimble thrusting attacks. The blade might be sharpened along its entire length or sharpened only from the center to the tip (as described by Capoferro). Pallavicini, a rapier master in 1670, strongly advocated using a weapon with two cutting edges. A typical example would weigh and have a relatively long and slender blade of or less in width, or more in length and ending in a sharply pointed tip. The blade length of quite a few historical examples, particularly the Italian rapiers in the early 17th century, is well over and can even reach .

The term &quot;rapier&quot; generally refers to a thrusting sword with a blade longer and thinner than that of the so-called side-sword but much heavier than the small sword, a lighter weapon that would follow in the 18th century and later, but the exact form of the blade and hilt often depends on who is writing and when. It can refer to earlier and the similar &quot;espada ropera&quot;, through the high rapier period of the 17th century through the small sword and duelling swords; thus context is important in understanding what is meant by the word. (The term side-sword, used among some modern historical martial arts reconstructionists, is a translation from the Italian —a term coined long after the fact by Italian museum curators—and does not refer to the slender, long rapier, but only to the early 16th-century Italian sword with a broader and shorter blade that is considered both its ancestor and contemporary.)

== Parts of the sword ==

=== Hilt ===
Rapiers often have complex, sweeping hilts designed to protect the hand wielding the sword. Rings extend forward from the crosspiece. In some later samples, rings are covered with metal plates, eventually evolving into the cup hilts of many later rapiers. There were hardly any samples that featured plates covering the rings prior to the 1600s. Many hilts include a knuckle bow extending down from the crosspiece protecting the grip, which was usually wood wrapped with cord, leather or wire. A large pommel (often decorated) secures the hilt to the weapon and provides some weight to balance the long blade.
=== Blade ===
Various rapier masters divided the blade into two, three, four, five or even nine parts. The forte, strong, is that part of the blade closest to the hilt; in cases where a master divides the blade into an even number of parts, this is the first half of the blade. The , weak, is the part of the blade which includes the point and is the second half of the blade when the sword is divided into an even number of parts. However, some rapier masters divided the blade into three parts (or even a multiple of three), in which case the central third of the blade, between the forte and the debole, was often called the medio, mezzo or the terzo. Others used four divisions (Fabris) or even 12 (Thibault).

The ricasso is the rear portion of the blade, usually unsharpened. It extends forward from the crosspiece or quillion and then gradually integrates into the thinner and sharper portion of the blade.

=== Overall length ===
There was historical disagreement over how long the ideal rapier should be, with some masters, such as Thibault, denigrating those who recommended longer blades; Thibault&#x27;s own recommended length was such that the cross of the sword be level with the navel (belly button) when standing naturally with the point resting on the ground. A small number of rapiers with extending blades were made, of which four survive in modern collections. The purpose of the ability is unclear, with suggestions including trying to gain the advantage of surprise in a duel or an attempt to get around laws limiting weapon length.

== Off-hand weapons ==
Rapiers are single-handed weapons and they were often employed with off-hand bucklers, daggers, cloaks and even second swords to assist with defense. A buckler is a small round shield that was used with other blades as well, such as the arming sword. Capo Ferro&#x27;s &quot;Gran Simulacro&quot; depicts use of the weapon with the rotella, which is a significantly bigger shield compared with the buckler. Nevertheless, using the rapier with a parrying dagger is the most common practice, and it has been arguably considered as the most suited and effective accompanying weapon for the rapier.

Even though the slender blade of a rapier enables the user to launch a quick attack at a fairly long and advantaged distance between the user and the opponent, and the protective hilt can deflect the opponent&#x27;s blade, the thrust-oriented weapon is weakened by its bated cutting power and relatively low maneuverability at a closer distance, where the opponent has safely passed the reach of the rapier&#x27;s deadly point.

Therefore, some close-range protection for the user needs to be ensured if the user intends to use the rapier in an optimal way, especially when the opponent uses some slash-oriented sword like a sabre or a broadsword. A parrying dagger not only enables the users to defend in this scenario in which the rapier is not very good at protecting the user, but also enables them to attack in such close distance.

== History ==
The &quot;espada ropera&quot; of the 16th century was a cut-and-thrust civilian weapon for self-defense and the duel, while earlier weapons were equally at home on the battlefield. Throughout the 16th century, a variety of new, single-handed civilian weapons were being developed. In 1570, the Italian master Rocco Bonetti first settled in England advocating the use of the rapier for thrusting as opposed to cutting or slashing when engaged in a duel. Nevertheless, the English word &quot;rapier&quot; generally refers to a primarily thrusting weapon, developed by the year 1600 as a result of the geometrical theories of such masters as Camillo Agrippa, Ridolfo Capo Ferro, and Vincentio Saviolo.

The rapier became extremely fashionable throughout Europe with the wealthier classes, but was not without its detractors. Some people, such as George Silver, disapproved of its technical potential and the dueling use to which it was put.

Allowing for fast reactions, and with a long reach, the rapier was well suited to civilian combat in the 16th and 17th centuries. As military-style cutting and thrusting swords continued to evolve to meet needs on the battlefield, the rapier continued to evolve to meet the needs of civilian combat and decorum, eventually becoming lighter, shorter and less cumbersome to wear. This is when the rapier began to give way to the colichemarde, which was itself later superseded by the small sword which was later superseded by the épée. Noticeably, there were some &quot;war rapiers&quot; that feature a relatively wide blade mounted on a typical rapier hilt during this era. These hybrid swords were used in the military, even on the battlefield. The sword carried by King Gustavus Adolphus in the Thirty Years&#x27; War is a typical example of the &quot;war rapier&quot;.

By the year 1715, the rapier had been largely replaced by the lighter small sword throughout most of Europe, although the former continued to be used, as evidenced by the treatises of Donald McBane (1728), P. J. F. Girard (1736) and Domenico Angelo (1787). The rapier is still used today by officers of the Swiss Guard of the pope.

=== The classical fencing tradition ===
Classical fencing schools claim to have inherited aspects of rapier forms in their systems. In 1885, fencing scholar Egerton Castle wrote &quot;there is little doubt that the French system of fencing can be traced, at its origin, to the ancient Italian swordsmanship; the modern Italian school being of course derived in an uninterrupted manner from the same source.&quot; Castle went on to note that &quot;the Italians have preserved the rapier form, with cup, pas d&#x27;ane, and quillons, but with a slender quadrangular blade.&quot;

<doc id="38361" wikidata="Q1363130" url="?curid=38361" title="Great Barrier Island">
<text>Great Barrier Island () lies in the outer Hauraki Gulf, New Zealand, north-east of central Auckland. With an area of it is the sixth-largest island of New Zealand and fourth-largest in the main chain. Its highest point, Mount Hobson, is above sea level. The local authority is the Auckland Council.

The island was initially exploited for its minerals and kauri trees and saw only limited agriculture. In 2013, it was inhabited by 939 people, mostly living from farming and tourism and all living off-the-grid. The majority of the island (around 60% of the total area) is administered as a nature reserve by the Department of Conservation. The island atmosphere is sometimes described as being &quot;life in New Zealand many decades back&quot;.

==Etymology==

The Māori name of the island is &quot;Aotea&quot;. It received its English name from Captain Cook because it acts as a barrier between the Pacific Ocean and the Hauraki Gulf. Entrance to the Hauraki Gulf is via two channels, one on each side of the island. Colville Channel separates the southernmost point, Cape Barrier, from Cape Colville at the northern tip of the Coromandel Peninsula to the south, Cradock Channel from the smaller Little Barrier Island to the west. The island protects the Hauraki Gulf from the ocean surface waves and the currents of the South Pacific Gyre. It is not a sandbar barrier, often defined as the correct use of the term. The island&#x27;s English name stems from its location on the outskirts of the Hauraki Gulf.

==Geography==

With an area of , Great Barrier Island is the sixth-largest island in New Zealand after the South Island, the North Island, Stewart Island / Rakiura, Chatham Island, and Auckland Island. The highest point, Mount Hobson or &quot;Hirakimatā&quot;, is above sea level.

Great Barrier is surrounded by several smaller islands, including Kaikoura Island, Rakitu Island, Aiguilles Island and Dragon Island. A number of islands are located in Great Barrier bays, including Motukahu Island, Nelson Island, Kaikoura Island, Broken Islands, Motutaiko Island, Rangiahua Island, Little Mahuki Island, Mahuki Island and Junction Islands.

With a maximum length (north-south) of some , it and the Coromandel Peninsula (directly to its south) protect the Gulf from the storms of the Pacific Ocean to the east. Consequently, the island boasts highly contrasting coastal environments. The eastern coast comprises long, sandy beaches, windswept sand-dunes, and at times heavy surf. The western coast, sheltered and calm, is home to hundreds of tiny, secluded bays which offer some of the best diving and boating in the country. The inland holds several large and biologically diverse wetlands, along with rugged hill country (bush or heath in the more exposed heights), as well as old-growth and regenerating kauri forests.

==Geology and natural history==

Much of Great Barrier Island is formed from remnants of volcanoes associated with the Coromandel Volcanic Zone. The North Great Barrier Volcano, which was centred to the north of the modern island from Whangapoua Bay northwards, formed through events between 18 and 17 million years ago; some of the earliest vulcanism which occurred in the zone. The Great Barrier Volcano formed to the west of the modern island between 15 and 12 million years ago. Much of the modern island is this volcano&#x27;s eroded eastern flanks. The third volcano, Mount Hobson, is the caldera of a complex rhyolite dome volcano, which was active between 12 and 8 million years ago.

Great Barrier Island has been linked to the North Island for most of the last 18 million years, by a land bridge to the south along the Colville Channel. Approximately 17,000 years ago during the Last Glacial Maximum, the Hauraki Gulf was a low-lying coastal plain as sea levels were over 100 metres lower than present day levels. During this period, Great Barrier Island was bordered by the two major river systems that flowed on the plain. Over the past two million years, Great Barrier has periodically been an island and a peninsula.

==History and culture==
Great Barrier Island (Aotea) is the ancestral land of Ngāti Rehua Ngātiwai ki Aotea who are the tangata whenua (people of the land) and mana whenua (territorial land rights holders) of Aotea. Ngāti Rehua have occupied Aotea since the 17th century after conquering Aotea from people of Ngāti Manaia and Kawerau descent. In the mid-19th century during the early Colonial era of New Zealand, extensive private and crown land purchases meant only two areas of the Hauraki Gulf remained in Māori ownership: Te Huruhi (Surfdale) on Waiheke Island (2100 acres) on Waiheke and a 3,510 acre parcel of land at Katherine Bay on Great Barrier Island.

===Local industries===

==== Mining ====
Early European interest followed discovery of copper in the remote north, where New Zealand&#x27;s earliest mines were established at Miners Head in 1842. Traces of these mines remain, largely accessible only by boat. Later, gold and silver were found in the Okupu / Whangaparapara area in the 1890s, and the remains of a stamping battery on the Whangaparapara Road are a remainder of this time. The sound of the battery working was reputedly audible from the Coromandel Peninsula, 20 km away.

In early 2010, a government proposal to remove 705 ha of land on the Te Ahumatā Plateau (called &quot;White Cliffs&quot; by the locals) from Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act, which gives protection from the mining of public land, was widely criticised. Concerns were that mining for the suspected $4.3 billion in mineral worth in the area would damage both the conservation land as well as the island&#x27;s tourism economy. Locals were split on the project, some hoping for new jobs. If restarted, mining at White Cliffs would occur in the same area it originally proliferated on Great Barrier. The area&#x27;s regenerating bushland still holds numerous semi-collapsed or open mining shafts where silver and gold had been mined.

====Kauri logging====
The kauri logging industry was profitable in early European days and up to the mid-20th century. Forests were well inland, with no easy way to get the logs to the sea or to sawmills. Kauri logs were dragged to a convenient stream bed with steep sides and a driving dam was constructed of wood, with a lifting gate near the bottom large enough for the logs to pass through. When the dam had filled, which might take up to a year, the gate was opened and the logs above the dam were pushed out through the hole and swept down to the sea. The logging industry cut down large amounts of old growth, and most of the current growth is younger native forest (around 150,000 kauri seedlings were planted by the New Zealand Forest Service in the 1970s and 1980s) as well as some remaining kauri in the far north of the island. Much of the island is covered with regenerating bush dominated by kanuka and kauri.

====Other industries====
Great Barrier Island was the site of New Zealand&#x27;s last whaling station, at Whangaparapara, which opened in 1956, over a century after the whaling industry peaked in New Zealand, and closed due to depletion of whaling stocks and increasing protection of whales by 1962.

Another small-scale industry was kauri gum digging, while dairy farming and sheep farming have tended to play a small role compared to the usual New Zealand practice. A fishing industry collapsed when international fish prices dropped. Islanders are generally occupied in tourism, farming or service-related industries when not working off-island.

===Shipwrecks===

The remote north was the site of the sinking of the SS &quot;Wairarapa&quot; around midnight of 29 October 1894. This was one of New Zealand&#x27;s worst shipwrecks, with about 140 lives lost, some of them buried in two beach grave sites in the far north. As a result, a Great Barrier Island pigeon post service was set up, the first message being flown on 14 May 1897. Special postage stamps were issued from October 1898 until 1908, when a new communications cable was laid to the mainland, which made the pigeon post redundant. Another major wreck lies in the far southeast, the &quot;SS Wiltshire&quot;.

===Nature reserves===
Over time, more and more of the island came under the stewardship of the Department of Conservation (DOC) or its predecessors. Partly this was land that had belonged to the Crown since the 1800s, while other parts were sold or donated like the more than 10% of the island (located in the northern bush area, with some of the largest remaining kauri forests) that was gifted to the Crown by farmer Max Burrill in 1984. DOC has created a large number of walking tracks through the island, some of which are also open for mountain biking. The Aotea Conservation Park has the only multi-day wilderness walk in the Auckland region, boasting two DOC huts and numerous campsites. The Park spreads over more than 12,000 hectares and offers multiple walking tracks for novice and experienced walkers.

The island is free of some of the more troublesome introduced pests that plague the native ecosystems of other parts of New Zealand. While it does have wild cats, feral pigs, black rats (&quot;R. rattus&quot;), Polynesian rats (&quot;R. exulans&quot;), mice and rabbits, there are no possums, mustelids (weasels, stoats or ferrets), hedgehogs, brown rats (&quot;R. norvegicus&quot;), deer or (since 2006) feral goats, thus being a relative haven for native bird and plant populations. Rare animals found on the island include brown teal ducks, black petrel seabirds and kākā parrots.

===Marae===

Great Barrier Island has two marae affiliated with the local iwi of Ngāti Rehua and Ngātiwai: the Kawa Marae and its Rehua meeting house, and Motairehe Marae and its Whakaruruhau meeting house.

In October 2020, the Government committed $313,007 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Kawa Marae, creating 6 jobs.

===Dark Sky Sanctuary===
In 2017, Aotea / Great Barrier Island was accredited as a Dark Sky Sanctuary by the International Dark-Sky Association. This designation is given for sites in very remote locations to increase awareness of their dark sky characteristics and promote long term conservation. At the time, it was the third International Dark Sky Sanctuary to be designated, and the first island sanctuary.

Barrier Islands statistical area, which includes Little Barrier Island and Mokohinau Islands although they have no permanent inhabitants, covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Barrier Islands had a population of 1,239 in the 2023 New Zealand census, an increase of 303 people (32.4%) since the 2018 census, and an increase of 306 people (32.8%) since the 2013 census. There were 660 males, 573 females and 6 people of other genders in 681 dwellings. 3.6% of people identified as LGBTIQ+. The median age was 51.0 years (compared with 38.1 years nationally). There were 162 people (13.1%) aged under 15 years, 153 (12.3%) aged 15 to 29, 603 (48.7%) aged 30 to 64, and 324 (26.2%) aged 65 or older.

People could identify as more than one ethnicity. The results were 89.8% European (Pākehā); 23.0% Māori; 2.2% Pasifika; 1.7% Asian; 0.7% Middle Eastern, Latin American and African New Zealanders (MELAA); and 2.9% other, which includes people giving their ethnicity as &quot;New Zealander&quot;. English was spoken by 97.8%, Māori language by 3.6%, and other languages by 8.0%. No language could be spoken by 1.7% (e.g. too young to talk). New Zealand Sign Language was known by 0.2%. The percentage of people born overseas was 18.9, compared with 28.8% nationally.

Religious affiliations were 18.9% Christian, 0.2% Hindu, 1.5% Māori religious beliefs, 0.7% Buddhist, 1.2% New Age, 0.2% Jewish, and 1.5% other religions. People who answered that they had no religion were 67.6%, and 9.0% of people did not answer the census question.

Of those at least 15 years old, 162 (15.0%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, 579 (53.8%) had a post-high school certificate or diploma, and 267 (24.8%) people exclusively held high school qualifications. The median income was $28,500, compared with $41,500 nationally. 57 people (5.3%) earned over $100,000 compared to 12.1% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 402 (37.3%) people were employed full-time, 222 (20.6%) were part-time, and 33 (3.1%) were unemployed.

==Settlements==
The population lives mostly in coastal settlements. Tryphena, in Tryphena Harbour at the southern end, is the largest settlement. Other communities are Okupu and Whangaparapara in the south-west, Port Fitzroy and Ōkiwi in the north, and Claris and Medlands in the south-east. The population swells substantially from October to May. The island has become a favourite holiday destination in the darker months, due its superbly dark sky and the astrophotography and stargazing opportunities this offers. In 2017 the island was given Dark Sky Sanctuary status by the IDA. Its relative remoteness offers solitude, and the sustainable off-grid lifestyle of its inhabitants is something many visitors like to experience.

Without reticulated electricity, most houses use solar panels and a battery bank to generate and store power. Wind and water turbines and solar water heaters are also used. Diesel generators, which used to be the main power source, are now mostly used as back-up.

From the end of February 2007, the island was seen around the world as the setting for the BBC One reality show &quot;Castaway&quot;, which was filmed there for three months.


==Transport==
There are two airfields on the island, Great Barrier Aerodrome at Claris and Okiwi Airfield. Barrier Air operates services from Auckland Airport, North Shore Aerodrome, and Tauranga to Claris. Flight time is approximately 30 minutes from Auckland Airport. Sunair operates between Claris and Hamilton, Tauranga, Whangārei and Whitianga.

SeaLink operates a passenger, car and freight ferry. This ferry operates from Wynyard Wharf in Auckland City to Tryphena (several times weekly). Sailing time is approximately four and a half hours.

Other ways to access the island include by seaplane or water taxi.

==Civic institutions==
Institutions and services are primarily provided by the Auckland Council, the local authority. Services and infrastructure like roads and the wharves at Tryphena and Whangaparapara are subsidised, with the island receiving about $4 in services for every $1 in rates. The Port FitzRoy wharf is owned by the North Barrier Residents and Ratepayers Association.

There are three primary schools: Mulberry Grove School at Tryphena, Kaitoke School at Claris, and Okiwi School. There is no secondary school, but there is a learning hub to assist students who learn through the New Zealand Correspondence School. Many children leave the island when they reach secondary school age to attend boarding school on the mainland. Previously, the lack of secondary schooling was cited as one of the reasons for a slow exodus of long-term resident families.

As part of Auckland the rules governing daily activities and applicable standards for civic works and services exists, shared with some of the other inhabited islands of the Hauraki Gulf. Driving rules are the same as for the rest of NZ and registration and a Warrant of Fitness are required for all vehicles. For example, every transport service operated solely on the island, the Chatham Islands, or Stewart Island/Rakiura is exempt from section 70C of the Transport Act 1962, the requirements for drivers to maintain driving-hours logbooks. Drivers subject to section 70B must nevertheless keep records of their driving hours in some form.

Rules governing dog control are the same as for Auckland. Dogs must be kept on a lead in all public places.

<text>New Zealand consists of more than six hundred islands, mainly remnants of a larger land mass now beneath the sea. New Zealand is the sixth-largest island country, and the third-largest located entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. The following is a list of islands of New Zealand.

The two largest islands – where most of the population lives – have names in both English and in the Māori language. They are the North Island or &quot;Te Ika-a-Māui&quot; and the South Island or &quot;Te Waipounamu&quot;. Various Māori iwi sometimes use other names, with some preferring to call the South Island &quot;Te Waka o Aoraki&quot;. The two islands are separated by the Cook Strait. In general practice, the term &quot;mainland&quot; refers to the North Island and South Island. However, the South Island alone is sometimes called &quot;the mainland&quot; – especially by its residents, as a nickname – because it is the larger of the two main islands.

To the south of the South Island, Stewart Island / Rakiura is the largest of the smaller islands, and Waiheke Island in the urban Auckland Region has the largest population of the smaller islands.

== Listed by size==
The following table lists the largest islands of New Zealand by area. River delta islands such as Rakaia Island (), Fereday Island, Rangitata Island, and Inch Clutha (approximately , , and respectively) are omitted, as are temporary islands in braided river channels and tidal islands such as Rabbit Island, Nelson (). The country&#x27;s largest island within a lake, Pomona Island, has an area of just .

==Listed by highest point==

The following table lists the islands of New Zealand by their highest elevation. These islands are all in harbours or the open sea. The country&#x27;s tallest island within a lake, Pomona Island, rises to above sea level, which is about above Lake Manapouri&#x27;s normal lake level.

<doc id="38367" wikidata="Q60029" url="?curid=38367" title="Oskar Schindler">
<text>Oskar Schindler (; 28 April 1908 – 9 October 1974) was a German industrialist, humanitarian, and member of the Nazi Party who is credited with saving the lives of 1,200 Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his enamelware and ammunitions factories in occupied Poland and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. He is the subject of the 1982 novel &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; and its 1993 film adaptation, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, which reflect his life as an opportunist, initially motivated by profit, who came to show extraordinary initiative, tenacity, courage, and dedication in saving his Jewish employees&#x27; lives.

Schindler grew up in Zwittau, Moravia, and worked in several trades until he joined the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, the military intelligence service of Nazi Germany, in 1936. Before the beginning of the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938, he collected information on railways and troop movements for the German government. He was arrested for espionage by the Czechoslovak government but was released under the terms of the Munich Agreement that year. He continued to collect information for the Nazis, working in Poland in 1939 before the invasion of Poland at the start of World War II. He joined the Nazi Party in 1939. In 1939, he acquired an enamelware factory in Kraków, Poland, which employed at its peak in 1944 about 1,750 workers, of whom 1,000 were Jews. His &quot;Abwehr&quot; connections helped him protect his Jewish workers from deportation and death in the Nazi concentration camps. As time went on, he had to give Nazi officials ever larger bribes and gifts of luxury items obtainable only on the black market to keep his workers safe.

By July 1944, Germany was losing the war; the SS began closing down the easternmost concentration camps and deporting the remaining prisoners westward. Many were murdered in Auschwitz and the Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Schindler convinced SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Amon Göth, commandant of the nearby Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp, to allow him to move his factory to Brněnec/Brünnlitz in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, thus sparing his workers from almost certain death in the gas chambers of Auschwitz. Using names provided by Jewish Ghetto Police officer Marcel Goldberg, Göth&#x27;s secretary Mietek Pemper compiled and typed the list of 1,200 Jews who travelled to Brünnlitz in October 1944. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent his workers&#x27; execution until the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, by which time he had spent his entire fortune on bribes and black market purchases of supplies for his workers.

Schindler moved to West Germany after the war, where he was supported by assistance payments from Jewish relief organisations. After receiving a partial reimbursement for his wartime expenses, he moved with his wife Emilie to Argentina where they took up farming. When they went bankrupt in 1958, Schindler left his wife and returned to Germany, where he failed at several business ventures and relied on financial support from &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; (&quot;Schindler Jews&quot;)—the people whose lives he had saved during the war. He died on 9 October 1974 in Hildesheim, Germany, and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, the only former member of the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way. Oskar and Emilie Schindler were named Righteous Among the Nations by Yad Vashem in 1993. 
==Early life and education==
Schindler was born on 28 April 1908, into a Sudeten German family in Zwittau, Moravia, Austria-Hungary. His father was Johann &quot;Hans&quot; Schindler, the owner of a farm machinery business, and his mother was Franziska &quot;Fanny&quot; Schindler (née Luser). His sister, Elfriede, was born in 1915. After attending primary and secondary school, Schindler enrolled in a technical school, from which he was expelled in 1924 for forging his report card. He later graduated but did not take the &quot;abitur&quot; exams that would have enabled him to go to university. Instead, he took courses in Brno in several trades, including chauffeuring and machinery, and worked for his father for three years. A motorcycle enthusiast since his youth, he bought a 250-cc Moto Guzzi racing motorcycle and competed recreationally in mountain races for the next few years.

On 6 March 1928, Schindler married Emilie Pelzl, daughter of a prosperous Sudeten German farmer from Maletein. They moved in with Oskar&#x27;s parents and occupied the upstairs rooms, where they lived for seven years. Soon after marriage, Schindler quit working for his father and took a series of jobs, including a position at Moravian Electrotechnic and the management of a driving school. After an 18-month stint in the Czech army, where he rose to the rank of lance corporal in the Tenth Infantry Regiment of the 31st Army, he returned to Moravian Electrotechnic, which went bankrupt shortly afterward. His father&#x27;s farm machinery business closed around the same time, leaving Schindler unemployed for a year. He took a job with Jaroslav Šimek Bank of Prague in 1931, where he worked until 1938.

Schindler was arrested several times in 1931 and 1932 for public drunkenness. Also around this time, he had an affair with Aurelie Schlegel, a school friend. They had a daughter, Emily, in 1933, and a son, Oskar Jr, in 1935. Schindler later claimed the boy was not his son. Schindler&#x27;s father, an alcoholic, abandoned his wife in 1935. She died a few months later after a long illness.

==Spy for the &quot;Abwehr&quot;==
Schindler joined the separatist Sudeten German Party in 1935. Although a citizen of Czechoslovakia, Schindler became a spy for the &quot;Abwehr&quot;, the military intelligence service of Nazi Germany, in 1936. He was assigned to &quot;Abwehrstelle II Commando VIII&quot;, based in Breslau. He later told Czech police that he did it because he needed the money; by this time Schindler had a drinking problem and was chronically in debt.

His tasks for the &quot;Abwehr&quot; included collecting information on railways, military installations and troop movements, as well as recruiting other spies within Czechoslovakia in advance of Nazi Germany&#x27;s planned invasion. He was arrested by the Czech government for espionage on 18 July 1938 and immediately imprisoned; he was released as a political prisoner under the terms of the Munich Agreement, the instrument under which the Czech Sudetenland was annexed by Germany on 1 October. Schindler applied for membership in the Nazi Party on 1 November and was accepted the following year.

After some time off to recover in Zwittau, Schindler was promoted to second in command of his &quot;Abwehr&quot; unit and relocated with his wife to Ostrava (Ostrau), on the Czech-Polish border, in January 1939. He was involved in espionage in the months leading up to Hitler&#x27;s seizure of the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March. Emilie helped him with paperwork, processing and hiding secret documents in their apartment for the &quot;Abwehr&quot; office. As Schindler frequently travelled to Poland on business, he and his 25 agents were in a position to collect information about Polish military activities and railways for the planned invasion of Poland. One assignment called for his unit to monitor and provide information about the railway line and tunnel in the Jablunkov Pass, deemed critical for the movement of German troops. Schindler continued to work for the &quot;Abwehr&quot; until as late as fall 1940, when he was sent to Turkey to investigate corruption among the &quot;Abwehr&quot; officers assigned to the German embassy there.

==World War II==
===Emalia===
Schindler first arrived in Kraków (Krakau) in October 1939 on &quot;Abwehr&quot; business and took an apartment the following month. Emilie maintained the apartment in Ostrava and visited Oskar in Kraków at least once a week. In November 1939, he contacted interior decorator Mila Pfefferberg to decorate his new apartment. Her son, Leopold &quot;Poldek&quot; Pfefferberg, soon became one of his contacts for black market trading. They eventually became lifelong friends.

The same month, Schindler was introduced to Itzhak Stern, an accountant for Schindler&#x27;s fellow &quot;Abwehr&quot; agent Josef &quot;Sepp&quot; Aue, who had taken over Stern&#x27;s formerly Jewish-owned place of employment as a &quot;treuhänder&quot; (trustee). Property belonging to Polish Jews, including their possessions, places of business, and homes, were seized by the Germans beginning immediately after the invasion, and Jewish citizens were stripped of their civil rights. Schindler showed Stern the balance sheet of a company he was thinking of acquiring, an enamelware factory called Rekord Ltd owned by a consortium of Jewish businessmen that had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year. Stern advised him that rather than running the company as a trusteeship under the auspices of the &quot;Haupttreuhandstelle Ost&quot; (Main Trustee Office for the East), he should buy or lease the business, as that would give him more freedom from the Nazis&#x27; dictates, including freedom to hire more Jews.

With the financial backing of several Jewish investors, including one of the owners, Abraham Bankier, Schindler signed an informal lease agreement on the factory on 13 November 1939 and formalised the arrangement on 15 January 1940. He renamed it &quot;Deutsche Emailwarenfabrik&quot; (German Enamelware Factory) or DEF, and it soon became known by the nickname &quot;Emalia&quot;. He initially acquired a staff of seven Jewish workers (including Bankier, who helped him manage the company) and 250 non-Jewish Poles. At its peak in 1944, the business employed around 1,750 workers, a thousand of whom were Jews. Schindler also helped run Schlomo Wiener Ltd, a wholesale outfit that sold his enamelware, and was leaseholder of Prokosziner Glashütte, a glass factory.

Schindler&#x27;s ties with the &quot;Abwehr&quot; and his connections in the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and its Armaments Inspectorate enabled him to obtain contracts to produce enamel cookware for the military. These connections also later helped him protect his Jewish workers from deportation and death. As time went on, Schindler had to give Nazi officials ever larger bribes and gifts of luxury items obtainable only on the black market to keep his workers safe. Bankier, a key black market connection, obtained goods for bribes as well as extra materials for use in the factory. Schindler enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and pursued extramarital relationships with his secretary, Viktoria Klonowska, and Eva Kisch Scheuer, a merchant specialising in enamelware from DEF. Emilie Schindler visited for a few months in 1940 and moved to Kraków to live with Oskar in 1941.

Initially, Schindler was mostly interested in the business&#x27;s money-making potential and hired Jews because they were cheaper than Poles—the wages were set by the occupying Nazi regime. Later he began shielding his workers without regard for cost. The status of his factory as a business essential to the war effort became a decisive factor in enabling him to protect his Jewish workers. Whenever &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; (Schindler Jews) were threatened with deportation, he claimed exemptions for them. He claimed wives, children, and even people with disabilities were necessary mechanics and metalworkers. On one occasion, the Gestapo came to Schindler demanding that he hand over a family that possessed forged identity papers. &quot;Three hours after they walked in,&quot; Schindler said, &quot;two drunk Gestapo men reeled out of my office without their prisoners and without the incriminating documents they had demanded.&quot;

On 1 August 1940, Governor-General Hans Frank issued a decree requiring all Kraków Jews to leave the city within two weeks. Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay. Of the 60,000 to 80,000 Jews then living in the city, only 15,000 remained by March 1941. These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto, established in the industrial Podgórze district. Schindler&#x27;s workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory. Enlargements to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic, co-op, kitchen, and dining room for the workers, in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space.

===Płaszów===
In fall 1941, the Nazis began transporting Jews out of the ghetto. Most of them were sent to the Bełżec extermination camp and murdered. On 13 March 1943 the ghetto was liquidated, and those still fit for work were sent to the new concentration camp at Płaszów. Several thousand not deemed fit for work were sent to extermination camps and murdered; hundreds more were murdered on the streets by the Nazis as they cleared out the ghetto. Aware of the plans because of his &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; contacts, Schindler had his workers stay at the factory overnight to protect them from harm. He witnessed the ghetto&#x27;s liquidation and was appalled. From that point, says &quot;Schindlerjude&quot; Sol Urbach, Schindler &quot;changed his mind about the Nazis. He decided to get out and to save as many Jews as he could.&quot;

The Płaszów concentration camp opened in March 1943 on the former site of two Jewish cemeteries on Jerozilimska Street, about from the DEF factory. In charge of the camp was SS-&quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Amon Göth, a sadist who shot inmates at random. Płaszów&#x27;s inmates lived in constant fear for their lives. Emilie Schindler called Göth &quot;the most despicable man I have ever met.&quot;

Göth&#x27;s plan was that all the factories, including Schindler&#x27;s, should be moved inside the camp gates. But with a combination of diplomacy, flattery, and bribery, Schindler not only prevented his factory from being moved, but convinced Göth to allow him to build (at Schindler&#x27;s own expense) a subcamp at Emalia to house his workers and 450 Jews from other nearby factories. There they were safe from the threat of random execution, well fed and housed, and permitted to undertake religious observances.

Schindler was arrested twice on suspicion of black market activities and once for breaking the Nuremberg Laws by kissing a Jewish girl, an action forbidden by the Race and Resettlement Act. The first arrest, in late 1941, led to him being kept overnight. His secretary arranged for his release through Schindler&#x27;s influential contacts in the Nazi Party. His second arrest, on 29 April 1942, was the result of his kissing a Jewish girl on the cheek at his birthday party at the factory the previous day. He remained in jail five days before his influential Nazi contacts could obtain his release. In October 1944, he was arrested again, accused of black marketeering and bribing Göth and others to improve the conditions of the Jewish workers. He was held for nearly a week and released. Göth had been arrested on 13 September 1944 for corruption and other abuses of power, and Schindler&#x27;s arrest was part of the ongoing investigation into Göth&#x27;s activities. Göth was never convicted on those charges.

In 1943, Schindler was contacted by Zionist leaders in Budapest via members of the Jewish resistance movement. He travelled to Budapest several times to report in person on Nazi mistreatment of the Jews. He brought back funding provided by the Jewish Agency for Palestine and turned it over to the Jewish underground.

===Brünnlitz===

As the Red Army drew nearer in July 1944, the SS began closing down the easternmost concentration camps and evacuating the remaining prisoners westward to Auschwitz and Gross-Rosen concentration camp. Göth&#x27;s personal secretary, Mietek Pemper, alerted Schindler to the Nazis&#x27; plans to close all factories not directly involved in the war effort, including Schindler&#x27;s. Pemper suggested to Schindler that production be switched from cookware to anti-tank grenades in an effort to save the Jewish workers&#x27; lives. Using bribery and his powers of persuasion, Schindler convinced Göth and the officials in Berlin to allow him to move his factory and his workers to Brünnlitz (Czech: &quot;Brněnec&quot;), in the Sudetenland, thus sparing them from certain death in the gas chambers. Using names provided by Jewish Ghetto Police officer Marcel Goldberg, Pemper compiled and typed the list of 1,200 Jews—1,000 of Schindler&#x27;s workers and 200 inmates from Julius Madritsch&#x27;s textiles factory—who were sent to Brünnlitz in October 1944.

On 15 October 1944 a train carrying 700 men on Schindler&#x27;s list was initially sent to the concentration camp at Gross-Rosen, where the men spent about a week before being rerouted to the factory in Brünnlitz. Three hundred female &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; were similarly sent to Auschwitz, where they were in imminent danger of being sent to the gas chambers. Schindler&#x27;s usual connections and bribes failed to win their release. Finally, after he sent his secretary, Hilde Albrecht, with bribes of black market goods, food and diamonds, the women were sent to Brünnlitz after several harrowing weeks in Auschwitz.

In addition to workers, Schindler moved 250 wagonloads of machinery and raw materials to the new factory. Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant. When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory&#x27;s low output, Schindler bought finished goods on the black market and resold them as his own. The rations provided by the SS were insufficient to meet the workers&#x27; needs, so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków obtaining food, armaments, and other materials. His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz, surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers&#x27; health and other basic needs.

Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3,000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war. In January 1945, a trainload of 250 Jews who had been rejected as workers at a German mine in Goleschau in occupied Poland arrived at Brünnlitz. The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived, and Emilie waited while an engineer from the factory opened them with a soldering iron. Twelve people were dead in the cars, and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work. Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital until the end of the war. Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached. On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered and that the war in Europe was over.

==After the war==

As a member of the Nazi Party and the &quot;Abwehr&quot; intelligence service, Schindler was in danger of being arrested as a war criminal. Bankier, Stern, and several others prepared a statement he could present to the Americans attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives. 

After the liquidation of the Płaszów camp, the &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; decided to give Schindler a memento. The original investors in the enamel factory canvassed the workers for ideas. Knowing there were several jewelers among their group, a man named Simon Yeret, formerly a prosperous timber merchant, offered a gold bridge from his own mouth. The bridge was removed and its metal melted with a few scavenged silver coins. A jeweler named Jozef Gross cut a section of lead pipe and created a master signet ring out of which the gold version would be cast. Gross shaved two cuttlebones flat and squeezed the lead master between them until an impression had been pressed into the mold. This was filled with the gold from Yeret&#x27;s bridge. Gross then filed and polished the gold ring. He engraved a paraphrase from the Talmud in Hebrew on the ring that said, &quot;Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.&quot; Despite his mixed feelings about Schindler&#x27;s character, Gross kept the cuttlebone mold and lead master for the rest of his life. They are currently housed at the Melbourne Holocaust Museum. The whereabouts of the actual ring have long been unknown, nor is it clear what Schindler did with it after the war.

=== Escape to the American lines ===
To escape capture by the Soviets, Schindler and his wife departed westward in their vehicle, a two-seater Horch, initially with several fleeing German soldiers riding on the running boards. A truck containing Schindler&#x27;s mistress Marta, several Jewish workers, and a load of black market trade goods followed. Soviet troops confiscated the Horch at the city of České Budějovice, which the Soviets had already captured. The Schindlers were unable to recover a diamond Oskar had hidden under the seat. They continued by train and on foot until they reached the American lines at Lenora and then travelled to Passau, where an American Jewish officer arranged for them to travel to Switzerland by train. They moved to Bavaria in Germany in late 1945.

By the end of the war, Schindler had spent his entire fortune on bribes and black market purchases of supplies for his workers. Virtually destitute, he moved briefly to Regensburg and later Munich but did not prosper in postwar Germany. He was reduced to receiving assistance from Jewish organisations. In 1948 he presented a claim for reimbursement of his wartime expenses to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee and received $15,000. He estimated his expenditures at over $1,056,000, including the costs of camp construction, bribes, and black market goods, including food.

In 1949, Schindler emigrated to Argentina, where he tried raising chickens and then nutria (coypu), a small animal raised for its fur. When the business went bankrupt in 1958, he left his wife and returned to Germany, where he had a series of unsuccessful business ventures, including a cement factory. He declared bankruptcy in 1963 and suffered a heart attack the next year, which led to a monthlong hospital stay. Remaining in contact with many of the Jews he had met during the war, including Stern and Pfefferberg, Schindler survived on donations sent by &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot; from all over the world.

For his work during the war, on 8 May 1962 Yad Vashem invited Schindler to a ceremony in which a carob tree was planted in his honour on the Avenue of the Righteous. Schindler received awards for his efforts, including the German Order of Merit in 1966. Schindler died of liver failure on 9 October 1974. He is buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, possibly the only member of the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way. On 24 June 1993 he and his wife were named Righteous Among the Nations, an award the State of Israel bestows on non-Jews who took an active role in rescuing Jews during the Holocaust. Schindler, along with Karl Plagge, Georg Ferdinand Duckwitz, Helmut Kleinicke, and Hans Walz are among the few Nazi Party members to be given this award.

Writer Herbert Steinhouse, who interviewed Schindler in 1948, wrote: &quot;Schindler&#x27;s exceptional deeds stemmed from just that elementary sense of decency and humanity that our sophisticated age seldom sincerely believes in. A repentant opportunist saw the light and rebelled against the sadism and vile criminality all around him.&quot; In a 1983 television documentary, Schindler is quoted as saying: &quot;I felt that the Jews were being destroyed. I had to help them; there was no choice.&quot; In the former Czechoslovakia, his reputation is mixed, as he is negatively remembered for his service in the &quot;Abwehr&quot; and for his support of German separatism in the Sudetenland. Efforts to convert the factory site in Brněnec to a museum have failed for lack of financial support.

===Films and book===

In 1951, Poldek Pfefferberg approached director Fritz Lang and asked him to consider making a film about Schindler. Also on Pfefferberg&#x27;s initiative, in 1964 Schindler received a $20,000 () advance from MGM for a proposed film treatment titled &quot;To the Last Hour&quot;. Neither film was made, and Schindler quickly spent the money he received from MGM. He was also approached in the 1960s by MCA of Germany and Walt Disney Productions in Vienna, but again nothing came of these projects.

In 1980, Australian author Thomas Keneally by chance visited Pfefferberg&#x27;s luggage store in Beverly Hills while en route home from a film festival in Europe, and Pfefferberg told him Schindler&#x27;s story. He gave Keneally copies of some materials he had on file, and Keneally decided to make a fictionalised treatment of the story. After extensive research and interviews with surviving &quot;Schindlerjuden&quot;, he wrote his historical novel &quot;Schindler&#x27;s Ark&quot; (published in the United States as &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;), which was released in 1982.

The novel was adapted as the 1993 movie &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; by director Steven Spielberg. Although Spielberg had acquired the film rights ten years earlier, he did not feel he was emotionally or professionally ready to tackle it, and he offered the project to several directors. Later, after reading a script for the project prepared by Steven Zaillian for Martin Scorsese, he decided to trade him &quot;Cape Fear&quot; for the opportunity to do the Schindler biopic. In the film, the character Itzhak Stern (played by Ben Kingsley) is a composite of Stern, Bankier and Pemper. Liam Neeson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Schindler, and the film won seven Oscars, including Best Picture.

Other film treatments include a 1983 British television documentary produced by Jon Blair for Thames Television, &quot;Schindler: His Story as Told by the Actual People He Saved&quot; (released in the US in 1994 as &quot;Schindler: The Real Story&quot;), and a 1998 A&amp;E Biography special, &quot;Oskar Schindler: The Man Behind the List&quot;.

===Schindler&#x27;s suitcase===
In 1997, a suitcase belonging to Schindler containing historic photographs and documents was discovered in the attic of the apartment of Ami and Heinrich Staehr in Hildesheim. Schindler had stayed with the couple for a few days shortly before his death in 1974. Staehr&#x27;s son Chris took the suitcase to Stuttgart, where the documents were examined in detail in 1999 by Wolfgang Borgmann, science editor of the &quot;Stuttgarter Zeitung&quot;. Borgmann wrote a series of seven articles that appeared in the paper from 16 to 26 October 1999 and were eventually published in book form as &quot;Schindlers Koffer: Berichte aus dem Leben eines Lebensretters; eine Dokumentation der Stuttgarter Zeitung&quot; (&quot;Schindler&#x27;s Suitcase: Reports from the Life of a Lifesaver&quot;). The documents and suitcase were sent to the Holocaust museum at Yad Vashem in Israel for safekeeping in December 1999.

===Copies of the list===
In early April 2009, a carbon copy of one version of the list was discovered at the State Library of New South Wales by workers combing through boxes of materials collected by Keneally. The 13-page document, yellow and fragile, was filed among research notes and original newspaper clippings. The document was given to Keneally in 1980 by Pfefferberg when he was persuading him to write Schindler&#x27;s story. This version of the list contains 801 names and is dated 18 April 1945; Pfefferberg is listed as worker number 173. Several authentic versions of the list exist, because the names were retyped several times as conditions changed in the hectic days at the end of the war. One of four existing copies of the list was offered at a ten-day auction starting on 19 July 2013 on eBay at a reserve price of $3 million. It received no bids.

===Other memorabilia===
In August 2013, a one-page letter signed by Schindler on 22 August 1944 sold in an online auction for $59,135. The letter noted Schindler&#x27;s permission for a factory supervisor to move machinery to Czechoslovakia. The same unknown auction buyer had previously purchased 1943 construction documents for Schindler&#x27;s Kraków factory for $63,426.

<text>John D. Carmack II (born August 21, 1970) is an American computer programmer and video game developer. He co-founded the video game company id Software and was the lead programmer of its 1990s games &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, &quot;Doom&quot;, &quot;Quake&quot;, and their sequels. Carmack made innovations in 3D computer graphics, such as his Carmack&#x27;s Reverse algorithm for shadow volumes. 

In 2013, he resigned from id Software to work full-time at Oculus VR as their CTO. In 2019, he reduced his role to Consulting CTO so he could allocate more time toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). In 2022, he left Oculus to work on his AGI startup, Keen Technologies.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Carmack was born in Shawnee Mission, Kansas, the son of local television news reporter Stan Carmack. He grew up in the Kansas City metropolitan area, where he became interested in computers at an early age. He attended Shawnee Mission East High School in Prairie Village, Kansas and Raytown South High School in nearby Raytown, Missouri.

Carmack was introduced to video games with the 1978 shoot &#x27;em up game &quot;Space Invaders&quot; in the arcades during a summer vacation as a child. The 1980 maze chase arcade game &quot;Pac-Man&quot; also left a strong impression on him. He cited Nintendo designer Shigeru Miyamoto as the game developer he most admired.

As reported in David Kushner&#x27;s &quot;Masters of Doom&quot;, when Carmack was 14, he broke into a school with other children to steal Apple II computers. To gain entry to the building, Carmack concocted a sticky substance of thermite mixed with Vaseline that melted through the windows. However, an overweight accomplice struggled to get through the hole and instead opened the window, setting off a silent alarm and alerting police. Carmack was arrested and sent for psychiatric evaluation. He was sentenced to a year in a juvenile home. He attended the University of Missouri–Kansas City for two semesters before withdrawing to work as a freelance programmer.

===Career===
Softdisk, a computer company in Shreveport, Louisiana, hired Carmack to work on &quot;Softdisk G-S&quot; (an Apple II publication), introducing him to John Romero and other future key members of id Software such as Adrian Carmack (no relation). Later, Softdisk would place this team in charge of a new, but short-lived, bi-monthly game subscription product called &quot;Gamer&#x27;s Edge&quot; for the IBM PC (DOS) platform. In 1990, while still at Softdisk, Carmack, Romero, and others created the first of the &quot;Commander Keen&quot; games, a series that was published by Apogee Software, under the shareware distribution model, from 1991 onwards. Afterwards, Carmack left Softdisk to co-found id Software.

Carmack has pioneered or popularized the use of many techniques in computer graphics, including &quot;adaptive tile refresh&quot; for &quot;Commander Keen&quot;, ray casting for &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot;, &quot;Catacomb 3-D&quot;, and &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot;, binary space partitioning which &quot;Doom&quot; became the first game to use, surface caching which he invented for &quot;Quake&quot;, Carmack&#x27;s Reverse (formally known as z-fail stencil shadows) which he devised for &quot;Doom 3&quot;, and MegaTexture technology, first used in &quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot;. &quot;Quake 3&quot; popularized the fast inverse square root algorithm.

Carmack&#x27;s engines have also been licensed for use in other influential first-person shooters such as &quot;Half-Life&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty&quot; and &quot;Medal of Honor: Allied Assault&quot;. In 2007, when Carmack was on vacation with his wife, he ended up playing some games on his cellphone, and decided he was going to make a &quot;good&quot; mobile game.

On August 7, 2013, Carmack joined Oculus VR as their CTO. On November 22, 2013, he resigned from id Software to work full-time at Oculus VR. Carmack&#x27;s reason for leaving was that id&#x27;s parent company ZeniMax Media did not want to support Oculus Rift. Carmack&#x27;s role at both companies later became central to a ZeniMax lawsuit against Oculus&#x27; parent company, Facebook, claiming that Oculus stole ZeniMax&#x27;s virtual reality intellectual property. The trial jury absolved Carmack of liability, though Oculus and other corporate officers were held liable for trademark, copyright, and contract violations.

In February 2017, Carmack sued ZeniMax, claiming the company had refused to pay him the remaining $22.5 million (~$ in ) owed to him from their purchase of id Software. In October 2018, Carmack stated that he and ZeniMax had reached an agreement and that &quot;Zenimax has fully satisfied their obligations to me&quot;, ending the suit.

On November 13, 2019, Carmack stepped down from the Oculus CTO role to become a &quot;Consulting CTO&quot; in order to allocate more time to his work on artificial general intelligence (AGI). On August 19, 2022, Carmack announced that he has raised $20M for Keen Technologies, his new AGI company. On December 16, 2022, Carmack left Oculus to focus on Keen.

In September 2023 John partnered with computer scientist Richard S Sutton from the Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute to help further AI research efforts.

===Workstyle ===
Carmack claims to have maintained a sixty-hour work week, working a 10-hour day, six days a week, throughout his career. He has spoken publicly about the importance of long hours of uninterrupted focus in his work. Not only does high intensity allow him to make progress more quickly, but long hours are also critical to maintaining a focused mindset over time. Despite working such a demanding schedule, he has never experienced burnout.

Carmack is also known for taking week-long programming retreats. These retreats involve a solitary, uninterrupted period away from his normal routine often sequestered in a random city and hotel. The goal of these retreats is to allow Carmack to operate at full cognitive capacity, tackling a specific, difficult problem or learning a new skill. The solitude and physical isolation of these retreats offer the perfect environment for deep focus and reflection, making them an essential part of Carmack&#x27;s creative process.

Carmack was vocal about his frustration with the bureaucratic inefficiencies he encountered during his time at Meta. In his departure memo, he stated, &quot;We have a ridiculous amount of people and resources, but we constantly self-sabotage and squander effort,&quot; he wrote. &quot;I have never been able to kill stupid things before they cause damage, or set a direction and have a team actually stick to it.&quot;

Carmack subscribes to the philosophy that small, incremental steps are the fastest route to meaningful and disruptive innovation. He compares this approach to the &quot;magic of gradient descent&quot; where small steps using local information result in the best outcomes. According to Carmack, this principle is proven by his own experience, and he has observed this in many of the smartest people in the world. He states, &quot;Little tiny steps using local information winds up leading to all the best answers.&quot;

==Armadillo Aerospace==

Around 2000, Carmack became interested in rocketry, a hobby of his youth. Reviewing how much money he was spending on customizing Ferraris, he began by giving financial support to a few local amateur engineers. Carmack funded the company, called Armadillo Aerospace, out of his own pocket, for &quot;something north of a million dollars a year.&quot; The company of hobbyists made steady progress toward their goals of suborbital space flight and eventual orbital vehicles. In October 2008, Armadillo Aerospace competed in a NASA contest known as the Lunar Lander Challenge, winning first place in the Level 1 competition along with $350,000 (~$ in ). In September 2009, they completed Level 2 and were awarded $500,000 (~$ in ). The company went into &quot;hibernation mode&quot; in 2013.

According to Carmack, the work in the aerospace industry is &quot;simple&quot; compared to the work he does in video games.

==Open-source software==
Carmack is an advocate of open-source software, and has repeatedly voiced his opposition to software patents, equating them to robbery. He has also contributed to open-source projects, such as starting the initial port of the X Window System to Mac OS X Server and working to improve the OpenGL drivers for Linux through the Utah GLX project.

Carmack released the source code for &quot;Wolfenstein 3D&quot; in 1995 and the &quot;Doom&quot; source code in 1997, first under a custom license and then under the GNU General Public License (GPL) in 1999. When the source code to &quot;Quake&quot; was leaked and circulated among the &quot;Quake&quot; community underground in 1997 after licensee Crack dot Com was hacked, a programmer unaffiliated with id Software named Greg Alexander used it to port &quot;Quake&quot; to Linux using SVGALib. As this was more feature rich than Dave Taylor&#x27;s earlier X11 port, he sent the patches to Carmack. Instead of pursuing legal action, id Software used the patches as the foundation for a company-sanctioned Linux port maintained by new hire Zoid Kirsch, who later ported &quot;Quakeworld&quot; and &quot;Quake II&quot; to Linux as well.

id Software has since publicly released the source code to &quot;Quake&quot; in 1999, &quot;Quake 2&quot; in 2001, &quot;Quake 3&quot; in 2005 and lastly &quot;Doom 3&quot; in 2011 (and later the &quot;BFG Edition&quot; in 2012). The source code for &quot;Hovertank 3D&quot; and &quot;Catacomb 3D&quot; (as well as Carmack&#x27;s earlier &quot;Catacomb&quot;) was released in June 2014 by Flat Rock Software with Carmack&#x27;s blessing. He has since expressed regret on using the copyleft GPL over the more permissive BSD license.

The release of id Tech 4 occurred despite patent concerns from Creative Labs over Carmack&#x27;s reverse, while the original &quot;Doom&quot; source release shipped without music due to complications with the Cygnus Studios developed DMX library (which lead to the Linux version being selected for release). Carmack has since advised developers to be careful when utilizing middleware, noting how it can limit the possibilities of later releasing source code. Tim Sweeney has implied this issue has hindered potential releases of older Unreal Engine source code.

On the other hand, despite his technical admiration for the system, Carmack has several times over the years voiced a sceptical opinion about Linux as a gaming platform. In 2013, he argued for emulation as the &quot;proper technical direction for gaming on Linux&quot;, and in 2014 he voiced the opinion that Linux might be the biggest problem for the success of the Steam Machine.

Carmack contributes to charities and gaming communities. Some of the recipients of Carmack&#x27;s charitable contributions include his former high school, promoters of open-source software, opponents of software patents, and game enthusiasts.

==Personal life==
Carmack was so successful at id that by mid-1994 he had purchased two Ferraris: a Ferrari 328 and a Ferrari Testarossa. In 1997, he gave away the Ferrari 328 as a prize to Dennis Fong, the winner of the &quot;Quake&quot; tournament &quot;Red Annihilation&quot;.

He met his now ex-wife Katherine Anna Kang, at the 1997 QuakeCon when she visited id&#x27;s offices. As a bet, Kang challenged Carmack to sponsor the first all-female &quot;Quake&quot; tournament if she was able to produce a significant number of participants. Carmack predicted a maximum of 25 participants, but there were 1,500. Carmack and Kang married on January 1, 2000, and planned a ceremony in Hawaii. Steve Jobs requested that they would postpone the ceremony so Carmack could attend the MacWorld Expo on January 5, 2000. Carmack declined and suggested making a video instead. Carmack and Kang had a son Christopher Ryan in August 2004. Their second son was born in November 2009.

Carmack is divorced as of 2021. On May 26, 2022, he announced his divorce and how he met his partner Trista through the VR &quot;Beat Saber&quot; games he would host via Twitter.

As a game developer, Carmack differed from many of his contemporaries by avoiding commitment to a final release date for any game he was developing. Instead, when asked for a release date on a new game, Carmack would usually reply that the game would be released &quot;when it&#x27;s done&quot;. Employees at Apogee, in their past years the publishers of games by id Software, adopted this business practice as well. In 2019, as a guest on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot;, Carmack stated that his beliefs have changed over time: &quot;I largely recant from that now.&quot; On &quot;Rage&quot; 6-year development time he says: &quot;I think we should have done whatever it would have taken to ship it 2 years earlier&quot;. Carmack also reflected on the internal development of Quake in this regard and described it as &quot;traumatic&quot; and says id Software could have split the game into two parts and shipped it earlier.

Carmack has a blog last updated in 2006 (previously a .plan, which could be accessed by making a finger request for an active Twitter account, and also occasionally posts comments to &quot;Slashdot&quot;.

Carmack supported the 2012 presidential campaign of Libertarian Ron Paul, and also persuaded the Libertarian Party of Texas to accept BitCoin an alternative to donations. He is an atheist. During a conversation with Joe Rogan, Carmack revealed that he had trained in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and Judo for several years as a hobby.

During his time at id Software, a medium pepperoni pizza would arrive for Carmack from Domino&#x27;s Pizza almost every day, carried by the same delivery person for more than 15 years. Carmack had been such a regular customer that they continued to charge him 1995 prices.

On occasion he has commended the efforts of similarly focused programmers – first Ken Silverman, who wrote the Build engine for 3D Realms, and later with Tim Sweeney of Epic Games, who wrote the Unreal Engine.

<text>Snakes and ladders is a board game for two or more players regarded today as a worldwide classic. The game originated in ancient India invented by saint Dnyaneshwar as &quot;Moksha Patam&quot;, and was brought to the United Kingdom in the 1890s. It is played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of &quot;ladders&quot; and &quot;snakes&quot; are pictured on the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one&#x27;s game piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing ladders but hindered by falling down snakes.

The game is a simple race based on sheer luck, and it is popular with young children. The historic version had its roots in morality lessons, on which a player&#x27;s progression up the board represented a life journey complicated by virtues (ladders) and vices (snakes). The game is also sold under other names, such as the morality themed Chutes and Ladders, which was published by the Milton Bradley Company starting in 1943.

==Equipment==
The size of the grid varies, but is most commonly 8×8, 10×10 or 12×12 squares. Boards have snakes and ladders starting and ending on different squares; both factors affect the duration of play. Each player is represented by a distinct game piece token. A single die is rolled to determine random movement of a player&#x27;s token in the traditional form of play; two dice may be used for a shorter game.

==History==
Snakes and ladders originated as part of a family of Indian dice board games that included &quot;gyan chauper&quot; and pachisi (known in English as Ludo and &quot;Parcheesi&quot;). It made its way to England and was sold as &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot;, then the basic concept was introduced in the United States as &quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot;.
The game was popular in ancient India by the name &quot;Moksha Patam&quot;. It was also associated with traditional Hindu philosophy contrasting &quot;karma&quot; and &quot;kama&quot;, or destiny and desire. It emphasized destiny, as opposed to games such as pachisi, which focused on life as a mixture of skill (free will) and luck. The underlying ideals of the game inspired a version introduced in Victorian England in 1892. The game has also been interpreted and used as a tool for teaching the effects of good deeds versus bad. The board was covered with symbolic images used in ancient India, the top featuring gods, angels, and majestic beings, while the rest of the board was covered with pictures of animals, flowers and people. The ladders represented virtues such as generosity, faith, and humility, while the snakes represented vices such as lust, anger, murder, and theft. The morality lesson of the game was that a person can attain liberation (Moksha) through doing good, whereas by doing evil one will be reborn as lower forms of life. The number of ladders was fewer than the number of snakes as a reminder that a path of good is much more difficult to tread than a path of sins. Presumably, reaching the last square (number 100) represented the attainment of &quot;Moksha&quot; (spiritual liberation).

&quot;Gyan chauper&quot;, or &quot;jnan chauper&quot;, (game of wisdom), the version associated with the Jain philosophy, encompassed the concepts like &quot;karma&quot; and &quot;Moksha&quot;. A version popular in the Muslim world is known as &quot;shatranj al-&#x27;urafa&quot; and exists in various versions in India, Iran, and Turkey. In this version, based on sufi philosophy, the game represents the dervish&#x27;s quest to leave behind the trappings of worldly life and achieve union with God.
When the game was brought to England, the Indian virtues and vices were replaced by English ones in hopes of better reflecting Victorian doctrines of morality. Squares of Fulfilment, Grace and Success were accessible by ladders of Thrift, Penitence and Industry and snakes of Indulgence, Disobedience and Indolence caused one to end up in Illness, Disgrace and Poverty. While the Indian version of the game had snakes outnumbering ladders, the English counterpart was more forgiving as it contained equal numbers of each.

The association of Britain&#x27;s snakes and ladders with India and &quot;gyan chauper&quot; began with the returning of colonial families from India during the British Raj. The décor and art of the early English boards of the 20th century reflect this relationship. By the 1940s very few pictorial references to Indian culture remained, due to the economic demands of the war and the collapse of British rule in India. Although the game&#x27;s sense of morality has lasted through the game&#x27;s generations, the physical allusions to religious and philosophical thought in the game as presented in Indian models appear to have all but faded. There has even been evidence of a possible Buddhist version of the game existing in India during the Pala-Sena time period.

In Andhra Pradesh, this game is popularly called or &quot;&quot; (the ladder to salvation) in Telugu. In Hindi, this game is called &quot;Saanp aur Seedhi&quot;, &quot;Saanp Seedhi&quot; and &quot;Mokshapat&quot;. In Tamil Nadu the game is called &quot;Parama padam&quot; and is often played by devotees of Hindu god Vishnu during the Vaikuntha Ekadashi festival in order to stay awake during the night. In Bengali-speaking regions, West Bengal in India and Bangladesh, it is known as &quot;Shap Shiri&quot; or &quot;Shapludu&quot; respectively.

In the original game the squares of virtue are: &quot;Faith&quot; (12), &quot;Reliability&quot; (51), &quot;Generosity&quot; (57), &quot;Knowledge&quot; (76), and &quot;Asceticism&quot; (78). The squares of vice or evil are: &quot;Disobedience&quot; (41), &quot;Vanity&quot; (44), &quot;Vulgarity&quot; (49), &quot;Theft&quot; (52), &quot;Lying&quot; (58), &quot;Drunkenness&quot; (62), &quot;Debt&quot; (69), &quot;Murder&quot; (73), &quot;Rage&quot; (84), &quot;Greed&quot; (92), &quot;Pride&quot; (95), and &quot;Lust&quot; (99).

==Gameplay==

Each player starts with a token on the starting square (usually the &quot;1&quot; grid square in the bottom left corner, or simply, at the edge of the board next to the &quot;1&quot; grid square). Players take turns rolling a single die to move their token by the number of squares indicated by the die rolled. Tokens follow a fixed route marked on the gameboard which usually follows a boustrophedon (ox-plow) track from the bottom to the top of the playing area, passing once through every square. If, on completion of a move, a player&#x27;s token lands on the lower-numbered end of a &quot;ladder&quot;, the player moves the token up to the ladder&#x27;s higher-numbered square. If the player lands on the higher-numbered square of a &quot;snake&quot; (or chute), the player moves the token down to the snake&#x27;s lower-numbered square.

If a &quot;6&quot; is rolled, the player, after moving, immediately rolls again for another turn; otherwise play passes to the next player in turn. The player who is first to bring their token to the last square of the track is the winner.

===Variations===
Variants exists where a player must roll the exact number to reach the final square. Depending on the variation, if the die roll is too large, the token either remains in place or goes off the final square and back again. (For example, if a player requiring a &quot;3&quot; to win rolls a &quot;5&quot;, the token moves forward three spaces, then back two spaces.) In certain circumstances (such as a player rolling a &quot;5&quot; when a &quot;1&quot; is required to win), a player can end up further away from the final square after their move, than before it.

In the book &quot;Winning Ways&quot;, the authors propose a variant that they call &quot;Adders-and-Ladders&quot;, which, unlike the original game, involves skill. Instead of tokens for each player, there is a store of indistinguishable tokens shared by all players. The illustration has five tokens (and a five by five board). There is no die to roll; instead, the player chooses any token and moves it one to four spaces. Whoever moves the last token to the Home space (i.e. the last number) wins.

==Specific editions==
The most widely known edition of snakes and ladders in the United States is &quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot;, released by Milton Bradley in 1943. The playground setting replaced the snakes, which were thought to be disliked by children at the time. It is played on a 10x10 board, and players advance their pieces according to a rather than a die. The theme of the board design is playground equipment, showing children climbing ladders and descending chutes.

The artwork on the board teaches morality lessons: squares on the bottom of the ladders show a child doing a good or sensible deed, at the top of the ladder there is an image of the child enjoying the reward; squares at the top of the chutes show children engaging in mischievous or foolish behavior, on the bottom of the chute the image shows the children suffering the consequences.

Black children were depicted in the Milton Bradley game for the first time in 1974. There have been many pop culture versions of the game, with graphics featuring such children&#x27;s television characters as &quot;Dora the Explorer&quot; and &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. It has been marketed as &quot;The Classic Up and Down Game for Preschoolers&quot;. In 1999, Hasbro released Chutes and Ladders for PCs.

In Canada the game has been traditionally sold as &quot;Snakes and Ladders&quot; and produced by the Canada Games Company. Several Canada-specific versions have been produced over the years, including a version with toboggan runs instead of snakes.

An early British version of the game depicts the path of a young boy and girl making their way through a cartoon railroad and train system.

During the early 1990s in South Africa, &quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot; games made from cardboard were distributed on the back of egg boxes as part of a promotion.

Even though the concept of major virtues against vices and related Eastern spiritualism is not much emphasized in modern incarnations of the game, the central mechanism of snakes and ladders makes it an effective tool for teaching young children about various subjects. In two separate Indonesian schools, the implementation of the game as media in English lessons of fifth graders not only improved the students&#x27; vocabulary but also stimulated their interest and excitement about the learning process. Researchers from Carnegie Mellon University found that pre-schoolers from low income backgrounds who played an hour of numerical board games like snakes and ladders matched the performance of their middle-class counterparts by showing improvements in counting and recognizing number shapes. An eco-inspired version of the game was also used to teach students and teachers about climate change and environmental sustainability.

Meyer et al. (2020) explored on the basis of &quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot; with a free and adaptive game project. This refers on the one hand to systemic game pedagogy. The players and the educators develop the game from ground up and set the rules. The second element of the Monza project is mathematization. Over several years, teachers and learners abstract the game experiences into the language of mathematics.

==Mathematics of the game==

Any version of snakes and ladders can be represented exactly as an absorbing Markov chain, since from any square the odds of moving to any other square are fixed and independent of any previous game history. The Milton Bradley version of &quot;Chutes and Ladders&quot; has 100 squares, with 19 chutes and ladders. A player will need an average of 39.2 spins to move from the starting point, which is off the board, to square 100. A two-player game is expected to end in 47.76 moves with a 50.9% chance of winning for the first player. These calculations are based on a variant where throwing a six does not lead to an additional roll; and where the player does not need to roll the exact number to reach square 100; if they overshoot, the game has still ended.

==In popular culture==
*The phrase &quot;back to square one&quot; originated in the game of snakes and ladders, or at least was influenced by it – the earliest attestation of the phrase refers to the game: &quot;Withal he has the problem of maintaining the interest of the reader who is always being sent back to square one in a sort of intellectual game of snakes and ladders.&quot;
*Snakes &amp; Lattes is a board game café chain headquartered in Toronto, Canada, named after snakes and ladders.

<text>Risk is a strategy board game of diplomacy, conflict and conquest for two to six players. The standard version is played on a board depicting a political map of the world, divided into 42 territories, which are grouped into six continents. Turns rotate among players who control armies of playing pieces with which they attempt to capture territories from other players, with results determined by dice rolls. Players may form and dissolve alliances during the course of the game. The goal of the game is to occupy every territory on the board and, in doing so, eliminate the other players. The game can be lengthy, requiring several hours to multiple days to finish. European versions are structured so that each player has a limited &quot;secret mission&quot; objective that shortens the game.

&quot;Risk&quot; was invented in 1957 by Albert Lamorisse; it became one of the most popular board games in history and inspired other popular games such as &quot;Axis &amp; Allies&quot; and &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot;. The simple rules but complex interactions make it appealing to people of all ages. It is still in production by Hasbro with numerous editions and variants with popular media themes and different rules, including PC software versions, video games, and mobile apps.

==History==
&quot;Risk&quot; was invented by French film director Albert Lamorisse and originally released in 1957 as &quot;La Conquête du Monde&quot; (&quot;The Conquest of the World&quot;) in France. It was bought by Parker Brothers and released in 1959 with some modifications to the rules as &quot;Risk: The Continental Game&quot;, then as &quot;Risk: The Game of Global Domination&quot;.

The first new version of &quot;Risk&quot; was released in 1986. Called &quot;Castle Risk&quot;, it featured a map depicting 18th-century European castles instead of a map of the world, and it was a financial disappointment. In 1993, the rules for &quot;Secret Mission Risk&quot;, which had been the standard in Europe, were added to the United States edition. After a limited special-edition release in 1999, in France, called &quot;Risk: Édition Napoléon&quot; in commemoration of 200th anniversary of the Napoleonic era (1799–1815), a new edition called &quot;Risk: 2210 A.D.&quot; was published in 2001 by Hasbro&#x27;s Avalon Hill division. The game was futuristic-themed, featuring moon territories, ocean territories and commander units and offered a number of expansions. Starting in 2002, &quot;Risk&quot; versions themed around media franchises such as &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and &quot;Transformers&quot; were released, sometimes with as many as six editions per year. A collector&#x27;s edition of classic &quot;Risk&quot; in a bookshelf-format wooden box was issued in 2005 as part of the Parker Brothers Vintage Game series, distributed through Target Stores. In 2008, Winning Moves, a Hasbro licensee, introduced &quot;1959 Risk&quot;, a reproduction of the original Parker Brothers version with original artwork, wooden playing pieces and rules. Many themed versions are currently being published, and new themes continue to be introduced.

In the first editions, the playing pieces were wooden cubes (one set each of black, blue, green, pink, red and yellow) representing one troop each and a few rounded triangular prisms representing ten troops each, but in later versions of the game these pieces were molded of plastic to reduce costs. In the 1980s, these were changed to pieces shaped into the Roman numerals I, III, V, and X. The 1993 edition introduced plastic infantry tokens (representing a single unit), cavalry (representing five units), and artillery (representing ten units). The 40th Anniversary Collector&#x27;s Edition contained the same troop pieces but made of metal rather than plastic. In the 2005 &quot;bookcase&quot; edition, playing pieces are once again wooden cubes.

==Equipment and design==
Equipment includes a large tabletop board depicting a political map of the world, divided into forty-two territories, which are grouped into six continents by color. In addition to shared boundaries between territories which define routes of attack/defense, numerous special trans-oceanic or trans-sea routes are also marked; for example, the route between North Africa and Brazil. The oceans and seas are not part of the playing field.

Each &quot;Risk&quot; game comes with a number of sets (either 5 or 6) of different colored tokens denoting troops. A few different or larger tokens represent multiple (usually 5 or 10) troops. These token types are purely a convention for ease of representing a specific army size. If a player runs out of army pieces during the game, pieces of another color or other symbolic tokens (coins, pieces from other games, etc.) may be substituted to help keep track of armies.

Also included is a deck of &quot;Risk&quot; cards, comprising forty-two territory cards, two wild cards, and twelve or twenty-eight mission cards. The territory cards correspond to the 42 territories on the playing board. Each of the territory cards also depicts a symbol of an infantry, cavalry, or artillery piece. One of these cards is awarded to a player at the end of each turn if the player has successfully conquered at least one territory during that turn. No more than one card may be awarded per turn. If a player collects either three cards with the same symbol, or one of each, or any two plus a wild card, they may be traded in for reinforcements at the beginning of a player&#x27;s turn. These cards can also be used for game set-up. The two wild cards depict infantry, cavalry and artillery pieces. Because these cards have all three symbols, they can match with any two other cards to form a set. The mission cards each specifying some secret mission (something less than &#x27;conquer the world&#x27;) are used in the &quot;Secret Mission Risk&quot; rule variant.

Standard equipment also includes five or six dice in two colors: three red dice for the attacker, and two or three white or blue dice for the defender. There is also a Golden Cavalry piece used to mark the progressive turn-in value of matched sets of territory cards.

In 2022, the iconic Risk logo undertook a rebranding conducted by Toronto-based creative and design agency Quake.

===Territories===
The following is a typical layout of the &quot;Risk&quot; game board, with a table of the corresponding continent and territory names. Each territory on the typical &quot;Risk&quot; game board represents a real-life geographical or political region. As such, the territory borders are drawn to resemble the geography of those regions. This provides an interior space on which to place the army units, adds an element of realism to the game, and also adds complexity. Most of the territories represent a combination of countries or states; some that have names of single countries or states, such as Argentina, do not represent the boundaries of the real-life entity. Antarctica, the Caribbean, New Zealand, and the Philippines are not represented.

The numbers in parentheses represent the number of additional armies granted during the reinforcement stage of a player&#x27;s turn who controls all of the territories in that continent. Some versions of the board use alternative names for some territories. These names are in parentheses. Not all variations occur concurrently.

Notes
== Gameplay ==

Setup consists of determining order of play, issuing armies to players, and allocating the territories on the
board among players, who place one or more armies on each one they own.

At the beginning of a player&#x27;s turn, they receive reinforcement armies proportional to the number of territories
held, bonus armies for holding whole continents, and additional armies for turning in matched sets of territory
cards obtained by conquering 
new territories. The player may then attack, move their armies, or pass.

On a player&#x27;s turn, after they have placed their reinforcements, they may choose to attack territories adjacent to theirs which are occupied by enemy armies. A territory is adjacent if it is connected visibly by land, or by a &quot;sea-lane&quot;. Attacks are decided by dice rolls, with the attacker or defender losing a specified number of
armies per roll. When attacking, a battle may continue until the attacker decides to stop attacking, the attacker has no more armies with which to attack, or the defender has lost their last army at the defending territory, at which point the attacker takes over the territory by moving armies onto it and draws a territory card for that turn.

At the end of a player&#x27;s turn, they may move armies from one of their territories to another &quot;connected&quot; territory.

A player is eliminated from the game when they have lost their last territory. The player that defeated them receive the defeated player&#x27;s territory cards, if any. The victor is the last player remaining when all other players have been eliminated.

There are special rules for two-player games: the territories are divided between the two players and a neutral army
during setup. In play, the neutral army only plays defense when attacked, never attacks or moves armies, and 
doesn&#x27;t have a turn like an active player. If the neutral army is eliminated, the game continues under normal
rules.

Some editions have rules variants regarding how armies or territories are allocated during setup or how armies
may be moved at the end of a turn. There are also variations in the tokens representing armies that don&#x27;t 
affect play. European editions assign each player a secret mission, and the game goes until one player 
completes their mission rather than conquers the world. Different editions have differing numbers of such 
missions. The Italian edition uses a different number of dice in battle. Themed variants have different map 
configurations and substantially different rules.

The rules of some editions describe a variant called &quot;Capital Risk&quot;, where each player has a capital in one of the initially occupied territories. The player to capture all capitals wins. Any armies and territories that belong to the losing nation are turned over to the victor. Capital Risk often leads to much shorter games. Other rules variants for &quot;&quot;Risk&quot; experts&quot; are also listed.

Gaming clubs may also have &quot;house rules&quot; or competition-adjusted rules.

==Strategy==
===Basic strategy===
The official rulebook recommends three basic strategy points for play under the standard rules:
# Players should control entire continents to get the bonus reinforcement armies.
# Players should watch their borders for buildups of armies that could imply an upcoming attack.
# Players should build up armies on their own borders for better defense.

Holding continents is the most common way to increase reinforcements. Players often attempt to gain control of Australia early in the game, since Australia is the only continent that can be successfully defended by heavily fortifying one country (either Siam or Indonesia). Generally, continents with fewer access routes are easier to defend as they possess fewer territories that can be attacked by other players. South America has 2 access points, North America and Africa each have 3, Europe has 4, and Asia has 5.

Generally, it is thought advisable to hold &quot;Risk&quot; cards until they can be turned in for maximum reinforcements. This is especially true earlier on in gameplay, because extra armies make a greater difference in the beginning of the game. Eliminating a weak player who holds a large number of &quot;Risk&quot; cards is also a good strategy, since players who eliminate their opponents get possession of their opponents&#x27; &quot;Risk&quot; cards. In this case, trading in &quot;Risk&quot; cards earlier may help acquire the necessary troops. If the conquering player has six or more &quot;Risk&quot; cards after taking the cards of another player, the cards must be immediately turned in for reinforcements until the player has fewer than five cards and then may continue attacking.

&quot;Turtling&quot; is a defensive strategy where a player who feels vulnerable tries to become too expensive to be removed while remaining a threat to harass other players. The objective of this strategy is to avoid early defeat. A player using this strategy might remain in the game all the way to later stages and then mount an attack on the weakest player and start a chain elimination to remove one player after another to win the game. The player who uses this strategy is called a &quot;turtle&quot;. The term was popularised in real-time strategy games where a player creates a defensive perimeter or a &quot;turtle shell&quot; around the base of operations. Solutions to counteract this strategy using cooperation have been proposed.

===Alliances===
The rules of &quot;Risk&quot; neither endorse nor prohibit alliances or truces. Thus players often form unofficial treaties for various reasons, such as safeguarding themselves from attacks on one border while they concentrate their forces elsewhere, or eliminating a player who has grown too strong. Because these agreements are not enforceable by the rules, they are often broken. Alliance making/breaking can be one of the most important elements of the game, and it adds human interaction to a decidedly probabilistic game. Some players allow trading of &quot;Risk&quot; cards, but only during their turn. This optional rule can make alliances more powerful.

===Attack and defense===
Capturing a territory depends on the number of attacking and defending armies and the associated probabilities. In a battle to completion, a player who has more armies (even just one more) has a significant advantage, whether on attack or defense (the number of attacking armies does not include the minimum one army that must be left behind in the territory).

Defenders always win ties when dice are rolled. This gives the defending player the advantage in &quot;one-on-one&quot; fights, but the attacker&#x27;s ability to use more dice offsets this advantage. It is always advantageous to roll the maximum number of dice, unless an attacker wishes to avoid moving men into a &#x27;dead-end&#x27; territory, in which case they may choose to roll fewer than three. Thus when rolling three dice against two, three against one, or two against one, the attacker has a slight advantage, otherwise the defender has an advantage.

There are online tools available to compute the outcome of whole campaigns (i.e. the attacking of several territories in a row).

&quot;RisiKo!&quot; is a variant of the game released in Italy, in which the defender is allowed to roll up to three dice to defend. This variation dramatically shifts the balance of power towards defense.

==Variant forms of the games==

Many of the official versions of Risk listed above have their own rules which may differ slightly or even significantly from the original game of Risk.

===Variants set on world maps===
* &quot;Risk Legacy.&quot; There are five factions, each with different pieces and rules. This game is the actual originator of the term Legacy game, which means that rules/mechanics are added and changed, previous games permanently affect all future games, and cards are permanently modified and destroyed.

===Variants on regional or country maps===
* &quot;Risk Europe&quot; differs markedly from the original game, in that each territory generates a specific income for the player, and the player can purchase new units based on the amount of revenue received. Also, each unit succeeds in its attack if the player hits a specific number or lower during the attack. Also, a new type of unit known as siege weapons is provided to players. Also, players have different types of units, each with their own types of tactics and attacks. &quot;All&quot; of these game mechanics are notably similar to the basic game-play format of Axis and Allies.
*&quot;Risk: The Battle for Medieval England&quot; is published in conjunction with English Heritage. It includes cards for special powers and special missions. The game board is a map of England. The object is to become the King of England. If no player wins by a certain point in the game, then all players must retreat.

===Variants from existing works of science fiction or fantasy ===
* &quot;.&quot;When playing by the Star Wars Original Trilogy Edition rules, each of the three factions has its own victory condition. The Empire must eliminate all Rebel forces. The Rebel Alliance must find and destroy the Emperor, who will be hidden under one of the Imperial Bases. The Hutts must take control of 10 out of the 13 designated resource planets on the board. The moment one of these victory conditions has been met by the respective faction, the game is over and that faction has won.
* &quot;Risk: Star Trek 50th Anniversary.&quot; has a number of rules, cards and units that differ from the original game. the game has &quot;Q cards&quot; in which Q may assign missions to the player. Also, there are location cards providing a specific value for each location. Also, there are cards representing specific crew members, which each have a specific command value.

===Variants based on concepts from science fiction or fantasy===

* &quot;Risk 2210 A.D.&quot; has numerous rules which differ from the original game. The board includes water and moon territories. Game units include commanders (land, naval, space, nuclear, diplomat). Players earn and spend &quot;energy&quot; to obtain commanders, cards, and space stations and to activate some command cards. Players can roll an 8-sided die in some instances. Armies are not acquired through card trading. The game is only 5 years (turns) long; the winner is the player with highest score at the end of the last year. Players bid energy to determine turn order rather than following the same order determined by a dice from the beginning of the game.

==&quot;Risk&quot; clones by other companies and developers==

Many variants have been published by other groups or companies, that are based on the original concept of the game of &quot;Risk&quot; and that contain much of the functionality of the original, but are not licensed by Hasbro, such as the video games &quot;Global Domination&quot; and &quot;Lux&quot;. Known as &quot;Risk&quot; clones, such variants have names not containing the term &quot;Risk&quot; to avoid legal issues. Some of these clones are available commercially, of which many have been released through the iTunes App Store, especially for the iPad. Several other &quot;Risk&quot; clones are distributed freely over the Internet, such as &quot;Dice Wars&quot;. Games such as &quot;Nintendo Wars&quot; can be seen as a complex evolution which still holds some elements from &quot;Risk&quot;. &quot;NarcoGuerra&quot; is a newsgame based on the basic &quot;Risk&quot; rules, played out over a map of Mexico with the intent of educating people on the Mexican Drug War. An example of a board game inspired by &quot;Risk&quot; is the Argentine &quot;TEG&quot;.

In addition to &quot;Risk&quot; clones, third-party products have been created which slightly modify traditional gameplay. Among the most popular third-party editions are virtual dice-rolling simulators. These can act as virtual replacements to traditional dice or be used to automatically simulate the results of large battles between territories—significantly speeding up gameplay.

==Video games==
Several video game versions of &quot;Risk&quot; have been released as &quot;Risk&quot;, starting with the Commodore 64 edition in 1988 and the Macintosh edition in 1989. Various other editions have been released for PC, Amiga, Sega Genesis, PlayStation, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and Nintendo Switch. In 1996 Hasbro Interactive released a PC version of &quot;Risk&quot; that included a new variation on the game called &quot;Ultimate Risk&quot;, which did not use dice but rather implemented the use of forts, generals, and complex battle strategies. &quot;Risk II&quot; for PC and Mac was released as a 2000 video game which includes classic &quot;Risk&quot; as well as board and gameplay variations. In 2010, Pogo.com added a licensed version of &quot;Risk&quot; to its library of online games. An Xbox Live Arcade version of &quot;Risk&quot; called &quot;&quot; was released on June 23, 2010. It includes classic &quot;Risk&quot; as well as a factions mode where players can play as Zombies, Robots, Cats, Soldiers, or Yetis.

As of August 6, 2014, Hasbro and Ubisoft produced a new game for &quot;Risk&quot; on PS4 and Xbox One, as well as Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. The game, developed by Zoë Mode and published by Ubisoft, was released in February 2015. A standalone game, &quot;Risk: Urban Assault&quot;, was released in August 2016. It was subsequently ported to the Nintendo Switch, releasing on October 30, 2018.

A licensed iOS app, &quot;Risk: The Official Game&quot;, developed for the iPhone, iPod Touch, and iPad by Electronic Arts, was released on July 16, 2010. Although the iPad version (&quot;Risk&quot; HD) has to be bought separately from the iPhone version (&quot;Risk&quot;), local link up allows games to take place across versions. A maximum of six players can participate. If only one iOS device is available, the &quot;pass and play&quot; mode allows several players to take part in a multi-player game.

Another licensed video game version, &quot;RISK: Global Domination&quot;, was released in 2015 for iOS, Android and Windows. Developed by SMG Studio, this version includes device sharing, cross-platform online multiplayer, and single player versus computer modes.

==Television series adaptation==
On January 11, 2021, it was reported that a television series adaptation of the game is in development from &quot;House of Cards&quot; creator, Beau Willimon.

==Reception==
&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Risk&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1980&quot;, praising it as &quot;a classic&quot; as established by its &quot;attractive playing equipment, seesawing battles, and limitless opportunities for changing rules and making up new variations of the game&quot;.

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Risk&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1981&quot;, noting that an advantage of the game is that &quot;it&#x27;s easy to make up new variations, tailored to your tastes&quot;.

&quot;Games&quot; magazine included &quot;Risk&quot; in their &quot;Top 100 Games of 1982&quot;, noting that &quot;Even the most peace-loving tend to grow aggressive in this game of global conquest&quot;.

<doc id="38375" wikidata="Q11903" url="?curid=38375" title="Hypatia">
<text>Hypatia (born 350–370 - March 415 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician who lived in Alexandria, Egypt: at that time a major city of the Eastern Roman Empire. In Alexandria, Hypatia was a prominent thinker who taught subjects including philosophy and astronomy., and in her lifetime was renowned as a great teacher and a wise counselor. Not the only fourth century Alexandrian female mathematician, Hypatia was preceded by Pandrosion. However, Hypatia is the first female mathematician whose life is reasonably well recorded. She wrote a commentary on Diophantus&#x27;s thirteen-volume &quot;Arithmetica&quot;, which may survive in part, having been interpolated into Diophantus&#x27;s original text, and another commentary on Apollonius of Perga&#x27;s treatise on conic sections, which has not survived. Many modern scholars also believe that Hypatia may have edited the surviving text of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, based on the title of her father Theon&#x27;s commentary on Book III of the &quot;Almagest&quot;.

Hypatia constructed astrolabes and hydrometers, but did not invent either of these, which were both in use long before she was born. She was tolerant toward Christians and taught many Christian students, including Synesius, the future bishop of Ptolemais. Ancient sources record that Hypatia was widely beloved by pagans and Christians alike and that she established great influence with the political elite in Alexandria. Toward the end of her life, Hypatia advised Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was in the midst of a political feud with Cyril, the bishop of Alexandria. Rumors spread accusing her of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril and, in March 415 AD, she was murdered by a mob of Christians led by a lector named Peter.

Hypatia&#x27;s murder shocked the empire and transformed her into a &quot;martyr for philosophy&quot;, leading future Neoplatonists such as the historian Damascius () to become increasingly fervent in their opposition to Christianity. During the Middle Ages, Hypatia was co-opted as a symbol of Christian virtue and scholars believe she was part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria. During the Age of Enlightenment, she became a symbol of opposition to Catholicism. In the nineteenth century, European literature, especially Charles Kingsley&#x27;s 1853 novel &quot;Hypatia&quot;, romanticized her as &quot;the last of the Hellenes&quot;. In the twentieth century, Hypatia became seen as an icon for women&#x27;s rights and a precursor to the feminist movement. Since the late twentieth century, some portrayals have associated Hypatia&#x27;s death with the destruction of the Library of Alexandria, despite the historical fact that the library no longer existed during Hypatia&#x27;s lifetime.

== Life ==
===Upbringing===
Hypatia was the daughter of the mathematician Theon of Alexandria (). According to classical historian Edward J. Watts, Theon was the head of a school called the &quot;Mouseion&quot;, which was named in emulation of the Hellenistic Mouseion, whose membership had ceased in the 260s AD. Theon&#x27;s school was exclusive, highly prestigious, and doctrinally conservative. Theon rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and may have taken pride in teaching a pure, Plotinian Neoplatonism. Although he was widely seen as a great mathematician at the time, Theon&#x27;s mathematical work has been deemed by modern standards as essentially &quot;minor&quot;, &quot;trivial&quot;, and &quot;completely unoriginal&quot;. His primary achievement was the production of a new edition of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, in which he corrected scribal errors that had been made over the course of nearly 700 years of copying. Theon&#x27;s edition of Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot; became the most widely used edition of the textbook for centuries and almost totally supplanted all other editions.

Nothing is known about Hypatia&#x27;s mother, who is never mentioned in any of the extant sources. Theon dedicates his commentary on Book IV of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot; to an individual named Epiphanius, addressing him as &quot;my dear son&quot;, indicating that he may have been Hypatia&#x27;s brother, but the Greek word Theon uses (&quot;teknon&quot;) does not always mean &quot;son&quot; in the biological sense and was often used merely to signal strong feelings of paternal connection. Hypatia&#x27;s exact year of birth is still under debate, with suggested dates ranging from 350 to 370 AD. Many scholars have followed Richard Hoche in inferring that Hypatia was born around 370. According to Damascius&#x27;s lost work &quot;Life of Isidore,&quot; preserved in the entry for Hypatia in the &quot;Suda&quot;, a tenth-century Byzantine encyclopedia, Hypatia flourished during the reign of Arcadius. Hoche reasoned that Damascius&#x27;s description of her physical beauty would imply that she was at most 30 at that time, and the year 370 was 30 years prior to the midpoint of Arcadius&#x27;s reign. In contrast, theories that she was born as early as 350 are based on the wording of the chronicler John Malalas (c. 491 – 578), who calls her old at the time of her death in 415. Robert Penella argues that both theories are weakly based, and that her birth date should be left unspecified.

===Career===
Hypatia was a Neoplatonist, but, like her father, she rejected the teachings of Iamblichus and instead embraced the original Neoplatonism formulated by Plotinus. The Alexandrian school was renowned at the time for its philosophy, and Alexandria was regarded as second only to Athens as the philosophical capital of the Greco-Roman world. Hypatia taught students from all over the Mediterranean. According to Damascius, she lectured on the writings of Plato and Aristotle. He also states that she walked through Alexandria in a &quot;tribon&quot;, a kind of cloak associated with philosophers, giving impromptu public lectures.

According to Watts, two main varieties of Neoplatonism were taught in Alexandria during the late fourth century. The first was the overtly pagan religious Neoplatonism taught at the Serapeum, which was greatly influenced by the teachings of Iamblichus. The second variety was the more moderate and less polemical variety championed by Hypatia and her father Theon, which was based on the teachings of Plotinus. Although Hypatia was a pagan, she was tolerant of Christians. In fact, every one of her known students was Christian. One of her most prominent pupils was Synesius of Cyrene, who went on to become a bishop of Ptolemais (now in eastern Libya) in 410. Afterward, he continued to exchange letters with Hypatia and his extant letters are the main sources of information about her career. Seven letters by Synesius to Hypatia have survived, but none from her addressed to him are extant. In a letter written in around 395 to his friend Herculianus, Synesius describes Hypatia as &quot;... a person so renowned, her reputation seemed literally incredible. We have seen and heard for ourselves she who honorably presides over the mysteries of philosophy.&quot; Synesius preserves the legacy of Hypatia&#x27;s opinions and teachings, such as the pursuit of &quot;the philosophical state of apatheiacomplete liberation from emotions and affections&quot;.

The Christian historian Socrates of Constantinople, a contemporary of Hypatia, describes her in his &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot;:

Philostorgius, another Christian historian, who was also a contemporary of Hypatia, states that she excelled her father in mathematics and the lexicographer Hesychius of Alexandria records that, like her father, she was also an extraordinarily talented astronomer. Damascius writes that Hypatia was &quot;exceedingly beautiful and fair of form&quot;, but nothing else is known regarding her physical appearance and no ancient depictions of her have survived. Damascius states that Hypatia remained a lifelong virgin and that, when one of the men who came to her lectures tried to court her, she tried to soothe his lust by playing the lyre. When he refused to abandon his pursuit, she rejected him outright, displaying her bloody menstrual rags and declaring &quot;This is what you really love, my young man, but you do not love beauty for its own sake.&quot; Damascius further relates that the young man was so traumatized that he abandoned his desires for her immediately.

==Death==
===Background===
From 382 – 412, the bishop of Alexandria was Theophilus. Theophilus was militantly opposed to Iamblichean Neoplatonism and, in 391, he demolished the Serapeum. Despite this, Theophilus tolerated Hypatia&#x27;s school and seems to have regarded Hypatia as his ally. Theophilus supported the bishopric of Hypatia&#x27;s pupil Synesius, who describes Theophilus in his letters with love and admiration. Theophilus also permitted Hypatia to establish close relationships with the Roman prefects and other prominent political leaders. Partly as a result of Theophilus&#x27;s tolerance, Hypatia became extremely popular with the people of Alexandria and exerted profound political influence.

Theophilus died unexpectedly in 412. He had been training his nephew Cyril, but had not officially named him as his successor. A violent power struggle over the diocese broke out between Cyril and his rival Timothy. Cyril won and immediately began to punish the opposing faction; he closed the churches of the Novatianists, who had supported Timothy, and confiscated their property. Hypatia&#x27;s school seems to have immediately taken a strong distrust toward the new bishop, as evidenced by the fact that, in all his vast correspondences, Synesius only ever wrote one letter to Cyril, in which he treats the younger bishop as inexperienced and misguided. In a letter written to Hypatia in 413, Synesius requests her to intercede on behalf of two individuals impacted by the ongoing civil strife in Alexandria, insisting, &quot;You always have power, and you can bring about good by using that power.&quot; He also reminds her that she had taught him that a Neoplatonic philosopher must introduce the highest moral standards to political life and act for the benefit of their fellow citizens.

According to Socrates Scholasticus, in 414, following an exchange of hostilities and a Jewish-led massacre, Cyril closed all the synagogues in Alexandria, confiscated all the property belonging to the Jews, and expelled a number of Jews from the city; Scholasticus suggests all the Jews were expelled, while John of Nikiu notes it was only those involved in the massacre. Orestes, the Roman prefect of Alexandria, who was also a close friend of Hypatia and a recent convert to Christianity, was outraged by Cyril&#x27;s actions and sent a scathing report to the emperor. The conflict escalated and a riot broke out in which the &quot;parabalani&quot;, a group of Christian clerics under Cyril&#x27;s authority, nearly killed Orestes. As punishment, Orestes had Ammonius, the monk who had started the riot, publicly tortured to death. Cyril tried to proclaim Ammonius a martyr, but Christians in Alexandria were disgusted, since Ammonius had been killed for inciting a riot and attempting to murder the governor, not for his faith. Prominent Alexandrian Christians intervened and forced Cyril to drop the matter. Nonetheless, Cyril&#x27;s feud with Orestes continued. Orestes frequently consulted Hypatia for advice because she was well-liked among both pagans and Christians alike, she had not been involved in any previous stages of the conflict, and she had an impeccable reputation as a wise counselor.

Despite Hypatia&#x27;s popularity, Cyril and his allies attempted to discredit her and undermine her reputation. Socrates Scholasticus mentions rumors accusing Hypatia of preventing Orestes from reconciling with Cyril. Traces of other rumors that spread among the Christian populace of Alexandria may be found in the writings of the seventh-century Egyptian Coptic bishop John of Nikiû, who alleges in his &quot;Chronicle&quot; that Hypatia had engaged in satanic practices and had intentionally hampered the church&#x27;s influence over Orestes:

And in those days there appeared in Alexandria a female philosopher, a pagan named Hypatia, and she was devoted at all times to magic, astrolabes and instruments of music, and she beguiled many people through her Satanic wiles. And the governor of the city honoured her exceedingly; for she had beguiled him through her magic. And he ceased attending church as had been his custom... And he not only did this, but he drew many believers to her, and he himself received the unbelievers at his house.

===Murder===
According to Socrates Scholasticus, during the Christian season of Lent in March 415, a mob of Christians under the leadership of a lector named Peter raided Hypatia&#x27;s carriage as she was travelling home. They dragged her into a building known as the &quot;Kaisarion&quot;, a former pagan temple and center of the Roman imperial cult in Alexandria that had been converted into a Christian church. There, the mob stripped Hypatia naked and murdered her using &quot;ostraka&quot;, which can either be translated as &quot;roof tiles&quot;, &quot;oyster shells&quot; or simply &quot;shards&quot;. Damascius adds that they also cut out her eyeballs. They tore her body into pieces and dragged her limbs through the town to a place called Cinarion, where they set them on fire. According to Watts, this was in line with the traditional manner in which Alexandrians carried the bodies of the &quot;vilest criminals&quot; outside the city limits to cremate them as a way of symbolically purifying the city. Although Socrates Scholasticus never explicitly identifies Hypatia&#x27;s murderers, they are commonly assumed to have been members of the &quot;parabalani&quot;. Christopher Haas disputes this identification, arguing that the murderers were more likely &quot;a crowd of Alexandrian laymen&quot;.

Socrates Scholasticus presents Hypatia&#x27;s murder as entirely politically motivated and makes no mention of any role that Hypatia&#x27;s paganism might have played in her death. Instead, he reasons that &quot;she fell a victim to the political jealousy which at that time prevailed. For as she had frequent interviews with Orestes, it was calumniously reported among the Christian populace that it was she who prevented Orestes from being reconciled to the bishop.&quot; Socrates Scholasticus unequivocally condemns the actions of the mob, declaring, &quot;Surely nothing can be farther from the spirit of Christianity than the allowance of massacres, fights, and transactions of that sort.&quot;

The Canadian mathematician Ari Belenkiy has argued that Hypatia may have been involved in a controversy over the date of the Christian holiday of Easter 417 and that she was killed on the vernal equinox while making astronomical observations. Classical scholars Alan Cameron and Edward J. Watts both dismiss this hypothesis, noting that there is absolutely no evidence in any ancient text to support any part of the hypothesis.

===Aftermath===
Hypatia&#x27;s death sent shockwaves throughout the empire; for centuries, philosophers had been seen as effectively untouchable during the displays of public violence that sometimes occurred in Roman cities and the murder of a female philosopher at the hand of a mob was seen as &quot;profoundly dangerous and destabilizing&quot;. Although no concrete evidence was ever discovered definitively linking Cyril to the murder of Hypatia, it was widely believed that he had ordered it. Even if Cyril had not directly ordered the murder, his smear campaign against Hypatia had inspired it. The Alexandrian council was alarmed at Cyril&#x27;s conduct and sent an embassy to Constantinople. The advisors of Theodosius II launched an investigation to determine Cyril&#x27;s role in the murder.

The investigation resulted in the emperors Honorius and Theodosius II issuing an edict in autumn of 416, which attempted to remove the &quot;parabalani&quot; from Cyril&#x27;s power and instead place them under the authority of Orestes. The edict restricted the parabalani from attending &quot;any public spectacle whatever&quot; or entering &quot;the meeting place of a municipal council or a courtroom.&quot; It also severely restricted their recruitment by limiting the total number of parabalani to no more than five hundred. According to Damascius, Cyril allegedly only managed to escape even more serious punishment by bribing one of Theodosius&#x27;s officials. Watts argues that Hypatia&#x27;s murder was the turning point in Cyril&#x27;s fight to gain political control of Alexandria. Hypatia had been the linchpin holding Orestes&#x27;s opposition against Cyril together, and, without her, the opposition quickly collapsed. Two years later, Cyril overturned the law placing the &quot;parabalani&quot; under Orestes&#x27;s control and, by the early 420s, Cyril had come to dominate the Alexandrian council.

==Works==
Hypatia has been described as a universal genius, but she was probably more of a teacher and commentator than an innovator. No evidence has been found that Hypatia ever published any independent works on philosophy and she does not appear to have made any groundbreaking mathematical discoveries. During Hypatia&#x27;s time period, scholars preserved classical mathematical works and commented on them to develop their arguments, rather than publishing original works. It has also been suggested that the closure of the Mouseion and the destruction of the Serapeum may have led Hypatia and her father to focus their efforts on preserving seminal mathematical books and making them accessible to their students. The &quot;Suda&quot; mistakenly states that all of Hypatia&#x27;s writings have been lost, but modern scholarship has identified several works by her as extant. This kind of authorial uncertainty is typical of female philosophers from antiquity. Hypatia wrote in Greek, which was the language spoken by most educated people in the Eastern Mediterranean at the time. In classical antiquity, astronomy was seen as being essentially mathematical in character. Furthermore, no distinction was made between mathematics and numerology or astronomy and astrology.

===Edition of the &quot;Almagest&quot;===
Hypatia is now known to have edited the existing text of Book III of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;. It was once thought that Hypatia had merely revised Theon&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Almagest&quot;, based on the title of Theon&#x27;s commentary on the third book of &quot;Almagest&quot;, which reads &quot;Commentary by Theon of Alexandria on Book III of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, edition revised by my daughter Hypatia, the philosopher&quot;, but, based on analysis of the titles of Theon&#x27;s other commentaries and similar titles from the time period, scholars have concluded that Hypatia corrected, not her father&#x27;s commentary, but the text of &quot;Almagest&quot; itself. Her contribution is thought to be an improved method for the long division algorithms needed for astronomical computation. The Ptolemaic model of the universe was geocentric, meaning it taught that the Sun revolved around the Earth. In the &quot;Almagest&quot;, Ptolemy proposed a division problem for calculating the number of degrees swept out by the Sun in a single day as it orbits the Earth. In his early commentary, Theon had tried to improve upon Ptolemy&#x27;s division calculation. In the text edited by Hypatia, a tabular method is detailed. This tabular method might be the &quot;astronomical table&quot; which historic sources attribute to Hypatia. Classicist Alan Cameron additionally states that it is possible Hypatia may have edited, not only Book III, but all nine extant books of the &quot;Almagest&quot;.

===Independent writings===
Hypatia wrote a commentary on Diophantus&#x27;s thirteen-volume &quot;Arithmetica&quot;, which had been written sometime around the year 250 AD. It set out more than 100 mathematical problems, for which solutions are proposed using algebra. For centuries, scholars believed that this commentary had been lost. Only volumes one through six of the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; have survived in the original Greek, but at least four additional volumes have been preserved in an Arabic translation produced around the year 860. The Arabic text contains numerous expansions not found in the Greek text, including verifications of Diophantus&#x27;s examples and additional problems.

Cameron states that the most likely source of the additional material is Hypatia, since Hypatia is the only ancient writer known to have written a commentary on the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; and the additions appear to follow the same methods used by her father Theon. The first person to deduce that the additional material in the Arabic manuscripts came from Hypatia was the nineteenth-century scholar Paul Tannery. In 1885, Sir Thomas Heath published the first English translation of the surviving portion of the &quot;Arithmetica&quot;. Heath argued that surviving text of &quot;Arithmetica&quot; is actually a school edition produced by Hypatia to aid her students. According to Mary Ellen Waithe, Hypatia used an unusual algorithm for division (in the then-standard sexagesimal numeral system), making it easy for scholars to pick out which parts of the text she had written.

The consensus that Hypatia&#x27;s commentary is the source of the additional material in the Arabic manuscripts of the &quot;Arithmetica&quot; has been challenged by Wilbur Knorr, a historian of mathematics, who argues that the interpolations are &quot;of such low level as not to require any real mathematical insight&quot; and that the author of the interpolations can only have been &quot;an essentially trivial mind... in direct conflict with ancient testimonies of Hypatia&#x27;s high caliber as a philosopher and mathematician.&quot; Cameron rejects this argument, noting that &quot;Theon too enjoyed a high reputation, yet his surviving work has been judged &#x27;completely unoriginal.&#x27;&quot; Cameron also insists that &quot;Hypatia&#x27;s work on Diophantus was what we today might call a school edition, designed for the use of students rather than professional mathematicians.&quot;

Hypatia also wrote a commentary on Apollonius of Perga&#x27;s work on conic sections, but this commentary is not extant. She also created an &quot;Astronomical Canon&quot;; this is believed to have been either a new edition of the &quot;Handy Tables&quot; by the Alexandrian Ptolemy or the aforementioned commentary on his &quot;Almagest&quot;. Based on a close reading in comparison with her supposed contributions to the work of Diophantus, Knorr suggests that Hypatia may also have edited Archimedes&#x27; &quot;Measurement of a Circle&quot;, an anonymous text on isometric figures, and a text later used by John of Tynemouth in his work on Archimedes&#x27; measurement of the sphere. A high degree of mathematical accomplishment would have been needed to comment on Apollonius&#x27;s advanced mathematics or the astronomical Canon. Because of this, most scholars today recognize that Hypatia must have been among the leading mathematicians of her day.

===Reputed inventions===
One of Synesius&#x27;s letters describes Hypatia as having taught him how to construct a silver plane astrolabe as a gift for an official. An astrolabe is a device used to calculate date and time based on the positions of the stars and planets. It can also be used to predict where the stars and planets will be on any given date. A &quot;little astrolabe&quot;, or &quot;plane astrolabe&quot;, is a kind of astrolabe that used stereographic projection of the celestial sphere to represent the heavens on a plane surface, as opposed to an armillary sphere, which was globe-shaped. Armillary spheres were large and normally used for display, whereas a plane astrolabe was portable and could be used for practical measurements.

The statement from Synesius&#x27;s letter has sometimes been wrongly interpreted to mean that Hypatia invented the plane astrolabe, but the plane astrolabe was in use at least 500 years before Hypatia was born. Hypatia may have learned how to construct a plane astrolabe from her father Theon, who had written two treatises on astrolabes: one entitled &quot;Memoirs on the Little Astrolabe&quot; and another study on the armillary sphere in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;. Theon&#x27;s treatise is now lost, but it was well known to the Syrian bishop Severus Sebokht (575–667), who describes its contents in his own treatise on astrolabes. Hypatia and Theon may have also studied Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Planisphaerium&quot;, which describes the calculations necessary in order to construct an astrolabe. Synesius&#x27;s wording indicates that Hypatia did not design or construct the astrolabe, but acted as a guide and mentor during the process of constructing it.

In another letter, Synesius requests Hypatia to construct him a &quot;hydroscope&quot;, a device now known as a hydrometer, to determine the density or specific gravity of liquids. Based on this request, it has been claimed that Hypatia invented the hydrometer. The minute detail in which Synesius describes the instrument, however, indicates that he assumes she has never heard of the device, but trusts she will be able to replicate it based on a verbal description. Hydrometers were based on Archimedes&#x27; 3rd century BC principles, may have been invented by him, and were being described by the 2nd century AD in a poem by the Roman author Remnius. Although modern authors frequently credit Hypatia with having developed a variety of other inventions, these other attributions may all be discounted as spurious. Booth concludes, &quot;The modern day reputation held by Hypatia as a philosopher, mathematician, astronomer, and mechanical inventor, is disproportionate to the amount of surviving evidence of her life&#x27;s work. This reputation is either built on myth or hearsay as opposed to evidence. Either that or we are missing all of the evidence that would support it.&quot;

==Legacy==
===Antiquity===
Neoplatonism and paganism both survived for centuries after Hypatia&#x27;s death, and new academic lecture halls continued to be built in Alexandria after her death. Over the next 200 years, Neoplatonist philosophers such as Hierocles of Alexandria, John Philoponus, Simplicius of Cilicia, and Olympiodorus the Younger made astronomical observations, taught mathematics, and wrote lengthy commentaries on the works of Plato and Aristotle. Hypatia was not the last female Neoplatonist philosopher; later ones include Aedesia, Asclepigenia, and Theodora of Emesa.

According to Watts, however, Hypatia had no appointed successor, no spouse, and no offspring and her sudden death not only left her legacy unprotected, but also triggered a backlash against her entire ideology. Hypatia, with her tolerance toward Christian students and her willingness to cooperate with Christian leaders, had hoped to establish a precedent that Neoplatonism and Christianity could coexist peacefully and cooperatively. Instead, her death and the subsequent failure by the Christian government to impose justice on her killers destroyed that notion entirely and led future Neoplatonists such as Damascius to consider Christian bishops as &quot;dangerous, jealous figures who were also utterly unphilosophical.&quot; Hypatia became seen as a &quot;martyr for philosophy&quot;, and her murder led philosophers to adopt attitudes that increasingly emphasized the pagan aspects of their beliefs system and helped create a sense of identity for philosophers as pagan traditionalists set apart from the Christian masses. Thus, while Hypatia&#x27;s death did not bring an end to Neoplatonist philosophy as a whole, Watts argues that it did bring an end to her particular variety of it.

Shortly after Hypatia&#x27;s murder, a forged anti-Christian letter appeared under her name. Damascius was &quot;anxious to exploit the scandal of Hypatia&#x27;s death&quot;, and attributed responsibility for her murder to Bishop Cyril and his Christian followers. A passage from Damascius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Isidore&quot;, preserved in the &quot;Suda&quot;, concludes that Hypatia&#x27;s murder was due to Cyril&#x27;s envy over &quot;her wisdom exceeding all bounds and especially in the things concerning astronomy&quot;. Damascius&#x27;s account of the Christian murder of Hypatia is the sole historical source attributing direct responsibility to Bishop Cyril. At the same time, Damascius was not entirely kind to Hypatia either; he characterizes her as nothing more than a wandering Cynic, and compares her unfavorably with his own teacher Isidore of Alexandria, remarking that &quot;Isidorus greatly outshone Hypatia, not just as a man does over a woman, but in the way a genuine philosopher will over a mere geometer.&quot;

===Middle Ages===
Hypatia&#x27;s death was similar to those of Christian martyrs in Alexandria, who had been dragged through the streets during the Decian persecution in 250. Other aspects of Hypatia&#x27;s life also fit the mold for a Christian martyr, especially her lifelong virginity. In the Early Middle Ages, Christians conflated Hypatia&#x27;s death with stories of the Decian martyrs and she became part of the basis for the legend of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a virgin martyr said to have been exceedingly wise and well-educated. The earliest attestation for the cult of Saint Catherine comes from the eighth century, around three hundred years after Hypatia&#x27;s death. One story tells of Saint Catherine being confronted by fifty pagan philosophers seeking to convert her, but instead converting all of them to Christianity through her eloquence. Another legend claimed that Saint Catherine had been a student of Athanasius of Alexandria. In the Laodikeia of Asia Minor (today Denizli in Turkey) until late 19th century Hypatia was venerated as identical to St. Catherine.

The Byzantine &quot;Suda&quot; encyclopedia contains a very long entry about Hypatia, which summarizes two different accounts of her life. The first eleven lines come from one source and the rest of the entry comes from Damascius&#x27;s &quot;Life of Isidore&quot;. Most of the first eleven lines of the entry probably come from Hesychius&#x27;s &quot;Onomatologos&quot;, but some parts are of unknown origin, including a claim that she was &quot;the wife of Isidore the Philosopher&quot; (apparently Isidore of Alexandria). Watts describes this as a very puzzling claim, not only because Isidore of Alexandria was not born until long after Hypatia&#x27;s death, and no other philosopher of that name contemporary with Hypatia is known, but also because it contradicts Damascius&#x27;s own statement quoted in the same entry about Hypatia being a lifelong virgin. Watts suggests that someone probably misunderstood the meaning of the word &quot;gynē&quot; used by Damascius to describe Hypatia in his &quot;Life of Isidore&quot;, since the same word can mean either &quot;woman&quot; or &quot;wife&quot;.

The Byzantine and Christian intellectual Photios ( 810/820–893) includes both Damascius&#x27;s account of Hypatia and Socrates Scholasticus&#x27;s in his &quot;Bibliotheke&quot;. In his own comments, Photios remarks on Hypatia&#x27;s great fame as a scholar, but does not mention her death, perhaps indicating that he saw her scholarly work as more significant. The intellectual Eudokia Makrembolitissa (1021–1096), the second wife of Byzantine emperor Constantine X Doukas, was described by the historian Nicephorus Gregoras as a &quot;second Hypatia&quot;.

===Early modern period===
Early eighteenth-century Deist scholar John Toland used the murder of Hypatia as the basis for an anti-Catholic tract, portraying Hypatia&#x27;s death in the worst possible light by changing the story and inventing elements not found in any of the ancient sources. A 1721 response by Thomas Lewis defended Cyril, rejected Damascius&#x27;s account as unreliable because its author was &quot;a heathen&quot; and argued that Socrates Scholasticus was &quot;a Puritan&quot;, who was consistently biased against Cyril.

Voltaire, in his &quot;Examen important de Milord Bolingbroke ou le tombeau de fanatisme&quot; (1736) interpreted Hypatia as a believer in &quot;the laws of rational Nature&quot; and &quot;the capacities of the human mind free of dogmas&quot; and described her death as &quot;a bestial murder perpetrated by Cyril&#x27;s tonsured hounds, with a fanatical gang at their heels&quot;. Later, in an entry for his &quot;Dictionnaire philosophique&quot; (1772), Voltaire again portrayed Hypatia as a freethinking deistic genius brutally murdered by ignorant and misunderstanding Christians. Most of the entry ignores Hypatia altogether and instead deals with the controversy over whether or not Cyril was responsible for her death. Voltaire concludes with the snide remark that &quot;When one strips beautiful women naked, it is not to massacre them.&quot;

In his monumental work &quot;The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, the English historian Edward Gibbon expanded on Toland and Voltaire&#x27;s misleading portrayals by declaring Cyril as the sole cause of all evil in Alexandria at the beginning of the fifth century and construing Hypatia&#x27;s murder as evidence to support his thesis that the rise of Christianity hastened the decline of the Roman Empire. He remarks on Cyril&#x27;s continued veneration as a Christian saint, commenting that &quot;superstition [Christianity] perhaps would more gently expiate the blood of a virgin, than the banishment of a saint.&quot; In response to these accusations, Catholic authors, as well as some French Protestants, insisted with increased vehemence that Cyril had absolutely no involvement in Hypatia&#x27;s murder and that Peter the Lector was solely responsible. In the course of these heated debates, Hypatia tended to be cast aside and ignored, while the debates focused far more intently on the question of whether Peter the Lector had acted alone or under Cyril&#x27;s orders.

===Nineteenth century===
In the nineteenth century European literary authors spun the legend of Hypatia as part of neo-Hellenism, a movement that romanticised ancient Greeks and their values. Interest in the &quot;literary legend of Hypatia&quot; began to rise. Diodata Saluzzo Roero&#x27;s 1827 &quot;Ipazia ovvero delle Filosofie&quot; suggested that Cyril had actually converted Hypatia to Christianity, and that she had been killed by a &quot;treacherous&quot; priest.
In his 1852 &quot;Hypatie&quot; and 1857 &quot;Hypathie et Cyrille&quot;, French poet Charles Leconte de Lisle portrayed Hypatia as the epitome of &quot;vulnerable truth and beauty&quot;. Leconte de Lisle&#x27;s first poem portrayed Hypatia as a woman born after her time, a victim of the laws of history. His second poem reverted to the eighteenth-century Deistic portrayal of Hypatia as the victim of Christian brutality, but with the twist that Hypatia tries and fails to convince Cyril that Neoplatonism and Christianity are actually fundamentally the same. Charles Kingsley&#x27;s 1853 novel &quot;Hypatia; Or, New Foes with an Old Face&quot; was originally intended as a historical treatise, but instead became a typical mid-Victorian romance with a militantly anti-Catholic message, portraying Hypatia as a &quot;helpless, pretentious, and erotic heroine&quot; with the &quot;spirit of Plato and the body of Aphrodite.&quot;

Kingsley&#x27;s novel was tremendously popular; it was translated into several European languages and remained continuously in print for the rest of the century. It promoted the romantic vision of Hypatia as &quot;the last of the Hellenes&quot; and was quickly adapted into a broad variety of stage productions, the first of which was a play written by Elizabeth Bowers, performed in Philadelphia in 1859, starring the writer in the titular role. On 2 January 1893, a much higher-profile stage play adaptation &quot;Hypatia&quot;, written by G. Stuart Ogilvie and produced by Herbert Beerbohm Tree, opened at the Haymarket Theatre in London. The title role was initially played by Julia Neilson, and it featured an elaborate musical score written by the composer Hubert Parry. The novel also spawned works of visual art, including an 1867 image portraying Hypatia as a young woman by the early photographer Julia Margaret Cameron and an 1885 painting by Charles William Mitchell showing a nude Hypatia standing before an altar in a church.

At the same time, European philosophers and scientists described Hypatia as the last representative of science and free inquiry before a &quot;long medieval decline&quot;. In 1843, German authors Soldan and Heppe argued in their highly influential &quot;History of the Witchcraft Trials&quot; that Hypatia may have been, in effect, the first famous &quot;witch&quot; punished under Christian authority (see witch-hunt).

Hypatia was honored as an astronomer when 238 Hypatia, a main belt asteroid discovered in 1884, was named for her. The lunar crater &quot;Hypatia&quot; was also named for her, in addition to craters named for her father Theon. The 180 km &quot;Rimae Hypatia&quot; are located north of the crater, one degree south of the equator, along the Mare Tranquillitatis.

===Twentieth century===
In 1908, American writer Elbert Hubbard published a putative biography of Hypatia in his series &quot;Little Journeys to the Homes of Great Teachers&quot;. The book is almost entirely a work of fiction. In it, Hubbard relates a completely made-up physical exercise program which he claims Theon established for his daughter, involving &quot;fishing, horseback-riding, and rowing&quot;. He claims that Theon taught Hypatia to &quot;Reserve your right to think, for even to think wrongly is better than to never think at all.&quot; Hubbard claims that, as a young woman, Hypatia traveled to Athens, where she studied under Plutarch of Athens. All of this supposed biographical information, however, is completely fictional and is not found in any ancient source. Hubbard even attributes to Hypatia numerous completely fabricated quotations in which she presents modern, rationalist views. The cover illustration for the book, a drawing of Hypatia by artist Jules Maurice Gaspard showing her as a beautiful young woman with her wavy hair tied back in the classical style, has now become the most iconic and widely reproduced image of her.

Around the same time, Hypatia was adopted by feminists, and her life and death began to be viewed in the light of the women&#x27;s rights movement. The author Carlo Pascal claimed in 1908 that her murder was an anti-feminist act and brought about a change in the treatment of women, as well as the decline of the Mediterranean civilization in general. Dora Russell published a book on the inadequate education of women and inequality with the title &quot;Hypatia or Woman and Knowledge&quot; in 1925. The prologue explains why she chose the title: &quot;Hypatia was a university lecturer denounced by Church dignitaries and torn to pieces by Christians. Such will probably be the fate of this book.&quot; Hypatia&#x27;s death became symbolic for some historians. For example, Kathleen Wider proposes that the murder of Hypatia marked the end of Classical antiquity, and Stephen Greenblatt writes that her murder &quot;effectively marked the downfall of Alexandrian intellectual life&quot;. On the other hand, Christian Wildberg notes that Hellenistic philosophy continued to flourish in the 5th and 6th centuries, and perhaps until the age of Justinian I.

Falsehoods and misconceptions about Hypatia continued to proliferate throughout the late twentieth century. Though Hubbard&#x27;s fictional biography may have been intended for children, Lynn M. Osen relied on it as her main source in her influential 1974 article on Hypatia in her 1974 book &quot;Women in Mathematics&quot;. Fordham University used Hubbard&#x27;s biography as the main source of information about Hypatia in a medieval history course. Carl Sagan&#x27;s 1980 PBS series &quot;&quot; relates a heavily fictionalized retelling of Hypatia&#x27;s death, which results in the &quot;Great Library of Alexandria&quot; being burned by militant Christians. In actuality, though Christians led by Theophilus did destroy the Serapeum in 391 AD, the Library of Alexandria had already ceased to exist in any recognizable form centuries prior to Hypatia&#x27;s birth. As a female intellectual, Hypatia became a role model for modern intelligent women and two feminist journals were named after her: the Greek journal &quot;Hypatia: Feminist Studies&quot; was launched in Athens in 1984, and &quot;Hypatia: A Journal of Feminist Philosophy&quot; in the United States in 1986. In the United Kingdom, the Hypatia Trust maintains a library and archive of feminine literary, artistic and scientific work; and, sponsors the Hypatia-in-the-Woods women&#x27;s retreat in Washington, United States.

Judy Chicago&#x27;s large-scale art piece &quot;The Dinner Party&quot; awards Hypatia a table setting. The table runner depicts Hellenistic goddesses weeping over her death. Chicago states that the social unrest leading to Hypatia&#x27;s murder resulted from Roman patriarchy and mistreatment of women and that this ongoing unrest can only be brought to an end through the restoration of an original, primeval matriarchy. She (anachronistically and incorrectly) concludes that Hypatia&#x27;s writings were burned in the Library of Alexandria when it was destroyed. Major works of twentieth century literature contain references to Hypatia, including Marcel Proust&#x27;s volume &quot;Within a Budding Grove&quot; from &quot;In Search of Lost Time&quot;, and Iain Pears&#x27;s &quot;The Dream of Scipio&quot;.

===Twenty-first century===
Hypatia has continued to be a popular subject in both fiction and nonfiction by authors in many countries and languages. In 2015, the planet designated Iota Draconis b was named after Hypatia.

In Umberto Eco&#x27;s 2002 novel &quot;Baudolino&quot;, the hero&#x27;s love interest is a half-satyr, half-woman descendant of a female-only community of Hypatia&#x27;s disciples, collectively known as &quot;hypatias&quot;. Charlotte Kramer&#x27;s 2006 novel &quot;Holy Murder: the Death of Hypatia of Alexandria&quot; portrays Cyril as an archetypal villain, while Hypatia is described as brilliant, beloved, and more knowledgeable of scripture than Cyril. Ki Longfellow&#x27;s novel &quot;Flow Down Like Silver&quot; (2009) invents an elaborate backstory for why Hypatia first started teaching. Youssef Ziedan&#x27;s novel &quot;Azazeel&quot; (2012) describes Hypatia&#x27;s murder through the eyes of a witness. Bruce MacLennan&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;The Wisdom of Hypatia&quot; presents Hypatia as a guide who introduces Neoplatonic philosophy and exercises for modern life. In &quot;The Plot to Save Socrates&quot; (2006) by Paul Levinson and its sequels, Hypatia is a time-traveler from the twenty-first century United States. In the TV series &quot;The Good Place&quot;, Hypatia is played by Lisa Kudrow as one of the few ancient philosophers eligible for heaven, by not having defended slavery.

The 2009 film &quot;Agora&quot;, directed by Alejandro Amenábar and starring Rachel Weisz as Hypatia, is a heavily fictionalized dramatization of Hypatia&#x27;s final years. The film, which was intended to criticize contemporary Christian fundamentalism, has had wide-ranging impact on the popular conception of Hypatia. It emphasizes Hypatia&#x27;s astronomical and mechanical studies rather than her philosophy, portraying her as &quot;less Plato than Copernicus&quot;, and emphasizes the restrictions imposed on women by the early Christian church, including depictions of Hypatia being sexually assaulted by one of her father&#x27;s Christian slaves, and of Cyril reading from forbidding women from teaching. The film contains numerous historical inaccuracies: It inflates Hypatia&#x27;s achievements and incorrectly portrays her as finding a proof of Aristarchus of Samos&#x27;s heliocentric model of the universe, which there is no evidence that Hypatia ever studied. It also contains a scene based on Carl Sagan&#x27;s &quot;&quot; in which Christians raid the Serapeum and burn all of its scrolls, leaving the building itself largely intact. In reality, the Serapeum probably did not have any scrolls in it at that time, and the building was demolished in 391 AD. The film also implies that Hypatia is an atheist, directly contradictory to the surviving sources, which all portray her as following the teachings of Plotinus that the goal of philosophy was &quot;a mystical union with the divine.&quot;

<doc id="38376" wikidata="Q7309189" url="?curid=38376" title="Regional accents of English">
<text>Spoken English shows great variation across regions where it is the predominant language. The United Kingdom has a wide variety of accents, and no single &quot;British accent&quot; exists. This article provides an overview of the numerous identifiable variations in pronunciation of English. Such distinctions usually derive from the phonetic inventory of local dialects, as well as from broader differences in the Standard English of different primary-speaking populations.

Accent is the part of dialect concerning local pronunciation. Vocabulary and grammar are described elsewhere; see the list of dialects of the English language. Secondary English speakers tend to carry over the intonation and phonetics of their mother tongue in English speech. For more details on this, see non-native pronunciations of English.

Primary English speakers show great variability in terms of regional accents. Examples such as Pennsylvania Dutch English are easily identified by key characteristics, but others are more obscure or easily confused. Broad regions can possess subforms. For instance, towns located less than from the city of Manchester, such as Bolton, Oldham, Rochdale, and Salford each have distinct accents, all of which are grouped together under the broader Lancashire accent. These sub-dialects are very similar to each other, but non-local listeners can identify firm differences. On the other side of the spectrum, Australia has a General Australian accent which remains almost unchanged over thousands of miles.

English accents can differ enough to create room for misunderstandings. For example, the pronunciation of &quot;pearl&quot; in some variants of Scottish English can sound like the entirely unrelated word &quot;petal&quot; to an American. For a summary of the differences between accents, see Sound correspondences between English accents.

==Overview==
English dialects differ greatly in their pronunciation of open vowels. In Received Pronunciation, there are four open back vowels, , but in General American there are only three, , and in most dialects of Canadian English only two, . Which words have which vowel varies between dialects. Words like &quot;bath&quot; and &quot;cloth&quot; have the vowels in Received Pronunciation, but in General American. The table above shows some of these dialectal differences.

==Britain and Ireland==
Accents and dialects vary widely across Great Britain, Ireland and nearby smaller islands. The UK has the most local accents of any English-speaking country. As such, a single &quot;British accent&quot; does not exist. Someone could be said to have an English, Scottish, Welsh, or Irish accent, although these all have many different subtypes.

===England===

====Southern England====

There are considerable variations within the accents of English across England, one of the most obvious being the trap–bath split of the southern half of the country.

Two main sets of accents are spoken in the West Country, namely Cornish and West Country, spoken primarily in the counties of Devon, Somerset, Gloucestershire, Bristol, Dorset (not as common in Dorset), and Wiltshire (again, less common in eastern Wiltshire). A range of variations can be heard within different parts of the West Country: The Bristolian dialect is distinctive from the accent heard in Gloucestershire (especially south of Cheltenham), for example.

The Cornish accent has an east–west variation, with the east of the county having influences from West Country English and the west of the county having direct influences from the Cornish language.

There is great variation within Greater London, with various accents such as Cockney, Estuary English, Multicultural London English, and Received Pronunciation being found all throughout the region and the Home Counties.

Other accents are those of
* the East Midlands (Derby, Leicester and Rutland, Lincoln, Northampton, and Nottingham)
* East Anglia (Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire) 
* the Home Counties (typically Buckinghamshire, Essex, Hertfordshire, Berkshire, Surrey, Sussex, Kent, and Hampshire). The Essex accent has an east–west variation, with the county&#x27;s west having Estuary English speech features and the county&#x27;s east having the traditional Essaxon/East Anglian features.
* A range of accents are spoken in the West Midlands (in the major towns and conurbations (The Black Country, Birmingham, Coventry, Stoke-on-Trent (considered by many to have tones of scouse), and Wolverhampton) and in rural areas (such as in Herefordshire and south Worcestershire).

In February 2019, the &quot;New York Times&quot; published a quiz that maps the geographical differences between British and Irish dialects.

====Northern England====
The accents of Northern England have a range of regional variations.

Cumbria has regional variants in Western Cumbria (Workington), Southern Cumbria (Barrow-in-Furness), and Carlisle.

Modern Northumbrian has local variants in Northern Northumberland (Berwick-upon-Tweed), Eastern Northumberland (Ashington) and Newcastle, Sunderland, and mid- and southern County Durham. A specialist dialect called Pitmatic is within this group, found across the region. It includes terms specific to coal mining.

Yorkshire is distinctive, having regional variants around Leeds, Bradford, Hull, Middlesbrough, Sheffield, and York. Although many Yorkshire accents sound similar, accents in areas around Hull and Middlesbrough are markedly different. Due to this, the Middlesbrough accent is sometimes grouped, with modern Northumbrian accents being a midway between the two regions.

The Hull accent&#x27;s rhythm is more like that of northern Lincolnshire than that of the rural East Riding, perhaps due to migration from Lincolnshire to the city during its industrial growth. One feature that it shares with the surrounding rural area is that an /aɪ/ sound in the middle of a word often becomes an /ɑː/, for example, &quot;five&quot; may sound like &quot;fahve&quot;, and &quot;time&quot; like &quot;tahme&quot;.

Historic Lancashire, with regional variants in Bolton, Burnley, Blackburn, Manchester, Preston, Blackpool, Liverpool, and Wigan. Many of the Lancashire accents may sound similar to outsiders, with the exception of Manchester and Wigan, where an older dialect has been maintained.

The Liverpool accent, known as Scouse, is an exception to the Lancashire regional variant of English. It has spread to some of the surrounding towns. Before the 1840s, Liverpool&#x27;s accent was similar to others in Lancashire, though with some distinct features due to the city&#x27;s proximity to Wales. The city&#x27;s population of around 60,000 was swelled in the 1840s by the arrival of around 300,000 Irish refugees escaping the Great Famine, as Liverpool was England&#x27;s main Atlantic port and a popular departure point for people leaving for a new life in the United States. While many of the Irish refugees moved away, a vast number remained in Liverpool and permanently influenced the local accent.

===Scotland===
The regional accents of Scottish English generally draw on the phoneme inventory of the dialects of Modern Scots, a language spoken by around 30% of the Scottish population with characteristic vowel realisations due to the Scottish vowel length rule.
Highland English accents are more strongly influenced by Scottish Gaelic than other forms of Scottish English.

===Wales===
The accents of English in Wales are strongly influenced by the phonology of the Welsh language, which more than 20% of the population of Wales speak as their first or second language. The North Wales accent is distinct from South Wales. North East Wales is influenced by Scouse and Cheshire accents. South East Wales accents are influenced by West Country accents. The Wenglish of the South Wales Valleys shows a deep cross-fertilisation between the two.

The Cardiff dialect and accent is quite distinctive from that of the South Wales Valleys, primarily:
*Rounding of the second element of to 
**&quot;here&quot; pronounced or in broader accents
*A closer pronunciation of as in &quot;love&quot; and &quot;other&quot;
* is widely realised as , giving a pronunciation of &quot;Cardiff&quot; as 

===Isle of Man===
Manx English has its own distinctive accent, influenced to some extent by the Lancashire dialect and to a lesser extent by some variant of Irish English.

===Ireland===

Ireland has several main groups of accents, including (1) the accents of Ulster, with a strong influence from Scotland as well as the underlying Gaelic linguistic stratum, which in that province approaches the Gaelic of Scotland, (2) those of Dublin and surrounding areas on the east coast where English has been spoken since the earliest period of colonisation from Britain, and (3) the various accents of west, midlands, and south.

====Ulster====

The Ulster accent has two main sub accents, namely Mid Ulster English and Ulster Scots. The language is spoken throughout the nine counties of Ulster and in some northern areas of bordering counties such as Louth and Leitrim. It bears many similarities to Scottish English through influence from the Ulster varieties of Scots.
Some characteristics of the Ulster accent include:

* As in Scotland, the vowels and are merged, so that &quot;look&quot; and &quot;Luke&quot; are homophonous. The vowel is a high central rounded vowel, .
* The diphthong is pronounced approximately , but wide variation exists, especially between social classes in Belfast.
* In Belfast, is a monophthong in open syllables (e.g. &quot;day&quot; ) but an ingliding diphthong in closed syllables (e.g. &quot;daze&quot; ). But the monophthong remains when inflectional endings are added, thus &quot;daze&quot; contrasts with &quot;days&quot; .
* The alveolar stops become dental before , e.g. &quot;tree&quot; and &quot;spider&quot;.
* often undergoes flapping to before an unstressed syllable, e.g. &quot;eighty&quot; 

====Connacht, Leinster, and Munster====

The accent of these three provinces fluctuates greatly from the flat tone of the midlands counties of Laois, Kildare, and Offaly to the perceived sing-song of Cork and Kerry to the soft accents of Mayo and Galway.

Historically, the Dublin City and county area, parts of Wicklow and Louth, came under heavy exclusive influence from the first English settlements, known as &quot;The Pale&quot;. It remained until Independence from Britain as the biggest concentration of English influence on the whole island.

Some Cork accents have a unique lyrical intonation. Every sentence typically ends in the trademark elongated tail-off on the last word. In Cork, heavier emphasis yet is put on the &quot;brrr&quot; sound to the letter &quot;R.&quot; This is usually the dialect in northern parts of Cork City.

Similar to the Cork accent but without the same intonation, Kerry puts even heavier emphasis on the &quot;brrr&quot; sound to the letter &quot;R.&quot;, for example, the word &quot;forty&quot;. Throughout the south, this word is pronounced whereby the &quot;r&quot; exhibits the typified Irish &quot;brrr&quot;. In Kerry, especially in rural areas, the roll on the &quot;r&quot; is enforced with vibrations from the tongue, not unlike Scottish here. 

&quot;Are you?&quot; becomes a cojoined &quot;A-rrou?&quot; single tongue flutter, especially in rural areas. This extra emphasis on &quot;R&quot; is also seen in varying measures through parts of West Limerick and West Cork in closer proximity to Kerry.

Another feature in the Kerry accent is the &quot;S&quot; before the consonant. True to its Gaelic origins in a manner similar to parts of Connacht, &quot;s&quot; maintains the &quot;shh&quot; sound as in &quot;shop&quot; or &quot;sheep&quot;. The word &quot;start&quot; becomes &quot;shtart&quot;, and &quot;stop&quot; becomes &quot;shtop&quot;.

====Irish Travellers====
Irish Travellers have a very distinct accent closely related to a rural Hiberno-English, particularly the English of south-eastern Ireland. Many Irish Travellers who were born in parts of Dublin or Britain have the accent in spite of it being strikingly different from the local accents in those regions. They have their own language, Shelta, which strongly links in with their dialect/accent of English.

==North America==

&quot;North American English&quot; is a collective term for the dialects of the United States and Canada. It does not include the varieties of Caribbean English spoken in the West Indies.

* Rhoticity: Most North American English accents differ from Received Pronunciation and some other British dialects by being rhotic. The rhotic consonant is pronounced before consonants and at the end of syllables, and the r-colored vowel is used as a syllable nucleus. For example, while the words &quot;hard&quot; and &quot;singer&quot; would be pronounced and in Received Pronunciation, they would be pronounced and in General American. Exceptions are certain traditional accents found in eastern New England, New York City, and the Southern United States, plus African-American English.
* Mergers before : &quot;R&quot;-coloring has led to some vowel mergers before historic that do not happen in most other native dialects. In many North American accents, &quot;Mary&quot;, &quot;merry&quot;, and &quot;marry&quot; sound the same (&quot;Mary&quot;–&quot;marry&quot;–&quot;merry&quot; merger), but they have the vowels , , , respectively, in RP. Similarly, &quot;nearer&quot; rhymes with &quot;mirror&quot; (&quot;mirror&quot;–&quot;nearer&quot; merger), though the two have different vowels in RP: and . Other mergers before occur in various North American dialects.
* Mergers of the low back vowels: Other North American mergers that are absent in Received Pronunciation are the merger of the vowels of &quot;caught&quot; and &quot;cot&quot; ( and in RP) in many accents, and the merger of &quot;father&quot; (RP ) and &quot;bother&quot; (RP ) in almost all.
* Flat &quot;a&quot;: Most North American accents lack the so-called trap–bath split found in Southern England: Words like &quot;ask&quot;, &quot;answer&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;, &quot;bath&quot;, &quot;staff&quot;, and &quot;dance&quot; are pronounced with the short-a of &quot;trap&quot;, not with the broad &quot;A&quot; of &quot;father&quot; heard in Southern England as well as in most of the Southern Hemisphere. In North America, the vowel of &quot;father&quot; has merged with that of &quot;lot&quot; and &quot;bother&quot; (see above). Related to the trap–bath split, North American dialects have a feature known as /æ/ tensing. This results in /æ/ in some environments, particularly nasals to be raised and even diphthongized, typically transcribed as . Thus, &quot;answer&quot; is typically pronounced as rather than .
* Flapping of and: In North American English, and both become the alveolar flap after a stressed syllable and between vowels or syllabic consonants, making the words &quot;latter&quot; and &quot;ladder&quot; homophones, either as or .

The United States does not have a concrete &quot;standard&quot; accent in the same way that Britain has Received Pronunciation. A form of speech known to linguists as General American is perceived by many Americans to be &quot;accent-less&quot;, meaning a person who speaks in such a manner does not appear to be &quot;from&quot; anywhere in particular. The region of the United States that most resembles this is the central Midwest, specifically eastern Nebraska, including Omaha and Lincoln; southern and central Iowa, including Des Moines; and parts of Missouri, Indiana, Ohio, and western Illinois, including Peoria and the Quad Cities but not the Chicago area.

===Canada===

Three major dialect areas can be found in Canada: Western/Central Canada, the Maritimes, and Newfoundland.

The phonology of West/Central Canadian English, also called &quot;General Canadian&quot;, is broadly similar to that of the Western US, except for the following features:
* The diphthongs and are raised to approximately and before voiceless consonants. For example, the vowel sound of &quot;out&quot; is different from that of &quot;loud&quot; . This feature is known as Canadian raising. The is even more raised in Atlantic Canada, closer to .
* The short &quot;a&quot; of &quot;bat&quot; is more open than almost everywhere else in North America . The other front lax vowels and , too, can be lowered and/or retracted. This phenomenon has been labelled the Canadian Shift.
The pronunciation of certain words shows a British influence. For instance, &quot;shone&quot; is , &quot;been&quot; is often , &quot;lieutenant&quot; is , &quot;process&quot; can be , etc.

Words like &quot;drama&quot;, &quot;pajamas&quot;/&quot;pyjamas&quot;, and &quot;pasta&quot; tend to have rather than ~. Words like &quot;sorrow&quot;, &quot;Florida&quot;, and &quot;orange&quot; have rather than ; therefore, &quot;sorry&quot; rhymes with &quot;story&quot; rather than with &quot;starry&quot;.

==Oceania==

===Australia===
Australian English is relatively homogeneous when compared to British and American English. There is some regional variation between the states, particularly in regard to South Australia, Victoria, Queensland, Northern Territory and Western Australia.

Three main varieties of Australian English are spoken according to linguists: &quot;Broad Australian&quot;, &quot;General Australian&quot; and &quot;Cultivated Australian&quot;. They are part of a continuum, reflecting variations in accent. They can, but do not always, reflect the social class, education, and urban or rural background of the speaker.

* Australian Aboriginal English refers to the various varieties of the English language used by Indigenous Australians. These varieties, which developed differently in different parts of Australia, vary along a continuum, from forms close to General Australian to more nonstandard forms. There are distinctive features of accent, grammar, words, and meanings, as well as language use.
* The furthest extent of the Aboriginal dialect is Australian Kriol language, which is not mutually intelligible with General Australian English.
* On the Torres Strait Islands, a distinctive dialect known as Torres Strait English is spoken.
* In Australian English, pronunciations vary regionally according to the type of vowel that occurs before the sounds , , , , and . In words like &quot;chance&quot;, &quot;plant&quot;, &quot;branch&quot;, &quot;sample&quot;, and &quot;demand&quot;, the vast majority of Australians use the short /æ/ vowel from the word &quot;cat&quot;. In South Australian English, there is a high proportion of people who use the broad /aː/ vowel from the word &quot;cart&quot; in these words.
* Centring diphthongs, which are the vowels that occur in words like &quot;ear&quot;, &quot;beard&quot;, &quot;air&quot;, and &quot;sheer&quot;. In Western Australian English, there is a tendency for centring diphthongs to be pronounced as full diphthongs. Those in the eastern states will tend to pronounce &quot;fear&quot; and &quot;sheer&quot; without any jaw movement, while the westerners would pronounce them like &quot;fia&quot; and &quot;shia&quot;, respectively, which slightly resembles South African English but in a dialect different from New Zealand English.

===New Zealand===

The New Zealand accent is most similar to Australian accents, particularly those of Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales, and South Australia, but is distinguished from these accents by the presence of three &quot;clipped&quot; vowels, slightly resembling South African English. Phonetically, these are centralised or raised versions of the short &quot;i&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, and &quot;a&quot; vowels, which in New Zealand are close to , , and , respectively, rather than , , and . New Zealand pronunciations are often popularly represented outside New Zealand by writing &quot;fish and chips&quot; as &quot;fush and chups&quot;, &quot;yes&quot; as &quot;yiss&quot;, and &quot;sixty-six&quot; as &quot;suxty-sux&quot;. 

Scottish English influence is most evident in the southern regions of New Zealand, notably in Dunedin. Another difference between New Zealand and Australian English is the length of the vowel in words such as &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;job&quot;, which are longer than in Australian English, which shares the short and staccato pronunciation shared with British English. There is a tendency in New Zealand English, found in some but not all Australian English, to add a schwa between some grouped consonants in words, such that — for example — &quot;shown&quot; and &quot;thrown&quot; may be pronounced &quot;showun&quot; and &quot;throwun&quot;.

Geographical variations appear slight and are mainly confined to individual special local words. One group of speakers holds a recognised place as &quot;talking differently&quot;: The regions of Otago and especially Southland, both in the south of the South Island, harbour a &quot;Celtic fringe&quot; of people speaking with what is known as the &quot;Southland burr&quot; in which &quot;R&quot; is pronounced with a soft burr, particularly in words that rhyme with &quot;nurse&quot;. The area formed a traditional repository of immigration from Scotland. 

Some sections of the main urban areas of Auckland and Wellington show a stronger influence of Māori and Pacific island (e.g., Samoan) pronunciations and speech patterns than most of the country. 

The trilled &quot;r&quot; is used by some Māori, who may pronounce &quot;t&quot; and &quot;k&quot; sounds without aspiration, striking other English speakers as similar to &quot;d&quot; and &quot;g&quot;. This is also encountered in South African English, especially among Afrikaans speakers.

===Norfolk Island and Pitcairn===
The English spoken in the isolated Pacific islands of Norfolk and Pitcairn shows evidence of the islands&#x27; long isolation from the world. In the case of Pitcairn, the local creole, Pitkern, shows strong evidence of its rural English 19th-century origins, with an accent that has traces of both the English southwest and Geordie. The Norfolk Island equivalent, Norfuk, was greatly influenced in its development by Pitkern. 

The accents heard in the islands when English is used are similarly influenced but in a much milder way. In the case of Norfolk Island, Australian English is the primary influence, producing an accent that is like a softened version of an Australian accent. The Pitcairn accent is for the most part largely indistinguishable from the New Zealand accent.

==Africa and the Atlantic==
===South Atlantic===
====Falkland Islands====
The Falkland Islands have a large non-native-born population, mainly from Britain but also from Saint Helena. In rural areas, the Falkland accent tends to be stronger. The accent has resemblances to both Australia-NZ English and that of Norfolk in England and contains a number of Spanish loanwords.

====Saint Helena====
&quot;Saints&quot;, as Saint Helenan islanders are called, have a variety of different influences on their accent. To outsiders, the accent has resemblances to the accents of South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.

&quot;Saint&quot; is not just a different pronunciation of English; it also has its own distinct words. So &quot;bite&quot; means &quot;spicy, as in full of chillies&quot;; &quot;us&quot; is used instead of &quot;we&quot; (&quot;us has been shopping&quot;); and &quot;done&quot; is used to generate a past tense, hence &quot;I done gorn fishing&quot; (&quot;I have been fishing&quot;).

Television is a reasonably recent arrival there and is only just beginning to have an effect. American terms are becoming more common, e.g. &quot;chips&quot; for crisps.

===Southern Africa===

====South Africa====
South Africa has 11 official languages, one of which is English. Accents vary significantly between ethnic and language groups. Home-language English speakers, Black, White, Indian, and Coloured, in South Africa have an accent that generally resembles British Received Pronunciation, modified with varying degrees of Germanic inflection due to Afrikaans.

The Coloured community is generally bilingual. English accents are strongly influenced by one&#x27;s primary mother tongue, Afrikaans, or English. A range of accents can be seen, with the majority of Coloureds showing a strong Afrikaans inflection. Similarly, Afrikaners and Cape Coloureds, both descendants of mainly Dutch settlers, tend to pronounce English phonemes with a strong Afrikaans inflection. The English accents of both related groups are significantly different and easily distinguishable, primarily because of prevalent code-switching among the majority of Coloured English speakers, particularly in the Western Cape of South Africa. The range of accents found among English-speaking Coloureds, from the distinctive &quot;Cape Flats or Coloured English&quot; to the standard &quot;colloquial&quot; South African English accent, are of special interest. Geography and education levels play major roles therein.

Black Africans generally speak English as a second language. One&#x27;s accent is strongly influenced by one&#x27;s mother tongue, particularly Bantu languages. Urban middle-class Black Africans have developed an English accent, with similar inflection as first-language English speakers. Within this ethnic group, variations exist: Most Nguni (Xhosa, Zulu, Swazi, and Ndebele) speakers have a distinct accent, with the pronunciation of words like &quot;the&quot; and &quot;that&quot; as would &quot;devil&quot; and &quot;dust&quot;, respectively, and words like &quot;rice&quot; as &quot;lice&quot;. 

This may be a result of the inadequacy of &quot;r&quot; in the languages. Sotho (Tswana, Northern Sotho, and Southern Sotho) speakers have a similar accent, with slight variations. Tsonga and Venda speakers have very similar accents with far less intonation than Ngunis and Sothos. Some Black speakers have no distinction between the &quot;i&quot; in &quot;determine&quot; and the one in &quot;decline&quot;, pronouncing it similarly to the one in &quot;mine&quot;.

Black, Indian, and Coloured students educated in former Model C schools or at formerly White tertiary institutions will generally adopt a similar accent to their White English-home-language speaking classmates. Code-switching and the &quot;Cape Flats&quot; accent are becoming popular among White learners in public schools within Cape Town.

South African accents vary between major cities, particularly Cape Town, Durban, and Johannesburg, and provinces (regions). Accent variation is observed within respective citiesfor instance, Johannesburg, where the northern suburbs (Parkview, Parkwood, Parktown North, Saxonwold, etc.) tend to be less strongly influenced by Afrikaans. These suburbs are more affluent and populated by individuals with tertiary education and higher incomes. 

The accents of native English speakers from the southern suburbs (Rosettenville, Turffontein, etc.) tend to be more strongly influenced by Afrikaans. These suburbs are populated by tradesmen and factory workers, with lower incomes. The extent of Afrikaans influence is explained by the fact that Afrikaans urbanisation would historically have been from failed marginal farms or failing economies in rural towns, into the southern and western suburbs of Johannesburg. 

The western suburbs of Johannesburg (Newlands, Triomf, which has now reverted to its old name Sophiatown, Westdene, etc.) are predominantly Afrikaans-speaking. In a similar fashion, people from predominantly or traditionally Jewish areas in the Johannesburg area (such as Sandton, Linksfield, and Victory Park) may have accents influenced by Yiddish or Hebrew ancestry.

South African English accents, across the spectrum, are non-rhotic.

*Native English: Female (Cape Town)

Additional samples of South African accents and dialects can be found at http://web.ku.edu/~idea/africa/southafrica/southafrica.htm .

Regardless of regional and ethnic differences (in accents), South African English accents are sometimes confused with Australian (or New Zealand) English by British and American English speakers.

====Zimbabwe====
In Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia, native English speakers, mainly the White and Coloured minority, have a similar speech pattern to that of South Africa. Those with high degrees of Germanic inflection pronounce &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; as &quot;zim-bah-bwi&quot;, as opposed to the African pronunciation &quot;zeem-bah-bweh&quot;. 

Zimbabwean accents vastly vary, with some Black Africans sounding British while others will have a much stronger accent influenced by their mother tongues. Usually, this distinction is brought about by where speakers grew up and the school attended. For example, most people who grew up in and around Harare have a British-sounding accent, while those in the rural areas have a more &quot;pidgin-english&quot; sort of accent.

====Namibia====
Namibian English tends to be strongly influenced by South African English. Most Namibians who grew up in and around the capital city, Windhoek, have developed an English accent. Those in rural areas have an accent strongly influenced by their mother tongue, particularly Bantu languages.

====Nigeria====
Nigerian English varies by constituent units. The accents are influenced by the various mother tongues of the Nigerian constituent units.

==Asia==

===India and South Asia===
A number of distinct dialects of English are spoken in South Asia. There are many languages spoken in South Asia like Nepali, Hindi, Punjabi, Rajasthani, Sindhi, Balochi, Pashto, Assamese, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Gujarati, Kannada, Kashmiri, Marathi, Odia, Maithili, Malayalam, Sinhala, Tamil, Telugu, Tulu, Urdu and many more, creating a variety of accents of English. Accents originating in this part of the world tend to display several distinctive features, including:
* syllable-timing, in which a roughly equal time is allocated to each syllable, akin to the English of Singapore and Malaysia. Elsewhere, English speech timing is based predominantly on stress.
* &quot;sing-song&quot; pitch, somewhat reminiscent of those of Welsh English
* retroflexion of &quot;t&quot; and &quot;d&quot;

===Philippines===
Philippine English employs a rhotic accent that originated from the time it was first introduced by Americans during the colonization period in an attempt to replace Spanish as the dominant political language. As there are no /f/ or /v/ sounds in most native languages in the Philippines, [p] is used as an alternative to /f/ as [b] is to /v/. The words &quot;fifty&quot; and &quot;five&quot; are often pronounced as and by many Filipinos. Similarly, /θ/ is often changed to [t] and /ð/ to [d].

&quot;Three&quot; becomes /tri/ while &quot;that&quot; becomes /dat/. This feature is consistent with many other Malayo-Polynesian languages. /z/ is often devoiced to [s], whereas [ʒ] is often devoiced to [ʃ] or affricated to [dʒ], so words like &quot;zoo&quot;, &quot;measure&quot;, and &quot;beige&quot; may be pronounced [su], [ˈmɛʃoɾ], and [beɪdʒ].

Apart from the frequent inability to pronounce certain fricatives (e.g., [f], [v], [θ], [ð], [z], [ʒ]), in reality, there is no single Philippine English accent. This is because native languages influence spoken English in different ways throughout the archipelago. For instance, those from Visayas usually interchange the sounds /e/ and /i/ as well as /o/ and /u/ because the distinction between those phonemes is not very pronounced in Visayan languages.

People from the northern Philippines may pronounce /r/ as a strong trill instead of a tap, which is more commonly used in the rest of the Philippines, as the trill is a feature of the Ilocano language. Ilocano people generally pronounce the schwa sound /ə/ better than other Filipinos because they use a similar sound in their native language that is missing from many other Philippine languages.

===Hong Kong===
The accent of English spoken in Hong Kong follows mainly British, with rather strong influence from Cantonese on the pronunciations of a few consonants and vowels, sentence grammar, and structure.

===Malaysia===

Malay is the lingua franca of Malaysia, a federation of former British colonies and similar dependencies. English is a foreign language with no official status, but it is commonly learnt as a second or third language.

The Malaysian accent appears to be a melding of British, Chinese, Tamil, and Malay influences.

Many Malaysians adopt different accents and usages depending on the situation. For example, an office worker may speak with less colloquialism and with a more British accent on the job than with friends or while out shopping.

*Syllable-timing, where speech is timed according to syllable, akin to the English of the Indian Subcontinent. Elsewhere, speech is usually timed to stress.
* A quick, staccato style, with &quot;puncturing&quot; syllables and well-defined, drawn-out tones
* Non-rhoticity, like most varieties of English language in England. Hence, &quot;caught&quot; and &quot;court&quot; are homophonous as (in actuality, or ), &quot;can&#x27;t&quot; rhymes with &quot;aren&#x27;t&quot;, etc.
* The &quot;ay&quot; and &quot;ow&quot; sounds in &quot;raid&quot; and &quot;road&quot; ( and , respectively) are pronounced as monophthongs, i.e. with no &quot;glide&quot;: and .
* is pronounced as [t] and as [d]; hence, &quot;thin&quot; is and &quot;then&quot; is .
* Depending on how colloquial the situation is: many discourse particles, or words inserted at the end of sentences that indicate the role of the sentence in discourse and the mood it conveys, like &quot;lah&quot;, &quot;leh&quot;, &quot;mah&quot;, &quot;hor&quot;, etc.

===Singapore===

Singapore is effectively a multilingual nation. The Singapore government recognises four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin Chinese, and Tamil.

Students in primary and secondary schools learning English as the language of instruction also learn a second language called their &quot;Mother Tongue&quot; by the Ministry of Education, where they are taught Mandarin Chinese, Malay, or Tamil. A main point to note is while &quot;Mother Tongue&quot; generally refers to the first language (L1) overseas, in Singapore, it is used by the Ministry of Education to denote the traditional language of one&#x27;s ethnic group, which sometimes can be their second language (L2).

There are two main types of English spoken in Singapore: Standard Singapore English and Singlish. Singlish is more widely spoken than Standard English. It has a very distinctive tone and sentence structure, which are both strongly influenced by Malay and the many varieties of Chinese spoken in the city.

A 2005 census showed that around 30% of Singaporeans speak English as their main language at home.

There are many foreigners working in Singapore. 36% of the population in Singapore are foreigners, and foreigners make up 50% of the service sector. Therefore, it is very common to encounter service staff who are not fluent in English. Most of these staff speak Mandarin Chinese. Those who do not speak Mandarin Chinese tend to speak either broken English or Singlish, which they have learnt from the locals.

==Antarctica==
Phonetic change in the English spoken at a base in Antarctica has been registered. This has been referred to as the start of a new accent called Antarctic English.

<doc id="38378" wikidata="Q61073" url="?curid=38378" title="Sebastian Münster">
<text>Sebastian Münster (20 January 1488 – 26 May 1552) was a German cartographer and cosmographer. He also was a Christian Hebraist scholar who taught as a professor at the University of Basel. His well-known work, the highly accurate world map, &quot;Cosmographia&quot;, sold well and went through 24 editions. Its influence was widely spread by a production of woodcuts created of it by a variety of artists.

==Life==
He was born in Ingelheim, near Mainz, the son of Andreas Münster. His parents and other ancestors were farmers.
In 1505, he entered the Franciscan order. Four years later, he entered a monastery where he became a student of Konrad Pelikan for five years. Münster completed his studies at the University of Tübingen in 1518. His graduate adviser was Johannes Stöffler.He left the Franciscans for the Lutheran Church in order to accept an appointment at the Reformed Church-dominated University of Basel in 1529. He had long harboured an interest in Lutheranism, and during the German Peasants&#x27; War, as a monk, he had been repeatedly attacked. A professor of Hebrew, and a disciple of Elias Levita, he edited the Hebrew Bible (2 vols. fol., Basel, 1534–1535), accompanied by a Latin translation and a large number of annotations. He was the first German to produce an edition of the Hebrew Bible.

He published more than one Hebrew grammar, and was the first to prepare a &quot;Grammatica Chaldaica&quot; (Basel, 1527). His lexicographical labours included a &quot;Dictionarium Chaldaicum&quot; (1527), and a &quot;Dictionarium trilingue&quot; for Latin, Greek, and Hebrew in 1530.

He released a &quot;Mappa Europae&quot; (map of Europe) in 1536. In 1537, he published a Rabbinical translation of the Gospel of Matthew in Hebrew which he had obtained from Spanish &quot;Conversos&quot;. In 1540 he published a Latin edition of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot; with illustrations. The 1550 edition contains cities, portraits, and costumes. These editions, printed in Germany, are the most valued of this work. Other writings that followed are &quot;Horologiographia&quot; (a treatise on dialling – constructing sundials, Basel, 1531), and &quot;Organum Uranicum&quot; (a treatise on the planetary motions, 1536).His &quot;Cosmographia&quot; of 1544 was the earliest description of the world in the German language. It had numerous editions in different languages including Latin, French, Italian, English, and even Czech. The &quot;Cosmographia&quot; was one of the most successful and popular works of the 16th century. It passed through 24 editions in 100 years. This success was due to the fascinating woodcuts (some by Hans Holbein the Younger, Urs Graf, Hans Rudolph Manuel Deutsch, and David Kandel), in addition to including the first to introduce &quot;separate maps for each of the four continents known then – America, Africa, Asia and Europe.&quot; It was most important in reviving geography in 16th-century Europe. The last German edition was published in 1628, long after his death.
Münster was also known as translator of the Hebrew Bible (&quot;Hebraica Biblia&quot;). His edition was published in two volumes (1546) in Basel. The first volume contains the books from Genesis to 2 Kings, following the order of the Masoretic codices. The second volume contains The Prophets (Major and Minor), The Psalms, Job, Proverb, Daniel, Chronicles, and the Five Scrolls (The Song of Songs, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes and Esther).

His &quot;Rudimenta Mathematica&quot; was published in Basel in 1551.

He died at Basel of the plague in 1552. Münster&#x27;s tombstone describes him as the Ezra and the Strabo of the German people.

==Gallery==
Several paintings with oil on canvas, woodcuts and copper etchings depict Sebastian Münster, by Hans Holbein d. J. (Basel, ), Willem de Haen (1615), as rector of the University of Basel (by Christoph Amberger, um 1547), and on the 100-DM-bill as used from 1962 to 1991.

<text>This is a list of monarchs who ruled over East Francia, and the Kingdom of Germany (), from the division of the Frankish Empire in 843 and the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806 until the collapse of the German Empire in 1918:

==East Francia (843–962)==
===Carolingian dynasty===

===Conradine dynasty===

===Ottonian dynasty===

==Holy Roman Empire (962–1806)==
The title &quot;King of the Romans&quot;, used in the Holy Roman Empire, was, from the coronation of Henry II, considered equivalent to King of Germany. A king was chosen by the German electors and would then proceed to Rome to be crowned emperor by the pope.

===Ottonian dynasty (continued)===
===Salian dynasty===

===Supplinburger dynasty===
===Hohenstaufen dynasty===

===Interregnum===


===Changing dynasties===
=== Habsburg dynasty ===

==Modern Germany (1806–1918)==
===Confederation of the Rhine (1806–1813)===
===German Confederation (1815–1866)===
===North German Confederation (1867–1871)===
===German Empire (1871–1918)===
==Note on titles==
#The Kingdom of Germany started out as the eastern section of the Frankish kingdom, which was split by the Treaty of Verdun in 843. The rulers of the eastern area thus called themselves &quot;rex&quot; &quot;Francorum&quot; (&quot;king of the Franks&quot;), &quot;rex Francorum orientalium&quot; (&quot;king of the East Franks&quot;), and later just &quot;rex&quot;. A reference to the &quot;Germans&quot;, indicating the emergence of a German nation of some sort, did not appear until the eleventh century, when the pope referred to his enemy Henry IV as &quot;rex teutonicorum&quot;, king of the Germans, in order to brand him as a foreigner. The kings reacted by consistently using the title &quot;rex Romanorum&quot;, king of the Romans, to emphasize their universal rule even before becoming emperor. This title remained until the end of the Empire in 1806, though after 1508 emperors-elect added &quot;king in Germany&quot; to their titles. (Note: in this and related entries, the kings are called &quot;kings of Germany&quot;, for clarity&#x27;s sake)
#The Kingdom of Germany was never entirely hereditary; rather, ancestry was only one of the factors that determined the succession of kings. During the 10th to 13th centuries, the king was formally elected by the leading nobility in the realm, continuing the Frankish tradition. Gradually the election became the privilege of a group of princes called electors, and the Golden Bull of 1356 formally defined election proceedings.
#In the Middle Ages, the king did not assume the title &quot;emperor&quot; (from 982 the full title was &quot;Imperator Augustus Romanorum&quot;, Venerable Emperor of the Romans) until crowned by the pope. Moving to Italy, he was usually first crowned with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, after which he assumed the title of &quot;rex Italiae&quot;, king of Italy. After this, he would ride on to Rome and be crowned emperor by the pope.
#Maximilian I was the first king to bear the title of emperor-elect. After his march to Rome for his Imperial coronation failed in 1508, he had himself proclaimed emperor-elect with papal consent. His successor Charles V also assumed that title after his coronation in 1520 until he was crowned emperor by the pope in 1530. From Ferdinand I onwards, all emperors did not get crowned by the Pope anymore. At the same time, chosen successors of the emperors held the title of king of the Romans, if elected by the college of electors during their predecessor&#x27;s lifetime.

Emperors are listed in bold. Rival kings, anti-kings, and junior co-regents are &quot;italicized&quot;.

<text>Don Pasquale () is a Gaetano Donizetti opera buffa, or comic opera, in three acts, with an Italian libretto completed largely by Giovanni Ruffini as well as the composer. It was based on a libretto by Angelo Anelli for Stefano Pavesi&#x27;s opera &quot;Ser Marcantonio&quot; written in 1810 but, on the published libretto, the author appears as &quot;M.A.&quot;

Donizetti so dominated the preparation of the libretto that Ruffini refused to allow his name to be put on the score. This resulted in confusion over the identity of the librettist for more than half a century, but as Herbert Weinstock establishes, it was largely Ruffini&#x27;s work and, in withholding his name from it as librettist, &quot;Donizetti or [his assistant] Michele Accursi may have thought that, lacking Ruffini&#x27;s name, the authorship might as well be assigned to Accursi&#x27;s initials as to a pseudonym&quot;.

The opera was first performed on 3 January 1843 by the Théâtre-Italien at the Salle Ventadour in Paris with great success and it is generally regarded as being the high point of the 19th century &quot;opera buffa&quot; tradition as well as marking its ending.

==Composition history==

Donizetti had just returned to Paris from Vienna in the autumn of 1842 and it was there that it was suggested to him by Jules Janin, the newly appointed director of the &quot;Théâtre-Italien&quot;, that he might compose a new opera for that house. Janin prepared a formal proposal on 27 September, but while no specific subject nor title was mentioned, Janin suggested that it should be a new &quot;opera buffa&quot; tailored to the talents of some major singers including Giulia Grisi, Antonio Tamburini, and Luigi Lablache.

 At around the same time in September, the Italian émigré librettist Giovanni Ruffini, who lived in Paris, was approached by Michele Accursi (who is described as &quot;Donizetti&#x27;s Paris factotum, [an] Italian exile, and politically treacherous double agent&quot; ) with the suggestion that Ruffini offer his services to Donizetti as a librettist. This is confirmed by a letter from Ruffini to his mother of around 5 October in which the librettist tells her of Accursi&#x27;s suggestion that the composer would use a story which was written in 1810 and that he would need &quot;a working stonemason of verses to remake the old libretto, to cut, change, add, plaster, and I don&#x27;t know what.&quot; In addition, it is clear from another letter on 11 October to his mother that Ruffini is hard at work: &quot;I&#x27;ve been eating up the paper, as they say. It&#x27;s not a question of doing it well or doing it badly, but of doing it fast.&quot; By the end, Ruffini stated that so much of the refinement of the work had been done by Donizetti that he felt that &quot;my freedom of action having been paralyzed by the maestro, I don&#x27;t, so to say, recognize it as mine&quot;. Therefore, he refused to have his name associated with the libretto, which was eventually published by Casa Ricordi as by &quot;M.A.&quot;, since it was Accursi who officially ceded the rights to Ricordi so long as his name was never associated with the work.

In the tradition of opera buffa, the opera makes reference to the stock characters of the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot;. Pasquale is recognizable as the blustery Pantalone, Ernesto as the lovesick Pierrot, Malatesta as the scheming Scapino, and Norina as a wily Columbina. The false &quot;Notary&quot; echoes a long line of false officials as operatic devices.

With rehearsals in progress in December 1842, it appeared that there was general pessimism as to its success: &quot;the atmosphere during rehearsals was frigid&quot; states Weinstock and records the lack of interest from the management and the orchestra musicians. &quot;The work had been condemned, judged&quot;, he concludes. However, during the evening of the final dress rehearsal, Donizetti added a new piece which he had already written for the tenor, &quot;Com&#x27;è gentil&quot;, which was designed for the third act. As for fears for the opera&#x27;s success, the composer had none: &quot;Have no fear for me...My work will be a success&quot;, he stated.

== Performance history ==

At its on 3 January 1843 premiere in Paris, &quot;Don Pasquale&quot; was performed by four of the most celebrated singers of the day and was an immediate success. It was recognized at the time as Donizetti&#x27;s comic masterpiece and, to this day, is still considered as such. &quot;Pasquale&quot; remains one of the most popular of his 66 operas, as well as being one of the three most popular Italian comic operas, the others being Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; and Donizetti&#x27;s own &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot;.

The first performance in Italy was at La Scala in Milan on 17 April 1843 with Ottavia Malvani (Norina), Napoleone Rossi (Pasquale), Leone Corelli (Ernesto), and Achille De Bassini (Malatesta). Its first performance in Vienna was at the Kärtnertortheater (in Italian) on 14 May 1843, a production in which Donizetti participated and added the comic baritone duet &quot;Cheti, cheti, immantinente&quot; from a discarded portion of his unperformed opera &quot;L&#x27;Ange de Nisida&quot;. In England it was first presented on 29 June 1843 at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in London (in Italian).

The opera was translated into French by Gustave Vaëz and Alphonse Royer and given in Brussels on 11 August 1843, Lille on 9 November 1843, and at the Théâtre d&#x27;Orléans in New Orleans on 7 January 1845. The first Australian performance was presented in Sydney on 12 October 1854 at the Royal Victoria Theatre.

In the years since World War II, the opera has been performed frequently.

== Roles ==
== Synopsis ==

:Time: Early 19th century
:Place: Rome

=== Overture===
The music is suggestive of a comic opera; bright and lively, it starts with plenty of percussion and brass instruments. After a while, the ambience changes to suggesting a party, and concludes with a brass fanfare.

===Act 1===
&quot;Scenes 1–3: A room in the home of Don Pasquale, at 9 o&#x27;clock&quot;

Ernesto has refused the woman that his uncle Don Pasquale had found for him, and as a result is to be disinherited. Ernesto declares his devotion to the young – but poor – widow Norina. In view of Ernesto&#x27;s determination, Don Pasquale decides to marry in old age to produce his own heir, and anxiously awaits the arrival of his physician, Dr. Malatesta, who is determined to teach Don Pasquale how foolish he is being, but has been pretending to search for a suitable bride. Malatesta, confronted with Pasquale&#x27;s impatience, mutters that he is a buffoon, but proceeds to describe the attributes of the bride-to-be (&quot;Bella siccome un angelo&quot; – &quot;Beautiful like an angel&quot;). Honest, modest and sweet – when pressed, Malatesta reveals she is in fact his sister. Overcome with joy, Pasquale demands to meet her at once, and sends Malatesta to fetch her, before singing of the love that has gripped him (&quot;Ah, un foco insolito&quot; – &quot;A sudden fire&quot;).

Ernesto comes back and pleads with the Don to consult with his friend Malatesta – when he hears that Malatesta supposedly supports Pasquale, he is amazed at this apparent betrayal (&quot;Mi fa il destino mendico&quot; – &quot;Fate has made a beggar of me&quot;). Ernesto determines to elope and writes to tell Norina that all is lost.

&quot;Scenes 4–5: An apartment in the home of Norina&quot;

Norina sits alone, reading a book. She recites a passage, before laughing at the situation described and reflecting on her own temperament (&quot;So anch&#x27;io la virtù magica&quot; – &quot;I too know your magical virtues&quot;). She is in cahoots with Dr. Malatesta and impatiently waits for him to come and explain his plan at which he had only hinted. A servant delivers the letter from Ernesto, which she quickly reads and is instantly dismayed.

Malatesta arrives to explain the stratagem, but Norina cuts him off and hands him the letter, which he reads aloud: Ernesto has announced his intention to leave Rome, and Europe altogether. Malatesta reassures her, saying that he has adapted his plan: Norina shall play the part of Malatesta&#x27;s sister. Having arranged for his cousin to act as a notary, they will easily deceive the Don. Norina consents to play her part in the deception, and they discuss her strategies in a lively duet (&quot;Pronta son; purch&#x27;io non manchi&quot; – &quot;I am ready; if I do not miss&quot;).

===Act 2===

&quot;A salon in the home of Don Pasquale&quot;

Ernesto is alone: lamenting his fate, he considers his decision to leave Rome (&quot;Cercherò lontana terra&quot; – &quot;I shall seek a distant land&quot;). He leaves the room just as Pasquale enters, dressed in his outdated finery, along with his servants, to whom he gives instructions to admit Malatesta on his arrival. He parades around in his grand costume, hoping it will conceal his advancing years.

Malatesta arrives with Norina in tow, and introduces her to Pasquale as his sister, Sofronia, fresh out of the convent. Pasquale is smitten, and Norina plays the part of a dutiful, modest and submissive lady, to Pasquale&#x27;s satisfaction. Norina consents to the proposed marriage, which delights Pasquale. He wants to send for the notary to conduct the ceremony straight away – conveniently, Malatesta has brought one along, who waits in the antechamber.

Malatesta fetches the supposed notary, as servants arrange a table. Taking his seat, the &quot;notary&quot; writes out a marriage contract as dictated by Malatesta and Pasquale (&quot;Fra da una parta&quot; – &quot;Between, on one hand&quot;), where the Don bequeaths all his estate to be administered by Sofronia. The contract is quickly drawn up: Pasquale signs but, before Norina can affix her signature, Ernesto bursts in. Intending to say a final farewell, he is amazed to see Norina about to marry Pasquale. However, Malatesta persuades him not to say anything (&quot;Figliol non mi far scene&quot; – &quot;Son, don&#x27;t make a scene&quot;), and he is forced to act as the final witness much to Don Pasquale&#x27;s delight.

As soon as the contract is signed, Norina abandons her pretence of docility, and refuses Pasquale&#x27;s embrace. She announces her intention to teach &quot;him&quot; manners, and to have Ernesto as a gallant to accompany her on evening strolls. Pasquale is horrified at this transformation, while Malatesta and Ernesto can barely conceal their amusement (&quot;È rimasto là impietrato&quot; – &quot;He stands there, petrified&quot;). Summoning the household staff, Norina recites a long list of demands – more servants (young and handsome at that), carriages and horses, furniture – and instructs them to spare no expense, doubling all their wages. Pasquale is stricken at his misfortune, so Malatesta urges him to go to bed.

===Act 3===

&quot;Scenes 1–5: A room in the home of Don Pasquale&quot;

Pasquale sits in a room, surrounded by piles of newly purchased jewels, dresses and the like, as the servants bustle in and out of Norina&#x27;s apartment (&quot;I diamanti presto presto&quot; – &quot;The diamonds, quickly, quickly&quot;). Dismayed by the piles of bills and invoices, the Don summons the courage to confront his tyrannical new wife. Norina emerges, dressed to go out. He attempts to reason with her, but she pays little heed (&quot;Signorina, in tanta fretta&quot; – &quot;Madam, where are you off to in such a hurry&quot;). He suggests that if she leaves, he may not allow her to return, an idea that she meets with patronising insincerity (&quot;Via, caro sposino&quot; – &quot;There, there, dear little husband&quot;) but the discussion ends in her slapping him. As she exits, she drops a note which Pasquale picks up and reads. The note is addressed to Sofronia, arranging a meeting in the garden with its unnamed, admiring author. Pasquale calls for a servant to summon Malatesta, before leaving the room.

The servants return and, amongst themselves, at once complain at the amount of work they are being made to do, and reveal how much they are enjoying the farcical drama developing between Pasquale and his new wife (&quot;Che interminabile andirivieni!&quot; – &quot;Such endless coming and going!&quot;). At the approach of Malatesta and Ernesto, however, they exit, assured of more entertainment to come. Malatesta reminds Ernesto of the finer points of their plan, and the latter leaves. The doctor moves forward to greet Don Pasquale, who tells him of Norina&#x27;s intended assignation, and his own plan to expose her unfaithfulness before a magistrate. Malatesta persuades him to moderate his plan and Pasquale, believing him an ally, consents to his conditions, while plotting his revenge on Norina (&quot;Aspetta, aspetta, cara sposina&quot; – &quot;Wait, wait, dear little wife&quot;).

&quot;Scenes 6–7: The garden, adjoining Pasquale&#x27;s house&quot;

In the garden, as night draws in, Ernesto sings of his love for Norina, as he waits for her arrival (&quot;Com&#x27;è gentil&quot; – &quot;How lovely&quot;). At last, Norina emerges, and they express their love: (&quot;Tornami a dir che m&#x27;ami&quot; – &quot;Tell me once more that you love me&quot;). Don Pasquale and Malatesta have observed and, as they reveal themselves, Ernesto covers himself with a cloak and runs to the house. Pasquale tries to confront Norina – he has caught her &quot;in flagrante&quot; – but this only provokes a fight that leaves the Don spluttering. She refuses to leave at his demand, so Malatesta, as per his agreement with Pasquale, takes over. Pretending to negotiate with Norina/Sofronia, he tells Pasquale that the only way to make her leave will be to allow Ernesto to marry his beloved, whom &quot;Sofronia&quot; apparently despises. Pasquale consents, and calls out to the house, from which Ernesto and the servants emerge. He instructs Ernesto to send for his would-be bride, but Malatesta reveals that Norina is in fact the woman Pasquale thinks he married, while the real Sofronia remains in a convent. All are reconciled, and the moral of the story – not to marry in old age – is revealed in a playful quartet (&quot;La moral di tutto questo&quot; – &quot;The moral of all this&quot;).

<text>Lucia di Lammermoor () is a (tragic opera) in three acts by Italian composer Gaetano Donizetti. Salvadore Cammarano wrote the Italian-language libretto loosely based upon Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s 1819 historical novel &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot;.

Donizetti wrote &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; in 1835, when he was reaching the peak of his reputation as an opera composer. Gioachino Rossini had recently retired and Vincenzo Bellini had died shortly before the premiere of &quot;Lucia&quot; leaving Donizetti as &quot;the sole reigning genius of Italian opera&quot;. Not only were conditions ripe for Donizetti&#x27;s success as a composer, but there was also a widespread interest in the history and culture of Scotland. The perceived romance of its violent wars and feuds, as well as its folklore and mythology, intrigued 19th century readers and audiences. Walter Scott dramatized these elements in his novel &quot;The Bride of Lammermoor&quot;, which inspired several musical works including &quot;Lucia&quot;.

The story concerns the emotionally fragile Lucy Ashton (Lucia) who is caught in a feud between her own family and that of the Ravenswoods. The setting is the Lammermuir Hills of Scotland (Lammermoor) in the 17th century.

==Performance history==

===19th century===

The opera premiered on 26 September 1835 at the Teatro di San Carlo in Naples. However, John Black notes that &quot;the surprising feature of its subsequent performance history is that it established so slowly in the Neapolitan repertoire&quot;, noting that while there were 18 performances in the rest of 1835, there were only four in 1836, 16 in 1837, two in 1838, and continuing in this manner with only two in each of 1847 and 1848.

London saw the opera on 5 April 1838 and, for Paris, Donizetti revised the score for a French version which debuted on 6 August 1839 at the Théâtre de la Renaissance in Paris. It reached the United States with a production in New Orleans on 28 May 1841.

===20th century and beyond===

The opera was never absent from the repertory of the Metropolitan Opera for more than one season at a time from 1903 until 1972. After World War II, a number of sopranos were instrumental in giving new life to the opera, including Maria Callas (with performances from 1954 at La Scala and Berlin in 1955 under Herbert von Karajan) and Dame Joan Sutherland (with 1959 and 1960 performances at the Royal Opera House Covent Garden).

It has remained a staple of the operatic repertoire.

An aria from the opera, &quot;Il dolce suono&quot;, is mentioned in E.M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;Where Angels Fear to Tread&quot;. It is also featured in the film &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; and

==Roles==
==Instrumentation==

The instrumentation is:
*Woodwinds: piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets and 2 bassoons
*Brass: 4 horns, 2 trumpets, and 3 trombones
*Percussion: timpani, triangle, bass drum, cymbals and campana (tubular bells)
*Strings: harp, first violins, second violins, violas, violoncellos and double basses.

Additionally an off-stage wind band is used; Donizetti did not provide instrumentation. 
Also, occasionally the glass harmonica is substituted for solo flute in Lucia&#x27;s mad scene, per Donizetti&#x27;s original score.

==Synopsis==
*Time: 17th century
*Place: Scotland

===Act 1===
&quot;Scene 1: The gardens of Lammermoor Castle&quot;
Normanno, captain of the castle guard, and other retainers are searching for an intruder. He tells Enrico that he believes that the man is Edgardo of Ravenswood, and that he comes to the castle to meet Enrico&#x27;s sister, Lucia. It is confirmed that Edgardo is indeed the intruder. Enrico reaffirms his hatred for the Ravenswood family and his determination to end the relationship.

&quot;Scene 2: By a fountain at the entrance to the park, beside the castle&quot;

Lucia waits for Edgardo. In her famous aria &quot;&quot;, Lucia tells her maid Alisa that she has seen the ghost of a girl killed on the very same spot by a jealous Ravenswood ancestor. Alisa tells Lucia that the apparition is a warning and that she must give up her love for Edgardo. Edgardo enters; for political reasons, he must leave immediately for France. He hopes to make his peace with Enrico and marry Lucia. Lucia tells him this is impossible, and instead they take a sworn vow of marriage and exchange rings. Edgardo leaves.

===Act 2===
&quot;Scene 1: Lord Ashton&#x27;s apartments&quot;

Preparations have been made for the imminent wedding of Lucia to Arturo. Enrico worries about whether Lucia will really submit to the wedding. He shows his sister a forged letter seemingly proving that Edgardo has forgotten her and taken a new lover. Enrico leaves Lucia to further persuasion, this time by Raimondo, Lucia&#x27;s chaplain and tutor, that she should renounce her vow to Edgardo, for the good of the family, and marry Arturo.

&quot;Scene 2: A hall in the castle&quot;

Arturo arrives for the marriage. Lucia seems distressed, but Enrico explains that this is due to the death of her mother. Arturo signs the marriage contract, followed reluctantly by Lucia. At that point Edgardo suddenly appears in the hall, which leads to the celebrated sextet &quot;Chi mi frena in tal momento&quot;. Raimondo prevents a fight, and he shows Edgardo Lucia&#x27;s signature on the marriage contract. Edgardo curses her, demanding that they return their rings to each other. He tramples his ring on the ground, before being forced out of the castle.

===Act 3===
&quot;Scene 1: Wolfcrag&quot;

Enrico visits Edgardo to challenge him to a duel. He tells him that Lucia is already enjoying her bridal bed. Edgardo agrees to fight him. They will meet later by the graveyard of the Ravenswoods, near the Wolf&#x27;s Crag.

&quot;Scene 2: A Hall&quot;

Raimondo interrupts the marriage celebrations to tell the guests that Lucia has gone mad and killed her bridegroom Arturo. Lucia enters. In the aria &quot;&quot; she imagines being with Edgardo, soon to be happily married. Enrico enters and at first threatens Lucia but later softens when he realizes her condition. Lucia collapses. Raimondo blames Enrico for precipitating the whole tragedy.

&quot;Scene 3: The graveyard of the Ravenswood family&quot;

Edgardo is resolved to kill himself on Enrico&#x27;s sword. He learns that Lucia is dying and then Raimondo comes to tell him that she has already died. Edgardo stabs himself with a dagger, hoping to be reunited with Lucia in heaven.

===The &quot;mad scene&quot;===
The cabaletta &quot; following the more lyrical &quot; from the &quot;mad scene&quot; (Act 3, Scene 2), has historically been a vehicle for several coloratura sopranos (providing a breakthrough for Dame Joan Sutherland) and is a technically and expressively demanding piece. Donizetti wrote it in F major, but it is often transposed down a tone (two half-steps) into E-flat.

Some sopranos, including Maria Callas, have performed the scene in a &quot;&quot; (&quot;as written&quot;) fashion, adding minimal ornamentation to their interpretations. Most sopranos, however, add ornamentation to demonstrate their technical ability, as was the tradition in the bel canto period. This involves the addition and interpolation of trills, mordents, turns, runs and cadenzas. Almost all sopranos append cadenzas to the end of the &quot;mad scene&quot;, sometimes ending them on a high keynote (E-flat or F, depending on the key in which they are singing, though Mado Robin takes an even higher B-flat). Some sopranos, including Ruth Welting, Mariella Devia, Mady Mesplé, and Lily Pons have sung the &quot;mad scene&quot; in Donizetti&#x27;s original F major key, although E-flat is more commonly heard.

The original scoring of this scene was for glass harmonica and soprano. However, an adaptation for flute and the soprano soloist has been more commonly performed since, mostly for practical reasons. Glass harmonica players Sascha Reckert and Philipp Alexander Marguerre resuscitated Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s vision in 2006 at the Opera La Scala in Milan, accompanying Mariella Devia, and have since brought Donizetti&#x27;s original score back to all major opera houses, including the venue of its premiere, Teatro di San Carlo. Friedrich Heinrich Kern, who has been collaborating with Reckert and Marguerre as Ensemble Sinfonia di Vetro, started to revive the original performance practice in the United States, recently featured in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; productions at the Metropolitan Opera, Santa Fe Opera, and Opera Philadelphia.

The popular soprano and flute duet cadenza was composed in 1888 by Mathilde Marchesi for her student Nellie Melba&#x27;s performance of the role, requiring ten weeks of rehearsal for the new addition and causing a critical reevaluation and surge of new interest in the opera.

==&quot;Lucie de Lammermoor&quot; (French version)==
After &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; was produced in Paris, a French version in four acts was commissioned for the Théâtre de la Renaissance in Paris. Donizetti was living there at the time, preparing the revision of &quot;Poliuto&quot; into its French version (which became &quot;Les Martyrs&quot;). &quot;Lucie&quot; opened on 6 August 1839 and this version toured extensively throughout France. The libretto, written by Alphonse Royer and Gustave Vaëz, is not simply a translation, as Donizetti altered some of the scenes and characters. One of the more notable changes is the disappearance of Alisa, Lucia&#x27;s handmaid and confidante. This allows the French version to isolate Lucia, thus increasing the story&#x27;s emotional impact. Furthermore, Lucia loses most of Raimondo&#x27;s support; his role is dramatically diminished while Arturo&#x27;s is increased. Donizetti also added a new character, Gilbert, who is loosely based on the huntsman in the Italian version. However, Gilbert is a more developed figure who serves both Edgardo and Enrico, divulging their secrets to the other for money.

The French version is performed far less frequently than the Italian, but it was revived to great acclaim by Natalie Dessay and Roberto Alagna at the Opéra National de Lyon in 2002. It was co-produced by the Boston Lyric Opera and the Glimmerglass Opera. Sarah Coburn sang the title role as her first &quot;Lucia&quot; in this French version in 2005. In 2008 &quot;Lucie&quot; was produced by the Cincinnati Opera with Coburn again in the title role.

==Recordings==
&quot;Lucia&quot; has received over twenty commercial studio recordings, and dozens more of live performances. Among these, two of the French versions and one of the original Italian edition are translated into English. The earliest complete recording was made in 1929 with Lorenzo Molajoli conducting the La Scala Orchestra and Chorus and Mercedes Capsir in the title role. There are several recordings with Maria Callas in the title role, including two studio versions conducted by Tullio Serafin (1953 and 1959) and two live versions by Herbert von Karajan (1954 and 1955). Joan Sutherland, who was particularly noted for performances as Lucia, has also been recorded in the role several times including a 1971 Decca Records recording conducted by Richard Bonynge with Luciano Pavarotti as Edgardo. In 2002, Chandos Records released the English version with David Parry conducting and Elizabeth Futral as Lucia. Several video recordings have also been released, including one in French. Charles Mackerras returned to Donizetti&#x27;s autograph score and prepared a new edition of the score. He returned to the original key structure and the Mad Scene is quite different. He recorded this version for Sony in 1997. Another recording is Diana Damrau&#x27;s along with Joseph Calleja in the role of Edgardo and Ludovic Tézier as Enrico.

<text>Dementia is a syndrome associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, characterized by a general decline in cognitive abilities that affects a person&#x27;s ability to perform everyday activities. This typically involves problems with memory, thinking, behavior, and motor control. Aside from memory impairment and a disruption in thought patterns, the most common symptoms of dementia include emotional problems, difficulties with language, and decreased motivation. The symptoms may be described as occurring in a continuum over several stages. Dementia ultimately has a significant effect on the individual, their caregivers, and their social relationships in general. A diagnosis of dementia requires the observation of a change from a person&#x27;s usual mental functioning and a greater cognitive decline than might be caused by the normal aging process.

Several diseases and injuries to the brain, such as a stroke, can give rise to dementia. However, the most common cause is Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, a neurodegenerative disorder. The &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition&quot; (DSM-5), has re-described dementia as a mild or major neurocognitive disorder with varying degrees of severity and many causative subtypes. The International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11) also classifies dementia as a neurocognitive disorder (NCD) with many forms or subclasses. Dementia is listed as an acquired brain syndrome, marked by a decline in cognitive function, and is contrasted with neurodevelopmental disorders. It is also described as a spectrum of disorders with causative subtypes of dementia based on a known disorder, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease for Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia, Huntington&#x27;s disease for Huntington&#x27;s disease dementia, vascular disease for vascular dementia, HIV infection causing HIV dementia, frontotemporal lobar degeneration for frontotemporal dementia, Lewy body disease for dementia with Lewy bodies, and prion diseases. Subtypes of neurodegenerative dementias may also be based on the underlying pathology of misfolded proteins, such as synucleinopathies and tauopathies. The coexistence of more than one type of dementia is known as mixed dementia.

Many neurocognitive disorders may be caused by another medical condition or disorder, including brain tumours and subdural hematoma, endocrine disorders such as hypothyroidism and hypoglycemia, nutritional deficiencies including thiamine and niacin, infections, immune disorders, liver or kidney failure, metabolic disorders such as Kufs disease, some leukodystrophies, and neurological disorders such as epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Some of the neurocognitive deficits may sometimes show improvement with treatment of the causative medical condition.

Diagnosis of dementia is usually based on history of the illness and cognitive testing with imaging. Blood tests may be taken to rule out other possible causes that may be reversible, such as hypothyroidism (an underactive thyroid), and to determine the dementia subtype. One commonly used cognitive test is the mini–mental state examination. Although the greatest risk factor for developing dementia is aging, dementia is not a normal part of the aging process; many people aged 90 and above show no signs of dementia. Several risk factors for dementia, such as smoking and obesity, are preventable by lifestyle changes. Screening the general older population for the disorder is not seen to affect the outcome.

Dementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death worldwide and has 10 million new cases reported every year (approximately one every three seconds). There is no known cure for dementia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil are often used and may be beneficial in mild to moderate disorder, but the overall benefit may be minor. There are many measures that can improve the quality of life of a person with dementia and their caregivers. Cognitive and behavioral interventions may be appropriate for treating the associated symptoms of depression.
== Signs and symptoms ==
The signs and symptoms of dementia are termed as the neuropsychiatric symptoms—also known as the &quot;behavioral&quot; and &quot;psychological&quot; symptoms—of dementia. 

The behavioral symptoms can include agitation, restlessness, inappropriate behavior, sexual disinhibition, and verbal or physical aggression. These symptoms may result from impairments in cognitive inhibition. 

The psychological symptoms can include depression, hallucinations (most often visual), delusions, apathy, and anxiety. The most commonly affected areas of brain function include memory, language, attention, problem solving, and visuospatial function affecting perception and orientation. The symptoms progress at a continuous rate over several stages, and they vary across the dementia subtypes. Most types of dementia are slowly progressive with some deterioration of the brain well established before signs of the disorder become apparent. There are often other conditions present, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, and there can sometimes be as many as four of these comorbidities.

Signs of dementia include getting lost in a familiar neighborhood, using unusual words to refer to familiar objects, forgetting the name of a close family member or friend, forgetting old memories, and being unable to complete tasks independently. People with developing dementia often fall behind on bill payments; specifically mortgage and credit cards, and a crashing credit score can be an early indicator of the disease.

People with dementia are more likely to have problems with incontinence than those of a comparable age without dementia; they are three times more likely to have urinary incontinence and four times more likely to have fecal incontinence.

== Stages ==
The course of dementia is often described in four stages (pre-dementia, early, middle, and late) that show a pattern of progressive cognitive and functional impairment. 

More detailed descriptions can be arrived at by the use of numeric scales. These scales include:
* The GDS/FAST Staging System
** Global Deterioration Scale (GDS or Reisberg Scale)
** Functional Assessment Staging Tool (FAST)
** Brief Cognitive Rating Scale (BCRS)
* Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) 
Using the GDS, which more accurately identifies each stage of the disease progression, a more detailed course is described in seven stages – two of which are broken down further into five and six degrees. Stage 7(f) is the final stage.

===Pre-dementia===
Pre-dementia includes pre-clinical and prodromal stages. The latter stage includes mild cognitive impairment (MCI), delirium-onset, and psychiatric-onset presentations.

====Pre-clinical====
Sensory dysfunction is claimed for the pre-clinical stage, which may precede the first clinical signs of dementia by up to ten years. Most notably the sense of smell is lost, associated with depression and a loss of appetite leading to poor nutrition. It is suggested that this dysfunction may come about because the olfactory epithelium is exposed to the environment, and the lack of blood–brain barrier protection allows toxic elements to enter and cause damage to the chemosensory networks.

====Prodromal====
Pre-dementia states considered as prodromal are mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and &quot;mild behavioral impairment&quot; (MBI). Signs and symptoms at the prodromal stage may be subtle, and the early signs often become apparent only in hindsight. Of those diagnosed with MCI, 70% later progress to dementia. In mild cognitive impairment, changes in the person&#x27;s brain have been happening for a long time, but the symptoms are just beginning to appear. These problems, however, are not severe enough to affect daily function. If and when they do, the diagnosis becomes dementia. The person may have some memory problems and trouble finding words, but they can solve everyday problems and competently handle their life affairs. During this stage, it is ideal to ensure that advance care planning has occurred to protect the person&#x27;s wishes. Advance directives exist that are specific to sufferers of dementia; these can be particularly helpful in addressing the decisions related to feeding which come with the progression of the illness. Mild cognitive impairment has been relisted in both DSM-5 and ICD-11 as &quot;mild neurocognitive disorders&quot;, i.e. milder forms of the major neurocognitive disorder (dementia) subtypes.

Kynurenine is a metabolite of tryptophan that regulates microbiome signaling, immune cell response, and neuronal excitation. A disruption in the kynurenine pathway may be associated with the neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive prognosis in mild dementia.

=== Early ===
In the early stage of dementia, symptoms become noticeable to other people. In addition, the symptoms begin to interfere with daily activities, and will register a score on a mini–mental state examination (MMSE). MMSE scores are set at 24 to 30 for a normal cognitive rating and lower scores reflect severity of symptoms. The symptoms are dependent on the type of dementia. More complicated chores and tasks around the house or at work become more difficult. The person can usually still take care of themselves but may forget things like taking pills or doing laundry and may need prompting or reminders.

The symptoms of early dementia usually include memory difficulty, but can also include some word-finding problems, and problems with executive functions of planning and organization. Managing finances may prove difficult. Other signs might be getting lost in new places, repeating things, and personality changes.

In some types of dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and frontotemporal dementia, personality changes and difficulty with organization and planning may be the first signs.

=== Middle ===
As dementia progresses, initial symptoms generally worsen. The rate of decline is different for each person. MMSE scores between 6 and 17 signal moderate dementia. For example, people with moderate Alzheimer&#x27;s dementia lose almost all new information. People with dementia may be severely impaired in solving problems, and their social judgment is often impaired. They cannot usually function outside their own home, and generally should not be left alone. They may be able to do simple chores around the house but not much else, and begin to require assistance for personal care and hygiene beyond simple reminders. A lack of insight into having the condition will become evident.

=== Late ===
People with late-stage dementia typically turn increasingly inward and need assistance with most or all of their personal care. People with dementia in the late stages usually need 24-hour supervision to ensure their personal safety, and meeting of basic needs. If left unsupervised, they may wander or fall; may not recognize common dangers such as a hot stove; or may not realize that they need to use the bathroom and become incontinent. They may not want to get out of bed, or may need assistance doing so. Commonly, the person no longer recognizes familiar faces. They may have significant changes in sleeping habits or have trouble sleeping at all.

Changes in eating frequently occur. Cognitive awareness is needed for eating and swallowing and progressive cognitive decline results in eating and swallowing difficulties. This can cause food to be refused, or choked on, and help with feeding will often be required. For ease of feeding, food may be liquidized into a thick purée. They may also struggle to walk, particularly among those with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. In some cases, terminal lucidity, a form of paradoxical lucidity, occurs immediately before death; in this phenomenon, there is an unexpected recovery of mental clarity.

==Causes==
Many causes of dementia are neurodegenerative, and protein misfolding is a cardinal feature of these. Other common causes include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, frontotemporal dementia, and mixed dementia (commonly Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and vascular dementia). Less common causes include normal pressure hydrocephalus, Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia, syphilis, HIV, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.

=== Alzheimer&#x27;s disease ===

Alzheimer&#x27;s disease accounts for 60–70% of cases of dementia worldwide. The most common symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease are short-term memory loss and word-finding difficulties. Trouble with visuospatial functioning (getting lost often), reasoning, judgment and insight fail. Insight refers to whether or not the person realizes they have memory problems.

The part of the brain most affected by Alzheimer&#x27;s is the hippocampus. Other parts that show atrophy (shrinking) include the temporal and parietal lobes. Although this pattern of brain shrinkage suggests Alzheimer&#x27;s, it is variable and a brain scan is insufficient for a diagnosis.

Little is known about the events that occur during and that actually cause Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. This is due to the fact that, historically, brain tissue from patients with the disease could only be studied after the person&#x27;s death. Brain scans can now help diagnose and distinguish between different kinds of dementia and show severity. These include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computerized tomography (CT), and positron emission tomography (PET). However, it is known that one of the first aspects of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease is overproduction of amyloid. Extracellular senile plaques (SPs), consisting of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) that are formed by hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, are two well-established pathological hallmarks of AD. Amyloid causes inflammation around the senile plaques of the brain, and too much buildup of this inflammation leads to changes in the brain that cannot be controlled, leading to the symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s.

Several articles have been published on a possible relationship (as an either primary cause or exacerbation of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease) between general anesthesia and Alzheimer&#x27;s in specifically the elderly.

=== Vascular ===
Vascular dementia accounts for at least 20% of dementia cases, making it the second most common type. It is caused by disease or injury affecting the blood supply to the brain, typically involving a series of mini-strokes. The symptoms of this dementia depend on where in the brain the strokes occurred and whether the blood vessels affected were large or small. Repeated injury can cause progressive dementia over time, while a single injury located in an area critical for cognition such as the hippocampus, or thalamus, can lead to sudden cognitive decline. Elements of vascular dementia may be present in all other forms of dementia.

Brain scans may show evidence of multiple strokes of different sizes in various locations. People with vascular dementia tend to have risk factors for disease of the blood vessels, such as tobacco use, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, high cholesterol, diabetes, or other signs of vascular disease such as a previous heart attack or angina.

=== Lewy bodies ===
The prodromal symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) include mild cognitive impairment, and delirium onset.
The symptoms of DLB are more frequent, more severe, and earlier presenting than in the other dementia subtypes.
Dementia with Lewy bodies has the primary symptoms of fluctuating cognition, alertness or attention; REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD); one or more of the main features of parkinsonism, not due to medication or stroke; and repeated visual hallucinations. The visual hallucinations in DLB are generally vivid hallucinations of people or animals and they often occur when someone is about to fall asleep or wake up. Other prominent symptoms include problems with planning (executive function) and difficulty with visual-spatial function, and disruption in autonomic bodily functions. Abnormal sleep behaviors may begin before cognitive decline is observed and are a core feature of DLB. RBD is diagnosed either by sleep study recording or, when sleep studies cannot be performed, by medical history and validated questionnaires.

=== Parkinson&#x27;s disease ===
Parkinson&#x27;s disease is associated with Lewy body dementia that often progresses to Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia following a period of dementia-free Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

=== Frontotemporal ===
Frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) are characterized by drastic personality changes and language difficulties. In all FTDs, the person has a relatively early social withdrawal and early lack of insight. Memory problems are not a main feature. There are six main types of FTD. The first has major symptoms in personality and behavior. This is called behavioral variant FTD (bv-FTD) and is the most common. The hallmark feature of bv-FTD is impulsive behavior, and this can be detected in pre-dementia states. In bv-FTD, the person shows a change in personal hygiene, becomes rigid in their thinking, and rarely acknowledges problems; they are socially withdrawn, and often have a drastic increase in appetite. They may become socially inappropriate. For example, they may make inappropriate sexual comments, or may begin using pornography openly. One of the most common signs is apathy, or not caring about anything. Apathy, however, is a common symptom in many dementias.

Two types of FTD feature aphasia (language problems) as the main symptom. One type is called semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (SV-PPA). The main feature of this is the loss of the meaning of words. It may begin with difficulty naming things. The person eventually may lose the meaning of objects as well. For example, a drawing of a bird, dog, and an airplane in someone with FTD may all appear almost the same. In a classic test for this, a patient is shown a picture of a pyramid and below it a picture of both a palm tree and a pine tree. The person is asked to say which one goes best with the pyramid. In SV-PPA the person cannot answer that question. The other type is called non-fluent agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia (NFA-PPA). This is mainly a problem with producing speech. They have trouble finding the right words, but mostly they have a difficulty coordinating the muscles they need to speak. Eventually, someone with NFA-PPA only uses one-syllable words or may become totally mute.

A frontotemporal dementia associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) known as (FTD-ALS) includes the symptoms of FTD (behavior, language and movement problems) co-occurring with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (loss of motor neurons). Two FTD-related disorders are progressive supranuclear palsy (also classed as a Parkinson-plus syndrome), and corticobasal degeneration. These disorders are tau-associated.

=== Huntington&#x27;s disease ===
Huntington&#x27;s disease is a neurodegenerative disease caused by mutations in a single gene &quot;HTT&quot;, that encodes for huntingtin protein. Symptoms include cognitive impairment and this usually declines further into dementia.

The first main symptoms of Huntington&#x27;s disease often include:

* difficulty concentrating
* memory lapses
* depression - this can include low mood, lack of interest in things, or just abnormal feelings of hopelessness
* stumbling and clumsiness that is out of the ordinary
* mood swings, such as irritability or aggressive behavior to insignificant things

=== HIV ===
HIV-associated dementia results as a late stage from HIV infection, and mostly affects younger people. The essential features of HIV-associated dementia are disabling cognitive impairment accompanied by motor dysfunction, speech problems and behavioral change. Cognitive impairment is characterised by mental slowness, trouble with memory and poor concentration. Motor symptoms include a loss of fine motor control leading to clumsiness, poor balance and tremors. Behavioral changes may include apathy, lethargy and diminished emotional responses and spontaneity. Histopathologically, it is identified by the infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the central nervous system (CNS), gliosis, pallor of myelin sheaths, abnormalities of dendritic processes and neuronal loss.

=== Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease ===
Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease is a rapidly progressive prion disease that typically causes dementia that worsens over weeks to months. Prions are disease-causing pathogens created from abnormal proteins.

=== Alcoholism ===
Alcohol-related dementia, also called alcohol-related brain damage, occurs as a result of excessive use of alcohol particularly as a substance abuse disorder. Different factors can be involved in this development including thiamine deficiency and age vulnerability. A degree of brain damage is seen in more than 70% of those with alcohol use disorder. Brain regions affected are similar to those that are affected by aging, and also by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Regions showing loss of volume include the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes, as well as the cerebellum, thalamus, and hippocampus. This loss can be more notable, with greater cognitive impairments seen in those aged 65 years and older.

=== Mixed dementia ===
More than one type of dementia, known as mixed dementia, may exist together in about 10% of dementia cases. The most common type of mixed dementia is Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and vascular dementia. This particular type of mixed dementia&#x27;s main onsets are a mixture of old age, high blood pressure, and damage to blood vessels in the brain.

Diagnosis of mixed dementia can be difficult, as often only one type will predominate. This makes the treatment of people with mixed dementia uncommon, with many people missing out on potentially helpful treatments. Mixed dementia can mean that symptoms onset earlier, and worsen more quickly since more parts of the brain will be affected.

=== Other ===
Chronic inflammatory conditions that may affect the brain and cognition include Behçet&#x27;s disease, multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome, lupus, celiac disease, and non-celiac gluten sensitivity. These types of dementias can rapidly progress, but usually have a good response to early treatment. This consists of immunomodulators or steroid administration, or in certain cases, the elimination of the causative agent.

Celiac disease does not seem to raise the risk of dementia in general but it may increase the risk of vascular dementia. Both celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity might raise the risk of cognitive impairment which can be one of the early signs of subsequent dementia. A strict gluten-free diet started early may protect against dementia associated with gluten-related disorders.

Cases of easily reversible dementia include hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, Lyme disease, and neurosyphilis. For Lyme disease and neurosyphilis, testing should be done if risk factors are present. Because risk factors are often difficult to determine, testing for neurosyphilis and Lyme disease, as well as other mentioned factors, may be undertaken as a matter of course where dementia is suspected.

Many other medical and neurological conditions include dementia only late in the illness. For example, a proportion of patients with Parkinson&#x27;s disease develop dementia, though widely varying figures are quoted for this proportion. When dementia occurs in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, the underlying cause may be dementia with Lewy bodies or Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, or both. Cognitive impairment also occurs in the Parkinson-plus syndromes of progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration (and the same underlying pathology may cause the clinical syndromes of frontotemporal lobar degeneration). Although the acute porphyrias may cause episodes of confusion and psychiatric disturbance, dementia is a rare feature of these rare diseases. Limbic-predominant age-related TDP-43 encephalopathy (LATE) is a type of dementia that primarily affects people in their 80s or 90s and in which TDP-43 protein deposits in the limbic portion of the brain.

Hereditary disorders that can also cause dementia include: some metabolic disorders such as lysosomal storage disorders, leukodystrophies, and spinocerebellar ataxias.

Persistent loneliness may significantly increase the risk of dementia. Loneliness is associated with a 31% higher likelihood of developing any form of dementia, and can also raise the risk of cognitive impairment by 15%.

== Diagnosis ==
Symptoms are similar across dementia types and it is difficult to diagnose by symptoms alone. Diagnosis may be aided by brain scanning techniques. In many cases, the diagnosis requires a brain biopsy to become final, but this is rarely recommended (though it can be performed at autopsy). In those who are getting older, general screening for cognitive impairment using cognitive testing or early diagnosis of dementia has not been shown to improve outcomes. However, screening exams are useful in 65+ persons with memory complaints.

Normally, symptoms must be present for at least six months to support a diagnosis. Cognitive dysfunction of shorter duration is called &quot;delirium&quot;. Delirium can be easily confused with dementia due to similar symptoms. Delirium is characterized by a sudden onset, fluctuating course, a short duration (often lasting from hours to weeks), and is primarily related to a somatic (or medical) disturbance. In comparison, dementia has typically a long, slow onset (except in the cases of a stroke or trauma), slow decline of mental functioning, as well as a longer trajectory (from months to years).

Some mental illnesses, including depression and psychosis, may produce symptoms that must be differentiated from both delirium and dementia. These are differently diagnosed as pseudodementias, and any dementia evaluation needs to include a depression screening such as the Neuropsychiatric Inventory or the Geriatric Depression Scale. Physicians used to think that people with memory complaints had depression and not dementia (because they thought that those with dementia are generally unaware of their memory problems). However, researchers have realized that many older people with memory complaints in fact have mild cognitive impairment the earliest stage of dementia. Depression should always remain high on the list of possibilities, however, for an elderly person with memory trouble. Changes in thinking, hearing and vision are associated with normal ageing and can cause problems when diagnosing dementia due to the similarities. Given the challenging nature of predicting the onset of dementia and making a dementia diagnosis clinical decision making aids underpinned by machine learning and artificial intelligence have the potential to enhance clinical practice.

=== Cognitive testing ===

Various brief cognitive tests (5–15 minutes) have reasonable reliability to screen for dementia, but may be affected by factors such as age, education and ethnicity. Age and education have a significant influence on the diagnosis of dementia. For example, Individuals with lower education are more likely to be diagnosed with dementia than their educated counterparts. While many tests have been studied, presently the mini mental state examination (MMSE) is the best studied and most commonly used. The MMSE is a useful tool for helping to diagnose dementia if the results are interpreted along with an assessment of a person&#x27;s personality, their ability to perform activities of daily living, and their behaviour. Other cognitive tests include the abbreviated mental test score (AMTS), the, &quot;modified mini–mental state examination&quot; (3MS), the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI), the Trail-making test, and the clock drawing test. The MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment) is a reliable screening test and is available online for free in 35 different languages. The MoCA has also been shown somewhat better at detecting mild cognitive impairment than the MMSE. People with hearing loss, which commonly occurs alongside dementia, score worse in the MoCA test, which could lead to a false diagnosis of dementia. Researchers have developed an adapted version of the MoCA test, which is accurate and reliable and avoids the need for people to listen and respond to questions. The AD-8 – a screening questionnaire used to assess changes in function related to cognitive decline – is potentially useful, but is not diagnostic, is variable, and has risk of bias. An integrated cognitive assessment (&quot;CognICA&quot;) is a five-minute test that is highly sensitive to the early stages of dementia, and uses an application deliverable to an iPad. Previously in use in the UK, in 2021 CognICA was given FDA approval for its commercial use as a medical device.

Another approach to screening for dementia is to ask an informant (relative or other supporter) to fill out a questionnaire about the person&#x27;s everyday cognitive functioning. Informant questionnaires provide complementary information to brief cognitive tests. Probably the best known questionnaire of this sort is the &quot;Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE)&quot;. Evidence is insufficient to determine how accurate the IQCODE is for diagnosing or predicting dementia. The Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease Caregiver Questionnaire is another tool. It is about 90% accurate for Alzheimer&#x27;s when by a caregiver. The &quot;General Practitioner Assessment Of Cognition&quot; combines both a patient assessment and an informant interview. It was specifically designed for use in the primary care setting.

Clinical neuropsychologists provide diagnostic consultation following administration of a full battery of cognitive testing, often lasting several hours, to determine functional patterns of decline associated with varying types of dementia. Tests of memory, executive function, processing speed, attention and language skills are relevant, as well as tests of emotional and psychological adjustment. These tests assist with ruling out other etiologies and determining relative cognitive decline over time or from estimates of prior cognitive abilities.

=== Laboratory tests ===
Routine blood tests are usually performed to rule out treatable causes. These include tests for vitamin B12, folic acid, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), C-reactive protein, full blood count, electrolytes, calcium, renal function, and liver enzymes. Abnormalities may suggest vitamin deficiency, infection, or other problems that commonly cause confusion or disorientation in the elderly.

=== Imaging ===
A CT scan or MRI scan is commonly performed to possibly find either normal pressure hydrocephalus, a potentially reversible cause of dementia, or connected tumor. The scans can also yield information relevant to other types of dementia, such as infarction (stroke) that would point at a vascular type of dementia. These tests do not pick up diffuse metabolic changes associated with dementia in a person who shows no gross neurological problems (such as paralysis or weakness) on a neurological exam.

The functional neuroimaging modalities of SPECT and PET are more useful in assessing long-standing cognitive dysfunction, since they have shown similar ability to diagnose dementia as a clinical exam and cognitive testing. The ability of SPECT to differentiate vascular dementia from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, appears superior to differentiation by clinical exam.

The value of PiB-PET imaging using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) as a radiotracer has been established in predictive diagnosis, particularly Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

==Prevention==
===Risk factors===

Risk factors for dementia include high blood pressure, high levels of LDL cholesterol, vision loss, hearing loss, smoking, obesity, depression, inactivity, diabetes, lower levels of education and low social contact. Over-indulgence in alcohol, lack of sleep, anemia, traumatic brain injury, and air pollution can also increase the chance of developing dementia. Many of these risk factors, including the lower level of education, smoking, physical inactivity and diabetes, are modifiable. Several of the group are known as &quot;vascular risk factors&quot; that may be possible to be reduced or eliminated. Managing these risk factors can reduce the risk of dementia in individuals in their late midlife or older age. A reduction in a number of these risk factors can give a positive outcome. The decreased risk achieved by adopting a healthy lifestyle is seen even in those with a high genetic risk.

In addition to the above risk factors, other psychological features, including certain personality traits (high neuroticism, and low conscientiousness), low purpose in life, and high loneliness, are risk factors for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and related dementias. For example, based on the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), research found that loneliness in older people can increase the risk of dementia by one-third. Not having a partner (being single, divorced, or widowed) can double the risk of dementia. However, having two or three closer relationships might reduce the risk by three-fifths.

The two most modifiable risk factors for dementia are physical inactivity and lack of cognitive stimulation. Physical activity, in particular aerobic exercise, is associated with a reduction in age-related brain tissue loss, and neurotoxic factors thereby preserving brain volume and neuronal integrity. Cognitive activity strengthens neural plasticity and together they help to support cognitive reserve. The neglect of these risk factors diminishes this reserve.

Sensory impairments of vision and hearing are modifiable risk factors for dementia. These impairments may precede the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease for example, by many years. Hearing loss may lead to social isolation which negatively affects cognition. Social isolation is also identified as a modifiable risk factor. Age-related hearing loss in midlife is linked to cognitive impairment in late life, and is seen as a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and dementia. Such hearing loss may be caused by a central auditory processing disorder that makes the understanding of speech against background noise difficult. Age-related hearing loss is characterised by slowed central processing of auditory information. Worldwide, mid-life hearing loss may account for around 9% of dementia cases.

Frailty may increase the risk of cognitive decline, and dementia, and the inverse also holds of cognitive impairment increasing the risk of frailty. Prevention of frailty may help to prevent cognitive decline.

There are no medications that can prevent cognitive decline and dementia. However blood pressure lowering medications might decrease the risk of dementia or cognitive problems by around 0.5%.

Economic disadvantage has been shown to have a strong link to higher dementia prevalence, which cannot yet be fully explained by other risk factors.

===Dental health===
Limited evidence links poor oral health to cognitive decline. However, failure to perform tooth brushing and gingival inflammation can be used as dementia risk predictors.

====Oral bacteria====
The link between Alzheimer&#x27;s and gum disease is oral bacteria. In the oral cavity, bacterial species include &quot;P. gingivalis&quot;, &quot;F. nucleatum&quot;, &quot;P. intermedia&quot;, and &quot;T. forsythia&quot;. Six oral treponema spirochetes have been examined in the brains of Alzheimer&#x27;s patients. Spirochetes are neurotropic in nature, meaning they act to destroy nerve tissue and create inflammation. Inflammatory pathogens are an indicator of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and bacteria related to gum disease have been found in the brains of patients with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The bacteria invade nerve tissue in the brain, increasing the permeability of the blood–brain barrier and promoting the onset of Alzheimer&#x27;s. Individuals with a plethora of tooth plaque risk cognitive decline. Poor oral hygiene can have an adverse effect on speech and nutrition, causing general and cognitive health decline.

====Oral viruses====
Herpes simplex virus (HSV) has been found in more than 70% of those aged over 50. HSV persists in the peripheral nervous system and can be triggered by stress, illness or fatigue. High proportions of viral-associated proteins in amyloid plaques or neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) confirm the involvement of HSV-1 in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease pathology. NFTs are known as the primary marker of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. HSV-1 produces the main components of NFTs.

===Diet===
Diet is seen to be a modifiable risk factor for the development of dementia. Thiamine deficiency is identified to increase the risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in adults. The role of thiamine in brain physiology is unique and essential for the normal cognitive function of older people. Many dietary choices of the elderly population, including the higher intake of gluten-free products, compromise the intake of thiamine as these products are not fortified with thiamine.

The Mediterranean and DASH diets are both associated with less cognitive decline. A different approach has been to incorporate elements of both of these diets into one known as the MIND diet. These diets are generally low in saturated fats while providing a good source of carbohydrates, mainly those that help stabilize blood sugar and insulin levels. Raised blood sugar levels over a long time, can damage nerves and cause memory problems if they are not managed. Nutritional factors associated with the proposed diets for reducing dementia risk include unsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E, vitamin C, flavonoids, vitamin B, and vitamin D. A study conducted at the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom seems to have confirmed these findings with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats creating an optimum diet that can help reduce the risk of dementia by roughly 25%.

The MIND diet may be more protective but further studies are needed. The Mediterranean diet seems to be more protective against Alzheimer&#x27;s than DASH but there are no consistent findings against dementia in general. The role of olive oil needs further study as it may be one of the most important components in reducing the risk of cognitive decline and dementia.

In those with celiac disease or non-celiac gluten sensitivity, a strict gluten-free diet may relieve the symptoms given a mild cognitive impairment. Once dementia is advanced no evidence suggests that a gluten-free diet is useful.

Omega-3 fatty acid supplements do not appear to benefit or harm people with mild to moderate symptoms. However, there is good evidence that omega-3 incorporation into the diet is of benefit in treating depression, a common symptom, and potentially modifiable risk factor for dementia.

==Management==

There are limited options for treating dementia, with most approaches focused on managing or reducing individual symptoms. There are no treatment options available to delay the onset of dementia. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors are often used early in the disorder course; however, benefit is generally small. More than half of people with dementia may experience psychological or behavioral symptoms including agitation, sleep problems, aggression, and/or psychosis. Treatment for these symptoms is aimed at reducing the person&#x27;s distress and keeping the person safe. Treatments other than medication appear to be better for agitation and aggression. Cognitive and behavioral interventions may be appropriate. Some evidence suggests that education and support for the person with dementia, as well as caregivers and family members, improves outcomes. Palliative care interventions may lead to improvements in comfort in dying, but the evidence is low. Exercise programs are beneficial with respect to activities of daily living, and potentially improve dementia.

The effect of therapies can be evaluated for example by assessing agitation using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (CMAI); by assessing mood and engagement with the Menorah Park Engagement Scale (MPES); and the Observed Emotion Rating Scale (OERS) or by assessing indicators for depression using the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) or a simplified version thereof.

Often overlooked in treating and managing dementia is the role of the caregiver and what is known about how they can support multiple interventions. Findings from a 2021 systematic review of the literature found caregivers of people with dementia in nursing homes do not have sufficient tools or clinical guidance for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) along with medication use. Simple measures like talking to people about their interests can improve the quality of life for care home residents living with dementia. A programme showed that such simple measures reduced residents&#x27; agitation and depression. They also needed fewer GP visits and hospital admissions, which also meant that the programme was cost-saving.

===Psychological and psychosocial therapies===

Psychological therapies for dementia include some limited evidence for reminiscence therapy (namely, some positive effects in the areas of quality of life, cognition, communication and mood – the first three particularly in care home settings), some benefit for cognitive reframing for caretakers, unclear evidence for validation therapy and tentative evidence for mental exercises, such as cognitive stimulation programs for people with mild to moderate dementia. Offering personally tailored activities may help reduce challenging behavior and may improve quality of life. It is not clear if personally tailored activities have an impact on affect or improve for the quality of life for the caregiver.

Adult daycare centers as well as special care units in nursing homes often provide specialized care for dementia patients. Daycare centers offer supervision, recreation, meals, and limited health care to participants, as well as providing respite for caregivers. In addition, home care can provide one-to-one support and care in the home allowing for more individualized attention that is needed as the disorder progresses. Psychiatric nurses can make a distinctive contribution to people&#x27;s mental health.

Since dementia impairs normal communication due to changes in receptive and expressive language, as well as the ability to plan and problem solve, agitated behavior is often a form of communication for the person with dementia. Actively searching for a potential cause, such as pain, physical illness, or overstimulation can be helpful in reducing agitation. Additionally, using an &quot;ABC analysis of behavior&quot; can be a useful tool for understanding behavior in people with dementia. It involves looking at the antecedents (A), behavior (B), and consequences (C) associated with an event to help define the problem and prevent further incidents that may arise if the person&#x27;s needs are misunderstood. The strongest evidence for non-pharmacological therapies for the management of changed behaviors in dementia is for using such approaches. Low quality evidence suggests that regular (at least five sessions of) music therapy may help institutionalized residents. It may reduce depressive symptoms and improve overall behaviors. It may also supply a beneficial effect on emotional well-being and quality of life, as well as reduce anxiety. In 2003, The Alzheimer&#x27;s Society established &#x27;Singing for the Brain&#x27; (SftB) a project based on pilot studies which suggested that the activity encouraged participation and facilitated the learning of new songs. The sessions combine aspects of reminiscence therapy and music. Musical and interpersonal connectedness can underscore the value of the person and improve quality of life.

Some London hospitals found that using color, designs, pictures and lights helped people with dementia adjust to being at the hospital. These adjustments to the layout of the dementia wings at these hospitals helped patients by preventing confusion.

Life story work as part of reminiscence therapy, and video biographies have been found to address the needs of clients and their caregivers in various ways, offering the client the opportunity to leave a legacy and enhance their personhood and also benefitting youth who participate in such work. Such interventions can be more beneficial when undertaken at a relatively early stage of dementia. They may also be problematic in those who have difficulties in processing past experiences

Animal-assisted therapy has been found to be helpful. Drawbacks may be that pets are not always welcomed in a communal space in the care setting. An animal may pose a risk to residents, or may be perceived to be dangerous. Certain animals may also be regarded as &quot;unclean&quot; or &quot;dangerous&quot; by some cultural groups.

Occupational therapy also addresses psychological and psychosocial needs of patients with dementia through improving daily occupational performance and caregivers&#x27; competence. When compensatory intervention strategies are added to their daily routine, the level of performance is enhanced and reduces the burden commonly placed on their caregivers. Occupational therapists can also work with other disciplines to create a client centered intervention. To manage cognitive disability, and coping with behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, combined occupational and behavioral therapies can support patients with dementia even further.

==== Cognitive training and rehabilitation ====
There is no strong evidence to suggest that cognitive training is beneficial for people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, dementia, or mild cognitive impairment. However, a 2023 review found that cognitive rehabilitation may be effective in helping individuals with mild to moderate dementia to manage their daily activities.

==== Personally tailored activities ====
Offering personally tailored activity sessions to people with dementia in long-term care homes may slightly reduce challenging behavior.

===Medications===
No medications have been shown to prevent or cure dementia. Medications may be used to treat the behavioral and cognitive symptoms, but have no effect on the underlying disease process.
Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as donepezil, may be useful for Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia, DLB, or vascular dementia. The quality of the evidence is poor and the benefit is small. No difference has been shown between the agents in this family. In a minority of people side effects include a slow heart rate and fainting. Rivastigmine is recommended for treating symptoms in Parkinson&#x27;s disease dementia.

Medications that have anticholinergic effects increase all-cause mortality in people with dementia, although the effect of these medications on cognitive function remains uncertain, according to a systematic review published in 2021.

Before prescribing antipsychotic medication in the elderly, an assessment for an underlying cause of the behavior is needed. Severe and life-threatening reactions occur in almost half of people with DLB, and can be fatal after a single dose. People with Lewy body dementias who take neuroleptics are at risk for neuroleptic malignant syndrome, a life-threatening illness. Extreme caution is required in the use of antipsychotic medication in people with DLB because of their sensitivity to these agents. Antipsychotic drugs are used to treat dementia only if non-drug therapies have not worked, and the person&#x27;s actions threaten themselves or others. Aggressive behavior changes are sometimes the result of other solvable problems, that could make treatment with antipsychotics unnecessary. Because people with dementia can be aggressive, resistant to their treatment, and otherwise disruptive, sometimes antipsychotic drugs are considered as a therapy in response. These drugs have risky adverse effects, including increasing the person&#x27;s chance of stroke and death. Given these adverse events and small benefit antipsychotics are avoided whenever possible. Generally, stopping antipsychotics for people with dementia does not cause problems, even in those who have been on them a long time.

N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockers such as memantine may be of benefit but the evidence is less conclusive than for AChEIs. Due to their differing mechanisms of action memantine and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can be used in combination however the benefit is slight.

An extract of &quot;Ginkgo biloba&quot; known as &quot;EGb 761&quot; has been widely used for treating mild to moderate dementia and other neuropsychiatric disorders. Its use is approved throughout Europe. The World Federation of Biological Psychiatry guidelines lists EGb 761 with the same weight of evidence (level B) given to acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, and memantine. EGb 761 is the only one that showed improvement of symptoms in both AD and vascular dementia. EGb 761 is seen as being able to play an important role either on its own or as an add-on particularly when other therapies prove ineffective. EGb 761 is seen to be neuroprotective; it is a free radical scavenger, improves mitochondrial function, and modulates serotonin and dopamine levels. Many studies of its use in mild to moderate dementia have shown it to significantly improve cognitive function, activities of daily living, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life. However, its use has not been shown to prevent the progression of dementia.

While depression is frequently associated with dementia, the use of antidepressants such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) do not appear to affect outcomes. However, the SSRIs sertraline and citalopram have been demonstrated to reduce symptoms of agitation, compared to placebo.

No solid evidence indicates that folate or vitamin B12 improves outcomes in those with cognitive problems. Statins have no benefit in dementia. Medications for other health conditions may need to be managed differently for a person who has a dementia diagnosis. It is unclear whether blood pressure medication and dementia are linked. People may experience an increase in cardiovascular-related events if these medications are withdrawn.

The Medication Appropriateness Tool for Comorbid Health Conditions in Dementia (MATCH-D) criteria can help identify ways that a diagnosis of dementia changes medication management for other health conditions. These criteria were developed because people with dementia live with an average of five other chronic diseases, which are often managed with medications. The systematic review that informed the criteria were published subsequently in 2018 and in 2022.

=== Sleep disturbances ===
Over 40% of people with dementia report sleep problems. Approaches to treating these sleep problems include medications and non-pharmacological approaches. The use of medications to alleviate sleep disturbances that people with dementia often experience has not been well researched, even for medications that are commonly prescribed. In 2012 the American Geriatrics Society recommended that benzodiazepines such as diazepam, and non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, be avoided for people with dementia due to the risks of increased cognitive impairment and falls. Benzodiazepines are also known to promote delirium. Additionally, little evidence supports the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in this population. No clear evidence shows that melatonin or ramelteon improves sleep for people with dementia due to Alzheimer&#x27;s, but it is used to treat REM sleep behavior disorder in dementia with Lewy bodies. Limited evidence suggests that a low dose of trazodone may improve sleep, however more research is needed.

Non-pharmacological approaches have been suggested for treating sleep problems for those with dementia, however, there is no strong evidence or firm conclusions on the effectiveness of different types of interventions, especially for those who are living in an institutionalized setting such as a nursing home or long-term care home.

===Pain===
As people age, they experience more health problems, and most health problems associated with aging carry a substantial burden of pain; therefore, between 25% and 50% of older adults experience persistent pain. Seniors with dementia experience the same prevalence of conditions likely to cause pain as seniors without dementia. Pain is often overlooked in older adults and, when screened for, is often poorly assessed, especially among those with dementia, since they become incapable of informing others of their pain. Beyond the issue of humane care, unrelieved pain has functional implications. Persistent pain can lead to decreased ambulation, depressed mood, sleep disturbances, impaired appetite, and exacerbation of cognitive impairment and pain-related interference with activity is a factor contributing to falls in the elderly.

Although persistent pain in people with dementia is difficult to communicate, diagnose, and treat, failure to address persistent pain has profound functional, psychosocial and quality of life implications for this vulnerable population. Health professionals often lack the skills and usually lack the time needed to recognize, accurately assess and adequately monitor pain in people with dementia. Family members and friends can make a valuable contribution to the care of a person with dementia by learning to recognize and assess their pain. Educational resources and observational assessment tools are available.

===Eating difficulties===
Persons with dementia may have difficulty eating. Whenever it is available as an option, the recommended response to eating problems is having a caretaker assist them. A secondary option for people who cannot swallow effectively is to consider gastrostomy feeding tube placement as a way to give nutrition. However, in bringing comfort and maintaining functional status while lowering risk of aspiration pneumonia and death, assistance with oral feeding is at least as good as tube feeding. Tube-feeding is associated with agitation, increased use of physical and chemical restraints and worsening pressure ulcers. Tube feedings may cause fluid overload, diarrhea, abdominal pain, local complications, less human interaction and may increase the risk of aspiration.

Benefits in those with advanced dementia has not been shown. The risks of using tube feeding include agitation, rejection by the person (pulling out the tube, or otherwise physical or chemical immobilization to prevent them from doing this), or developing pressure ulcers. The procedure is directly related to a 1% fatality rate with a 3% major complication rate. The percentage of people at end of life with dementia using feeding tubes in the US has dropped from 12% in 2000 to 6% as of 2014.

The immediate and long-term effects of modifying the thickness of fluids for swallowing difficulties in people with dementia are not well known. While thickening fluids may have an immediate positive effect on swallowing and improving oral intake, the long-term impact on the health of the person with dementia should also be considered.

=== Exercise ===

Exercise programs may improve the ability of people with dementia to perform daily activities, but the best type of exercise is still unclear. Getting more exercise can slow the development of cognitive problems such as dementia, proving to reduce the risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease by about 50%. A balance of strength exercise, to help muscles pump blood to the brain, and balance exercises are recommended for aging people. A suggested amount of about hours per week can reduce risks of cognitive decay as well as other health risks like falling.

=== Assistive technology ===
There is a lack of high-quality evidence to determine whether assistive technology effectively supports people with dementia to manage memory issues. Some of the specific things that are used today that helps with dementia today are: clocks, communication aids, electrical appliances the use monitoring, GPS location/ tracking devices, home care robots, in-home cameras, and medication management are just to name a few. Technology has the potential to be a valuable intervention for alleviating loneliness and promoting social connections, supported by available evidence.

===Alternative medicine===
Evidence of the therapeutic values of aromatherapy and massage is unclear. It is not clear if cannabinoids are harmful or effective for people with dementia.

=== Palliative care ===
Given the progressive and terminal nature of dementia, palliative care can be helpful to patients and their caregivers by helping people with the disorder and their caregivers understand what to expect, deal with loss of physical and mental abilities, support the person&#x27;s wishes and goals including surrogate decision making, and discuss wishes for or against CPR and life support. Because the decline can be rapid, and because most people prefer to allow the person with dementia to make their own decisions, palliative care involvement before the late stages of dementia is recommended. Further research is required to determine the appropriate palliative care interventions and how well they help people with advanced dementia.

Person-centered care helps maintain the dignity of people with dementia.

==== Remotely delivered information for caregivers ====
Remotely delivered interventions including support, training and information may reduce the burden for the informal caregiver and improve their depressive symptoms. There is no certain evidence that they improve health-related quality of life.

In several localities in Japan, digital surveillance may be made available to family members, if a dementia patient is prone to wandering and going missing.

== Epidemiology ==


The number of cases of dementia worldwide in 2021 was estimated at 55 million, with close to 10 million new cases each year. According to a report by the World Health Organization, &quot;In 2021, Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia ranked as the seventh leading cause of death, killing 1.8 million lives.&quot; By 2050, the number of people living with dementia is estimated to be over 150 million globally. Around 7% of people over the age of 65 have dementia, with slightly higher rates (up to 10% of those over 65) in places with relatively high life expectancy. An estimated 58% of people with dementia are living in low and middle income countries. The prevalence of dementia differs in different world regions, ranging from 4.7% in Central Europe to 8.7% in North Africa/Middle East; the prevalence in other regions is estimated to be between 5.6 and 7.6%. The number of people living with dementia is estimated to double every 20 years. In 2016 dementia resulted in about 2.4 million deaths, up from 0.8 million in 1990. The genetic and environmental risk factors for dementia disorders vary by ethnicity. For instance, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease among Hispanic/Latino and African American subjects exhibit lower risks associated with gene changes in the apolipoprotein E gene than do non-Hispanic white subjects.

The annual incidence of dementia diagnosis is nearly 10 million worldwide. Almost half of new dementia cases occur in Asia, followed by Europe (25%), the Americas (18%) and Africa (8%). The incidence of dementia increases exponentially with age, doubling with every 6.3-year increase in age. Dementia affects 5% of the population older than 65 and 20–40% of those older than 85. Rates are slightly higher in women than men at ages 65 and greater. The disease trajectory is varied and the median time from diagnosis to death depends strongly on age at diagnosis, from 6.7 years for people diagnosed aged 60–69 to 1.9 years for people diagnosed at 90 or older.

Dementia impacts not only individuals with dementia, but also their carers and the wider society. Among people aged 60 years and over, dementia is ranked the 9th most burdensome condition according to the 2010 Global Burden of Disease (GBD) estimates. The global costs of dementia was around US$818 billion in 2015, a 35.4% increase from US$604 billion in 2010.

A new 2024 study reveals that deaths from dementia in the U.S. have tripled in the past 21 years, rising from around 150,000 in 1999 to over 450,000 in 2020; the likelihood of dying from dementia increased across all demographic groups studied.

=== Affected ages ===

About 3% of people between the ages of 65–74 have dementia, 19% between 75 and 84, and nearly half of those over 85 years of age. As more people are living longer, dementia is becoming more common. For people of a specific age, however, it may be becoming less frequent in the developed world, due to a decrease in modifiable risk factors made possible by greater financial and educational resources. It is one of the most common causes of disability among the elderly but can develop before the age of 65 when it is known as early-onset dementia or presenile dementia. Less than 1% of those with Alzheimer&#x27;s have gene mutations that cause a much earlier development of the disease, around the age of 45, known as early-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. More than 95% of people with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease have the sporadic form (late onset, 80–90 years of age). Worldwide the cost of dementia in 2015 was put at US$818 billion. People with dementia are often physically or chemically restrained to a greater degree than necessary, raising issues of human rights. Social stigma is commonly perceived by those with the condition, and also by their caregivers.

==History==
Until the end of the 19th century, dementia was a much broader clinical concept. It included mental illness and any type of psychosocial incapacity, including reversible conditions. &quot;Dementia&quot; at this time simply referred to anyone who had lost the ability to reason, and was applied equally to psychosis, &quot;organic&quot; diseases like syphilis that destroy the brain, and to the dementia associated with old age, which was attributed to &quot;hardening of the arteries&quot;.

Dementia has been referred to in medical texts since antiquity. One of the earliest known allusions to dementia is attributed to the 7th-century BC Greek philosopher Pythagoras, who divided the human lifespan into six distinct phases: 0–6 (infancy), 7–21 (adolescence), 22–49 (young adulthood), 50–62 (middle age), 63–79 (old age), and 80–death (advanced age). The last two he described as the &quot;senium&quot;, a period of mental and physical decay, and that the final phase was when &quot;the scene of mortal existence closes after a great length of time that very fortunately, few of the human species arrive at, where the mind is reduced to the imbecility of the first epoch of infancy&quot;. In 550 BC, the Athenian statesman and poet Solon argued that the terms of a man&#x27;s will might be invalidated if he exhibited loss of judgement due to advanced age. Chinese medical texts made allusions to the condition as well, and the characters for &quot;dementia&quot; translate literally to &quot;foolish old person&quot;.

Athenian philosophers Aristotle and Plato discussed the mental decline that can come with old age and predicted that this affects everyone who becomes old and nothing can be done to stop this decline from taking place. Plato specifically talked about how the elderly should not be in positions that require responsibility because, &quot;There is not much acumen of the mind that once carried them in their youth, those characteristics one would call judgement, imagination, power of reasoning, and memory. They see them gradually blunted by deterioration and can hardly fulfill their function.&quot;

For comparison, the Roman statesman Cicero held a view much more in line with modern-day medical wisdom that loss of mental function was not inevitable in the elderly and &quot;affected only those old men who were weak-willed&quot;. He spoke of how those who remained mentally active and eager to learn new things could stave off dementia. However, Cicero&#x27;s views on aging, although progressive, were largely ignored in a world that would be dominated for centuries by Aristotle&#x27;s medical writings. Physicians during the Roman Empire, such as Galen and Celsus, simply repeated the beliefs of Aristotle while adding few new contributions to medical knowledge.

Byzantine physicians sometimes wrote of dementia. It is recorded that at least seven emperors whose lifespans exceeded 70 years displayed signs of cognitive decline. In Constantinople, special hospitals housed those diagnosed with dementia or insanity, but these did not apply to the emperors, who were above the law and whose health conditions could not be publicly acknowledged.

Otherwise, little is recorded about dementia in Western medical texts for nearly 1700 years. One of the few references was the 13th-century friar Roger Bacon, who viewed old age as divine punishment for original sin. Although he repeated existing Aristotelian beliefs that dementia was inevitable, he did make the progressive assertion that the brain was the center of memory and thought rather than the heart.

Poets, playwrights, and other writers made frequent allusions to the loss of mental function in old age. William Shakespeare notably mentions it in plays such as &quot;Hamlet&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;.

During the 19th century, doctors generally came to believe that elderly dementia was the result of cerebral atherosclerosis, although opinions fluctuated between the idea that it was due to blockage of the major arteries supplying the brain or small strokes within the vessels of the cerebral cortex.

In 1907, Bavarian psychiatrist Alois Alzheimer was the first to identify and describe the characteristics of progressive dementia in the brain of 51-year-old Auguste Deter. Deter had begun to behave uncharacteristically, including accusing her husband of adultery, neglecting household chores, exhibiting difficulties writing and engaging in conversations, heightened insomnia, and loss of directional sense. At one point, Deter was reported to have &quot;dragged a bed sheet outside, wandered around wildly, and cried for hours at midnight.&quot; Alzheimer began treating Deter when she entered a Frankfurt mental hospital on November 25, 1901. During her ongoing treatment, Deter and her husband struggled to afford the cost of the medical care, and Alzheimer agreed to continue her treatment in exchange for Deter&#x27;s medical records and donation of her brain upon death. Deter died on April 8, 1906, after succumbing to sepsis and pneumonia. Alzheimer conducted the brain biopsy using the Bielschowsky stain method, which was a new development at the time, and he observed senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and atherosclerotic alteration. At the time, the consensus among medical doctors had been that senile plaques were generally found in older patients, and the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles was an entirely new observation at the time. Alzheimer presented his findings at the 37th psychiatry conference of southwestern Germany in Tübingen on April 11, 1906; however, the information was poorly received by his peers. By 1910, Alois Alzheimer&#x27;s teacher, Emil Kraepelin, published a book in which he coined the term &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s disease&quot; in an attempt to acknowledge the importance of Alzheimer&#x27;s discovery.

By the 1960s, the link between neurodegenerative diseases and age-related cognitive decline had become more established. By the 1970s, the medical community maintained that vascular dementia was rarer than previously thought and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease caused the vast majority of old age mental impairments. More recently however, it is believed that dementia is often a mixture of conditions.

In 1976, neurologist Robert Katzmann suggested a link between senile dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. Katzmann suggested that much of the senile dementia occurring (by definition) after the age of 65, was pathologically identical with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease occurring in people under age 65 and therefore should not be treated differently. Katzmann thus suggested that Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, if taken to occur over age 65, is actually common, not rare, and was the fourth- or 5th-leading cause of death, even though rarely reported on death certificates in 1976.

A helpful finding was that although the incidence of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease increased with age (from 5–10% of 75-year-olds to as many as 40–50% of 90-year-olds), no threshold was found by which age all persons developed it. This is shown by documented supercentenarians (people living to 110 or more) who experienced no substantial cognitive impairment. Some evidence suggests that dementia is most likely to develop between ages 80 and 84 and individuals who pass that point without being affected have a lower chance of developing it. Women account for a larger percentage of dementia cases than men. This can be attributed in part to their longer overall lifespan and greater odds of attaining an age where the condition is likely to occur.

Much like other diseases associated with aging, dementia was comparatively rare before the 20th century, because few people lived past 80. Conversely, syphilitic dementia was widespread in the developed world until it was largely eradicated by the use of penicillin after World War II. With significant increases in life expectancy thereafter, the number of people over 65 started rapidly climbing. While elderly persons constituted an average of 3–5% of the population prior to 1945, by 2010 many countries reached 10–14% and in Germany and Japan, this figure exceeded 20%. Public awareness of Alzheimer&#x27;s Disease greatly increased in 1994 when former US president Ronald Reagan announced that he had been diagnosed with the condition.

In the 21st century, other types of dementia were differentiated from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and vascular dementias (the most common types). This differentiation is on the basis of pathological examination of brain tissues, by symptomatology, and by different patterns of brain metabolic activity in nuclear medical imaging tests such as SPECT and PET scans of the brain. The various forms have differing prognoses and differing epidemiologic risk factors. The main cause for many diseases, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, remains unclear.

===Terminology===
Dementia in the elderly was once called senile dementia or senility, and viewed as a normal and somewhat inevitable aspect of aging.

By 1913–20 the term &quot;dementia praecox&quot; was introduced to suggest the development of senile-type dementia at a younger age. Eventually the two terms fused, so that until 1952 physicians used the terms &quot;dementia praecox&quot; (precocious dementia) and &quot;schizophrenia&quot; interchangeably. Since then, science has determined that dementia and schizophrenia are two different disorders, though they share some similarities. The term &quot;precocious dementia&quot; for a mental illness suggested that a type of mental illness like schizophrenia (including paranoia and decreased cognitive capacity) could be expected to arrive normally in all persons with greater age (see paraphrenia). After about 1920, the beginning use of &quot;dementia&quot; for what is now understood as schizophrenia and senile dementia helped limit the word&#x27;s meaning to &quot;permanent, irreversible mental deterioration&quot;. This began the change to the later use of the term. In recent studies, researchers have seen a connection between those diagnosed with schizophrenia and patients who are diagnosed with dementia, finding a positive correlation between the two diseases.

The view that dementia must always be the result of a particular disease process led for a time to the proposed diagnosis of &quot;senile dementia of the Alzheimer&#x27;s type&quot; (SDAT) in persons over the age of 65, with &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s disease&quot; diagnosed in persons younger than 65 who had the same pathology. Eventually, however, it was agreed that the age limit was artificial, and that &quot;Alzheimer&#x27;s disease&quot; was the appropriate term for persons with that particular brain pathology, regardless of age.

After 1952, mental illnesses including schizophrenia were removed from the category of &quot;organic brain syndromes&quot;, and thus (by definition) removed from possible causes of &quot;dementing illnesses&quot; (dementias). At the same, however, the traditional cause of senile dementia – &quot;hardening of the arteries&quot; – now returned as a set of dementias of vascular cause (small strokes). These were now termed &quot;multi-infarct dementias&quot; or &quot;vascular dementias&quot;.

==Society and culture==
The societal cost of dementia is high, especially for caregivers. According to a UK-based study, almost two out of three carers of people with dementia feel lonely. Most of the carers in the study were family members or friends.

, the annual cost per Alzheimer&#x27;s patient in the United States was around $19,144.36. The total costs for the nation is estimated to be about $167.74 billion. By 2030, it is predicted the annual socioeconomic cost will total to about $507 billion, and by 2050 that number is expected to reach $1.89 trillion. This steady increase will be seen not just within the United States but globally. Global estimates for the costs of dementia were $957.56 billion in 2015, but by 2050 the estimated global cost is $9.12 trillion.

Many countries consider the care of people living with dementia a national priority and invest in resources and education to better inform health and social service workers, unpaid caregivers, relatives and members of the wider community. Several countries have authored national plans or strategies. These plans recognize that people can live reasonably with dementia for years, as long as the right support and timely access to a diagnosis are available. Former British Prime Minister David Cameron described dementia as a &quot;national crisis&quot;, affecting 800,000 people in the United Kingdom. In fact, dementia has become the leading cause of death for women in England.

There, as with all mental disorders, people with dementia could potentially be a danger to themselves or others, they can be detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 for assessment, care and treatment. This is a last resort, and is usually avoided by people with family or friends who can ensure care.

Some hospitals in Britain work to provide enriched and friendlier care. To make the hospital wards calmer and less overwhelming to residents, staff replaced the usual nurses&#x27; station with a collection of smaller desks, similar to a reception area. The incorporation of bright lighting helps increase positive mood and allow residents to see more easily.

Driving with dementia can lead to injury or death. Doctors should advise appropriate testing on when to quit driving. The United Kingdom DVLA (Driver &amp; Vehicle Licensing Agency) states that people with dementia who specifically have poor short-term memory, disorientation, or lack of insight or judgment are not allowed to drive, and in these instances the DVLA must be informed so that the driving license can be revoked. They acknowledge that in low-severity cases and those with an early diagnosis, drivers may be permitted to continue driving.

Many support networks are available to people with dementia and their families and caregivers. Charitable organizations aim to raise awareness and campaign for the rights of people living with dementia. Support and guidance are available on assessing testamentary capacity in people with dementia.

In 2015, Atlantic Philanthropies announced a $177 million gift aimed at understanding and reducing dementia. The recipient was Global Brain Health Institute, a program co-led by the University of California, San Francisco and Trinity College Dublin. This donation is the largest non-capital grant Atlantic has ever made, and the biggest philanthropic donation in Irish history.

In October 2020, the Caretaker&#x27;s last music release, &quot;Everywhere at the End of Time&quot;, was popularized by TikTok users for its depiction of the stages of dementia. Caregivers were in favor of this phenomenon; Leyland Kirby, the creator of the record, echoed this sentiment, explaining it could cause empathy among a younger public.

On November 2, 2020, Scottish billionaire Sir Tom Hunter donated £1 million to dementia charities, after watching a former music teacher with dementia, Paul Harvey, playing one of his own compositions on the piano in a viral video. The donation was announced to be split between the Alzheimer&#x27;s Society and Music for Dementia.

Awareness

Celebrities have used their platforms to raise awareness for the different forms of dementia and the need for further support, including former First Lady of California Maria Shriver, Maria Shriver | My Brain™ | Alzheimer’s Association Academy Award Winning actor Samuel L. Jackson, Editor-in-Chief of ELLE Magazine Nina Garcia, professional skateboarder Tony Hawk, and others.

Additional Alzheimer&#x27;s awareness has been raised through the diagnoses of high-profile persons themselves, including

* Actor Bruce Willis
* Actor Robin Williams
* Activist Rosa Parks
* 40th President of the United States, Ronald Reagan
* Former Mrs. Colorado Springs Joanna Fix Mrs. Colorado Springs uses title, young-onset Alzheimer&#x27;s diagnosis to spread awareness about dementia
* TV Host Wendy Williams Wendy Williams diagnosed with same form of dementia as Bruce Willis
* Musician Tony Bennett
* Musician Maureen McGovern
* Dancer and pin-up model Rita Hayworth Rita Hayworth&#x27;s misdiagnosed struggle

<text>Rubber, also called India rubber, latex, Amazonian rubber, caucho, or caoutchouc, as initially produced, consists of polymers of the organic compound isoprene, with minor impurities of other organic compounds. 

Types of polyisoprene that are used as natural rubbers are classified as elastomers.

Currently, rubber is harvested mainly in the form of the latex from the Pará rubber tree (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;) or others. The latex is a sticky, milky and white colloid drawn off by making incisions in the bark and collecting the fluid in vessels in a process called &quot;tapping&quot;. Manufacturers refine this latex into the rubber that is ready for commercial processing.

Natural rubber is used extensively in many applications and products, either alone or in combination with other materials. In most of its useful forms, it has a large stretch ratio and high resilience and also is buoyant and water-proof.

Industrial demand for rubber-like materials began to outstrip natural rubber supplies by the end of the 19th century, leading to the synthesis of synthetic rubber in 1909 by chemical means. 

Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Cambodia are four of the leading rubber producers. 

== Varieties ==

=== Amazonian rubber tree (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;) ===
The major commercial source of natural rubber latex is the Amazonian rubber tree (&quot;Hevea brasiliensis&quot;), a member of the spurge family, &quot;Euphorbiaceae&quot;. Once native to Brazil, the species is now pan-tropical. This species is preferred because it grows well under cultivation. A properly managed tree responds to wounding by producing more latex for several years. 

=== Congo rubber (&quot;Landolphia owariensis&quot; and &quot;L.&quot; spp.) ===
Congo rubber, formerly a major source of rubber, which motivated the atrocities in the Congo Free State, came from vines in the genus &quot;Landolphia&quot; (&quot;L. kirkii&quot;, &quot;L. heudelotis&quot;, and &quot;L. owariensis&quot;).

=== Dandelion ===
Dandelion milk contains latex. The latex exhibits the same quality as the natural rubber from rubber trees. In the wild types of dandelion, latex content is low and varies greatly. In Nazi Germany, research projects tried to use dandelions as a base for rubber production, but failed. In 2013, by inhibiting one key enzyme and using modern cultivation methods and optimization techniques, scientists in the Fraunhofer Institute for Molecular Biology and Applied Ecology (IME) in Germany developed a cultivar of the Kazakh dandelion (&quot;Taraxacum kok-saghyz&quot;) that seems suitable for commercial production of natural rubber. In collaboration with Continental Tires, IME began a pilot facility.

=== Other ===
Many other plants produce forms of latex rich in isoprene polymers, though not all produce usable forms of polymer as easily as the Pará. Some of them require more elaborate processing to produce anything like usable rubber, and most are more difficult to tap. Some produce other desirable materials, for example gutta-percha (&quot;Palaquium gutta&quot;) and chicle from &quot;Manilkara&quot; species. Others that have been commercially exploited, or at least showed promise as rubber sources, include the rubber fig (&quot;Ficus elastica&quot;), Panama rubber tree (&quot;Castilla elastica&quot;), various spurges (&quot;Euphorbia&quot; spp.), lettuce (&quot;Lactuca&quot; species), the related &quot;Scorzonera tau-saghyz&quot;, various &quot;Taraxacum&quot; species, including common dandelion (&quot;Taraxacum officinale&quot;) and Kazakh dandelion, and, perhaps most importantly for its hypoallergenic properties, guayule (&quot;Parthenium argentatum&quot;). The term gum rubber is sometimes applied to the tree-obtained version of natural rubber in order to distinguish it from the synthetic version.

== History ==

The first use of rubber was by the indigenous cultures of Mesoamerica. The earliest archeological evidence of the use of natural latex from the &quot;Hevea&quot; tree comes from the Olmec culture, in which rubber was first used for making balls for the Mesoamerican ballgame. Rubber was later used by the Maya and Aztec cultures: in addition to making balls, Aztecs used rubber for other purposes, such as making containers and making textiles waterproof by impregnating them with the latex sap.

Charles Marie de La Condamine is credited with introducing samples of rubber to the &quot;Académie Royale des Sciences&quot; of France in 1736. In 1751, he presented a paper by François Fresneau to the Académie (published in 1755) that described many of rubber&#x27;s properties. This has been referred to as the first scientific paper on rubber. In England, Joseph Priestley, in 1770, observed that a piece of the material was extremely good for rubbing off pencil marks on paper, hence the name &quot;rubber&quot;. It slowly made its way around England. In 1764, François Fresnau discovered that turpentine was a rubber solvent. Giovanni Fabbroni is credited with the discovery of naphtha as a rubber solvent in 1779. Charles Goodyear redeveloped vulcanization in 1839, although Mesoamericans had used stabilized rubber for balls and other objects as early as 1600 BC.

South America remained the main source of latex rubber used during much of the 19th century. The rubber trade was heavily controlled by business interests but no laws expressly prohibited the export of seeds or plants. In 1876, Henry Wickham smuggled 70,000 Amazonian rubber tree seeds from Brazil and delivered them to Kew Gardens, England. Only 2,400 of these germinated. Seedlings were then sent to India, British Ceylon (Sri Lanka), Dutch East Indies (Indonesia), Singapore, and British Malaya. Malaya (now Peninsular Malaysia) was later to become the biggest producer of rubber.

In the early 1900s, the Congo Free State in Africa was also a significant source of natural rubber latex, mostly gathered by forced labor. King Leopold II&#x27;s colonial state brutally enforced production quotas due to the high price of natural rubber at the time. Tactics to enforce the rubber quotas included removing the hands of victims to prove they had been killed. Soldiers often came back from raids with baskets full of chopped-off hands. Villages that resisted were razed to encourage better compliance locally. 

The rubber boom in the Amazon also similarly affected indigenous populations to varying degrees. Correrias, or slave raids were frequent in Colombia, Peru and Bolivia where many were either captured or killed. The best-known case of atrocities generated from rubber extraction in South America came from the Putumayo genocide. Between the 1880s and 1913, Julio César Arana and his company, which would become the Peruvian Amazon Company, controlled the Putumayo river. W. E. Hardenburg, Benjamin Saldaña Rocca and Roger Casement were influential figures in exposing these atrocities. Roger Casement was also prominent in revealing the Congo atrocities to the world. Days before entering Iquitos by boat Casement wrote &quot;&#x27;Caoutchouc was first called &#x27;india rubber,&#x27; because it came from the Indies, and the earliest European use of it was to rub out or erase. It is now called India rubber because it rubs out or erases the Indians.&quot;

In India, commercial cultivation was introduced by British planters, although the experimental efforts to grow rubber on a commercial scale were initiated as early as 1873 at the Calcutta Botanical Garden. The first commercial &quot;Hevea&quot; plantations were established at Thattekadu in Kerala in 1902. In later years the plantation expanded to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands of India. Today, India is the world&#x27;s third-largest producer and fourth-largest consumer of rubber.

In Singapore and Malaya, commercial production was heavily promoted by Sir Henry Nicholas Ridley, who served as the first Scientific Director of the Singapore Botanic Gardens from 1888 to 1911. He distributed rubber seeds to many planters and developed the first technique for tapping trees for latex without causing serious harm to the tree. Because of his fervent promotion of this crop, he is popularly remembered by the nickname &quot;Mad Ridley&quot;.

=== Pre–World War II ===
Before World War II significant uses included door and window profiles, hoses, belts, gaskets, matting, flooring, and dampeners (antivibration mounts) for the automotive industry. The use of rubber in car tires (initially solid rather than pneumatic) in particular consumed a significant amount of rubber. Gloves (medical, household, and industrial) and toy balloons were large consumers of rubber, although the type of rubber used is concentrated latex. Significant tonnage of rubber was used as adhesives in many manufacturing industries and products, although the two most noticeable were the paper and the carpet industries. Rubber was commonly used to make rubber bands and pencil erasers.

Rubber produced as a fiber, sometimes called &#x27;elastic&#x27;, had significant value to the textile industry because of its excellent elongation and recovery properties. For these purposes, manufactured rubber fiber was made as either an extruded round fiber or rectangular fibers cut into strips from extruded film. Because of its low dye acceptance, feel and appearance, the rubber fiber was either covered by yarn of another fiber or directly woven with other yarns into the fabric. Rubber yarns were used in foundation garments. While rubber is still used in textile manufacturing, its low tenacity limits its use in lightweight garments because latex lacks resistance to oxidizing agents and is damaged by aging, sunlight, oil and perspiration. The textile industry turned to neoprene (polymer of chloroprene), a type of synthetic rubber, as well as another more commonly used elastomer fiber, spandex (also known as elastane), because of their superiority to rubber in both strength and durability.

==Properties==

Rubber exhibits unique physical and chemical properties. Rubber&#x27;s stress–strain behavior exhibits the Mullins effect and the Payne effect and is often modeled as hyperelastic. Rubber strain crystallizes. Because there are weakened allylic C–H bonds in each repeat unit, natural rubber is susceptible to vulcanisation as well as being sensitive to ozone cracking. The two main solvents for rubber are turpentine and naphtha (petroleum). Because rubber does not dissolve easily, the material is finely divided by shredding prior to its immersion. An ammonia solution can be used to prevent the coagulation of raw latex. Rubber begins to melt at approximately .

===Elasticity===


On a microscopic scale, relaxed rubber is a disorganized cluster of erratically changing wrinkled chains. In stretched rubber, the chains are almost linear. The restoring force is due to the preponderance of wrinkled conformations over more linear ones. For the quantitative treatment see ideal chain, for more examples see entropic force.

Cooling below the glass transition temperature permits local conformational changes but a reordering is practically impossible because of the larger energy barrier for the concerted movement of longer chains. &quot;Frozen&quot; rubber&#x27;s elasticity is low and strain results from small changes of bond lengths and angles: this caused the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, when the American Space Shuttle&#x27;s flattened o-rings failed to relax to fill a widening gap. The glass transition is fast and reversible: the force resumes on heating.

The parallel chains of stretched rubber are susceptible to crystallization. This takes some time because turns of twisted chains have to move out of the way of the growing crystallites. Crystallization has occurred, for example, when, after days, an inflated toy balloon is found withered at a relatively large remaining volume. Where it is touched, it shrinks because the temperature of the hand is enough to melt the crystals.

Vulcanization of rubber creates di- and polysulfide bonds between chains, which limits the degrees of freedom and results in chains that tighten more quickly for a given strain, thereby increasing the elastic force constant and making the rubber harder and less extensible.

===Malodour===
Raw rubber storage depots and rubber processing can produce malodour that is serious enough to become a source of complaints and protest to those living in the vicinity. Microbial impurities originate during the processing of block rubber. These impurities break down during storage or thermal degradation and produce volatile organic compounds. Examination of these compounds using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography (GC) indicates that they contain sulfur, ammonia, alkenes, ketones, esters, hydrogen sulfide, nitrogen, and low-molecular-weight fatty acids (C2–C5). When latex concentrate is produced from rubber, sulfuric acid is used for coagulation. This produces malodourous hydrogen sulfide. The industry can mitigate these bad odours with scrubber systems.

== Chemical makeup ==
Rubber is the polymer cis-1,4-polyisoprene – with a molecular weight of 100,000 to 1,000,000 daltons. Typically, a small percentage (up to 5% of dry mass) of other materials, such as proteins, fatty acids, resins, and inorganic materials (salts) are found in natural rubber. Polyisoprene can also be created synthetically, producing what is sometimes referred to as &quot;synthetic natural rubber&quot;, but the synthetic and natural routes are distinct. Some natural rubber sources, such as gutta-percha, are composed of trans-1,4-polyisoprene, a structural isomer that has similar properties. Natural rubber is an elastomer and a thermoplastic. Once the rubber is vulcanized, it is a thermoset. Most rubber in everyday use is vulcanized to a point where it shares properties of both; i.e., if it is heated and cooled, it is degraded but not destroyed. The final properties of a rubber item depend not just on the polymer, but also on modifiers and fillers, such as carbon black, factice, whiting and others.

===Biosynthesis===
Rubber particles are formed in the cytoplasm of specialized latex-producing cells called laticifers within rubber plants. Rubber particles are surrounded by a single phospholipid membrane with hydrophobic tails pointed inward. The membrane allows biosynthetic proteins to be sequestered at the surface of the growing rubber particle, which allows new monomeric units to be added from outside the biomembrane, but within the lacticifer. The rubber particle is an enzymatically active entity that contains three layers of material, the rubber particle, a biomembrane and free monomeric units. The biomembrane is held tightly to the rubber core by the high negative charge along the double bonds of the rubber polymer backbone. Free monomeric units and conjugated proteins make up the outer layer. The rubber precursor is isopentenyl pyrophosphate (an allylic compound), which elongates by Mg2+-dependent condensation by the action of rubber transferase. The monomer adds to the pyrophosphate end of the growing polymer. The process displaces the terminal high-energy pyrophosphate. The reaction produces a cis polymer. The initiation step is catalyzed by prenyltransferase, which converts three monomers of isopentenyl pyrophosphate into farnesyl pyrophosphate. The farnesyl pyrophosphate can bind to rubber transferase to elongate a new rubber polymer.

The required isopentenyl pyrophosphate is obtained from the mevalonate pathway, which derives from acetyl-CoA in the cytosol. In plants, isoprene pyrophosphate can also be obtained from the 1-deox-D-xyulose-5-phosphate/2-C-methyl-D-erythritol-4-phosphate pathway within plasmids. The relative ratio of the farnesyl pyrophosphate initiator unit and isoprenyl pyrophosphate elongation monomer determines the rate of new particle synthesis versus elongation of existing particles. Though rubber is known to be produced by only one enzyme, extracts of latex host numerous small molecular weight proteins with unknown function. The proteins possibly serve as cofactors, as the synthetic rate decreases with complete removal.

==Production==


More than 28 million tons of rubber were produced in 2017, of which approximately 47% was natural. Since the bulk is synthetic, which is derived from petroleum, the price of natural rubber is determined, to a large extent, by the prevailing global price of crude oil. Asia was the main source of natural rubber, accounting for about 90% of output in 2021. The three largest producers, Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia, together account for around 72% of all natural rubber production. Natural rubber is not cultivated widely in its native continent of South America because of the South American leaf blight, and other natural predators there.

=== Cultivation ===
Rubber latex is extracted from rubber trees. The economic life of rubber trees in plantations is around 32 years, with up to 7 years being an immature phase and about 25 years of productive phase.

The soil requirement is well-drained, weathered soil consisting of laterite, lateritic types, sedimentary types, nonlateritic red or alluvial soils.

The climatic conditions for optimum growth of rubber trees are:
* Rainfall of around evenly distributed without any marked dry season and with at least 100 rainy days per year
* Temperature range of about , with a monthly mean of 
* Atmospheric humidity of around 80%
* About 2,000 hours sunshine per year at the rate of six hours per day throughout the year
* Absence of strong winds

Many high-yielding clones have been developed for commercial planting. These clones yield more than of dry rubber per year, under ideal conditions.

Rubber production has been linked to deforestation. Rubber therefore is one of seven commodities included in the 2023 EU Regulation on Deforestation-free products (EUDR), which aims to guarantee that the products European Union (EU) citizens consume do not contribute to deforestation or forest degradation worldwide.

=== Collection ===
In places such as Kerala and Sri Lanka, where coconuts are in abundance, the half shell of coconut was used as the latex collection container. Glazed pottery or aluminium or plastic cups became more common in Kerala-India and other countries. The cups are supported by a wire that encircles the tree. This wire incorporates a spring so it can stretch as the tree grows. The latex is led into the cup by a galvanised &quot;spout&quot; knocked into the bark. Rubber tapping normally takes place early in the morning, when the internal pressure of the tree is highest. A good tapper can tap a tree every 20 seconds on a standard half-spiral system, and a common daily &quot;task&quot; size is between 450 and 650 trees. Trees are usually tapped on alternate or third days, although many variations in timing, length and number of cuts are used. &quot;Tappers would make a slash in the bark with a small hatchet. These slanting cuts allowed latex to flow from ducts located on the exterior or the inner layer of bark (cambium) of the tree. Since the cambium controls the growth of the tree, growth stops if it is cut. Thus, rubber tapping demanded accuracy, so that the incisions would not be too many given the size of the tree, or too deep, which could stunt its growth or kill it.&quot;
It is usual to tap a panel at least twice, sometimes three times, during the tree&#x27;s life. The economic life of the tree depends on how well the tapping is carried out, as the critical factor is bark consumption. A standard in Malaysia for alternate daily tapping is 25 cm (vertical) bark consumption per year. The latex-containing tubes in the bark ascend in a spiral to the right. For this reason, tapping cuts usually ascend to the left to cut more tubes. The trees drip latex for about four hours, stopping as latex coagulates naturally on the tapping cut, thus blocking the latex tubes in the bark. Tappers usually rest and have a meal after finishing their tapping work and then start collecting the liquid &quot;field latex&quot; at about midday.

The four types of field coagula are &quot;cuplump&quot;, &quot;treelace&quot;, &quot;smallholders&#x27; lump&quot;, and &quot;earth scrap&quot;. Each has significantly different properties. Some trees continue to drip after the collection leading to a small amount of &quot;cup lump&quot; that is collected at the next tapping. The latex that coagulates on the cut is also collected as &quot;tree lace&quot;. Tree lace and cup lump together account for 10%–20% of the dry rubber produced. Latex that drips onto the ground, &quot;earth scrap&quot;, is also collected periodically for processing of low-grade product.

===== Cup lump =====
Cup lump is the coagulated material found in the collection cup when the tapper next visits the tree to tap it again. It arises from latex clinging to the walls of the cup after the latex was last poured into the bucket, and from late-dripping latex exuded before the latex-carrying vessels of the tree become blocked. It is of higher purity and of greater value than the other three types.

&#x27;Cup lumps&#x27; can also be used to describe a completely different type of coagulate that has collected in smallholder plantations over a period of 1–2 weeks. After tapping all of the trees, the tapper will return to each tree and stir in some type of acid, which allows the newly harvested latex to mix with the previously coagulated material. The rubber/acid mixture is what gives rubber plantations, markets, and factories a strong odor.

===== Tree lace =====
Tree lace is the coagulum strip that the tapper peels off the previous cut before making a new cut. It usually has higher copper and manganese contents than cup lump. Both copper and manganese are pro-oxidants and can damage the physical properties of the dry rubber.

===== Smallholders&#x27; lump =====
Smallholders&#x27; lump is produced by smallholders, who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees on their way to work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to get it to a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to coagulate the latex – a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.

===== Earth scrap =====
Earth scrap is material that gathers around the base of the tree. It arises from latex overflowing from the cut and running down the bark, from rain flooding a collection cup containing latex, and from spillage from tappers&#x27; buckets during collection. It contains soil and other contaminants, and has variable rubber content, depending on the amount of contaminants. Earth scrap is collected by field workers two or three times a year and may be cleaned in a scrap-washer to recover the rubber, or sold to a contractor who cleans it and recovers the rubber. It is of low quality.

=== Processing ===
Latex coagulates in the cups if kept for long and must be collected before this happens. The collected latex, &quot;field latex&quot;, is transferred into coagulation tanks for the preparation of dry rubber or transferred into air-tight containers with sieving for ammoniation. Ammoniation, invented by patent lawyer and vice-president of the United States Rubber Company Ernest Hopkinson around 1920, preserves the latex in a colloidal state for longer periods of time. Latex is generally processed into either latex concentrate for manufacture of dipped goods or coagulated under controlled, clean conditions using formic acid. The coagulated latex can then be processed into the higher-grade, technically specified block rubbers such as SVR 3L or SVR CV or used to produce Ribbed Smoke Sheet grades. Naturally coagulated rubber (cup lump) is used in the manufacture of TSR10 and TSR20 grade rubbers. Processing for these grades is a size reduction and cleaning process to remove contamination and prepare the material for the final stage of drying.

The dried material is then baled and palletized for storage and shipment.

===Molecular structure===
Rubber is a natural polymer of isoprene (polyisoprene), and an elastomer (a stretchy polymer). Polymers are simply chains of molecules that can be linked together. Rubber is one of the few naturally occurring polymers and prized for its high stretch ratio, resilience, and water-proof properties. Other examples of natural polymers include tortoise shell, amber, and animal horn. When harvested, latex rubber takes the form of latex, an opaque, white, milky suspension of rubber particles in water. It is then transformed through industrial processes to the solid form widely seen in manufactured goods.

=== Vulcanized rubber ===


Natural rubber is reactive and vulnerable to oxidization, but it can be stabilized through a heating process called vulcanization. Vulcanization is a process by which the rubber is heated and sulfur, peroxide, or bisphenol are added to improve resistance and elasticity and to prevent it from oxidizing. Carbon black, which can be derived from a petroleum refinery or other natural incineration processes, is sometimes used as an additive to rubber to improve its strength, especially in vehicle tires.

During vulcanization, rubber&#x27;s polyisoprene molecules (long chains of isoprene) are heated and cross-linked with molecular bonds to sulfur, forming a 3-D matrix. The optimal percentage of sulfur is approximately 10%. In this form, the polyisoprene molecules orientation is still random but they become aligned when the rubber is stretched. This sulfur vulcanization makes the rubber stronger and more rigid, but still very elastic. And through the vulcanization process, the sulfur and latex are meant to be totally used up in individual form.

=== Transportation ===
Natural rubber latex is shipped from factories in Southeast Asia, South America, and West and Central Africa to destinations around the world. As the cost of natural rubber has risen significantly and rubber products are dense, the shipping methods offering the lowest cost per unit weight are preferred. Depending on destination, warehouse availability, and transportation conditions, some methods are preferred by certain buyers. In international trade, latex rubber is mostly shipped in 20-foot ocean containers. Inside the container, smaller containers are used to store the latex.

== Rubber shortage and global economics ==
There is growing concern for the future supply of rubber due to various factors, including plant disease, climate change, and the volatile market price of rubber. Producers of natural rubber are mostly small family-held plantations, often serving large industrial aggregators. High volatility in the price of rubber affects rubber plantation investment, and farmers may remove their rubber trees if the international market spot price of a seemingly more profitable crop (for example palm oil) surges in relation to rubber. 

For instance, during the 2020 and 2021 international COVID-19 pandemic, demand for rubber gloves surged, leading to a spike in rubber prices of about 30%. In addition to the pandemic, demand exceeded supply in part because long term plantations had been torn out and replaced with other crops over the previous 5–10 years, and other areas were affected by climate-fueled natural disasters. In this environment, producers did increase their prices in keeping with supply and demand dynamics, putting upward price pressure on the whole downstream supply chain.

== Uses ==

Uncured rubber is used for cements; for adhesive, insulating, and friction tapes; and for crepe rubber used in insulating blankets and footwear. Vulcanized rubber has many more applications. Resistance to abrasion makes softer kinds of rubber valuable for the treads of vehicle tires and conveyor belts, and makes hard rubber valuable for pump housings and piping used in the handling of abrasive sludge.

The flexibility of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for various kinds of shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration. Its relative gas impermeability makes it useful in the manufacture of articles such as air hoses, balloons, balls and cushions. The resistance of rubber to water and to the action of most fluid chemicals has led to its use in rainwear, diving gear, and chemical and medicinal tubing and as a lining for storage tanks, processing equipment and railroad tank cars. Because of their electrical resistance, soft rubber goods are used as insulation and for protective gloves, shoes, and blankets; hard rubber is used for articles such as telephone housings and parts for radio sets, meters, and other electrical instruments. The coefficient of friction of rubber, which is high on dry surfaces and low on wet surfaces, leads to its use for power-transmission belting, highly flexible couplings, and for water-lubricated bearings in deep-well pumps. Indian rubber balls or lacrosse balls are made of rubber.

Around 25 million tonnes of rubber are produced each year, of which 30 percent is natural. The remainder is synthetic rubber derived from petrochemical sources. The top end of latex production results in latex products such as surgeons&#x27; gloves, balloons, and other relatively high-value products. The mid-range which comes from the technically specified natural rubber materials ends up largely in tires but also in conveyor belts, marine products, windshield wipers, and miscellaneous goods. Natural rubber offers good elasticity, while synthetic materials tend to offer better resistance to environmental factors such as oils, temperature, chemicals, and ultraviolet light. &quot;Cured rubber&quot; is rubber that has been compounded and subjected to the vulcanisation process to create cross-links within the rubber matrix. Rubber can be added to cement to improve its properties.

==Allergic reactions==
Some people have a serious latex allergy, and exposure to natural latex rubber products such as latex gloves can cause anaphylactic shock. The antigenic proteins found in &quot;Hevea&quot; latex are reduced by about 99.9 percent (though not eliminated) through vulcanization processing. 

Latex from non-&quot;Hevea&quot; sources, such as guayule, can be used without allergic reaction by persons with an allergy to &quot;Hevea&quot; latex.

Some allergic reactions are not to the latex itself, but from residues of chemicals used to accelerate the cross-linking process. Although this may be confused with an allergy to latex, it is distinct from it, typically taking the form of Type IV hypersensitivity in the presence of traces of specific processing chemicals.

==Microbial degradation==
Natural rubber is susceptible to degradation by a wide range of bacteria.
The bacteria &quot;Streptomyces coelicolor&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas citronellolis&quot;, and &quot;Nocardia&quot; spp. are capable of degrading vulcanized natural rubber.

<text>Stargate SG-1 (often stylized in all caps, or abbreviated SG-1) is a military science fiction adventure television series within Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer&#x27;s &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise. The show, created by Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner, is based on the 1994 science fiction film &quot;Stargate&quot; by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. The television series was filmed in and around the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. The series premiered on Showtime on July 27, 1997, and moved to the Sci Fi Channel on June 7, 2002; the series finale aired on Sky1 on March 13, 2007.

The story of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; begins about a year after the events of the feature film when the United States government learns that an ancient alien device called the Stargate can access a network of such devices on a multitude of planets and in space. SG-1 is an elite United States Air Force special operations team, one of about 20 teams from Earth who explore the galaxy and defend against alien threats such as the Goa&#x27;uld, the Replicators and the Ori. The series draws upon Egyptian, Greek and Norse mythology, as well as the legend of King Arthur.

The series was a ratings success for its first-run broadcasters and in syndication and was particularly popular in Europe and Australia. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;&#x27;s awards include eight Emmy nominations. It also spawned the animated television series &quot;Stargate Infinity&quot;, the live-action spin-off TV series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;, and &quot;Stargate Origins&quot; and the direct-to-DVD films &quot;&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Merchandise for &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; includes games and toys, print media and an original audio series.

== Series overview ==
The plot of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; picks up a year after the conclusion of the events recounted in the original feature film. It follows the adventures of SG-1, a military team from Earth. SG-1 and a dozen other SG teams venture to distant planets using an alien portal known as a Stargate, which in the series is housed in a top-secret United States Air Force military base known as Stargate Command (SGC) in the underground Cheyenne Mountain Complex in Colorado Springs, Colorado. In the first eight seasons, the mission of the SG teams is to explore the galaxy and search for alien technology and allies to defend Earth against the Goa&#x27;uld, a snake-like parasitic alien race from planet P3X-888 that takes humans as unwilling hosts. As explained in the series&#x27; backstory, the Goa&#x27;uld had transported human slaves from Earth to other habitable planets across the galaxy thousands of years ago and now pose as gods of old Earth mythologies, particularly Ancient Egypt. SG-1 eventually learns that highly evolved human-like beings, known as the Ancients, had originally built the Stargate network millions of years earlier, before ascending to a higher plane of existence, after which they pledged not to interfere in the lives of other species.

=== Goa&#x27;uld Arc ===
The pilot episode (&quot;Children of the Gods&quot;), set one year after the events of the original feature film, introduces the Goa&#x27;uld System Lord Apophis (Peter Williams) as the main antagonist when he attacks Earth&#x27;s mothballed SGC military base through the Stargate and kidnaps an airman. The SGC is brought back into action when the Stargate is revealed to be part of an interplanetary network connecting countless planets. SG teams are created to help defend Earth against the Goa&#x27;uld, who have interstellar pyramid warships and vast armies of Jaffa (hereditary slaves and human incubators to the Goa&#x27;uld) at their disposal. Earth&#x27;s flagship team SG-1, which includes Apophis&#x27;s defected First Prime (lead Jaffa soldier) Teal&#x27;c, initiates several alliances with other cultures in the galaxy, such as the Goa&#x27;uld-like but truly symbiotic Tok&#x27;ra, the advanced human Tollan, the pacifist Nox, the benevolent Roswell-alien Asgard and remnants of the powerful Ancients. Another alien threat arises in the Season 3 finale (&quot;Nemesis&quot;) in the form of sentient machines called Replicators. Meanwhile, rogue agents of a shadowy intelligence agency on Earth, the NID, repeatedly attempt to take control of the Stargate and other alien technology. Despite Apophis&#x27;s death in the beginning of Season 5, the Goa&#x27;uld Empire remains a major foe in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; until the end of Season 8. The only influential Goa&#x27;uld in the last two seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; is the System Lord Ba&#x27;al (Cliff Simon), who is defeated in the direct-to-DVD film &quot;&quot;.

=== Anubis Arc ===

After Apophis&#x27;s defeat in the Season 5 premiere (&quot;Enemies&quot;), the half-Ascended Goa&#x27;uld System Lord Anubis (David Palffy) assumes the role of the primary antagonist of the show. This new villain possesses much of the knowledge of the Ancients and their technology. While Earth builds its first interstellar spaceship (the &quot;Prometheus&quot;) in seasons Season 6 and Season 7, Anubis creates an army of almost invincible Kull Warriors and wipes out or subordinates most of his adversaries amongst the System Lords. In the Season 7 finale (&quot;Lost City&quot;), SG-1 discovers a powerful weapon in an Ancient outpost in Antarctica that annihilates Anubis&#x27;s entire fleet and also sets the stage for the spin-off series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Ba&#x27;al subsumes much of Anubis&#x27;s power in Season 8, while Anubis, who survived the destruction of his fleet in a disembodied form, quietly begins to re-assert his influence. Human-form Replicators begin to conquer the System Lords, but SG-1 finds and adjusts an Ancient weapon to destroy all Replicators throughout the galaxy. Near the end of Season 8 (&quot;Threads&quot;), it is revealed that the benevolent Ascended being Oma Desala (Mel Harris) is responsible for Anubis&#x27;s original ascension. When she engages Anubis in an eternal stalemated battle on the Ascended plane to prevent his acting on the mortal plane, the Replicators and most System Lords have already been annihilated and the Jaffa win their freedom from Goa&#x27;uld rule.

=== Ori Arc ===

The original SG-1 team disbands after the events of Season 8, but slowly reunites under new team leader Lt Col. Cameron Mitchell after the SGC inadvertently draws the attention of the Ori to the existence of sentient life in the Milky Way; the Ori are revealed to be a faction of ascended Ancients residing in another galaxy that are diametrically opposed to the Ancients&#x27; belief in strict noninterference in the lower planes of existence, sapping the energy from untold billions of &quot;lower beings&quot; (non-ascended sentient beings) by means of their worship in a religion called Origin. While the Ori send enhanced human beings named Priors to the Milky Way to convert the galaxy to Origin, Ba&#x27;al and some minor Goa&#x27;uld infiltrate Earth through &quot;The Trust&quot; (a coalition of rogue NID operatives) to rebuild their power. At the end of Season 9 (&quot;Camelot (Part 1)&quot;), the Ori begin an evangelistic crusade with their warships and effortlessly wipe out the combined fleet of Earth and its allies. The leader of the Ori, Adria (Morena Baccarin), is introduced in the premiere of Season 10 (&quot;Flesh and Blood (Part 2)&quot;). SG-1 searches for the Sangraal, an Ancient weapon that might defeat the Ori, while Ba&#x27;al and his clones attempt to find the weapon for their own purposes. With the help of the powerful Ancient Merlin (Matthew Walker), SG-1 finds the construction plans of the Sangraal and sends a working version to the Ori galaxy. Shortly thereafter, Adria ascends. The direct-to-DVD film &quot;&quot; ends the Ori Arc.

== Main cast and characters ==

* Richard Dean Anderson as Jonathan &quot;Jack&quot; O&#x27;Neill (Seasons 1–8 main, Seasons 9–10 guest) – A United States Air Force colonel and an Air Force Special Operations veteran who led the original mission through the Stargate in &quot;Stargate&quot; (where he was played by Kurt Russell). He is coaxed out of retirement in the pilot episode and serves as the leader of the SG-1 team in the first seven seasons. He takes charge of Stargate Command (SGC) after his promotion to brigadier general at the beginning of Season 8. The series repeatedly alludes to romantic feelings between O&#x27;Neill and his second-in-command, Carter, but the relationship is never shown as consummated outside alternate reality scenarios. O&#x27;Neill is reassigned to Washington, D.C. before Season 9 and receives a promotion to major general. He appears in a recurring role in Seasons 9 and 10 of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, as well as in &quot;Stargate: Continuum&quot; and in Seasons 1 and 3 of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. O&#x27;Neill appears as a lieutenant general in multiple episodes of &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; where he is in command of the Department of Homeworld Security.
* Michael Shanks as Daniel Jackson (Seasons 1–5 and 7–10 main, Season 6 recurring) – A brilliant Egyptologist whose far-fetched theories about Egyptian pyramids having been built by aliens led to his participation in the original Stargate mission in the feature film (where he was played by James Spader). He joins the SG-1 team to facilitate his search for his wife, who was kidnapped by Apophis in the pilot episode, but his naïveté and curiosity regularly create obstacles for the team. He gradually evolves from being an archaeologist and translator, into the moral conscience for the team, and remains part of SG-1 until he ascends to a higher plane of existence at the end of Season 5. Following his forced de-ascension at the beginning of Season 7, he rejoins SG-1 for the remainder of the series. The last three seasons show, he has a flirty, yet antagonistic relationship with Vala Mal Doran. Daniel also appears in both direct-to-DVD films, in Seasons 1 and 5 of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and in three &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; episodes.
* Amanda Tapping as Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Carter (Seasons 1–10 main) – A brilliant young astrophysicist and initially a United States Air Force captain, who joins SG-1 under the command of Colonel O&#x27;Neill in the pilot episode. Following her promotion to major in Season 3, she is promoted to lieutenant colonel early in Season 8 and assumes command of SG-1. Carter assists Lieutenant Colonel Cameron Mitchell in Seasons 9 and 10. After her appearance in &quot;Stargate: The Ark of Truth&quot;, she is promoted to full colonel and becomes the new commander of the Atlantis expedition in Season 4 of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;, before joining SG-1 again for &quot;Stargate: Continuum&quot;. Carter appears in a recurring role in all seasons of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; (and as a regular in Season 4) and in the first episode of &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; as commander of the starship &quot;George Hammond&quot;.
* Christopher Judge as Teal&#x27;c (Seasons 1–10 main) – A quiet and strong Jaffa alien who defects from his position as the First Prime of the Goa&#x27;uld Apophis. He joins SG-1 after the first episode, in hopes of leading his race to freedom. Despite achieving this goal at the end of Season 8, he remains a member of SG-1 until the end of the series. He also appears in both direct-to-DVD films and in Season 4 of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; as a mentor for Ronon Dex during an interview for the IOA.
* Don S. Davis as George Hammond (Seasons 1–7 main, Seasons 8–10 recurring) – A United States Air Force major general (later lieutenant general) who commands Stargate Command in the first seven seasons. Besides recurring in Seasons 8 through 10 of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, he appears in Season 1 of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Davis died from a heart attack in June 2008, making his appearance in &quot;Stargate: Continuum&quot; his last.
* Corin Nemec as Jonas Quinn (Season 6 main, Season 5 guest and 7 recurring) – A humanoid alien and scientist from the country of Kelowna on the planet Langara. Daniel sacrifices his life (leading to his ascension) at the end of Season 5 in an attempt to save Kelowna, but the following gleeful reaction of the Kelownan leaders causes Jonas to turn his back on Langara. Jonas is a fast learner and fills Daniel&#x27;s empty spot on SG-1 in Season 6. Following Daniel&#x27;s return, Jonas returns to his planet and remains a recurring character in Season 7.
* Ben Browder as Cameron &quot;Cam&quot; Mitchell (Seasons 9–10 main) – A United States Air Force lieutenant colonel who is assigned as the new commanding officer of SG-1 at the beginning of Season 9. He struggles to reunite its former members under his command and commands SG-1 (with Lieutenant Colonel Carter&#x27;s assistance) until the end of Season 10. He is promoted to full colonel between his appearances in &quot;Stargate: The Ark of Truth&quot; and &quot;Stargate: Continuum&quot;.
* Beau Bridges as Henry &quot;Hank&quot; Landry (Seasons 9–10 main) – A United States Air Force major general and the commander of Stargate Command in Seasons 9 and 10. He is the estranged father of the SGC&#x27;s medical officer Carolyn Lam and appears in both direct-to-DVD films and in Seasons 2 and 3 of &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. In Season 10, Episode 13 Hank Landry was President Of The United States, as well as Major General Hank Landry.
* Claudia Black as Vala Mal Doran (Season 10 main, Season 8 guest and 9 recurring) – A con artist from an unnamed planet and a former human host to the Goa&#x27;uld Qetesh. Her first appearance in Season 8&#x27;s &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot; is the beginning of her flirty yet antagonistic relationship with Daniel. In her recurring role in Season 9, she and Daniel unintentionally set off the new Ori threat. She is unwillingly impregnated by the Ori, gives birth to Adria and watches helplessly as Adria grows to adulthood in a few days time. She joins SG-1 after giving birth to the new leader of the Ori at the beginning of Season 10 and appears in both direct-to-DVD films.

== Production ==
=== Conception ===
Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner had worked together on the MGM television series &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; since 1995. Upon hearing of MGM&#x27;s plan to create a television spin-off series of the feature film &quot;Stargate&quot;, Wright and Glassner independently and unbeknownst to each other approached MGM and proposed their concept for the television series. MGM president John Symes greenlit the project on the condition that Wright and Glassner work together as executive producers of the new show. The show was named &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; after Wright flightily agreed to Symes&#x27;s pitch question of whether the team should be called &quot;SG-1&quot;. MGM released posters titled &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; within the next week without the knowledge of Wright or Glassner.

John Symes approached Michael Greenburg and Richard Dean Anderson, former star of the long-running &quot;MacGyver&quot;. Anderson agreed to become involved if his character Jack O&#x27;Neill were allowed more comedic leeway than Kurt Russell&#x27;s character in the feature film. He also requested that &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; be an ensemble show, so that he would not be carrying most of the plot alone as he had on &quot;MacGyver&quot;. The American subscription channel Showtime made a two-season commitment for 44 episodes in 1996. Principal photography began in Vancouver in February 1997.

=== Casting and cast changes ===
After Anderson accepted the part, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner reviewed several thousand taped auditions and invited approximately 25 promising actors to screen tests in Los Angeles. Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping and Christopher Judge are said to have gravitated towards each other during the casting process before they knew that they would ultimately be cast. The producers found Judge the easiest to cast due to his muscular presence. Shanks was cast because he did &quot;the perfect imitation of James Spader&quot;, according to Wright. The producers knew Don S. Davis from his work as a stand-in and stunt-double for Dana Elcar in &quot;MacGyver&quot; and approached him to read for the role of George Hammond.

Showtime&#x27;s announcement that it would not renew &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; after Season 5 coincided with Michael Shanks&#x27;s decision to leave the show over concerns of being underutilized. The Sci Fi Channel picked up the show and substituted a new character, played by Corin Nemec. Casting agents had met Nemec in the courtyard of MGM&#x27;s Santa Monica offices by chance and had offered him the role of Jonas Quinn. Addressing rumors that it had forced Shanks&#x27;s departure, Sci Fi said in February 2002 that the network had &quot;absolutely never requested that any cast changes be made... and although we regret the loss of Michael Shanks, we think that Corin Nemec will be a great new presence in the cast.&quot; Nemec&#x27;s early appearances, beginning with the penultimate episode of Season 5 &quot;Meridian&quot;, failed to win over some of the show&#x27;s fans. Nemec was willing to continue playing the character after Season 6 or in a feature film or a spin-off series. However, the producers reached an agreement with Shanks to return full-time in Season 7, leaving Nemec with a recurring role. Don S. Davis left &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; after Season 7 for health reasons, but appeared in a recurring capacity until his death on June 29, 2008.

Due to prior engagements, Claudia Black of &quot;Farscape&quot; fame could not accept the offers to guest-star on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; until the Season 8 episode &quot;Prometheus Unbound&quot;. The producers liked the on-screen chemistry between Black&#x27;s Vala Mal Doran and Shanks&#x27;s Daniel so much that they re-introduced her in a six-episode story Arc to cover for the maternity leave of Amanda Tapping at the beginning of Season 9. At the same time, Richard Dean Anderson left the show to spend more time with his daughter (his schedule had been reduced incrementally since Season 6). The role of the leading man was filled with Ben Browder (also of &quot;Farscape&quot; fame), who had met with the &quot;Stargate&quot; producers as soon as the introduction of new main characters for Season 9 was discussed. The producers had met him during sci-fi conventions and had previously discussed casting him in other &quot;Stargate&quot; roles. The producers approached Emmy Award-winning actor Beau Bridges directly to play the role of Hank Landry. Claudia Black&#x27;s guest appearances were so popular with the cast, crew and audience that the actress returned for the last two Season 9 episodes (with her pregnancy worked into the plot) and she joined the cast full-time in Season 10.

=== Crew ===

Most of the producers, crew members and guest actors involved in &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; were Canadian. Creators Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner were executive producers and show runners of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in the first three seasons, having the final say (besides MGM and the network) on stories, designs, effects, casting, editing and episode budgets. After Glassner&#x27;s departure, Wright ran &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; alone for three seasons. Executive producer Robert C. Cooper took over as show-runner in Season 7 when Brad Wright took time off to develop the spin-off series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Cooper and Wright remained show-runners of their respective shows until the end of &quot;SG-1&quot;. Also serving as executive and co-executive producers were Michael Greenburg and Richard Dean Anderson (Seasons 1–8), N. John Smith (Seasons 4–10) and the writer team Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie (Seasons 7–10).

Although &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; employed freelance writers, most of the 214 &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; episodes were written by Brad Wright (Seasons 1–10), Jonathan Glassner (Seasons 1–3), Katharyn Powers (Seasons 1–6), Robert C. Cooper (Seasons 1–10), Peter DeLuise (Seasons 4–8), Joseph Mallozzi &amp; Paul Mullie (Seasons 4–10), Damian Kindler (Seasons 6–10) and Alan McCullough (Seasons 9–10). Martin Wood and Peter DeLuise directed the most episodes, with 46 episodes (Seasons 1–10) and 57 episodes (Seasons 2–10), respectively. Wood and DeLuise regularly made cameo appearances in their episodes and notably played the show-within-a-show directors in the cameo-heavy milestone episodes &quot;Wormhole X-Treme!&quot; and &quot;200&quot;. Andy Mikita had been an assistant director since the pilot episode and directed 29 episodes from Season 3–10. &quot;SG-1&quot; director of photography Peter Woeste and camera operator William Waring directed 13 episodes each. Most staff writers and staff directors held producer positions. Several cast members also contributed story ideas and directed &quot;SG-1&quot; episodes.

=== Filming ===

&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was filmed in and around Vancouver, British Columbia, mainly at The Bridge Studios and NORCO Studios, which offered &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; tax breaks throughout its run. The cost of an &quot;SG-1&quot; episode increased from US$1.3 million in the first seasons to an estimated US$2 million per episode in Season 10, partly due to unfavorable exchange rates. Many Vancouver area landmarks were incorporated into the episodes, such as the campus of Simon Fraser University, which became the setting of the capital of the Tollan, an alien civilization. Production faced many weather problems because of the moderate oceanic climate of Vancouver, although rain could be eliminated from film. The Season 3 episode &quot;Crystal Skull&quot; was the first episode to be filmed on a virtual set.

The main setting of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, the fictional Stargate Command (SGC) at the (real) Cheyenne Mountain Air Force Station near Colorado Springs, Colorado, was filmed at stage 5 of The Bridge Studios. Martin Wood filmed half a dozen stock shots of the real Cheyenne Mountain complex for use in the series approximately ten days before the premiere of the pilot episode. Although these shots wore out over the years, the producers did not film new shots until the beginning of Season 9, thinking that &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; would be cancelled after each current year. By then, visitor questions and fan theories about the existence of a Stargate at the real Cheyenne Mountain complex had become so common that Cheyenne Mountain had installed a seemingly high-security door labeled &quot;Stargate Command&quot; for one of their storage rooms holding brooms and detergent.

The first seven seasons had 22 episodes each, which was reduced to 20 episodes for the last three seasons. Episodes of the first seasons were filmed over a period of 7.5 working days, which decreased to a targeted average of six working days in the last seasons. All episodes were filmed in 16:9 wide-screen, although &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was broadcast in 4:3 aspect ratio in its first years. The transition to the broadcast of episodes in the wider 16:9 ratio gave directors more freedom in frame composition. The first three seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; were filmed on 16 mm film, notwithstanding scenes involving visual effects that had always been shot on 35 mm film for various technical reasons. After a test run with the Season 3 finale, &quot;Nemesis&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; switched to 35 mm film for all purposes at the beginning of Season 4. Digital HD cameras were used for filming beginning with Season 8.

=== Production design ===

The art department generated all of the concepts and drawing for the prop department, the set decoration department, the construction department, the paint department and the model shop. They also collaborated with the visual effects department. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; employed about 200 Canadian union workers, although that number could exceed 300 when new sets were built. Lead production designer Richard Hudolin joined the project in October 1996. Bridget McGuire, &quot;SG-1&quot;″s art director since the pilot episode, took over as lead production designer in Season 6.

Hudolin flew to Los Angeles in 1996 to gather material from the feature film as reference and found the original Stargate prop stored outside in the Californian desert. Although the prop had severely deteriorated, he was able to take a detailed mold for &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; production to build its own prop. The new Stargate was engineered to turn, to lock the chevrons and to be computer-controlled to dial specific gate addresses. A portable Stargate prop was built for on-location shoots and required six workers and one full day to set up. Since visual effects are sometimes faster and cheaper, a computer-generated Stargate was occasionally used in on-location shoots in later seasons.

The SGC set had to be twice as high for shooting as the Stargate prop, but one of Hudolin&#x27;s original plans of a three-level set was rejected in favor of a two-level set. The gateroom was the biggest room on set and could be redesigned for other scenes. Two multi-purpose rooms were frequently redecorated into the infirmary, Daniel&#x27;s lab, the cafeteria or the gym. The SGC set and all other sets from the pilot episode were constructed within six weeks in January and February 1997, incorporating some original set pieces from the feature film. The SGC set would be largely dismantled in late 2008 to make room for the Icarus Base set of &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;.

=== Make-up and costumes ===
Most of the main &quot;SG-1&quot; characters are US airmen and wear authentic United States Air Force uniforms. During missions, the members of the SG-1 team normally wear olive green Battle Dress Uniforms. Richard Dean Anderson and Don S. Davis received a regular military-style haircut on set. Amanda Tapping had her hair comparably short until the filming of the direct-to-DVD films. Playing a civilian, Michael Shanks adopted James Spader&#x27;s hairstyle from the feature film but cut it short for the Season 2 finale and subsequent seasons. The Jaffa alien Teal&#x27;c (Christopher Judge) was the only main character whose look required more than basic make-up. His Egyptian look was reflective of the Goa&#x27;uld Ra from the feature film and was complemented with a forehead symbol and a gold skin tone, although his make-up process was simplified over the years. Judge shaved his head at home each day until the producers allowed him to let his hair grow in Season 8. As a trained nurse, key make-up artist Jan Newman could make burns, cuts, bruises and the SG-1 team&#x27;s other wounds look authentic.

For the look of aliens, the make-up department collaborated with prosthetics companies from Vancouver and Los Angeles, including Steve Johnson&#x27;s XFX (first three seasons only) &amp; Todd Masters. While the human origins of many alien races and human civilizations were left recognizable, the recurring characters who were members of the Unas race required elaborate prosthetics and make-up work. To convey the cultural origins of the various fictional human civilizations living on different planets after their displacement from Earth, the costume designers combined elements of their respective Earth cultures with modern fabrics, elaborate trims and chains to produce a historically rooted yet otherworldly appearance. The look of the Goa&#x27;uld such as Apophis was initially based on the look of Ra in the feature film. For the design of the Ori and the Priors in Season 9, the art department looked at Japanese and samurai garments for costume design. Art director James Robbins found the face painting, scarification and burns of remote jungle tribes mystical and these served as inspiration for the face scarification of the Priors and the Doci. Early ideas to include finger extensions and scarification on these characters&#x27; hands were discarded as impracticable.

=== Visual effects ===
&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was one of the biggest employers in the Vancouver visual effects market, spending $400,000 per episode. The largest role was played by Rainmaker Digital Effects, whose senior digital compositing artist, Bruce Woloshyn, worked approximately 10 months a year in close collaboration with &quot;SG-1&quot; visual effects supervisor/producer James Tichenor and visual effects supervisor Michelle Comens. Many companies were hired to create the Stargate&#x27;s water-like event horizon in the beginning, but Rainmaker eventually became the only company to create those visual effects. Rainmaker&#x27;s regular effects shots included the activation and use of the Stargate itself (with well over 300 event horizon shots in the first few years), the transport rings and the blast shots of the staff weapons and zat guns. They created the visual effects for Goa&#x27;uld cargo ships and death gliders on a less regular basis.

Lost Boys Studios provided visual effects for &quot;SG-1&quot; from the very beginning of the series up to the end of Season 5, and Image Engine worked on the show from Season 2. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; were responsible for an estimated 30% to 40% of the business of Atmosphere Visual Effects. James Tichenor considered the few episodes with big visual effects budgets the most likely works to contain visual cues that would impress award judges. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; helped win the local post production shops industry recognition, with Season 4&#x27;s &quot;Small Victories&quot;, Season 5&#x27;s &quot;Revelations&quot; and Season 7&#x27;s &quot;Lost City&quot; receiving the most visual effects awards and nominations &quot;(see List of awards and nominations received by Stargate SG-1)&quot;.

=== Music ===
According to composer Joel Goldsmith, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; had a traditional action-adventure score, &quot;with a sci-fi, fantasy flair&quot; that goes &quot;from comedy to drama to wondrous to suspense to heavy action to ethereal&quot;. Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner had known Goldsmith since the second season of &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; before they approached him to work on the pilot episode of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;. Goldsmith and David Arnold, the composer of the original feature film score, discussed themes for a television adaptation. The main titles of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; were a medley of several themes from the feature film, although Goldsmith also wrote a unique end title for &quot;SG-1&quot; to establish the show as its own entity. MGM eventually insisted on using Arnold&#x27;s score in the pilot episode instead of Goldsmith&#x27;s, but Brad Wright&#x27;s 2009 direct-to-DVD recut of &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; uses Goldsmith&#x27;s original score.

For each episode&#x27;s score, Goldsmith simulated a real orchestra with a synthesizer palette of an eighty-piece symphony orchestra for budgetary reasons, although he occasionally used two or three musicians for added orchestral authenticity. Goldsmith&#x27;s long-time assistant Neal Acree started composing additional music for &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in Season 8. The amount of composed music varied between 12 and 33 minutes out of a 44-minute episode, with an average of around 22 to 26 minutes, making the full symphonic score of &quot;SG-1&quot; more time-consuming to create than for general TV shows. Since Goldsmith lived a thousand miles away from Vancouver, he and the producers discussed ideas over the phone and exchanged tapes via Federal Express for several years until the show switched to Internet file transfers.

Goldsmith&#x27;s reliance on Arnold&#x27;s score decreased over the seasons when &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; departed from the Goa&#x27;uld theme and introduced new characters and races. Goldsmith had a thematic approach to races and spaceships. For example, he wanted a mechanical, repetitive musical motif for the Replicators; Gothic, Gregorian and Christian themes were the inspiration for the Ori motif. The Ancient theme was deliberately carried over to &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. The end of &quot;Lost City&quot; has a basic melody that would become part of the main title of &quot;Atlantis&quot; per a suggestion by Goldsmith&#x27;s assistant. Non-original music was rarely used on &quot;SG-1&quot;, although Goldsmith chose the aria &quot;Vesti la giubba&quot; from Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot; for season 3&#x27;s &quot;Shades of Grey&quot;. Additionally, Lily Frost&#x27;s song &quot;Who am I&quot; played in Season 7&#x27;s &quot;Fragile Balance&quot; and CCR&#x27;s song &quot;Have You Ever Seen the Rain?&quot; played in the series finale &quot;Unending&quot;. A television soundtrack with Goldsmith&#x27;s adapted score was released in 1997, followed by a best-of release in 2001. In Season 1 Episode 7, &quot;The Nox&quot;, the music that played when The Nox appeared was Spinning The Silk from the album Chrysalis by 2002.

=== Opening title sequence ===
&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; has had several opening title sequences, which are generally preceded by a teaser act. The credits are normally sixty seconds long. Richard Dean Anderson was the only &quot;SG-1&quot; actor whose name appeared before the show&#x27;s title. Michael Shanks&#x27; name was moved near the end of the opening credits with the appendage &quot;as Daniel Jackson&quot; after his return to the show in Season 7. Some DVD versions of early &quot;SG-1&quot; seasons have different opening credits from the television versions, as do the direct-to-DVD films. Composer Joel Goldsmith adapted David Arnold&#x27;s &quot;Stargate&quot; feature film score for &quot;SG-1&quot;″s opening title theme, which remained the same during the run of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and its direct-to-DVD films.
The first opening title sequence, used in the first five seasons, shows a slow-pan camera move over Ra&#x27;s mask. The &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; producers had run out of time before the premiere of Season 1 and simply re-used the accelerated opening title sequence of the feature film. Ra&#x27;s mask had been created in the feature film&#x27;s model shop and had originally been filmed with a motion-control camera. Partly because Ra&#x27;s mask looked cross-eyed, Brad Wright approached the art department in the following years to produce a new opening title sequence; however, the sequence remained the same until the show&#x27;s move to the Sci-Fi Channel. During the first five seasons when the show was syndicated, a separate introduction was used; this intro is still used by Sci-Fi for Seasons 1–5. This version uses action shots of the original cast.

The opening title sequence of the first two Season 6 episodes shows a turning Stargate, for which a Frazier lens was put as close as to the Stargate prop. The opening credits of the following episodes intercut this material with live-action shots of the characters from previous seasons and ended with the SG-1 team stepping through the Stargate. The opening credits stayed the same in the next two seasons except for minor clip and cast changes. The opening credits of Season 9 intercut shots of the Stargate with action sequences similar to the previous opening credits, although the Stargate was visibly computer-generated. The Sci Fi Channel cut the opening credits from sixty to ten seconds in their original broadcast of the first half of Season 9, but reinstated the full opening credits after strongly negative fan reactions. The writers poked fun at this move in &quot;SG-1&quot;″s milestone episode &quot;200&quot; in Season 10, showing a five-second clip instead of the full titles. Beginning with Season 10&#x27;s &quot;Company of Thieves&quot;, the last clip of the opening credits shows Vala Mal Doran almost missing SG-1&#x27;s trip through the Stargate.

=== Collaboration with the military ===

The U.S. Department of the Air Force, through the Air Force Office of Public Affairs, Entertainment Liaison in Los Angeles, co-operated closely with the &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; producers. Before the beginning of the series, the Air Force granted production access to the Cheyenne Mountain complex to film stock shots. They also read every script for mistakes and provided help with plausible background stories for all characters, ribbons, uniform regulations, hair advice, plot lines and military relationships and decorum on an active military base. The USAF flew up several T-38 Talon, F-15 and F-16 fighter jets to Vancouver for various episodes and direct-to-DVD films. Many of the extras portraying USAF personnel were real USAF staff.

Two successive Chiefs of Staff of the Air Force, Generals Michael E. Ryan and John P. Jumper, appeared as themselves in Season 4&#x27;s &quot;Prodigy&quot; and Season 7&#x27;s &quot;Lost City&quot;, respectively. General Jumper&#x27;s second scheduled appearance in Season 9&#x27;s &quot;The Fourth Horseman&quot; was cancelled due to ongoing real-world conflicts in the Middle East. The Air Force Association recognized Richard Dean Anderson at its 57th annual dinner on September 14, 2004, for his work as actor and executive producer of the show and for the show&#x27;s positive depiction of the United States Air Force. General Jumper made Anderson an honorary brigadier general, matching his on-screen promotion to that rank.

Several scenes of Season 4&#x27;s &quot;Small Victories&quot; were filmed aboard and outside a decommissioned Russian &quot;Foxtrot&quot;-class submarine, which had been brought from Vladivostok to Vancouver by a private owner. The United States Navy invited the cast and producers to film aboard the nuclear submarine and at their Applied Physics Laboratory Ice Station in the Arctic for the direct-to-DVD sequel &quot;&quot;.

== Themes and allusions ==
&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; takes place in a military science fiction environment and employs the common science fiction concepts of strongly differentiated characters fighting an unequivocally evil enemy (the Goa&#x27;uld). However, it links alien races with well-known Earth mythologies, by use of the central Stargate device. Near-instantaneous interplanetary travel allows quick narrative shifts between the politics on Earth and the realities of fighting an interstellar war. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; gradually evolves the basic premise of the &quot;Stargate&quot; film into its own unique mythological superstructure, expanding upon Egyptian mythology (notably the gods Apep/Apophis and Anubis as Goa&#x27;uld villains), Norse mythology (notably the god Thor as an Asgard ally) and Arthurian legend (notably Merlin as an Ancient ally against the god-like Ori), among others. &quot;SG-1&quot; introduces new alien races (as opposed to alien human civilizations) less often than other science fiction television series and integrates newly encountered races or visited planets in stand-alone episodes into its established mythology while leaving the plotlines accessible for new audience members. Despite the show&#x27;s extensive intergalactic mythology and science fiction elements, scholar M. Keith Booker considered &quot;SG-1&quot; ultimately character-driven and heavily dependent on the camaraderie among the SG-1 members.

The producers embraced humor and wanted &quot;SG-1&quot; to be a fun show that did not take itself too seriously. Brad Wright regarded &quot;SG-1&quot; as a family show with adequate violence as opposed to random or gratuitous violence. Christopher Judge did not consider &quot;SG-1&quot; as a &quot;message show by any stretch of the imagination, but occasionally there are messages there&quot;. Aimed at a popular audience, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; emphasized its present-day-Earth story frame by frequently referring to popular culture, like &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; had done before. Jonathan Glassner had written &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; references into his own scripts since the first season, which the other writers imitated after Richard Dean Anderson began referring to the film on his own. O&#x27;Neill refers to Richard Dean Anderson&#x27;s favorite television series, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, throughout the show. &quot;SG-1&quot; makes meta-textual references to the process of writing and filming a science fiction TV series in several episodes and alludes to the main actors&#x27; previous TV roles in the pilot episode (Carter: &quot;It took us fifteen years and three supercomputers to MacGyver a system for the gate on Earth&quot;) and in a &quot;Farscape&quot; vignette in the milestone episode &quot;200&quot;.

== Broadcast and release ==
=== Showtime and US syndication (1997–2002) ===
The American subscription channel Showtime ordered the first two seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; with 44 episodes total in 1996. The two-hour pilot episode received Showtime&#x27;s highest-ever ratings for a series premiere with an audience of approximately 1.5 million households in the 8 p.m. Sunday slot of July 27, 1997. According to the &quot;SG-1&quot; producers, a broadcast network would have cancelled &quot;SG-1&quot; after a few episodes, but Showtime put no pressure on the show to &quot;deliver the meteoric ratings the way network shows do&quot;. The show was consistently the channel&#x27;s most-watched program (including theatrical movies), so Showtime ordered a third and fourth season of 22 episodes each in July 1998.

Since &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was expensive to produce, MGM arranged an agreement with Showtime that &quot;SG-1&quot; could air in syndication six months after their premiere on Showtime. All 22 FOX owned-and-operated local stations aired the first seasons after their Showtime debut, providing a clearance of 41% of the United States. The show was also available on non-FOX affiliated stations in other markets.

The Sci Fi Channel made its largest single programming acquisition of $150 million in 1998 by buying the exclusive basic cable rights to the MGM package &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Showtime decided to end its association with &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; at the end of Season 5, saying that the show still had a sizeable viewership but could no longer draw new subscribers due to its availability in syndication.

=== Sci Fi Channel and US syndication (2002–2007) ===
Since &quot;SG-1&quot; ratings were good from a financial standpoint, the Sci Fi Channel picked up MGM&#x27;s offer to continue the show into a sixth season, yet with a slightly reduced budget. Sci Fi aired new episodes of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in the 9 p.m. Friday slot between &quot;The Dead Zone&quot; and &quot;Farscape&quot;, while it aired older &quot;SG-1&quot; episodes in a four-hour block every Monday at 7 p.m. Episodes were broadcast in US syndication six months after their premiere on Sci Fi. The sixth season was supposed to be the show&#x27;s last, but Sci Fi renewed &quot;SG-1&quot; at the last minute. The sixth and seventh seasons made &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; Sci Fi&#x27;s highest-rated original series with an average of 2 million viewers in over 1.3 million households, elevating Sci Fi into the top 10 cable networks in the United States. For the next few years, the producers believed each current season to be the show&#x27;s last and repeatedly wrote big series finales, but the success of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; put off their plans of ending the show to write a new &quot;Stargate&quot; feature film. Sci Fi cut the length of an &quot;SG-1&quot; season from 22 to 20 episodes from Season 8 onwards.

Originally envisioned as a replacement for &quot;SG-1&quot;, the spin-off series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; began airing in tandem with &quot;SG-1&quot; eighth season in summer 2004, setting a series record of 3.2 million viewers for &quot;SG-1&quot; and a Sci Fi record as most-watched episode of a regular series ever (at the time) for &quot;Atlantis&quot; with 4.2 million viewers. &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; joined the two &quot;Stargate&quot; series in January 2005, making Sci Fi the leader among basic cablers on Friday nights over the summer of 2005. The producers considered replacing &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; with a new show named &quot;Stargate Command&quot; after &quot;SG-1&quot;″s eighth season, but the Sci Fi Channel decided to continue &quot;SG-1&quot; with a slightly changed cast for a ninth season instead. Season 9&#x27;s average slipped from 2.4 million viewers in late 2005 to 2.1 million viewers with 1.8 household rating during early 2006, which Sci Fi&#x27;s Mark Stern attributed to the &quot;tech-savvy, toy-loving, time-shifting audience&quot; whose use of digital video recorders excluded them in ratings compilations. Meanwhile, the decline of &quot;SG-1&quot; 2005–2006 syndication household ratings was consistent with the overall decline in syndicated sci-fi action hours. Sci Fi ordered a record-breaking tenth season of &quot;SG-1&quot; in 2005, but announced it would not renew the show for an eleventh season in summer 2006 &quot;(see Cancellation and future)&quot;. The final &quot;SG-1&quot; episode, &quot;Unending&quot;, premiered on Sky1 in the UK on March 13, 2007, and attracted approximately 2.2 million viewers on the Sci Fi Channel on June 22, 2007.

=== International broadcast ===
According to Wright and Cooper, the worldwide popularity of science fiction was a factor in &quot;SG-1&quot; success and the good international reception helped keep the series on the air in the beginning. Several newspapers reported in 2005–2006 that &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; aired in over 100 countries with a weekly worldwide viewership of around 10 million, but &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave different numbers in 2004, saying that the show was broadcast in sixty-four countries with more than 17 million viewers a week. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; had a particularly fervent response in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Australia.

&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; aired in the United Kingdom on Sky One with repeats on Sky Two, Sky Mix, Sky Max, Sky Sci-Fi, and Channel 4. Sky One broadcast new episodes of the second half of most seasons before their American premiere. Brad Wright found it &quot;almost embarrassing&quot; that &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was much more popular in the United Kingdom than in Canada, where the show aired on Space, Citytv, A-Channel, Movie Central and French-language channels TQS and Ztélé. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; aired in Australia on Sci Fi Australia and Channel Seven. It aired in India on STAR World India and in Israel on Channel 1.

=== Cancellation and future ===
On August 21, 2006, a few days after the premiere of &quot;SG-1&quot; milestone episode &quot;200&quot;, the Sci Fi Channel confirmed that &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was not being renewed for an 11th season. While news outlets cited declining ratings, expensive production and lack of promotion as possible reasons for the cancellation, the Sci Fi Channel&#x27;s Mark Stern merely stated the decision was not ratings-based. Instead, he said the production staff was given enough time to tie up all the loose ends of the story and &quot;SG-1&quot; cast members were planned to be incorporated into the renewed &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot;. Meanwhile, the &quot;SG-1&quot; producers and rights-holder MGM expressed a desire to continue &quot;SG-1&quot; as a movie, mini-series, or an eleventh season on another network. Brad Wright confirmed the production of two direct-to-DVD films in October 2006, and Amanda Tapping joined the &quot;Atlantis&quot; cast for their fourth season. The first film, &quot;&quot;, was released in March 2008 and wraps up the Ori storyline. The second film, &quot;&quot;, is an alternate time-line time travel story and was released in July 2008. A special edition of the two-hour pilot episode &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; with re-edited scenes and a different score has also been produced.

In April 2009, MGM confirmed a third new &quot;SG-1&quot; film that Brad Wright had first announced in May 2008. Joseph Mallozzi revealed the working title as &quot;Stargate: Revolution&quot;. The film was planned to be written by Wright and former &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; executive producer Carl Binder. Martin Wood would serve as director. The premise of the film would have been the &quot;possibility of the Stargate program going public&quot;. According to Wright, the film would center on the Jack O&#x27;Neill character and would reunite as many of the &quot;SG-1&quot; cast as possible, depending on the cost of the film and actor availability. The character of Vala Mal Doran would not appear in the film. Amanda Tapping confirmed her appearance in this &quot;SG-1&quot; film and the first &quot;Atlantis&quot; movie in September 2008, and Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) confirmed his and Richard Dean Anderson&#x27;s participation in January 2009. No contracts had been signed by April 2009, but Wright stated that he &quot;can almost guarantee we are proceeding with the &quot;SG-1&quot; movie this year [2009]&quot;. Nevertheless, production was put on hold. Wright explained that the late-2000s recession made DVD premieres less lucrative for MGM than in the years before, and he also pointed to the financial crisis of MGM as reason for the delay. Wright and Joe Mallozzi expressed optimism that production would eventually start, until Wright announced in April 2011 that the &quot;SG-1&quot; film project was permanently shelved, along with plans for future &quot;Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot; films and a cross-over film incorporating elements from all three series. By then, neither the &quot;Atlantis&quot; nor &quot;Universe&quot; television series were produced anymore. Still, Wright did not rule out future &quot;Stargate&quot; films, saying; &quot;It&#x27;s a franchise. &quot;Stargate&quot; is not over. Somebody smart from MGM is going to figure it out and something will happen.&quot;

=== Home media ===

&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was first released on DVD in some European nations in volumes of typically four episodes each, beginning with &quot;The Best of Season 1&quot; as Volume 1 in the United Kingdom in 2000. Each following season was released as six individual volumes (except Season 10 with five volumes), beginning with the first four episodes of Season 2. In 2000, the series was first released in the United States on DVD with only three episodes. The following year, Seasons 1–8 were released in five-disc amaray box sets in the United States. MGM Home Entertainment (Europe) began releasing complete season box sets (including Season 1) alongside the individual volumes in 2002. The British season box sets were usually released half a year after a season&#x27;s last volume release in the UK. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was also released in DVD season box sets in Australia.

Most DVDs contain behind-the-scenes features, audio commentaries for nearly all episodes beginning with Season 4 and production galleries. The box sets of the first eight seasons were re-released with slim packaging in all regions, beginning in the United States in summer 2006. A complete series set was first released in the United States in October 2007, containing 50 discs from the ten seasons of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and four bonus discs with content not part of the original sets. More than 30 million copies of DVDs had been sold by 2006.

On June 15, 2020, Visual Entertainment re-released the complete series, without the films, on DVD. On December 18, 2020, the company released the entire series, again without the films, on Region A Blu-ray.

=== Online distribution ===
New episodes of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; were first released on iTunes in the US in August 2006, each time one day after their premiere on the Sci Fi Channel. The commercial-free episodes were priced $1.99 each, while a season pass with twenty episodes cost $37.99. A release on iTunes UK followed in October 2007. All ten seasons of &quot;SG-1&quot; were available on iTunes and Amazon Unbox by January 2008. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; made its debut on hulu.com in March 2009, starting with the first season. At first, viewers in the United States could only watch episodes of the first seasons, but all episodes of Seasons 1–10 were available free of charge with a small number of commercials on Hulu, through January 31, 2011. Free access to all SG-1 episodes continued until July 31, 2011, when the episodes were finally removed. , all episodes of the entire Stargate franchise were available on Netflix&#x27;s subscription-based online video streaming service in the US. Netflix removed Stargate SG-1 from its online video streaming service. , Amazon Video has Stargate SG-1 available for online streaming. SG-1 is available on Netflix UK. The pilot episode &quot;Children Of The Gods&quot; though has been replaced with the 2009 updated final cut with updated CGI and the full frontal nudity removed. , Hoopla Digital, an online library media database, has all ten seasons of Stargate SG-1 available to watch free without commercials, for those who have cards with a participating library. The first two episodes are the edited versions, in which full frontal nudity has been removed. In September 2017, MGM launched its own online streaming service called Stargate Command, making available all episodes of Stargate SG-1 along with Stargate Atlantis and Stargate Universe. The show returned to Netflix in the United States on December 1, 2020, with a TV-MA rating because of the full frontal nudity in the first episode.

The series currently airs on the Comet digital network.

== Influence ==

=== Critical reception ===
&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, particularly during earlier seasons, did very little to attract much in the way of attention from the mainstream media. The show&#x27;s July 1997 pilot, &quot;Children of the Gods&quot; received mixed responses from publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Variety&quot;. While there was only passing interest from mainstream publications, science fiction publications such as &quot;Starburst&quot;, &quot;Cult Times&quot; and &quot;TV Zone&quot; regularly reviewed and featured &quot;SG-1&quot;. Sharon Eberson of the &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot;, wrote that &quot;&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;&#x27;s place in the sci-fi universe can be measured in longevity, spot-on cast chemistry, rabid fans who call themselves Gaters and the tough subjects it has tackled&quot;, going on to note that the show &quot;had rarely been a critical darling&quot;.

Despite the lukewarm reaction to the pilot, various critics and publications later recognized that &quot;SG-1&quot; had surpassed the 1994 film on which it was based. Writing for The Guardian in 2009, Emily Wilson labeled the original film &quot;pretty dire&quot;, believing that the series had far outshined it. Wilson appreciatively teased &quot;SG-1&quot;&#x27;s format of visiting &quot;slightly&quot; different, English speaking alien worlds, with similar caves and studio-flat floors, writing that &quot;what makes it good are the jokes, the actors, and the great ideas the writers keep throwing out&quot;. &quot;What Culture&quot; believed &quot;SG-1&quot; to be the best entry into the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise, surpassing both the film and spinoff series, putting it #10 on their 25 Greatest Sci Fi TV Shows of All Time list.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the series &quot;one of the unlikeliest success stories in sci-fi TV history&quot;, ranking it #36 on their 50 Greatest Sci-Fi Series of All Time list. &quot;SyFy Wire&quot; described the show as &quot;sci-fi comfort food in the best possible way&quot; comparing the way the show examined morality to that of &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, placing the show 20th on their Greatest Sci-Fi TV Series of the Past 25 Years list. In 2003, after spinoff series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; was greenlit, &quot;SG-1&quot; enjoyed more mainstream exposure. The July issue of &quot;TV Guide&quot; proclaimed on the front cover &quot;Forget &quot;Trek&quot;! &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; is now sci-fi&#x27;s biggest hit!&quot;.

In the show&#x27;s later seasons, it was broadcast on the Sci-Fi Channel on the same night as the 2004 reimagining of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. &quot;Galactica&quot; was critically acclaimed for its dramatic, often dark, take on science fiction television. &quot;People&quot; called Stargate SG-1 &quot;the anti-Battlestar Galactica&quot;, praising it for being accessible, comforting and captivating. According to Melanie McFarland of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;, &quot;SG-1&quot; records did not earn it &quot;the kind of wide-ranging respect a successful series with a 200-episode run deserves&quot;; &quot;SG-1&quot; rarely occupied a slot on &#x27;best show&#x27; lists because the show remained &quot;relegated to the back of the bus in terms of popularity&quot; behind the glory of &quot;Galactica&quot;, although every week, the show attracted an average of 10 million viewers worldwide. &quot;IndieWire&quot; lauded the series for its camp, self-aware style, calling this &quot;its saving grace compared to other excellent, but heavy sci-fi series like &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;&quot;, ranking the show #18 on their list of the 20 Best TV Shows Based on Movies of all time.

The show has also gone on to be featured on various lists of works considered the best. In 2019, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; ranked &quot;Stargate: SG-1&quot; the 14th best science fiction television show ever. &quot;Insider&quot; included the show in their The 19 Best Sci-fi Shows of All Time. &quot;Goliath&quot; ranked &quot;SG-1&quot; #10 in their 15 Favorite Sci-Fi Shows of All Time. &quot;Paste&quot; ranked it #24 out of 100 on their 2017 list of Greatest Sci-fi television. &quot;ShortList&quot; included SG-1 in their 15 Best Sci-Fi TV shows list. In 2011, &quot;IGN&quot; ranked it #19 in their Top 50 Sci Fi Shows of All Time. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; ranked #28 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Top Cult Shows Ever. In 2005, &quot;SG-1&quot; and &quot;Atlantis&quot; shared the number four spot in a poll about the &quot;most popular cult TV shows&quot; on the British &quot;Cult TV&quot; website. &quot;SG-1&quot; was also included in the list of &quot;17 All-Time Great Cult TV Shows You Say We Missed&quot; by &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; in 2009. In a &quot;Digital Spy&quot; user poll, the show ranked as the 4th Greatest Sci-fi show of all time. &quot;Amazon Prime&quot; also conducted a user-poll in 2019, with the show voted the 3rd Greatest Sci-Fi of all Time.

=== Awards and nominations ===

&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was nominated for numerous awards during its ten-season run. Its nominations for seven Emmys in the &quot;Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series&quot; category and one Emmy for &quot;Outstanding Music Composition for a Series (Dramatic Underscore)&quot; did not result in a win. &quot;SG-1&quot; won two Gemini Awards, twelve Leo Awards and five Saturn Awards out of over thirty nominations each. &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; was also nominated for two VES Awards in 2003 and 2005 and for two Hugo Awards in 2005 and 2007.

=== Fandom ===
Brad Wright used the term &quot;Gaters&quot; to refer to fans of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; in 2001, but the term did not become widespread. Some fans&#x27; belief that there was a real Stargate device under Cheyenne Mountain inspired writers Joseph Mallozzi and Paul Mullie to come up with their own conspiracy story for Season 4&#x27;s &quot;Point of No Return&quot;. The fansite GateWorld became a major franchise news site with special arrangements with MGM; GateWorld&#x27;s founder Darren Sumner was later hired to serve as a news editor for the official &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; magazine and to check &quot;Stargate&quot; comic books for continuity errors with the TV shows before publication. &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; graphic designer Pierre Bernard gained notoriety among &quot;Stargate&quot; fans for devoting several of his &quot;Recliner of Rage&quot; &quot;Late Night&quot; segments to &quot;SG-1&quot;. The producers invited him to make cameo appearances in the episodes &quot;Zero Hour&quot; and &quot;200&quot;.

Established in 2000, Gatecon is the world&#x27;s longest-running &quot;SG-1&quot; fan convention. It is held in the Vancouver area, (plus two in the UK), with more actor and crew member participation than other conventions. &quot;SG-1&quot; conventions by Creation Entertainment were also marketed as &quot;The Official &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; Tour&quot;, which mostly took place in the United States until Creation Entertainment acquired the license for Vancouver conventions in 2005. Wolf Events organized many &quot;SG-1&quot; conventions in Europe, particularly in the UK and Germany.

=== Merchandise ===

&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; spawned an industry of spin-off products. From 1999 to 2001, ROC published four &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; novels written by Ashley McConnell. In 2004, UK-based Fandemonium Press launched a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot;, although these books were unavailable in North America until 2006 when the license conflict with ROC expired. Titan Publishing publishes the official &quot;Stargate Magazine&quot;, while Avatar Press published a series of &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; comics. British company Big Finish Productions began to produce &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; audio adventures in early 2008, voiced by members of the &quot;SG-1&quot; cast. A &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; roleplaying game and a &quot;Stargate&quot; trading card game were released in 2003 and 2007. Diamond Select Toys and Hasbro launched a series of toys in 2005 and 2006, respectively. The planned video game &quot;Stargate SG-1: The Alliance&quot; was cancelled in 2005 and the futures of the MMORPG &quot;Stargate Worlds&quot; and the Third Person Shooter from the same studio (Cheyenne Mountain Entertainment) named &quot;Stargate Resistance&quot; were made clear in November 2010 following MGM&#x27;s decision not to renew CME&#x27;s Stargate license. Four amusement rides are based on &quot;Stargate&quot; – the Stargate SG-3000 theme park ride operating at Space Park Bremen in Germany and at Six Flags theme parks in Chicago, San Francisco and Louisville.

=== Legacy ===

&quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; spawned the animated &quot;Stargate Infinity&quot;, and the live-action spin-off TV series&#x27; &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; and &quot;Stargate Universe&quot;. By &quot;SG-1&quot; tenth season in 2006, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; were said to have brought US$500 million in production to British Columbia. MGM executive vice president Charles Cohen described &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; and its spinoff series as the television counterpart of their &quot;James Bond&quot; franchise, being very profitable and improving their image.

According to Stan Beeler and Lisa Dickson in their 2005 book &quot;Reading Stargate SG-1&quot;, the only science fiction shows to exceed the staying power of &quot;SG-1&quot; are &quot;Doctor Who&quot; and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; franchise, although &quot;The X-Files&quot; and &quot;Buffy&quot;/&quot;Angel&quot; might have comparable longevity. Brad Wright cited continuity in the creative team and fan loyalty as reasons for the show&#x27;s longevity. With its 202nd episode, &quot;Company of Thieves&quot;, &quot;Stargate SG-1&quot; surpassed &quot;The X-Files&quot; as the longest-running North American science fiction series on television, until passed by the final season of &quot;Smallville&quot; in 2011, which was in turn passed by the eleventh season revival of &quot;The X-Files&quot; in 2018. &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fans dispute &quot;SG-1&quot; listing in the 2007 &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; as the &quot;longest-running science fiction show (consecutive)&quot;, as 695 episodes of the British show were produced but not shown consecutively between 1963 and 1989. Scott D. Pierce from &quot;Deseret News&quot; said that the series never made a &quot;sort of cultural impact&quot; as &quot;Star Trek&quot; because the show was &quot;pretty derivative&quot; which he further stated it became &quot;more so over the years.&quot;

The astronomers David J. Tholen and Roy A. Tucker enjoyed the &quot;SG-1&quot; arch villain Apophis so much that they named their discovered near-Earth asteroid &quot;99942 Apophis&quot;.

Reflecting on &quot;SG-1&quot; in 2020, Dean Devlin, co-creator of the 1994 original film, recalled that initially he had been very hostile to the series, likening his experience of it to &quot;watching someone else raising your child&quot; and pointing out that the full-frontal nudity featured in the pilot episode was not what he thought Stargate should be about. But he had come to believe, he said, that the passion of &quot;SG-1&quot;&#x27;s fanbase reflected the fact that Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner had created a really good show, thus reaching out to Glassner for the first time.
