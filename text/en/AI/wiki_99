<text>Led Zeppelin (sometimes referred to as Led Zeppelin I) is the debut studio album by the English rock band Led Zeppelin. It was released on 13 January 1969 in the United States and on 31 March 1969 in the United Kingdom by Atlantic Records.

The album was recorded in September and October 1968 at Olympic Studios in London, shortly after the band&#x27;s formation. It contains a mix of original material worked out in the first rehearsals, and remakes and rearrangements of contemporary blues and folk songs. The sessions took place before the group had secured a recording contract and totalled 36 hours; they were paid for directly by Jimmy Page, the group&#x27;s founder, leader and guitarist, and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s manager Peter Grant, costing £1,782 () to complete. They were produced by Page, who as a musician was joined by band members Robert Plant (lead vocals, harmonica), John Paul Jones (bass, keyboards), and John Bonham (drums). Percussionist Viram Jasani appears as a guest on one track. The tracks were mixed by Page&#x27;s childhood friend Glyn Johns, and the iconic album cover showing the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; disaster was designed by George Hardie.

&quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; showcased the group&#x27;s fusion of blues and rock, and their take on the emerging hard rock sound was immediately commercially successful in both the UK and US, reaching the top 10 on album charts in both countries, as well as several others. Many of the songs were longer and not well suited to be released as singles for radio airplay; Page was reluctant to release &quot;singles&quot;, so only &quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot;, backed with &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, was released outside of the UK. However, due to exposure on album-oriented rock radio stations, and growth in popularity of the band, many of the album&#x27;s songs have become classic rock radio staples.

==Background==
In July 1968, the English rock band the Yardbirds disbanded after two founder members Keith Relf and Jim McCarty quit the group to form the band Renaissance, with a third, Chris Dreja, leaving to become a photographer shortly afterwards. The fourth member, guitarist Jimmy Page, was left with rights to the name and contractual obligations for a series of concerts in Scandinavia. Page asked seasoned session player and arranger John Paul Jones to join as bassist, and hoped to recruit Terry Reid as singer and Procol Harum&#x27;s B. J. Wilson as drummer. Wilson was still committed to Procol Harum, and Reid declined to join but recommended Robert Plant, who met with Page at his boathouse in Pangbourne, Berkshire in August to talk about music and work on new material.

Page and Plant realised they had good musical chemistry together, and Plant asked friend and Band of Joy bandmate John Bonham to drum for the new group. The line-up of Page, Plant, Jones and Bonham first rehearsed on 19 August 1968 (the day before Plant&#x27;s 20th birthday), shortly before a tour of Scandinavia as &quot;the New Yardbirds&quot;, performing some old Yardbirds material as well as new songs such as &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t Quit You Baby&quot;, &quot;You Shook Me&quot;, &quot;Babe I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot; and &quot;How Many More Times&quot;. After they returned to London following the tour, Page changed the band&#x27;s name to Led Zeppelin, and the group entered Olympic Studios at 11 p.m. on 25 September 1968 to record their debut album.

== Recording ==
Page said that the album took only about 36 hours of studio time (over a span of a few weeks) to create (including mixing), adding that he knew this because of the amount charged on the studio bill. One of the primary reasons for the short recording time was that the material selected for the album had been well-rehearsed and pre-arranged by the band on the Scandinavian tour.

The band had not yet signed a deal, and there was no record company money to waste on excessive studio time. Page and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s manager Peter Grant paid for the sessions themselves. The reported total studio costs were £1,782. The self-funding was important because it meant they could record exactly what they wanted without record company interference.

For the recordings Page played a psychedelically painted Fender Telecaster – a gift from friend Jeff Beck after Page recommended him to join the Yardbirds in 1965, replacing Eric Clapton on lead guitar. Page played the Telecaster through a Supro amplifier, and used a Gibson J-200 for the album&#x27;s acoustic tracks. For &quot;Your Time Is Gonna Come&quot; he used a Fender 10-string pedal steel guitar.

=== Production ===
&quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; was engineered by Glyn Johns and produced by Page and Johns (Johns is uncredited on the album cover). The two had known each other since they were teenagers in the suburb of Epsom. According to Page, most of the album was recorded live, with overdubs added later.

Page used a &quot;distance makes depth&quot; approach to production. He used natural room ambience to enhance the reverb and recording texture on the record, demonstrating the innovations in sound recording he had learned during his session days. At the time, most music producers placed microphones directly in front of the amplifiers and drums. For &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;, Page developed the idea of placing an additional microphone some distance from the amplifier (as far as ) and then recording the balance between the two. Page became one of the first producers to record a band&#x27;s &quot;ambient sound&quot;: the distance of a note&#x27;s time-lag from one end of the room to the other. 

On some tracks, Plant&#x27;s vocals spill onto other tracks. Page later stated that this was a natural product of Plant&#x27;s powerful voice, but added the leakage &quot;sounds intentional&quot;. On &quot;You Shook Me&quot;, Page used the &quot;reverse echo&quot; technique. It involves hearing the echo before the main sound (instead of after it), and is achieved by turning the tape over and recording the echo on a spare track, then turning the tape back over again to get the echo preceding the signal.

This was one of the first albums to be released in stereo only. Prior to this, albums had been released in separate mono and stereo versions.

==Composition==

The songs on &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; came from the first group rehearsals, which were then refined on the Scandinavian tour. The group were familiar with the material when they entered Olympic to start recording, a reason the album was completed quickly. Plant participated in songwriting but was not given credit because of unexpired contractual obligations to CBS Records. He was retroactively given credit on &quot;Good Times, Bad Times&quot;, &quot;Your Time Is Gonna Come&quot;, &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;, &quot;Babe I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot;, and &quot;How Many More Times&quot;.

===Side one===
&quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot; was a commercial-sounding track that was considered as the group&#x27;s debut single in the UK, and released as such in the US. As well as showcasing the whole band and their new heavy style, it featured a catchy chorus and a variety of guitar overdubs. Despite being a strong track, it was seldom performed live by Led Zeppelin. One of the few occasions it was played was the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in 2007.

&quot;Babe I&#x27;m Gonna Leave You&quot; was a re-arrangement of a song composed by Anne Bredon in the 1950s. Page had heard the song recorded by Joan Baez for her 1962 album &quot;Joan Baez in Concert&quot;. It was one of the first numbers that he worked on with Plant when the two first met at Pangbourne in August 1968. Page played both the Gibson J-200 acoustic and Telecaster on the track. Plant originally sang the song in a heavier style, similar to other performances on the album, but was persuaded by Page to re-record it to allow some light and shade on the track.

&quot;You Shook Me&quot; was a blues song with lyrics by Willie Dixon and fitted in with the British blues boom that was ongoing when the album was being recorded. Jones, Plant and Page took solos on Hammond organ, harmonica and guitar respectively. Page put backwards echo on the track, which was then a novel production device, on the call and response between the vocal and guitar towards the end. The song had been recorded by Jeff Beck for the album &quot;Truth&quot; (1968) and Beck subsequently said he was unhappy about Led Zeppelin copying his arrangement.

&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; was written and recorded by Jake Holmes in 1967. The original album credited Page as the sole composer; Holmes sued for copyright infringement in 2010 and an out-of-court settlement was reached the following year. The Yardbirds performed the song regularly in concert during 1968, including several radio and television sessions. Their arrangement included a section where Page played the guitar with a violin bow, an idea suggested by David McCallum Sr. whom Page had met while doing sessions. Page also used the guitar solo for one of the last Yardbirds recordings, &quot;Think About It&quot;. Led Zeppelin&#x27;s adaptations of &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; used some different lyrics, while Jones and Bonham developed the arrangement to accommodate their playing styles.

The song was an important part of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s live show throughout their early career, and became a vehicle for group improvisation, eventually stretching in length to over 30minutes. The improvisation would sometimes include parts of another song, including the group&#x27;s &quot;The Crunge&quot; and &quot;Walter&#x27;s Walk&quot; (released later on &quot;Houses of the Holy&quot; and &quot;Coda&quot;, respectively), Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Woodstock&quot; and Scott McKenzie&#x27;s &quot;San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)&quot;. It was briefly dropped from the live set in 1975 after Page injured a finger, but was re-instated for the remainder of the tour. The last full live performance during Led Zeppelin&#x27;s main career was at Earl&#x27;s Court in London later that year, after which the violin bow section of the song&#x27;s guitar solo was played as a standalone piece. It was revived as a complete song performance for the Ahmet Ertegun Tribute Concert in 2007.

===Side two===
&quot;Your Time Is Gonna Come&quot; opens with Jones playing an unaccompanied organ solo, leading into the verse. Page plays acoustic and pedal steel guitar. The track has a crossfade into &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot;, an acoustic instrumental based on Bert Jansch&#x27;s arrangement of the traditional folk song &quot;Black Water Side&quot; and influenced by the folk playing of Jansch and John Renbourn. The song was regularly performed live as a medley with the Yardbirds solo guitar number &quot;White Summer&quot;.

&quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; was built around a Page guitar riff, and one of the first tunes the group worked on. They enjoyed playing it live, and consequently it was a regular part of their set. It was played intermittently throughout the group&#x27;s career, often as an encore.

&quot;I Can&#x27;t Quit You Baby&quot; was another Willie Dixon-penned blues number. It was recorded live in the studio, and arranged in a slower and more laid-back style compared to some of the other material on the album.

&quot;How Many More Times&quot; was the group&#x27;s closing live number in their early career. The song was improvised around an old Howlin&#x27; Wolf number, &quot;How Many More Years&quot;, and a Page guitar riff, which developed spontaneously into a jam session. The track includes a bolero section similar to Jeff Beck&#x27;s &quot;Beck&#x27;s Bolero&quot; (which was written by and featured Page), and segues into &quot;Rosie&quot; and &quot;The Hunter&quot; which were improvised during recording. Page played the guitar with the violin bow in the middle section of the track, similar to &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;.

===Unreleased material===
Two other songs from the Olympic sessions, &quot;Baby Come On Home&quot; and &quot;Sugar Mama&quot;, were left off the album. They were released on the 2015 reissue of the retrospective album &quot;Coda&quot;.

==Artwork==

&quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;″s front cover, which was chosen by Page, is based on a black-and-white image of the German zeppelin &quot;Hindenburg&quot; photographed by Sam Shere on 6 May 1937, when the airship burst into flames while landing at Lakehurst, New Jersey. The image refers to the origin of the band&#x27;s name itself: When Page, Beck and The Who&#x27;s Keith Moon and John Entwistle were discussing the idea of forming a group, Moon joked, &quot;It would probably go over like a lead balloon&quot;, and Entwistle reportedly replied, &quot;a lead zeppelin!&quot;

The back cover features a photograph of the band taken by Dreja. The entire design of the album&#x27;s sleeve was coordinated by George Hardie, with whom the band would continue to collaborate for future sleeves. Hardie himself also created the front cover illustration, cropping and rendering the famous original black-and-white photograph in ink using a Rapidograph technical pen and a mezzotint technique.

Hardie recalled that he originally offered the band a design based on an old club sign in San Franciscoa multi-sequential image of a zeppelin airship up in the clouds. Page declined but it was retained as the logo for the back cover of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s first two albums and a number of early press advertisements. The first UK pressing featured the band name and the Atlantic logo in turquoise. When it was switched to the orange print later that year, the turquoise-printed sleeve became a collector&#x27;s item.

The album cover gained further widespread attention when, at a February 1970 gig in Copenhagen, the band were billed as &quot;the Nobs&quot; as the result of a legal threat from aristocrat Eva von Zeppelin (a relative of the creator of the Zeppelin aircraft). Von Zeppelin, upon seeing the logo of the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; crashing in flames, threatened legal action over the concert taking place. In 2001, Greg Kot wrote in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that &quot;The cover of &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot;… shows the &quot;Hindenburg&quot; airship, in all its phallic glory, going down in flames. The image did a pretty good job of encapsulating the music inside: sex, catastrophe and things blowing up.&quot;

==Critical reception==
The album was advertised in selected music papers under the slogan &quot;Led Zeppelinthe only way to fly&quot;. It initially received poor reviews. In a stinging assessment, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine asserted that the band offered &quot;little that its twin, the Jeff Beck Group, didn&#x27;t say as well or better three months ago… to fill the void created by the demise of Cream, they will have to find a producer, editor and some material worthy of their collective talents&quot;, calling Page a &quot;limited producer&quot; and criticizing his writing skills. It also called Plant &quot;as foppish as Rod Stewart, but nowhere near so exciting&quot;. Because of the bad press, Led Zeppelin avoided talking to them throughout their career. Eventually, their reputation as a good live band recovered by word-of-mouth.

Rock journalist Cameron Crowe noted years later: &quot;It was a time of &#x27;super-groups&#x27;, of furiously hyped bands who could barely cut it, and Led Zeppelin initially found themselves fighting upstream to prove their authenticity.&quot; 

However, press reaction to the album was not entirely negative. In Britain the album received a glowing review in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Chris Welch wrote, in a review titled &quot;Jimmy Page triumphsLed Zeppelin is a gas!&quot;: &quot;Their material does not rely on obvious blues riffs, although when they do play them, they avoid the emaciated feebleness of most so-called British blues bands&quot;. In &quot;Oz&quot;, Felix Dennis regarded it as one of those rare albums that &quot;defies immediate classification or description, simply because it&#x27;s so obviously a turning point in rock music that only time proves capable of shifting it into eventual perspective&quot;. In comparing the record to their follow-up &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot;, Robert Christgau wrote in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; that the debut was &quot;subtler and more ambitious musically&quot;, and not as good, &quot;because subtlety defeated the effect. Musicianship, in other words, was really incidental to such music, but the music did have real strength and validity: a combination of showmanship and overwhelming physical force.&quot;

The album was a commercial success. It was initially released in the US on 13 January 1969 to capitalise on the band&#x27;s first North American concert tour. Before that, Atlantic Records had distributed a few hundred advance white label copies to key radio stations and reviewers. A positive reaction to its contents, coupled with a good reaction to the band&#x27;s opening concerts, resulted in the album generating 50,000 advance orders. The album reached number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; chart. The album earned its US gold certification in July 1969.

==Legacy==

The album&#x27;s success and influence is widely acknowledged, even by publications that were initially sceptical. In 2006, Mikal Gilmore commented in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on the originality of the music, and Zeppelin&#x27;s heavy style, contrasting them with Cream, Jimi Hendrix, the MC5 and the Stooges, and noting that they had mass appeal. &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; was cited by Stephen Thomas Erlewine as &quot;a significant turning point in the evolution of hard rock and heavy metal&quot;. According to arts and culture scholar Michael Fallon, it &quot;announced the emergence of a loud and raw new musical genre&quot; in metal. Greg Moffitt for the BBC said that the band was &quot;a product of the 60s, but their often bombastic style signposted a new decade and ... a new breed of rock bands&quot;. Sheldon Pearce from &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; regarded it as Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;ode to rock&#x27;s progressive metamorphosis&quot; and &quot;the first hard rock domino&quot; for their future accomplishments: &quot;Its orchestration delves adventurously through hard rock and heavy metal with bluesy undertones that often cause the chords to weep poignantly as if struck with malice&quot;.

The album was described as a &quot;brilliant if heavy-handed blues-rock offensive&quot; by popular music scholar Ronald Zalkind. Martin Popoff argued that while the album may not have been the first heavy metal record, it did feature what was likely to be the first metal song – &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;&quot;with its no-nonsense machine gun between the numbers riff&quot;. In 2003, VH1 named &quot;Led Zeppelin&quot; the 44th-greatest album of all time. The same year, the album was ranked 29th on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time (their highest-charting album on the list); an accompanying blurb read: &quot;Heavy metal still lives in its shadow,&quot; maintaining the rating in a 2012 revised list, and ranked 101st in a 2020 revised list. In 2004, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. Aerosmith&#x27;s Joe Perry observed that Jimmy Page &quot;was an incredible producer and he wrote all these great songs. When he was cutting the first Zeppelin album, he knew what he wanted. His vision was so much more global than Jeff [Beck] and Eric [Clapton&#x27;s]. Playing guitar was just one part of the puzzle… I have to have the first four Led Zeppelin albums on me at all times.&quot;


==2014 reissue==

Along with the group&#x27;s next two albums – &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; and &quot;Led Zeppelin III&quot; – the album was remastered and reissued in June 2014. The reissue comes in six formats: a standard CD edition, a deluxe two-CD edition, a standard LP version, a deluxe three-LP version, a super deluxe two-CD-plus-three-LP version with a hardback book, and as high-resolution, 24-bit/96k digital downloads. The deluxe and super-deluxe editions feature bonus material from a concert at the Olympia in Paris, recorded in October 1969, previously available only in bootleg forms. The reissue was released with an inverted black and white version of the original album&#x27;s artwork as its bonus disc&#x27;s cover.

The reissue was met with widespread critical acclaim. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album received an average score of 97, based on 10 reviews. &quot;Q&quot; deemed it an improvement over previous remasters of the album and credited Page&#x27;s contribution to the remaster for revealing more detail. Erlewine found the bonus disc &quot;particularly exciting&quot; in his review for AllMusic, writing that &quot;it&#x27;s not tight but that&#x27;s its appeal, as it shows how the band was a vital, living beast, playing differently on-stage than they did in the studio.&quot; According to &quot;Paste&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ryan Reed, &quot;for years, Zep-heads have tolerated the murky fidelity of the &#x27;90s remasters&quot; until the reissue, which &quot;finally punches and shimmers instead of fizzling in fuzz&quot;. He was critical of the bonus disc, however, believing it &quot;remains inessential—the very definition of &#x27;for completists only.&#x27;... [It] demonstrates Zeppelin at their most bloated, sloppily fumbling through rhythmic cues and extending tracks to their breaking point&quot;.

<text>Ferdinand II ( 1137 – 22 January 1188), was a member of the Castilian cadet branch of the House of Ivrea and King of León and Galicia from 1157 until his death.

==Life==
===Family===
Born in Toledo, Castile, Ferdinand was the third but second surviving son of King Alfonso VII of León and Castile and Berenguela of Barcelona. His paternal grandparents were Count Raymond of Burgundy and Queen Urraca of León and his maternal grandparents were Ramon Berenguer III, Count of Barcelona, and Douce I, Countess of Provence. He had seven full-siblings, of whom only three survived infancy: the later King Sancho III of Castile, Constance (wife of King Louis VII of France) and Sancha (wife of King Sancho VI of Navarre), and two half-siblings from his father&#x27;s second marriage with Richeza of Poland, of whom only survive Sancha (wife of King Alfonso II of Aragon).

===Childhood and early years===

Ferdinand&#x27;s education was entrusted to a Galician magnate, Count Fernando Pérez de Traba, member of the same lineage as the former knights of his grandmother, Queen Urraca, and of the tutors and defenders of his father, King Alfonso VII. Soon he was initiated into the tasks of government. From 1151 he is associated with the throne by his father, along with his older brother Infante Sancho, so in documents from León and Galicia his confirmation with the title of King, or &quot;King of Galicia&quot;, is common. He was surrounded from the beginning by the Leonese and Galician magnates, such as the Counts Ponce de Minerva, Ramiro Froilaz, Pedro Alfonso and the aforementioned Fernando Pérez de Traba.

In a council begun in Valladolid in the year 1155, were agreed the terms of the division of the domains of the still-living King Alfonso VII. There the Kingdoms of León and Galicia were assigned under Ferdinand&#x27;s sovereignty, excluding Tierra de Campos, Sahagún and Asturias de Santillana. Ferdinand earned the reputation of a good knight and hard fighter, but did not display political talent or organising ability.

===Beginning of reign and first marriage with Urraca of Portugal===
In 1157 his father, King Alfonso VII died, and according of his will and the previous dispositions of the council of Valladolid of 1155, his second son inherited the Kingdoms of León and Galicia under the name of Ferdinand II; during the early months of his reign, the new monarch had to resolve his disputes with the powerful local nobles and an invasion by his brother Sancho III of Castile. In 1158 Ferdinand II signed the Treaty of Sahagún with his brother Sancho III, under which they agreed to jointly wage war against the Muslims, to divide up the conquered territories, the provision that in case one of the two brothers died without issue, the survivor would inherit the domains of the deceased brother, and the partition of the Kingdom of Portugal. The death of his brother Sancho III in the same year and the succession of his infant son Alfonso VIII, annulled the clauses of the Treaty of Sahagún.

During the minority of age of his nephew Alfonso VIII, in the Kingdom of Castile began the dispute between the Houses of Lara and Castro to exercise the regency on behalf of the child king. Taking advantage of the anarchic state in which the kingdom of his late brother was found, Ferdinand II invaded Castile at the head of an army, and demanded, in order to restore order, that the Lara surrender him to his nephew Alfonso VIII, whose education he wished to take charge of.

In March 1160 Fernando Rodríguez de Castro, commanding the forces of the House of Castro, defeated the Lara supporters in the Battle of Lobregal, in which his father-in-law Count Osorio Martínez lost his life, and Nuño Pérez de Lara was captured. That same year, Ferdinand II was cured of a serious illness supposedly through the intercession of Saints Martin of Tours and Eufemia of Orense. In 1162 Fernando Rodríguez de Castro was appointed &quot;Majordomo mayor&quot; of Ferdinand II, a position he held twice: firstly from 15 August 1162 until his dismissal on 6 September 1164 and secondly from 19 October 1165 until 15 May 1166.

The boundary troubles with Castile restarted in 1164: he then met at Soria with the Lara family, who represented Alfonso VIII, and a truce was established, allowing him to move against the Muslim Almoravids who still held much of southern Spain, and to capture the cities of Alcántara and Alburquerque. In the same year, Ferdinand II defeated King Afonso I of Portugal, who, in 1163, had occupied Salamanca in retaliation for the repopulation of the area ordered by the King of León.

In May/June 1165 Ferdinand II married with Infanta Urraca of Portugal, daughter of King Afonso I, as a gesture of reconciliation and alliance between the Kingdoms of León and Portugal. At that time, he restored and repopulated the cities of Ledesma and Ciudad Rodrigo, and this caused the inhabitants of Salamanca who, apparently, had bought the city of Ledesma, took up arms against the king and the magistrates of Ledesma; when Ferdinand II learned of it, he marched with his army against the rebels and forced them to return to their city.

===The war against the Kingdom of Castile (1162–1166)===

In 1162, Ferdinand II conquered the city of Toledo, snatching it from the Castilians, and subsequently naming Fernando Rodríguez de Castro as Governor of the city. The city of Toledo remained in the power of the Kingdom of León until 1166, when it was recovered by the Castilians. On 27 September 1162, Ferdinand II signed an agreement, known as the Treaty of Ágreda, with Alfonso II of Aragon.

In 1164 Fernando Rodríguez de Castro entered the Kingdom of Castile for the second time with an army and defeated Count Manrique Pérez de Lara at the Battle of Huete, fought in June or July of that year. Four years later he was appointed Mayor of León, being his duty to control and be in command of the existing fortresses in the city, until the year 1182, when he left the office.

Ferdinand II and the members of the House of Lara met in Soria and agreed that, to defend the city of Toledo from the Saracens, they would hand over to the Knights Templar the city of Uclés, located in the current Province of Cuenca, and which would later become the headquarters of the Order of Santiago. The King of León, fearful that the members of the House of Lara would break the agreed peace, allied himself with King Sancho VI of Navarre to intimidate them and, in this way, be able to direct his troops against the Almohads, from whom he snatched the cities of Alcántara and Albuquerque.

===Conquest of Badajoz and war with the Kingdom of Portugal===

Despite Ferdinand II&#x27;s marriage to Infanta Urraca of Portugal, the disputes with the Lusitan kingdom continued. Between 1166 and 1168 King Afonso I of Portugal seized cities belonging to the Leonese kingdom. Ferdinand II then repopulated Ciudad Rodrigo, and the Portuguese monarch, suspecting that his son-in-law was fortifying it with the purpose of attacking him in the future, sent an army commanded by his son and heir, Infante Sancho of Portugal, against that city. The King of León came to the aid of the besieged Ciudad Rodrigo and, in a meeting he had with the Portuguese troops, put them to flight, capturing many prisoners. Afonso I then invaded Galicia, occupying Tui and the territory of Xinzo de Limia (former fiefs of his mother), and in 1169 attacked the city of Cáceres. However, as his troops were also besieging the city of Badajoz, which was in the power of the Saracens, Ferdinand II was able to push the Portuguese out of Galicia and to rush to Badajoz. When Afonso I saw the Leonese arrive he tried to flee, but he was disabled by a broken leg caused by a fall from his horse, and made prisoner at one of the city&#x27;s gates. Afonso I was obliged to surrender as his ransom almost all the conquests he had made in Galicia in the previous year. In the peace signed at Pontevedra the following year, Ferdinand II got back twenty-five castles, and the cities of Cáceres, Badajoz, Trujillo, Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Montánchez, previously lost by León. When in the same years the Almoravids laid siege to the Portuguese city of Santarém, Ferdinand II came to help his father-in-law, and helped to free the city from the menace.

At the beginning of the summer of 1169, Geraldo Geraldes &quot;Sem Pavor&quot; (&quot;without fear&quot;), of the kingdom of Portugal, took the city of Badajoz after a long siege, but the governor of the city took refuge in the Alcazaba of Badajoz, and the siege had to continue. Seeing the opportunity presented to him to add the main city of the region to his dominions at the expense of his Christian and Muslim enemies, Afonso I of Portugal an army to Badajoz in order to replace Gerardo &quot;Sem Pavor&quot; as conductor of the siege.

The city of Trujillo became the head of the domains assembled by Fernando Rodríguez de Castro. This provoked the opposition of Ferdinand II, who argued that Badajoz belonged to him. The King of León then headed south at the head of an army, at the request of the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf, who had already sent a contingent of 5,000 knights to help his besieged governor. Fernando Rodríguez de Castro, as the monarch&#x27;s &quot;Majordomo&quot;, was one of the Leonese leaders of the expedition. The Portuguese who besieged the Alcazaba of Badajoz, were then besieged by the Leonese, fighting broke out in the streets of the city. While trying to escape, Afonso I of Portugal was captured by the men of Ferdinand II, after breaking his leg. At the same time, Leonese monarch captured Gerardo &quot;Sem Pavor&quot;. After the capture of the city and the Alcazaba of Badajoz by the Leonese, the latter left the city in the hands of their Muslim allies. Gerardo &quot;Sem Pavor&quot; had to surrender several of the towns he had conquered to the Kingdom of León, in exchange for his freedom. Ferdinand II kept the city of Cáceres, but the towns of Trujillo, Montánchez, Santa Cruz de la Sierra and Monfragüe became the property of Fernando Rodríguez de Castro. After this donation, Fernando Rodríguez de Castro became the lord of a semi-independent principality located between the Tagus and Guadiana rivers, whose headquarters were in the city of Trujillo. Alfonso VIII realized the strategic importance of the fortresses granted to the Castilian, with a view to a future repopulation, since the fortresses were in the area that according to the Treaty of Sahagún of 1158 belonged to the area of influence of the Kingdom of Castile. Defeated by Afonso I of Portugal, the Muslims attacked the Kingdom of León in 1173, trying to seize Ciudad Rodrigo; but Ferdinand II, who had knowledge of his purposes, entrenched himself in the city of Salamanca with the troops he was able to gather in León, in Zamora, in various places in Galicia and in other parts of the kingdom, at the same time giving order to the rest of his army to meet him asap. The Muslims were defeated and only those who fled could keep their freedom.

In 1170, Ferdinand II created the military-religious Order of Santiago de Compostela, with the task to protect the city of Cáceres. Like the Order of Alcántara, it initially began as a knightly confraternity and took the name &quot;Santiago&quot; (St. James) after St. James the apostle, with the purpose to protect the pilgrims who visited the tomb of the Apostle Santiago.

===Second marriage with Teresa Fernández de Traba===
In 1175, Pope Alexander III annulled the marriage of Ferdinand II and Urraca of Portugal because they were related in the prohibited third degree of consanguinity as being second cousins (their grandmothers, Queen Urraca of León and Countess Teresa of Portugal were half-sisters), despite the fact that the Queen gave birth a son and heir, Infante Alfonso, in 1171. The gold of Castile and England countered the one that Leon offered to Rome to obtain the Papal dispensation for the marriage, since its validity supposed de facto the alliance of Portugal and León, which did not interest neither Castile nor to England, who had family ties to each other after Alfonso VIII was married to Eleanor, daughter of King Henry II of England.

After August 1177 and certainly before 7 October 1178, Ferdinand II married with Teresa Fernández de Traba, the illegitimate daughter of Count Fernando Pérez de Traba (the king&#x27;s former tutor) and Countess Teresa of Portugal, and widow of Count Nuño Pérez de Lara; with this marriage, the king cemented his alliance with the powerful Houses of Lara and Traba —although just like his first marriage, Ferdinand II was also closely related with his new wife in not only a prohibited degree of consanguinity but also of affinity (they were not only 1st cousins once removed but also Teresa Fernández de Traba was aunt of Urraca of Portugal), apparently there wasn&#x27;t any questioning or impediment for this new wedding of the Leonese monarch.

===War with the Kingdom of Castile and conference of Tordesillas (1178–1180)===
In 1178 Ferdinand II invaded the Kingdom of Castile. He seized the municipalities of Castrojeriz and Dueñas (both formerly lands of Teresa Fernández de Traba&#x27;s first husband) before Alfonso VIII could have put these fortresses on alert, while the Castilian sovereign allied himself with Afonso I of Portugal, who sent his son, Infante Sancho, to fight against the King of León.

In 1180 the Kings of León and Castile met in the town of Tordesillas, where they agreed to put an end to their differences, sealing a peace agreement. On 6 February of that year, Ferdinand II&#x27;s second wife Teresa Fernández de Traba died giving birth to their second son, who died at the same time as his mother and was buried together with her in the Royal Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro of León.

===Ordination of the territory===

Ferdinand II granted &quot;cartas forales&quot; to numerous cities and towns; in 1164, to Padrón and Ribadavia; in 1168, to Noia; in 1169 to Castro Caldelas and to the city of Pontevedra; in 1170 to Tui and in 1177 to Lugo. It also favored numerous monasteries, such as those of Sobrado, Melón, Armenteira, Moraime and San Martín de Xubia. It also benefited the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, granting a life pension to Master Mateo. During his reign the Order of Santiago was founded and Pope Alexander III granted the grace of the Jacobean jubilee holy year (&quot;Bula Regis Aeterni&quot;, 1181). This privilege granted to the Santiago de Compostela Cathedral favored the heyday of pilgrimages, while promoting the economic, cultural and artistic development of the territories crossed by the Camino de Santiago.

===Last years – third marriage with Urraca López de Haro===
In 1184, after a series of failed attempts, the Almohad caliph Abu Yaqub Yusuf invaded Portugal with an army recruited in Northern Africa and, in May, besieged Afonso I in Santarém; the Portuguese were helped by the arrival of the armies sent by the archbishop of Santiago de Compostela, in June, and by Ferdinand II in July.

In May 1187 Ferdinand II married with Urraca López de Haro, daughter of Lope Díaz I de Haro, Lord of Biscay, and widow of Nuño Menéndez, Lord of Ceón and Riaño, who was had been his mistress from at least May 1180. On occasion of the wedding, the king granted his new wife the Lordships of Aguilar and Monteagudo. The new queen, who was aware that the end of her husband&#x27;s life was approaching, wanted to elevate her only surviving son, Infante Sancho, to the throne of León, in detriment of the Infante Alfonso, Ferdinand II&#x27;s first-born son. To achieve her purpose, Urraca López de Haro maintained that the birth of Infante Alfonso was illegitimate, since the marriage of his parents had been annulled due to the existing blood ties between both spouses. Ferdinand II then banished Infante Alfonso, which was a triumph for his stepmother, who made an effort to ensure that her son inherited the throne upon the death of his father.

===Death and burial===
Ferdinand II died at Benavente on 22 January 1188 aged 51, while returning from a pilgrimage to Santiago de Compostela, and was succeeded to the throne by his eldest son, Alfonso IX of León. The &quot;Primera Crónica General&quot; describes the death of the King of León as follows:

Contravening his wishes to be buried at Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, Ferdinand II was buried somewhere, possibly in the Royal Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro of León, since his widow, Queen Urraca, did not want to transfer the mortal remains to Santiago of Compostela, since its Archbishop, Pedro Suárez de Deza, was a supporter of King Alfonso IX.

Later, his remains were transferred by order of his son Alfonso IX to Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, in which Ferdinand II had stated that he wanted to be buried, since there where buried his mother Queen Berengaria of Barcelona and his grandfather Count Raymond of Burgundy, and, therefore, in a document granted in the city of Benavente on 26 July 1180, confirmed to Santiago de Compostela Cathedral the donations that the sovereign had granted him previously, and that concerned the chaplaincy and the royal tombs of the cathedral, also ordering in said document that no one can build any castle in that territory.

The transfer of the remains of Ferdinand II is mentioned in a diploma granted in Zamora by Alfonso IX dated 4 May 1188, which certifies that the royal remains were transferred to Santiago de Compostela Cathedral by order of his son, who wished to fulfill the last wishes of his father, and buried next to the remains of the Apostle Santiago with royal honors, while confirming in said document the privileges and exemptions granted to the cathedral by the soul of his deceased father, and his own.

The tomb of Ferdinand II is located in the Chapel of the Relics of Santiago de Compostela Cathedral, where the Royal Pantheon is located. On a smooth stone sepulcher is placed the recumbent statue that represents the late king, who appears dressed in a tunic and mantle, his forehead girded with a royal crown, and his head is represented with curly hair and a beard, with the right arm of the sovereign raised and placed at the height of his head, while his left hand rests on his chest. The recumbent statue representing Ferdinand II has been dated to the first half of the 13th century. It was carried out after the death of the king, who died in 1188, which has led to the conclusion that it should have been commissioned by the king&#x27;s heir, Alfonso IX of León.

==Issue==
Ferdinand II and his first wife, Urraca of Portugal, had one son:
* Alfonso IX (15 August 1171 – 23/24 September 1230), who eventually succeeded him as King of León and Galicia

Ferdinand II and his second wife, Teresa Fernández de Traba, had two sons:
* Ferdinand (1178–1187), who died in infancy and was buried in the Royal Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro of León
* Sancho (born and died 6 February 1180), whose birth led to the death of his mother and also buried in the Royal Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro of León

Ferdinand II and his third wife, Urraca López de Haro, had three sons:
* García Fernández (1182–1184), died before the marriage of his parents, buried in the Royal Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro of León
* Alfonso Fernández (1184–1188), legitimized through the subsequent marriage of his parents, died before his father and was also buried in the Royal Pantheon of the Kings of San Isidoro of León
* Sancho Fernández (1186 – 25 August 1220), legitimized through the subsequent marriage of his parents, Lord of Monteagudo and Aguilar in succession to his mother, alférez mayor of his half-brother King Alfonso IX on 10 June 1213, and from 8 December 1213 to 16 July 1218, governor of Montenegro and Sarría during 1210–1219

<text>James Strom Thurmond Sr. (December 5, 1902 – June 26, 2003) was an American politician who represented South Carolina in the United States Senate from 1954 to 2003. Before his 47 years as a senator, he served as the 103rd governor of South Carolina from 1947 to 1951. Thurmond was officially a member of the Democratic Party in the Senate until 1964, when he joined the Republican Party. He had earlier run for president in 1948 as the Dixiecrat candidate in opposition to Democratic president Harry Truman, receiving over a million votes and winning four states, and Thurmond endorsed Republican Dwight Eisenhower for president throughout the 1950s.

A staunch opponent of civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s, Thurmond conducted the longest speaking filibuster ever by a lone senator, at 24 hours and 18 minutes in length, in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957. In the 1960s, he voted against both the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Despite his support for racial segregation, Thurmond denied the accusation that he was a racist by insisting he was a supporter of states&#x27; rights and an opponent of excessive federal authority. Thurmond switched parties ahead of the 1964 United States presidential election, saying that the Democratic Party no longer represented people like him, and endorsed Republican nominee Barry Goldwater, who also opposed the Civil Rights Act. By the 1970s, Thurmond started to moderate his stance on race, but continued to defend his prior support for segregation based on states&#x27; rights and Southern society at the time.

As a Republican, Thurmond served three times as President pro tempore of the United States Senate, and chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1981 to 1987 and the Senate Armed Services Committee from 1995 to 1999. He retired in 2003 as the only member of either chamber of Congress to reach the age of 100 while still in office and the oldest-serving senator; he died less than six months later. His 47 years as a senator, a record at the time, is the fourth-longest in U.S. history behind Robert Byrd, Daniel Inouye, and Patrick Leahy. Thurmond was also, at 14 years, the longest-serving Dean of the United States Senate.
== Early life and education (1902–1933) ==
James Strom Thurmond was born on December 5, 1902, in Edgefield, South Carolina. He was the second of six children born to John William Thurmond (1862–1934) and Eleanor Gertrude Strom (1870–1958). Thurmond&#x27;s father was a lawyer and politician who served as a county supervisor and representative to the South Carolina General Assembly. In 1902, Thurmond&#x27;s father unsuccessfully contested the election for United States Congress. Strom&#x27;s mother came from a well-known Edgefield family. She was a deeply religious woman, known for delivering prayers. Thurmond learned to ride ponies, horses, and bulls from an early age. When Thurmond was four, his family moved into a larger home, where they owned about six acres of land. His parents were frequently visited by politicians and lawyers. At six years old, he had an encounter with Benjamin Tillman, a senator from South Carolina. Thurmond remembered the handshake with Tillman as his first political skill.

Thurmond attended Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina (now Clemson University), where he studied horticulture. At Clemson, he served as the president of the Calhoun Literary Society, where he debated and learned parliamentary procedure. He was deeply influenced by his English professorDavid Wistar Daniel, namesake of D. W. Daniel High School. Thurmond graduated from Clemson in 1923 with a Bachelor of Science degree.

After his graduation, Thurmond worked as a farmer, teacher, and athletic coach.

In 1925, Thurmond fathered a child born to Carrie Butler, an African-American teenager who worked as his family&#x27;s housekeeper. In 2003, the Thurmond family confirmed that Thurmond fathered a mixed-race daughter named Essie Mae with Butler. While her paternity was long hidden, he helped support her and paid for her college education.

In 1929, Thurmond was appointed as Edgefield County superintendent of education. While serving as superintendent of education, he began studying to become a lawyer by reading law under his father&#x27;s guidance.

== Early career (1933–1947) ==

=== South Carolina Senate (1933–1938) ===

In 1930, Thurmond was admitted to the South Carolina bar. He was appointed as the Edgefield Town and County attorney, serving from 1930 to 1938. Thurmond supported Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. Thurmond favored Roosevelt&#x27;s argument that the federal government could be used to assist citizens in the daily plights brought on by the Great Depression. Thurmond raised money for Roosevelt and, following his victory, traveled to Washington to attend Roosevelt&#x27;s inauguration.

In 1933, Thurmond began his own political career by being elected to the South Carolina Senate. He served there until 1938, when he was elected as a state circuit judge. During his days as a circuit judge, after Sue Logue participated in planning the murder of Davis Timmerman, Thurmond convinced her to surrender to authorities.

===World War II===
In 1942, at age 39, after the U.S. formally entered World War II, Judge Thurmond resigned from the bench to serve in the U.S. Army, rising to lieutenant colonel. In the Battle of Normandy (June 6 – August 25, 1944), he landed in a glider attached to the 82nd Airborne Division. For his military service, Thurmond received 18 decorations, medals and awards, including the Legion of Merit with Oak Leaf Cluster, Bronze Star with Valor device, Purple Heart, World War II Victory Medal, European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, Belgium&#x27;s Order of the Crown and France&#x27;s Croix de Guerre.

During 1954–55, Thurmond was president of the Reserve Officers Association. He retired from the U.S. Army Reserve with the rank of major general.

== Governor of South Carolina (1947–1951) ==

Running as a Democrat in what was virtually a one-party state, since most African Americans (who then favored the Republican Party) were still disenfranchised by state discriminatory laws and practices, Thurmond was elected governor of South Carolina in 1946. He had promised to make state government more transparent and accountable by weakening the power of a group of politicians from Barnwell, whom Thurmond dubbed the Barnwell Ring, led by House Speaker Solomon Blatt.

Many voters considered Thurmond a progressive for much of his term, in large part due to his influence in gaining the arrest of the perpetrators of the lynching of Willie Earle. Though none of the men were found guilty by an all-white jury, in a case where the defense called no witnesses, Thurmond was congratulated by the NAACP and the ACLU for his efforts to bring the murderers to justice.

In 1949, Thurmond oversaw the opening of Camp Croft State Park. In November he was unanimously elected Chairman of the Southern Governors Conference and was considered to be a states&#x27; rights nominee.

===1948 presidential campaign===

In the 1948 presidential election, Thurmond ran for president as a third party candidate for the States&#x27; Rights Democratic Party, which was formed by White southern Democrats who split from the national party over the threat of federal intervention in state affairs regarding racial segregation and Jim Crow laws and practices.

Thurmond&#x27;s supporters took control of the Democratic Party in the Deep South. Incumbent President Harry S. Truman was not included on the presidential ballot in Alabama because that state&#x27;s Supreme Court ruled void any requirement for party electors to vote for the national nominee. Thurmond stated that Truman, Thomas Dewey and Henry A. Wallace would lead the U.S. to totalitarianism. Thurmond called civil rights initiatives dangerous to the American constitution and making the country susceptible to communism in the event of their enactment, challenging Truman to a debate on the issue. Thurmond carried four states and received 39 electoral votes, but was unable to stop Truman&#x27;s re-election.

During the campaign, Thurmond said the following in a speech met with loud cheers by his assembled supporters: 

===1950 U.S. Senate campaign in South Carolina===
According to term limits in the state constitution, Thurmond was barred from seeking a second consecutive term as governor in 1950, so he mounted a Democratic primary challenge against first-term U.S. senator Olin Johnston. On May 1, Thurmond&#x27;s Senate campaign headquarters opened in Columbia, South Carolina with Ernest Craig serving as campaign leader and George McNabb in charge of public relations; both men were on leave from their state positions in the governor&#x27;s office.

In the one-party state of the time, the Democratic primary was the only competitive contest. Both candidates denounced President Truman during the campaign. Johnston defeated Thurmond 186,180 votes to 158,904 votes (54% to 46%) in what would be Thurmond&#x27;s first and only state electoral defeat.

In 1952, Thurmond endorsed Republican Dwight Eisenhower for the presidency, rather than the Democratic nominee Adlai Stevenson. Stevenson still narrowly carried South Carolina, traditionally Democratic, in the general election.

== United States Senator ==
=== 1950s and early 1960s ===
The incumbent U.S. senator from South Carolina, Burnet R. Maybank, was unopposed for re-election in 1954, but he died two months before election day. The state Democratic Party selected Edgar A. Brown to replace Maybank without conducting a primary election.

Thurmond organized a write-in campaign for the vacant Senate seat. He pledged that if he won, he would resign in 1956 to force a primary election. Easily winning the 1954 election, he was the first person to be elected to the U.S. Senate as a write-in candidate. In January 1955, Thurmond expressed his view that federal encroachment on states&#x27; rights was among the biggest threats to American life and violated the Constitution. In July, Thurmond supported the Republican Eisenhower Administration bill for an expanded military reserve law over the alternate plan proposed by fellow Democratic Senator Richard Russell.

Thurmond co-wrote the first version of the Southern Manifesto, stating disagreement with the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education,&quot; that declared that segregated public schools were unconstitutional and ordered them integrated. In early 1956, Thurmond resigned from the Senate, keeping the promise he had made two years earlier. He won the primary as well as the general election unopposed. Thereafter, he returned to the Senate in November 1956.

In 1957, the Eisenhower administration introduced an amended version of the Civil Rights Bill, imposing expansion of federal supervision of integration in Southern states. In an unsuccessful attempt to prevent the bill passage, Thurmond filibustered the bill, speaking for a total of 24 hours and 18 minutes, the longest filibuster ever conducted by a single senator. Other Southern senators, who had agreed as part of a compromise not to filibuster this bill, were upset with Thurmond because they thought his defiance made them look incompetent to their constituents. Despite his efforts, the Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1957 on August 29. During his filibuster, Thurmond relied on the book &quot;The Case for the South&quot;, written by W. D. Workman Jr.; Thurmond had known the author for fifteen years. Workman had covered both Thurmond&#x27;s tenure as South Carolina governor and his presidential campaign, in addition to having served in the military unit which Thurmond had organized in Columbia. He had turned down an offer by Thurmond to serve as his Washington, DC office press secretary.

Thurmond sent a copy of &quot;The Case for the South&quot; to each of his Senate colleagues and then-vice president Richard Nixon. The book was described in 2013 by Loyola history professor and author Elizabeth Shermer as &quot;a compendium of segregationist arguments that hit all the high points of regional apologia&quot;.

In January 1959, the Senate held a debate over changing the rules to curb filibusters. Thurmond expressed the view that the Senate should return to the rule prior to 1917, when there were no regulations on the time for debate. In February 1960, Thurmond requested a quorum call that would produce at least half the membership of the Senate, the call being seen as one of the delay tactics employed by Southerners during the meeting. 51 senators assembled, allowing the Senate to adjourn in spite of Thurmond&#x27;s calls for another quorum call. Thurmond afterward denied his responsibility in convening the Saturday session, attributing it to Democrat Lyndon B. Johnson. He said that those insistent on passing a civil rights bill should be around during discussions on the matter. In the 1960 United States presidential election, Thurmond refused to back the Democratic nominee, his Senate colleague John F. Kennedy, due to the latter&#x27;s support for civil rights. In the 1960 South Carolina Senate race, Thurmond ran unopposed in the general election; no Republican candidate was on the ballot. As of 2022, 1960 remains the last time a Democrat won South Carolina&#x27;s Class 2 Senate seat. In the presidential election, Thurmond received 14 electoral votes for vice president (as Harry Byrd Sr.&#x27;s running mate). Though both Byrd and Thurmond had long since moved on from the States Rights&#x27; Democratic Party, they were the decided protest ticket of several Southern delegates and unpledged electors, who refused to give their support to Kennedy.

Thurmond predicted the 87th Congress would begin with a move to remove him from the Senate Democratic Caucus. This did not happen, and an aide for Senator Joseph S. Clark Jr. said there was never an intention to pursue recourse against Thurmond, though in his opinion Thurmond should no longer be a member of the party.

In August 1961, Thurmond formally requested the Senate Armed Services Committee to vote on whether to vote for &quot;a conspiracy to muzzle military anti-Communist drives.&quot; The appearance prompted the cancellation of another public appearance in Fort Jackson, as Thurmond favored marking his proposal with his presence, and his request for a $75,000 committee study was slated for consideration. In November, Thurmond said that President Kennedy had lost support in the South due to the formation of the National Relations Boards, what he called Kennedy&#x27;s softness on communism, and an increase in military men being muzzled for speaking out against communism.

In May 1962, Thurmond was part of a group of Senate orators headed by John C. Stennis who expressed opposition to the Kennedy administration&#x27;s literacy test bill, arguing that the measure was in violation of states&#x27; rights as defined by the Constitution. The bill was an effort to reduce the use of discriminatory and subjective literacy tests in the South; ostensibly used to establish voters&#x27; competency, in practice they were used against African-American voters and preventing their registration. After the Supreme Court ruled state composed prayer in public schools was unconstitutional, Thurmond urged Congress to take steps to prevent the Court from making similar decisions. In September 1962, Thurmond called for an invasion of Cuba. In February 1963, Thurmond stated that &quot;the brush curtain around Cuba is a formidable Soviet strategic military base&quot; and estimated between 30,000 and 40,000 Cuban troops were under the leadership of a Soviet general. Hours after the statement was made public, a Pentagon official disputed his claims as being &quot;at wide variance with carefully evaluated data collected by U.S. intelligence&quot; and called for Thurmond to release his proof to the Defense Department. During Paul Nitze&#x27;s nomination hearing for Secretary of the Navy, Thurmond was noted for asking &quot;rapid fire questions&quot; on military action and focusing on Nitze&#x27;s participation as a moderator in the 1958 National Council of Churches conference. Along with Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, Thurmond delayed the Nitze nomination. In spite of Thurmond voting against him, the nomination was approved.

The day after the Nitze vote, President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Thurmond expressed the view that a conspiracy would be found by investigators to have been responsible for JFK&#x27;s death. Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson ascended to the presidency. He began campaigning to secure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which angered white segregationists. These laws ended segregation and committed the federal government to enforce voting rights of citizens by the supervision of elections in states in which the pattern of voting showed black people had been disenfranchised. During the signing ceremony for the Civil Rights Act, President Johnson nominated LeRoy Collins as the first Director of the Community Relations Service. Subsequently, Thurmond reminded Collins of his past support for segregation and implied that he was a traitor to the South, Thurmond having particular disdain for an address by Collins the previous winter in which he charged Southern leaders with being harsh and intemperate. Thurmond also suggested that Collins had sought to fault southern leaders for President Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. Thurmond was the only senator to vote against Collins&#x27; nomination being sent to the Senate, and later one of eight senators to vote against his nomination in the chamber.

=== Party switch and late 1960s ===
On September 16, 1964, Thurmond confirmed he was leaving the Democratic Party to work on the presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater, charging the Democrats with having &quot;abandoned the people&quot; and having repudiated the U.S. Constitution. During the campaign, Thurmond told reporters that he believed Barry Goldwater could carry South Carolina and other southern states. Though Goldwater lost in a landslide, he won South Carolina with 59% of the vote compared to President Johnson&#x27;s 41%. Senate Republicans were lukewarm to Thurmond due to their &quot;super minority&quot; of only 32 seats in the Senate prior to Thurmond&#x27;s switch, and voted for committee assignments granting Thurmond the ability &quot;to keep at least some of the seniority power he had gained as a Democrat.&quot; Following the election, Johnson continued to push through Civil Rights legislation, most notably the Voting Rights Act in 1965, which committed the federal government to enforce voting rights of citizens by the supervision of elections in states with noted record of voter suppression and disenfranchisement. Thurmond explained his opposition to the Voting Rights Act as being opposed to its authorization of the federal government to determine the processes behind how statewide elections are conducted and insisted he was not against black voter turnout. During floor debate on the bill, Thurmond espoused that the VRA would lead to &quot;despotism and tyranny.&quot; With the Voting Rights Act passing into law by a slightly larger margin than the Civil Rights Act, Thurmond&#x27;s opposition to civil rights had proven as ineffective as a Republican as it had been as a Democrat.

In 1965, L. Mendel Rivers became chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, commentator Wayne King crediting Thurmond&#x27;s involvement with Rivers as giving Rivers&#x27; district &quot;an even dozen military installations that are said to account for one‐third to one‐half of the jobs in the area.&quot; In his 1966 re-election campaign, the new Republican senator faced no opposition in the primary, and competed against Bradley Morrah Jr. in the general election campaign. Morrah avoided direct charges against Thurmond&#x27;s record and generally spoke of his own ambitions in the event he was elected, later referring to Thurmond&#x27;s time in the Senate as being ineffective. Thurmond won election with 62.2 percent of the vote (271,297 votes) to Morrah&#x27;s 37.8 percent (164,955 votes). In 1966, former governor Ernest &quot;Fritz&quot; Hollings won South Carolina&#x27;s other Senate seat in a special election. He and Thurmond served together for just over 36 years, making them the longest-serving Senate duo in American history.

At the start of the 89th United States Congress, Thurmond was appointed to the Senate Judiciary subcommittee on Constitutional Rights. In March, Thurmond won unanimous approval to have Clark&#x27;s remarks removed from the record following an argument the senators had after Clark mentioned that Charleston, South Carolina would be included in the Pentagon&#x27;s list of twenty-five American cities that would get priority in their antimissile protection and attributed this to House Armed Services Committee Chairman Rivers&#x27; influence. In June 1967, Johnson nominated Thurgood Marshall to be the first African-American Justice on the Supreme Court, Thurmond joined Sam Ervin, Spessard Holland, and James Eastland in calling Marshall a &quot;Constitutional iconoclast&quot; in Senate debate. Thurmond questioned Marshall for an hour &quot;on fine points of constitutional law and history&quot;, and accused Marshall of having evaded questions on his legal principles during committee hearings. Marshall was still confirmed by the Senate at the end of that month. Later that year, Thurmond attributed the 1967 USS &quot;Forrestal&quot; fire to being precipitated by communists, and warned against enacting any of the three proposed Panama Canal treaties on the grounds that they would lead to Communist control of the waterway if enacted.

In 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren decided to retire, and Johnson subsequently nominated Abe Fortas to succeed him. On the third day of hearings, Thurmond questioned Fortas over &quot;Mallory v. United States&quot; (1957), a case taking place before Fortas&#x27;s tenure, but for which he was nonetheless held responsible by Thurmond. Thurmond asked Fortas if the Supreme Court decision in the &quot;Mallory v. United States&quot; case was an encouragement of individuals to commit serious crimes such as rape and if he believed in &quot;that kind of justice&quot;, an inquiry that shocked even the usually stoic Fortas. Thurmond displayed sex magazines, which he called &quot;obscene, foul, putrid, filthy and repulsive&quot;, to validate his charges that Supreme Court rulings overturning obscenity convictions had led to a large wave of hardcore pornography material. Thurmond stated that Fortas had backed overturning 23 of the 26 lower court obscenity decisions. Thurmond also arranged for the screening of explicit films that Fortas had purportedly legalized to be played before reporters and his own Senate colleagues. In September, Vice President Hubert Humphrey spoke of a deal made between Thurmond and Nixon over Thurmond&#x27;s opposition to the Fortas nomination. Both Nixon and Thurmond denied Humphrey&#x27;s claims, Thurmond saying that he had never discussed the nomination with Nixon while conceding the latter had unsuccessfully tried to sway him from opposing Fortas.

In the lead-up to the 1968 United States Presidential election, Thurmond stated that President Johnson could be defeated in a re-election bid by a Republican challenger since the candidate was likely to be less obnoxious than the president. Thurmond was an early supporter of a second presidential campaign by Nixon, his backing coming from the latter&#x27;s position on the Vietnam War, Thurmond promising Nixon that he would not give in to the &quot;depredations of the Reagan forces.&quot; During the general election campaign, Nixon&#x27;s running mate Spiro Agnew stated that he did not believe Thurmond was a racist when asked his opinion on the matter, and Thurmond participated in a two-day tour of Georgia during October where he warned that American Independent Party candidate George Wallace would split the vote and give the election to Democratic nominee Hubert Humphrey by having the Democratic-majority House of Representatives select him in the event none of the candidates received enough electoral votes to win the presidency outright. Thurmond also predicted that Nixon would carry Virginia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Florida, Texas and Tennessee. Nixon carried each of these states with the exception of Texas.

Thurmond decried the Supreme Court opinion in &quot;Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education&quot; (1969), which ordered the immediate desegregation of schools in the American South. This had followed continued Southern resistance for more than a decade to desegregation following the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. Thurmond praised President Nixon and his &quot;Southern Strategy&quot; of delaying desegregation, saying Nixon &quot;stood with the South in this case&quot;. In 1969, Thurmond opined that &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;had a conflict of interest in its attacks on Otto F. Otepka&#x27;s appointment to the Subversive Activities Control Board.&quot; and called for Associate Justice William O. Douglas to resign over what he considered political activities, a request which Douglas ignored. In the latter part of the year, President Nixon nominated Clement Haynsworth for associate justice. This came after the White House consulted with Thurmond throughout all of July, as Thurmond had become impressed with Haynsworth following their close collaboration. Thurmond wrote to Haynsworth that he had worked harder on his nomination than any other that had occurred since his Senate career began. The Haynsworth nomination was rejected in the Senate. Years later, at a 1977 hearing, Thurmond told Haynsworth, &quot;It&#x27;s a pity you are not on the Supreme Court today. Several senators who voted against you have told me they would vote for you if they had it to do again.&quot;

In 1969, &quot;Time&quot; ran a story accusing Thurmond of receiving &quot;an extraordinarily high payment for land&quot;. Thurmond responded to the claim by calling the tale a liberal smear intended to damage his political influence, later calling the magazine &quot;anti-South&quot;. and a few days later, Thurmond named executive director of the South Carolina Democratic Party Donald L. Fowler as the individual who had spread the story, a charge that Fowler denied.

=== Early 1970s ===
In 1970, African-Americans constituted about 30 percent of South Carolina&#x27;s population. After the Voting Rights Act of 1965, African Americans were legally protected in exercising their constitutional rights to register and vote in South Carolina. Thurmond appointed Thomas Moss, an African American, to his Senate staff in 1971. It has been described as the first such appointment by a member of the South Carolina congressional delegation (it was incorrectly reported by many sources as the first senatorial appointment of an African American, but Mississippi Senator Pat Harrison had hired clerk-librarian Jesse Nichols in 1937). In 1983, Thurmond supported legislation to make the birthday of Martin Luther King Jr. a federal holiday. In South Carolina, the honor was diluted; until 2000 the state offered employees the option to celebrate this holiday or substitute one of three Confederate holidays instead. Despite this, Thurmond never explicitly renounced his earlier views on racial segregation.

In January 1970, Thurmond asserted that he would work &quot;to reverse the unreasonable and impractical decisions of the Supreme Court&quot;, as well as assist with the appointment of &quot;sound judges&quot; and uphold the Nixon administration&#x27;s position for resumption of tax‐exempt status among all private schools. In a 1970 speech, Thurmond called on Japan to increase defense spending and take a larger role in resisting communism in Asia. Thurmond also defended the Vietnam policy of the Nixon administration, saying that the president was making the best of the situation that he had inherited from Kennedy and Johnson while admitting he personally favored a total victory in the war. On April 11, 1971, Thurmond called for the exoneration of William Calley following his conviction of participating in the My Lai Massacre, stating that the &quot;victims at Mylai were casualties to the brutality of war&quot; and Calley had acted off of order. Calley&#x27;s petition for habeas corpus was granted three years later, in addition to his immediate release from house arrest. In January 1975, Thurmond and William Scott toured South Vietnam, Thurmond receiving a medal from President of South Vietnam Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. The award was seen as part of an attempt by South Vietnam to court American congressional votes in its favor.

In February 1971, Senate Republicans voted unanimously to bestow Thurmond full seniority, the vote being seen as &quot;little more than a gesture since committee assignments are the major item settled by seniority and Senator Thurmond has his.&quot; In June, Thurmond advocated against lifting the trade embargo on the People&#x27;s Republic of China, stating that its communist regime had engaged in a propaganda effort to weaken support for the embargo. Nevertheless, days later, President Nixon ordered an end to the embargo.

On February 4, 1972, Thurmond sent a secret memo to William Timmons (in his capacity as an aide to Richard Nixon) and United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, with an attached file from the Senate Internal Security Subcommittee, urging that British musician John Lennon (then living in New York City) be deported from the United States as an undesirable alien, due to Lennon&#x27;s political views and activism. The document claimed Lennon&#x27;s influence on young people could affect Nixon&#x27;s chances of re-election, and suggested that terminating Lennon&#x27;s visa might be &quot;a strategy counter-measure&quot;. Thurmond&#x27;s memo and attachment, received by the White House on February 7, 1972, initiated the Nixon administration&#x27;s persecution of John Lennon that threatened the former Beatle with deportation for nearly five years from 1972 to 1976. The documents were discovered in the FBI files after a Freedom of Information Act search by Professor Jon Wiener, and published in Weiner&#x27;s book &quot;Gimme Some Truth: The John Lennon FBI Files&quot; (2000). They are discussed in the documentary film, &quot;The U.S. vs. John Lennon&quot; (2006).

In July 1973, Thurmond was one of ten Republican senators in a group headed by Carl T. Curtis invited to the White House to reaffirm their support for President Nixon in light of recent scandals and criticism of the president within his own party. In October, after President Nixon ordered the firing of independent special prosecutor Archibald Cox, Democrat Birch Bayh charged Thurmond with &quot;browbeating&quot; Cox during Senate Judiciary Committee hearings on the firing. Thurmond replied that Bayh was &quot;below a snake&quot; in the event that he had intended to impugn his motives. Thurmond was noted for joining Edward J. Gurney in questioning Cox &quot;at length in an attempt to show that he was biased against&quot; Nixon and his administration, as Thurmond asked Cox if eleven members of his staff had worked for Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. In May 1974, Thurmond, along with William L. Scott and James B. Allen agreed with Senator Carl T. Curtis on the equation of resignation with mob rule and the group declined defending Nixon&#x27;s conduct. Thurmond opined that Nixon was &quot;the only President we have&quot; and questioned why Congress would want to weaken his hand in negotiating with other countries. In August, &quot;Newsweek&quot; published a list by the White House including Thurmond as one of thirty-six senators that the administration believed would support President Nixon in the event of his impeachment and being brought to trial by the Senate. Nixon resigned on August 9 in light of near-certain impeachment.

Throughout the 1970s, Thurmond took several actions against the Soviet Union. In June 1974, Senator Henry M. Jackson informed Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee John C. Stennis that he had arranged for Thurmond to cosponsor an amendment revising the present export control system and restricting trade with the Soviet Union while granting the Defense Secretary power to veto any export that might &quot;significantly increase the military capability&quot; of either the Soviet Union or other Communist countries. In June 1975, as the Senate weighed a reduction in a $25 billion weapons procurement measure and to delete research funds to improve the accuracy and power of intercontinental ballistic missiles and warheads, Thurmond and Harry F. Byrd Jr. warned that the Soviet Union was attempting an increase on its missile accuracy and advocated for the United States to follow suit with its own missiles. Later that month, Thurmond and Jesse Helms wrote to President Ford requesting he meet with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn ahead of a speech on June 30 during an AFL–CIO dinner. The White House responded that Ford was too busy to meet with Solzhenitsyn, while later sources indicate Ford declined the meeting at the counsel of his advisors. In December 1979, Thurmond was one of ten senators on the Senate Armed Services Committee to sign a report urging President Carter to delay the vote on a proposed treaty between the US and Soviet Union to limit nuclear arms.

=== Late 1970s ===
In the 1976 Republican primary, President Ford faced a challenge from former California Governor Ronald Reagan, who selected Richard Schweiker as his running mate. Though Thurmond backed Reagan&#x27;s candidacy, he, along with North Carolina Senator Jesse Helms, led efforts to oust Schweiker from the ticket. During the subsequent general election, Thurmond appeared in a campaign commercial for incumbent U.S. President Gerald Ford in his race against Thurmond&#x27;s fellow Southerner, former Georgia Governor Jimmy Carter. In the commercial, Thurmond said Ford (who was born in Nebraska and spent most of his life in Michigan) &quot;sound[ed] more like a Southerner than Jimmy Carter&quot;. After President-elect Carter nominated Theodore C. Sorensen as his choice to become Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, Thurmond expressed reservations and fellow Senator Jake Garn said he believed Thurmond would not vote for the nomination. Sorensen withdrew from consideration days later, before a vote could be had.

In 1974, Thurmond and Democrat John L. McClellan wrote a resolution to continue American sovereignty by the Panama Canal and zone. Thurmond stated that the rhetoric delivered by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger suggested that the &quot;Canal Zone is already Panamanian territory and the only question involved is the transfer of jurisdiction.&quot; In the late 1970s, Thurmond advocated for forging a new relationship with Panama but against the U.S. giving up sovereignty to the Canal Zone. Thurmond doubted Panama&#x27;s ability to govern alone: &quot;There is no way that a Panamanian government could be objective about the administration of an enterprise so large in comparison to the rest of the national enterprise, public and private.&quot; In late August 1977, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote &quot;President Carter can be grateful that the opposition to his compromise Panama treaty is now being led by Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina and Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina.&quot; Speaking on the Panama Canal neutrality treaty, Thurmond said it was &quot;the big giveaway of the century.&quot; The treaty was ratified by the Senate on March 16, 1978.

In his general election campaign, Thurmond faced Charles Ravenel, a local banker and former gubernatorial candidate. Ravenel charged Thurmond with not standing up for South Carolina&#x27;s educational needs and having been behind the lack of funding. Thurmond responded to the charges by stating that he thought the state had made advancements in its education system. Thurmond and Ravenel made a joint appearance in April, where Thurmond discussed his position on a variety of issues. The higher amount of African-Americans voting in elections was taken into account by the Ravenel campaign, which sought to gain this group of voters by reviving interest in older statements by Thurmond. In his courting of black voters, Thurmond was noted to have not undergone &quot;any ideological transformation&quot; but instead devoted himself to making personal contact with members of the minority group. Thurmond&#x27;s influence in national politics allowed him to have correspondence with staffers from the Nixon administration which gave him &quot;a unique advantage in announcing federal grants and bird-dogging federal projects of particular interest to black voters.&quot; By May 1978, Thurmond held a 30-point lead over Ravenel among double digits of undecided voters. Thurmond won a sixth term with 351,733 votes to Ravenel&#x27;s 281,119. The race would later be assessed as the last serious challenge to Thurmond during his career.

In March 1979, after the Carter administration made an appeal to Congress for new powers to aid with the enforcement of federal laws as it pertains to housing discrimination, Thurmond refused to back the administration as he charged it with &quot;injecting itself in every facet of people&#x27;s lives&quot; and said housing disputes should be settled in court. In July, as the Senate weighed voting on the nomination of Assistant Attorney General Patricia M. Wald to the United States Court of Appeals in Washington, Thurmond joined Paul Laxalt and Alan Simpson in recording their opposition. Later that month, Thurmond asked Attorney General nominee Benjamin R. Civiletti if President Carter had made him give a pledge of loyalty or an assurance of complete independence. In September, the Senate Judiciary Committee approved 30 of President Carter&#x27;s nominees, the closest vote being waged against Abner J. Mikva, who the president had nominated for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Thurmond was one of the five Republicans to vote against Mikva. In November, President Carter nominated José A. Cabranes to fill a vacancy on the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. Thurmond submitted a series of written questions to Cabranes, whose answers were credited with clarifying his views on issues. Cabranes was confirmed for the position.

Thurmond demonstrated several instances of bipartisanship with Democrats and President Carter. In May 1977, Thurmond made a joint appearance with President Carter in the Rose Garden in a show of unified support for proposed foreign intelligence surveillance legislation. Thurmond stated he had become convinced the legislation was needed from his service on the Armed Services Committee, the Judiciary Committee and the Intelligence Committee the previous year and lauded the bill for concurrently protecting the rights of Americans, as a warrant would have to be obtained from a judge in order to fulfill any inquiries. In July 1979, after the Carter administration unveiled a proposed governing charter for the FBI, Thurmond stated his support for its enactment, his backing being seen by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as an indication that the governing charter would face little conservative opposition. In September, the Senate approved Bailey Brown as Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The nomination was one of the few votes in which Thurmond and Ted Kennedy joined forces in confirming. In October, President Carter signed the Federal Magistrate Act of 1979, an expansion of the jurisdiction of American magistrates in regards to civil and criminal cases. Carter noted Thurmond as one of the members of Congress who had shown leadership on the measure, without whose efforts it would have never passed.

=== Early 1980s ===
In December 1979, Thurmond endorsed the presidential campaign of former Governor of Texas John Connally. In an election cycle that also featured Reagan, Thurmond chose to back Connally because he believed the latter&#x27;s wide government experience would benefit the U.S. in both domestic and foreign matters. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted Thurmond seeming &quot;to cast himself for a role of regional leadership in the Connally campaign similar to the one he played in 1968&quot; for the Nixon campaign. After Connally lost the South Carolina primary to Reagan, he thanked Thurmond and his wife for doing more to support his campaign in the state than anyone else. In August 1980, Thurmond gave a &quot;tense cross examination&quot; of President Carter&#x27;s brother, Billy Carter, who had come under scrutiny for his relationship with Libya and receiving funds from the country. The Billy Carter controversy also was favored by Democrats wishing to replace Carter as the party&#x27;s nominee in the general election. Thurmond questioned Carter over his prior refusal to disclose the amount of funds he had received from public appearances after the 1976 Presidential election, and stated his skepticism with some of the points made.

After Republicans won a majority in the 1980 Senate election, Thurmond pledged that he would seek a death penalty law, and stated his conviction that &quot;the death penalty is a deterrent to crime&quot; in an interview the following year. Following the presidential election, Thurmond and North Carolina senator Jesse Helms sponsored a Senate amendment to a Department of Justice appropriations bill denying the department the power to participate in busing, due to objections over federal involvement, but, although passed by Congress, was vetoed by a lame duck Carter. In December 1980, Thurmond met with President-elect Reagan and recommended former South Carolina governor James B. Edwards for United States Secretary of Energy in the incoming administration. Reagan later named Edwards Energy Secretary, and the latter served in that position for over a year. In January 1981, after the Justice Department revealed it was carrying out a suit against Charleston County for school officials declining to propose a desegregation method for its public schools, Thurmond theorized the Justice Department&#x27;s decision may have been due to South Carolina not supporting President Carter in the general election, and stated his intent to have the incoming Reagan administration to look into the facts of the case before proceeding.
Thurmond became President pro tempore of the U.S. Senate in 1981, and was part of the U.S. delegation to the funeral of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, Thurmond being accompanied by Sadat&#x27;s pen pal Sam Brown. At the beginning of Reagan&#x27;s term, Thurmond as the new chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the new president were seen as obstacles to any gun laws passing in the Senate. Thurmond publicly stated his belief that any measures introduced would be defeated in his committee. After the March assassination attempt on President Reagan, Thurmond stated his support for legislation imposing a ban on the gun components on a seven-point anti-crime program. He indicated his backing would only be in favor of passing measures to restrict criminals accessing guns and his announcement was seen as possibly indicating a change in the debate of regulations relating to firearms in the U.S. Thurmond also announced plans to hold hearings on the seven-point proposal intended to address the questions surrounding the Reagan assassination attempt.

Thurmond and Helms urged President Reagan to curb textile imports, with Thurmond saying later that year that the first four months of 1981 had seen a 16 percent increase in textile imports &quot;over a similar period in 1980.&quot; President Reagan pledged in a letter to Thurmond to help South Carolina textile mills against their foreign competitors. President Reagan stated his support for tightening control of textile imports, and the following year, vetoed H.R. 1562. Thurmond responded to the decision by stating that Reagan had heeded bad advice and added that the veto would produce &quot;more layoffs, more plant shutdowns and more long-term economic damage to an industry that is crucial to this nation.&quot; In late 1981, Thurmond presided over the hearings of Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, who President Reagan had nominated for associate justice. Thurmond granted Alabama Senator Jeremiah Denton an hour of questioning of O&#x27;Connor, twice the time allotted for other members of the chamber. Thurmond stated that O&#x27;Connor was &quot;one of the choice nominees&quot; for the Supreme Court that he had seen in all of his Senate career, and she was confirmed by the Senate. Also in 1981, Thurmond was one of the leaders in opposition to extending the Voting Rights Act, and said parts of the law were discriminatory toward states&#x27; rights as well as too strict toward communities that had adhered to it in the past.

Thurmond was a supporter of the foreign policy of the Reagan administration. In April 1981, Thurmond stated that the U.S. could move some of its West Germany soldiers to the East German and Czechoslovak borders in an attempt to improve both morale and combat readiness. In October 1983, Thurmond announced his support for the United States invasion of Grenada, saying American efforts with other countries were &quot;providing an opportunity for Grenadan citizens to regain control over their lives&quot; and the U.S. would be forced to watch centuries of progress crumble if the country was unwilling to make sacrifices. Thurmond voted against the Senate resolution declaring that American troops in Grenada would be &quot;withdrawn no more than 60 days later unless Congress authorized their continued presence there&quot;. President Reagan sent Thurmond a letter containing a report in line with the War Powers Resolution. Thurmond said the &quot;ruling junta in Grenada&quot; was directly threatening American lives.

In December 1984, as the United States and Israel moved to negotiate a free-trade pact where tariffs between the two countries would eventually be wiped out following the Reagan administration receiving congressional approval to negotiate such an agreement, Thurmond wrote a letter to United States trade representative Bill Brock calling on Brock to &quot;reformulate&quot; the negotiating position of the US as the senator had been informed by his aides that the American position in the negotiation was &quot;more generous&quot; than the one specified to Congress. Brock replied to Thurmond weeks later, asserting that he had &quot;every intention&quot; of fulfilling his commitment to Congress &quot;to take account of the import sensitivity of specific products&quot; in the agreement and that Israel had acknowledged the irregularity of export subsidy programs &quot;with the concept of a free-trade area.&quot;

In 1984, as the Senate voted on a bill granting federal prosecution to weapon-carrying career robbers and giving 15 years of incarceration to those convicted, Thurmond and Democratic Senator Ted Kennedy sponsored an amendment limiting the bill to third-time federal offenders, which passed 77 to 12.

In the 1984 presidential election, Thurmond was cited along with Carroll Campbell and South Carolina Republican Party Director Warren Tompkins by Republicans as the forces binding the Reagan-Bush ticket to South Carolina&#x27;s electoral votes. Thurmond attended President Reagan&#x27;s October 15 re-election campaign speech in the Allied Health Building on the Greenville Technical College campus in Greenville, South Carolina.

Running for a fifth full term in 1984, Thurmond faced his first primary challenge in 20 years, from retired CIA agent Robert Cunningham, and won the Republican nomination on June 12, 1984. The previous year, at a fundraising dinner for Thurmond&#x27;s re-election campaign in Columbia, South Carolina, President Reagan delivered an address both praising Thurmond and noting the similarities in his views and that of the administration. Cunningham charged Thurmond with being a follower who no one could validate the seriousness of as a candidate since he had not been challenged in eighteen years, furthering that the South Carolina Republican Party had been involved with the decline in his opposition. Cunningham said that Thurmond had a &quot;bad track record&quot; and noted his past comments on race, saying that he would not be crushed like Thurmond&#x27;s past opponents and was getting much encouragement in his bid to unseat him. Thurmond addressed the issue of age during the primary, the 81-year-old senator stating that he exercised each day for an hour and a half and that he was in the same shape as a person in their 30s or 40s. Cunningham received less than 6% of the primary vote. Thurmond then defeated Melvin Purvis III in the general election, the latter receiving half of the votes cast for Thurmond. Purvis, noted to have few differences in ideology with Thurmond, cited the latter&#x27;s age as reason to retire him from the Senate.

=== Late 1980s ===
Thurmond&#x27;s support of Reagan&#x27;s judicial nominees continued into the president&#x27;s second term. In 1986, Daniel Anthony Manion, President Reagan&#x27;s choice for the U.S. Court of Appeals in Chicago, answered a question by Thurmond, who cited Manion as &quot;entitled to have a vote by the Senate&quot;, and predicted there were enough votes to confirm him. In 1987, after President Reagan nominated Robert Bork as Associate Justice on the Supreme Court, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted Thurmond as &quot;one of Bork&#x27;s key supporters on the Judiciary Committee.&quot; Following Bork&#x27;s nomination being rejected by the Senate, Thurmond stated that President Reagan&#x27;s next nominee should be a person not &quot;as controversial&quot; and should be someone from the South.

In June 1985, Thurmond introduced legislation providing stiffer federal penalties for individuals and financial institutions engaged in laundering money earned from activities of illegality. The bill was supported by the Reagan administration in its efforts to expose the financial activities of criminals and was hailed by Thurmond as &quot;an important step in our continuing war on organized crime and those financial institutions and individuals which hide the ill-gotten assets of law-breakers, especially drug traffickers.&quot;

In September 1985, Thurmond was one of eight members of a delegation that met with General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev. In March 1986, after American warplanes took action against Libyan land, Thurmond stated the U.S. &quot;has the right and the duty to protect and defend itself when attacked, as it was today, without provocation.&quot; He opposed statements by the Libyan government that the attacks on U.S. ships occurred in international waters and named Muammar Gaddafi as the individual who had orchestrated the acts of aggression toward the U.S. Thurmond was a supporter of the Nicaragua rebels, saying that support for the group on the part of the United States was central to furthering America&#x27;s view &quot;in freedom and in protecting ourselves against Soviet totalitarianism.&quot; In August 1988, Senator Robert Byrd presented the White House with a modified version of the Democratic proposal on Contra aid. Thurmond responded to the plan by calling it unsatisfactory. A month later, after some members of the Senate gave support to a law that would impose American participation in an international treaty outlawing genocide, Thurmond stated his intent to add a death penalty amendment in the event the bill reached the Senate floor and Democrats charged Thurmond with using parliamentary devices and Senate traditions to prevent a vote. Thurmond dropped the death penalty amendment when Democrats agreed to proceed with the confirmation of Republican judges.

In September 1986, Thurmond sponsored a drug law package that included a provision imposing the death penalty for some drug offenses and federal crimes of &quot;treason, espionage and killing American hostages in a terrorist attack&quot;. A week later, as the Senate opened debate on proposals aimed at ending both the supply of dangerous drugs as well as their demand, Thurmond offered changes to criminal law in the form of amendments that would include imposing the death penalty for drug traffickers guilty of murder and an expansion of the proposal that would add the death penalty for other federal crimes, such as espionage and hostage taking. President Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 on October 27, 1986, noting Thurmond as one of the &quot;real champions in the battle to get this legislation through Congress&quot;.
In November 1987, Thurmond introduced legislation that if enacted would require &quot;alcoholic beverages to carry health warning labels similar to those on cigarettes&quot;, saying the legislation would be effective if it prevented anyone from drinking while being in a compromising position of health. The following year, Thurmond sponsored legislation designed to impose &quot;five rotating warning labels on alcoholic beverages cautioning pregnant women not to drink, warning that alcohol is addictive and can increase the risks of hypertension, liver disease and cancer, that it impairs a person&#x27;s ability to drive a car or operate machinery, and that alcohol consumption can be hazardous in combination with some drugs.&quot;

On February 23, 1988, Thurmond endorsed fellow senator Bob Dole in the Republican presidential primary, acknowledging his previous intent to remain neutral during the nominating process. The Thurmond endorsement served to change the Dole campaign&#x27;s initial plans of skipping the South Carolina primary, where Vice President Bush defeated Dole. The Bush campaign subsequently won other Southern states and the nomination, leading Michael Oreskes to reflect that Dole &quot;was hurt by an endorsement that led him astray.&quot; Following the 1988 Presidential election, George H. W. Bush nominated John Tower for United States Secretary of Defense. After Tower&#x27;s nomination was rejected by the Senate, Thurmond asked, &quot;What does it say when the leader of the free world can&#x27;t get a Cabinet member confirmed?&quot;

In July 1989, when the Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill by Democrat Dennis DeConcini that imposed a ban of three years on sales of several domestic assault weapons, it rejected an amendment by Thurmond that would have substituted the DeConcini bill with the Bush administration&#x27;s anti-crime package, which did not include a ban on rifles produced in the United States. Failure to implement the Thurmond amendment was seen as &quot;a preliminary test of Senate support for extending President Bush&#x27;s ban on foreign-made assault weapons to domestic makes&quot; and a loss for the National Rifle Association of America which had previously protested banning domestic assault weapons. In August, after the Senate Judiciary Committee voted evenly on the nomination of William C. Lucas for Assist Attorney General for Civil Rights and thereby terminated the nomination that required a majority to proceed to the entirety of the chamber, Thurmond noted the different forms of segregation in the North and South and added that &quot;black people didn&#x27;t have the chance in either place that they should have had. Now&#x27;s the chance to give them a chance.&quot; Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Joe Biden refuted Thurmond&#x27;s argument by mentioning that Senate critics of Lucas were civil rights supporters who had a problem with his lack of qualifications. In September, Thurmond was one of nine Republican senators appointed by Senate Republican leader Robert Dole to negotiate a dispute with Democrats over financing of President Bush&#x27;s anti-drug plan.

=== 1990s and 2000s ===

Thurmond launched his campaign for an eighth term on February 12, 1990, citing that he had never before felt &quot;a stronger obligation to continue my work for the future of our state and our nation.&quot; Thurmond, then age 87, billed himself as having the health of a man in his fifties. The South Carolina Democratic Party faced difficulty recruiting a candidate which they believed had a chance of defeating Thurmond. In the general election, Thurmond defeated retired intelligence officer Bob Cunningham, who had been his Republican primary opponent in 1984. (Cunningham had switched parties in 1990.)

In early 1990, Thurmond sponsored a crime bill concurrent with another measure of the same intent, his version receiving the support of President Bush. Thurmond charged the Democratic proposal with aiding criminals and furthering the loss of rights on the part of victims. In June, the bill was nearly doomed following a procedural vote that forced Senate leaders to work toward modifying its provisions. Thurmond proposed that his fellow senators accept portions of the bill that the Senate had already passed including provisions expanding the number of federal crimes for which the death penalty could apply from 23 to 30 and restrictions on the number of appeals a condemned inmate may file in Federal courts, and the ban on the sale and manufacture of nine types of semiautomatic weapons. In 1992, the Senate voted on an anti-crime bill, Thurmond predicting that it would not pass due to what he considered its lack of strength: &quot;This weak bill expands the rights of criminals. It is a fraud. It is a sham.&quot; He stated that President Bush had told him in advance of his intent to veto the bill if it passed.

After President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas for Associate Justice, Thomas visited Thurmond and stated that he had been fortunate as a result of the Civil Rights Movement assisting him in getting out of poverty, a departure from his previous position of African-Americans achieving success through hard work and individual initiative. &quot;The New York Times&quot; observed, &quot;Judge Thomas&#x27;s remarks in Mr. Thurmond&#x27;s office were not in response to reporters&#x27; specific questions and were clearly intended to rebut critics, including some by members of civil rights organizations, who say he should not be confirmed because of his vociferous opposition to affirmative action and racial quotas in hiring.&quot; In September, as Thomas appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Thurmond interrupted a line of questioning by Howard Metzenbaum to defend Thomas against a complaint that Thomas had answered questions about cases except for abortion. Thurmond voted for Thomas&#x27;s confirmation, and the latter was confirmed by the Senate in October 1991.

Thurmond became the head of the Armed Services Committee following the 1994 Republican Revolution, in which the Republican Party gained eight seats in the Senate and gained a majority in both chambers. According to Thurmond, he had survived &quot;a little power play&quot; orchestrated by fellow Republicans to continue serving as Chairman. In December, after President Clinton&#x27;s announcement that he would seek a $25 billion increase in defense spending over the following six years, Thurmond called it a correct move but one which validated claims that the president had hastily cut the Pentagon budget. In late 1995, Thurmond joined a bipartisan coalition of politicians in supporting a petition intending &quot;to loosen the rules governing the prescription drug methylphenidate&quot;. The drug is commonly known by the brand name Ritalin.

In his 1996 re-election campaign, Thurmond received primary opposition from Harold G. Worley and Charlie Thompson, and the question of age appeared again, given that he was 93 years old at the time. Thurmond remarked that the issue was the only one expressed by members of the press, even as polls showed &quot;that the vast majority of South Carolinians believe it is far past time for him to retire.&quot; Worley stated that the issue of age should be dealt with in the primary as opposed to the general election, encouraging Thurmond to be dropped as the seat&#x27;s continuous nominee. In the general election, Thurmond received 53.4 percent of the vote to the 44 percent of Democrat Elliott Springs Close.

On December 5, 1996, Thurmond became the oldest serving member of the U.S. Senate, and on May 25, 1997, the longest-serving member (41 years and 10 months), casting his 15,000th vote in September 1998. In the following month, when astronaut and fellow Senator John Glenn was to embark on the &quot;Discovery&quot; at age 77, Thurmond, who was his senior by 19 years, reportedly sent him a message saying; &quot;I want to go too.&quot; On October 17, 1998, President Bill Clinton signed the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 into law, an authorization of &quot;appropriations for military activities of the Department of Defense, military construction, and defense activities of the Department of Energy.&quot; Clinton stated that the bill being named after Thurmond was a &quot;well-deserved and appropriate tribute&quot; due to his thirty-six years in the U.S. Army Reserve and his primary focus in the Senate being on U.S. national defense.

In February 1999, Thurmond introduced legislation barring health messages on wine bottles, the measure intended to reverse what he called &quot;erroneous and irresponsible&quot; action of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. The legislation transferred authority over labeling to the Department of Health and Human Services from the Treasury Department and increased taxes on wine. On May 26, 1999, the Senate voted on an amendment to a spending bill exonerating Husband E. Kimmel and Walter C. Short of charges of failing to anticipate the attack on Pearl Harbor that led to American involvement in World War II. Thurmond was noted as one of five Senate members to have been a World War II veteran and back the measure and called Kimmel and Short &quot;the last victims&quot; of Pearl Harbor. In January 2001, Thurmond endorsed his son Strom Thurmond Jr. for federal prosecutor in South Carolina in a recommendation to the Senate.
In March, Thurmond voted for an amendment to the campaign finance reform bill of John McCain and Russ Feingold. Thurmond had initially opposed the measure and changed his vote at the last minute.

Thurmond&#x27;s 100th birthday was celebrated on December 5, 2002. Some remarks made by Mississippi Senator Trent Lott during the event were considered racially insensitive: &quot;I want to say this about my state: When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we [Mississippi] voted for him. We&#x27;re proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn&#x27;t have had all these problems over all these years, either.&quot; Fifteen days later, on December 20, Lott resigned as the Senate Republican leader effective on January 3, 2003, the beginning of the next congressional session. Thurmond left the Senate in January 2003 as the United States&#x27; longest-serving senator, a record later surpassed by Senator Robert Byrd. Thurmond was succeeded by then-Representative and fellow Republican Lindsey Graham.

=== Health ===
Toward the end of Thurmond&#x27;s Senate career, critics suggested his mental abilities had declined. His supporters argued that, while he lacked physical stamina due to his age, mentally he remained aware and attentive, and maintained a very active work schedule, showing up for every floor vote. He stepped down as Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee at the beginning of 1999, as he had pledged to do in late 1997. Retrospectively, a Senate aide stated that &quot;for his last ten years, Thurmond didn&#x27;t know if he was on foot or on horseback&quot;, while a 2020 &quot;New Yorker&quot; article stated that he was &quot;widely known&quot; by the end of his career to be &quot;non compos mentis&quot;.

In August 1999, Thurmond underwent surgery for an enlarged prostate. In September, he was admitted to the Walter Reed Army Medical Center for tests. In October 2000, Thurmond collapsed while lunching with a staff member and an acquaintance at a restaurant in Alexandria, Virginia, and was admitted to Walter Reed; his spokeswoman Genevieve Erny stated that the collapse was found to have been unrelated to previous illnesses. On the morning of October 2, 2001, Thurmond was admitted to Walter Reed after fainting at his Senate desk. He was accompanied in the ambulance by fellow Republican and retired heart transplant surgeon Bill Frist.

==Personal life==
Thurmond was married twice and fathered five children.

===First daughter with Carrie Butler===

Six months after Thurmond&#x27;s death in 2003, Essie Mae Washington-Williams (19252013) publicly revealed she was his daughter. She was born on October 12, 1925, to Carrie &quot;Tunch&quot; Butler (1909 or 19101948), who had worked for Thurmond&#x27;s parents and was 15 or 16 years old when she gave birth.

Essie Mae Washington was raised by her maternal aunt and uncle, and was not told that Thurmond was her father until she was in high school, when she met him for the first time. She later married, took on the last name Washington-Williams, had a family, and retired as a Los Angeles Unified School District elementary school teacher with a master&#x27;s degree. Though the Thurmond family never publicly acknowledged Washington-Williams as his daughter while he was alive, he helped pay her way through a historically black college in South Carolina and continued to give her financial support well into her adult life. Washington-Williams said she did not reveal she was Thurmond&#x27;s daughter during his lifetime because it &quot;wasn&#x27;t to the advantage of either one of us&quot;. She kept silent out of respect for her father and denied the two had agreed she would not reveal her connection to him.

After Washington-Williams came forward, the Thurmond family attorney acknowledged her parentage. Her name has been added to those of his other children on a monument to Thurmond installed at the statehouse grounds. Many close friends, staff members, and South Carolina residents had long suspected that Washington-Williams was Thurmond&#x27;s daughter, as they had noted his interest in her. As a young woman, she was granted a degree of access to Thurmond more typical of a family member than a member of the public.

Washington-Williams later said she intended to join the Daughters of the American Revolution, and did apply to join the United Daughters of the Confederacy, as she was eligible through her Thurmond ancestry. Thurmond was a member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a similar group for men. Her UDC application was not approved while she was alive.

Washington-Williams died on February 4, 2013, in Columbia, South Carolina, at age 87.

===First marriage===
Thurmond was 44 when he married his first wife, Jean Crouch (1926–1960), in the South Carolina Governor&#x27;s mansion on November 7, 1947. In April 1947, when Crouch was a senior at Winthrop College, Thurmond was a judge in a beauty contest in which she was selected as Miss South Carolina. In June, upon her graduation, Thurmond hired her as his personal secretary. On September 13, 1947, Thurmond proposed marriage by calling Crouch to his office to take a dictated letter. The letter was to her, and contained his proposal of marriage. Crouch died of a brain tumor in 1960 at age 33; they had no children.

===Second marriage===
Thurmond married his second wife, Nancy Janice Moore, on December 22, 1968. He was 66 years old and she was 22. She had won Miss South Carolina in 1965. Two years later, he hired her to work in his Senate office. Although Nancy did not particularly enjoy politics, she nevertheless became a popular figure on Capitol Hill. At age 68 in 1971, Thurmond fathered the first of four children with Nancy, who was then 25. Thurmond and Nancy&#x27;s children are: Nancy Moore Thurmond (1971–1993), a beauty pageant contestant who was killed by a drunk driver; James Strom Thurmond Jr. (b. 1972), a former U.S. Attorney for the District of South Carolina and Solicitor for the 2nd Judicial District of South Carolina. Juliana Whitmer (b. 1974), and Paul Reynolds Thurmond (b. 1976), a former South Carolina State Senator.

Thurmond&#x27;s children remained in South Carolina with relatives, and Nancy commuted back and forth to Washington. Thurmond and Nancy separated in March 1991, after Nancy claimed that they no longer had a real marriage, stating &quot;At this point in my life I would like to be able to pursue several career options and some measure of independence.&quot; She returned to South Carolina, where their children were living. Although Nancy casually dated other men during the early stages of the separation, neither she nor her husband considered divorce, and they reportedly remained close. It was alleged that she spoke with her husband several times each day, and he stayed at her house several times each month, whenever he returned to South Carolina. They continued attending events together. They were also reported as estranged in 1996, when Nancy was facing trial for drunk driving. In 2001, they were still reported to be estranged when Nancy refused an offer to succeed Thurmond in the U.S. Senate.

===Sexual misconduct allegations===
According to NBC News in 2017, it was widely acknowledged around Congress that Thurmond inappropriately touched women throughout his career. Thurmond&#x27;s colleague, Senator Patty Murray, stated that in early 1994, Thurmond, then 91, tried to fondle her breast in an elevator. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Thurmond had been known for fondling women in Senate elevators, and did not realize Murray was a fellow senator. The alleged incident prompted a statement from Thurmond&#x27;s office, saying that he had not engaged in any inappropriate behavior, and that he was showing gentlemanly courtesy by assisting Murray into the elevator. Female Senate staffers from the late 1980s and early 1990s recalled that Thurmond was on an informal list of male senators who were known for harassing women regularly, such as while alone in elevators.

Political reporter Cokie Roberts said in 2017 that Thurmond kissed her on the mouth, while she was live on the air at a political convention. Roberts stated that Thurmond &quot;was in a category of his own&quot; when it came to politicians and sexual harassment.

==Death==
Thurmond died from complications of old age in his sleep at 9:45 p.m. on June 26, 2003, at a hospital in his hometown of Edgefield, South Carolina. He was 100 years old. After lying in state in the rotunda of the South Carolina State House in Columbia, his body was carried on a caisson to the First Baptist Church for services, at which then-Senator Joe Biden of Delaware delivered a eulogy, and later to the family burial plot in Willowbrook Cemetery in Edgefield, where he was interred.

==Electoral history==
==Legacy==
Diane Norman of the &quot;Spartanburg Herald-Journal&quot; called Thurmond &quot;a political icon depicted in life-size statues in Columbia and Edgefield and whose name graces seven public buildings, a shopping mall, a high school, a National Guard armory, a lake, a dam and an interstate highway.&quot; Former &quot;Slate&quot; senior writer Timothy Noah wrote that Thurmond&#x27;s most significant political contribution was his backing of segregation and myths had been construed on the part of his contemporaries to explain his continued wielding of national influence. South Carolina Representative Joe Wilson referred to Thurmond as South Carolina&#x27;s greatest statesman in the 20th century.

&quot;Time&quot; writes that Thurmond&#x27;s party switch &quot;marked the beginning of the GOP&#x27;s appeal to white, Southern conservatives, and helped turn a former blue state red.&quot; It has been argued that Thurmond&#x27;s backing of Nixon in the 1968 election served as the basis for the Southern strategy, with former Thurmond aide Lee Atwater admitting that the race served as the &quot;blueprint for everything&quot; he did in subsequent elections. Thurmond adviser Harry Dent said

He played the key and strategic role in pioneering and paving the way for that change. Presidential politics have been changed by Strom Thurmond and what he did more than by anybody in this country in these recent years.

In 1997, future Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called Thurmond &quot;somebody I have heard about, observed and admired all of my life.&quot;

=== Cultural and political image ===
Both Thurmond and his 1948 presidential campaign have been described as racist, and he has been called &quot;one of the most notorious segregationists in history&quot;. In 1968, &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Thurmond as &quot;a South Carolina maverick with a highly developed taste for lost causes&quot;. &quot;The Oklahoman&quot; wrote that he would anger Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson because he could not be controlled and the key to Thurmond&#x27;s longevity was his prioritizing of his constituents&#x27; concerns being addressed.

By the 1970s, Thurmond had helped establish scholarships for black students at four South Carolina colleges and his influence in federal bureaucracy gave him an advantage in &quot;announcing federal grants and bird-dogging federal projects of particular interest to black voters.&quot;
Thurmond received black support in his 1978 re-election and African Americans were noted to &quot;praise their onetime nemesis as a driving force behind the influx of more federal dollars to the state&#x27;s minority neighborhoods.&quot; Jim Naughton of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; found Thurmond to have &quot;transformed his own image from radical to pragmatist, from The Whitest Man in America to Uncle Strom, Our Friend in Washington.&quot;
Nevertheless, Thurmond&#x27;s racially charged language during the earlier part of his career left him with a mixed reputation among African Americans, receiving only 20% of their vote in his last election in 1996. NAACP Chairman Julian Bond said Thurmond&#x27;s sole legacy was of &quot;durability and opposition to civil rights&quot; and called Thurmond &quot;a relic of America&#x27;s shameful past, who had long overstayed his welcome.&quot; In 2003, political scientist Willie Leggett stated, &quot;Thurmond is not going to be a hero for black people because he never became a proponent of black rights.&quot;

In 1980, Bill Peterson remarked that the 77-year-old Thurmond &quot;still has that rare peculiar magic few politicians ever achieve&quot; with young autograph seekers and admirers. Peterson stressed, however, that Thurmond&#x27;s popularity was &quot;being put to a severe test&quot; in his efforts to help John Connally win the South Carolina primary.

By the time of his last campaign in 1996, Thurmond faced increased focus to his age and calls for his retirement. Thurmond opened his final campaign in a speech at the University of South Carolina-Aiken, proclaiming that he would not give up on &quot;our mission to right the 40-year wrongs of liberalism&quot; and that South Carolinians knew he did not like &quot;unfinished business.&quot; As the 107th United States Congress began, the Democrats and Republicans were split evenly with Vice President Dick Cheney as the tie-breaking vote, and Thurmond&#x27;s attendance was seen as crucial for maintaining a Republican majority given that his retirement or death would allow Democratic governor Jim Hodges to appoint a Democrat to his seat. Thurmond spokeswoman Genevieve Erny commented, &quot;It&#x27;s unfortunate that the media continue to portray him as in failing health, especially because the only reason the media is interested is a 50-50 split, and the repercussions that could have.&quot; In a 2001 interview, colleague Fritz Hollings said that Thurmond was no longer &quot;mentally keen&quot; nor did he &quot;have a home, and someone has said the best nursing home is the U.S. Senate.&quot;
Ira Shapiro of &quot;The Gazette&quot; cited Thurmond by the end of his tenure as &quot;a joke and an embarrassment; virtually unable to speak or hear, he had to be carried into committee meetings.&quot;

After his retirement, Thurmond&#x27;s early career and those of slave owner John C. Calhoun and Benjamin Tillman were cited as political symbols of South Carolina&#x27;s historical racism and denial of basic civil rights to minority groups.
In 2011, Public Policy Polling found Thurmond to be the most popular politician in South Carolina, with higher favorability ratings than current lawmakers Lindsey Graham, Nikki Haley, Jim DeMint, and Mark Sanford.

<text>Michif (also Mitchif, Mechif, Michif-Cree, Métif, Métchif, French Cree) is one of the languages of the Métis people of Canada and the United States, who are the descendants of First Nations (mainly Cree, Nakota, and Ojibwe) and fur trade workers of white ancestry (mainly French). Michif emerged in the early 19th century as a mixed language and adopted a consistent character between about 1820 and 1840.

Michif combines Cree and Métis French (Rhodes 1977, Bakker 1997:85), a variety of Canadian French, with some additional borrowing from English and indigenous languages of the Americas such as Ojibwe and Assiniboine. In general, Michif noun phrase phonology, lexicon, morphology, and syntax are derived from Métis French, while verb phrase phonology, lexicon, morphology, and syntax are from a southern variety of Plains Cree (a western dialect of Cree). Articles and adjectives are also of Métis French origin but demonstratives are from Plains Cree.

The Michif language is unusual among mixed languages, in that rather than forming a simplified grammar, it developed by incorporating complex elements of the chief languages from which it was born. French-origin noun phrases retain lexical gender and adjective agreement; Cree-origin verbs retain much of their polysynthetic structure. This suggests that instead of haltingly using words from another&#x27;s tongue, the people who gradually came to speak Michif were fully fluent in both French and Cree.

The Michif language was first brought to scholarly attention in 1976 by John Crawford at the University of North Dakota. Much of the subsequent research on Michif was also related to UND, including four more pieces by Crawford, plus work by Evans, Rhodes, and Weaver.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Michif&quot; is from a variant pronunciation of the French word . Some Métis people prefer this word (&quot;Michif&quot;) to describe their nationality when speaking English and use it for anything related to Métis people, including any languages they happen to speak. According to the Gabriel Dumont Institute (GDI), the word &quot;Michif&quot;, when used for a language, is used to describe at least three distinct types of speech. Northern Michif (in Saskatchewan) is essentially a variety of Cree with a small number of French loanwords. Michif French is a variety of Canadian French with some Cree loanwords and syntax (word order). &quot;Michif&quot; used without any qualification can also describe the mixed language which borrows heavily from both Cree and French. According to theories of self-determination and self-identification, the GDI refers to all of these speech varieties as &quot;Michif&quot; because many Métis community members use the term that way, even though these varieties are widely different in their linguistic details. The remainder of this article deals primarily with the mixed language that has many features from both French and Cree.

== History ==

=== Language genesis ===
In languages of mixed ethnicities, the language of the mother usually provides the grammatical system, while the language of the father provides the lexicon. The reasons are as follows: children tend to know their mother&#x27;s language better; in the case of the Métis, the men were often immigrants, whereas the women were native to the region. If the bilingual children need to use either of their parents&#x27; languages to converse with outsiders, it is most likely to be the language of their mothers. Thus, the model of language-mixing predicts that Michif should have a Cree grammatical system and French lexicon. Michif, however, has Cree verb phrases and French noun phrases. The explanation for this unusual distribution of Cree and French elements in Michif lies in the polysynthetic nature of Cree morphology. In Cree, verbs can be very complex with up to twenty morphemes, incorporated nouns and unclear boundaries between morphemes. In other words, in Cree verbs it is very difficult to separate grammar from lexicon. As a result, in Michif the grammatical and bound elements are almost all Cree, and the lexical and free elements are almost all French; verbs are almost totally Cree, because the verb consists of grammatical and bound elements. Seen in this way, it can be argued that Michif is fundamentally Cree, but with heavy French borrowing (somewhat like Maltese, a mixed Arabic-Italian language classified as fundamentally Arabic). The Métis in addition have their own variety of French with Cree borrowings – Métis French.

==== Language genesis from Michif people ====
The genesis of the Michif peoples and language has been passed through generations. The story of the creation of the Michif people and their language was told to Elder Brousse Flammand (currently the president of the Michif kaa-piikishkwaychik, or Michif Speakers Association) by his grandparents (born 1876 and 1886). The information he gives is also told by other Michif speakers, who agree that the language was given to the Michif peoples by the Creator/God. He states that the genesis of the Michif person/nation is synonymous with the genesis of the Michif language. Both the language and the nation are creations of the Creator/God— and are symbiotic to each other. 

The creation of a specific language for Metis people allowed for a collective identity, where Michif speakers could take action together to protect traditional territories and homelands, and share a collective history. 

=== Usage ===
In 2021, the number of Michif speakers in Canada was reported to be 1,845. However, the number of fluent Michif speakers is estimated at fewer than 1,000. It was probably double or triple this number at the close of the 19th century, but never much higher. Currently, Michif is spoken in scattered Métis communities in the Canadian prairie provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta, and in North Dakota in the U.S.. There are about 50 speakers in Alberta, all over age 60. There are some 230 speakers of Michif in the United States (down from 390 at the 1990 census), most of whom live in North Dakota, particularly in the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. There are around 300 Michif speakers in the Northwest Territories, northern Canada.

=== Loss of language ===
In 2011, Statistics Canada reported 640 Michif speakers located mainly in Saskatchewan (40.6%), Manitoba (26.6%), and Alberta (11.7%). In the cross-reference provided by Statistics Canada, it is shown that of these 640 speakers, only 30 are below 24 years of age. Furthermore, only 85 people declared Michif to be their main home language (45 their sole language); and of these, 65 were 50 or older. Unfortunately, these numbers do not reflect the actual number of speakers of the mixed variety of Michif in Canada, since the statistical survey did not differentiate between regional differences, including Michif Cree, Michif French, or mixed Michif.

In 2021, the number of Michif speakers in Canada was reported to be 1,845. However, the number of fluent Michif speakers is estimated at fewer than 1,000. It was probably double or triple this number at the close of the 19th century, but never much higher. Currently, Michif is spoken in scattered Métis communities in the Canadian prairie provinces of Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and Alberta, and in North Dakota in the U.S.. There are about 50 speakers in Alberta, all over age 60. There are some 230 speakers of Michif in the United States (down from 390 at the 1990 census), most of whom live in North Dakota, particularly in the Turtle Mountain Indian Reservation. There are around 300 Michif speakers in the Northwest Territories, northern Canada.

In Metis communities’, there has been a clear shift towards the European languages. Today, all Michif speakers are also fluent (if not dominant) in English, and Metis adult and youth speak English (or French and English) as their first language(s). The reason why Michif has so few speakers and is in need of active revitalization efforts is a direct result of colonization. Judy Iseke, an Albertan Metis scholar, argues that “language shift towards English and other colonial languages in Indigenous communities was not a ‘natural’ process but rather was a shift towards the decline of Indigenous languages, propelled by colonial schooling designed to ‘civilize’ Indigenous children and turn them into citizens conforming to &#x27;white&#x27; standards.&quot;

=== Language revitalization ===
Revitalizing the Michif language is important to Métis people. Language is regarded as culturally significant and holds more value than just the attributes studied by linguists. Elder Brousse Flammand writes &quot;Language is central to nationhood&quot; and that &quot;A government cannot legislate this identity and nationhood; the government can only recognize what is already in existence.&quot; Michif was (and is) central to the independent culture and nationhood of the Métis people. The Métis community is working toward language revitalization to keep this connection to their independent culture and nationhood.

Métis cultural centres such as the Michif Cultural and Métis Resource Institute in St. Albert, Alberta, the Métis Culture and Heritage Resource Centre in Winnipeg, and the Gabriel Dumont Institute of Native Studies and Applied Research are attempting to revive the language through public outreach. Additionally, The Louis Riel Institute (LRI), which is the education department of the Manitoba Metis Federation in Winnipeg, is an adult learning center committed to the development of community based educational programs directed to adults and the whole family. The Institute has released DVD beginner lessons for both Michif and Michif French, which are also available online.

As of 2013, the &quot;Northern Journal&quot; reports that &quot;Aboriginal language and culture is becoming increasingly visible&quot; in Alberta, as Alberta&#x27;s Northland School Division, &quot;serving mostly First Nations and Métis students in the northern part of the province&quot; has expanded its community partnerships and culture camps.

== Phonology ==
Michif as recorded starting in the 1970s combined two separate phonological systems: one for French origin elements, and one for Cree origin elements (Rhodes 1977, 1986). For instance, , , and exist only in French words, whereas preaspirated stops such as and exist only in Cree words. In this variety of Michif, the French elements were pronounced in ways that have distinctively Canadian French values for the vowels, while the Cree elements have distinctively Cree values for vowels. Nonetheless, there is some Cree influence on French words in the stress system (Rosen 2006). But by the year 2000 there were Michif speakers who had collapsed the two systems into a single system (Rosen 2007).

===Consonants===
===Vowels===

Michif has eleven oral vowels and four nasalized vowels.

====Oral vowels====

====Nasalized vowels====

The following four vowels are nasalized in Michif:
* 
* 

===Schwa-deletion===
A schwa /ə/ appearing between two consonants in French-origin words is dropped in Michif. Examples of this process are listed in the table below.

===Elision in Michif===

Rosen (2007) states that since all French-derived vowel-initial nouns in Michif have been lexicalized as consonant-initial, the French rule of elision, which deletes certain vowels (particularly schwa) before vowel-initial words, for ex., &#x27;the friend&#x27; but &#x27;the friend&#x27;), cannot apply in Michif. Curiously, she admits that elision is potentially still active since vowel-initial English loanwords allow elision, as in &#x27;a bowl of oatmeal&#x27;. Papen (2014) has countered that elision is, in fact, just as active in French-derived words as is liaison. For example, he examines Noun + di + Noun constructions (as in vs. &#x27;month of January&#x27; vs. &#x27;month of October&#x27;) and finds that 100% of (from French schwa) are deleted before French-derived vowel-initial nouns. However, elision does not occur before Cree vowel-initial nouns. This strongly suggests that French phonological rules, such as liaison and elision still function in Michif, but that they apply only to French-derived words and not to Cree-derived ones, implying that Michif phonology is at least partially stratified, contrary to what Rosen (2007) proposes.

===Liaison consonants===
In French, a liaison is used to bridge the gap between word-final and word-initial vowel sounds. Whether liaison still exists in Michif is a much discussed theoretical issue. Scholars such as Bakker (1997), Rhodes (1986), and Rosen (2007) have suggested that liaison no longer exists in Michif and that all words that etymologically began with a vowel in French now begin with a consonant, the latter resulting from a variety of sources, including a liaison consonant. Their arguments are based on the fact that the expected liaison consonant (for example, ) will not show up and instead, the consonant will be , as in &#x27;a bear&#x27; The above authors cite over a dozen words with an unexpected initial consonant. Papen (2003, 2014) has countered this argument by showing that, statistically, the vast majority of so-called initial consonants in Michif reflect the expected liaison consonant and that only about 13% of so-called initial consonants are unexpected. Moreover, Papen points out that one of the so-called initial consonant is , which in nearly all cases, represents the elided definite article (from ), in which case it cannot be a liaison consonant, since liaison consonants may not have grammatical or semantic meaning. Thus in a sequence such as the meaning is not simply &#x27;tree&#x27; but &#x27;the tree&#x27;, where initial has the meaning of &#x27;the&#x27;, and is initial only in a phonetic sense, but not in a phonological one, since it represents a distinct morpheme from , and thus must be considered phonologically vowel-initial.

===Palatalization===
The voiced alveolar stop in French-origin words is palatalized to in Michif, as in Acadian French. This may occur word-initially or word-internally before front vowels.

== Orthography ==
Michif lacks a unified spelling standard. Aside from local language differences, lack of a uniform spelling system can be attributed to Michif’s history as an oral language. Generally, Michif-speaking communities spell words as they are pronounced in regional dialects, creating much variation in spelling. Some systems are phonetic, with each letter having only one sound (often based on English standards), while other are etymological, with French-derived words spelled by French standards, and Cree-derived words spelled using the &quot;Standard Roman Orthography&quot; system.

In 2004, Robert Papen proposed a new system that was mostly phonetic.

The government of Manitoba published a translation of its annual report on &quot;The Path to Reconciliation Act&quot; in Michif in June 2017. Its choice of spelling system can be seen in this extract:
Here, as in Papen&#x27;s system, different vowel qualities are marked by writing the character doubled (&quot;a&quot; vs. &quot;aa&quot;) instead of using diacritical marks as usual for Cree. For consistency, this system is also extended to the French-derived words so that French (&#x27;whites&#x27;) becomes but (&#x27;the indigenous&#x27;) becomes .

==Syntax==
===Noun phrase===
Nouns are almost always accompanied by a French-origin determiner or a possessive.

Cree-origin demonstratives can be added to noun phrases, in which case the Cree gender (animate or inanimate) is that of the corresponding Cree noun.

Adjectives are French-origin (Cree has no adjectives), and as in French they are either pre- or postnominal. Prenominal adjectives agree in gender (like French), however, postnominal adjectives do not agree in gender (unlike French).

===Verb phrase===
The verb phrase is that of Plains Cree-origin with little reduction (there are no dubitative or preterit verb forms).

===Word order===
Michif word order is basically that of Cree (relatively free). However, the more French-origin elements are used, the closer the syntax seems to conform to norms of spoken French.

== Vocabulary ==
A comparison of some common words in English, French, Michif, and Cree:
=== Lexicon ===
Nouns: 83–94% French-origin; others are mostly Cree-origin, Ojibwe-origin, or English-originVerbs: 88–99% Cree-originQuestion words: Cree-originPersonal pronouns: CreePostpositions: Cree-originPrepositions: French-originConjunctions: 55% Cree-origin; 40% French-originNumerals: French-originDemonstratives: Cree-origin

<doc id="44649" wikidata="Q62301" url="?curid=44649" title="National parks of New Zealand">
<text>The national parks of New Zealand are protected natural areas administered by the Department of Conservation (DOC). The first national parks established in the country were all focused on mountain scenery. Since the 1980s the focus has been on developing a more diverse representation of New Zealand landscapes. The parks are all culturally significant and many also contain historic features. Tongariro National Park is one of the World Heritage Sites that are of both cultural and natural significance, while four of the South Island national parks form Te Wahipounamu, another World Heritage Site. There are currently 13 national parks; a 14th, Te Urewera National Park, was disestablished in 2014.

The national parks are administered by the Department of Conservation &quot;for the benefit, use, and enjoyment of the public&quot;. They are popular tourist destinations, with three-tenths of overseas tourists visiting at least one national park during their stay in New Zealand.

== Legislation ==
The National Parks Act of 1980 was established in order to codify the purpose, governance and selection of national parks. It begins by establishing the definition of a national park:
The National Parks Act goes on to state that the public will have freedom of entry and access to the parks, though this is subject to restrictions to ensure the preservation of native plants and animals and the welfare of the parks in general. Access to specially protected areas (550 km2) constituted under the act is by permit only.
Under the Act, national parks are to be maintained in their natural state as far as possible to retain their value as soil, water and forest conservation areas. Native plants and animals are to be preserved and introduced plants and animals removed if their presence interferes with the natural wildlife. Development in wilderness areas established under the act is restricted to foot tracks and huts used for wild animal control or scientific research.

===Services available for public use===
The National Parks Act allows the Department of Conservation to provide hostels, huts, camping grounds, ski tows and similar facilities, parking areas, roading and tracks within the parks. In addition to these, the department also provides some accommodation, transport and other services at entry points to the parks, but these are also offered by other government agencies, voluntary organisations and private firms. More comprehensive services within the parks, such as guided walks and skiing tutorials, are privately provided with concessions from the department.

=== 2018 Supreme Court decision ===
In 2018, the Auckland iwi Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki won a case in the Supreme Court, allowing them to apply to the Department of Conservation for exclusive rights for concessions to run commercial operations on Motutapu and Rangitoto islands. The court decision was based on giving effect to principles within the Treaty of Waitangi and recognition that although the islands are administered by the Department of Conservation, Ngāi Tai ki Tāmaki has traditional ownership (&quot;mana whenua&quot;). This decision had implications for the Department of Conservation management plans for the conservation estate, including the National Parks, and led to a pause in the review of the management plans for Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park and Westland Tai Poutini National Park.

==List of national parks==
This table lists the current and former national parks in alphabetical order.


== Timeline ==
==Proposed national parks==
The area centred on Waipoua Forest, north of Dargaville, has been proposed as a possible Kauri National Park. The area contains most of New Zealand&#x27;s remaining kauri, including the largest known kauri, Tāne Mahuta. These stands of kauri are also valuable as havens for endangered species including the North Island brown kiwi. This proposal is currently being investigated by the Department of Conservation.

In response to a DoC proposal to upgrade the protection of Great Barrier Island (Aotea), Forest and Bird launched a campaign in 2014 to designate it as a National Park.

In 2020, the New Zealand National Party announced that they would create two new national parks if elected at the general election, namely Coromandel National Park and Catlins National Park.

==Mining concerns==
In 2010 the New Zealand Government proposed removing some national park and conservation areas from Schedule 4 protection of the Crown Minerals Act which prohibits mining in those areas. In July the government abandoned the proposal after receiving a large number of submissions, most of which opposed mining.

<doc id="44652" wikidata="Q10914750" url="?curid=44652" title="Lazurite">
<text>Lazurite, old name &quot;Azure spar&quot; is a tectosilicate mineral with sulfate, sulfur and chloride with formula . It is a feldspathoid and a member of the sodalite group. Lazurite crystallizes in the isometric system although well‐formed crystals are rare. It is usually massive and forms the bulk of the gemstone lapis lazuli.

==Mineral==
Lazurite is a deep‐blue to greenish‐blue. The colour is due to the presence of  anions. It has a Mohs hardness of 5.0 to 5.5 and a specific gravity of 2.4. It is translucent with a refractive index of 1.50. It is fusible at 3.5 on Wolfgang Franz von Kobell&#x27;s fusibility scale, and soluble in HCl. It commonly contains or is associated with grains of pyrite.

Lazurite is a product of contact metamorphism of limestone and is typically associated with calcite, pyrite, diopside, humite, forsterite, hauyne and muscovite.

Other blue minerals, such as the carbonate mineral, azurite, and the phosphate mineral, lazulite, may be confused with lazurite, but are easily distinguished with careful examination. At one time, lazurite was a synonym for azurite.

Lazurite was first described in 1890 for an occurrence in the Sar-e-Sang District, Koksha Valley, Badakhshan Province, Afghanistan. It has been mined for more than 6,000 years in the lapis lazuli district of Badakhshan. It has been used as a pigment in painting and cloth dyeing since at least the 6th or 7th century. It is also mined at Lake Baikal in Siberia; Mount Vesuvius; Burma; Canada; and the United States. The name is from the Persian for blue.

The most important mineral component of lapis lazuli is lazurite (25% to 40%)

== Redefinition ==
Most lapis lazuli gets its blue color from Hauyne and almost none contain &quot;true lazurite&quot;. This was changed in 2021, as lazurite was redefined so that it is enough for a quarter (instead of half) of the cages to contain sulfide.

== Structure ==
Lazurite and hauyne seem to have the same structure and both are sulfate-dominant minerals. Lazurite is a pigment (opalescent) and has a bright blue streak (especially as a component of the semiprecious stone lapis lazuli). Many hauynes have a white or pale blue streak and are translucent. The difference might be a consequence of the redox state (sulfate to sulfide ratio).

<text>Lapis lazuli (; ), or lapis for short, is a deep-blue metamorphic rock used as a semi-precious stone that has been prized since antiquity for its intense color. Originating from the Persian word for the gem, &quot;lāžward&quot;, lapis lazuli is a rock composed primarily of the minerals lazurite, pyrite and calcite. As early as the 7th millennium BC, lapis lazuli was mined in the Sar-i Sang mines, in Shortugai, and in other mines in Badakhshan province in modern northeast Afghanistan. Lapis lazuli artifacts, dated to 7570 BC, have been found at Bhirrana, which is the oldest site of Indus Valley civilisation. Lapis was highly valued by the Indus Valley Civilisation (3300–1900 BC). Lapis beads have been found at Neolithic burials in Mehrgarh, the Caucasus, and as far away as Mauritania. It was used in the funeral mask of Tutankhamun (1341–1323 BC).

By the end of the Middle Ages, lapis lazuli began to be exported to Europe, where it was ground into powder and made into the pigment ultramarine. Ultramarine was used by some of the most important artists of the Renaissance and Baroque, including Masaccio, Perugino, Titian and Vermeer, and was often reserved for the clothing of the central figures of their paintings, especially the Virgin Mary. Ultramarine has also been found in dental tartar of medieval nuns and scribes, perhaps as a result of licking their painting brushes while producing medieval texts and manuscripts.

==History==

Excavations from Tepe Gawra show that Lapis lazuli was introduced to Mesopotamia approximately in the late Ubaid period, c. 4900–4000 BCE. A traditional understanding was that the lapis was mined some fifteen hundred miles to the east – in Badakhshan. Indeed, the Persian , also written , is commonly interpreted as having an origin in a local place name.

From the Persian, the Arabic is the etymological source of both the English word &quot;azure&quot; (via Old French &quot;azur&quot;) and Medieval Latin , which came to mean &#x27;heaven&#x27; or &#x27;sky&#x27;. To disambiguate, (&quot;stone of &quot;) was used to refer to the stone itself, and is the term ultimately imported into Middle English. is etymologically related to the color blue, and used as a root for the word for blue in several languages, including Spanish and Portuguese .

Mines in northeast Afghanistan continue to be a major source of lapis lazuli. Important amounts are also produced from mines west of Lake Baikal in Russia, and in the Andes mountains in Chile which is the source that the Inca used to carve artifacts and jewelry. Smaller quantities are mined in Pakistan, Italy, Mongolia, the United States, and Canada.

==Science and uses==
===Composition===
The most important mineral component of lapis lazuli is lazurite (25% to 40%), a blue feldspathoid silicate mineral of the sodalite family, with the formula Na7Ca(Al6Si6O24)(SO4)(S3) ·H2O . Most lapis lazuli also contains calcite (white), and pyrite (metallic yellow). Some samples of lapis lazuli contain augite, diopside, enstatite, mica, hauynite, hornblende, nosean, and sulfur-rich löllingite &quot;geyerite&quot;.

Lapis lazuli usually occurs in crystalline marble as a result of contact metamorphism.

===Color===

The intense blue color is due to the presence of the trisulfur radical anion () in the crystal. The presence of disulfur () and tetrasulfur () radicals can shift the color towards yellow or red, respectively. These radical anions substitute for the chloride anions within the sodalite structure. The radical anion exhibits a visible absorption band in the range 595–620 nm with high molar absorptivity, leading to its bright blue color.

===Sources===
Lapis lazuli is found in limestone in the Kokcha River valley of Badakhshan province in north-eastern Afghanistan, where the Sar-i Sang mine deposits have been worked for more than 6,000 years. Afghanistan was the source of lapis for the ancient Persian, Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilizations, as well as the later Greeks and Romans. Ancient Egyptians obtained the material through trade with Mesopotamians, as part of Egypt–Mesopotamia relations. During the height of the Indus Valley civilisation, approximately 2000 BC, the Harappan colony, now known as Shortugai, was established near the lapis mines.

In addition to the Afghan deposits, lapis is also extracted in the Andes (near Ovalle, Chile); and to the west of Lake Baikal in Siberia, Russia, at the Tultui lazurite deposit. It is mined in smaller amounts in Angola, Argentina, Burma, Pakistan, Canada, Italy, India, and in the United States in California and Colorado.

===Uses and substitutes===
Lapis takes an excellent polish and can be made into jewellery, carvings, boxes, mosaics, ornaments, small statues, and vases. Interior items and finishing buildings can be also made with lapis. During the Renaissance, lapis was ground and processed to make the pigment ultramarine for use in frescoes and oil painting. Its usage as a pigment in oil paint largely ended during the early 19th century, when a chemically identical synthetic variety became available.

Lapis lazuli is commercially synthesized or simulated by the Gillson process, which is used to make artificial ultramarine and hydrous zinc phosphates. Spinel or sodalite, or dyed jasper or howlite, can be substituted for lapis.

==History and art==
===In the ancient world===
Lapis lazuli has been mined in Afghanistan and exported to the Mediterranean world and South Asia since the Neolithic age, along the ancient trade route between Afghanistan and the Indus Valley dating to the 7th millennium BC. Quantities of these beads have also been found at 4th millennium BC settlements in Northern Mesopotamia, and at the Bronze Age site of Shahr-e Sukhteh in southeast Iran (3rd millennium BC). A dagger with a lapis handle, a bowl inlaid with lapis, amulets, beads, and inlays representing eyebrows and beards, were found in the Royal Tombs of the Sumerian city-state of Ur from the 3rd millennium BC. 

Lapis was also used in ancient Persia, Mesopotamia by the Akkadians, Assyrians, and Babylonians for seals and jewelry. It is mentioned several times in the Mesopotamian poem, the Epic of Gilgamesh (17th–18th century BC), one of the oldest known works of literature. The Statue of Ebih-Il, a 3rd millennium BC statue found in the ancient city-state of Mari in modern-day Syria, now in the Louvre, uses lapis lazuli inlays for the irises of the eyes.

In ancient Egypt, lapis lazuli was a favorite stone for amulets and ornaments such as scarabs. Lapis jewellery has been found at excavations of the Predynastic Egyptian site Naqada (3300–3100 BC). At Karnak, the relief carvings of Thutmose III (1479–1429 BC) show fragments and barrel-shaped pieces of lapis lazuli being delivered to him as tribute. Powdered lapis was used as eyeshadow by Cleopatra.

Jewelry made of lapis lazuli has also been found at Mycenae attesting to relations between the Myceneans and the developed civilizations of Egypt and the East.

Pliny the Elder wrote that lapis lazuli is &quot;opaque and sprinkled with specks of gold&quot;. Because the stone combines the blue of the heavens and golden glitter of the sun, it was emblematic of success in the old Jewish tradition. In the early Christian tradition lapis lazuli was regarded as the stone of Virgin Mary.

In late classical times and as late as the Middle Ages, lapis lazuli was often called sapphire (&quot;sapphirus&quot; in Latin, &quot;sappir&quot; in Hebrew), though it had little to do with the stone today known as the blue corundum variety sapphire. In his book on stones, the Greek scientist Theophrastus described &quot;the sapphirus, which is speckled with gold,&quot; a description which matches lapis lazuli.
There are many references to &quot;sapphire&quot; in the Old Testament, but most scholars agree that, since sapphire was not known before the Roman Empire, they most likely are references to lapis lazuli. For instance, Exodus 24:10: &quot;And they saw the God of Israel, and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of a sapphire stone...&quot; (KJV). The words used in the Latin Vulgate Bible in this citation are &quot;quasi opus lapidis sapphirini&quot;, the terms for lapis lazuli. Modern translations of the Bible, such as the New Living Translation Second Edition, refer to lapis lazuli in most instances instead of sapphire.

=== Vermeer ===
Johannes Vermeer used lapis lazuli paint, in the &quot;Girl with a Pearl Earring&quot; painting.

=== Yeats ===
The poet, William Butler Yeats, describes a figurine of sculpted lapis lazuli in a poem entitled &quot;Lapis Lazuli&quot;. The sculpture of three men from China, a bird, and a musical instrument serves in the poem as a reminder of &quot;gaiety&quot; in the face of tragedy.

<text>Metis , also known as , is the innermost known moon of Jupiter. It was discovered in 1979 in images taken by &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, and was named in 1983 after the Titaness Metis, the first wife of Zeus and the mother of Athena. Additional observations made between early 1996 and September 2003 by the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft allowed its surface to be imaged.

Metis is tidally locked to Jupiter, and its shape is strongly asymmetrical, with the largest diameter being almost twice as large as the smallest one. It is also one of the two moons known to orbit Jupiter in less than the length of Jupiter&#x27;s day, the other being Adrastea. It orbits within the main ring of Jupiter, and is thought to be a major contributor of ring material.

== Discovery and observations ==
Metis was discovered in 1979 by Stephen P. Synnott in images taken by the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; probe and was provisionally designated as . In 1983, it was officially named after the mythological Metis, a Titaness who was the first wife of Zeus (the Greek prototype for the Roman god Jupiter) who between her and Zeus bore a daughter Athena. The photographs taken by &quot;Voyager 1&quot; showed Metis only as a dot, and hence knowledge about Metis was very limited until the arrival of the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft. &quot;Galileo&quot; imaged almost all of the surface of Metis and put constraints on its composition by 1998.

Although the &quot;Juno&quot; orbiter, which arrived at Jupiter in 2016, has a camera called JunoCam, it is almost entirely focused on observations of Jupiter itself. During close observations of Jupiter, it may capture some distant images of the innermost moons Metis and Adrastea.

== Physical characteristics ==
Metis has an irregular shape and measures across, which makes it the second smallest of the four inner satellites of Jupiter. Therefore, a very rough estimate of its surface area could be placed between 5,800 and 11,600 square kilometers (approx. 8,700). The bulk composition and mass of Metis are not known, but it is likely that its mean density is 1.5 g/cm3 or higher, and its mass can therefore be estimated as ~6.4×1016 kg or higher.

The surface of Metis is heavily cratered, dark, and appears to be reddish in color. There is a substantial asymmetry between the leading and trailing hemispheres: the leading hemisphere is 1.3 times brighter than the trailing one. The asymmetry is probably caused by the higher velocity and frequency of impacts on the leading hemisphere, which excavates a bright material (presumably ice) from its interior.

== Orbit and rotation ==
Metis is the innermost of Jupiter&#x27;s four small inner moons. It orbits Jupiter at a distance of ~128,000 km (1.79 Jupiter radii) within Jupiter&#x27;s main ring. Metis&#x27;s orbit has very small eccentricity (~0.0002) and inclination (~ 0.06°) relative to the equator of Jupiter.

Due to tidal locking, Metis rotates synchronously with its orbital period (about 7 hours), with its longest axis aligned towards Jupiter. Jupiter casts a shadow on all of Metis for 68 minutes each Metian day.

Metis lies inside Jupiter&#x27;s synchronous orbit radius (as does Adrastea), and as a result, tidal forces slowly cause its orbit to decay. If its density is similar to Amalthea&#x27;s, Metis&#x27;s orbit lies within the fluid Roche limit; however, because it has not broken up, it must lie outside its rigid Roche limit.

== Relationship with Jupiter&#x27;s rings ==
Metis&#x27;s orbit lies ~1,000 km within the main ring of Jupiter. It orbits within a ~500 km wide &quot;gap&quot; or &quot;notch&quot; in the ring. The gap is clearly somehow related to the moon but the origin of this connection has not been established. Metis supplies a significant part of the main ring&#x27;s dust. This material appears to consist primarily of material that is ejected from the surfaces of Jupiter&#x27;s four small inner satellites by meteorite impacts. It is easy for the impact ejecta to be lost from the satellites into space because the satellites&#x27; surfaces lie fairly close to the edge of their Roche spheres due to their low density.

<doc id="44656" wikidata="Q167837" url="?curid=44656" title="Domenico Scarlatti">
<text>Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti (26 October 1685 – 23 July 1757) was an Italian composer. He is classified primarily as a Baroque composer chronologically, although his music was influential in the development of the Classical style. Like his renowned father Alessandro Scarlatti, he composed in a variety of musical forms, although today he is known mainly for his 555 keyboard sonatas. He spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese and Spanish royal families.

==Life and career ==
Scarlatti was born in Naples, Kingdom of Naples, then belonging to the Spanish Empire. He was born in 1685, the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel. He was the sixth of ten children of the composer and teacher Alessandro Scarlatti. His older brother Pietro Filippo was also a musician.

Scarlatti first studied music under his father. Other composers who may have been his early teachers include Gaetano Greco, Francesco Gasparini, and Bernardo Pasquini, all of whom may have influenced his musical style.

Scarlatti was appointed as a composer and organist at the Chapel Royal of Naples in 1701 and briefly worked under his father, who was then the chapel&#x27;s &quot;maestro di cappella&quot;. In 1703 he revised Carlo Francesco Pollarolo&#x27;s opera &quot;Irene&quot; for performance at Naples. Soon after, his father sent him to Venice. After this, nothing is known of his life until 1709, when he went to Rome and entered the service of the exiled Polish queen Marie Casimire. It was there he met Thomas Roseingrave. Scarlatti was already an accomplished harpsichordist; there is a story of a trial of skill with George Frideric Handel at the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni in Rome, where Scarlatti was judged possibly superior to Handel on the harpsichord, although inferior on the organ. Later in life, he was known to cross himself in veneration when speaking of Handel&#x27;s skill.

While in Rome, Scarlatti composed several operas for Queen Casimir&#x27;s private theatre. He was &quot;Maestro di Cappella&quot; at St. Peter&#x27;s from 1715 to 1719. In 1719 he travelled to London to direct his opera &quot;Narciso&quot; at the King&#x27;s Theatre.

According to Vicente Bicchi, Papal Nuncio in Portugal at the time, Scarlatti arrived in Lisbon on 29 November 1719. There he taught music to the Portuguese princess Maria Magdalena Barbara. He left Lisbon on 28 January 1727 for Rome, where he married Maria Caterina Gentili on 6 May 1728. In 1729 he moved to Seville, staying for four years. In 1733, he went to Madrid as a music master to Princess Maria Barbara, who had married into the Spanish royal house. She later became Queen of Spain. Scarlatti remained in Spain for the remaining 25 years of his life and had five children there. After his wife died in 1739, he married a Spaniard, Anastasia Maxarti Ximenes. Among his compositions during his time in Madrid were most of the 555 keyboard sonatas for which he is best known.

Scarlatti befriended the castrato singer Farinelli, a fellow Neapolitan also enjoying royal patronage in Madrid. Musicologist and harpsichordist Ralph Kirkpatrick, who published a biography of Scarlatti in 1953, commented that Farinelli&#x27;s correspondence provides &quot;most of the direct information about Scarlatti that has transmitted itself to our day&quot;.

Scarlatti died in Madrid at the age of 71. His residence at 35 Calle de Leganitos is designated with a historical plaque, and his descendants still live in Madrid. He was buried at a convent there, but his grave no longer exists.

Minor planet 6480 Scarlatti is named in his honour.

==Music==

Only a small number of Scarlatti&#x27;s compositions were published during his lifetime. Scarlatti himself seems to have overseen the publication in 1738 of the most famous collection, his 30 &quot;Esercizi&quot; (Exercises). They were well received throughout Europe and were championed by the foremost English writer on music of the eighteenth century, Charles Burney. Burney wrote that the harpsichordist Joseph Kelway was &quot;head of the Scarlatti sect&quot;, a group of English musicians that championed Scarlatti as early as 1739, also including Thomas Roseingrave.

The many sonatas unpublished during Scarlatti&#x27;s lifetime have appeared in print irregularly in the past two and a half centuries. He has attracted notable admirers, including Béla Bartók, Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli, Pieter-Jan Belder, Johann Sebastian Bach, Muzio Clementi, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Ludwig van Beethoven, Carl Czerny, Franz Liszt, Johannes Brahms, Frédéric Chopin, Claude Debussy, Emil Gilels, Francis Poulenc, Olivier Messiaen, Enrique Granados, Marc-André Hamelin, Vladimir Horowitz, Ivo Pogorelić, Scott Ross (the first performer to record all 555 sonatas), Heinrich Schenker, András Schiff and Dmitri Shostakovich. 

Scarlatti&#x27;s 555 keyboard sonatas are single movements, mostly in binary form, and some in early sonata form, and mostly written for harpsichord or the earliest pianofortes. (There are four for the organ and a few for small instrumental groups). Some display harmonic audacity in their use of discords, and unconventional modulations to remote keys.

Though Scarlatti wrote over 500 sonatas, there is a wide variety in his works. Some are deeply serious, others are light and almost humorous. Some sound like courtly dances, others like street songs. This ability to cover a wide range of styles and moods is one of the hallmarks of Scarlatti&#x27;s work. Another stylistic trait of this composer is the ability to mix “different forms or levels of discourse”.

Other distinctive attributes of his music are:
*The influence of Iberian (Portuguese and Spanish) folk music. An example is his use of the Phrygian mode and other tonal inflections more or less alien to European art music. Many of his figurations and dissonances are suggestive of the guitar.
*The influence of the Spanish guitar can be seen in notes being played repeatedly.

*A formal device where each half of a sonata leads to a pivotal point, which Kirkpatrick termed &quot;the crux&quot;, and which is sometimes underlined by a pause or fermata. Before the crux, Scarlatti sonatas often contain their main thematic variety, and after the crux, the music makes more use of repetitive figurations as it modulates away from the home key (in the first half) or back to the home key (in the second half).
*Its tendency to be in the &quot;galant&quot; style.

Kirkpatrick produced an edition of the sonatas in 1953, and the numbering from this edition—the Kk. or K. number—is now nearly always used. Previously, the numbering commonly used was from the 1906 edition compiled by Neapolitan pianist Alessandro Longo (L. numbers). Kirkpatrick&#x27;s numbering is chronological, while Longo&#x27;s ordering is a result of his arbitrarily grouping the sonatas into &quot;suites&quot;. In 1967 the Italian musicologist Giorgio Pestelli published a revised catalogue (using P. numbers), which corrected what he considered to be some anachronisms, and added some sonatas missing from Kirkpatrick&#x27;s edition. Although the exact composition dates for these surviving sonatas are not known, Kirkpatrick concluded that they might all have been composed late in Scarlatti&#x27;s career (after 1735), with most of them possibly written after the composer&#x27;s 67th birthday.

Aside from his many sonatas, Scarlatti composed several operas, cantatas, and liturgical pieces. Well-known works include the &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; of 1715, and the &quot;Salve Regina&quot; of 1756, which is thought to be his last composition.

<text>Metis (; ; Modern Greek: Μήτις, meaning &#x27;Wisdom&#x27;, &#x27;Skill&#x27;, or &#x27;Craft&#x27;), in ancient Greek religion and mythology, was one of the Oceanids. She is notable for being the advisor and first wife of Zeus, the King of the Gods. She helped him to free his siblings from their father Cronus&#x27; stomach by giving him an emetic and, when she was swallowed by Zeus after it was foretold that she would bear a son mightier than his father, helped their daughter Athena to escape from his forehead.

== Function ==
By the era of Greek philosophy in the 5th century BC, Metis had become the first deity of wisdom and deep thought, but her name originally connoted &quot;magical cunning&quot; and was as easily equated with the trickster powers of Prometheus as with the &quot;royal &quot;metis&quot;&quot; of Zeus. The Stoic commentators allegorised Metis as the embodiment of &quot;prudence&quot;, &quot;wisdom&quot; or &quot;wise counsel&quot;, in which form she was inherited by the Renaissance.

The Greek word &quot;metis&quot; meant a quality that combined wisdom and cunning. This quality was considered to be highly admirable, the hero Odysseus being the embodiment of it, for example using such a strategy against Polyphemus, son of Poseidon. In the Classical era, &quot;metis&quot; was regarded by Athenians as one of the notable characteristics of the Athenian character.

== Mythology ==
=== Hesiod&#x27;s account ===
Metis was an Oceanid nymph, one of the 3000 daughters of the Titans Oceanus and his sister-wife Tethys, and a sister of the river-gods, which also numbered 3000. Metis gave her cousin Zeus a potion to cause his father Cronus, the supreme ruler of the cosmos, to vomit out his siblings their father had swallowed out of fear of being overthrown. After the Titanomachy, the 10-year war among the immortals, she was pursued by Zeus and they got married. Zeus himself is titled &quot;Metieta&quot; (), in the Homeric poems.

Metis was both a threat to Zeus and an indispensable aid. He lay with her, but immediately feared the consequences. It had been prophesied that she would bear a daughter who would be wiser than her mother, and then a son more powerful than his father, who would eventually overthrow Zeus and become king of the cosmos in his place. In order to forestall these consequences, Zeus tricked Metis into turning herself into a fly and promptly swallowed her. However, she was already pregnant with their first and only child, Athena. Metis crafted armor, a spear, and a shield for her daughter, whom she raised in Zeus&#x27; mind. Athena eventually used her spear and shield, banging them together to give her father a headache. Soon, he could not take his headache anymore and had the smith god Hephaestus, one of his sister-wife Hera&#x27;s sons, cut his head open to let out whatever was in there on the river Trito&#x27;s banks. Athena emerged from Zeus&#x27;s mind full grown, wearing the armor her mother made her. She was made the goddess of wisdom, warfare, and crafts.

According to a scholiast on the &quot;Theogony&quot;, Metis had the ability of changing her shape at will. Zeus tricked her and swallowed his pregnant wife when she transformed into a &quot;&quot; (&quot;pikràn&quot;). As Keightley notes, (&quot;bitter&quot;) makes little or no sense in that context, and it has been variously corrected to (&quot;muîan&quot;, meaning &quot;fly&quot;) or (&quot;mikràn&quot;, meaning &quot;small thing&quot;) instead. 

According to Apollodorus, Metis was raped by Zeus, and changed many forms in order to escape him, after he pursued her.

An alternative version of the same myth makes the Cyclops Brontes rather than Zeus the father of Athena before Metis is swallowed.

Hesiod&#x27;s account is followed by Acusilaus and the Orphic tradition, which enthroned Metis side by side with Eros as primal cosmogenic forces. Plato makes &quot;Poros&quot;, or &quot;creative ingenuity&quot;, a son of Metis.

== Ancient legacy ==
The similarities between Zeus swallowing Metis and Cronus swallowing his children have been noted by several scholars. This also caused some controversy in regard to reproduction myths.

== Modern legacy ==
* Metis Island in Antarctica is named after Metis.
* 9 Metis, one of the larger main-belt asteroids, is named after this goddess.
* Metis, a moon of Jupiter, is named after the goddess.

<text>A sea serpent is a type of sea monster described in various mythologies, most notably in Mesopotamian cosmology (Tiamat), Ugaritic cosmology (Yam, Tannin), biblical cosmology (Leviathan, Rahab), Greek cosmology (Cetus, Echidna, Hydra, Scylla), and Norse cosmology (Jörmungandr).

==Mythology==

===Mediterranean and Western Asia===

The mytheme, the chief god in the role of the hero slaying a sea serpent, is widespread both in the ancient Near East and in Indo-European mythology, 
e.g. Lotan and Hadad, Leviathan and Yahweh, Tiamat and Marduk (see also Labbu, Bašmu, Mušḫuššu), Illuyanka and Tarhunt, Yammu and Baal in the Baal Cycle etc. The Hebrew Bible also has mythological descriptions of large sea creatures as part of creation under Yahweh&#x27;s command, such as the Tanninim mentioned in Book of Genesis 1:21 and the &quot;great serpent&quot; of Amos 9:3. In the Aeneid, a pair of sea serpents killed Laocoön and his sons when Laocoön argued against bringing the Trojan Horse into Troy. Claudius Aelianus in his work &quot;On the Nature of Animals&quot; mentions a giant sea centipede, which has a tail that is similar to a crayfish and which moves using numerous feet on each side of its body. Guillaume Rondelet mentions a similar imaginary creature called centipede cetacean in his work &quot;L&#x27;histoire entière des poissons&quot;.

===Germanic Scandinavia===
In Nordic mythology, &quot;Jörmungandr&quot; (or &quot;Midgarðsormr&quot;) was a sea serpent or worm so long that it encircled the entire world, Midgard. Sea serpents also appear frequently in later Scandinavian folklore, particularly in that of Norway, such as an account that in 1028 AD, Saint Olaf killed a sea serpent in Valldal in Norway, throwing its body onto the mountain Syltefjellet. Marks on the mountain are associated with the legend.

== Natural history ==
An apparent eye-witness account is given by Aristotle in his work &quot;Historia Animalium&quot; on natural history. Strabo makes reference to an eyewitness account of a dead sea creature sighted by Poseidonius on the coast of the northern Levant. He reports the following: &quot;As for the plains, the first, beginning at the sea, is called Macras, or Macra-Plain. Here, as reported by Poseidonius, was seen the fallen dragon, the corpse of which was about a plethrum [] in length, and so bulky that horsemen standing by it on either side could not see one another, and its jaws were large enough to admit a man on horseback, and each flake of its horny scales exceeded an oblong shield in length.&quot; The creature was seen sometime between 130 and 51 BC.

=== Norway, 16th century ===
Swedish ecclesiastic and writer Olaus Magnus included illustrations of sea serpents and other various marine monsters on his illustrated map, the &quot;Carta marina&quot;. In his 1555 work &quot;History of the Northern Peoples&quot;, Olaus gives the following description of a Norwegian sea serpent:

Norwegian Bishop Erik Pontoppidan (1698–1764) did not disbelieve the existence of sea serpents themselves, but doubted they would prey on ships and feed on humans, being more cautious-minded in that respect than Archbishop Olaus (of Upsala). Nevertheless, a number of reports were made by sailors at the time that sea serpents would destroy ships by wrapping the ship in coils of their body and pulling it underwater. Sailors threatened by a sea serpent were said to have thrown large objects such as paddles or shovels overboard in the path of the serpent, hoping that the serpent would take the object and leave without destroying the ship.

=== Greenland in 1734 ===
Rev. Hans Egede, a Dano-Norwegian clergyman who was an early explorer and surveyor of Greenland, gave an 18th-century description of a sea serpent witnessed by his party. In his journal he wrote:

Egede also wrote on the same sea-monster sighting in his book, noting that the beast was spotted at the 64th degree of latitude, and was as thick or &quot;bulky as the Ship, and three or four times as long&quot;. Egede himself did not supply a sketch in this otherwise well-illustrated book, but the missionary named Bing who was his comrade drew a sketch, which is reproduced in Henry Lee&#x27;s work.

Bing further described this creature as having reddish eyes, almost burning with fire. This convinced Bishop Pontoppidan that this was different from the type of sea serpent seen by others. From Bing&#x27;s drawing, Pontoppidan estimated the creature to be considerably shorter than the length of a cable rope, or 100 fathoms () attested by multiple witnesses, and the pair of fins which were attached &quot;below the waist ()&quot; in Pontoppidan&#x27;s view, was another unusual feature.

Lee proposed a rational explanation that this sea-serpent was a misapprehended sighting of what was actually the exposed head and one tentacle of a giant squid (Cf. figure above left).

=== New York exhibition in 1845 ===
In 1845, a long skeleton claimed as belonging to an extinct sea serpent was put on a show in the New York City by Albert C. Koch. The claim was debunked by Prof. Jeffries Wyman, an anatomist who went to see the skeleton for himself. Wyman declared that the skull of the animal had to be mammalian in origin, and that the skeleton was composed of bones of several different animals, including an extinct species of whale.

=== Portuguese waters, 1848 ===

On 6 August 1848 Captain McQuhae of and several of his officers and crew (en route to St Helena) saw a sea serpent which was subsequently reported (and debated) in &quot;The Times&quot;. The vessel sighted what they named as an enormous serpent between the Cape of Good Hope and St Helena. The serpent was witnessed to have been swimming with of its head above the water and they believed that there was another of the creature in the sea. Captain McQuahoe also said that &quot;[The creature] passed rapidly, but so close under our lee quarter, that had it been a man of my acquaintance I should have easily have recognized his features with the naked eye.&quot; According to seven members of the crew, it remained in view for around twenty minutes. Another officer wrote that the creature was more of a lizard than a serpent. Evolutionary biologist Gary J. Galbreath contends that what the crew of &quot;Daedalus&quot; saw was a sei whale.

A report was published in the &quot;Illustrated London News&quot; on 14 April 1849 of a sighting of a sea serpent off the Portuguese coast by .

:&quot;A giant snake appeared at once from the water - and the largest cetacean a boa constrictor way wrapped twice. (I note such a physeter It can grow to 20-30 meters long!) It lasted for about 15 minutes the deadly struggle, the sea was just foaming and crashing waves around us, finally the back of the whale stood out Out of the water, he sank head first into the deep where the snake must have killed him. A cold shiver ran through us a cet at the sight of his final struggle; so writhing poor in the monster&#x27;s double ring, like a little bird between the claws of a falcon. View of the two rings, the snake. It could have been 160-170 feet long and 7-8 feet thick.&quot;

==Natural explanations==
R.L. France proposed in a 2016 paper for the &quot;International Journal of Maritime History&quot; that a significant number of sea serpent sightings, including nineteenth century accounts of serpents attacking whales, were due to the misidentification of whales entangled in fishing gear and maritime debris.

In a 2023 article for &quot;Fate&quot;, Karl Brandt suggested well-known sea serpent sightings could be explained by harpooned sperm whales held fast to their hunters’ overturned rowboats. The boats would accumulate debris at the surface which could stretch for hundreds of yards while appearing to be propelled through the water by unknown means. The theory was supported by the majority of sightings in Norwegian fjords occurring ‘during the summer months of June to August when the whales are most plentiful.’

<doc id="44660" wikidata="Q164475" url="?curid=44660" title="Arcangelo Corelli">
<text>Arcangelo Corelli (, , , ; 17 February 1653 – 8 January 1713) was an Italian composer and violinist of the middle Baroque era. His music was key in the development of the modern genres of sonata and concerto, in establishing the preeminence of the violin, and as the first coalescing of modern tonality and functional harmony.

He was trained in Bologna and Rome and spent most of his career there with the protection of wealthy patrons. Though his entire production is limited to just six published collections – five of which are trio sonatas or solo and one of concerti grossi — he achieved great fame and success throughout Europe, in the process crystallizing widely influential musical models.

His writing was admired for its balance, refinement, sumptuous and original harmonies, for the richness of the textures, for the majestic effect of the theatricality and for its clear, expressive and melodious polyphony, a perfect quality of classical ideals, although belonging to the baroque epoch and often employing resources typical of this school, such as the exploration of dynamic and expressive contrasts, but always tempered by a great sense of moderation. He was the first to fully apply, with an expressive and structuring purpose, the new tonal system, consolidated after at least two hundred years of experimentation. As a virtuoso violinist he was considered one of the greatest of his generation and contributed, thanks to the development of modern playing techniques and to his many disciples scattered throughout Europe, to place the violin among the most prestigious solo instruments and was also a significant figure in the evolution of the traditional orchestra.

A dominant figure in Roman musical life and internationally highly regarded, he was desired by many courts and was included in the most prestigious artistic and intellectual society of his time, the Pontifical Academy of Arcadia. He was known in his time as &quot;the new Orpheus&quot;, &quot;the prince of musicians&quot; and other similar adjectives, great folklore was generated around his figure and his fame did not diminish after his death. Even today his work is the subject of a voluminous critical bibliography and his sonatas are still widely used in musical academies as didactic material as well as pieces capable of affirming themselves in today&#x27;s concert repertoire. His position in the history of Western music is considered crucial, being recognized as one of the greatest masters at the turn of the 17th and 18th century, as well as one of the earliest and greatest classicists.

==Life==
===Childhood===
Baptismal records indicate that Corelli was born on 17 February 1653 in the small Romagna town of Fusignano, then in the diocese of Ferrara, in the Papal States. His ancestors had been in Fusignano and land-owners there since 1506, when a Corelli moved to the area from Rome. Although apparently prosperous, they were almost certainly not of the nobility, as several fanciful accounts of the composer&#x27;s genealogy subsequently claimed. Corelli&#x27;s father, from whom he took the name Arcangelo, died five weeks before the composer&#x27;s birth. Consequently, he was raised by his mother, Santa (&quot;née&quot; Ruffini, or Raffini), alongside four elder siblings.

The wealth of anecdotes and legends attached to Corelli contrast sharply with the paucity of reliable contemporary evidence documenting events in his life. This gap is especially pronounced for his formative years, including his musical education; traditional accounts of a highly idealized childhood have long been debunked.

===Musical education===
According to the poet Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni, who presumably knew the composer well, Corelli initially studied music under a priest in the nearby town of Faenza, and then in Lugo, before moving in 1666 to Bologna. A major centre of musical culture of the time, Bologna had a flourishing school of violinists associated with Ercole Gaibara and his pupils, and Leonardo Brugnoli. Reports by later sources link Corelli&#x27;s musical studies with several master violinists, including Benvenuti, Brugnoli, Bartolomeo Laurenti and Giovanni Battista Bassani. Although historically plausible, these accounts remain largely unconfirmed, as does the claim that the papal contralto Matteo Simonelli first taught him to write in the &quot;Palestrina style&quot;. A remark Corelli later made to a patron suggests that his musical education focused mainly on the violin.

Chronicles of the Accademia Filarmonica of Bologna indicate that Corelli was accepted as a member by 1670, at the exceptionally young age of seventeen. The credibility of this attribution has been disputed. Although the nickname &quot;Il Bolognese&quot; appears on the title-pages of Corelli&#x27;s first three published sets of works (Opus 1 to 3), the duration of his stay in Bologna remains unclear.

===Early career===
Anecdotes of travels outside Italy to France, Germany, and Spain lack any contemporary evidence. For example, the anecdote that Corelli&#x27;s continental fame stemmed from a trip to Paris at the age of nineteen, where he was chased away by an envious Jean-Baptiste Lully, seems to have originated with Jean-Jacques Rousseau. It was also claimed that Corelli spent time in Germany in the service of Maximilian II Emanuel, Elector of Bavaria (supposedly in 1681), as well as in the house of his friend and fellow violinist-composer Cristiano Farinelli (between 1680 and 1685).

Although it is unclear quite when Corelli arrived in Rome, he was certainly active there by 1675, when &quot;Arcangelo Bolognese&quot; (as he was referred to) was engaged to play as one of the supporting violinists in Lenten oratorios at the church of San Giovanni dei Fiorentini, as well as in the French national celebrations held each year on 25 August at San Luigi dei Francesi and during the ordination of a member of the powerful Chigi family at Santi Domenico e Sisto. In August 1676, he was already playing second violin to Carlo Mannelli at San Luigi dei Francesi. Although Rome did not have any permanent orchestra providing stable employment for instrumentalists, Corelli rapidly made a name for himself, playing in a variety of ensembles sponsored by wealthy patrons, such as Cardinal Benedetto Pamphili, for whom he played in Lenten oratorios at San Marcello from 1676 to 1679.

===Professional success===

In 1687 Corelli led the festival performances of music for Queen Christina of Sweden. He was also a favorite of Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, grandnephew of another Cardinal Pietro Ottoboni, who in 1689 became Pope Alexander VIII. From 1689 to 1690 he was in Modena. The Duke of Modena was generous to him. In 1706 Corelli was elected a member of the Pontificia Accademia degli Arcadi (the Arcadian Academy of Rome). He received the Arcadian name of Arcomelo Erimanteo.

In 1708 he returned to Rome, living in the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni. His visit to Naples, at the invitation of King Philip V, took place in the same year. The style of execution introduced by Corelli and preserved by his pupils, such as Francesco Geminiani, Pietro Locatelli, Pietro Castrucci, Francesco Antonio Bonporti, Giovanni Stefano Carbonelli, Francesco Gasparini, and others, was of vital importance for the development of violin playing. It has been said that the paths of all of the famous violinist-composers of 18th-century Italy led to Arcangelo Corelli, who was their &quot;iconic point of reference&quot;.

However, Corelli used only a limited portion of his instrument&#x27;s capabilities. This may be seen from his writings. The parts for violin very rarely proceed above D on the highest string, sometimes reaching the E in fourth position on the highest string. The story has been told and retold that Corelli refused to play a passage that extended to A in altissimo in the overture to Handel&#x27;s oratorio &quot;The Triumph of Time and Truth&quot; (premiered in Rome, 1708).

Nevertheless, his compositions for the instrument mark an epoch in the history of chamber music. His influence was not confined to his own country: his works were key in the development of the music of an entire generation of composers, including Antonio Vivaldi, Georg Friedrich Handel, Johann Sebastian Bach and François Couperin, as well as many others. Bach studied the works of Corelli and based an organ fugue (BWV 579) on Corelli&#x27;s Opus 3 of 1689. Handel&#x27;s Opus 6 &quot;Concerti Grossi&quot; take Corelli&#x27;s own older Opus 6 &quot;Concerti&quot; as models, rather than the later three-movement Venetian concerto of Antonio Vivaldi favoured by Bach.
Musical society in Rome also owed much to Corelli. He was received in the highest circles of the aristocracy, and for a long time presided at the celebrated Monday concerts in the palace of Cardinal Ottoboni.

===Death===
Corelli died in Rome in possession of a fortune of 120,000 marks and a valuable collection of works of art and fine violins, the only luxury in which he had indulged. He left both to his benefactor and friend, who generously made over the money to Corelli&#x27;s relatives. Corelli is buried in the Pantheon at Rome.

==Works==

=== Context ===

Corelli&#x27;s artistic figure flourished at the height of the Baroque, a cultural current characterized by an ornate and luxuriant artistic expressiveness, rich of strong contrasts. His music developed from the Renaissance polyphony, but was characterized by a transition towards greater independence between the voices. New socio-cultural and religious factors, as well as a strong influence of theater and rhetoric, led to the development of a renewed musical language that could better express the spirit of the time, thus developing a wide range of new harmonical, vocal and instrumental techniques. It is the period in which the tonal system is definitively consolidated, abandoning the old modal system, and which has its most typical expression in the writing style called continuo or ciphered bass, in which the bass line and the top line are written in full, leaving the execution of the harmonic filling attributed to the other parts to the discretion of the performer, indicated synthetically by the author by numbers. The great importance attributed to the superior voice, which relegated the other parts to a subordinate role, brought out the figure of the virtuoso soloist.
The tempered tunings were also introduced, the melody often had popular inspiration and the dissonances began to be used as an expressive resource. Polyphony remained omnipresent especially in sacred music, generally more conservative, but the complexity that characterized it in previous centuries, which often made the sung texts incomprehensible, was abandoned in favor of a much clearer and simplified counterpoint, in which primacy was often given to the loudest voice. Furthermore, in the field of symbolism and language, the development of the theory of affects was of great importance, in which figures, melodies, tones and specific standardized technical resources became a musical lexicon at the service of expression. Such resources were very common in opera, the most popular and influential genre of the time, also exerting a decisive influence on the direction of instrumental music, a language that Corelli contributed significantly to articulate and affirm. At a formal level, the Baroque consolidated the forms of the suite and the sonata into multiple movements, which gave rise to the sonata da chiesa, the sonata da camera, to the sonata, to the concerto grosso, to the solo concerto and, later, to the symphony. In general, the changes introduced by the Baroque constituted a revolution in the history of music, perhaps as important as those promoted by the emergence of &quot;ars nova&quot; in the 14th century and avant-garde music in the 20th century.

Bologna, where Corelli originally studied, with its 60,000 inhabitants, was the second most important city in the Papal State, seat of the oldest university in the world and center of an intense cultural and artistic life. There were several large churches that maintained permanent orchestras, choirs and schools, three large theaters hosted dramatic and operatic performances, several publishing houses published sheet music, and there were at least half a dozen academies maintained by the nobility and higher clergy in their buildings. All of this defined trends and aesthetic canons, some dedicated exclusively to music, among which the most famous was the Accademia Filarmonica, founded in 1666 by Count Vincenzo Maria Carrati. An illustrious violin school was formed in this city, founded by Ercole Gaibara, whose principles were assimilated by Corelli.

Rome, on the other hand, had much greater traditions, wealth, and importance on several levels, starting with being the seat of Catholicism. Furthermore, it was a cosmopolitan capital that welcomed artists from all over Europe, eager to establish themselves in such rich, varied and influential settings, where the great patrons of the Church and the aristocracy challenged each other by organizing sumptuous presentations and promoting numerous artists. However, few churches and brotherhoods had stable musical bodies and there was a great exchange of professionals between one celebration and another. Unlike Bologna, in Rome the Church had a decisive influence on cultural life, and the guidelines in this regard varied according to the preferences of each pontiff. Pope Clement IX, for example, was himself a librettist of operas and oratorios and promoted secular music, and Corelli apparently found himself in this environment without any difficulty, although it is not known who introduced him to it. In any case, he soon gained the favor of patrons who were among the city&#x27;s most prominent.

=== The violinist ===
As already mentioned, Corelli learned the fundamentals of violin technique in Bologna, and as a disciple of the virtuosos Giovanni Benvenuti and Leonardo Brugnoli, he followed the lines set by Ercole Gaibara, considered the progenitor of the Bolognese school. He later taught many students and spawned his own school, but despite his fame in this field, surprisingly few inaccurate descriptions of his technique survive, generating considerable controversy among critics, a shortcoming that is compounded by the fact that he did not write any manual or treatise about the topic. At the time there were several violin schools in Italy, which proposed different playing methods and even ways in which the player should hold the violin. There is considerable iconography describing these differences, where violinists rest the instrument under the chin, on the shoulder or against the chest, at different angles. Naturally, these differences involved different left hand and bow techniques and, to some extent, defined the style and complexity of the music they could perform.

During the 18th century he was considered a great virtuoso, but critics of the 20th century have sometimes doubted the ancient testimonies. Boyden, for example, stated that &quot;Corelli cannot claim a prominent place in the history of violin technique&quot;; Pincherle considered him &quot;inferior to his German and even Italian contemporaries in terms of pure technique&quot;, and McVeigh said that he was &quot;certainly not one of the great virtuosos of his time&quot;. However, according to Riedo, such opinions are based on what can be deduced from the technical requirements contained in his compositions, but this method is not entirely faithful to reality, since the score only offers a vague idea of what could be a live performance, also observing that the style developed by Corelli was characterized more by sobriety and singability than by extravagance. Furthermore, his compositions, in their published version, are addressed above all to a heterogeneous audience and not only to specialists and virtuosos. At the same time, his works cannot be exemplary of his ability to interpret works by other authors, where he may have taken a different approach. The failures of the Naples recital and the confrontation with Handel in Rome, where he supposedly claimed to have no experience in French technique, are often cited as evidence supporting his limited violin technique, although they are not firmly demonstrated.

According to Riedo&#x27;s research, which summarizes studies on this aspect, Corelli probably held the violin against his chest and projected it forward; this possibility is supported by engravings and drawings, as well as written sources, including descriptions of the performances of other violinists who had been his students or were influenced by him. This position was very common before his time, was dominant in the Rome of his time and remained common until the 19th century. Francesco Geminiani, who was probably his student, in his &quot;The Art of Playing the Violin&quot; (1751) wrote that &quot;the violin should be held just below the clavicle, inclining the right side slightly downward, so so it is not necessary to bend too much when playing the fourth string.&quot; Walls claimed that almost no virtuoso of the first half of the 18th century took a different stance. It provided the performer with an elegant attitude, in Corelli&#x27;s case also important for being a patrician, but it slightly impaired the execution of the highest notes of the fourth string. Corelli&#x27;s music rarely requires positions higher than the third.

Geminiani, who was also a virtuoso, gave voice to a very current vision of what is expected from a good violinist: &quot;The intention of music is not only to please the ear, but to express feelings, touch the imagination, influence the mind, and dominate the passions. The art of playing the violin consists in giving the instrument a sound that rivals the most perfect human voice, and in executing each piece with accuracy, decorum, delicacy and expression according to the true intention of the music.&quot; In Riedo&#x27;s words, &quot;Geminiani&#x27;s ideological and aesthetic views seem to correspond exactly to Corelli&#x27;s compositions: he enhanced the textures, without acrobatic passages with extreme changes of position and without virtuoso effects. The positions of Boyden, Pincherle and McVeigh must be reconsidered, since this type of acrobatic virtuosity does not seem to have been Corelli&#x27;s goal.&quot; Contemporary descriptions report that his performances were &quot;erudite, elegant and pathetic, and his sound firm and uniform.&quot; Bremner wrote in 1777: &quot;I was informed that Corelli would not accept into his orchestra any violinist who could not, with a bow, create a uniform and powerful sound, like that of an organ, by playing two strings at the same time, and maintain it for at least minus ten seconds.&quot; This suggests that his main concern was the mastery of bow technique, responsible for the overall sound produced and for the nuances and subtleties of dynamics and phrasing, which also coincides with claims of the time about Corelli&#x27;s ability to express in the violin the most diverse emotions in their fullness, making his instrument &quot;speak&quot; as if it were a human voice.

Among the advances that he promoted in the technique are the more intense exploration of double strings (including figurations in a pedal note), the G string (little used until then), harmonics, arpeggios, and tremolo, of rubato, of staccato, of scordatura, of fast figurations in thirds, of chords of more than two notes and was the main proponent of the bariolage technique. Although Corelli did not write anything about it, the treatises published by Geminiani, Francesco Galeazzi and others influenced by him probably faithfully reflect the master&#x27;s principles. His performances in various fields related to the violin – virtuoso, teacher and composer – have left an indelible mark on the history of this instrument and have laid the foundations of its modern technique.

It is known that he had many students, among them: Matteo Fornari, Giovanni Battista Somis, Pietro Castrucci, Giovanni Stefano Carbonelli, Francesco Gasparini, Jean-Baptiste Anet, Georg Muffat and Francesco Geminiani.

=== The conductor ===
Little is known about his performances as a conductor, except that he successfully played this role for many years at the head of the orchestras of the church of San Luis and the Academy of Drawing Arts and of countless groups formed for specific occasions, such as recitals in the private academies of the aristocracy, civic festivals and diplomatic receptions. The recognition he received was always very generous, and he was praised above all for the great discipline of the musicians he directed, always obtaining vigorous performances, with great precision in the attack of the notes and a powerful overall effect. Geminiani reported that &quot;Corelli felt it was essential that the entire orchestra move the bows at exactly the same time: all up, all down, so that in rehearsals prior to performances, he could stop the music if he saw an out-of-range bow position&quot;.

Corelli was of vital importance in the process of transformation of the traditional orchestra. In the previous generation, ensembles were quite small even for opera performances and only on very exceptional occasions were large groups recruited, especially for open-air festivals. The orchestra of San Luigi, for example, did not exceed twenty members, even on prestigious occasions, and most of the time it consisted of about ten or fifteen members.

Thanks to the legacy of ancient polyphonic practices, ensembles made use of various instruments of balanced proportions, grouped in &quot;choirs&quot;, each composed of several types of instruments. Corelli&#x27;s generation began to change this balance of forces towards an increasing predominance of the string section, with an emphasis on the violins, significantly expanding the number of musicians, grouping the instruments into homogeneous sections and separating the singers from the orchestra. . Its spatial arrangement also changed, adopting a distribution that favored the typical language of the Grosso concert, with a small solo ensemble, the &quot;concertino&quot;, separated from the large &quot;ripieno&quot; group.

In addition to conducting and being a concertmaster at the same time, Corelli was responsible for recruiting musicians to form occasional orchestras, paid salaries, and performed all the functions of a modern event manager. On some occasions he employed an immense number of musicians, up to 150, far above all the standards of his time. According to Crescimbeni&#x27;s testimony, &quot;he was the first to introduce ensembles in Rome with such a number of instruments and such diversity that it was almost impossible to believe that he could make them play all together without fear of confusion, especially since he combined wind instruments with strings, and the total very often exceeded one hundred elements.&quot; Although the number of musicians varied greatly in each performance, the balance of Corelli&#x27;s orchestras was constant, with at least half of the musicians playing violins and a quarter occupied with cellos, violons and double basses. The remaining fraction was filled with a varied instrumentation of violas, wind instruments, lutes, theorbos, organs, harpsichords and others, and depended largely on the character of the music of the occasion. His intense activity at different levels in the field of orchestral music dominated the Roman scene and his role as organizer, dynamizer and standard bearer can be compared to that of Jean-Baptiste Lully at the court of Louis XIV. By extension, one could say that all the Roman orchestras between 1660 and 1713 were “Corelli&#x27;s orchestra.&quot;

=== The composer ===
Despite the typically Baroque love for the extravagant, the bizarre, the asymmetrical and the dramatic, Corelli&#x27;s production deviates from this scheme, favoring the classical principles of sobriety, symmetry, rationality, balanced and expressive moderation, as well as formal perfection, appreciated several times by coeval and contemporary critics, formulating an aesthetic that is among the beginners of the neoclassical school of music with considerable economy of means. In the description of the &quot;Larousse Encyclopedia of Music&quot;, &quot;no doubt others before him showed more originality, but none in his day showed a more noble interest in balance and order, or in formal perfection and meaning. Despite his Bolognese training, he embodies the classical era of Italian music, thanks above all to the Roman tradition. [...] Although he did not invent the forms he used, Corelli gave them a nobility and perfection that make him one of the greatest classicists&quot;.

Corelli&#x27;s works were the result of long and thoughtful planning, and were published only after careful and multiple revisions. His latest collection seems to have taken more than thirty years to complete, and a statement he left in a letter of 1708 attests his insecurity: &quot;After so many and extensive revisions I have rarely felt the confidence to deliver to the public the few compositions that I sent it to the press&quot;. Such a rigorous, rationally and organized method, and such a strong yearning for ideal perfection, are other characteristics that make him a classic in opposition to the wild, asymmetrical, irregular and improvisational spirit of the most typical Baroque. For Franco Piperno, &quot;his printed work has an exceptionally well-kept and cohesive structure, deliberately designed to be didactic, modeling and monumental. It is no coincidence that one of the figures on the title page of his &quot;Opera Terza&quot; is written &quot;to posterity&quot;, that is, as posterity would see him: as an authority on composition, execution and pedagogy, a source of full of potential ideas&quot;. He was rigid also in the choice of genres to deal with: the trio sonata, the sonata for solo instrument and the concerto grosso. All his production is for strings, with continuo accompaniment, which could be performed by a variable combination of organ, harpsichord, lutes or theorbos. He left no works for voice, but his compositions reveal a strong influence of vocal music in their expressiveness, as well as in the treatment of polyphony.

In his time, the circle of fifths established itself as the main driver of chord progressions and, according to Richard Taruskin, Corelli practiced, more than anyone of his generation, new concepts with expressive, dynamic and structural purposes, which was fundamental for the sedimentation of the tonal system. Manfred Bukofzer, likewise, states that &quot;Arcangelo Corelli deserves credit for the full realization of tonality in the field of instrumental music. His works happily usher in the late Baroque period. [...] Although closely linked to counterpoint tradition of the ancient Bolognese school, Corelli handled the new language with impressive confidence. On the other hand, chromatisms are rare in his music, but dissonances are relatively common and used as an expressive element, although they are always well prepared and well resolved. Critics have also highlighted the harmonious and balanced integration between polyphonic and homophonic elements, with polyphony which unfolds freely within a tonal structure. In his work there is an abundance of polyphonic expressive forms, the fugati, simple counterpoints and imitative writings, with themes that are repeated in succession by the various voices alternately, usually also called fugues, but in his style authentic fugues are rare, as his development differs from conventional models because of form, exhibiting a wide variety of solutions. According to Pincherle, one of the most significant aspects of Corelli&#x27;s genius lies in the coordinated movement of these voices that intertwine, avoid each other and find themselves in such a way as to develop ever-changing motifs, establishing a unity through the motivic kinship of the different movements, a method which Fausto Torrefranca compared to the creation of &quot;a frieze that runs along the walls and facades of a temple&quot;.

Among his influences are mainly the masters of the Bolognese school, such as , Leonardo Brugnoli and Giovanni Battista Bassani. Also evident is the influence of Jean-Baptiste Lully, attested by Francesco Geminiani, as well as by the Venetian school, in particular Francesco Cavalli, Antonio Cesti and Giovanni Legrenzi. George J. Buelow, further, attests that the influence of Palestrina on the development of the polyphonic style of his music has been largely ignored, an influence received mainly through his teacher Simonelli, who was a singer of the Sistine Chapel, where Palestrina&#x27;s work was one of the highlights of the repertoire.

Corelli&#x27;s style has long been praised as paradigmatic for its clarity and its sober and expressive melodism, the quintessence of Arcadian good taste. Georg Friedrich Handel, Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, François Couperin, Giuseppe Torelli, Georg Muffat, Georg Philipp Telemann, Giuseppe Valentini, Benedetto Marcello, Pietro Locatelli, Giuseppe Sammartini, Francesco Geminiani and countless other musicians were inspired by the Corellian model in producing their orchestral music. In Rome its influence was so overwhelming that no composer of the next generation could completely avoid it. Along with Torelli and Vivaldi, Corelli was one of the key figures in establishing the concerto as a genre whose popularity still persists today. One American admirer was President Thomas Jefferson who regularly played the violin, and cataloged four of Corelli&#x27;s sonatas in the library at Monticello.

An 1827 music dictionary still echoed what Burney had said more than thirty years earlier: &quot;Corelli&#x27;s concerts have withstood all the onslaught of time and fashion, more firmly than his other works. Harmony is so pure, the parts so clearly, judiciously and ingeniously arranged, and the overall effect, played by a large orchestra, is so majestic, solemn and sublime, that they disarm any criticism and make one forget everything that has ever been composed in the same genre&quot;. In the opinion of Michael Talbot, writing for &quot;The Cambridge Companion to the Concerto&quot;, it is difficult to explain the enduring popularity of this collection, considering the semplicity not the cause of its popularity, but only a precondition. He continues stating:

Corelli composed 48 trio sonatas, 12 violin and continuo sonatas, and 12 concerti grossi.

Six sets of twelve compositions, published between 1888 and 1891 by Chrysander, are authentically ascribed to Corelli, together with a few other works.
* Opus 1: 12 &quot;sonate da chiesa&quot; (trio sonatas for 2 violins and continuo) (Rome 1681)

==Legacy==

His concerti grossi have often been popular in Western culture. For example, a portion of the &quot;Christmas Concerto&quot;, Op. 6 No. 8, is in the soundtrack of the film &quot;Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World&quot;, and Corelli&#x27;s Op. 6 No. 2 also provided the theme for Sir Michael Tippett&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia Concertante on a Theme of Corelli&quot;. British composer E. Florence Whitlock composed &quot;Variations on a Theme by Corelli&quot; for violin in 1968.

<text>The East Slavs are the most populous subgroup of the Slavs. They speak the East Slavic languages, and formed the majority of the population of the medieval state Kievan Rus&#x27;, which they claim as their cultural ancestor. Today Belarusians, Russians and Ukrainians are the existent East Slavic nations. Rusyns can also be considered as a separate nation, although they are often considered a subgroup of the Ukrainian people.

==History==
===Sources===
Researchers know relatively little about the Eastern Slavs prior to approximately 859 AD when the first events recorded in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; occurred. The Eastern Slavs of these early times apparently lacked a written language. The few known facts come from archaeological digs, foreign travellers&#x27; accounts of the Rus&#x27; land, and linguistic comparative analyses of Slavic languages.

Very few native Rus&#x27; documents dating before the 11th century (none before the 10th century) have survived. The earliest major manuscript with information on Rus&#x27; history, the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, dates from the late 11th and early 12th centuries. It lists twelve Slavic tribal unions which, by the 10th century, had settled in the later territory of the Kievan Rus between the Western Bug, the Dniepr and the Black Sea: the &quot;Polans&quot;, &quot;Drevlyans&quot;, &quot;Dregovichs&quot;, &quot;Radimichs&quot;, &quot;Vyatichs&quot;, &quot;Krivichs&quot;, &quot;Slovens&quot;, &quot;Dulebes&quot; (later known as Volhynians and Buzhans), &quot;White Croats&quot;, &quot;Severians&quot;, &quot;Ulichs&quot;, and &quot;Tivertsi&quot;.

===Migration===

There is no consensus among scholars as to the urheimat of the Slavs. In the first millennium AD, Slavic settlers are likely to have been in contact with other ethnic groups who moved across the Eastern European Plain during the Migration Period. Between the first and ninth centuries, the Sarmatians, Huns, Alans, Avars, Bulgars, and Magyars passed through the Pontic steppe in their westward migrations. Although some of them could have subjugated the region&#x27;s Slavs, these foreign tribes left little trace in the Slavic lands. The Early Middle Ages also saw Slavic expansion as an agriculturist and beekeeper, hunter, fisher, herder, and trapper people. By the 8th century, the Slavs were the dominant ethnic group on the East European Plain.

By 600 AD, the Slavs had split linguistically into southern, western, and eastern branches. The East Slavs practiced &quot;slash-and-burn&quot; agricultural methods which took advantage of the extensive forests in which they settled. This method of agriculture involved clearing tracts of forest with fire, cultivating it and then moving on after a few years. Slash and burn agriculture requires frequent movement because soil cultivated in this manner only yields good harvests for a few years before exhausting itself, and the reliance on slash and burn agriculture by the East Slavs explains their rapid spread through eastern Europe. The East Slavs flooded Eastern Europe in two streams. One group of tribes settled along the Dnieper river in what is now Ukraine and Belarus to the North; they then spread northward to the northern Volga valley, east of modern-day Moscow and westward to the basins of the northern Dniester and the Southern Buh rivers in present-day Ukraine and southern Ukraine.

Another group of East Slavs moved to the northeast, where they encountered the Varangians of the Rus&#x27; Khaganate and established an important regional centre of Novgorod for protection. The same Slavic population also settled the present-day Tver Oblast and the region of Beloozero. Having reached the lands of the Merya near Rostov, they linked up with the Dnieper group of Slavic migrants.

===Pre-Kievan period===
According to archeology, the Prague, Korchak, Penkova, Kolochin, and Kyiv cultures are classified as early Slavic. The earliest of which, Kyiv, from the 2nd–3rd centuries AD. e. was the northern neighbor of the more developed and multi-ethnic Chernyakhov culture, associated with West Slavs (Great Moravia). Rare, few and short-lived settlements of the Slavs were located &quot;in unusual topographic conditions: in low places, often now flooded during floods&quot;.

Eastern Slavs, who found themselves as a result of migrations of the 4th–5th centuries. in the basins of lakes Chudskoye and Ilmen, formed the culture of Pskov long barrows. This culture was strongly influenced by the autochthonous Finno-Ugric and Baltic peoples, from whom it adopted a specific burial rite and some features of ceramics, but in general, the way of life of the Eastern Slavs changed little. By the 5th century on the site of the Kyiv culture and in other regions to the north, east, west and south of it, a number of related cultures arise, such as Korchak, Kolochin, etc.

Among the East Slavs, fortified cities, apparently, first appeared among the Ilmen Slovenes in the 5th century (based on archaeological data in the town on Mayat river). The first settlements near the Polans and Severians arose in the region of Kyiv and Chernigov already by the 7th–8th centuries, which indicates at least a partial rejection of the previous strategy of scattered and secretive living among the forests. This is also evidenced by the fact that in the VIII-IX centuries. in all other East Slavic lands there were no more than two dozen cities, while only on the Left Bank of the Dnieper there were about a hundred of them.
The foundation of the main Slavic city of this region, Novgorod, is attributed by the letopis to 862. In the same era, settlements appeared on the territories of other East Slavic tribes (see Old Russian cities). So, the northerners who lived on the territory of modern Voronezh, Belgorod and Kursk regions, along with settlements in the 9th–10th centuries. built fortified settlements, mainly at the confluence of large rivers (see Romensko-Borshchiv culture). In the 10th century, a fortress appeared not far from the city of Smolensk that arose later (the Gnezdovsky archaeological complex).

Somewhat apart are the early East Slavic settlements, the creation of which is attributed to the tribal unions of Dulebs and Antes. Archaeologically, they are represented by the Prague-Korchak and Penkov cultures, respectively. A number of such settlements of the Prague-Korchak (Zimino, Lezhnitsa, Khotomel, Babka, Khilchitsy, Tusheml) and Penkovo (Selishte, Pastyrskoe) cultures existed in the 6th–7th centuries. on a vast territory from the borders of modern Poland and Romania to the Dnieper. The Prague-Korchak settlements were a site surrounded by a wooden wall with one building, which was part of the common wall of the settlement. They did not have agricultural tools, and the settlements, apparently, were built to collect and accommodate a military detachment. Penkovsky settlements could have up to two dozen buildings inside the walls and were large trade, craft and administrative centers for their time. The center of the territory controlled by the dulebs (Zimino, Lezhnitsa) was in the basin of the Western Bug; the geographical center of the Penkovo culture falls on the Dnieper region, but the main fortress of the Antes (Selishte) was located in the western part of this area, near the borders of Byzantine Empire (in modern Moldova), on which they made military campaigns. The early Slavic settlements were destroyed by the Avars in the 7th century, after which they were not built until the 10th century.

===Post-Kievan period===
The disintegration, or parcelling of the polity of Kievan Rus&#x27; in the 11th century resulted in considerable population shifts and a political, social, and economic regrouping. The resultant effect of these forces coalescing was the marked emergence of new peoples. While these processes began long before the fall of Kiev, its fall expedited these gradual developments into a significant linguistic and ethnic differentiation among the Rus&#x27; people into Ukrainians, Belarusians, and Russians. All of this was emphasized by the subsequent polities these groups migrated into: southwestern and western Rus&#x27;, where the Ruthenian and later Ukrainian and Belarusian identities developed, was subject to Lithuanian and later Polish influence; whereas the Russian ethnic identity developed in the Muscovite northeast and the Novgorodian north.

== Population ==
==Genetics==

According to Y chromosome, mDNA and autosomal marker CCR5de132, East Slavs and West Slavs are genetically very similar, which is consistent with the proximity of their languages, demonstrating significant differences from the neighboring Finno-Ugric, Turkic and North Caucasian peoples all the way from west to east; such genetic homogeneity is somewhat unusual for genetics given such a wide dispersal of Slavic populations, especially Russians. Together they form the basis of the &quot;&quot;East European&quot; gene cluster, which also includes Balts, some Balkan peoples. Genetic research has shown that the genomes of East Slavs are homogenous and contrary to popular belief, unaffected by Turkic or Mongol influences.

Only the Northern Russians among the East and West Slavs belong to a different, &quot;Northern European&quot;&quot; genetic cluster, along with the Balts, Germanic and Baltic Finnic peoples (Northern Russian populations are very similar to the Balts).

<text>The one-child policy () was a population planning initiative in China implemented between 1979 and 2015 to curb the country&#x27;s population growth by restricting many families to a single child. The program had wide-ranging social, cultural, economic, and demographic effects, although the contribution of one-child restrictions to the broader program has been the subject of controversy. Its efficacy in reducing birth rates and defensibility from a human rights perspective have been subjects of controversy.

China&#x27;s family planning policies began to be shaped by fears of overpopulation in the 1970s, and officials raised the age of marriage and called for fewer and more broadly spaced births. A near-universal one-child limit was imposed in 1980 and written into the country&#x27;s constitution in 1982. Numerous exceptions were established over time, and by 1984, only about 35.4% of the population was subject to the original restriction of the policy. In the mid-1980s, rural parents were allowed to have a second child if the first was a daughter. It also allowed exceptions for some other groups, including ethnic minorities under 10 million people. In 2015, the government raised the limit to two children, and in May 2021 to three. In July 2021, it removed all limits, shortly after implementing financial incentives to encourage individuals to have additional children.

Implementation of the policy was handled at the national level primarily by the National Population and Family Planning Commission and at the provincial and local level by specialized commissions. Officials used pervasive propaganda campaigns to promote the program and encourage compliance. The strictness with which it was enforced varied by period, region, and social status. In some cases, women were forced to use contraception, receive abortions, and undergo sterilization. Families who violated the policy faced large fines and other penalties.

The population control program had wide-ranging social effects, particularly for Chinese women. Patriarchal attitudes and a cultural preference for sons led to the abandonment of unwanted infant girls, some of whom died and others of whom were adopted abroad. Over time, this skewed the country&#x27;s sex ratio toward men and created a generation of &quot;missing women&quot;. However, the policy also resulted in greater workforce participation by women who would otherwise have been occupied with childrearing, and some girls received greater familial investment in their education.

The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) credits the program with contributing to the country&#x27;s economic ascendancy and says that it prevented 400 million births, although some scholars dispute that estimate. Some have also questioned whether the drop in birth rate was caused more by other factors unrelated to the policy. In the West, the policy has been widely criticized for perceived human rights violations and other negative effects.

==Background==


Since the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, socialist construction was the utmost mission the state needed to accomplish. Top state leaders believed that a bigger population would effectively contribute to the national projects.

During Mao Zedong&#x27;s leadership in China, the birth rate fell from 37 per thousand to 20 per thousand. Infant mortality declined from 227 per thousand births in 1949 to 53 per thousand in 1981, and life expectancy dramatically increased from around 35 years in 1948 to 66 years in 1976. Until the 1960s, the government mostly encouraged families to have as many children as possible, especially during the Great Leap Forward, because of Mao&#x27;s belief that population growth empowered the country, preventing the emergence of family planning programs earlier in China&#x27;s development. The state tried to incentivize more childbirths during that time with a variety of policies, such as the &quot;Mother Heroine&quot; award, a programme inspired by a similar policy in the Soviet Union. As a result, the population grew from around 540million in 1949 to 940million in 1976. Beginning in 1970, citizens were encouraged to marry at later ages and many were limited to have only two children.

Although China&#x27;s fertility rate plummeted faster than anywhere else in the world during the 1970s under these restrictions, the Chinese government thought it was still too high, influenced by the global debate over a possible overpopulation crisis suggested by organizations such as the Club of Rome and the Sierra Club. The fertility rate dropped from 5.9 in the 1950s to 4.0 in the 1970s. Yet, the population still grew at a significant rate. There were approximately 541,670,000 people in China in the year 1949. The number then went up to 806,710,000 in 1969.

In the early 1970s, the state introduced a set of birth planning policies. It mainly called for later childbearing, longer time spans between having new children, and giving birth to fewer children. Men were encouraged to marry at age 25 or later, and women were encouraged to marry at age 23 or later.The authorities began encouraging one-child families in 1978, and in 1979 announced that they intended to advocate for one-child families. Ma Yinchu, a founder of China&#x27;s population planning theory, was also an intellectual architect of the policy. In the late spring of 1979, Chen Yun became the first senior leader to propose the one-child policy. On 1 June 1979, Chen said that:

Deng Xiaoping, then paramount leader of China, supported the policy, along with other senior leaders including Hua Guofeng and Li Xiannian. On 15 October 1979, Deng met a British delegation led by Felix Greene in Beijing, saying that &quot;we encourage one child per couple. We give economic rewards to those who promise to give birth to only one child.&quot;

== Formulation of the policy ==

In 1980, the central government organized a meeting in Chengdu to discuss the speed and scope of one-child restrictions. The notable aerospace engineer Song Jian was a participant at the Chengdu meeting. He had previously read two influential books about population concerns, &quot;The Limits to Growth&quot; and &quot;A Blueprint for Survival&quot;, while visiting Europe in 1980. Along with several associates, Song determined that the ideal population of China was 700million, and that a universal one-child policy for all would be required to meet that goal. If fertility rates remained constant at 3 births per woman, China&#x27;s population would surpass 3 billion by 2060 and 4 billion by 2080. In spite of some criticism inside the CCP, the &quot;family planning policy&quot;, was formally implemented as a temporary measure on 18 September 1980. The plan called for families to have one child each in order to curb a then-surging population and alleviate social, economic, and environmental problems in China.

=== &quot;Virtual&quot; population crisis ===
Despite the legitimate ongoing rapid growth of China&#x27;s population and the evident effects it brought to society, using the term &quot;population crisis&quot; to describe the situation is disputed. Scholars including Susan Greenhalgh argue that the state intentionally created a virtual population crisis in order to serve political ends. According to state promotions, the looming overpopulation crisis would ruin the national agenda of achieving &quot;China&#x27;s socialist modernization&quot;, which includes industry, agriculture, national defense, and technology.

China&#x27;s attitude towards population control on the global stage in international forums evidenced an ambiguous stance on the nature of the crisis. In the mid-1960s, when global movements for birth control emerged, Chinese delegates expressed their opposition toward population control. In the first UN-organized World Population Conference held in Bucharest in 1969, they claimed that it was an imperialist agenda that Western countries imposed on Third World countries, and that population was not a determining factor of economic growth and a country&#x27;s well-being. Yet, in the domestic setting the state leaders were already wary of the perceived &quot;population crisis&quot; that was thought to endanger the modernization of China.

It is also suggested that mathematical terms, graphs, and tables were utilized to form a convincing narrative that presents the urgency of the population problem as well as justifies the necessity of mandatory birth control across the nation. Due to the previous traumas of the Cultural Revolution, public and top state leaders turned to the charisma of science, and sometimes blindly worshipped it as the solution to every problem. As a result, any proposal that was veiled and decorated by the so-called scientific back-ups would be highly considered by both the people and the state.

Arguments started to come out in 1979 suggesting that the excessively rapid population growth was sabotaging the economy and destroying the environment, and essentially preventing China from being a rightful member of the global world. Skillful and deliberate comparisons were made with developed and industrialized countries such as the United States, Japan, and France. Under such a comparison, China&#x27;s relatively low income per capita was attributed directly to population growth and no other factors. Though the data is truthful, its arrangement and presentation to readers gave a single message determined by the state: that the population problem is a national catastrophe and immediate remedy is desperately needed.

=== Chinese population science ===
China was deprived of data, skills, and state support to conduct population studies. Due to Mao&#x27;s ambivalent attitude toward the population issue, population studies were abolished in the late 1950s. After Mao&#x27;s death, family planning became a critical component and premise for reaching China&#x27;s national goal: that is, to achieve &quot;China&#x27;s socialist modernization,&quot; which includes modernizing industry, agriculture, national defence, and technology. Therefore, at this point, population science was closely related and tied with state politics. There was a perceived need to redefine population as a domain of science, identify the population problem in China, and propose a solution to it. Such efforts included many groups of people with diverse backgrounds. Among these experts, two groups held the most influence in defining the population problem and providing a solution to it. They were a group of scientists led by Liu Zheng, and another group led by Song Jian. Liu&#x27;s group mainly came from a social science background, while Song&#x27;s group came from natural science background.

==== Social scientists ====
Social scientists involved in this discussion in the mid-1970s, including Liu Zheng, Wu Cangping, Lin Fude, and Zha Ruichuan, prioritized the Marxist formulation of the population problem. They saw the problem as an &quot;imbalance between economic and demographic growth,&quot; and wished to design a reasonable policy that considered the social consequences. These scientists came from the fields of social science, statistics, genetics, history, and many others. However, they had limited access to resources compared to the natural scientists who became involved in population policy making in 1978. Since population studies were forbidden from the 1950s until 1979, population science had made no progress between these two decades.

==== Natural scientists ====
Natural scientists were interested in using control theory and applying it to the actual policy. The leader of the group, Song Jian, was a control theorist at the Ministry of Aerospace Industry. He was known for his career in missile science. Yu Jingyuan and Li Guangyuan were trained engineers in the field of cybernetics. Compared to the social scientists, this group of natural scientists had numerous advantages. They were politically protected during the Maoist period due to their importance in national defense and technology. They also had access to Western science. Eventually, they took an important role in examining the population model as well as designing the details of one-child policies. After quantitative research and analysis, they showed the top state leaders that the only solution would be a policy &quot;to encourage all couples to have only one child, regardless of the costs to individuals and society&quot;.

Although Greenhalgh claims that Song Jian was the central architect of the one-child policy and that he &quot;hijacked&quot; the population policy making process, that claim has been refuted by several leading scholars, including Liang Zhongtang, a leading internal critic of one-child restrictions and an eye-witness at the discussions in Chengdu. In the words of Wang et al., &quot;the idea of the one-child policy came from leaders within the Party, not from scientists who offered evidence to support it.&quot; Central officials had already decided in 1979 to advocate for one-child restrictions before knowing of Song&#x27;s work and, upon learning of his work in 1980, already seemed sympathetic to his position.

== History ==
The one-child policy was originally designed to be a &quot;One-Generation Policy&quot;. It was enforced at the provincial level and enforcement varied; some provinces had more relaxed restrictions. The one-child limit was most strictly enforced in densely populated urban areas. When this policy was first introduced, 6.1 million families that had already given birth to a child were given &quot;One Child Honorary Certificates&quot;. This was a pledge they had to make to ensure they would not have more children.

Beginning in 1980, the official policy granted local officials the flexibility to make exceptions and allow second children in the case of &quot;practical difficulties&quot; (such as cases in which the father was a disabled serviceman) or when both parents were single children, and some provinces had other exemptions worked into their policies as well. In most areas, families were allowed to apply to have a second child if their first-born was a daughter. By 1984, only approximately 35.4% of the population fell within the policy&#x27;s original restriction.

Furthermore, families with children with disabilities have different policies and families whose first child suffers from physical disability, mental illness, or intellectual disability were allowed to have more children. However, second children were sometimes subject to birth spacing (usually three or four years). Children born overseas were not counted under the policy if they did not obtain Chinese citizenship. Chinese citizens returning from abroad were allowed to have a second child. Sichuan province allowed exemptions for couples of certain backgrounds. By one estimate there were at least 22 ways in which parents could qualify for exceptions to the law towards the end of the one-child policy&#x27;s existence.

In 1991, the central government made local governments directly responsible for family planning goals. Also in the early 1990s, experts from leading population-research institutes began appealing to policymakers to relax or end the one-child policy.

As of 2007, only 36% of the population were subjected to a strict one-child limit. 53% were permitted to have a second child if their first was a daughter; 9.6% of Chinese couples were permitted two children regardless of their gender; and 1.6% – mainly Tibetans – had no limit at all.

Following the devastating 2008 Sichuan earthquake, a new exception to the regulations was announced in Sichuan for parents who had lost children in the earthquake. Similar exceptions had previously been made for parents of severely disabled or deceased children. People have also tried to evade the policy by giving birth to a second child in Hong Kong, but at least for Guangdong residents, the one-child policy was also enforced if the birth took place in Hong Kong or abroad.

In accordance with China&#x27;s affirmative action policies towards ethnic minorities, all non-Han ethnic groups were subject to different laws and were usually allowed to have two children in urban areas, and three or four in rural areas. Han Chinese living in rural towns were also permitted to have two children. Because of couples such as these, as well as those who simply paid a fine (or &quot;social maintenance fee&quot;) to have more children, the overall fertility rate of mainland China was close to 1.4 children per woman .

On 6 January 2010, the former National Population and Family Planning Commission issued the &quot;national population development&quot; 12th five-year plan.

On 1 January 2016, the one-child policy was replaced by the two-child policy.

== Enforcement ==

The one-child policy was managed by the National Population and Family Planning Commission under the central government since 1981. The Ministry of Health of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the National Population and Family Planning Commission were made defunct and a new single agency, the National Health and Family Planning Commission, took over national health and family planning policies in 2013. The agency reports to the State Council.

The policy was enforced at the provincial level through contraception, abortion, and fines that were imposed based on the income of the family and other factors. Population and Family Planning Commissions existed at every level of government to raise awareness and carry out registration and inspection work. The fine was a so-called &quot;social maintenance fee&quot;, the punishment for the families who had more than one child. According to the policy, families who violated the law created a burden on society. Therefore, social maintenance fees were to be used for the operation of the government.

The 2019 documentary &quot;One Child Nation&quot; portrayed the experiences of enforcement, primarily focusing on rural China. Enforcement of the one-child policy was more uneven in rural China.

=== Financial ===

The Family Planning Policy was enforced through a financial penalty in the form of the &quot;social child-raising fee,&quot; sometimes called a &quot;family planning fine&quot; in the West, which was collected as a fraction of either the annual disposable income of city dwellers or of the annual cash income of peasants, in the year of the child&#x27;s birth. For instance, in Guangdong, the fee was between three and six annual incomes for incomes below the district&#x27;s per capita income, plus one to two times the annual income exceeding the average. Families were required to pay the fine.

The one-child policy was a tool for China to not only address overpopulation, but to also address poverty alleviation and increase social mobility by consolidating the combined inherited wealth of the two previous generations into the investment and success of one child instead of having these resources spread thinly across multiple children. This theoretically allowed for a &quot;demographic dividend&quot; to be realized, increasing economic growth and increasing gross national income per capita.

If the family was not able to pay the &quot;social child-raising fee&quot;, then their child would not be able to obtain a , a legal registration document that was required in order to marry, attend state-funded schools, or to receive health care. Many who were unable to pay the fee never attempted to obtain their for fear that the government would force extra fees upon them. Although some provinces had declared that payment of the &quot;social child-raising fee&quot; was not required to obtain a , most provinces still required families to pay retroactive fines after registration.

=== Contraception and sterilization ===
Since the 1970s, the intrauterine device (IUD) has been one of the most widely promoted and practiced forms of contraception. It was the primary alternative to sterilization. As directed, the IUD was medically implanted into women in their child-bearing years to prevent pregnancies, thus out of order births. In the 1980s, women either had to receive an IUD after giving birth to their first child, or the husband would have to undergo a vasectomy. Between 1980 and 2014, 324 million Chinese women received IUDs and 108 million were sterilized. By law, the IUD was placed four months after the delivery of the first child. It was only medically removed after permission to conceive is granted by the community based upon various laws and policies on childbirth quotas. Despite this, some midwives illegally removed the device from their patients. This led to IUD inspections, ensuring that the IUD remained in place. Permanent legal removal of IUDs happens once a woman reaches menopause. In 2016 as means of loosening restrictions and abolishing the one-child policy, the Chinese government now covers the price of IUD removals.

The most widely used alternative to IUDs has been sterilization. As the leading form of contraception in China, sterilization has included both tubal ligation and vasectomy. Starting in the early 1970s, massive sterilization campaigns swept across the country. Urban and rural birth planning and family planning services situated themselves in every community. Cash payments or other material rewards and fines acted as incentives, increasing the number of participants. Socially willing participants were considered role models in the community. In 1983 mandatory sterilization occurred after the birth of the second or third child. As the restrictions tightened a few years later, if a woman gave birth to two children, legally she had to be sterilized. Alternatively, in some cases her husband could be sterilized in her place. In other cases, sterilization of surplus children occurred.

In the early years of the sterilization campaigns, abortion was a method of birth control highly encouraged by family planning. With 55 percent of abortion recipients as repeat customers and the procedure easily accessible, women had chosen to abort and had been forced to abort because of laws, social pressure, discovery of secret pregnancy, and community birth quotas. In 1995, the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) warned against abortion as a means of family planning and as a contraceptive. Should an abortion be required, the woman was to have a safe procedure done by a registered physician. Despite this, some women even in the 2000s chose or were encouraged to use traditional abortive products such as blister beetles, also known as &quot;Mylabris&quot;. Women would ingest the toxins orally or by means of douching with the hopes of inducing abortion. An overdose could lead to death of the mother and fetus. The efficacy of these products has been very low with a high mortality rate. The medical community and PRC have warned against use of these traditional methods.

The priorities of individual families also played a role in the birth rate. Families debated the social and economic stability of the household prior to conception. Some families chose to follow the single-child limit due to varying social and economic factors such as marrying later, spacing out children, the cost of raising a child, the fines for having multiple children, birth control policies, and the accessibility of contraceptives. In addition, those who violated the one-child policy could lose their jobs, their titles, a portion of medical insurance, and opportunities for higher education for the second child; they could also face sterilization and the labeling of the second child as a &quot;black child&quot;. All of the variables played an important role in couples&#x27; decisions on when to conceive, placing their social and economic situation above the desire to bear additional children.

Other examples of contraceptives have included the morning-after pill, birth control pills, and condoms. The morning-after pill has made up 70 percent of oral contraceptives in the Chinese market. Only seven percent of Chinese women had shared that they use the pill and condom in combination. The Chinese government promoted the use of IUDs and sterilization over the combined pill and condom because PRC authorities questioned the voluntary commitment of the public. The Chinese government has distributed free condoms at medical clinics and health centers to adults with proof that they are 18 years of age or older. Additionally, the rate and highly debated sexual education have increased awareness of sex and contraceptive measures among groups of China&#x27;s young population, further lowering the birth rate.

=== Evasion ===

Some couples paid fines to have a second or third child, and others would attempt to circumvent the policy by having non-pregnant friends take the mandatory blood tests.

=== Propaganda ===
The National Family Planning committee developed the slogan (&#x27;later, longer, and fewer&#x27;), which was first enacted in 1973 and was in effect until 1979. This national idea encouraged later marriages and having fewer children. However, this policy was not effective at enforcing the developing ideal of having fewer children since it was such a new concept that had never been seen in other regions of the world. The various problems that arose during its introduction were slowly addressed and it became progressively more targeted to corner women into limited control over their own bodies.

The slogan emerged during the 1970s as a response to China&#x27;s rapid population growth, which was viewed as a major obstacle to the country&#x27;s economic and social development. This slogan encapsulated three key principles: marrying later (, ), spacing pregnancies farther apart (, ), and having fewer children (, ) and was emblematic of China&#x27;s national campaign of mandatory birth planning. The Chinese government aimed to reduce population growth by promoting guidelines for birth control and family planning. The government believed that having fewer children and spacing births more adequately would allow families to allocate more resources per child, resulting in better health and education outcomes for children. The policy aimed to achieve this by allowing parents more time and resources to invest in each child&#x27;s health and education, as they would have fewer children to care for.

The &quot;later, longer, fewer&quot; campaign was later replaced by the one-child policy. According to Whyte and colleagues, many of the coercive techniques that became notorious after the one-child policy was launched actually date from this campaign in the 1970s.

During the campaign, the state bureaucracy was in charge of enforcing birth control and oversaw birth-planning workers in every village, urban work unit, and neighborhood. These workers kept detailed records on women of child-bearing age, including past births, contraceptive usage, and menstrual cycles, often becoming &quot;menstrual monitors&quot; to detect out-of-quota pregnancies. In some factories, there were quotas for reproduction, and women who did not receive a birth allotment were not supposed to get pregnant.

Women who became pregnant without permission were harassed to get an abortion, with pressure also put on their husbands and other family members. Families were threatened that, if they persisted in having an over-quota birth, the baby would be denied household registration, which would mean denial of ration coupons, schooling, and other essential benefits that depended upon registration. In rural areas, women who gave birth to a third child were pressured to get sterilized or have IUDs inserted, while urban women were trusted to continue using effective contraception until they were no longer fertile.

Official statistics show that birth control operations, including abortions, IUD insertions, and sterilizations, increased sharply during the 1970s in association with the campaign to enforce birth limits. These drastic increases in birth-control operations suggest that highly coercive birth planning enforcement was already prevalent in both rural and urban areas, preceding the launch of the one-child policy. However, during the 1970s, the Chinese government was still concerned that the policy would not reduce the growing population sufficiently. They felt the population would grow too fast to be supported, and a one-child policy for all families was introduced in 1979.

Many of the tactics used by the government were reflected in the day-to-day life of the average Chinese citizen. Since the Chinese government could not outright force its inhabitants to follow strict policy orders, the government developed strategies to encourage and promote individuals to take on this responsibility themselves. A common technique was placing an emphasis on family bonds and how having one child per family would increase emotional ties in parent-offspring relationships as well as extended family giving all their attention to fewer children. While the message of population reduction was urgent and required immediate attention, it was more important for the government to stop conception and new pregnancies. The Family Planning Commission spread propaganda by placing pictures and images on everyday items. Aside from signs and posters on billboards, advertisements were placed on postage stamps, milk cartons, food products and many other household items to promote the benefits of having one child.

Propaganda took many forms throughout the one-child policy era and was able to target a wide range of age demographics. Children born in this time period spent most of their lives being exposed to the new expectations placed on them by society. Educational programs were also encouraged to promote one-child policy expectations. Many young teenagers were required to read (1981), which emphasized the importance of family planning and birth control measures that would ensure the stability of the nation. Younger generations became the main target audience for much of the propaganda as the one-child policy continued, since they made up a large portion of the population that would contribute to continued growth if no policy was put in place.

The one-child campaign extensively used propaganda posters. The aim of the posters was to promote the policy, encourage compliance, and emphasize the benefits of having fewer children. Many of the posters were educational in nature, paying attention to reproduction, sexuality, and conception. They were produced by various government departments, ranging from ministries of health to local population policy centers.

To convey the idea that couples should only have one child, the one-child campaign utilized traditional visual elements from (New Year prints) that were popular among the people. Traditionally, these prints employ visual symbols to convey good wishes for the coming new year. In the prints, young children often have been portrayed with pink, chubby cheeks to symbolize the success of family reproduction and a hopeful future. Even without slogans, these pictures were effective in establishing a link between luck and prosperity associated with the New Year and the one-child policy. Traditional elements like chubby, healthy-looking babies resonated with people – making them believe that compliance with the policy would yield luck, good fortune, and healthy offspring.
As the one-child campaign progressed, the policy was linked to national development and wealth. It was considered directly linked to the success of the policy of modernization and reform.

By promoting the one-child policy on a daily basis, the government was able to convince the people that it was their duty to fulfill this nationalistic pride. Once the idea and initial steps of this policy were introduced into society, it was regulated by local policy enforcers until finally becoming an internal obligation the community accepted for the greater good of maintaining a nation. In many cases, health centers encouraged the idea of reducing the risks of pregnancy by distributing various forms of contraceptives at no cost, which made protected sex more common than unprotected sex.

=== Material incentives ===
Couples who only had one child received healthcare subsidies (), retirement funds, and larger grain allowances.

===Relaxation===
In 2013, Deputy Director Wang Peian of the National Health and Family Planning Commission said that &quot;China&#x27;s population will not grow substantially in the short term.&quot; A survey by the commission found that only about half of eligible couples wish to have two children, mostly because of the cost of living impact of a second child.

In November 2013, following the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), China announced the decision to relax the one-child policy. Under the new policy, families could have two children if one parent, rather than both parents, was an only child. This mainly applied to urban couples, since there were very few rural, only children due to long-standing exceptions to the policy for rural couples. Zhejiang, one of the most affluent provinces, became the first area to implement this &quot;relaxed policy&quot; in January 2014, and 29 out of the 31 provinces had implemented it by July 2014, with the exceptions of Xinjiang and Tibet. Under this policy, approximately 11million couples in China were allowed to have a second child; however, only &quot;nearly one million&quot; couples applied to have a second child in 2014, less than half the expected number of 2 million per year. By May 2014, 241,000 out of 271,000 applications had been approved. Officials of China&#x27;s National Health and Family Planning Commission claimed that this outcome was expected, and that the &quot;second-child policy&quot; would continue progressing with a good start.

===Abolition===

In October 2015, the Chinese news agency Xinhua announced the government&#x27;s plans to abolish the one-child policy, now allowing all families to have two children, citing a communiqué issued by the CCP &quot;to improve the balanced development of population&quot;an apparent reference to the country&#x27;s female-to-male sex ratioand to deal with an aging population. The new law took effect on 1 January 2016 after it was passed in the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress on 27 December 2015.

The rationale for the abolition was summarized by former &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; reporter Mei Fong: &quot;The reason China is doing this right now is because they have too many men, too many old people, and too few young people. They have this huge crushing demographic crisis as a result of the one-child policy. And if people don&#x27;t start having more children, they&#x27;re going to have a vastly diminished workforce to support a huge aging population.&quot; China&#x27;s ratio is about five working adults to one retiree; the huge retiree community must be supported, and that will dampen future growth, according to Fong.
Since the citizens of China are living longer and having fewer children, the growth of the population imbalance is expected to continue. A United Nations projection forecast that &quot;China will lose 67million working-age people by 2030, while simultaneously doubling the number of elderly. That could put immense pressure on the economy and government resources.&quot; The longer-term outlook is also pessimistic, based on an estimate by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, revealed by Cai Fang, deputy director. &quot;By 2050, one-third of the country will be aged 60 years or older, and there will be fewer workers supporting each retired person.&quot;

Although many critics of China&#x27;s reproductive restrictions approved of the policy&#x27;s abolition, Amnesty International said that the move to the two-child policy would not end forced sterilizations, forced abortions, or government control over birth permits. Others had also stated that the abolition was not a sign of the relaxation of authoritarian control in China. A reporter for CNN said, &quot;It was not a sign that the party will suddenly start respecting personal freedoms more than it has in the past. No, this is a case of the party adjusting policy to conditions. [...] The new policy, raising the limit to two children per couple, preserves the state&#x27;s role.&quot;

The abolition having a significant benefit was uncertain, as a CBC News analysis indicated: &quot;Repealing the one-child policy may not spur a huge baby boom, however, in part because fertility rates are believed to be declining even without the policy&#x27;s enforcement. Previous easings of the one-child policy have spurred fewer births than expected, and many people among China&#x27;s younger generations see smaller family sizes as ideal.&quot; The CNN reporter added that China&#x27;s new prosperity was also a factor in the declining birth rate, saying, &quot;Couples naturally decide to have fewer children as they move from the fields into the cities, become more educated, and when women establish careers outside the home.&quot;

The Chinese government had expected the abolition of the one-child rule would lead to an increase in births to about 21.9 million births in 2018. The actual number of births was 15.2 million – the lowest birth rate since 1961.

On 31 May 2021, China&#x27;s government relaxed restrictions even more, allowing women up to three children. This change was brought about mainly due to the declining birth rate and population growth. Although the Chinese government was trying to spark new growth in the population, some experts did not think it would be enough. Many called for the government to remove the limit altogether, though most women and couples already had adopted the idea that one child is enough and to have more is not in their best interest. Because of this new belief, the population would be likely to keep declining, which could have tragic repercussions for China in the coming decades.

All restrictions were lifted on 26 July 2021, thus allowing Chinese couples to have any number of children. In 2022, the number of births in China hit another record low of 9.56 million births, the first time the number had dipped below 10 million since the late 1940s according to China Daily. 9.02 million births took place in 2023. Falling numbers of women of childbearing age and reluctance of young women to have children had reduced the China&#x27;s fertility rate to close to 1.0 by 2024 (a fertility rate of 2.1 is needed for a stable population). A study by the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences and Victoria University, Melbourne, Australia forecast China&#x27;s population would be 525 million in 2100 compared to 1.4 billion in 2024. In September 2024 China announced the retirement age would be raised as from January 2025 as there were too few young people and a growing senior population.

== Public responses ==
In addition to stories of resistance to the policy and official reasons for support such as strengthening China, academic Sarah Mellors Rodriguez describes a surprising number of accounts from her fieldwork in which interviewees fully supported the mandate for personal reasons. According to Mellors Rodriguez, for some couples the policy affirmed their own personal beliefs that having smaller families was wiser and more economical.

=== Urban responses ===
China&#x27;s urban population generally accepted the policy, given the already crowded circumstances and shortage of housing in cities. Incentives offered by the state also were effective to make the urban population compliant with the newly introduced family planning. Families that signed the single-child pledge and met the requirements of having only one child were given access to housing and daycare, while non-compliant ones would receive penalties. Examples are obstructing the parents&#x27; careers and delaying the payment of their salaries.

In her fieldwork interviews, Mellors Rodriguez found that middle income urbanites were more receptive to the limitations of the policy because they generally believed that having one child and providing them with all possible opportunities was more important than having additional heirs. Long-term urban residents also reported that supporting multiple children was expensive and burdensome.

=== Rural responses ===
The rural population was more resistant to the policy and variations upon the policy were permitted. Mothers of a daughter in several rural provinces were allowed to have a single additional child (a &quot;1.5-child&quot; policy) and families in remote areas a second or third child. After collective co-ops were dismantled and decollectivization took place, children became more valued by their parents, as a source of agricultural production, and as a source of the care required by ageing parents. Due to the inherently patrilocal nature of marriage, it was expected that daughters would leave their parents and contribute labor to their husbands&#x27; households. The consequent preference for sons came into conflict with the one-child policy and government enforcement of this policy.

Coercive enforcement measures were taken, and included abortions of &quot;over-quota&quot; pregnancies, and sterilization of women. This led to a series of physical conflicts with the government cadres who were assigned to enforce the policy in a specific rural area. Rural families wished to add sons to their families in order to contribute to agricultural production. But the cadres came on the way in conflict with them. Many cadres were middle-aged women who went through the collective period when childbearing was encouraged. They experienced continuous childbearing, and so were strongly supportive of the one-child policy. When these two distinct groups disapproved of each other, conflicts came. More than that, rural families that were desperate to have a son would abuse women who could not give birth to one. They also abandoned infant girls and even engaged in infanticide. As a result, societal relationships were tense within families and also between the cadres and people.

Since the 1990s, rural policy violations decreased sharply. Anthropologist Yan Yunxiang attributes this decrease to greater acceptance of family planning among the new generation of parents, as well as their increased prioritization of material comforts and individual happiness.

==Effects==

=== Population ===

Below are the results of the first three National Population Census of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (). The first two censuses date back to the 1950s and 1960s, and the last one in the 1980s. They were conducted in 1953, 1964, and 1982 respectively.

Below are the results of population investigation after the implementation of one-child policy.

=== Fertility reduction ===

The total fertility rate in China continued its fall from 2.8 births per woman in 1979 (already a sharp reduction from more than five births per woman in the early 1970s) to 1.5 by the mid-1990s. Some scholars claim that this decline is similar to that observed in other places that had no one-child restrictions, such as Thailand as well as the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu, a claim designed to support the argument that China&#x27;s fertility might have fallen to such levels anyway without draconian fertility restrictions.

According to a 2017 study in the &quot;Journal of Economic Perspectives&quot;, &quot;the one-child policy accelerated the already-occurring drop in fertility for a few years, but in the longer term, economic development played a more fundamental role in leading to and maintaining China&#x27;s low fertility level&quot;. However, a more recent study found that China&#x27;s fertility decline to very low levels by the mid-1990s was far more impressive given its lower level of socio-economic development at that time; even after taking rapid economic development into account, China&#x27;s fertility restrictions likely averted over 500 million births between 1970 and 2015, with the portion caused by one-child restrictions possibly totaling 400 million. Fertility restrictions also had unintended consequences such as a deficit of 40 million female babies, most of which was due to sex-selective abortion, and the accelerated aging of China&#x27;s population.

===Disparity in sex ratio at birth===

The sex ratio of a newborn infant (between male and female births) in mainland China reached 117:100, and stabilized between 2000 and 2013, about 10% higher than the baseline, which ranges between 103:100 and 107:100. It had risen from 108:100 in 1981—at the boundary of the natural baseline—to 111:100 in 1990. According to a report by the National Population and Family Planning Commission, there would be 30million more men than women in 2020, potentially leading to social instability, and courtship-motivated emigration. The estimate of 30 million cited for the sex disparity, however, may have been very exaggerated, as birth statistics have been skewed by late registrations and unreported births: for instance, researchers have found that census statistics for women in later stages of life do not match the birth statistics.

The disparity in the gender ratio at birth increased dramatically after the first birth, for which the ratios remained steadily within the natural baseline over the 20-year interval between 1980 and 1999. Thus, a large majority of couples appeared to accept the outcome of the first pregnancy, whether it was a boy or a girl. If the first child was a girl, and they were able to have a second child, then a couple may have taken extraordinary steps to assure that the second child was a boy. If a couple already had two or more boys, the sex ratio of higher parity births swung decidedly in a feminine direction. This demographic evidence indicates that while families highly valued having male offspring, a secondary norm of having a girl or having some balance in the sexes of children often came into play. Yi Zeng (1993) reported a study based on the 1990 census in which they found sex ratios of just 65 or 70 boys per 100 girls for births in families that already had two or more boys. A study by found a similar pattern among both Han and non-Han nationalities in Xinjiang Province: a strong preference for girls in high parity births in families that had already borne two or more boys. This tendency to favour girls in high-parity births to couples who had already borne sons was later also noted by Coale and Banister, who suggested as well that once a couple had achieved its goal for the number of males, it was also much more likely to engage in &quot;stopping behavior&quot;, i.e., to stop having more children.

The long-term disparity led to a significant gender imbalance or skewing of the sex ratio. As reported by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation in 2015, China had between 32million and 36million more males than would be expected naturally, and this led to social problems. &quot;Because of a traditional preference for baby boys over girls, the one-child policy is often cited as the cause of China&#x27;s skewed sex ratio [...] Even the government acknowledges the problem and has expressed concern about the tens of millions of young men who won&#x27;t be able to find brides and may turn to kidnapping women, sex trafficking, other forms of crime or social unrest.&quot; The situation was not expected improve in the near future. According to the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, there would be 24 million more men than women of marriageable age by 2020.

As the gender gap became more prominent due to the preference of male children over female offspring, policy enforcers shifted their attention to promoting the benefits that came with having daughters. In rural, isolated regions of China, the government provided families with a daughter more access to education and other resources such as job opportunities to parents in order to encourage the idea that having a daughter also has a positive impact on the family.

In December 2016, researchers at the University of Kansas reported that the sex disparity in China was likely exaggerated due to administrative under-reporting and delayed registration of females, rather than abortion and infanticide. The finding concluded that as many as 10 to 15 million missing women had not been properly registered at birth since 1982. The study found that the sex ratios of age groups during the one-child policy were similar to those born in the period without the single-child policy. The study also found significant amounts of females appear after the age of ten due to late registration across different age groups. The reason for under-reporting was attributed to families trying to avoid penalties when girls are born and local government concealing the lack of enforcement from the central government. This implied that the sex disparity of the Chinese newborns was likely exaggerated significantly in previous analyses. Though the degree of data discrepancy, the challenge in relation to the sex-ratio imbalance in China is still disputed among scholars.

===Education===
The one-child policy has been a factor in China&#x27;s rapid increase in higher educational attainment.

Research shows that a stricter fertility policy would induce higher female educational achievement. Prior to the one-child policy, roughly 30% of women attended higher education, whereas between 1990 and 1992, 50 percent of students in higher education were women. The higher participation rate of women in education could be attributed to the lack of male siblings. As a result, families invested in their single female child. Several studies conclude that girls on average received more years of schooling thanks to the one child policy.

===Adoption and abandonment===
The one-child policy prompted the growth of orphanages in the 1980s. For parents who had &quot;unauthorized&quot; births, or who wanted a son but had a daughter, giving up their child for adoption was a strategy to avoid penalties under one-child restrictions. Many orphanages witnessed an influx of baby girls, as families would abandon them in favor of having a male child. Many families also kept their illegal children hidden so that they would not be punished by the government. In fact, &quot;out adoption&quot; was not uncommon in China even before birth planning. In the 1980s, adoptions of daughters accounted for slightly above half of the so-called &quot;missing girls&quot;, as out-adopted daughters often went unreported in censuses and surveys, while adoptive parents were not penalized for violating the birth quota. However, in 1991, a central decree attempted to close off this loophole by raising penalties and levying them on any household that had an &quot;unauthorized&quot; child, including those which had adopted children. This closing of the adoption loophole resulted in the abandonment of some two million Chinese children, most of whom were daughters; many of these children ended up in orphanages, with approximately 120,000 of them being adopted by parents from abroad.

The peak wave of abandonment occurred in the 1990s, with a smaller wave after 2000. Around the same time, poor care and high mortality rates in some state orphanages generated intense international pressure for reform.

After 2005, the number of international adoptions declined, due both to falling birth rates and the related increase in demand for adoptions by Chinese parents themselves. In an interview with National Public Radio on 30 October 2015, Adam Pertman, president and CEO of the National Center on Adoption and Permanency, indicated that &quot;the infant girls of yesteryear have not been available, if you will, for five, seven years. China has been ... trying to keep the girls within the country ... And the consequence is that, today, rather than those young girls who used to be available – primarily girls – today, it&#x27;s older children, children with special needs, children in sibling groups. It&#x27;s very, very different.&quot;

=== Transnational adoption ===
In April 1992, China implemented laws that enabled foreigners to adopt their orphan children, with the number of children each orphanage could offer for international adoption being limited by the China Center of Adoption Affairs. That same year, 206 children were adopted to the United States, according to the U.S. State Department. Since then, the demand for healthy infant girls increased and transnational adoption increased rapidly. In accordance with this high demand, China began defining more restrictions on foreign adoption, including limitations on applicant&#x27;s age, marital status, mental and physical health, income, family size, and education. According to the U.S. State Department, there have been over 80,000 international adoptions from China since international adoptions were implemented.

As the flow of foreigners adopting from China increased, so did illicit adoption practices. Families in China that did not or could not keep their child would often be subject to abandonment or infanticide. Abandoned babies often found themselves in orphanages, ready to be adopted. This also made it easy for governments to engage in the trafficking of children. In the years between 2002 and 2005, officials in Hunan and Guangdong provinces profited from the buying and trafficking of approximately 1,000 abducted babies for international adoption.

===Twins===
Since there were no penalties for multiple births, it was believed that an increasing number of couples were turning to fertility medicine to induce the conception of twins. According to a 2006 &quot;China Daily&quot; report, the number of twins born per year was estimated to have doubled. A 2016 study concluded that the increase in the policy fine of one year&#x27;s income is associated with an increase in twin births by approximately 0.07 per 1,000 births, indicating that at least one-third of the increase in twins since the 1970s could be explained by the one-child policy.

=== Quality of life for women ===

The increase in the number of only-child girls resulted in gradual changes in social norms regarding gender, including a decrease in the inequalities between women and men.

The one-child policy&#x27;s limit on the number of children resulted in new mothers having more resources to start investing money in their own well-being. As a result of being an only child, women had increased opportunities to receive an education and support to get better jobs. One side effect of the one-child policy was the liberation of women from the significant duties of taking care of many children and the family in the past; instead, women have had more time for themselves to pursue their career or hobbies. The other major side effect of the policy was that the traditional concepts of gender roles between men and women have weakened. Being one and the only &quot;chance&quot; the parents have, women have been expected to compete with peer men for better educational resources or career opportunities. Especially in cities where the one-child policy was much more regulated and enforced, expectations for women to succeed in life are no less than for men. Recent data has shown that the proportion of women attending college is higher than that of men. The policy also had a positive effect at 10 to 19 years of age on the likelihood of completing senior high school in women of Han ethnicity. At the same time, the one-child policy reduced the economic burden for each family. The average conditions for each family improved. As a result, women also have had much more freedom within the family. They have been supported by family to pursue life achievements. Mothers who complied with the policy were able to have longer maternity leave periods as long as they were older than 24. The government encouraged couples to start family planning at an older age. Since many of these women were employed, the incentive to have later births was to provide paid leave as long as they followed the expectation of having one child. However, if they happened to have a second pregnancy they were stripped of their privileges and were not given the same resources compared to their first birth. During this time period, another shift in attitude towards women was the harsh punishment they would receive if they acted against the newly established policy. In areas such as Shanghai, women faced similar punishments as men, while before the Revolution they tended to have more lenient penalties.

Women&#x27;s experiences of the one-child policy shaped their perceptions of it, both of which have been studied extensively by researchers. These studies have revealed a variety of perspectives. While some women viewed the policy as beneficial, particularly in terms of providing better educational and employment opportunities for their children, others experienced significant negative effects, including gender-based discrimination, psychological distress, and social stigma as a byproduct of the policy. One study by Greenhalgh et al. (2005) found that many urban women in China perceived the one-child policy as positive, as it allowed them to have greater control over their reproductive health and career trajectories. These women also valued the educational and economic opportunities afforded to their single child, which were seen as providing a pathway out of poverty and towards upward mobility. However, the same study also found that women&#x27;s perceptions of the one-child policy were heavily influenced by their social and economic circumstances. For example, women who were unable to afford the fines associated with violating the policy were more likely to form negative perceptions, as were women who faced pressure from their families to have a male child. Another study by Poston and Glover (2005) found that women in rural China were more likely to view the policy as negative. These women reported experiencing significant pressure to have a male child, and those who were unable to do so faced social stigma and discrimination. The distress and pressure to bear a son inflicted on women through marriage, family, and career expectations made Chinese women more likely than men to be diagnosed with schizophrenia and to commit suicide, contrary to the rates observed in Western countries addition, women who violated the policy by having a second child were subject to fines, job loss, and other penalties, which could have significant economic and social consequences. A study by Mosher (2012) found that women who underwent forced abortions or sterilizations as a result of the one-child policy experienced significant psychological distress, including depression, anxiety, and trauma. These women reported feeling violated and traumatized by the forced abortions and sterilizations that occurred as a byproduct of the one-child policy. Such experiences could have long-lasting effects on their mental health and wellbeing. Taken together, these studies suggest that women&#x27;s diverse perceptions of the one-child policy were based on their individual experiences with it. These experiences were heavily dependent on women&#x27;s social and economic circumstances, which led to varied perceptions and attitudes on the policy. While some women perceived it as positive, particularly in urban areas, others experienced significant negative effects, including psychological distress and social stigma. The divorce risk was 43% higher for one-girl couples than one-boy couples in rural China during the 2000s, a disparity not found among urban couples who were under less extreme pressure to bear a son. Parents, especially mothers, had to hide pregnancy and birth under great duress, often fleeing from one village to another or from the country to towns. Mothers during both pregnancy and delivery had to stay away from public facilities of maternal and infant health care. 
===Healthcare improvements===
The one-child policy contributed to China&#x27;s decrease in maternal and child mortality.

It is reported that the focus of China on population planning has helped to provide better healthcare for women and a reduction in the risks of death and injury associated with pregnancy. Women and children were eligible for preferential hospital treatment. At family planning offices, women received free contraception and prenatal classes that contributed to the policy&#x27;s success in two respects. First, the average Chinese household has expended fewer resources, both in terms of time and money, on children, giving many more money to invest. Second, since Chinese adults would no longer rely on children to care for them in their old age, there has been an impetus to save money for the future.

===&quot;Four-two-one&quot; problem===

As the first generation of legally enforced only-children came of age to become parents themselves, one adult child was left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents. Called the &quot;4-2-1 Problem&quot;, this leaves the older generations with increased chances of dependency on retirement funds or charity in order to receive support. If not for personal savings, pensions or state welfare, most senior citizens would be left entirely dependent upon their very small family or neighbours for assistance. If for any reason, the single child is unable to care for their older adult relatives, the oldest generations would face a lack of resources and necessities. In response to such an issue, by 2007, all provinces in the nation except Henan had adopted a new policy allowing couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves; Henan followed in 2011.

=== Impact on elder care ===
China&#x27;s one-child policy had significant implications for many aspects of Chinese society, including care for elderly populations. In &quot;Gender and elder care in China: the influence of filial piety and structural constraints,&quot; authors Zhan and Montgomery suggest that the decline of traditional family support networks began with the establishment of work units in the socialist period. These collectives were meant to offer healthcare and housing to their workers. With the economic reforms of the 1980s and 1990s, many of the work units dissolved, leaving many elderly workers without the social support they once had. This was exacerbated by the one-child policy because many families now only had one child to care for elderly parents, leading to increased pressure and responsibility for the sole caregiver.

According to a study by Gustafson (2014), the one-child policy has led to a significant decrease in the availability of family caregivers for the elderly in China. So, tens of millions of retirees now only have one child to rely on for care. This has led to an &quot;inverted pyramid,&quot; in which two sets of elderly parents must rely on a single married couple of two adult children (each of whom is an only child with no siblings), who in turn have produced a single child on whom the family must eventually rely on in the next generation.

The one-child policy in China has had a significant impact on filial piety and elder care. Filial piety is a traditional Confucian value that emphasizes respect, obedience, and care for one&#x27;s parents and elders. However, the one-child policy has led to a smaller pool of potential caregivers for elderly parents, and has also contributed to a shift in attitudes toward elder care.

One study found that the one-child policy has led to a decline in filial piety in China, as fewer children are responsible for caring for their elderly parents. The study also found that the one-child policy has led to a shift in the responsibility for elder care from the family to the state. For example, Feng argued in 2010 that the Chinese government had increased efforts to build residential elder care services by actively promoting the construction of senior housing, homes for the aged, and nursing homes. This included government-sponsored subsidies to spur construction and operation of new facilities. The Virtual Elder Care Home has gained popularity, which features home-care agencies providing a wide range of personal care and homemaker services in elders&#x27; homes. Services are initiated by phone calls to a local government-sponsored information and service center, which then directs a qualified service provider to the elder&#x27;s home. Participating providers contract with the local government and are reimbursed for services purchased by the government on behalf of eligible care recipients. While these programs are mainly centered in urban areas, current policy directives in rural areas favor institutions by encouraging &quot;centralized support and care&quot; in rural homes that are run and subsidized by the local government. For rural elders who do not have the option to turn to residential facilities, many have resorted to signing a &quot;family support agreement&quot; contract with adult children to ensure needed support and care.

Furthermore, another study found that the one-child policy has had a significant impact on the quality of elder care in China, with many elderly parents reporting feeling neglected and abandoned by their adult children. This is due to a lack of resources and support from the younger generation.

===Unregistered children===
&quot;Heihaizi&quot; () or &#x27;black child&#x27; is a term denoting children born outside the one-child policy, or generally children who are not registered in the Chinese national household registration system.

Being excluded from the family register means they do not possess a , which is &quot;an identifying document, similar in some ways to the American social security card&quot;. In this respect they do not legally exist and as a result cannot access most public services, such as education and health care, and do not receive protection under the law.

===Potential social problems &amp; &quot;little emperor&quot; phenomenon===

In urban areas especially, a byproduct of the one-child policy has been changing family dynamics. Traditionally, grandparents had been the focal point of the family in China: they were adored by all family members, and were the ones who exercised decision-making in the day-to-day life of the family. Feng suggests that the implementation of the one-child policy and the resulting numbers of one-child families have greatly reduced the multigenerational family form and has weakened the central position of elders in the family. Feng also suggests that the one-child policy has caused parents to spend less leisure time alone, and more leisure time with their children. Feng writes, &quot;[t]he children tend to rely more so on their parents as companions and to participate together in recreational activities.&quot; He continues, &quot;[t]his has promoted an equality in the parent-child relationship and has restricted to a certain extent the interactions of children with others.&quot; In the one-child family, the core is the parent-child relationship and research suggests that the husband-wife relationship has been less emphasized and cultivated as a result. In China, the one-child policy has been associated with the term &quot;little emperor,&quot; which describes the perceived effects of parents focusing their attention exclusively on their only child. The term gained popularity as a way to suggest that only children may become &quot;spoiled brats&quot; due to the excess attention they receive from their parents.

A study by Cameron and colleagues explored this phenomenon, finding that the one-child policy had behavioral impacts on only children. The authors tested Beijing youths born in several birth cohorts just before and just after the launch of the one-child policy using economic games designed to detect differences in desirable social behaviors like trust and altruism. The study found that only children in China were more likely to exhibit narcissistic and selfish behavior compared to those with siblings. The study also found that only children had higher levels of academic achievement, but lower levels of social competence and empathy. Overall, these findings suggest that the one-child policy had unintended social and psychological consequences that may have lasting effects on Chinese society as a whole.

Other scholarship supports that the &quot;little emperor&quot; phenomenon does exist. Jiao and colleagues compared children between the ages of four and ten from urban and suburban areas of Beijing using peer ratings of cooperativeness, leadership, and other desirable traits. When they analyzed a matched sample of only children and children with siblings from similar backgrounds, they reported constant patterns in which the only children were rated less positively.

However, researchers Chen and Jin outline some of the arguably positive byproducts of this &quot;little emperor&quot; phenomenon. They suggest that, since only children receive more attention and resources from their parents, it can lead to improved academic performance and overall success in life.

With the first generation of children born under the policy (which initially became a requirement for most couples with first children born starting in 1979 and extending into the 1980s) reaching adulthood, such worries were reduced.

Toni Falbo, a professor of educational psychology and sociology at the University of Texas at Austin came to the conclusion that no measurable differences exist in terms of sociability and characterization between singleton children and multi-sibling children except that single children scored higher on intelligence and achievement – due to a lack of &quot;dilution of resources&quot;.

Some 30 delegates called on the government in the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference in March 2007 to abolish the one-child rule, citing &quot;social problems and personality disorders in young people&quot;. One statement read, &quot;It is not healthy for children to play only with their parents and be spoiled by them: it is not right to limit the number to two children per family, either.&quot; The proposal was prepared by Ye Tingfang, a professor at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, who suggested that the government at least restore the previous rule that allowed couples to have up to two children. According to a scholar, &quot;The one-child limit is too extreme. It violates nature&#x27;s law and, in the long run, this will lead to mother nature&#x27;s revenge.&quot;

===Birth tourism===
Reports surfaced of Chinese women giving birth to their second child overseas, a practice known as birth tourism. Many went to Hong Kong, which is exempt from the one-child policy. Likewise, a Hong Kong passport differs from China&#x27;s mainland passport by providing additional advantages. Recently though, the Hong Kong government has drastically reduced the quota of births set for non-local women in public hospitals.

As the United States practices birthright citizenship, all children born in the US automatically have US citizenship at birth. The closest US location from China is Saipan in the Northern Mariana Islands, a US dependency in the western Pacific Ocean that generally allows Chinese citizens to visit for 14 days without requiring a visa. As of 2012, the Northern Mariana Islands were experiencing an increase in births by Chinese citizens because birth tourism there had become cheaper than in Hong Kong. This option is used by relatively affluent Chinese who may want their children to have the option of living in the US as adults.

===Sex-selective abortion===
Due to the preference in rural Chinese society to give birth to a son, prenatal sex discernment and sex-selective abortions are illegal in China. It is often argued as one of the key factors in the imbalanced sex ratio in China, as excess female infant mortality and under-reporting of female births cannot solely explain this gender disparity. Researchers found that the gender of the firstborn child in rural parts of China impacted whether or not the mother would seek an ultrasound for the second child. 40% of women with a firstborn son sought an ultrasound for their second pregnancy, versus 70% of women with firstborn daughters. This represented a desire for women to have a son if one had not yet been born. In response to this, the Chinese government made sex-selective abortions illegal in 2005.

In China, male children have always been favored over female children. With the one-child policy in place, many parents often chose abortions to meet the one-child standard as well as for the satisfaction of having a male son. Male offspring were preferred in rural areas to ensure parents&#x27; security in their old age since daughters were expected to marry and support their husbands&#x27; family. A common saying in rural areas was , which translates to &#x27;rear a son for your old age&#x27;. After the initial forced sterilization and abortion campaign in 1983, citizens of urban areas in China disagreed with the standards being placed on them by the government and having complete disregard for basic human rights. This led to the Chinese government straying away from the forced sterilization processes in attempts to encourage civilian compliance.

=== Savings rate ===
The one-child policy has been a factor behind China&#x27;s high urban household savings rate.

== Criticism ==
The policy was controversial outside China for many reasons, including accusations of human rights abuses in the implementation of the policy, as well as concerns about negative social consequences.

===Statement of the effect of the policy on birth reduction===
The Chinese government, quoting Zhai Zhenwu, director of Renmin University&#x27;s School of Sociology and Population in Beijing, estimates that 400million births were prevented by the one-child policy as of 2011, while some demographers challenge that number, putting the figure at perhaps half that level, according to CNN. Zhai clarified that the 400million estimate referred not just to the one-child policy, but includes births prevented by predecessor policies implemented one decade before, stating that &quot;there are many different numbers out there but it doesn&#x27;t change the basic fact that the policy prevented a really large number of births&quot;.

This claim is disputed by Wang Feng, director of the Brookings-Tsinghua Center for Public Policy, and Cai Yong from the Carolina Population Center at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Wang argues that &quot;Thailand and China have had almost identical fertility trajectories since the mid 1980s&quot;, and &quot;Thailand does not have a one-child policy&quot;.
China&#x27;s Health Ministry has also disclosed that at least 336million abortions were performed on account of the policy.

According to a report by the US embassy, scholarship published by Chinese scholars and their presentations at the October 1997 Beijing conference of the International Union for the Scientific Study of Population seemed to suggest that market-based incentives or increasing voluntariness is not morally better but that it is, in the end, more effective. In 1988, Zeng Yi and Professor T. Paul Schultz of Yale University discussed the effect of the transformation to the market on Chinese fertility, arguing that the introduction of the contract responsibility system in agriculture during the early 1980s weakened family planning controls during that period. Zeng contended that the &quot;big cooking pot&quot; system of the People&#x27;s Communes had insulated people from the costs of having many children. By the late 1980s, economic costs and incentives created by the contract system were already reducing the number of children farmers wanted.

A long-term experiment in a county in Shanxi, in which the family planning law was suspended, suggested that families would not have many more children even if the law were abolished. A 2003 review of the policy-making process behind the adoption of the one-child policy shows that less intrusive options, including those that emphasized delay and spacing of births, were known but not fully considered by China&#x27;s political leaders.

===Unequal enforcement===
Corrupted government officials and especially wealthy individuals have often been able to violate the policy in spite of fines. Filmmaker Zhang Yimou had three children and was subsequently fined 7.48million yuan ($1.2million). For example, between 2000 and 2005, as many as 1,968 officials in Hunan province were found to be violating the policy, according to the provincial family planning commission; also exposed by the commission were 21 national and local lawmakers, 24 political advisors, 112 entrepreneurs and 6 senior intellectuals.

Some of the offending officials did not face penalties, although the government did respond by raising fines and calling on local officials to &quot;expose the celebrities and high-income people who violate the family planning policy and have more than one child&quot;. Also, people who lived in the rural areas of China were allowed to have two children without punishment, although the family is required to wait a couple of years before having another child.

===Human rights violations===

The one-child policy had been challenged for violating a human right to determine the size of one&#x27;s own proper family. According to a 1968 proclamation of the International Conference on Human Rights, &quot;Parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children.&quot;

According to the UK newspaper &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, a quota of 20,000 abortions and sterilizations was set for Huaiji County, Guangdong in one year due to reported disregard of the one-child policy. According to the article local officials were being pressured into purchasing portable ultrasound devices to identify abortion candidates in remote villages. The article also reported that women as far along as 8.5 months pregnant were forced to abort, usually by an injection of saline solution. A 1993 book by social scientist and anti-abortion political activist Steven W. Mosher reported that women in their ninth month of pregnancy, or already in labour, were having their children killed whilst in the birth canal or immediately after birth.

According to a 2005 news report by Australian Broadcasting Corporation correspondent John Taylor, China outlawed the use of physical force to make a woman submit to an abortion or sterilization in 2002 but ineffectively enforced the measure. In 2012, Feng Jianmei, a villager from Shaanxi province, was forced into an abortion by local officials after her family refused to pay the fine for having a second child. Chinese authorities later apologized and two officials were fired, while five others were sanctioned.

In the past, China promoted eugenics as part of its population-planning policies, but the government backed away from such policies, as evidenced by China&#x27;s ratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which compels the nation to significantly reform its genetic testing laws. Recent research has also emphasized the necessity of understanding a myriad of complex social relations that affect the meaning of informed consent in China. Furthermore, in 2003, China revised its marriage registration regulations and couples no longer have to submit to a premarital physical or genetic examination before being granted a marriage license.

The United Nations Population Fund&#x27;s (UNFPA) support for family planning in China, which had been associated in the United States with the one-child policy, led the U.S. Congress to pull out of the UNFPA during the Reagan administration, and again under George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency, citing human rights abuses and stating that the right to &quot;found a family&quot; was protected under the Preamble in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Barack Obama resumed U.S. government financial support for the UNFPA shortly after taking office in 2009, intending to &quot;work collaboratively to reduce poverty, improve the health of women and children, prevent HIV/AIDS and provide family planning assistance to women in 154 countries&quot;.

===Effect on infanticide rates===
Sex-selective abortion, abandonment, and infanticide are illegal in China. Nevertheless, the US Department of State, the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and the human rights organization Amnesty International have all declared that infanticide still exists. A writer for the &quot;Georgetown Journal of International Affairs&quot; wrote, &quot;The &#x27;one-child&#x27; policy has also led to what Amartya Sen first called &#x27;Missing Women&#x27;, or the 100million girls &#x27;missing&#x27; from the populations of China (and other developing countries) as a result of female infanticide, abandonment, and neglect&quot;.

The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation offered the following summary as to the long-term effects of sex-selective abortion and abandonment of female infants:

Anthropologist G. William Skinner at the University of California, Davis and Chinese researcher Yuan Jianhua have claimed that infanticide was fairly common in China before the 1990s.

<text>In optics, the Arago spot, Poisson spot, or Fresnel spot is a bright point that appears at the center of a circular object&#x27;s shadow due to Fresnel diffraction. This spot played an important role in the discovery of the wave nature of light and is a common way to demonstrate that light behaves as a wave.

The basic experimental setup requires a point source, such as an illuminated pinhole or a diverging laser beam. The dimensions of the setup must comply with the requirements for Fresnel diffraction. Namely, the Fresnel number must satisfy
formula_1
where
* is the diameter of the circular object,
* is the distance between the object and the screen, and
* is the wavelength of the source.

Finally, the edge of the circular object must be sufficiently smooth.

These conditions together explain why the bright spot is not encountered in everyday life. However, with the laser sources available today, it is undemanding to perform an Arago-spot experiment.

In astronomy, the Arago spot can also be observed in the strongly defocussed image of a star in a Newtonian telescope. There, the star provides an almost ideal point source at infinity, and the secondary mirror of the telescope constitutes the circular obstacle.

When light shines on the circular obstacle, Huygens&#x27; principle says that every point in the plane of the obstacle acts as a new point source of light. The light coming from points on the circumference of the obstacle and going to the center of the shadow travels exactly the same distance, so all the light passing close by the object arrives at the screen in phase and constructively interferes. This results in a bright spot at the shadow&#x27;s center, where geometrical optics and particle theories of light predict that there should be no light at all.

== History ==

At the beginning of the 19th century, the idea that light does not simply propagate along straight lines gained traction. Thomas Young published his double-slit experiment in 1807. The original Arago spot experiment was carried out a decade later and was the deciding experiment on the question of whether light is a particle or a wave. It is thus an example of an &quot;experimentum crucis&quot;.

At that time, many favored Isaac Newton&#x27;s corpuscular theory of light, among them the theoretician Siméon Denis Poisson. In 1818 the French Academy of Sciences launched a competition to explain the properties of light, where Poisson was one of the members of the judging committee. The civil engineer Augustin-Jean Fresnel entered this competition by submitting a new wave theory of light.

Poisson studied Fresnel&#x27;s theory in detail and, being a supporter of the particle theory of light, looked for a way to prove it wrong. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he argued that a consequence of Fresnel&#x27;s theory was that there would exist an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle, where there should be complete darkness according to the particle theory of light. This prediction was seen as an absurd consequence of the wave theory, and the failure of that prediction should be a strong argument to reject Fresnel&#x27;s theory.

However, the head of the committee, Dominique-François-Jean Arago, decided to actually perform the experiment. He molded a 2 mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax. He succeeded in observing the predicted spot, confirming Fresnel&#x27;s prediction.

Arago later noted that the phenomenon (later known as &quot;Poisson&#x27;s spot&quot; or the &quot;spot of Arago&quot;) had already been observed by Delisle and Maraldi a century earlier.

Although Arago&#x27;s experimental result was overwhelming evidence in favor of the wave theory, a century later, in conjunction with the birth of quantum mechanics (and first suggested in one of Albert Einstein&#x27;s &quot;Annus Mirabilis&quot; papers), it became understood that light (as well as all forms of matter and energy) must be described as both a particle and a wave (wave–particle duality). However the particle associated with electromagnetic waves, the photon, has nothing in common with the particles imagined in the corpuscular theory that had been dominant before the rise of the wave theory and Arago&#x27;s powerful demonstration. Before the advent of quantum theory in the late 1920s, only the wave nature of light could explain phenomena such as diffraction and interference. Today it is known that a diffraction pattern appears through the mosaic-like buildup of bright spots caused by single photons, as predicted by Dirac&#x27;s quantum theory. With increasing light intensity the bright dots in the mosaic diffraction pattern just assemble faster. In contrast, the wave theory predicts the formation of an extended continuous pattern whose overall brightness increases with light intensity.

== Theory ==

At the heart of Fresnel&#x27;s wave theory is the Huygens–Fresnel principle, which states that every unobstructed point of a wavefront becomes the source of a secondary spherical wavelet and that the amplitude of the optical field &quot;E&quot; at a point on the screen is given by the superposition of all those secondary wavelets taking into account their relative phases. This means that the field at a point P1 on the screen is given by a surface integral:
formula_2
where the inclination factor formula_3 which ensures that the secondary wavelets do not propagate backwards is given by
formula_4
and
* &quot;A&quot; is the amplitude of the source wave
* formula_5 is the wavenumber
* &quot;S&quot; is the unobstructed surface.

The first term outside of the integral represents the oscillations from the source wave at a distance &quot;r&quot;0. Similarly, the term inside the integral represents the oscillations from the secondary wavelets at distances &quot;r&quot;1.

In order to derive the intensity behind the circular obstacle using this integral one assumes that the experimental parameters fulfill the requirements of the near-field diffraction regime (the size of the circular obstacle is large compared to the wavelength and small compared to the distances &quot;g&quot; = P0C and &quot;b&quot; = CP1). Going to polar coordinates then yields the integral for a circular object of radius &quot;a&quot; (see for example Born and Wolf):
formula_6

This integral can be solved numerically (see below). If &quot;g&quot; is large and &quot;b&quot; is small so that the angle formula_7 is not negligible one can write the integral for the on-axis case (P1 is at the center of the shadow) as (see Sommerfeld):
formula_8

The source intensity, which is the square of the field amplitude, is formula_9 and the intensity at the screen formula_10. The on-axis intensity as a function of the distance &quot;b&quot; is hence given by:
formula_11

This shows that the on-axis intensity at distances &quot;b&quot; much greater than the diameter of the circular obstacle is the same as the source intensity, as if the circular object was not present at all. However at larger distances &quot;b&quot;, it turns out that the &quot;size&quot; of the bright spot (as can be seen in the simulations below where &quot;b/a&quot; is increased in successive images) is larger therefore making the spot easier to discern.

=== Calculation of diffraction images ===

To calculate the full diffraction image that is visible on the screen one has to consider the surface integral of the previous section. One cannot exploit circular symmetry anymore, since the line between the source and an arbitrary point on the screen does not pass through the center of the circular object. With the aperture function formula_12 which is 1 for transparent parts of the object plane and 0 otherwise (i.e. It is 0 if the direct line between source and the point on the screen passes through the blocking circular object.) the integral that needs to be solved is given by:
formula_13

Numerical calculation of the integral using the trapezoidal rule or Simpson&#x27;s rule is not efficient and becomes numerically unstable especially for configurations with large Fresnel number. However, it is possible to solve the radial part of the integral so that only the integration over the azimuth angle remains to be done numerically. For a particular angle one must solve the line integral for the ray with origin at the intersection point of the line P0P1 with the circular object plane. The contribution for a particular ray with azimuth angle formula_14 and passing a transparent part of the object plane from formula_15 to formula_16 is:
formula_17

So for each angle one has to compute the intersection point(&quot;s&quot;) of the ray with the circular object and then sum the contributions formula_18 for a certain number of angles between 0 and formula_19. Results of such a calculation are shown in the following images.

The images are simulations of the Arago spot in the shadow of discs of diameter 4 mm, 2 mm, and 1 mm, imaged 1 m behind each disc. The disks are illuminated by light of wavelength of 633 nm, diverging from a point 1 m in front of each disc. Each image is 16 mm wide.

== Experimental aspects ==
=== Intensity and size ===

For an ideal point source, the intensity of the Arago spot equals that of the undisturbed wave front. Only the width of the Arago spot intensity peak depends on the distances between source, circular object and screen, as well as the source&#x27;s wavelength and the diameter of the circular object. This means that one can compensate for a reduction in the source&#x27;s wavelength by increasing the distance between the circular object and screen or reducing the circular object&#x27;s diameter.

The lateral intensity distribution on the screen has in fact the shape of a squared zeroth Bessel function of the first kind when close to the optical axis and using a plane wave source (point source at infinity):
formula_20
where
* &quot;r&quot; is the distance of the point &quot;P&quot;1 on the screen from the optical axis
* &quot;d&quot; is the diameter of circular object
* &quot;λ&quot; is the wavelength
* &quot;b&quot; is the distance between circular object and screen.

The following images show the radial intensity distribution of the simulated Arago spot images above:

The red lines in these three graphs correspond to the simulated images above, and the green lines were computed by applying the corresponding parameters to the squared Bessel function given above.

=== Finite source size and spatial coherence ===

The main reason why the Arago spot is hard to observe in circular shadows from conventional light sources is that such light sources are bad approximations of point sources. If the wave source has a finite size &quot;S&quot; then the Arago spot will have an extent that is given by &quot;Sb&quot;/&quot;g&quot;, as if the circular object acted like a lens. At the same time the intensity of the Arago spot is reduced with respect to the intensity of the undisturbed wave front. Defining the relative intensity formula_21as the intensity divided by the intensity of the undisturbed wavefront, the relative intensity for an extended circular source of diameter w can be expressed exactly using the following equation:
formula_22
where formula_23and formula_24are the Bessel functions of the first kind. formula_25 is the radius of the disc casting the shadow, formula_26 the wavelength and formula_27 the distance between source and disc. For large sources the following asymptotic approximation applies:
formula_28

=== Deviation from circularity ===

If the cross-section of the circular object deviates slightly from its circular shape (but it still has a sharp edge on a smaller scale) the shape of the point-source Arago spot changes. In particular, if the object has an ellipsoidal cross-section the Arago spot has the shape of an evolute. Note that this is only the case if the source is close to an ideal point source. From an extended source the Arago spot is only affected marginally, since one can interpret the Arago spot as a point-spread function. Therefore, the image of the extended source only becomes washed out due to the convolution with the point-spread function, but it does not decrease in overall intensity.

=== Surface roughness of circular object ===

The Arago spot is very sensitive to small-scale deviations from the ideal circular cross-section. This means that a small amount of surface roughness of the circular object can completely cancel out the bright spot. This is shown in the following three diagrams which are simulations of the Arago spot from a 4 mm diameter disc ():

The simulation includes a regular sinusoidal corrugation of the circular shape of amplitude 10 μm, 50 μm and 100 μm, respectively. Note, that the 100 μm edge corrugation almost completely removes the central bright spot.

This effect can be best understood using the Fresnel zone concept. The field transmitted by a radial segment that stems from a point on the obstacle edge provides a contribution whose phase is tight to the position of the edge point relative to Fresnel zones. If the variance in the radius of the obstacle are much smaller than the width of Fresnel zone near the edge, the contributions form radial segments are approximately in phase and interfere constructively. However, if random edge corrugation have amplitude comparable to or greater than the width of that adjacent Fresnel zone, the contributions from radial segments are no longer in phase and cancel each other reducing the Arago spot intensity.

The adjacent Fresnel zone is approximately given by:
formula_29

The edge corrugation should not be much more than 10% of this width to see a close to ideal Arago spot. In the above simulations with the 4 mm diameter disc the adjacent Fresnel zone has a width of about 77 μm.

== Arago spot with matter waves ==

In 2009, the Arago spot experiment was demonstrated with a supersonic expansion beam of deuterium molecules (an example of neutral matter waves). Material particles behaving like waves is known from quantum mechanics. The wave nature of particles actually dates back to de Broglie&#x27;s hypothesis as well as Davisson and Germer&#x27;s experiments. An Arago spot of electrons, which also constitute matter waves, can be observed in transmission electron microscopes when examining circular structures of a certain size.

The observation of an Arago spot with large molecules, thus proving their wave-nature, is a topic of current research.

== Other applications==

Beside the demonstration of wave-behavior, the Arago spot also has a few other applications. One of the ideas is to use the Arago spot as a straight line reference in alignment systems. Another is to probe aberrations in laser beams by using the spot&#x27;s sensitivity to beam aberrations. Finally, the aragoscope has been proposed as a method for dramatically improving the diffraction-limited resolution of space-based telescopes.

<text>The Battle of Hastings was fought on 14 October 1066 between the Norman-French army of William, Duke of Normandy, and an English army under the Anglo-Saxon king Harold Godwinson, beginning the Norman Conquest of England. It took place approximately northwest of Hastings, close to the present-day town of Battle, East Sussex, and was a decisive Norman victory.

The background to the battle was the death of the childless king Edward the Confessor in January 1066, which set up a succession struggle between several claimants to his throne. Harold was crowned king shortly after Edward&#x27;s death but faced invasions by William, his own brother Tostig, and the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada (Harold III of Norway). Hardrada and Tostig defeated a hastily gathered army of Englishmen at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September 1066. They were in turn defeated by Harold at the Battle of Stamford Bridge five days later. The deaths of Tostig and Hardrada at Stamford Bridge left William as Harold&#x27;s only serious opponent. While Harold and his forces were recovering, William landed his invasion forces in the south of England at Pevensey on 28 September 1066 and established a beachhead for his conquest of the kingdom. Harold was forced to march south swiftly, gathering forces as he went.

The exact numbers present at the battle are unknown as even modern estimates vary considerably. The composition of the forces is clearer: the English army was composed almost entirely of infantry and had few archers, whereas only about half of the invading force was infantry, the rest split equally between cavalry and archers. Harold appears to have tried to surprise William, but scouts found his army and reported its arrival to William, who marched from Hastings to the battlefield to confront Harold. The battle lasted from about 9 am to dusk. Early efforts of the invaders to break the English battle lines had little effect. Therefore, the Normans adopted the tactic of pretending to flee in panic and then turning on their pursuers. Harold&#x27;s death, probably near the end of the battle, led to the retreat and defeat of most of his army. After further marching and some skirmishes, William was crowned as king on Christmas Day 1066.

There continued to be rebellions and resistance to William&#x27;s rule, but Hastings effectively marked the culmination of William&#x27;s conquest of England. Casualty figures are hard to come by, but some historians estimate that 2,000 invaders died along with about twice that number of Englishmen. William founded a monastery at the site of the battle, the high altar of the abbey church supposedly placed at the spot where Harold died.

==Background==
In 911, the Carolingian ruler Charles the Simple allowed a group of Vikings to settle in Normandy under their leader Rollo. Their settlement proved successful, and they quickly adapted to the indigenous culture, renouncing paganism, converting to Christianity, and intermarrying with the local population. Over time, the frontiers of the duchy expanded to the west. In 1002, King Æthelred II married Emma, the sister of Richard II, Duke of Normandy. Their son Edward the Confessor spent many years in exile in Normandy, and succeeded to the English throne in 1042. This led to the establishment of a powerful Norman interest in English politics, as Edward drew heavily on his former hosts for support, bringing in Norman courtiers, soldiers, and clerics and appointing them to positions of power, particularly in the Church. Edward was childless and embroiled in conflict with the formidable Godwin, Earl of Wessex, and his sons, and he may also have encouraged Duke William of Normandy&#x27;s ambitions for the English throne.

===Succession crisis in England===
King Edward&#x27;s death on 5 January 1066 left no clear heir, and several contenders laid claim to the throne of England. Edward&#x27;s immediate successor was the Earl of Wessex, Harold Godwinson, the richest and most powerful of the English aristocrats and son of Godwin, Edward&#x27;s earlier opponent. Harold was elected king by the Witenagemot of England and crowned by Ealdred, the Archbishop of York, although Norman propaganda claimed that the ceremony was performed by Stigand, the uncanonically elected Archbishop of Canterbury. Harold was at once challenged by two powerful neighbouring rulers. Duke William claimed that he had been promised the throne by King Edward and that Harold had sworn agreement to this. Harald Hardrada of Norway also contested the succession. His claim to the throne was based on an agreement between his predecessor Magnus the Good and the earlier king of England Harthacnut, whereby, if either died without heir, the other would inherit both England and Norway. William and Harald Hardrada immediately set about assembling troops and ships for separate invasions.

===Tostig and Hardrada&#x27;s invasions===

In early 1066, Harold&#x27;s exiled brother Tostig Godwinson raided southeastern England with a fleet he had recruited in Flanders, later joined by other ships from Orkney. Threatened by Harold&#x27;s fleet, Tostig moved north and raided in East Anglia and Lincolnshire. He was driven back to his ships by the brothers Edwin, Earl of Mercia and Morcar, Earl of Northumbria. Deserted by most of his followers, he withdrew to Scotland, where he spent the middle of the year recruiting fresh forces. Hardrada invaded northern England in early September, leading a fleet of more than 300 ships carrying perhaps 15,000 men. Hardrada&#x27;s army was further augmented by the forces of Tostig, who supported the Norwegian king&#x27;s bid for the throne. Advancing on York, the Norwegians occupied the city after defeating a northern English army under Edwin and Morcar on 20 September at the Battle of Fulford.

==English army and Harold&#x27;s preparations==
The English army was organised along regional lines, with the &quot;fyrd&quot;, or local levy, serving under a local magnate – whether an earl, bishop or sheriff. The &quot;fyrd&quot; was composed of men who owned their own land, and were equipped by their community to fulfil the king&#x27;s demands for military forces. For every five hides, or units of land nominally capable of supporting one household, one man was supposed to serve. It appears that the hundred was the main organising unit for the &quot;fyrd&quot;. As a whole, England could furnish about 14,000 men for the &quot;fyrd&quot;, when it was called out. The &quot;fyrd&quot; usually served for two months, except in emergencies. It was rare for the whole national &quot;fyrd&quot; to be called out; between 1046 and 1065 it was only done three times, in 1051, 1052, and 1065. The king also had a group of personal armsmen, known as housecarls, who formed the backbone of the royal forces. Some earls also had their own forces of housecarls. Thegns, the local landowning elites, either fought with the royal housecarls or attached themselves to the forces of an earl or other magnate. The &quot;fyrd&quot; and the housecarls both fought on foot, with the major difference between them being the housecarls&#x27; superior armour. The English army does not appear to have had a significant number of archers.

Harold had spent mid-1066 on the south coast with a large army and fleet waiting for William to invade. The bulk of his forces were militia who needed to harvest their crops, so on 8 September, Harold dismissed the militia and the fleet. Learning of the Norwegian invasion he rushed north, gathering forces as he went, and took the Norwegians by surprise, defeating them at the Battle of Stamford Bridge on 25 September. Harald Hardrada and Tostig were killed, and the Norwegians suffered such great losses that only 24 of the original 300 ships were required to carry away the survivors. The English victory came at great cost, as Harold&#x27;s army was left in a battered and weakened state, and far from the south.

==William&#x27;s preparations and landing==

William assembled a large invasion fleet and an army gathered from Normandy and the rest of France, including large contingents from Brittany and Flanders. He spent almost nine months on his preparations, as he had to construct a fleet from nothing. According to some Norman chronicles, he also secured diplomatic support, although the accuracy of the reports has been a matter of historical debate. The most famous claim is that Pope Alexander II gave a papal banner as a token of support, which only appears in William of Poitiers&#x27;s account, and not in more contemporary narratives. In April 1066 Halley&#x27;s Comet appeared in the sky, and was widely reported throughout Europe. Contemporary accounts connected the comet&#x27;s appearance with the succession crisis in England.

William mustered his forces at Saint-Valery-sur-Somme, and was ready to cross the English Channel by about 12 August. But the crossing was delayed, either because of unfavourable weather or to avoid being intercepted by the powerful English fleet. The Normans crossed to England a few days after Harold&#x27;s victory over the Norwegians, following the dispersal of Harold&#x27;s naval force, and landed at Pevensey in Sussex on 28 September. A few ships were blown off course and landed at Romney, where the Normans fought the local &quot;fyrd&quot;. After landing, William&#x27;s forces built a wooden castle at Hastings, from which they raided the surrounding area. More fortifications were erected at Pevensey.

===Norman forces at Hastings===
The exact numbers and composition of William&#x27;s force are unknown. A contemporary document claims that William had 776 ships, but this may be an inflated figure. Figures given by contemporary writers for the size of the army are highly exaggerated, varying from 14,000 to 150,000. Modern historians have offered a range of estimates for the size of William&#x27;s forces: 7,000–8,000 men including 1,000–2,000 cavalry; 10,000–12,000 men; 10,000 men including 3,000 cavalry; or 7,500 men. The army consisted of about one-half infantry, one-quarter cavalry, and one-quarter archers or crossbowmen. Later lists of companions of William the Conqueror are extant, but most are padded with extra names; only about 35 named individuals can be reliably identified as having been with William at Hastings.

The main armour was chainmail hauberks, usually knee-length, with slits to allow riding, some with sleeves to the elbows. Some hauberks may have been made of scales attached to a tunic, with the scales made of metal, horn or hardened leather. Headgear was usually a conical metal helmet with a vertical band guarding the bridge of the nose. Horsemen and infantry carried shields. The infantryman&#x27;s shield was usually round and made of wood with metal reinforcement. Horsemen changed to a kite-shaped shield and were usually armed with a lance. The couched lance, carried tucked against the body under the right arm, was relatively new and probably not used at Hastings, as the terrain was unfavourable for long cavalry charges. Both infantry and cavalry usually fought with a straight sword, long and double-edged. The infantry could also use javelins and long spears. Some of the cavalry may have used a mace instead of a sword. Archers would have used a self bow or a crossbow, and most would not have had armour.

==Harold moves south==
After defeating his brother Tostig and Harald Hardrada in the north, Harold left much of his forces in the north, including Morcar and Edwin, and marched the rest of his army south to deal with the threatened Norman invasion. It is unclear when Harold learned of William&#x27;s landing, but it was probably during the march. Harold stopped in London for about a week before Hastings, so he likely spent about a week on his march south, averaging about per day, for the approximately . Harold camped at Caldbec Hill on the night of 13 October, near a &quot;hoar-apple tree&quot;, about from William&#x27;s castle at Hastings. Some of the early contemporary French accounts mention an emissary or emissaries sent by Harold to William, which is likely, though nothing came of it.

Although Harold attempted to surprise the Normans, William&#x27;s scouts reported the English arrival to the duke. The exact events preceding the battle are obscure, with contradictory accounts in the sources, but all agree that William&#x27;s army advanced from his castle towards the enemy. Harold had taken a defensive position at the top of Senlac Hill (present-day Battle, East Sussex), about from William&#x27;s castle at Hastings.

===English forces at Hastings===
The exact number of soldiers in Harold&#x27;s army at Hastings is unknown, as contemporary records do not give reliable figures. Some Norman sources give 400,000 to 1,200,000 on Harold&#x27;s side, while English sources seem to underestimate Harold&#x27;s army, perhaps to make the English defeat seem less devastating. Recent historians have suggested figures of between 5,000 and 13,000, while most argue for a figure of 7,000–8,000 English troops. These men would have been a mix of the &quot;fyrd&quot; and housecarls. Few individual Englishmen are known to have been present; about 20 named individuals can reasonably be assumed to have fought with Harold at Hastings, including Harold&#x27;s brothers Gyrth and Leofwine and two other relatives.

The English army consisted entirely of infantry. It is possible that some of the higher-class members of the army rode to battle but then dismounted when battle was joined to fight on foot. The core of the army was made up of housecarls, full-time professional soldiers. Their armour consisted of a conical helmet, a mail hauberk, and a shield, which might be either kite-shaped or round. Most housecarls fought with the two-handed Danish battleaxe, but they could also carry a sword. The rest of the army was made up of levies from the &quot;fyrd&quot;, also infantry but more lightly armoured and not professionals. Most of the infantry would have formed part of the shield wall, in which the front ranks locked their shields together. Behind them would have been axemen and javelins as well as archers.

==Battle==

===Background and location===

Because many of the primary accounts contradict each other at times, it is impossible to provide an authoritative description of the battle. The only undisputed facts are that fighting began at 9 am Saturday 14 October 1066 and that the battle lasted until dusk. Sunset on the day of the battle was at 4:54 pm, with the battlefield mostly dark by 5:54 pm and in full darkness by 6:24 pm. Moonrise that night was not until 11:12 pm, so once the sun set, there was little light on the battlefield. William of Jumièges reports that Duke William kept his army armed and ready against a surprise attack for the entire night before. The battle took place north of Hastings at the present-day town of Battle, between two hills – Caldbec Hill to the north and Telham Hill to the south. The area was heavily wooded, with a marsh nearby. The name traditionally given to the battle is unusual – there were several settlements much closer to the battlefield than Hastings. The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; called it the battle &quot;at the hoary apple tree&quot;. Within 40 years, the battle was described by the Anglo-Norman chronicler Orderic Vitalis as &quot;Senlac&quot;, a Norman-French adaptation of the Old English word &quot;Sandlacu&quot;, which means &quot;sandy water&quot;. This may have been the name of the stream that crosses the battlefield. The battle was already being referred to as &quot;bellum Haestingas&quot; or &quot;Battle of Hastings&quot; by 1086, in the Domesday Book.

The sun rose at 6:48 am that morning, with the day unusually bright. The weather conditions are not recorded. The precise route of the English army southward to the battlefield is not known. Several roads are possible: one, an old Roman road that ran from Rochester to Hastings has long been favoured because of a large coin hoard found nearby in 1876. Another possibility is the Roman road between London and Lewes and then over local tracks to the battlefield. Some accounts of the battle indicate that the Normans advanced from Hastings to the battlefield, but the contemporary account of William of Jumièges places the Normans at the site of the battle the night before. Most historians incline towards the former view, but M. K. Lawson argues that William of Jumièges&#x27;s account is correct.

===Dispositions of forces and tactics===

Harold&#x27;s forces deployed in a small, dense formation at the top of a steep slope, with their flanks protected by woods and marshy ground in front of them. The line may have extended far enough to be anchored on a nearby stream. The English formed a shield wall, with the front ranks holding their shields close together or even overlapping to protect from attack. Sources differ on the exact site that the English fought on: some sources state the site of the abbey, but some newer sources suggest it was Caldbec Hill.

More is known about the Norman deployment. Duke William appears to have arranged his forces in three groups, or &quot;battles&quot;, which roughly corresponded to their origins. The left units were the Bretons, along with those from Anjou, Poitou and Maine. This division was led by Alan the Red, a relative of the Breton count. The centre was held by the Normans, under the direct command of the duke and with many of his relatives and kinsmen grouped around the ducal party. The final division, on the right, consisted of the Frenchmen, along with some men from Picardy, Boulogne, and Flanders. The right was commanded by William fitzOsbern and Count Eustace II of Boulogne. The front lines were made up of archers, with a line of foot soldiers armed with spears behind. There were probably a few crossbowmen and slingers in with the archers. The cavalry was held in reserve, and a small group of clergymen and servants situated at the base of Telham Hill was not expected to take part in the fighting.

William&#x27;s disposition of his forces implies that he planned to open the battle with archers in the front rank weakening the enemy with arrows, followed by infantry who would engage in close combat. The infantry would create openings in the English lines that could be exploited by a cavalry charge to break through the English forces and pursue the fleeing soldiers.

===Beginning of the battle===
The battle opened with the Norman archers shooting uphill at the English shield wall, to little effect. The uphill angle meant that the arrows either bounced off the shields of the English or overshot their targets and flew over the top of the hill. The lack of English archers hampered the Norman archers, as there were few English arrows to be gathered up and reused. After the attack from the archers, William sent the spearmen forward to attack the English. They were met with a barrage of missiles, not arrows but spears, axes and stones. The infantry was unable to force openings in the shield wall, and the cavalry advanced in support. The cavalry also failed to make headway, and a general retreat began, blamed on the Breton division on William&#x27;s left. A rumour started that the duke had been killed, which added to the confusion. The English forces began to pursue the fleeing invaders, but William rode through his forces, showing his face and yelling that he was still alive. The duke then led a counter-attack against the pursuing English forces; some of the English rallied on a hillock before being overwhelmed.

It is not known whether the English pursuit was ordered by Harold or if it was spontaneous. Wace relates that Harold ordered his men to stay in their formations but no other account gives this detail. The Bayeux Tapestry depicts the death of Harold&#x27;s brothers Gyrth and Leofwine occurring just before the fight around the hillock. This may mean that the two brothers led the pursuit. The &quot;Carmen de Hastingae Proelio&quot; relates a different story for the death of Gyrth, stating that the duke slew Harold&#x27;s brother in combat, perhaps thinking that Gyrth was Harold. William of Poitiers states that the bodies of Gyrth and Leofwine were found near Harold&#x27;s, implying that they died late in the battle. It is possible that if the two brothers died early in the fighting their bodies were taken to Harold, thus accounting for their being found near his body after the battle. The military historian Peter Marren speculates that if Gyrth and Leofwine died early in the battle, that may have influenced Harold to stand and fight to the end.

===Feigned flights===

A lull probably occurred early in the afternoon, and a break for rest and food would probably have been needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers&#x27; accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; however most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.

Although the feigned flights did not break the lines, they probably thinned out the housecarls in the English shield wall. The housecarls were replaced with members of the &quot;fyrd&quot;, and the shield wall held. Archers appear to have been used again before and during an assault by the cavalry and infantry led by the duke. Although 12th-century sources state that the archers were ordered to shoot at a high angle to shoot over the front of the shield wall, there is no trace of such an action in the more contemporary accounts. It is not known how many assaults were launched against the English lines, but some sources record various actions by both Normans and Englishmen that took place during the afternoon&#x27;s fighting. The &quot;Carmen&quot; claims that Duke William had two horses killed under him during the fighting, but William of Poitiers&#x27;s account states that it was three.

===Death of Harold===
Harold appears to have died late in the battle, although accounts in the various sources are contradictory. William of Poitiers only mentions his death, without giving any details on how it occurred. The tapestry is not helpful, as it shows a figure holding an arrow sticking out of his eye next to a falling fighter being hit with a sword. Over both figures is a statement &quot;Here King Harold has been killed&quot;. It is not clear which figure is meant to be Harold, or if both are meant. The earliest written mention of the traditional account of Harold dying from an arrow to the eye dates to the 1080s from a history of the Normans written by an Italian monk, Amatus of Montecassino. William of Malmesbury stated that Harold died from an arrow to the eye that went into the brain and that a knight wounded Harold at the same time. Wace repeats the arrow-to-the-eye account. The &quot;Carmen&quot; states that Duke William killed Harold, but this is unlikely, as such a feat would have been recorded elsewhere. The account of William of Jumièges is even more unlikely, as it has Harold dying in the morning, during the first fighting. The &quot;Chronicle of Battle Abbey&quot; states that no one knew who killed Harold, as it happened in the press of battle. A modern biographer of Harold, Ian Walker, states that Harold probably died from an arrow in the eye, although he also says it is possible that Harold was struck down by a Norman knight while mortally wounded in the eye. Another biographer of Harold, Peter Rex, after discussing the various accounts, concludes that it is not possible to declare how Harold died.

Harold&#x27;s death left the English forces leaderless, and they began to collapse. Many of them fled, but the soldiers of the royal household gathered around Harold&#x27;s body and fought to the end. The Normans began to pursue the fleeing troops, and except for a rearguard action at a site known as the &quot;Malfosse&quot;, the battle was over. Exactly what happened at the Malfosse, or &quot;Evil Ditch&quot;, and where it took place, is unclear. It occurred at a small fortification or set of trenches where some Englishmen rallied and seriously wounded Eustace of Boulogne before being defeated by the Normans.

===Reasons for the outcome===

Harold&#x27;s defeat was probably due to several circumstances. One was the need to defend against two almost simultaneous invasions. The fact that Harold had dismissed his forces in southern England on 8 September also contributed to the defeat. Many historians fault Harold for hurrying south and not gathering more forces before confronting William at Hastings, although it is not clear that the English forces were insufficient to deal with William&#x27;s forces. Against these arguments for an exhausted English army, the length of the battle, which lasted an entire day, shows that the English forces were not tired by their long march. Tied in with the speed of Harold&#x27;s advance to Hastings is the possibility Harold may not have trusted Earls Edwin of Mercia and Morcar of Northumbria once their enemy Tostig had been defeated, and declined to bring them and their forces south. Modern historians have pointed out that one reason for Harold&#x27;s rush to battle was to contain William&#x27;s depredations and keep him from breaking free of his beachhead.

Most of the blame for the defeat probably lies in the events of the battle. William was the more experienced military leader, and in addition, the lack of cavalry on the English side allowed Harold fewer tactical options. Some writers have criticised Harold for not exploiting the opportunity offered by the rumoured death of William early in the battle. The English appear to have erred in not staying strictly on the defensive, for when they pursued the retreating Normans they exposed their flanks to attack. Whether this was due to the inexperience of the English commanders or the indiscipline of the English soldiers is unclear. In the end, Harold&#x27;s death appears to have been decisive, as it signalled the break-up of the English forces in disarray. The historian David Nicolle said of the battle that William&#x27;s army &quot;demonstrated – not without difficulty – the superiority of Norman-French mixed cavalry and infantry tactics over the Germanic-Scandinavian infantry traditions of the Anglo-Saxons.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The day after the battle, Harold&#x27;s body was identified, either by his armour or by marks on his body. His personal standard was presented to William, and later sent to the papacy. The bodies of the English dead, including some of Harold&#x27;s brothers and housecarls, were left on the battlefield, although some were removed by relatives later. The Norman dead were buried in a large communal grave, which has not been found. Exact casualty figures are unknown. Of the Englishmen known to be at the battle, the number of dead implies that the death rate was about 50 per cent of those engaged, although this may be too high. Of the named Normans who fought at Hastings, one in seven is stated to have died, but these were all noblemen, and the death rate among the common soldiers was probably higher. Although Orderic Vitalis&#x27;s figures are highly exaggerated, his ratio of one in four casualties may be accurate. Marren speculates that perhaps 2,000 Normans and 4,000 Englishmen were killed at Hastings. Reports stated that some of the English dead were still being found on the hillside years later. Although scholars thought for a long time that remains would not be recoverable, due to the acidic soil, recent finds have changed this view. One skeleton that was found in a medieval cemetery, and originally was thought to be associated with the 13th century Battle of Lewes, now is thought to be associated with Hastings instead.

One story relates that Gytha, Harold&#x27;s mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son&#x27;s body in gold for its custody, but was refused. William ordered that Harold&#x27;s body be thrown into the sea, but whether that took place is unclear. Another story relates that Harold was buried at the top of a cliff. Waltham Abbey, which had been founded by Harold, later claimed that his body had been secretly buried there. Other legends claimed that Harold did not die at Hastings, but escaped and became a hermit at Chester.

William expected to receive the submission of the surviving English leaders after his victory, but instead Edgar the Ætheling was proclaimed king by the Witenagemot, with the support of Earls Edwin and Morcar, Stigand, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Ealdred, the Archbishop of York. William therefore advanced on London, marching around the coast of Kent. He defeated an English force that attacked him at Southwark but was unable to storm London Bridge, forcing him to reach the capital by a more circuitous route.

William moved up the Thames valley to cross the river at Wallingford, where he received the submission of Stigand. He then travelled north-east along the Chilterns, before advancing towards London from the north-west, fighting further engagements against forces from the city. The English leaders surrendered to William at Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire. William was acclaimed King of England and crowned by Ealdred on 25 December 1066, in Westminster Abbey.

Despite the submission of the English nobles, resistance continued for several years. There were rebellions in Exeter in late 1067, an invasion by Harold&#x27;s sons in mid-1068, and an uprising in Northumbria in 1068. In 1069 William faced more troubles from Northumbrian rebels, an invading Danish fleet, and rebellions in the south and west of England. He ruthlessly put down the various risings, culminating in the Harrying of the North in late 1069 and early 1070 that devastated parts of northern England. A further rebellion in 1070 by Hereward the Wake was also defeated by the king, at Ely.

Battle Abbey was founded by William at the site of the battle. According to 12th-century sources, William made a vow to found the abbey, and the high altar of the church was placed at the site where Harold had died. More likely, the foundation was imposed on William by papal legates in 1070. The topography of the battlefield has been altered by subsequent construction work for the abbey, and the slope defended by the English is now much less steep than it was at the time of the battle; the top of the ridge has also been built up and levelled. After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the abbey&#x27;s lands passed to secular landowners, who used it as a residence or country house. In 1976 the estate was put up for sale and purchased by the government with the aid of some American donors who wished to honour the 200th anniversary of American independence. The battlefield and abbey grounds are currently owned and administered by English Heritage and are open to the public.

The Bayeux Tapestry is an embroidered narrative of the events leading up to Hastings probably commissioned by Odo of Bayeux soon after the battle, perhaps to hang at the bishop&#x27;s palace at Bayeux. In modern times annual reenactments of the Battle of Hastings have drawn thousands of participants and spectators to the site of the original battle.

Some English veterans of the battle left England and joined the Varangian Guard in Constantinople. They fought the Normans again at the Battle of Dyrrhachium in 1081, and were defeated again in similar circumstances.

<doc id="44668" wikidata="Q1223829" url="?curid=44668" title="Porcupine">
<text>Porcupines are large rodents with coats of sharp spines, or quills, that protect them against predation. The term covers two families of animals: the Old World porcupines of the family Hystricidae, and the New World porcupines of the family Erethizontidae. Both families belong to the infraorder Hystricognathi within the profoundly diverse order Rodentia and display superficially similar coats of rigid or semi-rigid quills, which are modified hairs composed of keratin. Despite this, the two groups are distinct from one another and are not closely related to each other within the Hystricognathi. The largest species of porcupine is the third-largest living rodent in the world, after the capybara and beaver.

The Old World porcupines (Hystricidae) live in Italy, Asia (western and southern), and most of Africa. They are large, terrestrial, and strictly nocturnal.

The New World porcupines (Erethizontidae) are indigenous to North America and northern South America. They live in wooded areas and can climb trees, where some species spend their entire lives. They are less strictly nocturnal than their Old World counterparts and generally smaller.

Most porcupines are about long, with a long tail. Weighing , they are rounded, large, and slow, and use an aposematic strategy of defence. Porcupines&#x27; colouration consists of various shades of brown, grey and white. Porcupines&#x27; spiny protection resembles that of the only distantly related erinaceomorph hedgehogs and Australian monotreme echidnas as well as tenrecid tenrecs.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;porcupine&quot; comes from the Latin + , from Old Italian &quot;porcospino&quot;, . A regional American name for the animal is &quot;quill-pig&quot;.

A baby porcupine is a porcupette. When born, a porcupette&#x27;s quills are soft hair; they harden within a few days, forming the sharp quills of adults.

==Evolution==

Fossils belonging to the genus &quot;Hystrix&quot; date back to the late Miocene of the continent of Africa.

==Species==
===Taxonomy===
A porcupine is any of 30 species of rodents belonging to the families Erethizontidae (genera: &quot;Coendou&quot;, &quot;Erethizon&quot;, and &quot;Chaetomys&quot;) or Hystricidae (genera: &quot;Atherurus&quot;, &quot;Hystrix&quot;, and &quot;Trichys&quot;). Porcupines vary in size considerably: Rothschild&#x27;s porcupine of South America weighs less than a kilogram (2.2 lb); the crested porcupine found in Italy, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa can grow to well over . The two families of porcupines are quite different, and although both belong to the Hystricognathi branch of the vast order Rodentia, they are not closely related.

===Old World compared with New World species===
The 11 Old World porcupines tend to be fairly large and have spines grouped in clusters.

The two subfamilies of New World porcupines are mostly smaller (although the North American porcupine reaches about in length and ), have their quills attached singly rather than grouped in clusters, and are excellent climbers, spending much of their time in trees. The New World porcupines evolved their spines independently (through convergent evolution) and are more closely related to several other families of rodents than they are to the Old World porcupines.

===Longevity===
Porcupines have a relatively high longevity and hold the record for being the longest-living rodent, with one individual named Cooper living over 32 years.

===Diet===
The North American porcupine is an herbivore and often climbs trees for food; it eats leaves, herbs, twigs, and green plants such as clover. In the winter, it may eat bark. The African porcupine is not a climber; instead, it forages on the ground. It is mostly nocturnal but will sometimes forage for food during the day, eating bark, roots, fruits, berries, and farm crops. Porcupines have become a pest in Kenya and are eaten as a delicacy.

===Defense===
Defensive behaviour displays in a porcupine depend on sight, scent, and sound. Often, these displays are shown when a porcupine becomes agitated or annoyed. There are four main displays seen in a porcupine: (in order from least to most aggressive) quill erection, teeth clattering, odour emission, and attack. A porcupine&#x27;s colouring aids in part of its defence as most of the predators are nocturnal and colour-blind. A porcupine&#x27;s markings are black and white. The dark body and coarse hair of the porcupine are dark brown/black and when quills are raised, present a white strip down its back mimicking the look of a skunk. This, along with the raising of the sharp quills, deters predators. Along with the raising of the quills, porcupines clatter their teeth to warn predators not to approach. The incisors vibrate against each other, the strike zone shifts back, and the cheek teeth clatter. This behaviour is often paired with body shivering, which is used to further display the dangerous quills. The rattling of quills is aided by the hollow quills at the back end of the porcupine. The use of odour is when the sight and sound have failed. An unpleasant scent is produced from the skin above the tail in times of stress and is often seen with a quill erection. If these processes fail, the porcupine will attack by running sideways or backwards into predators. A porcupine&#x27;s tail can also be swung in the direction of the predator; if contact is made, the quills could be impaled into the predator causing injury or death.

====Quills====

Porcupines&#x27; quills, or spines, take on various forms depending on the species, but all are modified hairs coated with thick plates of keratin and are embedded in the skin musculature. Old World porcupines have quills embedded in clusters, whereas in New World porcupines, single quills are interspersed with bristles, underfur, and hair.

Quills are released by contact or may drop out when the porcupine shakes its body. New quills grow to replace lost ones. Despite what is commonly assumed and depicted in media, porcupines cannot launch their quills at range.

There are some possible antibiotic properties within the quills, specifically associated with the free fatty acids coating the quills. The antibiotic properties are believed to aid a porcupine that has suffered from self-injury.

==Uses by humans==

Porcupines are seldom eaten in Western culture but are eaten often in Southeast Asia, particularly Vietnam, where the prominent use of them as a food source has contributed to declines in porcupine populations. 

Naturalist William J. Long reported the taste of the North American porcupine as &quot;vile&quot; and &quot;malodorous&quot; and delightful only to a lover of strong cheese.

More commonly, their quills and guard hairs are used for traditional decorative clothing; for example, their guard hairs are used in the creation of the Native American &quot;porky roach&quot; headdress. The main quills may be dyed and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories, such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the quills for quillwork by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills left stuck in the blanket.

The presence of barbs, acting like anchors, causes increased pain when removing a quill that has pierced the skin. The shape of the barbs makes the quills effective for penetrating the skin and for remaining in place. The quills have inspired research for such applications as the design of hypodermic needles and surgical staples. In contrast to the current design for surgical staples, the porcupine quill and barb design would allow easy and painless insertion, as the staple would stay in the skin using the anchored barb design rather than being bent under the skin like traditional staples. 

Porcupines are also sometimes kept as exotic pets.

==Habitat==

Porcupines occupy a small range of habitats in tropical and temperate parts of Asia, Southern Europe, Africa, and North and South America. They live in forests and deserts, rocky outcrops, and hillsides. Some New World porcupines live in trees, but Old World porcupines prefer a rocky environment. Porcupines can be found on rocky areas up to high. They are generally nocturnal but are occasionally active during daylight.
==Classification==
Porcupines are distributed into two evolutionarily independent groups within the suborder Hystricomorpha of the Rodentia.

<text>Dominique François Jean Arago (), known simply as François Arago (; Catalan: , ; 26 February 17862 October 1853), was a French mathematician, physicist, astronomer, freemason, supporter of the Carbonari revolutionaries and politician.

==Early life and work==
Arago was born at Estagel, a small village of 3,000 near Perpignan, in the &quot;&quot; of Pyrénées-Orientales, France, where his father held the position of Treasurer of the Mint.
His parents were François Bonaventure Arago (1754–1814) and Marie Arago (1755–1845).

Arago was the eldest of four brothers. Jean (1788–1836) emigrated to North America and became a general in the Mexican army. Jacques Étienne Victor (1799–1855) took part in Louis de Freycinet&#x27;s exploring voyage in the &quot;Uranie&quot; from 1817 to 1821, and on his return to France devoted himself to his journalism and the drama. The fourth brother, Étienne Vincent (1802–1892), is said to have collaborated with Honoré de Balzac in &quot;The Heiress of Birague&quot;, and from 1822 to 1847 wrote a great number of light dramatic pieces, mostly in collaboration.

Showing decided military tastes, François Arago was sent to the municipal college of Perpignan, where he began to study mathematics in preparation for the entrance examination of the . Within two years and a half he had mastered all the subjects prescribed for examination, and a great deal more, and, on going up for examination at Toulouse, he astounded his examiner by his knowledge of J.-L. Lagrange&#x27;s work.

Towards the close of 1803, Arago entered the , Paris, but apparently found the professors there incapable of imparting knowledge or maintaining discipline. The artillery service was his ambition, and in 1804, through the advice and recommendation of Siméon Poisson, he received the appointment of secretary to the Paris Observatory. He now became acquainted with Pierre-Simon Laplace, and through his influence was commissioned, with Jean-Baptiste Biot, to complete the meridian arc measurements which had been begun by J. B. J. Delambre, and interrupted since the death of P. F. A. Méchain in 1804 (the meridian arc of Delambre and Méchain). 
Arago and Biot left Paris in 1806 and began operations along the mountains of Spain.
Biot returned to Paris after they had determined the latitude of Formentera, the southernmost point to which they were to carry the survey. Arago continued the work until 1809, his purpose being to measure a meridian arc in order to determine the exact length of a metre (see Paris meridian#History).

After Biot&#x27;s departure, the political ferment caused by the entrance of the French into Spain extended to the Balearic Islands, and the population suspected Arago&#x27;s movements and his lighting of fires on the top of Mount Galatzó (Catalan: Mola de l&#x27;Esclop) as the activities of a spy for the invading army. Their reaction was such that he was obliged to give himself up for imprisonment in the fortress of Bellver in June 1808. On 28 July he escaped from the island in a fishing-boat, and after an adventurous voyage he reached Algiers on 3 August. From there he obtained a passage in a vessel bound for Marseille, but on 16 August, just as the vessel was nearing Marseille, it fell into the hands of a Spanish corsair. With the rest the crew, Arago was taken to Roses, and imprisoned first in a windmill, and afterwards in a fortress, until the town fell into the hands of the French, when the prisoners were transferred to Palamos.

After three months&#x27; imprisonment, Arago and the others were released on the demand of the dey of Algiers, and again set sail for Marseille on 28 November, but then within sight of their port they were driven back by a northerly wind to Bougie on the coast of Africa. Transport to Algiers by sea from this place would have occasioned a weary delay of three months; Arago, therefore, set out over land, guided by a Muslim priest, and reached it on Christmas Day. After six months in Algiers he once again, on 21 June 1809, set sail for Marseille, where he had to undergo a monotonous and inhospitable quarantine in the lazaretto, before his difficulties were over. The first letter he received, while in the lazaretto, was from Alexander von Humboldt; and this was the origin of a connection which, in Arago&#x27;s words, &quot;lasted over forty years without a single cloud ever having troubled it.&quot;

==Scientific studies==
Arago had succeeded in preserving the records of his survey; and his first act on his return home was to deposit them in the Bureau des Longitudes at Paris. As a reward for his adventurous conduct in the cause of science, he was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences, at the remarkably early age of twenty-three, and before the close of 1809 he was chosen by the council of the to succeed Gaspard Monge in the chair of analytical geometry. At the same time he was named by the emperor one of the astronomers of the Paris Observatory, which was accordingly his residence till his death. It was in this capacity that he delivered his remarkably successful series of popular lectures in astronomy, which were continued from 1812 to 1845.

In 1818 or 1819 he proceeded along with Biot to execute geodetic operations on the coasts of France, England and Scotland. They measured the length of the seconds pendulum at Leith, Scotland, and in the Shetland Islands, the results of the observations being published in 1821, along with those made in Spain. Arago was elected a member of the Bureau des Longitudes immediately afterwards, and contributed to each of its Annuals, for about twenty-two years, important scientific notices on astronomy and meteorology and occasionally on civil engineering, as well as interesting memoirs of members of the Academy.

Arago&#x27;s earliest physical researches were on the pressure of steam at different temperatures, and the velocity of sound, 1818 to 1822. His magnetic observations mostly took place from 1823 to 1826. He discovered rotatory magnetism, what has been called Arago&#x27;s rotations, and the fact that most bodies could be magnetized; these discoveries were completed and explained by Michael Faraday.
Arago warmly supported Augustin-Jean Fresnel&#x27;s optical theories, helping to confirm Fresnel&#x27;s wave theory of light by observing what is now known as the spot of Arago. The two philosophers conducted together those experiments on the polarization of light which led to the inference that the vibrations of the luminiferous ether were transverse to the direction of motion, and that polarization consisted of a resolution of rectilinear propagation into components at right angles to each other. The subsequent invention of the polariscope and discovery of Rotary polarization are due to Arago. He invented the first polarization filter in 1812. He was the first to perform a polarimetric observation of a comet when he discovered polarized light from the tail of the Great Comet of 1819.

The general idea of the experimental determination of the velocity of light in the manner subsequently effected by Hippolyte Fizeau and Léon Foucault was suggested by Arago in 1838, but his failing eyesight prevented his arranging the details or making the experiments.

Arago&#x27;s fame as an experimenter and discoverer rests mainly on his contributions to magnetism in the co-discovery with Léon Foucault of eddy currents, and still more to optics. He showed that a magnetic needle, made to oscillate over nonferrous surfaces, such as water, glass, copper, etc., falls more rapidly in the extent of its oscillations according as it is more or less approached to the surface. This discovery, which earned him the Copley Medal of the Royal Society in 1825, was followed by another, that a rotating plate of copper tends to communicate its motion to a magnetic needle suspended over it, which he called &quot;magnetism of rotation&quot; but (after Faraday&#x27;s explanation of 1832) is now known as eddy current. Arago is also fairly entitled to be regarded as having proved the long-suspected connexion between the aurora borealis and the variations of the magnetic elements. In 1827 he was elected an associated member of the Royal Institute of the Netherlands, when that institute became the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1851, he became foreign member. In 1828, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

In optics, Arago not only made important optical discoveries on his own, but is credited with stimulating the genius of Jean-Augustin Fresnel, with whose history, as well as that of Étienne-Louis Malus and Thomas Young, this part of his life is closely interwoven.

Shortly after the beginning of the 19th century the labours of at least three philosophers were shaping the doctrine of the undulatory, or wave, theory of light. Fresnel&#x27;s arguments in favour of that theory found little favour with Laplace, Poisson and Biot, the champions of the emission theory; but they were ardently espoused by Humboldt and by Arago, who had been appointed by the Academy to report on the paper. This was the foundation of an intimate friendship between Arago and Fresnel, and of a determination to carry on together further fundamental laws of the polarization of light known by their means. As a result of this work, Arago constructed a polariscope, which he used for some interesting observations on the polarization of the light of the sky. He also discovered the power of rotatory polarization exhibited by quartz.

Among Arago&#x27;s many contributions to the support of the undulatory hypothesis, comes the &quot;experimentum crucis&quot; which he proposed to carry out for measuring directly the velocity of light in air and in water and glass. On the emission theory the velocity should be accelerated by an increase of density in the medium; on the wave theory, it should be retarded. In 1838 he communicated to the Academy the details of his apparatus, which utilized the relaying mirrors employed by Charles Wheatstone in 1835 for measuring the velocity of the electric discharge; but owing to the great care required in the carrying out of the project, and to the interruption to his labours caused by the revolution of 1848, it was the spring of 1850 before he was ready to put his idea to the test; and then his eyesight suddenly gave way. Before his death, however, the retardation of light in denser media was demonstrated by the experiments of H. L. Fizeau and B. L. Foucault, which, with improvements in detail, were based on the plan proposed by him.

==Politics and legacy==

In 1830, Arago, who always professed liberal opinions of the republican type, was elected a member of the chamber of deputies for the Pyrénées-Orientales &quot;département&quot;, and he employed his talents of eloquence and scientific knowledge in all questions connected with public education, the rewards of inventors, and the encouragement of the mechanical and practical sciences. Many of the most creditable national enterprises, dating from this period, are due to his advocacy – such as the reward to Louis Daguerre for the invention of photography, the grant for the publication of the works of Fermat and Laplace, the acquisition of the museum of Cluny, the development of railways and electric telegraphs, the improvement of the reneile. In 1839, Arago reported the invention of photography to stunned listeners of a joint meeting of the academies of Arts and Sciences.

In 1830, Arago also was appointed director of the Observatory, and as a member of the chamber of deputies he was able to obtain grants of money for rebuilding it in part, and for the addition of magnificent instruments. In the same year, too, he was chosen perpetual secretary of the Academy of Sciences, the place of Joseph Fourier. Arago threw himself into its service, and by his faculty of making friends he gained at once for it and for himself a worldwide reputation. As perpetual secretary it was his duty to pronounce historical eulogies on deceased members; and for this duty his rapidity and facility of thought, and his happy piquancy of style, and his extensive knowledge peculiarly adapted him. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1832.

In 1834, Arago again visited Scotland, to attend the meeting of the British Association at Edinburgh. From this time till 1848 he led a life of comparative quiet – although he continued to work within the Academy and the Observatory to produce a multitude of contributions to all departments of physical science – but on the fall of Louis-Philippe he left his laboratory to join the Provisional Government (24 February 1848). He was entrusted with two important functions, that had never before been given to one person, viz. the ministry of marine and colonies (24 February 184811 May 1848) and ministry of war (5 April 184811 May 1848); in the former capacity he improved rations in the navy and abolished flogging. He also abolished political oaths of all kinds and, against an array of moneyed interests, succeeded in procuring the abolition of slavery in the French colonies.

On 10 May 1848, Arago was elected a member of the Executive Power Commission, a governing body of the French Republic. He was made President of the Executive Power Commission (11 May 1848) and served in this capacity as provisional head of state until 24 June 1848, when collective resignation of the commission was submitted to the National Constituent Assembly. At the beginning of May 1852, when the government of Louis Napoleon required an oath of allegiance from all its functionaries, Arago peremptorily refused, and sent in his resignation of his post as astronomer at the Bureau des Longitudes. This, however, the prince president declined to accept, and made &quot;an exception in favour of a savant whose works had thrown lustre on France, and whose existence the government would regret to embitter.&quot;

Cape Gregory in Oregon was named by Captain Cook on 12 March 1778 after Saint Gregory, the saint of that day; it was renamed Cape Arago after François Arago.

== Last years ==

Arago remained a consistent republican to the end, and after the coup d&#x27;état of 1852, though suffering first from diabetes, then from Bright&#x27;s disease, complicated by dropsy, he resigned his post as astronomer rather than take the oath of allegiance. Napoleon III gave directions that the old man should be in no way disturbed, and should be left free to say and do what he liked. In the summer of 1853 Arago was advised by his physicians to try the effect of his native air, and he accordingly set out to the eastern Pyrenees, but this was ineffective and he died in Paris. His grave is at the famous Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. Arago was an atheist.

== Named after Arago ==

* The study association for Applied Physics at the University of Twente was named after Arago.
* His name is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.
* The outer main-belt asteroid 1005 Arago, an inner ring of Neptune, the lunar crater &quot;Arago&quot; as well as the Martian crater &quot;Arago&quot; were also named in his honor.
* Two French cable ships were named after him, the &quot;François Arago&quot; of 1882 and the &quot;Arago&quot; of 1914/1931.

== Honours ==
* : Officer of the Order of Leopold.
* 1842 Prussian Pour le Mérite for Sciences and Arts.

== Publications ==

Arago&#x27;s works were published after his death under the direction J. A. Barral, in 17 vols., 8vo, 1854–1862 (); also separately his &quot;Astronomie populaire&quot;, in 4 vols.; &quot;Notices biographiques&quot;, in 3 vols.; &quot;Indices scientifiques&quot;, in 5 vols.; &quot;Voyages scientifiques&quot;, in 1 vol.; &quot;Grimoires scientifiques&quot;, in 2 vols.; &quot;Mélanges&quot;, in I vol.; and &quot;Tables analytiques et documents importants (with portrait)&quot;, in 1 vol.

<text>Baron Siméon Denis Poisson (, ; ; 21 June 1781 – 25 April 1840) was a French mathematician and physicist who worked on statistics, complex analysis, partial differential equations, the calculus of variations, analytical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, thermodynamics, elasticity, and fluid mechanics. Moreover, he predicted the Arago spot in his attempt to disprove the wave theory of Augustin-Jean Fresnel.

==Biography==
Poisson was born in Pithiviers, now in Loiret, France, the son of Siméon Poisson, an officer in the French Army.

In 1798, he entered the École Polytechnique, in Paris, as first in his year, and immediately began to attract the notice of the professors of the school, who left him free to make his own decisions as to what he would study. In his final year of study, less than two years after his entry, he published two memoirs: one on Étienne Bézout&#x27;s method of elimination, the other on the number of integrals of a finite difference equation. This was so impressive that he was allowed to graduate in 1800 without taking the final examination. The latter of the memoirs was examined by Sylvestre-François Lacroix and Adrien-Marie Legendre, who recommended that it should be published in the &quot;Recueil des savants étrangers&quot;. an unprecedented honor for a youth of eighteen. This success at once procured entry for Poisson into scientific circles. Joseph-Louis Lagrange, whose lectures on the theory of functions he attended at the École Polytechnique, recognized his talent early on and became his friend. Meanwhile, Pierre-Simon Laplace, in whose footsteps Poisson followed, regarded him almost as his son. The rest of his career until his death in Sceaux, near Paris, was occupied by the composition and publication of his many works and in fulfilling the duties of the numerous educational positions to which he was successively appointed.

Immediately after finishing his studies at the École Polytechnique, he was appointed &quot;répétiteur&quot; (teaching assistant) there, a position which he had occupied as an amateur while still a pupil in the school; for his schoolmates had made a custom of visiting him in his room after an unusually difficult lecture to hear him repeat and explain it. He was made deputy professor (&quot;professeur suppléant&quot;) in 1802, and, in 1806 full professor succeeding Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier, whom Napoleon had sent to Grenoble. In 1808 he became astronomer to the Bureau des Longitudes; and when the Faculté des sciences de Paris was instituted in 1809 he was appointed a professor of rational mechanics (&quot;professeur de mécanique rationelle&quot;). He went on to become a member of the Institute in 1812, examiner at the military school (&quot;École Militaire&quot;) at Saint-Cyr in 1815, graduation examiner at the École Polytechnique in 1816, councillor of the university in 1820, and geometer to the Bureau des Longitudes succeeding Pierre-Simon Laplace in 1827.

In 1817, he married Nancy de Bardi and with her, he had four children. His father, whose early experiences had led him to hate aristocrats, bred him in the stern creed of the First Republic. Throughout the Revolution, the Empire, and the following restoration, Poisson was not interested in politics, concentrating instead on mathematics. He was appointed to the dignity of baron in 1825, but he neither took out the diploma nor used the title. In March 1818, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, in 1822 a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and in 1823 a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. The revolution of July 1830 threatened him with the loss of all his honours; but this disgrace to the government of Louis-Philippe was adroitly averted by François Jean Dominique Arago, who, while his &quot;revocation&quot; was being plotted by the council of ministers, procured him an invitation to dine at the Palais-Royal, where he was openly and effusively received by the citizen king, who &quot;remembered&quot; him. After this, of course, his degradation was impossible, and seven years later he was made a peer of France, not for political reasons, but as a representative of French science.

As a teacher of mathematics Poisson is said to have been extraordinarily successful, as might have been expected from his early promise as a &quot;répétiteur&quot; at the École Polytechnique. Notwithstanding his many official duties, he found time to publish more than three hundred works, several of them extensive treatises, and many of them memoirs dealing with the most abstruse branches of pure mathematics, applied mathematics, mathematical physics, and rational mechanics. (Arago attributed to him the quote, &quot;Life is good for only two things: doing mathematics and teaching it.&quot;)

A list of Poisson&#x27;s works, drawn up by himself, is given at the end of Arago&#x27;s biography. All that is possible is a brief mention of the more important ones. It was in the application of mathematics to physics that his greatest services to science were performed. Perhaps the most original, and certainly the most permanent in their influence, were his memoirs on the theory of electricity and magnetism, which virtually created a new branch of mathematical physics.

Next (or in the opinion of some, first) in importance stand the memoirs on celestial mechanics, in which he proved himself a worthy successor to Pierre-Simon Laplace. The most important of these are his memoirs &quot;Sur les inégalités séculaires des moyens mouvements des planètes&quot;, &quot;Sur la variation des constantes arbitraires dans les questions de mécanique&quot;, both published in the &quot;Journal&quot; of the École Polytechnique (1809); &quot;Sur la libration de la lune&quot;, in &quot;Connaissance des temps&quot; (1821), etc.; and &quot;Sur le mouvement de la terre autour de son centre de gravité&quot;, in &quot;Mémoires de l&#x27;Académie&quot; (1827), etc. In the first of these memoirs, Poisson discusses the famous question of the stability of the planetary orbits, which had already been settled by Lagrange to the first degree of approximation for the disturbing forces. Poisson showed that the result could be extended to a second approximation, and thus made an important advance in planetary theory. The memoir is remarkable inasmuch as it roused Lagrange, after an interval of inactivity, to compose in his old age one of the greatest of his memoirs, entitled &quot;Sur la théorie des variations des éléments des planètes, et en particulier des variations des grands axes de leurs orbites&quot;. So highly did he think of Poisson&#x27;s memoir that he made a copy of it with his own hand, which was found among his papers after his death. Poisson made important contributions to the theory of attraction.

As a tribute to Poisson&#x27;s scientific work, which stretched to more than 300 publications, he was awarded a French peerage in 1837.

His is one of the 72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower.

==Contributions==
=== Potential theory ===

==== Poisson&#x27;s equation ====

In the theory of potentials, Poisson&#x27;s equation, 

: formula_1

is a well-known generalization of Laplace&#x27;s equation of the second order partial differential equation formula_2 for potential formula_3. 

If formula_4 is a continuous function and if for formula_5 (or if a point &#x27;moves&#x27; to infinity) a function formula_6 goes to 0 fast enough, the solution of Poisson&#x27;s equation is the Newtonian potential

:formula_7

where formula_8 is a distance between a volume element formula_9and a point formula_10. The integration runs over the whole space.

Poisson&#x27;s equation was first published in the &quot;Bulletin de la société philomatique&quot; (1813). Poisson&#x27;s two most important memoirs on the subject are &quot;Sur l&#x27;attraction des sphéroides&quot; (Connaiss. ft. temps, 1829), and &quot;Sur l&#x27;attraction d&#x27;un ellipsoide homogène&quot; (Mim. ft. l&#x27;acad., 1835).

Poisson discovered that Laplace&#x27;s equation is valid only outside of a solid. A rigorous proof for masses with variable density was first given by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1839. Poisson&#x27;s equation is applicable in not just gravitation, but also electricity and magnetism.

==== Electricity and magnetism ====

As the eighteenth century came to a close, human understanding of electrostatics approached maturity. Benjamin Franklin had already established the notion of electric charge and the conservation of charge; Charles-Augustin de Coulomb had enunciated his inverse-square law of electrostatics. In 1777, Joseph-Louis Lagrange introduced the concept of a potential function that can be used to compute the gravitational force of an extended body. In 1812, Poisson adopted this idea and obtained the appropriate expression for electricity, which relates the potential function formula_11 to the electric charge density formula_12. Poisson&#x27;s work on potential theory inspired George Green&#x27;s 1828 paper, &quot;An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism&quot;.

In 1820, Hans Christian Ørsted demonstrated that it was possible to deflect a magnetic needle by closing or opening an electric circuit nearby, resulting in a deluge of published papers attempting to explain the phenomenon. Ampère&#x27;s law and the Biot-Savart law were quickly deduced. The science of electromagnetism was born. Poisson was also investigating the phenomenon of magnetism at this time, though he insisted on treating electricity and magnetism as separate phenomena. He published two memoirs on magnetism in 1826. By the 1830s, a major research question in the study of electricity was whether or not electricity was a fluid or fluids distinct from matter, or something that simply acts on matter like gravity. Coulomb, Ampère, and Poisson thought that electricity was a fluid distinct from matter. In his experimental research, starting with electrolysis, Michael Faraday sought to show this was not the case. Electricity, Faraday believed, was a part of matter.

=== Optics ===

Poisson was a member of the academic &quot;old guard&quot; at the Académie royale des sciences de l&#x27;Institut de France, who were staunch believers in the particle theory of light and were skeptical of its alternative, the wave theory. In 1818, the Académie set the topic of their prize as diffraction. One of the participants, civil engineer and opticist Augustin-Jean Fresnel submitted a thesis explaining diffraction derived from analysis of both the Huygens–Fresnel principle and Young&#x27;s double slit experiment.

Poisson studied Fresnel&#x27;s theory in detail and looked for a way to prove it wrong. Poisson thought that he had found a flaw when he demonstrated that Fresnel&#x27;s theory predicts an on-axis bright spot in the shadow of a circular obstacle blocking a point source of light, where the particle-theory of light predicts complete darkness. Poisson argued this was absurd and Fresnel&#x27;s model was wrong. (Such a spot is not easily observed in everyday situations, because most everyday sources of light are not good point sources.)

The head of the committee, Dominique-François-Jean Arago, performed the experiment. He molded a 2 mm metallic disk to a glass plate with wax. To everyone&#x27;s surprise he observed the predicted bright spot, which vindicated the wave model. Fresnel won the competition.

After that, the corpuscular theory of light was dead, but was revived in the twentieth century in a different form, wave-particle duality. Arago later noted that the diffraction bright spot (which later became known as both the Arago spot and the Poisson spot) had already been observed by Joseph-Nicolas Delisle and Giacomo F. Maraldi a century earlier.

=== Pure mathematics and statistics ===
In pure mathematics, Poisson&#x27;s most important works were his series of memoirs on definite integrals and his discussion of Fourier series, the latter paving the way for the classic researches of Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet and Bernhard Riemann on the same subject; these are to be found in the &quot;Journal&quot; of the École Polytechnique from 1813 to 1823, and in the &quot;Memoirs de l&#x27;Académie&quot; for 1823. He also studied Fourier integrals.

Poisson wrote an essay on the calculus of variations (&quot;Mem. de l&#x27;acad.,&quot; 1833), and memoirs on the probability of the mean results of observations (&quot;Connaiss. d. temps,&quot; 1827, &amp;c). The Poisson distribution in probability theory is named after him.

In 1820 Poisson studied integrations along paths in the complex plane, becoming the first person to do so.

In 1829, Poisson published a paper on elastic bodies that contained a statement and proof of a special case of what became known as the divergence theorem.

=== Mechanics ===
==== Analytical mechanics and the calculus of variations ====
Founded mainly by Leonhard Euler and Joseph-Louis Lagrange in the eighteenth century, the calculus of variations saw further development and applications in the nineteenth.

Letformula_13where formula_14. Then formula_15 is extremized if it satisfies the Euler–Lagrange equationsformula_16But if formula_15 depends on higher-order derivatives of formula_18, that is, if formula_19then formula_20 must satisfy the Euler–Poisson equation,formula_21Poisson&#x27;s &quot;Traité de mécanique&quot; (2 vols. 8vo, 1811 and 1833) was written in the style of Laplace and Lagrange and was long a standard work.

Let formula_22 be the position, formula_23 be the kinetic energy, formula_11 the potential energy, both independent of time formula_25. Lagrange&#x27;s equation of motion readsformula_26Here, the dot notation for the time derivative is used, formula_27. Poisson set formula_28. He argued that if formula_11 is independent of formula_30, he could writeformula_31giving formula_32He introduced an explicit formula for momenta,formula_33Thus, from the equation of motion, he gotformula_34Poisson&#x27;s text influenced the work of William Rowan Hamilton and Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. A translation of Poisson&#x27;s Treatise on Mechanics was published in London in 1842. Let formula_35 and formula_36 be functions of the canonical variables of motion formula_37 and formula_38. Then their Poisson bracket is given byformula_39Evidently, the operation anti-commutes. More precisely, formula_40. By Hamilton&#x27;s equations of motion, the total time derivative of formula_41 isformula_42where formula_43 is the Hamiltonian. In terms of Poisson brackets, then, Hamilton&#x27;s equations can be written as formula_44 and formula_45.

Suppose formula_35 is a constant of motion, then it must satisfyformula_47Moreover, Poisson&#x27;s theorem states the Poisson bracket of any two constants of motion is also a constant of motion.

In September 1925, Paul Dirac received proofs of a seminal paper by Werner Heisenberg on the new branch of physics known as quantum mechanics. Soon he realized that the key idea in Heisenberg&#x27;s paper was the anti-commutativity of dynamical variables and remembered that the analogous mathematical construction in classical mechanics was Poisson brackets. He found the treatment he needed in E. T. Whittaker&#x27;s &quot;Analytical Dynamics of Particles and Rigid Bodies&quot;.

==== Continuum mechanics and fluid flow ====

In 1821, using an analogy with elastic bodies, Claude-Louis Navier arrived at the basic equations of motion for viscous fluids, now identified as the Navier–Stokes equations. In 1829 Poisson independently obtained the same result. George Gabriel Stokes re-derived them in 1845 using continuum mechanics. Poisson, Augustin-Louis Cauchy, and Sophie Germain were the main contributors to the theory of elasticity in the nineteenth century. The calculus of variations was frequently used to solve problems.

==== Wave propagation ====
Poisson also published a memoir on the theory of waves (Mém. ft. l&#x27;acad., 1825).

=== Thermodynamics ===
In his work on heat conduction, Joseph Fourier maintained that the arbitrary function may be represented as an infinite trigonometric series and made explicit the possibility of expanding functions in terms of Bessel functions and Legendre polynomials, depending on the context of the problem. It took some time for his ideas to be accepted as his use of mathematics was less than rigorous. Although initially skeptical, Poisson adopted Fourier&#x27;s method. From around 1815 he studied various problems in heat conduction. He published his &quot;Théorie mathématique de la chaleur&quot; in 1835.

During the early 1800s, Pierre-Simon de Laplace developed a sophisticated, if speculative, description of gases based on the old caloric theory of heat, to which younger scientists such as Poisson were less committed. A success for Laplace was his correction of Newton&#x27;s formula for the speed of sound in air that gives satisfactory answers when compared with experiments. The Newton–Laplace formula makes use of the specific heats of gases at constant volume formula_48and at constant pressure formula_49. In 1823 Poisson redid his teacher&#x27;s work and reached the same results without resorting to complex hypotheses previously employed by Laplace. In addition, by using the gas laws of Robert Boyle and Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac, Poisson obtained the equation for gases undergoing adiabatic changes, namely formula_50, where formula_51 is the pressure of the gas, formula_11 its volume, and formula_53.

=== Other works ===
Besides his many memoirs, Poisson published a number of treatises, most of which were intended to form part of a great work on mathematical physics, which he did not live to complete. Among these may be mentioned:
* &quot;Nouvelle théorie de l&#x27;action capillaire&quot; (4to, 1831);
* &quot;Recherches sur la probabilité des jugements en matières criminelles et matière civile&quot; (4to, 1837), all published at Paris.
* A catalog of all of Poisson&#x27;s papers and works can be found in &quot;Oeuvres complétes de François Arago, Vol. 2&quot;
*Mémoire sur l&#x27;équilibre et le mouvement des corps élastiques (v. 8 in &quot;Mémoires de l&#x27;Académie Royale des Sciences de l&#x27;Institut de France&quot;, 1829), digitized copy from the Bibliothèque nationale de France
*&quot;Recherches sur le Mouvement des Projectiles dans l&#x27;Air, en ayant égard a leur figure et leur rotation, et a l&#x27;influence du mouvement diurne de la terre&quot; (1839)
== Interaction with Évariste Galois ==

After political activist Évariste Galois had returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the École Normale, Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did January 1831. In early July, Poisson declared Galois&#x27; work &quot;incomprehensible,&quot; but encouraged Galois to &quot;publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.&quot; While Poisson&#x27;s report was made before Galois&#x27; 14 July arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois vehemently decided against publishing his papers through the academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Yet Galois did not ignore Poisson&#x27;s advice. He began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29 April 1832, after which he was somehow persuaded to participate in what proved to be a fatal duel.

<text>The Mothman Prophecies is a 1975 book by John Keel.

==Synopsis==
The book relates Keel&#x27;s accounts of his investigation into alleged sightings of a large, winged creature known as Mothman in the vicinity of Point Pleasant, West Virginia, during 1966 and 1967. It combines these accounts with his theories about UFOs and various supernatural phenomena, ultimately connecting them to the collapse of the Silver Bridge across the Ohio River on December 15, 1967. Official investigations in 1971 determined the bridge collapse was caused by stress corrosion cracking in an eyebar in a suspension chain.

==Reception== 
Kirkus Reviews wrote that the book featured Keel&#x27;s theories that &quot;ultraterrestrials&quot; use some form of psychic power to create hallucinations such as Mothman and UFOs.

In the May/June 2002 issue of &quot;Skeptical Inquirer&quot;, journalist John C. Sherwood, a former business associate of UFO researcher Gray Barker, published an analysis of private letters between Keel and Barker during the period of Keel&#x27;s investigation. In the article, &quot;Gray Barker&#x27;s Book of Bunk&quot;, Sherwood reported finding significant differences between what Keel wrote at the time of his investigation and what he wrote in his first book about the Mothman reports, raising questions about the book&#x27;s accuracy. Sherwood also reported that Keel, who was well known for writing humorous and outrageous letters to friends and associates, would not assist him in clarifying the differences.

==Film==

&quot;The Mothman Prophecies&quot; was the inspiration for the 2002 film of the same name, starring Richard Gere.

<text>The Limpopo River () rises in South Africa and flows generally eastward through Mozambique to the Indian Ocean. The term Limpopo is derived from Rivombo (Livombo/Lebombo), a group of Tsonga settlers led by Hosi Rivombo who settled in the mountainous vicinity and named the area after their leader. The river has been called the Vhembe by local Venda communities of the area where now that name has been adopted by the South African government as its District Municipality in the north, a name that was also suggested in 2002 as a possible title for the province but was voted against. The river is approximately long, with a drainage basin of in size. The mean discharge measured over a year is to at its mouth. The Limpopo is the second largest African river that drains to the Indian Ocean, after the Zambezi River.

The first European to sight the river was Vasco da Gama, who anchored off its mouth in 1498 and named it Espirito Santo River. Its lower course was explored by St Vincent Whitshed Erskine in 1868–69, and Captain J F Elton travelled down its middle course in 1870.

The drainage area of Limpopo River has decreased over geological time. Up to Late Pliocene or Pleistocene times, the upper course of the Zambezi River drained into the Limpopo River. The change of the drainage divide is the result of epeirogenic movement that uplifted the surface north of present-day Limpopo River, diverting waters into Zambezi River.

== Course ==
The river flows in a great arc, first zigzagging north and then north-east, then turning east and finally south-east. It serves as a border for about , separating South Africa to the southeast from Botswana to the northwest and Zimbabwe to the north. At the confluence of the Marico River and the Crocodile River, the name becomes the Limpopo River. There are several rapids as the river falls off Southern Africa&#x27;s inland escarpment.

The Notwane River is a major tributary of the Limpopo, rising on the edge of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana and flowing in a north-easterly direction. The main tributary of the Limpopo, the Olifants River (Elephant River), contributes around 1,233 million m3 of water per year. Other major tributaries include the Shashe River, Mzingwane River, Crocodile River, Mwenezi River and Luvuvhu River.

In the north-eastern corner of South Africa the river borders the Kruger National Park. The port town of Xai-Xai, Mozambique, is on the river near the mouth. Below the Olifants, the river is navigable to the sea, though a sandbar prevents access by large ships except at high tide.

== Tributaries ==
== Basin characteristics ==

The waters of the Limpopo flow sluggishly, with considerable silt content. Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s characterization of the river as the &quot;great grey-green, greasy Limpopo River, all set about with fever-trees&quot;, where the &quot;Bi-Coloured Python Rock-Snake&quot; dwells in the &quot;Just So Stories&quot; is apt. Rainfall is seasonal and unreliable: in dry years, the upper parts of the river flow for 40 days or less. The upper part of the drainage basin, in the Kalahari Desert, is arid but conditions become less arid further downriver. The next reaches drain the Waterberg Massif, a biome of semi-deciduous forest and low-density human population. The fertile lowlands support a denser population, and about 14 million people live in the Limpopo basin. Flooding during the rainy season is an occasional problem in the lower reaches. During February 2000 heavy rainfalls during the passage of a cyclone caused the catastrophic 2000 Mozambique flood.

The highest concentration of hippopotamus in the Limpopo River is found between the Mokolo and the Mogalakwena Rivers. There is a lot of mining activity in the Limpopo River basin with about 1,900 functioning mines, not counting about 1,700 abandoned mines.

== History ==
Vasco da Gama, on his first expedition, was probably among the first Europeans to sight the river, when he anchored off the mouth in 1498. However, there has been human habitation in the region since time immemorial—sites in the Makapans Valley near Mokopane contain Australopithecus fossils from 3.5 million years ago. St Vincent Whitshed Erskine, later surveyor general for South Africa, traveled to the mouth of the river in 1868–69.

A Zambezi shark was caught hundreds of kilometres upriver at the confluence of the Limpopo and Luvuvhu Rivers in July 1950. Zambezi sharks tolerate fresh water and can travel far up the Limpopo. In 2013, approximately 15,000 Nile crocodiles were accidentally released into the river from flood gates at the nearby Rakwena Crocodile Farm.

<text>Polokwane (, meaning &quot;Sanctuary&quot; in Northern Sotho), also known as Pietersburg, is the capital city of the Limpopo Province in South Africa. It is the country&#x27;s largest urban centre north of Gauteng. It was one of the nine host cities of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==History==

=== Early history ===

In the 1840s, Voortrekkers under the leadership of Andries Hendrik Potgieter established Zoutpansbergdorp, a town to the north. This settlement had to be abandoned because of clashes with the local tribes (Lebelo, Langa &amp; Ledwaba clans), they founded a new town in 1886 and named it &quot;Pietersburg&quot; in honour of Voortrekker leader Petrus Jacobus Joubert. A small number of Indian/Asian and coloured people settled into the region before the end of the 19th century. It was the capital of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State for a short time in 1900 at the time of the Second Boer War from 1899 to 1902. The British occupied Pietersburg in 1901 and built a concentration camp to incarcerate almost 4,000 Boer women and children. 
=== Years of apartheid ===
Like many places in South Africa at the time of apartheid, racial segregation and inequality were fundamentally ingrained into the town, following the end of the Second Boer War, together with the formation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, institutional laws were in place in terms of divided urban planning which were implemented continuously throughout this era. The commencement of apartheid in 1948 meant that Pietersburg was clearly segregated in both residential regions and for business ventures. 

The institutionalization of the notorious Group Areas Act in 1950 and its amendments in 1966 ensured that the spatial development of the Central Business District (CBD) was exclusively for whites and other regions of the CBD being exclusively for other races such as &quot;Indian centre&quot; for Indians/Asians, many regions were designated to only a specific race of people such as the suburbs of Nirvana and Westernburg at the northwest of the town only being occupied by Indian/Asian and Coloured groups respectively, while the suburb of Bendor being reserved for Whites. The townships of Seshego and Mankweng were occupied by the Black population. Removals of minority groups for white residency, whites-only owned industrial sectors and a regular barrier between people of different races were heavily enforced.

=== Since 1994 ===
The town officially became a city on 23 April 1992 and on 27 April 1994, it became the capital of the newly formed Northern Transvaal province (Later changed to &quot;Northern province&quot; and thereafter Limpopo) following the 1994 South African general elections. On 25 February 2005, the government declared the official name of the city as Polokwane, a name that was generally in use by the speakers of Northern Sotho (Sepedi). The city was host to the 52nd national conference of the African National Congress, held in December 2007 at the University of Limpopo and saw Jacob Zuma voted as President of the ANC, beating former president Thabo Mbeki. 

Today the city of Polokwane has seen respectable development in terms of its infrastructure and services as provides a wide variety of shopping venues and malls, restaurants, entertainment venues, religious venues, civic halls, as well as modern housing developments and office buildings.

== Political Governance ==
The Polokwane Municipality is run by the African National Congress (ANC) with a 60% majority obtained in the latest 2021 Municipal Elections. In a by-election held on 24 April 2024, Ward 10 was won by ANC councillor candidate Willie Madikoto after the arrest and resignation of the previous Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) councillor Jacob Seshokadue due to alleged theft of firearms.

== Ailing Infrastructure and Poor Service Delivery ==
Despite the number developments the city has seen, it has been plagued with persistent issues of poor service delivery, which has led to crucial infrastructure such as electricity, water, and sewage systems to continuously be sought after in the various communities that are constantly effected by their unavailability. Public infrastructure such as traffic and street lights, roads, and sidewalks are also amongst the many problems the city&#x27;s municipality faces.

==Demographics==
The population in 2011 was about 130,000 . Roughly 45.9% of people in the city are Sepedi (Northern Sotho) speakers. A large portion of the white population are Afrikaners, and roughly 10,000 residents (roughly 8%) are English-speaking whites who are primarily South Africans of British descent and White Zimbabweans, the latter of whom primarily moved to the area since 2000. Roughly 6.7% of people are Venda people.

===Districts/suburbs/townships===
Some suburbs in the city include Nirvana, Westenburg, Bendor, Welgelegen, Moregloed, Annadale, Ivydale, Flora Park, Fauna Park, Greenside, Penina Park, Ivy Park, Hospital Park, Ster Park, Dalmada, Broadlands, Woodlands, Southern Gateway and Thornhill.

Besides the above-mentioned suburbs in the city, three clusters of suburbs around the city also exist:

* The Seshego cluster - on the north-west outskirts of the city.
* Molepo/Maja/Chuene cluster - 20 km south of the city centre.
* Mankweng/Sebayeng/Dikgale cluster - 30 km east of the city centre.

==Climate==
The city features a semiarid climate under the Köppen climate classification. Despite its position on the Tropic of Capricorn, the climate is tempered by its position on a plateau 1230 m above sea level. Average temperatures reach around in January and fall to in July. As with much of inland South Africa, Polokwane has experienced notably warmer seasons over the last decade than its long-term average.
The city has a dry climate with a summer rainy season and a pronounced dry spell during winter. Average annual rainfall is , with December or (less often) January the wettest month and July the driest.
==Transport==
===Roads===

The city lies roughly halfway between Gauteng () and the Zimbabwean border () on the N1 highway, which connects Zimbabwe with the major cities of South Africa, such as Pretoria, Johannesburg, Bloemfontein, and Cape Town.

The R37 provincial route connects the city with Mbombela. Running east, the R71 connects the city with Tzaneen, Phalaborwa, Bushbuckridge, and the Kruger National Park. To north-east, is the R81 connecting the city with Giyani and Malamulele. The R521 connects the city with Alldays and the R567 via Seshego connects Polokwane with the N11. The R71 is also well known to bikers who ride through the city annually, making it the biggest bike meeting in Africa.

The Nelson Mandela road traffic island is situated on the outskirts of Polokwane when approaching from the direction of Johannesburg. It was built prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup as part of beautifying the city for the event.

A number of private bus services run in the city and also services connect Polokwane to other major centres in the country.

===Air===
The city is served by two airports. A public airport, the Polokwane International Airport, which is to the north of the city, while the smaller Pietersburg Civil Aerodrome is at the south-east of the city. 
 
 
 

===Railways ===
The city is connected to Johannesburg and other major centres by rail. Agricultural produce in the area, including tomatoes, citrus fruit, sugar cane, peanuts, tea, bananas, and avocados, is also transported by freight rail.

==Society and culture==
===Media===

The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) has a branch in the city. The city also hosts a branch of the country&#x27;s largest independent radio station, Jacaranda RM/FM, which is broadcast from either Pretoria, Nelspruit or Polokwane itself.

The first commercial radio station in Limpopo, CapricornFM, broadcasts from the city. Two additional radio stations are also situated in Polokwane. These include &quot;Energy FM&quot; and Munghana Lonene FM.

The Star of David is the symbol of the ZCC and the two congregations that make up the church are today led by the grandsons of its founder - Barnabas Lekganyane and Saint Engenas Lekganyane. The ZCC is characterised by the emphasis it places on faith healing, purification rites, dancing, night communion, river baptism, the holy spirit, taboos and prophesying. The church celebrated its 100th years of existence during their September pilgrimage in 2024 which was attended by provincial government leadership, Kings, Chiefs, congregates and other dignitaries.

The first Jewish settlers in Pietersburg arrived between 1890 and 1900 from Lithuania, Russia, and Latvia, and the Pietersburg Hebrew Congregation was founded in 1897. A synagogue was built on Jorissen Street in 1921. The Jewish community grew rapidly in the 1930s and 1940s; a larger synagogue was built in 1953 and the old synagogue was then converted into a communal hall. The number of Jews in Pietersburg began to decline from the late 1950s.

==Coats of arms==

===Municipal (1)===
By 1931, the Pietersburg municipal council had assumed a pseudo-heraldic &quot;coat of arms&quot;. The shield depicted a crossed pick and shovel, two crossed wheatsheaves, and the date 1904 surrounded by a ribbon and bearing the motto . The crest was an ostrich.

=== Municipal (2) ===
A proper coat of arms was designed in the 1960s. It was registered with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in August 1967 and at the Bureau of Heraldry in September 1969.

The arms were : &quot;Azure, on a fess Argent, between in chief a lion passant Argent, armed and langued Gules, and in base two chevrons humette, and a horseshoe Argent, placed 2 and 1, two cogwheels Gules&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms, this was a blue shield displaying, from top to bottom, a silver lion with red tongue and claws, a silver stripe bearing two red cogwheels, and two silver chevrons and a horseshoe.

The crest was a golden eagle, and the motto, once again, was &quot;Labor omnia vincit&quot;.
===Municipal (3)===
The Pietersburg municipal council registered a new coat of arms at the Bureau in October 2003.

The arms are: &quot;Vert, on a fess Argent, a woven grain basket, between two hoes with blades turned inward proper, their handles towards centre-base counterchanged Or and issuant from a voided cogwheel the inner ring cotised Argent, therein a sun Or; on a chief of the last a short-clawed Lark (&quot;Mirafra chuana&quot;) perched upon a leaf of the silky thorn tree (&quot;Acacia rehmanniana&quot;) proper, between two demi-peaks with points embattled Brunatre, issuant from the respective shield flanks&quot;. In layman&#x27;s terms, the shield depicts, from top to bottom, (1) a short-clawed lark perched on an acacia leaf between two stylised peaks, (2) a woven grain basket between two hoes on a silver background, and (3) a silver cogwheel on a green background.

Above the shield is a brown rustic crown. The motto is &quot;Unity - Equity - Progress - Prosperity&quot;.

<text>Bourbon whiskey (; also simply bourbon) is a barrel-aged American whiskey made primarily from corn (maize). The name derives from the French House of Bourbon, although the precise source of inspiration is uncertain; contenders include Bourbon County, Kentucky, and Bourbon Street in New Orleans, both of which are named after the House of Bourbon. The name &quot;bourbon&quot; might not have been used until the 1850s, and the association with Bourbon County was not evident until the 1870s.

Although bourbon may be made anywhere in the U.S, it is strongly associated with the Southern United States, particularly Kentucky. One reason for this strong association is the romanticized advertising in the 1990s of bourbon as a product of Kentucky with rural, Southern origins. There is a common misconception that bourbon can only be distilled in Kentucky. Even though bourbon was strongly associated with the South, it was also a symbol of urbanization and sophistication due to a large percentage of consumers belonging to the middle- to upper-class, including business and community leaders. Bourbon was recognized in 1964 by the U.S. Congress as a &quot;distinctive product of the United States.&quot; Bourbon sold in the U.S. must be produced within the U.S. from at least 51% corn and stored in a new container of charred oak. This distinctive American liquor was heavily consumed by Americans in the 1990s. In 1964, Americans consumed around 77 million gallons of bourbon.

Bourbon has been distilled since the 18th century. , distillers&#x27; wholesale market revenue for bourbon sold within the U.S. was about $2.7 billion, and bourbon made up about two thirds of the $1.6 billion of U.S. exports of distilled spirits. According to the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, in 2018 U.S. distillers derived $3.6 billion in revenue from bourbon and Tennessee whiskey (a closely related spirit produced in the state of Tennessee).

==History==

Distilling was most likely brought to present-day Kentucky in the late 18th century by Scots, Scots-Irish, and other settlers (including English, Irish, Welsh, German, and French) who began to farm the area in earnest. The origin of bourbon as a distinct form of whiskey is not well documented and there are many conflicting legends and claims.

For example, the invention of bourbon is often attributed to Elijah Craig, a Baptist minister and distiller credited with many Kentucky firsts (e.g., fulling mill, paper mill, ropewalk) who is said to have been the first to age the product in charred oak casks, a process that gives bourbon its brownish color and distinctive taste. In Bourbon County, across the county line from Craig&#x27;s distillery in what was then Fayette County, an early distiller named Jacob Spears has been named as the first to label his product as Bourbon whiskey. Although still popular and often repeated, the Craig legend is apocryphal. Similarly, the Spears story is a local favorite but is rarely repeated outside the county. There likely was no single &quot;inventor&quot; of bourbon, which developed into its present form in the late 19th century. Essentially, any type of grain can be used to make whiskey, and the practice of aging whiskey and charring the barrels for better flavor had been known in Europe for centuries. The late date of the Bourbon County etymology has led historian Michael Veach to dispute its authenticity. He proposes the whiskey was named after Bourbon Street in New Orleans, a major port where shipments of Kentucky whiskey sold well as a cheaper alternative to French cognac.

Another proposed origin of the name is the association with the geographic area known as &quot;Old Bourbon&quot;, consisting of the original Bourbon County in Virginia organized in 1785. This region included much of today&#x27;s Eastern Kentucky, including 34 of the modern counties. It included the current Bourbon County in Kentucky, which became a county when Kentucky separated from Virginia as a new state in 1792. Numerous newspaper articles reference whiskey from Bourbon County, Kentucky dating as far back as 1824. According to the whiskey writer Charles K. Cowdery,

A refinement often dubiously credited to James C. Crow is the sour mash process, which conditions each new fermentation with some amount of spent mash. Spent mash is also known as spent beer, distillers&#x27; spent grain, stillage, and slop or feed mash, so named because it is used as animal feed. The acid introduced when using the sour mash controls the growth of bacteria that could taint the whiskey and creates a proper pH balance for the yeast to work.

Although many distilleries operated in Bourbon County historically, no distilleries operated there between 1919, when Prohibition began in Kentucky, and late 2014, when a small distillery opened – a period of 95 years. Prohibition devastated the bourbon industry. With the ratification of the 18th amendment in 1919, all distilleries were forced to stop operating. Six companies were granted permits to bottle medicinal whiskey from existing stocks: A. Ph. Stitzel Distillery (later called the Stitzel–Weller Distillery), American Medicinal Spirits (producer of Old Crow and Old Grand-Dad, sold in 1929 to National Distillers, now owned by Suntory Global Spirits), Brown-Forman (still a current major producer), Frankfort Distillery (including the George T. Stagg distillery now called the Buffalo Trace Distillery and owned by Sazerac), James Thompson and Brothers (later called Glenmore Distillery, now owned by Sazerac), and Schenley Distillery (now owned by Guinness). Prescriptions were required to buy medicinal whiskey. In 1928 or 1929 when stocks ran out, there was a 100-day &quot;distillers&#x27; holiday&quot; to replenish the medicinal stock.

After the end of Prohibition at the federal level in late 1933, it continued in various places at the state, county and local level, and liquor sales are still prohibited or restricted in many jurisdictions in Kentucky, the primary bourbon-producing state (and in Tennessee as well, where Tennessee whiskey is made).

Production was shut down completely again in 1941 to reserve production capacity for making industrial alcohol during World War II.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the United States Congress in 1964 declared bourbon to be a &quot;distinctive product of the United States&quot; and asked &quot;the appropriate agencies of the United States Government ... [to] take appropriate action to prohibit importation into the United States of whiskey designated as &#x27;Bourbon Whiskey&#x27;.&quot; A U.S. federal regulation now restricts the definition of &quot;bourbon&quot; for whiskey to only include spirits produced in the U.S.

In recent years, bourbon and Tennessee whiskey, which is sometimes regarded as a different type of spirit but generally meets the legal requirements to be called bourbon, have enjoyed significant growth in popularity. The industry trade group Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS) tracks sales of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey together.

According to DISCUS, during 2009–2014, the volume of 9-liter cases of whiskey increased by 28.5% overall. Higher-end bourbon and whiskeys experienced the greatest growth. Gross supplier revenues (including federal excise tax) for U.S. bourbon and Tennessee whiskey increased by 46.7% over the 2009–2014 period, with the greatest growth coming from high-end products. In 2014, more than 19 million nine-liter cases of bourbon and Tennessee whiskey were sold in the U.S., generating almost $2.7 billion in wholesale distillery revenue. U.S. exports of bourbon whiskey surpassed $1 billion for the first time in 2013; distillers hailed the rise of a &quot;golden age of Kentucky bourbon&quot; and predicted further growth. In 2014, it was estimated that U.S. bourbon whiskey exports surpassed $1 billion, making up the majority of the U.S. total of $1.6 billion in spirits exports. Major export markets for U.S. spirits are, in descending order: Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and France. The largest percentage increases in U.S. exports were, in descending order: Brazil, the Dominican Republic, Bahamas, Israel, and United Arab Emirates. Key elements of growth in the markets showing the largest increases have been changes of law, trade agreements, and reductions of tariffs, as well as increased consumer demand for premium-category spirits.

==Legal requirements==

Bourbon&#x27;s legal definition varies somewhat from country to country, but many trade agreements require that the name &quot;bourbon&quot; be reserved for products made in the U.S. The U.S. regulations for labeling and advertising bourbon apply only to products made for consumption within the U.S.; they do not apply to distilled spirits made for export. Canadian law requires products labeled bourbon to be made in the U.S. and also to conform to the requirements that apply within the U.S. The European Union also requires bourbon to be made in the U.S. following the law of the country. However, in other countries, products labeled bourbon may not adhere to the same standards. For example, U.S.-produced products with somewhat lower alcohol content than the level required in the United States can be sold in Australia as bourbon, with Cougar Bourbon being an example of an export-only brand produced in the U.S. for the Australia market.

The Federal Standards of Identity for Distilled Spirits, codified under 27 CFR §5 Subpart I states that bourbon made for U.S. consumption must be:

* Produced in the U.S. (which includes the 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico)
* Made from a grain mixture that is at least 51% corn
* Aged in new, charred oak containers
* Distilled to no more than 160 (U.S.) proof (80% alcohol by volume)
* Entered into the container for aging at no more than 125 proof (62.5% alcohol by volume)
* Bottled (like other whiskeys) at 80 proof or more (40% alcohol by volume)

Bourbon has no minimum specified duration for its aging period. Products aged for as little as three months are sold as bourbon. The exception is straight bourbon, which has a minimum aging requirement of two years. In addition, any bourbon aged less than four years must include an age statement on its label.

Bourbon that meets the above requirements, has been aged for a minimum of two years, and does not have added coloring, flavoring, or other spirits may be – but is not required to be – called straight bourbon.
* Bourbon that has been aged less than four years must be labeled with the duration of its aging.
* Bourbon that has an age stated on its label must be labeled with the age of the youngest whiskey in the bottle (not counting the age of any added neutral grain spirits in a bourbon that is labeled as blended, as neutral-grain spirits are not considered whiskey under the regulations and are not required to be aged at all).

Bottled in bond bourbon is a sub-category of straight bourbon that must be produced by a single distiller at a single distillery in a single season, aged at least four years in a bonded warehouse under federal control, and bottled at 100 proof (50% ABV).

Bourbon that is labeled &quot;blended&quot; (or as a &quot;blend&quot;) may contain added coloring, flavoring, and other spirits, such as un-aged neutral grain spirits, but at least 51% of the product must be straight bourbon.

&quot;High rye bourbon&quot; is not a legally defined term but usually means a bourbon with 20–35% rye in its mash bill. High-wheat or &quot;wheated&quot; bourbons are described as more mild and subdued compared to high-rye varieties.

Bourbon that has been aged for less than three years cannot legally be referred to as whiskey (or whisky) in the European Union.

===Geographic origin===
On May 4, 1964, the U.S. Congress declared bourbon whiskey as a &quot;distinctive product of the United States&quot; by concurrent resolution. Bourbon may be produced anywhere in the U.S. where it is legal to distill spirits, but most brands are produced in Kentucky, where bourbon production has a strong historical association. The filtering of iron-free water through the high concentrations of limestone that are unique to the area is often touted by bourbon distillers in Kentucky as a signature step in the bourbon-making process.

On August 2, 2007, the U.S. Senate passed a resolution sponsored by Senator Jim Bunning (R-KY) officially declaring September 2007 to be National Bourbon Heritage Month, commemorating the history of bourbon whiskey. Notably, the resolution claimed that Congress had declared bourbon to be &quot;America&#x27;s Native Spirit&quot; in its 1964 resolution. However, the 1964 resolution did not contain such a statement; it declared bourbon to be a distinctive product identifiable with the U.S. (in a similar way that Scotch is considered identifiable with Scotland). The resolution was passed again in 2008.

, 95% of all bourbon is produced in Kentucky, according to the Kentucky Distillers&#x27; Association. , there were 68 whiskey distilleries in Kentucky, this was up 250 percent in the past ten years. At that time, the state had more than 8.1 million barrels of bourbon that were aging – a number that greatly exceeds the state&#x27;s population of about 4.3 million.

Bardstown, Kentucky, is home to the annual Bourbon Festival held each September. It has been called the &quot;Bourbon Capital of the World&quot; by the Bardstown Tourism Commission and the Kentucky Bourbon Festival organizers who have registered the phrase as a trademark. The Kentucky Bourbon Trail is the name of a tourism promotion program organized by the Kentucky Distillers&#x27; Association that is aimed at attracting visitors to the distilleries in Kentucky, particularly Four Roses (Lawrenceburg), Heaven Hill (Bardstown), Jim Beam (Clermont), Maker&#x27;s Mark (Loretto), Town Branch (Lexington), Wild Turkey (Lawrenceburg), and Woodford Reserve (Versailles).

Tennessee is home to other major bourbon makers, although most prefer to call their product &quot;Tennessee whiskey&quot; instead, including giant Jack Daniel&#x27;s. It is legally defined under Tennessee House Bill 1084, the North American Free Trade Agreement and at least one other international trade agreement as the recognized name for a straight bourbon whiskey produced in Tennessee. It is also required to meet the legal definition of bourbon under Canadian law.

Although some Tennessee whiskey makers maintain that a pre-aging filtration through chunks of maple charcoal, known as the Lincoln County Process and legally mandated since 2013, make its flavor distinct from bourbon, U.S. regulations defining bourbon neither require nor prohibit its use.

Bourbon also was and is made in other U.S. states. The largest bourbon distiller outside of Kentucky and Tennessee is MGP of Indiana, which primarily wholesales its spirits products to bottling companies that sell them under about 50 different brand names – in some cases, misleadingly marketed as &quot;craft&quot; whiskey, despite being produced at a large wholesaler&#x27;s factory.

==Production process==

To be legally sold as bourbon, the whiskey&#x27;s mash bill requires a minimum of 51% corn, with the remainder being any cereal grain. A proposed change to U.S. regulations will expand allowable &quot;grains&quot; to include seeds of the pseudocereals amaranth, buckwheat, and quinoa. A mash bill that contains wheat instead of rye produces what is known as a wheated bourbon. The grain is ground and mixed with water. Usually mash from a previous distillation is added to ensure consistency across batches, creating a sour mash. Finally, yeast is added, and the mash is fermented. It is distilled to (typically) between 65% and 80% alcohol using either a traditional alembic (or pot still) or the much less expensive continuous still. Most modern bourbons are initially run off using a column still and then redistilled in a &quot;doubler&quot; (alternatively known as a &quot;thumper&quot; or &quot;retort&quot;) that is basically a pot still.

The resulting clear spirit, called &quot;white dog&quot;, is placed in charred new oak containers for aging. In practice, these containers are generally barrels made from American white oak. The spirit gains its color and much of its flavor from the caramelized sugars and vanillins in the charred wood. Straight bourbon must be aged at least two years, and blended bourbon must contain at least 51% straight bourbon on a proof gallon basis (i.e., most of the alcohol in the blend must be from straight bourbon). The remainder of the spirits in a blended bourbon may be neutral grain spirits that are not aged at all. If a product is labeled merely as bourbon whiskey rather than straight or blended, no specific minimum aging period is prescribed – only that the product has been &quot;stored at not more than 62.5% alcohol by volume (125 proof) in charred new oak containers&quot;. Bourbons gain more color and flavor the longer they age in wood. Changes to the spirit also occur due to evaporation and chemical processes such as oxidation. Lower-priced bourbons tend to be aged relatively briefly. Even for higher-priced bourbons, &quot;maturity&quot; rather than a particular age duration is often the goal, as over-aging bourbons can negatively affect the flavor of the bourbon (making it taste woody, bitter, or unbalanced).

After maturing, bourbon is withdrawn from the barrel and is typically filtered and diluted with water. It is then bottled at no less than 80 US proof (40% abv). Although most bourbon whiskey is sold at 80 proof, bourbon can be bottled much higher.

All &quot;bottled in bond&quot; bourbon is 100 proof. Some higher-proof bottlings are marketed as &quot;barrel proof&quot; or &quot;cask strength&quot;, meaning they have not been diluted or have been only slightly diluted (less than 1% ABV dilution) after removal from the barrels. Bourbon whiskey may be sold at less than 80 proof but must be labeled as &quot;diluted bourbon&quot;. A very small number of bourbon bottlings have been released with exceptionally high proof, sometimes exceeding 140 proof (70% ABV). In the mid-2010s, some sources began referring to these as &quot;hazmat&quot; bourbons, alluding to the ban in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations on air travel passengers and crew members carrying such high-proof beverages due to their highly flammable nature. Such high proof levels are very uncommon even among &quot;barrel proof&quot; bourbons, as bourbon must enter the barrel at no higher than 125 proof and thus can only reach higher concentrations by disproportionate evaporation of water in the Angel&#x27;s share during aging. Although only the focus of special attention for bourbon since the mid-2010s, very-high-proof products are not especially novel in general, as evidenced by the well-known Bacardi 151 brand of rum, which was available on the U.S. and Canadian markets from about 1963 until 2016 and was bottled at 75.5% ABV.

After processing, barrels remain saturated with up to of bourbon, although is the norm. They may not be reused for bourbon, and most are sold to distilleries in Canada, Scotland, Ireland, Mexico, and the Caribbean for aging other spirits. Some are employed in the manufacture of various barrel-aged products, including amateur and professionally brewed bourbon barrel-aged beer, barbecue sauce, wine, hot sauce, and others. Since 2011, Jim Beam has employed barrel rinsing on a large scale to extract bourbon from its used barrels, mixing the extract with a 6-year-old Beam bourbon to create a 90-proof product that it sells as &quot;Devil&#x27;s Cut&quot;.

The bottling operation for bourbon is the process of filtering, mixing together straight whiskey from different barrels (sometimes from different distilleries), diluting with water, blending with other ingredients (if producing blended bourbon), and filling containers to produce the final product that is marketed to consumers. By itself, the phrase &quot;bottled by&quot; means only that. Only if the bottler operates the distillery that produced the whiskey may &quot;distilled by&quot; be added to the label.

Labeling requirements for bourbon and other alcoholic beverages (including the requirements for what is allowed to be called bourbon under U.S. law) are defined in the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations. No whiskey made outside the U.S. may be labeled bourbon or sold as bourbon inside the U.S. Various other countries have trade agreements with the U.S. to recognize bourbon as a distinctive product of the U.S., including Canada and Mexico, the United Kingdom, Chile, and Brazil.

A 2016 experiment by Louisville craft distiller Jefferson&#x27;s Bourbon suggests that in the era before whiskey was routinely bottled at the distillery, Kentucky bourbon developed a superior taste because it was shipped in barrels, using water transport wherever practical. To test this theory, Jefferson&#x27;s cofounder Trey Zoeller sent two barrels of the company&#x27;s signature product to New York City via barge, first down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and then along the Intracoastal Waterway. As a control, he brought a batch of the same whiskey that had remained in Louisville during the same period. According to &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; writer Jacqueline Detwiler-George, who documented the test, the sample that made the waterborne journey &quot;was mature beyond its age, richer, with new flavors of tobacco, vanilla, caramel, and honey. It was some of the best bourbon any of us had ever drunk.&quot; It was theorized that the action of gentle sloshing of the whiskey in barrels for a period of 2 to 4 weeks during the barge trip led to a dramatic improvement in smoothness and taste. Chemical analysis of the two samples revealed significant differences in molecular profiles, with the sample transported by water having a greater diversity of aromatic compounds.

==Uses==

Bourbon is served in a variety of manners, including neat; diluted with water; over ice (&quot;on the rocks&quot;); with cola or other beverages in simple mixed drinks; and in cocktails – including the Manhattan, the Old Fashioned, the whiskey sour, and the mint julep. Bourbon is also used in cooking, and it was historically used for medicinal purposes.

Bourbon can be used in a variety of confections such as a banana bourbon syrup for waffles, a flavoring for chocolate cake, and fruit-based desserts like grilled peach sundaes served with salted bourbon-caramel or brown sugar shortcake with warmed bourbon peaches. It is an optional ingredient in several pie recipes traditional to American cuisine, including pumpkin pie, where it can be combined with brown sugar and pecans to make a sweet and crunchy topping for the creamy pumpkin pie filling. It can also be used as a flavoring in sauces for savory dishes like grit cakes with country ham served with bourbon mayonnaise, Kentucky bourbon chili, and grilled flank steak.

<text>The CMYK color model (also known as process color, or four color) is a subtractive color model, based on the CMY color model, used in color printing, and is also used to describe the printing process itself. The abbreviation &quot;CMYK&quot; refers to the four ink plates used: [[CMYK color model|c]]yan, [[CMYK color model|m]]agenta, [[CMYK color model|y]]ellow, and [[CMYK color model|k]]ey (most often black).

The CMYK model works by partially or entirely masking colors on a lighter, usually white, background. The ink reduces the light that would otherwise be reflected. Such a model is called &quot;subtractive&quot; because inks &quot;subtract&quot; some colors from white light; in the CMY model, white light minus red leaves cyan, white light minus green leaves magenta, and white light minus blue leaves yellow.

In additive color models, such as RGB, white is the &quot;additive&quot; combination of all primary colored lights, and black is the absence of light. In the CMYK model, it is the opposite: white is the natural color of the paper or other background, and black results from a full combination of colored inks. To save cost on ink, and to produce deeper black tones, unsaturated and dark colors are produced by using black ink instead of or in addition to combinations of cyan, magenta, and yellow.

The CMYK printing process was invented in the 1890s, when newspapers began to publish color comic strips.

== Halftoning ==
With CMYK printing, &quot;halftoning&quot; (also called &quot;screening&quot;) allows for less than full saturation of the primary colors; tiny dots of each primary color are printed in a pattern small enough that humans perceive a solid color. Magenta printed with a 20% halftone, for example, produces a pink color, because the eye perceives the tiny magenta dots on the large white paper as lighter and less saturated than the color of pure magenta ink. Halftoning allows for a continuous variability of each color, which enables continuous color mixing of the primaries. Without halftoning, each primary would be binary, i.e. on/off, which only allows for the reproduction of eight colors: white, the three primaries (cyan, magenta, yellow), the three secondaries (red, green, blue), and black.


== Comparison to CMY ==

The CMYK color model is based on the CMY color model, which omits the black ink. Four-color printing uses black ink in addition to subtractive primaries for several reasons:
* In traditional preparation of color separations, a red keyline on the black line art marked the outline of solid or tint color areas. In some cases a black keyline was used when it served as both a color indicator and an outline to be printed in black because usually the black plate contained the keyline. The &quot;K&quot; in &quot;CMYK&quot; represents the keyline, or black, plate, also sometimes called the &quot;key plate&quot;.
* Text is typically printed in black and includes fine detail (such as serifs). To avoid even slight blurring when reproducing text (or other finely detailed outlines) using three inks would require impractically accurate registration.
* A combination of 100% cyan, magenta, and yellow inks soaks the paper with ink, making it slower to dry, causing bleeding, or (especially on low-quality paper such as newsprint) weakening the paper so much that it tears.
* Although a combination of 100% cyan, magenta, and yellow inks would, in theory, completely absorb the entire visible spectrum of light and produce a perfect black, practical inks fall short of their ideal characteristics, and the result is a dark, muddy color that is not quite black. Black ink absorbs more light and yields much better blacks. 
* Black ink is less expensive than the combination of colored inks that makes black.

A black made with just CMY inks is sometimes called a &quot;composite black&quot;.

When a very dark area is wanted, a colored or gray CMY &quot;bedding&quot; is applied first, then a full black layer is applied on top, making a rich, deep black; this is called &quot;rich black&quot;.

The amount of black to use to replace amounts of the other inks is variable, and the choice depends on the technology, paper and ink in use. Processes called &quot;under color removal&quot;, &quot;under color addition&quot;, and &quot;gray component replacement&quot; are used to decide on the final mix; different CMYK recipes will be used depending on the printing task.

== Other printer color models ==
CMYK, as well as all other process color printing, is contrasted with spot color printing, in which specific colored inks are used to generate the colors seen. Some printing presses are capable of printing with both four-color process inks and additional spot color inks at the same time. High-quality printed materials, such as marketing brochures and books, often include photographs requiring process-color printing, other graphic effects requiring spot colors (such as metallic inks), and finishes such as varnish, which enhances the glossy appearance of the printed piece.

CMYK are the process printers which often have a relatively small color gamut. Processes such as Pantone&#x27;s proprietary six-color (CMYKOG) Hexachrome considerably expand the gamut. Light, saturated colors often cannot be created with CMYK, and light colors in general may make visible the halftone pattern. Using a CcMmYK process, with the addition of light cyan and magenta inks to CMYK, can solve these problems, and such a process is used by many inkjet printers, including desktop models.

== Comparison with RGB displays ==

Comparisons between RGB displays and CMYK prints can be difficult, since the color reproduction technologies and properties are very different. A computer monitor mixes shades of red, green, and blue light to create color images. A CMYK printer instead uses light-absorbing cyan, magenta, and yellow inks, whose colors are mixed using dithering, halftoning, or some other optical technique.

Similar to electronic displays, the inks used in printing produce color gamuts that are only a subsets of the visible spectrum, and the two color modes have their own specific ranges, each being capable of producing colors the other is not. As a result of this, an image rendered on an electronic display and rendered in print can vary in appearance. When designing images to be printed, designers work in RGB color spaces (electronic displays) capable of rendering colors a CMYK process cannot, and it is often difficult to accurately visualize a printed result that must fit into a different color space that both lacks some colors an electronic display can produce and includes colors it cannot.

=== Spectrum of printed paper ===
To reproduce color, the CMYK color model codes for absorbing light rather than emitting it (as is assumed by RGB). The &quot;K&quot; component ideally absorbs all wavelengths and is therefore achromatic. The cyan, magenta, and yellow components are used for color reproduction and they may be viewed as the inverse of RGB: Cyan absorbs red, magenta absorbs green, and yellow absorbs blue (−R,−G,−B).

== Conversion ==
Since RGB and CMYK spaces are both device-dependent spaces, there is no simple or general conversion formula that converts between them. Conversions are generally done through color management systems, using color profiles that describe the spaces being converted. An ICC profile defines the bidirectional conversion between a neutral &quot;profile connection&quot; color space (CIE XYZ or Lab) and a selected colorspace, in this case both RGB and CMYK. The precision of the conversion depends on the profile itself, the exact methodology, and because the gamuts do not generally match, the rendering intent and constraints such as ink limit.

ICC profiles, internally built out of lookup tables and other transformation functions, are capable of handling many effects of ink blending. One example is the dot gain, which show up as non-linear components in the color-to-density mapping. More complex interactions such as Neugebauer blending can be modelled in higher-dimension lookup tables.

The problem of computing a colorimetric estimate of the color that results from printing various combinations of ink has been addressed by many scientists. A general method that has emerged for the case of halftone printing is to treat each tiny overlap of color dots as one of 8 (combinations of CMY) or of 16 (combinations of CMYK) colors, which in this context are known as Neugebauer primaries. The resultant color would be an area-weighted colorimetric combination of these primary colors, except that the Yule–Nielsen effect of scattered light between and within the areas complicates the physics and the analysis; empirical formulas for such analysis have been developed, in terms of detailed dye combination absorption spectra and empirical parameters.

Standardization of printing practices allow for some profiles to be predefined. One of them is the US Specifications for Web Offset Publications, which has its ICC color profile built into some software including Microsoft Office (as Agfa RSWOP.icm).

<text>The protected areas of South Africa include national parks and marine protected areas managed by the national government, public nature reserves managed by provincial and local governments, and private nature reserves managed by private landowners. Most protected areas are intended for the conservation of flora and fauna. National parks are maintained by South African National Parks (&quot;SANParks&quot;). A number of national parks have been incorporated in transfrontier conservation areas.

Protected areas may also be protected for their value and importance as historical, cultural heritage or scientific sites. More information on these can be found in the list of heritage sites in South Africa.

<text>The national parks of France are a system of eleven national parks throughout metropolitan France and its overseas departments, coordinated by National Parks of France (French: &quot;Parcs nationaux de France&quot;) within the French Office for Biodiversity (&quot;Office français pour la biodiversité&quot;), an établissement public à caractère administratif guided by the Ministry of Ecological Transition and Ministry of Agriculture and Food.

The first national park was established in 1963; the most recent park was established in 2019. National parks are created by decree with the signature of the Prime Minister of France and publication in the &quot;Journal Officiel de la République Française&quot;.

French national parks protect a total area of in core area and in buffer zones. This puts over 9.5% of French territory under the protection of national parks; 29.5% of French lands and 22% of French waters are covered by some level of protection. French national parks draw over 8.5 million visitors annually.

<doc id="44688" wikidata="Q1139334" url="?curid=44688" title="Almost everywhere">
<text>In measure theory (a branch of mathematical analysis), a property holds almost everywhere if, in a technical sense, the set for which the property holds takes up nearly all possibilities. The notion of &quot;almost everywhere&quot; is a companion notion to the concept of measure zero, and is analogous to the notion of &quot;almost surely&quot; in probability theory.

More specifically, a property holds almost everywhere if it holds for all elements in a set except a subset of measure zero, or equivalently, if the set of elements for which the property holds is conull. In cases where the measure is not complete, it is sufficient that the set be contained within a set of measure zero. When discussing sets of real numbers, the Lebesgue measure is usually assumed unless otherwise stated.

The term &quot;almost everywhere&quot; is abbreviated &quot;a.e.&quot;; in older literature &quot;p.p.&quot; is used, to stand for the equivalent French language phrase &quot;presque partout&quot;.

A set with full measure is one whose complement is of measure zero. In probability theory, the terms &quot;almost surely&quot;, &quot;almost certain&quot; and &quot;almost always&quot; refer to events with probability 1 not necessarily including all of the outcomes. These are exactly the sets of full measure in a probability space.

Occasionally, instead of saying that a property holds almost everywhere, it is said that the property holds for almost all elements (though the term almost all can also have other meanings).

== Definition ==

If formula_1 is a measure space, a property formula_2 is said to hold almost everywhere in formula_3 if there exists a measurable set formula_4 with formula_5, and all formula_6 have the property formula_2. 
Another common way of expressing the same thing is to say that &quot;almost every point satisfies formula_8&quot;, or that &quot;for almost every formula_9, formula_10 holds&quot;.

It is &quot;not&quot; required that the set formula_11 has measure zero; it may not be measurable. 
By the above definition, it is sufficient that formula_11 be contained in some set formula_13 that is measurable and has measure zero. 
However, this technicality vanishes when considering a complete measure space: if formula_14 is complete then formula_15 exists with measure zero if and only if formula_16 is measurable with measure zero.

== Properties ==

* If property formula_2 holds almost everywhere and implies property &quot;formula_18&quot;, then property &quot;formula_18&quot; holds almost everywhere. This follows from the monotonicity of measures.
* If formula_20 is a finite or a countable sequence of properties, each of which holds almost everywhere, then their conjunction formula_21 holds almost everywhere. This follows from the countable sub-additivity of measures.
* By contrast, if formula_22 is an uncountable family of properties, each of which holds almost everywhere, then their conjunction formula_23 does not necessarily hold almost everywhere. For example, if formula_24 is Lebesgue measure on formula_25 and formula_26 is the property of not being equal to formula_27 (i.e. formula_28 is true if and only if formula_29), then each formula_26 holds almost everywhere, but the conjunction formula_23 does not hold anywhere.

As a consequence of the first two properties, it is often possible to reason about &quot;almost every point&quot; of a measure space as though it were an ordinary point rather than an abstraction. This is often done implicitly in informal mathematical arguments. However, one must be careful with this mode of reasoning because of the third bullet above: universal quantification over uncountable families of statements is valid for ordinary points but not for &quot;almost every point&quot;.

== Examples ==
* If &quot;f&quot; : R → R is a Lebesgue integrable function and formula_32 almost everywhere, then formula_33 for all real numbers formula_34 with equality if and only if formula_35 almost everywhere.
* If &quot;f&quot; : [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] → R is a monotonic function, then &quot;f&quot; is differentiable almost everywhere.
* If &quot;f&quot; : R → R is Lebesgue measurable and formula_36 for all real numbers formula_34, then there exists a set &quot;E&quot; (depending on &quot;f&quot;) such that, if &quot;x&quot; is in &quot;E&quot;, the Lebesgue mean formula_38 converges to as formula_39 decreases to zero. The set &quot;E&quot; is called the Lebesgue set of &quot;f&quot;. Its complement can be proved to have measure zero. In other words, the Lebesgue mean of &quot;f&quot; converges to &quot;f&quot; almost everywhere.
* A bounded function is Riemann integrable if and only if it is continuous almost everywhere.
* As a curiosity, the decimal expansion of almost every real number in the interval [0, 1] contains the complete text of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, encoded in ASCII; similarly for every other finite digit sequence, see Normal number.

== Definition using ultrafilters ==

Outside of the context of real analysis, the notion of a property true almost everywhere is sometimes defined in terms of an ultrafilter. An ultrafilter on a set &quot;X&quot; is a maximal collection &quot;F&quot; of subsets of &quot;X&quot; such that:
# If &quot;U&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot; and &quot;U&quot; ⊆ &quot;V&quot; then &quot;V&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;
# The intersection of any two sets in &quot;F&quot; is in &quot;F&quot;
# The empty set is not in &quot;F&quot;
A property &quot;P&quot; of points in &quot;X&quot; holds almost everywhere, relative to an ultrafilter &quot;F&quot;, if the set of points for which &quot;P&quot; holds is in &quot;F&quot;.

For example, one construction of the hyperreal number system defines a hyperreal number as an equivalence class of sequences that are equal almost everywhere as defined by an ultrafilter.

The definition of &quot;almost everywhere&quot; in terms of ultrafilters is closely related to the definition in terms of measures, because each ultrafilter defines a finitely-additive measure taking only the values 0 and 1, where a set has measure 1 if and only if it is included in the ultrafilter.

<doc id="44692" wikidata="Q43954" url="?curid=44692" title="Pope Leo I">
<text>Pope Leo I ( 400 – 10 November 461), also known as Leo the Great, was Bishop of Rome from 29 September 440 until his death. He is the first of the three Popes listed in the Annuario Pontificio with the title &quot;the Great&quot;, alongside Popes Gregory I and Nicholas I.

Leo was a Roman aristocrat. He is perhaps best known for having met Attila the Hun in 452 and persuading him to turn back from his invasion of Italy. He is also a Doctor of the Church, most remembered theologically for issuing the Tome of Leo, a document which was a major foundation to the debates of the Council of Chalcedon, the fourth ecumenical council. That meeting dealt primarily with Christology and elucidated the definition of Christ&#x27;s being as the hypostatic union of two natures, divine and human, united in one person, &quot;with neither confusion nor division&quot;. It was followed by a major schism associated with Monophysitism, Miaphysitism and Dyophysitism. He also contributed significantly to developing ideas of papal authority.

== Early life ==
According to the &quot;Liber Pontificalis&quot;, he was a native of Tuscany. By 431, as a deacon, he was sufficiently well known outside of Rome that John Cassian dedicated to him the treatise against Nestorius written at Leo&#x27;s suggestion. About this time Cyril of Alexandria appealed to Rome regarding a jurisdictional dispute with Juvenal of Jerusalem, but it is not entirely clear whether the letter was intended for Leo in his capacity as archdeacon, or for Pope Celestine I directly.

Near the end of the reign of Pope Sixtus III, Leo was dispatched at the request of Emperor Valentinian III to settle a dispute between Aëtius, one of Gaul&#x27;s chief military commanders, and the chief magistrate Albinus. Johann Peter Kirsch sees this commission as a proof of the confidence placed in the able deacon by the Imperial Court.

==Papacy==
During Leo&#x27;s absence in Gaul, Pope Sixtus III died on 11 August 440, and on 29 September Leo was unanimously elected by the people to succeed him. Soon after assuming the papal throne, Leo learned that in Aquileia, Pelagians were received into church communion without formal repudiation of their heresy; he censured this practice and directed that a provincial synod be held where such former Pelagians be required to make an unequivocal abjuration.

Leo claimed that Manichaeans, possibly fleeing Vandal Africa, had come to Rome and secretly organized there. In late 443, Leo preached a series of sermons condemning the Manichaeans and calling for Romans to denounce suspected heretics to their priests. Eventually, suspected heretics were brought to court, and likely under torture, they confessed to various crimes. By early 444, Leo announced to the bishops of Italy that the Manichaeans had been eradicated from Rome. According to his contemporary Prosper of Aquitaine, Leo exposed the Manichaeans and burned their books. He was equally firm against the Priscillianist sect. Bishop Turibius of Astorga, astonished at the spread of the sect in Spain, had addressed the other Spanish bishops on the subject, sending a copy of his letter to Leo, who took the opportunity to write an extended treatise (21 July 447) against the sect, examining its false teaching in detail and calling for a Spanish general council to investigate whether it had any adherents in the episcopate.

From a pastoral perspective, he energized charitable works in a Rome beset by famines, an influx of refugees, and poverty. He further associated the practice of fasting with charity and almsgiving, particularly on the occasion of the &quot;Quattro tempora&quot;, (the quarterly Ember days). It was during Leo&#x27;s papacy that the term &quot;Pope&quot;, which previously meant any bishop, came to exclusively mean the Bishop of Rome.

== Papal authority ==
Leo drew many learned men about him and chose Prosper of Aquitaine to act in some secretarial or notarial capacity. Leo was a significant contributor to the centralisation of spiritual authority within the Church and in reaffirming papal authority. In 450, the Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II, in a letter to Pope Leo I, was the first to call the Bishop of Rome the Patriarch of the West, a title that would continue to be used by the popes until the present days (only interrupted by a brief period between 2006 and 2024).

By 447, he declared that heretics deserved the most severe punishments. The Pope justified the death penalty declaring that if the followers of a heresy were allowed to live, that would be the end of human and Divine law.

===Various regional matters===
On several occasions, Leo was asked to arbitrate disputes in Gaul. Patroclus of Arles (d. 426) had received from Pope Zosimus the recognition of a subordinate primacy over the Gallican Church which was strongly asserted by his successor Hilary of Arles. An appeal from Chelidonius of Besançon gave Leo the opportunity to assert the pope&#x27;s authority over Hilary, who defended himself stoutly at Rome, refusing to recognize Leo&#x27;s judicial status. Feeling that the primatial rights of the bishop of Rome were threatened, Leo appealed to the civil power for support and obtained, from Valentinian III, a decree of 6 June 445, which recognized the primacy of the bishop of Rome based on the merits of Peter, the dignity of the city, and the legislation of the First Council of Nicaea; and provided for the forcible extradition by provincial governors of any bishop who refused to answer a summons to Rome. Faced with this decree, Hilary submitted to the pope, although under his successor, Ravennius, Leo divided the metropolitan rights between Arles and Vienne (450).

In 445, Leo disputed with Patriarch Dioscorus, Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s successor as Patriarch of Alexandria, insisting that the ecclesiastical practice of his see should follow that of Rome on the basis that Mark the Evangelist, the disciple of Peter the Apostle and the founder of the Alexandrian Church, could have had no other tradition than that of the prince of the apostles.

The fact that the African province of Mauretania Caesariensis had been preserved to the empire and thus to the Nicene faith during the Vandal invasion and, in its isolation, was disposed to rest on outside support, gave Leo an opportunity to assert his authority there. In 446 he wrote to the Church in Mauretania in regard to a number of questions of discipline, stressing the point that laymen were not to be appointed to the episcopate.

In a letter to the bishops of Campania, Picenum, and Tuscany (443) he required the observance of all his precepts and those of his predecessors; and he sharply rebuked the bishops of Sicily (447) for their deviation from the Roman custom as to the time of baptism, requiring them to send delegates to the Roman synod to learn the proper practice.

Because of the earlier line of division between the western and eastern parts of the Roman Empire, Illyria was ecclesiastically subject to Rome. Pope Innocent I had constituted the metropolitan of Thessalonica his vicar, in order to oppose the growing influence of the patriarch of Constantinople in the area. In a letter of about 446 to a successor bishop of Thessalonica, Anastasius, Leo reproached him for the way he had treated one of the metropolitan bishops subject to him; after giving various instructions about the functions entrusted to Anastasius and stressing that certain powers were reserved to the pope himself, Leo wrote: &quot;The care of the universal Church should converge towards Peter&#x27;s one seat, and nothing anywhere should be separated from its Head.&quot;

He succeeded in having an imperial patriarch, Timothy Salophakiolos, and not Timotheus Aelurus, chosen as Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria on the murder of Greek Patriarch Proterius of Alexandria.

==Writings==

Almost 100 sermons and 150 letters of Leo I have been preserved.

===&quot;Tome&quot;===

At the Second Council of Ephesus in 449, Leo&#x27;s representatives delivered his famous &quot;Tome&quot;, a statement of the faith of the Roman Church in the form of a letter addressed to Archbishop Flavian of Constantinople, which repeats, in close adherence to Augustine of Hippo, the formulas of western Christology. The council did not read the letter nor did it pay any attention to the protests of Leo&#x27;s legates but deposed Flavian and Eusebius of Dorylaeum, who appealed to Rome. That is one reason that the council was never recognized as ecumenical and was later repudiated by the Council of Chalcedon.

It was presented again at the subsequent Council of Chalcedon as offering a solution to the Christological controversies still raging between East and West.

===Council of Chalcedon===

Eutyches, in the beginning of the conflict, appealed to Leo and took refuge with him on his condemnation by Flavian, but on receiving full information from Flavian, Leo took his side decisively. Leo demanded of the emperor that an ecumenical council should be held in Italy, and in the meantime, at a Roman synod in October 449, repudiated all the decisions of the &quot;Robber Synod&quot;. In his letters to the emperor and others he demanded the deposition of Eutyches as a Manichaean and Docetic heretic.

The Council of Chalcedon of 451 rejected the heresy of Eutyches who denied the true human nature of the Son of God, and affirmed the union in his one Person, without confusion and without separation, of his two natures, human and divine.

The acts of the council report: &quot;After the reading of the foregoing epistle, the most reverend bishops cried out: This is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the Apostles. So we all believe, thus the orthodox believe. Anathema to him who does not thus believe. Peter has spoken thus through Leo. So taught the Apostles. Piously and truly did Leo teach, so taught Cyril. Everlasting be the memory of Cyril. Leo and Cyril taught the same thing, anathema to him who does not so believe. This is the true faith. Those of us who are orthodox thus believe. This is the faith of the fathers. Why were not these things read at Ephesus? These are the things Dioscorus hid away.&quot;

Leo firmly declined to confirm their disciplinary arrangements, which seemed to allow Constantinople a practically equal authority with Rome and regarded the civil importance of a city as a determining factor in its ecclesiastical position; but he strongly supported its dogmatic decrees, especially when, after the accession of Emperor Leo I (457), there seemed to be a disposition toward compromise with the Eutychians.

=== Teaching on Christ ===
Leo&#x27;s writings (sermons and letters) mostly discuss theological questions concerning the person of Jesus Christ
(Christology) and his role as mediator and savior (Soteriology), which is partially connected to the Council of Chalcedon, in which Roman legates represented Leo. Subsequently, through numerous letters to bishops and members of the imperial family, Leo incessantly worked for the propagation and universal reception of the faith in Christ as defined by Chalcedon, also in the eastern part of the Roman empire. Leo defends both the true divinity and true humanity of Christ against heretical one-sidedness. He takes up this topic also in many of his sermons, and over the years, he further develops his own original concepts. A central idea around which Leo deepens and explains his theology is Christ&#x27;s presence in the Church, more specifically in the teaching and preaching of the faith (Scripture, Tradition and their interpretation), in the liturgy (sacraments and celebrations), in the life of the individual believer and of the organized Church, especially in a council.

To Leo the Great, Mariology is determined by Christology. If Christ were divine only, everything about him would be divine. Only his divinity would have been crucified, buried and resurrected. Mary would only be the mother of God, and Christians would have no hope for their own resurrection. The nucleus of Christianity would be destroyed. The most unusual beginning of a truly human life through her was to give birth to Jesus, the Lord and Son of King David.

=== Oriental Orthodox view ===

Leo&#x27;s Christological formula however was not entirely well received. Following the death of Dioscorus, the See of Alexandria split into two rival patriarchates; opposing and supporting Chalcedon respectively. The former of which, led by Timothy II of Alexandria would condemn both the heresy of Eutyches as well as the Council of Chalcedon and the Tome of Leo at the Third Council of Ephesus. The communion that accepted Ephesus III is known today as the Oriental Orthodox Church.

Ephesus III accused Leo&#x27;s formula of two natures after the union as being fundamentally no different to the view of Nestorius, contradicting Cyril of Alexandria&#x27;s formula of &quot;mia physis tou Theo logou sesarkōmenē&quot;, or &quot;one (mia) nature of the Word of God incarnate&quot; (μία φύσις τοῦ θεοῦ λόγου σεσαρκωμένη).

Several Oriental Orthodox Church historians, such as Pakhoum A. El-Moharraky and Waheeb Atalla Girgis have viewed the council as a dispute with the Church of Rome over precedence among the various patriarchal sees. Coptic sources, both in Coptic and in Arabic, suggest that questions of political and ecclesiastical authority exaggerated differences between the two professions of faith. The Coptic Orthodox Christians are Miaphysites, which means they believe that Jesus Christ is both 100% human and 100% divine but in one person without mingling, confusion or alteration. In every liturgy till this day, the Copts recite “Christ&#x27;s divinity parted not from His humanity, not for a single moment nor a twinkling of an eye&quot;.

===Heir of Peter===
Leo assumed the papacy at a time of increasing barbarian invasions; this, coupled with the decreasing imperial authority in the West, forced the Bishop of Rome to take a more active part in civil and political affairs. He was one of the first bishops of Rome to promote papal primacy based on succession from Peter the Apostle; and he did so as a means of maintaining unity among the churches.

Besides recourse to biblical language, Leo also described his own special relationship with Peter in terms derived from Roman law. He called himself the (unworthy) heir and deputy (&quot;vicarius&quot;) of Peter, having received his apostolic authority and being obliged to follow his example. On the one hand, Peter stood before him with a claim on how Leo is to exercise his office; on the other hand, Leo, as the Roman bishop, represented the Apostle, whose authority he held. Christ, however, always comes out as the source of all grace and authority, and Leo is responsible to him for how he fulfilled his duties (sermon 1). Thus, the office of the Roman bishop was grounded on the special relationship between Christ and Peter, a relationship that cannot be repeated per se; therefore, Leo depended on Peter&#x27;s mediation, his assistance and his example in order to be able to adequately fulfill his role and exercise his authority as the Bishop of Rome, both in the city and beyond.

== Leo and Attila ==
After the indecisive outcome of the Battle of Chalons in 451, Attila invaded Italy in 452, sacking cities such as Aquileia and heading for Rome. He allegedly demanded that the sister of the reigning Emperor Valentinian III be sent to him with a dowry. In response, the emperor sent three envoys to negotiate with Attila: Gennadius Avienus, one of the consuls of 450, Memmius Aemilius Trygetius, the former urban prefect, and Leo. Little is known of the specifics of the negotiations, as a result of which Attila withdrew. Most ancient and medieval historians celebrated Leo&#x27;s actions, giving him all the credit for this successful embassy. According to Prosper of Aquitaine, who was alive at the time of the event, Attila was so impressed by Leo that he withdrew. Another near-contemporary was the historian Priscus who records that Attila was dissuaded from attacking Rome by his own men because they feared he would share the fate of the Visigothic king Alaric, who died shortly after sacking the city in 410. Paul the Deacon, in the late 8th century, relates that an enormously huge man dressed in priestly robes and armed with a sword, visible only to Attila, threatened him and his army with death during his discourse with Leo, and this prompted Attila to submit to his request.

Writing in the early 20th century, the religious skeptic John B. Bury remarked: 

The fact of the embassy cannot be doubted. The distinguished ambassadors visited the Hun&#x27;s camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But we are at a loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would have cared for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, and at the same time troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.

Leo&#x27;s intercession could not prevent the sack of the city by the Vandal King Genseric in 455, but murder and arson were repressed by his influence. The Pope and members of his clergy, went to meet the invader to implore him to desist. While the Vandals plundered the city, the gesture nevertheless prevented Rome from being burned and assured that the Basilicas of St Peter, St Paul and St John, in which part of the terrified population sought refuge, were spared. Leo assisted in rebuilding the city of Rome, restoring key places such as Saint Peter&#x27;s.

== On the fundamental dignity of Christians ==
In his &quot;In Nativitate Domini&quot;, Christmas Day, sermon, &quot;Christian, remember your dignity&quot;, Leo articulates a fundamental dignity common to all Christians, whether saints or sinners, and the consequent obligation to live up to it:
==Death and burial==
Leo died on 10 November 461 and, as he wished to be buried as close as possible to the tomb of St. Peter, his body was entombed within the portico of Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica. He was the first pope to be buried within St. Peter&#x27;s. In 688, Pope Sergius I had Leo&#x27;s remains moved to the south transept, inside the basilica. The relocation was apparently due to the number of later papal burials obscuring the prominence that Sergius believed Leo&#x27;s tomb should have.

== Significance ==
Pope Benedict XVI said that Leo&#x27;s papacy was &quot;undoubtedly one of the most important in the Church&#x27;s history&quot;.

In 1754 Pope Benedict XIV proclaimed Leo I a Doctor of the Church. Next to Leo only one other pope, Gregory I, is also recognized as Doctor of the Church.

The Catholic Church marks 10 November as the feast day of Saint Leo, given in the &quot;Martyrologium Hieronymianum&quot; and the 8th-century Calendar of Saint Willibrord as the date of his death and entry to heaven. His feast was once celebrated in Rome on 28 June, the anniversary of the placing of his relics in Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, but in the 12th century, the Gallican Rite feast of 11 April was admitted to the General Roman Calendar, which maintained that date until 1969.

The Eastern Catholic Churches as well as the Eastern Orthodox Church celebrate Saint Leo on 18 February.

Leo the Great is honored in the Church of England and in the Episcopal Church on 10 November.

In the Roman rite, fragments of his texts are read in the liturgy of hours, for example on Christmas.

<doc id="44696" wikidata="Q208632" url="?curid=44696" title="It Happened One Night">
<text>It Happened One Night is a 1934 American pre-Code romantic comedy film with elements of screwball comedy directed and co-produced by Frank Capra, in collaboration with Harry Cohn, in which a pampered socialite (Claudette Colbert) tries to get out from under her father&#x27;s thumb and falls in love with a roguish reporter (Clark Gable). The screenplay by Robert Riskin is based on the August 1933 short story &quot;Night Bus&quot; by Samuel Hopkins Adams, which provided the shooting title. Classified as a &quot;pre-Code&quot; production, the film is among the last romantic comedies created before the MPPDA began rigidly enforcing the 1930 Motion Picture Production Code in July 1934. &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; was released just four months prior to that enforcement.

It is seen as one of the greatest films ever made&quot;. It Happened One Night&quot; is the first of only three films (along with &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot;) to win all five major Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Adapted Screenplay. In 1993, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress, being deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. In 2013, the film underwent an extensive restoration by Sony Pictures. The film&#x27;s copyright was renewed in 1962, and under current United States law it will enter the public domain on January 1, 2030.

==Plot==
Spoiled heiress Ellen &quot;Ellie&quot; Andrews has eloped with pilot and fortune-hunter King Westley against the wishes of her extremely wealthy father, Alexander Andrews, who has sequestered his daughter and wants to have the marriage annulled because he knows that Westley is interested only in Ellie&#x27;s money. Jumping ship in Florida, Ellie runs away and boards a Greyhound bus to New York City to reunite with her husband. She meets fellow passenger Peter Warne, a newspaper reporter who recently lost his job. Soon, Peter recognizes her and gives her a choice: if she gives him an exclusive on her story, he will help her reach Westley. If not, he will tell her father where she is. Ellie agrees.

Ellie loses her initial disdain for Peter and they begin to fall in love. When the bus breaks down, they try hitchhiking. They fail to secure a ride until Ellie displays a shapely leg to Danker, the next driver. When they stop en route, Danker tries to drive away with their luggage, but Peter chases him down and takes his Model T. Near the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love to Peter. The owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peter&#x27;s car is gone and expel Ellie. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie telephones her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley. Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie but he misses her on the road. Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes that Peter has betrayed her for the reward money and so agrees to have a second, formal wedding with Westley.

On the wedding day, she finally reveals the whole story to her father. When Peter comes to Ellie&#x27;s home, Andrews offers him the reward money, but Peter insists on being paid only his expenses, a mere $39.60 for items that he had been forced to sell to buy gasoline. When Andrews presses Peter for an explanation of his odd behavior and demands to know if he loves her, Peter first tries to dodge the questions but then admits that he does and storms out. Westley arrives via an autogyro, but at the ceremony, Andrews reveals to his daughter Peter&#x27;s refusal of the reward money and tells her that her car is waiting by the back gate in case she changes her mind. At the last minute, Ellie dumps Westley at the altar, bolts for her car, and drives away as the newsreel cameras crank.

A few days later, Andrews is working at his desk when Westley calls to tell him that he will take the financial settlement and not contest the annulment. His executive assistant brings him a telegram from Peter: &quot;What&#x27;s holding up the annulment, you slowpoke? The walls of Jericho are toppling!&quot; That is a reference to a makeshift wall made of a blanket hung over a rope that was tied across the rooms separating the beds they had slept in, in order to give them each privacy while traveling together. With the annulment in hand, Andrews sends the reply, &quot;Let &#x27;em topple.&quot;

Peter&#x27;s battered Model T is parked in a motor court in Glen Falls, Michigan. The mom-and-pop owners talk and wonder why, on such a warm night, the newlyweds (he had seen the marriage license) wanted a clothesline, an extra blanket, and a little tin trumpet. As they look at the cabin, the toy trumpet sounds a fanfare, the blanket falls to the floor, and the lights in the cabin go out.

==Production==
===Casting===

Neither Gable nor Colbert was the first choice to play the lead roles. Miriam Hopkins rejected the part of Ellie. Robert Montgomery and Myrna Loy were then offered the roles, but both turned down the script. Loy later noted that the final story as filmed bore little resemblance to the script that she and Montgomery had been given. Margaret Sullavan also rejected the part. Constance Bennett was willing to accept the role if she could produce the film herself but Columbia Pictures would not agree to that condition. Bette Davis then wanted the role but she was under contract with Warner Brothers and Jack L. Warner refused to lend her. Carole Lombard was unable to accept because Columbia&#x27;s proposed filming schedule would conflict with her work on &quot;Bolero&quot; at Paramount. Loretta Young also turned it down.

Harry Cohn suggested Colbert, who initially turned down the role. Her first film, &quot;For the Love of Mike&quot; (1927), had been directed by Capra and was such a disaster that neither wanted to work with the other again. Later, she agreed to the role only if her salary was doubled to $50,000 and if her scenes were completed in four weeks so that she could take a planned vacation.

According to Hollywood legend, Gable was lent to Columbia Pictures, then considered a minor studio, as punishment for refusing a role at his own studio. That tale has been partially refuted by more recent biographies. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer did not have a project ready for Gable and the studio was paying him his contracted salary of $2,000 per week whether he worked or not. Louis B. Mayer lent him to Columbia for $2,500 per week, hence netting MGM $500 per week while he was gone. Capra, however, insisted that Gable was a reluctant participant in the film.

===Filming===
Filming began in a tense atmosphere as Gable and Colbert were dissatisfied with the quality of the script. Capra understood their dissatisfaction and let screenwriter Robert Riskin rewrite it. Colbert continued to show her displeasure on the set. She also initially balked at pulling up her skirt to entice a passing driver to provide a ride, complaining that it was unladylike. Upon seeing the chorus girl who was brought in as her body double, an outraged Colbert told the director, &quot;Get her out of here. I&#x27;ll do it. That&#x27;s not my leg!&quot; Capra claimed that Colbert &quot;had many little tantrums, motivated by her antipathy toward me,&quot; however, &quot;she was wonderful in the part.&quot; Part of the film was made on Thousand Oaks Boulevard in Thousand Oaks, California.

==Reception==

After filming was done, Colbert complained to her friend, &quot;I just finished the worst picture in the world.&quot; Columbia appeared to have low expectations for the film and did not mount much of an advertising campaign for it. Initial reviews were generally positive. Mordaunt Hall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a good piece of fiction, which, with all its feverish stunts, is blessed with bright dialogue and a good quota of relatively restrained scenes&quot;. Hall described Colbert&#x27;s performance as &quot;engaging and lively&quot; and Gable as &quot;excellent&quot;. The movie also premiered at the Radio City Music Hall. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that it was &quot;without a particularly strong plot&quot; but &quot;manages to come through in a big way, due to the acting, dialog, situations and directing&quot;. &quot;Film Daily&quot; praised it as &quot;a lively yarn, fast-moving, plenty humorous, racy enough to be tantalizing, and yet perfectly decorous&quot;. The &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; called it &quot;lively and amusing&quot;.

John Mosher of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; panned it as &quot;pretty much nonsense and quite dreary&quot; which was probably the review Capra had in mind when he recalled in his autobiography that &quot;sophisticated&quot; critics had dismissed the film. Despite the positive reviews, the film was only moderately successful in its initial run. After it was released to secondary movie houses, ticket sales became brisk, especially in smaller towns where the film&#x27;s characters and simple romance struck a chord with moviegoers who were not surrounded by luxury. It turned out to be a major box office smash, easily Columbia&#x27;s biggest hit until the late 1980s. During its initial release, the film earned $1 million in theater rentals from the United States and Canada.

Rotten Tomatoes compiled 108 reviews of the film to form a 98% score and an average rating of 9.1/10. The consensus reads, &quot;Capturing its stars and director at their finest, &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; remains unsurpassed by the countless romantic comedies it has inspired&quot;. The film holds a score of 87 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 16 critics.

Colbert was nominated for an Academy Award, but decided not to attend the ceremony since she felt she would not win and planned to take a cross-country railroad trip. After she was named the winner, studio chief Harry Cohn sent someone to &quot;drag her off&quot; the train, which had not yet departed, to bring her to the ceremony. Colbert arrived wearing a two-piece traveling suit which she had had the Paramount Pictures costume designer, Travis Banton, make for her trip.

===Academy Awards===
The film won all five of the Academy Awards for which it was nominated at the 7th Academy Awards for 1934:
&quot;It Happened One Night&quot; was the first film to win the &quot;Big Five&quot; Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Writing). , only two films have matched this feat: &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; in 1975 and &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; in 1991.

On December 15, 1996, Gable&#x27;s Oscar was auctioned off to Steven Spielberg for $607,500, who donated the statuette to the Motion Picture Academy. In June of the following year, Colbert&#x27;s Oscar was offered for auction by Christie&#x27;s but attracted no bids.

===Others===
The film was included in the following American Film Institute lists:
* 1998: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies – #35
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #8
* 2002: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Passions – #38
* 2007: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) – #46
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10: Romantic Comedy – #3

==Influence==
&quot;It Happened One Night&quot; made an immediate impact on the public. In one scene, Gable undresses for bed, taking off his shirt to reveal that he is bare-chested. An urban legend claims that, as a result, sales of men&#x27;s undershirts declined noticeably. The movie also prominently features a Greyhound bus in the story, spurring interest in bus travel nationwide.

The unpublished memoirs of animator Friz Freleng mention that this was one of his favorite films. &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; has a few parallels with, and may have even inspired certain characteristics of, the cartoon character Bugs Bunny, who made his first appearance six years later, and who Freleng helped develop. In the film, a minor character, Oscar Shapely, continually calls the Gable character &quot;Doc,&quot; an imaginary character named &quot;Bugs Dooley&quot; is mentioned once in order to frighten Shapely, and there is also a scene in which Gable eats carrots while talking quickly with his mouth full, as Bugs does.

==Restoration==
In 2013 &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; was digitally restored. A new wet-gate master was produced by Sony Colorworks for scanning at 4K. The images were digitally treated at Prasad Corporation to remove dirt, tears, scratches, and other artifacts. Care was taken to preserve the original look of the film.

==Remakes and adaptations==
The film has inspired a number of remakes, including the musicals &quot;Eve Knew Her Apples&quot; (1945) starring Ann Miller and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Run Away from It&quot; (1956) starring June Allyson and Jack Lemmon, which was directed and produced by Dick Powell.

&quot;It Happened One Night&quot; was adapted as a one-hour radio play on the March 20, 1939 broadcast of &quot;Lux Radio Theatre&quot;, with Colbert and Gable reprising their roles. The screenplay was also adapted as a radio play for the January 28, 1940, broadcast of &quot;The Campbell Playhouse&quot;, starring Orson Welles (Mr. Andrews), William Powell (Peter Warne) and Miriam Hopkins (Ellie Andrews).

&quot;It Happened One Night&quot; has been adapted into numerous Indian films. These include three Hindi adaptations: &quot;Chori Chori&quot; (1956), &quot;Nau Do Gyarah&quot; (1957) and &quot;Dil Hai Ke Manta Nahin&quot; (1991), one Bengali adaptation &quot;Chaoa Paoa&quot; (1959), two Tamil adaptations: &quot;Chandrodayam&quot; (1966) and &quot;Kadhal Rojavae&quot; (2000), and one Kannada adaptation &quot;Hudugaata&quot; (2007).

==In popular culture==
The 1937 Laurel and Hardy comedy &quot;Way Out West&quot; parodied the famous hitchhiking scene with Stan Laurel managing to stop a stage coach using the same technique. &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot; (1997) by Danny Boyle has a plot that shares similarities with &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; and clearly references the movie in its own hitchhiking scene.

Mel Brooks&#x27;s film &quot;Spaceballs&quot; (1987) parodies the wedding scene. As she walks down the aisle to wed Prince Valium, Princess Vespa (Daphne Zuniga) is told by King Roland (Dick Van Patten) that Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) forsook the reward for the princess&#x27;s return and only asked to be reimbursed for the cost of the trip.

Other films have used familiar plot points from &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;. In &quot;Bandits&quot; (2001), Joe Blake (Bruce Willis) erects a blanket partition between motel room beds out of respect for Kate Wheeler&#x27;s (Cate Blanchett&#x27;s) privacy. He remarks that he saw people do the same thing in an old movie. In &quot;Sex and the City 2&quot;, Carrie and Mr. Big watch the film (specifically the hitchhiking scene) in a hotel; later in the film Carrie uses the idea which she got from the film to get a taxi in the Middle East.

In &quot;The Bogman of Letchmoor Heath&quot;, the second episode of the horror/comedy television series &quot;She-Wolf of London&quot; (1990–1991), lead characters Randi Wallace (Kate Hodge) and Ian Matheson (Neil Dickson) rent a motel room, and, uncomfortable with the lack of privacy afforded, Ian stretches a bed sheet like a curtain between the two beds. Ian makes reference to &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; but Randi is unfamiliar with the film, remarking that she would rather &quot;read a book&quot;.

Beginning in January 2014, the comic &quot;9 Chickweed Lane&quot; tied a story arc to &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; when one of the characters, Lt. William O&#x27;Malley, is injured during World War II and believes himself to be Peter Warne. As he sneaks through German-occupied France, several plot points run parallel to that of &quot;It Happened One Night&quot; and he believes his French contact to be Ellen Andrews.

<text>The Zinoviev letter was a forged document published and sensationalised by the British &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper four days before the 1924 United Kingdom general election, which was held on 29 October. The letter purported to be a directive from Grigory Zinoviev, the head of the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow, to the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB), ordering it to engage in seditious activities. It stated that the normalisation of British–Soviet relations under a Labour Party government would radicalise the British working class and put the CPGB in a favourable position to pursue a Bolshevik-style revolution. It further suggested that these effects would extend throughout the British Empire. The right-wing press depicted the letter as a grave foreign subversion of British politics and blamed the incumbent Labour government under Ramsay MacDonald for promoting the policy of political reconciliation and open trade with the Soviet Union on which the scheme appeared to depend. The election resulted in the fall of the first Labour government and a strong victory for the Conservative Party and the continued collapse of the Liberal Party. Labour supporters often blamed the letter, at least in part, for their party&#x27;s defeat.

The letter was widely taken to be authentic upon publication and for some time afterwards, but historians now agree it was a forgery. The letter perhaps aided the Conservative Party by hastening the ongoing collapse of the Liberal Party vote, which, in turn, produced a Conservative landslide. A. J. P. Taylor argued that the letter&#x27;s most important impact was on the mindset of Labourites, who for years afterwards blamed foul play for their defeat, thereby misunderstanding the political forces at work and postponing what Taylor regarded as necessary reforms in the Labour Party.

== History ==


=== Background ===
On 22 January 1924, the Labour Party formed a government in the United Kingdom for the first time. However, it was a minority government and therefore liable to fall if the Conservatives and Liberals combined against it. In foreign policy, the government used its executive powers to offer official recognition of the Soviet Union in February 1924. It also proposed to lend it money and to open up trade, but parliament mostly obstructed these measures. On 8 October 1924, the Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald suffered defeat in the House of Commons on a motion of no confidence forwarded by the Liberals, who had until then supported the continuation of the minority government while also blocking most of its signature policy initiatives. Instead of resigning, MacDonald obtained permission from King George V for a dissolution of Parliament and the holding of a new election. The immediate cause of the parliamentary defeat had been the government&#x27;s decision to drop the prosecution of communist editor John Ross Campbell under the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797, for publication of an open letter in &quot;Workers&#x27; Weekly&quot; calling on soldiers to &quot;let it be known that, neither in the class war nor in a military war, will you turn your guns on your fellow workers, but instead will line up with your fellow workers in an attack upon the exploiters and capitalists, and will use your arms on the side of your own class.&quot; A general election was scheduled for 29 October.

=== Letter ===
Near the end of the short election campaign, there appeared in the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper the text of a letter addressed to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) purporting to have originated from Grigory Zinoviev, head of the Executive Committee of the Communist International (Comintern); Secretary of the Comintern Otto Wille Kuusinen; and Arthur MacManus, a British representative at a conference of the Executive Committee. It predicted that the Labour government&#x27;s attempted normalisation of Britain&#x27;s diplomatic and economic relations with the Soviet Union would not only profit the latter but also stir the British proletariat to revolutionary action and allow Soviet influence throughout the British Empire to widen.
One particularly damaging section of this letter read:
=== Publication ===
The document was published in the conservative &quot;Daily Mail&quot; newspaper four days before the election and then picked up by other right-wing newspapers. The letter rankled at a sensitive time in relations between Britain and the Soviet Union, owing to vehement Conservative opposition to the parliamentary ratification of the Anglo-Soviet trade agreement of 8 August.

The publication of the letter was severely embarrassing to Prime Minister MacDonald and his Labour Party. Although his party faced a high likelihood of losing office, MacDonald had not given up hope in the campaign. Following the letter&#x27;s publication, any chance of an upset victory was dashed, as the spectre of internal unrest and a government oblivious to, or even complicit in, the alleged peril thereof dominated the headlines and public discourse. MacDonald&#x27;s attempts to cast doubt on the authenticity of the letter were in vain, hampered by the document&#x27;s widespread acceptance among government officials. He told his Cabinet that he &quot;felt like a man sewn in a sack and thrown into the sea.&quot;.

=== Election result ===
The Conservatives decisively won the October 1924 election, ending the country&#x27;s first Labour government. After the Conservatives formed a government with Stanley Baldwin as Prime Minister, a Cabinet committee investigated the letter and concluded that it was genuine. The Conservative government did not undertake any further investigation, despite continuing suggestions that the letter was forged. On 21 November 1924, the government cancelled the unratified trade agreement with the Soviet Union. At about this juncture, MI5 determined secretly that the letter was beyond question a forgery. In order to protect its reputation and to keep the myth of Labour&#x27;s acquiescence to the Soviet Union alive, it did not inform the rest of the government, which continued to treat it as genuine.

The Conservatives gained 155 seats, for a total of 413 seats. Labour lost 40 seats, retaining 151. The Liberals lost 118 seats, were left with only 40, and lost over a million votes.

=== Denial by Zinoviev ===
The Comintern and the Soviet government strongly and consistently denied the authenticity of the document. Grigory Zinoviev issued a denial on 27 October 1924 (two days before the election), which was finally published in English in the December 1924 issue of &quot;The Communist Review&quot;, the monthly theoretical magazine of the CPGB, well after the MacDonald government had already fallen. Zinoviev declared:

=== Impact ===

Most historians now agree that the letter had little immediate impact on the Labour vote, which not only held up but, in fact, increased slightly in terms of its share of the popular vote (although the main reason for this uptick was that the party fielded candidates in 87 more constituencies than it had in the previous election). Still, the letter helped to propel the Conservatives to a large parliamentary majority by allowing them to poach voters frightened by the First Red Scare from the withering Liberal bloc. The Conservative politician Robert Rhodes James claimed that the letter provided Labour &quot;with a magnificent excuse for failure and defeat. The inadequacies that had been exposed in the Government in its brief existence could be ignored&quot;. Indeed, many Labourites for years blamed the letter, at least in part, for the defeat of the party. Figures such as Taylor believed that some of them misunderstood the political forces at work and learned the wrong lessons. Many others, however, have held up the letter as a chief factor in the election outcome.

The real significance of the election was that the Liberal Party, whom Labour had displaced as the second-largest political party in 1922, became once again a minor party, its no-confidence gambit having completely backfired.

A 1967 British study concluded the Labour Party was destined for defeat in October 1924 in any event and argued that the primary effect of the purported Comintern communiqué fell on Anglo-Soviet relations:
== Current scholarship ==

Contemporary scholarship on the Zinoviev letter dates from a 1967 monograph published by three British journalists working for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. The authors, Lewis Chester, Steven Fay and Hugo Young, asserted that two members of a Russian monarchist organisation called the &quot;Brotherhood of St. George&quot; composed the document in Berlin. Irina Bellegarde, the widow of Alexis Bellegarde, one of the two men said to have written the document, stated that she had witnessed the forgery as it was performed. She said that her husband had drafted the letter after fellow-émigré Alexander Gumansky told him that a request to forge the letter had come from &quot;a person in authority in London&quot;. Gurmansky and Bellegarde were later sentenced to death &quot;in absentia&quot; by a Soviet court. Bellegarde was later forced to work during the Second World War for the Russian section of the Abwehr (German military intelligence) in Berlin. Some evidence suggests that he was the highly effective British double agent known as &quot;Outcast&quot;. He had been an important source on Soviet matters for the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS; commonly known as MI6) since the First World War, raising the possibility that he already had deep links to British intelligence when involved in the fabrication of the Zinoviev letter.

The forgers appear to have studied Bolshevik documents and signatures extensively before creating the letter to undermine the Soviet regime&#x27;s relations with the United Kingdom. The British Foreign Office had received the forgery on 10 October 1924, two days after the defeat of the MacDonald government on the no-confidence motion initiated by the Liberals. Despite the dubious nature of the document, wheels were set in motion for its publication, members of the Conservative Party combining with Foreign Office officials in what Chester, Fay, and Young characterised as a &quot;conspiracy&quot;.

These findings and allegations motivated the British Foreign Office to undertake a study of their own. For three years, Milicent Bagot of MI5 examined the archives and conducted interviews with surviving witnesses. She produced a long account of the affair, but the paper ultimately proved unpublishable because it contained sensitive operational and personnel information. Nevertheless, Bagot&#x27;s work proved important as a secondary source when the Foreign Office revisited the matter three decades later.

In the first two months of 1998, rumours of a forthcoming book on the true origins of the Zinoviev letter, based on information from Soviet archives, led to renewed press speculation and parliamentary questions. In response, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook announced on 12 February that, in the interests of openness, he had commissioned the historians of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to prepare a historical memorandum on the Zinoviev letter, drawing upon archival documents.

A paper by the Chief Historian of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Gill Bennett, was published in January 1999 and contains the results of this inquiry. Bennett had free and unfettered access to the archives of the Foreign Office, as well as those of the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) and MI5. She also visited Moscow in the course of her research, working in the archives of the Executive Committee of the Communist International, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Comintern archive of the Communist Party of Great Britain. Although not every operational detail could be published because of British secrecy laws, the publicly available extracts of Bennett&#x27;s paper still provided a rich account of the Zinoviev letter affair. Her report showed that the letter contained statements very similar to those made by Zinoviev to other communist parties and at other times to the CPGB, but at the time of the letter (when Anglo-Soviet trade talks were taking place and a general election was impending), Zinoviev and the Soviet government had adopted a more restrained attitude towards propaganda in Britain. Despite her extensive research, she concluded &quot;it is impossible to say who wrote the Zinoviev Letter&quot;, though her best guess was that it was commissioned by White Russian intelligence circles from forgers in Berlin or the Baltic states, most likely in Riga. It was then leaked to the papers, probably by MI6, that she had stated, &quot;I have my doubts as to whether [Desmond Morton] thought it was genuine but he treated it as if it was.&quot;

In 2006, Bennett incorporated some of her findings on the Zinoviev letter into chapter four of her biography of SIS agent Desmond Morton. Another 2006 book on spycraft attributes authorship to Vladimir Orlov, a former intelligence agent of Baron Wrangel during the Russian Civil War. The British historian Nigel West wrote that the OGPU (Soviet secret police) always initiated investigations into leaks of Soviet documents and into mishandlings of propaganda, and the fact no investigation was opened after the publication of the Zinoviev letter indicates it was certainly a forgery.

In 2011, Jonathan Pile published his book &quot;Churchill&#x27;s Secret Enemy&quot;, detailing the mysterious career of Sir George Joseph Ball. Pile accessed Ball&#x27;s papers (most of which Ball had attempted to destroy) from the Bodleian Library, along with other newly available sources. Pile&#x27;s thesis, explained in the book, is that the Zinoviev letter was likely composed by Ball (at the time a long-serving MI5 officer) and his cohorts.

In 2017, the British government claimed that it had &quot;lost&quot; a file on the Zinoviev letter scandal. The government added that they were unable to determine whether copies of the material had been made.

In 2018, Bennett published her book &quot;The Zinoviev Letter: The Conspiracy that Never Dies&quot;.

<doc id="44700" wikidata="Q36956" url="?curid=44700" title="Leprosy">
<text>Leprosy, also known as Hansen&#x27;s disease (HD), is a long-term infection by the bacteria &quot;Mycobacterium leprae&quot; or &quot;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&quot;. Infection can lead to damage of the nerves, respiratory tract, skin, and eyes. This nerve damage may result in a lack of ability to feel pain, which can lead to the loss of parts of a person&#x27;s extremities from repeated injuries or infection through unnoticed wounds. An infected person may also experience muscle weakness and poor eyesight. Leprosy symptoms may begin within one year, but for some people symptoms may take 20 years or more to occur.

Leprosy is spread between people, although extensive contact is necessary. Leprosy has a low pathogenicity, and 95% of people who contract or who are exposed to &quot;M. leprae&quot; do not develop the disease. Spread is likely through a cough or contact with fluid from the nose of a person infected by leprosy. Genetic factors and immune function play a role in how easily a person catches the disease. Leprosy does not spread during pregnancy to the unborn child or through sexual contact. Leprosy occurs more commonly among people living in poverty. There are two main types of the disease – paucibacillary and multibacillary, which differ in the number of bacteria present. A person with paucibacillary disease has five or fewer poorly pigmented, numb skin patches, while a person with multibacillary disease has more than five skin patches. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding acid-fast bacilli in a biopsy of the skin.

Leprosy is curable with multidrug therapy. Treatment of paucibacillary leprosy is with the medications dapsone, rifampicin, and clofazimine for six months. Treatment for multibacillary leprosy uses the same medications for 12 months. Several other antibiotics may also be used. These treatments are provided free of charge by the World Health Organization.

Leprosy is not highly contagious. People with leprosy can live with their families and go to school and work. In the 1980s, there were 5.2 million cases globally, but by 2020 this decreased to fewer than 200,000. Most new cases occur in one of 14 countries, with India accounting for more than half of all new cases. In the 20 years from 1994 to 2014, 16 million people worldwide were cured of leprosy. About 200 cases per year are reported in the United States. Central Florida accounted for 81% of cases in Florida and nearly 1 out of 5 leprosy cases nationwide. Separating people affected by leprosy by placing them in leper colonies is not supported by evidence but still occurs in some areas of India, China, Japan, Africa, and Thailand.

Leprosy has affected humanity for thousands of years. The disease takes its name from the Greek word (), from (; &#x27;scale&#x27;), while the term &quot;Hansen&#x27;s disease&quot; is named after the Norwegian physician Gerhard Armauer Hansen. Leprosy has historically been associated with social stigma, which continues to be a barrier to self-reporting and early treatment. Leprosy is classified as a neglected tropical disease. World Leprosy Day was started in 1954 to draw awareness to those affected by leprosy.
The study of leprosy and its treatment is known as leprology.
== Signs and symptoms ==
Common symptoms present in the different types of leprosy include a runny nose; dry scalp; eye problems; skin lesions; muscle weakness; reddish skin; smooth, shiny, diffuse thickening of facial skin, ear, and hand; loss of sensation in fingers and toes; thickening of peripheral nerves; a flat nose from the destruction of nasal cartilages; and changes in phonation and other aspects of speech production. In addition, atrophy of the testes and impotence may occur.

Leprosy can affect people in different ways. The average incubation period is five years. People may begin to notice symptoms within the first year or up to 20 years after infection. The first noticeable sign of leprosy is often the development of pale or pink coloured patches of skin that may be insensitive to temperature or pain. Patches of discolored skin are sometimes accompanied or preceded by nerve problems including numbness or tenderness in the hands or feet. Secondary infections (additional bacterial or viral infections) can result in tissue loss, causing fingers and toes to become shortened and deformed, as cartilage is absorbed into the body. A person&#x27;s immune response differs depending on the form of leprosy.

Approximately 30% of people affected with leprosy experience nerve damage. The nerve damage sustained is reversible when treated early but becomes permanent when appropriate treatment is delayed by several months. Damage to nerves may cause loss of muscle function, leading to paralysis. It may also lead to sensation abnormalities or numbness, which may lead to additional infections, ulcerations, and joint deformities.

== Cause ==

=== &quot;M. leprae&quot; and &quot;M. lepromatosis&quot; ===
&quot;Mycobacterioum leprae&quot; and &quot;Mycobacterium lepromatosis&quot; are the mycobacteria that cause leprosy. &quot;M. lepromatosis&quot; is a relatively newly identified mycobacterium isolated from a fatal case of diffuse lepromatous leprosy in 2008. &quot;M. lepromatosis&quot; is indistinguishable clinically from &quot;M. leprae&quot;. &quot;M. leprae&quot; is an aerobic, rod-shaped, acid-fast bacterium with a waxy cell envelope characteristic of the genus &quot;Mycobacterium&quot;. &quot;M. leprae&quot; and &quot;M. lepromatosis&quot; are obligate intracellular pathogens and cannot grow or be cultured outside of host tissues. However, they can be grown using research animals such as mice and armadillos.

Naturally occurring infections have been reported in nonhuman primates (including the African chimpanzee, the sooty mangabey, and the cynomolgus macaque), armadillos, and red squirrels. Multilocus sequence typing of the armadillo &quot;M. leprae&quot; strains suggests that they were of human origin for at most a few hundred years. Thus, it is suspected that armadillos first acquired the organism incidentally from early European explorers of the Americas. This incidental transmission was sustained in the armadillo population, and it may be transmitted back to humans, making leprosy a zoonotic disease (spread between humans and animals).

Red squirrels (&quot;Sciurus vulgaris&quot;), a threatened species in Great Britain, were found to carry leprosy in November 2016. It has been suggested that the trade in red squirrel fur, highly prized in the medieval period and intensively traded, may have been responsible for the leprosy epidemic in medieval Europe. A pre-Norman era skull excavated in Hoxne, Suffolk, in 2017 was found to carry DNA from a strain of &quot;M. leprae&quot; which closely matched the strain carried by modern red squirrels on Brownsea Island.

=== Risk factors ===
The greatest risk factor for developing leprosy is contact with another person infected by leprosy. People who are exposed to a person who has leprosy are 5–8 times more likely to develop leprosy than members of the general population. Leprosy occurs more commonly among those living in poverty. Not all people who are infected with &quot;M. leprae&quot; develop symptoms.

Conditions that reduce immune function, such as malnutrition, other illnesses, or genetic mutations, may increase the risk of developing leprosy. Infection with HIV does not appear to increase the risk of developing leprosy. Certain genetic factors in the person exposed have been associated with developing lepromatous or tuberculoid leprosy.

=== Transmission ===
Transmission of leprosy occurs during close contact with those who are infected. Transmission of leprosy is through the upper respiratory tract. Older research suggested the skin as the main route of transmission, but research has increasingly favored the respiratory route. Transmission occurs through inhalation of bacilli present in upper airway secretion.

Leprosy is not sexually transmitted and is not spread through pregnancy to the unborn child. The majority (95%) of people who are exposed to &quot;M. leprae&quot; do not develop leprosy; casual contact such as shaking hands and sitting next to someone with leprosy does not lead to transmission. People are considered non-infectious 72 hours after starting appropriate multi-drug therapy. Two exit routes of &quot;M. leprae&quot; from the human body that are often described are the skin and the nasal mucosa, although their relative importance is not clear. Lepromatous cases show large numbers of organisms deep in the dermis, but whether they reach the skin surface in sufficient numbers is doubtful. Leprosy may also be transmitted to humans by armadillos, although the mechanism is not fully understood.

=== Genetics ===

Not all people infected or exposed to &quot;M. leprae&quot; develop leprosy, and genetic factors are suspected to play a role in susceptibility to an infection. Cases of leprosy often cluster in families, and several genetic variants have been identified. In many who are exposed, the immune system can eliminate the leprosy bacteria during the early infection stage before severe symptoms develop. A genetic defect in cell-mediated immunity may cause a person to be susceptible to develop leprosy symptoms after exposure to the bacteria. The region of DNA responsible for this variability is also involved in Parkinson&#x27;s disease, giving rise to current speculation that the two disorders may be linked at the biochemical level.

== Mechanism ==
Most leprosy complications are the result of nerve damage. The nerve damage occurs from direct invasion by the &quot;M. leprae&quot; bacteria and a person&#x27;s immune response resulting in inflammation. The molecular mechanism underlying how &quot;M. leprae&quot; produces the symptoms of leprosy is not clear, but &quot;M. leprae&quot; has been shown to bind to Schwann cells, which may lead to nerve injury including demyelination and a loss of nerve function (specifically a loss of axonal conductance). Numerous molecular mechanisms have been associated with this nerve damage including the presence of a laminin-binding protein and the glycoconjugate (PGL-1) on the surface of &quot;M. leprae&quot; that can bind to laminin on peripheral nerves.

As part of the human immune response, white blood cell-derived macrophages may engulf &quot;M. leprae&quot; by phagocytosis. In the initial stages, small sensory and autonomic nerve fibers in the skin of a person with leprosy are damaged. This damage usually results in hair loss to the area, a loss of the ability to sweat, and numbness (decreased ability to detect sensations such as temperature and touch). Further peripheral nerve damage may result in skin dryness, more numbness, and muscle weaknesses or paralysis in the area affected. The skin can crack and if the skin injuries are not carefully cared for, there is a risk for a secondary infection that can lead to more severe damage.

== Diagnosis ==

In countries where people are frequently infected, a person is considered to have leprosy if they have one of the following two signs:
* Skin lesion consistent with leprosy and with definite sensory loss.
* Positive skin smears.

Skin lesions can be single or many, and usually hypopigmented, although occasionally reddish or copper-colored. The lesions may be flat (macules), raised (papules), or solid elevated areas (nodular). Experiencing sensory loss at the skin lesion is a feature that can help determine if the lesion is caused by leprosy or by another disorder such as tinea versicolor. Thickened nerves are associated with leprosy and can be accompanied by loss of sensation or muscle weakness, but muscle weakness without the characteristic skin lesion and sensory loss is not considered a reliable sign of leprosy. In some cases, the presence of acid-fast leprosy bacilli in skin smears is considered diagnostic; however, the diagnosis is typically made without laboratory tests, based on symptoms. If a person has a new leprosy diagnosis and already has a visible disability caused by leprosy, the diagnosis is considered late.

In countries or areas where leprosy is uncommon, such as the United States, diagnosis of leprosy is often delayed because healthcare providers are unaware of leprosy and its symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment prevent nerve involvement, the hallmark of leprosy, and the disability it causes. There is no recommended test to diagnose latent leprosy in people without symptoms. Few people with latent leprosy test positive for anti PGL-1. The presence of &quot;M. leprae&quot; bacterial DNA can be identified using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based technique. This molecular test alone is not sufficient to diagnose a person, but this approach may be used to identify someone who is at high risk of developing or transmitting leprosy such as those with few lesions or an atypical clinical presentation. New approaches propose tools to diagnose leprosy through artificial intelligence.

=== Classification ===
Several different approaches for classifying leprosy exist. There are similarities between the classification approaches.
* The World Health Organization (WHO) system distinguishes patients with 5 or fewer skin lesions and no bacilli in a skin smear as &quot;paucibacillary&quot; (&quot;-&quot; refers to a small quantity) from patients with more lesions or detected bacilli as &quot;multibacillary&quot;. 
* The Ridley-Jopling scale provides five gradations.
* The ICD-10, though developed by the WHO, uses Ridley-Jopling and not the WHO system. It also adds an indeterminate (&quot;I&quot;) entry.
* In MeSH, three groupings are used.

Leprosy may also occur with only neural involvement, without skin lesions.

== Complications ==
Leprosy may cause the victim to lose limbs and digits but not directly. &quot;M. leprae&quot; attacks nerve endings and destroys the body&#x27;s ability to feel pain and injury. Without feeling pain, people with leprosy have an increased risk of injuring themselves. Injuries become infected and result in tissue loss. Fingers, toes, and limbs become shortened and deformed as the tissue is absorbed into the body.

== Prevention ==
Early disease detection is important, since physical and neurological damage may be irreversible even if cured. Medications can decrease the risk of those living with people who have leprosy from acquiring the disease and likely those with whom people with leprosy come into contact outside the home. The WHO recommends that preventive medicine be given to people who are in close contact with someone who has leprosy. The suggested preventive treatment is a single dose of rifampicin in adults and children over 2 years old who do not already have leprosy or tuberculosis. Preventive treatment is associated with a 57% reduction in infections within 2 years and a 30% reduction in infections within 6 years.

The Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) vaccine offers a variable amount of protection against leprosy in addition to its closely related target of tuberculosis. It appears to be 26% to 41% effective (based on controlled trials) and about 60% effective based on observational studies with two doses possibly working better than one. The WHO concluded in 2018 that the BCG vaccine at birth reduces leprosy risk and is recommended in countries with high incidence of TB and people who have leprosy. People living in the same home as a person with leprosy are suggested to take a BCG booster which may improve their immunity by 56%. Development of a more effective vaccine is ongoing.

A novel vaccine called LepVax entered clinical trials in 2017 with the first encouraging results reported on 24 participants published in 2020. If successful, this would be the first leprosy-specific vaccine available.

== Treatment ==

Several leprostatic agents are available for treatment. A three-drug regimen of rifampicin, dapsone, and clofazimine is recommended for all people with leprosy, for six months for paucibacillary leprosy and 12 months for multibacillary leprosy. Multidrug therapy (MDT) remains highly effective, and people are no longer infectious after the first monthly dose. MDT is safe and easy to use under field conditions because it is available in calendar-labelled blister packs. The treatment does pose compliance challenges for young children who find shallowing multiple solid pills difficult. Post-treatment relapse rates remain low. 

The combination treatment accelerates treatment and increases the chance creating a drug resistant bacteria. All three drugs in the three-drug regimen are antibacterial, with rifampicin being the most potent. Rifampicin is scheduled monthly since it interferes with dapsone by inducing its increased metabolism. 

Resistance to the three-drug regimen has been reported in several countries, although the number of cases is small. People with rifampicin-resistant leprosy may be treated with second-line medications such as fluoroquinolones, minocycline, or clarithromycin, but the treatment duration is 24 months because of their lower bactericidal activity. Evidence on the potential benefits and harms of alternative regimens for drug-resistant leprosy is not available.

For people with nerve damage, protective footwear may help prevent ulcers and secondary infection. Canvas shoes may be better than PVC boots. There may be no difference between double rocker shoes and below-knee plaster. Topical ketanserin seems to have a better effect on ulcer healing than clioquinol cream or zinc paste, but the evidence for this is weak. Phenytoin applied to the skin improves skin changes to a greater degree when compared to saline dressings.

== Outcomes ==
Although leprosy has been curable since the mid-20th century, left untreated it can cause permanent physical impairments and damage to a person&#x27;s nerves, skin, eyes, and limbs. Despite leprosy not being very infectious and having a low pathogenicity, there is still significant stigma and prejudice associated with the disease. Because of this stigma, leprosy can affect a person&#x27;s participation in social activities and may also affect the lives of their family and friends. People with leprosy are also at a higher risk for problems with their mental well-being. The social stigma may contribute to problems obtaining employment, financial difficulties, and social isolation. Efforts to reduce discrimination and reduce the stigma surrounding leprosy may help improve outcomes for people with leprosy.

== Epidemiology ==


In 2018, there were 208,619 new cases of leprosy recorded, a slight decrease from 2017. In 2015, 94% of the new leprosy cases were confined to 14 countries. India reported the greatest number of new cases (60% of reported cases), followed by Brazil (13%) and Indonesia (8%). Although the number of cases worldwide continues to fall, there are parts of the world where leprosy is more common, including Brazil, South Asia (India, Nepal, Bhutan), some parts of Africa (Tanzania, Madagascar, Mozambique), and the western Pacific. About 150 to 250 cases are diagnosed in the United States each year.

In the 1960s, there were tens of millions of leprosy cases recorded when the bacteria started to develop resistance to dapsone, the most common treatment option at the time. International (e.g., the WHO&#x27;s &quot;Global Strategy for Reducing Disease Burden Due to Leprosy&quot;) and national (e.g., the International Federation of Anti-Leprosy Associations) initiatives have reduced the total number and the number of new cases of the disease.

The number of new leprosy cases is difficult to measure and monitor because of leprosy&#x27;s long incubation period, delays in diagnosis after the onset of the disease, and lack of medical care in affected areas. The registered prevalence of the disease is used to determine disease burden. Registered prevalence is a useful proxy indicator of the disease burden, as it reflects the number of active leprosy cases diagnosed with the disease and receiving treatment with MDT at a given point in time. The prevalence rate is defined as the number of cases registered for MDT treatment among the population in which the cases have occurred, again at a given point in time.

== History ==

=== Historical distribution ===
Using comparative genomics, in 2005, geneticists traced the origins and worldwide distribution of leprosy from East Africa or the Near East along human migration routes. They found four strains of &quot;M. leprae&quot; with specific regional locations: Monot &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) determined that leprosy originated in East Africa or the Near East and traveled with humans along their migration routes, including those of trade in goods and slaves. The four strains of &quot;M. leprae&quot; are based in specific geographic regions where each predominantly occurs:
* strain 1 in Asia, the Pacific region, and East Africa;
* strain 2 in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nepal, north India, and New Caledonia;
* strain 3 in Europe, North Africa, and the Americas;
* strain 4 in West Africa and the Caribbean.

This confirms the spread of the disease along the migration, colonisation, and slave trade routes taken from East Africa to India, West Africa to the New World, and from Africa to Europe and vice versa.

Skeletal remains discovered in 2009 represent the oldest documented evidence for leprosy, dating to the 2nd millennium BC. Located at Balathal, Rajasthan, in northwest India, the discoverers suggest that if the disease did migrate from Africa to India during the 3rd millennium BC &quot;at a time when there was substantial interaction among the Indus Civilization, Mesopotamia, and Egypt, there needs to be additional skeletal and molecular evidence of leprosy in India and Africa to confirm the African origin of the disease&quot;. A proven human case was verified by DNA taken from the shrouded remains of a man discovered by researchers from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in a tomb in Akeldama, next to the Old City of Jerusalem dated by radiocarbon methods to the first half of the 1st century.

The oldest strains of leprosy known from Europe are from Great Chesterford in southeast England and date back to AD 415–545. These findings suggest a different path for the spread of leprosy, meaning it may have originated in western Eurasia. This study also indicates that there were more strains in Europe at the time than previously determined.

=== Discovery and scientific progress ===
Literary attestation of leprosy is unclear because of the ambiguity of many early sources, including the Indian Atharvaveda and Kausika Sutra, the Egyptian Ebers Papyrus, and the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s various sections regarding signs of impurity (&quot;tzaraath&quot;). Leprotic symptoms are attested in the Indian doctor Sushruta&#x27;s &quot;Compendium&quot;, originally dating to c. 600 BC but only surviving in emended texts no earlier than the 5th century BC. Symptoms consistent with leprosy were possibly described by Hippocrates in 460 BC. However, Hansen&#x27;s disease probably did not exist in Greece or the Middle East before the Common Era. In 1846, Francis Adams produced &quot;The Seven Books of Paulus Aegineta&quot; which included a commentary on all medical and surgical knowledge and descriptions and remedies to do with leprosy from the Romans, Greeks, and Arabs.

Leprosy did not exist in the Americas before colonization by modern Europeans nor did it exist in Polynesia until the middle of the 19th century. The causative agent of leprosy, &quot;M. leprae&quot;, was discovered by Gerhard Armauer Hansen in Norway in 1873, making it one of the first species of pathogenic bacteria identified.

=== Treatment ===
Chaulmoogra tree oil was used topically to manage Hansen&#x27;s disease for centuries. Chaulmoogra oil could not be taken orally without causing nausea or injected without forming an abscess. Leprosy was once believed to be highly contagious and was treated with mercury, as was syphilis, which was first described in 1530. Many early cases thought to be leprosy could actually have been syphilis. In 1915, Alice Ball, the first black woman to graduate from the University of Hawai&#x27;i with a masters in chemistry, discovered how to make the oil water soluble. This technique led to marked improvements in patients with Hansen&#x27;s disease who were treated in Hawai&#x27;i.

The first effective drug (promin) became available in the 1940s. In the 1950s, dapsone was introduced. The search for further effective antileprosy drugs led to the use of clofazimine and rifampicin in the 1960s and 1970s. Later, Indian scientist Shantaram Yawalkar and his colleagues formulated a combined therapy using rifampicin and dapsone, intended to mitigate bacterial resistance. Combining all three drugs was first recommended by the WHO in 1981. These three drugs are still used in the standard MDT regimens. Resistance has developed to initial treatment. Until the introduction of MDT in the early 1980s, leprosy could not be diagnosed and treated successfully within the community.

The importance of the nasal mucosa in the transmission of &quot;M. leprae&quot; was recognized as early as 1898 by Schäffer, in particular, that of the ulcerated mucosa. The mechanism of plantar ulceration in leprosy and its treatment was first described by Ernest W. Price.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;leprosy&quot; comes from the Greek word &quot;λέπος (lépos) – skin&quot; and &quot;λεπερός (leperós) – scaly man&quot;.

== Society and culture ==
=== Treatment cost ===
Between 1995 and 1999 the WHO, with the aid of the Nippon Foundation, supplied all endemic countries with free MDT in blister packs, channeled through ministries of health. This free provision was extended in 2000 and again in 2005, 2010, and 2015 with donations by the MDT manufacturer Novartis through the WHO. At the national level, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) affiliated with the national program will continue to be provided with an appropriate free supply.

=== Historical texts ===
Written accounts of leprosy date back thousands of years. Various skin diseases translated as leprosy appear in the ancient Indian text, the &quot;Atharava Veda&quot;, by 600 BC. Another Indian text, the &quot;Manusmriti&quot; (200 BC),  prohibit contact with those infected with the disease and make marriage to a person infected with leprosy punishable.

The Hebraic root tsara or tsaraath (צָרַע, – tsaw-rah&#x27; – to be struck with leprosy, to be leprous) and the Greek (λεπρός – lepros), are of broader classification than the more narrow use of the term related to Hansen&#x27;s Disease. Any progressive skin disease (a whitening or splotchy bleaching of the skin, raised manifestations of scales, scabs, infections, rashes, etc.) — as well as generalized molds and surface discoloration of any clothing, leather, or discoloration on walls or surfaces throughout homes — all came under the &quot;law of leprosy&quot; (Leviticus 14:54–57). Ancient sources such as the Talmud (Sifra 63) make clear that&quot; tzaraath&quot; refers to various types of lesions or stains associated with ritual impurity and occurring on cloth, leather, or houses, as well as skin. Traditional Judaism and Jewish rabbinical authorities, both historical and modern, emphasize that the &quot;tsaraath&quot; of Leviticus is a spiritual ailment with no direct relationship to Hansen&#x27;s disease or physical contagions. The relation of &quot;tsaraath&quot; to &quot;leprosy&quot; comes from translations of Hebrew Biblical texts into Greek and ensuing misconceptions.

All three Synoptic Gospels of the New Testament describe instances of Jesus healing people with leprosy (Matthew 8:1–4, Mark 1:40–45, and Luke 5:12–16). The Bible&#x27;s description of leprosy is congruous (if lacking detail) with the symptoms of modern leprosy, but the relationship between this disease, &quot;tzaraath&quot;, and Hansen&#x27;s disease has been disputed. The biblical perception that people with leprosy were unclean can be found in a passage from Leviticus 13:44–46. While this text defines the leper as impure, it does not explicitly make a moral judgement on those with leprosy. Some early Christians believed that those affected by leprosy were being punished by God for sinful behavior. Moral associations have persisted throughout history. In the 6th century Pope Gregory the Great and Isidore of Seville considered people with the disease to be heretics.

=== Middle Ages ===
The social perception of leprosy in the general population was mixed. On one hand, people feared getting infected with the disease and thought of people suspected of leprosy to be unclean, untrustworthy, and occasionally morally corrupt. On the other hand, Jesus&#x27; interaction with lepers, the writing of church leaders, and the Christian focus on charitable works led to viewing the lepers as &quot;chosen by God&quot; or seeing the disease as a means of obtaining access to heaven.

Early medieval understanding of leprosy was influenced by early Christian writers such as Gregory of Nazianzus and John Chrysostom, whose writings were later embraced by Byzantine and Latin writers. Gregory, for example, composed sermons urging Christians to assist victims of the disease, and he condemned pagans or Christians who justified rejecting lepers on the allegation that God had sent them the disease to punish them. As cases of leprosy increased in the Eastern Roman Empire, becoming a major health issue, the ecclesiastic leaders discussed how to assist those affected as well as how to change the attitude of society towards them. They also tried this by using the name &quot;holy disease&quot; instead of the commonly used &quot;elephant&#x27;s disease&quot; (elephantiasis), implying that God did not create this disease to punish people but to purify them for heaven. Although not always successful in persuading the public and a cure was never found by Greek medicians, they created an environment where victims could get palliative care and were never expressly banned from society, as sometimes happened in western Europe. Theodore Balsamon, a 12th-century jurist in Constantinople, noted that lepers were allowed to enter the same churches, cities, and assemblies that healthy people attended.

As the disease became more prevalent in western Europe in the 5th century, efforts began to set up permanent institutions to house and feed lepers. These efforts were, inclusively, the work of bishops in France at the end of the sixth century, such as in Chalon-sur-Saône. The increase in hospitals or leprosaria (sing. leprosarium) that treated people with leprosy in the 12th and 13th century seems to indicate a rise in cases, possibly in connection with the increase in urbanisation as well as returning crusaders from the Middle East. France alone had nearly 2,000 leprosaria during this period. Additionally to the new leprosia, further steps were taken by secular and religious leaders to prevent further spread of the disease. The third Lateran Council of 1179 required lepers to have their own priests and churches and a 1346 edict by King Edward expelled lepers from city limits. Segregation from mainstream society became common, and people with leprosy were often required to wear clothing that identified them as such or carry a bell announcing their presence. As in the East, it was the Church who took care of the lepers due to the persisting moral stigma and who ran the leprosaria. Although the leprosaria in Western Europe removed the sick from society, they were never a place to quarantine them or from which they could not leave: lepers would go beg for alms for the upkeep of the leprosaria or meet with their families.

Multiple groups in Western Europe from the Middle Ages faced social ostracization and discrimination that was justified, in part, due to claims that they were the descendants of lepers. These groups included the Cagots and the Caquins.

=== 19th century ===
Norway was the location of a progressive stance on leprosy tracking and treatment and played an influential role in European understanding of the disease. In 1832, Dr. JJ Hjort conducted the first leprosy survey, thus establishing a basis for epidemiological surveys. Subsequent surveys resulted in the establishment of a national leprosy registry to study the causes of leprosy and to track the rate of infection. Early leprosy research throughout Europe was conducted by Norwegian scientists Daniel Cornelius Danielssen and Carl Wilhelm Boeck. Their work resulted in the establishment of the National Leprosy Research and Treatment Center. Danielssen and Boeck believed the cause of leprosy transmission was hereditary. This stance was influential in advocating for the isolation of those infected by sex to prevent reproduction.

Though leprosy rates were on the decline in the Western world by the 1860s, authorities frequently embraced isolation treatment due to a combination of reasons, including fears of the disease spreading from the Global South, efforts by Christian missionaries and a lack of understanding concerning bacteriology, medical diagnosis and how contagious the disease was. The rapid expansion of Western imperialism during the Victorian era resulted in westerners coming into increasing contact with regions where the disease was endemic, including British India. English surgeon Henry Vandyke Carter observed isolation treatment for leprosy patients first-hand while visiting Norway, applying these methods in British India with the financial and logistical assistance of Protestant missionaries. Colonialist and religious viewpoints of the disease continued to be a major factor in the treatment and public perception of the disease in the Global South until decolonization in the mid-20th century.

=== 20th and 21st century ===
In 1898, the colonial government in British India enacted the Leprosy Act of 1898, which mandated the compulsory segregation of people with leprosy by authorities in newly established leper asylums, where they were segregated by sex to prevent sexual activity. The act, which proved difficult to enforce, was repealed in 1983 by the Indian government after MDT had become widely available in India. In 1983, the National Leprosy Elimination Programme, previously the National Leprosy Control Programme, changed its methods from surveillance to the treatment of people with leprosy. India still accounts for over half of the global disease burden. According to WHO, new cases in India during 2019 diminished to 114,451 patients (57% of the world&#x27;s total new cases). Until 2019, Indians could justify a petition for divorce with their spouse&#x27;s diagnosis of leprosy.

The National Leprosarium at Carville, Louisiana, known in 1955 as the Louisiana Leper Home, was the only leprosy hospital in the mainland United States. Leprosy patients from all over the United States were sent to Carville to be kept in isolation away from the public, as not much about leprosy transmission was known at the time and stigma against those with leprosy was high. The Carville leprosarium was known for its innovations in reconstructive surgery for those with leprosy. In 1941, 22 patients at Carville underwent trials for a new drug called promin. The results were described as miraculous, and soon after the success of promin came dapsone, a medicine even more effective in the fight against leprosy. Leprosy incidence peaked in the United States in 1983, followed by a steep decline. However, case numbers have been slowly rising again since 2000. In 2020, 159 cases were reported in the country.

=== Stigma ===
Despite now effective treatment and education efforts, leprosy stigma continues to be problematic in developing countries where the disease is common. Leprosy is most common amongst impoverished populations where social stigma is likely to be compounded by poverty. Fears of ostracism, loss of employment, or expulsion from family and society may contribute to a delayed diagnosis and treatment.

Folk beliefs, lack of education, and religious connotations of the disease continue to influence social perceptions of those affected in many parts of the world. In Brazil, for example, folklore holds that leprosy is a disease transmitted by dogs, or that it is associated with sexual promiscuity, or that it is a punishment for sins or moral transgressions (distinct from other diseases and misfortunes, which are in general thought of as being according to the will of God). Socioeconomic factors also have a direct impact. Lower-class domestic workers who are often employed by those in a higher socioeconomic class may find their employment in jeopardy as physical manifestations of the disease become apparent. Skin discoloration and darker pigmentation resulting from the disease also have social repercussions.

In extreme cases in northern India, leprosy is equated with an &quot;untouchable&quot; status that &quot;often persists long after individuals with leprosy have been cured of the disease, creating lifelong prospects of divorce, eviction, loss of employment, and ostracism from family and social networks.&quot;

== Public policy ==

A goal of the WHO is to &quot;eliminate leprosy,&quot; and in 2016 the organization launched &quot;Global Leprosy Strategy 2016–2020: Accelerating towards a leprosy-free world&quot;. Elimination of leprosy is defined as &quot;reducing the proportion of (people with) leprosy in the community to very low levels, specifically to below one case per 10,000 population&quot;. Diagnosis and treatment with multidrug therapy are effective, and a 45% decline in disease burden has occurred since MDT has become more widely available. The organization emphasizes the importance of fully integrating leprosy treatment into public health services, effective diagnosis and treatment, and access to information. The approach includes supporting an increase in health care professionals who understand the disease, and a coordinated and renewed political commitment that includes coordination between countries and improvements in the methodology for collecting and analysing data.

Interventions include:

* Early detection of cases focusing on children to reduce transmission and disabilities.
* Enhanced healthcare services and improved access for people who may be marginalized.
* For countries where leprosy is endemic, further interventions include an improved screening of close contacts, improved treatment regimens, and interventions to reduce stigma and discrimination against people who have leprosy.

In some instances in India, community-based rehabilitation is embraced by local governments and NGOs alike. Often, the identity cultivated by a community environment is preferable to reintegration, and models of self-management and collective agency independent of NGOs and government support have been desirable and successful.

==Notable cases==

* Josephine Cafrine of Seychelles (1877–1907) had leprosy from age 12 and kept a journal that documented her struggles and suffering. It was published as an autobiography in 1923.
* Saint Damien De Veuster (1840–1889), a Catholic priest from Belgium, contracted leprosy and ministered to lepers who had been placed under a government-sanctioned medical quarantine on Molokai in the Kingdom of Hawaii.
* Baldwin IV of Jerusalem (1161–1185), Catholic king of Latin Jerusalem, had leprosy.
*Ingeborg Grytten ( – after 1705), Norwegian writer whose leprosy is thought to have influenced her poetry, which is characterized by a strong religious faith in God&#x27;s salvation.
*Josefina Guerrero (1917–1996), Filipino World War II spy who used the Japanese fear of her leprosy to listen to their battle plans and deliver the information to the American forces under Douglas MacArthur.
* King Henry IV of England () possibly had leprosy.
* Vietnamese poet Hàn Mặc Tử (1912–1940)
* Ōtani Yoshitsugu (1558 or 1565–1600), a Japanese &quot;daimyō&quot; (feudal lord).

== Infection of animals ==
Between 15 and 20% of nine-banded armadillos (&quot;Dasypus novemcinctus&quot;) in the south-central United States carry &quot;M. leprae&quot;. As a result of their low body temperature their tissues commonly contain massive numbers of organisms which helps in the dissemination of the infection. Armadillos were first demonstrated in 1971 to develop leprosy after inoculation with &quot;M. leprae&quot;. Because of armadillos&#x27; armor, skin lesions are difficult to ascertain. Abrasions around the eyes, nose, and feet are the most common signs. Infected armadillos make up a large reservoir of &quot;M. leprae&quot; and may be a source of infection for some humans in the United States or other locations in the armadillos&#x27; home range. In armadillo leprosy, lesions do not persist at the site of entry in animals; &quot;M. leprae&quot; multiply in macrophages at the site of inoculation and lymph nodes.

Armadillos have been used in immunological research to fight leprosy. Some notable reagents include recombinant interleukin-2 and recombinant interferon-gamma reagents. Additionally, they have been key and have been useful models of leprosy for studies regarding neuropathy. In clinical procedures such as electrophysiological nerve conduction tests Armadillo&#x27;s nerve function has been properly assessed. Despite the studies mentioned regarding Armadillo&#x27;s relationship to neuropathy and other effects of leprosy, there is still a lack of proper study on armadillos, and in conducting more armadillo-specific regents our understanding of leprosy’s effects on armadillos and possible humans can be found. Armadillos are a key component of modern-day research on leprosy.

There is a stigma surrounding armadillos and the carrying of leprosy. Because many people do not understand armadillos very well it is common for people to think of them as being dangerous to society and as a result valuing their lives less than other animals. It has become more common in parts of America for people to eat raw or undercooked armadillo, making the chances high that if not properly handled with care, one may become infected.

An outbreak in chimpanzees in West Africa is showing that the bacteria can infect another species and also possibly have additional rodent hosts. Studies have demonstrated that the disease is endemic in the UK red Eurasian squirrel population, with &quot;M. leprae&quot; and &quot;M. lepromatosis&quot; appearing in different populations. The &quot;M. leprae&quot; strain discovered on Brownsea Island is equated to one thought to have died out in the human population in mediaeval times. Despite this, and speculation regarding past transmission through trade in squirrel furs, there does not seem to be a high risk of squirrel to human transmission from the wild population. Although leprosy continues to be diagnosed in immigrants to the UK, the last known human case of leprosy arising in the UK was recorded over 200 years ago.

It has been shown that leprosy can reprogram cells in mouse and armadillo models, similar to how induced pluripotent stem cells are generated by the transcription factors Myc, Oct3/4, Sox2, and Klf4. A notable study conducted by Charles Shepard used mice to find how leprosy, an infection that has a preference for cooler areas of the body, would work in a warm-blooded animal. This mice study helped further the understanding of how leprosy works in humans. This was called &quot;The Mouse Model.&quot; The main findings were that even in mice whose immune systems were severely impaired and at a perceived high risk of developing leprosy, the body was still in most cases able to fight off leprosy. The findings suggest that in mice, the body will use their body&#x27;s energy to fight leprosy. Using The Mouse Model Shepard was able to conduct new research regarding leprosy. This model can now be used as a tool to further study &quot;M. leprae&quot;. The Mouse Model takes a more easily accessible animal model to better understand this complex disease. There are a few other up-and-coming models for &quot;M. leprae&quot; including the use of other animals including but not limited to mammals, birds, and cold-blooded animals. These animals do not tend to give as great results as armadillos and mice as different animals have different levels of disease resistance.
