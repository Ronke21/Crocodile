<text>Michael Kenna (August 20, 1857 – October 9, 1946), also known as &quot;Hinky Dink&quot;, was an American politician who served as alderman from Chicago&#x27;s 1st ward from 1897 to 1923 and again from 1939 to 1943. In addition to his position as alderman he was committeeman of the 1st Ward for the Democratic Party from 1893 to 1944. Representing the Chicago Loop and later its environs in such capacities, he led what was often called the &quot;world&#x27;s richest ward&quot;. He and his partner, fellow 1st Ward alderman &quot;Bathhouse John&quot; Coughlin, controlled the ward for most of the first half of the 20th century.

A part of 1st Ward politics for more than 60 years, Kenna possessed great influence on the municipal affairs of Chicago, being able to make or break the prospects of Democratic candidates for the mayoralty. In large part with Kenna&#x27;s help Coughlin would serve as alderman from the ward for 46 years. Possessing such influence despite his short stature and unassuming presence, he and Coughlin constructed a political machine that would last for the better part of the 20th century.

Kenna was notoriously corrupt; he, Coughlin, and several other aldermen led what was known as the &quot;Gray Wolves&quot;, a group that attracted much scorn from reformers. He and Coughlin in particular were infamous across the nation and globe. Of particular note were his tactics involving bribing homeless people to vote as desired and performing voter fraud for his candidates. He was also intimate with several figures of organized crime in the city; he and Coughlin were known as the &quot;Lords of the Levee&quot; after the Levee vice district in the 1st Ward which provided them with the financial and political support of sex workers, pimps, tavern owners, and gamblers in exchange for protection from law enforcement.

==Early life==
Michael Kenna was born in the late 1850s to Catherine ( Ferrel) and John Kenna, both immigrants from County Cork. He was born at the corner of Polk and Sholto (modern-day Carpenter) streets at the edge of &quot;Connelly&#x27;s Patch&quot; on Chicago&#x27;s Near West Side. At age 10 he left school and began selling newspapers. At age 12, by then an orphan, he borrowed $50 from a barkeeper and purchased a newsstand at the corner of Monroe and Dearborn Streets. He was so successful that he was able to pay back the loan within a month, and would sell newspapers at the stand until 1877. According to legend, it was at this time that Kenna got the nickname &quot;Hinky Dink&quot; from &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; publisher Joseph Medill due to his small stature; as an adult he stood tall. Kenna variously professed ignorance of the nickname&#x27;s origin or claimed that it arose at &quot;th&#x27; old swimming hole.&quot; He was also known as &quot;the little fellow&quot;. In 1879 he moved to Leadville, Colorado, to work for a newspaper in the area, returning to Chicago in 1881.

==Political career==
===1st Ward===

At the close of the 19th century Chicago had a reputation of bad morals, central to which was the 1st Ward, home to a teeming vice district. It was also home to Chicago&#x27;s central business district, which would later be called &quot;the Loop&quot; after the looping elevated railroad trackage constructed in it in the late 1890s. Due to the presence of the Loop the 1st Ward was often known as the &quot;world&#x27;s richest&quot; ward, a fact which Coughlin would use to fire back at critics of his tenure. As the first half of the 20th century progressed the 1st Ward would expand southward to also encompass most of the surrounding Near South Side.

At the time of Kenna&#x27;s ascendancy the vice elements of the 1st Ward and throughout the city were protected by &quot;King Mike&quot; McDonald, who had lived in the city since the late 1850s and controlled its gambling since shortly thereafter, and was credited with first saying &quot;there&#x27;s a sucker born every minute.&quot; However, by 1890, his reign began to end and a power vacuum started developing.

Corruption was not uncommon in late 19th-century Chicago; aldermen would charge for licenses and infrastructural projects within their wards, a practice known as &quot;boodling&quot;. A group of aldermen including Kenna and Coughlin known as the &quot;Gray Wolves&quot; were particularly infamous for their propensities towards boodling. Supporters of the pair said that Kenna and Coughlin were unfairly targeted by the reformers and yet reelected by their constituents every election cycle.

===Early career===

Upon his return to Chicago Kenna opened a saloon on Clark Street known as the Workingman&#x27;s Exchange where he doled out meals to the indigent in exchange for votes. Above the Workingman&#x27;s Exchange was the Alaska Hotel, which could provide space for 300 men, and up to 600 during elections. By 1882 his saloon was a success and he was a fixture in the 1st Ward Democratic organization under Chesterfield Joe Mackin; his work in securing Grover Cleveland&#x27;s victory in the 1884 election led Mackin to make him captain of his precinct immediately prior to being imprisoned for fraud related to that election. It was at this time that Kenna first encountered John Coughlin, although the two would not become close friends for a while. Coughlin, who had in his early life served as a bathhouse masseur, was popularly known as &quot;Bathhouse John&quot; or &quot;The Bath&quot;. When Coughlin was first elected as alderman in 1892, Kenna helped the campaign as he normally would but did not make any extra effort. When Carter Harrison III ran for mayor in 1893, Kenna was to quick to support him while Coughlin was one of the last holdouts, straining relations between the two. However, Harrison&#x27;s betrayal of Kenna by prosecuting him for gambling just like others in the 1st Ward, as well as the rise of the detested rival Billy Skakel, led Kenna to reconsider an alliance with Coughlin as McDonald&#x27;s influence started to wane. In 1893, Kenna proposed an alliance which Coughlin readily accepted. Coughlin was the public face of the machine while Kenna would work in the background.

Kenna started the new organization by proposing that a defense fund be organized from protection money from brothel keepers and gamblers to legally defend members of the organization who got into trouble. From such fund two lawyers would be retained at $10,000 a year to represent organization members; Kenna and Coughlin themselves paid the initial $10,000. The future judge John R. Caverly, who would later preside over the trial of Leopold and Loeb, received his first fees from this fund.

For the special mayoral election triggered by Harrison&#x27;s assassination, Kenna and Coughlin broke with traditional Harrison supporters by supporting John Patrick Hopkins. Kenna is noted as a member of the Cook County Democratic Party Central Committee for the 1st Ward as of December 21, 1893, serving alongside John P. Leindecker. He succeeded James Walsh, who had been an alderman from the 10th ward from 1883 to 1885.

An early example of Kenna&#x27;s organizational skills was the 1894 aldermanic election. Coughlin was unanimously nominated as the Democratic nominee in what Lloyd Wendt and Herman Kogan would later call &quot;the briefest political convention in Chicago&#x27;s history&quot; and was reported by the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; as lasting &quot;only a few minutes as the delegates were in a hurry to get away to attend a prize fight.&quot; However, rival Billy Skakel, who specialized in offering and soliciting gambling on fraudulent stock quotations and hated Coughlin for allowing local Prince Hal Varnell to cut into his turf, formed his own Independent Democratic Party. Working with Sol van Praag, who had ambitions of his own to rule the 1st Ward, he ran as a rival to Coughlin for the race and was endorsed by such publications as &quot;Mixed Drinks: The Saloon Keepers&#x27; Journal&quot;. Fearing for his career despite Kenna&#x27;s insistence that he would win, Coughlin visited Hopkins, who unsuccessfully asked Skakel to withdraw from the race. Coughlin then presented a petition to get Skakel&#x27;s name removed from the ballot, which was initially accepted by the election board but would later be overturned by a local judge and backfire on Coughlin. Nevertheless, Kenna reassured Coughlin of victory and used his organizational skills to bribe the homeless with fifty cents, as much food as desired, and a place to stay for each voter. Kenna also suggested that Coughlin visit Hopkins once again and remind him of how the duo had helped him avoid scandal in a gas-boodling concern. After Hopkins once again pled with Skakel to withdraw to no avail, he ordered the police department in the 1st Ward to detain any Skakel supporters seen and to close any saloons supporting Skakel immediately at midnight. Kenna also recruited members of the Quincy Street gang to protect any voters of Coughlin, noting that the police would ignore any tactics used to that effect; in such efforts he preceded van Praag, who had had a similar idea, by a few hours. Coughlin would win the election with 2,671 votes while independent Republican J. Irving Pearce received 1,261 and Skakel received 1,046. The tactics used in the election received much scorn in the press, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writing that &quot;Bathhouse John&#x27;s election was secured by methods which would have disgraced even the worst river parishes of Louisiana&quot;, but neither Coughlin nor Kenna cared about such reception.

===Entry into City Council===
Van Praag and Skakel would get revenge when Kenna ran for alderman in 1895. Prior to the election, the City Council had passed an ordinance granting the dubious Ogden Gas Company the rights to manufacture, distribute, and sell gas for 50 years. The resultant Ogden Gas Scandal sparked an outrage in Chicagoans and would prove a disaster to the local Democratic party and especially Kenna&#x27;s aldermanic aspirations. Irked about the events of 1894, van Praag and Skakel backed the Republican candidate Francis P. Gleason in the race, and a few days before the election Kenna found much of his vote-getting money having been spent to get the Ogden Gas ordinance passed while van Praag had much money of his own. Kenna ended up losing to Gleason by 366 votes. The papers rejoiced in his defeat, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; writing him the following poem:

It was found after the election that van Praag and Skakel had aided Gleason by giving the local Republican party the names and addresses of hundreds of Kenna&#x27;s registered voters who were deceased or lived outside of the Ward; the Republicans then had the illegitimate names struck from the register.

The 1895 elections produced a Republican mayor and a Republican majority in the City Council, both of whom Charles Tyson Yerkes would fight in his efforts to construct rapid transit in the Loop during the Chicago Traction Wars. Kenna, recouping his forces in preparation for the 1897 race, saw that Coughlin could be of great use for Yerkes, and arranged for an alliance between him and rival 19th Ward alderman John Powers. However, Powers betrayed Coughlin by December, collaborating with Yerkes and the Republican majority to the exclusion of Coughlin and introducing most of Yerkes&#x27;s ordinances which by custom should have been introduced by Coughlin. Coughlin and Kenna took their revenge on Powers by defeating his bid for the chair of the Cook County Democratic Party Central Committee in favor of free silverite Tommy Gahan.

Kenna was successful in entering the City Council in 1897. That same year Carter Harrison IV would be elected mayor in large part due to Kenna&#x27;s organizational skills in the 1st Ward. Kenna repeated his tactics of paying the homeless for votes, much to the horror of the Republican-dominated Special Committee for the Detection and Prevention of Vote Frauds. Despite the best efforts of Republican Congressman William Lorimer to arrest those of dubious voter credentials, Kenna continued to attract homeless voters from other parts of the city. The Saturday before the election Harry G. Darrow, the proprietor of the new saloon The Bon Ton, issued an invitation for its grand opening, claiming that Kenna, Coughlin, and Harrison would be present. Coughlin came and socialized with the guests but Kenna and Harrison refused to come. Nevertheless, Kenna openly displayed his gambling affiliation in response to a condemnation to that effect by the reform-minded Municipal Voters&#x27; League (MVL), stating &quot;Sure, I associate with gamblers. Why shouldn&#x27;t I? I like a good game myself.&quot; Kenna defeated Gleason by 4,373 votes to 1,811 and took office on April 19.

Immediately upon assumption of office as a reward for his work for Harrison he was made Chairman of the Police committee, and was a member of the committees of Railroads; Gas, Oil, and Electricity; the Water Department; Elections; and Markets, which were considered among the best committees of the Council. Kenna made his introduction to the Council by quietly introducing an order for an ambulance division in the police department.

===Influence and notoriety===
After his election to the City Council Kenna&#x27;s organizational prowess became known nationwide, to the extent that Tammany Hall boss Richard Croker asked his help to get Robert Van Wyck elected as the Mayor of the new City of Greater New York. He succeeded, and Van Wyck won with a plurality of 86,000 votes. His notoriety extended across the globe; people from England came and wrote the book &quot;If Christ came to Chicago&quot;, lambasting several Chicago politicians and Kenna and Coughlin in particular.

In 1901 he and four other saloonkeepers were arrested for violating ordinances regarding saloon hours. The arrest came after deputy state health inspector Jacob Ball investigated the saloons in the 1st Ward and found almost 1,000 homeless people lodged in 18 saloons. The prosecutor in the case, Thomas F. Scully, was unprepared to prosecute the case and Kenna was acquitted by the jury, leading to Scully&#x27;s suspension for thirty days. A 1902 editorial on Coughlin referred to his &quot;sole claim to even political strength [as] rest[ing] on his being a parasitical partner&quot; of Kenna.

In the 1911 Chicago mayoral election Kenna backed Harrison, allowing him to get the Democratic nomination; when Democrats under the chieftain Roger Sullivan supported his opponent Charles Merriam in the general election, Kenna and the 1st Ward gave Harrison the margin of victory needed to win. Things would turn out differently in 1915 Scandal had befallen the duo with an exposé on the exploits of the Levee, leading to county judge John Owens&#x27;s insisting that Kenna and Coughlin be ejected from the Democratic committee. Harrison acquiesced to these demands, declaring that Kenna&#x27;s and Coughlin&#x27;s careers were finished unless they towed the line and supported his entire slate of candidates, including Owens. Angry about this turn of events, the two joined Sullivan in leading a rebellion against Harrison that several other Democrats would join, including Powers and the nascent Anton Cermak. In that same election he selected Scully as the candidate for county judge against Owens despite several red-light district leaders supporting the latter, and successfully worked hard to get him elected. Harrison was defeated in the 1915 mayoral primary by the Sullivan-backed candidate Robert M. Sweitzer, who lost the general election to William Hale Thompson, an avowed enemy of Kenna and Coughlin.

===Lord of the Levee===

The 1st Ward was home to a vice district known as &quot;the Levee&quot;, which was named for a nearby wharf and contained some of the best-known brothels in Chicago. Among the brothels in the area was the Everleigh Club owned by the eponymous Everleigh sisters who had arrived from Omaha. It was well known internationally for its opulence and sex workers to the point where it was a point of pride for many Chicagoans. The club, Kenna, and Coughlin were inexorably linked in the imagination of people around the world. It was an important source of protection money for the two aldermen; one of the sisters stated that she had paid Coughlin over $100,000 over the course of 12 years, and Kenna and Coughlin ended up collecting over $15 million in graft from the Levee.

After the events of 1895, Kenna and Coughlin were particularly conscious of the need for a cash flow to finance their endeavors. They were discussing ideas at the Workingmen&#x27;s Exchange shortly before Christmas when they stumbled on an idea. A party had been held annually for &quot;Lame Jimmy&quot;, a disabled musician in Carrie Watson&#x27;s establishment, since the late 1880s. These parties were initially held in what would become Freiberg&#x27;s Hall on east 22nd Street (modern-day Cermak Road), and were marked by joy and peace with policemen being honored guests. However, a confrontation between police officers at the 1895 event resulted in an outcry against the event and it was banned. Realizing the potential in such an event, Coughlin suggested that the duo revive it under their tutelage. Although Kenna was not particularly keen on the idea, he figured it was not worth the trouble to stop Coughlin from pursuing it.

What resulted was the First Ward Ball, an annual fundraiser which quickly exceeded the excesses of the Lame Jimmy parties. The inaugural ball was held at the 7th Regiment Armory. Known as Coughlin&#x27;s &quot;Derby&quot;, it continued to grow in the early 20th century. Its reputation grew such that public pressure forced Mayor Fred Busse to withhold its liquor license in 1909; an event was still held at the Coliseum, but only 3,000 people attended.

Upon his election as mayor in 1915, Thompson opened up the city to vice and liquor. However, it was clear that Thompson controlled these areas, and the duo&#x27;s rule over the ward remained insecure. In particular, Big Jim Colosimo, who was a trusted precinct captain, started to surpass Coughlin and Kenna and would soon take over representing the interests of vice. Within the ward the two were nevertheless safe as Thompson refused to challenge them directly, Colosimo remained on good enough terms with them, and the relief of vice obligations allowed them to concentrate on other matters. Both Kenna and Coughlin were present at Colosimo&#x27;s funeral in 1920.

===Prohibition===
After alcoholic beverages were prohibited in the United States in 1920, The Workingman&#x27;s Exchange had to close and Kenna ran a candy, sandwich, and cigar store in its place. In 1923 the Illinois General Assembly reduced the number of aldermen per ward from two to one, with the new Council to that effect taking office on April 16. Kenna, who never cared much for Council meetings, stepped aside to leave the alderman&#x27;s position of the 1st Ward to Coughlin. Coughlin would find that the legislation increased his voting power in the council, while Kenna stated that he was content in his cigar store, where he hung up pictures of friends and prominent figures in the 1st Ward.

The power of the duo began to diminish in the 1920s as mobsters such as Johnny Torrio and Al Capone began to take control of the ward. Capone, who had originally worked for Torrio, would fight his way to the top of the vice scene in the area, and throughout the city. Capone had no need for the two and could have removed them from politics if he wanted. However, Capone took a liking to them, having noticed their previous loyalty to both Colosimo and Torrio. This increased the stature of the pair as Capone had prestige in the politics of the time, and Kenna had a position in the Cook County Democratic Party equal to Cermak, who was the president of the Cook County Board of Commissioners and known as the &quot;Mayor of Cook County&quot;.

Cermak was elected mayor in 1931, and given that Capone had recently been convicted for tax evasion the duo hoped that from their ardent support of Cermak they could regain lost glory. However, Cermak turned out to spurn the old style of urban feudalism that had characterized their reign. Throughout the 1930s the new Democratic organization gave committeemen new powers but also subordinated them to the machine. It limited Coughlin&#x27;s voting power such that the MVL insisted that he had mellowed his record, to which Coughlin responded with indignation and Kenna jocularly suggested that Coughlin sue them. In the later years of Coughlin&#x27;s life Kenna prevented some of the younger members of the 1st Ward organization from attempting to take Coughlin&#x27;s aldermanic seat before his death.

===Return to City Council and later years===
Coughlin died of pneumonia on November 11, 1938. Kenna was elected unopposed to fill his vacancy in the following year&#x27;s aldermanic election. Coughlin&#x27;s death had caused a surge of factionalism within the 1st Ward, and Kenna was thought to be the best candidate to ensure peace. Rich and aging, he had no desire to return to the City Council but was assured that his involvement would be minimal. Three opponents initially tried to contest him, but all had withdrawn by February 9.

He received a special ovation at the inaugural ceremony of the new Council on April 12. He rarely spoke at Council meetings and would soon stop coming altogether, sending his orders of the Council via his secretary Joe Clark. At that point Kenna was a figurehead, being present for name value and with power being held by others within the 1st Ward. For the last ten years of his tenure &quot;de facto&quot; power of the 1st Ward was held by a gang run by Jack Guzik, who used Coughlin as a figurehead prior to his death and Kenna thereafter. Throughout this time the Democratic organization considered Clark as the acting committeeman.

Kenna declined reelection to the Council in 1943. Two candidates appeared to take his seat. John Budinger had previously been alderman of the then-4th ward from 1910 to 1912 and a County Commissioner, and had the backing of the Democratic organization. James McVittie was the owner of an electroplating business and had the endorsements of the Business Men&#x27;s Committee and Better Government Association. The contest was particularly aggressive; both candidates&#x27; petitions were contested in court, and McVittie accused Budinger of being falsely registered as a 1st Ward voter and actually living in Woodlawn, with the Business Men&#x27;s Committee threatening to challenge Budinger if he attempted to vote in the 1st Ward. Budinger overwhelmingly won the election in the first round with what McVittie&#x27;s supporters claimed were illegal and illegitimate tactics such as voter intimidation and took office April 9. Kenna stepped down as 1st Ward committeeman in 1944, effective April of that year. He endorsed Fred M. Morelli as his successor, and Morelli would be unopposed to succeed him as Democratic leader of the ward.

In 1943 historians Lloyd Wendt and Herman Kogan released the book &quot;Lords of the Levee&quot;, which concerns Coughlin and Kenna&#x27;s activities. During the research for the book the pair interviewed Kenna and relatives of Coughlin. Kenna, who had the book read to him by an assistant, complained that he does not appear in the first 20 pages.

==Personal life and death==
Kenna was a teetotaler. In his later years Kenna lived in hotels in the Loop. He died on October 9, 1946, at the Blackstone Hotel of diabetes and myocarditis.

Kenna was a millionaire at the time of his death. His heirs fought over his estate. Although Kenna left his heirs $33,000 to be used to erect a mausoleum for his remains to repose in, his heirs took all of the money and bought him an $85 tombstone instead.

==Legacy==
It was thought that after Kenna stepped down the 1st Ward would be moved south and the Loop would be divided across multiple wards. Upon redistricting in 1948, the 1st Ward was combined with the erstwhile &quot;Bloody 20th&quot; Ward across the Chicago River&#x27;s south branch. The 1st Ward committeemen of both parties resigned in favor of their counterparts of the old 20th Ward, largely due to the fact that the old 20th could have outvoted the old 1st. Nevertheless, the 1st Ward&#x27;s reputation would last long after Kenna&#x27;s death; by the 1980s it was well associated with organized crime. In 1991 allies of Mayor Richard M. Daley proposed, and the City Council approved, a redistricting that renumbered much of the 1st Ward as the 42nd Ward at the request of businesses in the area, who felt that the 1st Ward had gained too much of a negative connotation. the 42nd Ward alderman is Brendan Reilly and the 1st Ward alderman is Daniel La Spata.

The last surviving link to Kenna and Coughlin was Anthony C. Laurino, who served as an assistant precinct captain under their tutelage and would later serve as alderman of the 39th Ward from 1965 to 1994, dying in 1999. Laurino, who was known for dealing mainly in the matters of the 39th Ward rather than those across the city, expressed pride in his political practices and credited the two for teaching them to him.

David K. Fremon argues in his book &quot;Chicago Politics Ward by Ward&quot; that while Coughlin and Kenna &quot;are generally viewed as living cartoon characters[,]... both were astute men in their time. Were they to appear today [in 1988], they would probably have made their fortunes through law, insurance, or real estate[.]&quot; Reflecting on their tenure, reformer Paul Douglas noted:
A 2012 retrospective by NBC News Chicago ranked Kenna and Coughlin as the 3rd and 4th most corrupt public officials in Illinois history, behind Thompson and Illinois Secretary of State Paul Powell.

<text>Luise Adelgunde Victorie Gottsched ( Kulmus; 11 April 1713 – 26 June 1762) was a German poet, playwright, essayist, and translator, and is often considered one of the founders of modern German theatrical comedy.

==Biography==
She was born in Danzig (Gdańsk), Royal Prussia, region of Poland. She became acquainted with her husband, the poet and author Johann Christoph Gottsched, when she sent him some of her own works. He apparently was impressed, and a long correspondence eventually led to marriage. After marriage, Luise continued to write and publish, and was also her husband&#x27;s faithful helper in his literary labours. Her uncle was the anatomist Johann Adam Kulmus.

==Works==
She wrote several popular comedies, of which &quot;Das Testament&quot; is the best, and translated &quot;The Spectator&quot; (9 volumes, 1739–1743), Alexander Pope&#x27;s &quot;Rape of the Lock&quot; (1744) and other English and French works. After her death her husband edited her &quot;Sämtliche kleinere Gedichte&quot; with a memoir (1763).

<text>Robert Bernard Altman ( ; February 20, 1925 – November 20, 2006) was an American film director, screenwriter, and producer. He is considered an enduring figure from the New Hollywood era, known for directing subversive and satirical films with overlapping dialogue and ensemble casts. Over his career he received several awards including an Academy Honorary Award, two British Academy Film Awards, a Primetime Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award as well as nominations for seven competitive Academy Awards.

Altman was nominated for five Academy Awards for Best Director for the war comedy &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), the musical film &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), the Hollywood satire &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), the dark comedy &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), and the murder mystery &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001). He is also known for directing &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot; (1970), &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973), &quot;California Split&quot; (1974), &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; (1974), &quot;3 Women&quot; (1977), &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978), &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980), &quot;Secret Honor&quot; (1984), &quot;The Company&quot; (2003), and &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (2006).

Also known for his work on television, he directed the HBO political mockumentary miniseries &quot;Tanner &#x27;88&quot; (1988) for which he won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series. He also directed the HBO television film &quot;The Laundromat&quot; (1985). On stage, he directed the Broadway revival of the Ed Graczyk play &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot; (1981) and later the 1982 film of the same name. He directed the West End revival of Arthur Miller&#x27;s penultimate play &quot;Resurrection Blues&quot; (2006).

In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recognized Altman&#x27;s body of work with an Academy Honorary Award. He never won a competitive Oscar despite seven nominations. His films &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot;, &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; and &quot;Nashville&quot; have been selected for the United States National Film Registry. Altman is one of three filmmakers whose films have won the Golden Bear at Berlin, the Golden Lion at Venice, and the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes (the other two being Henri-Georges Clouzot and Michelangelo Antonioni).

== Early life ==
Altman was born on February 20, 1925, in Kansas City, Missouri, the son of Helen (née Matthews), a &quot;Mayflower&quot; descendant from Nebraska, and Bernard Clement Altman, a wealthy insurance salesman and amateur gambler who came from an upper-class family. Altman&#x27;s ancestry was German, English and Irish; his paternal grandfather, Frank Altman Sr., anglicized the spelling of the family name from &quot;Altmann&quot; to &quot;Altman&quot;. Altman had a Catholic upbringing, but he did not continue to follow or practice the religion as an adult, although he has been referred to as &quot;a sort of Catholic&quot; and a Catholic director. He was educated at Jesuit schools, including Rockhurst High School, in Kansas City. He graduated from Wentworth Military Academy in Lexington, Missouri in 1943.

Soon after graduation, Altman joined the United States Army Air Forces at the age of 18. During World War II, Altman flew more than 50 bombing missions as a co-pilot of a B-24 Liberator with the 307th Bomb Group in Borneo and the Dutch East Indies.
Upon his discharge in 1947, Altman moved to California. He worked in publicity for a company that had invented a tattooing machine to identify dogs. He entered filmmaking on a whim, selling a script to RKO for the 1948 picture &quot;Bodyguard&quot;, which he co-wrote with George W. George. Altman&#x27;s immediate success encouraged him to move to New York City, where he attempted to forge a career as a writer. Having enjoyed little success, he returned to Kansas City in 1949 and accepted a job as a director and writer of industrial films for the Calvin Company. Altman directed some 65 industrial films and documentaries for the Calvin Company. Through his early work on industrial films, Altman experimented with narrative technique and developed his characteristic use of overlapping dialogue. In February 2012, an early Calvin film directed by Altman, &quot;Modern Football&quot; (1951), was found by filmmaker Gary Huggins.

Altman also had a career directing plays and operas parallel to his film career. While Altman was employed by the Calvin Company, he began directing plays at the Resident Theatre of the Jewish Community Center. These plays allowed him to work with local actors, such as fellow future director Richard C. Sarafian, whom he directed in a production of Richard Harrity&#x27;s &quot;Hope Is the Thing with Feathers&quot;. Sarafian would later marry Altman&#x27;s sister and follow him to Hollywood.

== Career ==
===1957–1969: Directorial debut and early work===
Altman&#x27;s first forays into television directing were on the DuMont drama series &quot;Pulse of the City&quot; (1953–1954), and an episode of the 1956 western series &quot;The Sheriff of Cochise&quot;. In 1956, he was hired by a local businessman to write and direct a feature film in Kansas City on juvenile delinquency. The film, titled &quot;The Delinquents&quot;, made for $60,000, was purchased by United Artists for $150,000, and released in 1957. While primitive, this teen exploitation film contained the foundations of Altman&#x27;s later work in its use of casual, naturalistic dialogue. With its success, Altman moved from Kansas City to California for the last time. He co-directed &quot;The James Dean Story&quot; (1957), a documentary rushed into theaters to capitalize on the actor&#x27;s recent death and marketed to his emerging cult following. Both works caught the attention of Alfred Hitchcock who hired Altman as a director for his CBS anthology series &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;. After just two episodes, Altman resigned due to differences with a producer, but this exposure enabled him to forge a successful television career. Over the next decade Altman worked prolifically in television (and almost exclusively in series dramas) directing multiple episodes of &quot;Whirlybirds&quot;, &quot;The Millionaire&quot;, &quot;U.S. Marshal&quot;, &quot;The Troubleshooters&quot;, &quot;The Roaring 20s&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Bus Stop&quot;, &quot;Kraft Mystery Theater&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, as well as single episodes of several other notable series including &quot;Hawaiian Eye&quot;, &quot;Maverick&quot; (the fourth season episode &quot;Bolt From the Blue&quot; also written by Altman and starring Roger Moore), &quot;Lawman&quot;, &quot;Surfside 6&quot;, &quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, and &quot;Route 66&quot;.

By the 1960s, Altman established himself as a television director due to his ability to work quickly and efficiently on a limited budget. Though he was frequently fired from television projects for refusing to conform to network mandates, Altman always was able to land new assignments. In 1964, the producers decided to expand &quot;Once Upon a Savage Night&quot;, one of his episodes of &quot;Kraft Suspense Theatre&quot;, for release as a television film under the title &quot;Nightmare in Chicago&quot;. In a 1963 episode, &quot;The Hunt&quot;, his cast included James Caan and Bruce Dern.

Two years later, Altman was hired to direct the low-budget space travel feature &quot;Countdown&quot;, but was fired within days of the project&#x27;s conclusion because he had refused to edit the film to a manageable length. He worked with Caan again, who led the cast with Robert Duvall. He did not direct another film until &quot;That Cold Day in the Park&quot; (1969), which was a critical and box-office disaster. During the decade, Altman began to express political subtexts within his works. In particular, he expressed anti-war sentiments regarding the Vietnam War. Because of this, Altman&#x27;s career would somewhat suffer as he came to be associated with the anti-war movement.

===1970–1979: Breakthrough and stardom ===
In 1969, Altman was offered the script for &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, an adaptation of a little-known Korean War-era novel satirizing life in the armed services; more than a dozen other filmmakers had passed on it. Altman had been hesitant to take the production, and the shoot was so tumultuous that Elliott Gould and Donald Sutherland tried to have Altman fired over his unorthodox filming methods. Nevertheless, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; was widely hailed as a classic upon its 1970 release. It won the at the 1970 Cannes Film Festival and netted five Academy Award nominations. It was Altman&#x27;s highest-grossing film, released during a time of increasing anti-war sentiment in the United States. The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; in 2000.

Now recognized as a major talent, Altman notched critical successes with &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), a revisionist Western in which the mordant songs of Leonard Cohen underscore a gritty vision of the American frontier; &quot;Images&quot;, his single, Bergman-inspired attempt at making a horror film; &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973), a controversial adaptation of the Raymond Chandler novel (scripted by Leigh Brackett) now ranked as a seminal influence on the neo-noir subgenre; &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; (1974), an adaptation of the Edward Anderson novel previously filmed by Nicholas Ray as &quot;They Live by Night&quot; (1949); &quot;California Split&quot; (1974), a gambling comedy-drama shot partially on location in Reno, Nevada; and &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), which had a strong political theme set against the world of country music. The stars of the film wrote their own songs; Keith Carradine won an Academy Award for the song &quot;I&#x27;m Easy&quot;. Altman&#x27;s next film, &quot;Buffalo Bill and the Indians, or Sitting Bull&#x27;s History Lesson&quot;, won the Golden Bear at the 28th Berlin International Film Festival.

Although his films were often met with divisive notices, and some, like &quot;A Perfect Couple&quot; and &quot;Quintet&quot; were widely panned, many of the prominent film critics of the era (including Pauline Kael, Vincent Canby and Roger Ebert) remained steadfastly loyal to his directorial style throughout the decade. Audiences took some time to appreciate his films, and he did not want to have to satisfy studio officials. In 1970, following the release of &quot;M*A*S*H,&quot; he founded Lion&#x27;s Gate Films to have independent production freedom. Altman&#x27;s company is not to be confused with the current Lionsgate, a Canada/U.S. entertainment company. The films he made through his company included &quot;Brewster McCloud&quot;, &quot;A Wedding&quot;, and &quot;3 Women&quot;.

=== 1980–1991: Career fluctuations ===

In 1980, he directed the musical film &quot;Popeye&quot;. Produced by Robert Evans and written by Jules Feiffer, the film was based on the comic strip / cartoon of the same name and starred Shelley Duvall and the comedian Robin Williams in his film debut. Designed as a vehicle to increase Altman&#x27;s commercial clout following a series of critically acclaimed but commercially unsuccessful low-budget films in the late 1970s (including &quot;3 Women&quot;, &quot;A Wedding&quot;, and &quot;Quintet&quot;), the production was filmed on location in Malta. It was soon beleaguered by heavy drug and alcohol use among most of the cast and crew, including the director; Altman reportedly clashed with Evans, Williams (who threatened to leave the film), and songwriter Harry Nilsson (who departed midway through the shoot, leaving Van Dyke Parks to finish the orchestrations). Although the film grossed $60 million worldwide on a $20 million budget and was the second highest-grossing film Altman had directed to that point, it failed to meet studio expectations and was considered a box office disappointment.

In 1981, the director sold Lion&#x27;s Gate to producer Jonathan Taplin after his political satire &quot;Health&quot; (shot in early 1979 for a Christmas release) was shelved by longtime distributor 20th Century Fox following tepid test and festival screenings throughout 1980. The departure of longtime Altman partisan Alan Ladd Jr. from Fox also played a decisive role in forestalling the release of the film.

Unable to secure major financing in the post-New Hollywood blockbuster era because of his mercurial reputation and the particularly tumultuous events surrounding the production of &quot;Popeye&quot;, Altman returned to television and theater between films. His first project after &quot;Popeye&quot; was &quot;2 by South&quot;, a double bill of plays by unknown playwright Frank South, &quot;Rattlesnake in a Cooler&quot; and &quot;Precious Blood&quot;. The production debuted in Los Angeles and transferred off-Broadway, before Altman adapted it as a pair of television films. Altman&#x27;s next project was to revive Ed Graczyk&#x27;s play, &quot;Come Back to the 5 &amp; Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;. Like &quot;2 by South&quot;, Altman adapted his production as a film. The film, which starred Cher, Karen Black, and Sandy Dennis, played at film festivals before its independent theatrical release; Altman turned down several distribution deals to keep the film under his control.

In 1982, after finishing work on &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot;, Altman travelled to Dallas to film his next film, &quot;Streamers&quot;. The film, adapted by David Rabe from his hit play, was shot in only 18 days. Its 1983 release made it Altman&#x27;s third theatrical adaptation in as many years. Afterwards, he began teaching a course on his films at the University of Michigan, where he concurrently staged his first production of Igor Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;. He also co-wrote John Anderson&#x27;s 1983 hit single &quot;Black Sheep&quot;.
After the critical success of his three successive theatrical adaptations, Altman attempted to return to Hollywood with the teen comedy &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot; (1985). Like &quot;Popeye&quot;, the chaotic production was characterized by tension between Altman and the studio, MGM. Altman travelled to Arizona to shoot away from the executives and the screenwriters, whom he banned from the set. There he shot the film in the summer of 1983, but poor test screenings, chaos within the studio, and changing ownership delayed the film&#x27;s release. It finally received a belated limited commercial release in 1987, four years after it was shot. The British Film Institute later referred to it as &quot;probably Altman&#x27;s least successful film&quot;.

While &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot; was shelved, Altman returned to theatrical adaptations and to the University of Michigan to film &quot;Secret Honor&quot;, using his students as crew members. Based on a one man-play about former president Richard Nixon, the film starred Philip Baker Hall as the ex-president. In 2008, the University of Michigan Library acquired Altman&#x27;s archive. Adapted by Altman and Sam Shepard for The Cannon Group from Shepard&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-nominated play, &quot;Fool for Love&quot; (1985) featured the playwright-actor alongside Kim Basinger, Harry Dean Stanton, and Randy Quaid; it fared better than most of his films from the era, earning $900,000 domestically on a $2 million budget and positive reviews from Roger Ebert and Vincent Canby.

Disappointed by his string of critical and commercial failures, including the still-unreleased &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot;, Altman moved to Paris. There, he shot another television film, &quot;The Laundromat&quot;, which he completed before &quot;Fool for Love&quot;. He then wrote and directed &quot;Beyond Therapy&quot;, which proved to be one of his biggest failures. Altman then mounted his second production of &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot;, this time at the prestigious Opéra de Lille. The Opéra was undergoing financial collapse at the time, and its failure to regain money through ambitious productions caused it close later that year. Altman also used a selection from Jean-Phillipe Rameau&#x27;s &quot;Les Boréades&quot; as the basis for his contribution to &quot;Aria&quot;, which was shown at the 1987 Cannes Film Festival to mixed reception. Altman made his next television film, &quot;Basements&quot;, based on two plays by Harold Pinter. Though Pinter wrote the screenplay himself, this film became the latest of Altman&#x27;s failures. The long-awaited release of &quot;O.C. and Stiggs&quot; that year was also panned.

Altman finally regained a modicum of critical favor in 1988 for his television work. He returned to America early that year to shoot the mockumentary show &quot;Tanner &#x27;88&quot; (1988), a collaboration with Garry Trudeau set in the milieu of a United States presidential campaign, for which he earned a Primetime Emmy Award. The series was shot on the actual campaign trail and featured several real candidates. During the show&#x27;s run, Altman&#x27;s television production of &quot;The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial&quot; aired. Though it received high acclaim, it would be his last television film. In 1990, Altman directed &quot;Vincent &amp; Theo&quot;, a biographical film about Vincent van Gogh that was intended as a television miniseries for broadcast in the United Kingdom. A theatrical version of the film was a modest success in the United States, marking a significant turning point in the director&#x27;s critical resurgence.

=== 1992–2006: Resurgence and final films ===

He revitalized his career in earnest with &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), a satire of Hollywood. Co-produced by the influential David Brown (&quot;The Sting&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Cocoon&quot;), the film was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Director. While he did not win the Oscar, he was awarded Best Director by the Cannes Film Festival, BAFTA, and the New York Film Critics Circle.

Altman then directed &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), an ambitious adaptation of several short stories by Raymond Carver, which portrayed the lives of various citizens of Los Angeles over the course of several days. The film&#x27;s large cast and intertwining of many different storylines were similar to his large-cast films of the 1970s; he won the Golden Lion at the 1993 Venice International Film Festival and another Oscar nomination for Best Director.

Between shooting and editing &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, Altman made his return to opera as the director and co-librettist of &quot;McTeague&quot;. Altman was hired on the project by William Bolcom, who had been commissioned with his regular librettist, Arnold Weinstein, to write an opera by the Lyric Opera of Chicago. Bolcom, a teacher at the University of Michigan, had admired Altman&#x27;s first production of &quot;The Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; a decade prior and asked him for help adapting Frank Norris&#x27;s novel. After finishing &quot;Short Cuts&quot;, Altman directed two episodes of &quot;Great Performances&quot;. The first was an R&amp;B revue; the second was a television adaptation of &quot;McTeague&quot;.

The rest of the 1990s saw limited success for Altman. His 1994 release &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; (also known as &quot;Ready to Wear&quot;) garnered significant pre-release publicity, but was a commercial and critical flop, though it got several nominations for year-end awards, including two Golden Globe nominations and won the National Board of Review award for Best Acting By An Ensemble. In 1996, Altman directed &quot;Kansas City&quot;, expressing his love of 1930s jazz through a complicated kidnapping story. Altman encouraged the film&#x27;s on-set musicians to improvise, and unused footage of their performances formed the basis for Altman&#x27;s third episode of &quot;Great Performances&quot;. However, the story received lukewarm-to-positive reviews, but made next to nothing at the box office, as did the 1998 legal thriller &quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot;. Though his 1997 anthology series &quot;Gun&quot; had a high-profile cast, it was cancelled after only six episodes.

He did close the decade on a high note, with 1999&#x27;s &quot;Cookie&#x27;s Fortune&quot;, a quirky black comedy about the suicide of a wealthy dowager, his first film in almost 6 years to make back its budget, and which earned him generally positive praise from critics. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1999. Though Altman&#x27;s first film of the new millennium, &quot;Dr. T &amp; the Women&quot;, received only moderate reviews and middling financial success. His next film, &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001), was included on many critics&#x27; lists of the ten best films of that year. A large-cast, British country house murder mystery, it won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay (Julian Fellowes) plus six more nominations, including two for Altman, as Best Director and Best Picture.
Altman returned to the stage twice more. In 2004 He reunited with Bolcom, Weinstein, and the Lyric Opera to adapt his 1978 film, &quot;A Wedding&quot;, as an opera. It was generally well received. His final stage production was poorly received. In 2006, Altman travelled to England to direct the West End debut of Arthur Miller&#x27;s final play, &quot;Resurrection Blues&quot; at the Old Vic Theatre. At this time, the Old Vic was managed by Kevin Spacey, and the production starred Maximilian Schell, James Fox, Neve Campbell, Matthew Modine, and Jane Adams. However, despite the pedigree of all involved, the production was an abject failure with poor reviews and behind-the-scenes bickering.

Working with independent studios such as the now-shuttered Fine Line, Artisan (which was absorbed into today&#x27;s Lionsgate), and USA Films (now Focus Features), gave Altman the edge in making the kinds of films he always wanted to make without studio interference. &quot;The Company&quot;, a film about the Joffrey Ballet in Chicago, featured a cast composed mainly of actual dancers. The film had been conceived by star Neve Campbell, an ex ballerina, and written by Altman&#x27;s longtime friend, Barbara Turner. Altman directed a follow-up to &quot;Tanner &#x27;88&quot; for the Sundance Channel, reuniting him with Michael Murphy as an older Jack Tanner. A film version of Garrison Keillor&#x27;s public radio series &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; was released in June 2006. Altman was still developing new projects up until his death, including a film based on &quot;Hands on a Hard Body: The Documentary&quot; (1997).

In 2006, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Altman an Academy Honorary Award for Lifetime Achievement. During his acceptance speech, he revealed that he had received a heart transplant approximately ten or eleven years earlier. The director then quipped that perhaps the academy had acted prematurely in recognizing the body of his work, as he felt like he might have four more decades of life ahead of him.

== Directing style and technique ==
Altman&#x27;s particular style of filmmaking covered many genres — referred to as &quot;Altmanesque&quot; — but usually with a &quot;subversive&quot; or &quot;anti-Hollywood&quot; twist which typically relied on satire and humor to express his personal views. Actors especially enjoyed working under his direction because he encouraged them to improvise. He preferred large ensemble casts for his films, and developed a multitrack recording technique which produced overlapping dialogue from multiple actors. This produced a more natural, more dynamic, and more complex experience for the viewer. He also used highly mobile camera work and zoom lenses to enhance the activity taking place on the screen. Critic Pauline Kael, writing about his directing style, said that Altman could &quot;make film fireworks out of next to nothing.&quot;

=== Maverick and auteur ===
Following his successful career in television, Altman began his new career in the film industry when he was in middle-age. He understood the creative limits imposed by the television medium, and now set out to direct and write films which would express his personal visions about American society and Hollywood. His films would later be described as &quot;auteuristic attacks&quot; and &quot;idiosyncratic variations&quot; of traditional films, typically using subtle comedy or satire as a way of expressing his observations.

His films were typically related to political, ideological, and personal subjects, and Altman was known for &quot;refusing to compromise his own artistic vision.&quot; He has been described as &quot;anti-Hollywood,&quot; often ignoring the social pressures that affected others in the industry, which made it more difficult for him to get many of his films seen. He said his independence as a filmmaker helped him overall:

&quot;Altman was a genuine movie maverick,&quot; states author Ian Freer, because he went against the commercial conformity of the film industry: &quot;He was the scourge of the film establishment, and his work generally cast an astute, scathing eye over the breadth of American culture, often exploding genres and character archetypes; Altman was fascinated by people with imperfections, people as they really are, not as the movies would have you believe.&quot; Director Alan Rudolph, during a special tribute to Altman, refers to his moviemaking style as &quot;Altmanesque.&quot;

With his independent style of directing, he developed a bad reputation among screenwriters and those on the business side of films. He admits, &quot;I have a bad reputation with writers, developed over the years: &#x27;Oh, he doesn&#x27;t do what you write, blah blah blah.&#x27; ... Ring Lardner was very pissed off with me,&quot; for not following his script. Nor did Altman get along well with studio heads, once punching an executive in the nose and knocking him into a swimming pool because he insisted he cut six minutes from a film he was working on.

His reputation among actors was better. With them, his independence sometimes extended to his choice of actors, often going against consensus. Cher, for instance, credits him for launching her career with both the stage play and film, &quot;Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean&quot; (1982). &quot;Without Bob I would have never had a film career. Everyone told him not to cast me. Everyone. ... Nobody would give me a break. I am convinced that Bob was the only one who was brave enough to do it.&quot; Others, like Julianne Moore, describes working with him:

Director Robert Dornhelm said Altman &quot;looked at film as a pure, artistic venue.&quot; With &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), for instance, the distributor &quot;begged him&quot; to cut a few minutes from the length, to keep it commercially viable: &quot;Bob just thought the antiChrist was trying to destroy his art. They were well-meaning people who wanted him to get what he deserved, which was a big commercial hit. But when it came down to the art or the money, he was with the art.&quot;

Sally Kellerman, noting Altman&#x27;s willful attitude, looked back with regret at giving up a chance to act in one of his films:

=== Themes and subjects ===
Unlike directors whose work fits within various film genres, such as Westerns, musicals, war films, or comedies, Altman&#x27;s work has been defined as more &quot;anti-genre&quot; by various critics. This is partly due to the satirical and comedy nature of many of his films. Geraldine Chaplin, daughter of Charlie Chaplin, compared the humor in his films to her father&#x27;s films:

Altman made it clear that he did not like &quot;storytelling&quot; in his films, contrary to the way most television and mainstream film are made. According to Altman biographer Mitchell Zuckoff, &quot;he disliked the word &#x27;story,&#x27; believing that a plot should be secondary to an exploration of pure (or, even better, impure) human behavior.&quot; Zuckoff describes the purposes underlying many of Altman&#x27;s films: &quot;He loved the chaotic nature of real life, with conflicting perspectives, surprising twists, unexplained actions, and ambiguous endings. He especially loved many voices, sometimes arguing, sometimes agreeing, ideally overlapping, a cocktail party or a street scene captured as he experienced it. Julianne Moore, after seeing some of his movies, credits Altman&#x27;s style of directing for her decision to become a film actress, rather than a stage actress:

Film author Charles Derry writes that Altman&#x27;s films &quot;characteristically contain perceptive observations, telling exchanges, and moments of crystal clear revelation of human folly.&quot; Because Altman was an astute observer of society and &quot;especially interested in people,&quot; notes Derry, many of his film characters had &quot;that sloppy imperfection associated with human beings as they are, with life as it is lived.&quot; As a result, his films are often an indirect critique of American society.

For many of Altman&#x27;s films, the satirical content is evident: &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), for example, is a satirical black comedy set during the Korean War; &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971) is a satire on Westerns; author Matthew Kennedy states that &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975) is a &quot;brilliant satire of America immediately prior to the Bicentennial&quot;; &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978) is a satire on American marriage rituals and hypocrisy; Altman himself said that &quot;The Player&quot; (1992) was &quot;a very mild satire&quot; about the Hollywood film industry, and Vincent Canby agreed, stating that &quot;as a satire, &quot;The Player&quot; tickles. It doesn&#x27;t draw blood.&quot; The satire of his films sometimes led to their failure at the box office if their satirical nature was not understood by the distributor. Altman blames the box office failure of &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973), a detective story, on the erroneous marketing of the film as a thriller:

Similarly, Altman also blames the failure of &quot;O.C. &amp; Stiggs&quot; on its being marketed as a typical &quot;teenage movie,&quot; rather than what he filmed it as, a &quot;satire of a teenage movie,&quot; he said.

=== Improvisation dialogue ===
Altman favored stories expressing the interrelationships among several characters, being more interested in character motivation than in intricate plots. He therefore tended to sketch out only a basic plot for the film, referring to the screenplay as a &quot;blueprint&quot; for action. By encouraging his actors to improvise dialogue, Altman thus became known as an &quot;actor&#x27;s director,&quot; a reputation that attracted many notable actors to work as part of his large casts. Performers enjoy working with Altman in part because &quot;he provides them with the freedom to develop their characters and often alter the script through improvisation and collaboration,&quot; notes Derry. Richard Baskin says that &quot;Bob was rather extraordinary in his way of letting people do what they did. He trusted you to do what you did and therefore you would kill for him.&quot;

 Geraldine Chaplin, who acted in &quot;Nashville&quot;, recalls one of her first rehearsal sessions:

Altman regularly let his actors develop a character through improvisation during rehearsal or sometimes during the actual filming. Such improvisation was uncommon in film due to the high cost of film production which requires careful planning, precise scripts, and rehearsal, before costly film was exposed. Nevertheless, Altman preferred to use improvisation as a tool for helping his actors develop their character. Altman said that &quot;once we start shooting it&#x27;s a very set thing. Improvisation is misunderstood. We don&#x27;t just turn people loose.&quot; Although he tried to avoid dictating an actor&#x27;s every move, preferring to let them be in control:

Carol Burnett remembers Altman admitting that many of the ideas in his films came from the actors. &quot;You never hear a director say that. That was truly an astonishing thing,&quot; she said. Others, such as Jennifer Jason Leigh, became creatively driven:

He liked working with many of the same performers, including Shelley Duvall and Bert Remsen (7 films each); Paul Dooley (6 films); Michael Murphy (5 films); Jeff Goldblum, Lily Tomlin, Lyle Lovett, Henry Gibson, David Arkin, and John Schuck (4 films each); Tim Robbins, Carol Burnett, Belita Moreno, Richard E. Grant, Geraldine Chaplin, Craig Richard Nelson, Sally Kellerman and Keith Carradine (3 films each). Krin Gabbard adds that Altman enjoyed using actors &quot;who flourish as improvisers,&quot; such as Elliott Gould, who starred in three of his films, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; and &quot;California Split&quot;. Gould recalls that when filming &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, his first acting job with Altman, he and costar Donald Sutherland didn&#x27;t think Altman knew what he was doing. He wrote years later, &quot;I think that in hindsight, Donald and I were two elitist, arrogant actors who really weren&#x27;t getting Altman&#x27;s genius.&quot; Others in the cast immediately appreciated Altman&#x27;s directing style. René Auberjonois explains:

Unlike television and traditional films, Altman also avoided &quot;conventional storytelling,&quot; and would opt for showing the &quot;busy confusion of real life,&quot; observes Albert Lindauer. Among the various techniques to achieve this effect, his films often include &quot;a profusion of sounds and images, by huge casts or crazy characters, multiple plots or no plots at all, ... and a reliance on improvisation.&quot; A few months before he died, Altman tried to summarize the motives behind his filmmaking style:

=== Sound techniques ===
Altman was one of the few filmmakers who &quot;paid full attention to the possibilities of sound&quot; when filming. He tried to replicate natural conversational sounds, even with large casts, by wiring hidden microphones to actors, then recording them talking over each other with multiple soundtracks. During the filming, he wore a headset to ensure that important dialogue could be heard, without emphasizing it. This produced a &quot;dense audio experience&quot; for viewers, allowing them to hear multiple scraps of dialogue, as if they were listening in on various private conversations. Altman recognized that although large casts hurt a film commercially, &quot;I like to see a lot of stuff going on.&quot;

Altman first used overlapping soundtracks in &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970), a sound technique which film author Michael Barson describes as &quot;a breathtaking innovation at the time.&quot; He developed it, Altman said, to force viewers to pay attention and become engaged in the film as if they were an active participant. According to some critics, one of the more extreme uses of the technique is in &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), also considered among his finest films.

Film historian/scholar Robert P. Kolker pointed out that the aural and visual simultaneity in Altman&#x27;s films was critical as that represented an emphasis on the plurality of events, which required viewers to become active spectators.

=== Ensemble casts ===
Overlapping dialogue among large groups of actors adds complexity to Altman&#x27;s films, and they were often criticized as appearing haphazard or disconnected on first viewing. Some of his critics changed their minds after seeing them again. British film critic David Thomson gave &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975) a bad review after watching it the first time, but later wrote, &quot;But going back to &quot;Nashville&quot; and some of the earlier films, ... made me reflect: It remains enigmatic how organized or purposeful &quot;Nashville&quot; is. ... The mosaic, or mix, permits a freedom and a human idiosyncrasy that Renoir might have admired.&quot; During the making of the film, the actors were inspired, and co-star Ronee Blakley was convinced of the film&#x27;s ultimate success:

Thomson later recognized those aspects as being part of Altman&#x27;s style, beginning with &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; (1970): &quot;&quot;MASH&quot; began to develop the crucial Altman style of overlapping, blurred sound and images so slippery with zoom that there was no sense of composition. That is what makes &quot;Nashville&quot; so absorbing.&quot; Altman explained that to him such overlapping dialogue in his films was closer to reality, especially with large groups: &quot;If you&#x27;ve got fourteen people at a dinner table, it seems to me it&#x27;s pretty unlikely that only two of them are going to be talking.&quot; Pauline Kael writes that Altman, &quot;the master of large ensembles, loose action, and overlapping voices, demonstrates that ... he can make film fireworks out of next to nothing.&quot;

=== Photography ===
Altman&#x27;s distinctive style of directing carried over into his preferences for camerawork. Among them was his use of widescreen compositions, intended to capture the many people or activities taking place on screen at the same time. For some films, such as &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot;, he created a powerful visual atmosphere with cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, such as scenes using fluid camerawork, zoom lenses, and a smoky effect using special fog filters. Director Stanley Kubrick told Altman that &quot;the camerawork was wonderful,&quot; and asked, &quot;How did you do it?&quot;

In &quot;Nashville&quot;, Altman used sets with noticeable colors of reds, whites and blues. For &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot;, he insisted that Zsigmond keep the camera mobile by mounting it to moving objects. Zsigmond states that Altman &quot;wanted to do something different&quot; in this film, and told him he &quot;wanted the camera to move — all the time. Up. down. In and out. Side to side.&quot; Cinematographer Roger Deakins, discussing his use of zoom lenses, commented, &quot;I would find it quite exciting to shoot a film with a zoom lens if it was that observational, roving kind of look that Robert Altman was known for. He&#x27;d put the camera on a jib arm and float across the scene and pick out these shots as he went along – quite a nice way of working.&quot;

Zsigmond also recalls that working with Altman was fun:

Vilmos Zsigmond&#x27;s cinematography in &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot; received a nomination by the British Academy Film Awards.

=== Music scores ===
When using music in his films, Altman was known to be highly selective, often choosing music that he personally liked. Director Paul Thomas Anderson, who worked with him, notes that &quot;Altman&#x27;s use of music is always important,&quot; adding, &quot;Bob loved his music, didn&#x27;t he? My God, he loved his music&quot;. Since he was a &quot;great fan&quot; of Leonard Cohen&#x27;s music, for example, saying he would &quot;just get stoned and play that stuff&quot; all the time he used three of his songs in &quot;McCabe and Mrs. Miller&quot; (1971), and another for the final scene in &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978).

For &quot;Nashville&quot; (1975), Altman had numerous new country music songs written by his cast to create a realistic atmosphere. He incorporated a &quot;hauntingly repeated melody&quot; in &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973), and employed Harry Nilsson and Van Dyke Parks to score &quot;Popeye&quot; (1980).

A number of music experts have written about Altman&#x27;s use of music, including Richard R. Ness, who wrote about the scores for many of Altman&#x27;s films in an article, considered to be a valuable resource for understanding Altman&#x27;s filmmaking technique. Similarly, cinema studies professor Krin Gabbard wrote an analysis of Altman&#x27;s use of jazz music in &quot;Short Cuts&quot; (1993), noting that few critics have considered the &quot;importance of the music&quot; in the film.

Jazz was also significant in &quot;Kansas City&quot; (1996). In that film, the music is considered to be the basis of the story. Altman states that &quot;the whole idea was not to be too specific about the story,&quot; but to have the film itself be &quot;rather a sort of jazz.&quot; Altman&#x27;s technique of making the theme of a film a form of music, was considered &quot;an experiment nobody has tried before,&quot; with Altman admitting it was risky. &quot;I didn&#x27;t know if it would work. ... If people &#x27;get it,&#x27; then they really tend to like it.&quot;

== Influence ==
Directors who are influenced by Altman include Paul Thomas Anderson, Wes Anderson, Judd Apatow, Richard Linklater, Alejandro González Iñárritu, Noah Baumbach, David Gordon Green, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the Safdie brothers, Harmony Korine, and Michael Winterbottom. Altman gave several directors, including Alan Rudolph, Reza Badiyi, and Richard C. Sarafian, their starts in filmmaking.

== Filmography ==

==Frequent collaborators==
Altman often cast certain actors in many of his films. Actors who have performed in his films 3 or more times in either lead, supporting or cameo roles include Michael Murphy (7), Shelley Duvall (7), Bert Remsen (7), Paul Dooley (6), Elliott Gould (5), Rene Auberjonois (5), Jeff Goldblum (4), Lily Tomlin (4), Lyle Lovett (4), Henry Gibson (4), David Arkin (4), John Schuck (4), Tim Robbins (3), Carol Burnett (3), Keith Carradine (3), Sally Kellerman (3), Geraldine Chaplin (3), Ann Ryerson (3), Belita Moreno (3), Richard E. Grant (3) and Craig Richard Nelson (3).

== Awards and honors ==
Altman received various awards and nominations including seven Academy Award nominations winning the Honorary Oscar in 2006. He received seven British Academy Film Award nominations winning twice for &quot;The Player&quot; (1992), and &quot;Gosford Park&quot; (2001). He received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Directing for a Drama Series for &quot;Tanner &#x27;88&quot; (1988). He also received five Golden Globe Award nominations winning the Golden Globe Award for Best Director for &quot;Gosford Park&quot;. He also received various awards from film festivals including the Cannes Film Festival&#x27;s prestigious Palme d&#x27;Or for &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and the Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director for &quot;The Player&quot;. He has also received the Berlin International Film Festival&#x27;s Golden Bear, and the Venice Film Festival&#x27;s Golden Lion. In 1994, he received the Directors Guild of America Lifetime Achievement Award.

== Personal life ==
=== Family ===
Altman was married three times: His first wife was LaVonne Elmer. They were married from 1947 to 1949, and had a daughter, Christine. His second wife was Lotus Corelli. They were married from 1950 to 1955, and had two sons, Michael and Stephen. At fifteen, Michael wrote the lyrics to &quot;Suicide Is Painless&quot;, the theme song to Altman&#x27;s film, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Stephen is a production designer who often worked with his father. Altman&#x27;s third wife was Kathryn Reed. They were married from 1957 until his death in 2006. They had two sons, Robert and Matthew. Altman became the stepfather to Konni Reed when he married Kathryn.

Kathryn Altman, who died in 2016, co-authored a book about Altman that was published in 2014. She had served as a consultant and narrator for the 2014 documentary &quot;Altman&quot;, and had spoken at many retrospective screenings of her husband&#x27;s films.

=== Homes ===
In the 1960s, Altman lived for years in Mandeville Canyon in Brentwood, California. He resided in Malibu throughout the 1970s, but sold that home and the Lion&#x27;s Gate production company in 1981. &quot;I had no choice&quot;, he told &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Nobody was answering the phone&quot; after the flop of &quot;Popeye&quot;. He moved his family and business headquarters to New York City, but eventually moved back to Malibu, where he lived until his death.

=== Political views ===
In November 2000, Altman claimed that he would move to Paris if George W. Bush were elected, but joked that he had meant Paris, Texas, when it came to pass. He noted that &quot;the state would be better off if he (Bush) is out of it.&quot; Altman was an outspoken marijuana user, and served as a member of the NORML advisory board. He was also an atheist and an anti-war activist. He was one of numerous public figures, including linguist Noam Chomsky and actress Susan Sarandon, who signed the &quot;Not in Our Name&quot; declaration opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Julian Fellowes believes that Altman&#x27;s anti-war and anti-Bush stance cost him the Best Director Oscar for &quot;Gosford Park&quot;.

Altman despised the television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; which followed his 1970 film, citing it as being the antithesis of what his movie was about, and citing its anti-war messages as being &quot;racist&quot;. In the 2001 DVD commentary for &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, he stated clearly the reasons for which he disapproved of the series.

== Death and legacy ==
Altman died from leukemia at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on November 20, 2006, at age 81.

Fellow film director Paul Thomas Anderson dedicated his 2007 film &quot;There Will Be Blood&quot; to Altman. Anderson had worked as a standby director on &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; for insurance purposes in the event the ailing 80-year-old Altman would be unable to finish shooting.

During a celebration tribute to Altman a few months after his death, he was described as a &quot;passionate filmmaker&quot; and auteur who rejected convention, creating what director Alan Rudolph called an &quot;Altmanesque&quot; style of films. He preferred large casts of actors and natural overlapping conversations, and encouraged his actors to improvise and express their innate creativity without fear of failing. Lily Tomlin compared him to &quot;a great benign patriarch who was always looking out for you as an actor,&quot; adding that &quot;you&#x27;re not afraid to take chances with him.&quot;
Many of his films are described as &quot;acid satires and counterculture character studies that redefined and reinvigorated modern cinema.&quot; Although his films spanned most film genres, such as Westerns, musicals, war films, or comedies, he was considered &quot;anti-genre,&quot; and his films were &quot;candidly subversive.&quot; He was known to hate the &quot;phoniness&quot; he saw in most mainstream films, and &quot;he wanted to explode them&quot; through satire.

Actor Tim Robbins, who starred in a number of Altman&#x27;s films, describes some of the unique aspects of his directing method:

Altman&#x27;s personal archives are located at the University of Michigan, which include about 900 boxes of personal papers, scripts, legal, business and financial records, photographs, props and related material. Altman had filmed &quot;Secret Honor&quot; at the university, as well as directed several operas there.

Since 2009, the Robert Altman Award is awarded to the director, casting director, and ensemble cast of films at the yearly Independent Spirit Awards.

In 2014, a feature-length documentary film, &quot;Altman,&quot; was released, which looks at his life and work with film clips and interviews.

<text>Assata Olugbala Shakur (born JoAnne Deborah Byron; July 16, 1947), also known as Joanne Chesimard, is an American political activist and convicted murderer who was a member of the Black Liberation Army (BLA). In 1977, she was convicted in the murder of state trooper Werner Foerster during a shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike in 1973. She escaped from prison in 1979 and is currently wanted by the FBI, with a $1 million FBI reward for information leading to her capture, and an additional $1 million reward offered by the New Jersey attorney general.

Born in Flushing, Queens, she grew up in New York City and Wilmington, North Carolina. After she ran away from home several times, her aunt, who would later act as one of her lawyers, took her in. She became involved in political activism at Borough of Manhattan Community College and City College of New York. After graduation, she began using the name Assata Shakur, and briefly joined the Black Panther Party. She then joined the BLA. Assata means &quot;she who struggles&quot;, Olugbala means &quot;the one who saves&quot;, and Shakur means &quot;the thankful one&quot;. 

Between 1971 and 1973, she was charged with several crimes and was the subject of a multi-state manhunt. In May 1973, Shakur was arrested after being wounded in a shootout on the New Jersey Turnpike. Also involved in the shootout were officers Werner Foerster and James Harper, and BLA members Sundiata Acoli and Zayd Malik Shakur. Harper was wounded, and Zayd Shakur and Foerster were killed. Between 1973 and 1977, Shakur was charged with murder, attempted murder, armed robbery, and kidnapping in relation to the shootout and six other incidents. She was acquitted on three of the charges and three were dismissed. In 1977, she was convicted of the murder of State Trooper Foerster and of seven other felonies related to the 1973 shootout. Her defense had argued medical evidence suggested her innocence since her arm was injured in the shootout.

While serving a life sentence for murder, Shakur escaped in 1979, with assistance from the BLA and members of the May 19 Communist Organization, from the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey and was granted political asylum in Cuba in 1984. Shakur has lived in Cuba since, despite US government efforts to have her returned. She has been on the FBI Most Wanted Terrorists list since 2013 as Joanne Deborah Chesimard and was the first woman to be added to this list.

==Early life and education==
Assata Shakur was born Joanne Deborah Byron, in Flushing, Queens on July 16, 1947. She lived for three years with her mother, schoolteacher Doris E. Johnson, and retired grandparents, Lula and Frank Hill. 

In 1950, Shakur&#x27;s parents divorced, and she moved with her grandparents to Wilmington, North Carolina. After elementary school, Shakur moved back to Queens to live with her mother and stepfather (her mother had remarried); she attended Parsons Junior High School. Shakur still frequently visited her grandparents in the south. Her family struggled financially and argued frequently; Shakur spent little time at home. 

She often ran away, staying with strangers and working for short periods of time, until she was taken in by her mother&#x27;s sister, Evelyn A. Williams, a civil rights worker who lived in Manhattan. Shakur has said that her aunt was the heroine of her childhood, as she was constantly introducing her to new things. She said that her aunt was &quot;very sophisticated and knew all kinds of things. She was right up my alley because i was forever asking all kinds of questions. I wanted to know everything.&quot; Williams often took the girl to museums, theaters, and art galleries.

Shakur converted to Catholicism as a child and attended the all-girls Cathedral High School for six months before transferring to public high school, which she attended for a while before dropping out. Her aunt helped her to later earn a General Educational Development (GED) degree. Often there were few or no other black students in her Catholic high school class.

Shakur later wrote that teachers seemed surprised when she answered a question in class, as if not expecting black people to be intelligent and engaged. She said she was taught a sugar-coated version of history that ignored the oppression suffered by people of color, especially in the United States. In her autobiography, she wrote: &quot;I didn&#x27;t know what a fool they had made out of me until I grew up and started to read real history&quot;.

Shakur attended Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC) and then the City College of New York (CCNY) in the mid-1960s, where she became involved in many political activities, civil rights protests, and sit-ins. 

She was arrested for the first time — with 100 other BMCC students — in 1967, on charges of trespassing. The students had chained and locked the entrance to a college building to protest the low numbers of black faculty and the lack of a Black Studies program.

== Personal life ==
In April 1967, she married Louis Chesimard, a fellow student-activist at CCNY, in a Catholic wedding ceremony. Their married life ended within a year; they divorced in December 1970 and Chesimard was granted an annulment. In her 320-page memoir, Shakur gave one paragraph to her marriage, saying that it ended over their differing views of gender roles.

==Black Panther Party and Black Liberation Army==
After graduation from CCNY, Shakur moved to Oakland, California, where she joined the Black Panther Party (BPP). In Oakland, Shakur worked with the BPP to organize protests and community education programs.

After returning to New York City, Shakur led the BPP chapter in Harlem, coordinating the Free Breakfast for Children program, free clinics, and community outreach. But she soon left the party, disliking the macho behavior of the men and believing that the BPP members and leaders lacked knowledge and understanding of United States African black history. Shakur joined the Black Liberation Army (BLA), an offshoot whose members were inspired by the Vietcong and the Algerian independence fighters of the Battle of Algiers. They mounted a campaign of guerilla activities against the U.S. government, using such tactics as planting bombs, holding up banks, and murdering drug dealers and police.

She began using the name &quot;Assata Olugbala Shakur&quot; in 1971, rejecting Joanne Chesimard as a &quot;slave name&quot;. Assata is a West African name, derived from Aisha, said to mean &quot;she who struggles&quot;, while Shakur means &quot;thankful one&quot; in Arabic. Olugbala means &quot;savior&quot; in Yoruba. She identified as an African and felt her old name no longer fit: &quot;It sounded so strange when people called me Joanne. It really had nothing to do with me. I didn&#x27;t feel like no Joanne, or no negro, or no American. I felt like an African woman&quot;.

==Allegations and manhunt==
Beginning in 1971, Shakur was allegedly involved in several incidents of assault and robbery, in which she was charged or identified as wanted for questioning, including attacks on New York City police and bank robberies in the area.

On April 6, 1971, Shakur was shot in the stomach during a struggle with a guest at the Statler Hilton Hotel in Midtown Manhattan. According to police, Shakur knocked on the door of a guest&#x27;s room, asked &quot;Is there a party going on here?&quot;, then displayed a revolver and demanded money. In 1987, Shakur confirmed to a journalist that there was a drug connection in this incident but refused to elaborate.
She was booked on charges of attempted robbery, assault, reckless endangerment, and possession of a deadly weapon, then released on bail. Shakur is alleged to have said that she was glad that she had been shot; afterward, she was no longer afraid to be shot again.

Following an August 23, 1971, bank robbery in Queens, Shakur was sought for questioning. A photograph of a woman (who was later alleged to be Shakur) wearing thick-rimmed black glasses, with a high hairdo pulled tightly over her head, and pointing a gun, was widely displayed in banks. The New York Clearing House Association paid for full-page ads displaying material about Shakur. In 1987, when asked in Cuba about police allegations that the BLA gained funds by conducting bank robberies and theft, Shakur responded, &quot;There were expropriations, there were bank robberies.&quot;
On December 21, 1971, Shakur was named by the New York City Police Department as one of four suspects in a hand grenade attack that destroyed a police car and injured two officers in Maspeth, Queens. When a witness identified Shakur and Andrew Jackson from FBI photographs, a 13-state alarm was issued three days after the attack. Law enforcement officials in Atlanta, Georgia, said that Shakur and Jackson had lived together in Atlanta for several months in the summer of 1971.

Shakur was wanted for questioning for wounding a police officer on January 26, 1972, who was attempting to serve a traffic summons in Brooklyn. After an $89,000 Brooklyn bank robbery on March 1, 1972, a &quot;Daily News&quot; headline asked: &quot;Was that JoAnne?&quot; Shakur was identified as wanted for questioning after a September 1, 1972, bank robbery in the Bronx. Based on FBI photographs, Monsignor John Powis alleged that Shakur was involved in an armed robbery at Our Lady of the Presentation Church in Brownsville, Brooklyn, on September 14, 1972.

In 1972, Shakur became the subject of a nationwide manhunt after the FBI alleged that she led a Black Liberation Army cell that had conducted a &quot;series of cold-blooded murders of New York City police officers&quot;. The FBI said these included the &quot;execution style murders&quot; of New York City Police Officers Joseph Piagentini and Waverly Jones on May 21, 1971, and NYPD officers Gregory Foster and Rocco Laurie on January 28, 1972. Shakur was alleged to have been directly involved with the Foster and Laurie murders, and involved tangentially with the Piagentini and Jones murders.

Some sources identify Shakur as the &quot;de facto&quot; head of the BLA after the arrest of co-founder Dhoruba Moore. Robert Daley, Deputy Commissioner of the New York City Police, for example, described Shakur as &quot;the final wanted fugitive, the soul of the gang, the mother hen who kept them together, kept them moving, kept them shooting&quot;. Years later, some police officers argued that her importance in the BLA had been exaggerated by the police. One officer said that they had created a &quot;myth&quot; to &quot;demonize&quot; Shakur because she was &quot;educated&quot;, &quot;young and pretty&quot;.

As of February 17, 1972, when Shakur was identified as one of four BLA members on a short trip to Chattanooga, Tennessee, she was wanted for questioning (along with Robert Vickers, Twyman Meyers, Samuel Cooper, and Paul Stewart) in relation to police killings, a Queens bank robbery, and the grenade attack on police. Shakur was reported as one of six suspects in the ambushing of four policemen—two in Jamaica, Queens, and two in Brooklyn—on January 28, 1973.

On April 16, 1981, Shakur was allegedly in the back seat of a van connected with a burglary. After the vehicle was pulled over, two men stepped out of the vehicle and opened fire on NYPD officers John Scarangella and Richard Rainey. The two men were charged with the murder of Officer Scarangella and attempted murder of Officer Rainey.

By June 1973, an apparatus that would become the FBI&#x27;s Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF) was issuing nearly daily briefings on Shakur&#x27;s status and the allegations against her.

According to Cleaver and George Katsiaficas, the FBI and local police &quot;initiated a national search-and-destroy mission for suspected BLA members, collaborating in stakeouts that were the products of intensive political repression and counterintelligence campaigns like NEWKILL&quot;. They &quot;attempted to tie Assata to every suspected action of the BLA involving a woman&quot;. The JTTF would later serve as the &quot;coordinating body in the search for Assata and the renewed campaign to smash the BLA&quot;, after her escape from prison. After her capture, however, Shakur was not charged with any of the crimes for which she was purportedly the subject of the manhunt.

Shakur and others claim that she was targeted by the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO as a result of her involvement with the black liberation organizations. Specifically, documentary evidence suggests that Shakur was targeted by an investigation named CHESROB, which &quot;attempted to hook former New York Panther Joanne Chesimard (Assata Shakur) to virtually every bank robbery or violent crime involving a black woman on the East Coast&quot;. Although named after Shakur, CHESROB (like its predecessor, NEWKILL) was not limited to Shakur.

Years later when she was living in Cuba, Shakur was asked about the BLA&#x27;s alleged involvement in the killings of police officers. She said, &quot;In reality, armed struggle historically has been used by people to liberate themselves... But the question lies in when do people use armed struggle... There were people [in the BLA] who absolutely took the position that it was just time to resist, and if black people didn&#x27;t start to fight back against police brutality and didn&#x27;t start to wage armed resistance, we would be annihilated.&quot;

==New Jersey Turnpike shootout==
On May 2, 1973, at about 12:45 a.m., Assata Shakur, along with Zayd Malik Shakur and Sundiata Acoli, were stopped on the New Jersey Turnpike in East Brunswick for driving with a broken tail light by State Trooper James Harper, backed up by Trooper Werner Foerster in a second patrol vehicle. The vehicle was &quot;slightly&quot; exceeding the speed limit. Recordings of Trooper Harper calling the dispatcher were played at the trials of both Acoli and Assata Shakur.

The stop occurred south of what was then the Turnpike Authority administration building. Acoli was driving the two-door vehicle, Assata Shakur was seated in the right front seat, and Zayd Shakur was in the right rear seat. Trooper Harper asked the driver for identification, noticed a discrepancy, asked him to get out of the car, and questioned him at the rear of the vehicle.

With the questioning of Acoli, accounts by participants of the confrontation begin to differ (see the witnesses section below). A shootout ensued in which Trooper Foerster was shot twice in the head with his own gun and killed, Zayd Shakur was killed, and Assata Shakur and Trooper Harper were wounded.

According to initial police statements, at this point one or more of the suspects had begun firing with semiautomatic handguns, and Trooper Foerster fired four times before falling mortally wounded. At Acoli&#x27;s trial, Harper testified that the gunfight started &quot;seconds&quot; after Foerster arrived at the scene. At this trial, Harper said that Foerster reached into the vehicle, pulled out and held up a semi-automatic pistol and ammunition magazine, and said &quot;Jim, look what I found,&quot; while facing Harper at the rear of the vehicle. The police ordered Assata Shakur and Zayd Shakur to put their hands on their laps and not to move; Harper said that Assata Shakur reached down to the right of her right leg, pulled out a pistol, and shot him in the shoulder, after which he retreated to behind his vehicle. Questioned by prosecutor C. Judson Hamlin, Harper said he saw Foerster shot just as Assata Shakur was hit by bullets from Harper&#x27;s gun. In his opening statement to a jury, Hamlin said that Acoli shot Foerster with a .38 caliber semiautomatic pistol and used Foerster&#x27;s own gun to &quot;execute him&quot;. According to the testimony of State Police investigators, two jammed semi-automatic pistols were discovered near Foerster&#x27;s body.

Acoli drove the car (a white Pontiac LeMans with Vermont license plates)—which contained Assata Shakur, who was wounded, and Zayd Shakur, who was dead or dying— down the road. The vehicle was chased by three patrol cars and the booths down the turnpike were alerted. Acoli stopped and exited the car and, after being ordered to halt by a trooper, fled into the woods as the trooper emptied his gun. Assata Shakur walked toward the trooper with her bloodied arms raised in surrender. Acoli was captured after a 36-hour manhunt—involving 400 people, state police helicopters, and bloodhounds. Zayd Shakur&#x27;s body was found in a nearby gully along the road.

According to a New Jersey Police spokesperson, Assata Shakur was on her way to a &quot;new hideout in Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;heading ultimately for Washington&quot;. A book in the vehicle was said to contain a list of potential BLA targets. Assata Shakur testified she was on her way to Baltimore for a job as a bar waitress.

With gunshot wounds in both arms and a shoulder, Assata Shakur was moved to Middlesex General Hospital under &quot;heavy guard&quot; and was reported to be in &quot;serious condition&quot;. Trooper Harper was wounded in the left shoulder, reported in &quot;good&quot; condition, and given a protective guard at the hospital. Assata Shakur was interrogated and arraigned from her hospital bed.

Her defense team alleged that her medical care during this period was &quot;substandard&quot;. 

She was transferred from Middlesex General Hospital in New Brunswick to Roosevelt Hospital in Edison after her lawyers obtained a court order from Judge John Bachman, and then transferred to Middlesex County Workhouse a few weeks later.

During an interview, Assata Shakur discussed her treatment by the police and medical staff at Middlesex General Hospital. She said that the police beat and choked her and were &quot;doing everything that they could possibly do as soon as the doctors or nurses would go outside&quot;.

==Criminal charges and dispositions==
Between 1973 and 1977, in New York and New Jersey, Shakur was indicted ten times, resulting in seven different criminal trials. Shakur was charged with two bank robberies, the kidnapping of a Brooklyn heroin dealer, the attempted murder of two Queens police officers stemming from a January 23, 1973, failed ambush, and eight other felonies related to the Turnpike shootout. Of these trials, three resulted in acquittals, one in a hung jury, one in a change of venue, one in a mistrial due to pregnancy, and one in a conviction. Three indictments were dismissed without trial.

===Bronx bank robbery mistrial===
In December 1973, Shakur was tried for a September 29, 1972, $3,700 robbery of the Manufacturer&#x27;s Hanover Trust Company in the Bronx, along with co-defendant Kamau Sadiki (born Fred Hilton). In light of the pending murder prosecution against Shakur in New Jersey state court, her lawyers requested that the trial be postponed for six months to permit further preparation. Judge Lee P. Gagliardi denied a postponement, and the Second Circuit denied Shakur&#x27;s petition for mandamus. In protest, the lawyers stayed mute, and Shakur and Sadiki conducted their own defense. Seven other BLA members were indicted by District Attorney Eugene Gold in connection with the series of holdups and shootings on the same day, who—according to Gold—represented the &quot;top echelon&quot; of the BLA as determined by a year-long investigation.

The prosecution&#x27;s case rested largely on the testimony of two men who had pleaded guilty to participating in the holdup. The prosecution called four witnesses: Avon White and John Rivers (both of whom had already pled guilty to the robbery) and the manager and teller of the bank. White and Rivers, although having pled guilty, had not yet been sentenced for the robbery and were promised that the charges would be dropped in exchange for their testimony. White and Rivers testified that Shakur had guarded one of the doors with a .357 magnum pistol and that Sadiki had served as a lookout and drove the getaway truck during the robbery; neither White nor Rivers was cross-examined due to the defense attorney&#x27;s refusal to participate in the trial. Shakur&#x27;s aunt and lawyer, Evelyn Williams, was cited for contempt of court after walking out of the courtroom after many of her attempted motions were denied. The trial was delayed for a few days after Shakur was diagnosed with pleurisy.

During the trial, the defendants were escorted to a &quot;holding pen&quot; outside the courtroom several times after shouting complaints and epithets at Judge Gagliardi. While in the holding pen, they listened to the proceedings over loudspeakers. Both defendants were repeatedly cited for contempt of court and eventually barred from the courtroom, where the trial continued in their absence. A contemporary &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial criticized Williams for failing to maintain courtroom &quot;decorum,&quot; comparing her actions to William Kunstler&#x27;s recent contempt conviction for his actions during the &quot;Chicago Seven&quot; trial.

Sadiki&#x27;s lawyer, Robert Bloom, attempted to have the trial dismissed and then postponed due to new &quot;revelations&quot; regarding the credibility of White, a former co-defendant by then working for the prosecution. Bloom had been assigned to defend Sadiki/Hilton over the summer, but White was not disclosed as a government witness until right before the trial. Judge Gagliardi instructed both the prosecution and the defense not to bring up Shakur or Sadiki&#x27;s connections to the BLA, saying they were &quot;not relevant&quot;. Gagliardi denied requests by the jurors to pose questions to the witnesses—either directly or through him—and declined to provide the jury with information they requested about how long the defense had been given to prepare, saying it was &quot;none of their concern&quot;. This trial resulted in a hung jury and then a mistrial, when the jury reported to Gagliardi that they were hopelessly deadlocked for the fourth time.

===Bronx bank robbery retrial===
The retrial was delayed for one day to give the defendants more time to prepare. The new jury selection was marked by attempts by Williams to be relieved of her duties, owing to disagreements with Shakur as well as with Hilton&#x27;s attorney. Judge Arnold Bauman denied the application, but directed another lawyer, Howard Jacobs, to defend Shakur while Williams remained the attorney of record. Shakur was ejected following an argument with Williams, and Hilton left with her as jury selection continued. After the selection of twelve jurors (60 were excused), Williams was allowed to retire from the case, with Shakur officially representing herself, assisted by lawyer Florynce Kennedy. In the retrial, White testified that the six alleged robbers had saved their hair clippings to create disguises, and identified a partially obscured head and shoulder in a photo taken from a surveillance camera as Shakur&#x27;s. Kennedy objected to this identification on the grounds that the prosecutor, assistant United States attorney Peter Truebner, had offered to stipulate that Shakur was not depicted in any of the photographs. Although both White and Rivers testified that Shakur was wearing overalls during the robbery, the person identified as Shakur in the photograph was wearing a jacket. The defense attempted to discredit White on the grounds that he had spent eight months in Matteawan Hospital for the Criminally Insane in 1968, and White countered that he had faked insanity (by claiming to be Allah in front of three psychiatrists) to get transferred out of prison.

Shakur personally cross-examined the witnesses, getting White to admit that he had once been in love with her; the same day, one juror (who had been frequently napping during the trial) was replaced with an alternate. During the retrial, the defendants repeatedly left or were thrown out of the courtroom. Both defendants were acquitted in the retrial; six jurors interviewed after the trial stated that they did not believe the two key prosecution witnesses. Shakur was immediately returned to Morristown, New Jersey, under a heavy guard following the trial. Louis Chesimard (Shakur&#x27;s ex-husband) and Paul Stewart, the other two alleged robbers, had been acquitted in June.

===Turnpike shootout mistrial===
The Turnpike shootout proceedings continued with Judge John E. Bachman in Middlesex County. New Jersey Superior Court Judge Leon Gerofsky ordered a change of venue in 1973 from Middlesex to Morris County, New Jersey, saying &quot;it was almost impossible to obtain a jury here comprising people willing to accept the responsibility of impartiality so that defendants will be protected from transitory passion and prejudice.&quot; Morris County, had a far smaller black population than Middlesex County. On this basis, Shakur unsuccessfully attempted to move the trial to federal court.

Before jury selection was complete, it was discovered that Shakur was pregnant. Due to the possibility of miscarriage, the prosecution successfully requested a mistrial for Shakur; Acoli&#x27;s trial continued.

===Attempted murder dismissal===
Shakur and four others (including Fred Hilton, Avon White, and Andrew Jackson) were indicted in the State Supreme Court in the Bronx on December 31, 1973, on charges of attempting to shoot and kill two policemen—Michael O&#x27;Reilly and Roy Polliana, who were wounded but had since returned to duty—in an ambush in St. Albans, Queens on January 28, 1973. On March 5, 1974, two new defendants (Jeannette Jefferson and Robert Hayes) were named in an indictment involving the same charges. On April 26, while Shakur was pregnant, New Jersey Governor Brendan Byrne signed an extradition order to move Shakur to New Jersey to face two counts of attempted murder, attempted assault, and possession of dangerous weapons related to the alleged ambush; however, Shakur declined to waive her right to an extradition hearing, and asked for a full hearing before Middlesex County Court Judge John E. Bachman.

Shakur was extradited to New York City on May 6, arraigned on May 11 (pleading not guilty), and remanded to jail by Justice Albert S. McGrover of the State Supreme Court, pending a pretrial hearing on July 2. In November 1974, New York State Supreme Court Justice Peter Farrell dismissed the attempted murder indictment because of insufficient evidence, declaring &quot;The court can only note with disapproval that virtually a year has passed before counsel made an application for the most basic relief permitted by law, namely an attack on the sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the grand jury.&quot;

===Kidnapping trial===
Shakur was indicted on May 30, 1974, on the charge of having robbed a Brooklyn bar and kidnapping bartender James E. Freeman for ransom. Shakur and co-defendant Ronald Myers were accused of entering the bar with pistols and shotguns, taking $50 from the register, kidnapping the bartender, leaving a note demanding a $20,000 ransom from the bar owner, and fleeing in a rented truck. Freeman was said to have later escaped unhurt. The text of Shakur&#x27;s opening statement in the trial is reproduced in her autobiography. Shakur and co-defendant Ronald Myers were acquitted on December 19, 1975, after seven hours of jury deliberation, ending a three-month trial in front of Judge William Thompson.

===Queens bank robbery trial===
In July 1973, after being indicted by a grand jury, Shakur pleaded not guilty in Federal Court in Brooklyn to an indictment related to a $7,700 robbery of the Bankers Trust Company bank in Queens on August 31, 1971. Judge Jacob Mishlerset set a tentative trial date of November 5 that year. The trial was delayed until 1976, when Shakur was represented by Stanley Cohen and Evelyn Williams. In this trial, Shakur acted as her own co-counsel and told the jury in her opening testimony:
One bank employee testified that Shakur was one of the bank robbers, but three other bank employees (including two tellers) testified that they were uncertain. The prosecution showed surveillance photos of four of the six alleged robbers, contending that one of them was Shakur wearing a wig. Shakur was forcibly subdued and photographed by the FBI on the judge&#x27;s order, after having refused to cooperate, believing that the FBI would use photo manipulation; a subsequent judge determined that the manners in which the photos were obtained violated Shakur&#x27;s rights and ruled the new photos inadmissible. In her autobiography, Shakur recounts being beaten, choked, and kicked on the courtroom floor by five marshals, as Williams narrated the events to ensure they would appear on the court record. Shortly after deliberation began, the jury asked to see all the photographic exhibits taken from the surveillance footage. The jury determined that a widely circulated FBI photo allegedly showing Shakur participating in the robbery was not her.

Shakur was acquitted after seven hours of jury deliberation on January 16, 1976, and was immediately remanded back to New Jersey for the Turnpike trial. The actual transfer took place on January 29. She was the only one of the six suspects in the robbery to be brought to trial. Andrew Jackson and two others indicted for the same robbery pleaded guilty; Jackson was sentenced to five years in prison and five years&#x27; probation; another was shot and killed in a gunfight in Florida on December 31, 1971, and the last remained at large at the time of Shakur&#x27;s acquittal.

===Turnpike shootout retrial===
By the time she was retried in 1977, Acoli had already been convicted of shooting and murdering Foerster. The prosecution argued that Assata had fired the bullets that had wounded Harper, while the defense argued that the now deceased Zayd had fired them. Based on New Jersey law, if Shakur&#x27;s presence at the scene could be considered as &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; the murder of Foerster, she could be convicted even if she had not fired the bullets which had killed him.

A total of 289 articles had been published in the local press relating to the various crimes with which Shakur had been accused. Shakur again attempted to move the trial to federal court. The United States District Court for the District of New Jersey denied the petition and also denied Shakur an injunction against the holding of trial proceedings on Fridays. An en banc panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.

The nine-week trial was widely publicized and was even reported on by the Telegraph Agency of the Soviet Union (TASS). During the trial, hundreds of civil rights campaigners demonstrated outside of the Middlesex County courthouse each day.

Following the 13-minute opening statement by Edward J. Barone, the first assistant Middlesex County prosecutor (directing the case for the state), William Kunstler (the chief of Shakur&#x27;s defense staff) moved immediately for a mistrial, calling the eight-count grand jury indictment &quot;adversary proceeding solely and exclusively under the control of the prosecutor&quot;, whom Kunstler accused of &quot;improper prejudicial remarks&quot;; Judge Theodore Appleby, noting the frequent defense interruptions that had characterized the previous days&#x27; jury selection, denied the motion.

On February 23, Shakur&#x27;s attorneys filed papers asking Judge Appleby to subpoena FBI Director Clarence Kelley, Senator Frank Church and other federal and New York City law enforcement officials to testify about the FBI Counter Intelligence Program, which they alleged was designed to harass and disrupt black activist organizations. Kunstler had previously been successful in subpoenaing Kelley and Church for the trials of American Indian Movement (AIM) members charged with murdering FBI agents. The motion (argued March 2)—which also asked the court to require the production of memos, tapes, documents, and photographs of alleged COINTELPRO involvement from 1970 to 1973—was denied.

Shakur herself was called as a witness on March 15, the first witness called by the defense; she denied shooting either Harper or Foerster, and also denied handling a weapon during the incident. She was questioned by her own attorney, Stuart Ball, for under 40 minutes, and then cross-examined by Barone for less than two hours (see the Witnesses section below). Ball&#x27;s questioning ended with the following exchange:

Under cross-examination, Shakur was unable to explain how three magazines of ammunition and 16 live shells had gotten into her shoulder bag; she also admitted to knowing that Zayd Shakur carried a gun at times, and specifically to seeing a gun sticking out of Acoli&#x27;s pocket while stopping for supper at a Howard Johnson&#x27;s restaurant shortly before the shooting. Shakur admitted to carrying an identification card with the name &quot;Justine Henderson&quot; in her billfold the night of the shootout, but denied using any of the aliases on the long list that Barone proceeded to read.

====Defense attorneys====
Shakur&#x27;s defense attorneys were William Kunstler (the chief of Shakur&#x27;s defense staff), Stuart Ball, Robert Bloom, Raymond A. Brown, Stanley Cohen (who died of unknown causes early on in the Turnpike trial), Lennox Hinds, Florynce Kennedy, Louis Myers, Laurence Stern, and Evelyn Williams, Shakur&#x27;s aunt. Of these attorneys, Kunstler, Ball, Cohen, Myers, Stern and Williams appeared in court for the turnpike trial. Kunstler became involved in Shakur&#x27;s trials in 1975, when contacted by Williams, and commuted from New York City to New Brunswick every day with Stern.

Her attorneys, in particular Lennox Hinds, were often held in contempt of court, which the National Conference of Black Lawyers cited as an example of systemic bias in the judicial system. The New Jersey Legal Ethics Committee also investigated complaints against Hinds for comparing Shakur&#x27;s murder trial to &quot;legalized lynching&quot; undertaken by a &quot;kangaroo court&quot;. Hinds&#x27; disciplinary proceeding reached the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Middlesex County Ethics Committee v. Garden State Bar Ass&#x27;n&quot; (1982). According to Kunstler&#x27;s autobiography, the sizable contingent of New Jersey State Troopers guarding the courthouse were under strict orders from their commander, Col. Clinton Pagano, to completely shun Shakur&#x27;s defense attorneys.

Judge Appleby also threatened Kunstler with dismissal and contempt of court after he delivered an October 21, 1976, speech at nearby Rutgers University that in part discussed the upcoming trial, but later ruled that Kunstler could represent Shakur. Until obtaining a court order, Kunstler was forced to strip naked and undergo a body search before each visit with Shakur—during which Shakur was shackled to a bed by both ankles. Judge Appleby also refused to investigate a burglary of her defense counsel&#x27;s office that resulted in the disappearance of trial documents, amounting to half of the legal papers related to her case. Her lawyers also claimed that their offices were secretly recorded.

====Witnesses====
Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike driver who saw part of the incident were the only surviving witnesses. Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements, nor did he testify in his own trial or give a statement to the police. The driver traveling north on the turnpike testified that he had seen a State Trooper struggling with a Black man between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.

Shakur testified that Trooper Harper shot her after she raised her arms to comply with his demand. She said that the second shot hit her in the back as she turned to avoid it, and that she fell onto the road for the duration of the gunfight before crawling back into the backseat of the Pontiac—which Acoli drove down the road and parked. She testified that she remained there until State Troopers dragged her onto the road.

Trooper Harper&#x27;s official reports state that after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli to the back of the vehicle for Trooper Foerster—who had arrived on the scene—to examine his driver&#x27;s license. The reports then state that after Acoli complied, and as Harper was looking inside the vehicle to examine the registration, Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition magazine as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red pocketbook, pulled out a 9mm handgun and fired at him. Trooper Harper&#x27;s reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.

====Jury====
A total of 408 potential jurors were questioned during the &quot;voir dire&quot;, which concluded on February 14. All of the 15 jurors—ten women and five men—were white, and most were under thirty years old. Five jurors had personal ties to State Troopers (one girlfriend, two nephews, and two friends). A sixteenth female juror was removed before the trial formally opened, when it was determined that Sheriff Joseph DeMarino of Middlesex County, while a private detective several years earlier, had worked for a lawyer who represented the juror&#x27;s husband. Judge Appleby repeatedly denied Kunstler&#x27;s requests for DeMarino to be removed from his responsibilities for the duration of the trial &quot;because he did not divulge his association with the juror&quot;.

One prospective juror was dismissed for reading &quot;Target Blue&quot;, a book by Robert Daley, a former New York City Deputy Police Commander, which dealt in part with Shakur and had been left in the jury assembly room. Before the jury entered the courtroom, Judge Appleby ordered Shakur&#x27;s lawyers to remove a copy of &quot;&quot; by Alex Haley from a position on the defense counsel table easily visible to jurors. The &quot;Roots&quot; TV miniseries adapted from the book and shown shortly before the trial was believed to have evoked feelings of &quot;guilt and sympathy&quot; with many white viewers.

Shakur&#x27;s attorneys sought a new trial on the grounds that one jury member, John McGovern, had violated the jury&#x27;s sequestration order. Judge Appleby rejected Kunstler&#x27;s claim that the juror had violated the order. McGovern later sued Kunstler for defamation; Kunstler eventually publicly apologized to McGovern and paid him a small settlement. Additionally, in his autobiography, Kunstler alleged that he later learned from a law enforcement agent that a New Jersey State Assembly member had addressed the jury at the hotel where they were sequestered, urging them to convict Shakur.

====Medical evidence====
A key element of Shakur&#x27;s defense was medical testimony meant to demonstrate that she was shot with her hands up and that she would have been subsequently unable to fire a weapon. A neurologist testified that the median nerve in Shakur&#x27;s right arm was severed by the second bullet, making her unable to pull a trigger. Neurosurgeon Dr. Arthur Turner Davidson, Associate Professor of Surgery at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, testified that the wounds in her upper arms, armpit and chest, and severed median nerve that instantly paralyzed her right arm, would only have been caused if both arms were raised, and that to sustain such injuries while crouching and firing a weapon (as described in Trooper Harper&#x27;s testimony) &quot;would be anatomically impossible&quot;.

Davidson based his testimony on an August 4, 1976, examination of Shakur and on X-rays taken immediately after the shootout at Middlesex General Hospital. Prosecutor Barone questioned whether Davidson was qualified to make such a judgment 39 months after the injury; Barone proceeded to suggest (while a female Sheriff&#x27;s attendant acted out his suggestion) that Shakur was struck in the right arm and collar bone and &quot;then spun around by the impact of the bullet so an immediate second shot entered the fleshy part of her upper left arm&quot; to which Davidson replied, &quot;Impossible.&quot;

Dr. David Spain, a pathologist from Brookdale Community College, testified that her bullet scars as well as X-rays supported her claim that her arms were raised, and that there was &quot;no conceivable way&quot; the first bullet could have hit Shakur&#x27;s clavicle if her arm was down.

Judge Appleby eventually cut off funds for any further expert defense testimony. Shakur, in her autobiography, and Williams, in &quot;Inadmissible Evidence&quot;, both claim that it was difficult to find expert witnesses for the trial, because of the expense and because most forensic and ballistic specialists declined on the grounds of a conflict of interest when approached because they routinely performed such work for law enforcement officials.

====Other evidence====
According to Angela Davis, neutron activation analysis that was administered after the shootout showed no gunpowder residue on Shakur&#x27;s fingers and forensic analysis performed at the Trenton, New Jersey crime lab and the FBI crime labs in Washington, D.C., did not find her fingerprints on any weapon at the scene. According to tape recordings and police reports made several hours after the shoot-out, when Harper returned on foot to the administration building 200 yards (183 m) away, he did not report Foerster&#x27;s presence at the scene; no one at headquarters knew of Foerster&#x27;s involvement in the shoot-out until his body was discovered beside his patrol car, more than an hour later.

====Conviction and sentencing====
On March 24, the jurors listened for 45 minutes to a rereading of testimony of the State Police chemist regarding the blood found at the scene, on the LeMans, and Shakur&#x27;s clothing. That night, the second night of jury deliberation, the jury asked Judge Appleby to repeat his instructions regarding the four assault charges 30 minutes before retiring for the night, which led to speculation that the jury had decided in Shakur&#x27;s favor on the remaining charges, especially the two counts of murder. Appleby reiterated that the jury must consider separately the four assault charges (atrocious assault and battery, assault on a police officer acting in the line of duty, assault with a deadly weapon, and assault with intent to kill), each of which carried a total maximum penalty of 33 years in prison. The other charges were: first-degree murder (of Foerster), second-degree murder (of Zayd Shakur), illegal possession of a weapon, and armed robbery (related to Foerster&#x27;s service revolver). The jury also asked Appleby to repeat the definitions of &quot;intent&quot; and &quot;reasonable doubt&quot;.

Shakur was convicted on all eight counts: two murder charges and six assault charges. Upon hearing the verdict, Shakur said—in a barely audible voice—&quot;I am ashamed that I have even taken part in this trial&quot;, and that the jury was racist and had &quot;convicted a woman with her hands up.&quot; When Judge Appleby told the court attendants to &quot;remove the prisoner,&quot; Shakur herself replied: &quot;The prisoner will walk away on her own feet.&quot; After Joseph W. Lewis, the jury foreman, read the verdict, Kunstler asked that the jury be removed before alleging that one juror had violated the sequestration order (as detailed above).

At the post-trial press conference, Kunstler blamed the verdict on racism, stating that &quot;the white element was there to destroy her&quot;. When asked by a reporter why, if that were the case, it took the jury 24 hours to reach a verdict, Kunstler replied, &quot;That was just a pretense.&quot; A few minutes later the prosecutor Barone disagreed with Kunstler&#x27;s assessment saying the trial&#x27;s outcome was decided &quot;completely on the facts&quot;.

At Shakur&#x27;s sentencing hearing on April 25, Appleby sentenced her to 26 to 33 years in state prison (10 to 12 for the four counts of assault, 12 to 15 for robbery, 2 to 3 for armed robbery, plus 2 to 3 for aiding and abetting the murder of Foerster), to be served consecutively with her mandatory life sentence. However, Appleby dismissed the second-degree murder of Zayd Shakur, as the New Jersey Supreme Court had recently narrowed the application of the law. Appleby finally sentenced Shakur to 30 days in the Middlesex County Workhouse for contempt of court, concurrent with the other sentences, for refusing to rise when he entered the courtroom. To become eligible for parole, Shakur would have had to serve a minimum of 25 years, which would have included her four years in custody during the trials.

===Nelson murder dismissal===
In October 1977, New York State Superior Court Justice John Starkey dismissed murder and robbery charges against Shakur related to the death of Richard Nelson during a hold-up of a Brooklyn social club on December 28, 1972, ruling that the state had delayed too long in bringing her to trial. Judge Starkey said, &quot;People have constitutional rights, and you can&#x27;t shuffle them around.&quot; The case was delayed in being brought to trial as a result of an agreement between the governors of New York and New Jersey as to the priority of the various charges against Shakur. Three other defendants were indicted in relation to the same holdup: Melvin Kearney, who died in 1976 from an eight-floor fall while trying to escape from the Brooklyn House of Detention, Twymon Myers, who was killed by police while a fugitive, and Andrew Jackson, the charges against whom were dismissed when two prosecution witnesses could not identify him in a lineup.

===Attempted robbery dismissal===
On November 22, 1977, Shakur pleaded not guilty to an attempted armed robbery indictment stemming from the 1971 incident at the Statler Hilton Hotel. Shakur was accused of attempting to rob a Michigan man staying at the hotel of $250 of cash and personal property. The prosecutor was C. Richard Gibbons. The charges were dismissed without trial.

==Imprisonment==
After the Turnpike shootings, Shakur was briefly held at the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility in Yardville, Burlington County, New Jersey, and later moved to Rikers Island Correctional Institution for Women in New York City where she was kept in solitary confinement for 21 months. Shakur&#x27;s only daughter, Kakuya Shakur, was conceived during her trial and born on September 11, 1974, in the &quot;fortified psychiatric ward&quot; at Elmhurst General Hospital in Queens, where Shakur stayed for a few days before being returned to Rikers Island. In her autobiography, Shakur claims that she was beaten and restrained by several large female officers after refusing a medical exam from a prison doctor shortly after giving birth. After a bomb threat was made against Judge Appleby, Sheriff Joseph DeMarino lied to the press about the exact date of her transfer to Clinton Correctional Facility for Women; he later claimed the threat to be the cause of his falsification. She was also transferred from the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women to a special area staffed by women guards at the Garden State Youth Correctional Facility, where she was the only female inmate, for &quot;security reasons&quot;. When Kunstler first took on Shakur&#x27;s case (before meeting her), he described her basement cell as &quot;adequate&quot;, which nearly resulted in his dismissal as her attorney. On May 6, 1977, Judge Clarkson Fisher, of the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, denied Shakur&#x27;s request for an injunction requiring her transfer from the all-male facility to Clinton Correctional Facility for Women; the Third Circuit affirmed.

On April 8, 1978, Shakur was transferred to Alderson Federal Prison Camp in Alderson, West Virginia, where she met Puerto Rican nationalist Lolita Lebrón and Mary Alice, a Catholic nun, who introduced Shakur to the concept of liberation theology. At Alderson, Shakur was housed in the Maximum Security Unit, which also contained several members of the Aryan Sisterhood as well as Sandra Good and Lynette Fromme, followers of Charles Manson.

On February 20, 1979, after the Maximum Security Unit at Alderson was closed, Shakur was transferred to the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey. According to her attorney Lennox Hinds, Shakur &quot;understates the awfulness of the condition in which she was incarcerated&quot;, which included vaginal and anal searches. Hinds argues that &quot;in the history of New Jersey, no woman pretrial detainee or prisoner has ever been treated as she was, continuously confined in a men&#x27;s prison, under twenty-four-hour surveillance of her most intimate functions, without intellectual sustenance, adequate medical attention, and exercise, and without the company of other women for all the years she was in custody&quot;.

Shakur was identified as a political prisoner as early as October 8, 1973, by Angela Davis, and in an April 3, 1977, &quot;The New York Times&quot; advertisement purchased by the &quot;Easter Coalition for Human Rights&quot;. An international panel of seven jurists were invited by Hinds to tour a number of U.S. prisons, and concluded in a report filed with the United Nations Commission on Human Rights that the conditions of her solitary confinement were &quot;totally unbefitting any prisoner&quot;. Their investigation, which focused on alleged human rights abuses of political prisoners, cited Shakur as &quot;one of the worst cases&quot; of such abuses and including her in &quot;a class of victims of FBI misconduct through the COINTELPRO strategy and other forms of illegal government conduct who as political activists have been selectively targeted for provocation, false arrests, entrapment, fabrication of evidence, and spurious criminal prosecutions&quot;. Amnesty International, however, did not regard Shakur as a former political prisoner.

==Escape==
In early 1979, &quot;the Family&quot;, a group of BLA members, began to plan Shakur&#x27;s escape from prison. They financed this by stealing $105,000 from a Bamberger&#x27;s store in Paramus, New Jersey. On November 2, 1979, Shakur escaped the Clinton Correctional Facility for Women in New Jersey when three members of the Black Liberation Army visiting her drew concealed .45-caliber pistols and a stick of dynamite, seized two correction officers as hostages, commandeered a van and (with the assistance of members of the May 19 Communist Organization) made their escape. No one was injured during the prison break, including the officers held as hostages who were left in a parking lot. According to later court testimony, Shakur lived in Pittsburgh until August 1980, when she flew to the Bahamas. Mutulu Shakur, Silvia Baraldini, Sekou Odinga, and Marilyn Buck were charged with assisting in her escape; Ronald Boyd Hill was also held on charges related to the escape. In part for his role in the event, Mutulu was named on July 23, 1982, as the 380th addition to the FBI&#x27;s Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list, where he remained for the next four years until his capture in 1986. State correction officials disclosed in November 1979 that they had not run identity checks on Shakur&#x27;s visitors and that the three men and one woman who assisted in her escape had presented false identification to enter the prison&#x27;s visitor room, before which they were not searched. Mutulu Shakur and Marilyn Buck were convicted in 1988 of several robberies as well as the prison escape.
At the time of the escape, Kunstler had just started to prepare her appeal. After her escape, Shakur lived as a fugitive for several years. The FBI circulated wanted posters throughout the New York–New Jersey area; her supporters hung &quot;Assata Shakur is Welcome Here&quot; posters in response. In New York, three days after her escape, more than 5,000 demonstrators organized by the National Black Human Rights Coalition carried signs with the same slogan. At the rally, a statement from Shakur was circulated condemning U.S. prison conditions and calling for an independent &quot;New Afrikan&quot; state.

For years after Shakur&#x27;s escape, the movements, activities and phone calls of her friends and relatives—including her daughter walking to school in upper Manhattan—were monitored by investigators in an attempt to ascertain her whereabouts. In July 1980, FBI director William H. Webster said that the search for Shakur had been frustrated by residents&#x27; refusal to cooperate, and a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial opined that the department&#x27;s commitment to &quot;enforce the law with vigor—but also with sensitivity for civil rights and civil liberties&quot; had been &quot;clouded&quot; by an &quot;apparently crude sweep&quot; through a Harlem building in search of Shakur. In particular, one pre-dawn April 20, 1980, raid on 92 Morningside Avenue, during which FBI agents armed with shotguns and machine guns broke down doors and searched through the building for several hours while preventing residents from leaving, was seen by residents as having &quot;racist overtones&quot;. In October 1980, New Jersey and New York City Police denied published reports that they had declined to raid a Bedford–Stuyvesant, Brooklyn building where Shakur was suspected to be hiding for fear of provoking a racial incident. Since her escape, Shakur has been charged with unlawful flight to avoid imprisonment.

==Political asylum in Cuba==
Shakur was in Cuba by 1984; in that year she was granted political asylum there. The Cuban government paid approximately $13 a day toward her living expenses. In 1985, her daughter, Kakuya, who had been raised by Shakur&#x27;s mother in New York, came to live with her. In 1987, her presence in Cuba became widely known when she agreed to be interviewed by &quot;Newsday&quot;.

In an open letter, Shakur has called Cuba &quot;One of the Largest, Most Resistant and Most Courageous &quot;Palenques&quot; (Maroon Camps) that has ever existed on the Face of this Planet&quot;. She has praised Fidel Castro as a &quot;hero of the oppressed&quot; and referred to herself as a &quot;20th century escaped slave&quot;. Shakur is also known to have worked as an English-language editor for Radio Havana Cuba.

===Books===
In 1987, she published &quot;&quot;, which was written in Cuba. Her autobiography has been cited in relation to critical legal studies and critical race theory. The book does not give a detailed account of her involvement in the BLA or the events on the New Jersey Turnpike, except to say that the jury &quot;[c]onvicted a woman with her hands up!&quot; It gives an account of her life beginning with her youth in the South and New York. Shakur challenges traditional styles of literary autobiography and offers a perspective on her life that is not easily accessible to the public. The book was published by Lawrence Hill &amp; Company in the United States and Canada but the copyright is held by Zed Books Ltd. of London due to &quot;Son of Sam&quot; laws, which restrict who can receive profits from a book. In the six months preceding the publications of the book, Evelyn Williams, Shakur&#x27;s aunt and attorney, made several trips to Cuba and served as a go-between with Hill. Her autobiography was republished in Britain in 2014 and a dramatized version performed on BBC Radio 4 in July 2017.

In 1993, she published a second book, &quot;Still Black, Still Strong&quot;, with Dhoruba bin Wahad and Mumia Abu-Jamal.

In 2005, SUNY Press released &quot;The New Abolitionists&quot; &quot;(Neo)Slave Narratives and Contemporary Prison Writings,&quot; edited and with an added introduction by Joy James, in which Shakur&#x27;s &quot;Women in Prison: How We Are 1978&quot; is featured.

===Extradition attempts===
In 1997, Carl Williams, the superintendent of the New Jersey State Police, wrote a letter to Pope John Paul II asking him to raise the issue of Shakur&#x27;s extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro. During the pope&#x27;s visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza. Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster&#x27;s grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted. On March 10, 1998 New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman asked U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno to do whatever it would take to return Shakur from Cuba. Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the United States State Department had offered to lift the Cuban embargo in exchange for the return of 90 U.S. fugitives, including Shakur.

The United States Congress passed a non-binding resolution in September 1998, asking Cuba for the return of Shakur as well as 90 fugitives believed by Congress to be residing in Cuba; House Concurrent Resolution 254 passed 371–0 in the House and by unanimous consent in the Senate. The Resolution was due in no small part to the lobbying efforts of Governor Whitman and New Jersey Representative Bob Franks. Before the passage of the Resolution, Franks stated: &quot;This escaped murderer now lives a comfortable life in Cuba and has launched a public relations campaign in which she attempts to portray herself as an innocent victim rather than a cold-blooded murderer.&quot;

In an open letter to Castro, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus Representative Maxine Waters of California later explained that many members of the Caucus (including herself) were against Shakur&#x27;s extradition but had mistakenly voted for the bill, which was placed on the accelerated suspension calendar, generally reserved for non-controversial legislation. In the letter, Waters explained her opposition, calling COINTELPRO &quot;illegal, clandestine political persecution.&quot;

On May 2, 2005, the 32nd anniversary of the Turnpike shootings, the FBI classified her as a domestic terrorist, increasing the reward for assistance in her capture to $1 million, the largest reward placed on an individual in the history of New Jersey. New Jersey State Police superintendent Rick Fuentes said &quot;she is now 120 pounds of money.&quot; The bounty announcement reportedly caused Shakur to &quot;drop out of sight&quot; after having previously lived relatively openly (including having her home telephone number listed in her local telephone directory).

New York City Councilman Charles Barron, a former Black Panther, has called for the bounty to be rescinded. The New Jersey State Police and Federal Bureau of Investigation each still have an agent officially assigned to her case. Calls for Shakur&#x27;s extradition increased following Fidel Castro&#x27;s 2006–2008 transfer of presidential duties; in a May 2005 television address, Castro had called Shakur a victim of racial persecution, saying &quot;They wanted to portray her as a terrorist, something that was an injustice, a brutality, an infamous lie.&quot; In 2013, the FBI announced it had added Shakur to its list of &#x27;Most Wanted Terrorists&#x27;, the first time that a woman was so designated. The reward for her capture and return was also doubled to $2 million.

In June 2017, President Donald Trump gave a speech &quot;cancelling&quot; the Cuban thaw policies of his predecessor Barack Obama. A condition of making a new deal between the United States and Cuba is the release of political prisoners and the return of fugitives from justice. Trump specifically called for the return of &quot;the cop-killer Joanne Chesimard&quot;.

==Cultural influence==
A documentary film about Shakur, &quot;Eyes of The Rainbow&quot;, written and directed by Cuban filmmaker Gloria Rolando, appeared in 1997. The official premiere of the film in Havana in 2004 was promoted by Casa de las Américas, the main cultural forum of the Cuban government. &quot;Assata aka Joanne Chesimard&quot; is a 2008 biographical film directed by Fred Baker. The film premiered at the San Diego Black Film Festival and starred Assata Shakur herself. The National Conference of Black Lawyers and Mos Def are among the professional organizations and entertainers to support Assata Shakur; the &quot;Hands Off Assata&quot; campaign is organized by Dream Hampton.

Numerous musicians have composed and recorded songs about her or dedicated to her:
*Common recorded &quot;A Song for Assata&quot; on his album &quot;Like Water for Chocolate&quot; (2000) after traveling to Havana to meet with Shakur personally.
*Nas listed her name in the booklet of his album &quot;Untitled,&quot; among important black figures who inspired the album. 
*Paris (&quot;Assata&#x27;s Song&quot;, in &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;, 1992) 
*Public Enemy (&quot;Rebel Without A Pause&quot; in &quot;It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back&quot;, 1988)
*2Pac (&quot;Words of Wisdom&quot; in &quot;2Pacalypse Now,&quot; 1991)
*Digital Underground (&quot;Heartbeat Props&quot; in &quot;Sons of the P&quot;, 1991)
*The Roots (&quot;The Adventures in Wonderland&quot; in &quot;Illadelph Halflife&quot;, 1996)
*Piebald (&quot;If Marcus Garvey Dies, Then Marcus Garvey Lives&quot; in &quot;If It Weren&#x27;t for Venetian Blinds, It Would Be Curtains for Us All&quot;, 1999)
*Asian Dub Foundation (&quot;Committed to Life&quot; in &quot;Community Music&quot;, 2000)
*Saul Williams (&quot;Black Stacey&quot; in &quot;Saul Williams&quot;, 2004)
*Rebel Diaz (&quot;Which Side Are You On?&quot; in &quot;Otro Guerrillero Mixtape Vol. 2&quot;, 2008)
* Lowkey (&quot;Something Wonderful&quot; in &quot;Soundtrack to the Struggle&quot;, 2011)
* Dead Prez (&quot;I Have A Dream, Too&quot; in &quot;&quot;, 2004)
*Murs (&quot;Tale of Two Cities&quot; in &quot;The Final Adventure&quot;, 2012)
*Jay Z (&quot;Open Letter Part II&quot; in 2013)
Digable Planets, The Underachievers and X-Clan have also recorded songs about Shakur. Shakur has been described as a &quot;rap music legend&quot; and a &quot;minor cause celebre&quot;.

On December 12, 2006, the Chancellor of the City University of New York, Matthew Goldstein, directed City College&#x27;s president, Gregory H. Williams, to remove the &quot;unauthorized and inappropriate&quot; designation of the &quot;Guillermo Morales/Assata Shakur Community and Student Center&quot;, which was named by students in 1989. A student group won the right to use the lounge after a campus shutdown over proposed tuition increases. CUNY was sued by student and alumni groups after removing the plaque. As of April 7, 2010, the presiding judge has ruled that the issues of students&#x27; free speech and administrators&#x27; immunity from suit &quot;deserve a trial&quot;.

Following controversy, in 1995, Borough of Manhattan Community College renamed a scholarship that had previously been named for Shakur. In 2008, a Bucknell University professor included Shakur in a course on &quot;African-American heroes&quot;—along with figures such as Harriet Tubman, Sojourner Truth, John Henry, Malcolm X, and Angela Davis. Her autobiography is studied together with those of Angela Davis and Elaine Brown, the only women activists of the Black Power movement who have published book-length autobiographies. Rutgers University professor H. Bruce Franklin, who excerpts Shakur&#x27;s book in a class on &quot;Crime and Punishment in American Literature,&quot; describes her as a &quot;revolutionary fighter against imperialism.&quot;

Black NJ State Trooper Anthony Reed (who has left the force) sued the police force because, among other things, persons had hung posters of Shakur, altered to include Reed&#x27;s badge number, in a Newark barracks. He felt it was intended to insult him, as she had killed an officer, and that the act was &quot;racist in nature&quot;. According to academic Dylan Rodriguez, to many &quot;U.S. radicals and revolutionaries&quot; Shakur represents a &quot;venerated (if sometimes fetishized) signification of liberatory desire and possibility&quot;.

The largely Internet-based &quot;Hands Off Assata!&quot; campaign is coordinated by Chicago-area Black Radical Congress activists.

In 2015, New Jersey&#x27;s Kean University dropped hip-hop artist Common as a commencement speaker because of police complaints. Members of the State Troopers Fraternal Association of New Jersey expressed their anger over Common&#x27;s &quot;A Song For Assata&quot;.

In 2015, Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation co-founder Alicia Garza writes: &quot;When I use Assata&#x27;s powerful demand in my organizing work, I always begin by sharing where it comes from, sharing about Assata&#x27;s significance to the Black Liberation Movement, what its political purpose and message is, and why it&#x27;s important in our context.&quot;

The Chicago Black activist group Assata&#x27;s Daughters is named in her honor. In April 2017, former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick&#x27;s foundation donated $25,000 to the group.

In July 2017, the Women&#x27;s March official Twitter feed celebrated Shakur&#x27;s birthday, leading to criticism from some media outlets.

In April 2018, a North Carolina court ordered that payment of $15,000 be made to Shakur&#x27;s representative, her sister Beverly Goins, as part of a land deal.

Reigning over her kingdom from a large red brick mansion, complete with a roaring fireplace, oak-paneled built-in bookcases, and leather armchairs, Big Cat is the kind of baddie who cuts the thumbs off of men who cross her with her own shears in one scene, then uses the hot bodies of her underlings for sexual pleasure in the next. And MacDowell savors every line. A southern broad herself, she knows the power of a whisper and a threat veiled in niceties.&quot;

<text>A Jakarta Servlet, formerly Java Servlet is a Java software component that extends the capabilities of a server. Although servlets can respond to many types of requests, they most commonly implement web containers for hosting web applications on web servers and thus qualify as a server-side servlet web API. Such web servlets are the Java counterpart to other dynamic web content technologies such as PHP and ASP.NET.

== Introduction ==
A Jakarta Servlet is a Java class in Jakarta EE that conforms to the Jakarta Servlet API, a standard for implementing Java classes that respond to requests. Servlets could in principle communicate over any client–server protocol, but they are most often used with HTTP. In principle, any servlets can extend the class; however, realistically speaking, all servlets extend the class. Thus &quot;servlet&quot; is often used as shorthand for &quot;HTTP servlet&quot;. Thus, a servlet can be used to add dynamic content to a web server using the Java platform. The generated content is commonly HTML, but may be other data such as XML and more commonly, JSON. 

The Jakarta Servlet API has, to some extent, been superseded by two standard Java technologies for web services: 
* the Jakarta RESTful Web Services (JAX-RS 2.0) useful for AJAX, JSON and REST services, and
* the Jakarta XML Web Services (JAX-WS) useful for SOAP Web Services.

A is an object that receives a request and generates a response based on that request. The basic codice_1 package defines Java objects to represent servlet requests and responses, as well as objects to reflect the servlet&#x27;s configuration parameters and execution environment.

The Servlet API, contained in the Java package hierarchy , defines the expected interactions of the web container and a servlet.

The package defines HTTP-specific subclasses of the codice_2. This package includes session management objects that track multiple requests and responses between the web server and a client.

Servlets can maintain state in session variables across many server transactions by using HTTP cookies, or URL mapping. There are several ways of creating a servlet and using URL mapping with a servlet. Before servlet 3.0 specification (Tomcat 7.0), configuring the web.xml to map a servlet to a URL was the only option. For applications using the servlet 3.0 specification or later, the codice_3 annotation can be used to map any servlet to one or more URL patterns.

Servlets may be packaged in a WAR file as a web application. 

A web container is required for deploying and running a servlet. A web container (also known as a servlet container) is essentially the component of a web server that interacts with the servlets. The web container is responsible for managing the lifecycle of servlets, mapping a URL to a particular servlet and ensuring that the URL requester has the correct access rights.

Servlets can be generated automatically from Jakarta Server Pages (JSP) by the Jakarta Server Pages compiler. The difference between servlets and JSP is that servlets typically embed HTML inside Java code, while JSPs embed Java code in HTML. In general, when using JSPs, embedding Java code in JSP is considered bad practice. Instead, a better approach would be to move the back-end logic from the JSP to the Java code in the codice_1. This ensures that the codice_1 is only responsible for processing, and the JSP is only responsible for presenting the HTML, allowing for a clear separation of concerns and conformance to the single-responsibility principle.

While the direct usage of servlets to generate HTML (as shown in the example below) has become rare, the higher level MVC web framework in Jakarta EE (Faces) still explicitly uses the servlet technology for the low level request/response handling via the . 

A somewhat older usage is to use servlets in conjunction with JSPs in a pattern called &quot;Model 2&quot;, which is a flavor of the model–view–controller.

== History ==
The Java Servlet API was first publicly announced at the inaugural JavaOne conference in May 1996. About two months after the announcements at the conference, the first public implementation was made available on the JavaSoft website. This was the first alpha of the Java Web Server (JWS; then known by its codename &quot;Jeeves&quot;) which would eventually be shipped as a product on June 5, 1997.

In his blog on java.net, Sun veteran and GlassFish lead Jim Driscoll details the history of servlet technology. James Gosling first thought of servlets in the early days of Java, but the concept did not become a product until December 1996 when Sun shipped JWS. This was before what is now the Jakarta EE was made into a specification.

The Servlet1 specification was created by Pavni Diwanji while she worked at Sun Microsystems, with version 1.0 finalized in June 1997. Starting with version 2.2, the specification was developed under the Java Community Process.

== Life cycle of a servlet ==
Three methods are central to the life cycle of a servlet. These are codice_6, codice_7, and codice_8.
They are implemented by every servlet and are invoked at specific times by the server.

* During initialization stage of the servlet life cycle, the web container initializes the servlet instance by calling the codice_6 method, passing an object implementing the codice_10 interface. This configuration object allows the servlet to access name-value initialization parameters from the web application.
* After initialization, the servlet instance can service client requests. Each request is serviced in its own separate thread. The web container calls the codice_7 method of the servlet for every request. The codice_7 method determines the kind of request being made and dispatches it to an appropriate method to handle the request. The developer of the servlet must provide an implementation for these methods. If a request is made for a method that is not implemented by the servlet, the method of the parent class is called, typically resulting in an error being returned to the requester.
* Finally, the web container calls the codice_8 method that takes the servlet out of service. The codice_8 method, like codice_6, is called only once in the lifecycle of a servlet.

The following is a typical user scenario of these methods.
# Assume that a user requests to visit a URL.
#* The browser then generates an HTTP request for this URL.
#* This request is then sent to the appropriate server.
# The HTTP request is received by the web server and forwarded to the servlet container.
#* The container maps this request to a particular servlet.
#* The servlet is dynamically retrieved and loaded into the address space of the container.
# The container invokes the codice_6 method of the servlet.
#* This method is invoked only when the servlet is first loaded into memory.
#* It is possible to pass initialization parameters to the servlet so that it may configure itself.
# The container invokes the codice_7 method of the servlet.
#* This method is called to process the HTTP request.
#* The servlet may read data that has been provided in the HTTP request.
#* The servlet may also formulate an HTTP response for the client.
# The servlet remains in the container&#x27;s address space and is available to process any other HTTP requests received from clients.
#* The codice_7 method is called for each HTTP request.
# The container may, at some point, decide to unload the servlet from its memory.
#* The algorithms by which this decision is made are specific to each container.
# The container calls the servlet&#x27;s codice_8 method to relinquish any resources such as file handles that are allocated for the servlet; important data may be saved to a persistent store.
# The memory allocated for the servlet and its objects can then be garbage collected.

== Example ==
The following example servlet prints how many times its codice_7 method was called.

Note that codice_21 is a subclass of codice_2, an implementation of the codice_1 interface.

The codice_7 method of codice_21 class dispatches requests to the methods codice_26, codice_27, codice_28, codice_29, and so on; according to the HTTP request. In the example below codice_7 is overridden and does not distinguish which HTTP request method it serves.

import java.io.IOException;

import jakarta.servlet.ServletConfig;
import jakarta.servlet.ServletException;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import jakarta.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class ServletLifeCycleExample extends HttpServlet {
 private Integer sharedCounter;

 @Override
 public void init(final ServletConfig config) throws ServletException {
 super.init(config);
 getServletContext().log(&quot;init() called&quot;);
 sharedCounter = 0;

 @Override
 protected void service(final HttpServletRequest request, final HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
 getServletContext().log(&quot;service() called&quot;);
 int localCounter;
 synchronized (sharedCounter) {
 sharedCounter++;
 localCounter = sharedCounter;
 response.getWriter().write(&quot;Incrementing the count to &quot; + localCounter); // accessing a local variable
 response.getWriter().flush(); // flush response

 @Override
 public void destroy() {
 getServletContext().log(&quot;destroy() called&quot;);
}
== Container servers ==
The specification for Servlet technology has been implemented in many products. See a list of implementations on the web container page.

There are also other types of servlet containers such as those for SIP servlets, e.g., SailFin.

<text>Year 179 ([[Roman numerals|CLXXIX]]) was a common year starting on Thursday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Aurelius and Veru (or, less frequently, year 932 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 179 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
=== By place ===
==== Roman empire ====
* The Roman fort Castra Regina (&quot;fortress by the Regen river&quot;) is built at Regensburg, on the right bank of the Danube in Germany.
* Roman legionaries of Legio II &quot;Adiutrix&quot; engrave on the rock of the Trenčín Castle (Slovakia) the name of the town &quot;Laugaritio&quot;, marking the northernmost point of Roman presence in that part of Europe.
* Marcus Aurelius drives the Marcomanni over the Danube and reinforces the border. To repopulate and rebuild a devastated Pannonia, Rome allows the first German colonists to enter territory controlled by the Roman Empire.

==== Asia ====
* Abgar IX the Great becomes King of Edessa.
* Gogukcheon succeeds his father Shindae as King of Goguryeo.
* Han dynasty China: The full title of the &quot;Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art&quot; appears on two bronze standard measures dated to this year, yet there is speculation that the same book existed beforehand only under different titles. In the 3rd century, Liu Hui would provide commentary on this important early Chinese mathematical treatise.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Pang Tong, Chinese adviser of warlord Liu Bei (d. 214)
* Sima Yi, Chinese general and regent (d. 251)

== Deaths ==
* Beautiful Lady Yu, Chinese concubine and imperial consort
* Myeongnim Dap-bu, Korean prime minister (b. AD 67)
* Sindae of Goguryeo, Korean ruler (b. AD 89)

<doc id="43839" wikidata="Q7420601" url="?curid=43839" title="Santorum Amendment">
<text>The Santorum Amendment was a failed proposed amendment to the 2001 education funding bill (which became known as the No Child Left Behind Act) that promoted the teaching of intelligent design while questioning the academic standing of evolution in US public schools. (It was proposed by Republican Rick Santorum, then a United States Senator for Pennsylvania.) In response, a coalition of 96 scientific and educational organizations wrote a letter to the conference committee, urging that the amendment be stricken from the final bill and arguing that evolution is regarded as fact in the scientific fields and that the amendment creates the misperception of evolution not being fully accepted in the scientific community and thus weakening science education. The words of the amendment survive in modified form in the bill&#x27;s conference committee report but do not carry the weight of law. As one of the Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns it became a cornerstone in the intelligent design movement&#x27;s &quot;teach the controversy&quot; campaign.

==History==
The origin of the amendment can be traced back to 2000, when leading intelligent design (ID) proponents through the Discovery Institute, a conservative Christian think tank that is the hub of the intelligent design movement, held a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., to promote their agenda to lawmakers. Sen. Rick Santorum was one of intelligent design&#x27;s most vocal supporters on Capitol Hill.

One result of this briefing was that in 2001 Senator Santorum proposed incorporating pro-intelligent design language, crafted in part by the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture, into the No Child Left Behind bill. It portrayed evolution as generating &quot;much continuing controversy&quot; and not widely accepted, using the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Teach the Controversy method.

In proposing the amendment, Santorum addressed the Congress:

Santorum then went on to quote David DeWolf, a Senior Fellow of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture, as how the Institute&#x27;s agenda was justified and would benefit students.

Phillip E. Johnson, retired UC Berkeley law professor, leading proponent of intelligent design, founding advisor of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture, and &quot;father&quot; of the intelligent design movement, assisted Santorum in phrasing the amendment. Johnson says that he is the author of the original amendment.

On June 14, 2001, the amendment was passed as part of the education funding bill by the Senate on a vote of 91-8. This was hailed as a major victory by proponents of intelligent design and other creationists; for instance an email newsletter by the Discovery Institute contained the sentence &quot;Undoubtedly this will change the face of the debate over the theories of evolution and intelligent design in America ... It also seems that the Darwinian monopoly on public science education, and perhaps the biological sciences in general, is ending.&quot; Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas cited the amendment as vindicating the 1999 Kansas school board decision (since overturned) to eliminate evolution questions from state tests.

The House version of the bill H.R. 1 did not contain the amendment, which meant that a conference committee had to decide its ultimate fate.

Scientists and educators feared that by singling out biological evolution as very controversial, the amendment could create the impression that a substantial scientific controversy about evolution exists, leading to a lessening of academic rigor in science curricula. A coalition of 96 scientific and educational organizations signed a letter to this effect to the conference committee, urging that the amendment be stricken from the final bill, which it was, but intelligent design supporters on the conference committee preserved it in the bill&#x27;s legislative history.

While the amendment did not become law, a version of it appears in the Conference Report as an explanatory text about the legislative history and purposes of the bill. However, it has no legal force per se. The final text of the Santorum Amendment as included in the Conference Report reads:

Despite the amendment lacking the weight of law, the conference report is constantly cited by the Discovery Institute and other ID supporters as providing federal sanction for intelligent design. In response to criticisms of the Institute stating that the amendment was a federal education policy requiring inclusion of alternatives to evolution be taught, which it was not, in 2003 intelligent design&#x27;s three most prominent legislators, John Boehner, Judd Gregg and Santorum provided a letter to the Discovery Institute giving it the go ahead to invoke the amendment as evidence of &quot;Congress&#x27;s rejection of the idea that students only need to learn about the dominant scientific view of controversial topics&quot;. This letter was also sent to executives on the Ohio Board of Education and the Texas Board of Education, both of which were subject to Discovery Institute intelligent design campaigns at the time.

==Scientific community&#x27;s response==
The position of scientists and science educators has been that although evolution has generated a great deal of political and philosophical debate it is, in the scientific fields, regarded as fact. They said that the amendment creates a misperception that evolution is not fully accepted in the scientific community, and thus weakens science curricula. As a response, a coalition of 96 scientific and educational organizations wrote a letter to the conference committee, urging that the amendment be stricken from the final bill.

In addition, opponents of the amendment cite the stated agenda of the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Phillip Johnson use of the &quot;Wedge strategy&quot; to &quot;affirm the reality of God by challenging the domination of materialism and naturalism in the world of the mind&quot; and thereby return Christian creationism in the guise of intelligent design to public school classrooms. Along with the Academic Bill of Rights, the Santorum Amendment and its &quot;Teach the Controversy&quot; approach is viewed by some academics as a threat to academic freedom.

<text>Organ donation is the process when a person authorizes an organ of their own to be removed and transplanted to another person, legally, either by consent while the donor is alive, through a legal authorization for deceased donation made prior to death, or for deceased donations through the authorization by the legal next of kin.

Donation may be for research or, more commonly, healthy transplantable organs and tissues may be donated to be transplanted into another person.

Common transplantations include kidneys, heart, liver, pancreas, intestines, lungs, bones, bone marrow, skin, and corneas. Some organs and tissues can be donated by living donors, such as a kidney or part of the liver, part of the pancreas, part of the lungs or part of the intestines, but most donations occur after the donor has died.

In 2019, Spain had the highest donor rate in the world at 46.91 per million people, followed by the US (36.88 per million), Croatia (34.63 per million), Portugal (33.8 per million), and France (33.25 per million).

As of February 2, 2019, there were 120,000 people waiting for life-saving organ transplants in the United States. Of these, 74,897 people were active candidates waiting for a donor. While views of organ donation are positive, there is a large gap between the numbers of registered donors compared to those awaiting organ donations on a global level.

To increase the number of organ donors, especially among underrepresented populations, current approaches include the use of optimized social network interventions, exposing tailored educational content about organ donation to target social media users. August 13 is observed as World Organ Donation Day to raise awareness about the importance of organ donation.

==Process in the United States==
Organ donors are usually dead at the time of donation, but may be living. For living donors, organ donation typically involves extensive testing before the donation, including psychological evaluation to determine whether the would-be donor understands and consents to the donation. On the day of the donation, the donor and the recipient arrive at the hospital, just like they would for any other major surgery.

For dead donors, the process begins with verifying that the person is undoubtedly deceased, determining whether any organs could be donated, and obtaining consent for the donation of any usable organs. Normally, nothing is done until the person has already died, although if death is inevitable, it is possible to check for consent and to do some simple medical tests shortly beforehand, to help find a matching recipient.

The verification of death is normally done by a neurologist (a physician specializing in brain function) that is not involved in the previous attempts to save the patient&#x27;s life. This physician has nothing to do with the transplantation process. Verification of death is often done multiple times, to prevent doctors from overlooking any remaining sign of life, however small. After death, the hospital may keep the body on a mechanical ventilator and use other methods to keep the organs in good condition. The donor&#x27;s estate and their families are not charged for any expenses related to the donation.

The surgical process depends upon which organs are being donated. The body is normally restored to as normal an appearance as possible, so that the family can proceed with funeral rites and either cremation or burial.

The lungs are highly vulnerable to injury and thus the most difficult to preserve, with only 15–25% of donated organs used.

==History==

The first living organ donor in a successful transplant was Ronald Lee Herrick (1931–2010), who donated a kidney to his identical twin brother Richard (1931–1963) in 1954. The lead surgeon, Joseph Murray, and the nephrologist, John Merrill, won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1990 for advances in organ transplantation.

The youngest organ donor was a baby with anencephaly, born in 2014, who lived for only 100 minutes and donated his kidneys to an adult with renal failure. The oldest known cornea donor was a 107-year-old Scottish woman, whose corneas were donated after her death in 2016. The oldest known organ donor for an internal organ was a 98-year-old southern Missouri man, who donated his liver after he died.

The oldest altruistic living organ donor was an 85-year-old woman in Britain, who donated a kidney to a stranger in 2014 after hearing how many people needed to receive a transplant.

Researchers were able to develop a novel way to transplant human fetal kidneys into anephric rats to overcome a significant obstacle in impeding human fetal organ transplantations. The human fetal kidneys demonstrated both growth and function within the rats.

==Brain donation==
Donated brain tissue is a valuable resource for research into brain function, neurodiversity, neuropathology and possible treatments. Both divergent and healthy control brains are needed for comparison. Brain banks typically source tissue from donors who had registered with them before their death, since organ donor registries focus on tissue meant for transplantation. In the United States the nonprofit Brain Donor Project facilitates this process.

==Legislation and global perspectives==

The laws of different countries allow potential donors to permit or refuse donation, or give this choice to relatives. The frequency of donations varies among countries.

===Consent process===
The term consent is typically defined as a subject adhering to an agreement of principles and regulations; however, the definition becomes difficult to execute concerning the topic of organ donation, mainly because the subject is incapable of consent due to death or mental impairment. There are two types of consent being reviewed; explicit consent and presumed consent. Explicit consent consists of the donor giving direct consent through proper registration depending on the country. The second consent process is presumed consent, which does not need direct consent from the donor or the next of kin. Presumed consent assumes that donation would have been permitted by the potential donor if permission was pursued. Of possible donors an estimated twenty-five percent of families refuse to donate a loved one&#x27;s organs.

====Opt-in versus opt-out====
As medical science advances, the number of people who could be helped by organ donors increases continuously. As opportunities to save lives increase with new technologies and procedures, the demand for organ donors rises faster than the actual number of donors. To respect individual autonomy, voluntary consent must be determined for the individual&#x27;s disposition of their remains following death. There are two main methods for determining voluntary consent: &quot;opt in&quot; (only those who have given explicit consent are donors) and &quot;opt out&quot; (anyone who has not refused consent to donate is a donor). In terms of an opt-out or presumed consent system, it is assumed that individuals do intend to donate their organs to medical use when they expire. Opt-out legislative systems dramatically increase effective rates of consent for donation as a consequence of the default effect. For example, Germany, which uses an opt-in system, has an organ donation consent rate of 12% among its population, while Austria, a country with a very similar culture and economic development, but which uses an opt-out system, has a consent rate of 99.98%.

Opt-out consent, otherwise known as &quot;deemed&quot; consent, support refers to the notion that the majority of people support organ donation, but only a small percentage of the population are actually registered, because they fail to go through the actual step of registration, even if they want to donate their organs at the time of death. This could be resolved with an opt-out system, where many more people would be registered as donors when only those who object consent to donation have to register to be on the non-donation list.

For these reasons, countries, such as Wales, have adopted a &quot;soft opt-out&quot; consent, meaning if a citizen has not clearly made a decision to register, then they will be treated as a registered citizen and participate in the organ donation process. Likewise, opt-in consent refers to the consent process of only those who are registered to participate in organ donation. Currently, the United States has an opt-in system, but studies show that countries with an opt-out system save more lives due to more availability of donated organs. The current opt-in consent policy assumes that individuals are not willing to become organ donors at the time of their death, unless they have documented otherwise through organ donation registration.

Registering to become an organ donor heavily depends on the attitude of the individual; those with a positive outlook might feel a sense of altruism towards organ donation, while others may have a more negative perspective, such as not trusting doctors to work as hard to save the lives of registered organ donors. Some common concerns regarding a presumed consent (&quot;opt-out&quot;) system are sociologic fears of a new system, moral objection, sentimentality, and worries of the management of the objection registry for those who do decide to opt-out of donation. Additional concerns exist with views of compromising the freedom of choice to donate, conflicts with extant religious beliefs and the possibility of posthumous violations of bodily integrity. Even though concerns exist, the United States still has a 95 percent organ donation approval rate. This level of nationwide acceptance may foster an environment where moving to a policy of presumed consent may help solve some of the organ shortage problem, where individuals are assumed to be willing organ donors unless they document a desire to &quot;opt-out&quot;, which must be respected.

Because of public policies, cultural, infrastructural and other factors, presumed consent or opt-out models do not always translate directly into increased effective rates of donation. The United Kingdom has several different laws and policies for the organ donation process, such as consent of a witness or guardian must be provided to participate in organ donation. This policy was consulted on by Department of Health and Social Care in 2018, and was implemented starting May 20, 2020.

In terms of effective organ donations, in some systems like Australia (14.9 donors per million, 337 donors in 2011), family members are required to give consent or refusal, or may veto a potential recovery even if the donor has consented. Some countries with an opt-out system like Spain (40.2 donors per million inhabitants), Croatia (40.2 donors/million) or Belgium (31.6 donors/million) have high donor rates, however some countries such as Greece (6 donors/million) maintain low donor rates even with this system. The president of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation has acknowledged Spain&#x27;s legislative approach is likely not the primary reason for the country&#x27;s success in increasing the donor rates, starting in the 1990s.

Looking to the example of Spain, which has successfully adopted the presumed consent donation system, intensive care units (ICUs) must be equipped with enough doctors to maximize the recognition of potential donors and maintain organs while families are consulted for donation. The characteristic that enables the Spanish presumed consent model to be successful is the resource of transplant coordinators; it is recommended to have at least one at each hospital where opt-out donation is practiced to authorize organ procurement efficiently.

Public views are crucial to the success of opt-out or presumed consent donation systems. In a study done to determine if health policy change to a presumed consent or opt-out system would help to increase donors, an increase of 20 to 30 percent was seen among countries who changed their policies from some type of opt-in system to an opt-out system. Of course, this increase must have a great deal to do with the health policy change, but also may be influenced by other factors that could have impacted donor increases.

Transplant Priority for Willing Donors, also known as the &quot;donor-priority rule&quot;, is a newer method and the first to incorporate a &quot;non-medical&quot; criterion into the priority system to encourage higher donation rates in the opt-in system. Initially implemented in Israel, it allows an individual in need of an organ to move up the recipient list. Moving up the list is contingent on the individual opting-in prior to their need for an organ donation. The policy applies nonmedical criteria when allowing individuals who have previously registered as an organ donor, or whose family has previously donated an organ, priority over other possible recipients. It must be determined that both recipients have identical medical needs prior to moving a recipient up the list. While incentives like this in the opt-in system do help raise donation rates, they are not as successful in doing so as the opt-out, presumed consent default policies for donation.
===Argentina===
On November 30, 2005, the Congress introduced an opt-out policy on organ donation, where all people over 18 years of age will be organ donors unless they or their family state otherwise. The law was promulgated on December 22, 2005, as &quot;Law 26,066&quot;.

On July 4, 2018, the Congress passed a law removing the family requirement, making the organ donor the only person that can block donation. It was promulgated on July 4, 2018, as Law Justina or &quot;Law 27,447&quot;.

===Brazil===
A campaign by Sport Club Recife has led to waiting lists for organs in north-east Brazil to drop almost to zero; while according to the Brazilian law the family has the ultimate authority, the issuance of the organ donation card and the ensuing discussions have however eased the process.

===Canada===
In 2001, the Government of Canada announced the formation of the Canadian Council for Donation and Transplantation, whose purpose would be to advise the Conference of Deputy Ministers of Health on activities relating to organ donation and transplantation. The deputy ministers of health for all provinces and territories with the exception of Québec decided to transfer the responsibilities of the Canadian Council for Donation and Transplantation to Canadian Blood Services.

In Québec, an organization called Transplant Québec is responsible for managing all organ donation; Héma-Québec is responsible for tissue donation. Consent for organ donation by an individual is given by either registering with the organ donation registry established by the , signing and affixing the sticker to the back of one&#x27;s health insurance card, or registering with either or .

 In 2017, the majority of transplants completed were kidney transplants. Canadian Blood Services has a program called the kidney paired donation, where transplant candidates are matched with compatible living donors from all over Canada. It also gives individuals an opportunity to be a living donor for an anonymous patient waiting for a transplant. As of December 31, 2017, there were 4,333 patients on the transplant waitlist. In 2017, there were a total of 2,979 transplants, including multi-organ transplants; 242 patients died while on the waitlist. 250 Canadians die on average waiting for transplant organs every year.

Each province has different methods and registries for intent to donate organs or tissues as a deceased donor. In some provinces, such as Newfoundland and Labrador and New Brunswick organ donation registration is completed by completing the &quot;Intent to donate&quot; section when applying or renewing one&#x27;s provincial medical care. In Ontario, one must be 16 years of age to register as an organ and tissue donor and register with ServiceOntario. Alberta requires that a person must be 18 years of age or older and register with the Alberta Organ and Tissue Donation Registry.

====Opt-out donation in Canada====
Nova Scotia, Canada, is the first jurisdiction in North America to introduce an automatic organ donation program unless residents opt out; what the province refers to as deemed consent. The Human Organ and Tissue Act was introduced on April 2, 2019. With the legislation, all people who have been Nova Scotia residents for a minimum of 12 consecutive months, with appropriate decision-making capacity and are over 18 years of age are considered potential donors and will be automatically referred to donation programs if they are determined to be good candidates. In the case of persons under 18 years of age and people without appropriate decision-making capacity, they will only be considered as organ donors if their parent, guardian or decision-maker opts them into the program. The legislation took effect on January 18, 2021.

===Chile===
On January 6, 2010, the &quot;Law 20,413&quot; was promulgated, introducing an opt-out policy on organ donation, where all people over 18 years of age will be organ donors unless they state their negative.

===Colombia===
On August 4, 2016, the Congress passed the &quot;Law 1805&quot;, which introduced an opt-out policy on organ donation where all people will be organ donors unless they state their negative. The law came into force on February 4, 2017.

===Europe===

Within the European Union, organ donation is regulated by member states. As of 2010, 24 European countries have some form of presumed consent (opt-out) system, with the most prominent and limited opt-out systems in Spain, Austria, and Belgium yielding high donor rates. Spain had the highest donor rate in the world, 46.9 per million people in the population, in 2017. This is attributed to multiple factors in the Spanish medical system, including identification and early referral of possible donors, expanding criteria for donors and standardised frameworks for transplantation after circulatory death.

In England, individuals who wish to donate their organs after death can use the Organ Donation Register, a national database. The government of Wales became the first constituent country in the UK to adopt presumed consent in July 2013. The opt-out organ donation scheme in Wales went live on December 1, 2015, and is expected to increase the number of donors by 25%. In 2008, the UK discussed whether to switch to an opt-out system in light of the success in other countries and a severe British organ donor shortfall. In Italy if the deceased neither allowed nor refused donation while alive, relatives will pick the decision on his or her behalf despite a 1999 act that provided for a proper opt-out system. In 2008, the European Parliament overwhelmingly voted for an initiative to introduce an EU organ donor card to foster organ donation in Europe.

Landstuhl Regional Medical Center (LRMC) has become one of the most active organ donor hospitals in all of Germany, which otherwise has one of the lowest organ donation participation rates in the Eurotransplant organ network. LRMC, the largest U.S. military hospital outside the United States, is one of the top hospitals for organ donation in the Rhineland-Palatinate state of Germany, even though it has relatively few beds compared to many German hospitals. According to the German organ transplantation organization, (DSO), 34 American military service members who died at LRMC (roughly half of the total number who died there) donated a total of 142 organs between 2005 and 2010. In 2010 alone, 10 of the 12 American service members who died at LRMC were donors, donating a total of 45 organs. Of the 205 hospitals in the DSO&#x27;s central region—which includes the large cities of Frankfurt and Mainz—only six had more organ donors than LRMC in 2010.

Scotland conforms to the Human Tissue Authority Code of Practice, which grants authority to donate organs, instead of consent of the individual. This helps to avoid conflict of implications and contains several requirements. To participate in organ donation, one must be listed on the Organ Donor Registry (ODR). If the subject is incapable of providing consent, and is not on the ODR, then an acting representative, such as a legal guardian or family member can give legal consent for organ donation of the subject, along with a presiding witness, according to the Human Tissue Authority Code of Practice. Consent or refusal from a spouse, family member, or relative is necessary for a subject is incapable.

Austria participates in the &quot;opt-out&quot; consent process, and have laws that make organ donation the default option at the time of death. In this case, citizens must explicitly &quot;opt out&quot; of organ donation. Yet in countries such as U.S.A. and Germany, people must explicitly &quot;opt in&quot; if they want to donate their organs when they die. In Germany and Switzerland there are Organ Donor Cards available.

In May 2017, Ireland began the process of introducing an &quot;opt-out&quot; system for organ donation. Minister for Health, Simon Harris, outlined his expectations to have the Human Tissue Bill passed by the end of 2017. This bill would put in place the system of &quot;presumed consent&quot;.

The Mental Capacity Act is another legal policy in place for organ donation in the UK. The act is used by medical professionals to declare a patient&#x27;s mental capacity. The act claims that medical professionals are to &quot;act in a patient&#x27;s best interest&quot;, when the patient is unable to do so.

===India===

India has a fairly well developed corneal donation programme; however, donation after brain death has been relatively slow to take off. Most of the transplants done in India are living related or unrelated transplants. To curb organ commerce and promote donation after brain death the government enacted a law called &quot;The Transplantation of Human Organs Act&quot; in 1994 that brought about a significant change in the organ donation and transplantation scene in India. Many Indian states have adopted the law and in 2011 further amendment of the law took place. Despite the law there have been stray instances of organ trade in India and these have been widely reported in the press. This resulted in the amendment of the law further in 2011. Deceased donation after brain death have slowly started happening in India and 2012 was the best year for the programme.

* Source the Indian Transplant News Letter of the MOHAN Foundation

The year 2013 has been the best yet for deceased organ donation in India. A total of 845 organs were retrieved from 310 multi-organ donors resulting in a national organ donation rate of 0.26 per million population(Table 2).

* ODR (pmp) – Organ Donation Rate (per million population)

In the year 2000 through the efforts of a non-governmental organization called MOHAN Foundation state of Tamil Nadu started an organ sharing network between a few hospitals. The MOHAN Foundation also set up similar sharing network in the state of Andhra Pradesh and these two states were at the forefront of deceased donation and transplantation programme for many years. As a result, retrieval of 1,033 organs and tissues were facilitated in these two states.

Similar sharing networks came up in the states of Maharashtra and Karnataka; however, the numbers of deceased donation happening in these states were not sufficient to make much impact. In 2008, the Government of Tamil Nadu put together government orders laying down procedures and guidelines for deceased organ donation and transplantation in the state. These brought in almost thirty hospitals in the programme and has resulted in significant increase in the donation rate in the state. With an organ donation rate of 1.15 per million population, Tamil Nadu is the leader in deceased organ donation in the country. The small success of Tamil Nadu model has been possible due to the coming together of both government and private hospitals, non-governmental organizations and the State Health Department. Most of the deceased donation programmes have been developed in southern states of India. The various such programmes are as follows:

In the year 2012 besides Tamil Nadu other southern states too did deceased donation transplants more frequently. An online organ sharing registry for deceased donation and transplantation is used by the states of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Both these registries have been developed, implemented and maintained by MOHAN Foundation. However. National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization (NOTTO) is a National level organization set up under Directorate General of Health Services, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India and only official organization.

Organ selling is legally banned in Asia. Numerous studies have documented that organ vendors have a poor &quot;quality of life&quot; (QOL) following kidney donation. However, a study done by Vemuru reddy &quot;et al&quot; shows a significant improvement in Quality of life contrary to the earlier belief. Live related renal donors have a significant improvement in the QOL following renal donation using the WHO QOL BREF in a study done at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences from 2006 to 2008. The quality of life of the donor was poor when the graft was lost or the recipient died.

In India, there are six types of life saving organs that can be donated to save the life of a patient. These include Kidneys, Liver, Heart, Lungs, Pancreas and Intestine. Off late, uterus transplant has also been started in India. However, uterus is not a life saving organ as per the Transplantation of Human Organs Act (2011).
Recently a scoring system, Seth-Donation of Organs and Tissues (S-DOT) score, has been developed to assess hospitals for best practices in tissue donation and organ donation after brain death.

===Iran===
Only one country, Iran has eliminated the shortage of transplant organs—and only Iran has a working and legal payment system for organ donation. It is also the only country where organ trade is legal. The way their system works is, if a patient does not have a living relative or who are not assigned an organ from a deceased donor, apply to the nonprofit Dialysis and Transplant Patients Association (Datpa). The association establishes potential donors, those donors are assessed by transplant doctors who are not affiliated with the Datpa association. The government gives a compensation of $1,200 to the donors and aid them a year of limited health-insurance. Additionally, working through Datpa, kidney recipients pay donors between $2,300 and $4,500. Importantly, it is illegal for the medical and surgical teams involved or any &#x27;middleman&#x27; to receive payment. Charity donations are made to those donors whose recipients are unable to pay. The Iranian system began in 1988 and eliminated the shortage of kidneys by 1999. Within the first year of the establishment of this system, the number of transplants had almost doubled; nearly four-fifths were from living unrelated sources. Nobel Laureate economist Gary Becker and Julio Elias estimated that a payment of $15,000 for living donors would alleviate the shortage of kidneys in the U.S.

===Israel===

Since 2008, signing an organ donor card in Israel has provided a potential medical benefit to the signer. If two patients require an organ donation and have the same medical need, preference will be given to the one that had signed an organ donation card. (This policy was nicknamed &quot;Don&#x27;t give, don&#x27;t get&quot;.) Organ donation in Israel increased after 2008.

===Japan===
The rate of organ donation in Japan is significantly lower than in Western countries. This is attributed to cultural reasons, some distrust of western medicine, and a controversial organ transplantation in 1968 that provoked a ban on cadaveric organ donation that would last thirty years. Organ donation in Japan is regulated by a 1997 organ transplant law, which defines &quot;brain death&quot; and legalized organ procurement from brain dead donors.

===Netherlands===
The Netherlands sends everyone living in the country a postcard when they turn 18 (and everyone living in the country when the 2020 law came into effect), and one reminder if they do not reply. They may choose to donate, not to donate, to delegate the choice to family, or to name a specific person. If they do not reply to either notice, they are considered a donor by default. A family cannot object unless there is reason to show the person would not have wanted to donate. If a person cannot be found in the national donor registry, because they are travelling from another country or because they are undocumented, their organs are not harvested without family consent. Organs are not harvested from people who die an unnatural death without the approval of the local attorney general.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand law allows live donors to participate in altruistic organ donation only. In the five years to 2018, there were 16 cases of liver donation by live donors and 381 cases of kidney donation by live donors. New Zealand has low rates of live donation, which could be due to the fact that it is illegal to pay someone for their organs. The Human Tissue Act 2008 states that trading in human tissue is prohibited, and is punishable by a fine of up to $50,000 or a prison term of up to 1 year. The Compensation for Live Organ Donors Act 2016, which came into force in December 2017, allows live organ donors to be compensated for lost income for up to 12 weeks post-donation.

New Zealand law also allows for organ donation from deceased individuals. In the five years to 2018, organs were taken from 295 deceased individuals. Everyone who applies for a driver&#x27;s licence in New Zealand indicates whether or not they wish to be a donor if they die in circumstances that would allow for donation. The question is required to be answered for the application to be processed, meaning that the individual must answer yes or no, and does not have the option of leaving it unanswered. However, the answer given on the drivers license does not constitute informed consent, because at the time of drivers license application not all individuals are equipped to make an informed decision regarding whether to be a donor, and it is therefore not the deciding factor in whether donation is carried out or not. It is there to simply give indication of the person&#x27;s wishes. Family must agree to the procedure for donation to take place.

A 2006 bill proposed setting up an organ donation register where people can give informed consent to organ donations and clearly state their legally binding wishes. However, the bill did not pass, and there was condemnation of the bill from some doctors, who said that even if a person had given express consent for organ donation to take place, they would not carry out the procedure in the presence of any disagreement from grieving family members.

The indigenous population of New Zealand also have strong views regarding organ donation. Many Maori people believe organ donation is morally unacceptable due to the cultural need for a dead body to remain fully intact. However, because there is not a universally recognised cultural authority, no one view on organ donation is universally accepted in the Maori population. They are, however, less likely to accept a kidney transplant than other New Zealanders, despite being overrepresented in the population receiving dialysis.

===South Korea===
In South Korea, the 2006 provision of the Organ Transplant Act introduced a monetary incentive equivalent to US$4,500 to the surviving family of brain-death donors; the reward is intended as consolation and compensation for funeral expenses and hospital fees.

===Sri Lanka===
Organ donation in Sri Lanka was ratified by the Human Tissue Transplantation Act No. 48 of 1987. Sri Lanka Eye Donation Society, a non-governmental organization established in 1961 has provided over 60,000 corneas for corneal transplantation, for patients in 57 countries. It is one of the major suppliers of human eyes to the world, with a supply of approximately 3,000 corneas per year.

===United Kingdom===
====Wales====

Since December 2015, Human Transplantation (Wales) Act 2013 passed by the Welsh Government has enabled an opt-out organ donation register, the first country in the UK to do so. The legislation is &#x27;deemed consent&#x27;, whereby all citizens are considered to have no objection to becoming a donor, unless they have opted out on this register.

====England====

The Organ Donation (Deemed Consent) Act 2019 established opt-out organ donation in England, also known as Max and Keira&#x27;s law, when came into effect in May 2020. It means adults in England will be automatically be considered potential donors unless they chose to opt out or are excluded.

==== Scotland ====
The Human Tissue (Authorisation) (Scotland) Act 2019 established opt-out organ donation in Scotland in March 2021.

==== Northern Ireland ====
The Organ and Tissue Donation (Deemed Consent) Act (Northern Ireland) 2022 established opt-out organ donation in 2023.

====Dependencies====
In Jersey, the Capacity and Self-Determination (Jersey) Law 2016 established an opt-out register on July 1, 2019.

in Guernsey, the Human Tissue and Transplantation (Bailiwick of Guernsey) Law, 2020 established opt-out organ donation in 2023.

In the Isle of Man, the Human Tissue and Organ Donation Act 2021 has provisions to establish opt-out organ donation, which have not been enacted.

===United States===
Over 121,000 people in need of an organ are on the U.S. government waiting list. This crisis within the United States is growing rapidly because on average there are only 30,000 transplants performed each year. More than 8,000 people die each year from lack of a donor organ, an average of 22 people a day. Between the years 1988 and 2006 the number of transplants doubled, but the number of patients waiting for an organ grew six times as large.

In the past presumed consent was urged to try to decrease the need for organs. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act of 1987 was adopted in several states, and allowed medical examiners to determine if organs and tissues of cadavers could be donated. By the 1980s, several states adopted different laws that allowed only certain tissues or organs to be retrieved and donated, some allowed all, and some did not allow any without consent of the family. In 2006 when the UAGA was revised, the idea of presumed consent was abandoned. In the United States today, organ donation is done only with consent of the family or donator themselves.

In most states, residents can register to become organ donors through the Department of Motor Vehicles. The driver&#x27;s license will serve as a legal donor card for the registered donor. U.S. Residents may also choose to register as organ, eye, and tissue donors through a national registry maintained by Donate Life America. The national website is RegisterMe.org The national registry allows residents to create a login, password, and edit their donation choice by organ. The most common transplants consists of only six (6) organs: heart, lungs, liver, kidney, pancreas, and small intestines. One healthy donor can potentially save up to eight (8) lives through transplants, using the two lungs and two kidneys separately. The most needed organ for transplants overall are kidneys, due to the high rate of hypertension (HTN) or high blood pressure and diabetes which can lead to end-stage renal disease.

According to economist Alex Tabarrok, the shortage of organs has increased the use of so-called expanded criteria organs, or organs that used to be considered unsuitable for transplant. Five patients that received kidney transplants at the University of Maryland School of Medicine developed cancerous or benign tumors which had to be removed. The head surgeon, Dr. Michael Phelan, explained that &quot;the ongoing shortage of organs from deceased donors, and the high risk of dying while waiting for a transplant, prompted five donors and recipients to push ahead with the surgery.&quot; Several organizations such as the American Kidney Fund are pushing for opt-out organ donation in the United States.

====Donor Leave Laws====
In addition to their sick and annual leave, federal executive agency employees are entitled to 30 days paid leave for organ donation. Thirty-two states (excluding only Alabama, Connecticut, Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Vermont, and Wyoming) and the District of Columbia also offer paid leave for state employees. Five states (California, Hawaii, Louisiana, Minnesota, and Oregon) require certain private employers to provide paid leave for employees for organ or bone marrow donation, and seven others (Arkansas, Connecticut, Maine, Nebraska, New York, South Carolina, and West Virginia) either require employers to provide unpaid leave, or encourage employers to provide leave, for organ or bone marrow donation.

A bill in the US House of Representatives, the Living Donor Protection Act (introduced in 2016, then reintroduced in 2017), would amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to provide leave under the act for an organ donor. If successful, this new law would permit &quot;eligible employee&quot; organ donors to receive up to 12 work weeks of leave in a 12-month period.

====Tax incentives====
Nineteen US states and the District of Columbia provide tax incentives for organ donation. The most generous state tax incentive is Utah&#x27;s tax credit, which covers up to $10,000 of unreimbursed expenses (travel, lodging, lost wages, and medical expenses) associated with organ or tissue donation. Idaho (up to $5,000 of unreimbursed expenses) and Louisiana (up to $7,500 of 72% of unreimbursed expenses) also provide donor tax credits. Arkansas, the District of Columbia, Louisiana and Pennsylvania provide tax credits to employers for wages paid to employees on leave for organ donation. Thirteen states (Arkansas, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Mississippi, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Rhode Island and Wisconsin) have a tax deduction for up to $10,000 of unreimbursed costs, and Kansas and Virginia offer a tax deduction for up to $5,000 of unreimbursed costs.

States have focused their tax incentives on unreimbursed costs associated with organ donation to ensure compliance with the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984. NOTA prohibits, &quot;any person to knowingly acquire, receive, or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation.&quot; However, NOTA exempts, &quot;the expenses of travel, housing, and lost wages incurred by the donor of a human organ in connection with the donation of the organ,&quot; from its definition of &quot;valuable consideration&quot;.

While offering income tax deductions has been the preferred method of providing tax incentives, some commentators have expressed concern that these incentives provide disproportionate benefits to wealthier donors. Tax credits, on the other hand, are perceived as more equitable since the after tax benefit of the incentive is not tied to the marginal tax rate of the donor.

Additional tax favored approaches have been proposed for organ donation, including providing: tax credits to the families of deceased donors (seeking to encourage consent), refundable tax credits (similar to the earned income credit) to provide greater tax equity among potential donors, and charitable deductions for the donation of blood or organs.

====Other financial incentives====
As stated above, under the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984, granting monetary incentives for organ donation is illegal in the United States. However, there has been some discussion about providing fixed payment for potential live donors. In 1988, regulated paid organ donation was instituted in Iran and, as a result, the renal transplant waiting list was eliminated. Critics of paid organ donation argue that the poor and vulnerable become susceptible to transplant tourism. Travel for transplantation becomes transplant tourism if the movement of organs, donors, recipients or transplant professionals occurs across borders and involves organ trafficking or transplant commercialism. Poor and underserved populations in underdeveloped countries are especially vulnerable to the negative consequences of transplant tourism because they have become a major source of organs for the &#x27;transplant tourists&#x27; that can afford to travel and purchase organs.

In 1994 a law was passed in Pennsylvania which proposed to pay $300 for room and board and $3,000 for funeral expenses to an organ donor&#x27;s family. Developing the program was an eight-year process; it is the first of its kind. Procurement directors and surgeons across the nation await the outcomes of Pennsylvania&#x27;s program. There have been at least nineteen families that have signed up for the benefit. Due to investigation of the program, however, there has been some concern whether the money collected is being used to assist families. Nevertheless, funeral aids to induce post-mortem organ donation have also received support from experts and the general public, as the incentives present more ethical values, such as honoring the deceased donor or preserving voluntariness, and potentially increase donation willingness.

Some organizations, such as the National Kidney Foundation, oppose financial incentives associated with organ donation claiming, &quot;Offering direct or indirect economic benefits in exchange for organ donation is inconsistent with our values as a society.&quot; One argument is it will disproportionately affect the poor. The $300–3,000 reward may act as an incentive for poorer individuals, as opposed to the wealthy who may not find the offered incentives significant. The National Kidney Foundation has noted that financial incentives, such as this Pennsylvania statute, diminish human dignity.

==Bioethical issues==
===Deontological===

Deontological issues are issues about whether a person has an ethical duty or responsibility to take an action. Nearly all scholars and societies around the world agree that voluntarily donating organs to sick people is ethically permissible. Although nearly all scholars encourage organ donation, fewer scholars believe that all people are ethically required to donate their organs after death. Similarly, nearly all religions support voluntary organ donation as a charitable act of great benefit to the community. Certain small faiths such as Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Shinto are opposed to organ donation based upon religious teachings; for Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, this opposition is absolute whereas there exists increasing flexibility among Shinto scholars. Romani people are also often opposed to organ donation based on prevailing spiritual beliefs and not religious views per se. Issues surrounding patient autonomy, living wills, and guardianship make it nearly impossible for involuntary organ donation to occur.

From the standpoint of deontological ethics, the primary issues surrounding the morality of organ donation are semantic in nature. The debate over the definitions of life, death, human, and body is ongoing. For example, whether or not a brain-dead patient ought to be kept artificially animate to preserve organs for donation is an ongoing problem in clinical bioethics. In addition, some have argued that organ donation constitutes an act of self-harm, even when an organ is donated willingly.

Further, the use of cloning to produce organs with a genotype identical to the recipient is a controversial topic, especially considering the possibility for an entire person to be brought into being for the express purpose of being destroyed for organ procurement. While the benefit of such a cloned organ would be a zero-percent chance of transplant rejection, the ethical issues involved with creating and killing a clone may outweigh these benefits. However, it may be possible in the future to use cloned stem-cells to grow a new organ without creating a new human being.

A relatively new field of transplantation has reinvigorated the debate. Xenotransplantation, or the transfer of animal (usually pig) organs into human bodies, promises to eliminate many of the ethical issues, while creating many of its own. While xenotransplantation promises to increase the supply of organs considerably, the threat of organ transplant rejection and the risk of xenozoonosis, coupled with general anathema to the idea, decreases the functionality of the technique. Some animal rights groups oppose the sacrifice of an animal for organ donation and have launched campaigns to ban them.

===Teleological===
On teleological or utilitarian grounds, the moral status of &quot;black market organ donation&quot; relies upon the ends, rather than the means. In so far as those who donate organs are often impoverished and those who can afford black market organs are typically well-off, it would appear that there is an imbalance in the trade. In many cases, those in need of organs are put on waiting lists for &quot;legal&quot; organs for indeterminate lengths of time—many die while still on a waiting list.

Organ donation is fast becoming an important bioethical issue from a social perspective as well. While most first-world nations have a legal system of oversight for organ transplantation, the fact remains that demand far outstrips supply. Consequently, there has arisen a black market trend often referred to as &quot;transplant tourism.&quot; The issues are weighty and controversial. On the one hand are those who contend that those who can afford to buy organs are exploiting those who are desperate enough to sell their organs. Many suggest this results in a growing inequality of status between the rich and the poor. On the other hand, are those who contend that the desperate should be allowed to sell their organs and that preventing them from doing so is merely contributing to their status as impoverished. Further, those in favor of the trade hold that exploitation is morally preferable to death, and in so far as the choice lies between abstract notions of justice on the one hand and a dying person whose life could be saved on the other hand, the organ trade should be legalized. Conversely, surveys conducted among living donors postoperatively and in a period of five years following the procedure have shown extreme regret in a majority of the donors, who said that given the chance to repeat the procedure, they would not. Additionally, many study participants reported a decided worsening of economic condition following the procedure. These studies looked only at people who sold a kidney in countries where organ sales are already legal.

A consequence of the black market for organs has been a number of cases and suspected cases of organ theft, including murder for the purposes of organ theft. Proponents of a legal market for organs say that the black-market nature of the current trade allows such tragedies and that regulation of the market could prevent them. Opponents say that such a market would encourage criminals by making it easier for them to claim that their stolen organs were legal.

Legalization of the organ trade carries with it its own sense of justice as well. Continuing black-market trade creates further disparity on the demand side: only the rich can afford such organs. Legalization of the international organ trade could lead to increased supply, lowering prices so that persons outside the wealthiest segments could afford such organs as well.

Exploitation arguments generally come from two main areas:
* &quot;Physical exploitation&quot; suggests that the operations in question are quite risky, and, taking place in third-world hospitals or &quot;back-alleys&quot;, even more risky. Yet, if the operations in question can be made safe, there is little threat to the donor.
* &quot;Financial exploitation&quot; suggests that the donor (especially in the Indian subcontinent and Africa) are not paid enough. Commonly, accounts from persons who have sold organs in both legal and black market circumstances put the prices at between $150 and $5,000, depending on the local laws, supply of ready donors and scope of the transplant operation. In Chennai, India, where one of the largest black markets for organs is known to exist, studies have placed the average sale price at little over $1,000. Many accounts also exist of donors being postoperatively denied their promised pay.

&quot;The New Cannibalism&quot; is a phrase coined by anthropologist Nancy Scheper-Hughes in 1998 for an article written for The New Internationalist. Her argument was that the actual exploitation is an ethical failing, a human exploitation; a perception of the poor as organ sources which may be used to extend the lives of the wealthy.

Economic drivers leading to increased donation are not limited to areas such as India and Africa, but also are emerging in the United States. Increasing funeral expenses combined with decreasing real value of investments such as homes and retirement savings which took place in the 2000s have purportedly led to an increase in citizens taking advantage of arrangements where funeral costs are reduced or eliminated.

===Brain death versus cardiac death===
Brain death may result in legal death, but still with the heart beating and with mechanical ventilation, keeping all other vital organs alive and functional for a certain period of time. Given long enough, patients who do not fully die in the complete biological sense, but who are declared brain dead, will usually start to build up toxins and wastes in the body. In this way, the organs can eventually dysfunction due to coagulopathy, fluid or electrolyte and nutrient imbalances, or even fail. Thus, the organs will usually only be sustainable and viable for acceptable use up until a certain length of time. This may depend on factors such as how well the patient is maintained, any comorbidities, the skill of the healthcare teams and the quality their facilities. A major point of contention is whether transplantation should be allowed at all if the patient is not yet fully biologically dead, and if brain death is acceptable, whether the person&#x27;s whole brain needs to have died, or if the death of a certain part of the brain is enough for legal and ethical and moral purposes.

Most organ donation for organ transplantation is done in the setting of brain death. However, in Japan this is a fraught point, and prospective donors may designate either brain death or cardiac death – see organ transplantation in Japan. In some nations such as Belgium, France, Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Singapore and Spain, everyone is automatically an organ donor unless they opt out of the system. Elsewhere, consent from family members or next-of-kin is required for organ donation. The non-living donor is kept on ventilator support until the organs have been surgically removed. If a brain-dead individual is not an organ donor, ventilator and drug support is discontinued and cardiac death is allowed to occur.

In the United States, where since the 1980s the Uniform Determination of Death Act has defined death as the irreversible cessation of the function of either the brain or the heart and lungs, the 21st century has seen an order-of-magnitude increase of donation following cardiac death. In 1995, only one out of 100 dead donors in the nation gave their organs following the declaration of cardiac death. That figure grew to almost 11 percent in 2008, according to the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. That increase has provoked ethical concerns about the interpretation of &quot;irreversible&quot; since &quot;patients may still be alive five or even 10 minutes after cardiac arrest because, theoretically, their hearts could be restarted, [and thus are] clearly not dead because their condition was reversible.&quot;

===Gender inequality===
The majority of organ donors are women. For example, in the United States, 62% of kidney donors and 53% of liver donors are women. According to an international study published in 2023, which included countries from North America, Europe, and Central Asia, 60-65% of living donors in many countries are women. In the United States, for example, data from the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (UNOS) in 2021 showed that women represent about 63% of living organ donors. only 22% of women on dialysis were placed on the kidney transplant waitlist, compared to 30% of men. This disparity persisted even though women had fewer medical comorbidities than men. In India, women constitute 74% of kidney donors and 60.5% of liver donors. Additionally, the number of female organ recipients is conspicuously lower than that of male recipients. In the U.S., 35% of liver recipients and 39% of kidney recipients are women. In India, the figures are 24% and 19% respectively.

A study published in 2022 partially explained these disparities through the higher prevalence of certain diseases in men, immune responses related to childbirth in women, and the mismatch in size between the donor and recipient. These disparities may also be attributed to social and cultural factors, as women are often more willing to support family members, in addition to public health policies that have not given enough attention to addressing these disparities.

==Political issues==
There are also controversial issues regarding how organs are allocated to recipients. For example, some believe that livers should not be given to alcoholics in danger of reversion, while others view alcoholism as a medical condition like diabetes. Faith in the medical system is important to the success of organ donation. Brazil switched to an opt-out system and ultimately had to withdraw it because it further alienated patients who already distrusted the country&#x27;s medical system. Adequate funding, strong political will to see transplant outcomes improve, and the existence of specialized training, care and facilities also increase donation rates. Expansive legal definitions of death, such as Spain uses, also increase the pool of eligible donors by allowing physicians to declare a patient to be dead at an earlier stage, when the organs are still in good physical condition. Allowing or forbidding payment for organs affects the availability of organs. Generally, where organs cannot be bought or sold, quality and safety are high, but supply is not adequate to the demand. Where organs can be purchased, the supply increases.
Healthy humans have two kidneys, but can live a healthy life with only one. This enables living donors (&quot;inter vivos&quot;) to give a kidney to someone who needs it, with little to no long-term risk. The most common transplants are to close relatives, but people have given kidneys to other friends. The rarest type of donation is the undirected donation whereby a donor gives a kidney to a stranger. Less than a few hundred of such kidney donations have been performed. In recent years, searching for altruistic donors via the internet has also become a way to find life saving organs. However, internet advertising for organs is a highly controversial practice, as some scholars believe it undermines the traditional list-based allocation system.

=== Black market organ donation ===
The issue of the black market for organs being legalized has become a widespread debate because if this happens then individuals will most likely be coerced into selling their organs. Additionally, even if there were to become regulations against it most individuals who would be coerced into doing this would most likely be unable to afford legal protection.

The National Transplant Organization of Spain is one of the most successful in the world (Spain has been the world leader in organ donation for decades), but it still cannot meet the demand, as 10% of those needing a transplant die while still on the transplant list. Donations from corpses are anonymous, and a network for communication and transport allows fast extraction and transplant across the country. Under Spanish law, every corpse can provide organs unless the deceased person had expressly rejected it. Because family members still can forbid the donation, carefully trained doctors ask the family for permission, making it very similar in practice to the United States system.

In the overwhelming majority of cases, organ donation is not possible for reasons of recipient safety, match failures, or organ condition. Even in Spain, which has the highest organ donation rate in the world, there are only 35.1 actual donors per million people, and there are hundreds of patients on the waiting list. This rate compares to 24.8 per million in Austria, where families are rarely asked to donate organs, and 22.2 per million in France, which—like Spain—has a presumed-consent system.

===Prison inmates===

In the United States, prisoners are not discriminated against as organ recipients and are equally eligible for organ transplants along with the general population. A 1976 U.S. Supreme Court case ruled that withholding health care from prisoners constituted &quot;cruel and unusual punishment&quot;. United Network for Organ Sharing, the organization that coordinates available organs with recipients, does not factor a patient&#x27;s prison status when determining suitability for a transplant.
An organ transplant and follow-up care can cost the prison system up to one million dollars. If a prisoner qualifies, a state may allow compassionate early release to avoid high costs associated with organ transplants. However, an organ transplant may save the prison system substantial costs associated with dialysis and other life-extending treatments required by the prisoner with the failing organ. For example, the estimated cost of a kidney transplant is about $111,000. A prisoner&#x27;s dialysis treatments are estimated to cost a prison $120,000 per year.

Because donor organs are in short supply, there are more people waiting for a transplant than available organs. When a prisoner receives an organ, there is a high probability that someone else will die waiting for the next available organ. A response to this ethical dilemma states that felons who have a history of violent crime, who have violated others&#x27; basic rights, have lost the right to receive an organ transplant, though it is noted that it would be necessary &quot;to reform our justice system to minimize the chance of an innocent person being wrongly convicted of a violent crime and thus being denied an organ transplant&quot;.

Prisons typically do not allow inmates to donate organs to anyone but immediate family members. There is no law against prisoner organ donation; however, the transplant community has discouraged use of prisoner&#x27;s organs since the early 1990s due to concern over prisons&#x27; high-risk environment for infectious diseases. Physicians and ethicists also criticize the idea because a prisoner is not able to consent to the procedure in a free and non-coercive environment, especially if given inducements to participate. However, with modern testing advances to more safely rule out infectious disease and by ensuring that there are no incentives offered to participate, some have argued that prisoners can now voluntarily consent to organ donation just as they can now consent to medical procedures in general. With careful safeguards, and with over 2 million prisoners in the U.S., they reason that prisoners can provide a solution for reducing organ shortages in the U.S.

While some have argued that prisoner participation would likely be too low to make a difference, one Arizona program started by former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio encourages inmates to voluntarily sign up to donate their heart and other organs. As of 2015, there have been over 16,500 participants. Similar initiatives have been started in other US states. In 2013, Utah became the first state to allow prisoners to sign up for organ donation upon death.

==Religious viewpoints==

There are several different religions that have different perspectives. Muslims have a conflicting view regarding the issue, with half believing that it is against the religion. Muslims are commanded to seek medical attention when in need and saving life is a very important factor of the Islamic religion. Christianity is lenient on the topic of organ donation, and believe it is a service of life.

All major religions accept organ donation in at least some form on either utilitarian grounds (&quot;i.e.&quot;, because of its life-saving capabilities) or deontological grounds (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the right of an individual believer to make his or her own decision). Most religions, among them the Roman Catholic Church, support organ donation on the grounds that it constitutes an act of charity and provides a means of saving a life. One religious group, The Jesus Christians, became known as &quot;The Kidney Cult&quot; because more than half its members had donated their kidneys altruistically. Jesus Christians claim altruistic kidney donation is a great way to &quot;Do unto others what they would want you to do unto them.&quot; Some religions impose certain restrictions on the types of organs that may be donated and/or on the means by which organs may be harvested and/or transplanted. For example, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses require that organs be drained of any blood due to their interpretation of the Hebrew Bible/Christian Old Testament as prohibiting blood transfusion, and Muslims require that the donor have provided written consent in advance. A few groups disfavor organ transplantation or donation; notably, these include Shinto and the Romani.

Orthodox Judaism considers organ donation obligatory if it will save a life, as long as the donor is considered dead as defined by Jewish law. In both Orthodox Judaism and non-Orthodox Judaism, the majority view holds that organ donation is permitted in the case of irreversible cardiac rhythm cessation. In some cases, rabbinic authorities believe that organ donation may be mandatory, whereas a minority opinion considers any donation of a live organ as forbidden.

==Organ shortfall==

The demand for organs significantly surpasses the number of donors everywhere in the world. There are more potential recipients on organ donation waiting lists than organ donors. In particular, due to significant advances in dialysis techniques, patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can survive longer than ever before. Because these patients do not die as quickly as they used to, and as kidney failure increases with the rising age and prevalence of high blood pressure and diabetes in a society, the need especially for kidneys rises every year.

, about 121,600 people in the United States are on the waiting list, although about a third of those patients are inactive and could not receive a donated organ. Wait times and success rates for organs differ significantly between organs due to demand and procedure difficulty. , three-quarters of patients in need of an organ transplant were waiting for a kidney, and as such kidneys have much longer waiting times. As stated by the Gift of Life Donor Program website, the median patient who ultimately received an organ waited 4 months for a heart or lung—but 18 months for a kidney, and 18–24 months for a pancreas because demand for these organs substantially outstrips supply. An increased prevalence of self-driving cars could exacerbate this problem: In the US, 13% of organ donations come from car crash victims, and autonomous vehicles are projected to reduce the frequency of car crashes.

In Australia, there are 10.8 transplants per million people, about a third of the Spanish rate. The Lions Eye Institute, in Western Australia, houses the Lions Eye Bank. The Bank was established in 1986 and coordinates the collection, processing and distribution of eye tissue for transplantation. The Lions Eye Bank also maintains a waitlist of patients who require corneal graft operations.
About 100 corneas are provided by the Bank for transplant each year, but there is still a waiting list for corneas. &quot;To an economist, this is a basic supply-and-demand gap with tragic consequences.&quot; Approaches to addressing this shortfall include:
* Donor registries and &quot;primary consent&quot; laws, to remove the burden of the donation decision from the legal next-of-kin. Illinois adopted a policy of &quot;mandated choice&quot; in 2006, which requires driver&#x27;s license registrants to answer the question &quot;Do you want to be an organ donor?&quot; Illinois has a registration rate of 60 percent compared to 38 percent nationally. The added cost of adding a question to the registration form is minimal.
* Monetary incentives for signing up to be a donor. Some economists have advocated going as far as allowing the sale of organs. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that &quot;Gary Becker and Julio Jorge Elias argued in a recent paper that &#x27;monetary incentives would increase the supply of organs for transplant sufficiently to eliminate the very large queues in organ markets, and the suffering and deaths of many of those waiting, without increasing the total cost of transplant surgery by more than 12 percent.&#x27;&quot; Iran allows the sale of kidneys and has no waiting list. Organ futures have been proposed to incentivise donation through direct or indirect compensation. The primary argument against such proposals is a moral one; as the article notes, many find such a suggestion repugnant. As the National Kidney Foundation puts it, &quot;Offering direct or indirect economic benefits in exchange for organ donation is inconsistent with our values as a society. Any attempt to assign a monetary value to the human body, or body parts, either arbitrarily, or through market forces, diminishes human dignity.&quot;
* An opt-out system (&quot;dissent solution&quot;), in which a potential donor or his/her relatives must take specific action to be excluded from organ donation, rather than specific action to be included. This model is used in several European countries, such as Austria, which has a registration rate eight times that of Germany, which uses an opt-in system.
* Social incentive programs, wherein members sign a legal agreement to direct their organs first to other members who are on the transplant waiting list. One historical example of a private organization using this model is LifeSharers, which is free to join and whose members agree to sign a document giving preferred access to their organs. &quot;The proposal [for an organ mutual insurance pool] can be easily summarized: An individual would receive priority for any needed transplant if that individual agrees that his or her organs will be available to other members of the insurance pool in the event of his or her death. … The main purpose [of this proposal] is to increase the supply of transplantable organs in order to save or improve more lives.&quot;
* Encouraging more people in palliative care to become donors. Researcher suggests that 46% of patients in palliative care are eligible, but only 4% are approached to consider eye donation.

* Technical advances allows the use of donors that were previously rejected. For example, hepatitis C can be knowingly transplanted and treated in the organ recipient.
In hospitals, organ network representatives routinely screen patient records to identify potential donors shortly in advance of their deaths. In many cases, organ-procurement representatives will request screening tests (such as blood typing) or organ-preserving drugs (such as blood pressure drugs) to keep potential donors&#x27; organs viable until their suitability for transplants can be determined and family consent (if needed) can be obtained. This practice increases transplant efficiency, as potential donors who are unsuitable due to infection or other causes are removed from consideration before their deaths, and decreases the avoidable loss of organs. It may also benefit families indirectly, as the families of unsuitable donors are not approached to discuss organ donation.

Doctors and patients are sometimes hesitant to accept organs from people who died of brain tumours. However, an analysis of the UK donor registry found no evidence of cancer transmission across more than 750 donations, including people with high-grade tumours. This suggests that it may be safe to increase the use of organs from people who died of a brain tumour, which could help reduce organ shortfall.

==Distribution==
The United States has two agencies that govern organ procurement and distribution within the country. The United Network for Organ Sharing and the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) regulate Organ Procurement Organizations (OPO) with regard to procurement and distribution ethics and standards. OPOs are non-profit organizations charged with the evaluation, procurement and allocation of organs within their Designated Service Area (DSA). Once a donor has been evaluated and consent obtained, provisional allocation of organs commences. UNOS developed a computer program that automatically generates donor specific match lists for suitable recipients based on the criteria that the patient was listed with. OPO coordinators enter donor information into the program and run the respective lists. Organ offers to potential recipients are made to transplant centers to make them aware of a potential organ. The surgeon will evaluate the donor information and make a provisional determination of medical suitability to their recipient. Distribution varies slightly between different organs but is essentially very similar. When lists are generated many factors are taken into consideration; these factors include: distance of transplant center from the donor hospital, blood type, medical urgency, wait time, donor size and tissue typing. For heart recipients medical urgency is denoted by a recipients &quot;Status&quot; (Status 1A, 1B and status 2). Lungs are allocated based on a recipients Lung Allocation Score (LAS) that is determined based on the urgency of clinical need as well as the likelihood of benefit from the transplant. Livers are allocated using both a status system and MELD/PELD score (Model for End-stage Liver Disease/Pediatric End-stage Liver Disease). Kidney and pancreas lists are based on location, blood type, Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) typing and wait time. When a recipient for a kidney or pancreas has no direct antibodies to the donor HLA the match is said to be a 0 ABDR mismatch or zero antigen mismatch. A zero mismatch organ has a low rate of rejection and allows a recipient to be on lower doses of immunosuppressive drugs. Since zero mismatches have such high graft survival these recipients are afforded priority regardless of location and wait time. UNOS has in place a &quot;Payback&quot; system to balance organs that are sent out of a DSA because of a zero mismatch.

Location of a transplant center with respect to a donor hospital is given priority due to the effects of Cold Ischemic Time (CIT). Once the organ is removed from the donor, blood no longer perfuses through the vessels and begins to starve the cells of oxygen (ischemia). Each organ tolerates different ischemic times. Hearts and lungs need to be transplanted within 4–6 hours from recovery, liver about 8–10 hours and pancreas about 15 hours; kidneys are the most resilient to ischemia. Kidneys packaged on ice can be successfully transplanted 24–36 hours after recovery. Developments in kidney preservation have yielded a device that pumps cold preservation solution through the kidneys vessels to prevent Delayed Graft Function (DGF) due to ischemia. Perfusion devices, often called kidney pumps, can extend graft survival to 36–48 hours post recovery for kidneys. Recently similar devices have been developed for the heart and lungs, in an effort to increase distances procurement teams may travel to recover an organ.

==Suicide==
People who die by suicide have a higher rate of donating organs than average. One reason is lower negative response or refusal rate by the family and relatives, but the explanation for this remains to be clarified. In addition, donation consent is higher than average from people who have died by suicide.

Attempted suicide is a common cause of brain death (3.8%), mainly among young men. Organ donation is more common in this group compared to other causes of death. Brain death may result in legal death, but still with the heart beating, and with mechanical ventilation all other vital organs may be kept completely alive and functional, providing optimal opportunities for organ transplantation.

==Controversies==
In 2008, California transplant surgeon Hootan Roozrokh was charged with dependent adult abuse for prescribing what prosecutors alleged were excessive doses of morphine and sedatives to hasten the death of a man with adrenal leukodystrophy and irreversible brain damage, to procure his organs for transplant. The case brought against Roozrokh was the first criminal case against a transplant surgeon in the US, and resulted in his acquittal. Further, Roozrokh successfully sued for defamation stemming from the incident.

At California&#x27;s Emanuel Medical Center, neurologist Narges Pazouki said an organ-procurement organization representative pressed her to declare a patient brain-dead before the appropriate tests had been done. In September 1999, eBay blocked an auction for &quot;one functional human kidney&quot; which had reached a highest bid of $5.7 million. Under United States federal laws, eBay was obligated to dismiss the auction for the selling of human organs, which is punishable by up to five years in prison and a $50,000 fine.

On June 27, 2008, Indonesian Sulaiman Damanik, 26, pled guilty in a Singapore court for sale of his kidney to CK Tang&#x27;s executive chair, Tang Wee Sung, 55, for 150 million rupiah (US$17,000). The Transplant Ethics Committee must approve living donor kidney transplants. Organ trading is banned in Singapore and in many other countries to prevent the exploitation of &quot;poor and socially disadvantaged donors who are unable to make informed choices and suffer potential medical risks.&quot; Toni, 27, the other accused, donated a kidney to an Indonesian patient in March, alleging he was the patient&#x27;s adopted son, and was paid 186 million rupiah (US$21,000).

==Public service announcements==
Marketing for organ donation must walk a fine line between stressing the need for organ donation and not being too forceful. If the marketing agent is too forceful, then the target of the message will react defensively to the request. According to psychological reactance theory, a person will perceive their freedom threatened and will react to restore the freedom. According to Ashley Anker, the use of transportation theory has a positive effect on target reactions by marketing attempts. When public service announcements use recipient-focused messages, targets were more transported because potential donors experience empathy for the potential recipient.

Awareness about organ donation leads to greater social support for organ donation, in turn leading to greater registration. By starting with promoting college students&#x27; awareness of organ donation and moving to increasing social support for organ donation, the more likely people will be to register as organ donors.

The United States Department of Health funded a study by the University of Wisconsin Hospital to increase efforts to increase awareness and the number of registered donors by pursuing members of the university and their family and friends through social media. The results of the study showed a 20% increase in organ donation by creating support and awareness through social media.

<text>Cybill Lynne Shepherd (born February 18, 1950) is an American actress, singer and former model. Her film debut and breakthrough role came as Jacy Farrow in Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s coming-of-age drama &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971) alongside Jeff Bridges. She also had roles as Kelly in Elaine May&#x27;s &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot; (1972), Betsy in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976), and Nancy in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; (1990).

On television, her first major role was as Colleen Champion in the one season of the night-time drama &quot;The Yellow Rose&quot; (1983). Shepherd played Madelyn Hayes on the detective comedy-drama &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1985–1989) opposite Bruce Willis, for which she won two Golden Globes for Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical TV Series out of three such nominations. She later starred as Cybill Sheridan on &quot;Cybill&quot; (1995–1998), for which she won her third Golden Globe Award as Best Actress in a Comedy/Musical TV series. Her later television roles included Phyllis Kroll on &quot;The L Word&quot; (2007–2009), Madeleine Spencer on &quot;Psych&quot; (2008–2013), Cassie in the television film &quot;The Client List&quot; (2010), and Linette Montgomery on &quot;The Client List&quot; (2012–2013).

==Early life and career==
Shepherd was born February 18, 1950, in Memphis, Tennessee. She is the second of three children. She had an older sister, Terry, and has a younger brother, William. Cybill was named with a blend of her grandfather Cy and her father Bill&#x27;s names. While attending East High School, Shepherd won the &quot;Miss Teenage Memphis&quot; title and represented the city at the 1966 Miss Teenage America pageant at age 16, where she won the congeniality award. She competed at the 1968 &quot;Model of the Year&quot; contest at age 18, resulting in fashion model assignments through high school and afterwards.
According to Shepherd&#x27;s autobiography, a 1970 &quot;Glamour&quot; magazine cover caught the eye of film director Peter Bogdanovich. His then-wife, Polly Platt, claimed that when she saw the cover in a check-out line in a Ralphs grocery store in southern California, he said &quot;That&#x27;s Jacy,&quot; referring to the role Bogdanovich was casting—and ultimately given to Shepherd—in &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971).

===Celebrity===
Her first film was &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, also starring Jeff Bridges and Timothy Bottoms. The film became a critical and box office hit, earning eight Academy Awards nominations and winning two. Shepherd was nominated for a Golden Globe. In 1972, Shepherd was cast opposite Charles Grodin in &quot;The Heartbreak Kid&quot;. She played Kelly, a young woman for whom Grodin&#x27;s character falls while on his honeymoon in Miami. Directed by Elaine May and written by Neil Simon, it was another critical and box office hit. Also in 1972, Shepherd posed as a Kodak Girl for the camera manufacturer&#x27;s then-ubiquitous cardboard store poster displays.

In 1974, Shepherd again teamed up with Peter Bogdanovich for the title role in &quot;Daisy Miller&quot;, based on the Henry James novella. The film—a period piece set in Europe—was a box office failure. That same year, she launched a singing career, releasing a studio album &quot;Cybill Does It...To Cole Porter&quot; for MCA Records. It was panned by &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau, who wrote: &quot;Her voice is surprisingly pleasant, but you&#x27;d never know how these songs sparkle. Since Cole didn&#x27;t like to . . . do it with (or &#x27;to&#x27;) women very much, maybe the &#x27;do&#x27; is as hostile as it sounds.&quot;

In 1975, she made &quot;At Long Last Love&quot;, a film musical directed by Bogdanovich, but, like &quot;Daisy Miller&quot;, it flopped. Shepherd returned with good reviews for her work in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; (1976). According to Shepherd, Scorsese had requested a &quot;Cybill Shepherd type&quot; for the role. She portrayed Betsy, a volunteer for a presidential candidate with whom Robert De Niro&#x27;s character, Travis Bickle, becomes infatuated.

A series of less-successful roles followed, including &quot;The Lady Vanishes&quot;, a remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1938 film. Already sitting in on an acting class taught by Stella Adler, Shepherd was offered work at a dinner theater in Norfolk, Virginia, and turned to friend Orson Welles for advice. He encouraged her to get experience on stage in front of an audience, anywhere but Los Angeles or New York City, away from the harsh big-city critics so she moved back to her home town of Memphis to work in regional theatre.

In 1981, Shepherd appeared in a play directed by Orson Bean, &quot;Vanities&quot;, staged in St. Louis, Missouri.

===Return to Hollywood===
In 1982, Shepherd returned to New York and to the stage when she played alongside James MacArthur in a theatre tour of &quot;Lunch Hour&quot; by Jean Kerr. The following year, Shepherd went back to Los Angeles and was cast as Colleen Champion in the NBC television drama &quot;The Yellow Rose&quot; (1983), opposite Sam Elliott. Although critically acclaimed, the series lasted only one season. A year later, Shepherd was cast as Maddie Hayes on &quot;Moonlighting&quot; (1985–1989), a role that defined her career. The producers knew that her role depended on having &quot;chemistry&quot; with her co-star, and involved her in the selection of Bruce Willis. A lighthearted combination of mystery and comedy, the series won Shepherd two Golden Globe Awards.
She starred in &quot;Chances Are&quot; (1989) with Robert Downey Jr. and Ryan O&#x27;Neal, receiving excellent reviews. She then reprised her role as Jacy in &quot;Texasville&quot; (1990), the sequel to &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971), as the original cast (and director Peter Bogdanovich) reunited 20 years after filming the original. She appeared in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Alice&quot; (1990) and Eugene Levy&#x27;s &quot;Once Upon a Crime&quot; (1992), as well as several television films. In 1997, she won her third Golden Globe award for &quot;Cybill&quot; (1995–1998), a television sitcom in which the title character, Cybill Sheridan, an actress struggling with hammy roles in B movies and bad soap operas, was loosely modeled on herself, including portrayals of her two ex-husbands and her then-teenage daughter.

In 2000, Shepherd&#x27;s bestselling autobiography, &quot;Cybill Disobedience: How I Survived Beauty Pageants, Elvis, Sex, Bruce Willis, Lies, Marriage, Motherhood, Hollywood, and the Irrepressible Urge to Say What I Think&quot;, written in collaboration with Aimee Lee Ball, was published. That same year, Shepherd hosted a short-lived syndicated talk show version of the book &quot;Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus&quot;, but left the show in early 2001. In 2003, she guest-starred on &quot;8 Simple Rules&quot; as the sister of Cate Hennessy (portrayed by Katey Sagal). She has played Martha Stewart in two television films: &quot;Martha, Inc.: The Story of Martha Stewart&quot; (2003) and &quot;&quot; (2005).

From 2007 until it ended, Shepherd appeared on &quot;The L Word&quot; as Phyllis Kroll for the show&#x27;s final three seasons. In 2008, she joined the cast of &quot;Psych&quot; as main character Shawn Spencer&#x27;s mother, Madeleine Spencer. On November 7, 2008, Shepherd guest-starred in a February episode of the CBS drama &quot;Criminal Minds&quot;. In 2010 Shepherd appeared in an episode of &quot;No Ordinary Family&quot; and in November of the same year she guest-starred in an episode of &quot;$♯*! My Dad Says&quot;.

Shepherd appeared alongside Jennifer Love Hewitt in the 2010 television film &quot;The Client List&quot; and then in the 2012-13 series based on the film.

In July 2012, Shepherd made her Broadway debut in the revival of Gore Vidal&#x27;s &quot;The Best Man&quot; at the Gerald Schoenfeld Theatre alongside James Earl Jones, John Stamos, John Larroquette, Kristin Davis, and Elizabeth Ashley to positive reviews.

Shepherd appeared as a mother grieving the death of her daughter in &quot;Do You Believe?&quot; (2015), a Christian-themed movie produced by Pure Flix Entertainment.

In 2019, she took on a role as an ex-cop senior struggling with illness who unexpectedly finds love on a road trip in the direct-to-cable &quot;Being Rose&quot;.

In 2023, Shepherd starred in the Lifetime film &quot;How to Murder Your Husband: The Nancy Brophy Story,&quot; where she portrayed Nancy Brophy, opposite Steve Guttenberg as Daniel Brophy, in a dramatization of the Murder of Daniel Brophy.

==Personal life==
Shepherd began a relationship with Peter Bogdanovich on the set of &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, during his marriage to Polly Platt, whom Bogdanovich subsequently divorced. The relationship between the young star and her director lasted eight years. In her autobiography, Shepherd revealed that she called her mother in 1978, crying and unhappy with the way her life and career were going. Her mother replied, &quot;Cybill, come home.&quot; Shepherd went home to Memphis, where she met and began dating David M. Ford, a local auto parts dealer and nightclub entertainer. She became pregnant, and the couple married that year. Their daughter, Clementine Ford, was born in 1979. The marriage ended in divorce in 1982.

In 1987, Shepherd became pregnant by chiropractor Bruce Oppenheim and married him. They had twins named Ariel and Zachariah Shepherd Oppenheim born during the fourth season of &quot;Moonlighting&quot;. The couple divorced in 1990. She had an intimate relationship with author Larry McMurtry, whom she once called the love of her life.

In June 2012, Shepherd became engaged to psychologist Andrei Nikolajevic. By 2015, the engagement had been called off.

===Political activism===

Throughout her career, Shepherd has been an outspoken activist for issues such as gay rights and abortion rights. In 2009, she was honored by the Human Rights Campaign in Atlanta with one of two National Ally for Equality awards. She has been an advocate for same-sex marriage.

She was present at the opening of the National Civil Rights Museum in her hometown of Memphis, to which she lent financial support.

===Religious beliefs===
Shepherd was raised Christian, but stated that she eventually &quot;lost touch&quot; with the religion. In a 2007 interview with &quot;Metro Weekly&quot;, she described herself as being &quot;a goddess-worshipping Christian Pagan Buddhist&quot;.

In October 2014, Shepherd said that she had reconnected with her Christian faith.

<text>The Apartment is a 1960 American romantic comedy-drama film directed and produced by Billy Wilder from a screenplay he co-wrote with I. A. L. Diamond. It stars Jack Lemmon, Shirley MacLaine, Fred MacMurray, Ray Walston, Jack Kruschen, David Lewis, Willard Waterman, David White, Hope Holiday, and Edie Adams.

The film follows an insurance clerk (Lemmon) who, in hopes of climbing the corporate ladder, allows his superiors to use his Upper West Side apartment to conduct their extramarital affairs. He becomes attracted to an elevator operator (MacLaine) in his office building, unaware that she is having an affair with the head of personnel (MacMurray).

&quot;The Apartment&quot; was distributed by United Artists to widespread critical acclaim and was a commercial success, despite controversy owing to its subject matter. It became the 8th highest-grossing film of 1960. At the 33rd Academy Awards, the film was nominated for ten awards and won five, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Screenplay. Lemmon, MacLaine, and Kruschen were nominated for Best Actor, Best Actress, and Best Supporting Actor respectively, and Lemmon and MacLaine won Golden Globe Awards for their performances. &quot;Promises, Promises&quot;, a 1968 Broadway musical by Burt Bacharach, Hal David, and Neil Simon, was based on the film.

&quot;The Apartment&quot; has come to be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made, appearing in lists by the American Film Institute and &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine. In 1994, it was one of 25 films selected for inclusion to the Library of Congress National Film Registry.

==Plot==
C.C. &quot;Bud&quot; Baxter is a lonely office worker at an insurance company in New York City. To climb the corporate ladder, he allows four company managers to take turns borrowing his Upper West Side apartment for their extramarital affairs. Baxter meticulously juggles the &quot;booking&quot; schedule, but the steady stream of women convinces his neighbors that he is a playboy.

Baxter solicits glowing performance reviews from the four managers and submits them to personnel director Jeff Sheldrake, who then promises to promote him provided that Sheldrake also earns use of the apartment for his own affairs starting that night. As compensation for this short notice, he gives Baxter two tickets to see &quot;The Music Man&quot;. Bud asks Fran Kubelik, an elevator operator in the office building to whom he is attracted, to join him. She agrees, but first has dinner with a &quot;former fling&quot;, who turns out to be Sheldrake. When Sheldrake tells her that he plans to divorce his wife to be with her, they head to Baxter&#x27;s apartment, while Baxter waits outside the theater.

During the company&#x27;s raucous Christmas Eve party, Sheldrake&#x27;s secretary, Miss Olsen, tells Fran that her boss has had numerous affairs with other female employees, including herself. Fran confronts Sheldrake at Baxter&#x27;s apartment; he claims he loves her, but heads back to his family in White Plains.

Realizing that Fran is the woman Sheldrake has been taking to his apartment, Baxter lets himself be picked up by a married woman at a local bar. When they arrive at his apartment, he discovers Fran passed out on his bed from an overdose of sleeping pills. He ditches the woman from the bar and enlists his neighbor Dr. Dreyfuss to revive Fran. Baxter implies that he was responsible for the incident; Dreyfuss scolds him for philandering and advises him to &quot;be a &quot;mensch&quot;.&quot;

Fran spends two days recuperating in Baxter&#x27;s apartment, during which a bond develops between them, especially after he confesses to an earlier suicide attempt over unrequited love. Fran says that she has always suffered bad luck in her love life. 

As Baxter prepares a romantic dinner, one of the managers arrives for a tryst. Baxter persuades him and his companion to leave, but the manager recognizes Fran and later informs his colleagues. They are annoyed that they have not had the same ready access to the apartment since Baxter&#x27;s promotion. When Fran&#x27;s brother-in-law Karl shows up at the office building looking for her, the managers send him to the apartment. Baxter deflects Karl&#x27;s anger over Fran&#x27;s wayward behavior by once again assuming all responsibility. Karl punches him, and as she leaves, Fran kisses Baxter for protecting her.

When Sheldrake learns that Miss Olsen told Fran about his affairs, he fires her; she retaliates by spilling all to Sheldrake&#x27;s wife, who promptly throws him out. Sheldrake welcomes this as an excuse to pursue Fran, although she hints that she is losing interest. Having promoted Baxter to an even higher position, Sheldrake expects Baxter to lend him the key to his apartment yet again so that he can take Fran there. Instead, Baxter gives him back the key to the building&#x27;s &quot;executive washroom&quot;, proclaiming that he has decided to become a &quot;mensch&quot;, and quits the firm. He decides to move out of the apartment and begins to pack his belongings.

That night at a New Year&#x27;s Eve party, Sheldrake indignantly tells Fran about Baxter quitting, disclosing that Baxter refused to let him use his apartment, particularly with Fran. She abandons Sheldrake and runs to the apartment. At the door, Fran hears an apparent gunshot, but Baxter opens the door holding a bottle of just-opened champagne. Baxter declares his love for Fran. She smiles and says: “Shut up and deal”. The two resume a game of gin rummy that they had left unfinished earlier.

==Production==

Immediately following the success of &quot;Some Like It Hot&quot;, Wilder and Diamond wished to make another film with Jack Lemmon. Wilder had originally planned to cast Paul Douglas as Sheldrake; however, after he died unexpectedly, Fred MacMurray was cast.

The initial concept was inspired by &quot;Brief Encounter&quot; by Noël Coward, in which Laura Jesson (Celia Johnson) meets Alec Harvey (Trevor Howard) for a thwarted tryst in his friend&#x27;s apartment. However, Wilder was unable to make a film about adultery in the 1940s due to Hays Code restrictions. Wilder and Diamond also based the film partially on a Hollywood scandal in which agent Jennings Lang was shot by producer Walter Wanger for having an affair with Wanger&#x27;s wife, actress Joan Bennett; during the affair, Lang had used a low-level employee&#x27;s apartment for trysts. Another element of the plot was based on the experience of one of Diamond&#x27;s friends, who returned home after breaking up with his girlfriend to find that she had committed suicide in his bed.

Although Wilder generally required his actors to adhere exactly to the script, he allowed Lemmon to improvise in two scenes. In one scene, he squirts a bottle of nasal spray across the room, and in another, he sings while cooking spaghetti (which he strains through the grid of a tennis racket). In another scene, where Lemmon was supposed to mime being punched, he failed to move correctly, and was accidentally knocked down. Wilder chose to use the shot of the genuine punch in the film. Lemmon also caught a cold when one scene on a park bench was filmed in sub-zero weather.

Art director Alexandre Trauner used forced perspective to create the set of a large insurance company office. The set appeared to be a very long room full of desks and workers; however, successively smaller people and desks were placed to the back of the room, ending up with children. He designed the set of Baxter&#x27;s apartment to appear smaller and shabbier than the spacious apartments that usually appeared in films of the day. He used items from thrift stores and even some of Wilder&#x27;s own furniture for the set.

===Music===
The film&#x27;s title theme, written by Charles Williams and originally titled &quot;Jealous Lover&quot;, was first heard in the 1949 film &quot;The Romantic Age&quot;. A recording by Ferrante &amp; Teicher, released as &quot;Theme from &quot;The Apartment&quot;&quot;, reached #10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart later in 1960.

==Reception==

The film made double its $3 million budget at the US and Canadian box office in 1960. Critics were split on &quot;The Apartment&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; praised it, as did &quot;The New York Times&quot; film critic Bosley Crowther, who called the film &quot;gleeful, tender, and even sentimental&quot; and Wilder&#x27;s direction &quot;ingenious&quot;. &quot;Esquire&quot; critic Dwight Macdonald gave the film a poor review, calling it &quot;a paradigm of corny avantgardism&quot;. Others took issue with the film&#x27;s controversial depictions of infidelity and adultery, with critic Hollis Alpert of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; dismissing it as &quot;a dirty fairy tale&quot;.

MacMurray, having generally played guileless characters, related that after the film&#x27;s release he was accosted by women in the street who berated him for making a &quot;dirty filthy movie&quot;, and one of them hit him with her purse.

In 2001, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four stars out of four, and added it to his Great Movies list. The film critic Clarisse Loughrey has identified it as one of her two favorite movies, along with the 2010 film &quot;Boy&quot;. The film holds a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 103 reviews with an average rating of 8.8/10; the site&#x27;s consensus states that &quot;Director Billy Wilder&#x27;s customary cynicism is leavened here by tender humor, romance, and genuine pathos&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 94 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, and was awarded the &quot;Must-See&quot; badge.

==Awards and nominations==
Although Lemmon did not win the Oscar, Kevin Spacey dedicated his Oscar for &quot;American Beauty&quot; (1999) to Lemmon&#x27;s performance. According to the behind-the-scenes feature on the &quot;American Beauty&quot; DVD, the film&#x27;s director, Sam Mendes, had watched &quot;The Apartment&quot; (among other classic American films) as inspiration in preparation for shooting his film.

Within a few years after &quot;The Apartment&quot;&#x27;s release, the routine use of black-and-white film in Hollywood ended. Since &quot;The Apartment&quot; only two black-and-white movies have won the Academy Award for Best Picture: &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993) and &quot;The Artist&quot; (2011) (&quot;Oppenheimer&quot; was in partial black and white).

In 1994, &quot;The Apartment&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry. In 2002, a poll of film directors conducted by &quot;Sight and Sound&quot; magazine listed the film as the 14th greatest film of all time (tied with &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot;). In the 2012 poll by the same magazine directors voted the film 44th greatest of all time. The film was included in &quot;&quot;The New York Times&quot; Guide to the Best 1,000 Movies Ever Made&quot; in 2002. In 2006, &quot;Premiere&quot; voted this film as one of &quot;The 50 Greatest Comedies Of All Time&quot;. The Writers Guild of America ranked the film&#x27;s screenplay (written by Billy Wilder &amp; I.A.L. Diamond.) the 15th greatest ever. In 2015, &quot;The Apartment&quot; ranked 24th on BBC&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest American Films&quot; list, voted on by film critics from around the world. The film was selected as the 27th best comedy of all time in a poll of 253 film critics from 52 countries conducted by the BBC in 2017.

American Film Institute lists:

==Stage adaptation==

In 1968, Burt Bacharach, Hal David and Neil Simon created a musical adaptation titled &quot;Promises, Promises&quot; which opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre in New York City. Starring Jerry Orbach, Jill O&#x27;Hara and Edward Winter in the roles of Chuck, Fran and Sheldrake, the production closed in 1972. An all-star revival began in 2010 with Sean Hayes, Kristin Chenoweth and Tony Goldwyn as the three leads; this version added the Bacharach-David compositions &quot;I Say a Little Prayer&quot; and &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot; to the roster.

<doc id="43851" wikidata="Q205665" url="?curid=43851" title="Social norm">
<text>A social norm is a shared standard of acceptable behavior by a group. Social norms can both be informal understandings that govern the behavior of members of a society, as well as be codified into s and laws. Social normative influences or social norms, are deemed to be powerful drivers of human behavioural changes and well organized and incorporated by major theories which explain human behaviour. Institutions are composed of multiple norms. Norms are shared social beliefs about behavior; thus, they are distinct from &quot;ideas&quot;, &quot;attitudes&quot;, and &quot;values&quot;, which can be held privately, and which do not necessarily concern behavior. Norms are contingent on context, social group, and historical circumstances.

Scholars distinguish between regulative norms (which constrain behavior), constitutive norms (which shape interests), and prescriptive norms (which prescribe what actors &quot;ought&quot; to do). The effects of norms can be determined by a logic of appropriateness and logic of consequences; the former entails that actors follow norms because it is socially appropriate, and the latter entails that actors follow norms because of cost-benefit calculations.

Three stages have been identified in the life cycle of a norm: (1) Norm emergence – norm entrepreneurs seek to persuade others of the desirability and appropriateness of certain behaviors; (2) Norm cascade – when a norm obtains broad acceptance; and (3) Norm internalization – when a norm acquires a &quot;taken-for-granted&quot; quality. Norms are robust to various degrees: some norms are often violated whereas other norms are so deeply internalized that norm violations are infrequent. Evidence for the existence of norms can be detected in the patterns of behavior within groups, as well as the articulation of norms in group discourse.

In some societies, individuals often limit their potential due to social norms, while others engage in social movements to challenge and resist these constraints.

==Definition==

There are varied definitions of social norms, but there is agreement among scholars that norms are:

# social and shared among members of a group,
# related to behaviors and shape decision-making,
# proscriptive or prescriptive
# socially acceptable way of living by a group of people in a society.

In 1965, Jack P. Gibbs identified three basic normative dimensions that all concepts of norms could be subsumed under:

# &quot;a collective evaluation of behavior in terms of what it &quot;ought&quot; to be&quot;
# &quot;a collective expectation as to what behavior &quot;will be&quot;&quot;
# &quot;particular &quot;reactions&quot; to behavior&quot; (including attempts sanction or induce certain conduct)

According to Ronald Jepperson, Peter Katzenstein and Alexander Wendt, &quot;norms are collective expectations about proper behavior for a given identity.&quot; Wayne Sandholtz argues against this definition, as he writes that shared expectations are an &quot;effect&quot; of norms, not an intrinsic quality of norms. Sandholtz, Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink define norms instead as &quot;standards of appropriate behavior for actors with a given identity.&quot; In this definition, norms have an &quot;oughtness&quot; quality to them.

Michael Hechter and Karl-Dieter Opp define norms as &quot;cultural phenomena that prescribe and proscribe behavior in specific circumstances.&quot; Sociologists Christine Horne and Stefanie Mollborn define norms as &quot;group-level evaluations of behavior.&quot; This entails that norms are widespread expectations of social approval or disapproval of behavior. Scholars debate whether social norms are individual constructs or collective constructs.

Economist and game theorist Peyton Young defines norms as &quot;patterns of behavior that are self-enforcing within a group.&quot; He emphasizes that norms are driven by shared expectations: &quot;Everyone conforms, everyone is expected to conform, and everyone wants to conform when they expect everyone else to conform.&quot; He characterizes norms as devices that &quot;coordinate people&#x27;s expectations in interactions that possess multiple equilibria.&quot;

Concepts such as &quot;conventions&quot;, &quot;customs&quot;, &quot;morals&quot;, &quot;mores&quot;, &quot;rules&quot;, and &quot;laws&quot; have been characterized as equivalent to norms. Institutions can be considered collections or clusters of multiple norms. Rules and norms are not necessarily distinct phenomena: both are standards of conduct that can have varying levels of specificity and formality. Laws are a highly formal version of norms. Laws, rules and norms may be at odds; for example, a law may prohibit something but norms still allow it. Norms are not the equivalent of an aggregation of individual attitudes. Ideas, attitudes and values are not necessarily norms, as these concepts do not necessarily concern behavior and may be held privately. &quot;Prevalent behaviors&quot; and behavioral regularities are not necessarily norms. Instinctual or biological reactions, personal tastes, and personal habits are not necessarily norms.

==Emergence and transmission==
Groups may adopt norms in a variety of ways.

Some stable and self-reinforcing norms may emerge spontaneously without conscious human design. Peyton Young goes as far as to say that &quot;norms typically evolve without top-down direction... through interactions of individuals rather than by design.&quot; Norms may develop informally, emerging gradually as a result of repeated use of discretionary stimuli to control behavior. Not necessarily laws set in writing, informal norms represent generally accepted and widely sanctioned routines that people follow in everyday life. These informal norms, if broken, may not invite formal legal punishments or sanctions, but instead encourage reprimands, warnings, or othering; incest, for example, is generally thought of as wrong in society, but many jurisdictions do not legally prohibit it.

Norms may also be created and advanced through conscious human design by norm entrepreneurs. Norms can arise formally, where groups explicitly outline and implement behavioral expectations. Legal norms typically arise from design. A large number of these norms we follow &#x27;naturally&#x27; such as driving on the right side of the road in the US and on the left side in the UK, or not speeding in order to avoid a ticket.

Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink identify three stages in the life cycle of a norm:

# Norm emergence: Norm entrepreneurs seek to persuade others to adopt their ideas about what is desirable and appropriate.
# Norm cascade: When a norm has broad acceptance and reaches a tipping point, with norm leaders pressuring others to adopt and adhere to the norm.
# Norm internalization: When the norm has acquired a &quot;taken-for-granted&quot; quality where compliance with the norm is nearly automatic.

They argue that several factors may raise the influence of certain norms:
* Legitimation: Actors that feel insecure about their status and reputation may be more likely to embrace norms.
* Prominence: Norms that are held by actors seen as desirable and successful are more likely to diffuse to others.
* Intrinsic qualities of the norm: Norms that are specific, long-lasting, and universal are more likely to become prominent.
* Path dependency: Norms that are related to preexisting norms are more likely to be widely accepted.
* World time-context: Systemic shocks (such as wars, revolutions and economic crises) may motivate a search for new norms.
Christina Horne and Stefanie Mollborn have identified two broad categories of arguments for the emergence of norms:

# Consequentialism: norms are created when an individual&#x27;s behavior has consequences and externalities for other members of the group.
# Relationalism: norms are created because people want to attract positive social reactions. In other words, norms do not necessarily contribute to the collective good.

Per consequentialism, norms contribute to the collective good. However, per relationalism, norms do not necessarily contribute to the collective good; norms may even be harmful to the collective.

Some scholars have characterized norms as essentially unstable, thus creating possibilities for norm change. According to Wayne Sandholtz, actors are more likely to persuade others to modify existing norms if they possess power, can reference existing foundational meta-norms, and can reference precedents. Social closeness between actors has been characterized as a key component in sustaining social norms.

===Transfer of norms between groups===
Individuals may also import norms from a previous organization to their new group, which can get adopted over time. Without a clear indication of how to act, people typically rely on their history to determine the best course forward; what was successful before may serve them well again. In a group, individuals may all import different histories or scripts about appropriate behaviors; common experience over time will lead the group to define as a whole its take on the right action, usually with the integration of several members&#x27; schemas. Under the importation paradigm, norm formation occurs subtly and swiftly whereas with formal or informal development of norms may take longer.

Groups internalize norms by accepting them as reasonable and proper standards for behavior within the group. Once firmly established, a norm becomes a part of the group&#x27;s operational structure and hence more difficult to change. While possible for newcomers to a group to change its norms, it is much more likely that the new individual will adopt the group&#x27;s norms, values, and perspectives, rather than the other way around.

== Deviance from social norms ==

Deviance is defined as &quot;nonconformity to a set of norms that are accepted by a significant number of people in a community or society&quot; More simply put, if group members do not follow a norm, they become tagged as a deviant. In the sociological literature, this can often lead to them being considered outcasts of society. Yet, deviant behavior amongst children is somewhat expected. Except the idea of this deviance manifesting as a criminal action, the social tolerance given in the example of the child is quickly withdrawn against the criminal. Crime is considered one of the most extreme forms of deviancy according to scholar Clifford R. Shaw.

What is considered &quot;normal&quot; is relative to the location of the culture in which the social interaction is taking place. In psychology, an individual who routinely disobeys group norms runs the risk of turning into the &quot;institutionalized deviant.&quot; Similar to the sociological definition, institutionalized deviants may be judged by other group members for their failure to adhere to norms. At first, group members may increase pressure on a non-conformist, attempting to engage the individual in conversation or explicate why he or she should follow their behavioral expectations. The role in which one decides on whether or not to behave is largely determined on how their actions will affect others. Especially with new members who perhaps do not know any better, groups may use discretionary stimuli to bring an individual&#x27;s behavior back into line. Over time, however, if members continue to disobey, the group will give-up on them as a lost cause; while the group may not necessarily revoke their membership, they may give them only superficial consideration. If a worker is late to a meeting, for example, violating the office norm of punctuality, a supervisor or other co-worker may wait for the individual to arrive and pull him aside later to ask what happened. If the behavior continues, eventually the group may begin meetings without him since the individual &quot;is always late.&quot; The group generalizes the individual&#x27;s disobedience and promptly dismisses it, thereby reducing the member&#x27;s influence and footing in future group disagreements.

Group tolerance for deviation varies across membership; not all group members receive the same treatment for norm violations. Individuals may build up a &quot;reserve&quot; of good behavior through conformity, which they can borrow against later. These &quot;idiosyncrasy credits&quot; provide a theoretical currency for understanding variations in group behavioral expectations. A teacher, for example, may more easily forgive a straight-A student for misbehaving—who has past &quot;good credit&quot; saved up—than a repeatedly disruptive student. While past performance can help build idiosyncrasy credits, some group members have a higher balance to start with. Individuals can import idiosyncrasy credits from another group; childhood movie stars, for example, who enroll in college, may experience more leeway in adopting school norms than other incoming freshmen. Finally, leaders or individuals in other high-status positions may begin with more credits and appear to be &quot;above the rules&quot; at times. Even their idiosyncrasy credits are not bottomless, however; while held to a more lenient standard than the average member, leaders may still face group rejection if their disobedience becomes too extreme.

Deviance also causes multiple emotions one experiences when going against a norm. One of those emotions widely attributed to deviance is guilt. Guilt is connected to the ethics of duty which in turn becomes a primary object of moral obligation. Guilt is followed by an action that is questioned after its doing. It can be described as something negative to the self as well as a negative state of feeling. Used in both instances, it is both an unpleasant feeling as well as a form of self-punishment. Using the metaphor of &quot;dirty hands&quot;, it is the staining or tainting of oneself and therefore having to self cleanse away the filth. It is a form of reparation that confronts oneself as well as submitting to the possibility of anger and punishment from others. Guilt is a point in both action and feeling that acts as a stimulus for further &quot;honorable&quot; actions.

A 2023 study found that non-industrial societies varied in their punishments of norm violations. Punishment varied based on the types of norm violations and the socio-economic system of the society. The study &quot;found evidence that reputational punishment was associated with egalitarianism and the absence of food storage; material punishment was associated with the presence of food storage; physical punishment was moderately associated with greater dependence on hunting; and execution punishment was moderately associated with social stratification.&quot;

== Behavior ==
Whereas ideas in general do not necessarily have behavioral implications, Martha Finnemore notes that &quot;norms by definition concern behavior. One could say that they are collectively held ideas about behavior.&quot;

Norms running counter to the behaviors of the overarching society or culture may be transmitted and maintained within small subgroups of society. For example, Crandall (1988) noted that certain groups (e.g., cheerleading squads, dance troupes, sports teams, sororities) have a rate of bulimia, a publicly recognized life-threatening disease, that is much higher than society as a whole. Social norms have a way of maintaining order and organizing groups.

In the field of social psychology, the roles of norms are emphasized—which can guide behavior in a certain situation or environment as &quot;mental representations of appropriate behavior&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;aarts &amp; dijksterhuis/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that normative messages can promote pro-social behavior, including decreasing alcohol use, increasing voter turnout, and reducing energy use. According to the psychological definition of social norms&#x27; behavioral component, norms have two dimensions: how much a behavior is exhibited, and how much the group approves of that behavior.

== Social control ==
Although not considered to be formal laws within society, norms still work to promote a great deal of social control. They are statements that regulate conduct. The cultural phenomenon that is the norm is the prescriber of acceptable behavior in specific instances. Ranging in variations depending on culture, race, religion, and geographical location, it is the foundation of the terms some know as acceptable as not to injure others, the golden rule, and to keep promises that have been pledged. Without them, there would be a world without consensus, common ground, or restrictions. Even though the law and a state&#x27;s legislation is not intended to control social norms, society and the law are inherently linked and one dictates the other. This is why it has been said that the language used in some legislation is controlling and dictating for what should or should not be accepted. For example, the criminalization of familial sexual relations is said to protect those that are vulnerable, however even consenting adults cannot have sexual relationships with their relatives. The language surrounding these laws conveys the message that such acts are supposedly immoral and should be condemned, even though there is no actual victim in these consenting relationships.

Social norms can be enforced formally (e.g., through sanctions) or informally (e.g., through body language and non-verbal communication cues). Because individuals often derive physical or psychological resources from group membership, groups are said to control &quot;discretionary stimuli&quot;; groups can withhold or give out more resources in response to members&#x27; adherence to group norms, effectively controlling member behavior through rewards and operant conditioning. Social psychology research has found the more an individual values group-controlled resources or the more an individual sees group membership as central to his definition of self, the more likely he is to conform. Social norms also allow an individual to assess what behaviors the group deems important to its existence or survival, since they represent a codification of belief; groups generally do not punish members or create norms over actions which they care little about. Norms in every culture create conformity that allows for people to become socialized to the culture in which they live.

As social beings, individuals learn when and where it is appropriate to say certain things, to use certain words, to discuss certain topics or wear certain clothes, and when it is not. Thus, knowledge about cultural norms is important for s, which is an individual&#x27;s regulation of their nonverbal behavior. One also comes to know through experience what types of people he/she can and cannot discuss certain topics with or wear certain types of dress around. Typically, this knowledge is derived through experience (i.e. social norms are learned through social interaction). Wearing a suit to a job interview in order to give a great first impression represents a common example of a social norm in the white collar work force.

In his work &quot;Order without Law: How Neighbors Settle Disputes&quot;, Robert Ellickson studies various interactions between members of neighbourhoods and communities to show how societal norms create order within a small group of people. He argues that, in a small community or neighborhood, many rules and disputes can be settled without a central governing body simply by the interactions within these communities.

== Sociology ==
In sociology, norms are seen as rules that bind an individual&#x27;s actions to a specific sanction in one of two forms: a punishment or a reward. Through regulation of behavior, social norms create unique patterns that allow for distinguishing characteristics to be made between social systems. This creates a boundary that allows for a differentiation between those that belong in a specific social setting and those that do not.

For Talcott Parsons of the functionalist school, norms dictate the interactions of people in all social encounters. On the other hand, Karl Marx believed that norms are used to promote the creation of roles in society which allows for people of different levels of social class structure to be able to function properly. Marx claims that this power dynamic creates social order. James Coleman (sociologist) used both micro and macro conditions for his theory. For Coleman, norms start out as goal oriented actions by actors on the micro level. If the benefits do not outweigh the costs of the action for the actors, then a social norm would emerge. The norm&#x27;s effectiveness is then determined by its ability to enforce its sanctions against those who would not contribute to the &quot;optimal social order.&quot;

Heinrich Popitz is convinced that the establishment of social norms, that make the future actions of alter foreseeable for ego, solves the problem of contingency (Niklas Luhmann). In this way, ego can count on those actions as if they would already have been performed and does not have to wait for their actual execution; social interaction is thus accelerated. Important factors in the standardization of behavior are sanctions and social roles.

=== Operant conditioning ===
The probability of these behaviours occurring again is discussed in the theories of B. F. Skinner, who states that operant conditioning plays a role in the process of social norm development. Operant conditioning is the process by which behaviours are changed as a function of their consequences. The probability that a behaviour will occur can be increased or decreased depending on the consequences of said behaviour.

In the case of social deviance, an individual who has gone against a norm will contact the negative contingencies associated with deviance, this may take the form of formal or informal rebuke, social isolation or censure, or more concrete punishments such as fines or imprisonment. If one reduces the deviant behavior after receiving a negative consequence, then they have learned via punishment. If they have engaged in a behavior consistent with a social norm after having an aversive stimulus reduced, then they have learned via negative reinforcement. Reinforcement increases behavior, while punishment decreases behavior.

As an example of this, consider a child who has painted on the walls of her house, if she has never done this before she may immediately seek a reaction from her mother or father. The form of reaction taken by the mother or father will affect whether the behaviour is likely to occur again in the future. If her parent is positive and approving of the behaviour it will likely reoccur (reinforcement) however, if the parent offers an aversive consequence (physical punishment, time-out, anger etc...) then the child is less likely to repeat the behaviour in future (punishment).

Skinner also states that humans are conditioned from a very young age on how to behave and how to act with those around us considering the outside influences of the society and location one is in. Built to blend into the ambiance and attitude around us, deviance is a frowned upon action.

== Focus theory of normative conduct ==
Cialdini, Reno, and Kallgren developed the focus theory of normative conduct to describe how individuals implicitly juggle multiple behavioral expectations at once. Expanding on conflicting prior beliefs about whether cultural, situational or personal norms motivate action, the researchers suggested the focus of an individual&#x27;s attention will dictate what behavioral expectation they follow.

== Types ==
There is no clear consensus on how the term norm should be used.

Martha Finnemore and Kathryn Sikkink distinguish between three types of norms:

# Regulative norms: they &quot;order and constrain behavior&quot;
# Constitutive norms: they &quot;create new actors, interests, or categories of action&quot;
# Evaluative and prescriptive norms: they have an &quot;oughtness&quot; quality to them

Finnemore, Sikkink, Jeffrey W. Legro and others have argued that the robustness (or effectiveness) of norms can be measured by factors such as:
* The specificity of the norm: norms that are clear and specific are more likely to be effective
* The longevity of the norm: norms with a history are more likely to be effective
* The universality of the norm: norms that make general claims (rather than localized and particularistic claims) are more likely to be effective
* The prominence of the norm: norms that are widely accepted among powerful actors are more likely to be effective
Christina Horne argues that the robustness of a norm is shaped by the degree of support for the actors who sanction deviant behaviors; she refers to norms regulating how to enforce norms as &quot;metanorms.&quot; According to Beth G. Simmons and Hyeran Jo, diversity of support for a norm can be a strong indicator of robustness. They add that institutionalization of a norm raises its robustness. It has also been posited that norms that exist within broader clusters of distinct but mutually reinforcing norms may be more robust.

Jeffrey Checkel argues that there are two common types of explanations for the efficacy of norms:
* Rationalism: actors comply with norms due to coercion, cost-benefit calculations, and material incentives
* Constructivism: actors comply with norms due to social learning and socialization
According to Peyton Young, mechanisms that support normative behavior include:
* Coordination
* Social pressure
* Signaling
* Focal points

===Descriptive versus injunctive===
Descriptive norms depict what happens, while injunctive norms describe what &quot;should&quot; happen. Cialdini, Reno, and Kallgren (1990) define a descriptive norm as people&#x27;s perceptions of what is commonly done in specific situations; it signifies what most people do, without assigning judgment. The absence of trash on the ground in a parking lot, for example, transmits the descriptive norm that most people there do not litter. An Injunctive norm, on the other hand, transmits group approval about a particular behavior; it dictates how an individual &quot;should&quot; behave. Watching another person pick up trash off the ground and throw it out, a group member may pick up on the injunctive norm that he ought to not litter.

===Prescriptive and proscriptive norms===
Prescriptive norms are unwritten rules that are understood and followed by society and indicate what we should do. Expressing gratitude or writing a Thank You card when someone gives you a gift represents a prescriptive norm in American culture. Proscriptive norms, in contrast, comprise the other end of the same spectrum; they are similarly society&#x27;s unwritten rules about what one should not do. These norms can vary between cultures; while kissing someone you just met on the cheek is an acceptable greeting in some European countries, this is not acceptable, and thus represents a proscriptive norm in the United States.

===Subjective norms===
Subjective norms are determined by beliefs about the extent to which important others want a person to perform a behavior.When combined with attitude toward behavior, subjective norms shape an individual&#x27;s intentions. Social influences are conceptualized in terms of the pressure that people perceive from important others to perform, or not to perform, a behavior. Social Psychologist Icek Azjen theorized that subjective norms are determined by the strength of a given normative belief and further weighted by the significance of a social referent, as represented in the following equation: SN ∝ Σ&quot;nimi ,&quot; where (n) is a normative belief and (m) is the motivation to comply with said belief.

== Mathematical representations ==
Over the last few decades, several theorists have attempted to explain social norms from a more theoretical point of view. By quantifying behavioral expectations graphically or attempting to plot the logic behind adherence, theorists hoped to be able to predict whether or not individuals would conform. The return potential model and game theory provide a slightly more economic conceptualization of norms, suggesting individuals can calculate the cost or benefit behind possible behavioral outcomes. Under these theoretical frameworks, choosing to obey or violate norms becomes a more deliberate, quantifiable decision.

===Return potential model===

Developed in the 1960s, the return potential model provides a method for plotting and visualizing group norms. In the regular coordinate plane, the amount of behavior exhibited is plotted on the X-axis (label &quot;a&quot; in Figure 1) while the amount of group acceptance or approval gets plotted on the Y-axis (&quot;b&quot; in Figure 1). The graph represents the potential return or positive outcome to an individual for a given behavioral norm. Theoretically, one could plot a point for each increment of behavior how much the group likes or dislikes that action. For example, it may be the case that among first-year graduate students, strong social norms exist around how many daily cups of coffee a student drinks. If the return curve in Figure 1 correctly displays the example social norm, we can see that if someone drinks 0 cups of coffee a day, the group strongly disapproves. The group disapproves of the behavior of any member who drinks fewer than four cups of coffee a day; the group disapproves of drinking more than seven cups, shown by the approval curve dipping back below zero. As seen in this example, the return potential model displays how much group approval one can expect for each increment of behavior.
* Point of maximum return. The point with the greatest y-coordinate is called the point of maximum return, as it represents the amount of behavior the group likes the best. While &quot;c&quot; in Figure 1 is labeling the return curve in general, the highlighted point just above it at X=6, represents the point of maximum return. Extending our above example, the point of maximum return for first-year graduate students would be 6 cups of coffee; they receive the most social approval for drinking exactly that many cups. Any more or any fewer cups would decrease the approval.
* Range of tolerable behavior. Label &quot;d&quot; represents the range of tolerable behavior, or the amount of action the group finds acceptable. It encompasses all the positive area under the curve. In Figure 1, the range of tolerable behavior extends is 3, as the group approves of all behavior from 4 to 7 and 7-4=3. Carrying over our coffee example again, we can see that first-years only approve of having a limited number of cups of coffee (between 4 and 7); more than 7 cups or fewer than 4 would fall outside the range of tolerable behavior. Norms can have a narrower or wider range of tolerable behavior. Typically, a narrower range of behavior indicates a behavior with greater consequences to the group.
* Intensity. The intensity of the norm tells how much the group cares about the norm, or how much group affect is at stake to be won or lost. It is represented in the return potential model by the total amount of area subsumed by the curve, regardless of whether the area is positive or negative. A norm with low intensity would not vary far from the x-axis; the amount of approval or disapproval for given behaviors would be closer to zero. A high-intensity norm, however, would have more extreme approval ratings. In Figure 1, the intensity of the norm appears high, as few behaviors invoke a rating of indifference.
* Crystallization. Finally, norm crystallization refers to how much variance exists within the curve; translated from the theoretical back to the actual norm, it shows how much agreement exists between group members about the approval for a given amount of behavior. It may be that some members believe the norm more central to group functioning than others. A group norm like how many cups of coffee first years should drink would probably have low crystallization since a lot of individuals have varying beliefs about the appropriate amount of caffeine to imbibe; in contrast, the norm of not plagiarizing another student&#x27;s work would likely have high crystallization, as people uniformly agree on the behavior&#x27;s unacceptability. Showing the overall group norm, the return potential model in Figure 1 does not indicate the crystallization. However, a return potential model that plotted individual data points alongside the cumulative norm could demonstrate the variance and allow us to deduce crystallization.

===Game theory===

Another general formal framework that can be used to represent the essential elements of the social situation surrounding a norm is the repeated game of game theory. Rational choice, a branch of game theory, deals with the relations and actions socially committed among rational agents. A norm gives a person a rule of thumb for how they should behave. However, a rational person acts according to the rule only if it is beneficial for them. The situation can be described as follows. A norm gives an expectation of how other people act in a given situation (macro). A person acts optimally given the expectation (micro). For a norm to be stable, people&#x27;s actions must reconstitute the expectation without change (micro-macro feedback loop). A set of such correct stable expectations is known as a Nash equilibrium. Thus, a stable norm must constitute a Nash equilibrium. In the Nash equilibrium, no one actor has any positive incentive in individually deviating from a certain action. Social norms will be implemented if the actions of that specific norm come into agreement by the support of the Nash equilibrium in the majority of the game theoretical approaches.

From a game-theoretical point of view, there are two explanations for the vast variety of norms that exist throughout the world. One is the difference in games. Different parts of the world may give different environmental contexts and different people may have different values, which may result in a difference in games. The other is equilibrium selection not explicable by the game itself. Equilibrium selection is closely related to coordination. For a simple example, driving is common throughout the world, but in some countries people drive on the right and in other countries people drive on the left (see coordination game). A framework called comparative institutional analysis is proposed to deal with the game theoretical structural understanding of the variety of social norms.

<text>Reality is a concept that varies with context and culture. Reality may be viewed as the sum or aggregate of all objects in existence within the universe, as opposed to that which is only imaginary, nonexistent or nonactual. The term is also used to refer to the ontological status of things, indicating their existence. In physical terms, reality is the totality of a system, known and unknown.

Philosophical questions about the nature of reality or existence or being are considered under the rubric of ontology, which is a major branch of metaphysics in the Western philosophical tradition. Ontological questions also feature in diverse branches of philosophy, including the philosophy of science, of religion, of mathematics, and philosophical logic. These include questions about whether only physical objects are real (i.e., physicalism), whether reality is fundamentally immaterial (e.g. idealism), whether hypothetical unobservable entities posited by scientific theories exist, whether a god or gods exist, whether numbers and other abstract objects exist, and whether possible worlds exist. Epistemology is concerned with what can be known or inferred as likely and how, whereby in the modern world emphasis is put on reason, empirical evidence and science as sources and methods to determine or investigate reality.

== World views ==
=== World views and theories ===
A common colloquial usage would have &quot;reality&quot; mean &quot;perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes toward reality&quot;, as in &quot;My reality is not your reality.&quot; This is often used just as a colloquialism indicating that the parties to a conversation agree, or should agree, not to quibble over deeply different conceptions of what is real. For example, in a religious discussion between friends, one might say (attempting humor), &quot;You might disagree, but in my reality, everyone goes to heaven.&quot;

Reality can be defined in a way that links it to worldviews or parts of them (conceptual frameworks): Reality is the totality of all things, structures (actual and conceptual), events (past and present) and phenomena, whether observable or not. It is what a world view (whether it be based on individual or shared human experience) ultimately attempts to describe or map.
Certain ideas from physics, philosophy, sociology, literary criticism, and other fields shape various theories of reality. One such theory is that there simply and literally &quot;is&quot; no reality beyond the perceptions or beliefs we each have about reality. Such attitudes are summarized in popular statements, such as &quot;Perception is reality&quot; or &quot;Life is how you perceive reality&quot; or &quot;reality is what you can get away with&quot; (Robert Anton Wilson), and they indicate anti-realism – that is, the view that there is no objective reality, whether acknowledged explicitly or not.

Many of the concepts of science and philosophy are often defined culturally and socially. This idea was elaborated by Thomas Kuhn in his book &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot; (1962). &quot;The Social Construction of Reality&quot;, a book about the sociology of knowledge written by Peter L. Berger and Thomas Luckmann, was published in 1966. It explained how knowledge is acquired and used for the comprehension of reality. Out of all the realities, the reality of everyday life is the most important one since our consciousness requires us to be completely aware and attentive to the experience of everyday life.

== Western philosophy ==
Philosophy addresses two different aspects of the topic of reality: the nature of reality itself, and the relationship between the mind (as well as language and culture) and reality.

On the one hand, ontology is the study of being, and the central topic of the field is couched, variously, in terms of being, existence, &quot;what is&quot;, and reality. The task in ontology is to describe the most general categories of reality and how they are interrelated. If a philosopher wanted to proffer a positive definition of the concept &quot;reality&quot;, it would be done under this heading. As explained above, some philosophers draw a distinction between reality and existence. In fact, many analytic philosophers today tend to avoid the term &quot;real&quot; and &quot;reality&quot; in discussing ontological issues. But for those who would treat &quot;is real&quot; the same way they treat &quot;exists&quot;, one of the leading questions of analytic philosophy has been whether existence (or reality) is a property of objects. It has been widely held by analytic philosophers that it is &quot;not&quot; a property at all, though this view has lost some ground in recent decades.

On the other hand, particularly in discussions of objectivity that have feet in both metaphysics and epistemology, philosophical discussions of &quot;reality&quot; often concern the ways in which reality is, or is not, in some way &quot;dependent upon&quot; (or, to use fashionable jargon, &quot;constructed&quot; out of) mental and cultural factors such as perceptions, beliefs, and other mental states, as well as cultural artifacts, such as religions and political movements, on up to the vague notion of a common cultural world view, or .

=== Realism ===
The view that there is a reality independent of any beliefs, perceptions, etc., is called realism. More specifically, philosophers are given to speaking about &quot;realism &quot;about&quot;&quot; this and that, such as realism about universals or realism about the external world. Generally, where one can identify any class of object, the existence or essential characteristics of which is said not to depend on perceptions, beliefs, language, or any other human artifact, one can speak of &quot;realism &quot;about&quot;&quot; that object.

A correspondence theory of knowledge about what exists claims that &quot;true&quot; knowledge of reality represents accurate correspondence of statements about and images of reality with the actual reality that the statements or images are attempting to represent. For example, the scientific method can verify that a statement is true based on the observable evidence that a thing exists. Many humans can point to the Rocky Mountains and say that this mountain range exists, and continues to exist even if no one is observing it or making statements about it.

===Anti-realism===
One can also speak of &quot;anti&quot;-realism about the same objects. &quot;Anti-realism&quot; is the latest in a long series of terms for views opposed to realism. Perhaps the first was idealism, so called because reality was said to be in the mind, or a product of our &quot;ideas&quot;. Berkeleyan idealism is the view, propounded by the Irish empiricist George Berkeley, that the objects of perception are actually ideas in the mind. In this view, one might be tempted to say that reality is a &quot;mental construct&quot;; this is not quite accurate, however, since, in Berkeley&#x27;s view, perceptual ideas are created and coordinated by God. By the 20th century, views similar to Berkeley&#x27;s were called phenomenalism. Phenomenalism differs from Berkeleyan idealism primarily in that Berkeley believed that minds, or souls, are not merely ideas nor made up of ideas, whereas varieties of phenomenalism, such as that advocated by Russell, tended to go farther to say that the mind itself is merely a collection of perceptions, memories, etc., and that there is no mind or soul over and above such mental events. Finally, anti-realism became a fashionable term for &quot;any&quot; view which held that the existence of some object depends upon the mind or cultural artifacts. The view that the so-called external world is really merely a social, or cultural, artifact, called social constructionism, is one variety of anti-realism. Cultural relativism is the view that social issues such as morality are not absolute, but at least partially cultural artifact.

=== Being ===
The nature of being is a perennial topic in metaphysics. For instance, Parmenides taught that reality was a single unchanging Being, whereas Heraclitus wrote that all things flow. The 20th-century philosopher Heidegger thought previous philosophers have lost sight of the question of Being (qua Being) in favour of the questions of beings (existing things), so he believed that a return to the Parmenidean approach was needed. An ontological catalogue is an attempt to list the fundamental constituents of reality. The question of whether or not existence is a has been discussed since the Early Modern period, not least in relation to the ontological argument for the existence of God. Existence, &quot;that&quot; something is, has been contrasted with &quot;essence&quot;, the question of &quot;what&quot; something is.
Since existence without essence seems blank, it associated with nothingness by philosophers such as Hegel. Nihilism represents an extremely negative view of being, the absolute a positive one.

==== Explanations for the existence of something rather than nothing ====
=== Perception ===
The question of direct or &quot;naïve&quot; realism, as opposed to indirect or &quot;representational&quot; realism, arises in the philosophy of perception and of mind out of the debate over the nature of conscious experience; the epistemological question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by neural processes in our brain. Naïve realism is known as &quot;direct&quot; realism when developed to counter &quot;indirect&quot; or representative realism, also known as epistemological dualism, the philosophical position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an internal representation, a miniature virtual-reality replica of the world.

Timothy Leary coined the influential term Reality Tunnel, by which he means a kind of representative realism. The theory states that, with a subconscious set of mental filters formed from their beliefs and experiences, every individual interprets the same world differently, hence &quot;Truth is in the eye of the beholder&quot;. His ideas influenced the work of his friend Robert Anton Wilson.

=== Abstract objects and mathematics ===
The status of abstract entities, particularly numbers, is a topic of discussion in mathematics.

In the philosophy of mathematics, the best known form of realism about numbers is Platonic realism, which grants them abstract, immaterial existence. Other forms of realism identify mathematics with the concrete physical universe.

Anti-realist stances include formalism and fictionalism.

Some approaches are selectively realistic about some mathematical objects but not others. Finitism rejects infinite quantities. Ultra-finitism accepts finite quantities up to a certain amount. Constructivism and intuitionism are realistic about objects that can be explicitly constructed, but reject the use of the principle of the excluded middle to prove existence by reductio ad absurdum.

The traditional debate has focused on whether an abstract (immaterial, intelligible) realm of numbers has existed &quot;in addition to&quot; the physical (sensible, concrete) world. A recent development is the mathematical universe hypothesis, the theory that &quot;only&quot; a mathematical world exists, with the finite, physical world being an illusion within it.

An extreme form of realism about mathematics is the mathematical multiverse hypothesis advanced by Max Tegmark. Tegmark&#x27;s sole postulate is: &quot;All structures that exist mathematically also exist physically&quot;. That is, in the sense that &quot;in those [worlds] complex enough to contain self-aware substructures [they] will subjectively perceive themselves as existing in a physically &#x27;real&#x27; world&quot;. The hypothesis suggests that worlds corresponding to different sets of initial conditions, physical constants, or altogether different equations should be considered real. The theory can be considered a form of Platonism in that it posits the existence of mathematical entities, but can also be considered a mathematical monism in that it denies that anything exists except mathematical objects.

=== Properties ===
The problem of universals is an ancient problem in metaphysics about whether universals exist. Universals are general or abstract qualities, characteristics, properties, kinds or relations, such as being male/female, solid/liquid/gas or a certain colour, that can be predicated of individuals or particulars or that individuals or particulars can be regarded as sharing or participating in. For example, Scott, Pat, and Chris have in common the universal quality of &quot;being human&quot; or &quot;humanity&quot;.

The realist school claims that universals are real – they exist and are distinct from the particulars that instantiate them. There are various forms of realism. Two major forms are Platonic realism and Aristotelian realism. &quot;Platonic realism&quot; is the view that universals are real entities and they exist independent of particulars. &quot;Aristotelian realism&quot;, on the other hand, is the view that universals are real entities, but their existence is dependent on the particulars that exemplify them.

Nominalism and conceptualism are the main forms of anti-realism about universals.

=== Time and space ===
A traditional realist position in ontology is that time and space have existence apart from the human mind. Idealists deny or doubt the existence of objects independent of the mind. Some anti-realists whose ontological position is that objects outside the mind do exist, nevertheless doubt the independent existence of time and space.

Kant, in the &quot;Critique of Pure Reason&quot;, described time as an &quot;a priori&quot; notion that, together with other &quot;a priori&quot; notions such as space, allows us to comprehend sense experience. Kant denies that either space or time are substance, entities in themselves, or learned by experience; he holds rather that both are elements of a systematic framework we use to structure our experience. Spatial measurements are used to quantify how far apart objects are, and temporal measurements are used to quantitatively compare the interval between (or duration of) events. Although space and time are held to be &quot;transcendentally ideal&quot; in this sense, they are also &quot;empirically real&quot;, i.e. not mere illusions.

Idealist writers such as J. M. E. McTaggart in &quot;The Unreality of Time&quot; have argued that time is an illusion.

As well as differing about the reality of time as a whole, metaphysical theories of time can differ in their ascriptions of reality to the past, present and future separately.
* Presentism holds that the past and future are unreal, and only an ever-changing present is real.
* The block universe theory, also known as Eternalism, holds that past, present and future are all real, but the passage of time is an illusion. It is often said to have a scientific basis in relativity.
* The growing block universe theory holds that past and present are real, but the future is not.

Time, and the related concepts of process and evolution are central to the system-building metaphysics of A. N. Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne.

=== Possible worlds ===
The term &quot;possible world&quot; goes back to Leibniz&#x27;s theory of possible worlds, used to analyse necessity, possibility, and similar modal notions. Modal realism is the view, notably propounded by David Kellogg Lewis, that all possible worlds are as real as the actual world. In short: the actual world is regarded as merely one among an infinite set of logically possible worlds, some &quot;nearer&quot; to the actual world and some more remote. Other theorists may use the Possible World framework to express and explore problems without committing to it ontologically. Possible world theory is related to alethic logic: a proposition is &quot;necessary&quot; if it is true in all possible worlds, and &quot;possible&quot; if it is true in at least one. The many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is a similar idea in science.

=== Theories of everything (TOE) and philosophy ===
The philosophical implications of a physical TOE are frequently debated. For example, if philosophical physicalism is true, a physical TOE will coincide with a philosophical theory of everything.

The &quot;system building&quot; style of metaphysics attempts to answer &quot;all&quot; the important questions in a coherent way, providing a complete picture of the world. Plato and Aristotle could be said to be early examples of comprehensive systems. In the early modern period (17th and 18th centuries), the system-building &quot;scope&quot; of philosophy is often linked to the rationalist &quot;method&quot; of philosophy, that is the technique of deducing the nature of the world by pure &quot;a priori&quot; reason. Examples from the early modern period include the Leibniz&#x27;s Monadology, Descartes&#x27;s Dualism, Spinoza&#x27;s Monism. Hegel&#x27;s Absolute idealism and Whitehead&#x27;s Process philosophy were later systems.

Other philosophers do not believe its techniques can aim so high. Some scientists think a more mathematical approach than philosophy is needed for a TOE, for instance Stephen Hawking wrote in &quot;A Brief History of Time&quot; that even if we had a TOE, it would necessarily be a set of equations. He wrote, &quot;What is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a universe for them to describe?&quot;

=== Phenomenology ===
On a much broader and more subjective level, private experiences, curiosity, inquiry, and the selectivity involved in personal interpretation of events shapes reality as seen by one and only one person and hence is called phenomenological. While this
form of reality might be common to others as well, it could at times also be so unique to oneself as to never be experienced or agreed upon by anyone else. Much of the kind of experience deemed spiritual occurs on this level of reality.

Phenomenology is a philosophical method developed in the early years of the twentieth century by Edmund Husserl (1859–1938) and a circle of followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. Subsequently, phenomenological themes were taken up by philosophers in France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl&#x27;s work.

The word &quot;phenomenology&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;phainómenon&quot;, meaning &quot;that which appears&quot;, and &quot;lógos&quot;, meaning &quot;study&quot;. In Husserl&#x27;s conception, phenomenology is primarily concerned with making the structures of consciousness, and the phenomena which appear in acts of consciousness, objects of systematic reflection and analysis. Such reflection was to take place from a highly modified &quot;first person&quot; viewpoint, studying phenomena not as they appear to &quot;my&quot; consciousness, but to any consciousness whatsoever. Husserl believed that phenomenology could thus provide a firm basis for all human knowledge, including scientific knowledge, and could establish philosophy as a &quot;rigorous science&quot;.

Husserl&#x27;s conception of phenomenology has been criticised and developed by his student and assistant Martin Heidegger (1889–1976), by existentialists like Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961) and Jean-Paul Sartre (1905–1980), and by other philosophers, such as Paul Ricoeur (1913–2005), Emmanuel Levinas (1906–1995), and Dietrich von Hildebrand (1889–1977).

=== Skeptical hypotheses ===

Skeptical hypotheses in philosophy suggest that reality could be very different from what we think it is; or at least that we cannot prove it is not. Examples include:
* The &quot;Brain in a vat&quot; hypothesis is cast in scientific terms. It supposes that one might be a disembodied brain kept alive in a vat, and fed false sensory signals. This hypothesis is related to the Matrix hypothesis below.
* The &quot;Dream argument&quot; of Descartes and Zhuangzi supposes reality to be indistinguishable from a dream.
* Descartes&#x27; Evil demon is a being &quot;as clever and deceitful as he is powerful, who has directed his entire effort to misleading me.&quot;
* The five minute hypothesis (or omphalos hypothesis or Last Thursdayism) suggests that the world was created recently together with records and traces indicating a greater age.
* Diminished reality refers to artificially diminished reality, not due to limitations of sensory systems but via artificial filters.
* The Matrix hypothesis or Simulated reality hypothesis suggest that we might be inside a computer simulation or virtual reality. Related hypotheses may also involve simulations with signals that allow the inhabitant species in virtual or simulated reality to perceive the external reality.

== Non-western ancient philosophy and religion ==
=== Jain philosophy ===

Jain philosophy postulates that seven tattva (truths or fundamental principles) constitute reality. These seven &quot;tattva&quot; are:
# &quot;Jīva&quot; – The soul which is characterized by consciousness.
# &quot;Ajīva&quot; – The non-soul.
# &quot;Asrava&quot; – Influx of karma.
# &quot;Bandha&quot; – The bondage of karma.
# &quot;Samvara&quot; – Obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
# &quot;Nirjara&quot; – Shedding of karmas.
# &quot;Moksha&quot; – Liberation or Salvation, i.e. the complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul).

== Physical sciences ==

=== Scientific realism ===
Scientific realism is, at the most general level, the view that the world (the universe) described by science (perhaps ideal science) is the real world, as it is, independent of what we might take it to be. Within philosophy of science, it is often framed as an answer to the question &quot;how is the success of science to be explained?&quot; The debate over what the success of science involves centers primarily on the status of entities that are not directly observable discussed by scientific theories. Generally, those who are scientific realists state that one can make reliable claims about these entities (viz., that they have the same ontological status) as directly observable entities, as opposed to instrumentalism. The most used and studied scientific theories today state more or less the truth.

=== Realism and locality in physics ===

&quot;Realism&quot; in the sense used by physicists does not equate to realism in metaphysics. The latter is the claim that the world is mind-independent: that even if the results of a measurement do not pre-exist the act of measurement, that does not require that they are the creation of the observer. Furthermore, a mind-independent property does not have to be the value of some physical variable such as position or momentum. A property can be &quot;dispositional&quot; (or potential), i.e. it can be a tendency: in the way that glass objects tend to break, or are disposed to break, even if they do not &quot;actually&quot; break. Likewise, the mind-independent properties of quantum systems could consist of a tendency to respond to particular measurements with particular values with ascertainable probability. Such an ontology would be metaphysically realistic, without being realistic in the physicist&#x27;s sense of &quot;local realism&quot; (which would require that a single value be produced with certainty).

A closely related term is counterfactual definiteness (CFD), used to refer to the claim that one can meaningfully speak of the definiteness of results of measurements that have not been performed (i.e. the ability to assume the existence of objects, and properties of objects, even when they have not been measured).

Local realism is a significant feature of classical mechanics, of general relativity, and of classical electrodynamics; but not quantum mechanics. In a work now called the EPR paradox, Einstein relied on local realism to suggest that hidden variables were missing in quantum mechanics. However, John S. Bell subsequently showed that the predictions of quantum mechanics are inconsistent with hidden variables, a result known as Bell&#x27;s theorem. The predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified: Bell&#x27;s inequalities are violated, meaning either local realism &quot;or&quot; counterfactual definiteness must be incorrect. Different interpretations of quantum mechanics violate different parts of local realism and/or counterfactual definiteness.

The transition from &quot;possible&quot; to &quot;actual&quot; is a major topic of quantum physics, with related theories including quantum darwinism.

==== Role of &quot;observation&quot; in quantum mechanics ====

The quantum mind–body problem refers to the philosophical discussions of the mind–body problem in the context of quantum mechanics. Since quantum mechanics involves quantum superpositions, which are not perceived by observers, some interpretations of quantum mechanics place conscious observers in a special position.

The founders of quantum mechanics debated the role of the observer, and of them, Wolfgang Pauli and Werner Heisenberg believed that quantum mechanics expressed the observers knowledge and when an experiment was completed the additional knowledge should be incorporated in the wave function, an effect that came to be called state reduction or collapse. This point of view, which was never fully endorsed by Niels Bohr, was denounced as mystical and anti-scientific by Albert Einstein. Pauli accepted the term, and described quantum mechanics as &quot;lucid mysticism&quot;.

Heisenberg and Bohr always described quantum mechanics in logical positivist terms. Bohr also took an active interest in the philosophical implications of quantum theories such as his complementarity, for example. He believed quantum theory offers a complete description of nature, albeit one that is simply ill-suited for everyday experiences – which are better described by classical mechanics and probability. Bohr never specified a demarcation line above which objects cease to be quantum and become classical. He believed that it was not a question of physics, but one of philosophy.

Eugene Wigner reformulated the &quot;Schrödinger&#x27;s cat&quot; thought experiment as &quot;Wigner&#x27;s friend&quot; and proposed that the consciousness of an observer is the demarcation line which precipitates collapse of the wave function, independent of any realist interpretation. Commonly known as &quot;consciousness causes collapse&quot;, this controversial interpretation of quantum mechanics states that observation by a conscious observer is what makes the wave function collapse. However, this is a minority view among quantum philosophers, considering it a misunderstanding. There are other possible solutions to the &quot;Wigner&#x27;s friend&quot; thought experiment, which do not require consciousness to be different from other physical processes. Moreover, Wigner shifted to those interpretations in his later years.

=== Multiverse ===
The multiverse is the hypothetical set of multiple possible universes (including the historical universe we consistently experience) that together comprise everything that exists: the entirety of space, time, matter, and energy as well as the physical laws and constants that describe them. The term was coined in 1895 by the American philosopher and psychologist William James. In the many-worlds interpretation (MWI), one of the mainstream interpretations of quantum mechanics, there are an infinite number of universes and every possible quantum outcome occurs in at least one universe, albeit there is a debate as to how real the (other) worlds are.

The structure of the multiverse, the nature of each universe within it and the relationship between the various constituent universes, depend on the specific multiverse hypothesis considered. Multiverses have been hypothesized in cosmology, physics, astronomy, religion, philosophy, transpersonal psychology and fiction, particularly in science fiction and fantasy. In these contexts, parallel universes are also called &quot;alternative universes&quot;, &quot;quantum universes&quot;, &quot;interpenetrating dimensions&quot;, &quot;parallel dimensions&quot;, &quot;parallel worlds&quot;, &quot;alternative realities&quot;, &quot;alternative timelines&quot;, and &quot;dimensional planes&quot;, among others.

===Anthropic principle===
===Personal and collective reality===

Each individual has a different view of reality, with different memories and personal history, knowledge, personality traits and experience. This system, mostly referring to the human brain, affects cognition and behavior and into this complex new knowledge, memories, information, thoughts and experiences are continuously integrated. The connectome – neural networks/wirings in brains – is thought to be a key factor in human variability in terms of cognition or the way we perceive the world (as a context) and related features or processes. Sensemaking is the process by which people give meaning to their experiences and make sense of the world they live in. Personal identity is relating to questions like how a unique individual is persisting through time.

Sensemaking and determination of reality also occurs collectively, which is investigated in social epistemology and related approaches. From the collective intelligence perspective, the intelligence of the individual human (and potentially AI entities) is substantially limited and advanced intelligence emerges when multiple entities collaborate over time. Collective memory is an important component of the social construction of reality and communication and communication-related systems, such as media systems, may also be major components .

Philosophy of perception raises questions based on the evolutionary history of humans&#x27; perceptual apparatuses, particularly or especially individuals&#x27; physiological senses, described as &quot;[w]e don&#x27;t see reality—we only see what was useful to see in the past&quot;, partly suggesting that &quot;[o]ur species has been so successful not in spite of our inability to see reality but because of it&quot;.

=== Scientific theories of everything ===
A theory of everything (TOE) is a putative theory of theoretical physics that fully explains and links together all known physical phenomena, and predicts the outcome of &quot;any&quot; experiment that could be carried out &quot;in principle&quot;. The theory of everything is also called the final theory. Many candidate theories of everything have been proposed by theoretical physicists during the twentieth century, but none have been confirmed experimentally. The primary problem in producing a TOE is that general relativity and quantum mechanics are hard to unify. This is one of the unsolved problems in physics.

Initially, the term &quot;theory of everything&quot; was used with an ironic connotation to refer to various overgeneralized theories. For example, a great-grandfather of Ijon Tichy, a character from a cycle of Stanisław Lem&#x27;s science fiction stories of the 1960s, was known to work on the &quot;General Theory of Everything&quot;. Physicist John Ellis claims to have introduced the term into the technical literature in an article in &quot;Nature&quot; in 1986. Over time, the term stuck in popularizations of quantum physics to describe a theory that would unify or explain through a single model the theories of all fundamental interactions and of all particles of nature: general relativity for gravitation, and the standard model of elementary particle physics – which includes quantum mechanics – for electromagnetism, the two nuclear interactions, and the known elementary particles.

Current candidates for a theory of everything include string theory, M theory, and loop quantum gravity.

== Technology ==

=== Media ===

Media – such as news media, social media, websites including Wikipedia, and fiction – shape individuals&#x27; and society&#x27;s perception of reality (including as part of belief and attitude formation) and are partly used intentionally as means to learn about reality. Various technologies have changed society&#x27;s relationship with reality such as the advent of radio and TV technologies.

Research investigates interrelations and effects, for example aspects in the social construction of reality. A major component of this shaping and representation of perceived reality is agenda, selection and prioritization – not only (or primarily) the quality, tone and types of content – which influences, for instance, the public agenda. Disproportional news attention for low-probability incidents – such as high-consequence accidents – can distort audiences&#x27; risk perceptions with harmful consequences. Various biases such as false balance, public attention dependence reactions like sensationalism and domination by &quot;current events&quot;, as well as various interest-driven uses of media such as marketing can also have major impacts on the perception of reality. Time-use studies found that e.g. in 2018 the average U.S. American &quot;spent around eleven hours every day looking at screens&quot;.

==== Filter bubbles and echo chambers ====


=== Virtual reality and cyberspace ===
Virtual reality (VR) is a computer-simulated environment that can simulate physical presence in places in the real world, as well as in imaginary worlds.

The virtuality continuum is a continuous scale ranging between the completely virtual, a virtuality, and the completely real: reality. The reality–virtuality continuum therefore encompasses all possible variations and compositions of real and virtual objects. It has been described as a concept in new media and computer science, but in fact it could be considered a matter of anthropology. The concept was first introduced by Paul Milgram.

The area between the two extremes, where both the real and the virtual are mixed, is the so-called mixed reality. This in turn is said to consist of both augmented reality, where the virtual augments the real, and augmented virtuality, where the real augments the virtual.
Cyberspace, the world&#x27;s computer systems considered as an interconnected whole, can be thought of as a virtual reality; for instance, it is portrayed as such in the cyberpunk fiction of William Gibson and others. &quot;Second Life&quot; and MMORPGs such as &quot;World of Warcraft&quot; are examples of artificial environments or virtual worlds (falling some way short of full virtual reality) in cyberspace.

=== &quot;RL&quot; in internet culture ===
On the Internet, &quot;real life&quot; refers to life in the real world. It generally references life or consensus reality, in contrast to an environment seen as fiction or fantasy, such as virtual reality, lifelike experience, dreams, novels, or movies. Online, the acronym &quot;IRL&quot; stands for &quot;in real life&quot;, with the meaning &quot;not on the Internet&quot;. Sociologists engaged in the study of the Internet have determined that someday, a distinction between online and real-life worlds may seem &quot;quaint&quot;, noting that certain types of online activity, such as sexual intrigues, have already made a full transition to complete legitimacy and &quot;reality&quot;. The abbreviation &quot;RL&quot; stands for &quot;real life&quot;. For example, one can speak of &quot;meeting in RL&quot; someone whom one has met in a chat or on an Internet forum. It may also be used to express an inability to use the Internet for a time due to &quot;RL problems&quot;.

[p. 30.] The deeper physicists dive into reality, the more reality seems to evaporate.&quot; [p. 34.]

<text>Peter Bogdanovich (July 30, 1939 – January 6, 2022) was an American director, writer, actor, producer, critic, and film historian. He started out his career as a young actor studying under Stella Adler before working as a film critic for &quot;Film Culture&quot; and &quot;Esquire&quot; and finally becoming a prominent filmmaker of the New Hollywood movement. He received accolades including a BAFTA Award and Grammy Award, as well as nominations for two Academy Awards and two Golden Globe Awards.

Bogdanovich worked as a film journalist until he was hired to work on Roger Corman&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Angels&quot; (1966). His credited feature film debut came with &quot;Targets&quot; (1968), before his career breakthrough with the drama &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; (1971) which earned him Academy Award nominations for Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, and the acclaimed films &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot; (1972) and &quot;Paper Moon&quot; (1973). Other films include &quot;Saint Jack&quot; (1979), &quot;They All Laughed&quot; (1981), &quot;Mask&quot; (1985), &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1992), &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot; (2001), and &quot;She&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot; (2014).

As an actor, Bogdanovich was known for his roles in the HBO series &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and Orson Welles&#x27;s last film, &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot; (2018), which he also helped finish.

Bogdanovich directed documentaries such as &quot;Directed by John Ford&quot; (1971) and &quot;The Great Buster: A Celebration&quot; (2018). He received a Grammy Award for Best Music Film for directing &quot;Runnin&#x27; Down a Dream&quot; (2007), a documentary about Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. He also published numerous books, some of which include in-depth interviews with friends Howard Hawks, Alfred Hitchcock, and Orson Welles. Bogdanovich&#x27;s works have been cited as important influences by many major filmmakers.

==Early life==
Peter Bogdanovich () was born in Kingston, New York, the son of Herma (née Robinson) and Borislav Bogdanovich, a pianist and painter. His father was of Serbian descent and his mother was of Austrian Jewish descent. Bogdanovich was fluent in Serbian, having learned it before English. He had an older brother who died in an accident in 1938, at eighteen months of age, after a pot of boiling soup fell on him, though Bogdanovich did not learn about his brother until he was seven and did not know the circumstances of his death until he was an adult. His parents both arrived in the U.S. in May 1939 on visitors&#x27; visas, along with his mother&#x27;s immediate family, three months before the onset of World War II. In 1952, when he was twelve, Bogdanovich began keeping a record of every film he saw on index cards, complete with reviews; he continued to do so until 1970. He saw up to four hundred films a year. He graduated from New York City&#x27;s Collegiate School in 1957 and studied acting at the Stella Adler Conservatory.

==Career==
===1960s===
In the early 1960s, Bogdanovich was known as a film programmer at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, where he programmed influential retrospectives and wrote monographs for the films of Orson Welles, John Ford, Howard Hawks, and Alfred Hitchcock. Bogdanovich also brought attention to Allan Dwan, a pioneer of American film who had fallen into obscurity by then, in a 1971 retrospective Dwan attended. He also programmed for New Yorker Theater.

Before becoming a director, he wrote for &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, and &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; as a film critic. These articles were collected in &quot;Pieces of Time&quot; (1973).

In 1966, following the example of &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot; critics François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, and Éric Rohmer, who had created the Nouvelle Vague (&quot;New Wave&quot;) by making their own films, Bogdanovich decided to become a director. Encouraged by director Frank Tashlin, whom he would interview in his book &quot;Who the Devil Made It&quot;, Bogdanovich headed for Los Angeles with his wife Polly Platt and in so doing, left his rent unpaid.

Intent on breaking into the industry, Bogdanovich would ask publicists for movie premiere and industry party invitations. At one screening, Bogdanovich was viewing a film and director Roger Corman was sitting behind him. The two struck up a conversation when Corman mentioned he liked a cinema piece Bogdanovich wrote for &quot;Esquire&quot;. Corman offered him a directing job, which Bogdanovich accepted immediately. He worked with Corman on &quot;Targets&quot;, which starred Boris Karloff, and &quot;Voyage to the Planet of Prehistoric Women&quot;, under the pseudonym Derek Thomas. Bogdanovich later said of the Corman school of filmmaking, &quot;I went from getting the laundry to directing the picture in three weeks. Altogether, I worked 22 weeks – preproduction, shooting, second unit, cutting, dubbing – I haven&#x27;t learned as much since.&quot;

===1970s===
Returning to journalism, Bogdanovich struck up a lifelong friendship with Orson Welles while interviewing him on the set of Mike Nichols&#x27;s &quot;Catch-22&quot;. Bogdanovich played a major role in reviving Welles and his career with his writings on the actor-director, including his book &quot;This is Orson Welles&quot;. In the early 1970s, when Welles was having financial problems, Bogdanovich let him stay at his Bel Air mansion for a couple of years.

In 1970, Bogdanovich was commissioned by the American Film Institute to direct a documentary about John Ford for their tribute, &quot;Directed by John Ford&quot;. The resulting film included candid interviews with John Wayne, James Stewart, and Henry Fonda, and was narrated by Orson Welles. Out of circulation for years due to licensing issues, Bogdanovich and TCM released it in 2006, re-edited it to make it &quot;faster and more incisive&quot;, with additional interviews with Clint Eastwood, Walter Hill, Harry Carey Jr., Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, and others.

Much of the inspiration that led Bogdanovich to his cinematic creations came from early viewings of the film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;. In an interview with Robert K. Elder, author of &quot;The Film That Changed My Life&quot;, Bogdanovich explains his appreciation of Orson Welles&#x27;s work:It&#x27;s just not like any other movie you know. It&#x27;s the first modern film: fragmented, not told straight ahead, jumping around. It anticipates everything that&#x27;s being done now, and which is thought to be so modern. It&#x27;s all become really decadent now, but it was certainly fresh then.

The 32-year-old Bogdanovich was hailed by critics as a &quot;Wellesian&quot; wunderkind when his best-received film, &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, was released in 1971. The film earned eight Academy Award nominations, including Best Director, and won two statues, for Cloris Leachman and Ben Johnson in the supporting acting categories. Bogdanovich co-wrote the screenplay with Larry McMurtry, and it won the 1971 BAFTA award for Best Screenplay. Bogdanovich cast the 21-year-old model Cybill Shepherd in a major role in the film and fell in love with her, an affair leading to his divorce from Polly Platt, his longtime artistic collaborator and the mother of his two daughters.

Bogdanovich followed up &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; with the screwball comedy &quot;What&#x27;s Up, Doc?&quot;, starring Barbra Streisand and Ryan O&#x27;Neal. Bogdanovich then formed The Directors Company with Francis Ford Coppola and William Friedkin and co-owned by Paramount Pictures. Paramount allowed the directors to make a minimum of twelve films with a budget of $3 million each. It was through this entity that Bogdanovich&#x27;s &quot;Paper Moon&quot; was produced.

&quot;Paper Moon&quot;, a Depression-era comedy starring Ryan O&#x27;Neal that won his 10-year-old daughter Tatum O&#x27;Neal an Oscar as Best Supporting Actress, proved the high-water mark of Bogdanovich&#x27;s career. Forced to share the profits with his fellow directors, Bogdanovich became dissatisfied with the arrangement. The Directors Company subsequently produced only two more pictures, Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Conversation&quot; (1974, which was nominated for Best Picture in 1974 alongside &quot;The Godfather Part II&quot;), and Bogdanovich&#x27;s Cybill Shepherd vehicle, &quot;Daisy Miller&quot;, which had a lackluster critical reception and was a disappointment at the box office. The partners of The Directors Company all went their separate ways after the production of &quot;Daisy Miller&quot;.

Bogdanovich&#x27;s next effort, &quot;At Long Last Love&quot;, was a musical starring Shepherd and Burt Reynolds. Both that and his next film, &quot;Nickelodeon&quot;, were critical and box-office disasters, severely damaging his standing in the film community. Reflecting upon his recent career, Bogdanovich said in 1976, &quot;I was dumb. I made a lot of mistakes.&quot;

In 1975, he sued Universal for breaching a contract to produce and direct &quot;Bugsy&quot;. He then took a few years off, then returned to directing with a lower-budgeted film, &quot;Saint Jack&quot;, which was filmed in Singapore and starred Ben Gazzara in the title role. The film earned critical praise, although was not a box-office hit. The making of this film marked the end of his romantic relationship with Cybill Shepherd.

===1980s===
Bogdanovich&#x27;s next film was the romantic comedy &quot;They All Laughed&quot; which featured Dorothy Stratten, a former model and &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate of the Month for August 1979 and Playmate of the Year in 1980, who began a romantic relationship with Bogdanovich. He took over distribution of &quot;They All Laughed&quot; himself. Bogdanovich later blamed this for his filing for bankruptcy in 1985. He declared he had a monthly income of $75,000 and monthly expenses of $200,000.

Shortly after the film finished shooting, Stratten was murdered by her estranged husband Paul Snider, who then killed himself. To cope with the tragedy, Bogdanovich began writing &quot;The Killing of the Unicorn&quot;, a memoir detailing the relationship between Stratten and himself, the making of &quot;They All Laughed&quot; and her murder. &quot;I wanted to understand what happened to her,&quot; said Bogdanovich, &quot;I felt I couldn&#x27;t move forward with my life, creative or otherwise until I did.&quot; Bogdanovich said the book was meant to be delivered to William Morrow and Company in August 1982, &quot;but new facts kept coming to light and so it was delayed. I did more and more rewriting. In all, I suppose, I wrote the book five times.&quot; The book was eventually published in 1984.

Stratten&#x27;s murder was highly publicized, with Teresa Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Playmate&quot; article even claiming that she was as much a victim of Bogdanovich and &quot;Playboy&quot; mogul Hugh Hefner as she was Snider. Carpenter&#x27;s article then served as the basis for Bob Fosse&#x27;s film &quot;Star 80&quot;. Bogdanovich opposed the production and refused to allow the film to use his name. He was portrayed as the fictional &quot;Aram Nicholas&quot;, and he threatened litigation if he found the character objectionable. Shortly after, Hefner accused Bogdanovich of seducing Stratten&#x27;s younger sister Louise when she was 13. On December 30, 1988, the 49-year-old Bogdanovich married 20-year-old Louise, sparking a tabloid frenzy.

After Stratten&#x27;s murder, Bogdanovich said he &quot;didn&#x27;t go out much&quot;, but one day got a call from his friend John Cassavetes who asked him to direct Diahnne Abbott in a scene from his film &quot;Love Streams&quot; to help get him out of the house. Despite Bogdanovich&#x27;s contribution to the film, which even he himself admitted was minor, Cassavetes tried to get the Directors Guild to give him a shared credit.

Bogdanovich had wanted to make &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember April&quot; with Cassavetes and &quot;The Lady in the Moon&quot; written with Larry McMurtry, but returned to directing officially with &quot;Mask&quot;, which was released in 1985 to critical acclaim and strong box office returns. The film was released with a song score by Bob Seger against Bogdanovich&#x27;s wishes (he favored Bruce Springsteen). A director&#x27;s cut of the film, slightly longer and with Springsteen&#x27;s songs, was belatedly released on DVD in 2004.

Bogdanovich directed the comedy &quot;Illegally Yours&quot; in 1988, starring Rob Lowe. Bogdanovich later disowned the film, saying he had &quot;high hopes for it&quot;, but that it had been completely re-cut by Dino De Laurentiis, the film&#x27;s distributor.

===1990s===
In 1990, Bogdanovich adapted Larry McMurtry&#x27;s novel &quot;Texasville&quot;, a sequel to &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, into a film. It is set 32 years after the events of &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot;, and Jeff Bridges and Cybill Shepherd both reprised their roles as Duane and Jacy. It was a critical and box office disappointment relative to the first film. Bogdanovich often complained that the version of &quot;Texasville&quot; that was released was not the film he had intended. His cut of &quot;Texasville&quot; was later released on LaserDisc, and the theatrical cut was released on DVD by MGM in 2005. After the release of &quot;Texasville&quot;, Bogdanovich revisited &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; and produced a modified director&#x27;s cut for The Criterion Collection which includes seven minutes of previously unseen footage and re-edited scenes.

In 1991, Bogdanovich developed an alternative calendar, titled &quot;A Year and a Day: Goddess Engagement Calendar&quot;. The calendar consisted of 13 months of 28 days and a bonus day to equal 365 days. Each month was named after a different species of tree. Bogdanovich attributed his inspiration for the calendar to the works of Robert Graves.

Bogdanovich directed two more theatrical films in 1992 and 1993, but neither film recaptured the success of his early career. One, &quot;Noises Off&quot;, was based on a stage play by Michael Frayn, while another, &quot;The Thing Called Love&quot;, is better known as one of River Phoenix&#x27;s last roles before his death. In the mid-90s, Bogdanovich began to work in television, directing films such as &quot;To Sir, with Love II&quot;. In 1997, he declared bankruptcy again. Drawing from his encyclopedic knowledge of film history, he wrote several critically lauded books, including &quot;Who the Devil Made It&quot;, featuring archival interviews that Bogdanovich had held with famous Hollywood directors, and &quot;Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s Movie of the Week&quot;, which offered the lifelong cinephile&#x27;s commentary on 52 of his favorite films.

===2000s===
In 2001, Bogdanovich resurfaced with &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Meow&quot;, his return once again to a reworking of the past, this time the alleged killing of director Thomas Ince by William Randolph Hearst. The film was a modest critical success but made little money at the box-office. Bogdanovich said that he was told the story of the alleged Ince murder by Welles, who in turn said he heard it from writer Charles Lederer.

In addition to directing some television work, Bogdanovich returned to acting with a recurring guest role on the cable television series &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, playing Dr. Melfi&#x27;s psychotherapist, also later directing a fifth-season episode. He had a voice role, as Bart Simpson&#x27;s therapist&#x27;s analyst in an episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and appeared as himself in the &quot;Robots Versus Wrestlers&quot; episode of &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot;. Quentin Tarantino cast Bogdanovich as a disc jockey in &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; and &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 2&quot;. &quot;Quentin knows, because he&#x27;s such a movie buff, that when you hear a disc jockey&#x27;s voice in my pictures, it&#x27;s always me, sometimes doing different voices&quot;, said Bogdanovich. &quot;So he called me and he said, &#x27;I stole your voice from &quot;The Last Picture Show&quot; for the rough cut, but I need you to come down and do that voice again for my picture ... &#x27;&quot; He hosted &quot;The Essentials&quot; on Turner Classic Movies, but was replaced in May 2006 by TCM host Robert Osborne and film critic Molly Haskell. Bogdanovich hosted introductions to movies on Criterion Collection DVDs, and had a supporting role in the critically praised mini-series &quot;Out of Order&quot;.

In 2006, Bogdanovich joined forces with ClickStar, where he hosted a classic film channel, Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s Golden Age of Movies. Bogdanovich also wrote a blog for the site. In 2003, he appeared in the BBC documentary &quot;Easy Riders, Raging Bulls&quot;, and in 2006 he appeared in the documentary &quot;Wanderlust&quot;. The following year, Bogdanovich was presented with an award for outstanding contribution to film preservation by the International Federation of Film Archives (FIAF) at the Toronto International Film Festival.

===2010s===
In 2010, Bogdanovich joined the directing faculty at the School of Filmmaking at the University of North Carolina School of the Arts. On April 17, 2010, he was awarded the Master of Cinema Award at the 12th Annual RiverRun International Film Festival. In 2011, he was given the Auteur Award by the International Press Academy, which is awarded to filmmakers whose singular vision and unique artistic control over the elements of production give a personal and signature style to their films.

In 2012, Bogdanovich made news with an essay in &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, published in the aftermath of the Aurora, Colorado theater shooting, in which he argued against excessive violence in the movies:

In 2014, Bogdanovich&#x27;s last narrative film, &quot;She&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot;, was released in theaters and on-demand, followed by the documentary, &quot;The Great Buster: A Celebration&quot; in 2018. In 2018, Orson Welles&#x27; long-delayed film &quot;The Other Side of the Wind&quot;, which was filmed in the 1970s and featured a prominent supporting role by Bogdanovich, who had long hoped to complete it, was released by Netflix to critical acclaim.

One of his final hopes was to direct a personal passion project he had worked on since the 1980s titled &quot;Wait for Me&quot; which Bogdanovich had described as a &quot;ghost picture&quot;, the likes of &quot;The Ghost Goes West&quot;, that was directly inspired by his relationship with Dorothy Stratten. In a July 2015 interview for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Bogdanovich revealed that Brett Ratner was going to produce the film, and that they were currently in the process of attaching actors. The plot, as described by Bogdanovich, would have followed a washed-up Hollywood director/star (someone like Orson Welles or Charlie Chaplin), who is visited by the ghost of his last wife, who was killed six years earlier in a plane crash.

===2020s===
Bogdanovich collaborated with Turner Classic Movies, and host Ben Mankiewicz, to create a documentary podcast about his life, which premiered in 2020. That same year, a copy of his original cut of &quot;She&#x27;s Funny That Way&quot;, originally titled &quot;Squirrels to the Nuts&quot;, was found on eBay. In the wake of the director&#x27;s passing, the cut was shown at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art beginning on March 28, 2022.

Weeks before his death, Bogdanovich collaborated with Kim Basinger to create &quot;LIT Project 2: Flux&quot;, a first of its kind short film made available on the Ethereum blockchain as a non-fungible token. The project was scheduled to be released on January 25, 2022. He also wrote an as-yet unreleased book called &quot;Five American Icons&quot; featuring long interviews with Arthur Miller, Lauren Bacall, Kirk Douglas, Jack Nicholson and Clint Eastwood, and was working on developing a new screenplay, with the help of author Sam Kashner, titled &quot;Our Love Is Here to Stay&quot; about composers George and Ira Gershwin. According to Louise Stratten, after they had finished the script, Guillermo del Toro was involved to produce the film at Netflix. Stratten also noted that, prior to his death, Bogdanovich had completed his memoirs, which he wanted to call &quot;All I Wanna Do is Direct&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Bogdanovich died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease at his home in Toluca Lake, on January 6, 2022, at the age of 82. Since his death, many directors, actors, and other public figures have paid tribute to him, including Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, Jennifer Aniston, Barbra Streisand, Cher, William Friedkin, Guillermo del Toro, James Gunn, Ellen Burstyn, Laura Dern, Joe Dante, Bryan Adams, Ben Stiller, Jeff Bridges, Michael Imperioli, Paul Feig and Viola Davis. Peter Bradshaw of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described him as &quot;a loving cineaste and fearless genius of cinema.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Bogdanovich as &quot;[a genius] of the Hollywood system who, with great success and frustration, worked to transform it in the same era.&quot;

His work has been cited as an influence by such filmmakers as Quentin Tarantino, David Fincher, Sofia Coppola, Wes Anderson, Noah Baumbach, Richard Linklater, Edgar Wright, Brett Ratner, M. Night Shyamalan, David O. Russell, James Mangold, Jon Watts, Rian Johnson, and the Safdie brothers.

On September 29, 2022, Louise Stratten announced that she was seeking a publisher for Bogdanovich&#x27;s memoirs, as well as working on putting out episodes of a podcast series Bogdanovich had started called &quot;One Handshake Away&quot;, where contemporary filmmakers were invited to discuss and listen to archival recordings of classic Hollywood directors whom Bogdanovich had interviewed. Guests include Guillermo del Toro ( &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&quot;), Rian Johnson ( &quot;Orson Welles&quot;), Quentin Tarantino ( &quot;Don Siegel&quot;), and Ken Burns ( &quot;John Ford&quot;). The episodes eventually aired in February 2024, two years after Bogdanovich&#x27;s death, through Audacy. Del Toro contributed three additional interviews with Greta Gerwig ( &quot;Howard Hawks&quot;), Julie Delpy ( &quot;Fritz Lang&quot;) and Allison Anders ( &quot;Raoul Walsh&quot;).

<text>Odense University was a university in Odense, Denmark. It was established in 1966. In 1998, the university was merged with two other institutions to form the University of Southern Denmark. Its campus is now known as University of Southern Denmark Odense (&quot;Syddansk Universitet Odense&quot;, abbr. SDU Odense) and is the university&#x27;s biggest campus.

==History==
The university was established in 1966. It had four faculties: Humanities, Social Sciences, Health Science and Natural Sciences.

In 1998, Odense University was merged with the Southern Denmark School of Business and Engineering and the South Jutland University Centre to form the University of Southern Denmark. The campus is now known as SDU Odense, and is considered the main campus of the University of Southern Denmark, both because of its relative size and because the central administration of the university is situated there.

==Campus==
Being an epitome of Danish functionalist architecture, the campus has been nicknamed &quot;Rustenborg&quot; (which roughly translates as &quot;The Rusty Castle&quot;) by students and staff, because it is built from gray concrete slabs clad with weathering steel, in an early architectural use of that material. Its architecture has also given rise to other nicknames and slang expressions among students and staff. For instance, the administrative block goes by the name of &quot;Førerbunkeren&quot; (&quot;Führerbunker&quot;), referring to the architectural similarities between the university building and a stereotypical military building. The University of Southern Denmark&#x27;s students&#x27; magazine is simply called &quot;Rust&quot;.

==Motto and logo==
When abbreviated, the university motto becomes &quot;FIONIA&quot;, the Latin name for Funen. The motto was created by the university&#x27;s first rector, Mogens Brøndsted in 1966. Brøndsted also designed the university logo, featuring an apple tree.

<doc id="43861" wikidata="Q2166335" url="?curid=43861" title="University of Southern Denmark">
<text>The University of Southern Denmark (, SDU) has campuses located in Southern Denmark and on Zealand. It offers a number of joint programmes in co-operation with the University of Flensburg and the University of Kiel. Contacts with regional industries and the international scientific community are strong.

With its 29,674 enrolled students (as of 2016), the university is both the third-largest and, given its roots in Odense University, the third-oldest Danish university (fourth if one includes the Technical University of Denmark). Since the introduction of the ranking systems in 2012, the University of Southern Denmark has been ranked between 36th (2012 ), 38th (2013 ), 37th (2014), and 44th (2015 ) in the world by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings in the Top 100 Universities Under 50 List. It is also one of the Top 50 Universities Under 50 according to QS World University Rankings from 2012-2015.

==History==
The University of Southern Denmark was established in 1998 when Odense University, the Southern Denmark School of Business and Engineering and the South Jutland University Centre were merged. The University Library of Southern Denmark was also merged with the university in 1998. As the original Odense University was established in 1966, the University of Southern Denmark celebrated their 50-year anniversary on September 15, 2016.

In 2006, the Odense University College of Engineering was merged into the university and renamed as the Faculty of Engineering. After being located in different parts of Odense for several years, a brand new Faculty of Engineering building physically connected to the main Odense Campus was established and opened in 2015. In 2007, the Business School Centre in Slagelse (&quot;Handelshøjskolecentret Slagelse&quot;) and the National Institute of Public Health (&quot;Statens Institut for Folkesundhed&quot;) were also merged into the University of Southern Denmark.

Princess Marie took over the role of the patron of the university in 2009.

==Administration and organization==
The university is governed by a board consisting of 9 members: 5 members recruited outside the university form the majority of the board, 1 member is appointed by the scientific staff, 1 member is appointed by the administrative staff, and 2 members are appointed by the students. The rector is appointed by the university board. The rector in turn appoints deans and deans appoint heads of departments. There is no faculty senate and faculty is not involved in the appointment of rector, deans, or department heads. Hence the university has no faculty governance.

The current rector is Jens Ringsmose, and the current Pro-vice-chancellor () is Helle Waagepetersen.

==Faculties, research, and teaching==

As a national institution the University of Southern Denmark (SDU) comprises five faculties – Humanities, Science, Engineering, Social Sciences and Health Sciences totaling 32 departments, 11 research centers and a university library.
University Library of Southern Denmark is also a part of the university.

Research activities and student education make up the core activities of the university. The University of Southern Denmark also has widespread cooperation with business and industry in the region and considerable activities within continuing education. The university offers a number of degrees taught in English; examples include European Studies and American Studies.

The faculty of all six campuses comprises approximately 1,200 researchers in Odense, Kolding, Esbjerg, Sønderborg, Slagelse and Copenhagen; approximately 18,000 students are enrolled. The University of Southern Denmark offers programmes in five different faculties - Humanities, Science, Engineering, Social Sciences, and Health Sciences. It incorporates approximately 35 institutes, 30 research centres, and a well-equipped university library.

The university offers a wide range of traditional disciplines as well as a broad selection of business and engineering studies. In recent years the number of options available has been considerably expanded. Examples include the introduction of a very successful Journalism programme in Odense, Information Science in Kolding, and a Mechatronics Engineering programme in Sønderborg. The educational environments on the Jutland campuses have also been strengthened through the creation of new programmes such as a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Sociology and Cultural Analysis, a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Business Administration with Sports Management, a bachelor&#x27;s in Public Health Science in Esbjerg, Danish and English Language Studies in Kolding, and a variety of engineering programmes and European Studies in Sønderborg. Moreover, the University of Southern Denmark is the only university in Scandinavia that offers a degree programme in chiropractic studies (Clinical Biomechanics).

The university focuses on areas such as communication, information technology, and biotechnology. Other areas of research are pursued through a number of national research centres at the university. Examples include The Hans Christian Andersen Center, the Centre for Sound Communication, and the Danish Biotechnology Instrument Centre. Odense in particular focuses on research within the field of geriatrics.

Co-operation with the business community has resulted in three substantial donations from some of the giants in Danish industry: Odense is the home of the Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute for Production Technology, where robot technology is one of the many research areas. The Mads Clausen Institute in Sønderborg is engaged in the design and development of software for integration in the intelligent products of the future. Thanks to funding from Kompan and Lego, a research environment for the investigation of child behaviour and development has also been established.

The university is also hosting the Danish Institute for Advanced Study (DIAS), which brings outstanding researchers together in an interdisciplinary centre for fundamental research and intellectual inquiry. The Danish IAS exists to encourage and support curiosity-driven research in the sciences and humanities, and thereby unlock new revolutionary ideas.

==Campuses==
The University of Southern Denmark has six campuses, mainly located in the southern part of Denmark: campus Odense on the island of Funen, campus Slagelse and campus Copenhagen on the island of Zealand, as well as campus Kolding, campus Esbjerg and campus Alsion in Sønderborg, all on the Jutland peninsula.

The campus in Slagelse is officially being discontinued as of 2027, with the university citing issues finding another institution interested in taking over. 

The physical buildings of SDU cover an area of 272,554 m2 (2007), a figure that has increased from 181,450 m2 in 1999 when the university merger was implemented.

The university&#x27;s campus in Odense is considered the main campus of the University of Southern Denmark, both because of its relative size and because the central administration of the university is situated there. Being an epitome of Danish functionalist architecture, the campus has been nicknamed &quot;Rustenborg&quot; (which roughly translates as &quot;The Rusty Castle&quot;) by students and staff, because it is built from gray concrete slabs clad with weathering steel, in an early architectural use of that material. Its architecture has also given rise to other nicknames and slang expressions among students and staff. For instance, the administrative block goes by the name of &quot;Førerbunkeren&quot; (&quot;Führerbunker&quot;), referring to the architectural similarities between the university building and a stereotypical military building. The students&#x27; magazine is simply called &quot;Rust&quot;.

<doc id="43864" wikidata="Q1969483" url="?curid=43864" title="Lake-effect snow">
<text>Lake-effect snow is produced during cooler atmospheric conditions when a cold air mass moves across long expanses of warmer lake water. The lower layer of air, heated by the lake water, picks up water vapor from the lake and rises through colder air. The vapor then freezes and is deposited on the leeward (downwind) shores.

The same effect also occurs over bodies of saline water, when it is termed ocean-effect or bay-effect snow. The effect is enhanced when the moving air mass is uplifted by the orographic influence of higher elevations on the downwind shores. This uplifting can produce narrow but very intense bands of precipitation, which deposit at a rate of many inches of snow each hour, often resulting in a large amount of total snowfall.

The areas affected by lake-effect and parallel &quot;ocean-effect&quot; phenomena are called snowbelts. These include areas east of the Great Lakes in North America, the west coasts of northern Japan, Lake Baikal in Russia, and areas near the Great Salt Lake, Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, Adriatic Sea, the North Sea and more. 

Lake-effect blizzards are the blizzard-like conditions resulting from lake-effect snow. Under certain conditions, strong winds can accompany lake-effect snows creating blizzard-like conditions; however, the duration of the event is often slightly less than that required for a blizzard warning in both the U.S. and Canada.

If the air temperature is low enough to keep the precipitation frozen, it falls as lake-effect snow. If not, then it falls as lake-effect rain. For lake-effect rain or snow to form, the air moving across the lake must be significantly cooler than the surface air (which is likely to be near the temperature of the water surface). Specifically, the air temperature at an altitude where the air pressure is (roughly vertically) should be lower than the temperature of the air at the surface. Lake-effect occurring when the air at is much colder than the water surface can produce thundersnow, snow showers accompanied by lightning and thunder (caused by larger amounts of energy available from the increased instability), and, on very rare occasions, tornados. 

== Formation ==
Some key elements are required to form lake-effect precipitation and which determine its characteristics: instability, fetch, wind shear, upstream moisture, upwind lakes, synoptic (large)-scale forcing, orography/topography, and snow or ice cover.

=== Instability ===
A temperature difference of approximately between the lake temperature and the height in the atmosphere (about at which barometric pressure measures ) provides for absolute instability and allows vigorous heat and moisture transportation vertically. Atmospheric lapse rate and convective depth are directly affected by both the mesoscale lake environment and the synoptic environment; a deeper convective depth with increasingly steep lapse rates and a suitable moisture level allow for thicker, taller lake-effect precipitation clouds and naturally a much greater precipitation rate.

=== Fetch ===
The distance that an air mass travels over a body of water is called fetch. Because most lakes are irregular in shape, different angular degrees of travel yield different distances; typically, a fetch of at least is required to produce lake-effect precipitation. Generally, the larger the fetch, the more precipitation produced. Larger fetches provide the boundary layer with more time to become saturated with water vapor and for heat energy to move from the water to the air. As the air mass reaches the other side of the lake, the engine of rising and cooling water vapor pans itself out in the form of condensation and falls as snow, usually within of the lake, but sometimes up to about .

=== Wind shear ===
Directional shear is one of the most important factors governing the development of squalls; environments with weak directional shear typically produce more intense squalls than those with higher shear levels. If directional shear between the surface and the height in the atmosphere at which the barometric pressure measures is greater than 60°, nothing more than flurries can be expected. If the directional shear between the body of water and the vertical height at which the pressure measures is between 30° and 60°, weak lake-effect bands are possible. In environments where the shear is less than 30°, strong, well organized bands can be expected.

Speed shear is less critical but should be relatively uniform. The wind-speed difference between the surface and vertical height at which the pressure reads should be no greater than so as to prevent the upper portions of the band from shearing off. However, assuming the surface to winds are uniform, a faster overall velocity works to transport moisture more quickly from the water, and the band then travels much farther inland.

=== Upstream moisture ===
A lower upstream relative humidity lake effect makes condensation, clouds, and precipitation more difficult to form. The opposite is true if the upstream moisture has a high relative humidity, allowing lake-effect condensation, cloud, and precipitation to form more readily and in a greater quantity.

=== Upwind lakes ===
Any large body of water upwind impacts lake-effect precipitation to the lee of a downwind lake by adding moisture or pre-existing lake-effect bands, which can reintensify over the downwind lake. Upwind lakes do not always lead to an increase of precipitation downwind.

=== Synoptic forcing ===
Vorticity advection aloft and large upscale ascent help increase mixing and the convective depth, while cold air advection lowers the temperature and increases instability.

=== Orography and topography ===
Typically, lake-effect precipitation increases with elevation to the lee of the lake as topographic forcing squeezes out precipitation and dries out the squall much faster.

=== Snow and ice cover ===
As a lake gradually freezes over, its ability to produce lake-effect precipitation decreases for two reasons. Firstly, the open ice-free liquid surface area of the lake shrinks. This reduces fetch distances. Secondly, the water temperature nears freezing, reducing overall latent heat energy available to produce squalls. To end the production of lake-effect precipitation, a complete freeze is often not necessary.

Even when precipitation is not produced, cold air passing over warmer water may produce cloud cover. Fast-moving mid-latitude cyclones, known as Alberta clippers, often cross the Great Lakes. After the passage of a cold front, winds tend to switch to the northwest, and a frequent pattern is for a long-lasting low-pressure area to form over the Canadian Maritimes, which may pull cold northwestern air across the Great Lakes for a week or more, commonly identified with the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Since the prevailing winter winds tend to be colder than the water for much of the winter, the southeastern shores of the lakes are almost constantly overcast, leading to the use of the term &quot;the Great Gray Funk&quot; as a synonym for winter. These areas allegedly contain populations that suffer from high rates of seasonal affective disorder, a type of psychological depression thought to be caused by lack of light.

=== North America ===

==== The Great Lakes region ====

Cold winds in the winter typically prevail from the northwest in the Great Lakes region, producing the most dramatic lake-effect snowfalls on the southern and eastern shores of the Great Lakes. This lake effect results in much greater snowfall amounts on the southern and eastern shores compared to the northern and western shores of the Great Lakes.

The most affected areas include the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; Northern New York and Central New York; particularly the Tug Hill Region, Western New York; Northwestern Pennsylvania; Northeastern Ohio; southwestern Ontario and central Ontario; Northeastern Illinois (along the shoreline of Lake Michigan); northwestern and north central Indiana (mostly between Gary and Elkhart); northern Wisconsin (near Lake Superior); and West Michigan.

Lake-effect snows on the Tug Hill plateau (east of Lake Ontario) can frequently set daily records for snowfall in the United States. Tug Hill receives, typically, over of snow each winter. The snowiest portions of the Tug Hill, near the junction of the towns of Montague, Osceola, Redfield, and Worth, average over of snow annually.

From February 3–12, 2007, a lake-effect snow event left of snow in 10 days at North Redfield on the Tug Hill Plateau. Other examples major prolonged lake effect snowstorms on the Tug Hill include December 27, 2001, - January 1, 2002, when of snow fell in six days in Montague, January 10–14, 1997, when of snow fell in five days in North Redfield, and January 15–22, 1940, when over eight feet of snow fell in eight days at Barnes Corners.

Syracuse, New York, directly south of the Tug Hill Plateau, receives significant lake-effect snow from Lake Ontario, and averages of snow per year, which is enough snowfall to be considered one of the &quot;snowiest&quot; large cities in America.

Lake Erie produces a similar effect for a zone stretching from the eastern suburbs of Cleveland through Erie to Buffalo. Remnants of lake-effect snows from Lake Erie have been observed to reach as far south as Garrett County, Maryland, and as far east as Geneva, New York. Because it is not as deep as the other lakes, Erie warms rapidly in the spring and summer, and is frequently the only Great Lake to freeze over in winter. Once frozen, the resulting ice cover alleviates lake-effect snow downwind of the lake. Based on stable isotope evidence from lake sediment coupled with historical records of increasing lake-effect snow, global warming has been predicted to result in a further increase in lake-effect snow.

A very large snowbelt in the United States exists on the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, near the cities of Houghton, Marquette, and Munising. These areas typically receive of snow each season. For comparison, on the western shore, Duluth, Minnesota receives per season.

Western Michigan, western Northern Lower Michigan, and Northern Indiana can get heavy lake-effect snows as winds pass over Lake Michigan and deposit snows over Muskegon, Traverse City, Grand Rapids, Kalamazoo, New Carlisle, South Bend, and Elkhart, but these snows abate significantly before Lansing or Fort Wayne, Indiana. When winds become northerly or aligned between 330 and 390°, a single band of lake-effect snow may form, which extends down the length of Lake Michigan. This long fetch often produces a very intense, yet localized, area of heavy snowfall, affecting cities such as La Porte and Gary.

Because Southwestern Ontario is surrounded by water on three sides, many parts of Southwestern and Central Ontario get a large part of their winter snow from lake-effect snow. This region is notorious for the whiteouts that can suddenly reduce highway visibility on North America&#x27;s busiest highway (Ontario Highway 401) from clear to zero. The region most commonly affected spans from Port Stanley in the west, the Bruce Peninsula in the north, Niagara-on-the-Lake to the east, and Fort Erie to the south. The heaviest accumulations usually happen in the Bruce Peninsula, which is between Lake Huron and Georgian Bay. So long as the Great Lakes are not frozen over, the only time the Bruce Peninsula does not get lake-effect snow is when the wind is directly from the south.

==== Elsewhere in the United States ====
The southern and southeastern sides of the Great Salt Lake receive significant lake-effect snow. Since the Great Salt Lake never freezes, the lake effect can influence the weather along the Wasatch Front year-round. The lake effect largely contributes to the annual snowfall amounts recorded south and east of the lake, and in average snowfall reaching in the Wasatch Range. The snow, which is often very light and dry because of the semiarid climate, is referred to as the &quot;Greatest Snow on Earth&quot; in the mountains. Lake-effect snow contributes to roughly six to eight snowfalls per year in Salt Lake City, with about 10% of the city&#x27;s precipitation being contributed by the phenomenon.

On one occasion in December 2016, lake-effect snow fell in central Mississippi from a lake band off Ross Barnett Reservoir.

The West Coast occasionally experiences ocean-effect showers, usually in the form of rain at lower elevations south of about the mouth of the Columbia River. These occur whenever an Arctic air mass from western Canada is drawn westward out over the Pacific Ocean, typically by way of the Fraser Valley, returning shoreward around a center of low pressure. Cold air flowing southwest from the Fraser Valley can also pick up moisture over the Strait of Georgia and Strait of Juan de Fuca, then rise over the northeastern slopes of the Olympic Mountains, producing heavy, localized snow between Port Angeles and Sequim, as well as areas in Kitsap County and the Puget Sound region.

While snow of any type is very rare in Florida, the phenomenon of gulf-effect snow has been observed along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico a few times in history. More recently, &quot;ocean-effect&quot; snow occurred on January 24, 2003, when wind off the Atlantic, combined with air temperatures in the 30 °F range, brought snow flurries briefly to the Atlantic Coast of northern Florida seen in the air as far south as Cape Canaveral.

=== Eurasia ===

==== Istanbul and northern Turkey ====

Because the southern Black Sea is relatively warm (around 13 °C or 55 °F at the beginning of winter, typically 10 to 6 °C or 50 to 43 °F by the end), sufficiently cold air aloft can create significant snowfalls in a relatively short period of time. Furthermore, cold air, when it arrives to the region, tends to move slowly, creating days and sometimes weeks of occasional lake-effect snowfall. 

The most populous city in the region, Istanbul, is very prone to lake-effect snow and this weather phenomenon occurs almost every winter, despite winter averages of , comparable to Paris. On multiple occasions, lake-effect snowfall events have lasted for more than a week, and official single-storm snow depth totals have exceeded downtown and around the city. Earlier, unofficial measurements are often higher, due to the relative dearth of sufficiently old weather stations in the region; some sources claim up to of snowfall during the blizzard of March 1987. 

Meanwhile, snowfall in mountainous provinces in this region is amplified by orographic effect, often resulting in snowfall of several meters, especially at higher elevations.

==== Around the Baltic Sea ====
In Northern Europe, cold, dry air masses from Russia can blow over the Baltic Sea and cause heavy snow squalls on areas of the southern and eastern coasts of Sweden, as well as on the Danish island of Bornholm, the east coast of Jutland and the northern coast of Poland. For the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, this happens mainly in the early winter, since it freezes later. Southeast Norway can also experience heavy sea snow events with east-north-easterly winds. Especially, coastal areas from Kragerø to Kristiansand have had incredible snow depths in the past with intense persistent snowbands from Skagerak (the coastal city of Arendal recorded in a single week in late February 2007). Although Fennoscandia is lined with an abundance of lakes, this type of snowfall is rare in these, due to the shallow freshwater freezing early in the cold interiors. One notable exception happened in the middle of May 2008, as Leksand on the since-long unfrozen lake of Siljan got on the ground.

==== East Asia ====
The Sea of Japan creates snowfall in the mountainous western Japanese prefectures of Niigata and Nagano, parts of which are known collectively as snow country (&quot;Yukiguni&quot;). In addition to Japan, much of maritime Korea and the Shandong Peninsula experience these conditions.

==== Siberia ====
Strong winds and a very large, deep lake enhance snowfall around Lake Baikal in the fall; however, nearly the entire surface of the lake freezes from January until Spring, precluding lake-effect snow.

==== Iran ====
Moving of polar or Siberian high-pressure centers along Caspian Sea regarding to relatively warmer water of this sea can make heavy snowfalls in the northern coast of Iran. Several blizzards have been reported in this region during the last decades. In February 2014, heavy snowfall reached on the coastline in Gilan and Mazandaran provinces of Iran. The heaviest snowfall was reported in Abkenar village near Anzali Lagoon.

==== United Kingdom ====
In the United Kingdom, easterly winds bringing cold continental air across the North Sea can lead to a similar phenomenon. Locally, it is also known as &quot;lake-effect snow&quot; despite the snow coming in from the sea rather than a lake. Similarly during a north-westerly wind, snow showers can form coming in from the Liverpool Bay, coming down the Cheshire gap, causing snowfall in the West Midlands—this formation resulted in the white Christmas of 2004 in the area, and most recently the heavy snowfall of 8 December 2017 and 30 January 2019.

The best-known example occurred in January 1987, when record-breaking cold air (associated with an upper low) moved across the North Sea towards the UK. The result was over 2 ft of snow for coastal areas, leading to communities being cut off for over a week. The latest of these events to affect Britain&#x27;s east coast occurred on November 30, 2017; February 28, 2018; and March 17, 2018; in connection with the 2018 Great Britain and Ireland cold wave. The second event of winter 2017/18 was particularly severe, with up to falling in total over the 27th–28th.

Similarly, northerly winds blowing across the relatively warm waters of the English Channel during cold spells can bring significant snowfall to the French region of Normandy, where snow drifts exceeding 10 ft (3 m) were measured in March 2013.

<text>A choir ( ), also known as a chorale or chorus (from Latin &quot;chorus&quot;, meaning &#x27;a dance in a circle&#x27;) is a musical ensemble of singers. Choral music, in turn, is the music written specifically for such an ensemble to perform or in other words is the music performed by the ensemble. Choirs may perform music from the classical music repertoire, which spans from the medieval era to the present, or popular music repertoire. Most choirs are led by a conductor, who leads the performances with arm, hand, and facial gestures.

The term &quot;choir&quot; is very often applied to groups affiliated with a church (whether or not they actually occupy the quire), whereas a &quot;chorus&quot; performs in theatres or concert halls, but this distinction is not rigid. Choirs may sing without instruments, or accompanied by a piano, accordion, pipe organ, a small ensemble, or an orchestra.

A choir can be a subset of an ensemble; thus one speaks of the &quot;woodwind choir&quot; of an orchestra, or different &quot;choirs&quot; of voices or instruments in a polychoral composition. In typical 18th century to 21st century oratorios and masses, &#x27;chorus&#x27; or &#x27;choir&#x27; implies that there is more than one singer per part, in contrast to the quartet of soloists also featured in these works.

==Structure==
Choirs are often led by a conductor, choirmaster or choir director. Most often, choirs consist of four sections intended to sing in four-part harmony, but there is no limit to the number of possible parts as long as there is a singer available to sing the part. For instance, Thomas Tallis wrote a 40-part motet entitled &quot;Spem in alium&quot;, for eight choirs of five parts each; while Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Stabat Mater&quot; is for three choirs of 16 voices each, a total of 48 parts. Other than four, the most common number of parts are three, five, six, and eight.

Choirs can sing with or without instrumental accompaniment. Singing without accompaniment is usually called a cappella singing (although the American Choral Directors Association discourages this usage in favor of &quot;unaccompanied&quot;, since a cappella denotes singing &quot;as in the chapel&quot; and much unaccompanied music today is secular). Accompanying instruments vary widely, from only one instrument (a piano or pipe organ) to a full orchestra of 70 to 100 musicians; for rehearsals a piano or organ accompaniment is often used, even if a different instrumentation is planned for performance, or if the choir is rehearsing unaccompanied music. With the new prevalence of electronic devices, small groups can use these together with learning tracks for both group rehearsals and private practice. 

Many choirs perform in one or many locations such as a church, opera house, school or village hall. In some cases, choirs join up to become one &quot;mass&quot; choir that performs for a special concert. In this case, they provide a series of songs or musical works to celebrate and provide entertainment to others.

===Role of conductor===
Conducting is the art of directing a musical performance, such as a choral concert, by way of visible gestures with the hands, arms, face and head. The primary duties of the conductor or choirmaster are to unify performers, set the tempo, execute clear preparations and beats (meter), and to listen critically and shape the sound of the ensemble.

In most choirs, the same individual acts as the musical director (responsible for deciding the repertoire and engaging soloists and accompanists), chorusmaster (or répétiteur) (responsible for training and rehearsing the singers), and conductor (responsible for directing the performance). However, these roles may be divided, especially when the choir is combined with other forces, for example in opera.

The conductor or choral director typically stands on a raised platform, and may or may not use a baton; using a baton gives the conductor&#x27;s gestures greater visibility, but many choral conductors prefer conducting with their hands for greater expressiveness, particularly when working with a smaller ensemble. In the 2010s, most conductors do not play an instrument when conducting, although in earlier periods of classical music history, leading an ensemble while playing an instrument was common. In Baroque music from the 1600s to the 1750s, conductors performing in the 2010s may lead an ensemble while playing a harpsichord or the violin (see Concertmaster). Conducting while playing a piano may also be done with musical theatre pit orchestras. Communication is typically non-verbal during a performance (this is strictly the case in art music, but in jazz big bands or large pop ensembles, there may be occasional spoken instructions). However, in rehearsals, the conductor will often give verbal instructions to the ensemble, since the conductor generally also serves as an artistic director who crafts the ensemble&#x27;s interpretation of the music.

Conductors act as guides to the choirs they conduct. They choose the works to be performed and study their scores, to which they may make certain adjustments (e.g., regarding tempo, repetitions of sections, assignment of vocal solos, etc.), work out their interpretation, and relay their vision to the singers. Choral conductors may also have to conduct instrumental ensembles such as orchestras if the choir is singing a piece for choir and orchestra. They may also attend to organizational matters, such as scheduling rehearsals, planning a concert season, hearing auditions, and promoting their ensemble in the media.

== In worship services ==

Historically, the sung repertoire divides into sacred or religious music and secular music. While much religious music has been written with concert performance in mind, its origin lies in its role within the context of liturgy.

===Accompaniment===
Most Eastern Orthodox Christian churches, some American Protestant groups, and traditional Jewish synagogues do not accompany their songs with musical instruments. In churches of the Western Rite the accompanying instrument is usually the organ, although in colonial America, the Moravian Church used groups of strings and winds. Many churches which use a contemporary worship format use a small amplified band to accompany the singing, and Roman Catholic Churches may use, at their discretion, additional orchestral accompaniment.

===Liturgical function===

In addition to leading of singing in which the participates, such as hymns and service music, some church choirs sing full liturgies, including propers (introit, gradual, communion antiphons appropriate for the different times of the liturgical year). Chief among these are the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches; far more common however is the performance of anthems or motets at designated times in the service.

== Types==

One of the main classifications of choirs is by gender and age since these factors have traditionally been thought to affect how a choir sounds and what music it performs. The types are listed here in approximate descending order of prevalence at the professional and advanced amateur or semi-professional levels.

* Adult mixed choir (with male and female voices) is perhaps the most common and dominant type, usually consisting of soprano, alto, tenor, and bass voices, often abbreviated as SATB. Often one or more voices is divided into two, e.g., SSAATTBB, where each voice is divided into two parts, and SATBSATB, where the choir is divided into two semi-independent four-part choirs. Occasionally baritone voice is also used (e.g., SATBarB), often sung by the higher basses. In smaller choirs with fewer men, SAB, or soprano, alto, and baritone arrangements allow the few men to share the role of both the tenor and bass in a single part and altos may also sing the tenor part.
* Male choir (or choir of men &amp; boys) with the same SATB voicing as a mixed choir, but with boys singing the upper part (often called trebles or boy sopranos) and men singing alto (in falsetto), also known as countertenors. This format was until recently typical of the British cathedral choir (e.g. King&#x27;s College, St Paul&#x27;s, Westminster Abbey). However, all cathedrals now accept females and by 2019 female choristers outnumbered males in English cathedral choirs. 
* Men&#x27;s chorus (Male voice choir, Männerchor), a choir of adult men, low voices only, usually consisting of two tenors, baritone, and bass, often abbreviated as TTBB (or ATBB if the upper part sings falsetto in alto range). ATBB may be seen in some barbershop quartet music.
* Boys&#x27; choir, a choir of boys, typically singing SSA or SSAA, sometimes including a cambiata/tenor part for boys/young men whose voices are changing and a baritone part for boys/young men whose voices have changed.
* Women&#x27;s choir, a choir of adult women, high voices only, usually consisting of soprano and alto voices, two parts in each, often abbreviated as SSAA, or as soprano I, soprano II, and alto, abbreviated SSA. If all singers are young, the term &quot;girls&#x27; choir&quot; is used instead.
* Children&#x27;s mixed choir (with male and female voices), often two-part SA or three-part SSA, sometimes more voices.

The all-female and mixed children&#x27;s choirs tend to be professionally less prevalent than the high voiced boys&#x27; choirs, the lower voiced men&#x27;s choruses, or the full SATB choirs. This is due to some extent to lack of scholarships and other types of funding, and a lack of professional opportunities for women such as that of being lay clerks or musical directors. 

Choirs are also categorized by the institutions in which they operate:
* Church (including cathedral) choirs
* Chorale (Kantorei), dedicated to mostly sacred Christian music
* Collegiate and university choir
* Community choir (of children or adults)
* Professional choir, either independent (e.g. Anúna, the Sixteen, the Archipelago Singers) or state-supported (e.g., BBC Singers, Chamber Choir Ireland, Canadian Chamber Choir, Swedish Radio Choir, Nederlands Kamerkoor, Latvian Radio Choir)
* School choirs
* Signing choir using sign language rather than voices
* Integrated signing and singing choir, using both sign language and voices and led by both a signductor and a musical director
* Cambiata choirs, for adolescent boys whose voices are changing.
* Virtual choirs, for members who do not meet physically, some having originated during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Some choirs are categorized by the type of music they perform, such as
* Bach choir
* Barbershop music group
* Gospel choir
* Show choir, in which the members sing and dance, often in performances somewhat like musicals
* Symphonic choir
* Vocal jazz choir

=== In schools ===
In the United States, middle schools and high schools often offer choir as a class or activity. Some choirs participate in competitions. One kind of choir popular in high schools is show choir. During middle school and high school students&#x27; voices are changing. Although girls experience voice change, it is much more significant in boys. A lot of literature in music education has been focused on how male voice change works and how to help adolescent male singers. Research done by John Cooksey categorizes male voice change into five stages, and most middle school boys are in the early stages of change. The vocal range of male and female students may be limited while their voice is changing, and choir teachers must be able to adapt, which can be a challenge to teaching this age range.

Nationally, male students are enrolled in choir at much lower numbers than their female students. The music education field has had a longtime interest in the &quot;missing males&quot; in music programs. Speculation as to why there are not as many boys in choir, and possible solutions vary widely. One researcher found that boys who enjoy choir in middle school may not always go on to high school choir because it simply does not fit into their schedules. Some research speculates that one reason that boys&#x27; participation in choir is so low is because the U.S. does not encourage male singers. Often, schools will have a women&#x27;s choir, which helps the balance issues mixed choirs face by taking on extra female singers. However, without a men&#x27;s choir also, this can make the problem worse by not giving boys as many opportunities to sing as girls. Other researchers have noted that having an ensemble, or a workshop dedicated to male singers, can help with their confidence and singing abilities. British cathedral choirs are usually made from pupils enrolled in schools.

== Arrangements on stage ==
There are various schools of thought regarding how the various sections should be arranged on stage. It is the conductor&#x27;s decision on where the different voice types are placed. In symphonic choirs it is common (though by no means universal) to order the choir behind the orchestra from highest to lowest voices from left to right, corresponding to the typical string layout. In &quot;a cappella&quot; or piano-accompanied situations it is not unusual for the men to be in the back and the women in front; some conductors prefer to place the basses behind the sopranos, arguing that the outer voices need to tune to each other.

More experienced choirs may sing with the voices all mixed. Sometimes singers of the same voice are grouped in pairs or threes. Proponents of this method argue that it makes it easier for each individual singer to hear and tune to the other parts, but it requires more independence from each singer. Opponents argue that this method loses the spatial separation of individual voice lines, an otherwise valuable feature for the audience, and that it eliminates sectional resonance, which lessens the effective volume of the chorus. For music with double (or multiple) choirs, usually the members of each choir are together, sometimes significantly separated, especially in performances of 16th-century music (such as works in the Venetian polychoral style). Some composers actually specify that choirs should be separated, such as in Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot;. Some composers use separated choirs to create &quot;antiphonal&quot; effects, in which one choir seems to &quot;answer&quot; the other choir in a musical dialogue.

Consideration is also given to the spacing of the singers. Studies have found that not only the actual formation, but the amount of space (both laterally and circumambiently) affects the perception of sound by choristers and auditors.

== History ==

===Antiquity===


The origins of choral music are found in traditional music, as singing in big groups is extremely widely spread in traditional cultures (both singing in one part, or in unison, like in Ancient Greece, as well as singing in parts, or in harmony, like in contemporary European choral music).

The oldest unambiguously choral repertory that survives is that of ancient Greece, of which the 2nd century BC Delphic hymns and the 2nd century AD. hymns of Mesomedes are the most complete. The original Greek chorus sang its part in Greek drama, and fragments of works by Euripides (&quot;Orestes&quot;) and Sophocles (&quot;Ajax&quot;) are known from papyri. The Seikilos epitaph (2c BC) is a complete song (although possibly for solo voice). One of the latest examples, &quot;Oxyrhynchus hymn&quot; (3c) is also of interest as the earliest Christian music.

Of the Roman drama&#x27;s music a single line of Terence surfaced in the 18th century. However, musicologist Thomas J. Mathiesen comments that it is no longer believed to be authentic.

===Medieval music===

The earliest notated music of western Europe is Gregorian chant, along with a few other types of chant which were later subsumed (or sometimes suppressed) by the Catholic Church. This tradition of unison choir singing lasted from sometime between the times of St. Ambrose (4th century) and Gregory the Great (6th century) up to the present. During the later Middle Ages, a new type of singing involving multiple melodic parts, called organum, became predominant for certain functions, but initially this polyphony was only sung by soloists. Further developments of this technique included clausulae, conductus and the motet (most notably the isorhythmic motet), which, unlike the Renaissance motet, describes a composition with different texts sung simultaneously in different voices. The first evidence of polyphony with more than one singer per part comes in the Old Hall Manuscript (1420, though containing music from the late 14th century), in which there are apparent &quot;divisi&quot;, one part dividing into two simultaneously sounding notes.

===Renaissance music===
During the Renaissance, sacred choral music was the principal type of formally notated music in Western Europe. Throughout the era, hundreds of masses and motets (as well as various other forms) were composed for a cappella choir, though there is some dispute over the role of instruments during certain periods and in certain areas. Some of the better-known composers of this time include Guillaume Dufay, Josquin des Prez, Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, John Dunstable, and William Byrd; the glories of Renaissance polyphony were choral, sung by choirs of great skill and distinction all over Europe. Choral music from this period continues to be popular with many choirs throughout the world today.

The madrigal, a partsong conceived for amateurs to sing in a chamber setting, originated at this period. Although madrigals were initially dramatic settings of unrequited-love poetry or mythological stories in Italy, they were imported into England and merged with the more dancelike balletto, celebrating carefree songs of the seasons, or eating and drinking. To most English speakers, the word &quot;madrigal&quot; now refers to the latter, rather than to madrigals proper, which refers to a poetic form of lines consisting of seven and eleven syllables each.

The interaction of sung voices in Renaissance polyphony influenced Western music for centuries. Composers are routinely trained in the &quot;Palestrina style&quot; to this day, especially as codified by the 18th century music theorist Johann Joseph Fux. Composers of the early 20th century also wrote in Renaissance-inspired styles. Herbert Howells wrote a &quot;Mass in the Dorian mode&quot; entirely in strict Renaissance style, and Ralph Vaughan Williams&#x27;s Mass in G minor is an extension of this style. Anton Webern wrote his dissertation on the &quot;Choralis Constantinus&quot; of Heinrich Isaac and the contrapuntal techniques of his serial music may be informed by this study.

===Baroque music===

The Baroque period in music is associated with the development around 1600 of the &quot;figured bass&quot; and the basso continuo system. The figured bass part was performed by the basso continuo group, which at minimum included a chord-playing instrument (e.g., pipe organ, harpsichord, lute) and a bass instrument (e.g., violone). Baroque vocal music explored dramatic implications in the realm of solo vocal music such as the monodies of the Florentine Camerata and the development of early opera. This innovation was in fact an extension of established practice of accompanying choral music at the organ, either from a skeletal reduced score (from which otherwise lost pieces can sometimes be reconstructed) or from a &quot;basso seguente&quot;, a part on a single staff containing the lowest sounding part (the bass part).

A new genre was the vocal concertato, combining voices and instruments; its origins may be sought in the polychoral music of the Venetian school.
Claudio Monteverdi (1567–1643) brought it to perfection with his Vespers and his Eighth Book of Madrigals, which call for great virtuosity on the part of singers and instruments alike. (His Fifth Book includes a &quot;basso continuo&quot; &quot;for harpsichord or lute&quot;.) His pupil Heinrich Schütz (1585–1672) (who had earlier studied with Giovanni Gabrieli) introduced the new style to Germany. Alongside the new music of the &quot;seconda pratica&quot;, contrapuntal motets in the &quot;stile antico&quot; or old style continued to be written well into the 19th century. Choirs at this time were usually quite small and that singers could be classified as suited to church or to chamber singing. Monteverdi, himself a singer, is documented as taking part in performances of his Magnificat with one voice per part.

Independent instrumental accompaniment opened up new possibilities for choral music. Verse anthems alternated accompanied solos with choral sections; the best-known composers of this genre were Orlando Gibbons and Henry Purcell. Grands motets (such as those of Lully and Delalande) separated these sections into separate movements. Oratorios (of which Giacomo Carissimi was a pioneer) extended this concept into concert-length works, usually based on Biblical or moral stories.
A pinnacle of baroque choral music, (particularly oratorio), may be found in George Frideric Handel&#x27;s works, notably &quot;Messiah&quot; and &quot;Israel in Egypt&quot;. While the modern chorus of hundreds had to await the growth of Choral Societies and his centennial commemoration concert, we find Handel already using a variety of performing forces, from the soloists of the &quot;Chandos Anthems&quot; to larger groups (whose proportions are still quite different from modern orchestra choruses):

Lutheran composers wrote instrumentally accompanied cantatas, often based on chorale tunes. Substantial late 17th-century sacred choral works in the emerging German tradition exist (the cantatas of Dietrich Buxtehude being a prime example), though the Lutheran church cantata did not assume its more codified, recognizable form until the early 18th century. Georg Philipp Telemann (based in Frankfurt) wrote over 1000 cantatas, many of which were engraved and published (e.g. his &quot;Harmonische Gottesdienst&quot;) and Christoph Graupner (based in Darmstadt) over 1400. The cantatas of Johann Sebastian Bach (1685–1750) are perhaps the most recognizable (and often-performed) contribution to this repertoire: his obituary mentions five complete cycles of his cantatas, of which three, comprising some 200 works, are known today, in addition to motets. Bach himself rarely used the term cantata. Motet refers to his church music without orchestra accompaniment, but instruments playing colla parte with the voices. His works with accompaniment consists of his Passions, Masses, the Magnificat and the cantatas.

A point of hot controversy today is the so-called &quot;Rifkin hypothesis,&quot; which re-examines the famous &quot;Entwurff&quot; Bach&#x27;s 1730 memo to the Leipzig City Council (&quot;A Short but Most Necessary Draft for a Well Appointed Church Music&quot;) calling for at least 12 singers. In light of Bach&#x27;s responsibility to provide music to four churches and be able to perform double choir compositions with a substitute for each voice, Joshua Rifkin concludes that Bach&#x27;s music was normally written with one voice per part in mind. A few sets of original performing parts include &quot;ripieni&quot; who reinforce rather than slavishly double the vocal quartet.

===Classical and Romantic music===

Composers of the late 18th century became fascinated with the new possibilities of the symphony and other instrumental music, and generally neglected choral music. Mozart&#x27;s mostly sacred choral works stand out as some of his greatest (such as the &quot;Great&quot; Mass in C minor and Requiem in D minor, the latter of which is highly regarded). Haydn became more interested in choral music near the end of his life following his visits to England in the 1790s, when he heard various Handel oratorios performed by large forces; he wrote a series of masses beginning in 1797 and his two great oratorios &quot;The Creation&quot; and &quot;The Seasons&quot;. Beethoven wrote only two masses, both intended for liturgical use, although his &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; is probably suitable only for the grandest ceremonies due to its length, difficulty and large-scale scoring. He also pioneered the use of chorus as part of symphonic texture with his Ninth Symphony and Choral Fantasia.
In the 19th century, sacred music escaped from the church and leaped onto the concert stage, with large sacred works unsuitable for church use, such as Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Te Deum&quot; and Requiem, and Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Ein deutsches Requiem&quot;. Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Stabat mater&quot;, Schubert&#x27;s masses, and Verdi&#x27;s Requiem also exploited the grandeur offered by instrumental accompaniment. Oratorios also continued to be written, clearly influenced by Handel&#x27;s models. Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;enfance du Christ&quot; and Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; and &quot;St Paul&quot; are in the category. Schubert, Mendelssohn, and Brahms also wrote secular cantatas, the best known of which are Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Schicksalslied&quot; and &quot;Nänie&quot;.

A few composers developed a cappella music, especially Bruckner, whose masses and motets startlingly juxtapose Renaissance counterpoint with chromatic harmony. Mendelssohn and Brahms also wrote significant a cappella motets. The amateur chorus (beginning chiefly as a social outlet) began to receive serious consideration as a compositional venue for the part-songs of Schubert, Schumann, Mendelssohn, Brahms, and others. These &#x27;singing clubs&#x27; were often for women or men separately, and the music was typically in four-part (hence the name &quot;part-song&quot;) and either a cappella or with simple instrumentation. At the same time, the Cecilian movement attempted a restoration of the pure Renaissance style in Catholic churches.

===20th and 21st centuries===
In the United States, development of mixed choirs was pioneered by groups such as The St. Olaf Choir and Westminster Choir College. These groups were characterized by arrangements of hymns and other sacred works of christian nature which helped define the choral sound of the United States for most of the 20th century. Secular choral music in the United States was popularized by groups such as the Dale Warland Singers throughout the late 20th century.

The Big Choral Census online survey was established to find out how many choirs there were in the UK, of what type, with how many members, singing what type of music and with what sort of funding. Results estimated that there were some 40,000 choral groups operating in the UK and over 2 million people singing regularly in a choir. Over 30 percent of the groups listed described themselves a community choirs, half of the choirs listed sing contemporary music although singing classical music is still popular. Most choirs are self funding. It is thought that the increase in popularity of singing together in groups has been fed to some extent in the UK by TV progammes such as Gareth Malone&#x27;s &#x27;The Choir&#x27;. In 2017, the Purwa Caraka Music Studio Choir of Indonesia began the trend when they covered children&#x27;s songs in a choral arrangement for the film &quot;Surat Kecil untuk Tuhan&quot;.

Apart from their roles in liturgy and entertainment, choirs and choruses may also have social-service functions, including for mental health treatment or as therapy for homeless and disadvantaged people, like the Choir of Hard Knocks or for special groups such as Military Wives.

<text>Johanna Schopenhauer (née Trosiener; 9 July 1766 – 17 April 1838) was the first German woman to publish books without a pseudonym, an influential literary salon host, and in the 1820s a popular author in Germany. She was also the mother of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.

== Biography ==

Johanna Schopenhauer was born in Danzig (&quot;Gdańsk&quot;), in the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, to a family of middle-class merchants. Her parents were (1730–1797) and Elisabeth Trosiener, nee Lehmann (1745–1818). Her father was also a councillor in the city. She was the eldest child in the family, and had three younger sisters, Charlotte Elizabeth (1768–1828), who married Felix Ratzky, Anna (1769–1814) and Juliane Dorothea (1773–1849). She was a precocious girl, sensitive to art and with great talent for learning foreign languages. Before turning 10, she already knew Polish, French, and English apart from her native German. As a youth, she aspired to become a painter, a desire her parents however nipped right in the bud, considering it improper that a girl of her class exercised &quot;a trade.&quot;

In 1784, at age 18, she married (1747–1805), a much wealthier merchant twenty years her senior. He was to become the father of her two children, Arthur and Adele, who were born in 1788 and 1797, respectively. In her autobiography, in which Johanna promised to tell the facts of her life &quot;without poetry&quot;, Johanna made clear that she &quot;no more pretended ardent love to him than he demanded it&quot;. She denied, however, that she came under pressure from her parents to marry Heinrich Floris. On the contrary, she subtly admitted that what attracted her to a union with him was his social rank and the possibilities that his wealth could open to her. The marriage was stable, but from the beginning Johanna felt that her happiness and that of her husband depended on her resignation to his will.

In 1793, the family moved to Hamburg when Danzig became part of Prussia as part of the Second Partition of Poland. In 1805, a year after her husband&#x27;s death, Johanna and her daughter moved to Weimar, a town where Johanna had neither relatives nor close friends and which was, moreover, about to be the stage of war between Prussia and the invading troops of Napoleon. Though Johanna did not know of the imminent risk of war, she refused to leave the city when the situation became clear, as transportation was only available to her and her daughter, and her servants would have to be left to their own fate.

During the war, Johanna was active in providing services to those in need, nursing German soldiers and giving asylum to less fortunate citizens, whose houses had been taken over by French soldiers. With that, she quickly became a popular figure in Weimar.

After the war, she gained a high reputation as a &quot;salonnière&quot; (as she had planned before she left Hamburg), and for years to come her semiweekly parties were attended by several literary celebrities: Christoph Martin Wieland, the Schlegel brothers August and Friedrich, Ludwig Tieck, and, above all, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, whose awareness was probably what attracted Johanna to Weimar in the first place. Goethe&#x27;s endorsement was a big factor behind Johanna&#x27;s social success, and what greatly contributed to their friendship was the fact that Johanna was the first upper-class woman in Weimar to open the doors of her house to Christiane Vulpius, Goethe&#x27;s mistress, who had hitherto been excluded from the shining social scene of the city owing not only to her lowly background, but also to the fact that Goethe and Vulpius were no more than lovers, despite living together.

At first, Arthur Schopenhauer chose to stay in Hamburg. At that moment he had every intention to fulfil a promise made to his father, that of concluding his merchant apprenticeship, however much that pained him and however much he would have preferred to study philosophy. Johanna encouraged her son to leave these studies behind and follow his desire to become a scholar.

Mother and son, however, did not get along. In letters written to Schopenhauer, Johanna makes it very clear how distressed she was at her son&#x27;s pessimism, his arrogance, and his imperious ways. In one letter, she wrote: &quot;You are unbearable and burdensome, and very hard to live with; all your good qualities are overshadowed by your conceit, and made useless to the world simply because you cannot restrain your propensity to pick holes in other people.&quot; (She destroyed his letters to her.) When, in 1809, Schopenhauer finally moved to Weimar, he established himself, not in his mother&#x27;s house, but in that of his young instructor, Franz Passow, as it was the mother&#x27;s impression that living under the same roof as her son was a bad idea. In 1813, she finally allowed him to move into her house, renting him a room, but the arrangement was soon broken after frequent arguments, motivated by Johanna&#x27;s friendship with another lodger, a younger man called Georg von Gerstenbergk.

After 1814, mother and son never met again. All the communication between the two was from then on through letters, but even this was interrupted after Johanna read a correspondence from Schopenhauer to his sister Adele, where he blamed their mother for the death of their father, understood to have been by suicide, accusing her of going to amuse herself at parties while Heinrich Floris was bedridden, sick and abandoned to the care of a loyal employee. In 1819, however, Schopenhauer made an attempt to approach his family. That year, the Schopenhauer ladies lost most of their fortune in a banking crisis. Schopenhauer volunteered to share with them the inheritance he received from his father, but Johanna refused the offer.

It was only in 1831 that the correspondence between mother and son resumed. It was Arthur who took the first step, motivated, apparently, by his many difficulties: from the failure to sell his books to his bodily ailments. The correspondence continued sporadically until Johanna&#x27;s death in 1838. Despite the cordial tone of the last communications between Johanna and Arthur, the latter continued to speak ill of her even after her death, making little of Johanna&#x27;s mother skills and painting her as a thoroughly self-centered woman. For her part, in her will Johanna made Adele her sole heir. But this was probably intended not so much to slight her son as in recognition that her daughter would be in greater difficulties in future years, since Arthur not only managed to conserve his part of the fatherly inheritance but even doubled it, whereas Adele would have few resources at her disposal.

In Weimar, Johanna Schopenhauer made a name as an author. She was the first German woman to publish books without a pseudonym, and from the late 1810s to the early 1830s, her works turned her into the most famous woman author in Germany. In 1831, her books received a second edition, and the collection filled no less than 24 volumes. Despite all this production, her critical acclaim and commercial success, Johanna was never able to make up for the financial losses of the 1810s. Unable to maintain their lifestyle in Weimar, and also for health reasons, Johanna and Adele moved to Bonn. In the mid-1830s, Johanna&#x27;s fame declined and their financial situation worsened. Almost without resources, Johanna wrote to the Duke of Weimar detailing her plight. In 1837, the Duke, in recognition of Johanna&#x27;s fame and contribution to the city&#x27;s culture, offered her a small pension and invited her to move to Jena. Johanna died there the following year. She left incomplete the manuscript of her last work, her autobiography, which narrates her early life until shortly after Arthur&#x27;s birth.

== Work ==

Not long after her arrival in Weimar, Schopenhauer began to publish her writings, consisting of articles on paintings with special attention on Jan van Eyck&#x27;s work. These were later published in two volumes in 1822. 

In 1810, she published her first book: a biography of her friend Karl Ludwig Fernow, who had died two years before. She wrote the book with the generous intention to pay Fernow&#x27;s heirs&#x27; debts with his editor. The work met with critical success, which encouraged Johanna to pursue a career as an author, on which her livelihood and that of Adele would depend after the aforementioned financial crisis. 

First came the publication of her travelogues. Prior to Heinrich Floris&#x27; death, the family made trips through Western Europe, mostly in order to help Arthur, then a teenager, develop the skills of a merchant. But the trips were also of great use to Johanna, serving as raw material for her travelogues, which were very successful at the time they were published, decades later. In 1990, her travelogue to England and Scotland was translated into English by Chapman &amp; Hall — Johanna&#x27;s only book to be introduced to the Anglophone world since the turn to the 20th century. Then came her fiction work, which, for a little more than a decade, turned her into the most famous woman author in Germany. The following are her best known novels: &quot;Gabriele&quot; (1819), &quot;Die Tante&quot; (1823) and &quot;Sidonia&quot; (1827).

<doc id="43871" wikidata="Q862872" url="?curid=43871" title="Fatal insomnia">
<text>Fatal insomnia is an extremely rare neurodegenerative prion disease that results in trouble sleeping as its hallmark symptom. The majority of cases are familial (fatal familial insomnia [FFI]), stemming from a mutation in the &quot;PRNP&quot; gene, with the remainder of cases occurring sporadically (sporadic fatal insomnia [sFI]). The problems with sleeping typically start out gradually and worsen over time. Eventually, the patient will succumb to total insomnia (&quot;agrypnia excitata&quot;), most often leading to other symptoms such as speech problems, coordination problems, and dementia. It results in death within a few months to a few years, and there is no known disease-modifying treatment.
==Signs and symptoms==
The disease has four stages:

# Characterized by worsening insomnia, resulting in panic attacks, paranoia, and phobias. This stage lasts for about four months.
# Hallucinations and panic attacks become noticeable, continuing for about five months.
# Complete inability to sleep is followed by rapid loss of weight. This lasts for about three months.
# Dementia, during which the person becomes unresponsive or mute over the course of six months, is the final stage of the disease, after which death follows.
Clinically, FFI manifests with a disordered sleep-wake cycle, dysautonomia, motor disturbances, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Other symptoms include profuse sweating, miosis (pinpoint pupils), sudden entrance into menopause or impotence, neck stiffness, and elevation of blood pressure and heart rate. The sporadic form of the disease often presents with double vision. Prolonged constipation is common as well. As the disease progresses, the person becomes stuck in a state of pre-sleep limbo, or hypnagogia, which is the state just before sleep in healthy individuals. During these stages, people commonly and repeatedly move their limbs as if they were dreaming.

The age of onset is variable, ranging from 13 to 60 years, with an average of 50. The disease can be detected prior to onset by genetic testing. Death usually occurs between 6–36 months from onset. The presentation of the disease varies considerably from person to person, even among people within the same family; in the sporadic form, for example, sleep problems are not commonly reported and early symptoms are ataxia, cognitive impairment, and double vision.

==Cause==
Fatal familial insomnia is a rare hereditary prion disease that is associated with a mutation in &quot;PRNP&quot;. The gene, which provides instructions for making the prion protein PrPC, is located on the short arm of chromosome 20 at position p13. Individuals with FFI or familial Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (fCJD) both carry a mutation at codon 178 of the prion protein gene. FFI is also invariably linked to the presence of the methionine codon at position 129 of the mutant allele, whereas fCJD is linked to the presence of the valine codon at that position. The disease occurs when there is a change of amino acid at position 178 in which asparagine is found instead of the normal aspartic acid. This has to be accompanied with a methionine at position 129.

FFI is an autosomal dominant disease caused by a missense GAC-to-AAC mutation at codon 178 of the &quot;PRNP&quot; prion protein gene located on chromosome 20, along with the presence of the methionine polymorphism at position 129 of the mutant allele. Pathologically, FFI is characterized predominantly by thalamic degenerationespecially in the medio-dorsal and anteroventral nuclei. Phenotypic variability is a perplexing feature of FFI.

==Pathophysiology==
Given its striking clinical and neuropathologic similarities with fatal familial insomnia (FFI), a genetic prion disease linked to a point mutation at codon 178 (D178N) in the PRNP coupled with methionine at codon 129, the MM2T subtype is also known as sporadic FI (sFI). Transmission studies using susceptible transgenic mice have consistently demonstrated that the same prion strain is associated with both sFI and FFI. In contrast to what has been the rule for the most common neurodegenerative disorders, sFI is rarer than its genetic counterpart. Whereas the recognized patients with FFI are numerous and belong to &gt;50 families worldwide, only about 30 cases of CJD MM2T and a few cases with mixed MM2T and MM2C features (MM2T+C) have been recorded to date.

In itself the presence of prions causes reduced glucose to be used by the thalamus and a mild hypo-metabolism of the cingulate cortex. The extent of this symptom varies between two variations of the disease, these being those presenting methionine homozygotes at codon 129 and methionine/valine heterozygotes, with some evidence that hypo-metabolism is more severe in the latter. Given the relationship between the involvement of the thalamus in regulating sleep and alertness, a causal relationship can be drawn and is often mentioned as the cause of insomnia.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis is based on symptoms and can be supported by a sleep study, a PET scan and genetic testing if the patient&#x27;s family has a history of the disease. As with other prion diseases, the diagnosis can be confirmed only by a brain autopsy post-mortem. 

The real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC), a highly sensitive assay that detects minute amounts of PrPSc in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), has been reported to have a sensitivity of 50% in FFI and sFI.[Cracco et al. Handb Clin Neurol 2018][Mock et al. Sci Rep. 2021] However, this low sensitivity may change since the examination was based on a low number of cases, and the RT-QuIC technology is continuously evolving. 

A test that measures the cerebral metabolic rate of glucose by positron emission tomography (PET), referred to as [18F]-FDG-PET, has demonstrated severe hypometabolism of the thalamus bilaterally in FFI and sFI, also in the earliest stages of the disease. This hypometabolism then spreads, eventually impacting most cortical regions.[Cortelli et al. Brain 2006] The complexity and cost of this test currently impedes its use in routine diagnosis.

===Differential diagnosis===
Other diseases involving the mammalian prion protein are known. Some are transmissible (TSEs, including FFI) such as kuru, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, also known as mad cow disease) in cattle and chronic wasting disease in American deer and American elk in some areas of the United States and Canada, as well as Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD). Until recently prion diseases were thought to be transmissible only by direct contact with infected tissue, such as from eating infected tissue, transfusion or transplantation; research suggests that prions can be transmitted by aerosols but that the general public is not at risk of airborne infection.

==Treatments==
Treatment involves palliative care. There is conflicting evidence over the use of sleeping pills, including barbiturates, as a treatment for the disease. Symptoms of fatal familial insomnia may be treated with medications.

Clonazepam may be prescribed to treat muscle spasms, and eszopiclone or zolpidem may be prescribed to help treat insomnia. However these drugs do not work in the long term.

==Prognosis==
Like all prion diseases, the disease is invariably fatal. Life expectancy ranges from seven months to six years, with an average of 18 months.

==Epidemiology and history==

Fatal insomnia was first described by Elio Lugaresi et al. in 1986.

In 1998 40 families were known to carry the gene for FFI globally: eight German, five Italian, four American, two French, two Australian, two British, one Japanese and one Austrian. In the Basque Country of Spain, 16 family cases of the 178N mutation were seen between 1993 and 2005 related to two families with a common ancestor in the 18th century. In 2011, another family was added to the list when researchers found the first man in the Netherlands to be diagnosed with FFI. Whilst he had lived in the Netherlands for 19 years, he was of Egyptian descent. Other prion diseases are similar to FFI and may be related but are missing the &quot;D178N&quot; gene mutation.

, 37 cases of sporadic fatal insomnia have been diagnosed. Unlike in FFI, those with sFI do not have the &quot;D178N&quot; mutation in the &quot;PRNP&quot;-prion gene; they all have a different mutation in the same gene causing methionine homozygosity at codon 129.
Nonetheless, the methionine presence in lieu of the valine (Val129) is what causes the sporadic form of disease. The targeting of this mutation has been suggested as a strategy for treatment, or possibly as a cure for the disease.

===Silvano, 1983, Bologna, Italy===
In late 1983 Italian neurologist/sleep expert Dr Ignazio Roiter received a patient at the University of Bologna hospital&#x27;s sleep institute. The man, known only as Silvano, decided in a rare moment of consciousness to be recorded for future studies and to donate his brain for research in hopes of finding a cure for future victims.

In 1986, Lugaresi and colleagues first named and described in detail the clinical and histopathological features of fatal familial insomnia (FFI) [Lugaresi et al. NEJM]. This report was mostly based on a patient referred to as Silvano, who was diagnosed with sleep impairment in 1983 by Dr. Ignazio Roiter. Dr. Roiter referred the case to Prof. Elio Lugaresi, a well-known sleep expert, who, along with his colleagues, carried out advanced sleep analyses. As Silvano&#x27;s condition quickly deteriorated, Lugaresi arranged for a postmortem neuropathological examination of the brain to be carried out by Dr. Gambetti, Lugaresi&#x27;s former trainee. The collaboration of these two groups led to the 1986 publication [27]. At the time, a prion disease was not suspected due to a lack of prion-related histpathology and frozen brain tissue for advanced analysis. However, due to the devotion of Dr. Roiter and Silvano&#x27;s family, more cases were obtained, resulting in the classification of FFI as a familial prion disease tied to the 178Asn genetic mutation. [Medori et al. NEJM, 1992]

In an article published in 2006, Schenkein and Montagna wrote of a 52-year-old American man who was able to exceed the average survival time by nearly one year with various strategies that included vitamin therapy and meditation, different stimulants and hypnotics and even complete sensory deprivation in an attempt to induce sleep at night and increase alertness during the day. He managed to write a book and drive hundreds of miles in this time, but nonetheless, over the course of his trials, the man succumbed to the classic four-stage progression of the illness.

===Egyptian man, 2011, Netherlands===

In 2011, the first reported case in the Netherlands was of a 57-year-old man of Egyptian descent. The man came in with symptoms of double vision and progressive memory loss, and his family also noted he had recently become disoriented, paranoid and confused. Whilst he tended to fall asleep at random during daily activities, he experienced vivid dreams and random muscular jerks during normal slow-wave sleep. After four months of these symptoms, he began to have convulsions in his hands, trunk and lower limbs while awake. The person died at age 58, seven months after the onset of symptoms. An autopsy revealed mild atrophy of the frontal cortex and moderate atrophy of the thalamus. The latter is one of the most common signs of FFI.

==Research==
Still with unclear benefit in humans, a number of treatments have had tentative success in slowing disease progression in animal models, including pentosan polysulfate, mepacrine, and amphotericin B. , a study investigating doxycycline is being carried out.

In 2009, a mouse model was made for FFI. These mice expressed a humanized version of the PrP protein that also contains the&quot; D178N&quot; FFI mutation. These mice appear to have progressively fewer and shorter periods of uninterrupted sleep, damage in the thalamus, and early deaths, similar to humans with FFI.

The Prion Alliance was established by husband and wife duo Eric Minikel and Sonia Vallabh after Vallabh&#x27;s mother was diagnosed with the fatal disease. They conduct research at the Broad Institute to develop therapeutics for human prion diseases. Other research interests involve identifying biomarkers to track the progression of prion disease in living people.

<text>Johann Wilhelm Archenholz was born in Langfuhr (Wrzeszcz) near Danzig (Gdańsk) on 3 September 1741. He was a Prussian officer, Professor of History and a publicist. His book about the history of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–63) was the basis for many reprints, as well as for school books.

==Life==
Archenholz passed from the Berlin Cadet school into the Prussian army at the age of sixteen, and took part in the last campaigns of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Retiring from military service, on account of his wounds, with the rank of captain in 1763, he travelled for sixteen years and visited nearly all the countries of Europe, and resided in England for ten years from 1769 to 1779.

Returning to Germany in 1780, he obtained a lay canonry at Magdeburg Cathedral, and immediately entered upon a literary career by publishing the periodical &quot;Litteratur- und Völkerkunde&quot; (Leipzig, 1782–1791). This was followed in 1785 by &quot;England und Italien&quot; (Leipzig, 1787), in which he gives an appreciation of English political and social institutions. Between 1789 and 1798 he published his &quot;Annalen der britischen Geschichte&quot; (20 volumes). But the work by which he is best known to fame is his history of the Seven Years&#x27; War, &quot;Geschichte des siebenjährigen Krieges&quot; (first published in the &quot;Berliner historisches Taschenbuch&quot; of 1787, and later in 2 volumes.

In 1791 Archenholz lived in France with his family, publishing German language reports about the French Revolution in his journal &quot;Minerva&quot;. While at first he agreed with the ideas of the revolution, his view was changed by the ongoing violence. In 1792 he had to flee the country as he was threatened to be beheaded following some of his political papers.
In 1792 he moved to Hamburg, and there, from 1792 to 1812, edited the &quot;Minerva&quot;, which had a reputation for its literary, historical and political information.

Archenholz commissioned a Berlin artist, , to produce a copper etching for Archenholz&#x27;s History of Gustav Vasa of the famous Swedish Nobility. He died in Öjendorf (part of Hamburg today) on 28 February 1812, where the street Archenholzstraße (&quot;Archenholz street&quot;) and a school called &quot;Grundschule Archenholzstraße&quot; is named after him today.

==Assessment==
Archenholz&#x27; understanding of his role as a publicist was very modern for his times. He strove not to deliver opinions to his readers but instead unbiased facts. His main interest was current politics in Europe as well as their historical development.

<text>Gian Franco Corsi Zeffirelli (; 12 February 1923 – 15 June 2019) was an Italian stage and film director, producer, production designer and politician. He was one of the most significant opera and theatre directors of the post–World War II era, gaining both acclaim and notoriety for his lavish stagings of classical works, as well as his film adaptations of the same.

Films he directed included the Shakespearean adaptations &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1967), starring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton; &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968), for which he received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Director; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1990), starring Mel Gibson and Glenn Close. His Biblical television miniseries &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977) won both national and international acclaim and is still frequently shown at Christmas and Easter in many countries.

A member of the party, he served as the Senator for Catania between 1994 and 2001.

A Grand Officer of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic since 1977, Zeffirelli also received an honorary British knighthood in 2004. Zeffirelli was awarded the Premio Colosseo in 2009 by the city of Rome.

==Early life==
Zeffirelli was born Gian Franco Corsi Zeffirelli in the outskirts of Florence, Tuscany, Italy, after an affair between Florentine Alaide Garosi, a fashion designer, and Ottorino Corsi, a wool and silk dealer from Vinci. Since both were married, Alaide was unable to use her surname or Corsi&#x27;s for her child. She came up with &quot;Zeffiretti&quot;, which are the &quot;little breezes&quot; mentioned in Mozart&#x27;s opera &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, of which she was quite fond. However, it was misspelt in the register and became Zeffirelli. When he was six years old, his mother died and he subsequently grew up under the auspices of the English expatriate community and was particularly involved with the so-called Scorpioni, who inspired his semi-autobiographical film &quot;Tea with Mussolini&quot; (1999).

Italian researchers found that Zeffirelli was one of a handful of living people traceably consanguineous with Leonardo da Vinci. He was a descendant of one of da Vinci&#x27;s siblings.

Zeffirelli graduated from the Accademia di Belle Arti Firenze in 1941 and, following his father&#x27;s advice, entered the University of Florence to study art and architecture. After World War II broke out, he fought as a partisan with the Italian Resistance, before he met up with British soldiers of the 1st Battalion Scots Guards and became their interpreter. After the war, he re-entered the University of Florence to continue his studies, but when he saw Laurence Olivier&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; in 1945, he directed his attention toward theatre instead.

While working for a scene painter in Florence, he was introduced to Luchino Visconti, who hired him as an assistant director for the film &quot;La Terra trema&quot;, which was released in 1948. Visconti&#x27;s methods had a deep impact on Zeffirelli&#x27;s later work. He also worked with directors such as Vittorio De Sica and Roberto Rossellini. In the 1960s, he made his name designing and directing his own plays in London and New York City and soon transferred his ideas to the cinema.

==Career==
===Film===

Zeffirelli&#x27;s first film as director was a version of &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (1967), originally intended for Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni but featuring the Hollywood stars Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton in their stead. Taylor and Burton helped fund production and took a percentage of the profits rather than their normal salaries.

While editing &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot;, Zeffirelli&#x27;s native Florence was devastated by floods. A month later, he released a short documentary, entitled &quot;&quot;, to raise funds for the disaster appeal.

Zeffirelli&#x27;s major breakthrough came the year after, when he presented two teenagers as &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; (1968). It made Zeffirelli a household name – no other subsequent work by him had the immediate impact of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The film earned $14.5 million in domestic rentals at the North American box office in 1969. It was re-released in 1973 and earned $1.7 million in rentals.

Film critic Roger Ebert, for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;I believe Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; is the most exciting film of Shakespeare ever made&quot;.

After two successful film adaptations of Shakespeare, Zeffirelli went on to religious themes, first with a film about the life of St. Francis of Assisi titled &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot; (1972), then his extended mini-series &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot; (1977) with an all-star cast. The latter was a major success in the ratings.

He moved on to contemporary themes with a remake of the boxing picture &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979) and the critically panned &quot;Endless Love&quot; (1981). In the 1980s, he made a series of successful films adapting opera to the screen, with such stars as Plácido Domingo, Teresa Stratas, Juan Pons and Katia Ricciarelli. He returned to Shakespeare with &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1990), casting Mel Gibson in the lead role. His adaptation of the Charlotte Brontë novel &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1996) was a critical success.

Zeffirelli frequently cast unknown actors in major roles: Leonard Whiting (Romeo in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;), Graham Faulkner (St. Francis in &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot;) and Martin Hewitt (David Axelrod in &quot;Endless Love&quot;).

===Opera===
Zeffirelli was a major director of opera productions from the 1950s in Italy and elsewhere in Europe as well as the United States. He began his career in the theatre as assistant to Luchino Visconti. Then he tried his hand at scenography. His first work as a director was buffo operas by Gioachino Rossini. He became a friend of Maria Callas and they worked together on a &quot;La traviata&quot; in Dallas, Texas, in 1958. Of particular note is his 1964 Royal Opera House production of &quot;Tosca&quot; with Maria Callas and Tito Gobbi. In the same year, he created Callas&#x27; last &quot;Norma&quot; at the Paris Opera. He also staged at the Vienna State Opera: &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; (1972), &quot;La Bohème&quot; (1963), and &quot;Carmen&quot; with Elena Obraztsova and Plácido Domingo in 1978. Zeffirelli also collaborated with Joan Sutherland, designing and directing her performances of Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; in 1959. Over the years he created several productions for the Metropolitan Opera in New York, including &quot;La bohème&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Turandot&quot; and &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;. When the new Metropolitan Opera opened at Lincoln Center, he directed its first production, Samuel Barber&#x27;s &quot;Antony and Cleopatra&quot;, starring Leontyne Price.

==Honours==
In 1996, he was awarded an honorary degree for services to the arts by the University of Kent at a graduation ceremony held in Canterbury Cathedral. In 1999, he received the Crystal Globe award for outstanding artistic contribution to world cinema at the Karlovy Vary International Film Festival. In November 2004, he was awarded an honorary knighthood by the United Kingdom.

===Awards and nominations===
==Criticism==
Zeffirelli received criticism from religious groups for what they call the blasphemous representation of biblical figures in his films. He also roused accusations of antisemitism for describing Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot; as a product of &quot;that Jewish cultural scum of Los Angeles which is always spoiling for a chance to attack the Christian world.&quot;

Zeffirelli was a highly conservative Catholic, and served two terms in the Italian senate as a member of Silvio Berlusconi&#x27;s centre-right party. He was criticized by members of the gay community for upholding the Catholic Church&#x27;s position on homosexuality and by others for support of the Church&#x27;s position on abortion, which extended to calling for capital punishment for women who had terminated a pregnancy.

He roused controversy again when he told a newspaper in 2006 that he had not suffered any harm from sexual abuse by a priest as a child.

==Personal life==

In 1996, Zeffirelli came out as gay, but thereafter preferred to be discreet about his personal life. Zeffirelli said that he considered himself &quot;homosexual&quot; rather than gay, as he felt the term &quot;gay&quot; was less elegant. Zeffirelli adopted two adult sons, men with whom he had lived and who worked for him for years, managing his affairs.

===Allegations of sexual assault===
Director Bruce Robinson claimed to have been the target of unwanted amorous attention from Zeffirelli during the filming of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, in which Robinson played Benvolio. Robinson says that he based the lecherous character of Uncle Monty in the film &quot;Withnail and I&quot; on Zeffirelli.

In 2018, the American actor Johnathon Schaech alleged that Zeffirelli sexually assaulted him during the filming of &quot;Sparrow&quot; (&quot;Storia di una capinera&quot;, 1993). Zeffirelli&#x27;s son Giuseppe &quot;Pippo&quot;, adopted by the filmmaker as an adult, issued a statement at the time denying the allegation.

===Death===
Zeffirelli died at his home in Rome on 15 June 2019, aged 96.

<text>Merced (; Spanish for &quot;Mercy&quot;) is a city in, and the county seat of, Merced County, California, United States, in the San Joaquin Valley. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 86,333, up from 78,958 in 2010. Incorporated on April 1, 1889, Merced is a charter city that operates under a council–manager government. It is named after the Merced River, which flows nearby.

Merced, known as the &quot;Gateway to Yosemite&quot;, is less than two hours by automobile from Yosemite National Park to the east and Monterey Bay, the Pacific Ocean, and multiple beaches to the west. The community is served by the passenger rail service Amtrak, a minor, heavily subsidized airline through Merced Regional Airport, and three bus lines. It is approximately from Sacramento, from San Francisco, from Fresno, and from Los Angeles.

In 2005, the city became home to the 10th University of California campus, University of California, Merced (UC Merced), the first research university built in the U.S. in the 21st century.

==History==

The first Merced post office opened in 1870. Merced incorporated in 1889 and now operates under the council-manager form of government.

During World War II, the Merced County fairgrounds were the site of a temporary &quot;assembly center&quot; where Japanese Americans were detained after being removed from their West Coast homes under Executive Order 9066. 4,669 men, women and children from central California (with most coming from Merced County) were confined in the Merced Assembly Center from May 6 to September 15, 1942, when they were transferred to the more permanent Granada internment camp in Colorado.

Since 2005, Merced has been home to the University of California, Merced. Historic cultural attractions in the city include The Mainzer Theater which is known for its historic and architectural value, the County Courthouse Museum , the Merced Multicultural Arts Center and the County Library.

Also within a short distance from the city limits are the Castle Air Museum, Lake Yosemite, and Merced Falls. The city of Merced along with its surrounding cities are serviced by the &quot;Merced Sun-Star&quot; and the &quot;Merced County Times&quot;. The &quot;Merced Sun-Star&quot; daily newspaper has a circulation of 14,219 daily and 18,569 Saturday in the Merced area.

We see a lot of them coming in and buying properties, even coming in now when the prices are moving up quickly because they know they can rent those.&quot;

===Hmong community===

Escaping persecution from Communist forces after the Laotian Civil War, Hmong refugees from Laos moved to the United States in the 1970s and &#x27;80s, first settling in Merced and other areas in the Central Valley of California. The Hmong could not initially take part in farming like they had expected, as the land was owned by other people. They could not get high end agricultural jobs because they did not speak sufficient English and Mexican migrants already held low end agricultural jobs. As such, a great many of Merced&#x27;s Hmong collected social services and Hmong gangs arose, prompting other residents to perceive them as being the cause of economic troubles. As the Hmong settlement matured and the Hmong children gained English language skills, the town&#x27;s overall attitude began to be more accepting of the Hmong community.

This acceptance is reflected in various services provided to the Hmong community. This includes the Merced Lao Family Community Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides social services to Hmong people, the Merced Department of Public Health&#x27;s MATCH (Multidisciplinary Approach to Cross-Cultural Health) program, intending to draw Hmong patients into the health care system, a body of Hmong-speaking faculty and paraprofessionals (including college classes on Hmong culture and language), and media outlets for the Hmong community—cable television channel Channel 11 broadcasts programming to the Hmong community twice per week and radio station KBIF 900 AM airs programming oriented towards Hmong people.

While Merced has historically had a proportionally large portion of Hmong (in 1997, 12,000 of Merced&#x27;s 61,000 residents were Hmong), demographic shifts have reduced this. The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 prompted a move of some Hmong to Minnesota, North Carolina, and Wisconsin. More recently, many Hmong have gone to Alaska to work in crabbing and fishing industries that require little proficiency in English.

===Black community===
Through the years, Merced County has recognized many historic milestones. Some of those essential moments include the rise of Merced&#x27;s first Black mayor, Sam Pipes in 1983 and the visit by first lady Michelle Obama to UC Merced for the university&#x27;s 2009 commencement.

There&#x27;s also the story of the late Charles Ogletree, a Merced native who rose from poverty to become a respected Harvard Law professor. Ogletree taught both Barack and Michelle Obama at Harvard; he remained close to Barack Obama throughout his apolitical career.[13]
Ogletree wrote opinion pieces on the state of race in the United States for major publications.[14] Ogletree also served as the moderator for a panel discussion on civil rights in baseball on March 28, 2008, that accompanied the second annual Major League Baseball civil rights exhibition game the following day between the New York Mets and the Chicago White Sox.[15]

===Racial demographics===
In 2010, Latinos became a majority population in Merced and Merced County as the agricultural industry brought in migrant farm laborers. The area&#x27;s affordable housing prices attracted both Latino and Asian immigrants. Merced has large Asian-American (e.g. Hmong, followed by Chinese, Vietnamese, Laotian, Cambodian, Filipino, Thai, Korean and Asian Indian) populations relative to the city and county&#x27;s population size.

In Merced County, Black history goes back to before the Civil War. According to historian Sarah Lim, during the mid-1800s Blacks came to this region and California as enslaved persons, while others arrived as free settlers. The 2011 census reported that 9,837 Black or African Americans lived in Merced County

===Crime===
In 2021, Merced had approximately 4,000 violent crimes occur within the city. This means that with a population of just 89,303 people, in 2021, individuals had approximately a 4.5% chance of falling victim to a crime while living-in or visiting Merced. Of the crimes that occurred, roughly 1,200 were physical (such as assault, rape or homicide) and 2,500 were property-related (e.g. burglary and theft). However, these crimes occurring in 2021 resulted in 13 fatalities. With its high crime rate, Merced is considered one of the &quot;50 most dangerous&quot; Californian cities to live in.

====High-speed rail====

The California High-Speed Rail Authority February 2016 draft business plan, outlined the Merced station as not beginning service at the same time as the initial San Jose to Bakersfield route in 2025, but would likely open in 2029 instead. This would make the leg between the Central Valley and Pacheco Pass the first to be constructed. The Merced City Council vigorously opposed the delay in their city&#x27;s station opening, noting Merced&#x27;s volume of commuters seeking high-speed rail to access jobs in Silicon Valley. In response, the April 2016 revisions to the business plan indeed included Merced in the initial construction segment, initially as a single-track spur connecting only to the westbound track to the Bay Area, with build out of the full Wye happening later. The system will run from San Francisco to the Los Angeles basin in under three hours at speeds capable of over 200 miles per hour. In August 2022, the CAHSRA announced that it had received a $25,000,000 RAISE Grant to advance design work from Madera to Merced.

Sample trips in the California High Speed rail would include:
*Merced to Fresno - 30 minutes
*Merced to Sacramento – 43 minutes
*Merced to San Jose – 45 minutes
*Merced to San Francisco – 1 hour and 15 minutes
*Merced to Los Angeles – 1 hour and 40 minutes

<text>Cecil Antonio Richardson (5 June 1928 – 14 November 1991) was an English theatre and film director, producer and screenwriter, whose career spanned five decades. He was identified with the &quot;angry young men&quot; group of British directors and playwrights during the 1950s, and was later a key figure in the British New Wave filmmaking movement.

His films &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1959), &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960), &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962) are considered classics of kitchen sink realism. He won the 1964 Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture for the film &quot;Tom Jones&quot;. He was also a two-time BAFTA Award winner, and was twice nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or.

With his wife Vanessa Redgrave, Richardson was the father to actresses Natasha Richardson and Joely Richardson.

== Early life ==
Richardson was born in Shipley, West Riding of Yorkshire in 1928 to Clarence Albert Richardson, a chemist, and his wife, Elsie Evans (née Campion). He lived on the edge of Saltaire as a young child and kept grass snakes with his childhood friend Joan Naylor. He was Head Boy at Ashville College, Harrogate and attended Wadham College, University of Oxford. His Oxford contemporaries included Rupert Murdoch, Margaret Thatcher, Kenneth Tynan, Lindsay Anderson and Gavin Lambert. He had the unprecedented distinction of being president of both the Oxford University Dramatic Society and the Experimental Theatre Club (the ETC), in addition to being the theatre critic for the university magazine &quot;Isis&quot;. Those he cast in his student productions included Shirley Williams (as Cordelia), John Schlesinger, Nigel Davenport and Robert Robinson.

== Career ==

In 1955, in his directing debut, Richardson produced Jean Giraudoux&#x27;s &quot;The Apollo of Bellac&quot; for television with Denholm Elliott and Natasha Parry in the main roles. Around the same time he began to be active in Britain&#x27;s Free Cinema movement, co-directing the non-fiction short &quot;Momma Don&#x27;t Allow&quot; (also 1955) with Karel Reisz.

Part of the British &quot;New Wave&quot; of directors, he was involved in the formation of the English Stage Company, along with his close friend George Goetschius and George Devine. He directed John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre, and in the same period he directed Shakespeare in Stratford-upon-Avon. Then in 1957 he directed Laurence Olivier as Archie Rice in Osborne&#x27;s next play &quot;The Entertainer&quot;, again for the Royal Court.

In 1959, Richardson co-founded Woodfall Film Productions with John Osborne and producer Harry Saltzman, and, as Woodfall&#x27;s debut, directed the film version of &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1959), his first feature film. &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960), &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (1961), and &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962), based on the novel by Alan Sillitoe, also were produced by Woodfall.

Many of Richardson&#x27;s films, such as &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; and &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot;, were part of the acclaimed kitchen sink realism movement popular in Britain at the time, and several of his films continue to be held as cornerstones of the movement.

In 1964, Richardson received two Academy Awards (Best Director and Best Picture) for &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963) based on the novel by Henry Fielding. In the same year he joined the &quot;Who Killed Kennedy Committee?&quot; set up by Bertrand Russell.

His next film was &quot;The Loved One&quot; (1965), in which he worked with established stars, including John Gielgud, Rod Steiger and Robert Morse, and worked in Hollywood both on location and on the sound stage. In his autobiography, he confesses that he did not share the general admiration of Haskell Wexler, who worked on &quot;The Loved One&quot; as both director of photography and a producer.

Among stars that Richardson directed were Jeanne Moreau, Orson Welles, Rob Lowe, Milton Berle, Trevor Howard, David Hemmings, Nicol Williamson, Tom Courtenay, Lynn Redgrave, Marianne Faithfull, Richard Burton, Jodie Foster, Anthony Hopkins, Mick Jagger, Katharine Hepburn, Seth Green, Tommy Lee Jones and Judi Dench. His musical composers included Antoine Duhamel, John Addison and Shel Silverstein. His screenwriters were Jean Genet, Christopher Isherwood, Terry Southern, Marguerite Duras, Edward Bond (adapting Vladimir Nabokov) and Edward Albee. Richardson and Osborne eventually fell out during production of the film &quot;Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968). The basic issue was Osborne&#x27;s unwillingness to go through the rewrite process, more arduous in film than it is in the theatre. Richardson had a different version. In his autobiography (p. 195), he writes that Osborne was angry at being replaced in a small role by Laurence Harvey to whom the producers had obligations. Osborne took literary revenge by creating a fictionalised and pseudonymous Richardson – a domineering and arrogant character whom everyone hated – in his play &quot;The Hotel in Amsterdam&quot;.

Richardson&#x27;s work was stylistically varied. &quot;Mademoiselle&quot; (1966) was shot noir-style on location in rural France with a static camera, monochrome film stock and no music. &quot;The Charge of the Light Brigade&quot; (1968) was part epic and part animated feature. &quot;Ned Kelly&quot; (1970) was what might be called an Aussie-western. &quot;Laughter in the Dark&quot; (1969) and &quot;A Delicate Balance&quot; (1973) were psycho-dramas. &quot;Joseph Andrews&quot; (1977), based on another novel by Henry Fielding, was a return to the mood of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;.

In 1970, Richardson was set to direct a film about Vaslav Nijinsky with a script by Edward Albee. It was to have starred Rudolf Nureyev as Nijinsky, Claude Jade as Romola and Paul Scofield as Diaghilev, but producer Harry Saltzman cancelled the project during pre-production.

In 1974, he travelled to Los Angeles to work on a script (never produced) with Sam Shepard, and took up residence there. Later that year, he began work on &quot;Mahogany&quot; (1975), starring Diana Ross, but was fired by Motown head Berry Gordy shortly after production began, owing to creative differences.

He wrote and directed the comedy-drama &quot;The Hotel New Hampshire&quot; (1984), based on John Irving&#x27;s novel of the same name and starring Jodie Foster, Beau Bridges and Rob Lowe. Although it was a box-office failure, the film received a positive critical reception.

Richardson made four more major films before his death. His last, &quot;Blue Sky&quot; (1994), was not released for nearly three years after he died. Jessica Lange won a Best Actress Oscar for her performance in the film.

In 1966, Richardson is alleged to have financed the escape from Wormwood Scrubs prison of the spy and double agent George Blake.

== Personal life ==
Richardson was married to English actress Vanessa Redgrave from 1962 to 1967. The couple had two daughters, Natasha (1963–2009) and Joely (born 1965), then he left Redgrave for French actress and singer Jeanne Moreau. In 1972, he had a relationship with Grizelda Grimond, who was a secretary for Richardson&#x27;s former business partner Oscar Lewenstein, and daughter of British politician Jo Grimond. Grizelda Grimond gave birth to his daughter, Katherine Grimond, on 8 January 1973.

In 1964 Richardson joined the &quot;Who Killed Kennedy Committee?&quot; set up by Bertrand Russell.

==Death==
Richardson was bisexual, but never acknowledged it publicly until 1985, the same year he contracted HIV. He died of complications from AIDS on 14 November 1991 at the age of 63.

<doc id="43910" wikidata="Q219546" url="?curid=43910" title="Albert Finney">
<text>Albert Finney (9 May 1936 – 7 February 2019) was an English actor. He attended the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and worked in the theatre before attaining fame for movie acting during the early 1960s, debuting with &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960), directed by Tony Richardson, who had previously directed him in theatre. He maintained a successful career in theatre, film and television.

He is known for his roles in &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960), &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), &quot;Two for the Road&quot; (1967), &quot;Scrooge&quot; (1970), &quot;Annie&quot; (1982), &quot;The Dresser&quot; (1983), &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990), &quot;A Man of No Importance&quot; (1994), &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000), &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003), &quot; “[A Good Year]”(2006), The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007), &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (2007), and the James Bond film &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012), and for his performances on stage and television.

A recipient of BAFTA, Golden Globe, Emmy, Screen Actors Guild, Silver Bear and Volpi Cup awards, Finney was nominated for an Academy Award five times, as Best Actor four times, for &quot;Tom Jones&quot; (1963), &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974), &quot;The Dresser&quot; (1983), and &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; (1984), and as Best Supporting Actor for &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000). He received several awards for his performance as Winston Churchill in the 2002 BBC–HBO television biographical movie &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot;.

==Early life==
Finney was born on 9 May 1936 in Salford, Lancashire, the youngest of three children and only son of Albert Finney, a bookmaker, and Alice (née Hobson). He was educated at Tootal Drive Primary School, Salford Grammar School, and the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), from which he graduated in 1956.

==Career==
===1956–1962: Early career===
While at RADA, Finney made an early television appearance playing Mr Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;She Stoops to Conquer.&quot; The BBC filmed and broadcast the RADA students&#x27; performances at the Vanbrugh Theatre in London on Friday 6 January 1956. Other members of the cast included Roy Kinnear and Richard Briers. Finney graduated from RADA and became a member of the Royal Shakespeare Company. He was offered a contract by the Rank Organisation, but refused it to perform for the Birmingham Rep. He was in a production of &quot;The Miser&quot; for Birmingham Rep, which was filmed for the BBC in 1956. Also for the BBC he appeared in &quot;The Claverdon Road Job&quot; (1957) and &quot;View Friendship and Marriage&quot; (1958). 

At Birmingham he played the title role of &quot;Henry V&quot;, and in 1958, made his London stage debut in Jane Arden&#x27;s &quot;The Party&quot;, directed by Charles Laughton, who featured in the production along with his wife, Elsa Lanchester. In 1959, Finney appeared at Stratford in the title role of &quot;Coriolanus&quot;, replacing an ill Laurence Olivier. Finney guest featured for several episodes of &quot;Emergency-Ward 10&quot; and was Lysander in a TV version of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1959) directed by Peter Hall.

Finney&#x27;s first film appearance was in Tony Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainer&quot; (1960), with Laurence Olivier. Finney and Alan Bates played Olivier&#x27;s sons. He made his film breakthrough in the same year with his portrayal of a disillusioned factory worker in Karel Reisz&#x27;s film version of Alan Sillitoe&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; (1960), produced by Richardson. The film was a success, being the third most popular movie in Britain that year. It earned more than half a million pounds of profit. Finney then did &quot;Billy Liar&quot; (1960) on stage and for British television. Finney had been chosen to play T. E. Lawrence in David Lean&#x27;s production of &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; after a successful and elaborate screen-test that took four days to shoot. However, Finney baulked at signing a multi-year contract for producer Sam Spiegel and chose to decline the role.

Finney created the title role in &quot;Luther&quot;, the 1961 play by John Osborne depicting the life of Martin Luther. He performed the role with the English Stage Company in London, Nottingham, Paris and New York. The original West End run at the Phoenix ended in March 1962, after 239 performances there, when Finney had to quit the cast to fulfil a contractual obligation with a movie company.

===1963–1977===
Finney starred in the Academy Award-winning 1963 film &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, directed by Richardson and written by Osborne. Due to the success of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;, British exhibitors voted Finney the ninth most popular film actor in 1963. Finney received 10% of the film&#x27;s earnings, which made him over $1 million.

Finney followed this with a small part in ensemble war film &quot;The Victors&quot; (1963), which was a box-office failure. He then made his Broadway debut in &quot;Luther&quot; in 1963. When that run ended he decided to take a year off and sail around the world. &quot;People told me to cash in on my success while I was hot,&quot; he later said. &quot;I&#x27;d been acting for about eight years and had only had one vacation ... Captain Cook had been a hero of mine when I was a kid, and I thought it would be exciting to go to some of the places in the Pacific where he&#x27;d been.&quot; The success of &quot;Tom Jones&quot; enabled Finney to produce his next film, &quot;Night Must Fall&quot;, in 1964, which he also featured in and which was directed by Reisz. A remake of the classic 1937 film of the same title, the film was a failure and Finney&#x27;s performance received poor reviews. 

Finney undertook a season of plays at the Royal National Theatre, including &quot;Miss Julie&quot; by August Strindberg in 1965. He continued acting on films with &quot;Two for the Road&quot; (1967) co-featuring Audrey Hepburn. He and Michael Medwin formed a production company, Memorial Productions, which made &quot;Privilege&quot; (1967), directed by Peter Watkins; &quot;The Burning&quot; (1968), a short directed by Stephen Frears; and &quot;If...&quot; (1968), directed by Lindsay Anderson. Memorial also did stage productions, such as &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot;, which Finney performed in London and then Broadway. Memorial also produced some in which Finney did not appear, such as &quot;Spring and Port Wine&quot; and &quot;The Burgular&quot;. Memorial then made &quot;Charlie Bubbles&quot; (1968), which Finney featured in and also directed. Liza Minnelli made her feature debut in the movie. Finney later called it &quot;the most intense sense of creation I&#x27;ve ever had.&quot; Finney featured in &quot;The Picasso Summer&quot; in 1969, and played the title role in the musical &quot;Scrooge&quot; in 1970.
Finney then made &quot;Gumshoe&quot; (1971), the first feature film directed by Stephen Frears, for Memorial. Memorial continued to produce films in which Finney did not appear: &quot;Spring and Port Wine&quot; (1970), with James Mason; &quot;Loving Memory&quot; (1971), an early directorial effort from Tony Scott; &quot;Bleak Moments&quot; (1971), the first feature from Mike Leigh; &quot;O Lucky Man!&quot; (1973) for Anderson; and &quot;Law and Disorder&quot; (1974); filmed in Hollywood. In 1972, Finney returned to stage after a six-year absence with &quot;Alpha Beta&quot;, which he later filmed on television with Rachel Roberts. Memorial Productions stopped producing and Finney emphasized acting. &quot;It was OK at first,&quot; he later said, &quot;but in the end it was sitting in an office, pitching ideas to Hollywood and waiting for the phone to ring.&quot;

Finney played Agatha Christie&#x27;s Belgian master detective Hercule Poirot in the film &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; (1974). Finney became so well known for the role that he complained that it typecast him for a number of years, &quot;People really do think I am 300 pounds with a French accent&quot;, he said. He received nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor and the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

He announced he intended to direct the film, &quot;The Girl in Melanie Klein&quot;, for Memorial, but it was not made.

Finney decided to take time off from features and focus on stage acting, doing classics at the National Theatre in London. &quot;I felt that it needed commitment,&quot; he later said. &quot;When you&#x27;re making movies all the time, you stop breathing. You literally don&#x27;t breathe in the same way that you do when you&#x27;re playing the classics. When you have to deliver those long, complex speeches on stage, you can&#x27;t heave your shoulders after every sentence. The set of muscles required for that kind of acting need to be trained. I really wanted to try and do justice to my own potential in the parts. I didn&#x27;t want to be a movie actor just dropping in, doing Hamlet and taking off again. I wanted to feel part of the company.&quot; 

Finney was at the National for over three years during which he played in Hamlet, Macbeth, Tamburlaine, and plays by Anton Chekhov. Finney made a TV film &quot;Forget-Me-Not-Lane&quot; in 1975, which was written by Peter Nichols, and he also performed a brief role in &quot;The Duellists&quot; (1977), the first feature directed by Ridley Scott. He also released an album through Motown.

===1981–1999===

Finney had not played a major role in a feature film in six years, and started to think about resuming work with cinema. The last two successful films he had made were &quot;Scrooge&quot; and &quot;Orient Express&quot; in which he was heavily disguised. &quot;Most Americans probably think I weigh 300 pounds, have black hair and talk with a French accent like Hercule Poirot,&quot; said Finney. &quot;So I thought they should have a look at me while I was still almost a juvenile and kind of cute.&quot; Finney decided to make six movies in succession &quot;so that I could relax and get back into it again. In order to feel really assured and comfortable in front of a camera, you&#x27;ve got to do it for a while.&quot; The first three were thrillers: &quot;Loophole&quot; (1981), with Susannah York; &quot;Wolfen&quot; (1981), directed by Michael Wadleigh; and &quot;Looker&quot; (1981), written and directed by Michael Crichton. He received excellent reviews for his performance in the drama &quot;Shoot the Moon&quot; (1982). Finney said the role &quot;required personal acting; I had to dig into myself. When you have to expose yourself and use your own vulnerability, you can get a little near the edge.&quot; 

Less well received was his performance as Daddy Warbucks in the Hollywood film version of &quot;Annie&quot; (1982), which was directed by John Huston. Finney said doing this movie after &quot;Shoot The Moon&quot; was &quot;marvelous. I use a completely different side of myself as Warbucks. &quot;Annie&quot; is show biz; it&#x27;s open, simple and direct. It needs bold, primary colors. I don&#x27;t have to reveal the inner workings of the character, and that&#x27;s a relief.&quot;

Finney featured in Peter Yates-directed movie &quot;The Dresser&quot; (1983) as Sir, a deteriorating veteran actor struggling through a difficult performance of &quot;King Lear&quot;. He earned nominations for the Academy Award for Best Actor, the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role, and the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama. He then played the title role for the TV film &quot;Pope John Paul II&quot; (1984), his American television debut. Huston cast Finney in the lead role of &quot;Under the Volcano&quot; (1984), which earned both men great acclaim, including another Best Actor Oscar nomination for Finney. Finney played the lead role of Sydney Kentridge in &quot;The Biko Inquest&quot;, a 1984 dramatization of the inquest into the death of Steve Biko which was filmed for television after a London run.

Finney performed on stage in &quot;Orphans&quot; in 1986, and the film version, directed by Alan J. Pakula. He had the lead in a television miniseries, &quot;The Endless Game&quot; (1989), written and directed by Bryan Forbes. Finney began the 1990s with the lead role in a film for HBO, &quot;The Image&quot; (1990). He received great acclaim playing the gangster boss in &quot;Miller&#x27;s Crossing&quot; (1990), replacing Trey Wilson shortly before filming. Finney made an appearance at Roger Waters&#x27; &quot;The Wall – Live in Berlin&quot; (1990), where he played &quot;The Judge&quot; during the performance of &quot;The Trial&quot;.

Finney featured in the BBC &quot;TV serial The Green Man&quot;, based on the Kingsley Amis novel. He followed it with &quot;The Playboys&quot; (1992) for Gillies MacKinnon; &quot;Rich in Love&quot; (1993) for Bruce Beresford; &quot;The Browning Version&quot; (1994) for Mike Figgis; &quot;A Man of No Importance&quot; (1994), for Suri Krishnamma; and &quot;The Run of the Country&quot; (1995) for Peter Yates. In 1994, Finney played a gay bus conductor in early 1960s Dublin in &quot;A Man of No Importance&quot;. He had the main role in Dennis Potter&#x27;s final two plays, &quot;Karaoke&quot; and &quot;Cold Lazarus&quot; (both 1996). In the latter he played a frozen, disembodied head. Finney did &quot;Nostromo&quot; (1997) for television, and &quot;Washington Square&quot; (1997) for Agnieszka Holland then made &quot;A Rather English Marriage&quot; (1998) with Tom Courtenay. He had supporting roles in &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot; (1999) and &quot;Simpatico&quot; (1999).

===2000–2019===
Finney had his biggest success in several years with &quot;Erin Brockovich&quot; (2000), alongside Julia Roberts for Steven Soderbergh. His portrayal of real-life California lawyer Edward L. Masry earned him a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, his fifth and final Oscar nomination. Finney had a cameo in Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Traffic&quot; (2000) and played Ernest Hemingway in &quot;Hemingway, the Hunter of Death&quot; (2001) for TV. He had the main role in &quot;Delivering Milo&quot; (2001) and in 2002 his critically acclaimed portrayal of Winston Churchill in &quot;The Gathering Storm&quot; won him British Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA), Emmy and Golden Globe awards as Best Actor.

He also played the title role of the television series &quot;My Uncle Silas&quot;, based on the short stories by H. E. Bates, about a roguish but lovable poacher-cum-farm labourer looking after his great-nephew. The show played for two series broadcast in 2001 and 2003. Finney had a major role in &quot;Big Fish&quot; (2003) directed by Tim Burton, and did another cameo for Soderbergh in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; (2004). He sang in Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005) and the film of &quot;Aspects of Love&quot; (2005).

Finney was reunited with Ridley Scott in &quot;A Good Year&quot; (2006). He had support roles in &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; (2006), &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007), and &quot;Before the Devil Knows You&#x27;re Dead&quot; (2007), which reunited him with &quot;Murder on the Orient Express&quot; director Sidney Lumet. His final film role was in &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012). A lifelong supporter of Manchester United Football Club, Finney narrated the documentary &quot;Munich&quot;, about the air crash that killed most of the Busby Babes in 1958, which was shown on United&#x27;s TV channel MUTV in February 2008.

===Theatre===
He received Tony Award nominations for &quot;Luther&quot; (1964) and &quot;A Day in the Death of Joe Egg&quot; (1968), and also starred on stage in &quot;Love for Love&quot;, Strindberg&#x27;s &quot;Miss Julie&quot;, &quot;Black Comedy&quot;, &quot;The Country Wife&quot;, &quot;Alpha Beta&quot;, Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;, &quot;Tamburlaine the Great&quot;, &quot;Another Time&quot; and, his last stage appearance, in 1997, &quot;&quot;Art&quot;&quot; by Yasmina Reza, which preceded the 1998 Tony Award-winning Broadway run.

He won an Olivier Award for &quot;Orphans&quot; in 1986 and won three &quot;Evening Standard&quot; Theatre Awards for Best Actor.

Finney never abandoned stage work and continued his association with the National Theatre Company in London, where he had performed during the mid-1960s in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; at the Old Vic and Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; during the 1970s at the National Theatre.

==Personal life and death==

In 1957, Finney married actress Jane Wenham; they had a son, Simon Finney, who works in the movie industry as a camera operator. They divorced in 1961. In 1970, Finney married French actress Nicole Dreyfus (&quot;Anouk Aimée&quot;), a union that lasted eight years. In 2006, he married Penelope Delmage, a travel agent. They remained together until Finney&#x27;s death.

In May 2011, Finney disclosed that he had been receiving treatment for kidney cancer. According to a 2012 interview, he had been diagnosed with the disease five years earlier and had had surgery, followed by six rounds of chemotherapy. Finney died of a chest infection at the Royal Marsden Hospital on 7 February 2019; he was 82.

<doc id="43913" wikidata="Q83484" url="?curid=43913" title="Anthony Quinn">
<text>Manuel Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca (April 21, 1915 – June 3, 2001), known as Anthony Quinn, was an American actor. He was known for his portrayal of earthy, passionate characters &quot;marked by a brutal and elemental virility&quot; in over 100 film, television and stage roles between 1936 and 2002. He was a two-time Academy Award winner, and was also nominated for five Golden Globe Awards, two BAFTA Awards and a Tony Award.

Quinn was born in Chihuahua City, Mexico, and was raised in El Paso, Texas and East Los Angeles. After stints as a boxer and an architect, he made his film debut in the Cecil B. DeMille Western &quot;The Plainsman&quot; in 1936. Initially typecast as a “heavy” and playing other minor parts as well, he was gradually cast in more substantial parts, including co-starring roles in &quot;Blood and Sand&quot; (1941) and &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot; (1943). He won his first Oscar, for Best Supporting Actor, for his portrayal of Eufemio Zapata in &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952), becoming the first Mexican-born performer to win an Academy Award. He received his second Oscar in 1957 for &quot;Lust for Life&quot;.

He would be nominated for Best Actor twice more, for his roles in &quot;Wild is the Wind&quot; (1958) and &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; (1964). His other notable films included &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954), &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot; (1962), &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), &quot;Guns for San Sebastian&quot; (1968), &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot; (1968), &quot;Across 110th Street&quot; (1972), &quot;The Message&quot; (1976), &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot; (1980), &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; (1991) and &quot;Seven Servants&quot; (1996). He also starred in the Broadway plays &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (replacing Marlon Brando), &quot;Becket&quot; (earning a Tony nomination for Best Actor in a Play), and &quot;Zorba&quot; (reprising his film role).

Aside from his acting career, Quinn was also a civil rights activist, an avid painter, and the author of several autobiographical books. In 1987, he was presented with the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award. Through both his artistic endeavors and activism, he is considered a seminal figure of Latin-American representation in the media of the United States.

==Early life and education==
===1915–1936: Childhood, studies and early acting===
Manuel Antonio Rodolfo Quinn Oaxaca was born April 21, 1915, in Chihuahua, Mexico, during the Mexican Revolution to Manuela &quot;Nellie&quot; (née Oaxaca) and Francisco &quot;Frank&quot; Quinn. Frank Quinn was born to an Irish immigrant father from County Cork and a Mexican mother. Frank reportedly rode with Mexican revolutionary Pancho Villa, then later moved to the East Los Angeles neighborhood of City Terrace and became an assistant cameraman at a movie studio. In Quinn&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Original Sin: A Self-portrait by Anthony Quinn&quot;, he denied being the son of an &quot;Irish adventurer&quot; and attributed that tale to Hollywood publicists. Quinn later said he was not accepted in Mexico because of his surname.

When he was six years old, Quinn attended a Catholic church and even contemplated becoming a priest, but at the age of 11, he joined the Pentecostals at the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, which was founded and led by the evangelical preacher Aimee Semple McPherson. For a time, Quinn played in the church&#x27;s band and was an apprentice preacher with the evangelist. &quot;I have known most of the great actresses of my time, and not one of them could touch her,&quot; Quinn once said of the spellbinding McPherson, whom he credited with inspiring Zorba&#x27;s gesture of the dramatically outstretched hand.

Quinn grew up first in El Paso, Texas, and later in East Los Angeles and in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles, California. He attended Hammel Street Elementary School, Belvedere Junior High School, Polytechnic High School, and Belmont High School in Los Angeles, with future baseball player and &quot;General Hospital&quot; star John Beradino, but left before graduating. In June 1987, Tucson High School in Arizona awarded him an honorary high-school diploma.

As a young man, Quinn boxed professionally to earn money, then studied art and architecture under Frank Lloyd Wright at the designer&#x27;s Arizona residence and his Wisconsin studio, Taliesin. The two men became friends. When Quinn mentioned that he was drawn to acting, Wright encouraged him. Quinn said he had been offered $800 per week by a film studio and did not know what to do. Wright replied, &quot;Take it, you&#x27;ll never make that much with me.&quot; During a 1999 interview on &quot;Private Screenings with Robert Osborne&quot;, Quinn said the contract was for only $300 per week.

==Career==

===1936–1952: Beginnings in cinema===
After a short time performing on the stage, Quinn launched his film career performing character roles in the 1936 films &quot;The Plainsman&quot; (as a Cheyenne Indian after Custer&#x27;s defeat with Gary Cooper), &quot;Parole&quot; (in which he made his debut), and &quot;The Milky Way&quot;, his first motion picture, although he was not credited. He played &quot;ethnic&quot; villains in Paramount films such as &quot;Dangerous to Know&quot; (1938) with Anna May Wong and &quot;Road to Morocco&quot; with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and played a more sympathetic Crazy Horse in &quot;They Died with Their Boots On&quot; with Errol Flynn.

A breakthrough in his career occurred in 1941, when he received an offer to play a matador in the bullfighting-themed &quot;Blood and Sand&quot; with Tyrone Power and Rita Hayworth. In 1942, Quinn co-starred alongside Power in another critical and financial success, the swashbuckling adventure &quot;The Black Swan&quot;. In 1943, he had a role in the Oscar-nominated Western &quot;The Ox-Bow Incident&quot;. He co-starred in &quot;Sinbad the Sailor&quot; (1947) with Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. and Maureen O&#x27;Hara.

By 1947, Quinn had appeared in more than 50 films and had played a variety of characters, including Indians, Mafia dons, Hawaiian chiefs, Filipino freedom fighters, Chinese guerrillas, and Arab sheiks. He returned to the theater, replacing Marlon Brando as Stanley Kowalski in &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; on Broadway. In 1947, he became a naturalized citizen of the United States.

He returned to Hollywood in the early 1950s, and was cast in a series of B-adventures such as &quot;Mask of the Avenger&quot; (1951). He solidified his position as one of Hollywood&#x27;s premier actors in Elia Kazan&#x27;s &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952), opposite Marlon Brando. Quinn&#x27;s performance as Zapata&#x27;s brother won him an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor while Brando lost the Oscar for Best Actor to Gary Cooper in &quot;High Noon&quot;. Quinn holds the distinction of being the first Mexican-American to win an Academy Award.

===1953–1959: International films and career success===
In the late 1950s, Quinn traveled to Rome, where he collaborated with several renowned Italian filmmakers and established himself as a star of world cinema. He worked with Dino De Laurentiis and Carlo Ponti in the Kirk Douglas film &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and starred as Attila the Hun, with Sophia Loren, in &quot;Attila&quot;. In 1953, he turned in one of his best performances as a dim-witted, thuggish, and volatile strongman in Federico Fellini&#x27;s Oscar-winning &quot;La Strada&quot; (1954), opposite Giulietta Masina.

Quinn won his second Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of painter Paul Gauguin in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (1956), alongside Kirk Douglas, who portrayed Vincent van Gogh. Quinn also starred as Quasimodo in the French-language film &quot;The Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. Even after his return to the United States, Quinn continued to appear periodically in European films. His frequent portrayal of Italian characters and appearance in Italian films led to the popular misconception that he was, in fact, Italian.

===1959–1969: Return to Hollywood and Broadway===
The following year, he received an Oscar nomination for Best Actor for his part in George Cukor&#x27;s &quot;Wild Is the Wind&quot;. Quinn starred in the film &quot;The Savage Innocents&quot; (1959) as Inuk, an Eskimo who finds himself caught between two clashing cultures. He teamed with Kirk Douglas once again in the Western &quot;Last Train from Gun Hill&quot; (1959).

He appeared on Broadway to great acclaim in &quot;Becket&quot;, as King Henry II to Laurence Olivier&#x27;s Thomas Becket in 1960. Quinn&#x27;s performance earned him a Tony Award nomination for best leading actor and &quot;Becket&quot; received the award for best play. An erroneous story arose in later years that during the run, Quinn and Olivier switched roles and Quinn played Becket to Olivier&#x27;s King. In fact, Quinn left the production for a film, never having played Becket, and director Peter Glenville suggested a road tour with Olivier as Henry. Olivier happily agreed and Arthur Kennedy took on the role of Becket for the tour and brief return to Broadway.

As the decade ended, Quinn allowed his age to show and began his transformation into a major character actor. His physique filled out, his hair grayed, and his once smooth, swarthy face weathered and became more rugged. He played a Greek resistance fighter in &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), an aging boxer in &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;, and the Bedouin &quot;shaikh&quot; Auda abu Tayi in &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (both 1962). &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; would go on to win the Oscar and Golden Globe for best picture, and Quinn received a Golden Globe nomination for best actor alongside co-star Peter O&#x27;Toole. He also played the title role in the 1961 film &quot;Barabbas&quot;, based on a novel by Pär Lagerkvist. In 1962, he returned to Broadway, playing the role of Caesario Grimaldi in the Tony Award-nominated &quot;Tchin-Tchin&quot;, and had the lead role in the film &quot;Requiem for a Heavyweight&quot;.

The success of &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; in 1964 resulted in another Oscar nomination for Best Actor. Other films included &quot;The 25th Hour&quot;, &quot;The Magus&quot;, &quot;Guns for San Sebastian&quot;, and &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot;. In 1969, he starred in &quot;The Secret of Santa Vittoria&quot; with Anna Magnani; each was nominated for a Golden Globe Award.

===1970–1979: Television and later films===
In 1970 Quinn starred as a liberal sociology professor in the campus unrest drama &quot;R. P. M.,&quot; opposite Ann-Margret, and as a Smoky Mountains backwoodsman in &quot;A Walk in the Spring Rain,&quot; Ingrid Bergman&#x27;s first American film in 20 years. In 1971, after the success of a TV movie named &quot;The City&quot;, where Quinn played Mayor Thomas Jefferson Alcala, he starred in the television series, &quot;The Man and the City&quot;. Quinn&#x27;s subsequent television appearances were sporadic, including &quot;Jesus of Nazareth&quot;.

In 1972, he co-starred with Yaphet Kotto in the blaxploitation film &quot;Across 110th Street&quot;. He played NYPD Captain Frank Martelli, who along with Kotto, was investigating a robbery-homicide of Italian and Black gangsters in Harlem, New York City. He played the old racist, violent captain, against Kotto&#x27;s modern, educated, enlightened lieutenant.

In 1976, Quinn starred in the movie &quot;Mohammad, Messenger of God&quot; (also known as &quot;The Message&quot;), about the origin of Islam, as Hamza, a highly respected uncle of Mohammad, the prophet of Islam. In 1981, he starred in &quot;Lion of the Desert&quot;. Quinn played real-life Bedouin leader Omar Mukhtar, who fought Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Italian troops in the deserts of Libya.

In 1979, Quinn starred in the film &quot;The Passage&quot;, as a Basque shepherd during WWII. He was tasked with leading a scientist and his family across the Pyrenees, while pursued by Nazis. It also starred James Mason and Malcolm McDowell.

===1980–1994: Final works===
In 1983, he reprised his role as Zorba for 362 performances in a successful musical version, called &quot;Zorba&quot;, opposite fellow film co-star Lila Kedrova, reprising her role as Madame Hortense. Quinn performed in the musical both on Broadway and at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC.

In 1990, he starred in &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot;, a television movie based on the novel by Ernest Hemingway. Quinn&#x27;s film career slowed during the 1990s, but he nonetheless continued to work steadily, appearing in &quot;Revenge&quot; (1990), &quot;Jungle Fever&quot; (1991), &quot;Only the Lonely&quot; (1991), &quot;Last Action Hero&quot; (1993), &quot;A Walk in the Clouds&quot; (1995) and &quot;Seven Servants&quot; (1996).

In 1994, Quinn played the role of Zeus in five television movies focusing on the legendary journeys of Hercules. These were, in order, &quot;Hercules and the Amazon Women&quot;, &quot;Hercules and the Lost Kingdom&quot;, &quot;Hercules and the Circle of Fire&quot;, &quot;Hercules in the Underworld&quot;, and &quot;Hercules in the Maze of the Minotaur&quot;.

In 1995, Quinn starred in his last movie in a lead role in the film &quot;Seven Servants&quot;, by Daryush Shokof.

==Personal life==
===Relationships and children===
Quinn&#x27;s first wife was actress Katherine DeMille, the adopted daughter of Cecil B. DeMille; they wed in 1937. The couple had five children: Christopher (1938–1941), Christina (born December 1, 1941), Catalina (born November 21, 1942), Duncan (born August 4, 1945), and Valentina (born December 26, 1952). Their first child, Christopher, aged two, drowned in the lily pond of next-door neighbor W. C. Fields. During his marriage to DeMille, Quinn had an affair with the married actress Evelyn Keyes.

In 1965, Quinn and DeMille divorced because of his affair with Italian costume designer Jolanda Addolori (died 2016), whom he married in 1966. They had three children: Francesco Quinn (March 22, 1963 – August 5, 2011), Danny Quinn (born April 16, 1964), and Lorenzo Quinn (born May 7, 1966).

In the 1970s, during his marriage to Addolori, Quinn also had two children with Friedel Dunbar, an event producer in Los Angeles: Sean Quinn (born February 7, 1973) and Alexander Anthony Quinn (born December 30, 1976).

In the 1990s, Quinn had two children with his secretary Katherine Benvin; daughter Antonia Patricia Rose Quinn (born July 23, 1993) and son Ryan Nicholas Quinn (born July 5, 1996). His marriage with Addolori finally ended in divorce in August 1997. He then married Benvin in December 1997 and remained married to her until his death.

===Civil-rights activism===
Quinn, who experienced discrimination growing up in Los Angeles, participated in various civil-rights and social causes. He provided funding for Latino advocacy group the Spanish-Speaking People&#x27;s Congress. He assisted in fundraising efforts for the legal defense of Mexican-American youth in the racially charged Sleepy Lagoon murder trial in 1942. While in Paris, several other prominent Americans and he composed a petition endorsing the 1963 March on Washington; the petition, which was reprinted in several high-profile publications, was intended to rally support among Americans living abroad, according to Elliott Miller, writing in &quot;CounterPunch&quot;. In 1969, Quinn visited with Native American student activists occupying Alcatraz Island in protest, promising to offer assistance. In 1970, Quinn was a panelist at the Mexican-American Conference. In 1971, he narrated a documentary film by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, discussing job discrimination faced by Hispanic Americans. He was a supporter of the United Farm Workers organization led by his friend and labor activist Cesar Chavez.

===Painting and writing===
Art critic Donald Kuspit explains, &quot;Examining Quinn&#x27;s many expressions of creativity together—his art, collecting, and acting—we can see that he was a creative genius.&quot;

Early in life, Quinn had an interest in painting and drawing. Throughout his teenaged years, he won various art competitions in California and focused his studies at Polytechnic High School in Los Angeles on drafting. Later, Quinn studied briefly under Frank Lloyd Wright through the Taliesin Fellowship — an opportunity created by winning first prize in an architectural design contest. Through Wright&#x27;s recommendation, Quinn took acting lessons as a form of postoperative speech therapy, which led to an acting career that spanned over six decades.

Apart from art classes taken in Chicago during the 1950s, Quinn never attended art school; nonetheless, taking advantage of books, museums, and amassing a sizable collection, he managed to give himself an effective education in the language of modern art. By the early 1980s, his work had caught the eyes of various gallery owners and was exhibited internationally, in Mexico City, Los Angeles, New York City, and Paris. His work is now represented in both public and private collections throughout the world.

He wrote two memoirs, &quot;The Original Sin&quot; (1972) and &quot;One Man Tango&quot; (1997), a number of scripts, and a series of unpublished stories currently in the collection of his archive.

==Death==
Quinn spent his last years in Bristol, Rhode Island. He died of respiratory failure (due to complications from radiation treatment for lung cancer) on June 3, 2001, in Boston, at age 86. Quinn&#x27;s funeral was held in the First Baptist Church in America in College Hill, Providence, Rhode Island. His wife asked for the permission of Bristol authorities to bury him in his favorite spot in the backyard of his house, near an old maple tree. They had bought the property in 1995; it had a view of the Narragansett Bay. Permission was granted and he was laid to rest there.

==Tributes and legacy==

On January 5, 1982, the Belvedere County Public Library in East Los Angeles was renamed in honor of Anthony Quinn. The present library sits on the site of his family&#x27;s former home.

In 1984, artist Eloy Torrez produced a 70-foot-high (21 m) portrait mural of Quinn titled both &quot;Anthony Quinn&quot; and &quot;The Pope of Broadway&quot; in Los Angeles. It depicts Quinn in his famous &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; role, and it remains one of the largest portrait murals in California. Both the portrait mural and Anthony Quinn himself are the subject of a 2018 Google Arts &amp; Culture exhibit.

His birthplace of Chihuahua, Mexico, has a statue of Quinn doing his famous &quot;Zorba the Greek&quot; dance.

An Anthony Quinn Bay and Beach is in Rhodes, Greece, just south of the village of Faliraki. Quinn bought the land during the filming of &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; in Rhodes, but it was reclaimed by the Greek government in 1984 due to a change in property law.

Since 2002, the National Council of La Raza has given the &quot;Anthony Quinn Award for Excellence in Motion Pictures&quot; as an ALMA Award. His widow, Katherine Benvin Quinn, established the Anthony Quinn Foundation, which advocates the importance of arts in education.

<text>René Goscinny (, ; 14 August 1926 – 5 November 1977) was a French comic editor and writer, who created the &quot;Astérix&quot; comic book series with illustrator Albert Uderzo. He was raised primarily in Buenos Aires, Argentina, where he attended French schools, and he lived in the United States for a short period of time. There he met Belgian cartoonist Morris. After his return to France, they collaborated for more than 20 years on the comic series &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; (in what was considered the series&#x27; golden age).

He wrote &quot;Iznogoud&quot; with Jean Tabary. Goscinny also wrote a series of children&#x27;s books known as &quot;Le Petit Nicolas&quot; (&quot;Little Nicolas&quot;) illustrated by Jean-Jacques Sempé.

==Early life==
Goscinny was born in Paris in 1926, to Jewish immigrants from Poland. His parents were Stanisław Simkha Gościnny, a chemical engineer from Warsaw, and Anna (Hanna) Bereśniak-Gościnna from Chodorków (modern-day ), a small village near Kyiv in Ukraine. Goscinny&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Abraham Lazare Berezniak, founded a printing company. Claude, Goscinny&#x27;s older brother, was six years older, born on 10 December 1920.

Stanisław and Anna had met in Paris and married in 1919. When René was two, the Gościnnys moved to Buenos Aires, Argentina, because his father had been hired as a chemical engineer there. René had a happy childhood in Buenos Aires and studied in French-language schools there. He was often the &quot;class clown&quot;, probably to compensate for a natural shyness. He started drawing very early on, inspired by the illustrated stories which he enjoyed reading.

In December 1943, the year after Goscinny graduated from lycée or high school, his father died of a cerebral hemorrhage (stroke). The youth had to go to work. The next year, he got his first job as an assistant accountant in a tyre recovery factory. After being laid off the following year, Goscinny became a junior illustrator in an advertising agency.

Goscinny, along with his mother, emigrated from Argentina and immigrated to New York, United States in 1945 to join her brother, Boris. To avoid service in the United States Armed Forces he travelled to France to join the French Army in 1946. He served at Aubagne in the 141st Alpine Infantry Battalion. Promoted to senior corporal, he became the appointed artist of the regiment and drew illustrations and posters for the army.

==First works==
The following year, Goscinny worked on an illustrated version of the Balzac novella &quot;The Girl with the Golden Eyes&quot;. In April of that year he returned to New York.

There he went through the most difficult period of his life. For a while, Goscinny was jobless, alone, and living in poverty. By 1948, though, he had begun working in a small studio, where he became friends with future &quot;MAD Magazine&quot; contributors Will Elder, Jack Davis, and Harvey Kurtzman. Goscinny became art director at Kunen Publishers, where he wrote four books for children.

Around this time he met two Belgian comic artists, Joseph Gillain, better known as Jijé, and Maurice de Bevere, also known as Morris. Morris lived in the US for six years, having already started his cartoon series &quot;Lucky Luke.&quot; (He and Goscinny collaborated on this, with Goscinny writing it from 1955 until his death in 1977, a period described as its golden age).

Georges Troisfontaines, chief of the World Press agency, convinced Goscinny to return to France in 1951 in order to work for his agency as the head of the Paris office. There he met Albert Uderzo, with whom he started a longtime collaboration. They started out with some work for &quot;Bonnes Soirées&quot;, a women&#x27;s magazine for which Goscinny wrote &quot;Sylvie&quot;. Goscinny and Uderzo also launched the series &quot;Jehan Pistolet&quot; and &quot;Luc Junior,&quot; in the magazine &quot;La Libre Junior&quot;.

In 1955, Goscinny, together with Uderzo, Jean-Michel Charlier, and Jean Hébrad, founded the syndicate Edipress/Edifrance. The syndicate launched publications such as &quot;Clairon&quot; for the factory union and &quot;Pistolin&quot; for a chocolate company. Goscinny and Uderzo cooperated on the series &quot;Bill Blanchart&quot; in &quot;Jeannot&quot;, &quot;Pistolet&quot; in &quot;Pistolin,&quot; and &quot;Benjamin et Benjamine&quot; in the magazine of the same name. Under the pseudonym Agostini, Goscinny wrote &quot;Le Petit Nicolas&quot; for Jean-Jacques Sempé in &quot;Le Moustique.&quot; It was later published in &quot;Sud-Ouest&quot; and &quot;Pilote&quot; magazines.

In 1956, Goscinny began a collaboration with &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. He wrote some short stories for Jo Angenot and Albert Weinberg, and worked on &quot;Signor Spaghetti&quot; with Dino Attanasio, &quot;Monsieur Tric&quot; with Bob de Moor, &quot;Prudence Petitpas&quot; with Maurice Maréchal, &quot;Globul le Martien&quot; and &quot;Alphonse&quot; with Tibet, &quot;Strapontin&quot; with Berck and &quot;Modeste et Pompon&quot; with André Franquin. An early creation with Uderzo, &quot;Oumpah-pah&quot;, was also adapted for serial publication in &quot;Tintin&quot; from 1958 to 1962. In addition, Goscinny appeared in the magazines &quot;Paris-Flirt&quot; (&quot;Lili Manequin&quot; with Will) and &quot;Vaillant&quot; (&quot;Boniface et Anatole&quot; with Jordom, &quot;Pipsi&quot; with Godard).

==&quot;Pilote&quot; and &quot;Astérix&quot; (1959)==
In 1959, the Édifrance/Édipresse syndicate started the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Pilote&quot;. Goscinny became one of the most productive writers for the magazine. In the magazine&#x27;s first issue, he launched &quot;Astérix&quot;, with Uderzo. The series was an instant hit and remains popular worldwide. Goscinny also restarted the series &quot;Le Petit Nicolas&quot; and &quot;Jehan Pistolet&quot;, now called &quot;Jehan Soupolet&quot;. Goscinny also began &quot;Jacquot le Mousse&quot; and &quot;Tromblon et Bottaclou&quot; with Godard.

The magazine was bought by Georges Dargaud in 1960, and Goscinny became editor-in-chief. He also began new series like &quot;Les Divagations de Monsieur Sait-Tout&quot; (with Martial), &quot;La Potachologie Illustrée&quot; (with Cabu), &quot;Les Dingodossiers&quot; (with Gotlib) and &quot;La Forêt de Chênebeau&quot; (with Mic Delinx). With Tabary, he launched &quot;Calife Haroun El Poussah&quot; in &quot;Record&quot;, a series that was later continued in &quot;Pilote&quot; as &quot;Iznogoud&quot;. With Raymond Macherot he created &quot;Pantoufle&quot; for &quot;Spirou&quot;.

==Family==
Goscinny married Gilberte Pollaro-Millo in 1967. In 1968, their daughter Anne Goscinny was born. She also became an author.

Anne Goscinny, the daughter of René Goscinny, co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Little Nicholas: Happy As Can Be&quot;, 2022 animation film with Michel Fessler and Massoubre.

==Death==
Goscinny died at 51, in Paris of a heart attack on 5 November 1977, during a routine stress test at his doctor&#x27;s office. He was buried in the Jewish Cemetery in Nice. In accordance with his will, most of his money was transferred to the chief rabbinate of France.

Goscinny&#x27;s death occurred part-way through the writing of &quot;Asterix in Belgium&quot; (published in 1979, two years after his death). As a homage to Goscinny, Uderzo drew darkened skies and rain into the comic. The last panel on page 32 and all but the last panel on page 33 were drawn with grey skies and rain to mark the point at which Goscinny died. Most of the remaining panels in the book were drawn with leaden grey skies, but none have rain. There is a further tribute at the end of the book: near the lower left corner of the final panel, Uderzo drew a rabbit sadly looking over its shoulders towards Goscinny&#x27;s signature. Regrettably, as printed (at least in the German edition) the outlines are too thick, even at 10X magnification, to make clear what the rabbit is doing.

After Goscinny&#x27;s death, Uderzo began to write &quot;Asterix&quot; himself and continued the series, although at a much slower pace, until passing the series over in 2011 to writer Jean-Yves Ferri and illustrator Didier Conrad. Tabary similarly began to write &quot;Iznogoud&quot; himself, whereas Morris continued &quot;Lucky Luke&quot; with various other writers.

As a further tribute to Goscinny, Uderzo gave his late colleague&#x27;s likeness to the Jewish character Saul ben Ephishul (a play on &quot;it&#x27;s all beneficial&quot;; Saul Nizahle in the German edition; ) in the 1981 album &quot;L&#x27;Odyssée d&#x27;Astérix&quot; (&quot;Asterix and the Black Gold&quot;), which is dedicated to Goscinny&#x27;s memory.

==Awards and honors==
*1974: Adamson Award for best international comic strip artist, Sweden
*2005: Inducted in the Will Eisner Hall of Fame as a Judges&#x27; choice, U.S.

Since 1996, the René Goscinny Award is presented at the yearly Angoulême International Comics Festival in France as an encouragement for young comic writers.

According to UNESCO&#x27;s Index Translationum, Goscinny, as of August 2017, was the 20th most-translated author, with 2,200 translations of his work.

On 23 January 2020, a life-sized bronze statue of Goscinny was unveiled near his former home in Paris. It was the first public statue in Paris dedicated to a comic book author.

==Filmography==
==Studios Idéfix==
Studios Idéfix was an animation studio founded on April 1st, 1974 by Goscinny, Uderzo and Morris.

Its logo, designed by Uderzo, is a parody of MGM&#x27;s logo, with Dogmatix (known in French as Idéfix) instead of Leo and a banner reading &quot;Delirant Isti Romanii&quot;, instead of &quot;Arts Gratia Arts&quot;.

===History===

In the fall of 1973, Goscinny, Uderzo, Morris and their publisher Georges Dargaud joined forces to create their own animation studio, the Idéfix studios. At the time, launching the creation of a cartoon feature film in France was complex, considering that France no longer had a major animation studio ever since the closure in 1952 of Les Gémeaux, ruined by the project of &quot;The Shepherdess and the Chimney Sweep&quot;.

Prior to Idéfix, the works of the founders were animated and adapted to films by Belvision Studios, based at Brussels in Belgium.
As the founders themselves said, 


René Goscinny called Henri Gruel to constitute the technical and artistic teams of the Idéfix studios. The latter directed several animated short films and was responsible for the sound effects of Asterix the Gaul and Asterix and Cleopatra, as well as the two productions by Pierre Tchernia scripted by Goscinny, Le Viager and Les Gaspards. Gruel gets Goscinny to share the artistic direction of the studios with Pierre Watrin, whom he considers to be an excellent designer, one of Paul Grimault&#x27;s best former animators. Over several months, Gruel and Watrin contacted former artists and animators, as well as promising young artists. Most of Paul Grimault&#x27;s former animators then worked in small cartoon structures, and would be interested in the idea of working again in a real studio. However, the search for Pierre Watrin and Henri Gruel ultimately proved difficult, most of the former employees of the Les Gémeaux studios having converted to illustration and advertising. Talent was lacking and, at Goscinny&#x27;s request, Henri Gruel sent his friend Serge Caillet, production director on live-action films, to the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry to demand the opening of a animated cinema section to supply the studios with young artists, who thus offer employment to students as soon as they leave school. Eventually, they managed to produce their first feature film, The Twelve Tasks of Asterix, with Halas and Batchelor and Dargaud.

However, in 1977, during the production of their second (and final) production, Goscinny died of a sudden heart attack. So, after the release of their second feature, The Ballad of the Daltons, a Lucky Luke feature, the studio ceased operations and closed shop permanently.

===Films Produced===
