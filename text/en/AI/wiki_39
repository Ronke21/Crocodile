<text>Magnolia is a large genus of about 210 to 340 flowering plant species in the subfamily Magnolioideae of the family Magnoliaceae. The natural range of &quot;Magnolia&quot; species is disjunct, with a main center in east, south and southeast Asia and a secondary center in eastern North America, Central America, the West Indies, and some species in South America.

&quot;Magnolia&quot; is an ancient genus. Fossilized specimens of &quot;M. acuminata&quot; have been found dating to 20 million years ago (mya), and fossils of plants identifiably belonging to the Magnoliaceae date to 95 mya. They are theorized to have evolved to encourage pollination by beetles as they existed prior to the evolution of bees. Another aspect of &quot;Magnolia&quot; considered to represent an ancestral state is that the flower bud is enclosed in a bract rather than in sepals; the perianth parts are undifferentiated and called tepals rather than distinct sepals and petals. &quot;Magnolia&quot; shares the tepal characteristic with several other flowering plants near the base of the flowering plant lineage, such as &quot;Amborella&quot; and &quot;Nymphaea&quot; (as well as with many more recently derived plants, such as &quot;Lilium).&quot; 

The magnolia was made the state flower of Mississippi in 1900. The magnolia symbolizes stability in the United States, in China, beauty and gentleness.

== Description ==

Magnolias are spreading evergreen or deciduous trees or shrubs characterised by large fragrant flowers, which may be bowl-shaped or star-shaped, in shades of white, pink, purple, green, or yellow. In deciduous species, the blooms often appear before the leaves in spring. Cone-like fruits are often produced in the autumn.

As with all Magnoliaceae, the perianth is undifferentiated, with 9–15 tepals in three or more whorls. The flowers are hermaphroditic, with numerous adnate carpels and stamens arranged in a spiral fashion on the elongated receptacle. The flowers&#x27; carpels are often damaged by pollinating beetles.

The fruit dehisces along the dorsal sutures of the carpels. The pollen is monocolpate, and the embryonic development is of the Polygonum type. Taxonomists, including James E. Dandy in 1927, have used differences in the fruits of Magnoliaceae as the basis for classification systems.

==Taxonomy==

===History===

====Early====


The name &quot;Magnolia&quot; first appeared in 1703 in the &quot;Genera&quot; written by French botanist Charles Plumier, for a flowering tree from the island of Martinique (&quot;talauma&quot;). It was named after French botanist Pierre Magnol. English botanist William Sherard, who studied botany in Paris under Joseph Pitton de Tournefort, a pupil of Magnol, was most probably the first after Plumier to adopt the genus name &quot;Magnolia&quot;. He was at least responsible for the taxonomic part of Johann Jacob Dillenius&#x27;s &quot;Hortus Elthamensis&quot; and of Mark Catesby&#x27;s &quot;Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. These were the first works after Plumier&#x27;s &quot;Genera&quot; that used the name &quot;Magnolia&quot;, this time for some species of flowering trees from temperate North America. The species that Plumier originally named &quot;Magnolia&quot; was later described as &quot;Annona dodecapetala&quot; by Jean-Baptiste Lamarck and has since been named &quot;Magnolia plumieri&quot; and &quot;Talauma plumieri&quot; (among a number of other names), but is now known as &quot;Magnolia dodecapetala&quot;.

Carl Linnaeus, who was familiar with Plumier&#x27;s &quot;Genera&quot;, adopted the genus name &quot;Magnolia&quot; in 1735 in his first edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, without a description but with a reference to Plumier&#x27;s work. In 1753, he took up Plumier&#x27;s &quot;Magnolia&quot; in the first edition of &quot;Species Plantarum&quot;. He described a monotypic genus, with the sole species being &quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;. Since Linnaeus never saw a herbarium specimen (if there ever was one) of Plumier&#x27;s &quot;Magnolia&quot; and had only his description and a rather poor picture at hand, he must have taken it for the same plant that was described by Mark Catesby in his 1730 &quot;Natural History of Carolina&quot;. He placed it in the synonymy of &quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot; var. &quot;fœtida&quot;, the taxon now known as &quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot;. Under &quot;Magnolia virginiana&quot;, Linnaeus described five varieties (&quot;glauca&quot;, &quot;fœtida&quot;, &quot;grisea&quot;, &quot;tripetala&quot;, and &quot;acuminata&quot;). In the tenth edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; (1759), he merged &quot;grisea&quot; with &quot;glauca&quot; and raised the four remaining varieties to species status.

By the end of the 18th century, botanists and plant hunters exploring Asia had begun to name and describe the &quot;Magnolia&quot; species from China and Japan. The first Asiatic species to be described by western botanists were &quot;Magnolia denudata&quot;, &quot;Magnolia liliiflora&quot;, &quot;Magnolia coco,&quot; and &quot;Magnolia figo&quot;. Soon after that, in 1794, Carl Peter Thunberg collected and described &quot;Magnolia obovata&quot; from Japan, and roughly at the same time &quot;Magnolia kobus&quot; was also first collected.

====Recent====
With the number of species increasing, the genus was divided into two subgenera, &quot;Magnolia&quot; and &quot;Yulania&quot;. &quot;Magnolia&quot; contains the American evergreen species &quot;M. grandiflora&quot;, which is of horticultural importance, especially in the southeastern United States, and &quot;M. virginiana&quot;, the type species. &quot;Yulania&quot; contains several deciduous Asiatic species, such as &quot;M. denudata&quot; and &quot;M. kobus&quot;, which have become horticulturally important in their own right and as parents in hybrids. Classified in &quot;Yulania&quot; is also the American deciduous &quot;M. acuminata&quot; (cucumber tree), which has recently attained greater status as the parent responsible for the yellow flower color in many new hybrids.

Relations in the family Magnoliaceae have puzzled taxonomists for a long time. Because the family is quite old and has survived many geological events (such as ice ages, mountain formation, and continental drift), its distribution has become scattered. Some species or groups of species have been isolated for a long time, while others could stay in close contact. To create divisions in the family (or even within the genus &quot;Magnolia&quot;) solely based upon morphological characters has proven to be a nearly impossible task.

By the end of the 20th century, DNA sequencing had become available as a method of large-scale research on phylogenetic relationships. Several studies, including studies on many species in the family Magnoliaceae, were carried out to investigate relationships. What these studies all revealed was that the genus &quot;Michelia&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot; subgenus &quot;Yulania&quot; were far more closely allied to each other than either one of them was to &quot;Magnolia&quot; subgenus &quot;Magnolia&quot;. These phylogenetic studies were supported by morphological data.

As nomenclature is supposed to reflect relationships, the situation with the species names in &quot;Michelia&quot; and &quot;Magnolia&quot; subgenus &quot;Yulania&quot; was undesirable. Taxonomically, three choices are available:

# to join &quot;Michelia&quot; and &quot;Yulania&quot; species in a common genus, not being &quot;Magnolia&quot; (for which the name &quot;Michelia&quot; has priority);
# to raise subgenus &quot;Yulania&quot; to generic rank, leaving &quot;Michelia&quot; names and subgenus &quot;Magnolia&quot; names untouched, or;
# to join &quot;Michelia&quot; with the genus &quot;Magnolia&quot; into the genus &quot;Magnolia&quot; s.l. (a big genus).

&quot;Magnolia&quot; subgenus &quot;Magnolia&quot; cannot be renamed because it contains &quot;M. virginiana&quot;, the type species of the genus and of the family.

Not many &quot;Michelia&quot; species have so far become horticulturally or economically important, apart from their wood. Both subgenus &quot;Magnolia&quot; and subgenus &quot;Yulania&quot; include species of major horticultural importance, and a change of name would be very undesirable for many people, especially in the horticultural branch. In Europe, &quot;Magnolia&quot; is even more or less a synonym for &quot;Yulania&quot;, since most of the cultivated species on this continent have &quot;Magnolia (Yulania) denudata&quot; as one of their parents. Most taxonomists who acknowledge close relations between &quot;Yulania&quot; and &quot;Michelia&quot; therefore support the third option and join &quot;Michelia&quot; with &quot;Magnolia&quot;.

The same goes, &quot;mutatis mutandis&quot;, for the (former) genera &quot;Talauma&quot; and &quot;Dugandiodendron&quot;, which are then placed in subgenus &quot;Magnolia&quot;, and genus &quot;Manglietia&quot;, which could be joined with subgenus &quot;Magnolia&quot; or may even earn the status of an extra subgenus. &quot;Elmerrillia&quot; seems to be closely related to &quot;Michelia&quot; and &quot;Yulania&quot;, in which case it will most likely be treated in the same way as &quot;Michelia&quot; is now. The precise nomenclatural status of small or monospecific genera like &quot;Kmeria&quot;, &quot;Parakmeria&quot;, &quot;Pachylarnax&quot;, &quot;Manglietiastrum&quot;, &quot;Aromadendron&quot;, &quot;Woonyoungia&quot;, &quot;Alcimandra&quot;, &quot;Paramichelia&quot;, and &quot;Tsoongiodendron&quot; remains uncertain. Taxonomists who merge &quot;Michelia&quot; into &quot;Magnolia&quot; tend to merge these small genera into &quot;Magnolia&quot; s.l. as well. Botanists do not agree on whether to recognize a big &quot;Magnolia&quot; or the different small genera. For example, &quot;Flora of China&quot; offers two choices: a large genus &quot;Magnolia&quot;, which includes about 300 species and everything in the Magnoliaceae except &quot;Liriodendron&quot; (tulip tree), or 16 different genera, some of them recently split out or re-recognized, each of which contains up to 50 species. The western co-author favors the big genus &quot;Magnolia&quot;, whereas the Chinese recognize the different small genera.

=== Fossil record ===
Fossils go back to the Late Cretaceous. Post KT fossils of &quot;Magnolia&quot; are known from the Paleogene, for example the species &quot;Magnolia nanningensis,&quot; named for mummified wood from the Oligocene of Guangxi, China, which has a close affinity to members of the modern section &quot;Michelia&quot;.


===Subdivision===

In 2012, the Magnolia Society published on its website a classification of the genus produced by Richard B. Figlar, based on a 2004 classification by Figlar and Hans Peter Nooteboom. Species of &quot;Magnolia&quot; were listed under three subgenera, 12 sections, and 13 subsections. Subsequent molecular phylogenetic studies have led to some revisions of this system; for example, the subgenus &quot;Magnolia&quot; was found not to be monophyletic. A revised classification in 2020, based on a phylogenetic analysis of complete chloroplast genomes, abandoned subgenera and subsections, dividing &quot;Magnolia&quot; into 15 sections. The relationships among these sections are shown in the following cladogram, as is the paraphyletic status of subgenus &quot;Magnolia&quot;.
The table below compares the 2012 and 2020 classifications. (The circumscriptions of the corresponding taxa may not be the same.)

==Uses==


===Horticulture===
In general, the genus &quot;Magnolia&quot; has attracted horticultural interest. Some, such as the shrub &quot;M. stellata&quot; (star magnolia) and the tree &quot;M.&quot; × &quot;soulangeana&quot; (saucer magnolia) flower quite early in the spring, before the leaves open. Others flower in late spring or early summer, including &quot;M. virginiana&quot; (sweetbay magnolia) and &quot;M. grandiflora&quot; (southern magnolia). The shape of these flowers lend themselves to the common name &quot;tulip tree&quot; that is sometimes applied to some &quot;Magnolia&quot; species.

Hybridisation has been immensely successful in combining the best aspects of different species to give plants which flower at an earlier age than the parent species, as well as having more impressive flowers. One of the most popular garden magnolias, &quot;M&quot;. × &quot;soulangeana&quot;, is a hybrid of &quot;M. liliiflora&quot; and &quot;M. denudata&quot;. In the eastern United States, five native species are frequently in cultivation: &quot;M. acuminata&quot; (as a shade tree), &quot;M. grandiflora&quot;, &quot;M. virginiana&quot;, &quot;M. tripetala&quot;, and &quot;M. macrophylla&quot;. The last two species must be planted where high winds are not a frequent problem because of the large size of their leaves.

===Culinary===
The flowers of many species are considered edible. In parts of England, the petals of &quot;M. grandiflora&quot; are pickled and used as a spicy condiment. In some Asian cuisines, the buds are pickled and used to flavor rice and scent tea. In Japan, the young leaves and flower buds of &quot;M. hypoleuca&quot; are broiled and eaten as a vegetable. Older leaves are made into a powder and used as seasoning; dried, whole leaves are placed on a charcoal brazier and filled with miso, leeks, daikon, and shiitake, and broiled. There is a type of miso which is seasoned with magnolia, hoba miso.

===Traditional medicine===
The bark and flower buds of &quot;M. officinalis&quot; have long been used in traditional Chinese medicine, where they are known as &quot;hou po&quot; (厚朴). In Japan, &quot;kōboku&quot;, &quot;M. obovata&quot;, has been used in a similar manner.

===Timber===
The cucumbertree, &quot;M. acuminata&quot;, grows to large size and is harvested as a timber tree in northeastern U.S. forests. Its wood is sold as &quot;yellow poplar&quot; along with that of the tuliptree, &quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;. The Fraser magnolia, &quot;M. fraseri&quot;, also attains enough size sometimes to be harvested, as well.

=== Chemical compounds and bioeffects ===
The aromatic bark contains magnolol, honokiol, 4-O-methylhonokiol, and obovatol. Magnolol and honokiol activate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma.

===Symbols===
* White or Yulan magnolia (subgenus &quot;Yulania&quot;) is the official flower of Shanghai.
* &quot;Magnolia grandiflora&quot; is the state flower of both Mississippi and Louisiana. The flower&#x27;s abundance in Mississippi is reflected in its nickname of &quot;Magnolia State&quot; and the state flag. The magnolia is also the state tree of Mississippi. One of the many nicknames for Houston is &quot;Magnolia City&quot;. Historically, magnolias have been associated with the Southern United States.
* &quot;Magnolia sieboldii&quot; is the national flower of North Korea and the Gangnam District of Seoul.

===Arts===
* The 1989 movie &quot;Steel Magnolias&quot; is based on a 1987 play, Steel Magnolias, by Robert Harling&quot;.&quot; They are about the bond among a group of women from Louisiana, who can be as beautiful as magnolias, but are as tough as steel. The name &#x27;magnolia&#x27; specifically refers to a magnolia tree about which they are arguing at the beginning.
* In the 1939 song &quot;Strange Fruit&quot;, originally written as a poem by New York schoolteacher and communist activist Abel Meeropol to condemn the practice of lynching, the magnolia flower was referred to as being associated with the Southern United States, where many lynchings took place:
:::Pastoral scene of the gallant south
:::The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth
:::&quot;Scent of magnolias, sweet and fresh&quot;,
:::Then the sudden smell of burning flesh.
Despite Meeropol&#x27;s frequent mention of the South and magnolia trees, the horrific image which inspired his poem, Lawrence Beitler&#x27;s 1930 photograph of the lynching of Thomas Shipp and Abram Smith following the robbery and murder of Claude Deteer, was taken in Marion, Indiana, where magnolia trees are less common.
* In the 1960s, magnolias were a symbol of the South in the popular press: the &quot;New York Post&quot; noted of Lyndon Johnson that &quot;A man who wore a ten-gallon Stetson and spoke with a magnolia accent had little hope of winning the Democratic nomination in 1960&quot;, and biographer Robert Caro picks up the symbol by saying that when Johnson became president &quot;[t]he taint of magnolias still remained to be scrubbed off.&quot;

<text>Salzburg is the fourth-largest city in Austria. In 2020 its population was 156,852.

The town occupies the site of the Roman settlement of &quot;Iuvavum&quot;. Founded as an episcopal see in 696, it became a seat of the archbishop in 798. Its main sources of income were salt extraction, trade, as well as gold mining. The fortress of Hohensalzburg, one of the largest medieval fortresses in Europe, dates from the 11th century. In the 17th century, Salzburg became a center of the Counter-Reformation, with monasteries and numerous Baroque churches built.

Salzburg&#x27;s historic center () is renowned for its Baroque architecture and is one of the best-preserved city centers north of the Alps. The historic center was enlisted as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The city has three universities and a large student population.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Salzburg&quot; was first recorded in the late 8th century. It is composed of two parts; the first being &quot;&quot; (German for &quot;salt&quot;) and the second being &quot;-burg&quot; from Proto-West-Germanic: &quot;*burg&quot; conveying the same meaning as and not that of the New High German: ,  &#x27;fortress&#x27;.

==History==
===Antiquity===
The area of the city has been inhabited continuously since the Neolithic Age until the present. In the La Tène period it was an administrative centre of the Celtic Alums in the Kingdom of Noricum.

After the Roman invasion in 15 BC, the various settlements on the Salzburg hills were abandoned, following the construction of the Roman city in the area of the old town. The recently created &quot;Municipium Claudium Iuvavum&quot; was awarded the status of a Roman &quot;municipium&quot; in and has become one of the most important cities of the now Roman province of Noricum.

=== Middle Ages ===
When the province of Noricum collapsed in 488 at the beginning of the migration period, part of the Romano-Celtic population remained in the country. In the 6th century, they came under the rule of the Baiuvarii. The &quot;Life of Saint Rupert&quot; credits the 8th-century saint with the city&#x27;s rebirth, when around , Bishop Rupert of Salzburg received the remains of the Roman town from Duke Theodo II of Bavaria as well as a &quot;castrum superius&quot; (upper castle) on the Nonnberg Terrace as a gift. In return he was to evangelize the east and south-east of the country of Bavaria.

Rupert reconnoitred the river for the site of his basilica and chose &quot;Iuvavum&quot;. He ordained priests and annexed the manor of Piding. Rupert built a church at St. Peter on the site of today&#x27;s cathedral and probably also founded the associated monastery and the Benedictine nunnery on Nonnberg for his relative Erentrude. Salzburg has been the seat of a diocesan bishop since and an archbishopric since . The first cathedral was built under Archbishop Virgil. The Franciscan Church existed since the beginning of the 9th century at the latest. The Marienkirche dates from 1139.
The first use of the German name Salzburg, meaning &quot;Salt-Castle&quot;, can be traced back to when the name was used in Willibald&#x27;s report on the organization of the Bavarian dioceses by Saint Boniface. The name derives from the barges carrying salt on the River Salzach, which were subject to a toll in the 8th century as was customary for many communities and cities on European rivers. Hohensalzburg Fortress, the city&#x27;s fortress was built on the site of a Roman fort in 1077 by Archbishop Gebhard, who made it his residence. It was greatly expanded during the following centuries. This site is not the site of the Roman &quot;castrum superius&quot;, which was located on the Nonnberg nearby.

The state of Salzburg and its counties soon gained more and more influence and power within Bavaria due to the flourishing salt mining and the wide-ranging missionary activities. In 996 Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor rented Archbishop Hartwig the market rights and minting rights (probably also the toll law). The first part of Hohensalzburg Fortress was built in 1077. A city judge was first mentioned in a document in 1120/30. On the left bank of the Salzach, an extensive spiritual district was created with the cathedral, the bishop&#x27;s residence north-west of the cathedral, the cathedral monastery on its south side, St Peter&#x27;s monastery and the Frauengarten (probably after a former women&#x27;s convent that was dissolved in 1583). Only during the 12th century did the civil settlement begin to spread into the Getreidegasse, the Abtsgasse (Sigmund Haffner-Gasse) and along the quay. Around 1280 the first city fortifications were created. The oldest known city law document dates from the year 1287.

===Under the prince-bishopric&#x27;s rule===

Independence from Bavaria was secured in the late 14th century. Salzburg was the seat of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, a prince-bishopric of the Holy Roman Empire. As the Reformation movement gained steam, riots broke out among peasants in the areas in and around Salzburg. The city was occupied during the German Peasants&#x27; War, and the Archbishop had to flee to the safety of the fortress. It was besieged for three months in 1525.

Eventually, tensions were quelled, and the city&#x27;s independence led to an increase in wealth and prosperity, culminating in the late 16th to 18th centuries under the Prince Archbishops Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau, Markus Sittikus, and Paris Lodron. It was in the 17th century that Italian architects (and Austrians who had studied the Baroque style) rebuilt the city center as it is today along with many palaces.

===Modern era===

====Religious conflict====
On 31 October 1731, the 214th anniversary of the 95 Theses, Archbishop Count Leopold Anton von Firmian signed an Edict of Expulsion, the &quot;Emigrationspatent&quot;, directing all Protestant citizens to recant their non-Catholic beliefs. 21,475 citizens refused to recant their beliefs and were expelled from Salzburg. Most of them accepted an offer by King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia, travelling the length and breadth of Germany to their new homes in East Prussia. The rest settled in other Protestant states in Europe and the British colonies in America.

====Illuminism====
In 1772–1803, under archbishop Hieronymus Graf von Colloredo, Salzburg was a center of late Illuminism. Colloredo is known for being one of the main employers of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Colloredo often had arguments with Mozart and he dismissed him by saying, (He should go; I don&#x27;t need him!). Mozart left Salzburg for Vienna in 1781 with his family, although his father Leopold stayed behind, as he had a close relationship with Colloredo.

===Electorate of Salzburg===
In 1803, the archbishopric was secularised by Emperor Napoleon; he transferred the territory to Ferdinando III of Tuscany, former Grand Duke of Tuscany, as the Electorate of Salzburg.

===Austrian and Bavarian rule===
In 1805, Salzburg was annexed to the Austrian Empire, along with the Berchtesgaden Provostry. In 1809, the territory of Salzburg was transferred to the Kingdom of Bavaria after Austria&#x27;s defeat at Wagram. After the Congress of Vienna with the Treaty of Munich (1816), Salzburg was definitively returned to Austria, but without Rupertigau and Berchtesgaden, which remained with Bavaria. Salzburg was integrated into the Province of Salzach and Salzburgerland was ruled from Linz.

In 1850, Salzburg&#x27;s status was restored as the capital of the Duchy of Salzburg, a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The city became part of Austria-Hungary in 1866 as the capital of a crownland of the Austrian Empire. The nostalgia of the Romantic Era led to increased tourism. In 1892, a funicular was installed to facilitate tourism to Hohensalzburg Fortress.
===20th century===

====First Republic====
Following World War I and the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Salzburg, as the capital of one of the Austro-Hungarian territories, became part of the new German Austria. In 1918, it represented the residual German-speaking territories of the Austrian heartlands. This was replaced by the First Austrian Republic in 1919, after the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919).

====Annexation by Nazi Germany====

The Anschluss (the occupation and annexation of Austria, including Salzburg, into Nazi Germany) took place on 12 March 1938, one day before a scheduled referendum on Austria&#x27;s independence. German troops moved into the city. Political opponents, Jewish citizens and other minorities were subsequently arrested and deported to concentration camps. The synagogue was destroyed.

====World War II====
After Germany invaded the Soviet Union, several POW camps for prisoners from the Soviet Union and other enemy nations were arranged in the city.

During the Nazi occupation, a Romani camp was built in Salzburg-Maxglan. It was an Arbeitserziehungslager (work &#x27;education&#x27; camp), which provided slave labor to local industry. It also operated as a Zwischenlager (transit camp), holding Roma before their deportation to German camps or ghettos in German-occupied territories in eastern Europe.

Salzburg was also the location of five subcamps of the Dachau concentration camp.

Allied bombing destroyed 7,600 houses and killed 550 inhabitants. Fifteen air strikes destroyed 46 percent of the city&#x27;s buildings, especially those around Salzburg railway station. Although the town&#x27;s bridges and the dome of the cathedral were destroyed, much of its Baroque architecture remained intact. As a result, Salzburg is one of the few remaining examples of a town of its style. American troops entered the city on 5 May 1945 and it became the centre of the American-occupied area in Austria. Several displaced persons camps were established in Salzburgamong them Riedenburg, Camp Herzl (Franz-Josefs-Kaserne), Camp Mülln, Bet Bialik, Bet Trumpeldor, and New Palestine.

====Today====
After World War II, Salzburg became the capital city of the Federal State of Salzburg (&quot;Land Salzburg&quot;) and saw the Americans leave the area once Austria had signed a 1955 treaty re-establishing the country as a democratic and independent nation and subsequently declared its perpetual neutrality. In the 1960s, the city became the shooting location and setting of the family musical film &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. On 27 January 2006, the 250th anniversary of the birth of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, all 35 churches of Salzburg rang their bells after 8:00 p.m. (local time) to celebrate the occasion. Major celebrations took place throughout the year.

As of 2017 Salzburg had a GDP per capita of €46,100, which was greater than the average for Austria and most European countries.

==Geography==

Salzburg is on the banks of the River Salzach, at the northern boundary of the Alps. The mountains to Salzburg&#x27;s south contrast with the rolling plains to the north. The closest alpine peak, the 1,972‑metre-high Untersberg, is less than from the city center. The &quot;Altstadt&quot;, or &quot;old town&quot;, is dominated by its baroque towers and churches and the massive Hohensalzburg Fortress. This area is flanked by two smaller hills, the Mönchsberg and Kapuzinerberg, which offer green relief within the city. Salzburg is approximately east of Munich, northwest of Ljubljana, Slovenia, and west of Vienna. Salzburg has about the same latitude as Seattle.

Due to its proximity to the Austrian-German border, the greater Salzburg urban area has sometimes (unoffcially) been thought of as if it included contiguous parts of Germany: Freilassing (until 1923 known as Salzburghofen), Ainring and Piding. Public transport planning and multiple public transport lines stretch across the border. 

===Climate===
The Köppen climate classification specifies Salzburg&#x27;s climate as a warm-summer humid continental climate (&quot;Dfb&quot;). However, with the isotherm for the coldest month, Salzburg can be classified as having a four-season oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) with significant temperature differences between seasons. Due to the location at the northern rim of the Alps, the amount of precipitation is comparatively high, mainly in the summer months. The specific drizzle is called &quot;Schnürlregen&quot; in the local dialect. In winter and spring, pronounced foehn winds regularly occur.


==Demography==
=== History ===
Salzburg&#x27;s official population significantly increased in 1935 when the city absorbed adjacent municipalities. After World War II, numerous refugees found a new home in the city. New residential space was constructed for American soldiers of the postwar occupation and could be used for refugees when they left. Around 1950, Salzburg passed the mark of 100,000 citizens, and in 2016, it reached the mark of 150,000 citizens.

=== Migrant communities ===
Salzburg is home to large German, Bosnian, Serbian, and Romanian communities.

==Architecture==

===Romanesque and Gothic===
The Romanesque and Gothic churches, the monasteries and the early carcass houses dominated the medieval city for a long time. The Cathedral of Archbishop Conrad of Wittelsbach was the largest basilica north of the Alps. The choir of the Franciscan Church, construction was begun by Hans von Burghausen and completed by , is one of the most prestigious religious gothic constructions of southern Germany. At the end of the Gothic era Nonnberg Abbey, the Margaret Chapel in St Peter&#x27;s Abbey, St George&#x27;s Chapel, and the stately halls of the &quot;Hoher Stock&quot; in Hohensalzburg Fortress were constructed.

===Renaissance and baroque===
Inspired by Vincenzo Scamozzi, Prince-Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau began to transform the medieval town to the architectural ideals of the late Renaissance. Plans for a massive cathedral by Scamozzi failed to materialize upon the fall of the archbishop. A second cathedral planned by Santino Solari rose as the first early Baroque church in Salzburg. It served as an example for many other churches in Southern Germany and Austria. and continued to rebuild the city with major projects such as Hellbrunn Palace, the prince archbishop&#x27;s residence, the university buildings, fortifications, and many other buildings. Giovanni Antonio Daria managed by order of Prince Archbishop Guido von Thun the construction of the residential well. Giovanni , by order of the same archbishop, created the Erhard and the Kajetan church in the south of the town. The city&#x27;s redesign was completed with buildings designed by Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, donated by Prince Archbishop Johann Ernst von Thun.

After the era of Ernst von Thun, the city&#x27;s expansion came to a halt, which is the reason why there are no churches built in the Rococo style. Sigismund von Schrattenbach continued with the construction of &quot;Sigmundstor&quot; and the statue of holy Maria on the cathedral square. With the fall and division of the former &quot;Fürsterzbistum Salzburg&quot; (Archbishopric) to Upper Austria, Bavaria (Rupertigau) and Tyrol (Zillertal Matrei) began a long period of urban stagnancy. This era didn&#x27;t end before the period of promoterism (&quot;Gründerzeit&quot;) brought new life into urban development. The builder dynasty and filled major positions in shaping the city in this era.

===Classical modernism and post-war modernism===

Buildings of classical modernism and in particular, post-war modernism is frequently encountered in Salzburg. Examples are the Zahnwurzen house (a house in the Linzergasse 22 in the right center of the old town), the &quot;Lepi&quot; (public baths in &quot;Leopoldskron&quot;) (built 1964), and the original 1957 constructed congress-center of Salzburg, which was replaced by a new building in 2001. An important and famous example of the architecture of this era is the 1960 opening of the Großes Festspielhaus by Clemens Holzmeister.

===Contemporary architecture===
Adding contemporary architecture to Salzburg&#x27;s old town without risking its UNESCO World Heritage status is problematic. Nevertheless, some new structures have been added: the Mozarteum at the Baroque Mirabell Garden (Architecture Robert Rechenauer), the 2001 Congress House (Architecture: Freemasons), the 2011 Unipark Nonntal (Architecture: Storch Ehlers Partners), the 2001 &quot;Makartsteg&quot; bridge (Architecture: HALLE1), and the &quot;Residential and Studio House&quot; of the architects and in the middle of Salzburg&#x27;s old town (winner of the ). Other examples of contemporary architecture lie outside the old town: the Faculty of Science building (Universität Salzburg – Architecture ) built on the edge of free green space, the blob architecture of Red Bull Hangar-7 (Architecture: Volkmar Burgstaller) at Salzburg Airport, home to Dietrich Mateschitz&#x27;s Flying Bulls and the Europark Shopping Centre. (Architecture: Massimiliano Fuksas)

==Popular culture==
In the 1960s, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, based on the true story of Maria von Trapp, who took up with an aristocratic family and fled the German Anschluss, used locations in Salzburg and Salzburg State as filming location.

The city briefly appears on the map when Indiana Jones travels through the city in the 1989 film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;.

==Language==
Austrian German is widely written and differs from Germany&#x27;s standard variation only in some vocabulary and a few grammar points. Salzburg belongs to the region of Austro-Bavarian dialects, in particular Central Bavarian. It is widely spoken by young and old alike although professors of linguistics from the Universität Salzburg, Irmgard Kaiser, and Hannes Scheutz, have seen over the past few years a reduction in the number of dialect speakers in the city. Although more and more school children are speaking standard German, Scheutz feels it has less to do with parental influence and more to do with media consumption.

==Sports==

===Football===

The former SV Austria Salzburg reached the UEFA Cup final in 1994. On 6 April 2005 Red Bull bought the club and changed its name to FC Red Bull Salzburg. The home stadium of Red Bull Salzburg is the Wals Siezenheim Stadium in a suburb in the agglomeration of Salzburg and was one of the venues for the 2008 European Football Championship. FC Red Bull Salzburg plays in the Austrian Bundesliga.

After Red Bull had bought the SV Austria Salzburg and changed its name and team colors, some supporters of the club decided to leave and form a new club with the old name and old colors, wanting to preserve the traditions of their club. The reformed SV Austria Salzburg was founded in 2005 and at one point played in the Erste Liga, only one tier below the Bundesliga. However, in recent years they have struggled to climb back up to the Austrian second tier and since 2019 they compete in the Regionalliga Salzburg in the Austrian Football third tier.

===Ice-hockey===
Red Bull also sponsors the local ice hockey team, the EC Salzburg Red Bulls. The team plays in the Erste Bank Eishockey Liga, an Austria-headquartered cross-border league featuring the best teams from Austria, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, and Italy, as well as one Czech team.

<text>Rhododendron (; : rhododendra) is a very large genus of about 1,024 species of woody plants and in the heath family (Ericaceae). They can be either evergreen or deciduous. Most species are native to eastern Asia and the Himalayan region, but smaller numbers occur elsewhere in Asia, and in North America, Europe and Australia.

It is the national flower of Nepal, the state flower of Washington and West Virginia in the United States, the state flower of Nagaland and Himachal Pradesh in India, the provincial flower of Jeju Province in South Korea, the provincial flower of Jiangxi in China and the state tree of Sikkim and Uttarakhand in India. Most species have brightly colored flowers which bloom from late winter through to early summer.

Azaleas make up two subgenera of &quot;Rhododendron&quot;. They are distinguished from &quot;true&quot; rhododendrons by having only five anthers per flower.

== Etymology ==
The common and generic name comes .

== Description ==

&quot;Rhododendron&quot; is a genus of shrubs and small to (rarely) large trees, the smallest species growing to tall, and the largest, &quot;R. protistum&quot; var. &quot;giganteum&quot;, reported to tall. The leaves are spirally arranged; leaf size can range from to over , exceptionally in &quot;R. sinogrande&quot;. They may be either evergreen or deciduous. In some species, the undersides of the leaves are covered with scales (lepidote) or hairs (indumentum). Some of the best known species are noted for their many clusters of large flowers. A recently discovered species in New Guinea has flowers up to six inches (fifteen centimeters) in width, the largest in the whole genus. The accompanying photograph shows it as having seven petals. There are alpine species with small flowers and small leaves, and tropical species such as section &quot;Vireya&quot; that often grow as epiphytes. Species in this genus may be part of the heath complex in oak-heath forests in eastern North America.

They have frequently been divided based on the presence or absence of scales on the abaxial (lower) leaf surface (lepidote or elepidote). These scales, unique to subgenus &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, are modified hairs consisting of a polygonal scale attached by a stalk.

&quot;Rhododendron&quot; are characterised by having inflorescences with scarious (dry) perulae, a chromosome number of x=13, fruit that has a septicidal capsule, an ovary that is superior (or nearly so), stamens that have no appendages, and agglutinate (clumped) pollen.

== Taxonomy ==



&quot;Rhododendron&quot; is the largest genus in the family Ericaceae, with over 1,000 species, (though estimates vary from 850 to 1,200) and is morphologically diverse. Consequently, the taxonomy has been historically complex.

=== Early history ===
Although Rhododendrons had been known since the description of &quot;Rhododendron hirsutum&quot; by Charles de l&#x27;Écluse (Clusius) in the sixteenth century, and were known to classical writers (Magor 1990), and referred to as &quot;Chamaerhododendron&quot; (low-growing rose tree), the genus was first formally described by Linnaeus in his &quot;Species Plantarum&quot; in 1753. He listed five species under &quot;Rhododendron&quot;: &quot;R.&quot; &quot;ferrugineum&quot; (the type species), &quot;R. dauricum&quot;, &quot;R. hirsutum&quot;, &quot;R. chamaecistus&quot; (now &quot;Rhodothamnus chamaecistus&quot; (L.) Rchb.) and &quot;R. maximum&quot;. At that time he considered the then known six species of &quot;Azalea&quot; that he had described earlier in 1735 in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as a separate genus.

Linnaeus&#x27; six species of &quot;Azalea&quot; were &quot;Azalea indica&quot;, &quot;A. pontica&quot;, &quot;A. lutea&quot;, &quot;A. viscosa&quot;, &quot;A. lapponica&quot; and &quot;A. procumbens&quot; (now &quot;Kalmia procumbens&quot;), which he distinguished from &quot;Rhododendron&quot; by having five stamens, as opposed to ten. As new species of what are now considered &quot;Rhododendron&quot; were discovered, they were assigned to separate genera if they seemed to differ significantly from the type species. For instance &quot;Rhodora&quot; (Linnaeus 1763) for &quot;Rhododendron canadense&quot;, &quot;Vireya&quot; (Blume 1826) and &quot;Hymenanthes&quot; (Blume 1826) for &quot;Rhododendron metternichii&quot;, now R. degronianum. Meanwhile, other botanists such as Salisbury (1796) and Tate (1831) began to question the distinction between &quot;Azalea&quot; and &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, and finally in 1836, &quot;Azalea&quot; was incorporated into &quot;Rhododendron&quot; and the genus divided into eight sections. Of these &quot;Tsutsutsi&quot; (&quot;Tsutsusi&quot;), &quot;Pentanthera&quot;, &quot;Pogonanthum&quot;, &quot;Ponticum&quot; and &quot;Rhodora&quot; are still used, the other sections being &quot;Lepipherum&quot;, &quot;Booram&quot;, and &quot;Chamaecistus&quot;. This structure largely survived till recently (2004), following which the development of molecular phylogeny led to major of traditional morphological classifications, although other authors such as Candolle, who described six sections, used slightly different numeration.

Soon, as more species became available in the nineteenth century so did a better understanding of the characteristics necessary for the major divisions. Chief amongst these were Maximovicz&#x27;s &quot;Rhododendreae Asiae Orientali&quot; and Planchon. Maximovicz used flower bud position and its relationship with leaf buds to create eight &quot;Sections&quot;. Bentham and Hooker used a similar scheme, but called the divisions &quot;Series&quot;. It was not until 1893 that Koehne appreciated the significance of scaling and hence the separation of lepidote and elepidote species. The large number of species that were available by the early twentieth century prompted a new approach when Balfour introduced the concept of grouping species into series. &quot;The Species of Rhododendron&quot; referred to this series concept as the Balfourian system. That system continued up to modern times in Davidian&#x27;s four volume &quot;The Rhododendron Species&quot;.

=== Modern classification ===
The next major attempt at classification was by Sleumer who from 1934 began incorporating the Balfourian series into the older hierarchical structure of subgenera and sections, according to the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature, culminating in 1949 with his &quot;Ein System der Gattung &quot;Rhododendron&quot;&quot; and subsequent refinements. Most of the Balfourian series are represented by Sleumer as subsections, though some appear as sections or even subgenera. Sleumer based his system on the relationship of the flower buds to the leaf buds, habitat, flower structure, and whether the leaves were lepidote or non-lepidote. While Sleumer&#x27;s work was widely accepted, many in the United States and the United Kingdom continued to use the simpler Balfourian system of the Edinburgh group.

Sleumer&#x27;s system underwent many revisions by others, predominantly the Edinburgh group in their continuing Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh notes. Cullen of the Edinburgh group, placing more emphasis on the lepidote characteristics of the leaves, united all of the lepidote species into subgenus &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, including four of Sleumer&#x27;s subgenera (&quot;Rhododendron&quot;, &quot;Pseudoazalea&quot;, &quot;Pseudorhodorastrum&quot;, &quot;Rhodorastrum&quot;). In 1986 Philipson &amp; Philipson raised two sections of subgenus &quot;Aleastrum&quot; (&quot;Mumeazalea&quot;, &quot;Candidastrum&quot;) to subgenera, while reducing genus &quot;Therorhodion&quot; to a subgenus of &quot;Rhododendron&quot;. In 1987 Spethmann, adding phytochemical features proposed a system with fifteen subgenera grouped into three &#x27;chorus&#x27; subgenera.

A number of closely related genera had been included together with &quot;Rhododendron&quot; in a former tribe, Rhodoreae. These have been progressively incorporated into &quot;Rhododendron&quot;. Chamberlain and Rae moved the monotypic section &quot;Tsusiopsis&quot; together with the monotypic genus &quot;Tsusiophyllum&quot; into section &quot;Tsutsusi&quot;, while Kron &amp; Judd reduced genus &quot;Ledum&quot; to a subsection of section &quot;Rhododendron&quot;. Then Judd &amp; Kron moved two species (&quot;R.&quot; &quot;schlippenbachii&quot; and &quot;R.&quot; &quot;quinquefolium&quot;) from section &quot;Brachybachii&quot;, subgenus &quot;Tsutsusi&quot; and two from section &quot;Rhodora&quot;, subgenus &quot;Pentanthera&quot; (&quot;R. albrechtii&quot;, &quot;R. pentaphyllum&quot;) into section &quot;Sciadorhodion&quot;, subgenus &quot;Pentanthera&quot;. Finally Chamberlain brought the various systems together in 1996, with 1,025 species divided into eight subgenera. Goetsch (2005) provides a comparison of the Sleumer and Chamberlain schemata (Table 1).

===Phylogeny===

The era of molecular analysis rather than descriptive features can be dated to the work of Kurashige (1988) and Kron (1997) who used matK sequencing. Later Gao &quot;et al.&quot; (2002) used ITS sequences to determine a cladistic analysis. They confirmed that the genus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; was monophyletic, with subgenus &quot;Therorhodion&quot; in the basal position, consistent with the matK studies. Following publication of the studies of Goetsch &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) with RPB2, there began an ongoing realignment of species and groups within the genus, based on evolutionary relationships. Their work was more supportive of Sleumer&#x27;s original system than the later modifications introduced by Chamberlain &quot;et al.&quot;.

The major finding of Goetsch and colleagues was that all species examined (except &quot;R. camtschaticum&quot;, subgenus &quot;Therorhodion&quot;) formed three major clades which they labelled &#x27;, &#x27;, and &#x27;, with the subgenera &quot;Rhododendron&quot; and &quot;Hymenanthes&quot; as monophyletic groups nested within clades &#x27; and &#x27;, respectively. By contrast subgenera &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; and &quot;Pentanthera&quot; were polyphyletic, while &quot;R. camtschaticum&quot; appeared as a sister to all other rhododendrons. The small polyphyletic subgenera &quot;Pentanthera&quot; and &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; were divided between two clades. The four sections of &quot;Pentanthera&quot; between clades &#x27; and &#x27;, with two each, while &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; had one section in each of &#x27; and .

Thus subgenera &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; and &quot;Pentanthera&quot; needed to be disassembled, and &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, &quot;Hymenanthes&quot; and &quot;Tsutsusi&quot; correspondingly expanded. In addition to the two separate genera included under &quot;Rhododendron&quot; by Chamberlain (&quot;Ledum&quot;, &quot;Tsusiophyllum&quot;), Goetsch &quot;et al.&quot;. added &quot;Menziesia&quot; (clade ). Despite a degree of paraphyly, the subgenus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; was otherwise untouched with regard to its three sections but four other subgenera were eliminated and one new subgenus created, leaving a total of five subgenera in all, from eight in Chamberlain&#x27;s scheme. The discontinued subgenera are &quot;Pentanthera&quot;, &quot;Tsutsusi&quot;, &quot;Candidastrum&quot; and &quot;Mumeazalea&quot;, while a new subgenus was created by elevating subgenus &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; section &quot;Choniastrum&quot; to subgenus rank.

Subgenus &quot;Pentanthera&quot; (deciduous azaleas) with its four sections was dismembered by eliminating two sections and redistributing the other two between the existing subgenera in clades &#x27; (&quot;Hymenanthes&quot;) and &#x27; (&quot;Azaleastrum&quot;), although the name was retained in section &quot;Pentanthera&quot; (14 species) which was moved to subgenus &quot;Hymenanthes&quot;. Of the remaining three sections, monotypic &quot;Viscidula&quot; was discontinued by moving &quot;R.&quot; &quot;nipponicum&quot; to &quot;Tsutsusi&quot; (&#x27;), while &quot;Rhodora&quot; (2 species) was itself polyphyletic and was broken up by moving &quot;R.&quot; &quot;canadense&quot; to section &quot;Pentanthera&quot; (&#x27;) and &quot;R.&quot; &quot;vaseyi&quot; to section &quot;Sciadorhodion&quot;, which then became a new section of subgenus &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; ().

Subgenus &quot;Tsutsusi&quot; (&#x27;) was reduced to section status retaining the name, and included in subgenus &quot;Azaleastrum&quot;. Of the three minor subgenera, all in &#x27;, two were discontinued. The single species of monotypic subgenus &quot;Candidastrum&quot; (&quot;R.&quot; &quot;albiflorum&quot;) was moved to subgenus &quot;Azaleastrum&quot;, section &quot;Sciadorhodion&quot;. Similarly the single species in monotypic subgenus &quot;Mumeazalea&quot; (&quot;R.&quot; &quot;semibarbatum&quot;) was placed in the new section &quot;Tsutsusi&quot;, subgenus &quot;Azaleastrum&quot;. Genus &quot;Menziesa&quot; (9 species) was also added to section &quot;Sciadorhodion&quot;. The remaining small subgenus &quot;Therorhodion&quot; with its two species was left intact. Thus two subgenera, &quot;Hymenanthes&quot; and &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; were expanded at the expense of four subgenera that were eliminated, although &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; lost one section (&quot;Choniastrum&quot;) as a new subgenus, since it was a distinct subclade in . In all, &quot;Hymenanthes&quot; increased from one to two sections, while &quot;Azaleastrum&quot;, by losing one section and gaining two increased from two to three sections. (See schemata under &quot;Subgenera&quot;.)

Subsequent research has supported the revision by Goetsch, although has largely concentrated on further defining the phylogeny within the subdivisions. In 2011 the two species of &quot;Diplarche&quot; were also added to &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, &quot;incertae sedis&quot;.

===Subdivision===
This genus has been progressively subdivided into a hierarchy of subgenus, section, subsection, and species.

====Subgenera====
Terminology from the Sleumer (1949) system is frequently found in older literature, with five subgenera and is as follows;
* Subgenus &quot;Lepidorrhodium&quot; Koehne: Lepidotes. 3 sections
* Subgenus &quot;Eurhododendron&quot; Maxim.: Elipidotes. 
* Subgenus &quot;Pseudanthodendron&quot; Sleumer: Deciduous azaleas. 3 sections
* Subgenus &quot;Anthodendron&quot; Rehder &amp; Wilson: Evergreen azaleas. 3 sections
* Subgenus &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; Planch.: 4 sections

In the later traditional classification, attributed to Chamberlain (1996), and as used by horticulturalists and the American Rhododendron Society, &quot;Rhododendron&quot; has eight subgenera based on morphology, namely the presence of scales (lepidote), deciduousness of leaves, and the floral and vegetative branching patterns, after Sleumer (1980). These consist of four large and four small subgenera. The first two subgenera (&quot;Rhododendron&quot; and &quot;Hymenanthes&quot;) represent the species commonly considered as &#x27;Rhododendrons&#x27;. The next two smaller subgenera (&quot;Pentanthera&quot; and &quot;Tsutsusi&quot;) represent the &#x27;Azaleas&#x27;. The remaining four subgenera contain very few species. The largest of these is subgenus &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, containing nearly half of all known species and all of the lepidote species.

*Subgenus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; : Small leaf or lepidotes (scales on the underside of the leaves). 3 sections, 462 species, type species: &quot;R. ferrugineum&quot;.
*Subgenus &quot;Hymenanthes&quot; : Large leaf or elepidotes (without scales). 1 section, 224 species, type &quot;R.&quot; &quot;degronianum&quot;.
*Subgenus &quot;Pentanthera&quot; : Deciduous azaleas. 4 sections, 23 species, type &quot;R.&quot; &quot;luteum&quot;.
*Subgenus &quot;Tsutsusi&quot; : Evergreen azaleas. 2 sections, 80 species, type &quot;R.&quot; &quot;indicum&quot;.
*Subgenus &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; : 2 sections, 16 species, type &quot;R. ovatum&quot;.
*Subgenus &quot;Candidastrum&quot; : 1 species, &quot;R. albiflorum&quot;.
*Subgenus &quot;Mumeazalea&quot; : 1 species, &quot;Rhododendron semibarbatum&quot;.
*Subgenus &quot;Therorhodion&quot; : 2 species (&quot;Rhododendron camtschaticum&quot;, &quot;Rhododendron redowskianun&quot;).

For a comparison of the Sleumer and Chamberlain systems, see Goetsch &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) Table 1.

This division was based on a number of what were thought to be key morphological characteristics. These included the position of the inflorescence buds (terminal or lateral), whether lepidote or elepidote, deciduousness of leaves, and whether new foliage was derived from axils from previous year&#x27;s shoots or the lowest scaly leaves.



Following the cladistic analysis of Goetsch &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) this scheme was simplified, based on the discovery of three major clades (A, B, C) as follows.

Clade A
* Subgenus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; : Small leaf or lepidotes (scales on the underside of the leaves). 3 sections, about 400 species, type species: &quot;R.&quot; &quot;ferrugineum&quot;.
* Subgenus &quot;Choniastrum&quot; : 11 species
Clade B
* Subgenus &quot;Hymenanthes&quot; : Large leaf or elepidotes (without scales), including deciduous azaleas. 2 sections, about 140–225 species, type &quot;R. degronianum&quot;.
Clade C
* Subgenus &quot;Azaleastrum&quot; : Evergreen azaleas. 3 sections, about 120 species, type &quot;Rhododendron ovatum&quot;.
Sister taxon
* Subgenus &quot;Therorhodion&quot; : 2 species (&quot;R. camtschaticum&quot; and &quot;R. redowskianun&quot;).

==== Sections and subsections ====
The larger subgenera are further subdivided into sections and subsections Some subgenera contain only a single section, and some sections only a single subsection. Shown here is the traditional classification, with species number after Chamberlain (1996), but this scheme is undergoing constant revision. Revisions by Goetsch &quot;et al.&quot; (2005) and by Craven &quot;et al.&quot; (2008) shown in (&quot;parenthetical italics&quot;). Older ranks such as Series (groups of species) are no longer used but may be found in the literature, but the American Rhododendron Society still uses a similar device, called Alliances

=== Species ===
== Distribution and habitat ==

Species of the genus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; are widely distributed between latitudes 80°N and 20°S and are native to areas from North America to Europe, Russia, and Asia, and from Greenland to Queensland, Australia and the Solomon Islands. The centres of diversity are in the Himalayas and Maritime Southeast Asia, with the greatest species diversity in the Sino-Himalayan region, Southwest China and northern Burma, from India – Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Nagaland to Nepal, northwestern Yunnan and western Sichuan and southeastern Tibet. Other significant areas of diversity are in the mountains of Korea, Japan and Taiwan. More than 90% of &quot;Rhododendron&quot; &quot;sensu&quot; Chamberlain belong to the Asian subgenera &quot;Rhododendron&quot;, &quot;Hymenanthes&quot; and section &quot;Tsutsusi&quot;. Of the first two of these, the species are predominantly found in the area of the Himalayas and Southwest China (Sino-Himalayan Region).

The 300 tropical species within the &quot;Vireya&quot; section of subgenus &quot;Rhododendron&quot; occupy the Maritime Southeast Asia from their presumed Southeast Asian origin to Northern Australia, with 55 known species in Borneo and 164 in New Guinea. The species in New Guinea are native to subalpine moist grasslands at around 3,000 metres above sea level in the Central Highlands. Subgenera &quot;Rhododendron&quot; and &quot;Hymenanthes&quot;, together with section &quot;Pentanthera&quot; of subgenus &quot;Pentanthera&quot; are also represented to a lesser degree in the Mountainous areas of North America and Western Eurasia. Subgenus &quot;Tsutsusi&quot; is found in the maritime regions of East Asia (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, East China), but not in North America or Eurasia.

In the United States, native &quot;Rhododendron&quot; mostly occur in lowland and montane forests in the Pacific Northwest, California, the Northeast, and the Appalachian Mountains.

==Ecology==
===Invasive species===
&quot;Rhododendron ponticum&quot; has become invasive in Ireland and the United Kingdom. It is an introduced species, spreading in woodland areas and replacing the natural understory. &quot;R. ponticum&quot; is difficult to eradicate, as its roots can make new shoots.

===Insects===
A number of insects either target rhododendrons or will opportunistically attack them. Rhododendron borers and various weevils are major pests of rhododendrons, and many caterpillars will preferentially devour them.

&quot;Rhododendron&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae (caterpillars) of some butterflies and moths; see List of Lepidoptera that feed on rhododendrons.

===Diseases===

Major diseases include &quot;Phytophthora&quot; root rot, stem and twig fungal dieback.

Rhododendron bud blast, a fungal condition that causes buds to turn brown and dry before they can open, is caused by the fungus &quot;Pycnostysanus azaleae&quot;, which may be brought to the plant by the rhododendron leafhopper, &quot;Graphocephala fennahi&quot;.

== Conservation ==
In the UK the forerunner of the Rhododendron, Camellia and Magnolia Group (RCMG), The Rhododendron Society was founded in 1916. while in Scotland species are being conserved by the Rhododendron Species Conservation Group.

== Cultivation ==

Both species and hybrid rhododendrons (including azaleas) are used extensively as ornamental plants in landscaping in many parts of the world, including both temperate and regions. Many species and cultivars are grown commercially for the nursery trade.

Rhododendrons can be propagated by air layering or stem cuttings. They can self-propagate by sending up shoots from the roots. Sometimes an attached branch that has drooped to the ground will root in damp mulch, and the resulting rooted plant then can be cut off the parent rhododendron. They can also be reprodcued by seed dispersal - or by horticulturalists collecting the spent flower buds and saving ad drying the seed for later germination and planting.
Rhododendrons are often valued in landscaping for their structure, size, flowers, and the fact that many of them are evergreen. Azaleas are frequently used around foundations and occasionally as hedges, and many larger-leafed rhododendrons lend themselves well to more informal plantings and woodland gardens, or as specimen plants. In some areas, larger rhododendrons can be pruned to encourage more tree-like form, with some species such as &quot;Rhododendron arboreum&quot; and &quot;R. falconeri&quot; eventually growing to a height of or more.

===Commercial growing===
Rhododendrons are grown commercially in many areas for sale, and seeds were occasionally collected in the wild, a practice now rare in most areas due to the Nagoya Protocol. Larger commercial growers often ship long distances; in the United States, most of them are on the west coast (Oregon, Washington state and California). Large-scale commercial growing often selects for different characteristics than hobbyist growers might want, such as resistance to root rot when overwatered, ability to be forced into budding early, ease of rooting or other propagation, and saleability.

===Horticultural divisions===
Horticulturally, rhododendrons may be divided into the following groups:
* Evergreen rhododendrons - large group of evergreen shrubs that vary greatly in size. Most rhododendron flowers are bell-shaped and have 10 stamens.
* Vireya (Malesian) rhododendrons: epiphytic tender shrubs
* Azaleas – group of shrubs which have smaller and thinner leaves than evergreen rhododendrons. They are generally medium-sized shrubs with smaller funnel-shaped flowers that usually have 5 stamens:
** Deciduous hybrid azaleas:
*** Exbury hybrids – derived from the Knap Hill hybrids, developed by Lionel de Rothschild at the Exbury Estate in England.
*** Ghent (Gandavense) hybrids – Belgian raised
*** Knap Hill hybrids – developed by Anthony Waterer at the Knap Hill Nursery in England.
*** Mollis hybrids – Dutch and Belgian raised
*** New Zealand Ilam hybrids – derived from Knap Hill/Exbury hybrids
*** Occidentale hybrids – English raised
*** Rustica Flore Pleno hybrids – sweet-scented, double-flowered
** Evergreen hybrid azaleas:
*** Gable hybrids – raised by Joseph B. Gable in Pennsylvania.
*** Glenn Dale hybrids – US raised complex hybrids
*** Indian (Indica) hybrids – mostly of Belgian origin
*** Kaempferi hybrids – Dutch raised
*** Kurume hybrids – Japanese raised
*** Kyushu hybrids – very hardy Japanese azaleas (to −30 °C)
*** Oldhamii hybrids – dwarf hybrids raised at Exbury, England
*** Satsuki hybrids – Japanese raised, originally for bonsai
*** Shammarello hybrids – raised in northern Ohio
*** Vuyk (Vuykiana) hybrids – raised in the Netherlands
* Azaleodendrons – semi-evergreen hybrids between deciduous azaleas and rhododendrons

===Planting and care===

Like other ericaceous plants, most rhododendrons prefer acid soils with a pH of roughly 4.5–5.5; some tropical Vireyas and a few other rhododendron species grow as epiphytes and require a planting mix similar to orchids. Rhododendrons have fibrous roots and prefer well-drained soils high in organic material. In areas with poorly drained or alkaline soils, rhododendrons are often grown in raised beds using media such as composted pine bark. Mulching and careful watering are important, especially before the plant is established.

A new calcium-tolerant stock of rhododendrons (trademarked as &#x27;Inkarho&#x27;) has been exhibited at the RHS Chelsea Flower Show in London (2011). Individual hybrids of rhododendrons have been grafted on to a rootstock on a single rhododendron plant that was found growing in a chalk quarry. The rootstock is able to grow in calcium-rich soil up to a pH of 7.5.

===Hybrids===
Rhododendrons are extensively hybridized in cultivation, and natural hybrids often occur in areas where species ranges overlap. There are over 28,000 cultivars of Rhododendron in the International Rhododendron Registry held by the Royal Horticultural Society. Most have been bred for their flowers, but a few are of garden interest because of ornamental leaves and some for ornamental bark or stems. Some hybrids have fragrant flowers—such as the Loderi hybrids, created by crossing &quot;Rhododendron fortunei&quot; and &quot;R. griffithianum&quot;. Other examples include the PJM hybrids, formed from a cross between &quot;Rhododendron carolinianum&quot; and &quot;R. dauricum&quot;, and named after Peter J. Mezitt of Weston Nurseries, Massachusetts.

== Toxicity ==
Some species of rhododendron are poisonous to grazing animals because of a toxin called grayanotoxin in their pollen and nectar. People have been known to become ill from eating mad honey made by bees feeding on rhododendron and azalea flowers. Xenophon described the odd behaviour of Greek soldiers after having consumed honey in a village surrounded by &quot;Rhododendron ponticum&quot; during the march of the Ten Thousand in 401 BCE. Pompey&#x27;s soldiers reportedly suffered lethal casualties following the consumption of honey made from &quot;Rhododendron&quot; deliberately left behind by Pontic forces in 67 BCE during the Third Mithridatic War. Later, it was recognized that honey resulting from these plants has a slightly hallucinogenic and laxative effect. The suspect rhododendrons are &quot;Rhododendron ponticum&quot; and &quot;Rhododendron luteum&quot; (formerly &quot;Azalea pontica&quot;), both found in northern Asia Minor. Eleven similar cases during the 1980s have been documented in Istanbul, Turkey. Rhododendron is extremely toxic to horses, with some animals dying within a few hours of ingesting the plant, although most horses tend to avoid it if they have access to good forage. Rhododendron, including its stems, leaves and flowers, contains toxins that, if ingested by a cat&#x27;s stomach, can cause seizures and even coma and death.

==Uses==
&quot;Rhododendron&quot; species have long been used in traditional medicine. Animal studies and &quot;in vitro&quot; research have identified possible anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective activities which may be due to the antioxidant effects of flavonoids or other phenolic compounds and saponins the plant contains. Xiong &quot;et al.&quot; have found that the root of the plant is able to reduce the activity of NF-κB in rats.

In Nepal, the flower is considered edible and enjoyed for its sour taste. The pickled flower can last for months and the flower juice is also marketed. The flower, fresh or dried, is added to fish curry in the belief that it will soften the bones. The juice of rhododendron flower is used to make a squash called burans (named after the flower) in the hilly regions of Uttarakhand. It is admired for its distinctive flavor and color.

=== Labrador tea ===
The herbal tea called Labrador tea (not a true tea) is made from one of three closely related species: 
* &quot;Rhododendron tomentosum&quot; (Northern Labrador tea, previously &quot;Ledum palustre&quot;)
* &quot;Rhododendron groenlandicum&quot;, (Bog Labrador tea, previously &quot;Ledum groenlandicum&quot; or &quot;Ledum latifolium&quot;)
* &quot;Rhododendron neoglandulosum&quot;, (Western Labrador tea, or trapper&#x27;s tea, previously &quot;Ledum glandulosum&quot;)

==In culture==
In Uttarakhand, in north India, the Buransh flower is deeply embedded in local culture, playing a significant role in festivals like Holi and weddings, where it is used in garlands and decorations to bless attendees. The flower is also utilized in making a healthful, antioxidant-rich juice that is popular during local festivities and summer months. Additionally, Buransh flowers are incorporated into local arts and crafts, where they are used to make colorful necklaces and jewelry, symbolizing the spiritual and physical prosperity of the community.

The rhododendron is the national flower of Nepal.
In the language of flowers, the rhododendron symbolizes danger and to beware.

&quot;Rhododendron arboreum&quot; (&quot;lali guransh&quot;) is the national flower of Nepal. &quot;R. ponticum&quot; is the state flower of Indian-administered Kashmir and Pakistan-controlled Kashmir. &quot;Rhododendron niveum&quot; is the state tree of Sikkim in India. Rhododendron arboreum is also the state tree of the state of Uttarakhand, India. Pink Rhododendron (&quot;Rhododendron campanulatum&quot;) is the state flower of Himachal Pradesh, India. Rhododendron is also the provincial flower of Jiangxi, China and the state flower of Nagaland, the 16th state of the Indian Union.

&quot;Rhododendron maximum&quot;, the most widespread rhododendron of the Appalachian Mountains, is the state flower of the US state of West Virginia, and is in the Flag of West Virginia.

&quot;Rhododendron macrophyllum&quot;, a widespread rhododendron of the Pacific Northwest, is the state flower of the US state of Washington.

Amongst the Zomi tribes in India and Myanmar, &quot;Rhododendrons&quot; called &quot;Ngeisok&quot; is used in a poetic manner to signify a lady.
===In media===
The nineteenth-century American poet and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson in 1834 wrote a poem titled &quot;The Rhodora, On Being Asked, Whence Is the Flower&quot;.

Rhododendrons play a role and are soliloquized in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. The flowers are referenced throughout Daphne Du Maurier&#x27;s novel &quot;Rebecca&quot; (1938) and in Sharon Creech&#x27;s young adult novel &quot;Walk Two Moons&quot; (1994). British author Jasper Fforde also uses rhododendron as a motif throughout many of his books, e.g. the &quot;Thursday Next&quot; series and &quot;Shades of Grey&quot; (2009).

The effects of &quot;R. ponticum&quot; were mentioned in the 2009 film &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; as a proposed way to arrange a fake execution. It was also mentioned in the third episode of Season 2 of BBC&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock&quot;, speculated to have been a part of Sherlock&#x27;s fake death scheme.

<text>Fetchmail is an open-source software utility for POSIX-compliant operating systems which is used to retrieve e-mail from a remote POP3, IMAP, or ODMR mail server to the user&#x27;s local system. It was developed from the popclient program, written by Carl Harris.

Its chief significance is perhaps that its author, Eric S. Raymond, used it as a model to discuss his theories of open-source software development in a widely read and influential essay on software development methodologies &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;.

== Design ==

By design, Fetchmail&#x27;s only means of delivering messages is by submitting them to the local MTA/Message transfer agent or invoking a mail delivery agent like procmail, maildrop, or sendmail; delivering directly to mail folders such as maildir is not supported.

It is a C program evolved by gradual mutation from an ancestor already written in C.

Dan Bernstein, getmail creator Charles Cazabon and FreeBSD developer Terry Lambert, have criticized Fetchmail&#x27;s design, its number of security holes, and that it was prematurely put into &quot;maintenance mode&quot;. In 2004, a new team of maintainers took over Fetchmail development, and laid out development plans that broke with design decisions that Eric Raymond had made in earlier versions.

<doc id="40338" wikidata="Q38931" url="?curid=40338" title="Mayor of London">
<text>The mayor of London is the chief executive of the Greater London Authority. The role was created in 2000 after the Greater London devolution referendum in 1998, and was the first directly elected mayor in the United Kingdom.

The current mayor is Sadiq Khan, who took office on 9 May 2016. The position was held by Ken Livingstone from the creation of the role on 4 May 2000 until he was defeated in May 2008 by Boris Johnson, who then also served two terms before being succeeded by Khan.

The mayor is scrutinised by the London Assembly and, supported by their Mayoral Cabinet, directs the entirety of London, including the City of London (for which there is also the Lord Mayor of the City of London). Each of the 32 London Boroughs also has a ceremonial mayor or, in Croydon, Hackney, Lewisham, Newham and Tower Hamlets, an elected mayor.

==Background==
The Greater London Council, the elected government for Greater London, was abolished in 1986 by the Local Government Act 1985. Strategic functions were split off to various joint arrangements. Londoners voted in a referendum in 1998 to create a new governance structure for Greater London. The directly elected mayor of London was created by the Greater London Authority Act 1999 in 2000 as part of the reforms.

==Elections==

The mayor is elected by the first-past-the-post system for a fixed term of four years, with elections taking place in May. Prior to the Elections Act 2022, the supplementary vote method was used. There are no limits on the number of terms a mayor may serve. The mayor is elected by the largest single-member electorate in the United Kingdom.

As with most elected posts in the United Kingdom, there is a deposit (in this case of £10,000), which is returnable on the candidate&#x27;s winning of at least 5% of votes cast.

===Most recent election===

The most recent London mayoral election was held on 2 May 2024. The results of the election were announced on 4 May 2024. Sadiq Khan was re-elected as mayor and became the first to be elected for 3 terms, beating the Conservative Susan Hall.

== List of mayors ==

==Timeline==
;Timeline
==Powers and functions==
Most powers are derived from the Greater London Authority Act 1999, with additional functions coming from the Greater London Authority Act 2007, the Localism Act 2011 and Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011.

The mayor&#x27;s main functions are:
*Strategic planning, including housing, waste management, the environment and production of the London Plan
*Refuse or permit planning permission on strategic grounds
*Transport policy, delivered by functional body Transport for London
*Fire and emergency planning, delivered by functional body London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority
*Policing and crime policy, delivered by functional body Mayor&#x27;s Office for Policing and Crime (before 2012 by functional body Metropolitan Police Authority). The Metropolitan Police has a structure different to most others across the country, reporting to the Mayor of London instead of a police and crime commissioner.
*Economic development, delivered directly by the Greater London Authority through subsidiary company GLA Land and Property (before 2012 by functional body London Development Agency)
*Power to create development corporations, such as the London Legacy Development Corporation

The remaining local government functions are performed by the London borough councils. There is some overlap; for example, the borough councils are responsible for waste management, but the mayor is required to produce a waste management strategy. In 2010, Johnson launched an initiative in partnership with the Multi-academy Trust AET to transform schools across London. This led to the establishment of London Academies Enterprise Trust (LAET) which was intended to be a group of ten academies, but it only reached a group of four before the mayor withdrew it in 2013. The mayor is a member of the Mayoral Council for England and the Council of the Nations and Regions.

The following is a table comparing power over services of the boroughs to the GLA and mayor.
==Initiatives==
===Ken Livingstone===
Initiatives taken by Ken Livingstone as Mayor of London included the London congestion charge on private vehicles using city centre London on weekdays, the creation of the London Climate Change Agency, the London Energy Partnership and the founding of the international Large Cities Climate Leadership Group, now known as C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group. The congestion charge led to many new buses being introduced across London. In August 2003, Livingstone oversaw the introduction of the Oyster card electronic ticketing system for Transport for London services. Livingstone supported the withdrawal of the vintage AEC Routemaster buses from regular service in London.

Livingstone introduced the London Partnerships Register which was a voluntary scheme without legal force for same sex couples to register their partnership, and paved the way for the introduction by the United Kingdom Parliament of civil partnerships and later still, Same-sex marriage. Unlike civil partnerships, the London Partnerships Register was open to heterosexual couples who favour a public commitment other than marriage.

As Mayor of London, Livingstone was a supporter of the London Olympics in 2012, ultimately winning the bid to host the Games in 2005. Livingstone encouraged sport in London; especially when sport could be combined with helping charities like The London Marathon and 10K charity races. Livingstone, in a mayoral election debate on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Question Time&quot; in April 2008, stated that the primary reason he supported the Olympic bid was to secure funding for the redevelopment of the East End of London. In July 2007, he brought the Tour de France cycle race to London.

===Boris Johnson===
In May 2008, Boris Johnson introduced a new transport safety initiative to put 440 high visibility police officers in and around bus stations. A ban on alcohol on underground, and Docklands Light Railway, tram services and stations across the capital was introduced.

Also in May 2008, he announced the closure of &quot;The Londoner&quot; newspaper, saving approximately £2.9 million. A percentage of this saving was to be spent on planting 10,000 new street trees.

In 2010, he extended the coverage of Oyster card electronic ticketing to all National Rail overground train services. Also in 2010, he opened a cycle hire scheme (originally sponsored by Barclays, now Santander) with 5,000 bicycles available for hire across London. Although initiated by his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, the scheme rapidly acquired the nickname of &quot;Boris Bikes&quot;. Johnson withdrew the recently introduced high-speed high-capacity &quot;bendy buses&quot; from service in 2011 which had been bought by Livingstone, and he instead supported the development of the New Routemaster which entered service the next year.

In 2011, Boris Johnson set up the Outer London Fund of £50 million designed to help facilitate improve local high streets. Areas in London were given the chance to submit proposals for two tranches of funding. Successful bids for Phase 1 included Enfield, Muswell Hill and Bexley town centre. The recipients of phase 2 funding were still to be announced .

In January 2013, he appointed journalist Andrew Gilligan as the first Cycling Commissioner for London. In March 2013, Johnson announced £1 billion of investment in infrastructure to make cycling safer in London, including a East to West segregated &#x27;Crossrail for bikes&#x27;.

At the General Election of 7 May 2015, Johnson was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip, He continued to serve as mayor until the mayoral election in May 2016, when Sadiq Khan was elected.

===Sadiq Khan===

Sadiq Khan introduced the &#x27;bus hopper&#x27; fare on TfL buses, which allows passengers to board a second bus within one hour for the same fare. Under Khan, paper, coin and cash transactions became obsolete. The Oyster system was expanded to include debit and credit cards. This initiative was started under his predecessor, Johnson.

Upon election, Khan outlined a vision to make London the &quot;greenest city&quot; by investing in walking and cycling infrastructure while reducing polluting vehicles. In 2019, the &quot;Ultra Low Emission Zone&quot; scheme was launched which taxes highly polluting vehicles in its covered territory. London declared itself the world&#x27;s first &quot;National Park City&quot; (effective from July 2019), reflecting its unusually high amount of green space for a city of its size.

====Extended term====
The Government postponed all elections due in May 2020, including for the mayor of London, for one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Khan had therefore served a term in office of five years rather than four, which ended in May 2021. He was re-elected in 2021 for a shortened three-year term, defeating the Conservative candidate Shaun Bailey.

<text>The Lord Mayor of London is the mayor of the City of London, England, and the leader of the City of London Corporation. Within the City, the Lord Mayor is accorded precedence over all individuals except the sovereign and retains various traditional powers, rights, and privileges, including the title and style &quot;The Right Honourable Lord Mayor of London&quot;.

One of the world&#x27;s oldest continuously elected civic offices, it is entirely separate from the directly elected mayor of London, a political office controlling a budget which covers the much larger area of Greater London.

The Corporation of London changed its name to the City of London Corporation in 2006, and accordingly the title Lord Mayor of the City of London was introduced, so as to avoid confusion with that of Mayor of London. The legal and commonly used title remains &quot;Lord Mayor of London&quot;. The Lord mayor is elected at &quot;Common Hall&quot; each year on Michaelmas, and takes office on the Friday before the second Saturday in November, at &quot;The Silent Ceremony&quot;. The Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show is held on the day after taking office; the Lord Mayor, preceded by a procession, travels to the Royal Courts of Justice at the Strand to swear allegiance to the sovereign before the Justices of the High Court.

The Lord Mayor&#x27;s main role nowadays is to represent, support and promote the businesses and residents in the City of London. Today these businesses are mostly in the financial sector, and the Lord Mayor is regarded as the champion of the entire UK-based financial sector regardless of ownership or location throughout the country. As leader of the Corporation of the City of London, the Lord Mayor serves as the key spokesman for the local authority and also has important ceremonial and social responsibilities. The Lord Mayor is non-affiliated politically, typically delivering many hundreds of speeches and addresses per year and attending many receptions and other events in London and beyond. Incumbents usually make overseas visits under the auspices of the FCDO. The Lord Mayor, &quot;ex officio&quot; Rector of City, University of London and also Admiral of the Port of London, is assisted in day-to-day administration by the Mansion House &#x27;Esquires&#x27; whose titles include the City Marshal, Sword Bearer and Common Crier.

Alastair King serves as the 696th Lord Mayor (for 2024–2025). The Lord Mayor is also assisted by The Venerable Ray Pentland CB QHC as Lord Mayor&#x27;s Chaplain. The Lord Mayor’s office is also served by Aide de Camp representing the Uniformed Youth Organisations and they will be pleased to assist in the arranging of new affiliations. The Lord Mayor has six individual Cadet ADCs representing the various Uniformed Youth Organisation branches who provide him with a connection to the City Cadet Forces.
==Titles and honours==

Of the 69 cities in the United Kingdom, the City of London is among the 30 that have lord mayors (or, in Scotland, lords provost). The Lord Mayor is entitled to the prefix The Right Honourable; the same privilege extends only to the lord mayors of York, Cardiff, Bristol and Belfast, and to the lords provost of Edinburgh and Glasgow. The style is used when referring to the office as opposed to the holder thereof; thus, &quot;The Rt Hon Lord Mayor of London&quot; would be correct, while &quot;The Rt Hon William Russell&quot; would be incorrect. The latter prefix applies only to privy counsellors and peers.

A woman who holds the office is also known as a Lord Mayor. The wife of a male Lord Mayor is styled as Lady Mayoress, but no equivalent title exists for the husband of a female Lord Mayor. A female lord mayor or an unmarried male lord mayor may appoint a female consort, usually a fellow member of the corporation, to the role of lady mayoress. In speech, a lord mayor is referred to as &quot;My Lord Mayor&quot;, and a lady mayoress as &quot;My Lady Mayoress&quot;.

It was once customary for lord mayors to be appointed knights upon taking office and baronets upon retirement, unless they already held such a title. This custom was followed with a few inconsistencies from the 16th until the 19th centuries; creations became more regular from 1889 onward. From 1964 onward, the regular creation of hereditary titles such as baronetcies was phased out, so subsequent lord mayors were offered knighthoods (and, until 1993, most often as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire (GBE)). Since 1993, lord mayors have not automatically received any national honour upon appointment; instead, they have been made knights bachelor upon retirement, although Gordon Brown&#x27;s Government broke with that tradition by making Ian Luder a CBE, after his term of office in 2009, and the following year Nick Anstee declined offers of an honour. Furthermore, foreign heads of state visiting the City of London on a UK state visit, diplomatically bestow upon the Lord Mayor one of their suitable national honours. For example, in 2001, Sir David Howard was created a grand cordon (first class) of the Order of Independence of Jordan by King Abdullah II. Recently lord mayors have been appointed at the beginning of their term of office knights or dames of St John, as a mark of respect, by the late Queen Elizabeth II, Sovereign Head of the Order of St John until her death in 2022.

==History==

The office of mayor was instituted in 1189, the first holder of the office being Henry Fitz-Ailwin de Londonestone. The mayor of the City of London has been elected by the City, rather than appointed by the sovereign, ever since a royal charter providing for a mayor was issued by King John in 1215. The title &quot;lord mayor&quot; came to be used after 1354, when it was granted to Thomas Legge (then serving his second of two terms) by King Edward III.

Lord mayors are elected for one-year terms; by custom, they do not now normally serve more than one consecutive term. Numerous individuals have served multiple terms in office, including:

As mayor
* 24 terms: Sir Henry FitzAlan (1189–1212)
* 9 terms: Ralph de Sandwich (1285–1289, 1289–1292)
* 8 terms: Gregory de Rokesley (1274–1280, 1284)
* 7 terms: Andrew Buckerel (1231–1237); John le Breton (1289, 1293–1298); John le Blund (1301–1307)
* 6 terms: Richard le Ranger (1222–1226, 1238); Hamo de Chigwell (1319, 1321, 1322, 1324, 1325, 1327)
* 5 terms: Serlo le Mercer (1214, 1218–1221)
As Lord Mayor
* Sir Nicholas Brembre (1377, 1383–1385; 4 terms)
* Sir Richard (&#x27;Dick&#x27;) Whittington (1397, 1398, 1406 and 1419; 4 terms)
* William Sevenoke (1418)
* Sir Robert Fowler (elected in 1883 and in 1885).
* Sir William Russell (2019–2021, 2 terms)

Almost 700 people have served as lord mayor. Dame Mary Donaldson, elected in 1983, as well as Dame Fiona Woolf, elected in 2013, are the only women to have held the office.

Some lord mayors in the Middle Ages, such as Sir Edward Dalyngrigge (1392), did not reside in London. Since 1435, the lord mayor has been chosen from amongst the aldermen of the City of London.

==Election==
The lord mayor is elected at Common Hall, comprising liverymen belonging to all of the City&#x27;s livery companies. Common Hall is summoned by the sitting lord mayor; it meets at Guildhall on Michaelmas Day (29 September) or on the closest weekday. Voting is by show of hands; if any liveryman so demands, balloting is held a fortnight later.

The qualification to stand for election is that one must have served as a City sheriff and be a current alderman. Since 1385, prior service as sheriff has been mandatory for election to the lord mayoralty. Two sheriffs are selected annually by Common Hall, which meets on Midsummer&#x27;s Day for this purpose. By an ordinance of 1435, the lord mayor must be chosen from amongst the aldermen of the City of London. Those on the electoral roll of each of the City&#x27;s 25 wards select one alderman, who formerly held office for life or until resignation. Now each alderman must submit for re-election at least once in every six years.

The lord mayor is then sworn in November, on the day before the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show (&quot;see below&quot;). The ceremony is known as the &quot;Silent Ceremony&quot; because, aside from a short declaration by the incoming Lord Mayor, no speeches are made. At Guildhall, the outgoing lord mayor transfers the mayoral insignia – the seal, the purse, the sword and the mace — to the incoming lord mayor.

The lord mayor to be elected in November 2017 was known in April of that year.

==Show==

The day after being sworn into office, the lord mayor leads a procession from the City of London to the Royal Courts of Justice in the City of Westminster, where the lord mayor swears allegiance to the Crown. This pageantry has evolved into one of London&#x27;s longest-running and most popular annual events, known as the &quot;Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show&quot;. The lord mayor travels in the City&#x27;s state coach that was built in 1757 at a cost of £1,065.0s.3d. Nowadays, this festival combines traditional British pageantry with the element of carnival, and since 1959 it has been held on the second Saturday in November. Participants include the livery companies, bands and members of the military, charities and schools. In the evening, a fireworks display is held.

==Role==
The lord mayor is a member of the City of London&#x27;s governing body, the City of London Corporation (incorporated as &quot;The Mayor and Commonalty and Citizens of the City of London&quot;). The Corporation comprises the Court of Aldermen and the Court of Common Council; the former includes only the aldermen, while the latter includes both aldermen and common councilmen. The Lord mayor belongs to and presides over both bodies.

As noted earlier, the main role of the lord mayor is to represent, support and promote all aspects of UK-financial service industries, including maritime. They undertake this as head of the City of London Corporation and, during the year, host visiting foreign government ministers, businessmen and dignitaries; furthermore, they conduct several foreign visits of their own so as to promote British financial sectors.
Banquets hosted by the Lord Mayor serve as opportunities for senior government figures to deliver major speeches. At the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Banquet (held on the Monday after the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show), the Prime Minister delivers the keynote address. At the Banker&#x27;s Dinner in June, the Chancellor of the Exchequer delivers a speech known as the &quot;Mansion House Speech&quot;, which takes its name from the Lord Mayor&#x27;s residence. At the Easter Banquet, also hosted each year at the Mansion House, the Foreign Secretary addresses an audience of international dignitaries.

The lord mayor sometimes takes part in major state occasions; for example, in 2013, the then-lord mayor, Sir Roger Gifford, carried the Mourning Sword at Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s funeral, processing ahead of the Queen and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, into St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral.

The lord mayor performs numerous other functions, including serving as the chief magistrate of the City of London, admiral of the Port of London, rector of City, University of London, president of Gresham College, president of City of London Reserve Forces and Cadets Association, and trustee of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. The lord mayor also heads the City&#x27;s Commission of Lieutenancy, which represents the sovereign in the City of London (other counties usually have lord lieutenants, as opposed to Commissions), and annually attends the Treloar Trust (named after Sir William Treloar, lord mayor in 1906), in Hampshire. The Treloar Trust runs two educational sites for disabled children, a school and college.

==Rights and privileges==
The residence of the lord mayor is known as Mansion House. The establishment of the residence was considered after the Great Fire of London (1666), but construction did not commence until 1739. It was first occupied by a lord mayor in 1752, when Sir Crispin Gascoigne took up residence. The official car of the lord mayor is a Rolls-Royce Phantom VI with registration number LM 0.

In each of the eighteen courtrooms of the Old Bailey, the centre of the judges&#x27; bench is reserved for the lord mayor, in his capacity of chief justice of the City of London. The presiding judge therefore sits to one side.

It is sometimes asserted that the lord mayor may exclude the monarch from the City of London. The legend is based on the misinterpretation of the ceremony observed each time the sovereign enters the City: at Temple Bar the lord mayor presents the City&#x27;s Pearl Sword to the sovereign as a symbol of the latter&#x27;s overlordship. The monarch does not, as is often purported, wait for the lord mayor&#x27;s permission to enter the City. When the sovereign enters the City, a short ceremony usually takes place where the lord mayor presents a sword to the monarch, symbolically surrendering their authority. If the sovereign is attending a service at St Paul&#x27;s this ceremony would take place there rather than at the boundary of the City for matters of convenience.

The importance of the office is reflected by the composition of the Accession Council, a body which proclaims the accession of new sovereigns. The Council includes the lord mayor and aldermen of London, as well as members of the House of Lords and privy counsellors. At the coronation banquet which followed, the lord mayor of the City of London had the right to assist the royal butler. The same privilege is held by the lord mayor of Oxford; the mayor of Winchester may assist the royal cook. Such privileges have not been exercised since 1821, when the last coronation banquet (celebrating the coronation of George IV) was held.

==Official dress==
On formal occasions the lord mayor wears traditional black velvet court dress (old style) consisting of a coat, waistcoat and knee breeches with steel cut buttons. This is worn with black silk stockings, patent court shoes with steel buckles, white shirt with lace cuffs and a large jabot stock. This form of court dress is worn by all lord mayors regardless of gender.

When outdoors, they wear a black beaver plush tricorne hat trimmed with black ostrich feathers and a steel &#x27;loop&#x27; for the cockade. This has been traditionally made by Patey&#x27;s commissioned by the Worshipful Company of Feltmakers for each incumbent lord mayor.

Since 1545 the lord mayor of London has worn a Royal Livery Collar of Esses. The collar&#x27;s origins are not royal, Sir John Alleyn, twice lord mayor, having bequeathed it to the next lord mayor and his successors &quot;to use and occupie yerely at and uppon principall and festivall dayes&quot;. It was enlarged in 1567, and in its present shape has 28 Esses (the Lancastrian ‘S’), Tudor roses and the tasselled knots of the Garter (alternating) and also the Portcullis, from which hangs the Mayoral Jewel. The collar is worn over whatever the lord mayor may be wearing, secured onto their underdress or State Robes by means of black or white silk satin ribbons on the shoulders.

===Robes===

As an alderman of the City of London the lord mayor has a scarlet gown and a violet gown, which are identical to those worn by their fellow aldermen except that they are trained. The violet robe is worn at most formal meetings of the Corporation with the scarlet robe substituted on certain days or occasions as directed by the City Ceremonial Book.

For State occasions when the monarch is present, the lord mayor wears a crimson velvet robe of state trimmed with an ermine cape and facings, very similar to a royal earl&#x27;s coronation robe. It is tied with gold cordons, and dates from the reign of George IV.

On other ceremonial occasions is worn a black silk damask robe trimmed with gold lace of a design exactly the same as that of the Lord Chancellor, known as the Entertaining Gown.

At coronations, the lord mayor wears a special coronation robe: a mantle of scarlet superfine wool trimmed with bars of gold lace and ermine. It is lined with white silk satin; they also carry the Crystal Sceptre as a baton of office. After the coronation, the incumbent may personally keep their coronation robe as a token.

There is also a plain black gown, worn by the lord mayor in times of national mourning and/or grief.

<doc id="40343" wikidata="Q422128" url="?curid=40343" title="Prehnite">
<text>Prehnite is an inosilicate of calcium and aluminium with the formula: Ca2Al(AlSi3O10)(OH)2 with limited Fe3+ substitutes for aluminium in the structure. Prehnite crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system, and most often forms as stalactitic, botryoidal, reniform or globular aggregates, with only just the crests of small crystals showing any faces, which are almost always curved or composite. Very rarely will it form distinct, well-individualized crystals showing a square-like cross-section, including those found at the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec, Canada. Prehnite is brittle with an uneven fracture and a vitreous to pearly luster. Its hardness is 6.5, its specific gravity is 2.80–2.95 and its color varies from light green to yellow, but also colorless, blue, pink or white. In April 2000, rare orange prehnite was discovered in the Kalahari Manganese Fields, South Africa. Prehnite is mostly translucent, and rarely transparent.

Though not a zeolite, prehnite is found associated with minerals such as datolite, calcite, apophyllite, epidote, stilbite, laumontite, and heulandite in veins and cavities of basaltic rocks, sometimes in granites, syenites, or gneisses. It is an indicator mineral of the prehnite-pumpellyite metamorphic facies. 

It was first described in 1788 for an occurrence in the Karoo dolerites of Cradock, Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. It was named for Colonel Hendrik Von Prehn (1733–1785), commander of the military forces of the Dutch colony at the Cape of Good Hope from 1768 to 1780.

It is used as a gemstone. 

Extensive deposits of gem-quality prehnite occur in the basalt tableland surrounding Wave Hill Station in the central Northern Territory, of Australia.

<text>A semiconductor device is an electronic component that relies on the electronic properties of a semiconductor material (primarily silicon, germanium, and gallium arsenide, as well as organic semiconductors) for its function. Its conductivity lies between conductors and insulators. Semiconductor devices have replaced vacuum tubes in most applications. They conduct electric current in the solid state, rather than as free electrons across a vacuum (typically liberated by thermionic emission) or as free electrons and ions through an ionized gas.

Semiconductor devices are manufactured both as single discrete devices and as integrated circuits, which consist of two or more devices—which can number from the hundreds to the billions—manufactured and interconnected on a single semiconductor wafer (also called a substrate).

Semiconductor materials are useful because their behavior can be easily manipulated by the deliberate addition of impurities, known as doping. Semiconductor conductivity can be controlled by the introduction of an electric or magnetic field, by exposure to light or heat, or by the mechanical deformation of a doped monocrystalline silicon grid; thus, semiconductors can make excellent sensors. Current conduction in a semiconductor occurs due to mobile or &quot;free&quot; electrons and electron holes, collectively known as charge carriers. Doping a semiconductor with a small proportion of an atomic impurity, such as phosphorus or boron, greatly increases the number of free electrons or holes within the semiconductor. When a doped semiconductor contains excess holes, it is called a p-type semiconductor (&quot;p&quot; for positive electric charge); when it contains excess free electrons, it is called an n-type semiconductor (&quot;n&quot; for a negative electric charge). A majority of mobile charge carriers have negative charges. The manufacture of semiconductors controls precisely the location and concentration of p- and n-type dopants. The connection of n-type and p-type semiconductors form p–n junctions.

The most common semiconductor device in the world is the MOSFET (metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor), also called the MOS transistor. As of 2013, billions of MOS transistors are manufactured every day. Semiconductor devices made per year have been growing by 9.1% on average since 1978, and shipments in 2018 are predicted for the first time to exceed 1 trillion, meaning that well over 7 trillion have been made to date.

==Main types==

===Diode===

A semiconductor diode is a device typically made from a single p–n junction. At the junction of a p-type and an n-type semiconductor, there forms a depletion region where current conduction is inhibited by the lack of mobile charge carriers. When the device is &quot;forward biased&quot; (connected with the p-side, having a higher electric potential than the n-side), this depletion region is diminished, allowing for significant conduction. Contrariwise, only a very small current can be achieved when the diode is &quot;reverse biased&quot; (connected with the n-side at lower electric potential than the p-side, and thus the depletion region expanded).

Exposing a semiconductor to light can generate electron–hole pairs, which increases the number of free carriers and thereby the conductivity. Diodes optimized to take advantage of this phenomenon are known as &quot;photodiodes&quot;.
Compound semiconductor diodes can also produce light, as in light-emitting diodes and laser diode

===Transistor===
====Bipolar junction transistor====
Bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) are formed from two p–n junctions, in either n–p–n or p–n–p configuration. The middle, or &quot;base&quot;, the region between the junctions is typically very narrow. The other regions, and their associated terminals, are known as the &quot;emitter&quot; and the &quot;collector&quot;. A small current injected through the junction between the base and the emitter changes the properties of the base-collector junction so that it can conduct current even though it is reverse biased. This creates a much larger current between the collector and emitter, controlled by the base-emitter current.

====Field-effect transistor====
Another type of transistor, the field-effect transistor (FET), operates on the principle that semiconductor conductivity can be increased or decreased by the presence of an electric field. An electric field can increase the number of free electrons and holes in a semiconductor, thereby changing its conductivity. The field may be applied by a reverse-biased p–n junction, forming a &quot;junction field-effect transistor&quot; (JFET) or by an electrode insulated from the bulk material by an oxide layer, forming a &quot;metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor&quot; (MOSFET).

====Metal-oxide-semiconductor====


The metal-oxide-semiconductor FET (MOSFET, or MOS transistor), a solid-state device, is by far the most used widely semiconductor device today. It accounts for at least 99.9% of all transistors, and there have been an estimated 13sextillion MOSFETs manufactured between 1960 and 2018.

The &quot;gate&quot; electrode is charged to produce an electric field that controls the conductivity of a &quot;channel&quot; between two terminals, called the &quot;source&quot; and &quot;drain&quot;. Depending on the type of carrier in the channel, the device may be an &quot;n-channel&quot; (for electrons) or a &quot;p-channel&quot; (for holes) MOSFET. Although the MOSFET is named in part for its &quot;metal&quot; gate, in modern devices polysilicon is typically used instead.

==Materials==

By far, silicon (Si) is the most widely used material in semiconductor devices. Its combination of low raw material cost, relatively simple processing, and a useful temperature range makes it currently the best compromise among the various competing materials. Silicon used in semiconductor device manufacturing is currently fabricated into boules that are large enough in diameter to allow the production of 300 mm (12 in.) wafers.

Germanium (Ge) was a widely used early semiconductor material but its thermal sensitivity makes it less useful than silicon. Today, germanium is often alloyed with silicon for use in very-high-speed SiGe devices; IBM is a major producer of such devices.

Gallium arsenide (GaAs) is also widely used in high-speed devices but so far, it has been difficult to form large-diameter boules of this material, limiting the wafer diameter to sizes significantly smaller than silicon wafers thus making mass production of GaAs devices significantly more expensive than silicon.

Gallium Nitride (GaN) is gaining popularity in high-power applications including power ICs, light-emitting diodes (LEDs), and RF components due to its high strength and thermal conductivity. Compared to silicon, GaN&#x27;s band gap is more than 3 times wider at 3.4 eV and it conducts electrons 1,000 times more efficiently.

Other less common materials are also in use or under investigation.

Silicon carbide (SiC) is also gaining popularity in power ICs and has found some application as the raw material for blue LEDs and is being investigated for use in semiconductor devices that could withstand very high operating temperatures and environments with the presence of significant levels of ionizing radiation. IMPATT diodes have also been fabricated from SiC.

Various indium compounds (indium arsenide, indium antimonide, and indium phosphide) are also being used in LEDs and solid-state laser diodes. Selenium sulfide is being studied in the manufacture of photovoltaic solar cells.

The most common use for organic semiconductors is organic light-emitting diodes.

==Applications==
All transistor types can be used as the building blocks of logic gates, which are fundamental in the design of digital circuits. In digital circuits like microprocessors, transistors act as on-off switches; in the MOSFET, for instance, the voltage applied to the gate determines whether the switch is on or off.

Transistors used for analog circuits do not act as on-off switches; rather, they respond to a continuous range of inputs with a continuous range of outputs. Common analog circuits include amplifiers and oscillators.

Circuits that interface or translate between digital circuits and analog circuits are known as mixed-signal circuits.

Power semiconductor devices are discrete devices or integrated circuits intended for high current or high voltage applications. Power integrated circuits combine IC technology with power semiconductor technology, these are sometimes referred to as &quot;smart&quot; power devices. Several companies specialize in manufacturing power semiconductors.

===Component identifiers===
The part numbers of semiconductor devices are often manufacturer specific. Nevertheless, there have been attempts at creating standards for type codes, and a subset of devices follow those. For discrete devices, for example, there are three standards: JEDEC JESD370B in the United States, Pro Electron in Europe, and Japanese Industrial Standards (JIS).

==History of development ==


===Cat&#x27;s-whisker detector===

Semiconductors had been used in the electronics field for some time before the invention of the transistor. Around the turn of the 20th century they were quite common as detectors in radios, used in a device called a &quot;cat&#x27;s whisker&quot; developed by Jagadish Chandra Bose and others. These detectors were somewhat troublesome, however, requiring the operator to move a small tungsten filament (the whisker) around the surface of a galena (lead sulfide) or carborundum (silicon carbide) crystal until it suddenly started working. Then, over a period of a few hours or days, the cat&#x27;s whisker would slowly stop working and the process would have to be repeated. At the time their operation was completely mysterious. After the introduction of the more reliable and amplified vacuum tube based radios, the cat&#x27;s whisker systems quickly disappeared. The &quot;cat&#x27;s whisker&quot; is a primitive example of a special type of diode still popular today, called a Schottky diode.

===Metal rectifier===

Another early type of semiconductor device is the metal rectifier in which the semiconductor is copper oxide or selenium. Westinghouse Electric (1886) was a major manufacturer of these rectifiers.

===World War II===
During World War II, radar research quickly pushed radar receivers to operate at ever higher frequencies about 4000 MHz and the traditional tube-based radio receivers no longer worked well. The introduction of the cavity magnetron from Britain to the United States in 1940 during the Tizard Mission resulted in a pressing need for a practical high-frequency amplifier. 

On a whim, Russell Ohl of Bell Laboratories decided to try a cat&#x27;s whisker. By this point, they had not been in use for a number of years, and no one at the labs had one. After hunting one down at a used radio store in Manhattan, he found that it worked much better than tube-based systems.

Ohl investigated why the cat&#x27;s whisker functioned so well. He spent most of 1939 trying to grow more pure versions of the crystals. He soon found that with higher-quality crystals their finicky behavior went away, but so did their ability to operate as a radio detector. One day he found one of his purest crystals nevertheless worked well, and it had a clearly visible crack near the middle. However, as he moved about the room trying to test it, the detector would mysteriously work, and then stop again. After some study he found that the behavior was controlled by the light in the room – more light caused more conductance in the crystal. He invited several other people to see this crystal, and Walter Brattain immediately realized there was some sort of junction at the crack.

Further research cleared up the remaining mystery. The crystal had cracked because either side contained very slightly different amounts of the impurities Ohl could not remove – about 0.2%. One side of the crystal had impurities that added extra electrons (the carriers of electric current) and made it a &quot;conductor&quot;. The other had impurities that wanted to bind to these electrons, making it (what he called) an &quot;insulator&quot;. Because the two parts of the crystal were in contact with each other, the electrons could be pushed out of the conductive side which had extra electrons (soon to be known as the &quot;emitter&quot;), and replaced by new ones being provided (from a battery, for instance) where they would flow into the insulating portion and be collected by the whisker filament (named the &quot;collector&quot;). However, when the voltage was reversed the electrons being pushed into the collector would quickly fill up the &quot;holes&quot; (the electron-needy impurities), and conduction would stop almost instantly. This junction of the two crystals (or parts of one crystal) created a solid-state diode, and the concept soon became known as semiconduction. The mechanism of action when the diode off has to do with the separation of charge carriers around the junction. This is called a &quot;depletion region&quot;.

===Development of the diode===
Armed with the knowledge of how these new diodes worked, a vigorous effort began to learn how to build them on demand. Teams at Purdue University, Bell Labs, MIT, and the University of Chicago all joined forces to build better crystals. Within a year germanium production had been perfected to the point where military-grade diodes were being used in most radar sets.

===Development of the transistor===

After the war, William Shockley decided to attempt the building of a triode-like semiconductor device. He secured funding and lab space, and went to work on the problem with Brattain and John Bardeen.

The key to the development of the transistor was the further understanding of the process of the electron mobility in a semiconductor. It was realized that if there were some way to control the flow of the electrons from the emitter to the collector of this newly discovered diode, an amplifier could be built. For instance, if contacts are placed on both sides of a single type of crystal, current will not flow between them through the crystal. However, if a third contact could then &quot;inject&quot; electrons or holes into the material, the current would flow.

Actually doing this appeared to be very difficult. If the crystal were of any reasonable size, the number of electrons (or holes) required to be injected would have to be very large, making it less than useful as an amplifier because it would require a large injection current to start with. That said, the whole idea of the crystal diode was that the crystal itself could provide the electrons over a very small distance, the depletion region. The key appeared to be to place the input and output contacts very close together on the surface of the crystal on either side of this region.

Brattain started working on building such a device, and tantalizing hints of amplification continued to appear as the team worked on the problem. Sometimes the system would work but then stop working unexpectedly. In one instance a non-working system started working when placed in water. Ohl and Brattain eventually developed a new branch of quantum mechanics, which became known as surface physics, to account for the behavior. The electrons in any one piece of the crystal would migrate about due to nearby charges. Electrons in the emitters, or the &quot;holes&quot; in the collectors, would cluster at the surface of the crystal where they could find their opposite charge &quot;floating around&quot; in the air (or water). Yet they could be pushed away from the surface with the application of a small amount of charge from any other location on the crystal. Instead of needing a large supply of injected electrons, a very small number in the right place on the crystal would accomplish the same thing.

Their understanding solved the problem of needing a very small control area to some degree. Instead of needing two separate semiconductors connected by a common, but tiny, region, a single larger surface would serve. The electron-emitting and collecting leads would both be placed very close together on the top, with the control lead placed on the base of the crystal. When current flowed through this &quot;base&quot; lead, the electrons or holes would be pushed out, across the block of the semiconductor, and collect on the far surface. As long as the emitter and collector were very close together, this should allow enough electrons or holes between them to allow conduction to start.

===First transistor===

The Bell team made many attempts to build such a system with various tools but generally failed. Setups, where the contacts were close enough, were invariably as fragile as the original cat&#x27;s whisker detectors had been, and would work briefly, if at all. Eventually, they had a practical breakthrough. A piece of gold foil was glued to the edge of a plastic wedge, and then the foil was sliced with a razor at the tip of the triangle. The result was two very closely spaced contacts of gold. When the wedge was pushed down onto the surface of a crystal and voltage was applied to the other side (on the base of the crystal), current started to flow from one contact to the other as the base voltage pushed the electrons away from the base towards the other side near the contacts. The point-contact transistor had been invented.

While the device was constructed a week earlier, Brattain&#x27;s notes describe the first demonstration to higher-ups at Bell Labs on the afternoon of 23 December 1947, often given as the birthdate of the transistor. What is now known as the &quot;p–n–p point-contact germanium transistor&quot; operated as a speech amplifier with a power gain of 18 in that trial. John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain, and William Bradford Shockley were awarded the 1956 Nobel Prize in physics for their work.

===Etymology of &quot;transistor&quot;===
Bell Telephone Laboratories needed a generic name for their new invention: &quot;Semiconductor Triode&quot;, &quot;Solid Triode&quot;, &quot;Surface States Triode&quot;, &quot;Crystal Triode&quot; and &quot;Iotatron&quot; were all considered, but &quot;transistor&quot;, coined by John R. Pierce, won an internal ballot. The rationale for the name is described in the following extract from the company&#x27;s Technical Memoranda (May 28, 1948) [26] calling for votes:

Transistor. This is an abbreviated combination of the words &quot;transconductance&quot; or &quot;transfer&quot;, and &quot;varistor&quot;. The device logically belongs in the varistor family, and has the transconductance or transfer impedance of a device having gain, so that this combination is descriptive.

===Improvements in transistor design===
Shockley was upset about the device being credited to Brattain and Bardeen, who he felt had built it &quot;behind his back&quot; to take the glory. Matters became worse when Bell Labs lawyers found that some of Shockley&#x27;s own writings on the transistor were close enough to those of an earlier 1925 patent by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld that they thought it best that his name be left off the patent application.

Shockley was incensed, and decided to demonstrate who was the real brains of the operation. A few months later he invented an entirely new, considerably more robust, bipolar junction transistor type of transistor with a layer or &#x27;sandwich&#x27; structure, used for the vast majority of all transistors into the 1960s.

With the fragility problems solved, the remaining problem was purity. Making germanium of the required purity was proving to be a serious problem and limited the yield of transistors that actually worked from a given batch of material. Germanium&#x27;s sensitivity to temperature also limited its usefulness. Scientists theorized that silicon would be easier to fabricate, but few investigated this possibility. Former Bell Labs scientist Gordon K. Teal was the first to develop a working silicon transistor at the nascent Texas Instruments, giving it a technological edge. From the late 1950s, most transistors were silicon-based. Within a few years transistor-based products, most notably easily portable radios, were appearing on the market. &quot;Zone melting&quot;, a technique using a band of molten material moving through the crystal, further increased crystal purity.

===Metal-oxide semiconductor===

In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over the silicon wafer, for which they observed surface passivation effects. By 1957 Frosch and Derick, using masking and predeposition, were able to manufacture silicon dioxide field effect transistors; the first planar transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface. They showed that silicon dioxide insulated, protected silicon wafers and prevented dopants from diffusing into the wafer. At Bell Labs, the importance of Frosch and Derick technique and transistors was immediately realized. Results of their work circulated around Bell Labs in the form of BTL memos before being published in 1957. At Shockley Semiconductor, Shockley had circulated the preprint of their article in December 1956 to all his senior staff, including Jean Hoerni, who would later invent the planar process in 1959 while at Fairchild Semiconductor.

After this, J.R. Ligenza and W.G. Spitzer studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides, fabricated a high quality Si/SiO2 stack and published their results in 1960. Following this research, Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng proposed a silicon MOS transistor in 1959 and successfully demonstrated a working MOS device with their Bell Labs team in 1960. Their team included E. E. LaBate and E. I. Povilonis who fabricated the device; M. O. Thurston, L. A. D’Asaro, and J. R. Ligenza who developed the diffusion processes, and H. K. Gummel and R. Lindner who characterized the device.

With its scalability, and much lower power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors, the MOSFET became the most common type of transistor in computers, electronics, and communications technology such as smartphones. The US Patent and Trademark Office calls the MOSFET a &quot;groundbreaking invention that transformed life and culture around the world&quot;.

Bardeen&#x27;s 1948 inversion layer concept, forms the basis of CMOS technology today. CMOS (complementary MOS) was invented by Chih-Tang Sah and Frank Wanlass at Fairchild Semiconductor in 1963. The first report of a floating-gate MOSFET was made by Dawon Kahng and Simon Sze in 1967. FinFET (fin field-effect transistor), a type of 3D multi-gate MOSFET, was proposed by H. R. Farrah (Bendix Corporation) and R. F. Steinberg in 1967 and first built by Digh Hisamoto and his team of researchers at Hitachi Central Research Laboratory in 1989.

<text>In electronics, the metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET, MOS-FET, MOS FET, or MOS transistor) is a type of field-effect transistor (FET), most commonly fabricated by the controlled oxidation of silicon. It has an insulated gate, the voltage of which determines the conductivity of the device. This ability to change conductivity with the amount of applied voltage can be used for amplifying or switching electronic signals. The term &quot;metal–insulator–semiconductor field-effect transistor&quot; (&quot;MISFET&quot;) is almost synonymous with &quot;MOSFET&quot;. Another near-synonym is &quot;insulated-gate field-effect transistor&quot; (&quot;IGFET&quot;).

The main advantage of a MOSFET is that it requires almost no input current to control the load current under steady-state or low-frequency conditions, especially compared to bipolar junction transistors (BJTs). However, at high frequencies or when switching rapidly, a MOSFET may require significant current to charge and discharge its gate capacitance. In an &quot;enhancement mode&quot; MOSFET, voltage applied to the gate terminal increases the conductivity of the device. In &quot;depletion mode&quot; transistors, voltage applied at the gate reduces the conductivity.

The &quot;metal&quot; in the name MOSFET is sometimes a misnomer, because the gate material can be a layer of polysilicon (polycrystalline silicon). Similarly, &quot;oxide&quot; in the name can also be a misnomer, as different dielectric materials are used with the aim of obtaining strong channels with smaller applied voltages.

The MOSFET is by far the most common transistor in digital circuits, as billions may be included in a memory chip or microprocessor. As MOSFETs can be made with either p-type or n-type semiconductors, complementary pairs of MOS transistors can be used to make switching circuits with very low power consumption, in the form of CMOS logic.

== History ==
The basic principle of the field-effect transistor was first patented by Julius Edgar Lilienfeld in 1925. In 1934, inventor Oskar Heil independently patented a similar device in Europe.

In the 1940s, Bell Labs scientists William Shockley, John Bardeen and Walter Houser Brattain attempted to build a field-effect device, which led to their discovery of the transistor effect. However, the structure failed to show the anticipated effects, due to the problem of surface states: traps on the semiconductor surface that hold electrons immobile. With no surface passivation, they were only able to build the BJT and thyristor transistors. 

In 1955, Carl Frosch and Lincoln Derick accidentally grew a layer of silicon dioxide over the silicon wafer, for which they observed surface passivation effects. By 1957 Frosch and Derick, using masking and predeposition, were able to manufacture silicon dioxide field effect transistors; the first planar transistors, in which drain and source were adjacent at the same surface. They showed that silicon dioxide insulated, protected silicon wafers and prevented dopants from diffusing into the wafer. At Bell Labs, the importance of Frosch and Derick technique and transistors was immediately realized. Results of their work circulated around Bell Labs in the form of BTL memos before being published in 1957. At Shockley Semiconductor, Shockley had circulated the preprint of their article in December 1956 to all his senior staff, including Jean Hoerni, who would later invent the planar process in 1959 while at Fairchild Semiconductor. 
After this, J.R. Ligenza and W.G. Spitzer studied the mechanism of thermally grown oxides, fabricated a high quality Si/SiO2 stack and published their results in 1960. Following this research, Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng proposed a silicon MOS transistor in 1959 and successfully demonstrated a working MOS device with their Bell Labs team in 1960. Their team included E. E. LaBate and E. I. Povilonis who fabricated the device; M. O. Thurston, L. A. D’Asaro, and J. R. Ligenza who developed the diffusion processes, and H. K. Gummel and R. Lindner who characterized the device. This was a culmination of decades of field-effect research that began with Lilienfeld.
The first MOS transistor at Bell Labs was about 100 times slower than contemporary bipolar transistors and was initially seen as inferior. Nevertheless, Kahng pointed out several advantages of the device, notably ease of fabrication and its application in integrated circuits.

== Composition ==
Usually the semiconductor of choice is silicon. Some chip manufacturers, most notably IBM and Intel, use an alloy of silicon and germanium (SiGe) in MOSFET channels. Many semiconductors with better electrical properties than silicon, such as gallium arsenide, do not form good semiconductor-to-insulator interfaces, and thus are not suitable for MOSFETs. Research continues on creating insulators with acceptable electrical characteristics on other semiconductor materials.

To overcome the increase in power consumption due to gate current leakage, a high-κ dielectric is used instead of silicon dioxide for the gate insulator, while polysilicon is replaced by metal gates (e.g. Intel, 2009).

The gate is separated from the channel by a thin insulating layer, traditionally of silicon dioxide and later of silicon oxynitride. Some companies use a high-κ dielectric and metal gate combination in the 45 nanometer node.

When a voltage is applied between the gate and the source, the electric field generated penetrates through the oxide and creates an &quot;inversion layer&quot; or &quot;channel&quot; at the semiconductor-insulator interface. The inversion layer provides a channel through which current can pass between source and drain terminals. Varying the voltage between the gate and body modulates the conductivity of this layer and thereby controls the current flow between drain and source. This is known as enhancement mode.

== Operation ==
=== Metal–oxide–semiconductor structure ===
The traditional metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) structure is obtained by growing a layer of silicon dioxide () on top of a silicon substrate, commonly by thermal oxidation and depositing a layer of metal or polycrystalline silicon (the latter is commonly used). As silicon dioxide is a dielectric material, its structure is equivalent to a planar capacitor, with one of the electrodes replaced by a semiconductor.

When a voltage is applied across a MOS structure, it modifies the distribution of charges in the semiconductor. If we consider a p-type semiconductor (with &quot;N&quot;A the density of acceptors, &quot;p&quot; the density of holes; &quot;p = N&quot;A in neutral bulk), a positive voltage, &quot;V&quot;G, from gate to body (see figure) creates a depletion layer by forcing the positively charged holes away from the gate-insulator/semiconductor interface, leaving exposed a carrier-free region of immobile, negatively charged acceptor ions (see doping). If &quot;V&quot;G is high enough, a high concentration of negative charge carriers forms in an &quot;inversion layer&quot; located in a thin layer next to the interface between the semiconductor and the insulator.

Conventionally, the gate voltage at which the volume density of electrons in the inversion layer is the same as the volume density of holes in the body is called the threshold voltage. When the voltage between transistor gate and source (&quot;V&quot;G) exceeds the threshold voltage (&quot;V&quot;th), the difference is known as overdrive voltage.

This structure with p-type body is the basis of the n-type MOSFET, which requires the addition of n-type source and drain regions.

=== MOS capacitors and band diagrams ===

The MOS capacitor structure is the heart of the MOSFET. Consider a MOS capacitor where the silicon base is of p-type. If a positive voltage is applied at the gate, holes which are at the surface of the p-type substrate will be repelled by the electric field generated by the voltage applied. At first, the holes will simply be repelled and what will remain on the surface will be immobile (negative) atoms of the acceptor type, which creates a depletion region on the surface. A hole is created by an acceptor atom, e.g., boron, which has one less electron than a silicon atom. Holes are not actually repelled, being non-entities; electrons are attracted by the positive field, and fill these holes. This creates a depletion region where no charge carriers exist because the electron is now fixed onto the atom and immobile.

As the voltage at the gate increases, there will be a point at which the surface above the depletion region will be converted from p-type into n-type, as electrons from the bulk area will start to get attracted by the larger electric field. This is known as &quot;inversion&quot;. The threshold voltage at which this conversion happens is one of the most important parameters in a MOSFET.

In the case of a p-type MOSFET, bulk inversion happens when the intrinsic energy level at the surface becomes smaller than the Fermi level at the surface. This can be seen on a band diagram. The Fermi level defines the type of semiconductor in discussion. If the Fermi level is equal to the Intrinsic level, the semiconductor is of intrinsic, or pure type. If the Fermi level lies closer to the conduction band (valence band) then the semiconductor type will be of n-type (p-type).

When the gate voltage is increased in a positive sense this will shift the intrinsic energy level band so that it will curve downwards towards the valence band. If the Fermi level lies closer to the valence band (for p-type), there will be a point when the Intrinsic level will start to cross the Fermi level and when the voltage reaches the threshold voltage, the intrinsic level does cross the Fermi level, and that is what is known as inversion. At that point, the surface of the semiconductor is inverted from p-type into n-type.

If the Fermi level lies above the intrinsic level, the semiconductor is of n-type, therefore at inversion, when the intrinsic level reaches and crosses the Fermi level (which lies closer to the valence band), the semiconductor type changes at the surface as dictated by the relative positions of the Fermi and Intrinsic energy levels.

=== Structure and channel formation ===


A MOSFET is based on the modulation of charge concentration by a MOS capacitance between a &quot;body&quot; electrode and a &quot;gate&quot; electrode located above the body and insulated from all other device regions by a gate dielectric layer. If dielectrics other than an oxide are employed, the device may be referred to as a metal-insulator-semiconductor FET (MISFET). Compared to the MOS capacitor, the MOSFET includes two additional terminals (&quot;source&quot; and &quot;drain&quot;), each connected to individual highly doped regions that are separated by the body region. These regions can be either p or n type, but they must both be of the same type, and of opposite type to the body region. The source and drain (unlike the body) are highly doped as signified by a &quot;+&quot; sign after the type of doping.

If the MOSFET is an n-channel or nMOS FET, then the source and drain are &quot;n+&quot; regions and the body is a &quot;p&quot; region. If the MOSFET is a p-channel or pMOS FET, then the source and drain are &quot;p+&quot; regions and the body is a &quot;n&quot; region. The source is so named because it is the source of the charge carriers (electrons for n-channel, holes for p-channel) that flow through the channel; similarly, the drain is where the charge carriers leave the channel.

The occupancy of the energy bands in a semiconductor is set by the position of the Fermi level relative to the semiconductor energy-band edges.
With sufficient gate voltage, the valence band edge is driven far from the Fermi level, and holes from the body are driven away from the gate.

At larger gate bias still, near the semiconductor surface the conduction band edge is brought close to the Fermi level, populating the surface with electrons in an &quot;inversion layer&quot; or &quot;n-channel&quot; at the interface between the p region and the oxide. This conducting channel extends between the source and the drain, and current is conducted through it when a voltage is applied between the two electrodes. Increasing the voltage on the gate leads to a higher electron density in the inversion layer and therefore increases the current flow between the source and drain. For gate voltages below the threshold value, the channel is lightly populated, and only a very small subthreshold leakage current can flow between the source and the drain.

When a negative gate-source voltage (positive source-gate) is applied, it creates a &quot;p-channel&quot; at the surface of the n region, analogous to the n-channel case, but with opposite polarities of charges and voltages. When a voltage less negative than the threshold value (a negative voltage for the p-channel) is applied between gate and source, the channel disappears and only a very small subthreshold current can flow between the source and the drain. The device may comprise a silicon on insulator device in which a buried oxide is formed below a thin semiconductor layer. If the channel region between the gate dielectric and the buried oxide region is very thin, the channel is referred to as an ultrathin channel region with the source and drain regions formed on either side in or above the thin semiconductor layer. Other semiconductor materials may be employed. When the source and drain regions are formed above the channel in whole or in part, they are referred to as raised source/drain regions.

=== Modes of operation ===

The operation of a MOSFET can be separated into three different modes, depending on the voltages at the terminals. In the following discussion, a simplified algebraic model is used. Modern MOSFET characteristics are more complex than the algebraic model presented here.

For an &quot;enhancement-mode, n-channel MOSFET&quot;, the three operational modes are:

==== Cutoff, subthreshold, and weak-inversion mode====

When &quot;V&quot;GS &lt; &quot;V&quot;th:

where formula_1 is gate-to-source bias and formula_2 is the threshold voltage of the device.

According to the basic threshold model, the transistor is turned off, and there is no conduction between drain and source. A more accurate model considers the effect of thermal energy on the Fermi–Dirac distribution of electron energies which allow some of the more energetic electrons at the source to enter the channel and flow to the drain. This results in a subthreshold current that is an exponential function of gate-source voltage. While the current between drain and source should ideally be zero when the transistor is being used as a turned-off switch, there is a weak-inversion current, sometimes called subthreshold leakage.

In weak inversion where the source is tied to bulk, the current varies exponentially with formula_1 as given approximately by:

formula_4

where formula_5 = current at formula_6, the thermal voltage formula_7 and the slope factor &quot;n&quot; is given by:

formula_8

with formula_9 = capacitance of the depletion layer and formula_10 = capacitance of the oxide layer. This equation is generally used, but is only an adequate approximation for the source tied to the bulk. For the source not tied to the bulk, the subthreshold equation for drain current in saturation is

formula_11

In a long-channel device, there is no drain voltage dependence of the current once formula_12, but as channel length is reduced drain-induced barrier lowering introduces drain voltage dependence that depends in a complex way upon the device geometry (for example, the channel doping, the junction doping and so on). Frequently, threshold voltage &quot;V&quot;th for this mode is defined as the gate voltage at which a selected value of current &quot;I&quot;D0 occurs, for example, &quot;I&quot;D0 = 1μA, which may not be the same &quot;V&quot;th-value used in the equations for the following modes.

Some micropower analog circuits are designed to take advantage of subthreshold conduction. By working in the weak-inversion region, the MOSFETs in these circuits deliver the highest possible transconductance-to-current ratio, namely: formula_13, almost that of a bipolar transistor.

The subthreshold &quot;I–V curve&quot; depends exponentially upon threshold voltage, introducing a strong dependence on any manufacturing variation that affects threshold voltage; for example: variations in oxide thickness, junction depth, or body doping that change the degree of drain-induced barrier lowering. The resulting sensitivity to fabricational variations complicates optimization for leakage and performance.

====Triode mode or linear region (also known as the ohmic mode)====

When &quot;V&quot;GS &gt; &quot;V&quot;th and &quot;V&quot;DS &lt; &quot;V&quot;GS − &quot;V&quot;th:

The transistor is turned on, and a channel has been created which allows current between the drain and the source. The MOSFET operates like a resistor, controlled by the gate voltage relative to both the source and drain voltages. The current from drain to source is modeled as:

formula_14

where formula_15 is the charge-carrier effective mobility, formula_16 is the gate width, formula_17 is the gate length and formula_10 is the gate oxide capacitance per unit area. The transition from the exponential subthreshold region to the triode region is not as sharp as the equations suggest.

====Saturation or active mode====

When &quot;VGS &gt; V&quot;th and &quot;VDS&quot; ≥ (V&quot;GS – V&quot;th):

The switch is turned on, and a channel has been created, which allows current between the drain and source. Since the drain voltage is higher than the source voltage, the electrons spread out, and conduction is not through a narrow channel but through a broader, two- or three-dimensional current distribution extending away from the interface and deeper in the substrate. The onset of this region is also known as pinch-off to indicate the lack of channel region near the drain. Although the channel does not extend the full length of the device, the electric field between the drain and the channel is very high, and conduction continues. The drain current is now weakly dependent upon drain voltage and controlled primarily by the gate-source voltage, and modeled approximately as:

formula_19

The additional factor involving λ, the channel-length modulation parameter, models current dependence on drain voltage due to the Early effect, or channel length modulation. According to this equation, a key design parameter, the MOSFET transconductance is:

formula_20

where the combination &quot;V&quot;ov = &quot;V&quot;GS − &quot;V&quot;th is called the overdrive voltage, and where &quot;V&quot;DSsat = &quot;V&quot;GS − &quot;V&quot;th accounts for a small discontinuity in formula_21 which would otherwise appear at the transition between the triode and saturation regions.

Another key design parameter is the MOSFET output resistance &quot;rout&quot; given by:

formula_22.

&quot;r&quot;out is the inverse of &quot;g&quot;DS where formula_23. &quot;I&quot;D is the expression in saturation region.

If λ is taken as zero, an infinite output resistance of the device results that leads to unrealistic circuit predictions, particularly in analog circuits.

As the channel length becomes very short, these equations become quite inaccurate. New physical effects arise. For example, carrier transport in the active mode may become limited by velocity saturation. When velocity saturation dominates, the saturation drain current is more nearly linear than quadratic in &quot;V&quot;GS. At even shorter lengths, carriers transport with near zero scattering, known as quasi-ballistic transport. In the ballistic regime, the carriers travel at an injection velocity that may exceed the saturation velocity and approaches the Fermi velocity at high inversion charge density. In addition, drain-induced barrier lowering increases off-state (cutoff) current and requires an increase in threshold voltage to compensate, which in turn reduces the saturation current.

=== Body effect ===
The occupancy of the energy bands in a semiconductor is set by the position of the Fermi level relative to the semiconductor energy-band edges. Application of a source-to-substrate reverse bias of the source-body pn-junction introduces a split between the Fermi levels for electrons and holes, moving the Fermi level for the channel further from the band edge, lowering the occupancy of the channel. The effect is to increase the gate voltage necessary to establish the channel, as seen in the figure. This change in channel strength by application of reverse bias is called the &quot;body effect.&quot;

Using an nMOS example, the gate-to-body bias &quot;V&quot;GB positions the conduction-band energy levels, while the source-to-body bias VSB positions the electron Fermi level near the interface, deciding occupancy of these levels near the interface, and hence the strength of the inversion layer or channel.

The body effect upon the channel can be described using a modification of the threshold voltage, approximated by the following equation:

: formula_24

where &quot;V&quot;TB is the threshold voltage with substrate bias present, and &quot;V&quot;T0 is the zero-&quot;V&quot;SB value of threshold voltage, formula_25 is the body effect parameter, and 2&quot;φ&quot;B is the approximate potential drop between surface and bulk across the depletion layer when and gate bias is sufficient to ensure that a channel is present. As this equation shows, a reverse bias causes an increase in threshold voltage &quot;V&quot;TB and therefore demands a larger gate voltage before the channel populates.

The body can be operated as a second gate, and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;back gate&quot;; the body effect is sometimes called the &quot;back-gate effect&quot;.

== Circuit symbols ==
A variety of symbols are used for the MOSFET. The basic design is generally a line for the channel with the source and drain leaving it at right angles and then bending back at right angles into the same direction as the channel. Sometimes three line segments are used for enhancement mode and a solid line for depletion mode (see depletion and enhancement modes). Another line is drawn parallel to the channel for the gate.

The &quot;bulk&quot; or &quot;body&quot; connection, if shown, is shown connected to the back of the channel with an arrow indicating pMOS or nMOS. Arrows always point from P to N, so an NMOS (N-channel in P-well or P-substrate) has the arrow pointing in (from the bulk to the channel). If the bulk is connected to the source (as is generally the case with discrete devices) it is sometimes angled to meet the source leaving the transistor. If the bulk is not shown (as is often the case in IC design as they are generally common bulk) an inversion symbol is sometimes used to indicate PMOS, alternatively an arrow on the source may be used in the same way as for bipolar transistors (out for nMOS, in for pMOS).

Comparison of enhancement-mode and depletion-mode MOSFET symbols, along with JFET symbols. The orientation of the symbols, (most significantly the position of source relative to drain) is such that more positive voltages appear higher on the page than less positive voltages, implying conventional current flowing &quot;down&quot; the page:

In schematics where G, S, D are not labeled, the detailed features of the symbol indicate which terminal is source and which is drain. For enhancement-mode and depletion-mode MOSFET symbols (in columns two and five), the source terminal is the one connected to the triangle. Additionally, in this diagram, the gate is shown as an &quot;L&quot; shape, whose input leg is closer to S than D, also indicating which is which. However, these symbols are often drawn with a T-shaped gate (as elsewhere on this page), so it is the triangle which must be relied upon to indicate the source terminal.

For the symbols in which the bulk, or body, terminal is shown, it is here shown internally connected to the source (i.e., the black triangles in the diagrams in columns 2 and 5). This is a typical configuration, but by no means the only important configuration. In general, the MOSFET is a four-terminal device, and in integrated circuits many of the MOSFETs share a body connection, not necessarily connected to the source terminals of all the transistors.

== Applications ==
Digital integrated circuits such as microprocessors and memory devices contain thousands to billions of integrated MOSFETs on each device, providing the basic switching functions required to implement logic gates and data storage. Discrete devices are widely used in applications such as switch mode power supplies, variable-frequency drives and other power electronics applications where each device may be switching thousands of watts. Radio-frequency amplifiers up to the UHF spectrum use MOSFET transistors as analog signal and power amplifiers. Radio systems also use MOSFETs as oscillators, or mixers to convert frequencies. MOSFET devices are also applied in audio-frequency power amplifiers for public address systems, sound reinforcement and home and automobile sound systems

=== MOS integrated circuits ===
Following the development of clean rooms to reduce contamination to levels never before thought necessary, and of photolithography and the planar process to allow circuits to be made in very few steps, the Si–SiO2 system possessed the technical attractions of low cost of production (on a per circuit basis) and ease of integration. Largely because of these two factors, the MOSFET has become the most widely used type of transistor in the Institution of Engineering and Technology (IET).

General Microelectronics introduced the first commercial MOS integrated circuit in 1964.
Additionally, the method of coupling two complementary MOSFETs (P-channel and N-channel) into one high/low switch, known as CMOS, means that digital circuits dissipate very little power except when actually switched.

The earliest microprocessors starting in 1970 were all &quot;MOS microprocessors&quot;; i.e., fabricated entirely from PMOS logic or fabricated entirely from NMOS logic. In the 1970s, &quot;MOS microprocessors&quot; were often contrasted with &quot;CMOS microprocessors&quot; and &quot;bipolar bit-slice processors&quot;.

=== CMOS circuits ===
The MOSFET is used in digital complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (CMOS) logic, which uses p- and n-channel MOSFETs as building blocks. Overheating is a major concern in integrated circuits since ever more transistors are packed into ever smaller chips. CMOS logic reduces power consumption because no current flows (ideally), and thus no power is consumed, except when the inputs to logic gates are being switched. CMOS accomplishes this current reduction by complementing every nMOSFET with a pMOSFET and connecting both gates and both drains together. A high voltage on the gates will cause the nMOSFET to conduct and the pMOSFET not to conduct and a low voltage on the gates causes the reverse. During the switching time as the voltage goes from one state to another, both MOSFETs will conduct briefly. This arrangement greatly reduces power consumption and heat generation.

==== Digital ====
The growth of digital technologies like the microprocessor has provided the motivation to advance MOSFET technology faster than any other type of silicon-based transistor. A big advantage of MOSFETs for digital switching is that the oxide layer between the gate and the channel prevents DC current from flowing through the gate, further reducing power consumption and giving a very large input impedance. The insulating oxide between the gate and channel effectively isolates a MOSFET in one logic stage from earlier and later stages, which allows a single MOSFET output to drive a considerable number of MOSFET inputs. Bipolar transistor-based logic (such as TTL) does not have such a high fanout capacity. This isolation also makes it easier for the designers to ignore to some extent loading effects between logic stages independently. That extent is defined by the operating frequency: as frequencies increase, the input impedance of the MOSFETs decreases.

==== Analog ====
The MOSFET&#x27;s advantages in digital circuits do not translate into supremacy in all analog circuits. The two types of circuit draw upon different features of transistor behavior. Digital circuits switch, spending most of their time either fully on or fully off. The transition from one to the other is only of concern with regards to speed and charge required. Analog circuits depend on operation in the transition region where small changes to &quot;V&quot; can modulate the output (drain) current. The JFET and bipolar junction transistor (BJT) are preferred for accurate matching (of adjacent devices in integrated circuits), higher transconductance and certain temperature characteristics which simplify keeping performance predictable as circuit temperature varies.

Nevertheless, MOSFETs are widely used in many types of analog circuits because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base). The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors follow a different scaling law. MOSFETs&#x27; ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical. In their linear region, MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch inductive loads because of tolerance to inductive kickback.

Some ICs combine analog and digital MOSFET circuitry on a single mixed-signal integrated circuit, making the needed board space even smaller. This creates a need to isolate the analog circuits from the digital circuits on a chip level, leading to the use of isolation rings and silicon on insulator (SOI). Since MOSFETs require more space to handle a given amount of power than a BJT, fabrication processes can incorporate BJTs and MOSFETs into a single device. Mixed-transistor devices are called bi-FETs (bipolar FETs) if they contain just one BJT-FET and BiCMOS (bipolar-CMOS) if they contain complementary BJT-FETs. Such devices have the advantages of both insulated gates and higher current density.

=== Analog switches ===
MOSFET analog switches use the MOSFET to pass analog signals when on, and as a high impedance when off. Signals flow in both directions across a MOSFET switch. In this application, the drain and source of a MOSFET exchange places depending on the relative voltages of the source and drain electrodes. The source is the more negative side for an N-MOS or the more positive side for a P-MOS. All of these switches are limited on what signals they can pass or stop by their gate-source, gate-drain and source–drain voltages; exceeding the voltage, current, or power limits will potentially damage the switch.

==== Single-type ====
This analog switch uses a four-terminal simple MOSFET of either P or N type.

In the case of an n-type switch, the body is connected to the most negative supply (usually GND) and the gate is used as the switch control. Whenever the gate voltage exceeds the source voltage by at least a threshold voltage, the MOSFET conducts. The higher the voltage, the more the MOSFET can conduct. An N-MOS switch passes all voltages less than &quot;V&quot; − &quot;V&quot;. When the switch is conducting, it typically operates in the linear (or ohmic) mode of operation, since the source and drain voltages will typically be nearly equal.

In the case of a P-MOS, the body is connected to the most positive voltage, and the gate is brought to a lower potential to turn the switch on. The P-MOS switch passes all voltages higher than &quot;V&quot; − &quot;V&quot; (threshold voltage &quot;V&quot; is negative in the case of enhancement-mode P-MOS).

==== Dual-type (CMOS) ====
This &quot;complementary&quot; or CMOS type of switch uses one P-MOS and one N-MOS FET to counteract the limitations of the single-type switch. The FETs have their drains and sources connected in parallel, the body of the P-MOS is connected to the high potential (&quot;V&quot;DD) and the body of the N-MOS is connected to the low potential (&quot;gnd&quot;). To turn the switch on, the gate of the P-MOS is driven to the low potential and the gate of the N-MOS is driven to the high potential. For voltages between &quot;V&quot;DD − &quot;V&quot;tn and &quot;gnd&quot; − &quot;V&quot;tp, both FETs conduct the signal; for voltages less than &quot;gnd&quot; − &quot;V&quot;tp, the N-MOS conducts alone; and for voltages greater than &quot;V&quot;DD − &quot;V&quot;tn, the P-MOS conducts alone.

The voltage limits for this switch are the gate-source, gate-drain and source-drain voltage limits for both FETs. Also, the P-MOS is typically two to three times wider than the N-MOS, so the switch will be balanced for speed in the two directions.

Tri-state circuitry sometimes incorporates a CMOS MOSFET switch on its output to provide for a low-ohmic, full-range output when on, and a high-ohmic, mid-level signal when off.

== Construction ==

=== Gate material ===
The primary criterion for the gate material is that it is a good conductor. Highly doped polycrystalline silicon is an acceptable but certainly not ideal conductor, and also suffers from some more technical deficiencies in its role as the standard gate material. Nevertheless, there are several reasons favoring use of polysilicon:

# The threshold voltage (and consequently the drain to source on-current) is modified by the work function difference between the gate material and channel material. Because polysilicon is a semiconductor, its work function can be modulated by adjusting the type and level of doping. Furthermore, because polysilicon has the same bandgap as the underlying silicon channel, it is quite straightforward to tune the work function to achieve low threshold voltages for both NMOS and PMOS devices. By contrast, the work functions of metals are not easily modulated, so tuning the work function to obtain low threshold voltages (LVT) becomes a significant challenge. Additionally, obtaining low-threshold devices on both PMOS and NMOS devices sometimes requires the use of different metals for each device type. 
# The silicon-SiO2 interface has been well studied and is known to have relatively few defects. By contrast many metal-insulator interfaces contain significant levels of defects which can lead to Fermi level pinning, charging, or other phenomena that ultimately degrade device performance.
# In the MOSFET IC fabrication process, it is preferable to deposit the gate material prior to certain high-temperature steps in order to make better-performing transistors. Such high temperature steps would melt some metals, limiting the types of metal that can be used in a metal-gate-based process.

While polysilicon gates have been the de facto standard for the last twenty years, they do have some disadvantages which have led to their likely future replacement by metal gates. These disadvantages include:

* Polysilicon is not a great conductor (approximately 1000 times more resistive than metals) which reduces the signal propagation speed through the material. The resistivity can be lowered by increasing the level of doping, but even highly doped polysilicon is not as conductive as most metals. To improve conductivity further, sometimes a high-temperature metal such as tungsten, titanium, cobalt, and more recently nickel is alloyed with the top layers of the polysilicon. Such a blended material is called silicide. The silicide-polysilicon combination has better electrical properties than polysilicon alone and still does not melt in subsequent processing. Also the threshold voltage is not significantly higher than with polysilicon alone, because the silicide material is not near the channel. The process in which silicide is formed on both the gate electrode and the source and drain regions is sometimes called salicide, self-aligned silicide.
* When the transistors are extremely scaled down, it is necessary to make the gate dielectric layer very thin, around 1 nm in state-of-the-art technologies. A phenomenon observed here is the so-called poly depletion, where a depletion layer is formed in the gate polysilicon layer next to the gate dielectric when the transistor is in the inversion. To avoid this problem, a metal gate is desired. A variety of metal gates such as tantalum, tungsten, tantalum nitride, and titanium nitride are used, usually in conjunction with high-κ dielectrics. An alternative is to use fully silicided polysilicon gates, a process known as FUSI.

Present high performance CPUs use metal gate technology, together with high-κ dielectrics, a combination known as &quot;high-κ, metal gate&quot; (HKMG). The disadvantages of metal gates are overcome by a few techniques:

# The threshold voltage is tuned by including a thin &quot;work function metal&quot; layer between the high-κ dielectric and the main metal. This layer is thin enough that the total work function of the gate is influenced by both the main metal and thin metal work functions (either due to alloying during annealing, or simply due to the incomplete screening by the thin metal). The threshold voltage thus can be tuned by the thickness of the thin metal layer.
# High-κ dielectrics are now well studied, and their defects are understood.
# HKMG processes exist that do not require the metals to experience high temperature anneals; other processes select metals that can survive the annealing step.

=== Insulator ===
As devices are made smaller, insulating layers are made thinner, often through steps of thermal oxidation or localised oxidation of silicon (LOCOS). For nano-scaled devices, at some point tunneling of carriers through the insulator from the channel to the gate electrode takes place. To reduce the resulting leakage current, the insulator can be made thinner by choosing a material with a higher dielectric constant. To see how thickness and dielectric constant are related, note that Gauss&#x27;s law connects field to charge as:

: formula_26

with &quot;Q&quot; = charge density, κ = dielectric constant, ε0 = permittivity of empty space and &quot;E&quot; = electric field. From this law it appears the same charge can be maintained in the channel at a lower field provided κ is increased. The voltage on the gate is given by:

: formula_27

with &quot;V&quot;G = gate voltage, &quot;V&quot;ch = voltage at channel side of insulator, and &quot;t&quot;ins = insulator thickness. This equation shows the gate voltage will not increase when the insulator thickness increases, provided κ increases to keep &quot;t&quot;ins / κ = constant (see the article on high-κ dielectrics for more detail, and the section in this article on gate-oxide leakage).

The insulator in a MOSFET is a dielectric which can in any event be silicon oxide, formed by LOCOS but many other dielectric materials are employed. The generic term for the dielectric is gate dielectric since the dielectric lies directly below the gate electrode and above the channel of the MOSFET.

=== Junction design ===
The source-to-body and drain-to-body junctions are the object of much attention because of three major factors: their design affects the current-voltage (&quot;I-V&quot;) characteristics of the device, lowering output resistance, and also the speed of the device through the loading effect of the junction capacitances, and finally, the component of stand-by power dissipation due to junction leakage.

The drain induced barrier lowering of the threshold voltage and channel length modulation effects upon &quot;I-V&quot; curves are reduced by using shallow junction extensions. In addition, &quot;halo&quot; doping can be used, that is, the addition of very thin heavily doped regions of the same doping type as the body tight against the junction walls to limit the extent of depletion regions.

The capacitive effects are limited by using raised source and drain geometries that make most of the contact area border thick dielectric instead of silicon.

These various features of junction design are shown (with artistic license) in the figure.

== Scaling ==

Over the past decades, the MOSFET (as used for digital logic) has continually been scaled down in size; typical MOSFET channel lengths were once several micrometres, but modern integrated circuits are incorporating MOSFETs with channel lengths of tens of nanometers. Robert Dennard&#x27;s work on scaling theory was pivotal in recognising that this ongoing reduction was possible. Intel began production of a process featuring a 32 nm feature size (with the channel being even shorter) in late 2009. The semiconductor industry maintains a &quot;roadmap&quot;, the ITRS, which sets the pace for MOSFET development. Historically, the difficulties with decreasing the size of the MOSFET have been associated with the semiconductor device fabrication process, the need to use very low voltages, and with poorer electrical performance necessitating circuit redesign and innovation (small MOSFETs exhibit higher leakage currents and lower output resistance).

Smaller MOSFETs are desirable for several reasons. The main reason to make transistors smaller is to pack more and more devices in a given chip area. This results in a chip with the same functionality in a smaller area, or chips with more functionality in the same area. Since fabrication costs for a semiconductor wafer are relatively fixed, the cost per integrated circuits is mainly related to the number of chips that can be produced per wafer. Hence, smaller ICs allow more chips per wafer, reducing the price per chip. In fact, over the past 30 years the number of transistors per chip has been doubled every 2–3 years once a new technology node is introduced. For example, the number of MOSFETs in a microprocessor fabricated in a 45 nm technology can well be twice as many as in a 65 nm chip. This doubling of transistor density was first observed by Gordon Moore in 1965 and is commonly referred to as Moore&#x27;s law. It is also expected that smaller transistors switch faster. For example, one approach to size reduction is a scaling of the MOSFET that requires all device dimensions to reduce proportionally. The main device dimensions are the channel length, channel width, and oxide thickness. When they are scaled down by equal factors, the transistor channel resistance does not change, while gate capacitance is cut by that factor. Hence, the RC delay of the transistor scales with a similar factor. While this has been traditionally the case for the older technologies, for the state-of-the-art MOSFETs reduction of the transistor dimensions does not necessarily translate to higher chip speed because the delay due to interconnections is more significant.

Producing MOSFETs with channel lengths much smaller than a micrometre is a challenge, and the difficulties of semiconductor device fabrication are always a limiting factor in advancing integrated circuit technology. Though processes such as ALD have improved fabrication for small components, the small size of the MOSFET (less than a few tens of nanometers) has created operational problems:

===Higher subthreshold conduction===
As MOSFET geometries shrink, the voltage that can be applied to the gate must be reduced to maintain reliability. To maintain performance, the threshold voltage of the MOSFET has to be reduced as well. As threshold voltage is reduced, the transistor cannot be switched from complete turn-off to complete turn-on with the limited voltage swing available; the circuit design is a compromise between strong current in the &quot;on&quot; case and low current in the &quot;off&quot; case, and the application determines whether to favor one over the other. Subthreshold leakage (including subthreshold conduction, gate-oxide leakage and reverse-biased junction leakage), which was ignored in the past, now can consume upwards of half of the total power consumption of modern high-performance VLSI chips.

===Increased gate-oxide leakage===
The gate oxide, which serves as insulator between the gate and channel, should be made as thin as possible to increase the channel conductivity and performance when the transistor is on and to reduce subthreshold leakage when the transistor is off. However, with current gate oxides with a thickness of around 1.2 nm (which in silicon is ~5 atoms thick) the quantum mechanical phenomenon of electron tunneling occurs between the gate and channel, leading to increased power consumption. Silicon dioxide has traditionally been used as the gate insulator. Silicon dioxide however has a modest dielectric constant. Increasing the dielectric constant of the gate dielectric allows a thicker layer while maintaining a high capacitance (capacitance is proportional to dielectric constant and inversely proportional to dielectric thickness). All else equal, a higher dielectric thickness reduces the quantum tunneling current through the dielectric between the gate and the channel.

Insulators that have a larger dielectric constant than silicon dioxide (referred to as high-κ dielectrics), such as group IVb metal silicates e.g. hafnium and zirconium silicates and oxides are being used to reduce the gate leakage from the 45 nanometer technology node onwards. On the other hand, the barrier height of the new gate insulator is an important consideration; the difference in conduction band energy between the semiconductor and the dielectric (and the corresponding difference in valence band energy) also affects leakage current level. For the traditional gate oxide, silicon dioxide, the former barrier is approximately 8 eV. For many alternative dielectrics the value is significantly lower, tending to increase the tunneling current, somewhat negating the advantage of higher dielectric constant. The maximum gate-source voltage is determined by the strength of the electric field able to be sustained by the gate dielectric before significant leakage occurs. As the insulating dielectric is made thinner, the electric field strength within it goes up for a fixed voltage. This necessitates using lower voltages with the thinner dielectric.

===Increased junction leakage===
To make devices smaller, junction design has become more complex, leading to higher doping levels, shallower junctions, &quot;halo&quot; doping and so forth, all to decrease drain-induced barrier lowering (see the section on junction design). To keep these complex junctions in place, the annealing steps formerly used to remove damage and electrically active defects must be curtailed increasing junction leakage. Heavier doping is also associated with thinner depletion layers and more recombination centers that result in increased leakage current, even without lattice damage.

===Drain-induced barrier lowering and &quot;V&quot;T roll off===
Drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL) and &quot;V&quot;T roll off: Because of the short-channel effect, channel formation is not entirely done by the gate, but now the drain and source also affect the channel formation. As the channel length decreases, the depletion regions of the source and drain come closer together and make the threshold voltage (&quot;V&quot;T) a function of the length of the channel. This is called &quot;V&quot;T roll-off. &quot;V&quot;T also becomes function of drain to source voltage &quot;V&quot;DS. As we increase the &quot;V&quot;DS, the depletion regions increase in size, and a considerable amount of charge is depleted by the &quot;V&quot;DS. The gate voltage required to form the channel is then lowered, and thus, the &quot;V&quot;T decreases with an increase in &quot;V&quot;DS. This effect is called drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL).

===Lower output resistance===
For analog operation, good gain requires a high MOSFET output impedance, which is to say, the MOSFET current should vary only slightly with the applied drain-to-source voltage. As devices are made smaller, the influence of the drain competes more successfully with that of the gate due to the growing proximity of these two electrodes, increasing the sensitivity of the MOSFET current to the drain voltage. To counteract the resulting decrease in output resistance, circuits are made more complex, either by requiring more devices, for example the cascode and cascade amplifiers, or by feedback circuitry using operational amplifiers, for example a circuit like that in the adjacent figure.

===Lower transconductance===
The transconductance of the MOSFET decides its gain and is proportional to hole or electron mobility (depending on device type), at least for low drain voltages. As MOSFET size is reduced, the fields in the channel increase and the dopant impurity levels increase. Both changes reduce the carrier mobility, and hence the transconductance. As channel lengths are reduced without proportional reduction in drain voltage, raising the electric field in the channel, the result is velocity saturation of the carriers, limiting the current and the transconductance.

===Interconnect capacitance===
Traditionally, switching time was roughly proportional to the gate capacitance of gates. However, with transistors becoming smaller and more transistors being placed on the chip, interconnect capacitance (the capacitance of the metal-layer connections between different parts of the chip) is becoming a large percentage of capacitance. Signals have to travel through the interconnect, which leads to increased delay and lower performance.

===Heat production===
The ever-increasing density of MOSFETs on an integrated circuit creates problems of substantial localized heat generation that can impair circuit operation. Circuits operate more slowly at high temperatures, and have reduced reliability and shorter lifetimes. Heat sinks and other cooling devices and methods are now required for many integrated circuits including microprocessors. Power MOSFETs are at risk of thermal runaway. As their on-state resistance rises with temperature, if the load is approximately a constant-current load then the power loss rises correspondingly, generating further heat. When the heatsink is not able to keep the temperature low enough, the junction temperature may rise quickly and uncontrollably, resulting in destruction of the device.

===Process variations===
With MOSFETs becoming smaller, the number of atoms in the silicon that produce many of the transistor&#x27;s properties is becoming fewer, with the result that control of dopant numbers and placement is more erratic. During chip manufacturing, random process variations affect all transistor dimensions: length, width, junction depths, oxide thickness &quot;etc.&quot;, and become a greater percentage of overall transistor size as the transistor shrinks. The transistor characteristics become less certain, more statistical. The random nature of manufacture means we do not know which particular example MOSFETs actually will end up in a particular instance of the circuit. This uncertainty forces a less optimal design because the design must work for a great variety of possible component MOSFETs. See process variation, design for manufacturability, reliability engineering, and statistical process control.

===Modeling challenges===
Modern ICs are computer-simulated with the goal of obtaining working circuits from the first manufactured lot. As devices are miniaturized, the complexity of the processing makes it difficult to predict exactly what the final devices look like, and modeling of physical processes becomes more challenging as well. In addition, microscopic variations in structure due simply to the probabilistic nature of atomic processes require statistical (not just deterministic) predictions. These factors combine to make adequate simulation and &quot;right the first time&quot; manufacture difficult.

== Other types ==

=== Dual-gate ===

The dual-gate MOSFET has a tetrode configuration, where both gates control the current in the device. It is commonly used for small-signal devices in radio frequency applications where biasing the drain-side gate at constant potential reduces the gain loss caused by Miller effect, replacing two separate transistors in cascode configuration. Other common uses in RF circuits include gain control and mixing (frequency conversion). The &quot;tetrode&quot; description, though accurate, does not replicate the vacuum-tube tetrode. Vacuum-tube tetrodes, using a screen grid, exhibit much lower grid-plate capacitance and much higher output impedance and voltage gains than triode vacuum tubes. These improvements are commonly an order of magnitude (10 times) or considerably more. Tetrode transistors (whether bipolar junction or field-effect) do not exhibit improvements of such a great degree.

The FinFET is a double-gate silicon-on-insulator device, one of a number of geometries being introduced to mitigate the effects of short channels and reduce drain-induced barrier lowering. The &quot;fin&quot; refers to the narrow channel between source and drain. A thin insulating oxide layer on either side of the fin separates it from the gate. SOI FinFETs with a thick oxide on top of the fin are called &quot;double-gate&quot; and those with a thin oxide on top as well as on the sides are called &quot;triple-gate&quot; FinFETs.

=== Depletion-mode ===
There are &quot;depletion-mode&quot; MOSFET devices, which are less commonly used than the standard &quot;enhancement-mode&quot; devices already described. These are MOSFET devices that are doped so that a channel exists even with zero voltage from gate to source. To control the channel, a negative voltage is applied to the gate (for an n-channel device), depleting the channel, which reduces the current flow through the device. In essence, the depletion-mode device is equivalent to a normally closed (on) switch, while the enhancement-mode device is equivalent to a normally open (off) switch.

Due to their low noise figure in the RF region, and better gain, these devices are often preferred to bipolars in RF front-ends such as in TV sets.

Depletion-mode MOSFET families include the BF960 by Siemens and Telefunken, and the BF980 in the 1980s by Philips (later to become NXP Semiconductors), whose derivatives are still used in AGC and RF mixer front-ends.

=== Metal–insulator–semiconductor field-effect transistor (MISFET) ===
Metal–insulator–semiconductor field-effect-transistor, or &quot;MISFET&quot;, is a more general term than &quot;MOSFET&quot; and a synonym to &quot;insulated-gate field-effect transistor&quot; (IGFET). All MOSFETs are MISFETs, but not all MISFETs are MOSFETs.

The gate dielectric insulator in a MISFET is a substrate oxide (hence typically silicon dioxide) in a MOSFET, but other materials can also be employed. The gate dielectric lies directly below the gate electrode and above the channel of the MISFET. The term &quot;metal&quot; is historically used for the gate material, even though now it is usually highly doped polysilicon or some other non-metal.

Insulator types may be:

* Silicon dioxide, in silicon MOSFETs 
* Organic insulators (e.g., undoped trans-polyacetylene; cyanoethyl pullulan, CEP), for organic-based FETs.

=== NMOS logic ===
For devices of equal current driving capability, n-channel MOSFETs can be made smaller than p-channel MOSFETs, due to p-channel charge carriers (holes) having lower mobility than do n-channel charge carriers (electrons), and producing only one type of MOSFET on a silicon substrate is cheaper and technically simpler. These were the driving principles in the design of NMOS logic which uses n-channel MOSFETs exclusively. However, neglecting leakage current, unlike CMOS logic, NMOS logic consumes power even when no switching is taking place. With advances in technology, CMOS logic displaced NMOS logic in the mid-1980s to become the preferred process for digital chips.

=== Power MOSFET ===

Power MOSFETs have a different structure. As with most power devices, the structure is vertical and not planar. Using a vertical structure, it is possible for the transistor to sustain both high blocking voltage and high current. The voltage rating of the transistor is a function of the doping and thickness of the N-epitaxial layer (see cross section), while the current rating is a function of the channel width (the wider the channel, the higher the current). In a planar structure, the current and breakdown voltage ratings are both a function of the channel dimensions (respectively width and length of the channel), resulting in inefficient use of the &quot;silicon estate&quot;. With the vertical structure, the component area is roughly proportional to the current it can sustain, and the component thickness (actually the N-epitaxial layer thickness) is proportional to the breakdown voltage.

Power MOSFETs with lateral structure are mainly used in high-end audio amplifiers and high-power PA systems. Their advantage is a better behaviour in the saturated region (corresponding to the linear region of a bipolar transistor) than the vertical MOSFETs. Vertical MOSFETs are designed for switching applications.

=== Double-diffused metal–oxide–semiconductor () ===
There are &quot;LDMOS&quot; (lateral double-diffused metal oxide semiconductor) and &quot;VDMOS&quot; (vertical double-diffused metal oxide semiconductor). Most power MOSFETs are made using this technology.

=== Radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) ===
Semiconductor sub-micrometer and nanometer electronic circuits are the primary concern for operating within the normal tolerance in harsh radiation environments like outer space. One of the design approaches for making a radiation-hardened-by-design (RHBD) device is enclosed-layout-transistor (ELT). Normally, the gate of the MOSFET surrounds the drain, which is placed in the center of the ELT. The source of the MOSFET surrounds the gate. Another RHBD MOSFET is called H-Gate. Both of these transistors have very low leakage currents with respect to radiation. However, they are large in size and take up more space on silicon than a standard MOSFET. In older STI (shallow trench isolation) designs, radiation strikes near the silicon oxide region cause the channel inversion at the corners of the standard MOSFET due to accumulation of radiation induced trapped charges. If the charges are large enough, the accumulated charges affect STI surface edges along the channel near the channel interface (gate) of the standard MOSFET. This causes a device channel inversion to occur along the channel edges, creating an off-state leakage path. Subsequently, the device turns on; this process severely degrades the reliability of circuits. The ELT offers many advantages, including an improvement of reliability by reducing unwanted surface inversion at the gate edges which occurs in the standard MOSFET. Since the gate edges are enclosed in ELT, there is no gate oxide edge (STI at gate interface), and thus the transistor off-state leakage is reduced very much. Low-power microelectronic circuits including computers, communication devices, and monitoring systems in space shuttles and satellites are very different from what is used on earth. They are radiation (high-speed atomic particles like proton and neutron, solar flare magnetic energy dissipation in Earth&#x27;s space, energetic cosmic rays like X-ray, gamma ray etc.) tolerant circuits. These special electronics are designed by applying different techniques using RHBD MOSFETs to ensure safe space journeys and safe space-walks of astronauts.

<text>The junction field-effect transistor (JFET) is one of the simplest types of field-effect transistor. JFETs are three-terminal semiconductor devices that can be used as electronically controlled switches or resistors, or to build amplifiers. 

Unlike bipolar junction transistors, JFETs are exclusively voltage-controlled in that they do not need a biasing current. Electric charge flows through a semiconducting channel between &quot;source&quot; and &quot;drain&quot; terminals. By applying a reverse bias voltage to a &quot;gate&quot; terminal, the channel is &quot;pinched&quot;, so that the electric current is impeded or switched off completely. A JFET is usually conducting when there is zero voltage between its gate and source terminals. If a potential difference of the proper polarity is applied between its gate and source terminals, the JFET will be more resistive to current flow, which means less current would flow in the channel between the source and drain terminals.

JFETs are sometimes referred to as depletion-mode devices, as they rely on the principle of a depletion region, which is devoid of majority charge carriers. The depletion region has to be closed to enable current to flow.

JFETs can have an n-type or p-type channel. In the n-type, if the voltage applied to the gate is negative with respect to the source, the current will be reduced (similarly in the p-type, if the voltage applied to the gate is positive with respect to the source). Because a JFET in a common source or common drain configuration has a large input impedance (sometimes on the order of 1010 ohms), little current is drawn from circuits used as input to the gate.

== History ==
A succession of FET-like devices was patented by Julius Lilienfeld in the 1920s and 1930s. However, materials science and fabrication technology would require decades of advances before FETs could actually be manufactured.

JFET was first patented by Heinrich Welker in 1945. During the 1940s, researchers John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain, and William Shockley were trying to build a FET, but failed in their repeated attempts. They discovered the point-contact transistor in the course of trying to diagnose the reasons for their failures. Following Shockley&#x27;s theoretical treatment on JFET in 1952, a working practical JFET was made in 1953 by George C. Dacey and Ian M. Ross. Japanese engineers Jun-ichi Nishizawa and Y. Watanabe applied for a patent for a similar device in 1950 termed static induction transistor (SIT). The SIT is a type of JFET with a short channel.

High-speed, high-voltage switching with JFETs became technically feasible following the commercial introduction of Silicon carbide (SiC) wide-bandgap devices in 2008. Due to early difficulties in manufacturing — in particular, inconsistencies and low yield — SiC JFETs remained a niche product at first, with correspondingly high costs. By 2018, these manufacturing issues had been mostly resolved. By then, SiC JFETs were also commonly used in conjunction with conventional low-voltage Silicon MOSFETs. In this combination, SiC JFET + Si MOSFET devices have the advantages of wide band-gap devices as well as the easy gate drive of MOSFETs.

== Structure ==
The JFET is a long channel of semiconductor material, doped to contain an abundance of positive charge carriers or holes (&quot;p-type&quot;), or of negative carriers or electrons (&quot;n-type&quot;). Ohmic contacts at each end form the source (S) and the drain (D). A pn-junction is formed on one or both sides of the channel, or surrounding it using a region with doping opposite to that of the channel, and biased using an ohmic gate contact (G).

== Functions ==
JFET operation can be compared to that of a garden hose. The flow of water through a hose can be controlled by squeezing it to reduce the cross section and the flow of electric charge through a JFET is controlled by constricting the current-carrying channel. The current also depends on the electric field between source and drain (analogous to the difference in pressure on either end of the hose). This current dependency is not supported by the characteristics shown in the diagram above a certain applied voltage. This is the &quot;saturation region&quot;, and the JFET is normally operated in this constant-current region where device current is virtually unaffected by drain-source voltage. The JFET shares this constant-current characteristic with junction transistors and with thermionic tube (valve) tetrodes and pentodes.

Constriction of the conducting channel is accomplished using the field effect: a voltage between the gate and the source is applied to reverse bias the gate-source pn-junction, thereby widening the depletion layer of this junction (see top figure), encroaching upon the conducting channel and restricting its cross-sectional area. The depletion layer is so-called because it is depleted of mobile carriers and so is electrically non-conducting for practical purposes.

When the depletion layer spans the width of the conduction channel, &quot;pinch-off&quot; is achieved and drain-to-source conduction stops. Pinch-off occurs at a particular reverse bias (&quot;V&quot;GS) of the gate–source junction. The &quot;pinch-off voltage&quot; (Vp) (also known as &quot;threshold voltage&quot; or &quot;cut-off voltage&quot;) varies considerably, even among devices of the same type. For example, &quot;V&quot;GS(off) for the Temic J202 device varies from to , while the &quot;V&quot;GS(off) for the J308 varies between and . (Confusingly, the term &quot;pinch-off voltage&quot; is also used to refer to the &quot;V&quot;DS value that separates the linear and saturation regions.)

To switch off an n-channel device requires a negative gate–source voltage (&quot;V&quot;GS). Conversely, to switch off a p-channel device requires positive &quot;V&quot;GS.

In normal operation, the electric field developed by the gate blocks source–drain conduction to some extent.

Some JFET devices are symmetrical with respect to the source and drain.

== Schematic symbols ==

The JFET gate is sometimes drawn in the middle of the channel (instead of at the drain or source electrode as in these examples). This symmetry suggests that &quot;drain&quot; and &quot;source&quot; are interchangeable, so the symbol should be used only for those JFETs where they are indeed interchangeable.

The symbol may be drawn inside a circle (representing the envelope of a discrete device) if the enclosure is important to circuit function, such as dual matched components in the same package.

In every case the arrow head shows the polarity of the P–N junction formed between the channel and the gate. As with an ordinary diode, the arrow points from P to N, the direction of conventional current when forward-biased. An English mnemonic is that the arrow of an N-channel device &quot;points in&quot;.

== Comparison with other transistors ==
At room temperature, JFET gate current (the reverse leakage of the gate-to-channel junction) is comparable to that of a MOSFET (which has insulating oxide between gate and channel), but much less than the base current of a bipolar junction transistor. The JFET has higher gain (transconductance) than the MOSFET, as well as lower flicker noise, and is therefore used in some low-noise, high input-impedance op-amps. Additionally the JFET is less susceptible to damage from static charge buildup.

== Mathematical model ==
=== Linear ohmic region ===
The current in N-JFET due to a small voltage &quot;V&quot;DS (that is, in the &quot;linear&quot; or &quot;ohmic&quot; or &quot;triode region&quot;) is given by treating the channel as a rectangular bar of material of electrical conductivity formula_1: 
: formula_2
where
: &quot;I&quot;D = drain–source current,
: &quot;b&quot; = channel thickness for a given gate voltage,
: &quot;W&quot; = channel width,
: &quot;L&quot; = channel length,
: &quot;q&quot; = electron charge = 1.6 C,
: &quot;μn&quot; = electron mobility,
: &quot;Nd&quot; = n-type doping (donor) concentration,
: &quot;V&quot;P = pinch-off voltage.

Then the drain current in the &quot;linear region&quot; can be approximated as

: formula_3

In terms of formula_4, the drain current can be expressed as

: formula_5

=== Constant-current region ===
The drain current in the &quot;saturation&quot; or &quot;active&quot; or &quot;pinch-off region&quot; is often approximated in terms of gate bias as

: formula_6

where &quot;I&quot;DSS is the saturation current at zero gate–source voltage, i.e. the maximum current that can flow through the FET from drain to source at any (permissible) drain-to-source voltage (see, e. g., the &quot;I&quot;–&quot;V&quot; characteristics diagram above).

In the &quot;saturation region&quot;, the JFET drain current is most significantly affected by the gate–source voltage and barely affected by the drain–source voltage.

If the channel doping is uniform, such that the depletion region thickness will grow in proportion to the square root of the absolute value of the gate–source voltage, then the channel thickness &quot;b&quot; can be expressed in terms of the zero-bias channel thickness &quot;a&quot; as

: formula_7

where 
: &quot;V&quot;P is the pinch-off voltage the gate–source voltage at which the channel thickness goes to zero,
: &quot;a&quot; is the channel thickness at zero gate–source voltage.

=== Transconductance ===
The transconductance for the junction FET is given by

: formula_8

where formula_9 is the pinchoff voltage, and &quot;I&quot;DSS is the maximum drain current. This is also called formula_10 or formula_11 (for transadmittance).

<text>The House of Babenberg was a noble dynasty of Austrian Dukes and Margraves. Descending from the Popponids and originally from Bamberg in the Duchy of Franconia (present-day Bavaria), the Babenbergs ruled the imperial Margraviate of Austria from its creation in 976 AD until its elevation to a duchy in 1156, and from then until the extinction of the line in 1246, whereafter they were succeeded by the House of Habsburg.

==Origin==

===Elder and Younger Houses of Babenberg===

The Babenberg family can be broken down into two distinct groups;

# The Elder or Franconian House of Babenberg. Their name refers to Babenburg Castle, the present site of Bamberg Cathedral. They also called &quot;Popponids&quot; after their progenitor Count Poppo of Grapfeld (d. 839–41). They were related to the Frankish Robertian dynasty and ancestors of the Franconian Counts of Henneberg and the House of Schweinfurt.
# The Younger or Austrian House of Babenberg, or simply the House of Babenberg, are the descendants of Margrave Leopold I, who ruled Austria from 976 onwards.

The second group claimed to have originated from the first, but scholars have not been able to verify that claim. In addition, a descent from the Bavarian Luitpolding dukes is assumed (though perhaps in maternal line).

===Popponids===
Like the French royal Capetian dynasty, the Elder Babenbergs likely descended from the Robertians. The earliest known Babenberg, Count Poppo I of Grapfeld, was first mentioned in 819 as a ruler in the &quot;gau&quot; of Grabfeld, a historic region in northeastern Franconia bordering on Thuringia. He may have been a descendant of the Robertian Count Cancor of Hesbaye.

One of Poppo&#x27;s sons, Henry, served as &quot;princeps militiae&quot; under King Louis the Younger and was sometimes called margrave (&quot;marchio&quot;) and duke (&quot;dux&quot;) in Franconia under King Charles the Fat of East Francia. He was killed fighting against the Vikings during the Siege of Paris in 886. Another son, Poppo II, was margrave in Thuringia from 880 to 892, when he was deposed by King Charles&#x27; successor Arnulf of Carinthia. The Popponids had been favoured by Charles the Fat, but Arnulf reversed this policy in favour of rivalling Conrad the Elder, a member of the Conradine dynasty from the Lahngau in Rhenish Franconia and relative of Arnulf&#x27;s consort Ota.

===Babenberg Feud===
The leaders of the Babenbergs were the sons of Duke Henry, who called themselves after their castle of Babenburg on the upper Main river, around which their possessions centered. The city of Bamberg was built around the ancestral castle of the family. The Conradines were led by Conrad the Elder and his brothers Rudolf and Gebhard, probably the sons of Count Udo of Neustria.

The rivalry between the Babenberg and Conradine families was intensified by their efforts to extend their authority in the region of the middle Main, and this quarrel, known as the &quot;Babenberg feud&quot;, came to a first head in 892, when King Arnulf deposed Poppo II as Thuringian ruler, appointing Conrad the Elder instead, and installed Conrad&#x27;s brother Rudolf as Bishop of Würzburg. The struggle intensified at the beginning of the 10th century during the troubled reign of Arnulf&#x27;s son King Louis the Child. Clashes of arms occurred in 902, when the Conradine laid siege to Babenburg Castle and arrested Adalhard of Babenberg. The next year, Adalhard was executed at the &quot;Reichstag&quot; of Forchheim; in return, the Babenbergs occupied the city of Würzburg and expelled Bishop Rudolf.

Meanwhile, Rudolf&#x27;s brother Gebhard was appointed Duke of Lotharingia in 903, and had to cope both with revolting nobles and the continuing attacks by Babenberg forces. Both sides met in the battle of Fritzlar on 27 February 906, where the Conradines won a decisive victory, although Conrad the Elder fell in the battle. Two of the Babenberg brothers were also killed. The third, Adalbert, was summoned before the imperial court by the regent Archbishop Hatto I of Mainz, a partisan of the Conradines. He refused to appear, held his own for a time in his castle at Theres against the king&#x27;s forces, but surrendered in 906, and in spite of a promise of safe-conduct by Hatto was beheaded.

Conrad the Younger became Duke of Franconia in 906 and King of East Francia (as Conrad I) in 911, while the Babenbergs lost their influence in Franconia.

==Margraves of Austria==
In 962, the Bavarian count Leopold I (&quot;Liupo&quot;), possibly a descendant of the Luitpolding duke Arnulf of Bavaria, was first mentioned as a faithful follower of Emperor Otto I. He remained a loyal supporter of Otto&#x27;s son and successor Otto II and in 976 appears as count of the Bavarian Eastern March, then a district not more than 60 miles in breadth on the eastern frontier of the duchy, which grew into the Margraviate of Austria. Leopold, who received the territory as a reward for his fidelity to Emperor Otto II during the uprising of Duke Henry II of Bavaria, extended its area down the Danube river into what is today Lower Austria at the expense of the retreating Magyars.

Leopold was succeeded in 994 by his son Henry I, who continued his father&#x27;s policy, was followed in 1018 by his brother Adalbert, whose marked loyalty to Emperor Henry II and his Salian successor Henry III was rewarded by many tokens of favour. Adalbert expanded the Austrian territory up to the present borders on the Leitha, March and Thaya rivers. He was succeeded in 1055 by his son, Ernest.

Leopold II, margrave from 1075, quarrelled with Emperor Henry IV during the Investiture Controversy, when he supported the papal side of Bishop Altmann of Passau. Though Leopold had to cope with the invading troops of Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia and was defeated at the 1082 Battle of Mailberg, the emperor was unable to oust him from his march or to prevent the succession of his son Leopold III in 1096. Between 1075 - 1095 the dynasty had its seat at Babenberg Castle of Gars am Kamp.

Leopold III supported Henry V, the son of Emperor Henry IV, in his rising against his father, but was soon drawn over to the emperor&#x27;s side. In 1106 he married the daughter of Henry IV, Agnes, widow of Duke Frederick I of Swabia. In 1125 he declined the royal crown in favour of Lothair of Supplinburg. His zeal in founding monasteries, such as Klosterneuburg Monastery, earned for him his surname &quot;the Pious&quot;, and canonization by Pope Innocent VIII in 1485. He is regarded as the patron saint of Lower and Upper Austria.

==Dukes of Austria==
One of Leopold&#x27;s younger sons was Bishop Otto of Freising. His eldest son Leopold IV became margrave in 1136, and in 1139 received the Duchy of Bavaria from the hands of King Conrad III, who had banned the Welf duke Henry the Proud.

Leopold&#x27;s brother Henry Jasomirgott (allegedly named after his favourite oath, &quot;Yes, so [help] me God!&quot;) was made Count Palatine of the Rhine in 1140, and became Margrave of Austria on Leopold&#x27;s death in 1141. Having married Gertrude, the widow of Henry the Proud, he was invested in 1143 with the Duchy of Bavaria, and resigned his office as count palatine. In 1147 he participated in the Second Crusade, and after his return, renounced Bavaria at the instance of the new king Frederick Barbarossa who gave the duchy of Bavaria to Henry the Proud&#x27;s son, Duke Henry the Lion of Saxony. As compensation for this, Austria, the capital of which had been transferred to Vienna about 1155, was elevated into a duchy according to the &quot;Privilegium Minus&quot;.

===Rise to power===
The second duke was Henry&#x27;s son Leopold V, who succeeded him in 1177 and took part in the crusades of 1182 and 1190 as well as the Third Crusade. In Palestine, he quarrelled with King Richard I of England, captured him on his homeward journey and handed him over to Emperor Henry VI. Leopold increased the territories of the Babenbergs by acquiring the Duchy of Styria under the will of his kinsman Duke Ottokar IV. He died in 1194, and Austria fell to one son, Frederick, and Styria to another, Leopold; but on Frederick&#x27;s death in 1198 they were again united by Leopold as Duke Leopold VI, surnamed &quot;the Glorious&quot;.

The new duke fought in the crusades in Spain, Egypt, and Palestine, but is more celebrated as a lawgiver, a patron of letters, and a founder of many towns. Under him Vienna became the centre of culture in Germany and the great school of Minnesingers. His later years were spent in strife with his son Frederick, and he died in 1230 at San Germano, now renamed Cassino, whither he had gone to arrange the peace between Emperor Frederick II and Pope Gregory IX.

===Extinction===
Frederick II, Leopold VI&#x27;s son by Theodora Angelina, succeeded his father as duke upon the elder man&#x27;s death in 1230. Frederick II soon earned the epithet &quot;the Quarrelsome&quot; from his ongoing disputes with the kings of Hungary and Bohemia and with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Duke Frederick deprived his mother and sisters of their possessions, was hated by his subjects on account of his oppressive rule, and, in 1236, was placed under the imperial ban and driven from Austria. However, he was later restored to his duchy when Emperor Frederick II was excommunicated. Subsequently, Duke Frederick II treated with Emperor Frederick II in vain to make Austria a kingdom.

The male line of the Babenbergs became extinct in 1246, when Frederick II was killed in battle (the Henneberg branch of the Franconian Babenbergs lived on until 1583 when its lands were divided among the two branches of the Wettin family).

Frederick&#x27;s heir general was Gertrude of Austria, the only child of his late elder brother, Henry of Austria by that man&#x27;s wife, Agnes of Thuringia. However, neither her husbands nor her son succeeded in settling the Babenberg inheritance under their power. Gertrude&#x27;s only surviving child, Agnes of Baden, tried to reclaim at least part of her inheritance through her third husband Ulrich II of Heunburg, but was unsuccessful.

After some years of struggle known as the or War of the Babenberg Succession (1246–1256/78/82), the Duchies of Austria and Styria fell to Ottokar II of Bohemia, and subsequently to Rudolph I of Habsburg, whose descendants were to rule Austria until 1918.

==Genetic legacy==

===Byzantine blood===
All the Babenberg dukes from Leopold V onward were descended from Byzantine emperors — Leopold&#x27;s mother, Theodora Komnene, being a granddaughter of the Emperor, John II Komnenos. Subsequently, Leopold V&#x27;s younger son, Leopold VI, also married a Byzantine princess (Theodora Angelina), as did his youngest son (by Theodora), Frederick II, who married &quot;Sophia Laskarina&quot;.

===The Babenbergs and the Habsburgs===
The next dynasty in Austria—the Habsburgs—were originally not descendants of the Babenbergs. It was not until the children of Albert I of Germany that the Babenberg blood was brought into the Habsburg line, though this blood was from the pre-ducal Babenbergs. A side effect of this marriage was the use of the Babenberg name &quot;Leopold&quot; by the Habsburgs for one of their sons.

The Habsburgs did eventually gain descent from the Babenberg dukes, though at different times. The first Habsburg line to be descended from the Babenbergs was the &quot;Albertine&quot; line. This was achieved through the marriage of Albert III, Duke of Austria to Beatrix of Nuremberg. As such, their son, Albert IV, Duke of Austria, was the first Habsburg duke who was descended from the Babenberg dukes. However, the male line of that branch of the Habsburgs died out in 1457 with Ladislas V Posthumus of Bohemia.

The next Habsburg line to gain Babenberg blood was the &quot;Styrian&quot; line, which occurred with the children of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, the latter of whom descended from Babenberg dukes. It was actually from Elizabeth of Austria, the sister of Ladislas V Posthumus of Bohemia, that the Styrian line gained their Babenberg blood.

The &quot;Spanish&quot; line was the last Habsburg line to gain Babenberg blood. Again it was via the previous Habsburg line to gain Babenberg blood (i.e. the Styrian) that the Spanish Habsburg gained their descent from the Babenbergs — Anna of Austria, the wife of Philip II of Spain and mother of Philip (from whom all subsequent Spanish Habsburgs were descended), was a male-line granddaughter of Ferdinand and Anna. As a result, after 1598, all Habsburg scions descended from the Babenberg Dukes.

<text>Sacrosanctum Concilium, the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, is one of the constitutions of the Second Vatican Council. It was approved by the assembled bishops by a vote of 2,147 to 4 and promulgated by Pope Paul VI on 4 December 1963. The main aim was to revise the traditional liturgical texts and rituals to reflect more fully fundamental principles, and be more pastorally effective in the changed conditions of the times, clarifying not only the role of ordained ministers but the modalities of appropriate participation of lay faithful in the Catholic Church&#x27;s liturgy, especially that of the Roman Rite. The title is taken from the opening lines of the document and means &quot;This Sacred Council&quot;.

==Title==
As is customary with Catholic documents, the name of this constitution, &quot;Sacred Council&quot; in Latin, is taken from the first line (&quot;incipit&quot;) of the document.

==&quot;Aggiornamento&quot; and participation of the laity==
One of the first issues considered by the council, and the matter that had the most immediate effect on the lives of individual Catholics, was the renewal of the liturgy. The central idea was &quot;aggiornamento&quot; of the traditional liturgical texts and rituals to reflect more fully fundamental principles, and be more pastorally effective in the changed conditions of the times, clarifying not only the role of ordained ministers but the modalities of appropriate participation of lay faithful.
Popes Pius X and Pius XII asked that the people be taught how to chant the responses at Mass and that they learn the prayers of the Mass in order to participate intelligently. Now the bishops decreed that: &quot;To promote active participation, the people should be encouraged to take part by means of acclamations, responses, psalmody, antiphons, and songs.&quot; Composers should &quot;produce compositions which ... [provide] for the active participation of the entire assembly of the faithful.&quot;

After centuries when, with the Mass in Latin, Catholic piety centred around popular devotions, the bishops decreed that &quot;Popular devotions ... should be so drawn up that they harmonize with the liturgical seasons, accord with the sacred liturgy, are in some fashion derived from it, and lead the people to it, since, in fact, the liturgy by its very nature far surpasses any of them.&quot;

==Implementation==
The council fathers established guidelines to govern the renewal of the liturgy, which included, allowed, and encouraged greater use of the vernacular (native language) in addition to Latin, particularly for the biblical readings and other prayers. Implementation of the council&#x27;s directives on the liturgy was to be carried out under the authority of Pope Paul VI by a special papal commission known as the Council for the Implementation of the Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy (or the &quot;Consilium&quot; for short), later incorporated in the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments, and, in the areas entrusted to them, by national conferences of bishops, which, if they had a shared language, were expected to collaborate in producing a common translation. In his encyclical letter of August 1964, &quot;Ecclesiam Suam&quot;, the pope called for the &quot;intelligent&quot; and &quot;zealous&quot; implementation of the constitution&#x27;s provisions on the ministry of the Word.

== Legacy ==
On 24 August 2017 Pope Francis emphasized that &quot;the reform of the liturgy is irreversible&quot; and called for continued efforts to implement the reforms, repeating what Pope Paul VI had said one year before he died: &quot;The time has come, now, to definitely leave aside the disruptive ferments, equally pernicious in one sense or the other, and to implement fully, according to its right inspiring criteria, the reform approved by us in application of the decisions of the council.&quot;

<text>The Cathedral and the Bazaar: Musings on Linux and Open Source by an Accidental Revolutionary (abbreviated CatB) is an essay, and later a book, by Eric S. Raymond on software engineering methods, based on his observations of the Linux kernel development process and his experiences managing an open source project, fetchmail. It examines the struggle between top-down and bottom-up design. The essay was first presented by Raymond at the Linux Kongress on May 27, 1997, in Würzburg, Germany, and was published as the second chapter of the sametitled book in 1999.

The illustration on the cover of the book is a 1913 painting by Lyubov Popova titled &quot;Composition with Figures&quot; and belongs to the collection of the State Tretyakov Gallery. The book was released under the Open Publication License v2.0 in 1999.

==Central thesis==
The software essay contrasts two different free software development models:

* The &quot;cathedral&quot; model, in which source code is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of software developers. GNU Emacs and GCC were presented as examples.
* The &quot;bazaar&quot; model, in which the code is developed over the Internet in view of the public. Raymond credits Linus Torvalds, leader of the Linux kernel project, as the inventor of this process. Raymond also provides anecdotal accounts of his own implementation of this model for the Fetchmail project.

The essay&#x27;s central thesis is Raymond&#x27;s proposition that &quot;given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&quot; (which he terms Linus&#x27;s law): the more widely available the source code is for public testing, scrutiny, and experimentation, the more rapidly all forms of bugs will be discovered. In contrast, Raymond claims that an inordinate amount of time and energy must be spent hunting for bugs in the Cathedral model, since the working version of the code is available only to a few developers.

==Lessons for creating good open source software==

Raymond points to 19 &quot;lessons&quot; learned from various software development efforts, each describing attributes associated with good practice in open source software development:
#Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer&#x27;s personal itch.
#Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
#Plan to throw one [version] away; you will, anyhow (copied from Frederick Brooks&#x27;s &quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;).
#If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
#When you lose interest in a program, your last duty to it is to hand it off to a competent successor.
#Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging.
#Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
#Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
#Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way around.
#If you treat your beta-testers as if they&#x27;re your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
#The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
#Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
#Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away. (Attributed to Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)
#Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
#When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible—and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
#When your [configuration] language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
#A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
#To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
#Provided the development coordinator has a communications medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.

==Legacy and reception==
In 1998, the essay helped the final push for Netscape Communications Corporation to release the source code for Netscape Communicator and start the Mozilla project; it was cited by Frank Hecker and other employees as an outside independent validation of his arguments. Netscape&#x27;s public recognition of this influence brought Raymond renown in hacker culture.

When O&#x27;Reilly Media published the book in 1999 it became one of the first complete, commercially distributed books published under the Open Publication License.

Marshall Poe, in his essay &quot;The Hive&quot;, likens Wikipedia to the bazaar model that Raymond defines. Jimmy Wales himself was inspired by the work (as well as arguments put forward in pre-Internet works, such as Friedrich Hayek&#x27;s article &quot;The Use of Knowledge in Society&quot;), arguing that &quot;It opened my eyes to the possibility of mass collaboration&quot;.

In 1999 Nikolai Bezroukov published two critical essays on Eric Raymond&#x27;s views of open source software, the second one called &quot;A second look at &quot;The Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot;&quot;. They produced a sharp response from Eric Raymond.

Curtis Yarvin&#x27;s essay &quot;The Cathedral or the Bizarre&quot;, which argues for the end of American democracy, is named after the Raymond essay.

<text> (, &quot;Joys and Hopes&quot;), the Pastoral Constitution on the Church in the Modern World, is one of the four constitutions promulgated during the Second Vatican Council between 1963 and 1965. Issued on 7 December 1965, it was the last and longest published document from the council and is the first constitution published by a Catholic ecumenical council to address the entire world. 

 clarified and reoriented the role of the church&#x27;s mission to people outside of the Catholic faith. It was the first time that the church took explicit responsibility for its role in the larger world. The constitution&#x27;s creation was necessitated by fear of the irrelevance in the modern era due to its ignorance on problems that plague the modern world. The document represents an inner examination of the church by the council and features a response to problems affecting the modern world.

Within are the themes of gift of self and the promotion of peace. While initial reception of the document was focused on the shift in theological considerations, reception of today marks the document as a turning point in the Church&#x27;s focus on the world.

With the failure of the Church to respond promptly to major global events such as World War II and the Holocaust, Pope John XXIII began Vatican II with an emphasis on examining the role of the church in the world. This culminated with the creation of to address the role of the church in serving the world outside of Christianity. During the creation of the document itself, went through multiple versions of Schemas to reflect the idea Pope John XXIII wanted to achieve during the council. After long debate during the council over , the document came to cover a wide range of topics examining the inner workings of the Church and its interactions with the world as a whole. Such topics include marriage and family, the development of culture, economics, politics and peace and war.

Because of this role addressing how the Catholic Church relates towards the world at large, compared to the focus of on how the church understands itself, and have been called &quot;the two pillars of the Second Vatican Council.&quot;

Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 among the bishops assembled at the council, it was promulgated by Pope Paul VI on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended. As is customary with Catholic documents, the title is taken from its opening words in Latin &quot;the joys and hopes&quot;. The English translation begins:

== Background ==

=== Context within Vatican II ===
At the beginning of the Second Vatican Council on October 11, 1962, Pope John XXIII celebrated the opening Mass of the council, during which he indirectly brought to light the economic and political issues for which the council was summoned. Such issues included the devastation of World War II, Nazi horrors, the current threat of a nuclear war between the United States and Russia, and the end of colonialism and racism. The church had failed to act substantially on these issues, contributing to a feeling of irrelevance within larger considerations of the state of the world. From an ecclesiastical standpoint, there were open issues concerning completing the work of the interrupted First Vatican Council and the need for reform within the church. As a result of these problems, in his opening speech, Gaudet Mater Ecclesia, Pope John XXIII distanced the council from focusing solely on the gloom of the problems of the world as the Church had done in previous councils. He wanted the council to focus on &quot;the marvelous progress of the discoveries of human genius&quot;, while orienting the role of the church to one that should deal with right and wrong in the world. The council, as a whole, was to be an update to the essential inner workings and teachings of the church to better fit the modern world. was to be the culmination of this as Pope John XXIII envisioned the constitution to share in the &quot;joys and the hopes&quot; of the entire world.

Following the death of John XXIII, his successor Pope Paul VI also referred to the relationship between the church and the changing world in his first encyclical letter, &quot;Ecclesiam Suam&quot;.

=== The creation of the text of &quot;Gaudium et spes&quot; ===
 was not drafted before the council met, but arose from the floor of the council and was one of the last to be promulgated. In preparation for the council, Pope John XXIII asked for suggestions concerning the substance of Vatican II. In a large width of responses sorted through by a commission appointed by the Pope, there resulted in 67 thematic documents that would be placed for discussion during the council. Four of those documents, dealing with the church in the modern world, ultimately formed the logical backbone of what would become . In what is described as a turning point of the council, the harsh disagreement over the four documents drove the attendees to invalidate all 67 thematic documents as inadequate. This led to Pope John asking Cardinal Leo Jozef Suenens to create a new agenda for the council in November, 1962. The agenda was to include an examination on the Church and its role within the modern world, as necessitated by the debate over the four documents in question. By December 1962, Suenens revealed his work. The role of the church would be split between different viewpoints: &quot;Ad intra,&quot; internally, and &quot;ad extra,&quot; externally. These ultimately resulted in and , respectively. Schema 17 and, toward the end of the council, Schema 12 inspired the later creation of . Schema 12, while focusing on the church&#x27;s role in world social issues, underwent many changes before ultimately being rejected by the attendees over a lack of cohesion within the document.

Cardinal Suenens was again tasked with producing a new schema; however, Pope John XXIII died before its completion on June 3, 1963. Upon the election of Pope Paul VI on June 21, 1963, Pope Paul continued the creation of the document. When the revised Schema 12 was published in September 1963, it was met with intense scrutiny by the bishops. Ultimately, the schema, through multiple revisions that lasted until 1964, was transformed into Schema 13, which would become . Schema 13 not only related the role of the church to the world but also dealt with questions dealing with modern problems. On November 16, 1964, Schema 13 was approved to be edited after all of the Bishops&#x27; suggestions were aggregated. Father Pierre Haubtmann led a commission tasked with editing the schema. Over the period of the next year, Father Haubtmann led discussions and continued to develop the schema in line with discussion offered during the council. Approved by a vote of 2,307 to 75 of the bishops assembled at the council, Schema 13 was promulgated as by Pope Paul VI on 7 December 1965, the day the council ended.

== Overview ==

The Dogmatic Constitution, , was addressed &quot;not only to the sons of the Church and to all who invoke the name of Christ, but to the whole of humanity&quot; as part of the Second Council&#x27;s effort to appeal to the larger considerations of the Catholic Church.

Whereas the previous Vatican Council in 1869–70 had tried to defend the role of the church in an increasingly secular world, the Second Vatican Council focused on examining the role of the Church in the modern world.

 was adopted after &quot;Lumen Gentium&quot;, the Constitution on the Church, and it reflects the ecclesiological approach of that text. It also recognized and encouraged the role of the laity in the life of the Church in the world. The decree was debated at length and approved by much the largest and most international council in the history of the Church.

The ecumenical constitution created by the Second Vatican Council focused on the role of the church within the modern world. It was the last document promulgated during the Second Vatican Council and the first church document to place the church within the significance of the world. illustrated the church is aware of problems within the world and its responsibilities toward them. While world problems are a focus of the text, it also brings to light the human person and their orientation toward God as well as the mission of the church itself. The mission of the Church needed to recognize the realities of secularization and pluralism. Bishop Christopher Butler points out that a key principle behind the &quot;audacious change&quot; in this and in several earlier outward-looking documents of the council was that the Church is &quot;Christ himself using us as his instruments to bring salvation to all&quot;, and in charity we must &quot;presume that those who differ from us… are nevertheless [people] of good will&quot;. As a whole, represented an inner looking of the Church on itself so that it may take responsibility and comment on issues affecting the world.

Such issues of responsibilities in the world are highlighted by the cardinals of the council such as Leo Joseph Suenens of Belgium, who urged the council to take on social responsibility for war, poverty, and Third World suffering. This stance was supported by other prominent clergy members including Cardinal Giovanni Battista Montini of Milan, who became Pope Paul VI, and Cardinal Lercaro of Bologna. Additionally, Thomas Rosica points out that the Council Fathers &quot;... were men who had experienced two world wars, the horror of the Holocaust, the onset of the nuclear weaponry, the hostility of communism, the awesome and only partially understood impact of science and technology.&quot; In the Introduction it states: &quot;the Church has always had the duty of scrutinizing the signs of the times and of interpreting them in the light of the Gospel.&quot;

Marie-Dominique Chenu, professor of the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, &quot;Angelicum&quot; was influential in the composition of , as was Louis-Joseph Lebret. &quot;The problem of poverty and of overcoming it through a healthy economy, respectful of the primary value of the person, allows for a vast discussion on political ethics in .&quot; In the end, the &quot;council exhorts Christians, as citizens of two cities, to strive to discharge their earthly duties conscientiously and in response to the Gospel spirit&quot;.

== Contents ==

=== Central themes ===

==== Gift of self ====
The &quot;gift of self&quot; from GS §24 was a phrase used often by Pope John Paul II and particularly in his theology of the Body. This phrase has also been described as &quot;the Law of the Gift&quot;.

==== Promotion of peace ====
The final chapter of the document is &quot;The Fostering of Peace and the Promotion of a Community of Nations&quot;. This chapter references themes expressed near the start of Vatican II by Pope John XXIII in 1963 in his encyclical letter, Pacem in Terris.

== Reception ==

=== Immediately following Vatican II ===
Initial opposition came in the form of debate over the theological basis of Vatican II and . According to Henri de Lubac, the theological balance of nature and grace pre-Vatican II was overturned in favor of nature and the world which goes against the importance placed upon transcendence.

=== Reception today ===
 has been evaluated as the shift of the church to its new globalized view of the world. It serves as the basis for multiculturalism in the modern church and has become the basis of the church&#x27;s message to the world today. The document&#x27;s frequent references to &quot;the human heart&quot; and &quot;the heart of man&quot; are reflected in several quotations adopted by Pope Francis in his encyclical letter, &quot;Dilexit nos&quot;.

<text>London is a city in southwestern Ontario, Canada, along the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor. The city had a population of 422,324 according to the 2021 Canadian census. London is at the confluence of the Thames River and North Thames River, approximately from both Toronto and Detroit; and about from Buffalo, New York. The city of London is politically separate from Middlesex County, though it remains the county seat.
London and the Thames were named after the English city and river in 1793 by John Graves Simcoe, who proposed the site for the capital city of Upper Canada. The first European settlement was between 1801 and 1804 by Peter Hagerman. The village was founded in 1826 and incorporated in 1855. Since then, London has grown to be the largest southwestern Ontario municipality and Canada&#x27;s 11th largest metropolitan area, having annexed many of the smaller communities that surround it.
London is a regional centre of healthcare and education, being home to the University of Western Ontario (which brands itself &quot;Western University&quot;), Fanshawe College, and three major hospitals: Victoria Hospital, University Hospital and St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital. The city hosts a number of musical and artistic exhibits and festivals, which contribute to its tourism industry, but its economic activity is centered on education, medical research, manufacturing, financial services, and information technology. London&#x27;s university and hospitals are among its top ten employers. London lies at the junction of Highways 401 and 402, connecting it to Toronto, Windsor, and Sarnia. These highways also make the Detroit-Windsor, Port Huron-Sarnia, and Niagara Falls border crossings with the United States easily accessible. The city also has railway stations and bus stations and is home to the London International Airport.

== History ==
A series of archaeological sites throughout southwestern Ontario, named for the Parkhill Complex excavated near Parkhill, indicate the presence of Paleo-Indians in the area dating back approximately 11,000 years. Just prior to European settlement, the London area was the site of several Attawandaron, Odawa, and Ojibwe villages. The Lawson Site in northwest London is an archaeological excavation and partial reconstruction of an approximately 500-year-old Neutral Iroquoian village, estimated to have been home to 2,000 people. These groups were driven out by the Iroquois by in the Beaver Wars. The Iroquois abandoned the region some 50 years later, driven out by the Ojibwa. An Anishinaabeg community site was described as located near the forks of Thames River (Anishinaabe language: Eshkani-ziibi, &quot;Antler River&quot;) in and was referred to as Pahkatequayang (&quot;Baketigweyaang&quot;:&quot;At the River Fork&quot; (lit: at where the by-stream is)).

Later, in the early 19th century, the Munsee-Delaware Nation (the Munsee are a subtribe of the Lenape or Delaware people), expelled from their homeland in Modern New Jersey and Eastern Pennsylvania after the creation of the United States.

The Oneida Nation of the Thames, Chippewas of the Thames First Nation, and Munsee-Delaware Nation reserves are located south-west of the city.

=== Settlement ===

The current location of London was selected as the site of the future capital of Upper Canada in 1793 by Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe, who also named the village which was founded in 1826. Originally, Simcoe had proposed to call it &quot;Georgiana&quot;, in honour of George III, the reigning monarch at that time. It did not become the capital Simcoe envisioned. Rather, it was an administrative seat for the area west of the actual capital, York (now Toronto). The London Township Treaty of 1796 with the Chippewa ceded the original town site on the north bank of the Thames (then known as the &quot;Escunnisepe&quot;) to Upper Canada.

London was part of the Talbot Settlement, named for Colonel Thomas Talbot, the chief administrator of the area, who oversaw the land surveying and built the first government buildings for the administration of the western Ontario peninsular region. Together with the rest of southwestern Ontario, the village benefited from Talbot&#x27;s provisions not only for building and maintaining roads but also for assignment of access priorities to main routes to productive land. Crown and clergy reserves then received preference in the rest of Ontario.

In 1814, the Battle of Longwoods took place during the War of 1812 in what is now Southwest Middlesex, near London. The retreating British Army were staying at Hungerford Hill when they were attacked by the Kentucky Mounted Riflemen. In 1827, a settlement was started Bryon when Cyrenius Hall built a gristmill.

In 1832, the new settlement suffered an outbreak of cholera. London proved a centre of strong Tory support during the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837, notwithstanding a brief rebellion led by Charles Duncombe. Consequently, the British government located its Ontario peninsular garrison there in 1838, increasing its population with soldiers and their dependents, and the business support populations they required. London was incorporated as a town in 1840.

On 13 April 1845, a fire destroyed much of London, which was then largely constructed of wooden buildings. One of the first casualties was the town&#x27;s only fire engine. The fire burned nearly of land, destroying 150 buildings, before it burned itself out later that day. One fifth of London was destroyed in the province&#x27;s first million-dollar fire.

=== Development ===

John Carling, Tory MP for London, gave three events to explain the development of London in a 1901 speech: the location of the court and administration in London in 1826, the arrival of the military garrison in 1838, and the arrival of the railway in 1853. 

The population in 1846 was 3,500. Brick buildings included a jail and court house, and large barracks. London had a fire company, a theatre, a large Gothic church, nine other churches or chapels, and two market buildings. The buildings that were destroyed by fire in 1845 were mostly rebuilt by 1846. Connection with other communities was by road, using mainly stagecoaches that ran daily. A weekly newspaper was published and mail was received daily by the post office. Two villages named Petersville and Kensington once stood where downtown London now is. Petersville was founded by Samuel Peters in 1853. Kensington was founded around about 1878. Petersville and Kensigton were amalgamated on 4 March 1881 to form London West.

On 1 January 1855, London was incorporated as a city (10,000 or more residents). In the 1860s, a sulphur spring was discovered at the forks of the Thames River while industrialists were drilling for oil. The springs became a popular destination for wealthy Ontarians, until the turn of the 20th century when a textile factory was built at the site, replacing the spa.

Records from 1869 indicate a population of about 18,000 served by three newspapers, churches of all major denominations and offices of all the major banks. Industries included several tanneries, oil refineries and foundries, four flour mills, the Labatt Brewing Company and the Carling brewery in addition to other manufacturing companies such as EMCO Wheaton. Both the Great Western and Grand Trunk railways had stops here. Several insurance companies also had offices in the city.

The Crystal Palace Barracks, an octagonal brick building with eight doors and forty-eight windows built in 1861, was used for events such the Provincial Agricultural Fair of Canada West held in London that year. It was visited by Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, Governor-General John Young, 1st Baron Lisgar and Prime Minister John A. Macdonald.

Long before the Royal Military College of Canada was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, adult male students underwent three-month-long military courses from 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in London. Established by Militia General Order in 1865, the school enabled Officers of Militia or Candidates for Commission or promotion in the Militia to learn Military duties, drill and discipline, to command a Company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company&#x27;s Officer. The school was not retained at Confederation, in 1867.
In 1875, London&#x27;s first iron bridge, the Blackfriars Street Bridge, was constructed. It replaced a succession of flood-failed wooden structures that had provided the city&#x27;s only northern road crossing of the river. A rare example of a wrought iron bowstring arch through truss bridge, the Blackfriars remains open to pedestrian and bicycle traffic, though it was temporarily closed indefinitely to vehicular traffic due to various structural problems and was once again reopened to vehicular traffic 1 December 2018. The Blackfriars, amidst the river-distance between the Carling Brewery and the historic Tecumseh Park (including a major mill), linked London with its western suburb of Petersville, named for Squire Peters of Grosvenor Lodge. That community joined with the southern subdivision of Kensington in 1874, formally incorporating as the municipality of Petersville. Although it changed its name in 1880 to the more inclusive &quot;London West&quot;, it remained a separate municipality until ratepayers voted for amalgamation with London in 1897, largely due to repeated flooding. The most serious flood was in July 1883, which resulted in serious loss of life and property devaluation. This area retains much original and attractively maintained 19th-century tradespeople&#x27;s and workers&#x27; housing, including Georgian cottages as well as larger houses, and a distinct sense of place. In 1897, London West was annexed to London.
London&#x27;s eastern suburb, London East, was (and remains) an industrial centre, which also incorporated in 1874. It was founded as Lilley&#x27;s Corners by Charles Lilley in 1854. Oil was discovered in the Petrolia area and Lilley&#x27;s Corners was chosen as the refining site because it was close to the railroad. The Ontario Car Works, the Great Western Gasworks and the London Street Railroad all had their headquarters in Lilley&#x27;s Corners. In 1872, Lilley&#x27;s Corners became a village. It was annexed to London in 1885. Attaining the status of town in 1881, it continued as a separate municipality until concerns over expensive waterworks and other fiscal problems led to amalgamation in 1885. The southern suburb of London, including Wortley Village, was collectively known as &quot;London South&quot;. Never incorporated, the South was annexed to the city in 1890, although Wortley Village still retains a distinct sense of place. The area started to be settled in the 1860s. In 1880, Polk&#x27;s &quot;Directory&quot; called London South &quot;a charming suburb of the City of London.&quot;. By contrast, the settlement at Broughdale on the city&#x27;s north end had a clear identity, adjoined the university, and was not annexed until 1961. Broughdale was named after Reverend Charles C. Brough, the Anglican Archdeacon of London who settled there in 1854. Broughdale started to grow when it was connected to the London Street Railroad in 1901, leading to a real estate bubble. A post office was opened in Broughdale on 1 July 1904 with Charles Watlers as postmaster. Broughdale was initially named Brough, but was renamed Broughdale in 1906 because it sounded better. In 1924, the University of Western Ontario was founded in the former Broughdale. After the founding of the university, Broughdale became more like a city and less like a village. Broughdale was incorporated as a village in 1930. In 1961, Broughdale was annexed to London.

Ivor F. Goodson and Ian R. Dowbiggin have explored the battle over vocational education in London, Ontario, in the 1900–1930 era. The London Technical and Commercial High School came under heavy attack from the city&#x27;s social and business elite, which saw the school as a threat to the budget of the city&#x27;s only academic high school, London Collegiate Institute.

The Banting House, a National Historic Site of Canada, is where Frederick Banting developed the ideas that led to the discovery of insulin. Banting lived and practiced in London for ten months, from July 1920 to May 1921. London is also the site of the Flame of Hope, which is intended to burn until a cure for diabetes is discovered.

London&#x27;s role as a military centre continued into the 20th century during the two World Wars, serving as the administrative centre for the Western Ontario district. In 1905, the London Armoury was built and housed the First Hussars until 1975. A private investor purchased the historic site and built a new hotel (Delta London Armouries, 1996) in its place, preserving the shell of the historic building. In the 1950s, two reserve battalions amalgamated and became London and Oxford Rifles (3rd Battalion), The Royal Canadian Regiment. This unit continues to serve today as 4th Battalion, The Royal Canadian Regiment. The Regimental Headquarters of The Royal Canadian Regiment remains in London at Wolseley Barracks on Oxford Street. The barracks are home to the First Hussars militia regiment as well.

=== Annexation to present ===
London annexed many of the surrounding communities in 1961, including Byron and Masonville, adding 60,000 people and more than doubling its area. After this amalgamation, suburban growth accelerated as London grew outward in all directions, creating expansive new subdivisions such as Westmount, Oakridge, Whitehills, Pond Mills, White Oaks and Stoneybrook.

On 1 January 1993, London annexed nearly the entire township of Westminster, a large, primarily rural municipality directly south of the city, including the police village of Lambeth. With this massive annexation, which also included part of London township, London almost doubled in area again, adding several thousand more residents. In the present day, London stretches south to the boundary with Elgin County, north and east to Fanshawe Lake, north and west to the township of Middlesex Centre (the nearest developed areas of it being Arva to the north and Komoka to the west) and east to Nilestown and Dorchester.

The 1993 annexation, made London one of the largest urban municipalities in Ontario. Intense commercial and residential development is presently occurring in the southwest and northwest areas of the city. Opponents of this development cite urban sprawl, destruction of rare Carolinian zone forest and farm lands, replacement of distinctive regions by generic malls, and standard transportation and pollution concerns as major issues facing London. The City of London is currently the eleventh-largest urban area in Canada, eleventh-largest census metropolitan area in Canada, and the sixth-largest city in Ontario.

===Disasters===
On Victoria Day, 24 May 1881, the stern-wheeler ferry &quot;SS Victoria&quot; capsized in the Thames River close to Cove Bridge in West London. Approximately 200 passengers drowned in the shallow river, making it one of the worst disasters in London&#x27;s history, and is now dubbed &quot;The Victoria Day Disaster&quot;. At the time, London&#x27;s population was relatively low; therefore it was hard to find a person in the city who did not have a family member affected by the tragedy.

Two years later, on 12 July 1883, the first of the two most devastating floods in London&#x27;s history killed 17 people. The second major flood, on 26 April 1937, destroyed more than a thousand houses across London, and caused over $50 million in damages, particularly in West London.

On 3 January 1898, the floor of the assembly hall at London City Hall collapsed, killing 23 people and leaving more than 70 injured. Testimony at a coroner&#x27;s inquest described the wooden beam under the floor as unsound, with knots and other defects reducing its strength by one fifth to one third.

After repeated floods, the Upper Thames River Conservation Authority in 1953 built Fanshawe Dam on the North Thames to control the downstream rivers. Financing for this project came from the federal, provincial, and municipal governments. Other natural disasters include a 1984 tornado that led to damage on several streets in the White Oaks area of South London.

On 11 December 2020, a partially-constructed apartment building just off of Wonderland Road in southwest London collapsed, killing two people and injuring at least four others. In January 2024, both Oxford County companies involved in the building&#x27;s construction were fined $400,000, with The Ministry of Labour, Immigration, Training and Skills Development declaring the companies had failed to &quot;provide proper information, instruction and supervision, specifically on the use of proper concrete measuring techniques on the project.&quot;

== Geography ==

The area was formed during the retreat of the glaciers during the last ice age, which produced areas of marshland, notably the Sifton Bog, as well as some of the most agriculturally productive areas of farmland in Ontario.

The Thames River dominates London&#x27;s geography. The North and South branches of the Thames River meet at the centre of the city, a location known as &quot;The Forks&quot; or &quot;The Fork of the Thames&quot;. The North Thames runs through the man-made Fanshawe Lake in northeast London. Fanshawe Lake was created by Fanshawe Dam, constructed to protect the downriver areas from the catastrophic flooding which affected the city in 1883 and 1937.

=== Climate ===
London has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with modestly warm summers, and cold and cloudy winters with frequent snow. 

Because of its location in the continent, London experiences large seasonal contrast, tempered to a point by the surrounding Great Lakes. The proximity of the lakes also ensure abundant cloud cover, particularly in late Fall and Winter. The summers are usually warm to hot and humid, with a July average of , and temperatures above occur on average 11 days per year. In 2016, however, temperatures rose above this temperature on more than 35 days, and in 2018, four heatwaves led to a peak humidex of . The city is affected by frequent thunderstorms due to hot, humid summer weather, as well as the convergence of breezes originating from Lake Huron and Lake Erie. The same convergence zone is responsible for spawning funnel clouds and the occasional tornado. Spring and autumn in between are not long, and winters are cold but with frequent thaws. 

Annual precipitation averages . Its winter snowfall totals are heavy, averaging about per year, although the localized nature of snow squalls means the total can vary widely from year to year as do accumulations over different areas of the city. Some of the snow accumulation comes from lake effect snow and snow squalls originating from Lake Huron, some to the northwest, which occurs when strong, cold winds blow from that direction. From 5 December 2010, to 9 December 2010, London experienced record snowfall when up to of snow fell in parts of the city. Schools and businesses were closed for three days and bus service was cancelled after the second day of snow.

The highest temperature ever recorded in London was on 6 August 1918. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 9 February 1934.

=== Parks ===
London has a number of parks. Victoria Park in downtown London is a major centre of community events, attracting an estimated 1 million visitors per year. Other major parks include Harris Park, Gibbons Park, Fanshawe Conservation Area (Fanshawe Pioneer Village), Springbank Park, White Oaks Park and Westminster Ponds. The city also maintains a number of gardens and conservatories. One of these, the Remembrance Gardens, commemorates those who died fighting in wars. In addition to an annual Remembrance Day gathering, it contains a poppy garden as a memorial to 1,200 who died in World War I, as well as a refurbished bell from the Netherlands.

== Economy ==

London&#x27;s economy is dominated by medical research, financial services, manufacturing, and information technology. Much of the life sciences and biotechnology related research is conducted or supported by the University of Western Ontario (partly through the Robarts Research Institute), which adds about C$1.5 billion to the London economy annually. Private companies in the industry like Alimentiv, PolyAnalytik, KGK Sciences and Sernova are also based in London. The largest employer in London is the London Health Sciences Centre, which employs 10,555 people.

Since the economic crisis of 2009, the city has transitioned to become a technology hub with a focus on the Digital Creative sector. As of 2016, London is home to 300 technology companies that employ 3% of the city&#x27;s labour force. Many of these companies have moved into former factories and industrial spaces in and around the downtown core, and have renovated them as modern offices. For example, Info-Tech Research Group&#x27;s London office is in a hosiery factory, and Arcane Digital moved into a 1930s industrial building in 2015. The Historic London Roundhouse, a steam locomotive repair shop built in 1887, is now home to Royal LePage Triland Realty, rTraction and more. Its redesign, which opened in 2015, won the 2015 Paul Oberman Award for Adaptive Re-Use from the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario. London is also home to StarTech.com, Diply, video game companies like Digital Extremes, Big Blue Bubble and Big Viking Games, and Voices.com, which provides voiceover artists a platform to advertise and sell their services to those looking for voiceover work.

A Ford plant in Talbotville became one of the casualties of the economic crisis in 2011, the site will soon be home to a major Amazon distribution center employing 2,000 workers by 2023.

London&#x27;s city centre mall was first opened in 1960 as Wellington Square with of leasable area, with Eaton&#x27;s and Woolworths as anchors. From 1986 to 1989, Campeau expanded Wellington Square into Galleria London with of leasable area and 200 stores including The Bay and Eaton&#x27;s. However, the early 1990s recession, following by the bankruptcy of Eaton&#x27;s in 1999 and then the departure of The Bay in 2000 resulted in only 20 stores left by 2001. Galleria London then began seeking non-retail tenants, becoming the home for London&#x27;s central library branch, and satellite campuses for both Fanshawe College and Western University. The complex was purchased and renamed to Citi Plaza by Citigroup in 2009. Citi Plaza has been redeveloped as a mixed use complex that blends retail, office, businesses, and education providers. Alongside Citi Cards Canada&#x27;s offices, in November 2016, CBC announced plans to move its expanded operations into the building.

Avant-garde noise-pioneers The Nihilist Spasm Band formed in downtown London in 1965. Between 1966 and 1972, the group held a Monday night residency at the York Hotel in the city&#x27;s core, which established it as a popular venue for emerging musicians and artists; known as Call the Office, the venue served as a hotbed for punk music in the late 1970s and 1980s and hosted college rock bands and weekly alternative-music nights until closing indefinitely in 2020.

In 2003, CHRW-FM developed The London Music Archives, an online music database that chronicled every album recorded in London between 1966 and 2006, and in 2019 the CBC released a documentary entitled &quot;London Calling&quot; which outlined &quot;The Secret Musical History of London Ontario&quot; (including its importance for the massively popular electronic-music duo Richie Hawtin and John Acquaviva).

Museum London, the city&#x27;s central Art Gallery, was established in 1940 (initially operated from the London Public Library, until 1980, when Canadian architect Raymond Moriyama was commissioned to design its current home at the forks of the Thames River). London is also home to the Museum of Ontario Archaeology, owned and operated by Western University; it is Canada&#x27;s only ongoing excavation and partial reconstruction of a prehistoric village—in this case, a Neutral Nation village. The Royal Canadian Regiment Museum is a military museum at Wolseley Barracks (a Canadian former Forces Base in the city&#x27;s Carling neighbourhood). The Secrets of Radar Museum was opened at Parkwood Hospital in 2003, and tells the story of the more than 6,000 Canadian World War II veterans who were recruited into a top-secret project during World War II involving radar. The London Regional Children&#x27;s Museum in South London provides hands-on learning experiences for children and was one of the first children&#x27;s museums established in Canada. The Canadian Medical Hall of Fame has its headquarters in downtown London and features a medical history museum.

Eldon House is the former residence of the prominent Harris Family and oldest surviving such building in London. The entire property was donated to the city of London in 1959 and is now a heritage site. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate The Eldon House&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage.

In addition to Museum London and The Forest City Gallery, London is also home to a number of other galleries and art spaces, including the McIntosh Gallery at Western University, TAP Centre for Creativity, and various smaller galleries such as the Thielsen Gallery, the Westland Gallery, the Michael Gibson Gallery, the Jonathon Bancroft-Snell Gallery, The Art Exchange, Strand Fine Art and others.

=== Theatre ===

London is home to the Grand Theatre, a professional proscenium arch theatre in Central London. The building underwent renovations in 1975 to restore the stage proscenium arch and to add a secondary performance space. The architectural firm responsible for the redesign was awarded a Governor General&#x27;s award in 1978 for their work on the venue. In addition to professional productions, the Grand Theatre also hosts the High School Project, a program unique to North America that provides high school students an opportunity to work with professional directors, choreographers, musical directors, and stage managers. The Palace Theatre, in Old East Village, originally opened as a silent movie theatre in 1929 and was converted to a live theatre venue in 1991. It is currently the home of the London Community Players, and as of 2016 is undergoing extensive historical restoration. The Original Kids Theatre Company, a nonprofit charitable youth organisation, currently puts on productions at the Spriet Family Theatre in the Covent Garden Market.

=== Literature ===
London serves as a core setting in Southern Ontario Gothic literature, most notably in the works of James Reaney. The psychologist Richard Maurice Bucke, author of &quot;Cosmic Consciousness: A Study in the Evolution of the Human Mind&quot; and Walt Whitman&#x27;s literary executor, lived and worked in London, where he was often visited by Whitman (the Maurice Bucke Archive are part of the Special Collections in The Weldon Library of Western University). Modern writers from this city include fantasy-fiction authors R. Scott Bakker and Kelley Armstrong, Man Booker Prize winner Eleanor Catton, Scotiabank Giller Prize winner Bonnie Burnard and distinguished nominee Joan Barfoot. Emma Donoghue, whose 2010 novel, &quot;Room&quot;, was adapted into a 2015 Academy Award-winning film of the same name, also lives in London. WordFest is an annual literary and creative arts festival that takes place each November.

=== Livability ===
In 2020 and 2021, house prices rose significantly across Canada. The average price of a home in Canada in March 2021 was $716,828, a 31.6% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, the average cost to purchase a home in London was $607,000 in January 2021; since then increasing to $641,072 in June 2021 according to LSTAR. As the COVID-19 pandemic has begun to decrease in severity, the housing market in London is showing signs of a cool-down according to some realtors. In April 2021, the Bank of Canada reported that the primary reason house prices had increased to such an unprecedented extent was due to housing inventory reaching record lows.

Nevertheless, the city&#x27;s cost of living remains lower than many other southern Ontario cities. London is known for being a medium-sized city with big city amenities, having over 422,000 residents as of the 2021 census yet having all of the services one could find in a large city, including two large-scale shopping malls, Masonville Place and White Oaks Mall, regional health care centres,the London International Airport, Boler Mountain skiing center and post secondary education hubs such as the University of Western Ontario and Fanshawe College. In mid-2021, London had an 8.75% cheaper cost of living, and 27.5% cheaper cost of rent, compared to nearby Toronto.

London has nine major parks and gardens throughout the city, many of which run along the Thames River and are interconnected by a series of pedestrian and bike paths, known as the Thames Valley Parkway. This path system is in length, and connects to an additional of bike and hiking trails throughout the city. The city&#x27;s largest park, Springbank Park, is and contains of trails. It is also home to Storybook Gardens, a family attraction open year-round.

The city includes many pedestrian walkways throughout its neighbourhoods. Newer settled areas in the northwest end of the city include long pathways between housing developments and tall grass bordering Snake Creek, a thin waterway connected to the Thames River. These walkways connect the neighbourhoods of Fox Hollow, White Hills, Sherwood Forest and the western portion of Masonville, also running through parts of Medway Valley Heritage Forest.

== Government and law ==
London&#x27;s municipal government is divided among fourteen councillors (one representing each of London&#x27;s fourteen wards) and the mayor. Josh Morgan was elected mayor in the 2022 municipal election. Until the elections in 2010, there was a Board of Control, consisting of four controllers and the mayor, all elected citywide.

Although London has many ties to Middlesex County, it has been a separate entity since 1855. The exception is the Middlesex County Courthouse and former jail, as the judiciary is administered directly by the province.

London was the first city in Canada (in May 2017) to decide to move a ranked choice ballot for municipal elections starting in 2018. Voters mark their ballots in order of preference, ranking their top three favourite candidates. An individual must reach 50 per cent of the total to be declared elected; in each round of counting where a candidate has not yet reached that target, the person with the fewest votes is dropped from the ballot and their second or third choice preferences reallocated to the remaining candidates, with this process repeating until a candidate has reached 50 per cent.

In 2001, the City of London first published their Facilities Accessibility Design Standards (FADS) which was one of the first North American municipal accessibility requirements to include Universal Design. It has since been adopted by over 50 municipalities in Canada and the United States.

=== City councillors ===
In addition to mayor Josh Morgan, the following councillors were elected in the 2022 municipal election for the 2022–2026 term:

=== Provincial ridings ===


The city includes four provincial ridings. In the provincial government, London is represented by New Democrats Terence Kernaghan (London North Centre), Teresa Armstrong (London—Fanshawe) and Peggy Sattler (London West), and Progressive Conservative Rob Flack (Elgin—Middlesex—London).

=== Federal ridings ===
The London and surrounding area includes four federal ridings. In the federal government, London is represented by Conservative Karen Vecchio (Elgin—Middlesex—London), Liberals Peter Fragiskatos (London North Centre) and Arielle Kayabaga (London West), and New Democrat Lindsay Mathyssen (London—Fanshawe).

=== Law enforcement and crime ===
==== Law enforcement ====

 the London Police Service (LPS) is headed by Chief of Police Thai Truong. He is supported by two deputy chiefs: Paul Bastien, in charge of operations, and Trish McIntyre, in charge of administration. The service is governed by a seven-member civilian police board, of which the current board chair is Ali Chabar, General Legal Counsel and Executive Officer with the Thames Valley District School Board c. As of December 2020, the LPS had the fewest police officers per capita in Southwestern Ontario. Its vehicles include light armoured vehicles donated by General Dynamics Land Systems, which the CBC observed in 2019 were rarely used.

==== Crime ====
Statistics from police indicate that total overall crimes in London held steady between 2010 and 2016, at roughly 24,000 to 27,000 incidents per year. The majority of incidents are property crimes, with violent crimes dropping markedly (up to about 20%) between 2012 and 2014 but rising again in 2015–2016. In July 2018, Police Deputy Chief Steve Williams was quoted as saying many crimes go unreported to police. However, in 2021, the city surpassed its 2005 homicide record, with the city reporting 16 murders with a rate of 3.8 per 100,000 people.

The city has been home to several high-profile incidents over the years such as the Ontario Biker War and the London Conflict, it was also the location where most of the trial for the Shedden Massacre took place.

Research by Michael Andrew Arntfield, a police officer turned criminology professor, has determined that on a per-capita basis, London had more active serial killers than any locale in the world from 1959 to 1984. Arntfield determined there were at least six serial killers active in London during this era. Some went unidentified, but known killers in London included Russell Maurice Johnson, Gerald Thomas Archer, and Christian Magee.

On 6 June 2021, the London, Ontario truck attack took place in the North West of the city. Four members of a Canadian Muslim family, two women aged 74 and 44, a 46-year-old man and a 15-year-old girl were all killed by a pickup truck, which jumped the curb and ran them over. The sole survivor was a 9-year-old boy. According to the London Police Service, they were deliberately targeted in anti-Islamic hate crime. Later on the same day, 20-year-old Nathaniel Veltman was arrested in the parking lot of a nearby mall. He was charged with four counts of first-degree murder and one count of attempted murder.

In September 2023, the trial for the accused began in Windsor, ON. This was the first time Canadian jurors heard legal arguments for terrorism related to white supremacy. Shortly after the attack, the accused told police, &quot;I admit it was terrorism...I was a ticking bomb, ready to go off.&quot; He also admitted that his hate towards minority groups began with looking for information online about Donald Trump&#x27;s election for U.S. president.

In February 2024 Veltman was sentenced to five life sentences with no possibility of parole for 25 years.

=== Civic initiatives ===

The City of London initiatives in Old East London are helping to create a renewed sense of vigour in the East London Business District. Specific initiatives include the creation of the Old East Heritage Conservation District under Part V of the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot;, special Building Code policies and Facade Restoration Programs.

London is home to heritage properties representing a variety of architectural styles, including Queen Anne, Art Deco, Modern, and Brutalist.

Londoners have become protective of the trees in the city, protesting &quot;unnecessary&quot; removal of trees. The City Council and tourist industry have created projects to replant trees throughout the city. As well, they have begun to erect metal trees of various colours in the downtown area, causing some controversy.

== Transportation ==
=== Road transportation ===

London is at the junction of Highway 401 that connects the city to Toronto and Windsor, and Highway 402 to Sarnia. Also, Highway 403, which diverges from the 401 at nearby Woodstock, provides ready access to Brantford, Hamilton, and the Niagara Peninsula. Many smaller two-lane highways also pass through or near London, including Kings Highways 2, 3, 4, 7 and 22. Some of these are no longer highways, as provincial downloading in the 1980s and 1990s put responsibility for most provincial highways on municipal governments. Nevertheless, these roads continue to provide access from London to nearby communities and locations in much of Western Ontario, including Goderich, Port Stanley and Owen Sound. A 4.5 km long section of Highbury Ave., connecting the east end of London to Highway 401, consists of an controlled-access highway with 100 km/h speed limits.
Wellington Road between Commissioners Road East and Southdale Road E is London&#x27;s busiest section of roadway, with more than 46,000 vehicles using the span on an average day London does not have any freeways passing directly through the city. City council rejected early plans for the construction of a freeway, and instead accepted the Veterans Memorial Parkway to serve the east end. Some Londoners have expressed concern the absence of a local freeway may hinder London&#x27;s economic and population growth, while others have voiced concern such a freeway would destroy environmentally sensitive areas and contribute to London&#x27;s suburban sprawl. Road capacity improvements have been made to Veterans Memorial Parkway (formerly named Airport Road and Highway 100) in the industrialized east end. However, the Parkway has received criticism for not being built as a proper highway; a study conducted in 2007 suggested upgrading it by replacing the intersections with interchanges.

=== Public transit ===
In the late 19th century, and the early 20th century, an extensive network of streetcar routes served London.

London&#x27;s public transit system is run by the London Transit Commission, which has 44 bus routes throughout the city. Although the city has lost ridership over the last few years, the commission is making concerted efforts to enhance services by implementing a five-year improvement plan. In 2015, an additional 17,000 hours of bus service was added throughout the city. In 2016, 11 new operators, 5 new buses, and another 17,000 hours of bus service were added to the network. London has started construction of a bus rapid transit network. Construction of this network was initially anticipated to begin in 2019, but after delays, changes to the design, construction started on the first BRT project, the Downtown Loop, in spring 2021 and will continue in phases until 2030. The project received C$170 million in funding from the Ontario government on January 15, 2018.

=== Cycling network ===

London has of cycling paths throughout the city, of which have been added since 2005. In June 2016, London unveiled its first bike corrals, which replace parking for one vehicle with fourteen bicycle parking spaces, and fix-it stations, which provide cyclists with simple tools and a bicycle pump, throughout the city. In September 2016, city council approved a new 15 year cycling master plan that will see the construction of an additional of cycling paths added to the existing network.

=== Intercity transport ===

London is on the Canadian National Railway main line between Toronto and Chicago (with a secondary main line to Windsor) and the Canadian Pacific Railway main line between Toronto and Detroit. Via Rail operates regional passenger service through London station as part of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, with connections to the United States. Via Rail&#x27;s London terminal is the fourth-busiest passenger terminal in Canada. In October 2021 GO Transit began a two-year pilot project providing commuter rail service between London and Toronto along the Kitchener line. The pilot project ended in October 2023.

London is also a destination for inter-city bus travellers. In 2009, London was the seventh-busiest Greyhound Canada terminal in terms of passengers. Greyhound Canada no longer operates, but other operators have entered the market, including Megabus and FlixBus that provide service throughout southwestern Ontario.

London International Airport (YXU) is the 12th busiest passenger airport in Canada and the 11th busiest airport in Canada by take-offs and landings. It is served by airlines including Air Canada Express, and WestJet, and provides direct flights to both domestic and international destinations, including Toronto, Orlando, Ottawa, Winnipeg, Calgary, Cancún, Vancouver, Varadero, Punta Cana, Montego Bay, Santa Clara, and Holguin.

=== Plans ===

Additional cycleways are planned for integration in road-widening projects, where there is need and sufficient space along routes. An expressway/freeway network is possible along the eastern and western ends of the city, from Highway 401 (and Highway 402 for the western route) past Oxford Street, potentially with another highway, joining the two in the city&#x27;s north end.

The city of London has assessed the entire length of the Veterans Memorial Parkway, identifying areas where interchanges can be constructed, grade separations can occur, and where cul-de-sacs can be placed. Upon completion, the Veterans Memorial Parkway would no longer be an expressway, but a freeway, for the majority of its length.

== Education ==

London public elementary and secondary schools are governed by four school boards – the Thames Valley District School Board, the London District Catholic School Board and the French first-language school boards (the &quot;Conseil scolaire Viamonde&quot; and the &quot;Conseil scolaire catholique Providence&quot; or CSC). The CSC has a satellite office in London.

There are also more than twenty private schools in the city.

The city is home to two post-secondary institutions: the University of Western Ontario (UWO) and Fanshawe College, a college of applied arts and technology. UWO, founded in 1878, has about 3,500 full-time faculty and staff members and almost 30,000 undergraduate and graduate students. The Richard Ivey School of Business, part of UWO, was formed in 1922. UWO has two affiliated colleges: Huron University College, founded in 1863 (also the founding college of UWO) and King&#x27;s University College, founded in 1954. As well as one former affiliated college; Brescia University College, founded in 1919 (Canada&#x27;s only university-level women&#x27;s college). All three are liberal arts colleges with religious affiliations: Huron with the Anglican Church of Canada and King&#x27;s and Brescia with the Roman Catholic Church.

Fanshawe College has an enrollment of approximately 15,000 students, including 3,500 apprentices and over 500 international students from more than 30 countries. It also has almost 40,000 students in part-time continuing education courses.

The Ontario Institute of Audio Recording Technology (OIART), founded in 1983, offers recording studio experience for audio engineering students.

Westervelt College is also in London. This private career college was founded in 1885 and offers several diploma programs.

<text>An optimizing compiler is a compiler designed to generate code that is optimized in aspects such as minimizing program execution time, memory usage, storage size, and power consumption. Optimization is generally implemented as a sequence of optimizing transformations, a.k.a. compiler optimizations algorithms that transform code to produce semantically equivalent code optimized for some aspect.

Optimization is limited by a number of factors. Theoretical analysis indicates that some optimization problems are NP-complete, or even undecidable. Also, producing perfectly &quot;optimal&quot; code is not possible since optimizing for one aspect often degrades performance for another. Optimization is a collection of heuristic methods for improving resource usage in typical programs.

== Categorization ==
===Local vs. global scope===
Scope describes how much of the input code is considered to apply optimizations.

Local scope optimizations use information local to a basic block. Since basic blocks contain no control flow statements, these optimizations require minimal analysis, reducing time and storage requirements. However, no information is retained across jumps.

Global scope optimizations, also known as intra-procedural optimizations, operate on individual functions. This gives them more information to work with but often makes expensive computations necessary. Worst-case assumptions need to be made when function calls occur or global variables are accessed because little information about them is available.

=== Peephole optimization ===
Peephole optimizations are usually performed late in the compilation process after machine code has been generated. This optimization examines a few adjacent instructions (similar to &quot;looking through a peephole&quot; at the code) to see whether they can be replaced by a single instruction or a shorter sequence of instructions. For instance, a multiplication of a value by two might be more efficiently executed by left-shifting the value or by adding the value to itself (this example is also an instance of strength reduction).

===Inter-procedural optimization===
Interprocedural optimizations analyze all of a program&#x27;s source code. The more information available, the more effective the optimizations can be. The information can be used for various optimizations, including function inlining, where a call to a function is replaced by a copy of the function body.

===Link-time optimization===
Link-time optimization (LTO), or whole-program optimization, is a more general class of interprocedural optimization. During LTO, the compiler has visibility across translation units which allows it to perform more aggressive optimizations like cross-module inlining and devirtualization.

===Machine and object code optimization===
Machine code optimization involves using an object code optimizer to analyze the program after all machine code has been linked. Techniques such as macro compression, which conserves space by condensing common instruction sequences, become more effective when the entire executable task image is available for analysis.

===Language-independent vs. language-dependent===
Most high-level programming languages share common programming constructs and abstractions, such as branching constructs (if, switch), looping constructs (for, while), and encapsulation constructs (structures, objects). Thus, similar optimization techniques can be used across languages. However, certain language features make some optimizations difficult. For instance, pointers in C and C++ make array optimization difficult; see alias analysis. However, languages such as PL/I that also support pointers implement optimizations for arrays. Conversely, some language features make certain optimizations easier. For example, in some languages, functions are not permitted to have side effects. Therefore, if a program makes several calls to the same function with the same arguments, the compiler can infer that the function&#x27;s result only needs to be computed once. In languages where functions are allowed to have side effects, the compiler can restrict such optimization to functions that it can determine have no side effects.

===Machine-independent vs. machine-dependent===
Many optimizations that operate on abstract programming concepts (loops, objects, structures) are independent of the machine targeted by the compiler, but many of the most effective optimizations are those that best exploit special features of the target platform. Examples are instructions that do several things at once, such as decrement register and branch if not zero.

The following is an instance of a local machine-dependent optimization. To set a register to 0, the obvious way is to use the constant &#x27;0&#x27; in an instruction that sets a register value to a constant. A less obvious way is to XOR a register with itself or subtract it from itself. It is up to the compiler to know which instruction variant to use. On many RISC machines, both instructions would be equally appropriate, since they would both be the same length and take the same time. On many other microprocessors such as the Intel x86 family, it turns out that the XOR variant is shorter and probably faster, as there will be no need to decode an immediate operand, nor use the internal &quot;immediate operand register&quot;; the same applies on IBM System/360 and successors for the subtract variant. A potential problem with this is that XOR or subtract may introduce a data dependency on the previous value of the register, causing a pipeline stall, which occurs when the processor must delay execution of an instruction because it depends on the result of a previous instruction. However, processors often treat the XOR of a register with itself or the subtract of a register from itself as a special case that does not cause stalls.

== Factors affecting optimization ==

;Target machine: Whether particular optimizations can and should be applied may depend on the characteristics of the target machine. Some compilers such as GCC and Clang parameterize machine-dependent factors so that they can be used to optimize for different machines.

;Target CPU architecture
* Number of registers: Registers can be used to optimize for performance. Local variables can be stored in registers instead of the stack. Temporary/intermediate results can be accessed in registers instead of slower memory.
* RISC vs. CISC: CISC instruction sets often have variable instruction lengths, often have a larger number of possible instructions that can be used, and each instruction could take differing amounts of time. RISC instruction sets attempt to limit the variability in each of these: instruction sets are usually constant in length, with few exceptions, there are usually fewer combinations of registers and memory operations, and the instruction issue rate (the number of instructions completed per time period, usually an integer multiple of the clock cycle) is usually constant in cases where memory latency is not a factor. There may be several ways of carrying out a certain task, with CISC usually offering more alternatives than RISC. Compilers have to know the relative costs among the various instructions and choose the best instruction sequence (see instruction selection).
* Pipelines: A pipeline is a CPU broken up into an assembly line. It allows the use of parts of the CPU for different instructions by breaking up the execution of instructions into various stages: instruction decode, address decode, memory fetch, register fetch, compute, register store, etc. One instruction could be in the register store stage, while another could be in the register fetch stage. Pipeline conflicts occur when an instruction in one stage of the pipeline depends on the result of another instruction ahead of it in the pipeline but not yet completed. Pipeline conflicts can lead to pipeline stalls: where the CPU wastes cycles waiting for a conflict to resolve. Compilers can &quot;schedule&quot;, or reorder, instructions so that pipeline stalls occur less frequently.
* Number of functional units: Some CPUs have several ALUs and FPUs that allow them to execute multiple instructions simultaneously. There may be restrictions on which instructions can pair with which other instructions (&quot;pairing&quot; is the simultaneous execution of two or more instructions), and which functional unit can execute which instruction. They also have issues similar to pipeline conflicts. Instructions can be scheduled so that the functional units are fully loaded.

;Machine architecture
* CPU cache size and type (direct mapped, 2-/4-/8-/16-way associative, fully associative): Techniques such as inline expansion and loop unrolling may increase the size of the generated code and reduce code locality. The program may slow down drastically if a highly used section of code (like inner loops in various algorithms) no longer fits in the cache as a result of optimizations that increase code size. Also, caches that are not fully associative have higher chances of cache collisions even in an unfilled cache.
* Cache/memory transfer rates: These give the compiler an indication of the penalty for cache misses. This is used mainly in specialized applications.

;Intended use
* Debugging: During development, optimizations are often disabled to speed compilation or to make the executable code easier to debug. Optimizing transformations, particularly those that reorder code, can make it difficult to relate the executable code to the source code.
* General-purpose use: Prepackaged software is often expected to run on a variety of machines that may share the same instruction set but have different performance characteristics. The code may not be optimized to any particular machine or may be tuned to work best on the most popular machine while working less optimally on others.
* Special-purpose use: If the software is compiled for machines with uniform characteristics, then the compiler can heavily optimize the generated code for those machines.

:Notable cases include code designed for parallel and vector processors, for which special parallelizing compilers are used.

:Firmware for an embedded system can be optimized for the target CPU and memory. System cost or reliability may be more important than the code speed. For example, compilers for embedded software usually offer options that reduce code size at the expense of speed. The code&#x27;s timing may need to be predictable, rather than as fast as possible, so code caching might be disabled, along with compiler optimizations that require it.

== Common themes ==
Optimization includes the following, sometimes conflicting themes.

;Optimize the common case: The common case may have unique properties that allow a &quot;fast path&quot; at the expense of a &quot;slow path&quot;. If the fast path is taken more often, the result is better overall performance.
;Avoid redundancy: Reuse results that are already computed and store them for later use, instead of recomputing them.
;Less code: Remove unnecessary computations and intermediate values. Less work for the CPU, cache, and memory usually results in faster execution. Alternatively, in embedded systems, less code brings a lower product cost.
;Fewer jumps by using &quot;straight line code&quot;, also called &quot;branch-free code&quot;: Less complicated code. Jumps (conditional or unconditional branches) interfere with the prefetching of instructions, thus slowing down code. Using inlining or loop unrolling can reduce branching, at the cost of increasing binary file size by the length of the repeated code. This tends to merge several basic blocks into one.
;Locality: Code and data that are accessed closely together in time should be placed close together in memory to increase spatial locality of reference.
;Exploit the memory hierarchy: Accesses to memory are increasingly more expensive for each level of the memory hierarchy, so place the most commonly used items in registers first, then caches, then main memory, before going to disk.
;Parallelize: Reorder operations to allow multiple computations to happen in parallel, either at the instruction, memory, or thread level.
;More precise information is better: The more precise the information the compiler has, the better it can employ any or all of these optimization techniques.
;Runtime metrics can help: Information gathered during a test run can be used in profile-guided optimization. Information gathered at runtime, ideally with minimal overhead, can be used by a JIT compiler to dynamically improve optimization.
;Strength reduction: Replace complex, difficult, or expensive operations with simpler ones. For example, replacing division by a constant with multiplication by its reciprocal, or using induction variable analysis to replace multiplication by a loop index with addition.

== Specific techniques ==
=== Loop optimizations ===

&quot;Loop optimization&quot; acts on the statements that make up a loop, such as a &quot;for&quot; loop, for example loop-invariant code motion. Loop optimizations can have a significant impact because many programs spend a large percentage of their time inside loops.

Some optimization techniques primarily designed to operate on loops include:

;Induction variable analysis: Roughly, if a variable in a loop is a simple linear function of the index variable, such as codice_1, it can be updated appropriately each time the loop variable is changed. This is a strength reduction and also may allow the index variable&#x27;s definitions to become dead code. This information is also useful for bounds-checking elimination and dependence analysis, among other things.

;Loop fission or loop distribution: Loop fission attempts to break a loop into multiple loops over the same index range with each new loop taking only a part of the original loop&#x27;s body. This can improve locality of reference to both the data being accessed within the loop and the code in the loop&#x27;s body.

;Loop fusion or loop combining or loop ramming or loop jamming: Another technique that attempts to reduce loop overhead. When two adjacent loops would iterate the same number of times regardless of whether that number is known at compile time, their bodies can be combined as long as they do not refer to each other&#x27;s data.

;Loop inversion: This technique changes a standard &quot;while&quot; loop into a &quot;do/while&quot; (also known as &quot;repeat/until&quot;) loop wrapped in an &quot;if&quot; conditional, reducing the number of jumps by two, for cases when the loop is executed. Doing so duplicates the condition check (increasing the size of the code) but is more efficient because jumps usually cause a pipeline stall. Additionally, if the initial condition is known at compile-time and is known to be side-effect-free, the &quot;if&quot; guard can be skipped.

;Loop interchange: These optimizations exchange inner loops with outer loops. When the loop variables index into an array, such a transformation can improve the locality of reference, depending on the array&#x27;s layout.

;Loop-invariant code motion: If a quantity is computed inside a loop during every iteration, and its value is the same for each iteration, it can vastly improve efficiency to hoist it outside the loop and compute its value just once before the loop begins. This is particularly important with the address-calculation expressions generated by loops over arrays. For correct implementation, this technique must be used with loop inversion, because not all code is safe to be hoisted outside the loop.

;Loop nest optimization: Some pervasive algorithms such as matrix multiplication have very poor cache behavior and excessive memory accesses. Loop nest optimization increases the number of cache hits by operating over small blocks and by using a loop interchange.

;Loop reversal: Loop reversal reverses the order in which values are assigned to the index variable. This is a subtle optimization that can help eliminate dependencies and thus enable other optimizations. Furthermore, on some architectures, loop reversal contributes to smaller code, as when the loop index is being decremented, the condition that needs to be met for the running program to exit the loop is a comparison with zero. This is often a special, parameter-less instruction, unlike a comparison with a number, which needs the number to compare to. Therefore, the amount of bytes needed to store the parameter is saved by using the loop reversal. Additionally, if the comparison number exceeds the size of word of the platform, in standard loop order, multiple instructions would need to be executed to evaluate the comparison, which is not the case with loop reversal.

;Loop unrolling: Unrolling duplicates the body of the loop multiple times, to decrease the number of times the loop condition is tested and the number of jumps; tests and jumps can hurt performance by impairing the instruction pipeline. A &quot;fewer jumps&quot; optimization. Completely unrolling a loop eliminates all overhead, but requires that the number of iterations be known at compile time.

;Loop splitting: Loop splitting attempts to simplify a loop or eliminate dependencies by breaking it into multiple loops that have the same bodies but iterate over different contiguous portions of the index range. A useful special case is &quot;loop peeling&quot;, which can simplify a loop with a problematic first iteration by performing that iteration separately before entering the loop.

;Loop unswitching: Unswitching moves a conditional from inside a loop to outside the loop by duplicating the loop&#x27;s body inside each of the if and else clauses of the conditional.

;Software pipelining: The loop is restructured in such a way that work done in an iteration is split into several parts and done over several iterations. In a tight loop, this technique hides the latency between loading and using values.

;Automatic parallelization: A loop is converted into multi-threaded or vectorized (or even both) code to use multiple processors simultaneously in a shared-memory multiprocessor (SMP) machine, including multi-core machines.

===Prescient store optimizations===
Prescient store optimizations allow store operations to occur earlier than would otherwise be permitted in the context of threads and locks. The process needs some way of knowing ahead of time what value will be stored by the assignment that it should have followed. The purpose of this relaxation is to allow compiler optimization to perform certain kinds of code rearrangements that preserve the semantics of properly synchronized programs.

=== Data-flow optimizations ===
Data-flow optimizations, based on data-flow analysis, primarily depend on how certain properties of data are propagated by control edges in the control-flow graph. Some of these include:

;Common subexpression elimination: In the expression codice_2, &quot;common subexpression&quot; refers to the duplicated codice_3. Compilers implementing this technique realize that codice_3 will not change, and so only calculate its value once.

;Constant folding and propagation: Replacing expressions consisting of constants (e.g., codice_5) with their final value (codice_6) at compile time, rather than doing the calculation in run-time. Used in most modern languages.

;Induction variable recognition and elimination: See discussion above about &quot;induction variable analysis&quot;.

;Alias classification and pointer analysis: In the presence of pointers, it is difficult to make any optimizations at all, since potentially any variable can have been changed when a memory location is assigned to. By specifying which pointers can alias which variables, unrelated pointers can be ignored.

;Dead-store elimination: Removal of assignments to variables that are not subsequently read, either because the lifetime of the variable ends or because of a subsequent assignment that will overwrite the first value.

=== SSA-based optimizations ===
These optimizations are intended to be done after transforming the program into a special form called Static Single Assignment, in which every variable is assigned in only one place. Although some function without SSA, they are most effective with SSA. Many optimizations listed in other sections also benefit with no special changes, such as register allocation.

;Global value numbering: GVN eliminates redundancy by constructing a value graph of the program, and then determining which values are computed by equivalent expressions. GVN can identify some redundancy that common subexpression elimination cannot, and vice versa.

;Sparse conditional constant propagation: Combines constant propagation, constant folding, and dead-code elimination, and improves upon what is possible by running them separately. This optimization symbolically executes the program, simultaneously propagating constant values and eliminating portions of the control-flow graph that this makes unreachable.

=== Code generator optimizations ===
;Register allocation: The most frequently used variables should be kept in processor registers for the fastest access. To find which variables to put in registers, an interference-graph is created. Each variable is a vertex and when two variables are used at the same time (have an intersecting liverange) they have an edge between them. This graph is colored using for example Chaitin&#x27;s algorithm using the same number of colors as there are registers. If the coloring fails one variable is &quot;spilled&quot; to memory and the coloring is retried.
;Instruction selection: Most architectures, particularly CISC architectures and those with many addressing modes, offer several different ways of performing a particular operation, using entirely different sequences of instructions. The job of the instruction selector is to do a good job overall of choosing which instructions to implement which operators in the low-level intermediate representation with. For example, on many processors in the 68000 family and the x86 architecture, complex addressing modes can be used in statements like codice_7, allowing a single instruction to perform a significant amount of arithmetic with less storage.
;Instruction scheduling: Instruction scheduling is an important optimization for modern pipelined processors, which avoids stalls or bubbles in the pipeline by clustering instructions with no dependencies together, while being careful to preserve the original semantics.
;Rematerialization: Rematerialization recalculates a value instead of loading it from memory, eliminating an access to memory. This is performed in tandem with register allocation to avoid spills.
;Code factoring: If several sequences of code are identical, or can be parameterized or reordered to be identical, they can be replaced with calls to a shared subroutine. This can often share code for subroutine set-up and sometimes tail-recursion.
;Trampolines: Many CPUs have smaller subroutine call instructions to access low memory. A compiler can save space by using these small calls in the main body of code. Jump instructions in low memory can access the routines at any address. This multiplies space savings from code factoring.
;Reordering computations: Based on integer linear programming, restructuring compilers enhance data locality and expose more parallelism by reordering computations. Space-optimizing compilers may reorder code to lengthen sequences that can be factored into subroutines.

=== Functional language optimizations ===
Although many of these also apply to non-functional languages, they either originate in or are particularly critical in functional languages such as Lisp and ML.

;Tail-call optimization: A function call consumes stack space and involves some overhead related to parameter passing and flushing the instruction cache. Tail-recursive algorithms can be converted to iteration through a process called tail-recursion elimination or tail-call optimization.

;Deforestation (data structure fusion): In languages where it is common for a sequence of transformations to be applied to a list, deforestation attempts to remove the construction of intermediate data structures.

;Partial evaluation: Computations that produce the same output regardless of the dynamic input at runtime can be evaluated at compile time.

=== Other optimizations ===
;Bounds-checking elimination: Many languages, such as Java, enforce bounds checking of all array accesses. This is a severe performance bottleneck on certain applications such as scientific code. Bounds-checking elimination allows the compiler to safely remove bounds checking in many situations where it can determine that the index must fall within valid bounds; for example, if it is a simple loop variable.

;Branch-offset optimization (machine dependent): Choose the shortest branch displacement that reaches the target.

;Code-block reordering: Code-block reordering alters the order of the basic blocks in a program to reduce conditional branches and improve the locality of reference.

;Dead-code elimination: Removes instructions that will not affect the behaviour of the program, for example, definitions that have no uses, called dead code. This reduces code size and eliminates unnecessary computation.

;Factoring out of invariants (loop invariants): If an expression is carried out both when a condition is met and is not met, it can be written just once outside of the conditional statement. Similarly, if certain types of expressions (e.g., the assignment of a constant into a variable) appear inside a loop, they can be moved out of it because their effect will be the same no matter if they&#x27;re executed many times or just once. This is also known as total redundancy elimination. A similar but more powerful optimization is partial-redundancy elimination (PRE).

;Inline expansion or macro expansion: When some code invokes a procedure, it is possible to directly insert the body of the procedure inside the calling code rather than transferring control to it. This saves the overhead related to procedure calls, as well as providing an opportunity for many different parameter-specific optimizations, but comes at the cost of space; the procedure body is duplicated each time the procedure is called inline. Generally, inlining is useful in performance-critical code that makes a large number of calls to small procedures. This is a &quot;fewer jumps&quot; optimization. The statements of imperative programming languages are also an example of such an optimization. Although statements could be implemented with function calls they are almost always implemented with code inlining.

;Jump threading: In this optimization, consecutive conditional jumps predicated entirely or partially on the same condition are merged. 
: E.g., to , 
:and to .

;Macro compression: A space optimization that recognizes common sequences of code, creates subprograms (&quot;code macros&quot;) that contain the common code, and replaces the occurrences of the common code sequences with calls to the corresponding subprograms. This is most effectively done as a machine code optimization, when all the code is present. The technique was first used to conserve space in an interpretive byte stream used in an implementation of Macro Spitbol on microcomputers. The problem of determining an optimal set of macros that minimizes the space required by a given code segment is known to be NP-complete, but efficient heuristics attain near-optimal results.

;Reduction of cache collisions: (e.g., by disrupting alignment within a page)

;Stack-height reduction: Rearrange an expression tree to minimize resources needed for expression evaluation.

;Test reordering: If we have two tests that are the condition for something, we can first deal with the simpler tests (e.g., comparing a variable to something) and only then with the complex tests (e.g., those that require a function call). This technique complements lazy evaluation, but can be used only when the tests are not dependent on one another. Short-circuiting semantics can make this difficult.

=== Interprocedural optimizations ===
Interprocedural optimization works on the entire program, across procedure and file boundaries. It works tightly with intraprocedural counterparts, carried out with the cooperation of a local part and a global part. Typical interprocedural optimizations are procedure inlining, interprocedural dead-code elimination, interprocedural constant propagation, and procedure reordering. As usual, the compiler needs to perform interprocedural analysis before its actual optimizations. Interprocedural analyses include alias analysis, array access analysis, and the construction of a call graph.

Interprocedural optimization is common in modern commercial compilers from SGI, Intel, Microsoft, and Sun Microsystems. For a long time, the open source GCC was criticized for a lack of powerful interprocedural analysis and optimizations, though this is now improving. Another open-source compiler with full analysis and optimization infrastructure is Open64.

Due to the extra time and space required by interprocedural analysis, most compilers do not perform it by default. Users must use compiler options explicitly to tell the compiler to enable interprocedural analysis and other expensive optimizations.

== Practical considerations ==
There can be a wide range of optimizations that a compiler can perform, ranging from simple and straightforward optimizations that take little compilation time to elaborate and complex optimizations that involve considerable amounts of compilation time. Accordingly, compilers often provide options to their control command or procedure to allow the compiler user to choose how much optimization to request; for instance, the IBM FORTRAN H compiler allowed the user to specify no optimization, optimization at the registers level only, or full optimization. By the 2000s, it was common for compilers, such as Clang, to have several compiler command options that could affect a variety of optimization choices, starting with the familiar codice_8 switch.

An approach to isolating optimization is the use of so-called post-pass optimizers (some commercial versions of which date back to mainframe software of the late 1970s). These tools take the executable output by an optimizing compiler and optimize it even further. Post-pass optimizers usually work on the assembly language or machine code level (in contrast with compilers that optimize intermediate representations of programs). One such example is the Portable C Compiler (PCC) of the 1980s, which had an optional pass that would perform post-optimizations on the generated assembly code.

Another consideration is that optimization algorithms are complicated and, especially when being used to compile large, complex programming languages, can contain bugs that introduce errors in the generated code or cause internal errors during compilation. Compiler errors of any kind can be disconcerting to the user, but especially so in this case, since it may not be clear that the optimization logic is at fault. In the case of internal errors, the problem can be partially ameliorated by a &quot;fail-safe&quot; programming technique in which the optimization logic in the compiler is coded such that a failure is trapped, a warning message issued, and the rest of the compilation proceeds to successful completion.

== History ==
Early compilers of the 1960s were often primarily concerned with simply compiling code correctly or efficiently, such that compile times were a major concern. One notable early optimizing compiler was the IBM FORTRAN H compiler of the late 1960s. Another of the earliest and important optimizing compilers, that pioneered several advanced techniques, was that for BLISS (1970), which was described in &quot;The Design of an Optimizing Compiler&quot; (1975). By the late 1980s, optimizing compilers were sufficiently effective that programming in assembly language declined. This co-evolved with the development of RISC chips and advanced processor features such as superscalar processors, out-of-order execution, and speculative execution, which were designed to be targeted by optimizing compilers rather than by human-written assembly code.

<doc id="40359" wikidata="Q1068288" url="?curid=40359" title="Due process">
<text>Due process of law is application by the state of all legal rules and principles pertaining to a case so all legal rights that are owed to a person are respected. Due process balances the power of law of the land and protects the individual person from it. When a government harms a person without following the exact course of the law, this constitutes a due process violation, which offends the rule of law.

Due process has also been frequently interpreted as limiting laws and legal proceedings (see substantive due process) so that judges, instead of legislators, may define and guarantee fundamental fairness, justice, and liberty. That interpretation has proven controversial. Analogous to the concepts of natural justice and procedural justice used in various other jurisdictions, the interpretation of due process is sometimes expressed as a command that the government must not be unfair to the people or abuse them physically or mentally. The term is not used in contemporary English law, but two similar concepts are natural justice, which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the rule of law as articulated by A. V. Dicey and others. However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American theory of due process, which, as explained below, presently contains many implied rights not found in either ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.

Due process developed from clause 39 of Magna Carta in England. Reference to due process first appeared in a statutory rendition of clause 39 in 1354 thus: &quot;No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law.&quot; When English and American law gradually diverged, due process was not upheld in England but became incorporated in the US Constitution.

== By jurisdiction ==

=== Magna Carta ===
In clause 39 of Magna Carta, issued in 1215, John of England promised: &quot;No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of his rights or possessions, or outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any other way, nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the law of the land.&quot; Magna Carta itself immediately became part of the &quot;law of the land&quot;, and Clause 61 of that charter authorized an elected body of 25 barons to determine by majority vote what redress the King must provide when the King offends &quot;in any respect against any man&quot;. Thus, Magna Carta established the rule of law in England by not only requiring the monarchy to obey the law of the land but also limiting how the monarchy could change the law of the land. However, in the 13th century, the provisions may have been referring only to the rights of landowners, and not to ordinary peasantry or villagers.

Shorter versions of Magna Carta were subsequently issued by British monarchs, and Clause 39 of Magna Carta was renumbered &quot;29&quot;. The phrase &quot;due process of law&quot; first appeared in a statutory rendition of Magna Carta in 1354 during the reign of Edward III of England, as follows: &quot;No man of what state or condition he be, shall be put out of his lands or tenements nor taken, nor disinherited, nor put to death, without he be brought to answer by due process of law.&quot;

In 1608, the English jurist Edward Coke wrote a treatise in which he discussed the meaning of Magna Carta. Coke explained that no man shall be deprived but by &quot;legem terrae&quot;, the law of the land, &quot;that is, by the common law, statute law, or custom of England... (that is, to speak it once and for all) by the due course, and process of law..&quot;

Both the clause in Magna Carta and the later statute of 1354 were again explained in 1704 (during the reign of Queen Anne) by the Queen&#x27;s Bench, in the case of &quot;Regina v. Paty&quot;. In that case, the British House of Commons had deprived John Paty and certain other citizens of the right to vote in an election and committed them to Newgate Prison merely for the offense of pursuing a legal action in the courts. The Queen&#x27;s Bench, in an opinion by Justice Littleton Powys, explained the meaning of &quot;due process of law&quot; as follows:
Chief Justice Holt dissented in this case because he believed that the commitment had not in fact been by a legal authority. The House of Commons had purported to legislate unilaterally, without approval of the British House of Lords, ostensibly to regulate the election of its members. Although the Queen&#x27;s Bench held that the House of Commons had not infringed or overturned due process, John Paty was ultimately freed by Queen Anne when she prorogued Parliament.

=== English law and American law diverge ===

Throughout centuries of British history, many laws and treatises asserted various requirements as being part of &quot;due process&quot; or included in the &quot;law of the land&quot;. That view usually held in regards to what was required by existing law, rather than what was intrinsically required by due process itself. As the United States Supreme Court has explained, a due process requirement in Britain was not &quot;essential to the idea of due process of law in the prosecution and punishment of crimes, but was only mentioned as an example and illustration of due process of law as it actually existed in cases in which it was customarily used&quot;.

Ultimately, the scattered references to &quot;due process of law&quot; in English law did not limit the power of the government; in the words of American law professor John V. Orth, &quot;the great phrases failed to retain their vitality.&quot; Orth points out that this is generally attributed to the rise of the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy in the United Kingdom, which was accompanied by hostility towards judicial review as an undemocratic foreign invention.

Scholars have occasionally interpreted Lord Coke&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Dr. Bonham&#x27;s Case&quot; as implying the possibility of judicial review, but by the 1870s, Lord Campbell was dismissing judicial review as &quot;a foolish doctrine alleged to have been laid down extra-judicially in Dr. Bonham&#x27;s Case..., a conundrum [that] ought to have been laughed at&quot;. Lacking the power of judicial review, English courts possessed no means by which to declare government statutes or actions invalid as a violation of due process. In contrast, American legislators and executive branch officers possessed virtually no means by which to overrule judicial invalidation of statutes or actions as due process violations, with the sole exception of proposing a constitutional amendment, which are rarely successful. As a consequence, English law and American law diverged. Unlike their English counterparts, American judges became increasingly assertive about enforcing due process of law. In turn, the legislative and executive branches learned how to avoid such confrontations in the first place, by tailoring statutes and executive actions to the constitutional requirements of due process as elaborated upon by the judiciary.

In 1977, an English political science professor explained the present situation in England for the benefit of American lawyers:
An American constitutional lawyer might well be surprised by the elusiveness of references to the term &#x27;due process of law&#x27; in the general body of English legal writing... Today one finds no space devoted to due process in Halsbury&#x27;s &quot;Laws of England&quot;, in Stephen&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries&quot;, or Anson&#x27;s &quot;Law and Custom of the Constitution.&quot; The phrase rates no entry in such works as Stroud&#x27;s &quot;Judicial Dictionary&quot; or Wharton&#x27;s &quot;Law Lexicon.&quot;

Two similar concepts in contemporary English law are natural justice, which generally applies only to decisions of administrative agencies and some types of private bodies like trade unions, and the British constitutional concept of the rule of law as articulated by A. V. Dicey and others. However, neither concept lines up perfectly with the American conception of due process, which presently contains many implied rights not found in the ancient or modern concepts of due process in England.

=== United States ===

The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution each contain a Due Process Clause. Due process deals with the administration of justice and thus the Due Process Clause acts as a safeguard from arbitrary denial of life, liberty, or property by the government outside the sanction of law. The Supreme Court of the United States interprets the clauses as providing four protections: procedural due process (in civil and criminal proceedings), substantive due process, a prohibition against vague laws, and as the vehicle for the incorporation of the Bill of Rights.

=== Others ===
Various countries recognize some form of due process under customary international law. Although the specifics are often unclear, most nations agree that they should guarantee foreign visitors a basic minimum level of justice and fairness. Some nations have argued that they are bound to grant no more rights to aliens than they do to their own citizens, the doctrine of national treatment, which also means that both would be vulnerable to the same deprivations by the government. With the growth of international human rights law and the frequent use of treaties to govern treatment of foreign nationals abroad, the distinction, in practice, between these two perspectives may be disappearing.

<doc id="40363" wikidata="Q303665" url="?curid=40363" title="Dosimeter">
<text>A radiation dosimeter is a device that measures dose uptake of external ionizing radiation. It is worn by the person being monitored when used as a personal dosimeter, and is a record of the radiation dose received. Modern electronic personal dosimeters can give a continuous readout of cumulative dose and current dose rate, and can warn the wearer with an audible alarm when a specified dose rate or a cumulative dose is exceeded. Other dosimeters, such as thermoluminescent or film types, require processing after use to reveal the cumulative dose received, and cannot give a current indication of dose while being worn.

==Personal dosimeters==

The personal ionising radiation dosimeter is of fundamental importance in the disciplines of radiation dosimetry and radiation health physics and is primarily used to estimate the radiation dose deposited in an individual wearing the device.

Ionising radiation damage to the human body is cumulative, and is related to the total dose received, for which the SI unit is the sievert. Radiographers, nuclear power plant workers, doctors using radiotherapy, HAZMAT workers, and other people in situations that involve handling radionuclides are often required to wear dosimeters so a record of occupational exposure can be made. Such devices are known as &quot;legal dosimeters&quot; if they have been approved for use in recording personnel dose for regulatory purposes.

Dosimeters are typically worn on the outside of clothing, a &quot;whole body&quot; dosimeter is worn on the chest or torso to represent dose to the whole body. This location monitors exposure of most vital organs and represents the bulk of body mass. Additional dosimeters can be worn to assess dose to extremities or in radiation fields that vary considerably depending on orientation of the body to the source.

===Electronic personal dosimeters===
The electronic personal dosimeter, the most commonly used type, is an electronic device that has a number of sophisticated functions, such as continual monitoring which allows alarm warnings at preset levels and live readout of dose accumulated. These are especially useful in high dose areas where residence time of the wearer is limited due to dose constraints. The dosimeter can be reset, usually after taking a reading for record purposes, and thereby re-used multiple times.

====MOSFET dosimeter====
Metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor dosimeters are now used as clinical dosimeters for radiotherapy radiation beams. The main advantages of MOSFET devices are:

1. The MOSFET dosimeter is direct reading with a very thin active area (less than 2μm ).

2. The physical size of the MOSFET when packaged is less than 4 mm.

3. The post radiation signal is permanently stored and is dose rate independent.

Gate oxide of MOSFET which is conventionally silicon dioxide is an active sensing material in MOSFET dosimeters. Radiation creates defects (acts like electron-hole pairs) in oxide, which in turn affects the threshold voltage of the MOSFET. This change in threshold voltage is proportional to radiation dose. Alternate high-k gate dielectrics like hafnium dioxide and aluminum oxides are also proposed as a radiation dosimeters.

==== PIN dosimeters ====
PIN diodes are often used by military personnel for measuring radiation dosage.

==== Scintillation counter ====

A scintillation counter detects ionizing radiation by measuring the light emitted from a scintillator, giving a measurement of radiation levels almost instantly. Like thermoluminescent crystals, scintillation materials begin to glow when exposed to radiation. Unlike thermoluminescent crystals, which store absorbed radiation to measure accumulated doses over a period of time, scintillation materials release light immediately, and do not need to be heated.

====Thermoluminescent dosimeter====

A thermoluminescent dosimeter measures ionizing radiation exposure by measuring the intensity of light emitted from a Dy or B doped crystal in the detector when heated. The intensity of light emitted is dependent upon the radiation exposure. These were once sold surplus and one format once used by submariners and nuclear workers resembled a dark green wristwatch containing the active components and a highly sensitive IR wire ended diode mounted to the doped LiF2 glass chip that when the assembly is precisely heated (hence thermoluminescent) emits the stored radiation as narrow band infrared light until it is depleted The main advantage is that the chip records dosage passively until exposed to light or heat so even a used sample kept in darkness can provide valuable scientific data.

===Legacy types of dosimeters===
====Film badge dosimeter====

Film badge dosimeters are for one-time use only. The level of radiation absorption is indicated by a change to the film emulsion, which is shown when the film is developed. They are now mostly superseded by electronic personal dosimeters and thermoluminescent dosimeters.

====Quartz fiber dosimeter====
These use the property of a quartz fiber to measure the static electricity held on the fiber. Before use by the wearer a dosimeter is charged to a high voltage, causing the fiber to deflect due to electrostatic repulsion. As the gas in the dosimeter chamber becomes ionized by radiation the charge leaks away, causing the fiber to straighten and thereby indicate the amount of dose received against a graduated scale, which is viewed by a small in-built microscope.
They are only used for short durations, such as a day or a shift, as they can suffer from charge leakage, which gives a false high reading.
However they are immune to EMP so were used during the Cold War as a failsafe method of determining radiation exposure.

They are now largely superseded by electronic personal dosimeters for short term monitoring.

====Geiger tube dosimeter====
These use a conventional Geiger-Muller tube, typically a ZP1301 or similar energy-compensated tube, requiring between 600 and 700V and pulse detection components. The display on most is a bubble or miniature LCD type with 4 digits and a discrete counter integrated chip such as 74C925/6. LED units usually have a button to turn the display on and off for longer battery life, and an infrared emitter for count verification and calibration.
The voltage is derived from a separate pinned or wire-ended module that often uses a unijunction transistor driving a small step-up coil and multiplier stage. While expensive, it is reliable over time and especially in high-radiation environments, sharing this trait with tunnel diodes, though the encapsulants, inductors and capacitors have been known to break down internally over time.
These have the disadvantage that the stored dose in becquerels or microsieverts is volatile and vanishes if the power supply is disconnected, though there can be a low-leakage capacitor to preserve the memory for short periods without a battery. Because of this, most units use long-life batteries and high-quality contacts. Recently-designed units log dose over time to non-volatile memory, such as a 24C256 chip so it may be read out via a serial port.

==Dosimetry dose quantities==

The operational quantity for personal dosimetry is the personal dose equivalent, which is defined by the International Commission on Radiological Protection as the dose equivalent in soft tissue at an appropriate depth, below a specified point on the human body. The specified point is usually given by the position where the individual’s dosimeter is worn.

===Instrument and dosimeter response===
This is an actual reading obtained from such as an ambient dose gamma monitor, or a personal dosimeter. The dosimeter is calibrated in a known radiation field to ensure display of accurate operational quantities and allow a relationship to known health effect. The personal dose equivalent is used to assess dose uptake, and allow regulatory limits to be met. It is the figure usually entered into the records of external dose for occupational radiation workers.

The dosimeter plays an important role within the international radiation protection system developed by the International Commission on Radiological Protection and the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements. This is shown in the accompanying diagram.

====Dosimeter calibration====
The &quot;slab&quot; phantom is used to represent the human torso for calibration of whole body dosimeters. This replicates the radiation scattering and absorption effects of the human torso. The International Atomic Energy Agency states &quot;The slab phantom is 300 mm × 300 mm × 150 mm depth to represent the human torso&quot;.

==Radiation related measurement quantities==
==Process irradiation verification==
Manufacturing processes that treat products with ionizing radiation, such as food irradiation, use dosimeters to calibrate doses deposited in the matter being irradiated. These usually must have a greater dose range than personal dosimeters, and doses are normally measured in the unit of absorbed dose: the gray (Gy). The dosimeter is located on or adjacent to the items being irradiated during the process as a validation of dose levels received.

<text>An electrometer is an electrical instrument for measuring electric charge or electrical potential difference. There are many different types, ranging from historical handmade mechanical instruments to high-precision electronic devices. Modern electrometers based on vacuum tube or solid-state technology can be used to make voltage and charge measurements with very low leakage currents, down to 1 femtoampere. A simpler but related instrument, the electroscope, works on similar principles but only indicates the relative magnitudes of voltages or charges.

== Historical electrometers ==
=== Gold-leaf electroscope ===
The gold-leaf electroscope was one of the instruments used to indicate electric charge. It is still used for science demonstrations but has been superseded in most applications by electronic measuring instruments. The instrument consists of two thin leaves of gold foil suspended from an electrode. When the electrode is charged by induction or by contact, the leaves acquire similar electric charges and repel each other due to the Coulomb force. Their separation is a direct indication of the net charge stored on them. On the glass opposite the leaves, pieces of tin foil may be pasted, so that when the leaves diverge fully they may discharge into the ground. The leaves may be enclosed in a glass envelope to protect them from drafts, and the envelope may be evacuated to minimize charge leakage. This principle has been used to detect ionizing radiation, as seen in the quartz fibre electrometer and Kearny fallout meter.

This type of electroscope usually acts as an indicator and not a measuring device, although it can be calibrated. A calibrated electrometer with a more robust aluminium indicator was invented by Ferdinand Braun and first described in 1887. According to Braun, the standard gold-leaf electrometer is good up to about with a resolution of using an ocular micrometer. For larger voltages up to Braun&#x27;s instrument can achieve a resolution of .

The instrument was developed in the 18th century by several researchers, among them Abraham Bennet (1787) and Alessandro Volta.

=== Early quadrant electrometer ===
While the term &quot;quadrant electrometer&quot; eventually referred to Kelvin&#x27;s version, this term was first used to describe a simpler device. Its body consists of an upright stem of wood affixed to a semicircle of ivory with angle markings. A light cork ball hangs by a string from a pivot at the center of the semicircle and makes contact with the stem. When the instrument is placed upon a charged body, the stem and ball become charged and repel each other. The amount of repulsion is quantified by reading the angle between the string and the stem off the semicircle, though the measured angle is not in direct proportion to the charge. Early inventors included William Henley (1770) and Horace-Bénédict de Saussure.

=== Coulomb&#x27;s electrometer ===
Torsion is used to give a measurement more sensitive than repulsion of gold leaves or cork-balls. It consists of a glass cylinder with a glass tube on top. In the axes of the tube is a glass thread, the lower end of this holds a bar of gum lac, with a gilt pith ball at each extremity. Through another aperture on the cylinder, another gum lac rod with gilt balls may be introduced. This is called the carrier rod.

If the lower ball of the carrier rod is charged when it is entered into the aperture, this will repel one of the movable balls inside. An index and scale (not pictured) is attached to the top of the twistable glass rod. The number of degrees twisted to bring the balls back together is in exact proportion of the amount of charge of the ball of the carrier rod.

Francis Ronalds, the inaugural Director of the Kew Observatory, made important improvements to the Coulomb torsion balance around 1844 and the modified instrument was sold by London instrument-makers. Ronalds used a thin suspended needle rather than the gum lac bar and replaced the carrier rod with a fixed piece in the plane of the needle. Both were metal, as was the suspending line and its surrounding tube, so that the needle and the fixed piece could be charged directly through wire connections. Ronalds also employed a Faraday cage and trialled photography to record the readings continuously. It was the forerunner of Kelvin&#x27;s quadrant electrometer (described below).

=== Peltier electrometer ===
Developed by Peltier, this uses a form of magnetic compass to measure deflection by balancing the electrostatic force with a magnetic needle.

=== Bohnenberger electrometer ===
The Bohnenberger electrometer, developed by J. G. F. von Bohnenberger from an invention by T. G. B. Behrens, consists of a single gold leaf suspended vertically between the anode and cathode of a dry pile. Any charge imparted to the gold leaf causes it to move toward one or the other pole; thus, the sign of the charge as well as its approximate magnitude may be gauged.

=== Attraction electrometer ===
Also known as &quot;attracted disk electrometers&quot;, attraction electrometers are sensitive balances measuring the attraction between charged disks. William Snow Harris is credited with the invention of this instrument, which was further improved by Lord Kelvin.

=== Kelvin&#x27;s quadrant electrometer ===
Developed by Lord Kelvin, this is the most sensitive and accurate of all the mechanical electrometers. The original design uses a light aluminum sector suspended inside a drum cut into four segments. The segments are insulated and connected diagonally in pairs. The charged aluminum sector is attracted to one pair of segments and repelled from the other. The deflection is observed by a beam of light reflected from a small mirror attached to the sector, just as in a galvanometer. The engraving on the right shows a slightly different form of this electrometer, using four flat plates rather than closed segments. The plates can be connected externally in the conventional diagonal way (as shown), or in a different order for specific applications.

A more sensitive form of quadrant electrometer was developed by Frederick Lindemann. It employs a metal-coated quartz fiber instead of an aluminum sector. The deflection is measured by observing the movement of the fiber under a microscope. Initially used for measuring star light, it was employed for the infrared detection of airplanes in the early stages of World War II.

Some mechanical electrometers were housed inside a cage often referred to as a “bird cage”. This is a form of Faraday Cage that protected the instrument from external electrostatic charges.

=== Electrograph ===
Electricity readings may be recorded continuously with a device known as an electrograph. Francis Ronalds created an early electrograph around 1814 in which the changing electricity made a pattern in a rotating resin-coated plate. It was employed at Kew Observatory and the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in the 1840s to create records of variations in atmospheric electricity. In 1845, Ronalds invented photographic means of registering the atmospheric electricity. The photosensitive surface was pulled slowly past of the aperture diaphragm of the camera box, which also housed an electrometer, and captured ongoing movements of the electrometer indices as a trace. Kelvin used similar photographic means for his quadrant electrometer (see above) in the 1860s.

== Modern electrometers ==
A modern electrometer is a highly sensitive electronic voltmeter whose input impedance is so high that the current flowing into it can be considered, for most practical purposes, to be zero. The actual value of input resistance for modern electronic electrometers is around 1014Ω, compared to around 1010Ω for nanovoltmeters. Owing to the extremely high input impedance, special design considerations (such as driven shields and special insulation materials) must be applied to avoid leakage current.

Among other applications, electrometers are used in nuclear physics experiments as they are able to measure the tiny charges left in matter by the passage of ionizing radiation. The most common use for modern electrometers is the measurement of radiation with ionization chambers, in instruments such as geiger counters.

=== Vibrating reed electrometers ===
Vibrating reed electrometers use a variable capacitor formed between a moving electrode (in the form of a vibrating reed) and a fixed input electrode. As the distance between the two electrodes varies, the capacitance also varies and electric charge is forced in and out of the capacitor. The alternating current signal produced by the flow of this charge is amplified and used as an analogue for the DC voltage applied to the capacitor. The DC input resistance of the electrometer is determined solely by the leakage resistance of the capacitor, and is typically extremely high, (although its AC input impedance is lower).

For convenience of use, the vibrating reed assembly is often attached by a cable to the rest of the electrometer. This allows for a relatively small unit to be located near the charge to be measured while the much larger reed-driver and amplifier unit can be located wherever it is convenient for the operator.

=== Valve electrometers ===
Valve electrometers use a specialized vacuum tube (thermionic valve) with a very high gain (transconductance) and input resistance. The input current is allowed to flow into the high impedance grid, and the voltage so generated is vastly amplified in the anode (plate) circuit. Valves designed for electrometer use have leakage currents as low as a few femtoamperes (10−15 amperes). Such valves must be handled with gloved hands as the salts left on the glass envelope can provide leakage paths for these tiny currents.

In a specialized circuit called &quot;inverted triode&quot;, the roles of anode and grid are reversed. This places the control electrode at a maximum distance from the space-charge region surrounding the filament, minimizing the number of electrons collected by the control electrode, and thus minimizing the input current.

=== Solid-state electrometers ===
The most modern electrometers consist of a solid state amplifier using one or more field-effect transistors, connections for external measurement devices, and usually a display and/or data-logging connections. The amplifier amplifies small currents so that they are more easily measured. The external connections are usually of a co-axial or tri-axial design, and allow attachment of diodes or ionization chambers for ionising radiation measurement. The display or data-logging connections allow the user to see the data or record it for later analysis. Electrometers designed for use with ionization chambers may include a high-voltage power supply, which is used to bias the ionization chamber.

Solid-state electrometers are often multipurpose devices that can measure voltage, charge, resistance and current. They measure voltage by means of &quot;voltage balancing&quot;, in which the input voltage is compared with an internal reference voltage source using an electronic circuit with a very high input impedance (of the order of 1014 Ω). A similar circuit modified to act as a current-to-voltage converter enables the instrument to measure currents as small as a few femtoamperes. Combined with an internal voltage source, the current measuring mode can be adapted to measure very high resistances, of the order of 1017 Ω. Finally, by calculation from the known capacitance of the electrometer&#x27;s input terminal, the instrument can measure very small electric charges, down to a small fraction of a picocoulomb.

<text>A galvanometer is an electromechanical measuring instrument for electric current. Early galvanometers were uncalibrated, but improved versions, called ammeters, were calibrated and could measure the flow of current more precisely. Galvanometers work by deflecting a pointer in response to an electric current flowing through a coil in a constant magnetic field. The mechanism is also used as an actuator in applications such as hard disks.

Galvanometers came from the observation, first noted by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820, that a magnetic compass&#x27;s needle deflects when near a wire having electric current. They were the first instruments used to detect and measure small amounts of current. André-Marie Ampère, who gave mathematical expression to Ørsted&#x27;s discovery, named the instrument after the Italian electricity researcher Luigi Galvani, who in 1791 discovered the principle of the frog galvanoscope – that electric current would make the legs of a dead frog jerk.

Galvanometers have been essential for the development of science and technology in many fields. For example, in the 1800s they enabled long-range communication through submarine cables, such as the earliest transatlantic telegraph cables, and were essential to discovering the electrical activity of the heart and brain, by their fine measurements of current.

Galvanometers have also been used as the display components of other kinds of analog meters (e.g., light meters and VU meters), capturing the outputs of these meters&#x27; sensors. Today, the main type of galvanometer still in use is the D&#x27;Arsonval/Weston type.

==Operation==
Modern galvanometers, of the D&#x27;Arsonval/Weston type, are constructed with a small pivoting coil of wire, called a spindle, in the field of a permanent magnet. The coil is attached to a thin pointer that traverses a calibrated scale. A tiny torsion spring pulls the coil and pointer to the zero position.
When a direct current (DC) flows through the coil, the coil generates a magnetic field. This field acts against the permanent magnet. The coil twists, pushing against the spring, and moves the pointer. The hand points at a scale indicating the electric current. Careful design of the pole pieces ensures that the magnetic field is uniform so that the angular deflection of the pointer is proportional to the current. A useful meter generally contains a provision for damping the mechanical resonance of the moving coil and pointer, so that the pointer settles quickly to its position without oscillation.

The basic sensitivity of a meter might be, for instance, 100 microamperes full scale (with a voltage drop of, say, 50 millivolts at full current). Such meters are often calibrated to read some other quantity that can be converted to a current of that magnitude. The use of current dividers, often called shunts, allows a meter to be calibrated to measure larger currents. A meter can be calibrated as a DC voltmeter if the resistance of the coil is known by calculating the voltage required to generate a full-scale current. A meter can be configured to read other voltages by putting it in a voltage divider circuit. This is generally done by placing a resistor in series with the meter coil. A meter can be used to read resistance by placing it in series with a known voltage (a battery) and an adjustable resistor. In a preparatory step, the circuit is completed and the resistor adjusted to produce full-scale deflection. When an unknown resistor is placed in series in the circuit the current will be less than full scale and an appropriately calibrated scale can display the value of the previously unknown resistor.

These capabilities to translate different kinds of electric quantities into pointer movements make the galvanometer ideal for turning the output of other sensors that output electricity (in some form or another), into something that can be read by a human.

Because the pointer of the meter is usually a small distance above the scale of the meter, parallax error can occur when the operator attempts to read the scale line that &quot;lines up&quot; with the pointer. To counter this, some meters include a mirror along with the markings of the principal scale. The accuracy of the reading from a mirrored scale is improved by positioning one&#x27;s head while reading the scale so that the pointer and the reflection of the pointer are aligned; at this point, the operator&#x27;s eye must be directly above the pointer and any parallax error has been minimized.

==Uses==

Probably the largest use of galvanometers was of the D&#x27;Arsonval/Weston type used in analog meters in electronic equipment. Since the 1980s, galvanometer-type analog meter movements have been displaced by analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) for many uses. A digital panel meter (DPM) contains an ADC and numeric display. The advantages of a digital instrument are higher precision and accuracy, but factors such as power consumption or cost may still favor the application of analog meter movements.

===Modern uses===
Most modern uses for the galvanometer mechanism are in positioning and control systems. Galvanometer mechanisms are divided into moving magnet and moving coil galvanometers; in addition, they are divided into &quot;closed-loop&quot; and &quot;open-loop&quot; - or &quot;resonant&quot; - types.

&quot;Mirror&quot; galvanometer systems are used as beam positioning or beam steering elements in laser scanning systems. For example, for material processing with high-power lasers, closed loop mirror galvanometer mechanisms are used with servo control systems. These are typically high power galvanometers and the newest galvanometers designed for beam steering applications can have frequency responses over 10 kHz with appropriate servo technology. Closed-loop mirror galvanometers are also used in similar ways in stereolithography, laser sintering, laser engraving, laser beam welding, laser TVs, laser displays and in imaging applications such as retinal scanning with Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (SLO). Almost all of these galvanometers are of the moving magnet type. The closed loop is obtained measuring the position of the rotating axis with an infrared emitter and 2 photodiodes. This feedback is an analog signal.

Open loop, or resonant mirror galvanometers, are mainly used in some types of laser-based bar-code scanners, printing machines, imaging applications, military applications and space systems. Their non-lubricated bearings are especially of interest in applications that require functioning in a high vacuum.

Moving coil type galvanometer mechanisms (called &#x27;voice coils&#x27; by hard disk manufacturers) are used for controlling the &quot;head positioning&quot; servos in hard disk drives and CD/DVD players, in order to keep mass (and thus access times), as low as possible.

===Past uses===
A major early use for galvanometers was for finding faults in telecommunications cables. They were superseded in this application late in the 20th century by time-domain reflectometers.

Galvanometer mechanisms were also used to get readings from photoresistors in the metering mechanisms of film cameras (as seen in the adjacent image).

In analog strip chart recorders such as used in electrocardiographs, electroencephalographs and polygraphs, galvanometer mechanisms were used to position the &quot;pen&quot;. Strip chart recorders with galvanometer driven pens may have a full-scale frequency response of 100 Hz and several centimeters of deflection.

==History==
===Hans Christian Ørsted===
The deflection of a magnetic compass needle by the current in a wire was first described by Hans Christian Ørsted in 1820. The phenomenon was studied both for its own sake and as a means of measuring electric current.

===Schweigger and Ampère===
The earliest galvanometer was reported by Johann Schweigger at the University of Halle on 16 September 1820. André-Marie Ampère also contributed to its development. Early designs increased the effect of the magnetic field generated by the current by using multiple turns of wire. The instruments were at first called &quot;multipliers&quot; due to this common design feature. The term &quot;galvanometer,&quot; in common use by 1836, was derived from the surname of Italian electricity researcher Luigi Galvani, who in 1791 discovered that electric current would make a dead frog&#x27;s leg jerk.

===Poggendorff and Thomson===
Originally, the instruments relied on the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to provide the restoring force for the compass needle. These were called &quot;tangent&quot; galvanometers and had to be oriented before use. Later instruments of the &quot;astatic&quot; type used opposing magnets to become independent of the Earth&#x27;s field and would operate in any orientation.

An early mirror galvanometer was invented in 1826 by Johann Christian Poggendorff. An astatic galvanometer was invented by Hermann von Helmholtz in 1849; a more sensitive version of that device, the Thomson &quot;mirror galvanometer&quot;, was patented in 1858 by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin). Thomson&#x27;s design was able to detect very rapid current changes by using small magnets attached to a lightweight mirror, suspended by a thread, instead of a compass needle. The deflection of a light beam on the mirror greatly magnified the deflection induced by small currents. Alternatively, the deflection of the suspended magnets could be observed directly through a microscope.

===Georg Ohm===
The ability to measure voltage and current quantitatively allowed Georg Ohm, in 1827, to formulate Ohm&#x27;s law – that the voltage across a conductor is directly proportional to the current through it.

===D&#x27;Arsonval and Deprez===
The early moving-magnet form of galvanometer had the disadvantage that it was affected by any magnets or iron masses near it, and its deflection was not linearly proportional to the current. In 1882 Jacques-Arsène d&#x27;Arsonval and Marcel Deprez developed a form with a stationary permanent magnet and a moving coil of wire, suspended by fine wires which provided both an electrical connection to the coil and the restoring torque to return to the zero position. An iron tube between the magnet&#x27;s pole pieces defined a circular gap through which the coil rotated. This gap produced a consistent, radial magnetic field across the coil, giving a linear response throughout the instrument&#x27;s range. A mirror attached to the coil deflected a beam of light to indicate the coil position. The concentrated magnetic field and delicate suspension made these instruments sensitive; d&#x27;Arsonval&#x27;s initial instrument could detect ten microamperes.

===Edward Weston===
Edward Weston extensively improved the design of the galvanometer. He substituted the fine wire suspension with a pivot and provided restoring torque and electrical connections through spiral springs rather than through the traditional wristwatch balance wheel hairspring. He developed a method of stabilizing the magnetic field of the permanent magnet, so the instrument would have consistent accuracy over time. He replaced the light beam and mirror with a knife-edge pointer that could be read directly. A mirror under the pointer, in the same plane as the scale, eliminated parallax observation error. To maintain the field strength, Weston&#x27;s design used a very narrow circumferential slot through which the coil moved, with a minimal air-gap. This improved linearity of pointer deflection with respect to coil current. Finally, the coil was wound on a light-weight form made of conductive metal, which acted as a damper. By 1888, Edward Weston had patented and brought out a commercial form of this instrument, which became a standard electrical equipment component. It was known as a &quot;portable&quot; instrument because it was affected very little by mounting position or by transporting it from place to place. This design is almost universally used in moving-coil meters today.

Initially, laboratory instruments relying on the Earth&#x27;s own magnetic field to provide restoring force for the pointer, galvanometers were developed into compact, rugged, sensitive portable instruments essential to the development of electro-technology.

===Taut-band movement===
The taut-band movement is a modern development of the D&#x27;Arsonval-Weston movement. The jewel pivots and hairsprings are replaced by tiny strips of metal under tension. Such a meter is more rugged for field use.

==Types==
There is broadly two types of galvanometers. Some galvanometers use a solid pointer on a scale to show measurements; other very sensitive types use a miniature mirror and a beam of light to provide mechanical amplification of low-level signals.

===Tangent galvanometer===
A tangent galvanometer is an early measuring instrument used for the measurement of electric current. It works by using a compass needle to compare a magnetic field generated by the unknown current to the magnetic field of the Earth. It gets its name from its operating principle, the tangent law of magnetism, which states that the tangent of the angle a compass needle makes is proportional to the ratio of the strengths of the two perpendicular magnetic fields. It was first described by Johan Jakob Nervander in 1834.

A tangent galvanometer consists of a coil of insulated copper wire wound on a circular non-magnetic frame. The frame is mounted vertically on a horizontal base provided with levelling screws. The coil can be rotated on a vertical axis passing through its centre. A compass box is mounted horizontally at the centre of a circular scale. It consists of a tiny, powerful magnetic needle pivoted at the centre of the coil. The magnetic needle is free to rotate in the horizontal plane. The circular scale is divided into four quadrants. Each quadrant is graduated from 0° to 90°. A long thin aluminium pointer is attached to the needle at its centre and at right angle to it. To avoid errors due to parallax, a plane mirror is mounted below the compass needle.

In operation, the instrument is first rotated until the magnetic field of the Earth, indicated by the compass needle, is parallel with the plane of the coil. Then the unknown current is applied to the coil. This creates a second magnetic field on the axis of the coil, perpendicular to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The compass needle responds to the vector sum of the two fields and deflects to an angle equal to the tangent of the ratio of the two fields. From the angle read from the compass&#x27;s scale, the current could be found from a table. The current supply wires have to be wound in a small helix, like a pig&#x27;s tail, otherwise the field due to the wire will affect the compass needle and an incorrect reading will be obtained.
====Theory====
The galvanometer is oriented so that the plane of the coil is vertical and aligned along parallel to the horizontal component of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field (i.e. parallel to the local &quot;magnetic meridian&quot;). When an electric current flows through the galvanometer coil, a second magnetic field is created. At the center of the coil, where the compass needle is located, the coil&#x27;s field is perpendicular to the plane of the coil. The magnitude of the coil&#x27;s field is:
:formula_1
where is the current in amperes, is the number of turns of the coil and is the radius of the coil. These two perpendicular magnetic fields add vectorially, and the compass needle points along the direction of their resultant . The current in the coil causes the compass needle to rotate by an angle :
:formula_2
From tangent law, , i.e.
:formula_3
or
:formula_4
or , where is called the Reduction Factor of the tangent galvanometer.

One problem with the tangent galvanometer is that its resolution degrades at both high currents and low currents. The maximum resolution is obtained when the value of is 45°. When the value of is close to 0° or 90°, a large percentage change in the current will only move the needle a few degrees.

====Geomagnetic field measurement====
A tangent galvanometer can also be used to measure the magnitude of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. When used in this way, a low-voltage power source, such as a battery, is connected in series with a rheostat, the galvanometer, and an ammeter. The galvanometer is first aligned so that the coil is parallel to the geomagnetic field, whose direction is indicated by the compass when there is no current through the coils. The battery is then connected and the rheostat is adjusted until the compass needle deflects 45 degrees from the geomagnetic field, indicating that the magnitude of the magnetic field at the center of the coil is the same as that of the horizontal component of the geomagnetic field. This field strength can be calculated from the current as measured by the ammeter, the number of turns of the coil, and the radius of the coils.

===Astatic galvanometer===
Unlike the tangent galvanometer, the &quot;astatic galvanometer&quot; does not use the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field for measurement, so it does not need to be oriented with respect to the Earth&#x27;s field, making it easier to use. Developed by Leopoldo Nobili in 1825, it consists of two magnetized needles parallel to each other but with the magnetic poles reversed. These needles are suspended by a single silk thread. The lower needle is inside a vertical current sensing coil of wire and is deflected by the magnetic field created by the passing current, as in the tangent galvanometer above. The purpose of the second needle is to cancel the dipole moment of the first needle, so the suspended armature has no net magnetic dipole moment, and thus is not affected by the earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The needle&#x27;s rotation is opposed by the torsional elasticity of the suspension thread, which is proportional to the angle.

===Mirror galvanometer===

To achieve higher sensitivity to detect extremely small currents, the mirror galvanometer substitutes a lightweight mirror for the pointer. It consists of horizontal magnets suspended from a fine fiber, inside a vertical coil of wire, with a mirror attached to the magnets. A beam of light reflected from the mirror falls on a graduated scale across the room, acting as a long mass-less pointer. The mirror galvanometer was used as the receiver in the first trans-Atlantic submarine telegraph cables in the 1850s, to detect the extremely faint pulses of current after their thousand-mile journey under the Atlantic. In a device called an oscillograph, the moving beam of light is used, to produce graphs of current versus time, by recording measurements on photographic film. The string galvanometer is a type of mirror galvanometer so sensitive that it was used to make the first electrocardiogram of the electrical activity of the human heart.

===Ballistic galvanometer===

A ballistic galvanometer is a type of sensitive galvanometer for measuring the quantity of charge discharged through it. It is an integrator, by virtue of the long time constant of its response, unlike a current-measuring galvanometer. The moving part has a large moment of inertia that gives it an oscillation period long enough to make the integrated measurement. It can be either of the moving coil or moving magnet type; commonly it is a mirror galvanometer.

<text>In electronics, an analog-to-digital converter (ADC, A/D, or A-to-D) is a system that converts an analog signal, such as a sound picked up by a microphone or light entering a digital camera, into a digital signal. An ADC may also provide an isolated measurement such as an electronic device that converts an analog input voltage or current to a digital number representing the magnitude of the voltage or current. Typically the digital output is a two&#x27;s complement binary number that is proportional to the input, but there are other possibilities.

There are several ADC architectures. Due to the complexity and the need for precisely matched components, all but the most specialized ADCs are implemented as integrated circuits (ICs). These typically take the form of metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) mixed-signal integrated circuit chips that integrate both analog and digital circuits.

A digital-to-analog converter (DAC) performs the reverse function; it converts a digital signal into an analog signal.

==Explanation==
An ADC converts a continuous-time and continuous-amplitude analog signal to a discrete-time and discrete-amplitude digital signal. The conversion involves quantization of the input, so it necessarily introduces a small amount of quantization error. Furthermore, instead of continuously performing the conversion, an ADC does the conversion periodically, sampling the input, and limiting the allowable bandwidth of the input signal.

The performance of an ADC is primarily characterized by its bandwidth and signal-to-noise and distortion ratio (SNDR). The bandwidth of an ADC is characterized primarily by its sampling rate. The SNDR of an ADC is influenced by many factors, including the resolution, linearity and accuracy (how well the quantization levels match the true analog signal), aliasing and jitter. The SNDR of an ADC is often summarized in terms of its effective number of bits (ENOB), the number of bits of each measure it returns that are on average not noise. An ideal ADC has an ENOB equal to its resolution. ADCs are chosen to match the bandwidth and required SNDR of the signal to be digitized. If an ADC operates at a sampling rate greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal, then per the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, near-perfect reconstruction is possible. The presence of quantization error limits the SNDR of even an ideal ADC. However, if the SNDR of the ADC exceeds that of the input signal, then the effects of quantization error may be neglected, resulting in an essentially perfect digital representation of the bandlimited analog input signal.

===Resolution===

The resolution of the converter indicates the number of different, i.e. discrete, values it can produce over the allowed range of analog input values. Thus a particular resolution determines the magnitude of the quantization error and therefore determines the maximum possible signal-to-noise ratio for an ideal ADC without the use of oversampling. The input samples are usually stored electronically in binary form within the ADC, so the resolution is usually expressed as the audio bit depth. In consequence, the number of discrete values available is usually a power of two. For example, an ADC with a resolution of 8 bits can encode an analog input to one in 256 different levels (28 = 256). The values can represent the ranges from 0 to 255 (i.e. as unsigned integers) or from −128 to 127 (i.e. as signed integer), depending on the application.

Resolution can also be defined electrically, and expressed in volts. The change in voltage required to guarantee a change in the output code level is called the least significant bit (LSB) voltage. The resolution &quot;Q&quot; of the ADC is equal to the LSB voltage. The voltage resolution of an ADC is equal to its overall voltage measurement range divided by the number of intervals:

:formula_1

where &quot;M&quot; is the ADC&#x27;s resolution in bits and &quot;E&quot;FSR is the full-scale voltage range (also called &#x27;span&#x27;). &quot;E&quot;FSR is given by

:formula_2

where &quot;V&quot;RefHi and &quot;V&quot;RefLow are the upper and lower extremes, respectively, of the voltages that can be coded.

Normally, the number of voltage intervals is given by

:formula_3

where &quot;M&quot; is the ADC&#x27;s resolution in bits.

That is, one voltage interval is assigned in between two consecutive code levels.

Example:
* Coding scheme as in figure 1
* Full scale measurement range = 0 to 1 volt
* ADC resolution is 3 bits: 23 = 8 quantization levels (codes)
* ADC voltage resolution, &quot;Q&quot; = 1 V / ( 23 - 1 ) = 0.143 V (intervals)

In many cases, the useful resolution of a converter is limited by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and other errors in the overall system expressed as an ENOB.

====Quantization error====
Quantization error is introduced by the quantization inherent in an ideal ADC. It is a rounding error between the analog input voltage to the ADC and the output digitized value. The error is nonlinear and signal-dependent. In an ideal ADC, where the quantization error is uniformly distributed between − LSB and + LSB, and the signal has a uniform distribution covering all quantization levels, the signal-to-quantization-noise ratio (SQNR) is given by

:formula_4

where Q is the number of quantization bits. For example, for a 16-bit ADC, the quantization error is 96.3 dB below the maximum level.

Quantization error is distributed from DC to the Nyquist frequency. Consequently, if part of the ADC&#x27;s bandwidth is not used, as is the case with oversampling, some of the quantization error will occur out-of-band, effectively improving the SQNR for the bandwidth in use. In an oversampled system, noise shaping can be used to further increase SQNR by forcing more quantization error out of band.

====Dither====
In ADCs, performance can usually be improved using dither. This is a very small amount of random noise (e.g. white noise), which is added to the input before conversion. Its effect is to randomize the state of the LSB based on the signal. Rather than the signal simply getting cut off altogether at low levels, it extends the effective range of signals that the ADC can convert, at the expense of a slight increase in noise. Dither can only increase the resolution of a sampler. It cannot improve the linearity, and thus accuracy does not necessarily improve.

Quantization distortion in an audio signal of very low level with respect to the bit depth of the ADC is correlated with the signal and sounds distorted and unpleasant. With dithering, the distortion is transformed into noise. The undistorted signal may be recovered accurately by averaging over time. Dithering is also used in integrating systems such as electricity meters. Since the values are added together, the dithering produces results that are more exact than the LSB of the analog-to-digital converter.

Dither is often applied when quantizing photographic images to a fewer number of bits per pixel—the image becomes noisier but to the eye looks far more realistic than the quantized image, which otherwise becomes banded. This analogous process may help to visualize the effect of dither on an analog audio signal that is converted to digital.

===Accuracy===
An ADC has several sources of errors. Quantization error and (assuming the ADC is intended to be linear) non-linearity are intrinsic to any analog-to-digital conversion. These errors are measured in a unit called the least significant bit (LSB). In the above example of an eight-bit ADC, an error of one LSB is of the full signal range, or about 0.4%.

====Nonlinearity====
All ADCs suffer from nonlinearity errors caused by their physical imperfections, causing their output to deviate from a linear function (or some other function, in the case of a deliberately nonlinear ADC) of their input. These errors can sometimes be mitigated by calibration, or prevented by testing. Important parameters for linearity are integral nonlinearity and differential nonlinearity. These nonlinearities introduce distortion that can reduce the signal-to-noise ratio performance of the ADC and thus reduce its effective resolution.

===Jitter===
When digitizing a sine wave formula_5, the use of a non-ideal sampling clock will result in some uncertainty in when samples are recorded. Provided that the actual sampling time uncertainty due to clock jitter is formula_6, the error caused by this phenomenon can be estimated as formula_7. This will result in additional recorded noise that will reduce the effective number of bits (ENOB) below that predicted by quantization error alone. The error is zero for DC, small at low frequencies, but significant with signals of high amplitude and high frequency. The effect of jitter on performance can be compared to quantization error: formula_8, where q is the number of ADC bits.

Clock jitter is caused by phase noise. The resolution of ADCs with a digitization bandwidth between 1 MHz and 1 GHz is limited by jitter. For lower bandwidth conversions such as when sampling audio signals at 44.1 kHz, clock jitter has a less significant impact on performance.

===Sampling rate===
An analog signal is continuous in time and it is necessary to convert this to a flow of digital values. It is therefore required to define the rate at which new digital values are sampled from the analog signal. The rate of new values is called the &quot;sampling rate&quot; or &quot;sampling frequency&quot; of the converter. A continuously varying bandlimited signal can be sampled and then the original signal can be reproduced from the discrete-time values by a reconstruction filter. The Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem implies that a faithful reproduction of the original signal is only possible if the sampling rate is higher than twice the highest frequency of the signal.

Since a practical ADC cannot make an instantaneous conversion, the input value must necessarily be held constant during the time that the converter performs a conversion (called the &quot;conversion time&quot;). An input circuit called a sample and hold performs this task—in most cases by using a capacitor to store the analog voltage at the input, and using an electronic switch or gate to disconnect the capacitor from the input. Many ADC integrated circuits include the sample and hold subsystem internally.

====Aliasing====

An ADC works by sampling the value of the input at discrete intervals in time. Provided that the input is sampled above the Nyquist rate, defined as twice the highest frequency of interest, then all frequencies in the signal can be reconstructed. If frequencies above half the Nyquist rate are sampled, they are incorrectly detected as lower frequencies, a process referred to as aliasing. Aliasing occurs because instantaneously sampling a function at two or fewer times per cycle results in missed cycles, and therefore the appearance of an incorrectly lower frequency. For example, a 2 kHz sine wave being sampled at 1.5 kHz would be reconstructed as a 500 Hz sine wave.

To avoid aliasing, the input to an ADC must be low-pass filtered to remove frequencies above half the sampling rate. This filter is called an &quot;anti-aliasing filter&quot;, and is essential for a practical ADC system that is applied to analog signals with higher frequency content. In applications where protection against aliasing is essential, oversampling may be used to greatly reduce or even eliminate it.

Although aliasing in most systems is unwanted, it can be exploited to provide simultaneous down-mixing of a band-limited high-frequency signal (see undersampling and frequency mixer). The alias is effectively the lower heterodyne of the signal frequency and sampling frequency.

====Oversampling====

For economy, signals are often sampled at the minimum rate required with the result that the quantization error introduced is white noise spread over the whole passband of the converter. If a signal is sampled at a rate much higher than the Nyquist rate and then digitally filtered to limit it to the signal bandwidth produces the following advantages:
* Oversampling can make it easier to realize analog anti-aliasing filters
* Improved audio bit depth
* Reduced noise, especially when noise shaping is employed in addition to oversampling.

Oversampling is typically used in audio frequency ADCs where the required sampling rate (typically 44.1 or 48 kHz) is very low compared to the clock speed of typical transistor circuits (&gt;1 MHz). In this case, the performance of the ADC can be greatly increased at little or no cost. Furthermore, as any aliased signals are also typically out of band, aliasing can often be eliminated using very low cost filters.

===Relative speed and precision===
The speed of an ADC varies by type. The Wilkinson ADC is limited by the clock rate which is processable by current digital circuits. For a successive-approximation ADC, the conversion time scales with the logarithm of the resolution, i.e. the number of bits. Flash ADCs are certainly the fastest type of the three; The conversion is basically performed in a single parallel step.

There is a potential tradeoff between speed and precision. Flash ADCs have drifts and uncertainties associated with the comparator levels results in poor linearity. To a lesser extent, poor linearity can also be an issue for successive-approximation ADCs. Here, nonlinearity arises from accumulating errors from the subtraction processes. Wilkinson ADCs have the best linearity of the three.

===Sliding scale principle===
The sliding scale or randomizing method can be employed to greatly improve the linearity of any type of ADC, but especially flash and successive approximation types. For any ADC the mapping from input voltage to digital output value is not exactly a floor or ceiling function as it should be. Under normal conditions, a pulse of a particular amplitude is always converted to the same digital value. The problem lies in that the ranges of analog values for the digitized values are not all of the same widths, and the differential linearity decreases proportionally with the divergence from the average width. The sliding scale principle uses an averaging effect to overcome this phenomenon. A random, but known analog voltage is added to the sampled input voltage. It is then converted to digital form, and the equivalent digital amount is subtracted, thus restoring it to its original value. The advantage is that the conversion has taken place at a random point. The statistical distribution of the final levels is decided by a weighted average over a region of the range of the ADC. This in turn desensitizes it to the width of any specific level.

==Types==
These are several common ways of implementing an electronic ADC.

=== RC charge time ===
Resistor-capacitor (RC) circuits have a known voltage charging and discharging curve that can be used to solve for an unknown analog value.

==== Wilkinson ====
The Wilkinson ADC was designed by Denys Wilkinson in 1950. The Wilkinson ADC is based on the comparison of an input voltage with that produced by a charging capacitor. The capacitor is allowed to charge until a comparator determines it matches the input voltage. Then, the capacitor is discharged linearly by using a constant current source. The time required to discharge the capacitor is proportional to the amplitude of the input voltage. While the capacitor is discharging, pulses from a high-frequency oscillator clock are counted by a register. The number of clock pulses recorded in the register is also proportional to the input voltage.

==== Measuring analog resistance or capacitance ====
If the analog value to measure is represented by a resistance or capacitance, then by including that element in an RC circuit (with other resistances or capacitances fixed) and measuring the time to charge the capacitance from a known starting voltage to another known ending voltage through the resistance from a known voltage supply, the value of the unknown resistance or capacitance can be determined using the capacitor charging equation:

formula_9

and solving for the unknown resistance or capacitance using those starting and ending datapoints. This is similar but contrasts to the Wilkinson ADC which measures an unknown voltage with a known resistance and capacitance, by instead measuring an unknown resistance or capacitance with a known voltage.

For example, the positive (and/or negative) pulse width from a 555 Timer IC in monostable or astable mode represents the time it takes to charge (and/or discharge) its capacitor from  &quot;V&quot;supply to  &quot;V&quot;supply. By sending this pulse into a microcontroller with an accurate clock, the duration of the pulse can be measured and converted using the capacitor charging equation to produce the value of the unknown resistance or capacitance.

Larger resistances and capacitances will take a longer time to measure than smaller one. And the accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the microcontroller clock and the amount of time available to measure the value, which potentially might even change during measurement or be affected by external parasitics.

===Direct-conversion===

A direct-conversion or flash ADC has a bank of comparators sampling the input signal in parallel, each firing for a specific voltage range. The comparator bank feeds a digital encoder logic circuit that generates a binary number on the output lines for each voltage range.

ADCs of this type have a large die size and high power dissipation. They are often used for video, wideband communications, or other fast signals in optical and magnetic storage.

The circuit consists of a resistive divider network, a set of op-amp comparators and a priority encoder. A small amount of hysteresis is built into the comparator to resolve any problems at voltage boundaries. At each node of the resistive divider, a comparison voltage is available. The purpose of the circuit is to compare the analog input voltage with each of the node voltages.

The circuit has the advantage of high speed as the conversion takes place simultaneously rather than sequentially. Typical conversion time is 100 ns or less. Conversion time is limited only by the speed of the comparator and of the priority encoder. This type of ADC has the disadvantage that the number of comparators required almost doubles for each added bit. Also, the larger the value of n, the more complex is the priority encoder.

===Successive approximation ===
A successive-approximation ADC uses a comparator and a binary search to successively narrow a range that contains the input voltage. At each successive step, the converter compares the input voltage to the output of an internal digital-to-analog converter (DAC) which initially represents the midpoint of the allowed input voltage range. At each step in this process, the approximation is stored in a successive approximation register (SAR) and the output of the digital-to-analog converter is updated for a comparison over a narrower range.

===Ramp-compare===
A ramp-compare ADC produces a saw-tooth signal that ramps up or down then quickly returns to zero.
When the ramp starts, a timer starts counting. When the ramp voltage matches the input, a comparator fires, and the timer&#x27;s value is recorded. Timed ramp converters can be implemented economically, however, the ramp time may be sensitive to temperature because the circuit generating the ramp is often a simple analog integrator. A more accurate converter uses a clocked counter driving a DAC. A special advantage of the ramp-compare system is that converting a second signal just requires another comparator and another register to store the timer value. To reduce sensitivity to input changes during conversion, a sample and hold can charge a capacitor with the instantaneous input voltage and the converter can time the time required to discharge with a constant current.

===Integrating ===
An integrating ADC (also dual-slope or multi-slope ADC) applies the unknown input voltage to the input of an integrator and allows the voltage to ramp for a fixed time period (the run-up period). Then a known reference voltage of opposite polarity is applied to the integrator and is allowed to ramp until the integrator output returns to zero (the run-down period). The input voltage is computed as a function of the reference voltage, the constant run-up time period, and the measured run-down time period. The run-down time measurement is usually made in units of the converter&#x27;s clock, so longer integration times allow for higher resolutions. Likewise, the speed of the converter can be improved by sacrificing resolution. Converters of this type (or variations on the concept) are used in most digital voltmeters for their linearity and flexibility.
; Charge balancing ADC: The principle of charge balancing ADC is to first convert the input signal to a frequency using a voltage-to-frequency converter. This frequency is then measured by a counter and converted to an output code proportional to the analog input. The main advantage of these converters is that it is possible to transmit frequency even in a noisy environment or in isolated form. However, the limitation of this circuit is that the output of the voltage-to-frequency converter depends upon an RC product whose value cannot be accurately maintained over temperature and time.
; Dual-slope ADC: The analog part of the circuit consists of a high input impedance buffer, precision integrator and a voltage comparator. The converter first integrates the analog input signal for a fixed duration and then it integrates an internal reference voltage of opposite polarity until the integrator output is zero. The main disadvantage of this circuit is the long duration time. They are particularly suitable for accurate measurement of slowly varying signals such as thermocouples and weighing scales.

===Delta-encoded===
A &quot;delta-encoded&quot; or &quot;counter-ramp&quot; ADC has an up-down counter that feeds a DAC. The input signal and the DAC both go to a comparator. The comparator controls the counter. The circuit uses negative feedback from the comparator to adjust the counter until the DAC&#x27;s output matches the input signal and number is read from the counter. Delta converters have very wide ranges and high resolution, but the conversion time is dependent on the input signal behavior, though it will always have a guaranteed worst-case. Delta converters are often very good choices to read real-world signals as most signals from physical systems do not change abruptly. Some converters combine the delta and successive approximation approaches; this works especially well when high frequency components of the input signal are known to be small in magnitude.

===Pipelined===
A &quot;pipelined ADC&quot; (also called &quot;subranging quantizer&quot;) uses two or more conversion steps. First, a coarse conversion is done. In a second step, the difference to the input signal is determined with a DAC. This difference is then converted more precisely, and the results are combined in the last step. This can be considered a refinement of the successive-approximation ADC wherein the feedback reference signal consists of the interim conversion of a whole range of bits (for example, four bits) rather than just the next-most-significant bit. By combining the merits of the successive approximation and flash ADCs this type is fast, has a high resolution, and can be implemented efficiently.

===Delta-sigma===

A delta-sigma ADC (also known as a sigma-delta ADC) is based on a negative feedback loop with an analog filter and low resolution (often 1 bit) but high sampling rate ADC and DAC. The feedback loop continuously corrects accumulated quantization errors and performs noise shaping: quantization noise is reduced in the low frequencies of interest, but is increased in higher frequencies. Those higher frequencies may then be removed by a downsampling digital filter, which also converts the data stream from that high sampling rate with low bit depth to a lower rate with higher bit depth.

===Time-interleaved===
A time-interleaved ADC uses M parallel ADCs where each ADC samples data every M:th cycle of the effective sample clock. The result is that the sample rate is increased M times compared to what each individual ADC can manage. In practice, the individual differences between the M ADCs degrade the overall performance reducing the spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR). However, techniques exist to correct for these time-interleaving mismatch errors.

===Intermediate FM stage===
An ADC with an intermediate FM stage first uses a voltage-to-frequency converter to produce an oscillating signal with a frequency proportional to the voltage of the input signal, and then uses a frequency counter to convert that frequency into a digital count proportional to the desired signal voltage. Longer integration times allow for higher resolutions. Likewise, the speed of the converter can be improved by sacrificing resolution. The two parts of the ADC may be widely separated, with the frequency signal passed through an opto-isolator or transmitted wirelessly. Some such ADCs use sine wave or square wave frequency modulation; others use pulse-frequency modulation. Such ADCs were once the most popular way to show a digital display of the status of a remote analog sensor.

===Time-stretch===
A time-stretch analog-to-digital converter (TS-ADC) digitizes a very wide bandwidth analog signal, that cannot be digitized by a conventional electronic ADC, by time-stretching the signal prior to digitization. It commonly uses a photonic preprocessor to time-stretch the signal, which effectively slows the signal down in time and compresses its bandwidth. As a result, an electronic ADC, that would have been too slow to capture the original signal, can now capture this slowed-down signal. For continuous capture of the signal, the front end also divides the signal into multiple segments in addition to time-stretching. Each segment is individually digitized by a separate electronic ADC. Finally, a digital signal processor rearranges the samples and removes any distortions added by the preprocessor to yield the binary data that is the digital representation of the original analog signal.

=== Measuring physical values other than voltage ===

Although the term ADC is usually associated with measurement of an analog voltage, some partially-electronic devices that convert some measurable physical analog quantity into a digital number can also be considered ADCs, for instance:

* Rotary encoders convert from an analog physical quantity that mechanically produces an amount of rotation into a stream of digital Gray code that a microcontroller can digitally interpret to derive the direction of rotation, angular position, and rotational speed.
* Capacitive sensing converts from the analog physical quantity of a capacitance. That capacitance could be a proxy for some other physical quantity, such as the distance some metal object is from a metal sensing plate, or the amount of water in a tank, or the permittivity of a dielectric material.
** Capacitive-to-digital (CDC) converters determine capacitance by applying a known excitation to a plate of a capacitor and measuring its charge.
* Digital calipers convert from the analog physical quantity of an amount of displacement between two sliding rulers.
* Inductive-to-digital converters measure a change of inductance by a conductive target moving in an inductor&#x27;s AC magnetic field.
* Time-to-digital converters recognize events and provide a digital representation of the analog time they occurred.
** Time of flight measurements for instance can convert from some analog quantity that affects a propagation delay for an event.
* Sensors in general that don&#x27;t directly produce a voltage may indirectly produce a voltage or through other ways be converted into a digital value.
** Resistive output (e.g. from a potentiometer or a force-sensing resistor) can be made into a voltage by sending a known current through it, or can be made into a RC charging time measurement, to produce a digital result.

== Commercial ==

In many cases, the most expensive part of an integrated circuit is the pins, because they make the package larger, and each pin has to be connected to the integrated circuit&#x27;s silicon. To save pins, it is common for ADCs to send their data one bit at a time over a serial interface to the computer, with each bit coming out when a clock signal changes state. This saves quite a few pins on the ADC package, and in many cases, does not make the overall design any more complex.

Commercial ADCs often have several inputs that feed the same converter, usually through an analog multiplexer. Different models of ADC may include sample and hold circuits, instrumentation amplifiers or differential inputs, where the quantity measured is the difference between two inputs.

==Applications==

===Music recording===
Analog-to-digital converters are integral to modern music reproduction technology and digital audio workstation-based sound recording. Music may be produced on computers using an analog recording and therefore analog-to-digital converters are needed to create the pulse-code modulation (PCM) data streams that go onto compact discs and digital music files. The current crop of analog-to-digital converters utilized in music can sample at rates up to 192 kilohertz. Many recording studios record in 24-bit 96 kHz pulse-code modulation (PCM) format and then downsample and dither the signal for Compact Disc Digital Audio production (44.1 kHz) or to 48 kHz for radio and television broadcast applications.

===Digital signal processing===
ADCs are required in digital signal processing systems that process, store, or transport virtually any analog signal in digital form. TV tuner cards, for example, use fast video analog-to-digital converters. Slow on-chip 8-, 10-, 12-, or 16-bit analog-to-digital converters are common in microcontrollers. Digital storage oscilloscopes need very fast analog-to-digital converters, also crucial for software-defined radio and their new applications.

===Scientific instruments===
Digital imaging systems commonly use analog-to-digital converters for digitizing pixels. Some radar systems use analog-to-digital converters to convert signal strength to digital values for subsequent signal processing. Many other in situ and remote sensing systems commonly use analogous technology.

Many sensors in scientific instruments produce an analog signal; temperature, pressure, pH, light intensity etc. All these signals can be amplified and fed to an ADC to produce a digital representation.

===Displays===
Flat-panel displays are inherently digital and need an ADC to process an analog signal such as composite or VGA.

==Electrical symbol==
==Testing==

Testing an analog-to-digital converter requires an analog input source and hardware to send control signals and capture digital data output. Some ADCs also require an accurate source of reference signal.

The key parameters to test an ADC are:
# DC offset error
# DC gain error
# signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
# Total harmonic distortion (THD)
# Integral nonlinearity (INL)
# Differential nonlinearity (DNL)
# Spurious free dynamic range
# Power dissipation

<text>John Edward Thaw (3 January 1942 – 21 February 2002) was an English actor in television, stage and cinema, best known for his starring roles in the television series &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; as Detective Chief Inspector Endeavour Morse and in &quot;The Sweeney&quot; as Detective Inspector Jack Regan. 

For four consecutive years Thaw was nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor for playing Morse, winning in 1990 and 1993. In 1988, he was also nominated for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role for the film &quot;Cry Freedom&quot; and in 2001 was awarded the BAFTA Fellowship.

==Early life==
Born in Gorton, Manchester, to John Edward (&quot;Jack&quot;) Thaw, a tool-setter at the Fairey Aviation Company aircraft factory, later a long-distance lorry driver, and Dorothy (née Ablott). Dorothy left when he was seven years old. He and his younger brother, Raymond Stuart (Ray) had a difficult childhood due to their father&#x27;s long absences. Thaw grew up in Gorton and Burnage, attending the Ducie Technical High School for Boys, gaining just one O level. He entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) at the age of 16 (two years underage), and won the Academy&#x27;s Vanburgh Award. Ray emigrated to Australia in the mid-1960s.

==Career==
In 1960, Thaw made his stage début in &quot;A Shred of Evidence&quot; at the Liverpool Playhouse and was awarded a contract with the theatre. His first film role was a bit part in &quot;The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner&quot; (1962) starring Tom Courtenay and he also acted on-stage opposite Sir Laurence Olivier in &quot;Semi-Detached&quot; (1962). In 1963/64, he appeared in several episodes of the BBC series &quot;Z-Cars&quot; as a detective constable. Between 1964 and 1966, he starred in two series of the ABC Weekend Television/ITV production &quot;Redcap&quot;, playing the hard-nosed military policeman Sergeant John Mann. He was also a guest star in an early episode of &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In 1967 he appeared in &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; and in the Granada TV/ITV series, &quot;Inheritance&quot;, alongside James Bolam and Michael Goodliffe; TV plays including &quot;The Talking Head,&quot; and episodes of series such as &quot;Budgie&quot;, where he played against type as an effeminate failed playwright with a full beard and a Welsh accent.
Thaw was only 32 when he was cast in &quot;The Sweeney (1975–1978)&quot; alongside Dennis Waterman and Garfield Morgan, although many viewers thought he was older. His role as the hard-bitten, tough-talking Flying Squad detective Jack Regan established him as a major star in the United Kingdom. He followed this dramatic series with the comedy series &quot;Home to Roost&quot; (1985–1990), which co-starred Reece Dinsdale, about a divorced father whose teenage son moves back in with him after choosing as a child to live with his mother. The show ran for four series.

It was his role as Detective Chief Inspector Endeavour Morse in &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; (1987–93, with later specials until 2000), which cemented his fame. Alongside his put-upon Detective Sergeant Robert &quot;Robbie&quot; Lewis (Kevin Whately), Morse became a high-profile character—&quot;a cognitive curmudgeon with his love of classical music, his drinking, his classic Jaguar and spates of melancholy&quot;. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Thaw was the definitive Morse, grumpy, crossword-fixated, drunk, slightly anti-feminist, and pedantic about grammar.&quot; &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; became one of the UK&#x27;s most loved TV series; at its peak in the mid-&#x27;90s, ratings hit 18 million people, about one third of the British population. He won &quot;Most Popular Actor&quot; at the 1999 National Television Awards and won two BAFTA awards for his role as Morse.

He subsequently played liberal working-class Lancastrian barrister James Kavanagh in &quot;Kavanagh QC&quot; (1995–99, and a special in 2001). Thaw also appeared in two sitcoms—&quot;Thick as Thieves&quot; (London Weekend/ITV, 1974) with Bob Hoskins and &quot;Home to Roost&quot; (Yorkshire/ITV, 1985–90). Thaw is mainly known in America for the Morse series, as well as the BBC series &quot;A Year in Provence&quot; (1993) with Lindsay Duncan.

He appeared in a number of films for director Richard Attenborough, including &quot;Cry Freedom&quot;, where he portrayed the conservative South African justice minister Jimmy Kruger (for which he received a BAFTA nomination for Best Supporting Actor), and &quot;Chaplin&quot; where he played the English music hall impresario Fred Karno alongside Robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin).

Thaw also appeared in the TV adaptation of the Michelle Magorian book &quot;Goodnight Mister Tom&quot; (Carlton Television/ITV). It won &quot;Most Popular Drama&quot; at the National Television Awards, 1999.

During the 1970s and 1980s, Thaw appeared in productions with the Royal Shakespeare Company and National Theatre.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1981 when he was surprised by Eamonn Andrews in the foyer of the National Theatre in London.

==Personal life==
In 1964, Thaw married Sally Alexander, a feminist activist and stage manager, now professor of history at Goldsmiths, University of London. They divorced four years later. He met actress Sheila Hancock in 1969 on the set of &quot;So What About Love?&quot; She was married to fellow actor Alexander &quot;Alec&quot; Ross. They became friends, but she refused to have an affair as she did not want to disrupt her daughter&#x27;s life. Following the death of her husband (from oesophageal cancer) in 1971, Thaw and Hancock married on 24 December 1973 in Cirencester. They remained together until his death in 2002 (also from oesophageal cancer).

He had three daughters (all actresses): Abigail from his first marriage to Sally Alexander, Joanna from his second marriage to Sheila Hancock, and he also adopted Sheila Hancock&#x27;s daughter Melanie Jane, from Hancock&#x27;s first marriage to Alec Ross. His granddaughter Molly Whitmey made a cameo in the &quot;Endeavour&quot; episode &quot;Oracle&quot; (series 7, episode 1, broadcast 9 February 2020) as the younger version of her grandmother Sally Alexander.

Thaw was a committed socialist and a lifelong supporter of the Labour Party. He was appointed a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE) in March 1993 by Queen Elizabeth II. In September 2006, Thaw was voted by the general public as number 3, after David Jason and Morecambe and Wise, in a poll of TV&#x27;s 50 Greatest Stars for the past 50 years.

==Illness and death==
A heavy drinker until going teetotal in 1995, and a heavy smoker from the age of 12, Thaw was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus in June 2001. He underwent chemotherapy in hope of overcoming the illness, and at first had appeared to respond well to the treatment. However, just before Christmas 2001 he was informed that the cancer had spread and the prognosis was terminal.

He died on 21 February 2002, seven weeks after his 60th birthday, the day after he signed a new contract with ITV, and the day before his wife&#x27;s birthday. At the time of his death he was living at his country home, near the villages of Luckington and Sherston in Wiltshire, and was cremated in Westerleigh, near Yate in South Gloucestershire, in a private service. A memorial service was held on 4 September 2002 at St Martin-in-the-Fields church in Trafalgar Square, attended by 800 people including Charles, Prince of Wales, Richard Attenborough, Tom Courtenay and Cherie Blair.

<text>Space technology is technology for use in outer space. Space technology includes space vehicles such as spacecraft, satellites, space stations and orbital launch vehicles; deep-space communication; in-space propulsion; and a wide variety of other technologies including support infrastructure equipment, and procedures.

Many common everyday services for terrestrial use such as weather forecasting, remote sensing, satellite navigation systems, satellite television, and some long-distance communications systems critically rely on space infrastructure. Of the sciences, astronomy and Earth science benefit from space technology. New technologies originating with or accelerated by space-related endeavors are often subsequently exploited in other economic activities.

== History of space technology ==

The first country on Earth to put any technology into space was the Soviet Union, formerly known as the &quot;Union of Soviet Socialist Republics&quot; (USSR). The USSR sent the Sputnik 1 satellite on October 4, 1957. It weighed about , and is believed to have orbited around the globe. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere, while temperature and pressure data was encoded in the duration of radio beeps.

The first successful human spaceflight was &quot;Vostok 1&quot;, carrying 27-year-old Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin in April 1961. The entire mission was controlled by either automatic systems or by ground control. This was because medical staff and spacecraft engineers were unsure how a human might react to weightlessness, and therefore it was decided to lock the pilot&#x27;s manual controls.

The first probe to impact the surface of the Moon was the Soviet probe Luna 2, which made a hard landing on September 14, 1959. The far side of the Moon was first photographed on October 7, 1959, by the Soviet probe Luna 3.s
On December 24, 1968, the crew of Apollo 8, Frank Borman, James Lovell and William Anders, became the first human beings to enter lunar orbit and see the far side of the Moon in person. Humans first landed on the Moon on July 20, 1969. The first human to walk on the lunar surface was Neil Armstrong, commander of Apollo 11. The first space probe to land on moon South Pole of India.Chandrayaan-3 was launched aboard an LVM3-M4 rocket on 14 July 2023, at 09:05 UTC from Satish Dhawan Space Centre Second Launch Pad in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, India, entering an Earth parking orbit with a perigee of 170 km (106 mi) and an apogee of 36,500 km (22,680 mi).

Apollo 11 was followed by Apollo 12, 14, 15, 16, and 17. Apollo 13 had a failure of the Apollo service module, but passed the far side of the Moon at an altitude of above the lunar surface, and 400,171 km (248,655 mi) from Earth, marking the record for the farthest humans traveled from Earth in 1970.

The first robotic lunar rover to land on the Moon was the Soviet vessel Lunokhod 1 on November 17, 1970, as part of the Lunokhod program. To date, the last human to stand on the Moon was Eugene Cernan, who, as part of the Apollo 17 mission, walked on the Moon in December 1972. Apollo 17 was followed by several uncrewed interplanetary missions operated by NASA. Also Technological innovations in space exploration have important effects on the economy, society, and the environment.

Economically, new safety features and technology have made space missions cheaper. Using reusable rockets helps companies save money because they do not need to fix or replace rockets as often. This makes space exploration more affordable and encourages more people to invest in the space industry.

Socially, these new technologies have created many jobs in areas like engineering, research, and aerospace manufacturing. The growth of the space industry also helps other industries, such as telecommunications and materials engineering, by creating new job opportunities.

Environmentally, using reusable rockets helps reduce space debris. By reusing rockets, space agencies can produce less waste and lessen the impact of space missions on the environment. This approach supports cleaner space exploration and a more sustainable future.

In summary, technological advances in space exploration positively affect the economy, create jobs, and promote environmental sustainability, helping the field continue to grow.

One of the notable interplanetary missions is &quot;Voyager 1&quot;, the first artificial object to leave the Solar System into interstellar space on August 25, 2012. It is also the most distant artificial object from Earth. The probe passed the heliopause at 121 AU to enter interstellar space. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; is currently at a distance of (21.708 billion kilometers; 13.489 billion miles) from Earth as of January 1, 2019.

<text>Ole Einar Bjørndalen (; born 27 January 1974) is a retired Norwegian professional biathlete and coach, often referred to by the nickname, the &quot;King of Biathlon&quot;. With 13 Winter Olympic Games medals, he is second on the list of multiple medalists behind Marit Bjørgen who has won 15 medals. He is also the most successful biathlete of all time at the Biathlon World Championships, having won 45 medals. With 95 World Cup wins, Bjørndalen is ranked first all-time for career victories on the Biathlon World Cup tour. He has won the Overall World Cup title six times, in 1997–98, in 2002–03, in 2004–05, in 2005–06, in 2007–08 and in 2008–09.

In 1992, he won his first career medal at the junior world championships. A year later in 1993, after winning three junior world championship titles, a medal haul only previously achieved by Sergei Tchepikov, Bjørndalen made his Biathlon World Cup debut. His breakthrough came in 1994 when he featured on his first World Cup podium in a sprint race held in Bad Gastein, Austria. Bjørndalen first competed in the Olympic Games at the Lillehammer 1994 Winter Olympics, held in his home country of Norway. He obtained his first major victory on 11 January 1996 in an individual competition held in Antholz-Anterselva, Italy. On 20 February 2014, Bjørndalen was elected to an eight-year term at the International Olympic Committee&#x27;s athlete commission. He resigned from this role in 2016 as he elected to continue his career.

==Career==

At the age of 16 Bjørndalen left home to pursue his sporting career at a sports academy in Geilo, where he initially trained in both cross-country skiing and biathlon, although after one year there he decided to focus on the latter.

In 1993, at the age of 19, Bjørndalen first came into focus by winning 3 out of 4 possible gold medals at the Junior Biathlon World Championships, which among other things led to him being chosen to represent Norway in the 1994 Olympics, at the cost of highly merited biathlete Eirik Kvalfoss. At those Games Bjørndalen&#x27;s best finish was a 28th position in the sprint.

He has won the World Cup six times (1997–98, 2002–03, 2004–05, 2005–06, 2007–08, and 2008–09), finished second six times (1996–97, 1998–99, 1999–2000, 2000–01, 2003–04, and 2006–07), and third once (2001–02). In his first season (1992–93) he finished 62nd, the season after, 30th and the season after that, fourth. In the 1995–96 season, he dropped down to ninth, but finished in the runner-up position in 1996–97. When winning the overall world cup in 1998, at the age of 24, he won titles at each of the three major championships in biathlon in one season – a world championship gold medal, an Olympic gold medal and the overall World Cup title. He finished second in the overall World Cup for the following three seasons and then third in 2001–02.

His World Cup podium record is 179 podium finishes, 95 1st places, 53 2nd places, and 31 3rd places in the individual events. Bjørndalen has 1 World Cup victory in the team event.

It happened in the: 1998–99, 2002–03, 2003–04, 2004–05, 2007–08, 2008–09, 2010–11, 2013–14, 2014–15 and 2015–16 season. Bjørndalen has also achieved five-second places in the nations cup in the years: 1999–00, 2000–01, 2001–02, 2005–06 and 2012–13. He has finished in third place in the nations cup 3 times, in the: 1996–97, 1997–98 and 2006–07 season. In total he has finished 18 times at the podium in the nations cup for men.

He is the only biathlete ever to win all biathlon events in a single Winter Olympics (2002 Salt Lake City Games). This encompassed the sprint, pursuit, individual, and relay events, the latter together with three other participants. He was the most successful competitor at these Games. This also made him only the third Winter Olympian to win four golds at one Games, and he was also the first biathlete to win more than two gold medals at a single Games. In addition, he had won all three competitions staged at the Olympic test event in Salt Lake City the previous year. He also took a four gold medal haul at the Biathlon World Championships 2005 in Hochfilzen, Austria and at the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Bjørndalen&#x27;s 95 biathlon World Cup victories and one cross-country victory is two behind of Gunda Niemann-Stirnemann&#x27;s record of 98 World Cup victories for a winter sport athlete.

At the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Bjørndalen took three medals from five events, winning two silvers and a bronze. At the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics, Bjørndalen became the most successful biathlete in Winter Olympic history by surpassing the previous record of nine career Olympic medals, which he shared with Uschi Disl of Germany. He then anchored Norway to gold in the 4 × 7.5 km relay. This was the second time that Norway had won a title in this event, with the other being at the 2002 Winter Olympics (also anchored by Bjørndalen). With this victory he became the second most decorated Winter Olympian of all time and one of only two athletes to win 11 medals at the Winter Olympics. With his gold medal in 10 km sprint at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, he tied fellow Norwegian Bjørn Dæhlie for most Winter Olympic medals, with 12 in total, before overtaking Dæhlie by winning his second gold of the Games as part of the Norwegian mixed relay team.
Bjørndalen has won eight Olympic gold medals, four silver and a bronze. He has also won 20 World Championship gold medals, 14 silver and 11 bronze (more than anybody in biathlon history), along with a record 95 World Cup victories in biathlon and 1 World Cup victory in cross-country skiing, 179 podium finishes in biathlon individual races and 3 in cross-country skiing. He also finished in the top three of the Overall World Cup rankings for a record thirteen successive seasons between the 1996–97 and 2008–09 seasons. In total Ole Einar Bjørndalen has won 44 Norwegian Championship gold medals. He has won 30 gold medals in the Norwegian Championship, biathlon, winter event: 20 individual gold medals: individual (4), sprint (6), pursuit (6), mass start (4) and 10 gold medals in relay and the team event: relay (8) and team (2). Bjørndalen has also achieved 14 individual gold medals in the Norwegian Championship, biathlon, summer event: sprint (7) and pursuit (7).

In January 2018 Arne Botnan, the sporting director for Norwegian biathlon, announced that Bjørndalen would not be selected for the 2018 Winter Olympics, after he failed to achieve the qualifying standard of a top six finish in a World Cup race before the Norwegian Biathlon Association was due to nominate its Olympic squad on the 15th of that month. However, he did travel to the Games after being accredited as part of the Belarusian Olympic delegation as a coach, in order to support Darya Domracheva. On 3 April 2018 Bjørndalen announced his retirement from competition, explaining that his form had been affected by heart murmurs several times during the previous season.

In September 2019, Bjørndalen and Domracheva were appointed as head coach and women&#x27;s coach respectively of the Chinese biathlon team.

===2005–06 World Cup season===

Bjørndalen finished the 2005–06 International Biathlon Union World Cup season in first place, with Frenchman Raphaël Poirée in second place and German Sven Fischer in third. Bjørndalen lay in third place in the standings going into the last three races of the season in Holmenkollen, with Poirée in first, and Fischer in second. However, Bjørndalen won all three races, giving him six victories in the last eight races, and clinching the crystal globe. He also won the pursuit, and the mass start title, and came second in the individual and the sprint. In the pursuit he finished ahead of Fischer by 54 points, and 29 points ahead of Poirée in the mass start. In the individual he finished 41 points behind Michael Greis, and in the sprint he was 5 points behind Tomasz Sikora. Norway finished fourth in the relay.

Bjørndalen closed out the season by winning all three events (sprint, pursuit, and mass start) at the Holmenkollen ski festival biathlon competition. This put his career victories at the ski events to five, having won once both in 2003 (pursuit) and in 2004 (sprint).

===2006–07 World Cup season===

Bjørndalen made a perfect start to the season, winning all of the first five races in Östersund and Hochfilzen. In the fifth race of the season, the pursuit race in Hochfilzen, he won with one of his largest margins ever, more than 2 minutes. On 30 December 2006 Bjørndalen took part in the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen in the Veltins Arena. In front of about 51,000 people he won it for fourth time in a row. His partner for second consecutive time was Linda Grubben. They both left their rivals, the Robert family, more than one minute behind.

In Oberhof, coming down from training in the heights, Bjørndalen performed below standard for the season, and finishing only 30th and 5th in the individual competitions.
In Ruhpolding he led his teammates to victory in the relay event. He won the two following individual competitions. After competing in the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships Sapporo 2007, he missed several Biathlon World Cup events; after missing eight competitions altogether Bjørndalen finished second in the overall standings, after German Michael Greis.

===2008–09 World Cup season===

Bjørndalen started off the season suffering from the effects of long-term illness, but still placed second in both of the pursuit events. He missed the Biathlon World Team Challenge in Gelsenkirchen, focusing on training instead. After the break, he returned with victories in both the sprint and pursuit events in Ruhpolding and a third place in the mass start in Oberhof.

At the Biathlon World Championships 2009 in Pyeongchang, during the men&#x27;s 12.5 km pursuit, Bjørndalen with at least 15 other competitors accidentally skied the wrong way at the start of the first lap due to the bad marking. Just after leaving the start, the athletes skied over a bridge instead of skiing beside it, which was the right way. A jury meeting decided to give all these athletes a one-minute time penalty, following a complaint from the Russian team. However, another complaint by seven other member states led to the Appeal Jury reverting to the original result. Along with Bjørndalen&#x27;s first ever 20 km individual World Championship title, he won four out of six possible gold medals (10 km sprint, 12.5 km pursuit, 20 km individual and the 4 × 7.5 km relay).

After the World Championships Bjørndalen came second in the sprint in Vancouver, he took over the world cup overall lead. He followed up with a second place, and two victories at the events in Granåsen, Trondheim (the latter being a mass start where he shot clean). He secured his sixth overall win in the last sprint of the season, in Khanty-Mansiysk where he placed second. In the following event (a pursuit), he was beaten at the finish line by teammate Emil Hegle Svendsen, but won the pursuit cup.

His gloves and base layer are from Odlo, and he uses Casco glasses.

During the off-season in 2006 Bjørndalen was testing a new ski boot that had a high heel in the Torsby ski tunnel with boot manufacturers Madshus. The theory is that it forces the knee more forward for better position and it incorporates the large gluteal muscles.

<doc id="40389" wikidata="Q795427" url="?curid=40389" title="Upper Canada">
<text>The Province of Upper Canada () was a part of British Canada established in 1791 by the Kingdom of Great Britain, to govern the central third of the lands in British North America, formerly part of the Province of Quebec since 1763. Upper Canada included all of modern-day Southern Ontario and all those areas of Northern Ontario in the which had formed part of New France, essentially the watersheds of the Ottawa River or Lakes Huron and Superior, excluding any lands within the watershed of Hudson Bay. The &quot;upper&quot; prefix in the name reflects its geographic position along the Great Lakes, mostly above the headwaters of the Saint Lawrence River, contrasted with Lower Canada (present-day Quebec) to the northeast.

Upper Canada was the primary destination of Loyalist refugees and settlers from the United States after the American Revolution, who often were granted land to settle in Upper Canada. Already populated by Indigenous peoples, land for settlement in Upper Canada was made by treaties between the new British government and the Indigenous peoples, exchanging land for one-time payments or annuities. The new province was characterized by its British way of life, including bicameral parliament and separate civil and criminal law, rather than mixed as in Lower Canada or elsewhere in the British Empire. The division was created to ensure the exercise of the same rights and privileges enjoyed by loyal subjects elsewhere in the North American colonies. In 1812, war broke out between Great Britain and the United States, leading to several battles in Upper Canada. The United States attempted to capture Upper Canada, but the war ended with the situation unchanged.

The government of the colony came to be dominated by a small group of persons, known as the &quot;Family Compact&quot;, who held most of the top positions in the Legislative Council and appointed officials. In 1837, an unsuccessful rebellion attempted to overthrow the undemocratic system. Representative government would be established in the 1840s. Upper Canada existed from its establishment on 26 December 1791 to 10 February 1841, when it was united with adjacent Lower Canada to form the Province of Canada.

==Establishment==

As part of the 1763 Treaty of Paris which ended the Seven Years&#x27; War global conflict and the French and Indian War in North America, Great Britain retained control over the former New France, which had been defeated in the French and Indian War. The British had won control after Fort Niagara had surrendered in 1759 and Montreal capitulated in 1760, and the British under Robert Rogers took formal control of the Great Lakes region in 1760. Fort Michilimackinac was occupied by Roger&#x27;s forces in 1761.

The territories of contemporary southern Ontario and southern Quebec were initially maintained as the single province of Quebec, as it had been under the French. From 1763 to 1791, the Province of Quebec maintained its French language, cultural behavioural expectations, practices and laws. The British passed the &quot;Quebec Act&quot; in 1774, which expanded the Quebec colony&#x27;s authority to include part of the Indian Reserve to the west (i.e., parts of southern Ontario), and other western territories south of the Great Lakes including much of what would become the United States&#x27; Northwest Territory, including the modern states of Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin and parts of Minnesota.

After the American War of Independence ended in 1783, Britain retained control of the area north of the Ohio River. The official boundaries remained undefined until 1795 and the Jay Treaty. The British authorities encouraged the movement of people to this area from the United States, offering free land to encourage population growth. For settlers, the head of the family received and per family member, and soldiers received larger grants. These settlers are known as United Empire Loyalists and were primarily English-speaking Protestants. The first townships (Royal and Cataraqui) along the St. Lawrence and eastern Lake Ontario were laid out in 1784, populated mainly with decommissioned soldiers and their families.

&quot;Upper Canada&quot; became a political entity on 26 December 1791 with the Parliament of Great Britain&#x27;s passage of the &quot;Constitutional Act of 1791&quot;. The act divided the province of Quebec into Upper and Lower Canada, but did not yet specify official borders for Upper Canada. The division was effected so that Loyalist American settlers and British immigrants in Upper Canada could have English laws and institutions, and the French-speaking population of Lower Canada could maintain French civil law and the Catholic religion. The first lieutenant-governor was John Graves Simcoe.

The 1795 Jay Treaty officially set the borders between British North America and the United States north to the Great Lakes and St. Lawrence River. On 1 February 1796, the capital of Upper Canada was moved from Newark (now Niagara-on-the-Lake) to York (now Toronto), which was judged to be less vulnerable to attack by the US.

The Act of Union 1840, passed 23 July 1840 by the British Parliament and proclaimed by the Crown on 10 February 1841, merged Upper Canada with Lower Canada to form the short-lived United Province of Canada.

==Government==

===Provincial administration===
Upper Canada&#x27;s constitution was said to be &quot;the very image and transcript&quot; of the British constitution, and based on the principle of &quot;mixed monarchy&quot; – a balance of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy.

The Executive arm of government in the colony consisted of a lieutenant-governor, his executive council, and the Officers of the Crown (equivalent to the Officers of the Parliament of Canada): the Adjutant General of the Militia, the Attorney General, the Auditor General of Land Patents for Upper Canada, the Auditor General (only one appointment ever made), Crown Lands Office, Indian Office, Inspector General, Kings&#x27; Printer, Provincial Secretary and Registrar&#x27;s Office, Receiver General of Upper Canada, Solicitor General, and Surveyor General.

The Executive Council of Upper Canada had a similar function to the Cabinet in England but was not responsible to the Legislative Assembly. They held a consultative position, however, and did not serve in administrative offices as cabinet ministers do. Members of the Executive Council were not necessarily members of the Legislative Assembly but were usually members of the Legislative Council.

===Parliament===
The Legislative branch of the government consisted of the parliament comprising legislative council and legislative assembly. When the capital was first moved to Toronto (then called York) from Newark (present-day Niagara-on-the-Lake) in 1796, the Parliament Buildings of Upper Canada were at the corner of Parliament and Front Streets, in buildings that were burned by US forces in the War of 1812, rebuilt, then burned again by accident in 1824. The site was eventually abandoned for another, to the west.

The Legislative Council of Upper Canada was the upper house governing the province of Upper Canada. Although modelled after the British House of Lords, Upper Canada had no aristocracy. Members of the Legislative council, appointed for life, formed the core of the oligarchic group, the Family Compact, that came to dominate government and economy in the province.

The Legislative Assembly of Upper Canada functioned as the lower house in the Parliament of Upper Canada. Its legislative power was subject to veto by the appointed Lieutenant Governor, Executive Council, and Legislative Council.

===Districts and Local Government===
Local government in the province of Upper Canada was based on districts. Guy Carleton, 1st Baron Dorchester created four districts 24 July 1788.

*Lunenburgh District, later &quot;Eastern&quot;
*Mecklenburg District, later &quot;Midland&quot;
*Nassau District, later &quot;Home&quot;
*Hesse District, later &quot;Western&quot;

For militia and parliamentary purposes, Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe in a proclamation 16 July 1792 divided these districts into the nineteen original counties of Ontario: Glengarry, Stormont, Dundas, Grenville, Leeds, Frontenac, Ontario, Addington, Lennox, Prince Edward, Hastings, Northumberland, Durham, York, Lincoln, Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex and Kent.

By 1800, the four districts of Eastern, Midland, Home and Western had been increased to eight, the new ones being Johnston, Niagara, London and Newcastle. Additional districts were created from the existing districts as the population grew until 1849, when local government mainly based on counties came into effect. At that time, there were 20 districts; legislation to create a new Kent District was never completed. Up until 1841, the district officials were appointed by the lieutenant-governor, although usually with local input.

Justices of the Peace were appointed by the Lt. Governor. Any two justices meeting together could form the lowest level of the justice system, the Courts of Request. A Court of Quarter Sessions was held four times a year in each district composed of all the resident justices. The Quarter Sessions met to oversee the administration of the district and deal with legal cases. They formed, in effect, the municipal government until an area was incorporated as either a Police Board or a City after 1834.

==Politics==

===Family Compact===

The Family Compact is the epithet applied to an oligarchic group of men who exercised most of the political and judicial power in Upper Canada from the 1810s to the 1840s. It was noted for its conservatism and opposition to democracy. The uniting factors amongst the Compact were its loyalist tradition, hierarchical class structure and adherence to the established Anglican Church. Leaders such as John Beverley Robinson and John Strachan proclaimed it an ideal government, especially as contrasted with the rowdy democracy in the nearby United States. The Family Compact emerged from the War of 1812 and collapsed in the aftermath of the Rebellions of 1837.

===Reform movement===
There were many outstanding individual reform politicians in Upper Canada, including Robert Randal, Peter Perry, Marshall Spring Bidwell, William Ketchum and Dr. William Warren Baldwin; however, organised collective reform activity began with Robert Fleming Gourlay. Gourlay was a well-connected Scottish emigrant who arrived in 1817, hoping to encourage &quot;assisted emigration&quot; of the poor from Britain. He solicited information on the colony through township questionnaires, and soon became a critic of government mismanagement. When the local legislature ignored his call for an inquiry, he called for a petition to the British Parliament. He organised township meetings, and a provincial convention – which the government considered dangerous and seditious. Gourlay was tried in December 1818 under the 1804 Sedition Act and jailed for 8 months. He was banished from the province in August 1819. His expulsion made him a martyr in the reform community.

The next wave of organised Reform activity emerged in the 1830s through the work of William Lyon Mackenzie, James Lesslie, John Rolph, William John O&#x27;Grady and Dr Thomas Morrison, all of Toronto. They were critical to introducing the British Political Unions to Upper Canada. Political Unions were not parties. The unions organised petitions to Parliament.

The Upper Canada Central Political Union was organised in 1832–33 by Dr Thomas David Morrison (mayor of Toronto in 1836) while William Lyon Mackenzie was in England. This union collected 19,930 signatures on a petition protesting Mackenzie&#x27;s unjust expulsion from the House of Assembly by the Family Compact.

This union was reorganised as the Canadian Alliance Society (1835). It shared a large meeting space in the market buildings with the Mechanics Institute and the Children of Peace. The Canadian Alliance Society adopted much of the platform (such as secret ballot &amp; universal suffrage) of the Owenite National Union of the Working Classes in London, England, that were to be integrated into the Chartist movement in England.

The Canadian Alliance Society was reborn as the Constitutional Reform Society (1836), when it was led by the more moderate reformer, Dr William W. Baldwin. After the disastrous 1836 elections, it took the final form as the Toronto Political Union in 1837. It was the Toronto Political Union that called for a Constitutional Convention in July 1837, and began organising local &quot;Vigilance Committees&quot; to elect delegates. This became the organizational structure for the Rebellion of 1837.

===Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837===
The Upper Canada Rebellion was an insurrection against the oligarchic government of the Family Compact in December 1837, led by William Lyon Mackenzie. Long term grievances included antagonism between Later Loyalists and British Loyalists, political corruption, the collapse of the international financial system and the resultant economic distress, and a growing republican sentiment. While public grievances had existed for years, it was the Lower Canada Rebellion (in present-day Quebec) that emboldened rebels in Upper Canada to revolt openly soon after. The Upper Canada Rebellion was largely defeated shortly after it began, although resistance lingered until 1838 (and became more violent) – mainly through the support of the Hunters&#x27; Lodges, a secret anti-British American militia that emerged in states around the Great Lakes. They launched the Patriot War in 1838–39.

John Lambton, Lord Durham&#x27;s support for &quot;responsible government&quot; undercut the Tories and gradually led the public to reject what it viewed as poor administration, unfair land and education policies, and inadequate attention to urgent transportation needs. Durham&#x27;s report led to the administrative unification of Upper and Lower Canada as the Province of Canada in 1841. Responsible government did not occur until the late 1840s under Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine.

===Sydenham and the Union of the Canadas===

After the Rebellions, the new governor, Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham, proved an exemplary Utilitarian, despite his aristocratic pretensions. This combination of free trade and aristocratic pretensions needs to be underscored; although a liberal capitalist, Sydenham was no radical democrat. Sydenham approached the task of implementing those aspects of Durham&#x27;s report that the colonial office approved of, municipal reform, and the union of the Canadas, with a &quot;campaign of state violence and coercive institutional innovation ... empowered not just by the British state but also by his Benthamite certainties.&quot; Like governors Bond Head before him, and Metcalfe after, he was to turn to the Orange Order for often violent support. It was Sydenham who played a critical role in transforming Compact Tories into Conservatives.

Sydenham introduced a vast expansion of the state apparatus through the introduction of municipal government. Areas not already governed through civic corporations or police boards would be governed through centrally controlled District Councils with authority over roads, schools, and local policing. A strengthened Executive Council would further usurp much of the elected assembly&#x27;s legislative role, leaving elected politicians to simply review the administration&#x27;s legislative program and budgets.

==Settlement==

===First Nations dispossession and reserves===
The First Nations occupying the territory that was to become Upper Canada were:

*Anishinaabe or Anishinabe—or more properly (plural) Anishinaabeg or Anishinabek. The plural form of the word is the autonym often used by the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Algonquin peoples.
* The Iroquois, also known as the Haudenosaunee or the &quot;People of the Longhouse&quot;,

Prior to the creation of Upper Canada in 1791, much land had already been ceded by the First Nations to the Crown in accordance with the Royal Proclamation of 1763. The first treaty was between the Seneca and the British in 1764, giving access to lands adjoining the Niagara River. During the American Revolutionary War most of the First Nations supported the British. After the Americans launched a campaign that burned the villages of the Iroquois in New York State in 1779 the refugees fled to Fort Niagara and other British posts, and remained permanently in Canada.

Land was granted to these allied Six Nations who had served on the British side during the American Revolution by the Haldimand Proclamation (1784). Haldimand had purchased a tract of land from the Mississaugas. The nature of the grant and the administration of land sales by Upper Canada and Canada is a matter of dispute.

Between 1783 and 1812, fifteen land surrender treaties were concluded in Upper Canada. These involved one-time payments of money or goods to the Indigenous peoples. Some of the treaties spelled out designated reserve lands for the Indigenous peoples.

Following the War of 1812, European settlers came in increasing numbers. The Indian Department focussed on converting the Indigenous peoples to abandon their old way of life and adopt agriculture. The treaties shifted from one-time payments in exchange to annual annuities from the sale of surrendered lands. Between 1825 and 1860, treaties were concluded for nearly all of the land-mass of the future province of Ontario. In 1836, Manitoulin Island was designated as a reserve for dispossessed natives, but much of this was ceded in 1862.

===Loyalists and the land grant system===
Crown land policy to 1825 was multi-fold in the use of a &quot;free&quot; resource that had value to people who themselves may have little or no money for its purchase and for the price of settling upon it to support themselves and a create a new society. First, the cash-strapped Crown government in Canada could pay and reward the services and loyalty of the &quot;United Empire Loyalists&quot; who, originated outside of Canada, without encumbrance of debt by being awarded with small portions of land (under ) with the proviso that it be settled by those to which it was granted; Second, portions would be reserved for the future use of the Crown and the clergy that did not require settlement by which to gain control. Lt. Governor Simcoe saw this as the mechanism by which an aristocracy might be created, and that compact settlement could be avoided with the grants of large tracts of land to those Loyalists not required to settle on it as the means of gaining control.

====Assisted immigration====
The Calton weavers were a community of handweavers established in the community of Calton, then in Lanarkshire just outside Glasgow, Scotland in the 18th century. In the early 19th century, many of the weavers emigrated to Canada, settling in Carleton Place and other communities in eastern Ontario, where they continued their trade.

In 1825, 1,878 Irish Immigrants from the city of Cork arrived in the community of Scott&#x27;s Plains. The British Parliament had approved an experimental emigration plan to transport poor Irish families to Upper Canada in 1822. The scheme was managed by Peter Robinson, a member of the Family Compact and brother of the Attorney General. Scott&#x27;s Plains was renamed Peterborough in his honour.

====Talbot settlement====
Thomas Talbot emigrated in 1791, where he became personal secretary to John Graves Simcoe, Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. Talbot convinced the government to allow him to implement a land settlement scheme of in Elgin County in the townships of Dunwich and Aldborough in 1803. According to his government agreement, he was entitled to for every settler who received ; in this way he gained an estate of . Talbot&#x27;s administration was regarded as despotic. He was infamous for registering settlers&#x27; names on the local settlement map in pencil and if displeased, erasing their entry. Talbot&#x27;s abuse of power was a contributing factor in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837.

===Crown and clergy reserves===
The Crown reserves, one seventh of all lands granted, were to provide the provincial executive with an independent source of revenue not under the control of the elected Assembly. The clergy reserves, also one seventh of all lands granted in the province, were created &quot;for the support and maintenance of a Protestant clergy&quot; in lieu of tithes. The revenue from the lease of these lands was claimed by the Rev. John Strachan on behalf of the Church of England. These reserves were directly administered by the Crown; which, in turn, came under increasing political pressure from other Protestant bodies. The Reserve lands were to be a focal point of dissent within the Legislative Assembly.

The Clergy Corporation was incorporated in 1819 to manage the clergy reserves. After the Rev. John Strachan was appointed to the Executive Council, the advisory body to the Lieutenant Governor, in 1815, he began to push for the Church of England&#x27;s autonomous control of the clergy reserves on the model of the Clergy Corporation created in Lower Canada in 1817. Although all clergymen in the Church of England were members of the body corporate, the act prepared in 1819 by Strachan&#x27;s former student, Attorney General John Beverly Robinson, also appointed the Inspector General and the Surveyor General to the board, and made a quorum of three for meetings; these two public officers also sat on the Legislative Council with Strachan. These three were usually members of the Family Compact.

The clergy reserves were not the only types of landed endowment for the Anglican Church and clergy. The &quot;1791 Act&quot; also provided for glebe land to be assigned and vested in the Crown (for which were set aside), where the revenues would be remitted to the Church. The act also provided for the creation of parish rectories, giving parishes a corporate identity so that they could hold property (although none were created until 1836, prior to the recall of John Colborne, in which he created 24 of them). They were granted lands amounting to , of which were drawn from the clergy reserves and other glebe lots, while were taken from ordinary Crown lands. A later suit to have this action annulled was dismissed by the Court of Chancery of Upper Canada. The Province of Canada would later pass an Act in 1866 to authorize the disposal of such glebe and rectory lands not specifically used as churches, parsonages or burial grounds.

===Common school lands===

In 1797, lands in twelve townships (six east of York, and six west, totalling about , were set aside, from which revenues arising from their sale or lease were dedicated to support the establishment of grammar schools and a university for the Province. They were distributed as follows:


===Land sale system===

The land grant policy changed after 1825 as the Upper Canadian administration faced a financial crisis that would otherwise require raising local taxes, thereby making it more dependent on a local elected legislature. The Upper Canadian state ended its policy of granting land to &quot;unofficial&quot; settlers and implemented a broad plan of revenue-generating sales. The Crown replaced its old policy of land grants to ordinary settlers in newly opened districts with land sales by auction. It also passed legislation that allowed the auctioning of previously granted land for payment of back-taxes.

===Canada Company===


Few chose to lease the Crown reserves as long as free grants of land were still available. The Lieutenant Governor increasingly found himself depending upon the customs duties shared with, but collected in Lower Canada for revenue; after a dispute with the lower province on the relative proportions to be allocated to each, these duties were withheld, forcing the Lieutenant Governor to search for new sources of revenue. The Canada Company was created as a means of generating government revenue that was not under the control of the elected Assembly, thereby granting the Lt. Governor greater independence from local voters.

The plan for the Canada Company was promoted by the province&#x27;s Attorney General, John Beverly Robinson, then studying law at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in London. The Lt. Governor&#x27;s financial crisis led to a quick adoption of Robinson&#x27;s scheme to sell the Crown reserves to a new land company which would provide the provincial government with annual payments of between £15,000 to £20,000. The Canada Company was chartered in London in 1826; after three years of mismanagement by John Galt, the company hired William Allan and Thomas Mercer Jones to manage the company&#x27;s Upper Canadian business. Jones was to manage the &quot;Huron Tract,&quot; and Allan to sell the Crown reserves already surveyed in other districts.

According to the Canada Company, &quot;the poorest individual can here procure for himself and family a valuable tract; which, with a little labour, he can soon convert into a comfortable home, such as he could probably never attain in any other country – all his own!&quot; However, recent studies have suggested that a minimum of £100 to £200 plus the cost of land was required to start a new farm in the bush. As a result, few of these poor settlers had any hope of starting their own farm, although many tried.

====Huron Tract====

The Huron Tract lies in the counties of Huron, Perth, Middlesex and present-day Lambton County, Ontario, bordering on Lake Huron to the west and Lake Erie to the east. The tract was purchased by the Canada Company for resale to settlers. Influenced by William &quot;Tiger&quot; Dunlop, John Galt and other businessmen formed the Canada Company. The Canada Company was the administrative agent for the Huron Tract.

==Population==
===Ethnic groups===

Although the province is frequently referred to as &quot;English Canada&quot; after the Union of the Canadas, and its ethnic homogeneity said to be a factor in the Upper Canada Rebellion of 1837, there was range of ethnic groups in Upper Canada. However, due to the lack of a detailed breakdown, it is difficult to count each group, and this may be considered abuse of statistics. An idea of the ethnic breakdown can be had if one considers the religious census of 1842, which is helpfully provided below: Roman Catholics were 15% of the population, and adherents to this religion were, at the time, mainly drawn from the Irish and the French settlers. The Roman Catholic faith also numbered some votaries from amongst the Scottish settlers. The category of &quot;other&quot; religious adherents, somewhat under 5% of the population, included the Aboriginal and Metis culture.

====First Nations====
See above: Land Settlement

* Anishinaabe or Anishinabe—or more properly (plural) Anishinaabeg or Anishinabek. The plural form of the word is the autonym often used by the Odawa, Ojibwe, and Algonquin peoples.
* The Haudenosaunee, also known as the Iroquois or the &quot;People of the Longhouse&quot;,

====Métis====
Many British and French-Canadian fur traders married First Nations women from the Cree, Ojibwa, or Saulteaux First Nations. The majority of these fur traders were Scottish and French and were Catholic.

====Canadiens/French-Canadians====
Early settlements in the region include the Mission of Sainte-Marie among the Hurons at Midland in 1649, Sault Ste. Marie in 1668, and Fort Pontchartrain du Détroit in 1701. Southern Ontario was part of the &quot;Pays d&#x27;en-haut&quot; (Upper Country) of New France, and later part of the province of Quebec until Quebec was split into Upper and Lower Canada in 1791. The first wave of settlement in the Detroit/Windsor area came in the 18th century during the French regime. A second wave came in the 19th and early 20th centuries to the areas of Eastern Ontario and Northeastern Ontario. In the Ottawa Valley, in particular, some families have moved back and forth across the Ottawa River for generations (the river is the border between Ontario and Quebec). In the city of Ottawa some areas such as Vanier and Orleans have a rich Franco-heritage where families often have members on both sides of the Ottawa River.

====Loyalists/Later Loyalists====
After an initial group of about 7,000 United Empire Loyalists were thinly settled across the province in the mid-1780s, a far larger number of &quot;late-Loyalists&quot; arrived in the late 1790s and were required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown to obtain land if they came from the US. Their fundamental political allegiances were always considered dubious. By 1812, this had become acutely problematic since the American settlers outnumbered the original Loyalists by more than ten to one. Following the War of 1812, the colonial government under Lt. Governor Gore took active steps to prevent Americans from swearing allegiance, thereby making them ineligible to obtain land grants. The tensions between the Loyalists and late Loyalists erupted in the &quot;Alien Question&quot; crisis in 1820–21 when the Bidwells (Barnabas and his son Marshall) sought election to the provincial assembly. They faced opponents who claimed they could not hold elective office because of their American citizenship. If the Bidwells were aliens so were the majority of the province. The issue was not resolved until 1828 when the Colonial government retroactively granted them citizenship.

====Freed slaves====
The Act Against Slavery passed in Upper Canada on 9 July 1793. The 1793 &quot;Act against Slavery&quot; forbade the importation of any additional slaves and freed children. It did not grant freedom to adult slaves—they were finally freed by the British Parliament in 1833. As a consequence, many Canadian slaves fled south to New England and New York, where slavery was no longer legal. Many American slaves who had escaped from the South via the Underground Railroad or fleeing from the Black Codes in the Ohio Valley came north to Ontario, a good portion settling on land lots and began farming. It is estimated that thousands of escaped slaves entered Upper Canada from the United States.

====British====

The Great Migration from Britain from 1815 to 1850 has been numbered at 800,000. The population of Upper Canada in 1837 is documented at 409,000. Given the lack of detailed census data, it is difficult to assess the relative size of the American and Canadian born &quot;British&quot; and the foreign-born &quot;British.&quot; By the time of the first census in 1841, only half of the population of Upper Canada were foreign-born British.

=====Irish=====
=====Scottish=====
=====English=====
===Religion===

====Church of England====
The first Lt. Governor, Sir John Graves Simcoe, sought to make the Church of England the Established Church of the province. To that end, he created the clergy reserves, the revenues of which were to support the church. The clergy reserves proved to be a long-term political issue, as other denominations, particularly the Church of Scotland (Presbyterians) sought a proportional share of the revenues. The Church of England was never numerically dominant in the province, as it was in England, especially in the early years when most of the American born Later Loyalists arrived. The growth of the Church of England depended largely on later British emigration for growth.

The Church was led by the Rev. John Strachan (1778–1867), a pillar of the Family Compact. Strachan was part of the oligarchic ruling class of the province, and besides leading the Church of England, also sat on the Executive Council, the Legislative Council, helped found the Bank of Upper Canada, Upper Canada College, and the University of Toronto.

====Catholic Church====
Father Alexander Macdonell was a Scottish Catholic priest who formed his evicted clan into The Glengarry Fencibles regiment, of which he was chaplain. He was the first Catholic chaplain in the British Army since the Reformation. When the regiment was disbanded, Rev. Macdonell appealed to the government to grant its members a tract of land in Canada, and, in 1804, were provided in what is now Glengarry County, Canada.
In 1815, he began his service as the first Roman Catholic Bishop at St. Raphael&#x27;s Church in the Highlands of Ontario. In 1819, he was appointed Vicar Apostolic of Upper Canada, which in 1826 was erected into a suffragan bishopric of the Archdiocese of Quebec. In 1826, he was appointed to the legislative council.

Macdonell&#x27;s role on the Legislative Council was one of the tensions with the Toronto congregation, led by Father William O&#x27;Grady. O&#x27;Grady, like Macdonell, had been an army chaplain (to Connell James Baldwin&#x27;s soldiers in Brazil). O&#x27;Grady followed Baldwin to Toronto Gore Township in 1828. From January 1829 he was pastor of St. Paul&#x27;s church in York. Tensions between the Scottish and Irish came to a head when O&#x27;Grady was defrocked, in part for his activities in the Reform movement. He went on to edit a Reform newspaper in Toronto, the &quot;Canadian Correspondent&quot;.

====Ryerson and the Methodists====
The undisputed leader of the highly fractious Methodists in Upper Canada was Egerton Ryerson, editor of their newspaper, &quot;The Christian Guardian&quot;. Ryerson (1803–1882) was an itinerant minister – or circuit rider – in the Niagara area for the Methodist Episcopal Church – an American branch of Methodism. As British immigration increased, Methodism in Upper Canada was torn between those with ties to the Methodist Episcopal Church and the British Wesleyan Methodists. Ryerson used the &quot;Christian Guardian&quot; to argue for the rights of Methodists in the province and, later, to help convince rank-and-file Methodists that a merger with British Wesleyans (effected in 1833) was in their best interest.

====Presbyterians====
The earliest Presbyterian ministers in Upper Canada came from various denominations based in Scotland, Ireland, and the United States. The &quot;Presbytery of the Canadas&quot; was formed in 1818 primarily by Scottish Associate Presbyterian missionaries, yet independently of their mother denomination in the hope of including Presbyterian ministers of all stripes in Upper and Lower Canada. Although successfully including members from Irish Associate, and American Presbyterian and Reformed denominations, the growing group of missionaries belonging to the Church of Scotland remained separate. Instead, in 1831, they formed their own &quot;Synod of the Presbyterian Church of Canada in Connection with the Established Church of Scotland&quot;. That same year the &quot;Presbytery of the Canadas&quot;, having grown and been re-organized, became the &quot;United Synod of Upper Canada&quot;. In its continued pursuit for Presbyterian unity (and a share of government funding from the clergy reserves for established churches) the United Synod sought a union with the Church of Scotland synod which it finally joined in 1840. However, some ministers had left the United Synod prior to this merger (including, notably, Rev. James Harris, Rev. William Jenkins, and Rev. Daniel Eastman). In the 1832 new Secessionist missionaries began to arrive, belonging to &quot;The United Associate Synod in Scotland&quot; (after 1847, the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland). Committed to the voluntarist principle of rejecting government funding they decided against joining the &quot;United Synod of Upper Canada&quot; and on Christmas Day 1834 formed the &quot;Missionary Presbytery of the Canadas&quot;. Although this new presbytery was formed at Rev. James Harris&#x27;s church in Toronto, he and his congregation remained independent from it. However, the voluntarist, Rev. Jenkins and his congregation in Richmond Hill joined the Missionary Presbytery a few years later. Rev. Eastman had left the United Synod in 1833 to form the &quot;Niagara Presbytery&quot; of the Presbyterian Church in the USA. After this presbytery dissolved following the Rebellion of 1837, he rejoined the United Synod which then joined the Church of Scotland. Outside of these four Presbyterian denominations, only two others gained a foothold in the province. The small &quot;Stamford Presbytery&quot; of the American Secessionist tradition was formed in 1835 in the Niagara region, and the Scottish Reformed Presbyterian or &quot;Covenanter&quot; tradition was represented in the province to an even lesser extent. Despite the numerous denominations, by the late 1830s, the Church of Scotland was the main expression of Presbyterianism in Upper Canada.

====Mennonites, Tunkers, Quakers, and Children of Peace====
These groups of later Loyalists were proportionately larger in the early decades of the province&#x27;s settlement. The Mennonites, Tunkers, Quakers and Children of Peace are the traditional Peace churches. The Mennonites and Tunkers were generally German-speaking and immigrated as Later Loyalists from Pennsylvania. Many of their descendants continue to speak a form of German called Pennsylvania Dutch. The Quakers (Society of Friends) immigrated from New York, the New England States and Pennsylvania. The Children of Peace were founded during the War of 1812 after a schism in the Society of Friends in York County. A further schism occurred in 1828, leaving two branches, &quot;Orthodox&quot; Quakers and &quot;Hicksite&quot; Quakers.

===Poverty===

In the decade ending in 1837, the population of Upper Canada doubled, to 397,489, fed in large part by erratic spurts of displaced paupers, the &quot;surplus population&quot; of the British Isles. Historian Rainer Baehre estimated that between 1831 and 1835 a bare minimum of one-fifth of all emigrants to the province arrived totally destitute, forwarded by their parishes in the United Kingdom. The pauper immigrants arriving in Toronto were the excess agricultural workers and artisans whose growing ranks sent the cost of parish-based poor relief in England spiralling; a financial crisis that generated frenetic public debate and the overhaul of the Poor Laws in 1834. &quot;Assisted emigration&quot;, a second solution to the problem touted by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary in the Colonial Office, Robert Wilmot Horton, would remove them permanently from the parish poor rolls.

The roots of Wilmot-Horton&#x27;s &quot;assisted emigration&quot; policies began in April 1820, in the middle of an insurrection in Glasgow, where a young, already twice bankrupted William Lyon Mackenzie was setting sail for Canada on a ship called Psyche. After the week-long violence, the rebellion was easily crushed; the participants were driven less by treason than distress. In a city of 147,000 people without a regular parish system of poor relief, between ten and fifteen thousand were destitute. The Prime Minister agreed to provide free transportation from Quebec to Upper Canada, a land grant, and a year&#x27;s supply of provisions to any of the rebellious weavers who could pay their own way to Quebec. In all, in 1820 and 1821, a private charity helped 2,716 Lanarkshire and Glasgow emigrants to Upper Canada to take up their free grants, primarily in the Peterborough area. A second project was the Petworth Emigration Committee organised by the Reverend Thomas Sockett, who chartered ships and sent emigrants from England to Canada in each of the six years between 1832 and 1837. This area in the south of England was terrorised by the Captain Swing Riots, a series of clandestine attacks on large farmers who refused relief to unemployed agricultural workers. The area hardest hit – Kent – was the area where Sir Francis Bond Head, later Lt. Governor of Upper Canada in 1836, was the Assistant Poor Law Commissioner. One of his jobs was to force the unemployed into &quot;Houses of Industry.&quot;

==Trade, monetary policy, and financial institutions==

===Corporations===

There were two types of corporate actors at work in the Upper Canadian economy: the legislatively chartered companies and the unregulated joint-stock companies. The joint stock company was popular in building public works, since it should be for general public benefit, as the benefit would otherwise be sacrificed to legislated monopolies with exclusive privileges. or lie dormant. An example of the legislated monopoly is found in the Bank of Upper Canada. However, the benefit of the joint-stock shareholders, as the risk takers, was whole and entire; and the general public benefitted only indirectly. As late as 1849, even the moderate reform politician Robert Baldwin was to complain that &quot;unless a stop were made to it, there would be nothing but corporations from one end of the country to the other.&quot; Radical reformers, like William Lyon Mackenzie, who opposed all &quot;legislated monopolies,&quot; saw joint stock associations as the only protection against &quot;the whole property of the country... being tied up as an irredeemable appendage to incorporated institutions, and put beyond the reach of individual possession.&quot; As a result, most of the joint-stock companies formed in this period were created by political reformers who objected to the legislated monopolies granted to members of the Family Compact.

===Currency and banking===

====Currency====
The government of Upper Canada never issued a provincial currency. A variety of coins, mainly of French, Spanish, English and American origin circulated. The government used the Halifax standard, where one pound Halifax equalled four Spanish dollars. One pound sterling equalled £1 2s 2¾d (until 1820), and £1 2s 6½d Halifax pounds after 1820.

Paper currency was issued primarily by the Bank of Upper Canada, although with the diversification of the banking system, each bank would issue its own distinctive notes.

====Bank of Upper Canada====
The Bank of Upper Canada was &quot;captured&quot; from Kingston merchants by the York elite at the instigation of John Strachan in 1821, with the assistance of William Allan, a Toronto merchant and Executive Councillor. York was too small to warrant such an institution as indicated by the inability of its promoters to raise even the minimal 10% of the £200,000 authorised capital required for start-up. It succeeded where the Bank of Kingston had failed only because it had the political influence to have this minimum reduced by half, and because the provincial government subscribed for two thousand of its eight thousand shares. The administration appointed four of the bank&#x27;s fifteen directors that, as with the Clergy Corporation, made for a tight bond between the nominally private company and the state. Forty-four men served as bank directors during the 1830s; eleven of them were executive councillors, fifteen of them were legislative councillors, and thirteen were magistrates in Toronto. More importantly, all 11 men who had ever sat on the Executive Council also sat on the board of the Bank at one time or another. 10 of these men also sat on the Legislative Council. The overlapping membership on the boards of the Bank of Upper Canada and on the Executive and Legislative Councils served to integrate the economic and political activities of church, state, and the &quot;financial sector.&quot; These overlapping memberships reinforced the oligarchic nature of power in the colony and allowed the administration to operate without any effective elective check. The Bank of Upper Canada was a political sore point for the Reformers throughout the 1830s.

====Bank wars: the Scottish joint-stock banks====

The difference between the chartered banks and the joint-stock banks lay almost entirely on the issue of liability and its implications for the issuance of bank notes. The joint-stock banks lacked limited liability, hence every partner in the bank was responsible for the bank&#x27;s debts to the full extent of their personal property. The formation of new joint-stock banks blossomed in 1835 in the aftermath of a parliamentary report by Dr Charles Duncombe, which established their legality here. Duncombe&#x27;s report drew in large part on an increasingly dominant banking orthodoxy in the United Kingdom which challenged the English system of chartered banks. Duncombe&#x27;s Select Committee on Currency offered a template for the creation of joint-stock banks based on several successful British banks. Within weeks two Devonshire businessmen, Capt. George Truscott and John Cleveland Green, established the &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Bank&quot; in Toronto. The only other successful bank established under this law was &quot;The Bank of the People&quot; which was set up by Toronto&#x27;s Reformers. The Bank of the People provided the loan that allowed William Lyon Mackenzie to establish the newspaper The Constitution in 1836 in the lead up to the Rebellion of 1837. Mackenzie wrote at the time: &quot;Archdeacon Strachan&#x27;s bank (the old one) ... serve the double purpose of keeping the merchants in chains of debt and bonds to the bank manager, and the Farmer&#x27;s acres under the harrow of the storekeeper. You will be shewn how to break this degraded yoke of mortgages, ejectments, judgments and bonds. Money bound you – money shall loose you&quot;. During the financial panic of 1836, the Family Compact sought to protect its interests in the nearly bankrupt Bank of Upper Canada by making joint-stock banks illegal.

===Trade===
After the Napoleonic Wars, as industrial production in Britain took off, English manufacturers began dumping cheap goods in Montreal; this allowed an increasing number of shopkeepers in York to obtain their goods competitively from Montreal wholesalers. It was during this period that the three largest pre-war merchants who imported directly from Britain retired from business as a result; Quetton St. George in 1815, Alexander Wood in 1821, and William Allan in 1822. Toronto and Kingston then underwent a boom in the number of increasingly specialised shops and wholesalers. The Toronto wholesale firm of Isaac Buchanan and Company were one of the largest of the new wholesalers. Isaac Buchanan was a Scots merchant in Toronto, in partnership with his brother Peter, who remained in Glasgow to manage the British end of the firm. They established their business in Toronto in 1835, having bought out Isaac&#x27;s previous partners, William Guild and Co., who had established themselves in Toronto in 1832. As a wholesale firm, the Buchanan&#x27;s had invested more than £10,000 in their business.

Another of those new wholesale businesses was the Farmers&#x27; Storehouse Company. The Farmers Storehouse Company was formed in the Home District and is probably Canada&#x27;s first Farmers&#x27; Cooperative. The Storehouse expedited the sale of farmer&#x27;s wheat to Montreal, and provided them with cheaper consumer goods.

====Wheat and grains====

Upper Canada was in the unenviable position of having few exports with which to pay for all its imported manufactured needs. For the vast majority of those who settled in rural areas, debt could be paid off only through the sale of wheat and flour; yet, throughout much of the 1820s, the price of wheat went through periodic cycles of boom and bust depending upon the British markets that ultimately provided the credit upon which the farmer lived.
In the decade 1830–39, exports of wheat averaged less than £1 per person a year (less than £6 per household), and in the 1820s just half that.

Given the small amounts of saleable wheat and flour, and the rarity of cash, some have questioned how market oriented these early farmers were. Instead of depending on the market to meet their needs, many of these farmers depended on networks of shared resources and cooperative marketing. For example, rather than hire labour, they met their labour needs through &quot;work bees.&quot; such farmers are said to be &#x27;subsistence oriented&#x27; and not to respond to market cues; rather, they engage in a moral economy seeking &#x27;subsistence insurance&#x27; and a &#x27;just price&#x27;. The Children of Peace in the village of Hope (now Sharon) are a well documented example. They were the most prosperous agricultural community in Canada West by 1851.

====Timber====
The Ottawa River timber trade resulted from Napoleon&#x27;s 1806 Continental Blockade in Europe. The United Kingdom required a new source of timber for its navy and shipbuilding. Later the UK&#x27;s application of gradually increasing preferential tariffs increased Canadian imports. The trade in squared timber lasted until the 1850s. The transportation of raw timber by means of floating down the Ottawa River was proved possible in 1806 by Philemon Wright. Squared timber would be assembled into large rafts which held living quarters for men on their six-week journey to Quebec City, which had large exporting facilities and easy access to the Atlantic Ocean.

The timber trade was Upper and Lower Canada&#x27;s major industry in terms of employment and value of the product. The largest supplier of square red and white pine to the British market was the Ottawa River and the Ottawa Valley. They had &quot;rich red and white pine forests.&quot; Bytown (later called Ottawa), was a major lumber and sawmill centre of Canada.

==Transportation and communications==
===Canal system===

The early nineteenth century was the age of canals. The Erie Canal, stretching from Buffalo to Albany, New York, threatened to divert all of the grain and other trade on the upper Great Lakes through the Hudson River to New York city after its completion in 1825. Upper Canadians sought to build a similar system that would tie this trade to the St Lawrence River and Montreal.

====Rideau Canal====

The Rideau Canal&#x27;s purpose was military and hence was paid for by the British and not the local treasury. It was intended to provide a secure supply and communications route between Montreal and the British naval base in Kingston. The objective was to bypass the St. Lawrence River bordering New York; a route which would have left British supply ships vulnerable to an attack. Westward from Montreal, travel would proceed along the Ottawa River to Bytown (now Ottawa), then southwest via the canal to Kingston and out into Lake Ontario. Because the Rideau Canal was easier to navigate than the St. Lawrence River due to the series of rapids between Montreal and Kingston, it became a busy commercial artery from Montreal to the Great Lakes. The construction of the canal was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel John By of the Royal Engineers. The work started in 1826, and was completed 6 years later in 1832 at a cost of £822,000.

====Welland Canal====

The Welland Canal was created to directly link Lake Erie with Lake Ontario, bypassing Niagara Falls and the Erie Canal. It was the idea of William Hamilton Merritt who owned a sawmill, grist mill and store on the Twelve Mile Creek. The Legislature authorised the joint-stock Welland Canal Company on 19 January 1824, with a capitalisation of $150,000, and Merritt as the agent. The canal was officially opened exactly five years later on 30 November 1829. However, the original route to Lake Erie followed the Welland and Niagara Rivers and was difficult and slow to navigate. The Welland Canal Company obtained a loan of 50,000 pounds from the province of Upper Canada in March 1831 to cut a canal directly to Gravelly Bay (now Port Colborne) as the new Lake Erie terminus for the canal.

By the time the canal was finished in 1837, it had cost the province £425,000 in loans and stock subscriptions. The company was supposed to have been a private one using private capital; but the province had little private capital available, hence most of the original funds came from New York. To keep the canal in Upper Canadian hands, the province had passed a law barring Americans from the company&#x27;s directorate. The company was thus controlled by the Family Compact, even though they had few shares. By 1834, it was clear the canal would never make money and that the province would be on the hook for the large loans; the canal and the canal company thus became a political issue, as local farmers argued the huge expense would ultimately only benefit American farmers in the west and the merchants who transported their grain.

====Desjardins Canal====
The Desjardins Canal, named after its promoter Pierre Desjardins, was built to give Dundas, Ontario, easier access to Burlington Bay and Lake Ontario. Access to Lake Ontario from Dundas was made difficult by the topography of the area, which included a natural sand and gravel barrier, across Burlington Bay which allowed only boats with a shallow draft through. In 1823 a canal was dug through the sandbar. In 1826 the passage was completed, allowing schooners to sail to neighbouring Hamilton. Hamilton then became a major port and quickly expanded as a centre of trade and commerce. In 1826 a group of Dundas businessmen incorporated to compete with Hamilton and increase the value of their real estate holdings. The project to build Desjardins Canal continued for ten years, from 1827 to 1837, and required constant infusions of money from the province. In 1837, the year it opened, the company&#x27;s income was £6,000, of which £5,000 was from a government loan and £166 was received from canal tolls.

===Lake traffic: steamships===
There is disagreement as to whether the Canadian-built (), launched on 7 September 1816, at Ernestown, Ontario or the US-built &quot;Ontario&quot; (), launched in the spring of 1817 at Sacketts Harbor, New York, was the first steamboat on the Great Lakes. While &quot;Frontenac&quot; was launched first, &quot;Ontario&quot; began active service first. The first steamboat on the upper Great Lakes was the passenger-carrying &quot;Walk-In-The-Water&quot;, built in 1818 to navigate Lake Erie.

In the years between 1809 and 1837 just over 100 steamboats were launched by Upper and Lower Canadians for the St. Lawrence River and Great Lakes trade, of which ten operated on Lake Ontario. The single largest engine foundry in British North America before 1838 was the Eagle Foundry of Montreal, founded by John Dod Ward in the fall of 1819 which manufactured 33 of the steam engines. The largest Upper Canadian engine manufacturer was Sheldon &amp; Dutcher of Toronto, who made three engines in the 1830s before being driven to Bankruptcy by the Bank of Upper Canada in 1837.

The major owner-operators of steamships on Lake Ontario were Donald Bethune, John Hamilton, Hugh Richardson, and Henry Gildersleeve, each of whom would have invested a substantial fortune.

===Roads===

Besides marine travel, Upper Canada had a few Post roads or footpaths used for transportation by horse or stagecoaches along the key settlements between London to Kingston.

The Governor&#x27;s Road was built beginning in 1793 from Dundas to Paris and then to the proposed capital of London by 1794. The road was further extended eastward with new capital of York in 1795. his road was eventually known as Dundas Road.

A second route was known as Lakeshore Road or York Road which was built from York to Trent River from 1799 to 1900 and later extended eastwards to Kingston in 1817. This road was later renamed as Kingston Road.

==United States relations==

===War of 1812 (1812–1815)===

During the War of 1812 with the United States, Upper Canada was the chief target of the Americans, since it was weakly defended and populated largely by American immigrants. However, division in the United States over the war, a lackluster American militia, the incompetence of American military commanders, and swift and decisive action by the British commander, Sir Isaac Brock, kept Upper Canada part of British North America.

Detroit was captured by the British on 6 August 1812. The Michigan Territory was held under British control until it was abandoned in 1813. The Americans won the decisive Battle of Lake Erie (10 September 1813) and forced the British to retreat from the western areas. On the retreat they were intercepted at the Battle of the Thames (5 October 1813) and destroyed in a major American victory that killed Tecumseh and broke the power of Britain&#x27;s Indian allies.

Major battles fought on territory in Upper Canada included:

*Battle of Queenston Heights, 13 October 1812
*Burning and Battle of York, 27 April 1813
*Battle of Fort George, 27 May 1813
*Battle of Stoney Creek, 5 June 1813
*Battle of Beaver Dams, 24 June 1813
*Battle of Lake Erie, 10 September 1813
*Battle of the Thames, 5 October 1813
*Battle of Crysler&#x27;s Farm, 11 November 1813
*Burning of Newark, 10 December 1813
*Battle of Chippawa, 5 July 1814
*Battle of Lundy&#x27;s Lane, 25 July 1814

Many other battles were fought in American territory bordering Upper Canada, including the Northwest Territory (most in modern-day Michigan), upstate New York and naval battles in the Great Lakes.

The Treaty of Ghent (ratified in 1815) ended the war and restored the status quo ante bellum.

===1837 Rebellion and Patriot War===
Mackenzie, Duncombe, John Rolph and 200 supporters fled to Navy Island in the Niagara River, where they declared themselves the Republic of Canada on 13 December. They obtained supplies from supporters in the United States, resulting in British reprisals (see Caroline affair). This incident has been used to establish the principle of &quot;anticipatory self-defense&quot; in international politics, which holds that it may be justified only in cases in which the &quot;necessity of that self-defense is instant, overwhelming, and leaving no choice of means, and no moment for deliberation&quot;. This formulation is part of the &quot;Caroline&quot; test. The &quot;Caroline&quot; affair is also now invoked frequently in the course of the dispute around preemptive strike (or preemption doctrine).

On 13 January 1838, under attack by British armaments, the rebels fled. Mackenzie went to the United States where he was arrested and charged under the Neutrality Act. The Neutrality Act of 1794 made it illegal for an American to wage war against any country at peace with the United States. Application of the Neutrality Act during the Patriot War led to the largest use of US government military force against its own citizens since the Whiskey Rebellion.

The extended series of incidents comprising the Patriot War were finally settled by US Secretary of State Daniel Webster and Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton, in the course of their negotiations leading to the Webster–Ashburton Treaty of 1842.

==Education==

In 1807, the Grammar School Act allowed the government to take over various grammar schools across the province and incorporating them into a network of eight new, public grammar schools (secondary schools), one for each of the eight districts (Eastern, Johnstown, Midland, Newcastle, Home, Niagara, London, and Western):

* Eastern Grammar School in New Johnstown or current day Cornwall, Ontario – founded as Cornwall Grammar School and later became Cornwall Collegiate and Vocational School.
* Johnstown District Grammar School, Maitland, Ontario
* Midland Grammar School – created to replace Kingston Grammar School established in 1792 and later became Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute
* Newcastle District Grammar School, Coburg
* Home District Grammar School in York, Upper Canada, later becoming Royal Grammar School, Toronto High School and finally to the current name Jarvis Collegiate Institute.
* St. Catherine&#x27;s and District Grammar School (Niagara District)
* London District Grammar School latter became London Central Secondary School
* Western District Grammar School in Sandwich or current day Windsor, Ontario – grammar school is gone and is now the site of General Brock Public School.

==Canada West==
Canada West was the western portion of the United Province of Canada from 10 February 1841, to 1 July 1867. Its boundaries were identical to those of the former province of Upper Canada. Lower Canada would also become Canada East.

The area was named the province of Ontario under the &quot;British North America Act&quot; of 1867.

<doc id="40394" wikidata="Q1283101" url="?curid=40394" title="Design Patterns">
<text>Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software (1994) is a software engineering book describing software design patterns. The book was written by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides, with a foreword by Grady Booch. The book is divided into two parts, with the first two chapters exploring the capabilities and pitfalls of object-oriented programming, and the remaining chapters describing 23 classic software design patterns. The book includes examples in C++ and Smalltalk.

It has been influential to the field of software engineering and is regarded as an important source for object-oriented design theory and practice. More than 500,000 copies have been sold in English and in 13 other languages. The authors are often referred to as the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; (GoF).

The book started at a birds-of-a-feather session at the 1990 OOPSLA meeting, &quot;Towards an Architecture Handbook&quot;, where Erich Gamma and Richard Helm met and discovered their common interest. They were later joined by Ralph Johnson and John Vlissides. The book was originally published on 21 October 1994, with a 1995 copyright, and was made available to the public at the 1994 OOPSLA meeting.

==Introduction==
Chapter 1 is a discussion of object-oriented design techniques, based on the authors&#x27; experience, which they believe would lead to good object-oriented software design, including:
* &quot;Program to an interface, not an implementation.&quot; (Gang of Four 1995:18)
* Composition over inheritance: &quot;Favor &#x27;object composition&#x27; over &#x27;class inheritance&#x27;.&quot; (Gang of Four 1995:20)

The authors claim the following as advantages of interfaces over implementation:
* clients remain unaware of the specific types of objects they use, as long as the object adheres to the interface
* clients remain unaware of the classes that implement these objects; clients only know about the abstract class(es) defining the interface

Use of an interface also leads to dynamic binding and polymorphism, which are central features of object-oriented programming.

The authors refer to inheritance as &quot;white-box reuse&quot;, with white-box referring to visibility, because the internals of parent classes are often visible to subclasses. In contrast, the authors refer to object composition (in which objects with well-defined interfaces are used dynamically at runtime by objects obtaining references to other objects) as &quot;black-box reuse&quot; because no internal details of composed objects need be visible in the code using them.

The authors discuss the tension between inheritance and encapsulation at length and state that in their experience, designers overuse inheritance (Gang of Four 1995:20). The danger is stated as follows:

:&quot;Because inheritance exposes a subclass to details of its parent&#x27;s implementation, it&#x27;s often said that &#x27;inheritance breaks encapsulation&#x27;&quot;. (Gang of Four 1995:19)

They warn that the implementation of a subclass can become so bound up with the implementation of its parent class that any change in the parent&#x27;s implementation will force the subclass to change. Furthermore, they claim that a way to avoid this is to inherit only from abstract classes—but then, they point out that there is minimal code reuse.

Using inheritance is recommended mainly when adding to the functionality of existing components, reusing most of the old code and adding relatively small amounts of new code.

To the authors, &#x27;delegation&#x27; is an extreme form of object composition that can always be used to replace inheritance. Delegation involves two objects: a &#x27;sender&#x27; passes itself to a &#x27;delegate&#x27; to let the delegate refer to the sender. Thus the link between two parts of a system are established only at runtime, not at compile-time. The Callback article has more information about delegation.

The authors also discuss so-called parameterized types, which are also known as generics (Ada, Eiffel, Java, C#, Visual Basic (.NET), and Delphi) or templates (C++). These allow any type to be defined without specifying all the other types it uses—the unspecified types are supplied as &#x27;parameters&#x27; at the point of use.

The authors admit that delegation and parameterization are very powerful but add a warning:

:&quot;Dynamic, highly parameterized software is harder to understand and build than more static software.&quot; (Gang of Four 1995:21)

The authors further distinguish between &#x27;Aggregation&#x27;, where one object &#x27;has&#x27; or &#x27;is part of&#x27; another object (implying that an aggregate object and its owner have identical lifetimes) and acquaintance, where one object merely &#x27;knows of&#x27; another object. Sometimes acquaintance is called &#x27;association&#x27; or the &#x27;using&#x27; relationship. Acquaintance objects may request operations of each other, but they are not responsible for each other. Acquaintance is a weaker relationship than aggregation and suggests much looser coupling between objects, which can often be desirable for maximum maintainability in designs.

The authors employ the term &#x27;toolkit&#x27; where others might today use &#x27;class library&#x27;, as in C# or Java. In their parlance, toolkits are the object-oriented equivalent of subroutine libraries, whereas a &#x27;framework&#x27; is a set of cooperating classes that make up a reusable design for a specific class of software. They state that applications are hard to design, toolkits are harder, and frameworks are the hardest to design.

== Patterns by type ==

===Creational===

Creational patterns are ones that create objects, rather than having to instantiate objects directly. This gives the program more flexibility in deciding which objects need to be created for a given case.
* Abstract factory groups object factories that have a common theme.
* Builder constructs complex objects by separating construction and representation.
* Factory method creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
* Prototype creates objects by cloning an existing object.
* Singleton restricts object creation for a class to only one instance.

===Structural===
Structural patterns concern class and object composition. They use inheritance to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects to obtain new functionality.
* Adapter allows classes with incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping its own interface around that of an already existing class.
* Bridge decouples an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.
* Composite composes zero-or-more similar objects so that they can be manipulated as one object.
* Decorator dynamically adds/overrides behavior in an existing method of an object.
* Facade provides a simplified interface to a large body of code.
* Flyweight reduces the cost of creating and manipulating a large number of similar objects.
* Proxy provides a placeholder for another object to control access, reduce cost, and reduce complexity.

===Behavioral===
Most behavioral design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between objects.
* Chain of responsibility delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
* Command creates objects that encapsulate actions and parameters.
* Interpreter implements a specialized language.
* Iterator accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
* Mediator allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
* Memento provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (undo).
* Observer is a publish/subscribe pattern, which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
* State allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
* Strategy allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at runtime.
* Template method defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its subclasses to provide concrete behavior.
* Visitor separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.

==Reception==
In 2005 the ACM SIGPLAN awarded that year&#x27;s Programming Languages Achievement Award to the authors, in recognition of the impact of their work &quot;on programming practice and programming language design&quot;.

Criticism has been directed at the concept of software design patterns generally, and at &quot;Design Patterns&quot; specifically. A primary criticism of &quot;Design Patterns&quot; is that its patterns are simply workarounds for missing features in C++, replacing elegant abstract features with lengthy concrete patterns, essentially becoming a &quot;human compiler&quot;. Paul Graham wrote:
Peter Norvig demonstrates that 16 out of the 23 patterns in &quot;Design Patterns&quot; are simplified or eliminated by language features in Lisp or Dylan. Related observations were made by Hannemann and Kiczales who implemented several of the 23 design patterns using an aspect-oriented programming language (AspectJ) and showed that code-level dependencies were removed from the implementations of 17 of the 23 design patterns and that aspect-oriented programming could simplify the implementations of design patterns.

In an interview with InformIT in 2009, Erich Gamma stated that the book authors had a discussion in 2005 on how they would have refactored the book and concluded that they would have recategorized some patterns and added a few additional ones, such as extension object/interface, dependency injection, type object, and null object. Gamma wanted to remove the singleton pattern, but there was no consensus among the authors to do so.

<text>The &quot;Montana&quot;-class was a planned class of battleship for the United States Navy, intended as the successor to the . They were to be slower but larger, better armored, and with superior firepower. Five were approved for construction during World War II, but changes in wartime building priorities resulted in their cancellation in favor of continuing production of s and &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships before any &quot;Montana&quot;-class keels were laid.

Their intended armament would have been twelve Mark 7 guns in four 3-gun turrets, up from the nine Mark 7 guns in three turrets used by the &quot;Iowa&quot; class. Unlike the three preceding classes of battleships, the &quot;Montana&quot; class was designed without any restrictions from treaty limitations. With increased anti-aircraft capability and substantially thicker armor in all areas, the &quot;Montana&quot;s would have been the largest, best-protected, and most heavily armed US battleships ever, and the only ones to rival the Empire of Japan&#x27;s s in terms of displacement.

Preliminary design work for the &quot;Montana&quot; class began before the US entry into World War II. The first two vessels were approved by Congress in 1939 following the passage of the Naval Act of 1938. The Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor delayed the construction of the &quot;Montana&quot;-class. The success of carrier combat at the Battle of the Coral Sea and, to a greater extent, the Battle of Midway, diminished the perceived value of the battleship. Consequently, the US Navy chose to cancel the &quot;Montana&quot;-class in favor of more urgently needed aircraft carriers as well as amphibious and anti-submarine vessels.

Because the &quot;Iowa&quot;s were far enough along in construction and urgently needed to operate alongside the new &quot;Essex&quot;-class aircraft carriers, their orders were retained, making them completed the last US Navy battleships to be commissioned.

== Background ==
During the interwar period, the US Navy was primarily concerned with its rival in the Pacific Ocean, the Imperial Japanese Navy. The international naval arms limitation system initiated by the Washington Naval Treaty in 1922 had accorded the US Navy superiority over Japan in terms of total tonnage. After the ten-year construction moratorium that had been imposed by the Washington Treaty expired, the US Navy began building the fast battleships in 1937 to replace old pre-World War I ships that were by then obsolescent. But by the late 1930s, the Washington system, which had been extended by the First and Second London Naval Treaties, had begun to break down after Japan refused to sign the Second London Treaty in 1936. This prompted the other major naval powers to begin rearmament programs, beginning in the United States with the battleships in 1938. Funding for the first two new ships was provided in Fiscal Year 1937, though work would not commence until 1939.

The Second Vinson Act of 1938 added two more &quot;South Dakota&quot;s; it also authorized the construction of two more battleships yet to be designed. The US Navy had already begun design work on the successors to the &quot;South Dakota&quot;s in 1937, which was to become the ; the Navy sought larger, faster ships that would handily exceed the limit on battleship displacement imposed under the Washington Treaty system. Because Japan had already refused to abide by the terms of the Second London Naval Treaty, the other major naval powers moved to loosen the restrictions on their own new battleship designs. On 31 March 1938, the US, Britain, and France exchanged notes indicating that they would accept increasing the displacement limit to .

As the US Navy&#x27;s designers worked on proposals for the new ships, two distinct strains emerged: a comparatively slow, heavily armed and armored variant and a much faster, but lighter-armed and armored vessel that was primarily intended to catch Japanese cruisers and counter the fast s. The latter type, which eventually emerged essentially as an improved &quot;South Dakota&quot;, was capable of a speed of , but work on the former proceeded at the same time. The General Board intended it to become the next generation of standard-type battleships, which was to be set at 45,000-ton ships armed with twelve guns, and capable of , the same speed as the &quot;South Dakota&quot;s.

By 1939, it had become apparent to the naval leadership that war was approaching, and so the need for new ships had become pressing. The start of World War II in Europe, and particularly the Fall of France in June 1940 only increased the pressure to speed construction of new warships. The first two ships ordered to the 33-knot improved &quot;South Dakota&quot; design— and —were ordered under the 1939 fiscal year. The passage of the Two-Ocean Navy Act on 19 July 1940 provided significant increases to the Navy&#x27;s strength, including an increase of some for battleships alone, along with hundreds of thousands of tons for new aircraft carriers, cruisers, and destroyers. Under the 1941 fiscal year program, the third and fourth &quot;Iowa&quot;-class battleships were authorized, but in May, two more ships were added to the program. These were to have been built to the next battleship design, but the Secretary of the Navy, Frank Knox, decided that these should be additional &quot;Iowa&quot;-class ships to speed up production.

== Design ==
===Initial design work===
Though the 33-knot design had been chosen for &quot;Iowa&quot;, it was clear to naval leadership that these would be exceptions to normal Navy doctrine, and that a reversion to the 27-knot standard-type battleship would occur with the next design. The primary consideration for this new class was the development of the super-heavy armor-piercing shell that had been developed during the construction of the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class. Standard design practice stated that battleships should be immune to guns of their own calibers at expected battle ranges, but the new super-heavy shell had significantly better penetrating power than older, lighter shells. None of the existing designs, from &quot;North Carolina&quot; to &quot;Iowa&quot;, were proof against the 2,700-pound shell, and the General Board wanted the next design to be better protected. They requested proposals from the Bureau of Construction and Repair (C&amp;R) that conformed to the 45,000-ton limit, armed with twelve 16-inch guns, and capable of 27-knots.

C&amp;R initially responded with a design labeled &quot;BB 65A&quot;, which used &quot;South Dakota&quot; as a baseline, but increased the length to accommodate the fourth main battery turret. Displacement was already over the limit at , and the ship was only protected against the earlier AP shell. The design staff estimated that more than would be needed to protect the ship against the heavier shells. A second variant, &quot;BB 65B&quot; substituted twelve new /47 guns in place of the existing twenty /38 cal guns for their secondary batteries, but this increased displacement even further. Another pair of designs, &quot;BB 65C&quot; and &quot;65D&quot;, adopted three quadruple main battery turrets instead of four triple turrets, which accounted for some of weight savings. This latter pair mirrored the first set in the use of 5-inch and 6-inch secondaries. All of these designs were only protected against the 2,250 lb shell, but since &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; were below the displacement limit, C&amp;R attempted to use the free weight to strengthen their armor with design &quot;BB 65E&quot;. They realized that though the deck could be improved to provide a relatively narrow zone of immunity against plunging fire, strengthening the belt armor to protect against the heavier shell would increase displacement to as much as .

None of the initial proposals was deemed acceptable, and there were concerns about the feasibility of the quadruple turrets. Other guns were suggested, ranging from guns to experimental 16-inch/56 caliber guns. C&amp;R provided another series of studies beginning with &quot;65F&quot;. Several of these proposals experimented with mixed quadruple, triple, and double turrets for either ten or eleven guns to save weight but still increase firepower over the nine-gun &quot;South Dakota&quot;s. One proposal, &quot;65J&quot;, suggested adopting a twelve-gun ship that would be well-protected against the 2,700 lb AP shell. The 18-inch gun was ruled out after a design study demonstrated that only six of the guns could be mounted within the 45,000-ton displacement limit. By September 1939, one of the ten-gun variants had been selected, which carried two triple-turrets forward and a quadruple turret aft.

===Wartime designs===
The outbreak of World War II in September 1939 radically altered the constraints imposed on C&amp;R. The remaining limits imposed by the Washington and London treaties were now removed entirely; the new ship would only be limited by logistical restrictions of existing naval infrastructure, most significantly the Panama Canal and available dry docks. The Navy had been pushing for a third, wider set of locks for the Panama Canal since 1938, which was approved in 1940. Nevertheless, some limitations still existed; the length and height of the BB65 designs had to take into account one of the shipyards at which they were to be built: the New York Navy Yard slipways could not handle the construction of a ship more than , and vessels built there had to be low enough to clear the Brooklyn Bridge at low tide. Consequently, the yard&#x27;s number 4 dry dock had to be enlarged and the ships would be floated out rather than conventionally launched. In October, the General Board asked for new twelve-gun designs that were sufficiently armored, which was estimated could be accomplished on a displacement of around . The Preliminary Design department at C&amp;R responded with a design in mid-January 1940 that largely met the General Board&#x27;s requirements, but displacement was set at . An option to replace the standard 5-inch/38 secondaries with longer-barrel 5-inch/54 guns would add about to the ships.

During a meeting on 16 February 1940, the Board requested a new series of proposals. These included a modified version of the nine-gun &quot;Iowa&quot; design that was two knots slower but better protected, an enlarged &quot;Iowa&quot; variant that maintained the 33-knot speed but displaced , and several twelve-gun designs that had speeds ranging from 28 to 33 knots. These were given designations from &quot;BB 65-1&quot; to &quot;BB 65-8&quot;. Displacement on these proposals increased to as much as . All of these designs were armed with the 16-inch/50 gun, and were well protected against the super-heavy shell. During discussions in March, the decision was made to revert to externally applied belt armor, since the internal armor belts of the &quot;South Dakota&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot; classes were more difficult to install and repair in the event of battle damage, and the weight savings associated with them no longer mattered now that displacement limits were gone. Two additional designs were produced in June: 65-9 and 65-10, which were 28-knot ships.

By July, Navy&#x27;s senior leadership still could not agree on design priorities, and disagreed sharply on points ranging from top speed to the cost and logistical challenges of the larger designs. The Board requested another round of design studies from Preliminary Design, which responded with nine-, ten-, and twelve-gun ships that, again, included slow and fast variants. The Board finally selected one of the designs, &quot;BB 65-5A&quot;, which was armed with twelve guns on a displacement of , and capable of 28 knots. The Board submitted the design to Knox, which he approved on 19 August. The ships were not actually authorized at that point, and design work continued. Because the battleships that would have received the BB-65 and BB-66 hull numbers had been assigned to the &quot;Iowa&quot; class, the next design was labeled &quot;BB 67-1&quot;. This design shortened the hull to at the waterline, likely to keep the length within the limits of the new slipways being built at the Norfolk Navy Yard and the Philadelphia Navy Yard. This variant displacement increased to . Further iterative improvements of the armor layout produced &quot;BB 67-2&quot;, which had a slightly reduced displacement of . This version incorporated an internal lower belt that provided additional protection against underwater shell hits.

Detail work on the design continued well into 1941, which included replacing the original battery of light anti-aircraft guns, which were to be the ineffective guns with Bofors guns. The searchlights were rearranged, the navigational rangefinders were removed, and the waterline hull length was increased slightly to . Displacement was increased slightly, to , while the designers discovered that the propulsion system could be reduced in power, from , which allowed smaller and lighter propulsion machinery. These changes provided further savings in weight that allowed the bomb deck to be extended further aft, and improvements to the light anti-aircraft battery. Protection of the propulsion shafts also changed from an extension of the belt and main armored deck aft of the citadel to armored tubes around the shafts, with the steering gears becoming its own armored compartment. This design was immune to the super-heavy shells when fired at ranges between ; their resistance to standard 16-inch AP shells extended to . The final version of the design, dated March 1941, was designated &quot;BB 67-4&quot;.

==Construction and cancellation==
The General Board planned to build four ships to the new design, which would have constituted a single battleship division, but five were authorized by the Two-Ocean Navy Act on 19 July 1940. Work was intended to begin later that year, but shortages of the necessary steel caused delays. Work on the new locks for the Panama Canal was also halted in 1941, also owing to a shortage of steel due to the changing strategic and material priorities. The final contract design was issued in June 1942. Construction was authorized by the United States Congress and the projected date of completion was estimated to be somewhere between 1 July and 1 November 1945.

In October 1942, work on the ships was again delayed by the order of some eighty destroyers, which were badly needed for the Battle of the Atlantic against German U-boats that were raiding the supply convoys to Britain. Additional work on the design continued into 1942, including detail work on the anti-aircraft batteries to be carried. The Bureau of Ships suggested the armor decks could be increased in thickness, but these changes were not pursued. All five ships were ultimately cancelled on 21 July 1943, as production priorities had shifted decisively toward aircraft carriers, destroyers, and submarines. The time spent refining the &quot;Montana&quot; design was not entirely a waste, as the arrangement of the propulsion system was modified for the s.

==Specifications==
=== General characteristics ===
As authorized, the &quot;Montana&quot;-class ships (design &quot;BB 67-4&quot;) would have been long at the waterline and long overall. At the waterline, their beam was to have been , but their maximum beam increased to . The ships were to have had a standard displacement of , with a designed trials displacement of . Full load displacement increased to , and emergency load grew further to . At their standard displacement, the ships would have had a draft of , while at emergency load, the draft increased to . The ships would have had a metacentric height of . Their projected crew was to have amounted to 115 officers and 2,240 enlisted men; this grew to 189 officers and 2,789 enlisted men while serving as a flagship.

The &quot;Montana&quot; design shares many characteristics with the previous classes of American fast battleships starting from the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class, such as a bulbous bow, a triple bottom under the armored citadel, and twin skegs in which the inner shafts were housed. The &quot;Montana&quot;s″ overall construction would have made extensive use of welding for joining structural plates and homogeneous armor, which saved weight compared to traditional riveting. Like all of the US interwar designs, the &quot;Montana&quot;s would have had a flush main deck that was steeply flared at the bow to reduce the amount of water taken on in heavy seas. The &quot;Montana&quot; class would have carried three aircraft for reconnaissance and gunnery spotting. They would have been operated from catapults on the ship&#x27;s fantail, as was standard for US battleship designs of the period.

===Propulsion===
The propulsion plant of the &quot;Montana&quot;s would have consisted of eight oil-fired Babcock &amp; Wilcox two-drum boilers with a steam pressure of and a steam temperature of . The boilers supplied steam to four geared steam turbines, each driving one screw propeller. The boilers were vented through a pair of funnels placed on the centerline amidships. To meet the high electrical loads anticipated for the ships, the design was to have ten 1,250 kW ship service turbogenerators (SSTG), providing a total of 12,500 kW of non-emergency electrical power at 450 volts alternating current. The ships were also to be equipped with two 500 kW emergency diesel generators.

The turbines were rated to produce each, for a total propulsive power of . The propulsion system was intended to produce a design speed of 28 knots at 70,500 tons displacement. The &quot;Montana&quot;s were designed to carry of fuel oil and had a nominal range of at . Two semi-balanced rudders were placed behind the two inboard screws. The inboard shafts were housed in skegs, which, while increasing hydrodynamic drag, substantially strengthened the stern structure.

While less powerful than the powerplant used by the &quot;Iowa&quot;s, the &quot;Montana&quot;″s plant enabled the machinery spaces to be considerably more subdivided, with extensive longitudinal and traverse subdivisions of the boiler and engine rooms. The machinery arrangement was reminiscent of that of the , with the boiler rooms flanking the two central turbine rooms for the inboard shafts, while the turbine rooms for the wing shafts were placed at the after end of the machinery spaces. &quot;Montana&quot;″s machinery arrangement combined with increased power would eventually be used on the &quot;Midway&quot; class.

=== Armament ===
The primary armament of a &quot;Montana&quot;-class battleship would have been twelve /50 caliber Mark 7 guns, which were to be mounted in four three-gun turrets. The turrets were placed in two superfiring pairs, one forward and one aft. The guns fired two types of shells: a armor-piercing shells and high capacity (HC) shells that carried a larger high-explosive bursting charge. The shells had muzzle velocities of and , respectively. Firing AP shells at the maximum elevation of 45 degrees, the guns could reach targets out to , while the lighter HC shells had a slightly reduced range of . The shells had a flight time in excess of eighty seconds at those distances. At a realistic engagement distance of , the AP shells could penetrate of steel armor. The guns had a rate of fire of two shots per minute, and had a rate of train of four degrees per second. They had to be returned to 5 degrees elevation for reloading.

The secondary armament for the &quot;Montana&quot;-class ships was to be twenty /54 cal Mark 16 dual-purpose guns housed in ten two-gun turrets along the superstructure. These guns, designed for the &quot;Montana&quot; class, were intended to improve the effective range over the shorter-barreled Mark 12 guns then in service. They fired a projectile at a muzzle velocity of and had a maximum range of against surface targets and a maximum ceiling of against aerial targets. The guns had a rate of fire of fifteen shots per minute.

Each ship would have carried a light anti-aircraft armament of thirty-two Bofors guns and twenty Oerlikon guns. The Bofors guns were to be carried in eight quadruple mounts, while the Oerlikons were to have been mounted individually, although the number of Bofors and Oerlikon mounts would likely have increased considerably had the ships been built. The Bofors guns fired shells at a velocity of , and they had a maximum ceiling of . The Oerlikon guns were supplied with shells, which they fired with a muzzle velocity of .

=== Armor ===
As designed, the &quot;Montana&quot;s used the &quot;all or nothing&quot; armor philosophy, with most of the armor concentrated on the citadel that includes the machinery spaces, armament, magazines, and command and control facilities. The belt armor would be Class A face-hardened Krupp cemented (K.C.) armor mounted on Special Treatment Steel (STS), inclined at 19 degrees. Below the waterline, the belt tapered to . To protect against potential underwater shell hits, the ships would have a separate Class B homogeneous Krupp-type armor lower belt, by the magazines and by the machinery, that would also have served as one of the torpedo bulkheads, inclined at 10 degrees; this lower belt would taper to 1 inch at the triple bottom and be mounted on STS. The ends of the armored citadel would be closed by Class A traverse bulkheads thick in the front and in the aft.

The deck armor would be in three layers: the first consisting of STS laminated on STS for a total of STS weather deck, the second consisting of Class B laminated on STS for a total of , and a third splinter deck. Over the magazines, the splinter deck would be replaced by a STS third deck to protect from spalling. Total armor thickness on the centerline would therefore have been 9.925 in (252 mm) over the citadel and 10.3 in (262 mm) thick over the magazines. The outboard section would have had Class B laminated on STS for a total of second deck and a splinter deck. The total thickness for the outboard section of the deck would have been 8.1 in (206 mm).

The main batteries were designed to have very heavy protection, with turret faces having Class B mounted on STS, resulting in thick laminated plate. The turret sides were to have up to Class A and turret roofs would have Class B. The barbettes would have been protected by up to Class A forward and aft, while the conning tower sides would have Class A.

&quot;Montana&quot;″s torpedo protection system design incorporated lessons learned from those of previous US fast battleships, and was to consist of four internal longitudinal torpedo bulkheads behind the outer hull shell plating that would form a multi-layered &quot;bulge&quot;. Two of the compartments would be liquid loaded in order to disrupt the gas bubble of a torpedo warhead detonation while the bulkheads would elastically deform and absorb the energy. Due to the external armor belt, the geometry of the &quot;bulge&quot; was more similar to that of the &quot;North Carolina&quot; class rather than that of the &quot;South Dakota&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot; classes. The design of the &quot;Montana&quot;″s torpedo defense system addressed a potential vulnerability of the &quot;South Dakota&quot;-type system, where caisson tests in 1939 showed that extending the main armor belt that tapers to the keel to act as one of the torpedo bulkheads had detrimental flooding effects due to the belt&#x27;s rigidity. &quot;South Dakota&quot;″s and &quot;Iowa&quot;″s systems were modified in light of these tests, and &quot;Iowa&quot;″s system was also further reinforced. Like on the &quot;South Dakota&quot; and &quot;Iowa&quot; classes, the two outer compartments would be liquid loaded, while two inner ones be void with the lower Class B armor belt to form the holding bulkhead between them. The greater beam of the &quot;Montana&quot;s would allow a higher system depth of compared to of the &quot;North Carolina&quot;s.
