<text>Ichthyology is the branch of zoology devoted to the study of fish, including bony fish (Osteichthyes), cartilaginous fish (Chondrichthyes), and jawless fish (Agnatha). According to FishBase, 33,400 species of fish had been described as of October 2016, with approximately 250 new species described each year.

==Etymology==
The word is derived from the Greek words , &quot;ikhthus&quot;, meaning &quot;fish&quot;; and , &quot;logia&quot;, meaning &quot;to study&quot;.

==History==
The study of fish dates from the Upper Paleolithic Revolution (with the advent of &quot;high culture&quot;). The science of ichthyology was developed in several interconnecting epochs, each with various significant advancements.

The study of fish receives its origins from humans&#x27; desire to feed, clothe, and equip themselves with useful implements. According to Michael Barton, a prominent ichthyologist and professor at Centre College, &quot;the earliest ichthyologists were hunters and gatherers who had learned how to obtain the most useful fish, where to obtain them in abundance, and at what times they might be the most available&quot;. Early cultures manifested these insights in abstract and identifiable artistic expressions.

===1500 BC–40 AD===
Informal, scientific descriptions of fish are represented within the Judeo-Christian tradition. The Old Testament laws of kashrut forbade the consumption of fish without scales or appendages. Theologians and ichthyologists believe that the apostle Peter and his contemporaries harvested the fish that are today sold in modern industry along the Sea of Galilee, presently known as Lake Kinneret. These fish include cyprinids of the genera &quot;Barbus&quot; and &quot;Mirogrex&quot;, cichlids of the genus &quot;Sarotherodon&quot;, and &quot;Mugil cephalus&quot; of the family Mugilidae.

=== 335 BC–80 AD ===

Aristotle incorporated ichthyology into formal scientific study. Between 333 and 322 BC, he provided the earliest taxonomic classification of fish, accurately describing 117 species of Mediterranean fish. Furthermore, Aristotle documented anatomical and behavioral differences between fish and marine mammals. After his death, some of his pupils continued his ichthyological research. Theophrastus, for example, composed a treatise on amphibious fish. The Romans, although less devoted to science, wrote extensively about fish. Pliny the Elder, a notable Roman naturalist, compiled the ichthyological works of indigenous Greeks, including verifiable and ambiguous peculiarities such as the sawfish and mermaid, respectively. Pliny&#x27;s documentation was the last significant contribution to ichthyology until the European Renaissance.

=== European Renaissance ===

The writings of three 16th-century scholars, Hippolito Salviani, Pierre Belon, and Guillaume Rondelet, signify the conception of modern ichthyology. The investigations of these individuals were based upon actual research in comparison to ancient recitations. This property popularized and emphasized these discoveries. Despite their prominence, Rondelet&#x27;s &quot;De Piscibus Marinis&quot; is regarded as the most influential, identifying 244 species of fish.

=== 16th–17th century ===

The incremental alterations in navigation and shipbuilding throughout the Renaissance marked the commencement of a new epoch in ichthyology. The Renaissance culminated with the era of exploration and colonization, and upon the cosmopolitan interest in navigation came the specialization in naturalism. Georg Marcgrave of Saxony composed the &quot;Naturalis Brasilae&quot; in 1648. This document contained a description of 100 species of fish indigenous to the Brazilian coastline. In 1686, John Ray and Francis Willughby collaboratively published &quot;Historia Piscium&quot;, a scientific manuscript containing 420 species of fish, 178 of these newly discovered. The fish contained within this informative literature were arranged in a provisional system of classification.
The classification used within the &quot;Historia Piscium&quot; was further developed by Carl Linnaeus, the &quot;father of modern taxonomy&quot;. His taxonomic approach became the systematic approach to the study of organisms, including fish. Linnaeus was a professor at the University of Uppsala and an eminent botanist; however, one of his colleagues, Peter Artedi, earned the title &quot;father of ichthyology&quot; through his indispensable advancements. Artedi contributed to Linnaeus&#x27;s refinement of the principles of taxonomy. Furthermore, he recognized five additional orders of fish: Malacopterygii, Acanthopterygii, Branchiostegi, Chondropterygii, and Plagiuri. Artedi developed standard methods for making counts and measurements of anatomical features that are modernly exploited. Another associate of Linnaeus, Albertus Seba, was a prosperous pharmacist from Amsterdam. Seba assembled a cabinet, or collection, of fish. He invited Artedi to use this assortment of fish; in 1735, Artedi fell into an Amsterdam canal and drowned at the age of 30.

Linnaeus posthumously published Artedi&#x27;s manuscripts as &quot;Ichthyologia, sive Opera Omnia de Piscibus&quot; (1738). His refinement of taxonomy culminated in the development of the binomial nomenclature, which is in use by contemporary ichthyologists. Furthermore, he revised the orders introduced by Artedi, placing significance on pelvic fins. Fish lacking this appendage were placed within the order Apodes; fish having abdominal, thoracic, or jugular pelvic fins were termed Abdominales, Thoracici, and Jugulares, respectively. However, these alterations were not grounded within evolutionary theory. Therefore, over a century was needed for Charles Darwin to provide the intellectual foundation needed to perceive that the degree of similarity in taxonomic features was a consequence of phylogenetic relationships.

=== Modern era ===

Close to the dawn of the 19th century, Marcus Elieser Bloch of Berlin and Georges Cuvier of Paris made attempts to consolidate the knowledge of ichthyology. Cuvier summarized all of the available information in his monumental &quot;Histoire Naturelle des Poissons&quot;. This manuscript was published between 1828 and 1849 in a 22-volume series. This document describes 4,514 species of fish, 2,311 of these new to science. It remains one of the most ambitious treatises of the modern world. Scientific exploration of the Americas advanced knowledge of the remarkable diversity of fish. Charles Alexandre Lesueur was a student of Cuvier. He made a cabinet of fish dwelling within the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River regions.

Adventurous individuals such as John James Audubon and Constantine Samuel Rafinesque figure in the faunal documentation of North America. They often traveled with one another. Rafinesque wrote &quot;Ichthyologic Ohiensis&quot; in 1820. In addition, Louis Agassiz of Switzerland established his reputation through the study of freshwater fish and the first comprehensive treatment of palaeoichthyology, &quot;Poisson Fossil&#x27;s&quot;. In the 1840s, Agassiz moved to the United States, where he taught at Harvard University until his death in 1873.

Albert Günther published his &quot;Catalogue of the Fish of the British Museum&quot; between 1859 and 1870, describing over 6,800 species and mentioning another 1,700. Generally considered one of the most influential ichthyologists, David Starr Jordan wrote 650 articles and books on the subject and served as president of Indiana University and Stanford University.

<text>Single non-transferable vote or SNTV is an electoral system used to elect multiple winners. It is a semi-proportional variant of first-past-the-post voting, applied to multi-member districts where each voter casts just one vote. It can also be seen as a variant of limited voting where each elector votes only once, or as a simpler version of Single Transferable Voting where votes are not transferred.

under SNTV a single party seldom will take all seats in a city or district, as generally happens with winner-take-all systems. SNTV can be considered a variant of dot voting where each voter has only one point to assign.

Unlike block voting or limited voting, where voters can cast multiple votes, under SNTV each voter casts just one. This produces a kind of semi-proportional representation at the district level, meaning small parties, as well as large parties, have a chance to be represented. Under certain assumptions, such as perfect tactical voting SNTV is equivalent to proportional representation by the D&#x27;Hondt method.

SNTV retains many of the problems of first-past-the-post voting (first-preference plurality voting), and as a result is sometimes viewed skeptically by social choice theorists. However, its extreme simplicity and easy vote-counting makes the system particularly popular for small elections to offices such as city councils, particularly when compared to the more-intricate single transferable vote (STV) system, and has resulted in the method becoming commonly used for ordering open party lists.

==Voting==
In any election, each voter casts one vote for one candidate in a multi-candidate race for multiple offices. Posts are filled by the candidates with the most votes (plurality voting). Thus, in a three-seat constituency, the three candidates receiving the largest numbers of votes would win office.

SNTV, like single transferable vote, can be used with non-partisan ballots, in election contests where there are no parties.

===Example===
Three seats are to be filled among five candidates: A, B, C, D and E fielded by 3 parties X, Y and Z.
E, D and C are the winning candidates. Thus, Party Z gets two seats and Party Y gets one seat. No one party took all the seats as might have been the result under first past the post or plurality block voting.

But counting the votes by party gives these vote tallies:
Party Y has more votes than Party Z, but receives fewer seats because of an inefficient spread of votes across the candidates. If Party Y&#x27;s two candidates had had more equal vote tallies, it would have won two seats and Party Z only one. Or if Party Z&#x27;s candidates had received less equal vote tallies, Party Y would have won two seats even if its candidates were not equally popular. (There is more chance in SNTV than a more orderly system of PR, such as list PR or STV.)

If either party had risked trying to win all three seats, causing more vote splitting among supporters of Parties Y and Z, then A of Party X might have won a seat and either party Y or Z would then have taken one fewer seat.

=== SNTV Compared to Block Voting (multiple non-transferable voting) and Limited Voting ===
For example, 10,000 voters vote to elect three members. Cumulative voting is not used so each voter may not cast more than one vote for a single candidate.

* Under block voting (multiple non-transferable voting), each voter may cast 3 votes (but does not have to)
* Under Limited voting, each voter may cast 2 votes maximum.
* Under the single non-transferable vote, each voter may cast 1 vote.

Party A has about 35% support among the electorate (with one particularly well-liked candidate), Party B around 25% (with two well-liked candidates) and the remaining voters primarily support independent candidates, but mostly lean towards party B if they have to choose between the two parties. All voters vote sincerely; there is no tactical voting.
Percent of votes under MNTV and Limited Voting is the percent of voters who voted for the candidate, not the percent of votes cast.
* Single non-transferable vote described here is not a type of approval voting.
* The three most-popular candidates according to voters&#x27; first preferences are elected, regardless of party affiliation.
*Under block voting (Plurality block voting), the three candidates of the most-popular party are elected if its supporters vote along party lines. In this case a party with only 35 percent support took all the seats.
* Under limited voting, it is most likely that the party with a plurality takes two seats (or the same number of seats as the number of votes each voter has), and another less-popular party receives the remaining seat(s).
* Under the single non-transferable vote (like in the other two methods) the number of seats are sometimes not proportionately allocated. Over-optimism (running too many candidates) and vote splitting is harshly punished. But each popular party that runs one candidate is assured of success to that degree anyway. In this case, even though the most-popular party ran three and risked vote splitting, it did elect one member.
* STV (not shown here) would see each party take its due share of seats if voters mark their preferences along party lines. Thus Party A and Party B would take one seat for sure, with the other seat going to Party B due to it being the choice of supporters of the lesser parties if it came to choice of those two main parties.

==Proportional representation==
SNTV facilitates minority representation, that is, it produces mixed representation of large and small parties where no party takes all the seats.

In fact, SNTV would elect the same people as are elected in STV contests where the vote transfers do not move an initially-lower-placing candidate over an initially-higher-placing one. It is common even after STV vote transfers to elect the same as would be elected under SNTV. But not having transfers, SNTV sees more votes wasted than under STV due to votes being placed on un-electable candidate or due to surpluses received by successful candidate over and above the quota used in STV elections that are not able to be transferred under SNTV.

SNTV produces representation that is most proportional (proportional representation) when political parties have accurate information about their relative levels of electoral support, and nominate candidates in accordance with their respective levels of electoral support or when all parties suffer from poor information of that sort. Knowing the portion of the votes a party can take allows it to avoid vote waste due to lessening the chance of vote splitting and inefficient placement of party support. Under &#x27;perfect&#x27; tactical voting and strategic nomination, SNTV would be equivalent to the D&#x27;Hondt (Jefferson) method of proportional representation.

But under SNTV even inefficient distribution of votes allows more balanced representation than would be elected under either single-member plurality or block voting.

Given formula_1 candidates to be elected, Candidate A can guarantee success by receiving one more than formula_2 of the votes (the Droop quota), because formula_1+1 other candidates cannot each receive more than Candidate A (too many would not pass Droop quota)

But as SNTV is a plurality system and votes are wasted (not used to elect anyone), it is possible to win with less than Droop quota (but never possible to lose if you have at least Droop). 

To determine the successful candidates, candidates&#x27; vote tallies are compared with the vote tallies of others, not with a theoretical threshold or quota. In the 2020 Vanuatuan general election, using SNTV, as few as 5 percent of the vote was enough to be elected in a seven-seat district, where about 13 percent is Droop quota.

Vote splitting due to poor information on voters&#x27; behaviour may deny a popular party its due share of representation. (Single Transferable Voting does not suffer from this handicap as votes are transferable and many are transferred and used that are wasted under SNTV.) Parties organizing slates of multiple candidates may nominate many candidates and then learn on election night that the party was not as popular as they thought.

If every party does that, all suffer the same inefficiency and the final result is proportional. If one party is more prudent, it may do better than the others. Because votes cannot be transferred, there is more chance of vote wastage than under STV.

But in elections that use SNTV, representation is usually mixed. It is rare for one party to make a sweep of a city&#x27;s seats, a thing common in First past the post elections. The number of wasted votes in an SNTV election is generally lower than in First past the post elections as well.

Under SNTV, parties often do not receive representation exactly proportional to their strength, because it is difficult to accurately judge their strength when deciding how many candidates to field (strategic nomination) and difficult to direct party supporters as a whole to spread their votes efficiently. If they field too many, supporters&#x27; votes might be split across too many candidates. The party votes might spread their vote numbers to the point where all of a party&#x27;s candidates lose to a less thinly spread opposing party.

If a party fields too few candidates, they might elect all their candidates but not win seats proportional to their level of support, and the winning candidates would have more support than necessary and thus wasting votes.

The risks of poor strategic nomination are not equal for parties of various strengths. A large party would have much more to lose from the split vote effect than to gain from avoiding the wasted vote effect, and so would likely decide to err on the side of fielding fewer candidates (but probably not less than their existing number of seats). A small party with little representation would be more risk-tolerant and err on the side of too many candidates, hoping to gain as many seats as possible, perhaps even winning more than its proportion of the electorate if they can edge out candidates from larger parties with just a few votes. As well, a small party running just one candidate would not suffer from vote spitting, while a larger party running four or more may suffer from that.

SNTV electoral systems, like STV and proportional electoral systems generally, typically produce more proportional electoral outcomes as the size of the electoral districts (number of seats in each constituency) increases.

==Potential for tactical voting==
The potential for tactical voting in a single non-transferable vote system is large. Casting only one vote, a rational voter wanting to maximize the number of seats captured by his party should vote for a candidate of the party that has a chance of winning, but one that will not win by too great a margin and thus take votes away from party colleagues. This creates opportunities for tactical nominations, with parties nominating candidates similar to their opponents&#x27; candidates in order to split the vote. Like all multiple-winner selections, parties find it advantageous to run a range of candidates in SNTV elections.

SNTV has been measured through the lens of such concepts as &quot;decision-theoretic analysis&quot;. Professor Gary W. Cox, an expert on SNTV, has studied this system&#x27;s use in Japan. Cox has an explanation of real-world data finding the, &quot;two systems [plurality and semi-proportional] are alike in their strategic voting equilibria.&quot; His research found that voters use the information offered in campaigns (polls, reporting, fundraising totals, endorsements, etc.), to rationally decide who the most viable candidates are and then vote for them.

SNTV can result in complicated intra-party dynamics because in a SNTV system, a candidate runs against candidates from their own party as well as against candidates from the other party. SNTV elections are not zero-sum contests. Just because one particular candidate is elected does not mean that another specific candidate will not be. They both can be elected.

Because running on issues may lead to a situation in which a candidate becomes too popular and therefore draws votes away from other allied candidates, SNTV may encourage legislators to join factions that consist of patron-client relationships in which a powerful legislator can apportion votes to his or her supporters.

In addition, parties will do best if their supporters evenly distribute their votes among the party&#x27;s candidates. Historically, in Taiwan, the Kuomintang did this by sending members a letter telling them which candidate to vote for. With the Democratic Progressive Party, vote sharing is done informally, as members of a family or small group will coordinate their votes. The New Party had a surprisingly effective system by asking party supporters to vote for the candidate whose identification number corresponded to their birthdate. This led to a system of vote allocation which had been adopted by all parties for the 2004 ROC legislative elections.

==History==
Single Non-transferable Voting was first proposed in solid form by Saint-Just in 1793, in a proposal to the French National Convention. He proposed having the whole country as one multi-seat district; but the idea was not adopted in France at that time.

Japan was the first country to adopt SNTV for election of government members a hundred years later than Saint-Just&#x27;s proposal. In 1880s Japan adopted SNTV for provincial politicians and in 1900 for national politicians.

==Usage==
SNTV is used for elections in Puerto Rico, Kuwait, Indonesia, Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, Libya, Iraq, Hong Kong and Vanuatu.

===Puerto Rico===
In Puerto Rico, SNTV is known as &quot;at-large representation&quot; (&quot;representación por acumulación&quot; in Spanish), SNTV is used to elect the 11 at-large members in each of the House of Representatives and the Senate. Under &quot;at-large representation&quot;, political parties vary the ballot order of their candidates across electoral divisions, in order to ensure each candidate has a roughly equal chance of success. Since most voters choose the candidates placed at the top of their party lists on their ballots, at-large candidates from the same party usually obtain approximately equal vote totals. When the party&#x27;s candidates are equally supported, the most-popular party is often able to take six seats of the 11.

The two major Puerto Rican political parties, the Popular Democratic Party and the New Progressive Party, usually each run six candidates for the 11 at-large members in each of the House of Representatives and the Senate, while the much smaller Puerto Rican Independence Party runs a single-candidate slate for the at-large members in the Senate and the House of Representatives. The SNTV-elected members are a small part of the chambers compared to the members elected in the sixteen Senate districts, elected by block voting, and the forty House districts, elected by first-past-the-post voting.

===Japan, South Korea and Taiwan===
SNTV was once used to elect the legislatures of Japan, South Korea and the Republic of China (Taiwan), but its use has been discontinued for the most part. It is still used in Japan for some seats in the House of Councillors (Sangi-in), prefectural assemblies and municipal assemblies.

In Taiwan it is used for the six aboriginal seats in the Legislative Yuan (national legislature), as well as local assemblies. The party structure there was complicated by the fact that while members of the Legislative Yuan were elected by SNTV, executive positions were (and still are) elected by a first past the post. This created a party system in which smaller factionalized parties, which SNTV promotes, have formed two large coalitions that resembles the two party system which first past the post rewards. Starting with the 2008 legislative elections, SNTV was discarded in favor of a mixed &quot;single member district&quot; (SMD) with proportional representation based on national party votes, similar to Japan. This system was a legacy of its colonial rule inherited from the Meiji Constitution.

===Hong Kong===
From 1997 to 2016, the electoral system for up to half of the seats of the Legislative Council of the territory was nominally a party-list proportional representation system with Hare quota. In practice, political parties fielded multiple lists in the same constituency. For example, the Democratic Party fielded three separate lists in the eight-seat New Territories West constituency in the 2008 election, aiming to win three seats (they won two). Split list or split tickets is done in order to win more seats with fewer votes, since the first candidate on each list would require less than the Hare quota to get a seat. Supporters are asked to split their votes among the lists of the same party, usually along geographical location of residence. In the 2012 and 2016 elections, no candidate list won more than one seat in any of the six PR constituencies which returned a total of 40 seats, rendering the result effectively the same as SNTV.

In the 2021 Hong Kong electoral reform, the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress instituted SNTV in its amendment to Annex 2 of the Basic Law on 30 March 2021. 20 seats of the Legislative Council are returned by geographical constituencies (GC) through single non-transferable vote with a district magnitude of 2. Effect of the district size of 2 under SNTV system in Hong Kong have been compared to that of the binomial voting system.

===Libya===
In accordance with its post-Gaddafi electoral law, Libya in 2012 elected 80 members of its 200-seat General National Congress using single non-transferable vote. Some commentators cited the system as a factor in the subsequent return to civil war in 2014.

===Chile===
After the 2015 electoral reform, Chileans elect their representatives to both houses of Congress through open lists presented by parties or party coalitions in each of the electoral districts into which the country is divided for the contest, allowing only one vote for one of the candidates inside any list. Once the voting is over, the distribution of seats in each district (which can range from 3 to 8 in the lower house and from 2 to 5 in the upper one) is carried out through the D&#x27;Hondt method, ordering the lists from highest to lowest according to the total vote of each one and the candidates within each one of them with the same principle.

===Jordan===
SNTV was used in Jordan from 1993 to 2016. SNTV became the official electoral system for legislature elections in Jordan in 1993, the second election since the country&#x27;s return to an elected parliament in 1989. The 1993 electoral reform introduced SNTV as the &quot;one-man, one-vote&quot;, which was argued to be a more egalitarian alternative to the former &quot;block vote&quot; (or Multiple non-transferable vote) where constituents could cast as many votes as there were seats in their constituency. (Under SNTV, each voter cast just one.) The Jordanian opposition parties were heavily critical of the voting reform as it significantly hurt their electoral results. The Islamic Action Front was at the forefront of this criticism, boycotting 4 of the 6 elections held under this system. The last election held purely under this system was in 2010, whose parliament was dissolved after the Arab Spring protests in Jordan and a new election was held in 2013 using both SNTV and a national closed list with a proportional system. SNTV was completely abolished after the 2016 electoral reform where it was replaced with open list PR (in 23 constituencies of between three and nine seats each) plus 15 seats reserved for women.

===Kuwait===
Kuwait has used SNTV to elect the members of its National Assembly (Majles al-Umma) in five 10-member districts, starting with the 2012 election.

===Vanuatu===
Since independence from Britain and France in 1980, Vanuatu has used SNTV to elect most of the members of its Parliament. Currently, other than eight members elected in single-member constituencies, the 52 members of Parliament are elected in ten multi-member constituencies (of between two and seven seats) by single non-transferable vote. The last election this was done was the 2025 Vanuatuan general election.

<doc id="42411" wikidata="Q213393" url="?curid=42411" title="John Wesley">
<text>John Wesley ( ; 2 March 1791) was an English cleric, theologian, and evangelist who was a principal leader of a revival movement within the Church of England known as Methodism. The societies he founded became the dominant form of the independent Methodist movement that continues to this day.

Educated at Charterhouse and Christ Church, Oxford, Wesley was elected a fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford, in 1726 and ordained as an Anglican priest two years later. At Oxford, he led the &quot;Holy Club&quot;, a society formed for the purpose of the study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life. After an unsuccessful two-year ministry in Savannah, Georgia, he returned to London and joined a religious society led by Moravian Christians. On 24 May 1738, he experienced what has come to be called his evangelical conversion. He subsequently left the Moravians and began his own ministry.

A key step in the development of Wesley&#x27;s ministry was to travel widely and preach outdoors, embracing Arminian doctrines. Moving across Great Britain and Ireland, he helped form and organise small Christian groups (societies and classes) that developed intensive and personal accountability, discipleship, and religious instruction. He appointed itinerant, unordained evangelists—both women and men—to care for these groups of people. Under Wesley&#x27;s direction, Methodists became leaders in many social issues of the day, including the abolition of slavery and support for women preachers.

Although he was not a systematic theologian, Wesley argued against Calvinism and for the notion of Christian perfection, which he cited as the reason that he felt God &quot;raised up&quot; Methodists into existence. His evangelicalism, firmly grounded in sacramental theology, maintained that means of grace played a role in sanctification of the believer; however, he taught that it was by faith a believer was transformed into the likeness of Christ. He held that, in this life, Christians could achieve a state where the love of God &quot;reigned supreme in their hearts&quot;, giving them not only outward but inward holiness. Wesley&#x27;s teachings, collectively known as Wesleyan theology, continue to inform the doctrine of Methodist churches.

Throughout his life, Wesley remained within the established Church of England, insisting that the Methodist movement lay well within its tradition. In his early ministry years, Wesley was barred from preaching in many parish churches and the Methodists were persecuted; he later became widely respected, and by the end of his life, was described as &quot;the best-loved man in England&quot;.
==Early life==
John Wesley was born on in Epworth, 23 miles (37 km) north-west of Lincoln. He was the 15th child of Samuel Wesley and his wife Susanna Wesley (née Annesley). Samuel Wesley was a graduate of the University of Oxford and a poet who, from 1696, was rector of Epworth. He married Susanna, the 25th child of Samuel Annesley, a dissenting minister, in 1689. Ultimately, she bore 19 children, nine of whom lived beyond infancy. She and Samuel Wesley had become members of the Church of England as young adults.

As in many families at the time, Wesley&#x27;s parents gave their children their early education. Each child, including the girls, was taught to read as soon as they turned five years old. They were expected to become proficient in Latin and Greek and to have learned major portions of the New Testament by heart. Susanna Wesley examined each child before the midday meal and before evening prayers. The children were not allowed to eat between meals and were interviewed singly by their mother one evening each week for the purpose of intensive spiritual instruction. In 1714, at age 11, Wesley was sent to the Charterhouse School in London (under the mastership of John King from 1715), where he lived the studious, methodical and, for a while, religious life in which he had been trained at home.

Apart from his disciplined upbringing, a rectory fire which occurred on 9 February 1709, when Wesley was five years old, left an indelible impression. Some time after 11:00 pm, the rectory roof caught on fire. Sparks falling on the children&#x27;s beds and cries of &quot;fire&quot; from the street roused the Wesleys who managed to shepherd all their children out of the house except for John who was left stranded on an upper floor. With stairs aflame and the roof about to collapse, Wesley was lifted out of a window by a parishioner standing on another man&#x27;s shoulders. Wesley later used the phrase, &quot;a brand plucked out of the fire&quot;, quoting , to describe the incident. This childhood deliverance subsequently became part of the Wesley legend, attesting to his special destiny and extraordinary work. Wesley was also influenced by the reported haunting of Epworth Rectory between 1716 and 1717. The Wesley family reported frequently hearing noises and occasionally seeing apparitions which they believed were caused by a ghost called &#x27;Old Jeffery&#x27;.

==Education==
In June 1720, Wesley entered Christ Church, Oxford. After graduating in 1724, Wesley stayed on at Christ Church to study for his master&#x27;s degree.

He was ordained a deacon on 25 September 1725—holy orders being a necessary step toward becoming a fellow and tutor at the university. On 17 March 1726, Wesley was unanimously elected a fellow of Lincoln College, Oxford. This carried with it the right to a room at the college and regular salary. While continuing his studies, he taught Greek and philosophy, lectured on the New Testament and moderated daily disputations at the university. However, a call to ministry intruded upon his academic career. In August 1727, after completing his master&#x27;s degree, Wesley returned to Epworth. His father had requested his assistance in serving the neighbouring cure of Wroot. Ordained a priest on 22 September 1728, Wesley served as a parish curate for two years.

In the year of his ordination, he read Thomas à Kempis and Jeremy Taylor, showed his interest in mysticism, and began to seek the religious truths which underlay the great revival of the 18th century. The reading of William Law&#x27;s &quot;Christian Perfection&quot; and &quot;A Serious Call to a Devout and Holy Life&quot; gave him, he said, a more sublime view of the law of God; and he resolved to keep it, inwardly and outwardly, as sacredly as possible, believing that in obedience he would find salvation. He pursued a rigidly methodical and abstemious life, studied Scripture, and performed his religious duties diligently, depriving himself so that he would have alms to give. He began to seek after holiness of heart and life.

Wesley returned to Oxford in November 1729 at the request of the Rector of Lincoln College and to maintain his status as a junior fellow.

===Holy Club===

During Wesley&#x27;s absence, his younger brother Charles (1707–88) matriculated at Christ Church; along with two fellow students, he formed a small club for the purpose of study and the pursuit of a devout Christian life. On Wesley&#x27;s return, he became the leader of the group which increased somewhat in number and greatly in commitment. The group met daily from six until nine for prayer, psalms, and reading of the Greek New Testament. They prayed every waking hour for several minutes and each day for a special virtue. While the church&#x27;s prescribed attendance was only three times a year, they took Communion every Sunday. They fasted on Wednesdays and Fridays until nones (3:00 pm) as was commonly observed in the ancient church. In 1730, the group began the practice of visiting prisoners in gaol. The men preached, educated, and relieved gaoled debtors whenever possible, and cared for the sick.

Given the low ebb of spirituality in Oxford at that time, Wesley&#x27;s group provoked a negative reaction. They were considered to be religious &quot;enthusiasts&quot;, which in the context of the time meant religious fanatics. University wits styled them the &quot;Holy Club&quot;, a title of derision. Currents of opposition became a furore following the mental breakdown and death of a group member, William Morgan. In response to the charge that &quot;rigorous fasting&quot; had hastened his death, Wesley noted that Morgan had left off fasting a year and a half since. In the same letter, which was widely circulated, Wesley referred to the name &quot;Methodist&quot; with which &quot;some of our neighbors are pleased to compliment us&quot;. That name was used by an anonymous author in a published pamphlet (1732) describing Wesley and his group, &quot;The Oxford Methodists&quot;. This ministry, however, was not without controversy. The Holy Club ministered and maintained support for Thomas Blair who in 1732 was found guilty of sodomy. Blair was notorious among the townspeople and his fellow prisoners, and Wesley continued to support him.

For all of his outward piety, Wesley sought to cultivate his inner holiness or at least his sincerity as evidence of being a true Christian. A list of &quot;General Questions&quot; which he developed in 1730 evolved into an elaborate grid by 1734 in which he recorded his daily activities hour-by-hour, resolutions he had broken or kept, and ranked his hourly &quot;temper of devotion&quot; on a scale of 1 to 9. Wesley also regarded the contempt with which he and his group were held to be a mark of a true Christian. As he put it in a letter to his father, &quot;Till he be thus contemned, no man is in a state of salvation.&quot;

==Journey to Savannah, Georgia==
On 14 October 1735, Wesley and his brother Charles sailed on &quot;The Simmonds&quot; from Gravesend in Kent for Savannah in the Province of Georgia in the American colonies at the request of James Oglethorpe, who had founded the colony in 1733 on behalf of the Trustees for the Establishment of the Colony of Georgia in America. Oglethorpe wanted Wesley to be the minister of the newly formed Savannah parish, a new town laid out in accordance with the famous Oglethorpe Plan.

It was on the voyage to the colonies that the Wesleys first came into contact with Moravian settlers. Wesley was influenced by their deep faith and spirituality rooted in pietism. At one point in the voyage, a storm came up and broke the mast off the ship. While the English panicked, the Moravians calmly sang hymns and prayed. This experience led Wesley to believe that the Moravians possessed an inner strength which he lacked. The deeply personal religion that the Moravian pietists practised heavily influenced Wesley and is reflected in his theology of Methodism.

Wesley arrived in the colony in February 1736, and lived for a year at the parsonage that stood on the site of today&#x27;s Oliver Sturges House. He approached the Georgia mission as a High churchman, seeing it as an opportunity to revive &quot;primitive Christianity&quot; in a primitive environment. Although his primary goal was to evangelise the Native American people, a shortage of clergy in the colony largely limited his ministry to European settlers in Savannah. While his ministry has often been judged to have been a failure in comparison to his later success as a leader in the Evangelical Revival, Wesley gathered around him a group of devoted Christians, who met in a number of small group religious societies. At the same time, attendance at Communion increased over the course of nearly two years in which he served as Christ Church&#x27;s parish priest.

Nonetheless, Wesley&#x27;s High Church ministry was controversial among the colonists and it ended in disappointment after Wesley fell in love with a young woman named Sophia (or Sophy) Hopkey. He hesitated to marry her because he felt that his first priority in Georgia was to be a missionary to the Native Americans, and he was interested in the practice of clerical celibacy within early Christianity. Following her marriage to William Williamson, Wesley believed Sophia&#x27;s former zeal for practising the Christian faith declined. In strictly applying the rubrics of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot;, Wesley denied her Communion after she failed to signify to him in advance her intention of taking it. As a result, legal proceedings against him ensued in which a clear resolution seemed unlikely. On 22 December 1737, Wesley fled the colony and returned to England.

One of the most significant accomplishments of Wesley&#x27;s Georgia mission was his publication of a &quot;Collection of Psalms and Hymns&quot;. The &quot;Collection&quot; was the first Anglican hymnal published in America, and the first of many hymn books Wesley published. It included five hymns he translated from German.

==Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Aldersgate experience&quot;==
As a result of his experience in Georgia, Wesley became depressed. While on his voyage home to England, he had the opportunity to think about his own religious faith. He found that, although he had committed to the life of following Christ, he was dissatisfied with his spiritual soundness and felt inadequate to preach, especially after witnessing the confident way in which the Moravians had preached their faith. Both he and Charles received counsel from Moravian minister Peter Boehler, who was temporarily in England awaiting permission to depart for Georgia himself. Boehler encouraged Wesley to &quot;preach faith until you have it&quot;.

Wesley&#x27;s noted &quot;Aldersgate experience&quot; of 24 May 1738, at a Moravian meeting in Aldersgate Street, London, in which he heard a reading of Martin Luther&#x27;s preface to the Epistle to the Romans, revolutionised the character and method of his ministry. The previous week he had been highly impressed by the sermon of John Heylyn, whom he was assisting in the service at St Mary le Strand. Earlier that day, he had heard the choir at St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral singing Psalm 130, where the Psalmist calls to God &quot;Out of the depths.&quot;

But it was still a depressed Wesley who attended a service on the evening of 24 May. Wesley recounted his Aldersgate experience in his journal: 
&quot;In the evening I went very unwillingly to a society in Aldersgate Street, where one was reading Luther&#x27;s Preface to the Epistle to the Romans. About a quarter before nine, while he was describing the change which God works in the heart through faith in Christ, I felt my heart strangely warmed. I felt I did trust in Christ, Christ alone for salvation, and an assurance was given me that he had taken away my sins, even mine, and saved me from the law of sin and death.&quot;

A few weeks later, Wesley preached a sermon on the doctrine of personal salvation by faith, which was followed by another, on God&#x27;s grace &quot;free in all, and free for all.&quot; Considered a pivotal moment, Daniel L. Burnett writes: &quot;The significance of Wesley&#x27;s Aldersgate Experience is monumental ... Without it, the names of Wesley and Methodism would likely be nothing more than obscure footnotes in the pages of church history.&quot; Burnett describes this event as Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Evangelical Conversion&quot;. May 24 is commemorated in Methodist churches as Aldersgate Day.

==After Aldersgate: Working with the Moravians==
Wesley allied himself with the Moravian society in Fetter Lane. In August 1738 Wesley travelled to Germany, specifically to see Herrnhut in Saxony, as he wished to study at the Moravian headquarters there. On his return to England, Wesley drew up rules for the &quot;bands&quot; into which the Fetter Lane Society was divided and published a collection of hymns for them. He met frequently with this and other religious societies in London but did not preach often in 1738, because most of the parish churches were closed to him.

Wesley&#x27;s Oxford friend, the evangelist George Whitefield, was also excluded from the churches of Bristol upon his return from America. When Wesley reached Bristol, the city was booming with new industrial and commercial development. Because of this, there were social uproars with riots and religious troubles. About a fifth of the population were Dissenters, while many of the Anglicans possessed a religious enthusiasm that made them receptive to Wesley&#x27;s message and approach. Going to the neighbouring village of Kingswood, in February 1739, Whitefield preached in the open air to a company of miners. Later he preached in Whitefield&#x27;s Tabernacle. Wesley hesitated to accept Whitefield&#x27;s call to copy this bold step. Overcoming his scruples, he preached the first time at Whitefield&#x27;s invitation a sermon in the open air, at a brickyard, near St Philip&#x27;s Marsh, on 2 April 1739. Wesley wrote,

I could scarce reconcile myself to this strange way of preaching in the fields, of which he [Whitefield] set me an example on Sunday; having been all my life till very lately so tenacious of every point relating to decency and order, that I should have thought the saving of souls almost a sin if it had not been done in a church.

Wesley was unhappy about the idea of field preaching as he believed Anglican liturgy had much to offer in its practice. Earlier in his life he would have thought that such a method of saving souls was &quot;almost a sin.&quot; He recognised the open-air services were successful in reaching men and women who would not enter most churches. From then on he took the opportunities to preach wherever an assembly could be brought together, more than once using his father&#x27;s tombstone at Epworth as a pulpit. Wesley preached to create repentance, prayed for conversion, dealt with hysterical behaviour, and preached to upwards of thousands through field preaching. Wesley continued for fifty years—entering churches when he was invited, and taking his stand in the fields, in halls, cottages, and chapels, when the churches would not receive him.

Late in 1739, Wesley broke with the Moravians in London. Wesley had helped them organise the Fetter Lane Society, and those converted by his preaching and that of his brother and Whitefield had become members of their bands. But he believed they fell into heresy by supporting quietism, so he decided to form his own followers into a separate society. &quot;Thus,&quot; he wrote, &quot;without any previous plan, began the Methodist Society in England.&quot; He soon formed similar societies in Bristol and Kingswood, and Wesley and his friends made converts wherever they went.

==Persecutions and lay preaching==
From 1739 onward, Wesley and the Methodists were persecuted by clergy and religious magistrates for various reasons. Though Wesley had been ordained an Anglican priest, many other Methodist leaders had not received ordination. And for his own part, Wesley flouted many regulations of the Church of England concerning parish boundaries and who had the authority to preach. This was seen as a social threat that disregarded institutions. Clergy attacked them in sermons and in print, and at times mobs attacked them. Wesley and his followers continued to work among the neglected and needy. They were denounced as promulgators of strange doctrines, fomenters of religious disturbances; as blind fanatics, leading people astray, claiming miraculous gifts, attacking the clergy of the Church of England, and trying to re-establish Catholicism.

Wesley felt that the church failed to call sinners to repentance, that many of the clergy were corrupt, and that people were perishing in their sins. He believed he was commissioned by God to bring about revival in the church, and no opposition, persecution, or obstacles could prevail against the divine urgency and authority of this commission. The prejudices of his High-church training, his strict notions of the methods and proprieties of public worship, his views of the apostolic succession and the prerogatives of the priest, even his most cherished convictions, were not allowed to stand in the way.

Seeing that he and the few clergy cooperating with him could not do the work that needed to be done, Wesley was led, as early as 1739, to approve local preachers. He evaluated and approved men who were not ordained by the Anglican Church to preach and do pastoral work. This expansion of lay preachers was one of the keys to the growth of Methodism.

==Chapels and organisations==

As his societies needed houses to worship in, Wesley began to provide chapels, first in Bristol at the New Room, then in London (first The Foundery and then Wesley&#x27;s Chapel) and elsewhere. The Foundery was an early chapel used by Wesley. The location of the Foundery is shown on an 18th-century map, where it rests between Tabernacle Street and Worship Street in the Moorfields area of London. When the Wesleys spotted the building atop Windmill Hill, north of Finsbury Fields, the structure which previously cast brass guns and mortars for the Royal Ordnance had been sitting vacant for 23 years; it had been abandoned because of an explosion on 10 May 1716.

The Bristol chapel (built in 1739) was at first in the hands of trustees. A large debt was contracted, and Wesley&#x27;s friends urged him to keep it under his own control, so the deed was cancelled and he became sole trustee. Following this precedent, all Methodist chapels were committed in trust to him until by a &quot;deed of declaration&quot;, all his interests in them were transferred to a body of preachers called the &quot;Legal Hundred&quot;.

When disorder arose among some members of the societies, Wesley adopted giving tickets to members, with their names written by his own hand. These were renewed every three months. Those deemed unworthy did not receive new tickets and dropped out of the society without disturbance. The tickets were regarded as commendatory letters.

When the debt on a chapel became a burden, it was proposed that one in 12 members should collect offerings regularly from the 11 allotted to him. Out of this grew the Methodist class-meeting system in 1742. To keep the disorderly out of the societies, Wesley established a probationary system. He undertook to visit each society regularly in what became the quarterly visitation, or conference. As the number of societies increased, Wesley could not keep personal contact, so in 1743 he drew up a set of &quot;General Rules&quot; for the &quot;United Societies&quot;. These were the nucleus of the Methodist &quot;Discipline&quot;, still the basis of modern Methodism.

Wesley laid the foundations of what now constitutes the organisation of the Methodist Church. Over time, a shifting pattern of societies, circuits, quarterly meetings, annual conferences, classes, bands, and select societies took shape. At the local level, there were numerous societies of different sizes which were grouped into circuits to which travelling preachers were appointed for two-year periods. Circuit officials met quarterly under a senior travelling preacher or &quot;assistant.&quot; Conferences with Wesley, travelling preachers and others were convened annually for the purpose of co-ordinating doctrine and discipline for the entire connection. Classes of a dozen or so society members under a leader met weekly for spiritual fellowship and guidance. In the early years, there were &quot;bands&quot; of the spiritually gifted who consciously pursued perfection. Those who were regarded to have achieved it were grouped in select societies or bands. In 1744, there were 77 such members. There also was a category of penitents which consisted of backsliders.

As the number of preachers and preaching-houses increased, doctrinal and administrative matters needed to be discussed; so John and Charles Wesley, along with four other clergy and four lay preachers, met for consultation in London in 1744. This was the first Methodist conference; subsequently, the Conference (with Wesley as its president) became the ruling body of the Methodist movement. Two years later, to help preachers work more systematically and societies receive services more regularly, Wesley appointed &quot;helpers&quot; to definitive circuits. Each circuit included at least 30 appointments a month. Believing that the preacher&#x27;s efficiency was promoted by his being changed from one circuit to another every year or two, Wesley established the &quot;&quot; and insisted that his preachers submit to its rules.

John Wesley had strong links with the North West of England, visiting Manchester on at least fifteen occasions between 1733 and 1790. In 1733 and 1738 he preached at St Ann&#x27;s Church and Salford Chapel, meeting with his friend John Clayton. In 1781 Wesley opened the chapel on Oldham Street—part of the Manchester and Salford Wesleyan Methodist Mission, now the site of Manchester&#x27;s Methodist Central Hall.

Wesley travelled to Ireland for the first time in 1747 and continued through 1789. He rejected the Catholic Church, so he worked to convert the people of Ireland to Methodism. Overall, the numbers grew to over 15,000 by 1795.

Following an illness in 1748 Wesley was nursed by a class leader and housekeeper, Grace Murray, at an orphan house in Newcastle. Taken with Grace, he invited her to travel with him to Ireland in 1749 where he believed them to be betrothed though they were never married. It has been suggested that his brother Charles Wesley objected to the engagement, though this is disputed. Subsequently, Grace married John Bennett, a preacher.

==Ordination of ministers==
As the societies multiplied, they adopted the elements of an ecclesiastical system. The divide between Wesley and the Church of England widened. The question of division from the Church of England was urged by some of his preachers and societies, but most strenuously opposed by his brother Charles. Wesley refused to leave the Church of England, believing that Anglicanism was &quot;with all her blemishes, [...] nearer the Scriptural plans than any other in Europe&quot;. In 1745 Wesley wrote that he would make any concession which his conscience permitted, to live in peace with the clergy. He could not give up the doctrine of an inward and present salvation by faith itself; he would not stop preaching, nor dissolve the societies, nor end preaching by lay members. In the same year, in correspondence with a friend, he wrote that he believed it wrong to administer sacraments without having been ordained by a bishop.

When, in 1746, Wesley read Lord King&#x27;s account of the primitive church, he became convinced that apostolic succession could be transmitted through not only bishops, but also presbyters (priests). He wrote that he was &quot;a scriptural &quot;episkopos&quot; as much as many men in England.&quot; Although he believed in apostolic succession, he also once called the idea of uninterrupted succession a &quot;fable&quot;.

Edward Stillingfleet&#x27;s &quot;Irenicon&quot; led him to decide that ordination (and holy orders) could be valid when performed by a presbyter rather than a bishop. Nevertheless, some believe that Wesley was secretly consecrated a bishop in 1763 by Erasmus of Arcadia, and that Wesley could not openly announce his episcopal consecration without incurring the penalty of the &quot;Præmunire&quot; Act.

In 1784, he believed he could no longer wait for the Bishop of London to ordain someone for the American Methodists, who were without the sacraments after the American War of Independence. The Church of England had been disestablished in the United States, where it had been the state church in most of the southern colonies. The Church of England had not yet appointed a United States bishop to what would become the Protestant Episcopal Church in America. Wesley ordained Thomas Coke as superintendent of Methodists in the United States by the laying on of hands, although Coke was already a priest in the Church of England. He also ordained Richard Whatcoat and Thomas Vasey as presbyters; Whatcoat and Vasey sailed to America with Coke. Wesley intended that Coke and Francis Asbury (whom Coke ordained as superintendent by direction of Wesley) should ordain others in the newly founded Methodist Episcopal Church in the United States. In 1787, Coke and Asbury persuaded the American Methodists to refer to them as bishops rather than superintendents, overruling Wesley&#x27;s objections to the change.

His brother, Charles, was alarmed by the ordinations and Wesley&#x27;s evolving view of the matter. He begged Wesley to stop before he had &quot;quite broken down the bridge&quot; and not embitter his [Charles&#x27;] last moments on earth, nor &quot;leave an indelible blot on our memory.&quot; Wesley replied that he had not separated from the church, nor did he intend to, but he must and would save as many souls as he could while alive, &quot;without being careful about what may possibly be when I die.&quot; Although Wesley rejoiced that the Methodists in America were free, he advised his English followers to remain in the established church.

==Doctrines, theology and advocacy==

=== Theological methodology ===
The 20th-century Wesleyan scholar Albert Outler argued in his introduction to the 1964 collection &quot;John Wesley&quot; that Wesley developed his theology by using a method that Outler termed the Wesleyan Quadrilateral. In this method, Wesley believed that the living core of Christianity was contained in Scripture (the Bible), and that it was the sole foundational source of theological development. The centrality of Scripture was so important for Wesley that he called himself &quot;a man of one book,&quot; although he was well-read for his day. However, he believed that doctrine had to be in keeping with Christian orthodox tradition. So, tradition was considered the second aspect of the Quadrilateral. Wesley contended that a part of the theological method would involve experiential faith. In other words, truth would be vivified in the personal experience of Christians (overall, not individually), if it were really truth. And every doctrine must be able to be defended rationally. He did not divorce faith from reason. Tradition, experience and reason, however, were subject always to Scripture, Wesley argued, because only there is the Word of God revealed &quot;so far as it is necessary for our salvation.&quot;

The doctrines which Wesley emphasised in his sermons and writings are prevenient grace, present personal salvation by faith, the witness of the Spirit, and entire sanctification.

=== The witness of the Spirit ===
Wesley defined the witness of the Spirit as: &quot;an inward impression on the soul of believers, whereby the Spirit of God directly testifies to their spirit that they are the children of God.&quot; He inherited this doctrine from the Protestant reformers, Martin Luther and John Calvin, and saw its basis in several passages of the Bible, such as . This doctrine was closely related to his belief that salvation had to be &quot;personal.&quot; In his view, a person must ultimately believe the Good News for himself or herself; no one could be in relation to God for another.

=== Entire sanctification ===
Entire sanctification, he described in 1790, as the &quot;grand &quot;depositum&quot; which God has lodged with the people called &#x27;Methodists&#x27;&quot; and that the propagation of this doctrine was the reason that He brought Methodists into existence. Wesley taught that entire sanctification was obtainable after justification by faith, between justification and death. Wesley defined it as:&quot;That habitual disposition of soul which, in the sacred writings, is termed holiness; and which directly implies, the being cleansed from sin, &#x27;from all filthiness both of flesh and spirit;&#x27; and, by consequence, the being endued with those virtues which were in Christ Jesus; the being so &#x27;renewed in the image of our mind,&#x27; as to be &#x27;perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect.&quot;The term &quot;sinless perfection&quot; was one which Wesley avoided using &quot;because of its ambiguity,&quot; rather, he contended that a Christian could be made &quot;perfect in love&quot;. (Wesley studied Eastern Orthodoxy and embraced particularly the doctrine of &quot;Theosis&quot;). This love would mean, first of all, that a believer&#x27;s motives, rather than being self-centred, would be guided by the deep desire to please God. One would be able to keep from committing what Wesley called, &quot;sin rightly so-called.&quot; By this, he meant a conscious or intentional breach of God&#x27;s will or laws.

Secondly, to be made perfect in love meant, for Wesley, that a Christian could live with a primary guiding regard for others and their welfare. He based this on Christ&#x27;s quote that the second great command is &quot;to love your neighbour as you love yourself.&quot; In Wesley&#x27;s view, this orientation would cause a person to avoid any number of sins against his neighbour. This love, plus the love for God that could be the central focus of a person&#x27;s faith, would be what Wesley referred to as &quot;a fulfilment of the law of Christ.&quot; He described perfection as a second blessing and instantaneous sanctifying experience; he maintained that individuals could have the assurance of their entire sanctification through the testimony of the Holy Spirit. Wesley collected and published such testimonies.

===Advocacy of Arminianism===
Wesley entered controversies as he tried to enlarge church practice. The most notable of his controversies was that on Calvinism. His father was of the Arminian school in the church. Wesley came to his own conclusions while in college and expressed himself strongly against the doctrines of Calvinistic election and reprobation. His system of thought has become known as Wesleyan Arminianism, the foundations of which were laid by Wesley and his fellow preacher John William Fletcher. Although Wesley knew very little about the beliefs of Jacob Arminius and arrived at his religious views independently of Arminius, Wesley acknowledged late in life, with the 1778 publication of &quot;The Arminian Magazine&quot;, that he and Arminius were in general agreement. He is now regarded as a faithful representative of Arminius&#x27; beliefs. Wesley was perhaps the clearest English proponent of Arminianism.

Prevenient grace was the theological underpinning of his belief that all persons were capable of being saved by faith in Christ. Wesley did not believe in the Calvinist understanding of predestination, that is, that some persons had been elected by God for salvation and others for damnation. He expressed his understanding of humanity&#x27;s relationship to God as utter dependence upon God&#x27;s grace. God was at work to spiritually enable all people to be capable of coming to faith.

By contrast, Whitefield inclined to Calvinism; in his first tour in America, he embraced the views of the New England School of Calvinism. Whitefield opposed Wesley&#x27;s advocacy of Arminianism, though the two maintained a strained friendship. When in 1739 Wesley preached a sermon on &quot;Freedom of Grace&quot;, attacking the Calvinistic understanding of predestination as blasphemous, as it represented &quot;God as worse than the devil,&quot; Whitefield asked him not to repeat or publish the discourse, as he did not want a dispute. Wesley published his sermon anyway. Whitefield was one of many who responded. The two men separated their practice in 1741. Wesley wrote that those who held to unlimited atonement did not desire separation, but &quot;those who held &#x27;particular redemption&#x27; would not hear of any accommodation.&quot;
Whitefield, Howell Harris (leader of the Welsh Methodist revival), John Cennick, and others, became the founders of Calvinistic Methodism. Whitefield and Wesley, however, were soon back on friendly terms, and their friendship remained unbroken although they travelled different paths. When someone asked Whitefield if he thought he would see Wesley in heaven, Whitefield replied, &quot;I fear not, for he will be so near the eternal throne and we at such a distance, we shall hardly get sight of him.&quot;

In 1770, the controversy broke out anew with violence and bitterness, as people&#x27;s view of God related to their views of men and their possibilities. Augustus Toplady, Daniel Rowland, Sir Richard Hill and others were engaged on one side, while Wesley and Fletcher stood on the other. Toplady was editor of &quot;The Gospel Magazine&quot;, which had articles covering the controversy.

In 1778, Wesley began the publication of &quot;The Arminian Magazine&quot;, not, he said, to convince Calvinists, but to preserve Methodists. He wanted to teach the truth that &quot;God willeth all men to be saved.&quot; A &quot;lasting peace&quot; could be secured in no other way.

Some have suggested that later in life, Wesley may have embraced the doctrine of universal salvation. This claim is supported by a letter Wesley wrote in 1787, in which he endorsed a work by Charles Bonnet that concluded in favour of universalism. However, this interpretation is disputed.

===Support for abolitionism===
Later in his ministry, Wesley was a keen abolitionist, speaking out and writing against the slave trade. Wesley denounced slavery as &quot;the sum of all villainies&quot; and detailed its abuses. He addressed the slave trade in a polemical tract, titled &quot;Thoughts Upon Slavery,&quot; in 1774. He wrote, &quot;Liberty is the right of every human creature, as soon as he breathes the vital air; and no human law can deprive him of that right which he derives from the law of nature&quot;. Wesley influenced George Whitefield to journey to the colonies, spurring the transatlantic debate on slavery. Wesley was a mentor to William Wilberforce, who was also influential in the abolition of slavery in the British Empire.

It is thanks to Wesley&#x27;s abolitionist message that a young African American, Richard Allen, converted to Christianity in 1777 and later founded, in 1816, the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), in the Methodist tradition.

===Support for women preachers===

Women had an active role in Wesley&#x27;s Methodism and were encouraged to lead classes. In 1761, he informally allowed Sarah Crosby, one of his converts and a class leader, to preach. On an occasion where over 200 people attended a class she was meant to teach, Crosby felt as though she could not fulfil her duties as a class leader given the large crowd and decided to preach instead. She wrote to Wesley to seek his advice and forgiveness. He let Crosby continue her preaching so long as she refrained from as many of the mannerisms of preaching as she could. Between 1761 and 1771, Wesley wrote detailed instructions to Crosby and others, with specifics on what styles of preaching they could use. For instance, in 1769, Wesley allowed Crosby to give exhortations.

In the summer of 1771, Mary Bosanquet wrote to John Wesley to defend her and Sarah Crosby&#x27;s work preaching and leading classes at her orphanage, Cross Hall. Bosanquet&#x27;s letter is considered to be the first full and true defence of women&#x27;s preaching in Methodism. Her argument was that women should be able to preach when they experienced an &#x27;extraordinary call&#x27; or when given permission from God. Wesley accepted Bosanquet&#x27;s argument and formally began to allow women to preach in Methodism in 1771. Methodist women, including preachers, continued to observe the ancient practice of Christian head covering.

===Interfaith relations and views===
Wesley assumed the superiority of Christianity vis-a-vis to Islam, based on his commitment to the biblical revelation as &quot;the book of God&quot;. His theological interpretation of Christianity was seeking its imperative rather than considering other Abrahamic and Eastern religions to be equal. He often regarded the lifestyles of Muslims as an &quot;ox goad&quot; to prick the collective Christian conscience. Although his &quot;Letter to a Roman Catholic&quot; (1749), a conciliatory appeal for understanding and shared Christian faith, is sometimes seen as an act of religious tolerance, Wesley remained deeply rooted in the anti-Catholicism characteristic of 18th-century England.

==Personal life and activities==
Wesley travelled widely, generally on horseback, preaching two or three times each day. Stephen Tomkins writes that &quot;[Wesley] rode 250,000 miles, gave away 30,000 pounds, ... and preached more than 40,000 sermons... &quot; He formed societies, opened chapels, examined and commissioned preachers, administered aid charities, prescribed for the sick, helped to pioneer the use of electric shock for the treatment of illness, and superintended orphanages and schools (including Kingswood School).

Wesley practised a vegetarian diet and in later life abstained from wine for health reasons. He wrote, &quot;thanks be to God, since the time I gave up flesh meals and wine I have been delivered from all physical ills&quot;. Wesley warned against the dangers of alcohol abuse in his famous sermon, &quot;The Use of Money,&quot; and in his letter to an alcoholic. In his sermon, &quot;On Public Diversions&quot;, Wesley says: &quot;You see the wine when it sparkles in the cup, and are going to drink of it. I tell you there is poison in it! and, therefore, beg you to throw it away&quot;. These statements against alcohol use largely concerned &quot;hard liquors and spirits&quot; rather than the low-alcohol beer, which was often safer to drink than the contaminated water of that time. Methodist churches became pioneers in the teetotal temperance movement of the 19th and 20th centuries, and later it became &quot;de rigueur&quot; in British Methodism.

He attended music concerts, and was especially an admirer of Charles Avison. After attending a performance in Bristol Cathedral in 1758, Wesley recorded in his journal: &quot;I went to the cathedral to hear Mr. Handel&#x27;s &quot;Messiah&quot;. I doubt if that congregation was ever so serious at a sermon as they were during this performance. In many places, especially several of the choruses, it exceeded my expectation.&quot;

He is described as &quot;rather under the medium height, well proportioned, strong, with a bright eye, a clear complexion, and a saintly, intellectual face&quot;. Though Wesley favoured celibacy rather than marital bond, he married very unhappily in 1751, at the age of 48, to a widow, Mary Vazeille, described as &quot;a well-to-do widow and mother of four children.&quot; The couple had no children. John Singleton writes: &quot;By 1758 she had left him—unable to cope, it is said, with the competition for his time and devotion presented by the ever-burgeoning Methodist movement. Molly, as she was known, was to return and leave him again on several occasions before their final separation.&quot; Wesley wryly reported in his journal, &quot;I did not forsake her, I did not dismiss her, I will not recall her.&quot;

In 1770, at the death of George Whitefield, Wesley wrote a memorial sermon which praised Whitefield&#x27;s admirable qualities and acknowledged the two men&#x27;s differences: &quot;There are many doctrines of a less essential nature ... In these we may think and let think; we may &#x27;agree to disagree.&#x27; But, meantime, let us hold fast the essentials...&quot; Wesley may have been the first to use &quot;agree to disagree&quot; in print—in the modern sense of tolerating differences—though he himself attributed the saying to Whitefield, and it had appeared in other senses previously.

Wesley was gravely ill during a visit to Lisburn in Ireland in June 1775. He stayed at the home of a leading Methodist, Henrietta Gayer, where he recovered.

==Death==
Wesley&#x27;s health declined sharply towards the end of his life and he ceased preaching. On 28 June 1790, less than a year before his death, he wrote:

This day I enter into my eighty-eighth year. For above eighty-six years, I found none of the infirmities of old age: my eyes did not wax dim, neither was my natural strength abated. But last August, I found almost a sudden change. My eyes were so dim that no glasses would help me. My strength likewise now quite forsook me and probably will not return in this world.

Wesley was cared for during his last months by Elizabeth Ritchie and his physician John Whitehead. He died on 2 March 1791, at the age of 87. As he lay dying, his friends gathered around him, Wesley grasped their hands and said repeatedly, &quot;Farewell, farewell.&quot; At the end, he said, &quot;The best of all is, God is with us&quot;, lifted his arms and raised his feeble voice again, repeating the words, &quot;The best of all is, God is with us.&quot; He was entombed at his chapel on City Road, London. Ritchie wrote an account of his death which was quoted from by Whitehead at his funeral.

Because of his charitable nature, he died poor, leaving as the result of his life&#x27;s work 135,000 members and 541 itinerant preachers under the name &quot;Methodist&quot;. It has been said that &quot;when John Wesley was carried to his grave, he left behind him a good library of books, a well-worn clergyman&#x27;s gown&quot; and the Methodist Church.

==Literary work==

Wesley wrote, edited or abridged some 400 publications. As well as theology he wrote about music, marriage, medicine, abolitionism and politics. Wesley was a logical thinker and expressed himself clearly, concisely and forcefully in writing. Between 1746 and 1760, Wesley compiled several volumes of written sermons, published as &quot;Sermons on Several Occasions&quot;; the first four volumes comprise forty-four sermons which are doctrinal in content. His &quot;Forty-Four Sermons&quot; and the &quot;Explanatory Notes Upon the New Testament&quot; (1755) are Methodist doctrinal standards. Wesley was a fluent, powerful and effective preacher; he usually preached spontaneously and briefly, though occasionally at great length.

In his &quot;Christian Library&quot; (1750), he writes about mystics such as Macarius of Egypt, Ephrem the Syrian, Madame Guyon, François Fénelon, Ignatius of Loyola, John of Ávila, Francis de Sales, Blaise Pascal, and Antoinette Bourignon. The work reflects the influence of Christian mysticism in Wesley&#x27;s ministry from the beginning to the end, although he ever rejected it after the failure in Georgia mission.

Wesley&#x27;s prose, &quot;Works&quot;, were first collected by himself (32 vols., Bristol, 1771–74, frequently reprinted in editions varying greatly in the number of volumes). His chief prose works are a standard publication in seven octavo volumes of the Methodist Book Concern, New York. The &quot;Poetical Works&quot; of John and Charles, ed. G. Osborn, appeared in 13 vols., London, 1868–72.

In addition to his &quot;Sermons&quot; and &quot;Notes&quot; are his &quot;Journals&quot; (originally published in 20 parts, London, 1740–89; new ed. by N. Curnock containing notes from unpublished diaries, 6 vols., vols. i–ii, London and New York, 1909–11); &quot;The Doctrine of Original Sin&quot; (Bristol, 1757; in reply to John Taylor of Norwich); &quot;An Earnest Appeal to Men of Reason and Religion&quot; (originally published in three parts; 2nd ed., Bristol, 1743), an elaborate defence of Methodism, describing the evils of the times in society and the church; and a &quot;Plain Account of Christian Perfection&quot; (1766).

Wesley&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Service&quot; was an adaptation of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; for use by American Methodists. In his Watchnight service, he made use of a pietist prayer now generally known as the Wesley Covenant Prayer, perhaps his most famous contribution to Christian liturgy. He was a noted hymn-writer, translator and compiler of a hymnal.

Wesley also wrote on physics and medicine, such as in &quot;The Desideratum&quot;, subtitled &quot;Electricity made Plain and Useful by a Lover of Mankind and of Common Sense&quot; (1759). and &quot;Primitive Physic, Or, An Easy and Natural Method of Curing Most Diseases&quot;.

In spite of the proliferation of his literary output, Wesley was challenged for plagiarism, for borrowing heavily from an essay by Samuel Johnson, published in March 1775. Initially denying the charge, Wesley later apologised officially.

==Commemoration and legacy==
===Theological influence===
Wesley continues to be the primary theological influence on Methodists and Methodist-heritage groups the world over; the Methodist movement numbers 75 million adherents in more than 130 countries. Wesleyan teachings also serve as a basis for the Holiness movement, which includes denominations like Free Methodist Church, the Church of the Nazarene, the Salvation Army, and several smaller groups, and from which Pentecostalism and parts of the Charismatic movement are offshoots. Wesley&#x27;s call to personal and social holiness continues to challenge Christians who attempt to discern what it means to participate in the Kingdom of God.

===Memory and commemorations===
He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 2 March with his brother Charles. The Wesley brothers are honoured with a Lesser Feast on 3 March in the Calendar of Saints of the Episcopal Church, and on 24 May (Aldersgate Day, with a Lesser Festival) in the Church of England&#x27;s Calendar.

In 2002, Wesley was listed at number 50 on the BBC&#x27;s list of the 100 Greatest Britons, drawn from a poll of the British public.

In his early ministry years, Wesley was barred from preaching in many parish churches and the Methodists were persecuted; he later became widely respected, and by the end of his life, was described as &quot;the best-loved man in England&quot;.

===Memorial sites===
Wesley&#x27;s house and chapel, which he built in 1778 on City Road in London, are still intact today and the chapel has a thriving congregation with regular services as well as the Museum of Methodism in the crypt.

Numerous schools, colleges, hospitals and other institutions are named after Wesley; additionally, many are named after Methodism. In 1831, Wesleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, was the first institution of higher education in the United States to be named after Wesley. The now secular institution was founded as an all-male Methodist college.

A replica of the rectory where Wesley lived as a boy was built in the 1990s at Lake Junaluska, North Carolina. This was an addition to a group of buildings built starting in the 1950s for the World Methodist Council, including a museum which housed letters written by Wesley and a pulpit Wesley used. The museum was already having difficulty staying open, and the COVID-19 pandemic finally made closing the museum necessary. Its contents went to Bridwell Library of Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas.

===Film===
In 1954, the Radio and Film Commission of the British Methodist Church, in co-operation with J. Arthur Rank, produced the film &quot;John Wesley&quot;. This was a live-action re-telling of the story of the life of Wesley, with Leonard Sachs in the title role.

In 2009, a more ambitious feature film, &quot;Wesley&quot;, was released by Foundery Pictures, starring Burgess Jenkins as Wesley. The film was directed by the award-winning filmmaker John Jackman.

===Musical theatre===
In 1976 the musical &quot;Ride! Ride!&quot;, composed by Penelope Thwaites AM and written by Alan Thornhill, premiered at the Westminster Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. The piece is based on the true story of eighteen-year-old Martha Thompson&#x27;s incarceration in Bedlam, an incident in Wesley&#x27;s life. The premier ran for 76 performances. Since then it has had more than 40 productions, both amateur and professional, including a 1999 concert version, issued on the Somm record label, with Keith Michell as Wesley.

<text>X10 is a protocol for communication among electronic devices used for home automation (&quot;domotics&quot;). It primarily uses power line wiring for signaling and control, where the signals involve brief radio frequency bursts representing digital information. A wireless radio-based protocol transport is also defined.

X10 was developed in 1975 by Pico Electronics of Glenrothes, Scotland, in order to allow remote control of home devices and appliances. It was the first general purpose home automation network technology and remains the most widely available.

Although a number of higher-bandwidth alternatives exist, X10 remains popular in the home environment with millions of units in use worldwide, and inexpensive availability of new components.

== History ==
In 1970, a group of engineers started a company in Glenrothes, Scotland called Pico Electronics. The company developed the first single chip calculator. When calculator integrated circuit prices started to fall, Pico refocused on commercial products rather than plain ICs.

In 1974, the Pico engineers jointly developed an LP record turntable, the ADC Accutrac 4000, with Birmingham Sound Reproducers, at the time the largest manufacturer of record changers in the world. It could be programmed to play selected tracks, and could be operated by a remote control using ultrasound signals, which sparked the idea of remote control for lights and appliances. By 1975, the X10 project was conceived, so named because it was the tenth project. In 1978, X10 products started to appear in RadioShack and Sears stores. Together with BSR a partnership was formed, with the name X10 Ltd. At that time the system consisted of a 16 channel command console, a lamp module, and an appliance module. Soon after came the wall switch module and the first X10 timer.

In the 1980s, the CP-290 computer interface was released. Software for the interface runs on the Commodore 64, Apple II, classic Mac OS, MS-DOS, and Microsoft Windows.

In 1985, BSR went out of business, and X10 (USA) Inc. was formed. In the early 1990s, the consumer market was divided into two main categories, the ultra-high-end with a budget at US$100,000 and the mass market with budgets at US$2,000 to US$35,000. CEBus (1984) and LonWorks (1991) were attempts to improve reliability and replace X10.

== Brands ==

X10 components have been sold under a variety of brand names:

* X10 Powerhouse
* X10 Pro
* X10 Activehome
* Radio Shack Plug &#x27;n Power
* Leviton Central Control System (CCS)
* Leviton Decora Electronic Controls
* Sears Home Control System

* RCA Home Control
* GE Homeminder
* Advanced Control Technologies (ACT)

Many of these vendors have since exited this business.

== Power line carrier control overview ==
Household electrical wiring which powers lights and appliances is used to send digital data between X10 devices. This data is encoded onto a 120 kHz carrier which is transmitted as bursts during the relatively quiet zero crossings of the 50 or 60 Hz AC alternating current waveform. One bit is transmitted at each zero crossing.

The digital data consists of an address and a command sent from a controller to a controlled device. More advanced controllers can also query equally advanced devices to respond with their status. This status may be as simple as &quot;off&quot; or &quot;on&quot;, or the current dimming level, or even the temperature or other sensor reading. Devices usually plug into the wall where a lamp, television, or other household appliance plugs in; however some built-in controllers are also available for wall switches and ceiling fixtures.

The relatively high-frequency carrier wave carrying the signal cannot pass through a power transformer or across the phases of a multiphase system. For split phase systems, the signal can be passively coupled from leg-to-leg using a passive capacitor, but for three phase systems or where the capacitor provides insufficient coupling, an active X10 repeater can be used. To allow signals to be coupled across phases and still match each phase&#x27;s zero crossing point, each bit is transmitted three times in each half cycle, offset by 1/6 cycle.

It may also be desirable to block X10 signals from leaving the local area so, for example, the X10 controls in one house do not interfere with the X10 controls in a neighboring house. In this situation, inductive filters can be used to attenuate the X10 signals coming into or going out of the local area.

=== Protocol ===
Whether using power line or radio communications, packets transmitted using the X10 control protocol consist of a four bit &quot;house code&quot; followed by one or more four bit &quot;unit codes&quot;, finally followed by a four bit command. For the convenience of users configuring a system, the four bit house code is selected as a letter from A through P while the four bit unit code is a number 1 through 16.

When the system is installed, each controlled device is configured to respond to one of the 256 possible addresses (16 house codes × 16 unit codes); each device reacts to commands specifically addressed to it, or possibly to several broadcast commands.

The protocol may transmit a message that says &quot;select code A3&quot;, followed by &quot;turn on&quot;, which commands unit &quot;A3&quot; to turn on its device. Several units can be addressed before giving the command, allowing a command to affect several units simultaneously. For example, &quot;select A3&quot;, &quot;select A15&quot;, &quot;select A4&quot;, and finally, &quot;turn on&quot;, causes units A3, A4, and A15 to all turn on.

Note that there is no restriction that prevents using more than one house code within a single house. The &quot;all lights on&quot; command and &quot;all units off&quot; commands will only affect a single house code, so an installation using multiple house codes effectively has the devices divided into separate zones.

==== One-way vs two-way ====
Inexpensive X10 devices only receive commands and do not acknowledge their status to the rest of the network. Two-way controller devices allow for a more robust network but cost two to four times more and require two-way X10 devices.

==== List of X10 commands ====
==== List of X10 house and unit code encodings ====
Note that the binary values for the house and unit codes correspond, but they are not a straight binary sequence. A unit code is followed by one additional &quot;0&quot; bit to distinguish from a command code (detailed above).

=== Physical layer details ===
In the 60 Hz AC current flow, each bit transmitted requires two zero crossings. A &quot;1&quot; bit is represented by an active zero crossing followed by an inactive zero crossing. A &quot;0&quot; bit is represented by an inactive zero crossing followed by an active zero crossing. An active zero crossing is represented by a 1 millisecond burst of 120 kHz at the zero crossing point (nominally 0°, but within 200 microseconds of the zero crossing point). An inactive zero crossing will not have a pulse of 120 kHz signal.

In order to provide a predictable start point, every data frame transmitted always begins with a &quot;start code&quot; of three active zero crossings followed by an inactive crossing. Since all data bits are sent as one active and one inactive (or one inactive and one active) zero crossing, the start code, possessing three active crossings in a row, can be uniquely detected. Many X10 protocol charts represent this start code as &quot;1110&quot;, but it is important to realize that is in terms of zero crossings, &quot;not&quot; data bits.

Immediately after the start code, a 4-bit &quot;house code&quot; (normally represented by the letters A to P on interface units) appears, and after the house code comes a 5-bit &quot;function code&quot;. Function codes may specify a unit number code (1–16) or a command code. The unit number or command code occupies the first 4 of the 5 bits. The final bit is a 0 for a unit code and a 1 for a command code. Multiple unit codes may be transmitted in sequence before a command code is finally sent. The command will be applied to all unit codes sent. It is also possible to send a message with no unit codes, just a house code and a command code. This will apply to the command to the last group of units codes previously sent.

One start code, one house code, and one function code is known as an X10 frame and represent the minimum components of a valid X10 data packet.

Each frame is sent twice in succession to make sure the receivers understand it over any power line noise for purposes of redundancy, reliability, and to accommodate line repeaters. After allowing for retransmission, line control, etc., data rates are around 20 bit/s, making X10 data transmission so slow that the technology is confined to turning devices on and off or other very simple operations.

Whenever the data changes from one address to another address, from an address to a command, or from one command to another command, the data frames must be separated by at least 6 clear zero crossings (or &quot;000000&quot;). The sequence of six zeros resets the device decoder hardware.

Later developments (1997) of hardware are improvements of the native X10 hardware. In Europe (2001) for the 230 VAC 50 Hz market. All improved products use the same X10 protocol and are compatible.

=== RF protocol ===
To allow for wireless keypads, remote switches, motion sensors, et cetera, an RF protocol is also defined. X10 wireless devices send data packets that are nearly identical to the NEC IR protocol used by many IR remotes, and a radio receiver then provides a bridge which translates these radio packets to ordinary X10 power line control packets. The wireless protocol operates at a frequency of 310 MHz in the U.S. and 433.92 MHz in European systems.

The devices available using the radio protocol include: 

* Keypad controllers, for example the X10 Palm Pad HR12A (&quot;clickers&quot;)
* Keychain controllers that can control one to four X10 devices, such as the KR19A. 
* Burglar alarm modules that can transmit sensor data
* Passive infrared switches to control lighting and X-10 chimes
* Non-passive information bursts

== Hardware support ==

=== Device modules ===
Depending on the load that is to be controlled, different modules must be used. For incandescent lamp loads, a &quot;lamp module&quot; or &quot;wall switch&quot; module can be used. These modules switch the power using a TRIAC solid state switch and are also capable of dimming the lamp load. Lamp modules are almost silent in operation, and generally rated to control loads ranging from approximately 60 to 500 watts.

For loads other than incandescent lamps, such as fluorescent lamps, high-intensity discharge lamps, and electrical home appliances, the triac-based electronic switching in the lamp module is unsuitable and an &quot;appliance module&quot; must be used instead. These modules switch the power using an impulse relay. In the U.S., these modules are generally rated to control loads up to 15 amperes (1800 watts at 120 V).

Many device modules offer a feature called &quot;local control&quot;. If the module is switched off, operating the power switch on the lamp or appliance will cause the module to turn on. In this way, a lamp can still be lit or a coffee pot turned on without the need to use an X10 controller. Wall switch modules may not offer this feature. As a result, older Appliance modules may fail to work with, for example, a very low load such as a 5W LED table lamp.

Some wall switch modules offer a feature called &quot;local dimming&quot;. Ordinarily, the local push button of a wall switch module simply offers on/off control with no possibility of locally dimming the controlled lamp. If local dimming is offered, holding down the push button will cause the lamp to cycle through its brightness range.

Higher end modules have more advanced features such as programmable on levels, customizable fade rates, the ability to transmit commands when used (referred to as 2-way devices), and &quot;scene&quot; support.

There are sensor modules that sense and report temperature, light, infrared, motion, or contact openings and closures. Device modules include thermostats, audible alarms and controllers for low voltage switches.

=== Controllers ===

X10 controllers range from extremely simple to very sophisticated.

The simplest controllers are arranged to control four X10 devices at four sequential addresses (1–4 or 5–8). The controllers typically contain the following buttons:
* Unit 1 on/off
* Unit 2 on/off
* Unit 3 on/off
* Unit 4 on/off
* Brighten/dim (last selected unit)
* All lights on/all units off
More sophisticated controllers can control more units and/or incorporate timers that perform preprogrammed functions at specific times each day. Units are also available that use passive infrared motion detectors or photocells to turn lights on and off based on external conditions.

Finally, there are very sophisticated units are available that can be fully programmed and/or controlled with a piece of software called Active Home, such as the CM11A serial interface. These systems can execute many different timed events, respond to external sensors, and execute, with the press of a single button, an entire &quot;scene&quot;, turning lights on, establishing brightness levels, and so on. Control programs are available for computers running Microsoft Windows, Apple&#x27;s Macintosh, Linux and FreeBSD operating systems.

Burglar alarm systems are also available. These systems contain door/window sensors, as well as motion sensors that use a coded radio frequency (RF) signal to identify when they are tripped or just to routinely check-in and give a heart-beat signal to show that the system is still active. Users can arm and disarm their system via several different remote controls that also use a coded RF signal to ensure security. When an alarm is triggered the console will make an outbound telephone call with a recorded message. The console will also use X10 protocols to flash lights when an alarm has been triggered while the security console sounds an external siren. Using X10 protocols, signals will also be sent to remote sirens for additional security.

=== Bridges ===
There are bridges to translate X10 to other home automation standards (e.g., KNX). ioBridge can be used to translate the X10 protocol to a web service API via the X10 PSC04 Powerline Interface Module. The magDomus home controller from magnocomp allows interconnection and inter-operation between most home automation technologies.

Thermostat

With X10 being an open standard, companies such as RCS released an x10 controllable thermostat model TX15-B, which is controllable via a web interface or a computer running a X10 software such as HAL or HomeSeer. 

== Limitations ==
=== Compatibility ===
Solid-state switches used in X10 controls pass a very small leakage current. Compact fluorescent lamps may display nuisance blinking when switched off; CFL manufacturers recommend against controlling lamps with solid-state timers or remote controls.

Some X10 controllers with triac solid-state outputs may not work well with low power devices (below 50 watts) or devices like fluorescent bulbs due to the leakage current of the device. An appliance module, using a relay with metallic contacts may resolve this problem. Many older appliance units have a &#x27;local control&#x27; feature whereby the relay is intentionally bypassed with a high value resistor; the module can then sense the appliance&#x27;s own switch and turn on the relay when the local switch is operated. This sense current may be incompatible with LED or CFL lamps.

Not all devices can be used on a dimmer. Fluorescent lamps are not dimmable with incandescent lamp dimmers; certain models of compact fluorescent lamps are dimmable but cost more. Motorized appliances such as fans, etc. generally will not operate as expected on a dimmer.

=== Wiring and interfering sources ===
One problem with X10 is excessive attenuation of signals between the two live conductors in the 3-wire 120/240 volt system used in typical North American residential construction. Signals from a transmitter on one live conductor may not propagate through the high impedance of the distribution transformer winding to the other live conductor. Often, there&#x27;s simply no reliable path to allow the X10 signals to propagate from one transformer leg wire to the other; this failure may come and go as large 240 volt devices such as stoves or dryers are turned on and off. (When turned on, such devices provide a low-impedance bridge for the X10 signals between the two leg wires.) This problem can be permanently overcome by installing a capacitor between the leg wires as a path for the X10 signals; manufacturers commonly sell signal couplers that plug into 240 volt sockets that perform this function. More sophisticated installations install an active repeater device between the legs, while others combine signal amplifiers with a coupling device. A repeater is also needed for inter-phase communication in homes with three-phase electric power. In many countries outside North America, entire houses are typically wired from a single 240 volt single-phase wire, so this problem does not occur.

Television receivers or household wireless devices may cause spurious &quot;off&quot; or &quot;on&quot; signals. Noise filtering (as installed on computers as well as many modern appliances) may help keep external noise out of X10 signals, but noise filters not designed for X10 may also attenuate X10 signals traveling on the branch circuit to which the appliance is connected.

Certain types of power supplies used in modern electronic equipment, such as computers, television receivers and satellite receivers, attenuate passing X10 signals by providing a low impedance path to high frequency signals. Typically, the capacitors used on the inputs to these power supplies short the X10 signal from line to neutral, suppressing any hope of X10 control on the circuit near that device. Filters are available that will block the X10 signals from ever reaching such devices; plugging offending devices into such filters can cure mysterious X10 intermittent failures.

Having a backup power supply or standby power supply such as used with computers or other electronic devices can totally kill that leg in a household installation because of the filtering used in the power supply.

=== Commands getting lost ===
X10 signals can only be transmitted one command at a time, first by addressing the device to control, and then sending an operation for that device to perform. If two X10 signals are transmitted at the same time they may collide or interleave, leading to commands that either cannot be decoded or that trigger incorrect operations. The CM15A and RR501 Transceiver can avoid these signal collisions that can sometimes occur with other models.

=== Lack of speed ===
The X10 protocol is slow. It takes roughly three quarters of a second to transmit a device address and a command. While generally not noticeable when using a tabletop controller, it becomes a noticeable problem when using 2-way switches or when utilizing some sort of computerized controller. The apparent delay can be lessened somewhat by using slower device dim rates. With more advanced modules another option is to use group control (lighting scene) extended commands. These allow adjusting several modules at once by a single command.

=== Limited functionality ===
X10 protocol does support more advanced control over the dimming speed, direct dim level setting and group control (scene settings). This is done via extended message set, which is an official part of X10 standard. However support for all extended messages is not mandatory, and many cheaper modules implement only the basic message set. These require adjusting each lighting circuit one after the other, which can be visually unappealing and also very slow.

=== Interference and lack of encryption ===
The standard X10 power line and RF protocols lack support for encryption, and can only address 256 devices. Unfiltered power line signals from close neighbors using the same X10 device addresses may interfere with each other. Interfering RF wireless signals may similarly be received, with it being easy for anyone nearby with an X10 RF remote to wittingly or unwittingly cause mayhem if an RF to power line device is being used on a premises.

<text>An electrical cable is an assembly of one or more wires running side by side or bundled, which is used as an electrical conductor to carry electric current. 

Electrical cables are used to connect two or more devices, enabling the transfer of electrical signals, power, or both from one device to the other. Physically, an electrical cable is an assembly consisting of one or more conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual coverings, assembly protection and protective covering.

One or more electrical cables and their corresponding connectors may be formed into a cable assembly, which is not necessarily suitable for connecting two devices but can be a partial product (e.g. to be soldered onto a printed circuit board with a connector mounted to the housing). Cable assemblies can also take the form of a cable tree or cable harness, used to connect many terminals together.

== Uses ==


Electrical cables are used to connect two or more devices, enabling the transfer of electrical signals or power from one device to the other. Long-distance communication takes place over undersea communication cables. Power cables are used for bulk transmission of alternating and direct current power, especially using high-voltage cable. Electrical cables are extensively used in building wiring for lighting, power and control circuits permanently installed in buildings. Since all the circuit conductors required can be installed in a cable at one time, installation labor is saved compared to certain other wiring methods.

Physically, an electrical cable is an assembly consisting of one or more conductors with their own insulations and optional screens, individual coverings, assembly protection and protective coverings. Electrical cables may be made more flexible by stranding the wires. In this process, smaller individual wires are twisted or braided together to produce larger wires that are more flexible than solid wires of similar size. Bunching small wires before concentric stranding adds the most flexibility. Copper wires in a cable may be bare, or they may be plated with a thin layer of another metal, most often tin but sometimes gold, silver or some other material. Tin, gold, and silver are much less prone to oxidation than copper, which may lengthen wire life, and makes soldering easier. Tinning is also used to provide lubrication between strands. Tinning was used to help removal of rubber insulation. Tight lays during stranding makes the cable extensible (CBA – as in telephone handset cords).

In the 19th century and early 20th century, electrical cable was often insulated using cloth, rubber or paper. Plastic materials are generally used today, except for high-reliability power cables. The first thermoplastic used was gutta-percha (a natural latex) which was found useful for underwater cables in the 19th century. The first, and still very common, man-made plastic used for cable insulation was polyethylene. This was invented in 1930, but not available outside military use until after World War 2 during which a telegraph cable using it was laid across the English Channel to support troops following D-Day. 

Cables can be securely fastened and organized, such as by using trunking, cable trays, cable ties or cable lacing. Continuous-flex or flexible cables used in moving applications within cable carriers can be secured using strain relief devices or cable ties.

== Characteristics ==

Any current-carrying conductor, including a cable, radiates an electromagnetic field. Likewise, any conductor or cable will pick up energy from any existing electromagnetic field around it. These effects are often undesirable, in the first case amounting to unwanted transmission of energy which may adversely affect nearby equipment or other parts of the same piece of equipment; and in the second case, unwanted pickup of noise which may mask the desired signal being carried by the cable, or, if the cable is carrying power supply or control voltages, pollute them to such an extent as to cause equipment malfunction.

The first solution to these problems is to keep cable lengths in buildings short since pick up and transmission are essentially proportional to the length of the cable. The second solution is to route cables away from trouble. Beyond this, there are particular cable designs that minimize electromagnetic pickup and transmission. Three of the principal design techniques are shielding, coaxial geometry, and twisted-pair geometry.

Shielding makes use of the electrical principle of the Faraday cage. The cable is encased for its entire length in foil or wire mesh. All wires running inside this shielding layer will be to a large extent decoupled from external &quot;electrical&quot; fields, particularly if the shield is connected to a point of constant voltage, such as earth or ground. Simple shielding of this type is not greatly effective against low-frequency &quot;magnetic&quot; fields, however - such as magnetic &quot;hum&quot; from a nearby power transformer. A grounded shield on cables operating at 2.5 kV or more gathers leakage current and capacitive current, protecting people from electric shock and equalizing stress on the cable insulation.

Coaxial design helps to further reduce low-frequency magnetic transmission and pickup. In this design the foil or mesh shield has a circular cross section and the inner conductor is exactly at its center. This causes the voltages induced by a magnetic field between the shield and the core conductor to consist of two nearly equal magnitudes which cancel each other.

A twisted pair has two wires of a cable twisted around each other. This can be demonstrated by putting one end of a pair of wires in a hand drill and turning while maintaining moderate tension on the line. Where the interfering signal has a wavelength that is long compared to the pitch of the twisted pair, alternate lengths of wires develop opposing voltages, tending to cancel the effect of the interference.

== Fire protection ==

Electrical cable jacket material is usually constructed of flexible plastic which will burn. The fire hazard of grouped cables can be significant. Cables jacketing materials can be formulated to prevent fire spread . Alternately, fire spread amongst combustible cables can be prevented by the application of fire retardant coatings directly on the cable exterior, or the fire threat can be isolated by the installation of boxes constructed of noncombustible materials around the bulk cable installation.

== Types ==
*Coaxial cable – used for radio frequency signals, for example in cable television distribution systems.
*Direct-buried cable
*Flexible cables
*Filled cable
*Heliax cable
*Non-metallic sheathed cable (or nonmetallic building wire, NM, NM-B)
*Armored cable (or BX)
*Multicore cable (consist of more than one wire and is covered by cable jacket)
*Paired cable – Composed of two individually insulated conductors that are usually used in DC or low-frequency AC applications
*Portable cord – Flexible cable for AC power in portable applications
*Power cable – A cable used for transmission of power
*Ribbon cable – Useful when many wires are required. This type of cable can easily flex, and it is designed to handle low-level voltages.
*Shielded cable – Used for sensitive electronic circuits or to provide protection in high-voltage applications.
*Single cable (from time to time this name is used for wire)
*Structured cabling
*Submersible cable
*Twin and earth
*Twinax cable
*Twin-lead – This type of cable is a flat two-wire line. It is commonly called a 300 Ω line because the line has an impedance of 300 Ω. It is often used as a transmission line between an antenna and a receiver (e.g., TV and radio). These cables are stranded to lower skin effects.
*Twisted pair – Consists of two interwound insulated wires. It resembles a paired cable, except that the paired wires are twisted

CENELEC HD 361 is a ratified standard published by CENELEC, which relates to wire and cable marking type, whose goal is to harmonize cables. Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN, VDE) has released a similar standard (DIN VDE 0292).

<text>Harald &quot;Bluetooth&quot; Gormsson (; , died c. 985/86) was a king of Denmark and Norway.

He was the son of King Gorm the Old and of Thyra Dannebod. Harald ruled as king of Denmark from c. 958 – c. 986. Harald introduced Christianity to Denmark and consolidated his rule over most of Jutland and Zealand. Harald&#x27;s rule as king of Norway following the assassination of King Harald Greycloak of Norway was more tenuous, most likely lasting for no more than a few years in the 970s. Some sources say his son Sweyn Forkbeard forcibly deposed him from his Danish throne before his death.

== Name ==
Harald&#x27;s name is written as runic &quot;haraltr : kunukʀ&quot; (ᚼᛅᚱᛅᛚᛏᚱ ᛬ ᚴᚢᚾᚢᚴᛦ) in the Jelling stone inscription. In normalized Old Norse, this would correspond to &quot;Haraldr konungr&quot;, i.e. &quot;Harald king&quot;. The Latinized name as given in the medieval Danish chronicles is &quot;Haraldus Gormonis filius&quot; (Harald, Gorm&#x27;s son). The given name &quot;Haraldr&quot; (also &quot;Haralldr&quot;) is the equivalent of Old English &quot;Hereweald&quot;, Old High German &quot;Heriwald&quot;, from &quot;hari&quot; &quot;army&quot; and &quot;wald-&quot; &quot;rule&quot;. Harald&#x27;s name is also inscribed on the so-called Curmsun disc, rediscovered in 2014 (but part of a Viking hoard previously discovered in 1841 in the crypt of the Groß-Weckow village church in Pomerania, close to the Viking Age stronghold of Jomsborg), as &quot;+ARALD CVRMSVN + REX AD TANER + SCON + JVMN + CIV ALDIN&quot;, i.e. &quot;Harald Gormson, king of Danes, Scania, Jumne, [in] &quot;.

The first documented appearance of Harald&#x27;s nickname &quot;Bluetooth&quot; (as &quot;blatan&quot;; Old Norse &quot;*blátǫnn&quot;) is in the &quot;Chronicon Roskildense&quot; (written c. 1140), alongside the alternative nickname &quot;Clac Harald&quot;. &quot;Clac Harald&quot; appears to be a conflation of Harald Bluetooth with the legendary or semi-legendary Harald Klak, son of Halfdan. The byname is given as &quot;Blachtent&quot; and explicitly glossed as &quot;bluish or black tooth&quot; (&quot;dens lividus vel niger&quot;) in a chronicle of the late 12th century, &quot;Wilhelmi abbatis regum Danorum genealogia&quot;. is that Harald must have had a conspicuous bad tooth that appeared &quot;blue&quot; (i.e. &quot;black&quot;, as &quot;blár&quot; &quot;blue&quot; meant &quot;blue-black&quot;, or &quot;dark-coloured&quot;).
Another explanation, proposed by Scocozza (1997), is that he was called &quot;blue thane&quot; (or &quot;dark thane&quot;) in England (with Anglo-Saxon &quot;thegn&quot; corrupted to &quot;tan&quot; when the name came back into Old Norse).

==Reign==
During his reign, Harald oversaw the reconstruction of the Jelling runic stones, and numerous other public works. The most famous is fortifying the fortress of Aros (nowadays Aarhus) which was situated in a central position in his kingdom in the year 979. Some believe these projects were a way for him to consolidate economic and military control of his country and the main city. Ring forts were built in five strategic locations with Aarhus perfectly in the middle: Trelleborg on Zealand, Borrering in eastern Zealand (the inner construction of this fort is still yet to be established), Nonnebakken on Funen, Fyrkat in Himmerland (northern Jutland) and Aggersborg near Limfjord. All five fortresses had similar designs: &quot;perfectly circular with gates opening to the four corners of the earth, and a courtyard divided into four areas which held large houses set in a square pattern.&quot; A sixth &quot;Trelleborg&quot; of similar design, located at Borgeby, in Scania, has been dated to about 1000 and may have been built by King Harald and a second fort named Trelleborg is located near the modern town of Trelleborg in Scania in present-day Sweden, but is of older date and thus pre-dates the reign of Harald Bluetooth.

He constructed the oldest known bridge in southern Scandinavia, the wide and long Ravning Bridge at Ravning meadows.

While quiet prevailed throughout the interior, he turned his energies to foreign enterprises. He came to the help of Richard the Fearless of Normandy in 945 and 963, while his son conquered Samland, and after the assassination of King Harald Greycloak of Norway, managed to force the people of that country into temporary subjugation to himself.

The Norse sagas present Harald in a rather negative light. He was forced twice to submit to the renegade Swedish prince Styrbjörn the Strong of the Jomsvikings- first by giving Styrbjörn a fleet and his daughter Thyra, the second time by giving up himself as hostage, along with yet another fleet. When Styrbjörn brought this fleet to Uppsala to claim the throne of Sweden, Harald broke his oath and fled with his Danes to avoid facing the Swedish army at the Battle of Fýrisvellir.

=== Harald&#x27;s Rebellion ===

In the wake of Otto I&#x27;s death, Harald attacked Saxony in 973. Otto II counter-attacked Harald in 974, conquering Haithabu, Dannevirke and possibly large parts of Jutland. Harald regained some of the seized territory in 983 when Otto II was defeated by the Saracens.

As a consequence of Harald&#x27;s army having lost to the Germans at the Danevirke in 974, he no longer had control of Norway, and Germans settled back into the border area between Scandinavia and Germany. They were driven out of Denmark in 983 by an alliance of Obodrite soldiers and troops loyal to Harald, but soon after, Harald was killed fighting off a rebellion led by his son Sweyn. He is believed to have died in 986, although several accounts claim 985 as his year of death. According to Adam of Bremen he died in Jumne/Jomsborg from his wounds. His body was brought back to the Trinity Church in Roskilde where he was buried.

The Curmsun Disc, found in Groß-Weckow, Pomerania, (after 1945 Wiejkowo) is inscribed with &quot;ARALD CVRMSVN&quot; (Harald Gormson), calling him, in abbreviated Latin, &quot;king of Danes, Scania, Jomsborg, town of Aldinburg&quot;. Based on this, Swedish archaeologist Sven Rosborn has proposed that Harald is buried at the church there, close to Jomsborg, in what is now Poland.

From 1835 to 1977, it was wrongly believed that Harald ordered the death of the Haraldskær Woman, a bog body previously thought to be Gunnhild, Mother of Kings until radiocarbon dating proved otherwise.

The Hiddensee treasure, a large trove of gold objects, was found in 1873 on the German island of Hiddensee in the Baltic Sea. It is believed that these objects belonged to Harald&#x27;s family.

Harald introduced the first nationwide coinage in Denmark.

==Conversion to Christianity==

King Harald Bluetooth&#x27;s conversion to Christianity is a contested bit of history, not least because medieval writers such as Widukind of Corvey and Adam of Bremen give conflicting accounts of how it came about.

Widukind of Corvey, writing during the lives of King Harald and Otto I (ruled 962–973), claims that Harald was converted by a &quot;cleric by the name of Poppa&quot; who, when asked by Harald to prove his faith in Christ, carried a &quot;great weight&quot; of iron heated by a fire without being burned. According to 12th-century Danish historian Saxo Grammaticus in his work &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;, Poppo performed his miracle for Harald&#x27;s son Sweyn Forkbeard after Sweyn had second thoughts about his own baptism. Harald himself converted to Catholicism after a peace agreement with the Holy Roman Emperor (either Otto I or II).

Adam of Bremen, writing 100 years after King Harald&#x27;s death in &quot;History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen&quot;, finished in 1076, describes Harald being forcibly converted by Otto I, after a defeat in battle. However, Widukind does not mention such an event in his contemporary &quot;Res gestae saxonicae sive annalium libri tres&quot; or &quot;Deeds of the Saxons&quot;. Some 250 years after the event, the &quot;Heimskringla&quot; relates that Harald was converted with Earl Haakon, by Otto II (ruled 973 – 983).

A cleric named Poppa, perhaps the same one, also appears in Adam of Bremen&#x27;s history, but in connection with Eric of Sweden, who had supposedly conquered Denmark (the fact that Eric conquered Denmark during the realm of Sweyn Forkbeard is explained by Saxo as a punishment of Sweyn&#x27;s apostasy). The story of this otherwise unknown Poppo or Poppa&#x27;s miracle and baptism of Harald is also depicted on the gilded altar piece in the Church of Tamdrup in Denmark (see image at top of this article). The altar itself dates to about 1200. Adam of Bremen&#x27;s claim regarding Otto I and Harald appears to have been inspired by an attempt to manufacture a historical reason for the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen to claim jurisdiction over Denmark (and thus the rest of Scandinavia); in the 1070s, the Danish king was in Rome asking for Denmark to have its own arch-bishop, and Adam&#x27;s account of Harald&#x27;s supposed conversion (and baptism of both him and his &quot;little son&quot; Sweyn, with Otto serving as Sweyn&#x27;s godfather) is followed by the unambiguous claim that &quot;At that time Denmark on this side of the sea, which is called Jutland by the inhabitants, was divided into three dioceses and subjected to the bishopric of Hamburg.&quot;

As noted above, Harald&#x27;s father, Gorm the Old, had died in 958, and had been buried in a mound with many goods, after the pagan practice. The mound itself was from c. 500 BCE, but Harald had it built higher over his father&#x27;s grave, and added a second mound to the south. Mound-building was a newly revived custom in the 10th century, perceivably as an &quot;appeal to old traditions in the face of Christian customs spreading from Denmark&#x27;s southern neighbors, the Germans&quot;.

After his conversion, around the 960s, Harald had his father&#x27;s body reburied in the church next to the now empty mound. He had the Jelling stones erected to honour his parents. The biography of Harald Bluetooth is summed up by this runic inscription from the Jelling stones:

Harald undoubtedly professed Christianity at that time and contributed to its growth, but with limited success in Denmark and Norway.

==Marriages and children==

Spouses:
# Gunhild
# Thora (Tova) the daughter of Mistivir in 970. She raised the Sønder Vissing Runestone after her mother.
# Gyrid Olafsdottir
Children:
*Tyra of Denmark, married Styrbjörn the Strong.
*Sweyn Forkbeard. Born about 960. Usually given as the son of Harald and Gunhild, though it is said in some of the older sagas that he was an illegitimate son.
*Haakon. Born in 961(?).
*Gunhilde. She married Pallig, Jarl and Ealdorman of Devonshire. It is thought that they both died in the St. Brice&#x27;s Day massacre in November 1002.

==Bluetooth technology==

The Bluetooth wireless specification design was named after the king in 1997, based on an analogy that the technology would unite devices the way Harald Bluetooth united the tribes of Denmark into a single kingdom. The Bluetooth logo consists of a Younger Futhark bind rune for his initials, H (ᚼ) and B (ᛒ).

<text>Monetarism is a school of thought in monetary economics that emphasizes the role of policy-makers in controlling the amount of money in circulation. It gained prominence in the 1970s but was mostly abandoned as a direct guidance to monetary policy during the following decade because of the rise of inflation targeting through movements of the official interest rate.

The monetarist theory states that variations in the money supply have major influences on national output in the short run and on price levels over longer periods. Monetarists assert that the objectives of monetary policy are best met by targeting the growth rate of the money supply rather than by engaging in discretionary monetary policy. Monetarism is commonly associated with neoliberalism.

Monetarism is mainly associated with the work of Milton Friedman, who was an influential opponent of Keynesian economics, criticising Keynes&#x27;s theory of fighting economic downturns using fiscal policy (e.g. government spending). Friedman and Anna Schwartz wrote an influential book, &quot;A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960&quot;, and argued that inflation is &quot;always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon&quot;.

Although opposed to the existence of the Federal Reserve, Friedman advocated, given its existence, a central bank policy aimed at keeping the growth of the money supply at a rate commensurate with the growth in productivity and demand for goods. Money growth targeting was mostly abandoned by the central banks who tried it, however. Contrary to monetarist thinking, the relation between money growth and inflation proved to be far from tight. Instead, starting in the early 1990s, most major central banks turned to direct inflation targeting, relying on steering short-run interest rates as their main policy instrument. Afterwards, monetarism was subsumed into the new neoclassical synthesis which appeared in macroeconomics around 2000.

==Description==
Monetarism is an economic theory that focuses on the macroeconomic effects of the supply of money and central banking. Formulated by Milton Friedman, it argues that excessive expansion of the money supply is inherently inflationary, and that monetary authorities should focus solely on maintaining price stability.

Monetarist theory draws its roots from the quantity theory of money, a centuries-old economic theory which had been put forward by various economists, among them Irving Fisher and Alfred Marshall, before Friedman restated it in 1956.

===Monetary history of the United States===
Monetarists argued that central banks sometimes caused major unexpected fluctuations in the money supply. Friedman asserted that actively trying to stabilize demand through monetary policy changes can have negative unintended consequences. In part he based this view on the historical analysis of monetary policy, &quot;A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960&quot;, which he coauthored with Anna Schwartz in 1963. The book attributed inflation to excess money supply generated by a central bank. It attributed deflationary spirals to the reverse effect of a failure of a central bank to support the money supply during a liquidity crunch. In particular, the authors argued that the Great Depression of the 1930s was caused by a massive contraction of the money supply (they deemed it &quot;the Great Contraction&quot;), and not by the lack of investment that Keynes had argued. They also maintained that post-war inflation was caused by an over-expansion of the money supply. They made famous the assertion of monetarism that &quot;inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon.&quot;

===Fixed monetary rule===

Friedman proposed a fixed &quot;monetary rule&quot;, called Friedman&#x27;s k-percent rule, where the money supply would be automatically increased by a fixed percentage per year. The rate should equal the growth rate of real GDP, leaving the price level unchanged. For instance, if the economy is expected to grow at 2 percent in a given year, the Fed should allow the money supply to increase by 2 percent. Because discretionary monetary policy would be as likely to destabilise as to stabilise the economy, Friedman advocated that the Fed be bound to fixed rules in conducting its policy.

===Opposition to the gold standard===
Most monetarists oppose the gold standard. Friedman viewed a pure gold standard as impractical. For example, whereas one of the benefits of the gold standard is that the intrinsic limitations to the growth of the money supply by the use of gold would prevent inflation, if the growth of population or increase in trade outpaces the money supply, there would be no way to counteract deflation and reduced liquidity (and any attendant recession) except for the mining of more gold. But he also admitted that if a government was willing to surrender control over its monetary policy and not to interfere with economic activities, a gold-based economy would be possible.

==Rise==
Clark Warburton is credited with making the first solid empirical case for the monetarist interpretation of business fluctuations in a series of papers from 1945.p. 493 Within mainstream economics, the rise of monetarism started with Milton Friedman&#x27;s 1956 restatement of the quantity theory of money. Friedman argued that the demand for money could be described as depending on a small number of economic variables.

Thus, according to Friedman, when the money supply expanded, people would not simply wish to hold the extra money in idle money balances; i.e., if they were in equilibrium before the increase, they were already holding money balances to suit their requirements, and thus after the increase they would have money balances surplus to their requirements. These excess money balances would therefore be spent and hence aggregate demand would rise. Similarly, if the money supply were reduced people would want to replenish their holdings of money by reducing their spending. In this, Friedman challenged a simplification attributed to Keynes suggesting that &quot;money does not matter.&quot; Thus the word &#x27;monetarist&#x27; was coined.

The popularity of monetarism picked up in political circles when the prevailing view of neo-Keynesian economics seemed unable to explain the contradictory problems of rising unemployment and inflation in response to the Nixon shock in 1971 and the oil shocks of 1973. On one hand, higher unemployment seemed to call for reflation, but on the other hand rising inflation seemed to call for disinflation. The social-democratic post-war consensus that had prevailed in first world countries was thus called into question by the rising neoliberal political forces.

=== Monetarism in the US and the UK ===

In 1979, United States President Jimmy Carter appointed as Federal Reserve Chief Paul Volcker, who made fighting inflation his primary objective, and who restricted the money supply (in accordance with the Friedman rule) to tame inflation in the economy. The result was a major rise in interest rates, not only in the United States; but worldwide. The &quot;Volcker shock&quot; continued from 1979 to the summer of 1982, decreasing inflation and increasing unemployment.

In May 1979, Margaret Thatcher, Leader of the Conservative Party in the United Kingdom, won the general election, defeating the sitting Labour Government led by James Callaghan. By that time, the UK had endured several years of severe inflation, which was rarely below the 10% mark and stood at 10.3% by the time of the election. Thatcher implemented monetarism as the weapon in her battle against inflation, and succeeded at reducing it to 4.6% by 1983. However, unemployment in the United Kingdom increased from 5.7% in 1979 to 12.2% in 1983, reaching 13.0% in 1982; starting with the first quarter of 1980, the UK economy contracted in terms of real gross domestic product for six straight quarters.

==Decline==

Monetarist ascendancy was brief, however. The period when major central banks focused on targeting the growth of money supply, reflecting monetarist theory, lasted only for a few years, in the US from 1979 to 1982. 

The money supply is useful as a policy target only if the relationship between money and nominal GDP, and therefore inflation, is stable and predictable. This implies that the velocity of money must be predictable. In the 1970s velocity had seemed to increase at a fairly constant rate, but in the 1980s and 1990s velocity became highly unstable, experiencing unpredictable periods of increases and declines. Consequently, the stable correlation between the money supply and nominal GDP broke down, and the usefulness of the monetarist approach came into question. Many economists who had been convinced by monetarism in the 1970s abandoned the approach after this experience. 

The changing velocity originated in shifts in the demand for money and created serious problems for the central banks. This provoked a thorough rethinking of monetary policy. In the early 1990s central banks started focusing on targeting inflation directly using the short-run interest rate as their central policy variable, abandoning earlier emphasis on money growth. The new strategy proved successful, and today most major central banks follow a flexible inflation targeting. 

==Measurement Issues on the Stability of Money Demand==

While monetarism&#x27;s influence on policy diminished in the 1980s, subsequent research suggests that the apparent instability in money demand functions may have stemmed from measurement issues rather than a fundamental breakdown in the money-income relationship. Barnett and others argued that simple-sum monetary aggregates, which weight all monetary components equally regardless of their liquidity characteristics, introduce significant measurement error that obscures stable underlying relationships.

Studies using theoretically-grounded Divisia monetary aggregates, which weight monetary components based on their &quot;monetary services&quot; or liquidity properties, have found considerably more stable money demand relationships. For instance, Belongia and Ireland demonstrated that money demand equations using Divisia measures remain stable even through periods of financial innovation and policy regime changes that destabilized traditional simple-sum specifications.

This finding has important implications for monetary policy frameworks. The breakdown in simple-sum money demand relationships was a key factor in central banks abandoning monetary targeting in favor of interest rate rules. However, research using Divisia aggregates suggests that money could still serve as a useful policy indicator or intermediate target if properly measured.

The stability of Divisia money demand functions has been demonstrated across different time periods and countries. For example, Hendrickson found that replacing simple-sum with Divisia measures resolves apparent instabilities in U.S. money demand, while similar results have been documented for other economies. Chen and Valcarcel argued that the properly measured monetary quantities and their holding costs maintain a stable, long-term cointegration.

These findings suggest that the historical shift away from monetary aggregates in policy frameworks may have been premature and based on flawed measurement rather than a true breakdown in the relationship between money and economic activity. While most central banks continue to focus primarily on interest rates, the stability of properly-measured money demand functions indicates that monetary aggregates could potentially play a more prominent role in policy frameworks.

==Legacy==

Even though monetarism failed in practical policy, and the close attention to money growth which was at the heart of monetarist analysis is rejected by most economists today, some aspects of monetarism have found their way into modern mainstream economic thinking. Among them are the belief that controlling inflation should be a primary responsibility of the central bank. It is also widely recognized that monetary policy, as well as fiscal policy, can affect output in the short run. In this way, important monetarist thoughts have been subsumed into the new neoclassical synthesis or consensus view of macroeconomics that emerged in the 2000s.

<doc id="42424" wikidata="Q152010" url="?curid=42424" title="Treblinka extermination camp">
<text>Treblinka () was the second-deadliest extermination camp to be built and operated by Nazi Germany in occupied Poland during World War II. It was in a forest north-east of Warsaw, south of the village of Treblinka in what is now the Masovian Voivodeship. The camp operated between 23 July 1942 and 19 October 1943 as part of Operation Reinhard, the deadliest phase of the Final Solution. During this time, it is estimated that between 700,000 and 900,000 Jews were murdered in its gas chambers, along with 2,000 Romani people. More Jews were murdered at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp apart from Auschwitz-Birkenau.

Managed by the German SS with assistance from Trawniki guards – recruited from among Soviet POWs to serve with the Germans – the camp consisted of two separate units. Treblinka I was a forced-labour camp (&quot;Arbeitslager&quot;) whose prisoners worked in the gravel pit or irrigation area and in the forest, where they cut wood to fuel the cremation pits. Between 1941 and 1944, more than half of its 20,000 inmates were murdered via shootings, hunger, disease and mistreatment.

The second camp, Treblinka II, was an extermination camp (&quot;Vernichtungslager&quot;), referred to euphemistically as the &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Treblinka&quot; by the Nazis. A small number of Jewish men who were not murdered immediately upon arrival became members of its &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; whose jobs included being forced to bury the victims&#x27; bodies in mass graves. These bodies were exhumed in 1943 and cremated on large open-air pyres along with the bodies of new victims. Gassing operations at Treblinka II ended in October 1943 following a revolt by the prisoners in early August. Several Trawniki guards were killed and 200 prisoners escaped from the camp; almost a hundred survived the subsequent pursuit. The camp was dismantled in late 1943. A farmhouse for a watchman was built on the site and the ground ploughed over in an attempt to hide the evidence of genocide.

In the postwar Polish People&#x27;s Republic, the government bought most of the land where the camp had stood, and built a large stone memorial there between 1959 and 1962. In 1964, Treblinka was declared a national monument of Jewish martyrdom in a ceremony at the site of the former gas chambers. In the same year, the first German trials were held regarding the crimes committed at Treblinka by former SS members. After the end of communism in Poland in 1989, the number of visitors coming to Treblinka from abroad increased. An exhibition centre at the camp opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum.

==Background==
Following the invasion of Poland in 1939, most of the 3.5 million Polish Jews were rounded up and confined to newly established ghettos by the Nazis. The system was intended to isolate the Jews from the outside world in order to facilitate their exploitation and abuse. The supply of food was inadequate, living conditions were cramped and unsanitary, and Jews had no way to earn money. Malnutrition and lack of medicine led to soaring mortality rates. In 1941, the initial victories of the Wehrmacht over the Soviet Union inspired plans for the German colonisation of occupied Poland, including all territory within the new district of General Government. At the Wannsee Conference held near Berlin on 20 January 1942, new plans were outlined for the genocide of Jews, known as the &quot;Final Solution&quot; to the Jewish Question. The extermination programme was codenamed Operation Reinhard. and was separate from the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; mass-murder operations in Eastern Europe, in which half a million Jews had already been murdered.

Treblinka was one of three secret extermination camps set up for Operation Reinhard; the other two were Bełżec and Sobibór. All three were equipped with gas chambers disguised as shower rooms, for the murder of entire transports of people. The method was established following a pilot project of mobile extermination conducted at Soldau and at Chełmno extermination camp that began operating in 1941 and used gas vans. Chełmno (German: &quot;Kulmhof&quot;) was a testing ground for the establishment of faster methods of murdering and incinerating bodies. It was not a part of Reinhard, which was marked by the construction of stationary facilities for mass murder. Treblinka was the third extermination camp of Operation Reinhard to be built, following Bełżec and Sobibór, and incorporated lessons learned from their construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arad-1984/pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Alongside the Reinhard camps, mass-murder facilities using Zyklon B were developed at the Majdanek concentration camp in March 1942, and at Auschwitz II-Birkenau between March and June.

Nazi plans to murder Polish Jews from across the General Government during &quot;Aktion Reinhard&quot; were overseen in occupied Poland by Odilo Globocnik, a deputy of Heinrich Himmler, head of the SS, in Berlin. The Operation Reinhard camps reported directly to Himmler. The staff of Operation Reinhard, most of whom had been involved in the Action T4 &quot;involuntary euthanasia&quot; programme, used T4 as a framework for the construction of new facilities. Most of the Jews who were murdered in the Reinhard camps came from ghettos.
The Operation Reinhard camps reported directly to Himmler, and not to the concentration camps inspector Richard Glücks.

===Location===
The two parallel camps of Treblinka were built northeast of Warsaw. Before World War II, it was the location of a gravel mining enterprise for the production of concrete, connected to most of the major cities in central Poland by the Małkinia–Sokołów Podlaski railway junction and the Treblinka village station. The mine was owned and operated by the Polish industrialist Marian Łopuszyński, who added the new railway track to the existing line. When the German SS took over Treblinka I, the quarry was already equipped with heavy machinery that was ready to use. Treblinka was well-connected but isolated enough, halfway between some of the largest Jewish ghettos in Nazi-occupied Europe, including the Warsaw Ghetto and the Białystok Ghetto, the capital of the newly formed Bialystok District. The Warsaw Ghetto had 500,000 Jewish inmates, and the Białystok Ghetto had about 60,000.

Treblinka was divided into two separate camps apart. Two engineering firms, the Schönbronn Company of Leipzig and the Warsaw branch of Schmidt–Münstermann, oversaw the construction of both camps. Between 1942 and 1943, the extermination centre was further redeveloped with a crawler excavator. New gas chambers constructed of brick and cement mortar were freshly erected, and mass cremation pyres were also introduced. The perimeter was enlarged to provide a buffer zone, making it impossible to approach the camp from the outside. The number of trains caused panic among the residents of nearby settlements. They would likely have been killed if caught near the railway tracks.

===Treblinka I===

Opened on 1 September 1941 as a forced-labour camp (&quot;Arbeitslager&quot;), Treblinka I replaced an &quot;ad hoc&quot; company established in June 1941 by Sturmbannführer Ernst Gramss. A new barracks and barbed wire fencing high were erected in late 1941. To obtain the workforce for Treblinka I, civilians were sent to the camp &quot;en masse&quot; for real or imagined offences, and sentenced to hard labour by the Gestapo office in Sokołów, which was headed by Gramss. The average length of a sentence was six months, but many prisoners had their sentences extended indefinitely. Twenty thousand people passed through Treblinka I during its three-year existence. About half of them were murdered there via exhaustion, hunger and disease. Those who survived were released after serving their sentences; these were generally Poles from nearby villages.

At any given time, Treblinka I had a workforce of 1,000–2,000 prisoners, most of whom worked 12- to 14-hour shifts in the large quarry and later also harvested wood from the nearby forest as fuel for the open-air crematoria in Treblinka II. There were German, Czech and French Jews among them, as well as Poles captured in &quot;łapankas&quot;, farmers unable to deliver food requisitions, hostages trapped by chance, and people who attempted to harbour Jews outside the Jewish ghettos or who performed restricted actions without permits. Beginning in July 1942, Jews and non-Jews were separated. Women mainly worked in the sorting barracks, where they repaired and cleaned military clothing delivered by freight trains, while most of the men worked at the gravel mine. There were no work uniforms, and inmates who lost their own shoes were forced to go barefoot or scavenge them from dead prisoners. Water was rationed, and punishments were regularly delivered at roll-calls. From December 1943 the inmates were no longer carrying any specific sentences. The camp operated officially until 23 July 1944, when the imminent arrival of Soviet forces led to its abandonment.

During its entire operation, Treblinka I&#x27;s commandant was &quot;Sturmbannführer&quot; Theodor van Eupen. He ran the camp with several SS men and almost 100 &quot;Hiwi&quot; guards. The quarry, spread over an area of , supplied road construction material for German military use and was part of the strategic road-building programme in the war with the Soviet Union. It was equipped with a mechanical digger for shared use by both Treblinka I and II. Eupen worked closely with the SS and German police commanders in Warsaw during the deportation of Jews in early 1943 and had prisoners brought to him from the Warsaw Ghetto for the necessary replacements. According to Franciszek Ząbecki, the local station master, Eupen often murdered prisoners by &quot;taking shots at them, as if they were partridges&quot;. A widely feared overseer was &quot;Untersturmführer&quot; Franz Schwarz, who killed prisoners with a pickaxe or hammer.

===Treblinka II===

Treblinka II (officially the &quot;SS-Sonderkommando Treblinka&quot;) was divided into three parts: Camp 1 was the administrative compound where the guards lived, Camp 2 was the receiving area where incoming transports of prisoners were offloaded, and Camp 3 was the location of the gas chambers. All three parts were built by two groups of German Jews recently expelled from Berlin and Hanover and imprisoned at the Warsaw Ghetto (a total of 238 men from 17 to 35 years of age). &quot;Hauptsturmführer&quot; Richard Thomalla, the head of construction, brought in German Jews because they could speak German. Construction began on 10 April 1942, when Bełżec and Sobibór were already in operation. The entire death camp, which was either or in size (sources vary), was surrounded by two rows of barbed-wire fencing high. This fence was later woven with pine tree branches to obstruct the view of the camp from outside. More Jews were brought in from surrounding settlements to work on the new railway ramp within the Camp 2 receiving area, which was ready by June 1942.

The first section of Treblinka II (Camp 1) was the &quot;Wohnlager&quot; administrative and residential compound; it had a telephone line. The main road within the camp was paved and named &quot;Seidel Straße&quot; after &quot;Unterscharführer&quot; Kurt Seidel, the SS corporal who supervised its construction. A few side roads were lined with gravel. The main gate for road traffic was erected on the north side. Barracks were built with supplies delivered from Warsaw, Sokołów Podlaski, and Kosów Lacki. There were a kitchen, a bakery, and dining rooms; all were equipped with high-quality items taken from Jewish ghettos. The Germans and Ukrainians each had their own sleeping quarters, positioned at an angle for better control of all entrances. There were also two barracks behind an inner fence for the Jewish work commandos, known as &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot;. &quot;SS-Untersturmführer&quot; Kurt Franz set up a small zoo in the centre next to his horse stables, containing two foxes, two peacocks and a roe deer (introduced in 1943). Smaller rooms were built as laundry, tailors, and cobblers, and for woodworking and medical aid. Closest to the SS quarters were separate barracks for the Polish and Ukrainian women who served, cleaned, and worked in the kitchen.

The next section of Treblinka II (Camp 2, also called the lower camp or &quot;Auffanglager&quot;), was the receiving area where the railway unloading ramp extended from the Treblinka line into the camp. There was a long and narrow platform surrounded by barbed-wire fencing. A new building, erected on the platform, was disguised as a railway station complete with a wooden clock and fake rail terminal signs. SS-&quot;Scharführer&quot; Josef Hirtreiter, who worked on the unloading ramp was known for being especially cruel; he grabbed crying toddlers by their feet and smashed their heads against wagons. Behind a second fence, about from the track, there were two large barracks used for undressing, with a cashier&#x27;s booth where money and jewelry were collected, ostensibly for safekeeping. Jews who resisted were taken away or beaten to death by the guards. The area where the women and children were shorn of their hair was on the other side of the path from the men. All buildings in the lower camp, including the barber barracks, contained the piled up clothing and belongings of the prisoners. Behind the station building, further to the right, there was a Sorting Square where all baggage was first collected by the &quot;Lumpenkommando&quot;. It was flanked by a fake infirmary called &quot;Lazarett&quot;, with the Red Cross sign on it. It was a small barracks surrounded by barbed wire, where the sick, old, wounded and &quot;difficult&quot; prisoners were taken. Directly behind the &quot;Lazarett&quot; shack, there was an open excavation pit seven metres (23 ft) deep. These prisoners were led to the edge of the pit and shot one at a time by &quot;Blockführer&quot; Willi Mentz, nicknamed &quot;Frankenstein&quot; by the inmates. Mentz single-handedly killed thousands of Jews, aided by his supervisor, August Miete, who was called the &quot;Angel of Death&quot; by the prisoners. The pit was also used to burn old worn-out clothes and identity papers deposited by new arrivals at the undressing area.

The third section of Treblinka II (Camp 3, also called the upper camp) was the main killing zone, with gas chambers at its centre. It was completely screened from the railway tracks by an earth bank built with the help of a mechanical digger. This mound was elongated in shape, similar to a retaining wall, and can be seen in a sketch produced during the 1970 trial of Treblinka II commandant Franz Stangl. On the other sides, the zone was camouflaged from new arrivals like the rest of the camp, using tree branches woven into barbed wire fences by the &quot;Tarnungskommando&quot; (the work detail led out to collect them). From the undressing barracks, a fenced-off path led through the forested area to the gas chambers. The SS cynically called it &quot;die Himmelstraße&quot; (&quot;the road to heaven&quot;) or &quot;der Schlauch&quot; (&quot;the tube&quot;). For the first eight months of the camp&#x27;s operation, the excavator was used to dig burial ditches on both sides of the gas chambers; these ditches were long, wide, and deep. In early 1943, they were replaced with cremation pyres up to long, with rails laid across the pits on concrete blocks. The 300 prisoners who operated the upper camp lived in separate barracks behind the gas chambers.

==Killing process==
Unlike Nazi concentration camps in which prisoners were used as forced labour, extermination camps such as Treblinka had only one function: to murder those sent there. To prevent incoming victims from realising its nature, Treblinka II was disguised as a transit camp for deportations further east, complete with fake train schedules, a fake train-station clock with hands painted on it, names of destinations, a fake ticket window, and the sign &quot;Ober Majdan&quot;, a code word for Treblinka commonly used to deceive prisoners arriving from Western Europe. Majdan was a prewar landed estate away from the camp.

===Polish Jews===
The mass deportation of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto began on 22 July 1942 with the first transportation of 6,000 people. The gas chambers began to be operated the following morning. For the next two months, deportations from Warsaw continued daily, via two shuttle trains (the second one, from 6 August 1942), each carrying about 4,000 to 7,000 people crying for water. No other trains were allowed to stop at the Treblinka station. The first daily trains came in the early morning, often after an overnight wait, and the second, in mid-afternoon. All new arrivals were sent immediately to the undressing area by the &quot;Bahnhofskommando&quot; squad that managed the arrival platform, and from there to the gas chambers. According to German records, including the official report by SS-&quot;Brigadeführer&quot; Jürgen Stroop, 265,000 Jews were transported in freight trains from the Warsaw Ghetto to Treblinka during the period from 22 July to 12 September 1942.

The Polish railway was very heavily used. An average of 420 German military trains were passing through every 24 hours on top of internal traffic already in 1941. The Holocaust trains&#x27; passage to their destination was routinely delayed; some transports took many days to arrive. Hundreds of prisoners were murdered by exhaustion, suffocation and thirst while in transit to the camp in the overcrowded wagons. In extreme cases, such as the Biała Podlaska transport of 6,000 Jews travelling only a distance, up to 90 percent of people were already dead when the sealed doors were opened. From September 1942 on, both Polish and foreign Jews were greeted with a brief verbal announcement. An earlier signboard with directions was removed because it was clearly insufficient. The deportees were told that they had arrived at a transit point on the way to Ukraine and needed to shower and have their clothes disinfected before receiving work uniforms and new orders.

===Foreign Jews and Romani people===

Treblinka received transports of almost 20,000 foreign Jews between October 1942 and March 1943, including 8,000 from the German Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia via Theresienstadt, and over 11,000 from Bulgarian-occupied Thrace, Macedonia, and Pirot following an agreement with the Nazi-allied Bulgarian government. They had train tickets and arrived predominantly in passenger carriages with considerable luggage, travel foods and drinks, all of which were taken by the SS to the food storage barracks. The provisions included such items as smoked mutton, speciality breads, wine, cheese, fruit, tea, coffee, and sweets. Unlike Polish Jews arriving in Holocaust trains from nearby ghettos in cities like Warsaw, Radom, and those of &quot;Bezirk Bialystok&quot;, the foreign Jews received a warm welcome upon arrival from an SS man (either Otto Stadie or Willy Mätzig), after which they were murdered like the others. Treblinka was mainly used for the murder of Polish Jews, Bełżec was used to murder Jews from Austria and the Sudetenland, and Sobibór was used to murder Jews from France and the Netherlands. Auschwitz-Birkenau was used to murder Jews from almost every other country in Europe. The frequency of arriving transports slowed down in winter.

The decoupled locomotive went back to the Treblinka station or to the layover yard in Małkinia for the next load, while the victims were pulled from the carriages onto the platform by &quot;Kommando Blau&quot;, one of the Jewish work details forced to assist the Germans at the camp. They were led through the gate amidst chaos and screaming. They were separated by gender behind the gate; women were pushed into the undressing barracks and barber on the left, and men were sent to the right. All were ordered to tie their shoes together and strip. Some kept their own towels. The Jews who resisted were taken to the &quot;Lazarett&quot;, also called the &quot;Red Cross infirmary&quot;, and shot behind it. Women had their hair cut off; therefore, it took longer to prepare them for the gas chambers than men. The hair was used in the manufacture of socks for U-boat crews and hair-felt footwear for the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot;.

Most of those murdered at Treblinka were Jews, but about 2,000 Romani people were also murdered there. Like the Jews, the Romani were first rounded up and sent to the ghettos. At a conference on 30 January 1940 it was decided that all 30,000 Romani living in Germany proper were to be deported to former Polish territory. Most of these were sent to Jewish ghettos in the General Government, such as those in Warsaw and Łódź. As with the Jews, most Romani who went to Treblinka were murdered in the gas chambers, although some were shot. The majority of the Jews living in ghettos were sent to Bełżec, Sobibór, or Treblinka to be murdered; most of the Romani living in the ghettos were shot on the spot. There were no known Romani escapees or survivors from Treblinka.

===Gas chambers===
After undressing, newly arrived Jews were beaten with whips to drive them towards the gas chambers; hesitant men were treated particularly brutally. Rudolf Höss, the commandant at Auschwitz, contrasted the practice at Treblinka of deceiving the victims about the showers with his own camp&#x27;s practice of telling them they had to go through a &quot;delousing&quot; process. According to the postwar testimony of some SS officers, men were always gassed first, while women and children waited outside the gas chambers for their turn. During this time, the women and children could hear the sounds of suffering from inside the chambers, and they became aware of what awaited them, which caused panic, distress, and even involuntary defecation.

Many survivors of the Treblinka camp testified that an officer known as &#x27;Ivan the Terrible&#x27; was responsible for operating the gas chambers in 1942 and 1943. While Jews were awaiting their fate outside the gas chambers, Ivan the Terrible allegedly tortured, beat, and murdered many of them. Survivors witnessed Ivan beat victims&#x27; heads open with a pipe, cut victims with a sword or a bayonet, cut off noses and ears, and gouge out eyes. One survivor testified that Ivan murdered an infant by bashing it against a wall; another claimed that he raped a young girl before cutting her abdomen open and letting her bleed to death.

The gas chambers were completely enclosed by a high wooden fence. Originally, they consisted of three interconnected barracks long and wide, disguised as showers. They had double walls insulated by earth packed down in between. The interior walls and ceilings were lined with roofing paper. The floors were covered with tin-plated sheet metal, the same material used for the roof. Solid wooden doors were insulated with rubber and bolted from the outside by heavy cross-bars.

According to Stangl, a train transport of about 3,000 people could be &quot;processed&quot; in three hours. In a 14-hour workday, 12,000 to 15,000 people were murdered. After the new gas chambers were built, the duration of the killing process was reduced to an hour and a half. The victims were murdered via gas, using the exhaust fumes conducted through pipes from an engine of a Red Army tank. SS-&quot;Scharführer&quot; Erich Fuchs was responsible for installing it. The engine was brought in by the SS at the time of the camp&#x27;s construction and housed in a room with a generator that supplied the camp with electricity. The tank engine exhaust pipe ran just below the ground and opened into all three gas chambers. The fumes could be seen seeping out. After about 20 minutes the bodies were removed by dozens of &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot;, placed onto carts and wheeled away. The system was imperfect and required a lot of effort; trains that arrived later in the day had to wait on layover tracks overnight at Treblinka, Małkinia, or Wólka Okrąglik.

Between August and September 1942, a large new building with a concrete foundation was built from bricks and mortar under the guidance of Erwin Lambert, who had supervised the construction of gas chambers for the Action T4 involuntary euthanasia program. It contained 8–10 gas chambers, each of which was , and it had a corridor in the centre. Stangl supervised its construction and brought in building materials from the nearby village of Małkinia by dismantling factory stock. During this time victims continued to arrive daily and were led naked past the building site to the original gas chambers. The new gas chambers became operational after five weeks of construction, equipped with two fume-producing engines instead of one. The metal doors, which had been taken from Soviet military bunkers around Białystok, had portholes through which it was possible to observe the dead before removing them. Stangl said that the old gas chambers were capable of murdering 3,000 people in three hours. The new ones had the highest possible capacity of any gas chambers in the three Reinhard death camps and could murder up to 22,000 or 25,000 people every day, a fact which Globocnik once boasted about to Kurt Gerstein, a fellow SS officer from Disinfection Services. The new gas chambers were seldom used to their full capacity; 12,000–15,000 victims remained the daily average.

The killing process at Treblinka differed significantly from the method used at Auschwitz and Majdanek, where the poison gas Zyklon B (hydrogen cyanide) was used. At Treblinka, Sobibór, and Bełżec, the victims were murdered by suffocation and carbon monoxide poisoning from engine exhaust in stationary gas chambers. At Chełmno, they were carried within two specially equipped and engineered trucks, driven at a scientifically calculated speed so as to murder the Jews inside it during the trip, rather than force the drivers and guards to murder them at the destination. After visiting Treblinka on a guided tour, Auschwitz commandant Rudolf Höss concluded that using exhaust gas was inferior to the cyanide used at his extermination camp. The chambers became silent after 12 minutes and were closed for 20 minutes or less. According to Jankiel Wiernik, who survived the 1943 prisoner uprising and escaped, when the doors of the gas chambers had been opened, the bodies of the victims were standing and kneeling rather than lying down, due to the severe overcrowding. Dead mothers embraced the bodies of their children. Prisoners who worked in the &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; later testified that the dead frequently let out a last gasp of air when they were extracted from the chambers. Some victims showed signs of life during the disposal of the corpses, but the guards routinely refused to react.

===Cremation pits===
The Germans became aware of the political danger associated with the mass burial of corpses in April 1943 after they discovered the graves of Polish victims of the 1940 Katyn massacre carried out by the Soviets near Smolensk. The bodies of the 10,000 Polish officers executed by the NKVD were well preserved despite their long burial. The Germans formed the Katyn Commission to prove that the Soviets were solely responsible, and used radio broadcast and newsfilm to alert the Allies to this war crime. Subsequently, the Nazi leadership, concerned about covering up their own crimes, issued the secret orders to exhume the corpses buried at death camps and burn them. The cremations began shortly after Himmler&#x27;s visit to the camp in late February or early March 1943.

To incinerate bodies, large cremation pits were constructed at Camp 3 within Treblinka II. The burning pyres were used to cremate the new corpses along with the old ones, which had to be dug up as they had been buried during the first six months of the camp&#x27;s operation. Built under the instructions of Herbert Floß, the camp&#x27;s cremation expert, the pits consisted of railroad rails laid as grates on blocks of concrete. The bodies were placed on rails over wood, splashed with petrol, and burned. It was a harrowing sight, according to Jankiel Wiernik, with the bellies of pregnant women exploding from boiling amniotic fluid. He wrote that &quot;the heat radiating from the pits was maddening.&quot; The bodies burned for five hours, without the ashing of bones. The pyres operated 24 hours a day. Once the system had been perfected, 10,000–12,000 bodies at a time could be incinerated.

The open air burn pits were located east of the new gas chambers and refuelled from 4 a.m. (or after 5 a.m. depending on work-load) to 6 p.m. in roughly 5-hour intervals. The current camp memorial includes a flat grave marker resembling one of them. It is constructed from melted basalt and has a concrete foundation. It is a symbolic grave, as the Nazis spread the actual human ashes, mixed with sand, over an area of .

==Organization of the camp==
The camp was operated by 20–25 German and Austrian members of the &quot;SS-Totenkopfverbände&quot; and 80–120 &quot;Wachmänner&quot; (&quot;watchmen&quot;) guards who had been trained at a special SS facility in the Trawniki concentration camp near Lublin, Poland; all &quot;Wachmänner&quot; guards were trained at Trawniki. The guards were mainly ethnic German &quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; from the east and Ukrainians, with some Russians, Tatars, Moldovans, Latvians, and Central Asians, all of whom had served in the Red Army. They were enlisted by Karl Streibel, the commander of the Trawniki camp, from the prisoner of war (POW) camps for Soviet soldiers. The degree to which their recruitment was voluntary remains disputed; while conditions in the camps for Soviet POWs were dreadful, some Soviet POWs collaborated with the Germans even before cold, hunger, and disease began devastating the POW camps in mid-September 1941.

The work at Treblinka was carried out under threat of death by Jewish prisoners organised into specialised work details. At the Camp 2 &quot;Auffanglager&quot; receiving area each squad had a different coloured triangle. The triangles made it impossible for new arrivals to try to blend in with members of the work details. The blue unit (&quot;Kommando Blau&quot;) managed the rail ramp and unlocked the freight wagons. They met the new arrivals, carried out people who had died en route, removed bundles, and cleaned the wagon floors. The red unit (&quot;Kommando Rot&quot;), which was the largest squad, unpacked and sorted the belongings of victims after they had been &quot;processed&quot;. The red unit delivered these belongings to the storage barracks, which were managed by the yellow unit (&quot;Kommando Gelb&quot;), who separated the items by quality, removed the Star of David from all outer garments, and extracted any money sewn into the linings. The yellow unit was followed by the &quot;Desinfektionskommando&quot;, who disinfected the belongings, including sacks of hair from women who had been murdered there. The &quot;Goldjuden&quot; unit (&quot;gold Jews&quot;) collected and counted banknotes and evaluated the gold and jewellery.

A different group of about 300 men, called the &quot;Totenjuden&quot; (&quot;Jews for the dead&quot;), lived and worked in Camp 3 across from the gas chambers. For the first six months they took the corpses away for burial after gold teeth had been extracted. Once cremation began in early 1943 they took the corpses to the pits, refuelled the pyres, crushed the remaining bones with mallets, and collected the ashes for disposal. Each trainload of &quot;deportees&quot; brought to Treblinka consisted of an average of sixty heavily guarded wagons. They were divided into three sets of twenty at the layover yard. Each set was processed within the first two hours of backing onto the ramp, and was then made ready by the &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; to be exchanged for the next set of twenty wagons.

Members of all work units were continuously beaten by the guards and often shot. Replacements were selected from the new arrivals. There were other work details which had no contact with the transports: the &quot;Holzfällerkommando&quot; (&quot;woodcutter unit&quot;) cut and chopped firewood, and the &quot;Tarnungskommando&quot; (&quot;disguise unit&quot;) camouflaged the structures of the camp. Another work detail was responsible for cleaning the common areas. The Camp 1 &quot;Wohnlager&quot; residential compound contained barracks for about 700 &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; which, when combined with the 300 &quot;Totenjuden&quot; living across from the gas chambers, brought their grand total to roughly one thousand at a time.

Many &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; prisoners hanged themselves at night. Suicides in the &quot;Totenjuden&quot; barracks occurred at the rate of 15 to 20 per day. The work crews were almost entirely replaced every few days; members of the old work detail were murdered except for the most resilient.

==Treblinka prisoner uprising==

In early 1943, an underground Jewish resistance organisation was formed at Treblinka with the goal of seizing control of the camp and escaping to freedom. The planned revolt was preceded by a long period of secret preparations. The clandestine unit was first organised by a former Jewish captain of the Polish Army, Dr. Julian Chorążycki, who was described by fellow plotter Samuel Rajzman as noble and essential to the action. His organising committee included Zelomir Bloch (leadership), Rudolf Masaryk, Marceli Galewski, Samuel Rajzman, Dr. Irena Lewkowska (&quot;Irka&quot;, from the sick bay for the &quot;Hiwis&quot;), Leon Haberman, Chaim Sztajer, Hershl (Henry) Sperling from Częstochowa, and several others. Chorążycki (who treated the German patients) killed himself with poison on 19 April 1943 when faced with imminent capture, so that the Germans could not discover the plot by torturing him. The next leader was another former Polish Army officer, Dr. Berek Lajcher, who arrived on 1 May. Born in Częstochowa, he had practised medicine in Wyszków and was expelled by the Nazis to Wegrów in 1939.

The date of the revolt was initially set for 15 June 1943, but it had to be postponed. A fighter smuggled a grenade in one of the early May trains carrying captured rebels from the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, which had begun on 19 April 1943. When he detonated it in the undressing area, the SS and guards were thrown into a panic. After the explosion, Treblinka received only about 7,000 Jews from the capital for fear of similar incidents; the remaining 42,000 Warsaw Jews were deported to Majdanek instead. The burning of unearthed corpses continued at full speed until the end of July. The Treblinka II conspirators became increasingly concerned about their future as the amount of work for them began to decline. With fewer transports arriving, they realised &quot;they were next in line for the gas chambers.&quot;

===Day of the revolt and survivors===
The uprising was launched on the hot summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), when a group of Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near the train tracks, with a key that had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45 p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian &quot;Trawnikis&quot; resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived until the end of the war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.

Among the Jewish prisoners who escaped after setting fire to the camp, there were two 19-year-olds, Samuel Willenberg and Kalman Taigman, who had both arrived in 1942 and had been forced to work there under the threat of death. Taigman died in 2012 and Willenberg in 2016. Taigman stated of his experience, &quot;It was hell, absolutely hell. A normal man cannot imagine how a living person could have lived through it – killers, natural-born killers, who without a trace of remorse just murdered every little thing.&quot; Willenberg and Taigman emigrated to Israel after the war and devoted their last years to retelling the story of Treblinka. Escapees Hershl Sperling and Richard Glazar both suffered from survivor guilt syndrome and eventually killed themselves. Chaim Sztajer, who was 34 at the time of the uprising, had survived 11 months as a &quot;Sonderkommando&quot; in Treblinka II and was instrumental in the coordination of the uprising between the two camps. Following his escape in the uprising, Sztajer survived for over a year in the forest before the liberation of Poland. Following the war, he migrated to Israel and then to Melbourne, Australia where later in life he constructed from memory a model of Treblinka which is currently displayed at the Jewish Holocaust Centre in Melbourne.

===After the uprising===
After the revolt, Stangl met the head of Operation Reinhard, Odilo Globocnik, and inspector Christian Wirth in Lublin, and decided not to draft a report, as no native Germans had died putting down the revolt. Stangl wanted to rebuild the camp, but Globocnik told him it would be closed down shortly and Stangl would be transferred to Trieste to help fight the partisans there. The Nazi high command may have felt that Stangl, Globocnik, Wirth, and other Reinhard personnel knew too much and wanted to dispose of them by sending them to the front. With almost all the Jews from the German ghettos (established in Poland) murdered, there would have been little point in rebuilding the facility. Auschwitz had enough capacity to fulfil the Nazis&#x27; remaining extermination needs, rendering Treblinka redundant.

The camp&#x27;s new commandant Kurt Franz, formerly its deputy commandant, took over in August. After the war he testified that gassings had stopped by then. In reality, despite the extensive damage to the camp, the gas chambers were intact, and the murder of Polish Jews continued. Speed was reduced, with only ten wagons rolled onto the ramp at a time, while the others had to wait. The last two rail transports of Jews were brought to the camp for gassing from the Białystok Ghetto on 18 and 19 August 1943. They consisted of 76 wagons (37 the first day and 39 the second), according to a communiqué published by the Office of Information of the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;, based on observation of Holocaust trains passing through the village of Treblinka. The 39 wagons that came to Treblinka on 19 August 1943 were carrying at least 7,600 survivors of the Białystok Ghetto Uprising.

On 19 October 1943, Operation Reinhard was terminated by a letter from Odilo Globocnik. The following day, a large group of Jewish &quot;Arbeitskommandos&quot; who had worked on dismantling the camp structures over the previous few weeks were loaded onto the train and transported, via Siedlce and Chełm, to Sobibór to be gassed on 20 October 1943. Franz followed Globocnik and Stangl to Trieste in November. Clean-up operations continued over the winter. As part of these operations, Jews from the surviving work detail dismantled the gas chambers brick-by-brick and used them to erect a farmhouse on the site of the camp&#x27;s former bakery. Globocnik confirmed its purpose as a secret guard post for a Nazi-Ukrainian agent to remain behind the scenes, in a letter he sent to Himmler from Trieste on 5 January 1944. A &quot;Hiwi&quot; guard called Oswald Strebel, a Ukrainian &quot;Volksdeutscher&quot; (ethnic German), was given permission to bring his family from Ukraine for &quot;reasons of surveillance&quot;, wrote Globocnik; Strebel had worked as a guard at Treblinka II. He was instructed to tell visitors that he had been farming there for decades, but the local Poles were well aware of the existence of the camp.

==Operational command of Treblinka II==
===Irmfried Eberl===

SS-&quot;Obersturmführer&quot; Irmfried Eberl was appointed the camp&#x27;s first commandant on 11 July 1942. He was a psychiatrist from Bernburg Euthanasia Centre and the only physician-in-chief to command an extermination camp during World War II. According to some, his poor organisational skills caused the operation of Treblinka to turn disastrous; others point out that the number of transports that were coming in reflected the Nazi high command&#x27;s wildly unrealistic expectations of Treblinka&#x27;s ability to &quot;process&quot; these prisoners. The early gassing machinery frequently broke down due to overuse, forcing the SS to shoot Jews assembled for suffocation. The workers did not have enough time to bury them, and the mass graves were overflowing. According to the testimony of his colleague &quot;Unterscharführer&quot; Hans Hingst, Eberl&#x27;s ego and thirst for power exceeded his ability: &quot;So many transports arrived that the disembarkation and gassing of the people could no longer be handled.&quot; On incoming Holocaust trains to Treblinka, many of the Jews locked inside correctly guessed what was going to happen to them. The odour of decaying corpses could be smelled up to away.

Oskar Berger, a Jewish eyewitness, one of about 100 people who escaped during the 1943 uprising, told of the camp&#x27;s state when he arrived there in August 1942:

When Globocnik made a surprise visit to Treblinka on 26 August 1942 with Christian Wirth and Wirth&#x27;s adjutant from Bełżec, Josef Oberhauser, Eberl was dismissed on the spot. Among the reasons for dismissal were: incompetently disposing of the tens of thousands of dead bodies, using inefficient methods of murder, and not properly concealing the mass-murder. Eberl was transferred to Berlin, closer to operational headquarters in Hitler&#x27;s Chancellery, where the main architect of the Holocaust, Heinrich Himmler, had just stepped up the pace of the programme. Globocnik assigned Wirth to remain in Treblinka temporarily to help clean up the camp. On 28 August 1942, Globocnik suspended deportations. He chose Franz Stangl, who had been the commandant of the Sobibór extermination camp, to assume command of the camp as Eberl&#x27;s successor. Stangl had a reputation as a competent administrator with a good understanding of the project&#x27;s objectives, and Globocnik trusted that he would be capable of resuming control.

===Franz Stangl===

Stangl arrived at Treblinka in late August 1942. He replaced Eberl on 1 September. Years later, Stangl described what he first saw when he came on the scene, in a 1971 interview with Gitta Sereny:
Stangl reorganised the camp, and the transports of Warsaw and Jews from the Radom Ghetto began to arrive again on 3 September 1942. According to Israeli historian Yitzhak Arad, Stangl wanted the camp to look attractive, so he ordered the paths paved in the &quot;Wohnlager&quot; administrative compound. Flowers were planted along &quot;Seidel Straße&quot; as well as near the SS living quarters. He ordered that all arriving prisoners should be greeted by the SS with a verbal announcement translated by the working Jews. The deportees were told that they were at a transit point on the way to Ukraine. Some of their questions were answered by Germans wearing lab coats as tools for deception. At times Stangl carried a whip and wore a white uniform, so he was nicknamed the &quot;White Death&quot; by prisoners. Although he was directly responsible for the camp&#x27;s operations, according to his own testimony Stangl limited his contact with Jewish prisoners as much as possible. He claimed that he rarely interfered with the cruel acts perpetrated by his subordinate officers at the camp. He became desensitised to the murders, and came to perceive prisoners not as humans but merely as &quot;cargo&quot; that had to be destroyed, he said.

====Treblinka song====
According to postwar testimonies, when transports were temporarily halted, then-deputy commandant Kurt Franz wrote lyrics to a song meant to celebrate the Treblinka extermination camp. In reality, prisoner Walter Hirsch wrote them for him. The melody came from something Franz remembered from Buchenwald. The music was upbeat, in the key of D major. The song was taught to Jews assigned to work in the &quot;Sonderkommando&quot;. They were forced to memorise it by nightfall of their first day at the camp. &quot;Unterscharführer&quot; Franz Suchomel recalled the lyrics as follows: &quot;We know only the word of the Commander. / We know only obedience and duty. / We want to keep working, working, / until a bit of luck beckons us some time. Hurrah!&quot;

A musical ensemble was formed, under duress, by Artur Gold, a popular Jewish prewar composer from Warsaw. He arranged the theme to the Treblinka song for the prisoner orchestra which he conducted. Gold arrived in Treblinka in 1942 and played music in the SS mess hall at the &quot;Wohnlager&quot; on German orders. He died during the uprising.

===Kurt Franz===
After the Treblinka revolt in August 1943, and termination of Operation Reinhard in October 1943, Stangl went with Globocnik to Trieste in northern Italy where SS reinforcements were needed. The third and last Treblinka II commandant was Kurt Franz, nicknamed &quot;Lalka&quot; by the prisoners () because he had &quot;an innocent face&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berliner/Biala&quot;&gt; &quot;Also in:&quot; .&lt;/ref&gt; According to survivor testimonies, Franz shot and beat prisoners to death for minor infractions or had his dog Barry tear them to pieces. He managed Treblinka II until November 1943. The subsequent clean-up of the Treblinka II perimeter was completed by prisoners of nearby Treblinka I &quot;Arbeitslager&quot; in the following months. Franz&#x27;s deputy was &quot;Hauptscharführer&quot; Fritz Küttner, who maintained a network of informers among the prisoners and did the hands-on murders.

Kurt Franz maintained a photo album against orders never to take photographs inside Treblinka. He named it &quot;Schöne Zeiten&quot; (&quot;Good Times&quot;). His album is a rare source of images illustrating the mechanised grave digging, brickworks in Małkinia and the Treblinka zoo, among others. Franz was careful not to photograph the gas chambers.

The Treblinka I gravel mine functioned at full capacity under the command of Theodor van Eupen until July 1944, with new forced labourers sent to him by &quot;Kreishauptmann&quot; Ernst Gramss from Sokołów. The mass shootings continued into 1944. With Soviet troops closing in, the last 300 to 700 prisoners disposing of the incriminating evidence were executed by &quot;Trawnikis&quot; in late July 1944, long after the camp&#x27;s official closure. Strebel, the ethnic German who had been installed in the farmhouse built in place of the camp&#x27;s original bakery using bricks from the gas chambers, set fire to the building and fled to avoid capture.

==Arrival of the Soviets==
In late July 1944, Soviet forces approached from the east. The departing Germans, who had already destroyed most direct evidence of genocidal intent, burned surrounding villages to the ground, including 761 buildings in Poniatowo, Prostyń, and Grądy. Many families were murdered. The fields of grain that had once fed the SS were burned. On 19 August 1944, German forces blew up the church in Prostyń and its bell tower, the last defensive strongpoint against the Red Army in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rytel-Andrianik/Prostyń&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When the Soviets entered Treblinka on 16 August, the extermination zone had been levelled, ploughed over, and planted with lupins. What remained, wrote visiting Soviet war correspondent Vasily Grossman, were small pieces of bone in the soil, human teeth, scraps of paper and fabric, broken dishes, jars, shaving brushes, rusted pots and pans, cups of all sizes, mangled shoes, and lumps of human hair. The road leading to the camp was pitch black. Until mid-1944 human ashes (up to 20 carts every day) had been regularly strewn by the remaining prisoners along the road for in the direction of Treblinka I. When the war ended, destitute and starving locals started walking up the Black Road (as they began to call it) in search of man-made nuggets shaped from melted gold in order to buy bread.

===Early attempts at preservation===

The new Soviet-installed government did not preserve evidence of the camp. The scene was not legally protected at the conclusion of World War II. In September 1947, 30 students from the local school, led by their teacher Feliks Szturo and priest Józef Ruciński, collected larger bones and skull fragments into farmers&#x27; wicker baskets and buried them in a single mound. The same year the first remembrance committee &quot;Komitet Uczczenia Ofiar Treblinki&quot; (KUOT; Committee for the Remembrance of the Victims of Treblinka) formed in Warsaw, and launched a design competition for the memorial.

Stalinist officials allocated no funding for the design competition nor for the memorial, and the committee disbanded in 1948; by then many survivors had left the country. In 1949, the town of Sokołów Podlaski protected the camp with a new fence and gate. A work crew with no archaeological experience was sent in to landscape the grounds. In 1958, after the end of Stalinism in Poland, the Warsaw provincial council declared Treblinka to be a place of martyrology. Over the next four years, of land that had formed part of the camp was purchased from 192 farmers in the villages of Prostyń, Grądy, Wólka Okrąglik and Nowa Maliszewa.

===Construction of the memorial===
The construction of a monument in height designed by sculptor Franciszek Duszeńko was inaugurated on 21 April 1958 with the laying of the cornerstone at the site of the former gas chambers. The sculpture represents the trend toward large avant-garde forms introduced in the 1960s throughout Europe, with a granite tower cracked down the middle and capped by a mushroom-like block carved with abstract reliefs and Jewish symbols. Treblinka was declared a national monument of martyrology on 10 May 1964 during an official ceremony attended by 30,000 people. The monument was unveiled by Zenon Kliszko, the Marshal of the Sejm of the Republic of Poland, in the presence of survivors of the Treblinka uprising from Israel, France, Czechoslovakia and Poland. The camp custodian&#x27;s house (built nearby in 1960) was turned into an exhibition space following the collapse of communism in Poland in 1989 and the retirement of the custodian; it opened in 2006. It was later expanded and made into a branch of the Siedlce Regional Museum.

==Victims==

There are many estimates of the total number of people murdered at Treblinka; most scholarly estimates range from 700,000 to 900,000, meaning that more Jews were murdered at Treblinka than at any other Nazi extermination camp except for Auschwitz. The Treblinka museum in Poland states that at least 800,000 people were murdered at Treblinka; Israel&#x27;s Holocaust museum, Yad Vashem, puts the number at 870,000; and the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum gives a range of 870,000 to 925,000.

===First estimates===
The first estimate of the number of people murdered at Treblinka came from Vasily Grossman, a Soviet war reporter who visited Treblinka in July 1944 as the Soviet forces marched westward across Poland. He published an article called &quot;The Hell Called Treblinka&quot;, which appeared in the November 1944 issue of &quot;Znamya&quot;, a monthly Russian literary magazine. In the article, he claimed that 3 million people had been murdered at Treblinka. He may not have been aware that the short station platform at Treblinka II greatly reduced the number of wagons that could be unloaded at one time, and may have been adhering to the Soviet trend of exaggerating Nazi crimes for propaganda purposes. In 1947, the Polish historian Zdzisław Łukaszkiewicz gave an estimate of 780,000 murders, based on the accepted record of 156 transports with an average of 5,000 prisoners each.

===Court exhibits and affidavits===

The Treblinka trials of the 1960s took place in Düsseldorf and produced the two official West German estimates. During the 1965 trial of Kurt Franz, the Court of Assize in Düsseldorf concluded that at least 700,000 people were murdered at Treblinka, following a report by Dr. Helmut Krausnick, director of the Institute of Contemporary History. During Franz Stangl&#x27;s trial in 1969, the same court reassessed the number to be at least 900,000 after new evidence from Dr. Wolfgang Scheffler.

A chief witness for the prosecution at Düsseldorf in the 1965, 1966, 1968 and 1970 trials was Franciszek Ząbecki, who was employed by the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; as a rail traffic controller at Treblinka village from 22 May 1941. In 1977 he published his book &quot;Old and New Memories&quot;, in which he used his own records to estimate that at least 1,200,000 people were murdered at Treblinka. His estimate was based on the maximum capacity of a trainset during the &quot;Grossaktion&quot; Warsaw of 1942 rather than its yearly average. The original German waybills in his possession did not have the number of prisoners listed. Ząbecki, a Polish member of railway staff before the war, was one of the few non-German witnesses to see most transports that came into the camp; he was present at the Treblinka station when the first Holocaust train arrived from Warsaw. Ząbecki was a member of the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; (Polish: Home Army), which formed most of the Polish resistance movement in World War II, and kept a daily record of the extermination transports. He also clandestinely photographed the burning Treblinka II perimeter during the uprising in August 1943. Ząbecki witnessed the last set of five enclosed freight wagons carrying &quot;Sonderkommandos&quot; to the Sobibór gas chambers on 20 October 1943. In 2013, his son Piotr Ząbecki wrote an article about him for &quot;Życie Siedleckie&quot; that revised the number to 1,297,000. Ząbecki&#x27;s daily records of transports to the camp, and demographic information regarding the number of people deported from each ghetto to Treblinka, were the two main sources for estimates of the death toll.

In his 1987 book &quot;Belzec, Sobibor, Treblinka: The Operation Reinhard Death Camps&quot;, Israeli historian Yitzhak Arad stated that at least 763,000 people were murdered at Treblinka between July 1942 and April 1943. A considerable number of other estimates followed: see table (below).

===Höfle Telegram===
A further source of information became available in 2001. The Höfle Telegram was an encrypted message sent to Berlin on 31 December 1942 by Operation Reinhard deputy commander Hermann Höfle, detailing the number of Jews deported by DRB to each of the Operation Reinhard death camps up to that point. Discovered among declassified documents in Britain, it shows that by the official count of the German Transport Authority 713,555 Jews were sent to Treblinka in 1942. The number of murders was probably higher, according to the &quot;Armia Krajowa&quot; communiqués. On the basis of the telegram and additional undated German evidence for 1943 listing 67,308 people deported, historian Jacek Andrzej Młynarczyk calculated that by the official DRB count, 780,863 people were brought by &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; to Treblinka.

===Table of estimates===
*The information in the rows with an empty last column comes from &quot;Dam im imię na wieki&quot;, page 114.

==Treblinka trials==
The first major trial for war crimes committed at Treblinka was held in Düsseldorf between 12 October 1964 and 24 August 1965, preceded by the 1951 trial of &quot;SS-Scharführer&quot; Josef Hirtreiter, which was triggered by charges of war crimes unrelated to his service at the camp. The trial was delayed due to the decreased interest by the United States and the Soviet Union in prosecuting German war crimes with the onset of the Cold War. Many of the more than 90,000 Nazi war criminals recorded in German files were serving in positions of prominence under West German chancellor Konrad Adenauer. In 1964 and 1965, eleven former SS camp personnel were brought to trial by West Germany, including commandant Kurt Franz. He was sentenced to life imprisonment, along with Artur Matthes (&quot;Totenlager&quot;) and Willi Mentz and August Miete (both from &quot;Lazarett&quot;). Gustav Münzberger (gas chambers) received 12 years, Franz Suchomel (gold and money) 7 years, Otto Stadie (operation) 6 years, Erwin Lambert (gas chambers) 4 years, and Albert Rum (&quot;Totenlager&quot;) 3 years. Otto Horn (corpse detail) was acquitted.

The second commandant of Treblinka II, Franz Stangl, escaped with his wife and children from Austria to Brazil in 1951. Stangl found work at a Volkswagen factory in São Paulo. His role in the mass murder of Jews was known to the Austrian authorities, but Austria did not issue a warrant for his arrest until 1961. Stangl was registered under his real name at the Austrian consulate in Brazil. It took another six years before Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal tracked him down and triggered his arrest. After his extradition from Brazil to West Germany, Stangl was tried for the murders of around 900,000 people. He admitted to the murders but argued: &quot;My conscience is clear. I was simply doing my duty.&quot; Stangl was found guilty on 22 October 1970, and sentenced to life imprisonment. He died of heart failure in prison in Düsseldorf on 28 June 1971.

Between the 1940s and early 1960s, the Soviet Union prosecuted 21 people for crimes committed at Treblinka. All of them were executed or died in prison. In 1986, the Soviet Union tried another Treblinka guard, Feodor Fedorenko. Fedorenko had been deported to the Soviet Union after his crimes were exposed, resulting in him being stripped of his American citizenship. Fedorenko was sentenced to death and executed in 1987.

===Material gain===
The theft of cash and valuables, collected from the victims of gassing, was conducted by the higher-ranking SS men on an enormous scale. It was a common practice among the concentration camps&#x27; top echelon everywhere; two Majdanek concentration camp commandants, Koch and Florstedt, were tried and executed by the SS for the same offence in April 1945. When the top-ranking officers went home, they would sometimes request a private locomotive from Klinzman and Emmerich at the Treblinka station to transport their personal &quot;gifts&quot; to Małkinia for a connecting train. Then, they would drive out of the camp in cars without any incriminating evidence on their person, and later arrive at Małkinia to transfer the goods.

The overall amount of material gain by Nazi Germany is unknown except for the period between 22 August and 21 September 1942, when there were 243 wagons of goods sent and recorded. Globocnik delivered a written tally to Reinhard headquarters on 15 December 1943 with the SS profit of ℛℳ 178,745,960.59, including of gold, of silver, of platinum, and 249,771.50 American dollars, as well as 130 diamond solitaires, of brilliants, of diamonds, and of pearls. The amount of loot Globocnik stole is unknown; Suchomel claimed in court to have filled a box with one million Reichsmarks for him.

==Archaeological studies==

Neither the Jewish religious leaders in Poland nor the authorities allowed archaeological excavations at the camp out of respect for the dead. Approval for a limited archaeological study was issued for the first time in 2010 to a British team from Staffordshire University using non-invasive technology and Lidar remote sensing. The soil resistance was analysed at the site with ground-penetrating radar. Features that appeared to be structural were found, two of which were thought to be the remains of the gas chambers, and the study was allowed to continue.

The archaeological team performing the search discovered three new mass graves. The remains were reinterred out of respect for the victims. At the second dig the findings included yellow tiles stamped with a pierced mullet star resembling a Star of David, and building foundations with a wall. The star was soon identified as the logo of Polish ceramics factory manufacturing floor tiles, founded by Jan Dziewulski and brothers Józef and Władysław Lange (Dziewulski i Lange – D✡L since 1886), nationalised and renamed under communism after the war. As explained by forensic archaeologist Caroline Sturdy Colls, the new evidence was important because the second gas chambers built at Treblinka were housed in the only brick building in the camp; Colls claimed that this provides the first physical evidence for their existence. In his memoir describing his stay in the camp, survivor Jankiel Wiernik says that the floor in the gas chambers (which he helped build) was made of similar tiles. The discoveries became a subject of the 2014 documentary by the Smithsonian Channel. More forensic work has been planned.

==March of the Living==
Treblinka museum receives most visitors per day during the annual March of the Living educational programme which brings young people from around the world to Poland, to explore the remnants of the Holocaust. The visitors whose primary destination is the march at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, visit Treblinka in the preceding days. In 2009, 300 Israeli students attended the ceremony led by Eli Shaish from the Ministry of Education. In total 4,000 international students visited. In 2013 the number of students who came, ahead of the Auschwitz commemorations, was 3,571. In 2014, 1,500 foreign students visited.

<text>Brief Overview
The San Juan Mountains is a high and rugged mountain range in the Rocky Mountains in southwestern Colorado and northwestern New Mexico. The area is highly mineralized (the Colorado Mineral Belt) and figured in the gold and silver mining industry of early Colorado. Major towns, all old mining camps, include Creede, Lake City, Silverton, Ouray, and Telluride. Large scale mining has ended in the region, although independent prospectors still work claims throughout the range. The last large-scale mines were the Sunnyside Mine near Silverton, which operated until late in the 20th century, and the Idarado Mine on Red Mountain Pass, which closed in the 1970s. Famous old San Juan mines include the Camp Bird and Smuggler Union mines, both located between Telluride and Ouray.

The Summitville mine was the scene of a major environmental disaster in the 1990s when the liner of a cyanide-laced tailing pond began leaking heavily. Summitville is in the Summitville caldera, one of many extinct volcanoes making up the San Juan volcanic field. One, La Garita Caldera, is in diameter. Large beds of lava, some extending under the floor of the San Luis Valley, are characteristic of the eastern slope of the San Juans. The eruption of the La Garita Caldera shaped the San Juan Mountains by completely obliterating the volcanoes that once stood in the area. 

Tourism

Tourism is a major part of the regional economy, with the narrow gauge railway between Durango and Silverton being an attraction mostly in the summer and fall. Off-roading is popular on the old trails which linked the historic mining camps, including the notorious Black Bear Road. Visiting old ghost towns is popular, as is wilderness trekking and mountain climbing. Many of the old mining camps are popular sites of summer homes. Though the San Juans are extremely steep and receive much snow, so far only Telluride has made the transition to a major ski resort. Purgatory Resort, once known as Durango Mountain Resort, is a small ski area 26 miles north of Durango. There is also skiing on Wolf Creek Pass at the Wolf Creek ski area. Recently Silverton Mountain ski area has begun operation near Silverton. The range is also a popular destination for endurance sports like trail running and mountain biking; Silverton is home to the Hardrock 100 Endurance Run one of the most difficult and technical ultra-marathons in the world.

Wildlife 

River Systems

The Rio Grande drains the east side of the range. The other side of the San Juans, the western slope of the continental divide, is drained by tributaries of the San Juan, Dolores and Gunnison rivers, which all flow into the Colorado River.

Forests

The San Juan and Uncompahgre National Forests cover a large portion of the San Juan Mountains. The Continental Divide Trail, a long-distance hiking trail follows the crest of the San Juan Mountains. The Weminuche Wilderness, Colorado&#x27;s largest wilderness area, with an area of is in the San Juans. 152 miles of the Continental Divide trail are located on Trail #813 which follow through the San Juan wilderness and Weminuche Wilderness. 

Telluride Airport 

The San Juan Mountains are also distinctive for their high altitude plateaus and peaks. As a result, facilities in the towns and cities of the region are among the highest in the nation. Telluride Airport, at an elevation of 9,070 feet, is the highest in the United States with regularly scheduled commercial service.

==Prominent peaks==


* Note: This is only a partial list of important peaks in the San Juans, listing peaks by prominence only. There are dozens more summits over 12,000 feet.

==History of the area==
Human history at the eastern edge of the San Juan Mountains dates back thousands of years. Smithsonian archaeologists have identified paleo-Indian sites that are about 5,000 years old, located near Great Sand Dunes National Park and at the northern edge of the San Luis Valley, close to Poncha Pass. This suggests that early human presence in the region dates back to ancient times, long before the establishment of modern landmarks.

Mining operators in the San Juan mountain area formed the San Juan District Mining Association (SJDMA) in 1903, as a direct result of a Western Federation of Miners proposal to the Telluride Mining Association for the eight-hour day, which had been approved in a referendum by 72 percent of Colorado voters. The new association consolidated the power of thirty-six mining properties in San Miguel, Ouray, and San Juan counties. The SJDMA refused to consider any reduction in hours or increase in wages, helping to provoke a bitter strike.

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== First Crusade ====
* Spring – Peter the Hermit begins his preaching of the First Crusade, traveling from Berry (in central France) across Champagne, and down the Meuse Valley to Cologne (modern Germany). He gathers the People&#x27;s Crusade (some 40,000 supporters), which departs about April 20. Peter&#x27;s speeches appeal not only to nobles and knights, but also laborers, tradesmen and peasants (among them are former brigands and criminals).
* May – The People&#x27;s Crusade, under Peter the Hermit, arrives at Sopron. Coloman, King of Hungary (&quot;the Learned&quot;) gives them permission to pass through Hungary, and to use the markets. Peter and his followers (some 20,000 men and women) travel from Budapest southwards supported by knights, while lumbering wagons carry stores and a chest of money that he has collected for the journey.
* May – The Rhineland massacres: Members of the People&#x27;s Crusade led by Count Emicho destroy most of the Jewish communities along the Rhine in a series of large pogroms in France and Germany. Thousands of Jews are massacred, driven to suicide, or forced to convert to Christianity. Estimates of the number of Jewish men, women and children murdered are 2,000 to 12,000.
* May 8 – French members of the People&#x27;s Crusade led by Walter Sans Avoir enter Hungary, without incident they arrive at Semlin, and cross the Sava into Byzantine territory at Belgrade. Meanwhile, Walter demands food but he is refused entry, and the crusaders are forced to pillage the countryside. Eventually Walter is allowed to carry on to Niš, where he is provided with food.
* May 18–26 – The Worms massacre: Members of the People&#x27;s Crusade under Emicho besiege Worms in the Rhineland before killing at least 800 Jews, despite the intervention of Bishop Adalbert II. He tries to hide some of them in the bishop&#x27;s palace, others chose to remain outside its walls. One of the victims is Minna of Worms, an influential Jew among the Christian nobility.
* May 27 – Members of the People&#x27;s Crusade under Emicho massacre at least 1,000 Jews in Mainz. Archbishop Ruthard tries to hide some of them in the cellars of Mainz Cathedral but the crusaders learn of this – and murder most of the Jews. Men, women, and children of all ages are slaughtered indiscriminately.
* May 30 – Members of the People&#x27;s Crusade led by the priest Folkmar from Saxony persecute Jews in Prague, despite the opposition of the local Catholic hierarchy. Local citizens try to hide them in their own houses. Later the Jews manage to escape to safety in neighboring villages, but are slaughtered by the hundreds.
* June – Members of the People&#x27;s Crusade under Emicho set out up the Main towards Hungary. Some followers break off from Emicho&#x27;s army at Mainz and travel to Metz – where many Jews are persecuted and murdered. They proceed down the Rhine, massacring the Jews at Neuss, Wevelinghofen, and Xanten.
* June – The People&#x27;s Crusade under Emicho are refused entry to Hungary on orders of Coloman, who sends troops to defend the bridge at Wieselburg. Emicho decides to build an alternative bridge and crosses the Danube. He besieges the fortress of Wieselburg, but is defeated and routed by the Hungarian army.
* June – Siege of Semlin: The People&#x27;s Crusade led by Peter the Hermit arrives at Semlin. Hearing rumors of an attack from the Hungarian count Guz of Semlin on the rearguard, Geoffrey Burel assaults the castle, captures it by surprise, and defeats the Hungarian army. He plunders its supplies, herds and horses.
* June 26 – The People&#x27;s Crusade (some 30,000 men) led by Peter the Hermit crosses the Sava (stealing boats from the local fishermen) but are attacked by Pechenegs and Hungarian forces. The citizens of Belgrade flee and the crusaders pillage and burn the city. Peter travels for seven days, and arrives at Niš.
* July – The People&#x27;s Crusade led by Peter the Hermit is defeated by the Byzantine army (mostly Hungarian and Bulgar mercenaries) in battle near Niš. The crusader supply train of some 2,000 wagons and Peter&#x27;s treasury chest is captured by the Byzantines. About a quarter of the People&#x27;s Crusade is lost.
* July 12 – The People&#x27;s Crusade led by Peter the Hermit reaches Sofia, where they meet envoys from Constantinople with orders to keep them supplied along the road. At Philippopolis the Greeks are so deeply moved by the suffering of Peter and his followers that the locals give them money, food and horses.
* August 1 – The People&#x27;s Crusade led by Peter the Hermit arrives at Constantinople. He is received by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, who gives him financial support. The crusaders commit endless thefts in the suburbs. Peter combines his forces with Walter Sans Avoir and camps outside Constantinople.
* August 2–6 – The People&#x27;s Crusade reorganize their forces and gather supplies. Alexios I advises Peter the Hermit to wait for reinforcements but he ignores the advice. The People&#x27;s army (some 30,000 men) is transported across the Bosporus – by the Byzantine fleet to Civetot (modern Turkey).
* August – Hugh (&quot;the Great&quot;), count of Vermandois (a brother of King Philip I), departs to join the First Crusade. He travels with a small army via the Alps to Rome. While sailing the Adriatic Sea from Bari to Dyrrachium his fleet is reduced by shipwreck. Hugh&#x27;s own ship is stranded on the shore near Epirus.
* August – Godfrey of Bouillon, duke of Lower Lorraine, accompanied by his younger brother Baldwin, sets off to join the First Crusade (called by Pope Urban II) at the head of an army of some 40,000 men. He pledges his allegiance to Emperor Henry IV who issues an order not to harm Jewish communities.
* September – French forces (7,000 infantry and 300 knights) led by Geoffrey Burel raid around Nicaea (the capital of the Rum Seljuk Turks), plundering livestock and villages in the suburbs. They commit atrocities against local Christian peasants. Children are tortured and dismembered by the crusaders.
* September – German forces (5,000 infantry and 200 knights) led by Rainald of Breis raid the region of Nicaea. They advance eastward and assault the Seljuk garrison in the castle of Xerigordos. They manage to capture; and, find it well stocked with provisions. The Greek Christians inside are spared.
* September 29 – Siege of Xerigordos: Sultan Kilij Arslan I sends a Seljuk expeditionary force to assault and recapture the castle of Xerigordos. They cut off the water supply, and Rainald of Breis is forced to surrender. Many of the crusaders are killed but others convert to Islam and become slaves.
* October – Robert Curthose, duke of Normandy (a brother of King William II of England), sets off to join the First Crusade. He assembles his army at Pontarlier and travels through Italy to Rome. To raise money for the Crusade Robert mortgages the Norman duchy to William, for the sum of 10,000 pennies.
* October – Raymond IV (&quot;Saint-Gilles&quot;), count of Toulouse, sets off to join the First Crusade. He travels with his army, accompanied by his wife Elvira and Bishop Adhemar of Le Puy, via Provence through the Balkan route (along the coast of Croatia). He arrives at Dyrrachium to march to Thessaloniki.
* October – Bohemond I, Italo-Norman prince of Taranto (the son of Duke Robert Guiscard), departs to join the First Crusade. He crosses the Adriatic Sea from Brindisi with his army (some 4,000 men), and arrives in Vorë. While traveling, Bohemond gives strict orders not to plunder Byzantine villages.
* October 21 – Battle of Civetot: The Seljuk Turks led by Kilij Arslan I defeat the People&#x27;s army (20,000 men) near Nicaea. The crusaders are slaughtered, and the camp at Civetot is captured. Only children are spared and sent into slavery. Around 3,000 manage to escape back to Constantinople.
* December – The last of the four planned Crusader armies arrives at Constantinople, bringing the total numbers to 60,000 infantry and knights. Curiously there isn&#x27;t a single king among the Crusaders&#x27; leaders. At this time Philip I, William II, and Henry IV are all under excommunication by Urban II.
* December 25 – Godfrey of Bouillon is appointed the primary leader of the First Crusade, making it a largely French war in practice and causing the inhabitants of the Holy Land to refer to Europeans generally as &quot;Franks&quot;. Godfrey and the other leaders agree to take an oath of loyalty to Alexios I.

==== Europe ====
* King Alfonso VI (&quot;the Brave&quot;) of Castile arranges to marry his daughter Theresa to Henry of Burgundy (House of Burgundy). Theresa&#x27;s dowry includes the County of Portugal, given to Henry with Porto as the capital.
* &quot;Reconquista&quot;: King Peter I of Aragon conquers Huesca from the Moors of the Taifa of Zaragoza. He expands his domains to the south, conquering land from Al Andalus (modern Spain). The capital is moved from Jaca to Huesca.

<doc id="42441" wikidata="Q1637433" url="?curid=42441" title="Physical modelling synthesis">
<text>Physical modelling synthesis refers to sound synthesis methods in which the waveform of the sound to be generated is computed using a mathematical model, a set of equations and algorithms to simulate a physical source of sound, usually a musical instrument.

== General methodology ==

Modelling attempts to replicate laws of physics that govern sound production, and will typically have several parameters, some of which are constants that describe the physical materials and dimensions of the instrument, while others are time-dependent functions describing the player&#x27;s interaction with the instrument, such as plucking a string, or covering toneholes.

For example, to model the sound of a drum, there would be a mathematical model of how striking the drumhead injects energy into a two-dimensional membrane. Incorporating this, a larger model would simulate the properties of the membrane (mass density, stiffness, etc.), its coupling with the resonance of the cylindrical body of the drum, and the conditions at its boundaries (a rigid termination to the drum&#x27;s body), describing its movement over time and thus its generation of sound.

Similar stages to be modelled can be found in instruments such as a violin, though the energy excitation in this case is provided by the slip-stick behavior of the bow against the string, the width of the bow, the resonance and damping behavior of the strings, the transfer of string vibrations through the bridge, and finally, the resonance of the soundboard in response to those vibrations.

In addition, the same concept has been applied to simulate voice and speech sounds. In this case, the synthesizer includes mathematical models of the vocal fold oscillation and associated laryngeal airflow, and the consequent acoustic wave propagation along the vocal tract. Further, it may also contain an articulatory model to control the vocal tract shape in terms of the position of the lips, tongue and other organs.

Although physical modelling was not a new concept in acoustics and synthesis, having been implemented using finite difference approximations of the wave equation by Hiller and Ruiz in 1971, it was not until the development of the Karplus-Strong algorithm, the subsequent refinement and generalization of the algorithm into the extremely efficient digital waveguide synthesis by Julius O. Smith III and others, and the increase in DSP power in the late 1980s that commercial implementations became feasible.

Yamaha contracted with Stanford University in 1989 to jointly develop digital waveguide synthesis; subsequently, most patents related to the technology are owned by Stanford or Yamaha.

The first commercially available physical modelling synthesizer made using waveguide synthesis was the Yamaha VL1 in 1994.

While the efficiency of digital waveguide synthesis made physical modelling feasible on common DSP hardware and native processors, the convincing emulation of physical instruments often requires the introduction of non-linear elements, scattering junctions, etc. In these cases, digital waveguides are often combined with FDTD, finite element or wave digital filter methods, increasing the computational demands of the model.

<doc id="42442" wikidata="Q12183745" url="?curid=42442" title="Terrorism in Yemen">
<text>In its war on terrorism in Yemen, the US government describes Yemen as &quot;an important partner in the global war on terrorism&quot;. There have been attacks on civilian targets and tourists, and there was a cargo-plane bomb plot in 2010. Counter-terrorism operations have been conducted by the Yemeni police, the Yemeni military, and the United States Armed Forces.

==Attacks on civilian targets==
===1992 Aden hotel bombings===
===Limburg attack===

In October 2002, near the port of Mukalla, suicide bombers rammed an explosive-laden boat into the &quot;Limburg&quot;, a French oil tanker, killing a Bulgarian crew member and spilling of oil into the Gulf of Aden. Saudi born Abdulraheem al-Nashiri, prime suspect of the USS Cole bombing, paid $40,000 to fund the Limburg attack. With that money, the former Al Qaida leader Abu Ali al-Harithi bought the explosives and transported them from his house in Shabwa to Mukalla in Hadramut.

===Civil Aviation, Meteorological Authority and helicopter attacks===
On 3 November 2002 there was an attack on a helicopter carrying Hunt Oil Co. Employees shortly after taking off from Sana&#x27;a. A missile and a machine gun were fired at the helicopter injuring two American citizens. One person was jailed for the helicopter attack as well as for bombing the Civil Aviation and Meteorological Authority building in Sana&#x27;a.

===Jibla hospital===
On December 30, 2002, a suspected Islamic fundamentalist killed three US workers and wounded one in a hospital in Jibla with a semi-automatic rifle. Two men were eventually convicted and executed for the attack - the gunman Abid Abdulrazzaq Al-Kamil, and the &#x27;mastermind&#x27; Ali Ahmed Mohamed al-Jarallah, who had also been convicted of the 2002 murder of Yemeni politician Jarallah Omar.

===Al-Salem letter threats===
Jews in Yemen reportedly fled their homes due to threats from Muslim extremists. Al-Qaeda members sent letters to 45 Jews living in al-Salem (near Sana&#x27;a) on January 19, 2007, accusing them of involvement in an &quot;international Zionist conspiracy&quot;. The Jewish community sent a complaint to President Ali Abdullah Saleh and temporarily moved to a hotel near Sana&#x27;a. The Yemeni government promised to protect their homes and reassured them that they could return.

===US Embassy===

On September 17, 2008, Al-Qaeda militants attacked the US Embassy in Sana&#x27;a. 20 people were killed, including six militants, six policemen and seven civilians. One American was also among those killed.

===Attacks on tourists===

A suicide bomber killed eight Spanish tourists and their two Yemeni drivers in Ma&#x27;rib on July 2, 2007. On January 18, 2008, Al-Qaeda militants opened fire on a convoy of tourists in Hadhramaut, killing two Belgian tourists, two Yemenis, the tourists&#x27; driver and their guide. In March 2009, four South Korean tourists and their local Yemeni guide were killed. Two attackers also died.

===UAE-run secret prisons===
In the name of punishment, Yemenis are tortured at the hands of Houthis and Saudi Arabia-led military. According to a report published by the Associated Press, the United Arab Emirates runs a network of secret prisons across southern Yemen, where several hundreds of Yemenis on suspicion of being al-Qaida or Islamic State militants are held.

According to former detainees, families of prisoners, civil rights lawyers and Yemeni military officials, there are at least 18 lock-ups hidden away in military bases, air and seaports, the basements of private villas and even a nightclub. Prisoners are held without any charges, with the Yemeni government having no control over these UAE-run prisons.

Beir Ahmed prison in the southern city of Aden is one such prison, where detainees are tortured and sexually assaulted by the UAE officers. Prisoners are electrocuted by their genitals and rocks are hung from their testicles. They are also sexually violated with wooden and steel poles. In March 2018, Emirati officers blind-folded and handcuffed all the detainees of Beir Ahmed prison and made them stand under the sun until noon. The detainees were asked to undress and lie down with their legs spread open. The Emirati forces then touched their genitals and probed their rectums in search of mobile phones.

===Bin Salman mosque bombing===
The Bin Salman mosque was bombed on 2 May 2008 at the Bin Salman Mosque in Sa&#x27;dah, and killed 15 and injured 55. Local officials believed the bomb was hidden in a car or a motorcycle.

Some witnesses said the target may have been the mosque&#x27;s imam, or prayer leader, an army officer who adheres to the Salafi school of Sunni Islam. Witnesses said he was not hurt. Military personnel are among those who usually pray at the Bin Salman mosque, which like others in Yemen caters for both the majority Sunni community and Shia Zaidis.

===Wadi Dawan attack===
On January 18, 2008, there was an ambush attack on Belgian tourists traveling in a convoy through Hadhramaut in the Wadi Dawan desert valley A convoy of four jeeps carrying 15 tourists to Shibam was ambushed by gunmen in a hidden pickup truck. Two Belgian women, Claudine Van Caillie, of Bruges, 63, and Katrine Glorie, from East Flanders, 54, as well as two Yemenis, a driver and a guide, were killed; another man was also heavily wounded, several others suffered minor wounds. The tourists were repatriated to Belgium on January 19, except the injured man, who remained in Sanaa.

In the wake of the attack, Belgian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Karel De Gucht originally rejected that Al-Qaeda might be responsible, explaining that although the possibility could be avoided, internecine disputes and latent Islamism also to be taken into account. A number of arrests were made on January 21. President of the European Council Slovenia released a statement saying &quot;The EU Presidency strongly condemns all forms of violence and calls on the government of Yemen to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice.&quot;

==Military and police counter-terrorism operations==

After the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, President Ali Abdullah Saleh attempted to eliminate the Islamist militant presence. By November 2002, Yemeni government troops had detained 104 suspected al-Qaeda members.

In December 2001 a search by government forces for two Yemenis believed to be senior al-Qaeda members hiding near Ma&#x27;rib led to a gun battle with tribesmen which ended in the deaths of 34 people, including 18 soldiers. To defuse the situation, ten Ma&#x27;rib sheikhs were detained as hostages of the state in the presidential palace for 35 days, until 43 lesser tribesmen took their place.

At the request of the United States, Spanish troops boarded and detained a ship transporting Scud missiles from North Korea to Yemen in December 2002. After two days, when the United States determined that it had no right under international law to continue detaining the shipment, it was allowed to continue on its way to Yemen.

On July 30, 2009, three soldiers were killed in a clash with al-Qaeda militants in Marib province. On December 17 the village of Al Ma`jalah was hit by a cruise missile which killed 41 people, including 14 women and 21 children; 14 were alleged al-Qaeda members. While the Yemeni government initially took responsibility, photographs of American components and a leaked diplomatic cable suggested that it was carried out by the United States. ABC News reported that US cruise missiles were part of the camp bombardment targeting Abu Hureira Qasm al-Rimi. According to a local official and a tribal source, 49 civilians (including 23 women and 17 children) were among those killed in the strike. That day, a clash between security forces and al-Qaeda members in Abhar left four militants dead.

An air raid targeted an al-Qaeda meeting in Wadi Rafadh, Shabwa province on December 24, 2009. Thirty-four al-Qaeda militants were killed in the attack. According to security forces, Saudis and Iranians were among those killed. The number of al-Qaeda members arrested the previous week rose to 29.

==US air attacks==
The US first said that it used targeted killing in November 2002, with the cooperation and approval of the Yemeni government.
In 2004, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC-TV) international-affairs program &quot;Foreign Correspondent&quot; investigated the targeted killing and the involvement of the US ambassador as part of a report entitled &quot;The Yemen Option&quot;. The report examined evolving tactics and countermeasures in dealing with al-Qaeda-inspired attacks.

An estimated 98 US drone attacks were conducted in Yemen from 2002 to 2015: 41 in 2012, 26 in 2013 and 14 in 2014.

===2002 Al-Harethi killing===
Early in 2002 the Bush administration approved sending about 100 Special Operations Forces to Yemen.

Six Yemeni suspected al-Qaeda members were blown up in their car in Marib province in November 2002 by a Hellfire missile from an unmanned CIA Predator drone. Among the dead were Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi (aka Abu Ali al-Harithi), a suspected senior al-Qaeda lieutenant believed to have helped mastermind the October 2000 USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing. Al-Harethi was on a list of targets whose capture or death had been ordered by US President George W. Bush. and Kamal Derwish (aka Ahmed Hijazi), an American.

===2010 al-Shabwani killing===
In May 2010 an errant US drone attack targeting al Qaeda terrorists in Wadi Abida killed five people, including Ma&#x27;rib province deputy governor Jaber al-Shabwani (who was mediating between the government and the militants). The killing angered Shabwani&#x27;s tribesmen and in subsequent weeks they fought government security forces, twice attacking a major oil pipeline in the province.

===2011 airstrikes===
On May 5, 2011, a missile fired from a US drone killed Abdullah and Mosaad Mubarak, brothers who may have been al-Qaeda militants. The missile struck their car, and both died instantly. The strike intended to kill al-Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, but he was not hit in the strike.

On June 3, 2011, American manned jets (or drones) killed Ali Abdullah Naji al-Harithi, a mid-level al-Qaeda operative, and several other militant suspects, including Ammar Abadah Nasser al-Wa&#x27;eli, in a strike in southern Yemen. Four civilians were also reportedly killed in the strike, reportedly coordinated by American special forces and CIA operatives based in Sanaa. According to the Associated Press, in 2011 the US government began building an air base near Yemen from which the CIA and the US military planned to fly drones over Yemen. This base is located at Umm Al Melh, just north of Yemen inside Saudi Arabia. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the US previously used a base in Djibouti to fly drones over Yemen, while &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that a US drone base in the Seychelles could be used to fly drones over Yemen.

According to local residents and unnamed American and Yemeni government officials, on July 14, 2011, US manned aircraft (or drones) attacked and destroyed a police station in Mudiya, Abyan Governorate which had been occupied by al-Qaeda militants. Yemeni media and government accounts conflicted on the number of fatalities, estimated at between 6 and 50. The same day and nearby, drone missiles reportedly hit a car belonging to Yemeni al-Qaeda leader Fahd al-Quso, but al-Quso survived the attack.

On August 1, 2011, US drones and reported Yemeni aircraft attacked three targets with bombs and missiles in southern Yemen, killing 15 suspected al-Qaeda militants and wounding 17 others. Targeted locations included al-Wahdah, al-Amodiah, and al-Khamilah in Abyan Governorate. One of those killed was reportedly militant leader Naser al-Shadadi. According to the &quot;Yemen Post&quot; online newspaper, &quot;At least 35 US drone attacks were reported in Yemen over the last two months&quot;. On August 24, unidentified aircraft attacked suspected al-Qaeda militants near Zinjibar. The strikes reportedly killed 30 militants and wounded 40 others.

According to Yemeni officials, as reported in the &quot;Long War Journal&quot;, US airstrikes in southeast Abyan province from August 30 to September 1 killed 30 AQAP militants reportedly engaged in combat with Yemeni military forces. Two airstrikes by US-operated aircraft on September 21 reportedly killed four AQAP fighters in Abyan and seven AQAP fighters in Shaqra. On September 30 US drone-launched missiles killed four people, including al-Qaeda propagandist Anwar al-Awlaki, in Al Jawf Governorate. The strike also killed Samir Kahn, the American-born editor of &quot;Inspire&quot; magazine. It was the first known time that the US deliberately targeted US citizens in a drone attack.

A reported drone strike in Zinjibar on October 5 killed five AQAP militants. Yemeni government officials said that an October 14 US airstrike killed seven AQAP militants, including Egyptian-born AQAP media chief Ibrahim al-Bana. Eight militants were reportedly killed in an airstrike near Jaar on December 17; a December 22 drone strike near Zinjibar reportedly killed Abdulrahman al-Wuhayshi, a relative of Yemeni al-Qaeda leader Nasir al-Wuhayshi.

===2012 airstrikes===
A reported US airstrike on January 31, 2012, near the city of Lawder in Abyan province killed 11 AQAP militants. The dead reportedly included Abdul Monem al-Fahtani, a participant in the USS &quot;Cole&quot; bombing.
Drones engaged in three attacks in three days on March 9–11, 2012. The first strike targeted an AQAP hideout near Al Baydah, Baydah province, reportedly killing local AQAP leader Abdulwahhab al-Homaiqani and 16 of followers. The second strike, on Jaar in Abyan province, reportedly killed 20 AQAP fighters. The third strike, also on Jaar, reportedly killed three AQAP militants and targeted a storage location for weapons seized by AQAP after it overran a Yemeni military base in Al Koud the previous week. A fourth drone strike, on March 14 in Al Bydah, reportedly killed four AQAP militants in a vehicle.

On April 11, 14 militants were killed in a drone strike in the town of Lauder (northeast of Zinjibar in Abyan province). An April 22 drone strike in the Al Samadah area, near the border of Marib and Al Jawf provinces, killed AQAP senior leader Mohammed Saeed al Umda (also known as Ghareeb al Taizi). A suspected US drone strike killed Fahd Mohammed Ahmed al-Quso and another al-Qaida militant in southern Shabwa province on May 6.

===2013 Rada&#x27; wedding convoy strike===
On December 12, 2013, 17 people in a wedding convoy were killed in the Rada&#x27; District of the Governorate of Al-Bayda&#x27;. The US drone mistakenly targeted the wedding convoy after intelligence reports identified the vehicles as carrying suspected AQAP members. Although five of the killed were suspects, the remainder were civilians.

===2014 airstrikes===
On March 3, 2014, an airstrike believed carried out by an American drone killed three suspected AQAP members. Mujahid Gaber Saleh al Shabwani, one of Yemen&#x27;s 25 most-wanted AQAP operatives, was thought to have been one of those killed. According to a statement released by the Yemeni Interior Ministry, on April 20–21 three US drone strikes killed at least two dozen suspected AQAP members and destroyed one of the group&#x27;s training camps in southern Yemen. Five civilians were wounded and three killed in the attack. A June 13 suspected US drone strike targeted a car in the Mafraq al-Saeed region of Shabwah province, killing the five alleged AQAP operatives inside.

<text>The dalton or unified atomic mass unit (symbols: Da or u, respectively) is a unit of mass defined as of the mass of an unbound neutral atom of carbon-12 in its nuclear and electronic ground state and at rest. It is a non-SI unit accepted for use with SI. The atomic mass constant, denoted &quot;m&quot;u, is defined identically, giving .

This unit is commonly used in physics and chemistry to express the mass of atomic-scale objects, such as atoms, molecules, and elementary particles, both for discrete instances and multiple types of ensemble averages. For example, an atom of helium-4 has a mass of . This is an intrinsic property of the isotope and all helium-4 atoms have the same mass. Acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), , has an average mass of about . However, there are no acetylsalicylic acid molecules with this mass. The two most common masses of individual acetylsalicylic acid molecules are , having the most common isotopes, and , in which one carbon is carbon-13.

The molecular masses of proteins, nucleic acids, and other large polymers are often expressed with the unit kilodalton (kDa) and megadalton (MDa). Titin, one of the largest known proteins, has a molecular mass of between 3 and 3.7 megadaltons. The DNA of chromosome 1 in the human genome has about 249 million base pairs, each with an average mass of about , or total.

The mole is a unit of amount of substance used in chemistry and physics, such that the mass of one mole of a substance expressed in grams is numerically equal to the average mass of one of its particles expressed in daltons. That is, the molar mass of a chemical compound expressed in g/mol or kg/kmol is numerically equal to its average molecular mass expressed in Da. For example, the average mass of one molecule of water is about 18.0153 Da, and the mass of one mole of water is about 18.0153 g. A protein whose molecule has an average mass of would have a molar mass of . However, while this equality can be assumed for practical purposes, it is only approximate, because of the 2019 redefinition of the mole.

In general, the mass in daltons of an atom is numerically close but not exactly equal to the number of nucleons in its nucleus. It follows that the molar mass of a compound (grams per mole) is numerically close to the average number of nucleons contained in each molecule. By definition, the mass of an atom of carbon-12 is 12 daltons, which corresponds with the number of nucleons that it has (6 protons and 6 neutrons). However, the mass of an atomic-scale object is affected by the binding energy of the nucleons in its atomic nuclei, as well as the mass and binding energy of its electrons. Therefore, this equality holds only for the carbon-12 atom in the stated conditions, and will vary for other substances. For example, the mass of an unbound atom of the common hydrogen isotope (hydrogen-1, protium) is ,
the mass of a proton is the mass of a free neutron is and the mass of a hydrogen-2 (deuterium) atom is . In general, the difference (absolute mass excess) is less than 0.1%; exceptions include hydrogen-1 (about 0.8%), helium-3 (0.5%), lithium-6 (0.25%) and beryllium (0.14%).

The dalton differs from the unit of mass in the system of atomic units, which is the electron rest mass (&quot;m&quot;).

== Energy equivalents ==
The atomic mass constant can also be expressed as its energy-equivalent, &quot;m&quot;&quot;c&quot;. The CODATA recommended values are:

The mass-equivalent is commonly used in place of a unit of mass in particle physics, and these values are also important for the practical determination of relative atomic masses.

== History ==

=== Origin of the concept ===
The interpretation of the law of definite proportions in terms of the atomic theory of matter implied that the masses of atoms of various elements had definite ratios that depended on the elements. While the actual masses were unknown, the relative masses could be deduced from that law. In 1803 John Dalton proposed to use the (still unknown) atomic mass of the lightest atom, hydrogen, as the natural unit of atomic mass. This was the basis of the atomic weight scale.

For technical reasons, in 1898, chemist Wilhelm Ostwald and others proposed to redefine the unit of atomic mass as the mass of an oxygen atom. That proposal was formally adopted by the International Committee on Atomic Weights (ICAW) in 1903. That was approximately the mass of one hydrogen atom, but oxygen was more amenable to experimental determination. This suggestion was made before the discovery of isotopes in 1912. Physicist Jean Perrin had adopted the same definition in 1909 during his experiments to determine the atomic masses and the Avogadro constant. This definition remained unchanged until 1961. Perrin also defined the &quot;mole&quot; as an amount of a compound that contained as many molecules as 32 grams of oxygen (). He called that number the Avogadro number in honor of physicist Amedeo Avogadro.

=== Isotopic variation ===
The discovery of isotopes of oxygen in 1929 required a more precise definition of the unit. Two distinct definitions came into use. Chemists choose to define the AMU as of the average mass of an oxygen atom as found in nature; that is, the average of the masses of the known isotopes, weighted by their natural abundance. Physicists, on the other hand, defined it as of the mass of an atom of the isotope oxygen-16 (16O).

=== Definition by IUPAC ===

The existence of two distinct units with the same name was confusing, and the difference (about in relative terms) was large enough to affect high-precision measurements. Moreover, it was discovered that the isotopes of oxygen had different natural abundances in water and in air. For these and other reasons, in 1961 the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), which had absorbed the ICAW, adopted a new definition of the atomic mass unit for use in both physics and chemistry; namely, of the mass of a carbon-12 atom. This new value was intermediate between the two earlier definitions, but closer to the one used by chemists (who would be affected the most by the change).

The new unit was named the &quot;unified atomic mass unit&quot; and given a new symbol &quot;u&quot;, to replace the old &quot;amu&quot; that had been used for the oxygen-based unit. However, the old symbol &quot;amu&quot; has sometimes been used, after 1961, to refer to the new unit, particularly in lay and preparatory contexts.

With this new definition, the standard atomic weight of carbon is about , and that of oxygen is about . These values, generally used in chemistry, are based on averages of many samples from Earth&#x27;s crust, its atmosphere, and organic materials.

=== Adoption by BIPM ===

The IUPAC 1961 definition of the unified atomic mass unit, with that name and symbol &quot;u&quot;, was adopted by the International Bureau for Weights and Measures (BIPM) in 1971 as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI.

=== Unit name ===
In 1993, the IUPAC proposed the shorter name &quot;dalton&quot; (with symbol &quot;Da&quot;) for the unified atomic mass unit. As with other unit names such as watt and newton, &quot;dalton&quot; is not capitalized in English, but its symbol, &quot;Da&quot;, is capitalized. The name was endorsed by the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) in 2005.

In 2003 the name was recommended to the BIPM by the Consultative Committee for Units, part of the CIPM, as it &quot;is shorter and works better with [SI] prefixes&quot;. In 2006, the BIPM included the dalton in its 8th edition of the SI brochure of formal definitions as a non-SI unit accepted for use with the SI. The name was also listed as an alternative to &quot;unified atomic mass unit&quot; by the International Organization for Standardization in 2009. It is now recommended by several scientific publishers, and some of them consider &quot;atomic mass unit&quot; and &quot;amu&quot; deprecated. In 2019, the BIPM retained the dalton in its 9th edition of the SI brochure, while dropping the unified atomic mass unit from its table of non-SI units accepted for use with the SI, but secondarily notes that the dalton (Da) and the unified atomic mass unit (u) are alternative names (and symbols) for the same unit.

=== 2019 revision of the SI ===
The definition of the dalton was not affected by the 2019 revision of the SI, that is, 1 Da in the SI is still of the mass of a carbon-12 atom, a quantity that must be determined experimentally in terms of SI units. However, the definition of a mole was changed to be the amount of substance consisting of exactly entities and the definition of the kilogram was changed as well. As a consequence, the molar mass constant remains close to but no longer exactly 1 g/mol, meaning that the mass in grams of one mole of any substance remains nearly but no longer exactly numerically equal to its average molecular mass in daltons, although the relative standard uncertainty of at the time of the redefinition is insignificant for all practical purposes. One entity, symbol ent, is the smallest amount of any substance (retaining its chemical properties). One mole is an aggregate of an Avogadro number of entities, 1 mol = &quot;N&quot;0 ent. This means that the appropriate atomic-scale unit for molar mass is dalton per entity, Da/ent = &quot;M&quot;u, very nearly equal to 1 g/mol. For Da/ent to be exactly equal to g/mol, the dalton would need to be redefined exactly in terms of the (fixed-&quot;h&quot;) kilogram. Then, in addition to the identity g = (g/Da) Da, we would have the parallel relationship mol = (g/Da) ent = &quot;N&quot;0 ent, conforming to the original mole concept—that the Avogadro number is the gram-to-dalton mass unit ratio. 

== Measurement ==
Though relative atomic masses are defined for neutral atoms, they are measured (by mass spectrometry) for ions: hence, the measured values must be corrected for the mass of the electrons that were removed to form the ions, and also for the mass equivalent of the electron binding energy, &quot;E&quot;/&quot;m&quot;&quot;c&quot;. The total binding energy of the six electrons in a carbon-12 atom is  = : &quot;E&quot;b/&quot;m&quot;u&quot;c&quot;2 = , or about one part in 10 million of the mass of the atom.

Before the 2019 revision of the SI, experiments were aimed to determine the value of the Avogadro constant for finding the value of the unified atomic mass unit.

=== Josef Loschmidt ===

A reasonably accurate value of the atomic mass unit was first obtained indirectly by Josef Loschmidt in 1865, by estimating the number of particles in a given volume of gas.

=== Jean Perrin ===
Perrin estimated the Avogadro number by a variety of methods, at the turn of the 20th century. He was awarded the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, largely for this work.

=== Coulometry ===

The electric charge per mole of elementary charges is a constant called the Faraday constant, &quot;F&quot;, whose value had been essentially known since 1834 when Michael Faraday published his works on electrolysis. In 1910, Robert Millikan obtained the first measurement of the charge on an electron, −&quot;e&quot;. The quotient &quot;F&quot;/&quot;e&quot; provided an estimate of the Avogadro constant.

The classic experiment is that of Bower and Davis at NIST, and relies on dissolving silver metal away from the anode of an electrolysis cell, while passing a constant electric current &quot;I&quot; for a known time &quot;t&quot;. If &quot;m&quot; is the mass of silver lost from the anode and &quot;A&quot; the atomic weight of silver, then the Faraday constant is given by:

The NIST scientists devised a method to compensate for silver lost from the anode by mechanical causes, and conducted an isotope analysis of the silver used to determine its atomic weight. Their value for the conventional Faraday constant was &quot;F&quot; = , which corresponds to a value for the Avogadro constant of : both values have a relative standard uncertainty of .

=== Electron mass measurement ===
In practice, the atomic mass constant is determined from the electron rest mass &quot;m&quot; and the electron relative atomic mass &quot;A&quot;(e) (that is, the mass of electron divided by the atomic mass constant). The relative atomic mass of the electron can be measured in cyclotron experiments, while the rest mass of the electron can be derived from other physical constants.
{A_{\rm r}({\rm e})} = \frac{2R_\infty h}{A_{\rm r}({\rm e})c\alpha^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;}}
{N_{\rm A}} ,&lt;/math&gt;}}
 = \frac{M_{\rm u} A_{\rm r}({\rm e})c\alpha^2}{2R_\infty h} ,&lt;/math&gt;}}
where &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, &quot;α&quot; is the fine-structure constant, and &quot;R&quot; is the Rydberg constant.

As may be observed from the old values (2014 CODATA) in the table below, the main limiting factor in the precision of the Avogadro constant was the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant, as all the other constants that contribute to the calculation were known more precisely.
The power of having defined values of universal constants as is presently the case can be understood from the table below (2018 CODATA).

=== X-ray crystal density methods ===

Silicon single crystals may be produced today in commercial facilities with extremely high purity and with few lattice defects. This method defined the Avogadro constant as the ratio of the molar volume, &quot;V&quot;, to the atomic volume &quot;V&quot;:
formula_1
where and &quot;n&quot; is the number of atoms per unit cell of volume &quot;V&quot;cell.

The unit cell of silicon has a cubic packing arrangement of 8 atoms, and the unit cell volume may be measured by determining a single unit cell parameter, the length &quot;a&quot; of one of the sides of the cube. The CODATA value of &quot;a&quot; for silicon is 

In practice, measurements are carried out on a distance known as &quot;d&quot;(Si), which is the distance between the planes denoted by the Miller indices {220}, and is equal to .

The isotope proportional composition of the sample used must be measured and taken into account. Silicon occurs in three stable isotopes (Si, Si, Si), and the natural variation in their proportions is greater than other uncertainties in the measurements. The atomic weight &quot;A&quot; for the sample crystal can be calculated, as the standard atomic weights of the three nuclides are known with great accuracy. This, together with the measured density &quot;ρ&quot; of the sample, allows the molar volume &quot;V&quot; to be determined:
formula_2
where &quot;M&quot; is the molar mass constant. The CODATA value for the molar volume of silicon is , with a relative standard uncertainty of

<text>Reason is the capacity of consciously applying logic by drawing valid conclusions from new or existing information, with the aim of seeking the truth. It is associated with such characteristically human activities as philosophy, religion, science, language, mathematics, and art, and is normally considered to be a distinguishing ability possessed by humans. Reason is sometimes referred to as rationality.

Reasoning involves using more-or-less rational processes of thinking and cognition to extrapolate from one&#x27;s existing knowledge to generate new knowledge, and involves the use of one&#x27;s intellect. The field of logic studies the ways in which humans can use formal reasoning to produce logically valid arguments and true conclusions. Reasoning may be subdivided into forms of logical reasoning, such as deductive reasoning, inductive reasoning, and abductive reasoning.

Aristotle drew a distinction between logical discursive reasoning (reason proper), and intuitive reasoning, in which the reasoning process through intuition—however valid—may tend toward the personal and the subjectively opaque. In some social and political settings logical and intuitive modes of reasoning may clash, while in other contexts intuition and formal reason are seen as complementary rather than adversarial. For example, in mathematics, intuition is often necessary for the creative processes involved with arriving at a formal proof, arguably the most difficult of formal reasoning tasks.

Reasoning, like habit or intuition, is one of the ways by which thinking moves from one idea to a related idea. For example, reasoning is the means by which rational individuals understand the significance of sensory information from their environments, or conceptualize abstract dichotomies such as cause and effect, truth and falsehood, or good and evil. Reasoning, as a part of executive decision making, is also closely identified with the ability to self-consciously change, in terms of goals, beliefs, attitudes, traditions, and institutions, and therefore with the capacity for freedom and self-determination.

Psychologists and cognitive scientists have attempted to study and explain how people reason, e.g. which cognitive and neural processes are engaged, and how cultural factors affect the inferences that people draw. The field of automated reasoning studies how reasoning may or may not be modeled computationally. Animal psychology considers the question of whether animals other than humans can reason.

==Etymology and related words==
In the English language and other modern European languages, &quot;reason&quot;, and related words, represent words which have always been used to translate Latin and classical Greek terms in their philosophical sense.
* The original Greek term was , the root of the modern English word &quot;logic&quot; but also a word that could mean for example &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;explanation&quot; or an &quot;account&quot; (of money handled).
* As a philosophical term was translated in its non-linguistic senses in Latin as . This was originally not just a translation used for philosophy, but was also commonly a translation for in the sense of an account of money.
* French is derived directly from Latin, and this is the direct source of the English word &quot;reason&quot;.

The earliest major philosophers to publish in English, such as Francis Bacon, Thomas Hobbes, and John Locke also routinely wrote in Latin and French, and compared their terms to Greek, treating the words &quot;, &quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;reason&quot; as interchangeable. The meaning of the word &quot;reason&quot; in senses such as &quot;human reason&quot; also overlaps to a large extent with &quot;rationality&quot; and the adjective of &quot;reason&quot; in philosophical contexts is normally &quot;rational&quot;, rather than &quot;reasoned&quot; or &quot;reasonable&quot;. Some philosophers, Hobbes for example, also used the word ratiocination as a synonym for &quot;reasoning&quot;.

In contrast to the use of &quot;reason&quot; as an abstract noun, &quot;a&quot; reason is a consideration that either explains or justifies events, phenomena, or behavior. Reasons justify decisions, reasons support explanations of natural phenomena, and reasons can be given to explain the actions (conduct) of individuals.

The words are connected in this way: using reason, or reasoning, means providing good reasons. For example, when evaluating a moral decision, &quot;morality is, at the very least, the effort to guide one&#x27;s conduct by &quot;reason&quot;—that is, doing what there are the best reasons for doing—while giving equal [and impartial] weight to the interests of all those affected by what one does.&quot;

==Philosophical history==

The proposal that reason gives humanity a special position in nature has been argued to be a defining characteristic of western philosophy and later western science, starting with classical Greece. Philosophy can be described as a way of life based upon reason, while reason has been among the major subjects of philosophical discussion since ancient times. Reason is often said to be reflexive, or &quot;self-correcting&quot;, and the critique of reason has been a persistent theme in philosophy.

===Classical philosophy===
For many classical philosophers, nature was understood teleologically, meaning that every type of thing had a definitive purpose that fit within a natural order that was itself understood to have aims. Perhaps starting with Pythagoras or Heraclitus, the cosmos was even said to have reason. Reason, by this account, is not just a characteristic that people happen to have. Reason was considered of higher stature than other characteristics of human nature, because it is something people share with nature itself, linking an apparently immortal part of the human mind with the divine order of the cosmos. Within the human mind or soul (), reason was described by Plato as being the natural monarch which should rule over the other parts, such as spiritedness () and the passions. Aristotle, Plato&#x27;s student, defined human beings as rational animals, emphasizing reason as a characteristic of human nature. He described the highest human happiness or well being () as a life which is lived consistently, excellently, and completely in accordance with reason.

The conclusions to be drawn from the discussions of Aristotle and Plato on this matter are amongst the most debated in the history of philosophy. But teleological accounts such as Aristotle&#x27;s were highly influential for those who attempt to explain reason in a way that is consistent with monotheism and the immortality and divinity of the human soul. For example, in the neoplatonist account of Plotinus, the cosmos has one soul, which is the seat of all reason, and the souls of all people are part of this soul. Reason is for Plotinus both the provider of form to material things, and the light which brings people&#x27;s souls back into line with their source.

===Christian and Islamic philosophy===

The classical view of reason, like many important Neoplatonic and Stoic ideas, was readily adopted by the early Church as the Church Fathers saw Greek Philosophy as an indispensable instrument given to mankind so that we may understand revelation. For example, the greatest among the early Church Fathers and Doctors of the Church such as Augustine of Hippo, Basil of Caesarea, and Gregory of Nyssa were as much Neoplatonic philosophers as they were Christian theologians, and they adopted the Neoplatonic view of human reason and its implications for our relationship to creation, to ourselves, and to God.

The Neoplatonic conception of the rational aspect of the human soul was widely adopted by medieval Islamic philosophers and continues to hold significance in Iranian philosophy. As European intellectual life reemerged from the Dark Ages, the Christian Patristic tradition and the influence of esteemed Islamic scholars like Averroes and Avicenna contributed to the development of the Scholastic view of reason, which laid the foundation for our modern understanding of this concept.

Among the Scholastics who relied on the classical concept of reason for the development of their doctrines, none were more influential than Saint Thomas Aquinas, who put this concept at the heart of his Natural Law. In this doctrine, Thomas concludes that because humans have reason and because reason is a spark of the divine, every single human life is invaluable, all humans are equal, and every human is born with an intrinsic and permanent set of basic rights. On this foundation, the idea of human rights would later be constructed by Spanish theologians at the School of Salamanca.

Other Scholastics, such as Roger Bacon and Albertus Magnus, following the example of Islamic scholars such as Alhazen, emphasised reason an intrinsic human ability to decode the created order and the structures that underlie our experienced physical reality. This interpretation of reason was instrumental to the development of the scientific method in the early Universities of the high Middle Ages.

===Subject-centred reason in early modern philosophy===

The early modern era was marked by a number of significant changes in the understanding of reason, starting in Europe. One of the most important of these changes involved a change in the metaphysical understanding of human beings. Scientists and philosophers began to question the teleological understanding of the world. Nature was no longer assumed to be human-like, with its own aims or reason, and human nature was no longer assumed to work according to anything other than the same &quot;laws of nature&quot; which affect inanimate things. This new understanding eventually displaced the previous world view that derived from a spiritual understanding of the universe.

Accordingly, in the 17th century, René Descartes explicitly rejected the traditional notion of humans as &quot;rational animals&quot;, suggesting instead that they are nothing more than &quot;thinking things&quot; along the lines of other &quot;things&quot; in nature. Any grounds of knowledge outside that understanding was, therefore, subject to doubt.

In his search for a foundation of all possible knowledge, Descartes decided to throw into doubt &quot;all&quot; knowledge—&quot;except&quot; that of the mind itself in the process of thinking:

At this time I admit nothing that is not necessarily true. I am therefore precisely nothing but a thinking thing; that is a mind, or intellect, or understanding, or reason—words of whose meanings I was previously ignorant.

This eventually became known as epistemological or &quot;subject-centred&quot; reason, because it is based on the &quot;knowing subject&quot;, who perceives the rest of the world and itself as a set of objects to be studied, and successfully mastered, by applying the knowledge accumulated through such study. Breaking with tradition and with many thinkers after him, Descartes explicitly did not divide the incorporeal soul into parts, such as reason and intellect, describing them instead as one indivisible incorporeal entity.

A contemporary of Descartes, Thomas Hobbes described reason as a broader version of &quot;addition and subtraction&quot; which is not limited to numbers. This understanding of reason is sometimes termed &quot;calculative&quot; reason. Similar to Descartes, Hobbes asserted that &quot;No discourse whatsoever, can end in absolute knowledge of fact, past, or to come&quot; but that &quot;sense and memory&quot; is absolute knowledge.

In the late 17th century through the 18th century, John Locke and David Hume developed Descartes&#x27;s line of thought still further. Hume took it in an especially skeptical direction, proposing that there could be no possibility of deducing relationships of cause and effect, and therefore no knowledge is based on reasoning alone, even if it seems otherwise.

Hume famously remarked that, &quot;We speak not strictly and philosophically when we talk of the combat of passion and of reason. Reason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them.&quot; Hume also took his definition of reason to unorthodox extremes by arguing, unlike his predecessors, that human reason is not qualitatively different from either simply conceiving individual ideas, or from judgments associating two ideas, and that &quot;reason is nothing but a wonderful and unintelligible instinct in our souls, which carries us along a certain train of ideas, and endows them with particular qualities, according to their particular situations and relations.&quot; It followed from this that animals have reason, only much less complex than human reason.

In the 18th century, Immanuel Kant attempted to show that Hume was wrong by demonstrating that a &quot;transcendental&quot; self, or &quot;I&quot;, was a necessary condition of all experience. Therefore, suggested Kant, on the basis of such a self, it is in fact possible to reason both about the conditions and limits of human knowledge. And so long as these limits are respected, reason can be the vehicle of morality, justice, aesthetics, theories of knowledge (epistemology), and understanding.

===Substantive and formal reason===

In the formulation of Kant, who wrote some of the most influential modern treatises on the subject, the great achievement of reason () is that it is able to exercise a kind of universal law-making. Kant was able therefore to reformulate the basis of moral-practical, theoretical, and aesthetic reasoning on &quot;universal&quot; laws.

Here, practical reasoning is the self-legislating or self-governing formulation of universal norms, and theoretical reasoning is the way humans posit universal laws of nature.

Under practical reason, the moral autonomy or freedom of people depends on their ability, by the proper exercise of that reason, to behave according to laws that are given to them. This contrasted with earlier forms of morality, which depended on religious understanding and interpretation, or on nature, for their substance.

According to Kant, in a free society each individual must be able to pursue their goals however they see fit, as long as their actions conform to principles given by reason. He formulated such a principle, called the &quot;categorical imperative&quot;, which would justify an action only if it could be universalized:
Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law.

In contrast to Hume, Kant insisted that reason itself (German ) could be used to find solutions to metaphysical problems, especially the discovery of the foundations of morality. Kant claimed that these solutions could be found with his &quot;transcendental logic&quot;, which unlike normal logic is not just an instrument that can be used indifferently, as it was for Aristotle, but a theoretical science in its own right and the basis of all the others.

According to Jürgen Habermas, the &quot;substantive unity&quot; of reason has dissolved in modern times, such that it can no longer answer the question &quot;How should I live?&quot; Instead, the unity of reason has to be strictly formal, or &quot;procedural&quot;. He thus described reason as a group of three autonomous spheres (on the model of Kant&#x27;s three critiques):

; Cognitive–instrumental reason: the kind of reason employed by the sciences; used to observe events, to predict and control outcomes, and to intervene in the world on the basis of its hypotheses
; Moral–practical reason: what we use to deliberate and discuss issues in the moral and political realm, according to universalizable procedures (similar to Kant&#x27;s categorical imperative)
; Aesthetic reason: typically found in works of art and literature, and encompasses the novel ways of seeing the world and interpreting things that those practices embody

For Habermas, these three spheres are the domain of experts, and therefore need to be mediated with the &quot;lifeworld&quot; by philosophers. In drawing such a picture of reason, Habermas hoped to demonstrate that the substantive unity of reason, which in pre-modern societies had been able to answer questions about the good life, could be made up for by the unity of reason&#x27;s formalizable procedures.

===The critique of reason===

Hamann, Herder, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Foucault, Rorty, and many other philosophers have contributed to a debate about what reason means, or ought to mean. Some, like Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Rorty, are skeptical about subject-centred, universal, or instrumental reason, and even skeptical toward reason as a whole. Others, including Hegel, believe that it has obscured the importance of intersubjectivity, or &quot;spirit&quot; in human life, and they attempt to reconstruct a model of what reason should be.

Some thinkers, e.g. Foucault, believe there are other &quot;forms&quot; of reason, neglected but essential to modern life, and to our understanding of what it means to live a life according to reason. Others suggest that there is not just one reason or rationality, but multiple possible systems of reason or rationality which may conflict (in which case there is no super-rational system one can appeal to in order to resolve the conflict).

In the last several decades, a number of proposals have been made to &quot;re-orient&quot; this critique of reason, or to recognize the &quot;other voices&quot; or &quot;new departments&quot; of reason:

For example, in opposition to subject-centred reason, Habermas has proposed a model of communicative reason that sees it as an essentially cooperative activity, based on the fact of linguistic intersubjectivity.

Nikolas Kompridis proposed a widely encompassing view of reason as &quot;that ensemble of practices that contributes to the opening and preserving of openness&quot; in human affairs, and a focus on reason&#x27;s possibilities for social change.

The philosopher Charles Taylor, influenced by the 20th century German philosopher Martin Heidegger, proposed that reason ought to include the faculty of disclosure, which is tied to the way we make sense of things in everyday life, as a new &quot;department&quot; of reason.

In the essay &quot;What is Enlightenment?&quot;, Michel Foucault proposed a critique based on Kant&#x27;s distinction between &quot;private&quot; and &quot;public&quot; uses of reason:
; Private reason : the reason that is used when an individual is &quot;a cog in a machine&quot; or when one &quot;has a role to play in society and jobs to do: to be a soldier, to have taxes to pay, to be in charge of a parish, to be a civil servant&quot;
; Public reason : the reason used &quot;when one is reasoning as a reasonable being (and not as a cog in a machine), when one is reasoning as a member of reasonable humanity&quot;; in these circumstances, &quot;the use of reason must be free and public&quot;

==Reason compared to related concepts==

===Reason compared to logic===

The terms &quot;logic&quot; or &quot;logical&quot; are sometimes used as if they were identical with &quot;reason&quot; or &quot;rational&quot;, or sometimes logic is seen as the most pure or the defining form of reason: &quot;Logic is about reasoning—about going from premises to a conclusion. ... When you do logic, you try to clarify reasoning and separate good from bad reasoning.&quot; In modern economics, rational choice is assumed to equate to logically consistent choice.

However, reason and logic can be thought of as distinct—although logic is one important aspect of reason. Author Douglas Hofstadter, in &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;, characterizes the distinction in this way: Logic is done inside a system while reason is done outside the system by such methods as skipping steps, working backward, drawing diagrams, looking at examples, or seeing what happens if you change the rules of the system. Psychologists Mark H. Bickard and Robert L. Campbell argue that &quot;rationality cannot be simply assimilated to logicality&quot;; they note that &quot;human knowledge of logic and logical systems has developed&quot; over time through reasoning, and logical systems &quot;can&#x27;t construct new logical systems more powerful than themselves&quot;, so reasoning and rationality must involve more than a system of logic. Psychologist David Moshman, citing Bickhard and Campbell, argues for a &quot;metacognitive conception of rationality&quot; in which a person&#x27;s development of reason &quot;involves increasing consciousness and control of logical and other inferences&quot;.

Reason is a type of thought, and logic involves the attempt to describe a system of formal rules or norms of appropriate reasoning. The oldest surviving writing to explicitly consider the rules by which reason operates are the works of the Greek philosopher Aristotle, especially &quot;Prior Analytics&quot; and &quot;Posterior Analytics&quot;. Although the Ancient Greeks had no separate word for logic as distinct from language and reason, Aristotle&#x27;s newly coined word &quot;syllogism&quot; () identified logic clearly for the first time as a distinct field of study. When Aristotle referred to &quot;the logical&quot; (), he was referring more broadly to rational thought.

===Reason compared to cause-and-effect thinking, and symbolic thinking===

As pointed out by philosophers such as Hobbes, Locke, and Hume, some animals are also clearly capable of a type of &quot;associative thinking&quot;, even to the extent of associating causes and effects. A dog once kicked, can learn how to recognize the warning signs and avoid being kicked in the future, but this does not mean the dog has reason in any strict sense of the word. It also does not mean that humans acting on the basis of experience or habit are using their reason.

Human reason requires more than being able to associate two ideas—even if those two ideas might be described by a reasoning human as a cause and an effect—perceptions of smoke, for example, and memories of fire. For reason to be involved, the association of smoke and the fire would have to be thought through in a way that can be explained, for example as cause and effect. In the explanation of Locke, for example, reason requires the mental use of a third idea in order to make this comparison by use of syllogism.

More generally, according to Charles Sanders Peirce, reason in the strict sense requires the ability to create and manipulate a system of symbols, as well as indices and icons, the symbols having only a nominal, though habitual, connection to either (for example) smoke or fire. One example of such a system of symbols and signs is language.

The connection of reason to symbolic thinking has been expressed in different ways by philosophers. Thomas Hobbes described the creation of &quot;Markes, or Notes of remembrance&quot; as &quot;speech&quot;. He used the word &quot;speech&quot; as an English version of the Greek word so that speech did not need to be communicated. When communicated, such speech becomes language, and the marks or notes or remembrance are called &quot;Signes&quot; by Hobbes. Going further back, although Aristotle is a source of the idea that only humans have reason (), he does mention that animals with imagination, for whom sense perceptions can persist, come closest to having something like reasoning and , and even uses the word &quot;&quot; in one place to describe the distinctions which animals can perceive in such cases.

===Reason, imagination, mimesis, and memory===

Reason and imagination rely on similar mental processes. Imagination is not only found in humans. Aristotle asserted that (imagination: that which can hold images or ) and (a type of thinking that can judge and understand in some sense) also exist in some animals. According to him, both are related to the primary perceptive ability of animals, which gathers the perceptions of different senses and defines the order of the things that are perceived without distinguishing universals, and without deliberation or . But this is not yet reason, because human imagination is different.

Terrence Deacon and Merlin Donald, writing about the origin of language, connect reason not only to language, but also mimesis. They describe the ability to create language as part of an internal modeling of reality, and specific to humankind. Other results are consciousness, and imagination or fantasy. In contrast, modern proponents of a genetic predisposition to language itself include Noam Chomsky and Steven Pinker.

If reason is symbolic thinking, and peculiarly human, then this implies that humans have a special ability to maintain a clear consciousness of the distinctness of &quot;icons&quot; or images and the real things they represent. Merlin Donald writes:
A dog might perceive the &quot;meaning&quot; of a fight that was realistically play-acted by humans, but it could not reconstruct the message or distinguish the representation from its referent (a real fight)... Trained apes are able to make this distinction; young children make this distinction early—hence, their effortless distinction between play-acting an event and the event itself

In classical descriptions, an equivalent description of this mental faculty is , in the philosophy of Plato. This is the ability to perceive whether a perception is an image of something else, related somehow but not the same, and therefore allows humans to perceive that a dream or memory or a reflection in a mirror is not reality as such. What Klein refers to as is the concerned specifically with thinking and mental images, such as those mental symbols, icons, &quot;&quot;, and marks discussed above as definitive of reason. Explaining reason from this direction: human thinking is special in that we often understand visible things as if they were themselves images of our intelligible &quot;objects of thought&quot; as &quot;foundations&quot; ( in Ancient Greek). This thinking () is &quot;...an activity which consists in making the vast and diffuse jungle of the visible world depend on a plurality of more &#x27;precise&#x27; &quot;.

Both Merlin Donald and the Socratic authors such as Plato and Aristotle emphasize the importance of , often translated as &quot;imitation&quot; or &quot;representation&quot;. Donald writes:
Imitation is found especially in monkeys and apes [...but...] Mimesis is fundamentally different from imitation and mimicry in that it involves the invention of intentional representations... Mimesis is not absolutely tied to external communication.

 is a concept, now popular again in academic discussion, that was particularly prevalent in Plato&#x27;s works. In Aristotle, it is discussed mainly in the &quot;Poetics&quot;. In Michael Davis&#x27;s account of the theory of man in that work:
It is the distinctive feature of human action, that whenever we choose what we do, we imagine an action for ourselves as though we were inspecting it from the outside. Intentions are nothing more than imagined actions, internalizings of the external. All action is therefore imitation of action; it is poetic...

Donald, like Plato (and Aristotle, especially in &quot;On Memory and Recollection&quot;), emphasizes the peculiarity in humans of voluntary initiation of a search through one&#x27;s mental world. The ancient Greek , normally translated as &quot;recollection&quot; was opposed to or &quot;memory&quot;. Memory, shared with some animals, requires a consciousness not only of what happened in the past, but also &quot;that&quot; something happened in the past, which is in other words a kind of &quot;...but nothing except man is able to recollect.&quot; Recollection is a deliberate effort to search for and recapture something once known. Klein writes that, &quot;To become aware of our having forgotten something means to begin recollecting.&quot; Donald calls the same thing &quot;autocueing&quot;, which he explains as follows: &quot;Mimetic acts are reproducible on the basis of internal, self-generated cues. This permits voluntary recall of mimetic representations, without the aid of external cues—probably the earliest form of representational &quot;thinking&quot;.&quot;

In a celebrated paper, the fantasy author and philologist J.R.R. Tolkien wrote in his essay &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot; that the terms &quot;fantasy&quot; and &quot;enchantment&quot; are connected to not only &quot;the satisfaction of certain primordial human desires&quot; but also &quot;the origin of language and of the mind&quot;.

===Logical reasoning methods and argumentation===

A subdivision of philosophy and a variety of reasoning is logic. The traditional main division made in philosophy is between deductive reasoning and inductive reasoning. Formal logic has been described as &quot;the science of deduction&quot;. The study of inductive reasoning is generally carried out within the field known as informal logic or critical thinking.

====Deductive reasoning====

Deduction is a form of reasoning in which a conclusion follows necessarily from the stated premises. A deduction is also the name for the conclusion reached by a deductive reasoning process. A classic example of deductive reasoning is evident in syllogisms like the following:

The reasoning in this argument is deductively valid because there is no way in which both premises could be true and the conclusion be false.

====Inductive reasoning====

Induction is a form of inference that produces properties or relations about unobserved objects or types based on previous observations or experiences, or that formulates general statements or laws based on limited observations of recurring phenomenal patterns.

Inductive reasoning contrasts with deductive reasoning in that, even in the strongest cases of inductive reasoning, the truth of the premises does not guarantee the truth of the conclusion. Instead, the conclusion of an inductive argument follows with some degree of probability. For this reason also, the conclusion of an inductive argument contains more information than is already contained in the premises. Thus, this method of reasoning is ampliative.

A classic example of inductive reasoning comes from the empiricist David Hume:
====Analogical reasoning====

Analogical reasoning is a form of inductive reasoning from a particular to a particular. It is often used in case-based reasoning, especially legal reasoning. An example follows:
Analogical reasoning is a weaker form of inductive reasoning from a single example, because inductive reasoning typically uses a large number of examples to reason from the particular to the general. Analogical reasoning often leads to wrong conclusions. For example:
====Abductive reasoning====

Abductive reasoning, or argument to the best explanation, is a form of reasoning that does not fit in either the deductive or inductive categories, since it starts with incomplete set of observations and proceeds with likely possible explanations. The conclusion in an abductive argument does not follow with certainty from its premises and concerns something unobserved. What distinguishes abduction from the other forms of reasoning is an attempt to favour one conclusion above others, by subjective judgement or by attempting to falsify alternative explanations or by demonstrating the likelihood of the favoured conclusion, given a set of more or less disputable assumptions. For example, when a patient displays certain symptoms, there might be various possible causes, but one of these is preferred above others as being more probable.

====Fallacious reasoning====

Flawed reasoning in arguments is known as fallacious reasoning. Bad reasoning within arguments can result from either a formal fallacy or an informal fallacy.

Formal fallacies occur when there is a problem with the form, or structure, of the argument. The word &quot;formal&quot; refers to this link to the &quot;form&quot; of the argument. An argument that contains a formal fallacy will always be invalid.

An informal fallacy is an error in reasoning that occurs due to a problem with the &quot;content&quot;, rather than the form or structure, of the argument.

===Unreasonable decisions and actions===
In law relating to the actions of an employer or a public body, a decision or action which falls outside the range of actions or decision available when acting in good faith can be described as &quot;unreasonable&quot;. Use of the term is considered in the English law cases of &quot;Short v Poole Corporation&quot; (1926), &quot;Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation&quot; (1947) and &quot;Braganza v BP Shipping Limited&quot; (2015).

==Traditional problems raised concerning reason==
Philosophy is often characterized as a pursuit of rational understanding, entailing a more rigorous and dedicated application of human reasoning than commonly employed. Philosophers have long debated two fundamental questions regarding reason, essentially examining reasoning itself as a human endeavor, or philosophizing about philosophizing. The first question delves into whether we can place our trust in reason&#x27;s ability to attain knowledge and truth more effectively than alternative methods. The second question explores whether a life guided by reason, a life that aims to be guided by reason, can be expected to lead to greater happiness compared to other approaches to life.

===Reason versus truth, and &quot;first principles&quot;===

Since classical antiquity a question has remained constant in philosophical debate (sometimes seen as a conflict between Platonism and Aristotelianism) concerning the role of reason in confirming truth. People use logic, deduction, and induction to reach conclusions they think are true. Conclusions reached in this way are considered, according to Aristotle, more certain than sense perceptions on their own. On the other hand, if such reasoned conclusions are only built originally upon a foundation of sense perceptions, then our most logical conclusions can never be said to be certain because they are built upon the very same fallible perceptions they seek to better.

This leads to the question of what types of first principles, or starting points of reasoning, are available for someone seeking to come to true conclusions. In Greek, &quot;first principles&quot; are , &quot;starting points&quot;, and the faculty used to perceive them is sometimes referred to in Aristotle and Plato as which was close in meaning to &quot;awareness&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot;.

Empiricism (sometimes associated with Aristotle but more correctly associated with British philosophers such as John Locke and David Hume, as well as their ancient equivalents such as Democritus) asserts that sensory impressions are the only available starting points for reasoning and attempting to attain truth. This approach always leads to the controversial conclusion that absolute knowledge is not attainable. Idealism, (associated with Plato and his school), claims that there is a &quot;higher&quot; reality, within which certain people can directly discover truth without needing to rely only upon the senses, and that this higher reality is therefore the primary source of truth.

Philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, Al-Farabi, Avicenna, Averroes, Maimonides, Aquinas, and Hegel are sometimes said to have argued that reason must be fixed and discoverable—perhaps by dialectic, analysis, or study. In the vision of these thinkers, reason is divine or at least has divine attributes. Such an approach allowed religious philosophers such as Thomas Aquinas and Étienne Gilson to try to show that reason and revelation are compatible. According to Hegel, &quot;...the only thought which Philosophy brings with it to the contemplation of History, is the simple conception of reason; that reason is the Sovereign of the World; that the history of the world, therefore, presents us with a rational process.&quot;

Since the 17th century rationalists, reason has often been taken to be a subjective faculty, or rather the unaided ability (pure reason) to form concepts. For Descartes, Spinoza, and Leibniz, this was associated with mathematics. Kant attempted to show that pure reason could form concepts (time and space) that are the conditions of experience. Kant made his argument in opposition to Hume, who denied that reason had any role to play in experience.

===Reason versus emotion or passion===

After Plato and Aristotle, western literature often treated reason as being the faculty that trained the passions and appetites. Stoic philosophy, by contrast, claimed most emotions were merely false judgements. According to the Stoics the only good is virtue, and the only evil is vice, therefore emotions that judged things other than vice to be bad (such as fear or distress), or things other than virtue to be good (such as greed) were simply false judgements and should be discarded (though positive emotions based on true judgements, such as kindness, were acceptable). After the critiques of reason in the early Enlightenment the appetites were rarely discussed or were conflated with the passions. Some Enlightenment camps took after the Stoics to say reason should oppose passion rather than order it, while others like the Romantics believed that passion displaces reason, as in the maxim &quot;follow your heart&quot;.

Reason has been seen as cold, an &quot;enemy of mystery and ambiguity&quot;, a slave, or judge, of the passions, notably in the work of David Hume. More recently, Freud wrote, “It seems as though the activity of the other agencies of the mind is able only to modify the pleasure principle but not to nullify it; and it remains a question of the greatest theoretical importance, and one that has not yet been answered, when and how it is ever possible for the pleasure principle to be overcome.” 

Reasoning that claims the object of a desire is demanded by logic alone is called &quot;rationalization&quot;.

Rousseau first proposed, in his second &quot;Discourse&quot;, that reason and political life is not natural and is possibly harmful to mankind. He asked what really can be said about what is natural to mankind. What, other than reason and civil society, &quot;best suits his constitution&quot;? Rousseau saw &quot;two principles prior to reason&quot; in human nature. First we hold an intense interest in our own well-being. Secondly we object to the suffering or death of any sentient being, especially one like ourselves. These two passions lead us to desire more than we could achieve. We become dependent upon each other, and on relationships of authority and obedience. This effectively puts the human race into slavery. Rousseau says that he almost dares to assert that nature does not destine men to be healthy. According to Richard Velkley, &quot;Rousseau outlines certain programs of rational self-correction, most notably the political legislation of the &quot;Contrat Social&quot; and the moral education in &quot;&quot;. All the same, Rousseau understands such corrections to be only ameliorations of an essentially unsatisfactory condition, that of socially and intellectually corrupted humanity.&quot;

This quandary presented by Rousseau led to Kant&#x27;s new way of justifying reason as freedom to create good and evil. These therefore are not to be blamed on nature or God. In various ways, German Idealism after Kant, and major later figures such Nietzsche, Bergson, Husserl, Scheler, and Heidegger, remain preoccupied with problems coming from the metaphysical demands or urges of reason. Rousseau and these later writers also exerted a large influence on art and politics. Many writers (such as Nikos Kazantzakis) extol passion and disparage reason. In politics modern nationalism comes from Rousseau&#x27;s argument that rationalist cosmopolitanism brings man ever further from his natural state.

In &quot;Descartes&#x27; Error&quot;, Antonio Damasio presents the &quot;Somatic Marker Hypothesis&quot; which states that emotions guide behavior and decision-making. Damasio argues that these somatic markers (known collectively as &quot;gut feelings&quot;) are &quot;intuitive signals&quot; that direct our decision making processes in a certain way that cannot be solved with rationality alone. Damasio further argues that rationality requires emotional input in order to function.

===Reason versus faith or tradition===

There are many religious traditions, some of which are explicitly fideist and others of which claim varying degrees of rationalism. Secular critics sometimes accuse all religious adherents of irrationality; they claim such adherents are guilty of ignoring, suppressing, or forbidding some kinds of reasoning concerning some subjects (such as religious dogmas, moral taboos, etc.). Though theologies and religions such as classical monotheism typically do not admit to being irrational, there is often a perceived conflict or tension between faith and tradition on the one hand, and reason on the other, as potentially competing sources of wisdom, law, and truth.

Religious adherents sometimes respond by arguing that faith and reason can be reconciled, or have different non-overlapping domains, or that critics engage in a similar kind of irrationalism:
; Reconciliation : Philosopher Alvin Plantinga argues that there is no real conflict between reason and classical theism because classical theism explains (among other things) why the universe is intelligible and why reason can successfully grasp it.
; Non-overlapping magisteria : Evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould argues that there need not be conflict between reason and religious belief because they are each authoritative in their own domain (or &quot;magisterium&quot;). If so, reason can work on those problems over which it has authority while other sources of knowledge or opinion can have authority on the big questions.
; : Philosophers Alasdair MacIntyre and Charles Taylor argue that those critics of traditional religion who are adherents of secular liberalism are also sometimes guilty of ignoring, suppressing, and forbidding some kinds of reasoning about subjects. Similarly, philosophers of science such as Paul Feyarabend argue that scientists sometimes ignore or suppress evidence contrary to the dominant paradigm.
; Unification : Theologian Joseph Ratzinger, later Benedict XVI, asserted that &quot;Christianity has understood itself as the religion of the Logos, as the religion according to reason,&quot; referring to , usually translated as &quot;In the beginning was the Word (Logos).&quot; Thus, he said that the Christian faith is &quot;open to all that is truly rational&quot;, and that the rationality of Western Enlightenment &quot;is of Christian origin&quot;.

Some commentators have claimed that Western civilization can be almost defined by its serious testing of the limits of tension between &quot;unaided&quot; reason and faith in &quot;revealed&quot; truths—figuratively summarized as Athens and Jerusalem, respectively. Leo Strauss spoke of a &quot;Greater West&quot; that included all areas under the influence of the tension between Greek rationalism and Abrahamic revelation, including the Muslim lands. He was particularly influenced by the Muslim philosopher Al-Farabi. To consider to what extent Eastern philosophy might have partaken of these important tensions, Strauss thought it best to consider whether dharma or tao may be equivalent to Nature ( in Greek). According to Strauss the beginning of philosophy involved the &quot;discovery or invention of nature&quot; and the &quot;pre-philosophical equivalent of nature&quot; was supplied by &quot;such notions as &#x27;custom&#x27; or &#x27;ways, which appear to be really universal in all times and places. The philosophical concept of nature or natures as a way of understanding (first principles of knowledge) brought about a peculiar tension between reasoning on the one hand, and tradition or faith on the other.

==Reason in particular fields of study==

===Psychology and cognitive science===

Scientific research into reasoning is carried out within the fields of psychology and cognitive science. Psychologists attempt to determine whether or not people are capable of rational thought in a number of different circumstances.

Assessing how well someone engages in reasoning is the project of determining the extent to which the person is rational or acts rationally. It is a key research question in the psychology of reasoning and cognitive science of reasoning. Rationality is often divided into its respective theoretical and practical counterparts.

====Behavioral experiments on human reasoning====
Experimental cognitive psychologists research reasoning behaviour. Such research may focus, for example, on how people perform on tests of reasoning such as intelligence or IQ tests, or on how well people&#x27;s reasoning matches ideals set by logic (see, for example, the Wason test). Experiments examine how people make inferences from conditionals like &quot;if A then B&quot; and how they make inferences about alternatives like &quot;A or else B&quot;. They test whether people can make valid deductions about spatial and temporal relations like &quot;A is to the left of B&quot; or &quot;A happens after B&quot;, and about quantified assertions like &quot;all the A are B&quot;. Experiments investigate how people make inferences about factual situations, hypothetical possibilities, probabilities, and counterfactual situations.

====Developmental studies of children&#x27;s reasoning====
Developmental psychologists investigate the development of reasoning from birth to adulthood. Piaget&#x27;s theory of cognitive development was the first complete theory of reasoning development. Subsequently, several alternative theories were proposed, including the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development.

====Neuroscience of reasoning====

The biological functioning of the brain is studied by neurophysiologists, cognitive neuroscientists, and neuropsychologists. This includes research into the structure and function of normally functioning brains, as well as of damaged or otherwise unusual brains. In addition to carrying out research into reasoning, some psychologists—for example clinical psychologists and psychotherapists—work to alter people&#x27;s reasoning habits when those habits are unhelpful.

===Computer science===

====Automated reasoning====
In artificial intelligence and computer science, scientists study and use automated reasoning for diverse applications including automated theorem proving the formal semantics of programming languages, and formal specification in software engineering.

====Meta-reasoning====

Meta-reasoning is reasoning about reasoning. In computer science, a system performs meta-reasoning when reasoning about its operation. This requires a programming language capable of reflection, the ability to observe and modify its own structure and behaviour.

===Evolution of reason===

A species could benefit greatly from better abilities to reason about, predict, and understand the world. French social and cognitive scientists Dan Sperber and Hugo Mercier argue that, aside from these benefits, other forces could have been driving the evolution of reason. They point out that reasoning is very difficult for humans to do effectively, and that it is hard for individuals to doubt their own beliefs (confirmation bias). Reasoning is most effective when done as a collective—as demonstrated by the success of projects like science. They suggest that there are pressures not just individual, but group selection at play. Any group that managed to find ways of reasoning effectively would reap benefits for all its members, increasing their fitness. This could also help explain why humans, according to Sperber, are not optimized to reason effectively alone. Sperber&#x27;s &amp; Mercier&#x27;s argumentative theory of reasoning claims that reason may have more to do with winning arguments than searching for the truth.

===Reason in political philosophy and ethics===

Aristotle famously described reason (with language) as a part of human nature, because of which it is best for humans to live &quot;politically&quot; meaning in communities of about the size and type of a small city state ( in Greek). For example:
If human nature is fixed in this way, we can define what type of community is always best for people. This argument has remained a central argument in all political, ethical, and moral thinking since then, and has become especially controversial since firstly Rousseau&#x27;s Second Discourse, and secondly, the Theory of Evolution. Already in Aristotle there was an awareness that the had not always existed and had to be invented or developed by humans themselves. The household came first, and the first villages and cities were just extensions of that, with the first cities being run as if they were still families with Kings acting like fathers.
Friendship seems to prevail in man and woman according to nature []; for people are by nature [] pairing more than political [], in as much as the household [] is prior and more necessary than the and making children is more common [] with the animals. In the other animals, community [] goes no further than this, but people live together [] not only for the sake of making children, but also for the things for life; for from the start the functions [] are divided, and are different for man and woman. Thus they supply each other, putting their own into the common []. It is for these reasons that both utility and pleasure seem to be found in this kind of friendship.

Rousseau in his Second Discourse finally took the shocking step of claiming that this traditional account has things in reverse: with reason, language, and rationally organized communities all having developed over a long period of time merely as a result of the fact that some habits of cooperation were found to solve certain types of problems, and that once such cooperation became more important, it forced people to develop increasingly complex cooperation—often only to defend themselves from each other.

In other words, according to Rousseau, reason, language, and rational community did not arise because of any conscious decision or plan by humans or gods, nor because of any pre-existing human nature. As a result, he claimed, living together in rationally organized communities like modern humans is a development with many negative aspects compared to the original state of man as an ape. If anything is specifically human in this theory, it is the flexibility and adaptability of humans. This view of the animal origins of distinctive human characteristics later received support from Charles Darwin&#x27;s Theory of Evolution.

The two competing theories concerning the origins of reason are relevant to political and ethical thought because, according to the Aristotelian theory, a best way of living together exists independently of historical circumstances. According to Rousseau, we should even doubt that reason, language, and politics are a good thing, as opposed to being simply the best option given the particular course of events that led to today. Rousseau&#x27;s theory, that human nature is malleable rather than fixed, is often taken to imply (for example by Karl Marx) a wider range of possible ways of living together than traditionally known.

However, while Rousseau&#x27;s initial impact encouraged bloody revolutions against traditional politics, including both the French Revolution and the Russian Revolution, his own conclusions about the best forms of community seem to have been remarkably classical, in favor of city-states such as Geneva, and rural living.

<doc id="42451" wikidata="Q189334" url="?curid=42451" title="Pentaerythritol tetranitrate">
<text>Pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN), also known as PENT, pentyl, PENTA (ПЕНТА, primarily in Russian), TEN (tetraeritrit nitrate), corpent, or penthrite (or, rarely and primarily in German, as nitropenta), is an explosive material. It is the nitrate ester of pentaerythritol, and is structurally very similar to nitroglycerin. Penta refers to the five carbon atoms of the neopentane skeleton. PETN is a very powerful explosive material with a relative effectiveness factor of 1.66. When mixed with a plasticizer, PETN forms a plastic explosive. Along with RDX it is the main ingredient of Semtex.

PETN is also used as a vasodilator drug to treat certain heart conditions, such as for management of angina.

==History==
Pentaerythritol tetranitrate was first prepared and patented in 1894 by the explosives manufacturer of Cologne, Germany. The production of PETN started in 1912, when the improved method of production was patented by the German government. PETN was used by the German Military in . It was also used in the MG FF/M autocannons and many other weapon systems of the Luftwaffe in World War II.

==Properties==
PETN is practically insoluble in water (0.01 g/100 mL at 50 °C), weakly soluble in common nonpolar solvents such as aliphatic hydrocarbons (like gasoline) or tetrachloromethane, but soluble in some other organic solvents, particularly in acetone (about 15 g/100 g of the solution at 20 °C, 55 g/100 g at 60 °C) and dimethylformamide (40 g/100 g of the solution at 40 °C, 70 g/100 g at 70 °C). It is a non-planar molecule that crystallizes in the space group &quot;P&quot;21&quot;c&quot;. PETN forms eutectic mixtures with some liquid or molten aromatic nitro compounds, &quot;e.g.&quot; trinitrotoluene (TNT) or tetryl. Due to steric hindrance of the adjacent neopentyl-like moiety, PETN is resistant to attack by many chemical reagents; it does not hydrolyze in water at room temperature or in weaker alkaline aqueous solutions. Water at 100 °C or above causes hydrolysis to dinitrate; presence of 0.1% nitric acid accelerates the reaction.

The chemical stability of PETN is of interest, because of the presence of PETN in aging weapons. Neutron radiation degrades PETN, producing carbon dioxide and some pentaerythritol dinitrate and trinitrate. Gamma radiation increases the thermal decomposition sensitivity of PETN, lowers melting point by few degrees Celsius, and causes swelling of the samples. Like other nitrate esters, the primary degradation mechanism is the loss of nitrogen dioxide; this reaction is autocatalytic. Studies were performed on thermal decomposition of PETN.

In the environment, PETN undergoes biodegradation. Some bacteria denitrate PETN to trinitrate and then dinitrate, which is then further degraded. PETN has low volatility and low solubility in water, and therefore has low bioavailability for most organisms. Its toxicity is relatively low, and its transdermal absorption also seems to be low. It poses a threat for aquatic organisms. It can be degraded to pentaerythritol by iron.

==Production==

Production is by the reaction of pentaerythritol with concentrated nitric acid to form a precipitate which can be recrystallized from acetone to give processable crystals.

Variations of a method first published in US Patent 2,370,437 by Acken and Vyverberg (1945 to Du Pont) form the basis of all current commercial production.

PETN is manufactured by numerous manufacturers as a powder, or together with nitrocellulose and plasticizer as thin plasticized sheets (e.g. Primasheet 1000 or Detasheet). PETN residues are easily detectable in hair of people handling it. The highest residue retention is on black hair; some residues remain even after washing.

==Explosive use==

The most common use of PETN is as an explosive with high brisance. It is a secondary explosive, meaning it is more difficult to detonate than primary explosives, so dropping or igniting it will typically not cause an explosion (at standard atmospheric pressure it is difficult to ignite and burns vigorously), but is more sensitive to shock and friction than other secondary explosives such as TNT or tetryl. Under certain conditions a deflagration to detonation transition can occur, just like that of ammonium nitrate.

It is rarely used alone in military operations due to its lower stability, but is primarily used in the main charges of plastic explosives (such as C4) along with other explosives (especially RDX), booster and bursting charges of small caliber ammunition, in upper charges of detonators in some land mines and shells, as the explosive core of detonation cord. PETN is the least stable of the common military explosives, but can be stored without significant deterioration for longer than nitroglycerin or nitrocellulose.

During World War II, PETN was most importantly used in exploding-bridgewire detonators for the atomic bombs. These exploding-bridgewire detonators gave more precise detonation compared to primacord. PETN was used for these detonators because it was safer than primary explosives like lead azide: while it was sensitive, it would not detonate below a threshold amount of energy. Exploding bridgewires containing PETN remain used in current nuclear weapons. In spark detonators, PETN is used to avoid the need for primary explosives; the energy needed for a successful direct initiation of PETN by an electric spark ranges between 10–60 mJ.

Its basic explosion characteristics are:
* Explosion energy: 5810 kJ/kg (1390 kcal/kg), so 1 kg of PETN has the energy of 1.24 kg TNT.
* Detonation velocity: 8350 m/s (1.73 g/cm3), 7910 m/s (1.62 g/cm3), 7420 m/s (1.5 g/cm3), 8500 m/s (pressed in a steel tube)
* Volume of gases produced: 790 dm3/kg (other value: 768 dm3/kg)
* Explosion temperature: 4230 °C
* Oxygen balance: −6.31 atom -g/kg
* Melting point: 141.3 °C (pure), 140–141 °C (technical)
* Trauzl lead block test: 523 cm3 (other values: 500 cm3 when sealed with sand, or 560 cm3 when sealed with water)
* Critical diameter (minimal diameter of a rod that can sustain detonation propagation): 0.9 mm for PETN at 1 g/cm3, smaller for higher densities (other value: 1.5 mm)

===In mixtures===
PETN is used in a number of compositions. It is a major ingredient of the Semtex plastic explosive. It is also used as a component of pentolite, a castable mixture with TNT (usually 50/50 but may contain more TNT), which is, along with pure PETN, a common explosive for boosters for the blasting work (as in mining). The XTX8003 extrudable explosive, used in the W68 and W76 nuclear warheads, is a mixture of 80% PETN and 20% of Sylgard 182, a silicone rubber. It is often phlegmatized by addition of 5–40% of wax, or by polymers (producing polymer-bonded explosives); in this form it is used in some cannon shells up to 30 mm caliber, though it is unsuitable for higher calibers. It is also used as a component of some gun propellants and solid rocket propellants. Nonphlegmatized PETN is stored and handled with approximately 10% water content. PETN alone cannot be cast as it explosively decomposes slightly above its melting point, but it can be mixed with other explosives to form castable mixtures.

PETN can be initiated by a laser. A pulse with duration of 25 nanoseconds and 0.5–4.2 joules of energy from a Q-switched ruby laser can initiate detonation of a PETN surface coated with a 100 nm thick aluminium layer in less than half of a microsecond.

PETN has been replaced in many applications by RDX, which is thermally more stable and has a longer shelf life. PETN can be used in some ram accelerator types. Replacement of the central carbon atom with silicon produces Si-PETN, which is extremely sensitive.

===Terrorist and Military use===
Ten kilograms of PETN was used in the 1980 Paris synagogue bombing.

In 1983, 307 people were killed after a truck bomb filled with PETN was detonated at the Beirut barracks.

In 1983, the &quot;Maison de France&quot; house in Berlin was brought to a near-total collapse by the detonation of of PETN by terrorist Johannes Weinrich.

On July 17, 1996, flight TWA 800 exploded and crashed in the Atlantic Ocean. Traces of PETN were found in the wreckage.

In 1999, Alfred Heinz Reumayr used PETN as the main charge for his fourteen improvised explosive devices that he constructed in a thwarted attempt to damage the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System.

In 2001, al-Qaeda member Richard Reid, the &quot;Shoe Bomber&quot;, used PETN in the sole of his shoe in his unsuccessful attempt to blow up American Airlines Flight 63 from Paris to Miami. He had intended to use the solid triacetone triperoxide (TATP) as a detonator.

In 2009, PETN was used in an attempt by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula to assassinate the Saudi Arabian Deputy Minister of Interior Prince Muhammad bin Nayef, by Saudi suicide bomber Abdullah Hassan al Asiri. The target survived and the bomber died in the blast. The PETN was hidden in the bomber&#x27;s rectum, which security experts described as a novel technique.

On 25 December 2009, PETN was found in the underwear of Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the &quot;Underwear bomber&quot;, a Nigerian with links to al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. According to US law enforcement officials, he had attempted to blow up Northwest Airlines Flight 253 while approaching Detroit from Amsterdam. Abdulmutallab had tried, unsuccessfully, to detonate approximately of PETN sewn into his underwear by adding liquid from a syringe; however, only a small fire resulted.

In the al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula October 2010 cargo plane bomb plot, two PETN-filled printer cartridges were found at East Midlands Airport and in Dubai on flights bound for the US on an intelligence tip. Both packages contained sophisticated bombs concealed in computer printer cartridges filled with PETN. The bomb found in England contained of PETN, and the one found in Dubai contained of PETN. Hans Michels, professor of safety engineering at University College London, told a newspaper that of PETN—&quot;around 50 times less than was used—would be enough to blast a hole in a metal plate twice the thickness of an aircraft&#x27;s skin&quot;. In contrast, according to an experiment conducted by a BBC documentary team designed to simulate Abdulmutallab&#x27;s Christmas Day bombing, using a Boeing 747 plane, even 80 grams of PETN was not sufficient to materially damage the fuselage.

On 12 July 2017, 150 grams of PETN was found in the Assembly of Uttar Pradesh, India&#x27;s most populous state.

PETN was used by Israel in the manufacturing of pagers provided to Hezbollah. On September 17, 2024, the pagers detonated, killing 12 people and injuring thousands.

===Detection===
In the wake of terrorist PETN bomb plots, an article in &quot;Scientific American&quot; noted PETN is difficult to detect because it does not readily vaporize into the surrounding air. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted in November 2010 that PETN&#x27;s low vapor pressure makes it difficult for bomb-sniffing dogs to detect.

Many technologies can be used to detect PETN, including chemical sensors, X-rays, infrared, microwaves and terahertz, some of which have been implemented in public screening applications, primarily for air travel. PETN is one of the explosive chemicals typically of interest in that area, and it belongs to a family of common nitrate-based explosive chemicals which can often be detected by the same tests.

One detection system in use at airports involves analysis of swab samples obtained from passengers and their baggage. Whole-body imaging scanners that use radio-frequency electromagnetic waves, low-intensity X-rays, or T-rays of terahertz frequency that can detect objects hidden under clothing are not widely used because of cost, concerns about the resulting traveler delays, and privacy concerns.

Both parcels in the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot were x-rayed without the bombs being spotted. Qatar Airways said the PETN bomb &quot;could not be detected by x-ray screening or trained sniffer dogs&quot;. The Bundeskriminalamt received copies of the Dubai x-rays, and an investigator said German staff would not have identified the bomb either. New airport security procedures followed in the U.S., largely to protect against PETN.

==Medical use==
Like nitroglycerin (glyceryl trinitrate) and other nitrates, PETN is also used medically as a vasodilator in the treatment of heart conditions. These drugs work by releasing the signaling gas nitric oxide in the body. The heart medicine &quot;Lentonitrat&quot; is nearly pure PETN.

Monitoring of oral usage of the drug by patients has been performed by determination of plasma levels of several of its hydrolysis products, pentaerythritol dinitrate, pentaerythritol mononitrate and pentaerythritol, in plasma using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.

<doc id="42453" wikidata="Q904229" url="?curid=42453" title="Kirkendall effect">
<text>The Kirkendall effect is the motion of the interface between two metals that occurs due to the difference in diffusion rates of the metal atoms. The effect can be observed, for example, by placing insoluble markers at the interface between a pure metal and an alloy containing that metal, and heating to a temperature where atomic diffusion is reasonable for the given timescale; the boundary will move relative to the markers.
This process was named after Ernest Kirkendall (1914–2005), assistant professor of chemical engineering at Wayne State University from 1941 to 1946. The paper describing the discovery of the effect was published in 1947.

The Kirkendall effect has important practical consequences. One of these is the prevention or suppression of voids formed at the boundary interface in various kinds of alloy-to-metal bonding. These are referred to as Kirkendall voids.

==History==
The Kirkendall effect was discovered by Ernest Kirkendall and Alice Smigelskas in 1947, in the course of Kirkendall&#x27;s ongoing research into diffusion in brass. The paper in which he discovered the famous effect was the third in his series of papers on brass diffusion, the first being his thesis. His second paper revealed that zinc diffused more quickly than copper in alpha-brass, which led to the research producing his revolutionary theory. Until this point, substitutional and ring methods were the dominant ideas for diffusional motion. Kirkendall&#x27;s experiment produced evidence of a vacancy diffusion mechanism, which is the accepted mechanism to this day. At the time it was submitted, the paper and Kirkendall&#x27;s ideas were rejected from publication by Robert Franklin Mehl, director of the Metals Research Laboratory at Carnegie Institute of Technology (now Carnegie Mellon University). Mehl refused to accept Kirkendall&#x27;s evidence of this new diffusion mechanism and denied publication for over six months, only relenting after a conference was held and several other researchers confirmed Kirkendall&#x27;s results.

===Kirkendall&#x27;s experiment===
A bar of brass (70% Cu, 30% Zn) was used as a core, with molybdenum wires stretched along its length, and then coated in a layer of pure copper. Molybdenum was chosen as the marker material due to it being very insoluble in brass, eliminating any error due to the markers diffusing themselves. Diffusion was allowed to take place at 785 °C over the course of 56 days, with cross-sections being taken at six times throughout the span of the experiment. Over time, it was observed that the wire markers moved closer together as the zinc diffused out of the brass and into the copper. A difference in location of the interface was visible in cross sections of different times. Compositional change of the material from diffusion was confirmed by x-ray diffraction.

==Diffusion mechanism==
Early diffusion models postulated that atomic motion in substitutional alloys occurs via a direct exchange mechanism, in which atoms migrate by switching positions with atoms on adjacent lattice sites. Such a mechanism implies that the atomic fluxes of two different materials across an interface must be equal, as each atom moving across the interface causes another atom to move across in the other direction.

Another possible diffusion mechanism involves lattice vacancies. An atom can move into a vacant lattice site, effectively causing the atom and the vacancy to switch places. If large-scale diffusion takes place in a material, there will be a flux of atoms in one direction and a flux of vacancies in the other.

The Kirkendall effect arises when two distinct materials are placed next to each other and diffusion is allowed to take place between them. In general, the diffusion coefficients of the two materials in each other are not the same. This is only possible if diffusion occurs by a vacancy mechanism; if the atoms instead diffused by an exchange mechanism, they would cross the interface in pairs, so the diffusion rates would be identical, contrary to observation. By Fick&#x27;s 1st law of diffusion, the flux of atoms from the material with the higher diffusion coefficient will be larger, so there will be a net flux of atoms from the material with the higher diffusion coefficient into the material with the lower diffusion coefficient. To balance this flux of atoms, there will be a flux of vacancies in the opposite direction—from the material with the lower diffusion coefficient into the material with the higher diffusion coefficient—resulting in an overall translation of the lattice relative to the environment in the direction of the material with the lower diffusion constant.

Macroscopic evidence for the Kirkendall effect can be gathered by placing inert markers at the initial interface between the two materials, such as molybdenum markers at an interface between copper and brass. The diffusion coefficient of zinc is higher than the diffusion coefficient of copper in this case. Since zinc atoms leave the brass at a higher rate than copper atoms enter, the size of the brass region decreases as diffusion progresses. Relative to the molybdenum markers, the copper–brass interface moves toward the brass at an experimentally measurable rate.

===Darken&#x27;s equations===

Shortly after the publication of Kirkendall&#x27;s paper, L. S. Darken published an analysis of diffusion in binary systems much like the one studied by Smigelskas and Kirkendall. By separating the actual diffusive flux of the materials from the movement of the interface relative to the markers, Darken found the marker velocity formula_1 to be 
formula_2
where formula_3 and formula_4 are the diffusion coefficients of the two materials, and formula_5 is an atomic fraction.
One consequence of this equation is that the movement of an interface varies linearly with the square root of time, which is exactly the experimental relationship discovered by Smigelskas and Kirkendall.

Darken also developed a second equation that defines a combined chemical diffusion coefficient formula_6 in terms of the diffusion coefficients of the two interfacing materials:
formula_7
This chemical diffusion coefficient can be used to mathematically analyze Kirkendall effect diffusion via the Boltzmann–Matano method.

==Kirkendall porosity==
One important consideration deriving from Kirkendall&#x27;s work is the presence of pores formed during diffusion. These voids act as sinks for vacancies, and when enough accumulate, they can become substantial and expand in an attempt to restore equilibrium. Porosity occurs due to the difference in diffusion rate of the two species.

Pores in metals have ramifications for mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, and thus control over their formation is often desired. The equation 
formula_8
where formula_9 is the distance moved by a marker, formula_10 is a coefficient determined by intrinsic diffusivities of the materials, and formula_11 is a concentration difference between components, has proven to be an effective model for mitigating Kirkendall porosity. Controlling annealing temperature is another method of reducing or eliminating porosity. Kirkendall porosity typically occurs at a set temperature in a system, so annealing can be performed at lower temperatures for longer times to avoid formation of pores.

==Examples==

In 1972, C. W. Horsting of the RCA Corporation published a paper which reported test results on the reliability of semiconductor devices in which the connections were made using aluminium wires bonded ultrasonically to gold-plated posts. His paper demonstrated the importance of the Kirkendall effect in wire bonding technology, but also showed the significant contribution of any impurities present to the rate at which precipitation occurred at the wire bonds. Two of the important contaminants that have this effect, known as Horsting effect (Horsting voids) are fluorine and chlorine. Both Kirkendall voids and Horsting voids are known causes of wire-bond fractures, though historically this cause is often confused with the purple-colored appearance of one of the five different gold–aluminium intermetallics, commonly referred to as &quot;purple plague&quot; and less often &quot;white plague&quot;.

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Spring – Emperor Romanos IV begins a campaign against the Seljuk Turks, and marches towards the Euphrates via Melitene. He crosses the river at Romanopolis (modern Turkey), and captures the strategic fortress city of Chliat on the north-western shore of Lake Van. Romanos leaves a Byzantine rear guard on the upper Euphrates under General Philaretos Brachamios with orders to defend the Mesopotamian frontier.
* Seljuk forces under Alp Arslan defeat the Byzantine rear guard and advance deep into Cappadocia and Lycaonia. They plunder at will, but fail to capture the city of Iconium. Romanos retreats and returns to Constantinople. Alp Arslan takes advantage of Romanos&#x27; retreat and captures Manzikert. He recaptures the strategical fortress cities of Chliat and Van, consolidating his control over the Lake Van region.

* Winter of 1069–1070 – Harrying of the North: King William the Conqueror quells rebellions made by his English subjects against his rule, campaigning through the north of England with his forces, burning houses, crops, cattle and land from York to Durham, resulting in the deaths of over 100,000 people, mainly from starvation and winter cold.

=== By place ===

====Africa====
* The Kingdom of Mapungubwe is established, in modern-day South Africa.

====Byzantine Empire====
* The future Emperor Alexios Komnenos captures the Norman rebel Roussel de Bailleul in Amaseia.

==== Europe ====
* June 9 – First Battle of Langensalza: Emperor Henry IV defeats the Saxon nobles on the River Unstrut near Langensalza in Thuringia (modern Germany). He subjugates Saxony, and immediately tries to reassert his rights as the sovereign of northern Italy.

* Revolt of the Earls: The Earls Ralph de Gael, Roger de Breteuil and Waltheof, begin a revolt against King William I (the Conqueror) in the last serious act of resistance to the Norman Conquest.

* August 25 – Council of London: Archbishop Lanfranc instigates the movement of English bishoprics. One of these is the bishopric of Sherborne and Wilton which is moved to Old Sarum.

==== Asia ====
* Summer – Shen Kuo, Chinese polymath scientist and statesman, solves a border dispute with the Liao dynasty by dredging up old diplomatic records. He refutes Emperor Dao Zong&#x27;s bluffs point for point during a meeting at Mt. Yongan (near modern-day Pingquan), reestablishing the rightful borders of the Song dynasty.

* April – The &quot;Dictatus papae&quot; (a compilation of 27 statements of powers) are included in the registry of Gregory VII, in which he asserts papal authority over earthly as well as spiritual rulers.
* December 8 – Gregory VII writes a letter of reprimand to Henry IV. He accuses him of breaching his word and continued support of excommunicated councilors.

== Events ==

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Spring – The Normans under Duke Robert Guiscard take Dyrrhachium (modern-day Durrës) in Illyria and advance inland, capturing most of Macedonia and Thessaly. Robert is forced to leave Greece to deal with an uprising in Italy. He leaves his son Bohemond in charge of the army, who lays siege to the city of Larissa. Emperor Alexios I Komnenos mobilizes a new army, and with the support of 7,000 Seljuk Turks he clears Thessaly from the Normans.
* Byzantine–Venetian treaty: Alexios I signs a trade and defence pact with Venice, in the form of an imperial Golden Bull. He grants the Venetians a commercial colony in Constantinople, as well as free trading and exemption from taxes, throughout the Byzantine Empire in return for their defense of the Adriatic Sea against the Normans.

==== Europe ====
* May 12 – Battle of Mailberg: Duke Vratislaus II of Bohemia invades Austria with an army of 8,000 men (supported by mercenaries from Moravia and Bavaria). He defeats the forces under Margrave Leopold II (&quot;the Fair&quot;) near Mailberg. The northern region of Lower Austria is devastated from pillage and famine.
* December 6 – Count Ramon Berenguer II of Barcelona is killed while hunting in the woods. He is succeeded by his twin brother Berenguer Ramon II as the sole ruler of Catalonia (modern Spain).
* Winter – Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor, leads an expedition into Italy and besieges Rome. He gains entry and a synod is agreed upon by the Romans to rule on the dispute between Henry and Pope Gregory VII.
* Adalbero, margrave of Styria, is forced to resign in favor of his brother Ottokar II, who is an ally of Gregory VII.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Spring – Tzachas, a Seljuk Turkish military commander, establishes an independent maritime state centred in the Ionian coastal city of Smyrna (modern-day İzmir). He proclaims himself emperor (&quot;basileus&quot;), and concludes an alliance with the Pechenegs in Thrace. Tzachas uses his fleet to blockade Constantinople by sea, while the Pechenegs besiege the capital by land.
* April 29 – Battle of Levounion: Emperor Alexios I, supported by his allies, defeats 80,000 of Pechenegs (including women and children) at the Evros River, near Enos (modern Turkey). The Cumans and Byzantine forces fall upon the enemy camp, slaughtering all in their path. The Pechenegs are butchered so savagely, that this people is almost wiped out.

==== Europe ====
* Spring – King Stephen II, the last member of the Trpimirović dynasty, dies without leaving an heir after a 2-year reign. War and unrest breaks out in Croatia afterwards. King Ladislaus I of Hungary, on instigation of his sister, Queen Helena, intervenes in the conflict and occupies Croatia. He proclaims himself king, but is contested by the Croatian nobleman Petar Snačić.
* February – Norman conquest of Sicily: The Normans conquer Noto and complete the 30-year-long conquest of Sicily from the Moorish rulers. Duke Roger Borsa (a son of Robert Guiscard) surrenders his share in the castles of Calabria, and receives his inheritance of Palermo. He grants charters to various towns and encourages urban planning in Apulia and Calabria. 
* Summer – The Norman invasion of Malta: A Norman fleet led by Count Roger I of Sicily (&quot;Bosso&quot;) arrives in Malta. Roger disembarks his army, and besieges the island&#x27;s capital Medina (modern-day Mdina). The inhabitants negotiate peace terms (by promising to pay an annual tribute) and swear an oath of loyalty to Roger. On the way back, the Normans sack the island Gozo.
* July – The Abbadid dynasty ruling in Al-Andalus (modern Spain) falls when Almoravid forces storm Seville. Confronted with this threat, Emir Muhammad ibn Abu Bakr Muhammad al-Aftas of Badajoz obtains the support of King Alfonso VI (&quot;the Brave&quot;) of Castile, in exchange for the Moorish positions on the river Tagus (Sintra, Santarém and Lisbon).

==== Britain and France====
* February 2 – King William II of England invades western Normandy with a large army. His brothers, Henry and Robert Curthose, mobilize mercenary forces to resist him during a siege at Mont-Saint-Michel. Under terms of the Treaty of Caen, estates on the Cotentin Peninsula of Normandy are surrendered to William, matters being concluded in August.
* July – King Malcolm III of Scotland invades England, reaching as far south as Durham. The Normans led by William II and Robert march north to oppose the Scots, but a conflict is averted. Malcolm is forced to accept the terms of the Treaty of Abernethy (1072) and pays homage to William.
* Cardiff Castle in Wales is constructed by Robert Fitzhamon, Norman lord of Gloucester (approximate date).

=== By topic ===

==== Disasters ====
* October 17 – London tornado: A T8 tornado (roughly equal to an F4 on the Fujita scale) occurs in London. The wooden London Bridge is demolished and the church of St. Mary-le-Bow is badly damaged.

==== Religion ====
* December – Athanasius VI bar Khamoro becomes (against his will) patriarch and head of the Syriac Orthodox Church in Antioch (until 1129).&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<text>Year 1092 ([[Roman numerals|MXCII]]) was a leap year starting on Thursday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Summer – Emperor Alexios I Komnenos bribes one of Kilij Arslan&#x27;s (sultan of the Sultanate of Rum) officials to recover Sinope (the capital of Paphlagonia), and neighbouring coastal regions. He uses the Byzantine fleet to defeat the Seljuk navy off the coast of Cius in Bithynia.

==== Europe ====
* January 14 – Vratislaus II, the first king of Bohemia, dies after a 6½-year reign and is succeeded by his brother Conrad I who becomes duke and not king because Vratislaus was elevated to the royal dignity &#x27;for life&#x27; by Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor (in 1085). Conrad dies September 6 after a 8-month reign and is succeeded by his nephew Bretislav II (the eldest son of Vratislaus).

==== Britain ====
* Summer – King William II annexes Cumbria from the Scottish Celtic kingdom of Strathclyde, and builds Carlisle Castle.
* May 11 – Lincoln Cathedral, one of England&#x27;s finest Gothic buildings, is consecrated.

==== Seljuk Empire ====
* November 19 – Sultan Malik-Shah I dies after a 20-year reign while hunting. The Seljuk Empire falls into chaos: his brother Tutush I and rival successors carve up their own independent sultanates in the Middle East. Malik-Shah is succeeded by his son Mahmud I, but he does not gain control of the empire.

==== China ====
* Su Song, a Chinese statesman and scientist, publishes his &quot;Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao&quot;, a treatise outlining the construction and operation of his complex astronomical clocktower, built in Kaifeng. It also includes a celestial atlas of five star maps.

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* April 21 – The Diocese of Pisa is elevated to the dignity of a metropolitan archdiocese by Pope Urban II.
* May 21 – Synod of Szabolcs: King Ladislaus I of Hungary assembles a council of the prelates of his kingdom at the fortress of Szabolcs.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

== Births ==
* Adélaide de Maurienne, queen consort of France (d. 1154)

<text>Year 1102 ([[Roman numerals|MCII]]) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Levant ====
* Spring – A Fatimid expeditionary force (some 20,000 men) invades Palestine and launches attacks into the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The Crusaders defeat a Fatimid rearguard near Ascalon, and capture the city after a 3-year siege. The Crusaders capture Caesarea Maritima with support of the Genoese fleet. A number of Genoese trading colonies are established along the Mediterranean coast.
* Siege of Tripoli: The Crusaders under Raymond IV begin the siege of Tripoli (modern Lebanon). The garrison calls for assistance, but a Seljuk relief army from Damascus and Homs is defeated by Raymond.
* May 17 – Battle of Ramla: The Crusaders (500 knights) under King Baldwin I are defeated by the Fatimid army at Ramla (modern Israel). Baldwin and his companions escape through the enemy lines to Arsuf.
* May 27 – The Crusaders under Baldwin I break their way out of Jaffa, which is encircled by the Fatimid Army. A charge of the French cavalry breaks the enemy&#x27;s ranks, and forces them to retreat to Ascalon.
* Raymond IV is imprisoned by Tancred, nephew of Bohemond I, and regent of the Principality of Antioch (he is later released after promising to denounce any claims).
* Dagobert of Pisa is briefly deposed as Patriarch of Jerusalem (he is restored later in the year).
* The Venetians establish a new trade emporium in Sidon (modern Lebanon).

==== Europe ====
* May 5 – The short-lived principality created by Rodrigo Diaz de Vivar ends: Valencia is captured by Almoravid forces under Sultan Yusuf ibn Tashfin. It is later recaptured, evacuated and burned by King Alfonso VI.
* June 4 – Władysław I Herman, duke of Poland, dies at Płock (possibly poisoned by his enemies) after a 23-year reign. He leaves the succession to be disputed between his sons Zbigniew and Bolesław III Wrymouth. 
* The Pacta Conventa formed by the Croatian nobility, recognize King Coloman as their overlord, initiating the personal union between the two kingdoms. Coloman is crowned king of Croatia (until 1116).

==== England ====
* King Henry I captures Arundel Castle after having besieged Earl Robert of Bellême. Robert loses his English lands (as did his brothers Roger the Poitevin and Arnulf de Montgomery) and is banished to Normandy.

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* Council of London: A church council convened by Anselm, archbishop of Canterbury, bans sodomy and the sale of Christian slaves to non-Christian countries, and reforms the clergy.
* Henry I orders the tomb of Edward the Confessor be opened; the body of the former king is supposedly found undecayed. The Westminster monks start to claim Edward as a saint.

<text>Year 1104 ([[Roman numerals|MCIV]]) was a leap year starting on Friday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Byzantine Empire ====
* Summer – The Byzantines re-occupy the Cilician cities of Tarsus, Adana and Mamistra. A naval squadron, under Admiral Cantacuzenus, pursues in Cypriot waters a Genoese raiding fleet, and sails on to Latakia, where they capture the harbour and the lower city. Bohemond I reinforces the garrison in the citadel.

==== Levant ====
* Spring – The Crusaders, led by Bohemond I, re-invade the territory of Aleppo, and try to capture the town of Kafar Latha. The attack fails, owing to the resistance of the local Banu tribe. Meanwhile, Joscelin of Courtenay cuts the communications between Aleppo and the Euphrates.
* May 7 – Battle of Harran: The Crusaders under Baldwin II are defeated by the Seljuk Turks. Baldwin and Joscelin of Courtenay are taken prisoner. Tancred (nephew of Bohemond I) becomes regent of Edessa. The defeat at Harran marks a key turning point of Crusader expansion. 
* May 26 – King Baldwin I captures Acre, the port is besieged from April, and blockaded by the Genoese and Pisan fleet. Baldwin promises a free passage to those who want to move to Ascalon, but the Italian sailors plunder the wealthy Muslim emigrants and kill many of them.
* Autumn – Bohemond I departs to Italy for reinforcements. He takes with him gold and silver, and precious stuff to raise an army against Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. Tancred becomes co-ruler over Antioch – and appoints his brother-in-law, Richard of Salerno, as his deputy.
* Toghtekin, Seljuk ruler (&quot;atabeg&quot;) of Damascus, founds a short-lived principality in Syria (the first example of a series of Seljuk-ruled dynasties).

==== England ====
* September 3 – St. Cuthbert is reburied in Durham Cathedral.

==== Europe ====
* September 28 – Alfonso I becomes king of Aragon and Navarre (after the death of his half-brother Peter I).
* King David IV of Georgia defeats 100,000 Seljuk Turks with only 1,500 warriors (approximate date).
* Sultan Kilij Arslan I of the Sultanate of Rum starts a war with the Danishmendids.
* The Venetian Arsenal is founded in Venice.

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* April 21 – The new basilica at Vézelay Abbey (located in northern Burgundy in France) is dedicated.

==== Volcanology ====
* Autumn – The volcano Hekla erupts in Iceland and devastates farms for 45 miles (some 70 km) around.&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

* Euphrosyne of Polotsk, Kievan princess (d. 1167)
* Fujiwara no Kiyosuke, Japanese &quot;waka&quot; poet (d. 1177)

* Ibn Zafar al Siqilli, Arab-Sicilian politician (d. 1170)
* Robert de Beaumont, 2nd Earl of Leicester (d. 1168)
* Vladimir Volodarevich, Galician prince (d. 1152)

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Levant ====
* February 28 – Raymond IV dies at his castle of Mons Peregrinus (&quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Mountain&quot;) near Tripoli. Raymond leaves his 2-year-old son Alfonso I by his third wife, Elvira of Castile, to rule the County of Tripoli. Raymond&#x27;s nephew William-Jordan, count of Cerdagne, becomes regent over Alfonso. Bertrand, the eldest son of Raymond, inherits the title &#x27;Count of Toulouse&#x27;.
* April 20 – Battle of Artah: The Crusaders under Tancred, Norman prince and regent of Antioch, defeat a Seljuk army (some 7,000 men) at Artah (modern-day Reyhanlı). Tancred threatens Aleppo, capital of Sultan Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan, and expands his conquest by conquering more territory east of the Orontes River with minor opposition.
* August 27 – Battle of Ramla: The Crusaders under King Baldwin I defeat a Fatimid expeditionary force (some 15,000 men) at Ramla. Baldwin pillages the enemy camp – but does not further pursue the Fatimids. The battle ends in the last large-scale attempt of the Fatimids to reconquer Palestine.

==== Europe ====
* The Almoravid emir, Yusuf ibn Tashfin, sends a maritime expedition to Palestine from Sevilla to ward off the Crusaders and perhaps to reconquer Jerusalem. The fleet of about seventy ships rushes into a storm in the Mediterranean Sea, and is never seen again.
* Bohemond I, Norman prince of Antioch, arrives in Apulia (Southern Italy) after an absence of 9 years. He travels to Rome and meets Pope Paschal II. His cousin, Roger II becomes count of Sicily.

<text>The Rime of the Ancient Mariner (originally The Rime of the Ancyent Marinere), written by English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge in 1797–98 and published in 1798 in the first edition of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, is a poem that recounts the experiences of a sailor who has returned from a long sea voyage. Some modern editions use a revised version printed in 1817 that featured a gloss.

The poem tells of the mariner stopping a man who is on his way to a wedding ceremony so that the mariner can share his story. The Wedding-Guest&#x27;s reaction turns from amusement to impatience to fear to fascination as the mariner&#x27;s story progresses, as can be seen in the language style; Coleridge uses narrative techniques such as personification and repetition to create a sense of danger, the supernatural, or serenity, depending on the mood in different parts of the poem.

The &quot;Rime&quot; is Coleridge&#x27;s longest major poem. It is often considered a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature.

== Synopsis ==
The poem begins with an old grey-bearded sailor, the Mariner, stopping a guest at a wedding ceremony to tell him a story of a sailing voyage he took long ago. The Wedding-Guest is at first reluctant to listen, as the ceremony is about to begin, but the mariner&#x27;s glittering eye captivates him.

The mariner&#x27;s tale begins with his ship departing on its journey. Despite initial good fortune, the ship is driven south by a storm and eventually reaches the icy waters of the Antarctic. An albatross appears and leads the ship out of the ice jam where it is stuck, but even as the albatross is fed and praised by the ship&#x27;s crew, the mariner shoots the bird:

The crew is angry with the mariner, believing the albatross brought the south wind that led them out of the Antarctic. However, the sailors change their minds when the weather becomes warmer and the mist disappears:

They soon find that they made a grave mistake in supporting this crime, as it arouses the wrath of spirits who then pursue the ship &quot;from the land of mist and snow&quot;; the south wind that had initially blown them north now sends the ship into uncharted waters near the equator, where it is :

The sailors change their minds again and blame the mariner for the torment of their thirst. In anger, the crew forces the mariner to wear the dead albatross about his neck, perhaps to illustrate the burden he must suffer from killing it, or perhaps as a sign of regret:

After a &quot;weary time&quot;, the ship encounters a ghostly hulk. On board are Death (a skeleton) and the &quot;Night-mare Life-in-Death&quot;, a deathly pale woman, who are playing dice for the souls of the crew. With a roll of the dice, Death wins the lives of the crew members and Life-in-Death the life of the mariner, a prize she considers more valuable. Her name is a clue to the mariner&#x27;s fate: he will endure a fate worse than death as punishment for his killing of the albatross. One by one, all of the crew members die, but the mariner lives on, seeing for seven days and nights the curse in the eyes of the crew&#x27;s corpses, whose last expressions remain upon their faces:

Eventually, this stage of the mariner&#x27;s curse is lifted after he begins to appreciate the many sea creatures swimming in the water. Despite his cursing them as &quot;slimy things&quot; earlier in the poem, he suddenly sees their true beauty and blesses them (&quot;A spring of love gush&#x27;d from my heart, And I bless&#x27;d them unaware&quot;). As he manages to pray, the albatross falls from his neck and his guilt is partially expiated. It then starts to rain, and the bodies of the crew, possessed by good spirits, rise again and help steer the ship. In a trance, the mariner hears two spirits discussing his voyage and penance, and learns that the ship is being powered supernaturally:

Finally the mariner wakes from his trance and comes in sight of his homeland, but is initially uncertain as to whether or not he is hallucinating:

The rotten remains of the ship sink in a whirlpool, leaving only the mariner behind. A hermit on the mainland who has spotted the approaching ship comes to meet it in a boat, rowed by a pilot and his boy. When they pull the mariner from the water, they think he is dead, but when he opens his mouth, the pilot shrieks with fright. The hermit prays, and the mariner picks up the oars to row. The pilot&#x27;s boy laughs, thinking the mariner is the devil, and cries, &quot;The Devil knows how to row&quot;. Back on land, the mariner is compelled by &quot;a woful agony&quot; to tell the hermit his story.

As penance for shooting the albatross, the mariner, driven by the agony of his guilt, is now forced to wander the earth, telling his story over and over, and teaching a lesson to those he meets:

After finishing his story, the mariner leaves, and the wedding-guest returns home, waking the next morning &quot;a sadder and a wiser man&quot;.

The poem received mixed reviews from critics, and Coleridge was once told by the publisher that most of the book&#x27;s sales were to sailors who thought it was a naval songbook. Coleridge made several modifications to the poem over the years. In the second edition of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;, published in 1800, he replaced many of the archaic words.

==Inspiration for the poem==
The poem may have been inspired by James Cook&#x27;s second voyage of exploration (1772–1775) of the South Seas and the Pacific Ocean; Coleridge&#x27;s tutor, William Wales, was the astronomer on Cook&#x27;s flagship and had a strong relationship with Cook. On this second voyage Cook crossed three times into the Antarctic Circle to determine whether the fabled great southern continent Terra Australis existed. Critics have also suggested that the poem may have been inspired by the voyage of Thomas James into the Arctic.

According to Wordsworth, the poem was inspired while Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Wordsworth&#x27;s sister Dorothy were on a walking tour through the Quantock Hills in Somerset. The discussion had turned to a book that Wordsworth was reading, that described a privateering voyage in 1719 during which a melancholy sailor, Simon Hatley, shot a black albatross.
As they discussed Shelvocke&#x27;s book, Wordsworth proffered the following developmental critique to Coleridge, which importantly contains a reference to tutelary spirits: &quot;Suppose you represent him as having killed one of these birds on entering the south sea, and the tutelary spirits of these regions take upon them to avenge the crime.&quot; By the time the trio finished their walk, the poem had taken shape.

Bernard Martin argues in &quot;The Ancient Mariner and the Authentic Narrative&quot; that Coleridge was also influenced by the life of Anglican clergyman John Newton, who had a near-death experience aboard a slave ship.

The poem may also have been inspired by the legends of the Wandering Jew, who was forced to wander the earth until Judgement Day for a terrible crime, found in Charles Maturin&#x27;s &quot;Melmoth the Wanderer&quot;, M. G. Lewis&#x27; &quot;The Monk&quot; (a 1796 novel Coleridge reviewed), and the legend of the &quot;Flying Dutchman&quot;.

It is argued that the harbour at Watchet in Somerset was the primary inspiration for the poem, although some time before, John Cruikshank, a local acquaintance of Coleridge&#x27;s, had related a dream about a skeleton ship crewed by spectral sailors. In September 2003, a commemorative statue, by Alan B. Herriot of Penicuik, Scotland, was unveiled at Watchet harbour.

==Coleridge&#x27;s comments==
In &quot;Biographia Literaria&quot;, Coleridge wrote:

In &quot;Table Talk&quot;, Coleridge wrote:

==Wordsworth&#x27;s comments==
Wordsworth wrote to Joseph Cottle in 1799:

However, when &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; was reprinted, Wordsworth included it despite Coleridge&#x27;s objections, writing:

== Early criticisms ==

Upon its release, the poem was criticized for being obscure and difficult to read. The use of archaic spelling of words was seen as not in keeping with Wordsworth&#x27;s claims of using common language. Criticism was renewed again in 1815–1816, when Coleridge added marginal notes to the poem that were also written in an archaic style. These notes or glosses, placed next to the text of the poem, ostensibly interpret the verses much like marginal notes found in the Bible. There were many opinions on why Coleridge inserted the gloss.

Charles Lamb, who had deeply admired the original for its attention to &quot;Human Feeling&quot;, claimed that the gloss distanced the audience from the narrative, weakening the poem&#x27;s effects. The entire poem was first published in the collection of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot;. Another version of the poem was published in the 1817 collection entitled &quot;Sibylline Leaves&quot; (see 1817 in poetry).

==Interpretations==
On a surface level the poem explores a violation of nature and the resulting psychological effects on the mariner and on all those who hear him. According to Jerome McGann the poem is like a salvation story. The poem&#x27;s structure is multi-layered text based on Coleridge&#x27;s interest in higher criticism. &quot;Like the &quot;Iliad&quot; or &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; or any great historical product, the &quot;Rime&quot; is a work of trans-historical rather than so-called universal significance. This verbal distinction is important because it calls attention to a real one. Like The Divine Comedy or any other poem, the &quot;Rime&quot; is not valued or used always or everywhere or by everyone in the same way or for the same reasons.&quot;

Whalley (1947) suggests that the Ancient Mariner is an autobiographical portrait of Coleridge himself, comparing the mariner&#x27;s loneliness with Coleridge&#x27;s own feelings of loneliness expressed in his letters and journals.

In &quot;Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson&quot; (1990), Camille Paglia applies a conventionally gendered sexual Fruedian psychoanalysis and suggests that the Bridegroom, Wedding-Guest and Mariner all represent aspects of Coleridge: &quot;The Bridegroom is a masculine persona&quot; that is &quot;integrated with society&quot;, and that the Wedding-Guest is an adolescent seeking &quot;sexual fulfilment and collective joy&quot;, that must merge with the Bridegroom but is unable to because of the appearance of a spectre-self, a &quot;male heroine&quot; who &quot;luxuriates in passive suffering&quot;.

==Versions of the poem==
Coleridge often made changes to his poems and &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; was no exception – he produced at least eighteen different versions over the years. He regarded revision as an essential part of creating poetry. The first published version of the poem was in &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; in 1798. The second edition of this anthology in 1800 included a revised text, requested by Coleridge, in which some of the language and many of the archaic spellings were modernised. He also reduced the title to &quot;The Ancient Mariner&quot; but for later versions the longer title was restored. The 1802 and 1805 editions of &quot;Lyrical Ballads&quot; had minor textual changes. In 1817 Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Sibylline Leaves&quot; anthology included a new version with an extensive marginal gloss, written by the poet. The last version he produced was in 1834.

Traditionally literary critics regarded each revision of a text by an author as producing a more authoritative version and Coleridge published somewhat revised versions of the poem in his &quot;Poetical Works&quot; anthology editions of 1828, 1829, and lastly in 1834—the year of his death. More recently scholars look to the earliest version, even in manuscript, as the most authoritative but for this poem no manuscript is extant. Hence the editors of the edition of &quot;Collected Poems&quot; published in 1972 used the 1798 version but made their own modernisation of the spelling and they added some passages taken from later editions.

The 1817 edition, the one most used today and the first to be published under Coleridge&#x27;s own name rather than anonymously, added a new Latin epigraph but the major change was the addition of the gloss that has a considerable effect on the way the poem reads. Coleridge&#x27;s grandson E.H. Coleridge produced a detailed study of the published versions of the poem. Over all, Coleridge&#x27;s revisions resulted in the poem losing thirty-nine lines and an introductory prose &quot;Argument&quot;, and gaining fifty-eight glosses and a Latin epigraph.

In general the anthologies included printed lists of &quot;errata&quot; and, in the case of the particularly lengthy list in &quot;Sibylline Leaves&quot;, the list was included at the beginning of the volume. Such changes were often editorial rather than merely correcting errors. Coleridge also made handwritten changes in printed volumes of his work, particularly when he presented them as gifts to friends.

==In popular culture==

In addition to being referred to in several other notable works, due to the popularity of the poem, the phrase &quot;albatross around one&#x27;s neck&quot; has become an English-language idiom referring to &quot;a heavy burden of guilt that becomes an obstacle to success&quot;.

The phrase &quot;Water, water, every where, / Nor any drop to drink&quot; has appeared widely in popular culture, but usually given in a more natural modern phrasing as &quot;Water, water, everywhere / &quot;But not a&quot; drop to drink&quot;; some such appearances have, in turn, played on the frequency with which these lines are misquoted.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* May 24 – Duke Skule Bårdsson, claimant to the Norwegian throne, is defeated by King Haakon IV (the Old) and his supporters. He seeks refuge in Elgeseter Priory in Trondheim, and Haakon burns down the monastery, in which Skule is burned alive. Haakon becomes the undisputed ruler; this ends the civil war era in Norway, after 110 years.
* July 15 – Battle of the Neva: A Swedish army under Bishop Thomas sails up the Gulf of Finland in their longboats. They proceed into the Neva River with the aim of seizing control over Lake Ladoga and from there, striking at the city of Novgorod. Prince Alexander rallies his &quot;druzhina&quot; comparable to the &#x27;household&#x27; of western European countries, and decisively routs the Swedish forces, saving the Novgorod Republic from a full-scale enemy invasion from the North. As a result, Alexander wins his first military victory at the age of 19 and receives the title of Nevsky.
* August – Siege of Faenza: Frederick II lays siege to the town of Faenza during the war of the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Meanwhile, Frederick makes an alliance with Pisa to support his campaign against the Papal States.
* Winter – Alexander Nevsky quarrels with the Kievan nobles (&quot;boyars&quot;) and merchants of Novgorod, probably about peaceful trade with the westerners. He is banished, along with his mother, wife, and his &quot;druzhina&quot; to take up residence in the region around Moscow, a minor town on the western border of the Principality of Vladimir-Suzdal.
* Reconquista: King Sancho II (the Pious) conquers the city of Ayamonte from the Almoravids, securing the Portuguese position in Al-Andalus.

==== Africa ====
* Summer – As-Salih Ayyub becomes ruler of Egypt, after deposing his half-brother Al-Adil II. Meanwhile, other members of the Ayyubid Dynasty are conspiring to depose him and replace him with his uncle, As-Salih Ismail. During his reign, As-Salih begins buying large numbers of Kipchak slaves, to form an elite core in the Egyptian army, known as Mamluks.

==== Levant ====
* October 10 – Richard of Cornwall, brother of King Henry III, arrives at Acre for a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. His pilgrimage has the approval of Emperor Frederick II, who is married to his younger sister, Isabella of England, and gives him the task to make arrangements with the Military Orders. On his arrival, Richard travels to Ascalon, where he is met by ambassadors from As-Salih Ayyub. As a negotiator, he is successful in the release of prisoners captured at Gaza (see 1239), and he also assists with the building of the citadel in Ascalon.

==== Mongol Empire ====
* Winter – The Mongols under Batu Khan cross the frozen Dnieper River and lay siege to the city of Kiev. On December 6, the walls are rendered rubble by Chinese catapults and the Mongols pour into the city. Brutal hand-to-hand street fighting occurs, the Kievans are eventually forced to fall back to the central parts of the city. Many people take refuge in the Church of the Blessed Virgin. As scores of terrified Kievans climb onto the Church&#x27;s upper balcony to shield themselves from Mongol arrows, their collective weight strains its infrastructure, causing the roof to collapse and crush countless citizens under its weight. Of a total population of 50,000, all but 2,000 are massacred.

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* June 12 – The Disputation of Paris begins at the court of King Louis IX (the Saint), where four rabbis defend the Talmud against Nicholas Donin&#x27;s accusations of blasphemy.
* Pope Gregory IX authorizes a Crusade against Novgorod, hoping that the Kievan Rus&#x27; will be too preoccupied dealing with the raiding Mongols to the east to defend.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* Spring – Prince Alexander Nevsky is joined by his brother Andrey II (Yaroslavich) at Novgorod, supported with his elite &quot;druzhina&quot; (or &#x27;household&#x27;) from Suzdal. They head southwest across the frozen marshes, which cover much of the land between Novgorod and Pskov. On March 5, Alexander retakes the city almost without a struggle, before the larger Crusader garrison in nearby Izborsk can intervene.
* April – A Russian force led by Alexander Nevsky crosses the frontier between Novgorod and Livonian Crusader territory, to raid into Catholic Estonia. After that, Alexander breaks his army off into contingents to ravage the countryside. He is forced to turn back, when a local Crusader force under Bishop Hermann von Buxhövden defeats Alexander&#x27;s advance guard at Mooste bridge south of Tartu.
* April 5 – Battle of Lake Peipus (or Battle on the Ice): Russian forces led by Alexander Nevsky, rebuff an invasion attempt by a Crusader army (some 2,600 men), including German Teutonic Knights. The opposing armies meet upon the frozen surface of Lake Peipus. The outnumbered Teutonic Knights are defeated on the slippery surface, by Alexander&#x27;s elite &quot;druzhina&quot; and the Novgorod forces.
* May 28 – Avignonet massacre: A group of Cathars, with the probable connivance of Count Raymond VII of Toulouse, murder the inquisitor William Arnaud and eleven of his companions.
* July 21–22 – Battle of Taillebourg: French forces (some 25,000 men) under King Louis IX (the Saint) defeat King Henry III at the bridge over the Charente River near Taillebourg. After the battle, Louis continues to pursue the English troops, capturing many prisoners. Henry retreats with the remnants of his army to Bordeaux, where he spends the winter.
* Summer – Alexander Nevsky sends envoys to Batu Khan, preemptively capitulating before the Mongols even though they have not reached Novgorod, and accepts his rule as Mongol overlord.
* November 16 – King Béla IV issues the Golden Bull to the inhabitants of Gradec (modern-day Zagreb) and Samobor in Croatia. By this golden bull, Béla proclaimes Gradec a royal free city.
* Siegfried III, archbishop of Mainz, conquers Wiesbaden (a free imperial city) and orders the city&#x27;s destruction, during the war of Emperor Frederick II against the Papal States.
* King Sancho II (the Pious) conquers the cities of Tavira, Alvor and Paderne, in his continuing expansion against the Muslims, known as the Reconquista.

==== Mongol Empire ====
* Spring – Siege of Esztergom: The Mongols under Batu Khan assault and destroy most of the Hungarian city of Esztergom. Batu Khan sends a reconnaissance party against the Holy Roman Empire. 
* Battle of Grobnik Field: Croatian forces under Béla IV stop the Mongol invasion in Hungary and Croatia. Béla rebuilds the country and orders the building of fortifications through his kingdom.
* Batu Khan establishes the Golden Horde at Sarai and withdraws his forces after messengers arrive with the news that the Great Khan Ögedei Khan has died (see 1241).

==== England ====
* May – Isabella of Angoulême, mother of Henry III, persuades him to mount an expedition to retake Poitou. On May 20, Henry arrives at Royan and joins the rebelling French nobles – forming an army (some 30,000 men). Louis IX exchanges letters with Henry to resolve the conflict, but the dispute escalates further.

==== Africa ====
* Summer – In the Maghreb, after a string of successes against the Almohad Caliphate, Hafsid forces under Sultan Abu Zakariya Yahya, conquer the city of Tlemcen (modern Algeria). The Kingdom of Tlemcen becomes a vassal of Abu Zakariya, and is formed in a series of small states between his rule and the states of the Western Maghreb.

==== Middle East ====
* Spring – The Templar Knights raid the city of Hebron. Meanwhile, An-Nasir Dawud, Ayyubid ruler of Damascus, sends forces to cut off the road to Jerusalem, and to levy tolls on the pilgrims and merchants that pass by.

* Death of Abbasid caliph al-Mustansir and succession of al-Musta&#x27;sim to the Caliphal throne.

==== Asia ====
* February 10 – The 10-year-old Emperor Shijō of Japan dies suddenly; despite a dispute over who should follow him as sovereign, Go-Saga (son of former Emperor Tsuchimikado) ascends to the throne.

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* William of Modena, Italian bishop and papal diplomat, sets up four dioceses in Poland, including the Archdiocese of Warmia.

<text>Year 1243 ([[Roman numerals|MCCXLIII]]) was a common year starting on Thursday of the Julian calendar.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* March – King Ferdinand III (the Saint) turns the independent Taifa of Murcia into a protectorate, and initiates the process of the colonization and Christianization of the region. He receives the submission of the Moors, under the terms of a peace agreement (the famous Treaty of Alcaraz).
* April 27 – Treaty of Bordeaux: King Louis IX (the Saint) and King Henry III agree to a truce that ends the Saintonge War. The truce does not stop the on-going clashes (and further tensions) between France and England.
* Siege of Viterbo: Emperor Frederick II besieges Viterbo on request of the rebel citizens. The defenders are able to set fire to the siege towers and after signing a peace treaty, Frederick is persuaded to withdraw his army.
* Siege of Montségur: French forces (some 10,000 men) begin the siege of Château de Montségur to raze the stronghold held by the rebellious Cathars. The castle is defended by some 100 troops and 500 refugees.
* May 1 – The Castillan troops are garrisoned in Murcia, to support the Hudid Dynasty.

==== England ====
* Spring – Henry III bestows the custody of Kenilworth Castle to Simon de Montfort. Simon&#x27;s wife Eleanor, Henry&#x27;s sister, already owned Odiham Castle (or King John&#x27;s Castle) so Simon has two of the strongest fortresses in England under his control.

==== Levant ====
* June 12 – A Crusader force under Balian III, lord of Beirut, captures Tyre after a long siege. The barons seize the citadel on July 10, with the help of Alice, queen of Cyprus, whose forces arrive on June 15. This ending the War of the Lombards.

==== Mongol Empire ====
* June 26 – Battle of Köse Dağ: The Mongols under Baiju Noyan defeat the Seljuk Turks of the Sultanate of Rum and their Byzantine allies. The Seljuks and the Empire of Trebizond become vassals of the Mongols.
