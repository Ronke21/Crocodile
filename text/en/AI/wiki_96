<text>Allen Granberry Thurman (November 13, 1813 – December 12, 1895), sometimes erroneously spelled Allan Granberry Thurman, was an American politician who served as a United States representative, Ohio Supreme Court justice, and United States senator. A Democrat, he unsuccessfully ran for vice president of the United States in 1888 as the running mate of President Grover Cleveland.

Born in Lynchburg, Virginia, he and his family moved to Chillicothe, Ohio, when Thurman was young. Thurman established a legal practice in Chillicothe with his uncle, William Allen, who later represented Ohio in the U.S. Senate. Thurman won election to the House of Representatives in 1844, becoming the youngest member of that body. He supported the James K. Polk administration during the Mexican–American War and voted for the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery from any territory gained from Mexico. He served a single term in the House before joining the Supreme Court of Ohio. He narrowly lost the 1867 Ohio gubernatorial election to Rutherford B. Hayes. He won election to the Senate in 1869, becoming an opponent to the Republican Reconstruction policy. He actively campaigned against African-American voting rights and worked to reverse the civil rights advances of Reconstruction. He offered an amendment to continue to segregate public schools in the District of Columbia. During the disputed 1876 presidential election, Thurman helped establish the Electoral Commission. Thurman lost re-election in 1881 as the Republicans had won control of the Ohio legislature.

Thurman was a &quot;favorite son&quot; candidate for president in 1880 and 1884. The 1888 Democratic National Convention selected him as President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s running mate, as Vice President Thomas A. Hendricks had died in office. The aging Thurman did not actively campaign and the Democratic ticket was defeated.

==Early years==
Allen Granberry Thurman was born in Lynchburg, Virginia, to Pleasant Thurman and Mary Granberry Allen Thurman. Both of his parents were teachers; his father also a Methodist minister. In 1815, his parents emancipated their slaves and moved to Chillicothe, Ohio. He attended Chillicothe Academy, an academy run by his mother, and then studied law as an apprentice to his uncle, William Allen (who later became a senator from Ohio). At the age of eighteen, Thurman worked on a land survey, and at twenty-one became private secretary to the Governor of Ohio, Robert Lucas. In 1835 he was admitted to the Ohio bar and became his uncle&#x27;s law partner. In 1837 his uncle entered the Senate.

==Career in government==

===Congressman===
The same year he was elected to the House of Representatives as its youngest member. He generally supported the majority of the Democrats on all issues except internal improvements, on which he tended to vote with the Whigs. He supported the Polk Administration&#x27;s conduct of the Mexican–American War, spoke in favor of the 54°40&#x27; northern limit to the Oregon territory, and voted for the Wilmot Proviso, which would have banned slavery from the territory gained from Mexico. His support for the latter was due to anti-African-American prejudice, as he wanted to reserve this territory for white settlement. After a single two-year term, he left the House voluntarily to resume private law practice.

===State Supreme Court Justice===
In 1851 he was elected to a four-year term (February 1852 – February 1856) on the Ohio Supreme Court, the last year as the chief justice. He then returned to private law practice in Columbus. Thurman spoke out against the repeal of the Missouri Compromise and opposed the pro-slavery Lecompton constitution for Kansas. In 1860 he was a supporter of Stephen A. Douglas for President. A &quot;peace Democrat&quot; or &quot;Copperhead,&quot; he never accepted the right of a state to secede but felt it was unwise to fight a state that had already left the Union, and during the American Civil War he was opposed to Lincoln&#x27;s policies, especially on emancipation. While he supported the war effort, he encouraged compromise and a political settlement.

===Candidate for Governor===

In 1867, he ran for Governor of Ohio, on a platform opposed to extending suffrage to blacks, but lost to future U.S. president Rutherford B. Hayes in a close election. Statewide Democrats including Thurman ran a banner under the slogan &quot;No Negro Equality!&quot;

During the campaign, Thurman appealed to white supremacist attitudes in virulent tones, vowing to fight &quot;the thralldom of n*****ism.&quot; In Ohio, like most Northern states, black suffrage referendums failed to pass due to small fractions of Republican voters joining Democratic opposition. The issue thus became seized upon by Democratic politicians in race-baiting rhetoric.

===U.S. Senator===
The Ohio voters chose a Democratic state legislature, however, which selected Thurman as senator for the term beginning in 1869. He there became a strong opponent of the Republicans&#x27; Reconstruction measures. In 1873 Thurman crafted a strategy that led to Ohio choosing once more a Democratic legislature, and electing Thurman&#x27;s uncle William Allen as governor. The legislature elected Thurman to another term in the Senate. During the twelve years he served in the Senate, he became the leader of the Democrats in that body. He was known for constant hard work, good preparation, and courteous treatment of his opponents, and other members ranked him among the top three senators of his time, in terms of ability. He came nearest, a Washington correspondent concluded, to &quot;the beau ideal of a Senator of any man on his side of the House. He has fine passing power of cutting up his political opponents, saying a word of encouragement to some Republican when he is down, and scattering the caucuses of the opposite side with a pistol shot.&quot; His prepared speeches were clear and cogent, but it was in debate that he showed himself at his most picturesque. &quot;He would wave his red bandana pocket handkerchief like a guidon, give his nose a trumpet-blast, take a fresh pinch of snuff, and dash into the debate, dealing rough blows, and scattering the carefully prepared arguments of his adversaries like chaff,&quot; a Washington long-time reporter remembered. He kept up a close friendship with his chief sparring partner on the opposite side, George F. Edmunds of Vermont. Journalists told how at a given signal—a long blow of his nose—he would get ready to exit the Senate so that the two could meet in the Judiciary Committee room to share a liberal amount of Kentucky Bourbon.

&quot;When I speak of the law,&quot; Senator Roscoe Conkling of New York once said, &quot;I turn to the Senator as the Mussulman turns towards Mecca. I look to him only as I would look to the common law of England, the world&#x27;s most copious volume of human jurisprudence.&quot; In particular he made himself the critic of giveaways to the large railroad corporations and of Republicans&#x27; Reconstruction policies. &quot;A fine juicy roast of land grants is what sends Thurman&#x27;s tongue a-wagging,&quot; wrote one reporter.

An advocate of free trade, Thurman bemoaned of protective tariffs as a taxation upon &quot;everything one wears from the crown of his head to the soles.&quot;

In the 1876–1877 electoral college crisis, he helped to arrive at the solution of creating the Electoral Commission to settle the controversy, and ultimately served as one of the members of the commission, as one of the five Senators (one of the two Senate Democrats, and one of the seven Democrats altogether). As a Democrat, he voted with the seven-member minority, in favor of the Samuel J. Tilden electors in all cases, but the Republican majority prevailed in all the votes, and Thurman&#x27;s 1867 gubernatorial opponent, Rutherford B. Hayes (who had returned to the governorship by defeating Thurman&#x27;s uncle), became president. One of the House of Representatives&#x27; members of the commission, fellow Ohioan James Garfield, was to become the president four years later, after being chosen by the now-Republican Ohio legislature to succeed Thurman. Both men were lifelong friends.

&quot;To look at Thurman one would suppose that his favorite reading was &quot;Foxe&#x27;s Book of the Martyrs&#x27; and &quot;Baxter&#x27;s Saints&#x27; Rest,&#x27;&quot; a reporter wrote, &quot;for Thurman&#x27;s face certainly carries a heavier pressure of solemnity to the square inch than any face I ever saw.&quot; In fact, he was a wide reader, fond of Voltaire, Chateaubriand, Renan, and the lighter French novels, and colleagues admitted him the best French scholar in the Senate. He had picked up French from one Monsieur Gregoire, a tutor in his childhood, and in retirement continued reading French novels in the original language.

In the Senate, Thurman served on the Judiciary Committee, becoming its chairman when the Democrats won control of the Senate in the 46th Congress. He became President pro tempore of the Senate on April 15, 1879, being the first Democrat to hold this position in nearly twenty years. He briefly served as president of the Senate because of the illness of Vice President William A. Wheeler, before Ohio chose a Republican legislature, which would not reelect Thurman. They first chose Garfield, but on his election to the Presidency, selected John Sherman to succeed Thurman beginning in 1881. Garfield did appoint Thurman as American representative to the international monetary conference in Paris, a selection that Republican senators welcomed: they regretted his departure from among them. It was noted that in twelve years in the chamber, he had never had an angry word with any colleague, and noted, too, that he left the Senate as poor as he had come to it.

===Candidate for vice president===

Thurman spent his retirement reading French novels in the original language, playing whist, and amusing himself with mathematical problems; he had a reputation as one of the best mathematicians in Ohio. He was put forth as a favorite son candidate in the Democratic presidential nominating conventions in 1880 and 1884. In 1888, he was selected as President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s running mate, because Vice President Thomas Hendricks had died in office in November 1885. Democrats turned his red bandana handkerchief into an emblem of the campaign, tying red bandanas to the top of canes in political parades, and manufacturing bandanas with the candidates&#x27; faces on them. Thurman&#x27;s appeal came from his popularity among old-line Democrats, distrustful of Grover Cleveland&#x27;s liberalism, and his known hostility to railroad monopolists. All the same, Thurman, who had retired from active politics, could not put on an active campaign, and added little to the ticket&#x27;s chances.

Among the issues emphasized by the Cleveland/Thurman campaign included support for a reduction of taxes and protective tariffs.

In the concurrent 1884 United States Senate election in Ohio, Thurman did not oppose the campaign of incumbent Democratic senator George H. Pendleton, who faced opposition from the statewide party due to his sponsoring of the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act that ended patronage politics in the United States.

When Cleveland was re-nominated for the presidency in June 1892, Thurman supported him but was not a candidate for vice president. Cleveland and running mate Adlai Stevenson went on to win the general election that November.

==Personal life==

On November 14, 1844, Thurman married Mary Anderson Dun Tompkins of Lexington, Kentucky. Her father was a wealthy landowner named Walter Dun, and she had been married until 1840 when her first husband died. Together, Thurman and his wife had five children, including:
* Allen W. Thurman, eugenicist and baseball executive
* Mary Thurman, who married William S. Cowles, Thomas Scott Gifford, and Bug Holliday
* Elizabeth Thurman, who married Arizona governor Richard Cunningham McCormick

He was known as the &quot;Old Roman&quot;.

==Death and burial ==
Thurman died on December 12, 1895, at his home in Columbus and is buried at Green Lawn Cemetery.

==Legacy==
Following the 2021 United States Capitol attack, Democrats charged that Donald Trump was responsible for the violence and sought to impeach and remove him from office. When the articles of impeachment passed the U.S. House of Representatives and reached the Senate, by which Trump already left office, Chuck Schumer of New York cited a resolution by Thurman against Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Secretary of War William W. Belknap as a precedent for convicting Trump.

<doc id="44469" wikidata="Q339" url="?curid=44469" title="Pluto">
<text>Pluto (minor-planet designation: 134340 Pluto) is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, a ring of bodies beyond the orbit of Neptune. It is the ninth-largest and tenth-most-massive known object to directly orbit the Sun. It is the largest known trans-Neptunian object by volume by a small margin, but is less massive than Eris. Like other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto is made primarily of ice and rock and is much smaller than the inner planets. Pluto has roughly one-sixth the mass of the Moon, and one-third its volume.
Originally considered a planet, its status was changed when a new definition of the word was adopted by astronomers. 

Pluto has a moderately eccentric and inclined orbit, ranging from from the Sun. Light from the Sun takes 5.5 hours to reach Pluto at its orbital distance of . Pluto&#x27;s eccentric orbit periodically brings it closer to the Sun than Neptune, but a stable orbital resonance prevents them from colliding.

Pluto has five known moons: Charon, the largest, whose diameter is just over half that of Pluto; Styx; Nix; Kerberos; and Hydra. Pluto and Charon are sometimes considered a binary system because the barycenter of their orbits does not lie within either body, and they are tidally locked. &quot;New Horizons&quot; was the first spacecraft to visit Pluto and its moons, making a flyby on July 14, 2015, and taking detailed measurements and observations.

Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde W. Tombaugh, making it the first known object in the Kuiper belt. It was immediately hailed as the ninth planet. However, its planetary status was questioned when it was found to be much smaller than expected. These doubts increased following the discovery of additional objects in the Kuiper belt starting in the 1990s, particularly the more massive scattered disk object Eris in 2005. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) formally redefined the term &quot;planet&quot; to exclude dwarf planets such as Pluto. Many planetary astronomers, however, continue to consider Pluto and other dwarf planets to be planets.

== History ==

=== Discovery ===
In the 1840s, Urbain Le Verrier used Newtonian mechanics to predict the position of the then-undiscovered planet Neptune after analyzing perturbations in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent observations of Neptune in the late 19th century led astronomers to speculate that Uranus&#x27;s orbit was being disturbed by another planet besides Neptune.

In 1906, Percival Lowell—a wealthy Bostonian who had founded Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, in 1894—started an extensive project in search of a possible ninth planet, which he termed &quot;Planet X&quot;. By 1909, Lowell and William H. Pickering had suggested several possible celestial coordinates for such a planet. Lowell and his observatory conducted his search, using mathematical calculations made by Elizabeth Williams, until his death in 1916, but to no avail. Unknown to Lowell, his surveys had captured two faint images of Pluto on March 19 and April 7, 1915, but they were not recognized for what they were. There are fourteen other known precovery observations, with the earliest made by the Yerkes Observatory on August 20, 1909.

Percival&#x27;s widow, Constance Lowell, entered into a ten-year legal battle with the Lowell Observatory over her husband&#x27;s legacy, and the search for Planet X did not resume until 1929. Vesto Melvin Slipher, the observatory director, gave the job of locating Planet X to 23-year-old Clyde Tombaugh, who had just arrived at the observatory after Slipher had been impressed by a sample of his astronomical drawings.

Tombaugh&#x27;s task was to systematically image the night sky in pairs of photographs, then examine each pair and determine whether any objects had shifted position. Using a blink comparator, he rapidly shifted back and forth between views of each of the plates to create the illusion of movement of any objects that had changed position or appearance between photographs. On February 18, 1930, after nearly a year of searching, Tombaugh discovered a possible moving object on photographic plates taken on January 23 and 29. A lesser-quality photograph taken on January 21 helped confirm the movement. After the observatory obtained further confirmatory photographs, news of the discovery was telegraphed to the Harvard College Observatory on March 13, 1930.

One Plutonian year corresponds to 247.94 Earth years; thus, in 2178, Pluto will complete its first orbit since its discovery.

=== Name and symbol ===
The name &quot;Pluto&quot; came from the Roman god of the underworld; and it is also an epithet for Hades (the Greek equivalent of Pluto).

Upon the announcement of the discovery, Lowell Observatory received over a thousand suggestions for names. Three names topped the list: Minerva, Pluto and Cronus. &#x27;Minerva&#x27; was the Lowell staff&#x27;s first choice but was rejected because it had already been used for an asteroid; Cronus was disfavored because it was promoted by an unpopular and egocentric astronomer, Thomas Jefferson Jackson See. A vote was then taken and &#x27;Pluto&#x27; was the unanimous choice. To make sure the name stuck, and that the planet would not suffer changes in its name as Uranus had, Lowell Observatory proposed the name to the American Astronomical Society and the Royal Astronomical Society; both approved it unanimously. The name was published on May 1, 1930.

The name &quot;Pluto&quot; had received some 150 nominations among the letters and telegrams sent to Lowell. The first had been from Venetia Burney (1918–2009), an eleven-year-old schoolgirl in Oxford, England, who was interested in classical mythology. She had suggested it to her grandfather Falconer Madan when he read the news of Pluto&#x27;s discovery to his family over breakfast; Madan passed the suggestion to astronomy professor Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled it to colleagues at Lowell on March 16, three days after the announcement.

The name &#x27;Pluto&#x27; was mythologically appropriate: the god Pluto was one of six surviving children of Saturn, and the others had already all been chosen as names of major or minor planets (his brothers Jupiter and Neptune, and his sisters Ceres, Juno and Vesta). Both the god and the planet inhabited &quot;gloomy&quot; regions, and the god was able to make himself invisible, as the planet had been for so long. 
The choice was further helped by the fact that the first two letters of &quot;Pluto&quot; were the initials of Percival Lowell; indeed, &#x27;Percival&#x27; had been one of the more popular suggestions for a name for the new planet.
Pluto&#x27;s planetary symbol was then created as a monogram of the letters &quot;PL&quot;. This symbol is rarely used in astronomy anymore, though it is still common in astrology. However, the most common astrological symbol for Pluto, occasionally used in astronomy as well, is an orb (possibly representing Pluto&#x27;s invisibility cap) over Pluto&#x27;s bident , which dates to the early 1930s.

The name &#x27;Pluto&#x27; was soon embraced by wider culture. In 1930, Walt Disney was apparently inspired by it when he introduced for Mickey Mouse a canine companion named Pluto, although Disney animator Ben Sharpsteen could not confirm why the name was given. In 1941, Glenn T. Seaborg named the newly created element plutonium after Pluto, in keeping with the tradition of naming elements after newly discovered planets, following uranium, which was named after Uranus, and neptunium, which was named after Neptune.

Most languages use the name &quot;Pluto&quot; in various transliterations. In Japanese, Houei Nojiri suggested the calque , and this was borrowed into Chinese and Korean. Some languages of India use the name Pluto, but others, such as Hindi, use the name of &quot;Yama&quot;, the God of Death in Hinduism. Polynesian languages also tend to use the indigenous god of the underworld, as in Māori &quot;Whiro&quot;.
Vietnamese might be expected to follow Chinese, but does not because the Sino-Vietnamese word 冥 &quot;minh&quot; &quot;dark&quot; is homophonous with 明 &quot;minh&quot; &quot;bright&quot;. Vietnamese instead uses Yama, which is also a Buddhist deity, in the form of &quot;Sao Diêm Vương&quot; 星閻王 &quot;Yama&#x27;s Star&quot;, derived from Chinese 閻王 &quot;Yán Wáng / Yìhm Wòhng&quot; &quot;King Yama&quot;.

=== Planet X disproved ===
Once Pluto was found, its faintness and lack of a viewable disc cast doubt on the idea that it was Lowell&#x27;s Planet X. Estimates of Pluto&#x27;s mass were revised downward throughout the 20th century.
Astronomers initially calculated its mass based on its presumed effect on Neptune and Uranus. In 1931, Pluto was calculated to be roughly the mass of Earth, with further calculations in 1948 bringing the mass down to roughly that of Mars. In 1976, Dale Cruikshank, Carl Pilcher and David Morrison of the University of Hawaiʻi calculated Pluto&#x27;s albedo for the first time, finding that it matched that for methane ice; this meant Pluto had to be exceptionally luminous for its size and therefore could not be more than 1 percent the mass of Earth. (Pluto&#x27;s albedo is times that of Earth.)

In 1978, the discovery of Pluto&#x27;s moon Charon allowed the measurement of Pluto&#x27;s mass for the first time: roughly 0.2% that of Earth, and far too small to account for the discrepancies in the orbit of Uranus. Subsequent searches for an alternative Planet X, notably by Robert Sutton Harrington, failed. In 1992, Myles Standish used data from &quot;Voyager 2&quot;&#x27;s flyby of Neptune in 1989, which had revised the estimates of Neptune&#x27;s mass downward by 0.5%—an amount comparable to the mass of Mars—to recalculate its gravitational effect on Uranus. With the new figures added in, the discrepancies, and with them the need for a Planet X, vanished. the majority of scientists agree that Planet X, as Lowell defined it, does not exist. Lowell had made a prediction of Planet X&#x27;s orbit and position in 1915 that was fairly close to Pluto&#x27;s actual orbit and its position at that time; Ernest W. Brown concluded soon after Pluto&#x27;s discovery that this was a coincidence.

=== Classification ===
From 1992 onward, many bodies were discovered orbiting in the same volume as Pluto, showing that Pluto is part of a population of objects called the Kuiper belt. This made its official status as a planet controversial, with many questioning whether Pluto should be considered together with or separately from its surrounding population. Museum and planetarium directors occasionally created controversy by omitting Pluto from planetary models of the Solar System. In February 2000 the Hayden Planetarium in New York City displayed a Solar System model of only eight planets, which made headlines almost a year later.

Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta lost their planet status among most astronomers after the discovery of many other asteroids in the 1840s. On the other hand, planetary geologists often regarded Ceres, and less often Pallas and Vesta, as being different from smaller asteroids because they were large enough to have undergone geological evolution. Although the first Kuiper belt objects discovered were quite small, objects increasingly closer in size to Pluto were soon discovered, some large enough (like Pluto itself) to satisfy geological but not dynamical ideas of planethood. On July 29, 2005, the debate became unavoidable when astronomers at Caltech announced the discovery of a new trans-Neptunian object, Eris, which was substantially more massive than Pluto and the most massive object discovered in the Solar System since Triton in 1846. Its discoverers and the press initially called it the tenth planet, although there was no official consensus at the time on whether to call it a planet. Others in the astronomical community considered the discovery the strongest argument for reclassifying Pluto as a minor planet.

==== IAU classification ====

The debate came to a head in August 2006, with an IAU resolution that created an official definition for the term &quot;planet&quot;. According to this resolution, there are three conditions for an object in the Solar System to be considered a planet:
* The object must be in orbit around the Sun.
* The object must be massive enough to be rounded by its own gravity. More specifically, its own gravity should pull it into a shape defined by hydrostatic equilibrium.
* It must have cleared the neighborhood around its orbit.
Pluto fails to meet the third condition. Its mass is substantially less than the combined mass of the other objects in its orbit: 0.07 times, in contrast to Earth, which is 1.7 million times the remaining mass in its orbit (excluding the moon). The IAU further decided that bodies that, like Pluto, meet criteria 1 and 2, but do not meet criterion 3 would be called dwarf planets. In September 2006, the IAU included Pluto, and Eris and its moon Dysnomia, in their Minor Planet Catalogue, giving them the official minor-planet designations &quot;(134340) Pluto&quot;, &quot;(136199) Eris&quot;, and &quot;(136199) Eris I Dysnomia&quot;. Had Pluto been included upon its discovery in 1930, it would have likely been designated 1164, following 1163 Saga, which was discovered a month earlier.

There has been some resistance within the astronomical community toward the reclassification, and in particular planetary scientists often continue to reject it, considering Pluto, Charon, and Eris to be planets for the same reason they do so for Ceres. In effect, this amounts to accepting only the second clause of the IAU definition. Alan Stern, principal investigator with NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission to Pluto, derided the IAU resolution. He also stated that because less than five percent of astronomers voted for it, the decision was not representative of the entire astronomical community. Marc W. Buie, then at the Lowell Observatory, petitioned against the definition. Others have supported the IAU, for example Mike Brown, the astronomer who discovered Eris.

Public reception to the IAU decision was mixed. A resolution introduced in the California State Assembly facetiously called the IAU decision a &quot;scientific heresy&quot;. The New Mexico House of Representatives passed a resolution in honor of Clyde Tombaugh, the discoverer of Pluto and a longtime resident of that state, that declared that Pluto will always be considered a planet while in New Mexican skies and that March 13, 2007, was Pluto Planet Day. The Illinois Senate passed a similar resolution in 2009 on the basis that Tombaugh was born in Illinois. The resolution asserted that Pluto was &quot;unfairly downgraded to a &#x27;dwarf&#x27; planet&quot; by the IAU.&quot; Some members of the public have also rejected the change, citing the disagreement within the scientific community on the issue, or for sentimental reasons, maintaining that they have always known Pluto as a planet and will continue to do so regardless of the IAU decision. In 2006, in its 17th annual words-of-the-year vote, the American Dialect Society voted &quot;plutoed&quot; as the word of the year. To &quot;pluto&quot; is to &quot;demote or devalue someone or something&quot;. In April 2024, Arizona (where Pluto was first discovered in 1930) passed a law naming Pluto as the official state planet.

Researchers on both sides of the debate gathered in August 2008, at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory for a conference that included back-to-back talks on the IAU definition of a planet. Entitled &quot;The Great Planet Debate&quot;, the conference published a post-conference press release indicating that scientists could not come to a consensus about the definition of planet. In June 2008, the IAU had announced in a press release that the term &quot;plutoid&quot; would henceforth be used to refer to Pluto and other planetary-mass objects that have an orbital semi-major axis greater than that of Neptune, though the term has not seen significant use.

== Orbit ==

Pluto&#x27;s orbital period is about 248 years. Its orbital characteristics are substantially different from those of the planets, which follow nearly circular orbits around the Sun close to a flat reference plane called the ecliptic. In contrast, Pluto&#x27;s orbit is moderately inclined relative to the ecliptic (over 17°) and moderately eccentric (elliptical). This eccentricity means a small region of Pluto&#x27;s orbit lies closer to the Sun than Neptune&#x27;s. The Pluto–Charon barycenter came to perihelion on September 5, 1989, and was last closer to the Sun than Neptune between February 7, 1979, and February 11, 1999.

Although the 3:2 resonance with Neptune (see below) is maintained, Pluto&#x27;s inclination and eccentricity behave in a chaotic manner. Computer simulations can be used to predict its position for several million years (both forward and backward in time), but after intervals much longer than the Lyapunov time of 10–20 million years, calculations become unreliable: Pluto is sensitive to immeasurably small details of the Solar System, hard-to-predict factors that will gradually change Pluto&#x27;s position in its orbit.

The semi-major axis of Pluto&#x27;s orbit varies between about 39.3 and 39.6 AU with a period of about 19,951 years, corresponding to an orbital period varying between 246 and 249 years. The semi-major axis and period are presently getting longer.

=== Relationship with Neptune ===
Despite Pluto&#x27;s orbit appearing to cross that of Neptune when viewed from north or south of the Solar System, the two objects&#x27; orbits do not intersect. When Pluto is closest to the Sun, and close to Neptune&#x27;s orbit as viewed from such a position, it is also the farthest north of Neptune&#x27;s path. Pluto&#x27;s orbit passes about 8 AU north of that of Neptune, preventing a collision.

This alone is not enough to protect Pluto; perturbations from the planets (especially Neptune) could alter Pluto&#x27;s orbit (such as its orbital precession) over millions of years so that a collision could happen. However, Pluto is also protected by its 2:3 orbital resonance with Neptune: for every two orbits that Pluto makes around the Sun, Neptune makes three, in a frame of reference that rotates at the rate that Pluto&#x27;s perihelion precesses (about degrees per year). Each cycle lasts about 495 years. (There are many other objects in this same resonance, called plutinos.) At present, in each 495-year cycle, the first time Pluto is at perihelion (such as in 1989), Neptune is 57° ahead of Pluto. By Pluto&#x27;s second passage through perihelion, Neptune will have completed a further one and a half of its own orbits, and will be 123° behind Pluto. Pluto and Neptune&#x27;s minimum separation is over 17 AU, which is greater than Pluto&#x27;s minimum separation from Uranus (11 AU). The minimum separation between Pluto and Neptune actually occurs near the time of Pluto&#x27;s aphelion.
The 2:3 resonance between the two bodies is highly stable and has been preserved over millions of years. This prevents their orbits from changing relative to one another, so the two bodies can never pass near each other. Even if Pluto&#x27;s orbit were not inclined, the two bodies could never collide. When Pluto&#x27;s period is slightly different from 3/2 of Neptune&#x27;s, the pattern of its distance from Neptune will drift. Near perihelion Pluto moves interior to Neptune&#x27;s orbit and is therefore moving faster, so during the first of two orbits in the 495-year cycle, it is approaching Neptune from behind. At present it remains between 50° and 65° behind Neptune for 100 years (e.g. 1937–2036). The gravitational pull between the two causes angular momentum to be transferred to Pluto. This situation moves Pluto into a slightly larger orbit, where it has a slightly longer period, according to Kepler&#x27;s third law. After several such repetitions, Pluto is sufficiently delayed that at the second perihelion of each cycle it will not be far ahead of Neptune coming behind it, and Neptune will start to decrease Pluto&#x27;s period again. The whole cycle takes about 20,000 years to complete.

==== Other factors ====
Numerical studies have shown that over millions of years, the general nature of the alignment between the orbits of Pluto and Neptune does not change. There are several other resonances and interactions that enhance Pluto&#x27;s stability. These arise principally from two additional mechanisms (besides the 2:3 mean-motion resonance).

First, Pluto&#x27;s argument of perihelion, the angle between the point where it crosses the ecliptic (or the invariant plane) and the point where it is closest to the Sun, librates around 90°. This means that when Pluto is closest to the Sun, it is at its farthest north of the plane of the Solar System, preventing encounters with Neptune. This is a consequence of the Kozai mechanism, which relates the eccentricity of an orbit to its inclination to a larger perturbing body—in this case, Neptune. Relative to Neptune, the amplitude of libration is 38°, and so the angular separation of Pluto&#x27;s perihelion to the orbit of Neptune is always greater than 52° . The closest such angular separation occurs every 10,000 years.

Second, the longitudes of ascending nodes of the two bodies—the points where they cross the invariant plane—are in near-resonance with the above libration. When the two longitudes are the same—that is, when one could draw a straight line through both nodes and the Sun—Pluto&#x27;s perihelion lies exactly at 90°, and hence it comes closest to the Sun when it is furthest north of Neptune&#x27;s orbit. This is known as the &quot;1:1 superresonance&quot;. All the Jovian planets (Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune) play a role in the creation of the superresonance.

== Rotation ==

Pluto&#x27;s rotation period, its day, is equal to 6.387 Earth days. Like Uranus and 2 Pallas, Pluto rotates on its &quot;side&quot; in its orbital plane, with an axial tilt of 120°, and so its seasonal variation is extreme; at its solstices, one-fourth of its surface is in continuous daylight, whereas another fourth is in continuous darkness. The reason for this unusual orientation has been debated. Research from the University of Arizona has suggested that it may be due to the way that a body&#x27;s spin will always adjust to minimize energy. This could mean a body reorienting itself to put extraneous mass near the equator and regions lacking mass tend towards the poles. This is called &quot;polar wander&quot;. According to a paper released from the University of Arizona, this could be caused by masses of frozen nitrogen building up in shadowed areas of the dwarf planet. These masses would cause the body to reorient itself, leading to its unusual axial tilt of 120°. The buildup of nitrogen is due to Pluto&#x27;s vast distance from the Sun. At the equator, temperatures can drop to , causing nitrogen to freeze as water would freeze on Earth. The same polar wandering effect seen on Pluto would be observed on Earth were the Antarctic ice sheet several times larger.

== Geology ==
=== Surface ===

The plains on Pluto&#x27;s surface are composed of more than 98 percent nitrogen ice, with traces of methane and carbon monoxide. Nitrogen and carbon monoxide are most abundant on the anti-Charon face of Pluto (around 180° longitude, where Tombaugh Regio&#x27;s western lobe, Sputnik Planitia, is located), whereas methane is most abundant near 300° east. The mountains are made of water ice. Pluto&#x27;s surface is quite varied, with large differences in both brightness and color. Pluto is one of the most contrastive bodies in the Solar System, with as much contrast as Saturn&#x27;s moon Iapetus. The color varies from charcoal black, to dark orange and white. Pluto&#x27;s color is more similar to that of Io with slightly more orange and significantly less red than Mars. Notable geographical features include Tombaugh Regio, or the &quot;Heart&quot; (a large bright area on the side opposite Charon), Belton Regio, or the &quot;Whale&quot; (a large dark area on the trailing hemisphere), and the &quot;Brass Knuckles&quot; (a series of equatorial dark areas on the leading hemisphere).

Sputnik Planitia, the western lobe of the &quot;Heart&quot;, is a 1,000 km-wide basin of frozen nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices, divided into polygonal cells, which are interpreted as convection cells that carry floating blocks of water ice crust and sublimation pits towards their margins; there are obvious signs of glacial flows both into and out of the basin. It has no craters that were visible to &quot;New Horizons&quot;, indicating that its surface is less than 10 million years old. Latest studies have shown that the surface has an age of years.
The New Horizons science team summarized initial findings as &quot;Pluto displays a surprisingly wide variety of geological landforms, including those resulting from glaciological and surface–atmosphere interactions as well as impact, tectonic, possible cryovolcanic, and mass-wasting processes.&quot;

In Western parts of Sputnik Planitia there are fields of transverse dunes formed by the winds blowing from the center of Sputnik Planitia in the direction of surrounding mountains. The dune wavelengths are in the range of 0.4–1 km and likely consist of methane particles 200–300 μm in size.

=== Internal structure ===
Pluto&#x27;s density is . Because the decay of radioactive elements would eventually heat the ices enough for the rock to separate from them, scientists expect that Pluto&#x27;s internal structure is differentiated, with the rocky material having settled into a dense core surrounded by a mantle of water ice. The pre–&quot;New Horizons&quot; estimate for the diameter of the core is , 70% of Pluto&#x27;s diameter. 
It is possible that such heating continues, creating a subsurface ocean of liquid water thick at the core–mantle boundary. In September 2016, scientists at Brown University simulated the impact thought to have formed Sputnik Planitia, and showed that it might have been the result of liquid water upweling from below after the collision, implying the existence of a subsurface ocean at least 100 km deep. In June 2020, astronomers reported evidence that Pluto may have had a subsurface ocean, and consequently may have been habitable, when it was first formed. In March 2022, a team of researchers proposed that the mountains Wright Mons and Piccard Mons are actually a merger of many smaller cryovolcanic domes, suggesting a source of heat on the body at levels previously thought not possible.

== Mass and size ==
Pluto&#x27;s diameter is and its mass is , 17.7% that of the Moon (0.22% that of Earth). Its surface area is , or just slightly bigger than Russia or Antarctica (particularly including the Antarctic sea ice during winter). Its surface gravity is 0.063 &quot;g&quot; (compared to 1 &quot;g&quot; for Earth and 0.17 &quot;g&quot; for the Moon). This gives Pluto an escape velocity of 4,363.2 km per hour / 2,711.167 miles per hour (as compared to Earth&#x27;s 40,270 km per hour / 25,020 miles per hour). Pluto is more than twice the diameter and a dozen times the mass of Ceres, the largest object in the asteroid belt. It is less massive than the dwarf planet Eris, a trans-Neptunian object discovered in 2005, though Pluto has a larger diameter of 2,376.6 km compared to Eris&#x27;s approximate diameter of 2,326 km.

With less than 0.2 lunar masses, Pluto is much less massive than the terrestrial planets, and also less massive than seven moons: Ganymede, Titan, Callisto, Io, the Moon, Europa, and Triton. The mass is much less than thought before Charon was discovered.

The discovery of Pluto&#x27;s satellite Charon in 1978 enabled a determination of the mass of the Pluto–Charon system by application of Newton&#x27;s formulation of Kepler&#x27;s third law. Observations of Pluto in occultation with Charon allowed scientists to establish Pluto&#x27;s diameter more accurately, whereas the invention of adaptive optics allowed them to determine its shape more accurately.

Determinations of Pluto&#x27;s size have been complicated by its atmosphere and hydrocarbon haze. In March 2014, Lellouch, de Bergh et al. published findings regarding methane mixing ratios in Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere consistent with a Plutonian diameter greater than 2,360 km, with a &quot;best guess&quot; of 2,368 km. On July 13, 2015, images from NASA&#x27;s &quot;New Horizons&quot; mission Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI), along with data from the other instruments, determined Pluto&#x27;s diameter to be , which was later revised to be on July 24, and later to . Using radio occultation data from the &quot;New Horizons&quot; Radio Science Experiment (REX), the diameter was found to be .

== Atmosphere ==

Pluto has a tenuous atmosphere consisting of nitrogen (N2), methane (CH4), and carbon monoxide (CO), which are in equilibrium with their ices on Pluto&#x27;s surface. According to the measurements by &quot;New Horizons&quot;, the surface pressure is about 1 Pa (10 μbar), roughly one million to 100,000 times less than Earth&#x27;s atmospheric pressure. It was initially thought that, as Pluto moves away from the Sun, its atmosphere should gradually freeze onto the surface; studies of &quot;New Horizons&quot; data and ground-based occultations show that Pluto&#x27;s atmospheric density increases, and that it likely remains gaseous throughout Pluto&#x27;s orbit. &quot;New Horizons&quot; observations showed that atmospheric escape of nitrogen to be 10,000 times less than expected. Alan Stern has contended that even a small increase in Pluto&#x27;s surface temperature can lead to exponential increases in Pluto&#x27;s atmospheric density; from 18 hPa to as much as 280 hPa (three times that of Mars to a quarter that of the Earth). At such densities, nitrogen could flow across the surface as liquid. Just like sweat cools the body as it evaporates from the skin, the sublimation of Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere cools its surface. Pluto has no or almost no troposphere; observations by &quot;New Horizons&quot; suggest only a thin tropospheric boundary layer. Its thickness in the place of measurement was 4 km, and the temperature was 37±3 K. The layer is not continuous.

In July 2019, an occultation by Pluto showed that its atmospheric pressure, against expectations, had fallen by 20% since 2016. In 2021, astronomers at the Southwest Research Institute confirmed the result using data from an occultation in 2018, which showed that light was appearing less gradually from behind Pluto&#x27;s disc, indicating a thinning atmosphere.

The presence of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, in Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere creates a temperature inversion, with the average temperature of its atmosphere tens of degrees warmer than its surface, though observations by &quot;New Horizons&quot; have revealed Pluto&#x27;s upper atmosphere to be far colder than expected (70 K, as opposed to about 100 K). Pluto&#x27;s atmosphere is divided into roughly 20 regularly spaced haze layers up to 150 km high, thought to be the result of pressure waves created by airflow across Pluto&#x27;s mountains.

== Natural satellites ==

Pluto has five known natural satellites. The largest and closest to Pluto is Charon. First identified in 1978 by astronomer James Christy, Charon is the only moon of Pluto that may be in hydrostatic equilibrium. Charon&#x27;s mass is sufficient to cause the barycenter of the Pluto–Charon system to be outside Pluto. Beyond Charon there are four much smaller circumbinary moons. In order of distance from Pluto they are Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. Nix and Hydra were both discovered in 2005, Kerberos was discovered in 2011, and Styx was discovered in 2012. The satellites&#x27; orbits are circular (eccentricity &lt; 0.006) and coplanar with Pluto&#x27;s equator (inclination &lt; 1°), and therefore tilted approximately 120° relative to Pluto&#x27;s orbit. The Plutonian system is highly compact: the five known satellites orbit within the inner 3% of the region where prograde orbits would be stable.

The orbital periods of all Pluto&#x27;s moons are linked in a system of orbital resonances and near-resonances. When precession is accounted for, the orbital periods of Styx, Nix, and Hydra are in an exact 18:22:33 ratio. There is a sequence of approximate ratios, 3:4:5:6, between the periods of Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra with that of Charon; the ratios become closer to being exact the further out the moons are.

The Pluto–Charon system is one of the few in the Solar System whose barycenter lies outside the primary body; the Patroclus–Menoetius system is a smaller example, and the Sun–Jupiter system is the only larger one. The similarity in size of Charon and Pluto has prompted some astronomers to call it a double dwarf planet. The system is also unusual among planetary systems in that each is tidally locked to the other, which means that Pluto and Charon always have the same hemisphere facing each other — a property shared by only one other known system, Eris and Dysnomia. From any position on either body, the other is always at the same position in the sky, or always obscured. This also means that the rotation period of each is equal to the time it takes the entire system to rotate around its barycenter.

Pluto&#x27;s moons are hypothesized to have been formed by a collision between Pluto and a similar-sized body, early in the history of the Solar System. The collision released material that consolidated into the moons around Pluto.

=== Quasi-satellite ===
In 2012, it was calculated that 15810 Arawn could be a quasi-satellite of Pluto, a specific type of co-orbital configuration. According to the calculations, the object would be a quasi-satellite of Pluto for about 350,000 years out of every two-million-year period. Measurements made by the &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft in 2015 made it possible to calculate the orbit of Arawn more accurately, and confirmed the earlier ones. However, it is not agreed upon among astronomers whether Arawn should be classified as a quasi-satellite of Pluto based on its orbital dynamics, since its orbit is primarily controlled by Neptune with only occasional perturbations by Pluto.

== Origin ==

Pluto&#x27;s origin and identity had long puzzled astronomers. One early hypothesis was that Pluto was an escaped moon of Neptune knocked out of orbit by Neptune&#x27;s largest moon, Triton. This idea was eventually rejected after dynamical studies showed it to be impossible because Pluto never approaches Neptune in its orbit.

Pluto&#x27;s true place in the Solar System began to reveal itself only in 1992, when astronomers began to find small icy objects beyond Neptune that were similar to Pluto not only in orbit but also in size and composition. This trans-Neptunian population is thought to be the source of many short-period comets. Pluto is the largest member of the Kuiper belt, a stable belt of objects located between 30 and 50 AU from the Sun. As of 2011, surveys of the Kuiper belt to magnitude 21 were nearly complete and any remaining Pluto-sized objects are expected to be beyond 100 AU from the Sun. Like other Kuiper-belt objects (KBOs), Pluto shares features with comets; for example, the solar wind is gradually blowing Pluto&#x27;s surface into space. It has been claimed that if Pluto were placed as near to the Sun as Earth, it would develop a tail, as comets do. This claim has been disputed with the argument that Pluto&#x27;s escape velocity is too high for this to happen. It has been proposed that Pluto may have formed as a result of the agglomeration of numerous comets and Kuiper-belt objects.

Though Pluto is the largest Kuiper belt object discovered, Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton, which is larger than Pluto, is similar to it both geologically and atmospherically, and is thought to be a captured Kuiper belt object. Eris (see above) is about the same size as Pluto (though more massive) but is not strictly considered a member of the Kuiper belt population. Rather, it is considered a member of a linked population called the scattered disc.

Like other members of the Kuiper belt, Pluto is thought to be a residual planetesimal; a component of the original protoplanetary disc around the Sun that failed to fully coalesce into a full-fledged planet. Most astronomers agree that Pluto owes its position to a sudden migration undergone by Neptune early in the Solar System&#x27;s formation. As Neptune migrated outward, it approached the objects in the proto-Kuiper belt, setting one in orbit around itself (Triton), locking others into resonances, and knocking others into chaotic orbits. The objects in the scattered disc, a dynamically unstable region overlapping the Kuiper belt, are thought to have been placed in their positions by interactions with Neptune&#x27;s migrating resonances. A computer model created in 2004 by Alessandro Morbidelli of the Observatoire de la Côte d&#x27;Azur in Nice suggested that the migration of Neptune into the Kuiper belt may have been triggered by the formation of a 1:2 resonance between Jupiter and Saturn, which created a gravitational push that propelled both Uranus and Neptune into higher orbits and caused them to switch places, ultimately doubling Neptune&#x27;s distance from the Sun. The resultant expulsion of objects from the proto-Kuiper belt could also explain the Late Heavy Bombardment 600 million years after the Solar System&#x27;s formation and the origin of the Jupiter trojans. It is possible that Pluto had a near-circular orbit about 33 AU from the Sun before Neptune&#x27;s migration perturbed it into a resonant capture. The Nice model requires that there were about a thousand Pluto-sized bodies in the original planetesimal disk, which included Triton and Eris.

== Observation and exploration ==
=== Observation ===

Pluto&#x27;s distance from Earth makes its in-depth study and exploration difficult. Pluto&#x27;s visual apparent magnitude averages 15.1, brightening to 13.65 at perihelion. To see it, a telescope is required; around 30 cm (12 in) aperture being desirable. It looks star-like and without a visible disk even in large telescopes, because its angular diameter is maximum 0.11&quot;.

The earliest maps of Pluto, made in the late 1980s, were brightness maps created from close observations of eclipses by its largest moon, Charon. Observations were made of the change in the total average brightness of the Pluto–Charon system during the eclipses. For example, eclipsing a bright spot on Pluto makes a bigger total brightness change than eclipsing a dark spot. Computer processing of many such observations can be used to create a brightness map. This method can also track changes in brightness over time.

Better maps were produced from images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), which offered higher resolution, and showed considerably more detail, resolving variations several hundred kilometers across, including polar regions and large bright spots. These maps were produced by complex computer processing, which finds the best-fit projected maps for the few pixels of the Hubble images. These remained the most detailed maps of Pluto until the flyby of &quot;New Horizons&quot; in July 2015, because the two cameras on the HST used for these maps were no longer in service.

=== Exploration ===

The &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft, which flew by Pluto in July 2015, is the first and so far only attempt to explore Pluto directly. Launched in 2006, it captured its first (distant) images of Pluto in late September 2006 during a test of the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager. The images, taken from a distance of approximately 4.2 billion kilometers, confirmed the spacecraft&#x27;s ability to track distant targets, critical for maneuvering toward Pluto and other Kuiper belt objects. In early 2007 the craft made use of a gravity assist from Jupiter.

&quot;New Horizons&quot; made its closest approach to Pluto on July 14, 2015, after a 3,462-day journey across the Solar System. Scientific observations of Pluto began five months before the closest approach and continued for at least a month after the encounter. Observations were conducted using a remote sensing package that included imaging instruments and a radio science investigation tool, as well as spectroscopic and other experiments. The scientific goals of &quot;New Horizons&quot; were to characterize the global geology and morphology of Pluto and its moon Charon, map their surface composition, and analyze Pluto&#x27;s neutral atmosphere and its escape rate. On October 25, 2016, at 05:48 pm ET, the last bit of data (of a total of 50 billion bits of data; or 6.25 gigabytes) was received from &quot;New Horizons&quot; from its close encounter with Pluto.

Since the &quot;New Horizons&quot; flyby, scientists have advocated for an orbiter mission that would return to Pluto to fulfill new science objectives. They include mapping the surface at per pixel, observations of Pluto&#x27;s smaller satellites, observations of how Pluto changes as it rotates on its axis, investigations of a possible subsurface ocean, and topographic mapping of Pluto&#x27;s regions that are covered in long-term darkness due to its axial tilt. The last objective could be accomplished using laser pulses to generate a complete topographic map of Pluto. &quot;New Horizons&quot; principal investigator Alan Stern has advocated for a &quot;Cassini&quot;-style orbiter that would launch around 2030 (the 100th anniversary of Pluto&#x27;s discovery) and use Charon&#x27;s gravity to adjust its orbit as needed to fulfill science objectives after arriving at the Pluto system. The orbiter could then use Charon&#x27;s gravity to leave the Pluto system and study more KBOs after all Pluto science objectives are completed. A conceptual study funded by the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program describes a fusion-enabled Pluto orbiter and lander based on the Princeton field-reversed configuration reactor.

&quot;New Horizons&quot; imaged all of Pluto&#x27;s northern hemisphere, and the equatorial regions down to about 30° South. Higher southern latitudes have only been observed, at very low resolution, from Earth. Images from the Hubble Space Telescope in 1996 cover 85% of Pluto and show large albedo features down to about 75° South. This is enough to show the extent of the temperate-zone maculae. Later images had slightly better resolution, due to minor improvements in Hubble instrumentation. The equatorial region of the sub-Charon hemisphere of Pluto has only been imaged at low resolution, as &quot;New Horizons&quot; made its closest approach to the anti-Charon hemisphere.

Some albedo variations in the higher southern latitudes could be detected by &quot;New Horizons&quot; using Charon-shine (light reflected off Charon). The south polar region seems to be darker than the north polar region, but there is a high-albedo region in the southern hemisphere that may be a regional nitrogen or methane ice deposit.

<text>The World According to Garp is John Irving&#x27;s fourth novel, about a man who is born out of wedlock to a feminist leader, then grows up to be a writer. Published in 1978, the book was a bestseller for several years. It was a finalist for the National Book Award for Fiction in 1979, and its first paperback edition won the award the following year.

A movie adaptation of the novel starring Robin Williams was released in 1982, with a screenplay written by Steve Tesich.

BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Classic Serial&quot; broadcast a three-part adaptation of the novel by Linda Marshall Griffiths in January 2014. The production was directed by Nadia Molinari and featured Miranda Richardson as Jenny, Lee Ingleby as Garp, Jonathan Keeble as Roberta and Lyndsey Marshal as Helen.

On 3 November 2015, Irving revealed that he&#x27;d been approached by HBO and Warner Brothers to reconstruct &quot;The World According to Garp&quot; as a miniseries. He described the project as being in the early stages.
According to the byline of a self-penned, 20 February 2017 essay for &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Irving completed his teleplay for the five-part series based on &quot;The World According to Garp&quot;.

==Synopsis==
The novel is about the life of T. S. Garp. His mother, Jenny Fields, is a strong-willed nurse who wants a child but not a husband. She encounters a dying ball turret gunner known only as Technical Sergeant Garp, who was severely brain damaged in combat. Jenny nurses Garp, observing his infantile state and almost perpetual erection. Unconstrained by convention and driven by her desire for a child, Jenny impregnates herself by raping the brain-damaged Garp once, and names the resulting son &quot;T. S.&quot; (a name derived from &quot;Technical Sergeant&quot;, but consisting of just initials). Jenny raises young Garp alone, taking a position as the live-in nurse at the all-boys Steering School in New England.

Garp grows up, becoming interested in sex, wrestling, and writing fiction—three topics in which his mother has little interest. After his graduation in 1961, his mother takes him to Vienna, where he writes his first novella. At the same time, his mother begins writing her autobiography, &quot;A Sexual Suspect&quot;. After Jenny and Garp return to Steering, Garp marries Helen, the wrestling coach&#x27;s daughter, and begins his family—he a struggling writer, she a teacher of English. The publication of &quot;A Sexual Suspect&quot; makes his mother famous. She becomes a feminist icon, because feminists view her book as a manifesto of a woman who does not care to bind herself to a man, and who chooses to raise a child on her own. She nurtures and supports women traumatized by men, among them the Ellen Jamesians, a group of women named after an eleven-year-old girl whose tongue was cut out by her rapists to silence her. The members of the group cut out their own tongues in solidarity with Ellen, even though she opposes the practice.

Garp becomes a devoted parent, wrestling with anxiety for the safety of his children. He and his family inevitably experience dark and violent events through which the characters change and grow. Garp learns (often painfully) from the women in his life (including transgender ex-football player Roberta Muldoon), who are struggling to become more tolerant in the face of intolerance. The story contains a great deal of (in the words of Garp&#x27;s fictional teacher) &quot;lunacy and sorrow&quot;.

The novel contains several narratives: Garp&#x27;s first piece of fiction, a short story entitled &quot;The Pension Grillparzer&quot;; &quot;Vigilance&quot;, an essay; and the first chapter of his third novel, &quot;The World According to Bensenhaver&quot;. The book also contains some motifs that appear in other Irving novels: bears, New England, Vienna, hotels, wrestling, a person who prefers abstinence over sex, and adultery.

== Background ==
John Irving&#x27;s mother, Frances Winslow, had not been married at the time of his conception, and Irving never met his biological father. As a child, he was not told anything about his father, and he told his mother that unless she gave him some information about his biological father, in his writing he would invent the father and the circumstances of how she got pregnant. Winslow would reply &quot;Go ahead, dear.&quot;

In 1981, &quot;Time&quot; magazine quoted the novelist&#x27;s mother as saying &quot;There are parts of &quot;Garp&quot; that are too explicit for me.&quot;

<text>Ctesiphon ( ; , &quot;Tyspwn&quot; or &quot;Tysfwn&quot;; ; , ; ) was an ancient city in modern Iraq, on the eastern bank of the Tigris, about southeast of Baghdad. Ctesiphon served as a royal capital of the Iranian empires for over eight hundred years, in the Parthian and Sasanian periods. Ctesiphon was the capital of the Sasanian Empire from 226–637 until the Muslim conquest of Persia in 651 AD.

Ctesiphon developed into a rich commercial metropolis, merging with the surrounding cities along both shores of the river, including the Hellenistic city of Seleucia. Ctesiphon and its environs were therefore sometimes referred to as &quot;The Cities&quot; (, ). In the late sixth and early seventh century, it was listed as the largest city in the world by some accounts.

During the Roman–Parthian Wars, Ctesiphon fell three times to the Romans, and later fell once during Sasanian rule. It was also the site of the Battle of Ctesiphon in 363 AD. After the Muslim invasion, the city fell into decay and was depopulated by the end of the eighth century, its place as a political and economic center taken by the Abbasid capital at Baghdad. The most conspicuous structure remaining today is the Taq Kasra, sometimes called the Archway of Ctesiphon.

== Names ==
The Latin name derives from Ancient Greek &quot;Ktēsiphôn&quot; (). This is ostensibly a Greek toponym based on a personal name, although it may be a Hellenized form of a local name, reconstructed as &quot;Tisfōn&quot; or &quot;Tisbōn&quot;. In Iranian-language texts of the Sasanian era, it is spelled as &quot;Tyspwn&quot;, which can be read as &quot;Tīsfōn&quot;, &quot;Tēsifōn&quot;, etc. in Manichaean Parthian, in Middle Persian and in Christian Sogdian (in Syriac alphabet) languages. The New Persian form is &quot;Tisfun&quot; ().

Texts from the Church of the East&#x27;s synods referred to the city as &quot;Qṭēspōn&quot; () or some times &quot;Māḥôzē&quot; () when referring to the metropolis of Seleucia-Ctesiphon.

In modern Arabic, the name is usually &quot;Ṭaysafūn&quot; () or &quot;Qaṭaysfūn&quot; () or as &quot;al-Mada&#x27;in&quot; ( &quot;The Cities&quot;, referring to Greater Ctesiphon). &quot;According to Yāqūt [...], quoting Ḥamza, the original form was Ṭūsfūn or Tūsfūn, which was arabicized as Ṭaysafūn.&quot; The Armenian name of the city was &quot;Tizbon&quot; (). Ctesiphon is first mentioned in the Book of Ezra of the Old Testament as Kasfia/Casphia (a derivative of the ethnic name Cas, and a cognate of Caspian and Qazvin). It is also mentioned in the Talmud as Aktisfon. In another Talmudic reference it is written as Akistfon, located across the Tigris River from the city of Ardashir.

== Location ==

Ctesiphon is located approximately at Al-Mada&#x27;in, southeast of the modern city of Baghdad, Iraq, along the river Tigris. Ctesiphon measured 30 square kilometers, more than twice the surface of a 13.7-square-kilometer fourth-century imperial Rome.

The archway of Chosroes (&quot;Taq Kasra&quot;) was once a part of the royal palace in Ctesiphon and is estimated to date between the 3rd and 6th centuries AD. It is located in what is now the Iraqi town of Salman Pak.

== History ==

===Parthian period===
Ctesiphon was founded in the late 120s BC. It was built on the site of a military camp established across from Seleucia by Mithridates I of Parthia. The reign of Gotarzes I saw Ctesiphon reach a peak as a political and commercial center. The city became the Empire&#x27;s capital circa 58 BC during the reign of Orodes II. Gradually, the city merged with the old Hellenistic capital of Seleucia and other nearby settlements to form a cosmopolitan metropolis.

The reason for this westward relocation of the capital could have been in part due to the proximity of the previous capitals (Mithradatkirt, and Hecatompylos at Hyrcania) to the Scythian incursions.

Strabo abundantly describes the foundation of Ctesiphon:

Because of its importance, Ctesiphon was a major military objective for the leaders of the Roman Empire in their eastern wars. The city was captured by Rome four or five times in its history – three times in the 2nd century alone. The emperor Trajan captured Ctesiphon in 116, but his successor, Hadrian, decided to willingly return Ctesiphon in 117 as part of a peace settlement. The Roman general Avidius Cassius captured Ctesiphon in 164 during another Parthian war, but abandoned it when peace was concluded. In 197, the emperor Septimius Severus sacked Ctesiphon and carried off thousands of its inhabitants, whom he sold into slavery.

===Sasanian period===
By 226, Ctesiphon was in the hands of the Sasanian Empire, who also made it their capital and had laid an end to the Parthian dynasty of Iran. Ctesiphon was greatly enlarged and flourished during their rule, thus turning into a metropolis, which was known by in Arabic as al-Mada&#x27;in, and in Aramaic as Mahoze. The oldest inhabited places of Ctesiphon were on its eastern side, which in Islamic Arabic sources is called &quot;the Old City&quot; ( &quot;Madīnah al-&#x27;Atīqah&quot;), where the residence of the Sasanians, known as the White Palace (), was located. The southern side of Ctesiphon was known as Asbānbar or Aspānbar, which was known by its prominent halls, riches, games, stables, and baths. Taq Kasra was located in the latter.

The western side was known as Veh-Ardashir (meaning &quot;the good city of Ardashir&quot; in Middle Persian), known as Mahoza by the Jews, Kokhe by the Christians, and Behrasir by the Arabs. Veh-Ardashir was populated by many wealthy Jews, and was the seat of the church of the Nestorian patriarch. To the south of Veh-Ardashir was Valashabad. Ctesiphon had several other districts which were named Hanbu Shapur, Darzanidan, Veh Jondiu-Khosrow, Nawinabad and Kardakadh.

Severus Alexander advanced towards Ctesiphon in 233, but as corroborated by Herodian, his armies suffered a humiliating defeat against Ardashir I. In 283, emperor Carus sacked the city uncontested during a period of civil upheaval. Some historians have claimed that Galerius marched on Ctesiphon and was able to capture it. However, this is never explicitly stated in any source and is still a matter of debate among scholars.

Hence that he returned it to the Persian king Narses in exchange for Armenia and western Mesopotamia is also likely to have never happened. In and again in 410, the city, or the Greek colony directly across the river, was the site of church councils for the Church of the East.
After the conquest of Antioch in 541, Khosrow I built a new city near Ctesiphon for the inhabitants he captured. He called this new city Veh-Antiok-Xusrō, or literally, &quot;better than Antioch Khosrow built this&quot;. Local inhabitants of the area called the new city &quot;Rumagan&quot;, meaning &quot;town of the Romans&quot; and Arabs called the city &quot;al-Rumiyya&quot;. Along with Weh Antiok, Khosrow built a number of fortified cities. After a campaign in 573, John of Ephesus wrote that no fewer than 292,000 persons had been deported from Dara, Apamia, and other Syrian towns to Veh-Antiokh. John would later cite a letter stating no more than 30,000 prisoners were deported. It&#x27;s thought that the first number he gave is not to be taken literally.

In 590, a member of the House of Mihran, Bahram Chobin repelled the newly ascended Sasanian ruler Khosrow II from Iraq, and conquered the region. One year later, Khosrow II, with aid from the Byzantine Empire, reconquered his domains. During his reign, some of the great fame of al-Mada&#x27;in decreased, due to the popularity of Khosrow&#x27;s new winter residence, Dastagerd. In 627, the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius surrounded the city, the capital of the Sassanid Empire, leaving it after the Persians accepted his peace terms. In 628, a deadly plague hit Ctesiphon, al-Mada&#x27;in and the rest of the western part of the Sasanian Empire, which even killed Khosrow&#x27;s son and successor, Kavad II.

In 629, Ctesiphon was briefly under the control of Mihranid usurper Shahrbaraz, but the latter was shortly assassinated by the supporters of Khosrow II&#x27;s daughter Borandukht. Ctesiphon then continued to be involved in constant fighting between two factions of the Sasanian Empire, the Pahlav (Parthian) faction under the House of Ispahbudhan and the Parsig (Persian) faction under Piruz Khosrow.

===Downfall of the Sasanians and the Islamic conquests===
In the mid-630s, the Muslim Arabs, who had invaded the territories of the Sasanian Empire, defeated them during a great battle known as the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah. The Arabs then attacked Ctesiphon, and occupied it in early 637.

The Muslim military officer Sa`d ibn Abi Waqqas quickly seized Valashabad and made a peace treaty with the inhabitants of Veh-Antiok-Xusrō and Veh-Ardashir. The terms of the treaty were that the inhabitants of Veh-Antiok-Xusrō were allowed to leave if they wanted to, but if they did not, they were forced to acknowledge Muslim authority, and also pay tribute (&quot;jizya&quot;). Later on, when the Muslims arrived at Ctesiphon, it was completely desolated, due to flight of the Sasanian royal family, nobles, and troops. However, the Muslims had managed to take some of troops captive, and many riches were seized from the Sasanian treasury and were given to the Muslim troops. Furthermore, the throne hall in Taq Kasra was briefly used as a mosque.

Still, as political and economic fortune had passed elsewhere, the city went into a rapid decline, especially after the founding of the Abbasid capital at Baghdad in the 760s, and soon became a ghost town. Caliph Al-Mansur took much of the required material for the construction of Baghdad from the ruins of Ctesiphon. He also attempted to demolish the palace and reuse its bricks for his own palace, but he desisted only when the undertaking proved too vast. Al-Mansur also used the al-Rumiya town as the Abbasid capital city for a few months.

It is believed to be the basis for the city of Isbanir in &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

===Modern era===
The ruins of Ctesiphon were the site of a major battle of World War I in November 1915. The Ottoman Empire defeated troops of Britain attempting to capture Baghdad, and drove them back some before trapping the British force and compelling it to surrender.

== Population and religion ==
Under Sasanian rule, the population of Ctesiphon was heavily mixed: it included Arameans, Persians, Greeks and Assyrians. Several religions were also practiced in the metropolis, which included Christianity, Judaism and Zoroastrianism. In 497, the first Nestorian patriarch Mar Babai I, fixed his see at Seleucia-Ctesiphon, supervising their mission east, with the Merv metropolis as pivot. The population also included Manicheans, a dualist church, who continued to be mentioned in Ctesiphon during Umayyad rule fixing their &quot;patriarchate of Babylon&quot; there. Much of the population fled from Ctesiphon after the Arab capture of the metropolis. However, a portion of Persians remained there, and some important figures of these people are known to have provided Ali with presents, which he, however, refused to take. In the ninth century, the surviving Manicheans fled and displaced their patriarchate up the Silk Road, in Samarkand.

== Archaeology ==
A German Oriental Society expedition led by Oscar Reuther excavated at Ctesiphon in 1928–29 mainly at Qasr bint al-Qadi on the western part of the site. In winter of 1931–1932 a joint expedition of the German State Museums (Staatliche Museen zu Berlin) and The Metropolitan Museum of Art continued excavations at the site, focusing on the areas of Ma&#x27;aridh, Tell Dheheb, the Taq-i Kisra, Selman Pak and Umm ez-Za&#x27;tir under the direction of Ernst Kühnel.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, an Italian team from the University of Turin directed by Antonio Invernizzi and worked at the part of the site on the other side of the Tigris, which they identified as Veh Ardashir. Work mainly concentrated on restoration at the palace of Khosrow II. In 2013, the Iraqi government contracted to restore the Taq Kasra, as a tourist attraction.

<doc id="44474" wikidata="Q193" url="?curid=44474" title="Saturn">
<text>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas giant, with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth. It has an eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive. Even though Saturn is almost as big as Jupiter, Saturn has less than a third its mass. Saturn orbits the Sun at a distance of , with an orbital period of 29.45 years.

Saturn&#x27;s interior is thought to be composed of a rocky core, surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and an outer layer of gas. Saturn has a pale yellow hue, due to ammonia crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current in the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn&#x27;s planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than Earth&#x27;s, but has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth because of Saturn&#x27;s greater size. Saturn&#x27;s magnetic field strength is about a twentieth that of Jupiter. The outer atmosphere is generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach .

The planet has a bright and extensive system of rings, composed mainly of ice particles, with a smaller amount of rocky debris and dust. At least 146 moons orbit the planet, of which 63 are officially named; these do not include the hundreds of moonlets in the rings. Titan, Saturn&#x27;s largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is larger (but less massive) than the planet Mercury and is the only moon in the Solar System that has a substantial atmosphere.

==Name and symbol==
Saturn is named after the Roman god of wealth and agriculture, who was the father of the god Jupiter. Its astronomical symbol has been traced back to the Greek Oxyrhynchus Papyri, where it can be seen to be a Greek kappa-rho ligature with a horizontal stroke, as an abbreviation for &quot;Κρονος&quot; (Cronus), the Greek name for the planet (). It later came to look like a lower-case Greek eta, with the cross added at the top in the 16th century to Christianize this pagan symbol.

The Romans named the seventh day of the week Saturday, &quot;Sāturni diēs&quot;, &quot;Saturn&#x27;s Day&quot;, for the planet Saturn.

== Physical characteristics ==

Saturn is a gas giant, composed predominantly of hydrogen and helium. It lacks a definite surface, though it is likely to have a solid core. The planet&#x27;s rotation makes it an oblate spheroid—a ball flattened at the poles and bulging at the equator. Its equatorial radius is more than 10% larger than the polar radius: 60,268 km versus 54,364 km (37,449 mi versus 33,780 mi). Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune, the other giant planets in the Solar System, are less oblate. The combination of the bulge and the rotation rate means that the effective surface gravity along the equator, , is 74% of what it is at the poles and is lower than the surface gravity of Earth. However, the equatorial escape velocity, nearly , is much higher than that of Earth.

Saturn is the only planet of the Solar System that is less dense than water—about 30% less. Although Saturn&#x27;s core is considerably denser than water, the average specific density of the planet is , because of the atmosphere. Jupiter has 318 times Earth&#x27;s mass, and Saturn is 95 times Earth&#x27;s mass. Together, Jupiter and Saturn hold 92% of the total planetary mass in the Solar System.

=== Internal structure ===
Despite consisting mostly of hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn&#x27;s mass is not in the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above , which is reached at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn&#x27;s mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.

Standard planetary models suggest that the interior of Saturn is similar to that of Jupiter, having a small rocky core surrounded by hydrogen and helium, with trace amounts of various volatiles. Analysis of the distortion shows that Saturn is substantially more centrally condensed than Jupiter and therefore contains much more material denser than hydrogen near its center. Saturn&#x27;s central regions are about 50% hydrogen by mass, and Jupiter&#x27;s are about 67% hydrogen.

This core is similar in composition to Earth, but is more dense. The examination of Saturn&#x27;s gravitational moment, in combination with physical models of the interior, has allowed constraints to be placed on the mass of Saturn&#x27;s core. In 2004, scientists estimated that the core must be 9–22 times the mass of Earth, which corresponds to a diameter of about . However, measurements of Saturn&#x27;s rings suggest a much more diffuse core, with a mass equal to about 17 Earths and a radius equal to about 60% of Saturn&#x27;s entire radius. This is surrounded by a thicker, liquid metallic hydrogen layer, followed by a liquid layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen, which gradually transitions to a gas as altitude increases. The outermost layer spans about and consists of gas.

Saturn has a hot interior, reaching at its core, and radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter&#x27;s thermal energy is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression; but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive. An alternative or additional mechanism may be the generation of heat through the &quot;raining out&quot; of droplets of helium deep in Saturn&#x27;s interior. As the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn&#x27;s outer layers depleted of helium. These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core. Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.

=== Atmosphere ===
The outer atmosphere of Saturn contains 96.3% molecular hydrogen and 3.25% helium by volume. The proportion of helium is significantly deficient compared to the abundance of this element in the Sun. The quantity of elements heavier than helium (metallicity) is not known precisely, but the proportions are assumed to match the primordial abundances from the formation of the Solar System. The total mass of these heavier elements is estimated to be 19–31 times the mass of Earth, with a significant fraction located in Saturn&#x27;s core region.

Trace amounts of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and methane have been detected in Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere. The upper clouds are composed of ammonia crystals, while the lower level clouds appear to consist of either ammonium hydrosulfide () or water. Ultraviolet radiation from the Sun causes methane photolysis in the upper atmosphere, leading to a series of hydrocarbon chemical reactions with the resulting products being carried downward by eddies and diffusion. This photochemical cycle is modulated by Saturn&#x27;s annual seasonal cycle. &quot;Cassini&quot; observed a series of cloud features found in northern latitudes, nicknamed the &quot;String of Pearls&quot;. These features are cloud clearings that reside in deeper cloud layers.

==== Cloud layers ====
Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere exhibits a banded pattern similar to Jupiter&#x27;s, but Saturn&#x27;s bands are much fainter and are much wider near the equator. The nomenclature used to describe these bands is the same as on Jupiter. Saturn&#x27;s finer cloud patterns were not observed until the flybys of the &quot;Voyager&quot; spacecraft during the 1980s. Since then, Earth-based telescopy has improved to the point where regular observations can be made.

The composition of the clouds varies with depth and increasing pressure. In the upper cloud layers, with temperatures in the range of 100–160 K and pressures extending between 0.5–2 bar, the clouds consist of ammonia ice. Water ice clouds begin at a level where the pressure is about 2.5 bar and extend down to 9.5 bar, where temperatures range from 185 to 270 K. Intermixed in this layer is a band of ammonium hydrosulfide ice, lying in the pressure range 3–6 bar with temperatures of 190–235 K. Finally, the lower layers, where pressures are between 10 and 20 bar and temperatures are 270–330 K, contains a region of water droplets with ammonia in aqueous solution.

Saturn&#x27;s usually bland atmosphere occasionally exhibits long-lived ovals and other features common on Jupiter. In 1990, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged an enormous white cloud near Saturn&#x27;s equator that was not present during the &quot;Voyager&quot; encounters, and in 1994 another smaller storm was observed. The 1990 storm was an example of a Great White Spot, a short-lived phenomenon that occurs once every Saturnian year, roughly every 30 Earth years, around the time of the northern hemisphere&#x27;s summer solstice. Previous Great White Spots were observed in 1876, 1903, 1933, and 1960, with the 1933 storm being the best observed. The latest giant storm was observed in 2010. In 2015, researchers used Very Large Array telescope to study Saturnian atmosphere, and reported that they found &quot;long-lasting signatures of all mid-latitude giant storms, a mixture of equatorial storms up to hundreds of years old, and potentially an unreported older storm at 70°N&quot;.

The winds on Saturn are the second fastest among the Solar System&#x27;s planets, after Neptune&#x27;s. &quot;Voyager&quot; data indicate peak easterly winds of . In images from the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft during 2007, Saturn&#x27;s northern hemisphere displayed a bright blue hue, similar to Uranus. The color was most likely caused by Rayleigh scattering. Thermography has shown that Saturn&#x27;s south pole has a warm polar vortex, the only known example of such a phenomenon in the Solar System. Whereas temperatures on Saturn are normally −185 °C, temperatures on the vortex often reach as high as −122 °C, suspected to be the warmest spot on Saturn.

==== Hexagonal cloud patterns ====

A persisting hexagonal wave pattern around the north polar vortex in the atmosphere at about 78°N was first noted in the &quot;Voyager&quot; images. The sides of the hexagon are each about long, which is longer than the diameter of the Earth. The entire structure rotates with a period of (the same period as that of the planet&#x27;s radio emissions) which is assumed to be equal to the period of rotation of Saturn&#x27;s interior. The hexagonal feature does not shift in longitude like the other clouds in the visible atmosphere. The pattern&#x27;s origin is a matter of much speculation. Most scientists think it is a standing wave pattern in the atmosphere. Polygonal shapes have been replicated in the laboratory through differential rotation of fluids.

HST imaging of the south polar region indicates the presence of a jet stream, but no strong polar vortex nor any hexagonal standing wave. NASA reported in November 2006 that &quot;Cassini&quot; had observed a &quot;hurricane-like&quot; storm locked to the south pole that had a clearly defined eyewall. Eyewall clouds had not previously been seen on any planet other than Earth. For example, images from the &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft did not show an eyewall in the Great Red Spot of Jupiter.

The south pole storm may have been present for billions of years. This vortex is comparable to the size of Earth, and it has winds of 550 km/h.

=== Magnetosphere ===
Saturn has an intrinsic magnetic field that has a simple, symmetric shape—a magnetic dipole. Its strength at the equator—0.2 gauss (20 μT)—is approximately one twentieth of that of the field around Jupiter and slightly weaker than Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. As a result, Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere is much smaller than Jupiter&#x27;s.

When &quot;Voyager 2&quot; entered the magnetosphere, the solar wind pressure was high and the magnetosphere extended only 19 Saturn radii, or 1.1 million km (684,000 mi), although it enlarged within several hours, and remained so for about three days. Most probably, the magnetic field is generated similarly to that of Jupiter—by currents in the liquid metallic-hydrogen layer called a metallic-hydrogen dynamo. This magnetosphere is efficient at deflecting the solar wind particles from the Sun. The moon Titan orbits within the outer part of Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere and contributes plasma from the ionized particles in Titan&#x27;s outer atmosphere. Saturn&#x27;s magnetosphere, like Earth&#x27;s, produces aurorae.

== Orbit and rotation ==

The average distance between Saturn and the Sun is over 1.4 billion kilometers (9 AU). With an average orbital speed of 9.68 km/s, it takes Saturn 10,759 Earth days (or about  years) to finish one revolution around the Sun. As a consequence, it forms a near 5:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. The elliptical orbit of Saturn is inclined 2.48° relative to the orbital plane of the Earth. The perihelion and aphelion distances are, respectively, 9.195 and 9.957 AU, on average. The visible features on Saturn rotate at different rates depending on latitude, and multiple rotation periods have been assigned to various regions (as in Jupiter&#x27;s case).

Astronomers use three different systems for specifying the rotation rate of Saturn. &quot;System I&quot; has a period of (844.3°/d) and encompasses the Equatorial Zone, the South Equatorial Belt, and the North Equatorial Belt. The polar regions are considered to have rotation rates similar to &quot;System I&quot;. All other Saturnian latitudes, excluding the north and south polar regions, are indicated as &quot;System II&quot; and have been assigned a rotation period of (810.76°/d). &quot;System III&quot; refers to Saturn&#x27;s internal rotation rate. Based on radio emissions from the planet detected by &quot;Voyager 1&quot; and &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, System III has a rotation period of (810.8°/d). System III has largely superseded System II.

A precise value for the rotation period of the interior remains elusive. While approaching Saturn in 2004, &quot;Cassini&quot; found that the radio rotation period of Saturn had increased appreciably, to approximately . An estimate of Saturn&#x27;s rotation (as an indicated rotation rate for Saturn as a whole) based on a compilation of various measurements from the &quot;Cassini&quot;, &quot;Voyager&quot;, and &quot;Pioneer&quot; probes is . Studies of the planet&#x27;s C Ring yield a rotation period of  .

In March 2007, it was found that the variation in radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn&#x27;s rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn&#x27;s orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn&#x27;s magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to the rotation of the planet.

An apparent oddity for Saturn is that it does not have any known trojan asteroids. These are minor planets that orbit the Sun at the stable Lagrangian points, designated L4 and L5, located at 60° angles to the planet along its orbit. Trojan asteroids have been discovered for Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. Orbital resonance mechanisms, including secular resonance, are believed to be the cause of the missing Saturnian trojans.

== Natural satellites ==

Saturn has 146 known moons, 63 of which have formal names. It is estimated that there are another outer irregular moons larger than in diameter. In addition, there is evidence of dozens to hundreds of moonlets with diameters of 40–500 meters in Saturn&#x27;s rings, which are not considered to be true moons. Titan, the largest moon, comprises more than 90% of the mass in orbit around Saturn, including the rings. Saturn&#x27;s second-largest moon, Rhea, may have a tenuous ring system of its own, along with a tenuous atmosphere.

Many of the other moons are small: 131 are less than 50 km in diameter. Traditionally, most of Saturn&#x27;s moons have been named after Titans of Greek mythology. Titan is the only satellite in the Solar System with a major atmosphere, in which a complex organic chemistry occurs. It is the only satellite with hydrocarbon lakes.

On 6 June 2013, scientists at the IAA-CSIC reported the detection of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in the upper atmosphere of Titan, a possible precursor for life. On 23 June 2014, NASA claimed to have strong evidence that nitrogen in the atmosphere of Titan came from materials in the Oort cloud, associated with comets, and not from the materials that formed Saturn in earlier times.

Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus, which seems similar in chemical makeup to comets, has often been regarded as a potential habitat for microbial life. Evidence of this possibility includes the satellite&#x27;s salt-rich particles having an &quot;ocean-like&quot; composition that indicates most of Enceladus&#x27;s expelled ice comes from the evaporation of liquid salt water. A 2015 flyby by &quot;Cassini&quot; through a plume on Enceladus found most of the ingredients to sustain life forms that live by methanogenesis.

In April 2014, NASA scientists reported the possible beginning of a new moon within the A Ring, which was imaged by &quot;Cassini&quot; on 15 April 2013.

== Planetary rings ==
Saturn is probably best known for the system of planetary rings that makes it visually unique. The rings extend from outward from Saturn&#x27;s equator and average approximately in thickness. They are composed predominantly of water ice, with trace amounts of tholin impurities and a peppered coating of approximately 7% amorphous carbon. The particles that make up the rings range in size from specks of dust up to 10 m. While the other gas giants also have ring systems, Saturn&#x27;s is the largest and most visible.

There is a debate on the age of the rings. One side supports that they are ancient, and were created simultaneously with Saturn from the original nebular material (around 4.6 billion years ago), or shortly after the LHB (around 4.1 to 3.8 billion years ago). The other side supports that they are much younger, created around 100 million years ago. An MIT research team, supporting the latter theory, proposed that the rings are remnant of a destroyed moon of Saturn, named ″Chrysalis″.

Beyond the main rings, at a distance of 12 million km (7.5 million mi) from the planet is the sparse Phoebe ring. It is tilted at an angle of 27° to the other rings and, like Phoebe, orbits in retrograde fashion.

Some of the moons of Saturn, including Pandora and Prometheus, act as shepherd moons to confine the rings and prevent them from spreading out. Pan and Atlas cause weak, linear density waves in Saturn&#x27;s rings that have yielded more reliable calculations of their masses.

== History of observation and exploration ==

The observation and exploration of Saturn can be divided into three phases: (1) pre-modern observations with the naked eye, (2) telescopic observations from Earth beginning in the 17th century, and (3) visitation by space probes, in orbit or on flyby. In the 21st century, telescopic observations continue from Earth (including Earth-orbiting observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope) and, until its 2017 retirement, from the &quot;Cassini&quot; orbiter around Saturn.

=== Pre-telescopic observation ===
Saturn has been known since prehistoric times, and in early recorded history it was a major character in various mythologies. Babylonian astronomers systematically observed and recorded the movements of Saturn. In ancient Greek, the planet was known as Phainon, and in Roman times it was known as the &quot;star of Saturn&quot; or the &quot;star of the Sun (i.e. Helios)&quot;. In ancient Roman mythology, the planet Phainon was sacred to this agricultural god, from which the planet takes its modern name. The Romans considered the god Saturnus the equivalent of the Greek god Cronus; in modern Greek, the planet retains the name &quot;Cronus&quot;—: &quot;Kronos&quot;.

The Greek scientist Ptolemy based his calculations of Saturn&#x27;s orbit on observations he made while it was in opposition. In Hindu astrology, there are nine astrological objects, known as Navagrahas. Saturn is known as &quot;Shani&quot; and judges everyone based on the good and bad deeds performed in life. Ancient Chinese and Japanese culture designated the planet Saturn as the &quot;earth star&quot; (). This was based on Five Elements which were traditionally used to classify natural elements.

In Hebrew, Saturn is called &quot;Shabbathai&quot;. Its angel is Cassiel. Its intelligence or beneficial spirit is &#x27;Agȋȇl (), and its darker spirit (demon) is Zȃzȇl (). Zazel has been described as a great angel, invoked in Solomonic magic, who is &quot;effective in love conjurations&quot;. In Ottoman Turkish, Urdu, and Malay, the name of Zazel is &#x27;Zuhal&#x27;, derived from the Arabic language ().

=== Telescopic pre-spaceflight observations ===


Saturn&#x27;s rings require at least a 15-mm-diameter telescope to resolve and thus were not known to exist until Christiaan Huygens saw them in 1655 and published his observations in 1659. Galileo, with his primitive telescope in 1610, incorrectly thought of Saturn&#x27;s appearing not quite round as two moons on Saturn&#x27;s sides. It was not until Huygens used greater telescopic magnification that this notion was refuted, and the rings were truly seen for the first time. Huygens also discovered Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan; Giovanni Domenico Cassini later discovered four other moons: Iapetus, Rhea, Tethys, and Dione. In 1675, Cassini discovered the gap now known as the Cassini Division.

No further discoveries of significance were made until 1789 when William Herschel discovered two further moons, Mimas and Enceladus. The irregularly shaped satellite Hyperion, which has a resonance with Titan, was discovered in 1848 by a British team.

In 1899, William Henry Pickering discovered Phoebe, a highly irregular satellite that does not rotate synchronously with Saturn as the larger moons do. Phoebe was the first such satellite found and it took more than a year to orbit Saturn in a retrograde orbit. During the early 20th century, research on Titan led to the confirmation in 1944 that it had a thick atmosphere—a feature unique among the Solar System&#x27;s moons.

=== Spaceflight missions ===
==== &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; flyby ====
&quot;Pioneer 11&quot; made the first flyby of Saturn in September 1979, when it passed within of the planet&#x27;s cloud tops. Images were taken of the planet and a few of its moons, although their resolution was too low to discern surface detail. The spacecraft also studied Saturn&#x27;s rings, revealing the thin F-ring and the fact that dark gaps in the rings are bright when viewed at a high phase angle (towards the Sun), meaning that they contain fine light-scattering material. In addition, &quot;Pioneer 11&quot; measured the temperature of Titan.

==== &quot;Voyager&quot; flybys ====
In November 1980, the &quot;Voyager 1&quot; probe visited the Saturn system. It sent back the first high-resolution images of the planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. &quot;Voyager 1&quot; performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of the atmosphere of the moon. It proved that Titan&#x27;s atmosphere is impenetrable at visible wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory out of the plane of the Solar System.

Almost a year later, in August 1981, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; continued the study of the Saturn system. More close-up images of Saturn&#x27;s moons were acquired, as well as evidence of changes in the atmosphere and the rings. During the flyby, the probe&#x27;s turnable camera platform stuck for a couple of days and some planned imaging was lost. Saturn&#x27;s gravity was used to direct the spacecraft&#x27;s trajectory towards Uranus.

The probes discovered and confirmed several new satellites orbiting near or within the planet&#x27;s rings, as well as the small Maxwell Gap (a gap within the C Ring) and Keeler gap (a 42 km-wide gap in the A Ring).

==== &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; spacecraft ====

The &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; space probe entered orbit around Saturn on 1 July 2004. In June 2004, it conducted a close flyby of Phoebe, sending back high-resolution images and data. &quot;Cassini&quot; flyby of Saturn&#x27;s largest moon, Titan, captured radar images of large lakes and their coastlines with numerous islands and mountains. The orbiter completed two Titan flybys before releasing the &quot;Huygens&quot; probe on 25 December 2004. &quot;Huygens&quot; descended onto the surface of Titan on 14 January 2005.

Starting in early 2005, scientists used &quot;Cassini&quot; to track lightning on Saturn. The power of the lightning is approximately 1,000 times that of lightning on Earth.

In 2006, NASA reported that &quot;Cassini&quot; had found evidence of liquid water reservoirs no more than tens of meters below the surface that erupt in geysers on Saturn&#x27;s moon Enceladus. These jets of icy particles are emitted into orbit around Saturn from vents in the moon&#x27;s south polar region. Over 100 geysers have been identified on Enceladus. In May 2011, NASA scientists reported that Enceladus &quot;is emerging as the most habitable spot beyond Earth in the Solar System for life as we know it&quot;.

&quot;Cassini&quot; photographs have revealed a previously undiscovered planetary ring, outside the brighter main rings of Saturn and inside the G and E rings. The source of this ring is hypothesized to be the crashing of a meteoroid off Janus and Epimetheus. In July 2006, images were returned of hydrocarbon lakes near Titan&#x27;s north pole, the presence of which were confirmed in January 2007. In March 2007, hydrocarbon seas were found near the North pole, the largest of which is almost the size of the Caspian Sea. In October 2006, the probe detected an diameter cyclone-like storm with an eyewall at Saturn&#x27;s south pole.

From 2004 to 2 November 2009, the probe discovered and confirmed eight new satellites. In April 2013, &quot;Cassini&quot; sent back images of a hurricane at the planet&#x27;s north pole 20 times larger than those found on Earth, with winds faster than . On 15 September 2017, the &quot;Cassini–Huygens&quot; spacecraft performed the &quot;Grand Finale&quot; of its mission: a number of passes through gaps between Saturn and Saturn&#x27;s inner rings. The atmospheric entry of &quot;Cassini&quot; ended the mission.

==== Possible future missions ====
The continued exploration of Saturn is still considered to be a viable option for NASA as part of their ongoing New Frontiers program of missions. NASA previously requested for plans to be put forward for a mission to Saturn that included the Saturn Atmospheric Entry Probe, and possible investigations into the habitability and possible discovery of life on Saturn&#x27;s moons Titan and Enceladus by &quot;Dragonfly&quot;.

== Observation ==
Saturn is the most distant of the five planets easily visible to the naked eye from Earth, the other four being Mercury, Venus, Mars, and Jupiter. (Uranus, and occasionally 4 Vesta, are visible to the naked eye in dark skies.) Saturn appears to the naked eye in the night sky as a bright, yellowish point of light. The mean apparent magnitude of Saturn is 0.46 with a standard deviation of 0.34. Most of the magnitude variation is due to the inclination of the ring system relative to the Sun and Earth. The brightest magnitude, −0.55, occurs near the time when the plane of the rings is inclined most highly, and the faintest magnitude, 1.17, occurs around the time when they are least inclined. It takes approximately 29.4 years for the planet to complete an entire circuit of the ecliptic against the background constellations of the zodiac. Most people will require an optical aid (very large binoculars or a small telescope) that magnifies at least 30 times to achieve an image of Saturn&#x27;s rings in which a clear resolution is present. When Earth passes through the ring plane, which occurs twice every Saturnian year (roughly every 15 Earth years), the rings briefly disappear from view because they are so thin. Such a &quot;disappearance&quot; will next occur in 2025, but Saturn will be too close to the Sun for observations.

Saturn and its rings are best seen when the planet is at, or near, opposition, the configuration of a planet when it is at an elongation of 180°, and thus appears opposite the Sun in the sky. A Saturnian opposition occurs every year—approximately every 378 days—and results in the planet appearing at its brightest. Both the Earth and Saturn orbit the Sun on eccentric orbits, which means their distances from the Sun vary over time, and therefore so do their distances from each other, hence varying the brightness of Saturn from one opposition to the next. Saturn also appears brighter when the rings are angled such that they are more visible. For example, during the opposition of 17 December 2002, Saturn appeared at its brightest due to the favorable orientation of its rings relative to the Earth, even though Saturn was closer to the Earth and Sun in late 2003.

From time to time, Saturn is occulted by the Moon (that is, the Moon covers up Saturn in the sky). As with all the planets in the Solar System, occultations of Saturn occur in &quot;seasons&quot;. Saturnian occultations will take place monthly for about a 12-month period, followed by about a five-year period in which no such activity is registered. The Moon&#x27;s orbit is inclined by several degrees relative to Saturn&#x27;s, so occultations will only occur when Saturn is near one of the points in the sky where the two planes intersect (both the length of Saturn&#x27;s year and the 18.6-Earth-year nodal precession period of the Moon&#x27;s orbit influence the periodicity).

== In science fiction ==
In Christopher Nolan&#x27;s 2014 science fiction epic &quot;Interstellar&quot;, in proximity to Saturn is a wormhole leading to a planetary system in another galaxy, whose central object is a black hole known as Gargantua. The &quot;Endurance&quot; team enters the wormhole in the hopes of finding a habitable planet for humanity to settle as conditions on Earth deteriorate. At the end of the film, Cooper Station, named for the main character, is shown in orbit around Saturn.

<doc id="44475" wikidata="Q324" url="?curid=44475" title="Uranus">
<text>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It is a gaseous cyan-coloured ice giant. Most of the planet is made of water, ammonia, and methane in a supercritical phase of matter, which astronomy calls &quot;ice&quot; or volatiles. The planet&#x27;s atmosphere has a complex layered cloud structure and has the lowest minimum temperature () of all the Solar System&#x27;s planets. It has a marked axial tilt of 82.23° with a retrograde rotation period of 17 hours and 14 minutes. This means that in an 84-Earth-year orbital period around the Sun, its poles get around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of continuous darkness.

Uranus has the third-largest diameter and fourth-largest mass among the Solar System&#x27;s planets. Based on current models, inside its volatile mantle layer is a rocky core, and surrounding it is a thick hydrogen and helium atmosphere. Trace amounts of hydrocarbons (thought to be produced via hydrolysis) and carbon monoxide along with carbon dioxide (thought to have been originated from comets) have been detected in the upper atmosphere. There are many unexplained climate phenomena in Uranus&#x27;s atmosphere, such as its peak wind speed of , variations in its polar cap, and its erratic cloud formation. The planet also has very low internal heat compared to other giant planets, the cause of which remains unclear.

Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a magnetosphere, and many natural satellites. The extremely dark ring system reflects only about 2% of the incoming light. Uranus&#x27;s 28 natural satellites include 18 known regular moons, of which 13 are small inner moons. Further out are the larger five major moons of the planet: Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. Orbiting at a much greater distance from Uranus are the ten known irregular moons. The planet&#x27;s magnetosphere is highly asymmetric and has many charged particles, which may be the cause of the darkening of its rings and moons.

Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it is very dim and was not classified as a planet until 1781, when it was first observed by William Herschel. About seven decades after its discovery, consensus was reached that the planet be named after the Greek god Uranus (Ouranos), one of the Greek primordial deities. As of 2024, it had been visited up close only once when in 1986 the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; probe flew by the planet. Though nowadays it can be resolved and observed by telescopes, there is much desire to revisit the planet, as shown by Planetary Science Decadal Survey&#x27;s decision to make the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe mission a top priority in the 2023–2032 survey, and the CNSA&#x27;s proposal to fly by the planet with a subprobe of &quot;Tianwen-4&quot;.

== History ==

Like the classical planets, Uranus is visible to the naked eye, but it was never recognised as a planet by ancient observers because of its dimness and slow orbit. William Herschel first observed Uranus on 13 March 1781, leading to its discovery as a planet, expanding the known boundaries of the Solar System for the first time in history and making Uranus the first planet classified as such with the aid of a telescope. The discovery of Uranus also effectively doubled the size of the known Solar System because Uranus is around twice the distance from the Sun as the planet Saturn.

=== Discovery ===

Before its recognition as a planet, Uranus had been observed on numerous occasions, albeit generally misidentified as a star. The earliest possible known observation was by Hipparchus, who in 128 BC might have recorded it as a star for his star catalogue that was later incorporated into Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;. The earliest definite sighting was in 1690, when John Flamsteed observed it at least six times, cataloguing it as 34 Tauri. The French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier observed Uranus at least twelve times between 1750 and 1769, including on four consecutive nights.

William Herschel observed Uranus on 13 March 1781 from the garden of his house at 19 New King Street in Bath, Somerset, England (now the Herschel Museum of Astronomy), and initially reported it (on 26 April 1781) as a comet. With a homemade 6.2-inch reflecting telescope, Herschel &quot;engaged in a series of observations on the parallax of the fixed stars.&quot;

Herschel recorded in his journal: &quot;In the quartile near ζ Tauri ... either [a] Nebulous star or perhaps a comet.&quot; On 17 March he noted: &quot;I looked for the Comet or Nebulous Star and found that it is a Comet, for it has changed its place.&quot; When he presented his discovery to the Royal Society, he continued to assert that he had found a comet, but also implicitly compared it to a planet:

Herschel notified the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne of his discovery and received this flummoxed reply from him on 23 April 1781: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what to call it. It is as likely to be a regular planet moving in an orbit nearly circular to the sun as a Comet moving in a very eccentric ellipsis. I have not yet seen any coma or tail to it.&quot;

Although Herschel continued to describe his new object as a comet, other astronomers had already begun to suspect otherwise. Finnish-Swedish astronomer Anders Johan Lexell, working in Russia, was the first to compute the orbit of the new object. Its nearly circular orbit led him to the conclusion that it was a planet rather than a comet. Berlin astronomer Johann Elert Bode described Herschel&#x27;s discovery as &quot;a moving star that can be deemed a hitherto unknown planet-like object circulating beyond the orbit of Saturn&quot;. Bode concluded that its near-circular orbit was more like a planet&#x27;s than a comet&#x27;s.

The object was soon universally accepted as a new planet. By 1783, Herschel acknowledged this to Royal Society president Joseph Banks: &quot;By the observation of the most eminent Astronomers in Europe it appears that the new star, which I had the honour of pointing out to them in March 1781, is a Primary Planet of our Solar System.&quot; In recognition of his achievement, King George III gave Herschel an annual stipend of £200 () on condition that he moved to Windsor so that the Royal Family could look through his telescopes.

=== Name ===
The name Uranus references the ancient Greek deity of the sky Uranus (), known as Caelus in Roman mythology, the father of Cronus (Saturn), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and the great-grandfather of Ares (Mars), which was rendered as in Latin (). It is the only one of the eight planets whose English name derives from a figure of Greek mythology. The pronunciation of the name &quot;Uranus&quot; preferred among astronomers is , with the long &quot;u&quot; of English and stress on the first syllable as in Latin , in contrast to , with stress on the second syllable and a long &quot;a&quot;, though both are considered acceptable.

Consensus on the name was not reached until almost 70 years after the planet&#x27;s discovery. During the original discussions following discovery, Maskelyne asked Herschel to &quot;do the astronomical world the to give a name to your planet, which is entirely your own, [and] which we are so much obliged to you for the discovery of&quot;. In response to Maskelyne&#x27;s request, Herschel decided to name the object (George&#x27;s Star), or the &quot;Georgian Planet&quot; in honour of his new patron, King George III. He explained this decision in a letter to Joseph Banks:

Herschel&#x27;s proposed name was not popular outside Britain and Hanover, and alternatives were soon proposed. Astronomer Jérôme Lalande proposed that it be named &quot;Herschel&quot; in honour of its discoverer. Swedish astronomer Erik Prosperin proposed the names &quot;Astraea,&quot; &quot;Cybele&quot; (now the names of asteroids), and &quot;Neptune&quot;, which would become the name of the next planet to be discovered. Georg Lichtenberg from Göttingen also supported &quot;Astraea&quot; (as &quot;Austräa&quot;), but she is traditionally associated with Virgo instead of Taurus. &quot;Neptune&quot; was supported by other astronomers who liked the idea of commemorating the victories of the British Royal Naval fleet in the course of the American Revolutionary War by calling the new planet either &quot;Neptune George III&quot; or &quot;Neptune Great Britain&quot;, a compromise Lexell suggested as well. Daniel Bernoulli suggested &quot;Hypercronius&quot; and &quot;Transaturnis&quot;. &quot;Minerva&quot; was also proposed.

In a March 1782 treatise, Johann Elert Bode proposed &quot;Uranus&quot;, the Latinised version of the Greek god of the sky, Ouranos. Bode argued that the name should follow the mythology so as not to stand out as different from the other planets, and that Uranus was an appropriate name as the father of the first generation of the Titans. He also noted the elegance of the name in that just as Saturn was the father of Jupiter, the new planet should be named after the father of Saturn. However, he was apparently unaware that &quot;Uranus&quot; was only the Latinised form of the deity&#x27;s name, and the Roman equivalent was Caelus. In 1789, Bode&#x27;s Royal Academy colleague Martin Klaproth named his newly discovered element uranium in support of Bode&#x27;s choice. Ultimately, Bode&#x27;s suggestion became the most widely used, and became universal in 1850 when HM Nautical Almanac Office, the final holdout, switched from using &quot;Georgium Sidus&quot; to &quot;Uranus&quot;.

Uranus has two astronomical symbols. The first to be proposed, , was proposed by Johann Gottfried Köhler at Bode&#x27;s request in 1782. Köhler suggested that the new planet be given the symbol for platinum, which had been described scientifically only 30 years before. As there was no alchemical symbol for platinum, he suggested ⛢ or ⛢, a combination of the planetary-metal symbols ☉ (gold) and ♂ (iron), as platinum (or &#x27;white gold&#x27;) is found mixed with iron. Bode thought that an upright orientation, ⛢, fit better with the symbols for the other planets while remaining distinct. This symbol predominates in modern astronomical use in the rare cases that symbols are used at all. The second symbol, , was suggested by Lalande in 1784. In a letter to Herschel, Lalande described it as &quot;&quot; (&quot;a globe surmounted by the first letter of your surname&quot;). The second symbol is nearly universal in astrology.

In English-language popular culture, humour is often derived from the common pronunciation of Uranus&#x27;s name, which resembles that of the phrase &quot;your anus&quot;.

Uranus is called by a variety of names in other languages. Uranus&#x27;s name is literally translated as the &quot;Heavenly King star&quot; in Chinese (), Japanese (天王星), Korean (천왕성), and Vietnamese (&quot;sao Thiên Vương&quot;). In Thai, its official name is (), as in English. Its other name in Thai is (, Star of Mṛtyu), after the Sanskrit word for &#x27;death&#x27;, (). In Mongolian, its name is (), translated as &#x27;King of the Sky&#x27;, reflecting its namesake god&#x27;s role as the ruler of the heavens. In Hawaiian, its name is , the Hawaiian rendering of the name &#x27;Herschel&#x27;.

== Formation ==


It is argued that the differences between the ice giants and the gas giants arise from their formation history. The Solar System is hypothesised to have formed from a rotating disk of gas and dust known as the presolar nebula. Much of the nebula&#x27;s gas, primarily hydrogen and helium, formed the Sun, and the dust grains collected together to form the first protoplanets. As the planets grew, some of them eventually accreted enough matter for their gravity to hold on to the nebula&#x27;s leftover gas. The more gas they held onto, the larger they became; the larger they became, the more gas they held onto until a critical point was reached, and their size began to increase exponentially. The ice giants, with only a few Earth masses of nebular gas, never reached that critical point. Recent simulations of planetary migration have suggested that both ice giants formed closer to the Sun than their present positions, and moved outwards after formation (the Nice model).

== Orbit and rotation ==
Uranus orbits the Sun once every 84 years. As viewed against the background of stars, since being discovered in 1781, the planet has returned to the point of its discovery northeast of the binary star Zeta Tauri twice—in March 1865 and March 1949—and will return to this location again in April 2033.

Its average distance from the Sun is roughly . The difference between its minimum and maximum distance from the Sun is 1.8 AU, larger than that of any other planet, though not as large as that of dwarf planet Pluto. The intensity of sunlight varies inversely with the square of the distance—on Uranus (at about 20 times the distance from the Sun compared to Earth), it is about 1/400 the intensity of light on Earth.

The orbital elements of Uranus were first calculated in 1783 by Pierre-Simon Laplace. With time, discrepancies began to appear between predicted and observed orbits, and in 1841, John Couch Adams first proposed that the differences might be due to the gravitational tug of an unseen planet. In 1845, Urbain Le Verrier began his own independent research into Uranus&#x27;s orbit. On 23 September 1846, Johann Gottfried Galle located a new planet, later named Neptune, at nearly the position predicted by Le Verrier.

The rotational period of the interior of Uranus is 17 hours, 14 minutes. As on all giant planets, its upper atmosphere experiences strong winds in the direction of rotation. At some latitudes, such as about 60 degrees south, visible features of the atmosphere move much faster, making a full rotation in as little as 14 hours.

=== Axial tilt ===

The Uranian axis of rotation is approximately parallel to the plane of the Solar System, with an axial tilt of 82.23°. Depending on which pole is considered north, the tilt can be described either as 82.23° or as 97.8°. The former follows the International Astronomical Union definition that the north pole is the pole which lies on Earth&#x27;s North&#x27;s side of the invariable plane of the Solar System. Uranus has retrograde rotation when defined this way. Alternatively, the convention in which a body&#x27;s north and south poles are defined according to the right-hand rule in relation to the direction of rotation, Uranus&#x27;s axial tilt may be given instead as 97.8°, which reverses which pole is considered north and which is considered south and giving the planet prograde rotation. This gives it seasonal changes completely unlike those of the other planets. Pluto and asteroid 2 Pallas also have extreme axial tilts. Near the solstice, one pole faces the Sun continuously and the other faces away, with only a narrow strip around the equator experiencing a rapid day–night cycle, with the Sun low over the horizon. On the other side of Uranus&#x27;s orbit, the orientation of the poles towards the Sun is reversed. Each pole gets around 42 years of continuous sunlight, followed by 42 years of darkness. Near the time of the equinoxes, the Sun faces the equator of Uranus, giving a period of day–night cycles similar to those seen on most of the other planets.

One result of this axis orientation is that, averaged over the Uranian year, the near-polar regions of Uranus receive a greater energy input from the Sun than its equatorial regions. Nevertheless, Uranus is hotter at its equator than at its poles. The underlying mechanism that causes this is unknown. The cause of Uranus&#x27;s unusual axial tilt is also not known with certainty, but the usual speculation is that during the formation of the Solar System, an Earth-sized protoplanet collided with Uranus, causing the skewed orientation. Research by Jacob Kegerreis of Durham University suggests that the tilt resulted from a rock larger than Earth crashing into the planet 3 to 4 billion years ago. Uranus&#x27;s south pole was pointed almost directly at the Sun at the time of &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby in 1986.

=== Visibility from Earth ===
The mean apparent magnitude of Uranus is 5.68 with a standard deviation of 0.17, while the extremes are 5.38 and 6.03. This range of brightness is near the limit of naked eye visibility. Much of the variability is dependent upon the planetary latitudes being illuminated from the Sun and viewed from the Earth. Its angular diameter is between 3.4 and 3.7 arcseconds, compared with 16 to 20 arcseconds for Saturn and 32 to 45 arcseconds for Jupiter. At opposition, Uranus is visible to the naked eye in dark skies, and becomes an easy target even in urban conditions with binoculars. On larger amateur telescopes with an objective diameter of between 15 and 23 cm, Uranus appears as a pale cyan disk with distinct limb darkening. With a large telescope of 25 cm or wider, cloud patterns, as well as some of the larger satellites, such as Titania and Oberon, may be visible.

== Internal structure ==

Uranus&#x27;s mass is roughly 14.5 times that of Earth, making it the least massive of the giant planets. Its diameter is slightly larger than Neptune&#x27;s at roughly four times that of Earth. A resulting density of 1.27 g/cm3 makes Uranus the second least dense planet, after Saturn. This value indicates that it is made primarily of various ices, such as water, ammonia, and methane. The total mass of ice in Uranus&#x27;s interior is not precisely known, because different figures emerge depending on the model chosen; it must be between 9.3 and 13.5 Earth masses. Hydrogen and helium constitute only a small part of the total, with between 0.5 and 1.5 Earth masses. The remainder of the non-ice mass (0.5 to 3.7 Earth masses) is accounted for by rocky material.

The standard model of Uranus&#x27;s structure is that it consists of three layers: a rocky (silicate/iron–nickel) core in the centre, an icy mantle in the middle, and an outer gaseous hydrogen/helium envelope. The core is relatively small, with a mass of only 0.55 Earth masses and a radius less than 20% of the planet; the mantle comprises its bulk, with around 13.4 Earth masses, and the upper atmosphere is relatively insubstantial, weighing about 0.5 Earth masses and extending for the last 20% of Uranus&#x27;s radius. Uranus&#x27;s core density is around 9 g/cm3, with a pressure in the centre of 8 million bars (800 GPa) and a temperature of about 5000 K. The ice mantle is not in fact composed of ice in the conventional sense, but of a hot and dense fluid consisting of water, ammonia and other volatiles. This fluid, which has a high electrical conductivity, is sometimes called a water–ammonia ocean.

The extreme pressure and temperature deep within Uranus may break up the methane molecules, with the carbon atoms condensing into crystals of diamond that rain down through the mantle like hailstones. This phenomenon is similar to diamond rains that are theorised by scientists to exist on Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune. Very-high-pressure experiments at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory suggest that an ocean of metallic liquid carbon, perhaps with floating solid &#x27;diamond-bergs&#x27;, may comprise the base of the mantle.

The bulk compositions of Uranus and Neptune are different from those of Jupiter and Saturn, with ice dominating over gases, hence justifying their separate classification as ice giants. There may be a layer of ionic water where the water molecules break down into a soup of hydrogen and oxygen ions, and deeper down superionic water in which the oxygen crystallises but the hydrogen ions move freely within the oxygen lattice.

Although the model considered above is reasonably standard, it is not unique; other models also satisfy observations. For instance, if substantial amounts of hydrogen and rocky material are mixed in the ice mantle, the total mass of ices in the interior will be lower, and, correspondingly, the total mass of rocks and hydrogen will be higher. Presently available data does not allow a scientific determination of which model is correct. The fluid interior structure of Uranus means that it has no solid surface. The gaseous atmosphere gradually transitions into the internal liquid layers. For the sake of convenience, a revolving oblate spheroid set at the point at which atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa) is conditionally designated as a &quot;surface&quot;. It has equatorial and polar radii of and , respectively. This surface is used throughout this article as a zero point for altitudes.

=== Internal heat ===
Uranus&#x27;s internal heat appears markedly lower than that of the other giant planets; in astronomical terms, it has a low thermal flux. Why Uranus&#x27;s internal temperature is so low is still not understood. Neptune, which is Uranus&#x27;s near twin in size and composition, radiates 2.61 times as much energy into space as it receives from the Sun, but Uranus radiates hardly any excess heat at all. The total power radiated by Uranus in the far infrared (i.e. heat) part of the spectrum is times the solar energy absorbed in its atmosphere. Uranus&#x27;s heat flux is only , which is lower than the internal heat flux of Earth of about . The lowest temperature recorded in Uranus&#x27;s tropopause is , making Uranus the coldest planet in the Solar System.

One of the hypotheses for this discrepancy suggests the Earth-sized impactor theorised to be behind Uranus&#x27;s axial tilt left the planet with a depleted core temperature, as the impact caused Uranus to expel most of its primordial heat. Another hypothesis is that some form of barrier exists in Uranus&#x27;s upper layers that prevents the core&#x27;s heat from reaching the surface. For example, convection may take place in a set of compositionally different layers, which may inhibit upward heat transport; perhaps double diffusive convection is a limiting factor.

In a 2021 study, the ice giants&#x27; interior conditions were mimicked by compressing water that contained minerals such as olivine and ferropericlase, thus showing that large amounts of magnesium could be dissolved in the liquid interiors of Uranus and Neptune. If Uranus has more of this magnesium than Neptune, it could form a thermal insulation layer, thus potentially explaining the planet&#x27;s low temperature.

== Atmosphere ==

Although there is no well-defined solid surface within Uranus&#x27;s interior, the outermost part of Uranus&#x27;s gaseous envelope that is accessible to remote sensing is called its atmosphere. Remote-sensing capability extends down to roughly 300 km below the level, with a corresponding pressure around and temperature of . The tenuous thermosphere extends over two planetary radii from the nominal surface, which is defined to lie at a pressure of 1 bar. The Uranian atmosphere can be divided into three layers: the troposphere, between altitudes of and pressures from 100 to 0.1 bar (10 MPa to 10 kPa); the stratosphere, spanning altitudes between and pressures of between (10 kPa to 10 μPa); and the thermosphere extending from 4,000 km to as high as 50,000 km from the surface. There is no mesosphere.

=== Composition ===

The composition of Uranus&#x27;s atmosphere is different from its bulk, consisting mainly of molecular hydrogen and helium. The helium molar fraction, i.e. the number of helium atoms per molecule of gas, is in the upper troposphere, which corresponds to a mass fraction . This value is close to the protosolar helium mass fraction of , indicating that helium has not settled in its centre as it has in the gas giants. The third-most-abundant component of Uranus&#x27;s atmosphere is methane (). Methane has prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared (IR), making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour. Methane molecules account for 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction below the methane cloud deck at the pressure level of ; this represents about 20 to 30 times the carbon abundance found in the Sun.

The mixing ratio is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to its extremely low temperature, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. The abundances of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water, and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere are poorly known. They are probably also higher than solar values. Along with methane, trace amounts of various hydrocarbons are found in the stratosphere of Uranus, which are thought to be produced from methane by photolysis induced by the solar ultraviolet (UV) radiation. They include ethane (), acetylene (), methylacetylene (), and diacetylene (). Spectroscopy has also uncovered traces of water vapour, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide in the upper atmosphere, which can only originate from an external source such as infalling dust and comets.

=== Troposphere ===
The troposphere is the lowest and densest part of the atmosphere and is characterised by a decrease in temperature with altitude. The temperature falls from about at the base of the nominal troposphere at −300 km to at 50 km. The temperatures in the coldest upper region of the troposphere (the tropopause) actually vary in the range between depending on planetary latitude. The tropopause region is responsible for the vast majority of Uranus&#x27;s thermal far infrared emissions, thus determining its effective temperature of .

The troposphere is thought to have a highly complex cloud structure; water clouds are hypothesised to lie in the pressure range of , ammonium hydrosulfide clouds in the range of , ammonia or hydrogen sulfide clouds at between and finally directly detected thin methane clouds at . The troposphere is a dynamic part of the atmosphere, exhibiting strong winds, bright clouds, and seasonal changes.

=== Upper atmosphere ===

The middle layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the stratosphere, where temperature generally increases with altitude from in the tropopause to between at the base of the thermosphere. The heating of the stratosphere is caused by absorption of solar UV and IR radiation by methane and other hydrocarbons, which form in this part of the atmosphere as a result of methane photolysis. Heat is also conducted from the hot thermosphere. The hydrocarbons occupy a relatively narrow layer at altitudes of between 100 and 300 km corresponding to a pressure range of 1,000 to 10 Pa and temperatures of between .

The most abundant hydrocarbons are methane, acetylene, and ethane with mixing ratios of around relative to hydrogen. The mixing ratio of carbon monoxide is similar at these altitudes. Heavier hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide have mixing ratios three orders of magnitude lower. The abundance ratio of water is around 7. Ethane and acetylene tend to condense in the colder lower part of the stratosphere and tropopause (below 10 mBar level) forming haze layers, which may be partly responsible for the bland appearance of Uranus. The concentration of hydrocarbons in the Uranian stratosphere above the haze is significantly lower than in the stratospheres of the other giant planets.

The outermost layer of the Uranian atmosphere is the thermosphere and corona, which has a uniform temperature of around to . The heat sources necessary to sustain such a high level are not understood, as neither the solar UV nor the auroral activity can provide the necessary energy to maintain these temperatures. The weak cooling efficiency due to the lack of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere above 0.1 mBar pressure levels may contribute too. In addition to molecular hydrogen, the thermosphere-corona contains many free hydrogen atoms. Their small mass and high temperatures explain why the corona extends as far as , or two Uranian radii, from its surface.

This extended corona is a unique feature of Uranus. Its effects include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings. The Uranian thermosphere, together with the upper part of the stratosphere, corresponds to the ionosphere of Uranus. Observations show that the ionosphere occupies altitudes from . The Uranian ionosphere is denser than that of either Saturn or Neptune, which may arise from the low concentration of hydrocarbons in the stratosphere. The ionosphere is mainly sustained by solar UV radiation and its density depends on the solar activity. Auroral activity is insignificant as compared to Jupiter and Saturn.

== Climate ==
At ultraviolet and visible wavelengths, Uranus&#x27;s atmosphere is bland in comparison to the other giant planets, even to Neptune, which it otherwise closely resembles. When &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flew by Uranus in 1986, it observed a total of 10 cloud features across the entire planet. One proposed explanation for this dearth of features is that Uranus&#x27;s internal heat is markedly lower than that of the other giant planets, being the coldest planet in the Solar System.

=== Banded structure, winds and clouds ===

In 1986, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; found that the visible southern hemisphere of Uranus can be subdivided into two regions: a bright polar cap and dark equatorial bands. Their boundary is located at about −45° of latitude. A narrow band straddling the latitudinal range from −45 to −50° is the brightest large feature on its visible surface. It is called a southern &quot;collar&quot;. The cap and collar are thought to be a dense region of methane clouds located within the pressure range of 1.3 to 2 bar. Besides the large-scale banded structure, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; observed ten small bright clouds, most lying several degrees to the north from the collar. In all other respects, Uranus looked like a dynamically dead planet in 1986.

&quot;Voyager 2&quot; arrived during the height of Uranus&#x27;s southern summer and could not observe the northern hemisphere. At the beginning of the 21st century, when the northern polar region came into view, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and Keck telescope initially observed neither a collar nor a polar cap in the northern hemisphere. So Uranus appeared to be asymmetric: bright near the south pole and uniformly dark in the region north of the southern collar. In 2007, when Uranus passed its equinox, the southern collar almost disappeared, and a faint northern collar emerged near 45° of latitude. In 2023, a team employing the Very Large Array observed a dark collar at 80° latitude, and a bright spot at the north pole, indicating the presence of a polar vortex.

In the 1990s, the number of the observed bright cloud features grew considerably, partly because new high-resolution imaging techniques became available. Most were found in the northern hemisphere as it started to become visible. An early explanation—that bright clouds are easier to identify in its dark part, whereas in the southern hemisphere the bright collar masks them—was shown to be incorrect. Nevertheless, there are differences between the clouds of each hemisphere. The northern clouds are smaller, sharper and brighter. They appear to lie at a higher altitude. The lifetime of clouds spans several orders of magnitude. Some small clouds live for hours; at least one southern cloud may have persisted since the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; flyby. Recent observation also discovered that cloud features on Uranus have a lot in common with those on Neptune. For example, the dark spots common on Neptune had never been observed on Uranus before 2006, when the first such feature dubbed Uranus Dark Spot was imaged. The speculation is that Uranus is becoming more Neptune-like during its equinoctial season.

The tracking of numerous cloud features allowed determination of zonal winds blowing in the upper troposphere of Uranus. At the equator winds are retrograde, which means that they blow in the reverse direction to the planetary rotation. Their speeds are from . Wind speeds increase with the distance from the equator, reaching zero values near ±20° latitude, where the troposphere&#x27;s temperature minimum is located. Closer to the poles, the winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus&#x27;s rotation. Wind speeds continue to increase reaching maxima at ±60° latitude before falling to zero at the poles. Wind speeds at −40° latitude range from . Because the collar obscures all clouds below that parallel, speeds between it and the southern pole are impossible to measure. In contrast, in the northern hemisphere maximum speeds as high as are observed near +50° latitude.

In 1986, the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; Planetary Radio Astronomy (PRA) experiment observed 140 lightning flashes, or Uranian electrostatic discharges with a frequency of 0.9-40 MHz. The UEDs were detected from 600,000 km of Uranus over 24 hours, most of which were not visible . However, microphysical modelling suggests that Uranian lightning occurs in convective storms occurring in deep troposphere water clouds. If this is the case, lightning will not be visible due to the thick cloud layers above the troposphere. The UEDs were detected from 600,000 km of Uranus, most of which were not visible . Uranian lightning has a power of around 108 W, emits 1×10^7 J - 2×10^7 J of energy, and lasts an average of 120 ms. There is a possibility that the power of Uranian lightning varies greatly with the seasons caused by changes in convection rates in the clouds The UEDs were detected from 600,000 km of Uranus, most of which were not visible. Uranian lightning is much more powerful than lightning on Earth and comparable to Jovian lightning. During the Ice Giant flybys, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; detected lightning more clearly on Uranus than on Neptune due to the planet&#x27;s lower gravity and possible warmer deep atmosphere.

=== Seasonal variation ===
For a short period from March to May 2004, large clouds appeared in the Uranian atmosphere, giving it a Neptune-like appearance. Observations included record-breaking wind speeds of and a persistent thunderstorm referred to as &quot;Fourth of July fireworks&quot;. On 23 August 2006, researchers at the Space Science Institute (Boulder, Colorado) and the University of Wisconsin observed a dark spot on Uranus&#x27;s surface, giving scientists more insight into Uranus atmospheric activity. Why this sudden upsurge in activity occurred is not fully known, but it appears that Uranus&#x27;s extreme axial tilt results in extreme seasonal variations in its weather. Determining the nature of this seasonal variation is difficult because good data on Uranus&#x27;s atmosphere has existed for less than 84 years, or one full Uranian year. Photometry over the course of half a Uranian year (beginning in the 1950s) has shown regular variation in the brightness in two spectral bands, with maxima occurring at the solstices and minima occurring at the equinoxes. A similar periodic variation, with maxima at the solstices, has been noted in microwave measurements of the deep troposphere begun in the 1960s. Stratospheric temperature measurements beginning in the 1970s also showed maximum values near the 1986 solstice. The majority of this variability is thought to occur owing to changes in viewing geometry.

There are some indications that physical seasonal changes are happening in Uranus. Although Uranus is known to have a bright south polar region, the north pole is fairly dim, which is incompatible with the model of the seasonal change outlined above. During its previous northern solstice in 1944, Uranus displayed elevated levels of brightness, which suggests that the north pole was not always so dim. This information implies that the visible pole brightens some time before the solstice and darkens after the equinox. Detailed analysis of the visible and microwave data revealed that the periodical changes in brightness are not completely symmetrical around the solstices, which also indicates a change in the meridional albedo patterns.

In the 1990s, as Uranus moved away from its solstice, Hubble and ground-based telescopes revealed that the south polar cap darkened noticeably (except the southern collar, which remained bright), whereas the northern hemisphere demonstrated increasing activity, such as cloud formations and stronger winds, bolstering expectations that it should brighten soon. This indeed happened in 2007 when it passed an equinox: a faint northern polar collar arose, and the southern collar became nearly invisible, although the zonal wind profile remained slightly asymmetric, with northern winds being somewhat slower than southern.

The mechanism of these physical changes is still not clear. Near the summer and winter solstices, Uranus&#x27;s hemispheres lie alternately either in full glare of the Sun&#x27;s rays or facing deep space. The brightening of the sunlit hemisphere is thought to result from the local thickening of the methane clouds and haze layers located in the troposphere. The bright collar at −45° latitude is also connected with methane clouds. Other changes in the southern polar region can be explained by changes in the lower cloud layers. The variation of the microwave emission from Uranus is probably caused by changes in the deep tropospheric circulation, because thick polar clouds and haze may inhibit convection. Now that the spring and autumn equinoxes are arriving on Uranus, the dynamics are changing and convection can occur again.

== Magnetosphere ==

Before the arrival of &quot;Voyager 2&quot;, no measurements of the Uranian magnetosphere had been taken, so its nature remained a mystery. Before 1986, scientists had expected the magnetic field of Uranus to be in line with the solar wind, because it would then align with Uranus&#x27;s poles that lie in the ecliptic.

&quot;Voyager&quot;″s observations revealed that Uranus&#x27;s magnetic field is peculiar, both because it does not originate from its geometric centre, and because it is tilted at 59° from the axis of rotation. In fact, the magnetic dipole is shifted from Uranus&#x27;s centre towards the south rotational pole by as much as one-third of the planetary radius. This unusual geometry results in a highly asymmetric magnetosphere, where the magnetic field strength on the surface in the southern hemisphere can be as low as 0.1 gauss (10 μT), whereas in the northern hemisphere it can be as high as 1.1 gauss (110 μT). The average field at the surface is 0.23 gauss (23 μT).

Studies of &quot;Voyager 2&quot; data in 2017 suggest that this asymmetry causes Uranus&#x27;s magnetosphere to connect with the solar wind once a Uranian day, opening the planet to the Sun&#x27;s particles. In comparison, the magnetic field of Earth is roughly as strong at either pole, and its &quot;magnetic equator&quot; is roughly parallel with its geographical equator. The dipole moment of Uranus is 50 times that of Earth. Neptune has a similarly displaced and tilted magnetic field, suggesting that this may be a common feature of ice giants. One hypothesis is that, unlike the magnetic fields of the terrestrial and gas giants, which are generated within their cores, the ice giants&#x27; magnetic fields are generated by motion at relatively shallow depths, for instance, in the water–ammonia ocean. Another possible explanation for the magnetosphere&#x27;s alignment is that there are oceans of liquid diamond in Uranus&#x27;s interior that would deter the magnetic field.

It is, however, unclear whether the observed asymmetry of Uranus&#x27; magnetic field represents the typical state of the magnetosphere, or a coincidence of observing it during unusual space weather conditions. A post-analysis of Voyager data from 2024 suggests that the strongly asymmetric shape of the magnetosphere observed during the fly-by represents an anomalous state, as the measured values of solar wind density at the time were unusually high, which could have compressed Uranus&#x27; magnetosphere. The interaction with the solar wind event could also explain the apparent paradox of presence of strong electron radiation belts despite the otherwise low magnetospheric plasma density measured. Such conditions are estimated to occur less than 5% of the time.

Despite its curious alignment, in other respects the Uranian magnetosphere is like those of other planets: it has a bow shock at about 23 Uranian radii ahead of it, a magnetopause at 18 Uranian radii, a fully developed magnetotail, and radiation belts. Overall, the structure of Uranus&#x27;s magnetosphere is different from Jupiter&#x27;s and more similar to Saturn&#x27;s. Uranus&#x27;s magnetotail trails behind it into space for millions of kilometres and is twisted by its sideways rotation into a long corkscrew.Uranus&#x27;s magnetosphere contains charged particles: mainly protons and electrons, with a small amount of H2+ ions. Many of these particles probably derive from the thermosphere. The ion and electron energies can be as high as 4 and 1.2 megaelectronvolts, respectively. The density of low-energy (below 1 kiloelectronvolt) ions in the inner magnetosphere is about 2 cm−3. The particle population is strongly affected by the Uranian moons, which sweep through the magnetosphere, leaving noticeable gaps. The particle flux is high enough to cause darkening or space weathering of their surfaces on an astronomically rapid timescale of 100,000 years. This may be the cause of the uniformly dark colouration of the Uranian satellites and rings.

Uranus has relatively well developed aurorae, which are seen as bright arcs around both magnetic poles. Unlike Jupiter&#x27;s, Uranus&#x27;s aurorae seem to be insignificant for the energy balance of the planetary thermosphere. They, or rather their trihydrogen cations&#x27; infrared spectral emissions, have been studied in-depth as of late 2023.

In March 2020, NASA astronomers reported the detection of a large atmospheric magnetic bubble, also known as a plasmoid, released into outer space from the planet Uranus, after reevaluating old data recorded by the &quot;Voyager 2&quot; space probe during a flyby of the planet in 1986.

== Moons ==

Uranus has 28 known natural satellites. The names of these satellites are chosen from characters in the works of Shakespeare and Alexander Pope. The five main satellites are Miranda, Ariel, Umbriel, Titania, and Oberon. The Uranian satellite system is the least massive among those of the giant planets; the combined mass of the five major satellites would be less than half that of Triton (largest moon of Neptune) alone. The largest of Uranus&#x27;s satellites, Titania, has a radius of only , or less than half that of the Moon, but slightly more than Rhea, the second-largest satellite of Saturn, making Titania the eighth-largest moon in the Solar System. Uranus&#x27;s satellites have relatively low albedos; ranging from 0.20 for Umbriel to 0.35 for Ariel (in green light). They are ice–rock conglomerates composed of roughly 50% ice and 50% rock. The ice may include ammonia and carbon dioxide.

Among the Uranian satellites, Ariel appears to have the youngest surface, with the fewest impact craters, and Umbriel the oldest. Miranda has fault canyons deep, terraced layers, and a chaotic variation in surface ages and features. Miranda&#x27;s past geologic activity is thought to have been driven by tidal heating at a time when its orbit was more eccentric than currently, probably as a result of a former 3:1 orbital resonance with Umbriel. Extensional processes associated with upwelling diapirs are the likely origin of Miranda&#x27;s &#x27;racetrack&#x27;-like coronae. Ariel is thought to have once been held in a 4:1 resonance with Titania.

Uranus has at least one horseshoe orbiter occupying the Sun–Uranus Lagrangian point—a gravitationally unstable region at 180° in its orbit, 83982 Crantor. Crantor moves inside Uranus&#x27;s co-orbital region on a complex, temporary horseshoe orbit. is also a promising Uranus horseshoe librator candidate.

== Rings ==
The Uranian rings are composed of extremely dark particles, which vary in size from micrometres to a fraction of a metre. Thirteen distinct rings are presently known, the brightest being the ε ring. All except the two rings of Uranus are extremely narrow—they are usually a few kilometres wide. The rings are probably quite young; the dynamics considerations indicate that they did not form with Uranus. The matter in the rings may once have been part of a moon (or moons) that was shattered by high-speed impacts. From numerous pieces of debris that formed as a result of those impacts, only a few particles survived, in stable zones corresponding to the locations of the present rings.

William Herschel described a possible ring around Uranus in 1789. This sighting is generally considered doubtful, because the rings are quite faint, and in the two following centuries none were noted by other observers. Still, Herschel made an accurate description of the epsilon ring&#x27;s size, its angle relative to Earth, its red colour, and its apparent changes as Uranus travelled around the Sun. The ring system was definitively discovered on 10 March 1977 by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Jessica Mink using the Kuiper Airborne Observatory. The discovery was serendipitous; they planned to use the occultation of the star SAO 158687 (also known as HD 128598) by Uranus to study its atmosphere. When their observations were analysed, they found that the star had disappeared briefly from view five times both before and after it disappeared behind Uranus. They concluded that there must be a ring system around Uranus. Later, they detected four additional rings. The rings were directly imaged when &quot;Voyager 2&quot; passed Uranus in 1986. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; also discovered two additional faint rings, bringing the total number to eleven.

In December 2005, the Hubble Space Telescope detected a pair of previously unknown rings. The largest is located twice as far from Uranus as the previously known rings. These new rings are so far from Uranus that they are called the &quot;outer&quot; ring system. Hubble also spotted two small satellites, one of which, Mab, shares its orbit with the outermost newly discovered ring. The new rings bring the total number of Uranian rings to 13. In April 2006, images of the new rings from the Keck Observatory yielded the colours of the outer rings: the outermost is blue and the other one red. One hypothesis concerning the outer ring&#x27;s blue colour is that it is composed of minute particles of water ice from the surface of Mab that are small enough to scatter blue light. In contrast, Uranus&#x27;s inner rings appear grey.

Although the Uranian rings are very difficult to directly observe from Earth, advances in digital imaging have allowed several amateur astronomers to successfully photograph the rings with red or infrared filters; telescopes with apertures as small as may be able to detect the rings with proper imaging equipment.

== Exploration ==
Launched in 1977, &quot;Voyager 2&quot; made its closest approach to Uranus on 24 January 1986, coming within of the cloudtops, before continuing its journey to Neptune. The spacecraft studied the structure and chemical composition of Uranus&#x27;s atmosphere, including its unique weather, caused by its extreme axial tilt. It made the first detailed investigations of its five largest moons and discovered 10 new ones. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; examined all nine of the system&#x27;s known rings and discovered two more. It also studied the magnetic field, its irregular structure, its tilt and its unique corkscrew magnetotail caused by Uranus&#x27;s sideways orientation.

No other spacecraft has flown by Uranus since then, though there have been many proposed missions to revisit the Uranus system. The possibility of sending the &quot;Cassini&quot; spacecraft from Saturn to Uranus was evaluated during a mission extension planning phase in 2009, but was ultimately rejected in favour of destroying it in the Saturnian atmosphere, as it would have taken about twenty years to get to the Uranian system after departing Saturn. A Uranus entry probe could use Pioneer Venus Multiprobe heritage and descend to 1–5 atmospheres. A Uranus orbiter and probe was recommended by the 2013–2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey published in 2011; the proposal envisaged launch during 2020–2023 and a 13-year cruise to Uranus. The committee&#x27;s opinion was reaffirmed in 2022, when a Uranus probe/orbiter mission was placed at the highest priority, due to the lack of knowledge about ice giants. Most recently, the CNSA&#x27;s &quot;Tianwen-4&quot; Jupiter orbiter, launching in 2029, is planned to have a subprobe that will detach and get a gravity assist instead of entering orbit, flying by Uranus in March 2045 before heading to interstellar space. China also has plans for a potential &quot;Tianwen-5&quot; that may orbit either Uranus or Neptune that have yet to come to fruition.

<text>The Battle of Ad Decimum took place on September 13, 533 between the armies of the Vandals, commanded by King Gelimer, and the Byzantine Empire, under the command of General Belisarius. This event and events in the following year are sometimes jointly referred to as the Battle of Carthage, one of several battles to bear that name. The Byzantine victory marked the beginning of the end for the Vandals and began the reconquest of the west under the Emperor Justinian I.

== Battle ==

===Prelude===
The Vandal Kingdom in North Africa was ruled by King Hilderic. His reign was noteworthy for the kingdom&#x27;s excellent relations with the Byzantine Empire ruled by Emperor Justinian I. Procopius writes that he was &quot;a very particular friend and guest-friend of Justinian, who had not yet come to the throne&quot;, noting that Hilderic and Justinian exchanged large presents of money to each other. Hilderic allowed a new Chalcedonian bishop to take office in the Vandal capital of Carthage, and many Vandals began to convert to the Chalcedonians, to the alarm of the Vandal nobility. Hilderic rejected the Arian Christianity that most Vandals followed. However, in 531, Hilderic was overthrown by his cousin Gelimer, a popular military commander who had commanded successfully against the Moors. Gelimer began persecuting the non-Arian population, and many fled to the Byzantine Empire. Justinian sent Byzantine general Belisarius to reconquer the former Roman province of North Africa. On Midsummer Day 533 the expedition set off. It consisted of 5,000 Byzantine cavalry and twice as many infantry and some additional units but their number and composition is not named by the primary sources. They travelled in a fleet of 500 transports, escorted by ninety-two dromons. Once the fleet arrived safely in North Africa, the Byzantine army disembarked and marched up the coast to Carthage, the Vandal capital, the ships keeping pace with the army offshore. Contact with the fleet was lost however when it had to sail round Cape Bon.

===Preparation===
Ad Decimum (Latin for &quot;at the tenth [mile post]&quot;), was a marker along the Mediterranean coast road ten Roman miles () south of Carthage. Hearing of the Byzantine landing, Gelimer marched north from his position towards Ad Decimum. He divided his forces, sending 2,000 men under his nephew Gibamund to block one of the three roads to Carthage, the other two converging at Ad Decimum.

Gelimer retained 5,000–6,000 men under his own command while his brother Ammatus approached from the north with 6,000–7,000 troops, Ammatus scouting ahead of his troops in person. At Ad Decimum there was a narrow defile where the Byzantines could be trapped. The Byzantines did not know the layout of the road network and would probably be surprised if an army appeared behind them. When the Byzantines advanced towards Carthage they would most likely try to go through the path blocked by Gibamund who was ordered to charge them. This was supposed to push the Byzantines back into the valley and disorganise them. Gelimer would advance into the valley and attack them from behind.

When Belisarius landed in North Africa he knew the Vandals would move against him before he could reach Carthage. However he did not know the Vandal dispositions so he wanted to gain intelligence about them before giving battle. At the time when Ammatus was scouting the location of the battle, Belisarius found a good spot for a fortified camp roughly four miles from Ad Decimum, leaving his infantry there while he advanced with his cavalry. Belisarius had not ordered the 300-strong contingent of scouts under John the Armenian, or the 600 Huns guarding his left flank to stop so they kept advancing while Belisarius was still with his encamping infantry.

===Battle===
The battle started with two roughly simultaneous engagements between smaller Vandal and Byzantine units.

One of these was between the Byzantine Hun mercenaries and the Vandals of Gibamundus. One of the roughly 600 Huns rode out in front of the rest when encountering the Vandals. Upon seeing this the Vandals stopped in their tracks allowing the Huns to charge and disperse them. They possibly did this because of fear of a trap, being stunned at the bravery of this Hun or being surprised upon seeing Byzantines so far away from the main road. They were also possibly scared of the Huns due to their reputation as great warriors. Thus the 600 Hun mercenaries defeated 2,000 Vandals and killed Gibamundus in combat.

At roughly the same time Ammatus made an error that would cost him his life. Ammatus was scouting the battlefield with just a few men when he encountered the much stronger Byzantine vanguard under John, and was killed in the ensuing combat. The rest of Ammatus&#x27; forces moved out of Carthage in small bands of at most thirty men, thinly stretching themselves over the road between Carthage and the battlefield. As these small groups in turn encountered the Byzantines they were quickly defeated and fled.

By now a Byzantine contingent under a man called Solomon, sent to contact John, reached the scene where battle had taken place. They questioned local inhabitants to what took place there. Soon after Gelimer&#x27;s main force came into sight, Solomon promptly informed Belisarius of the situation. Seeing the importance of a nearby hill, an ideal location for a camp, some of Gelimer&#x27;s and Solomon&#x27;s troops began to skirmish. The Byzantines had to attack uphill and against superior numbers quickly leading to defeat. The retreating Byzantines encountered 800 more Byzantine troops and reformed. Upon being informed of the current situation however, these 800 retreated to the safety of Belisarius’ main force. Reforming these troops and listening to their reports, Belisarius noticed that many Vandals had already been routed while the rest had halted. Rightly believing he outnumbered the Vandals, Belisarius moved rapidly on Ad Decimum. Procopius believed that if Gelimer had pursued the fleeing Byzantines he would have completely overrun Belisarius&#x27; unsuspecting contingent, while if he would have moved towards Carthage he would have cut the Byzantine army off from John&#x27;s advance guard. The second option would have put Gelimer in a position to attack the weaker and unsuspecting Byzantine fleet from Carthage, and either outcome could have been disastrous for the Byzantines. Seeing only a few dead troops around the body of his brother Ammatas, Gelimer became convinced that the Byzantine troops led by Solomon had been only a small rear guard, and that an overwhelming attack by a much larger force earlier in the battle had forced Ammatas&#x27; troops to abandon their fallen commander. In the clear space around Carthage the Vandals would not have had surprise on their side and the outcome of engagement would be more in doubt, and as such he did not try to pursue the “overwhelming” Byzantine force. Instead, Gelimer elected to set up camp at the favorable position he had captured, gather intelligence, and wait for reinforcements from Sardinia to arrive rather than engage Belisarius (at this point still extremely vulnerable), who moved towards Carthage.

When Belisarius attacked the unprepared Vandals from an unexpected direction, he quickly routed the Vandals who had fled away from Carthage in order to avoid being trapped between Belisarius and a potential other Byzantine force (one under John indeed being present on that road).

After this battle Carthage was left relatively lightly defended and was captured by the Byzantines.
===Aftermath===
Belisarius camped near the site of the battle, not wanting to be too close to the city at night. The next day he marched on the city, with his wife 
Antonina at his side, ordering his men not to kill or enslave the population (as was normal practice at the time) because he stated the people were actually Roman citizens under Vandal rule. They found the gates to the city open, and the army was generally welcomed. Belisarius went straight to the palace and sat on the throne of the Vandal King. He then set about rebuilding the fortifications of the city, and his fleet sought shelter in the Lake of Tunis, five miles (8 km) south of Carthage.

After a second defeat at the Battle of Tricamarum later in the year, the Vandal Kingdom was all but ended.

<text>A respirometer is a device used to measure the rate of respiration of a living organism by measuring its rate of exchange of oxygen and/or carbon dioxide. They allow investigation into how factors such as age, or chemicals affect the rate of respiration. Respirometers are designed to measure respiration either on the level of a whole animal or plant or on the cellular level. These fields are covered by whole animal and cellular (or mitochondrial) respirometry, respectively.

A simple whole plant respirometer designed to measure oxygen uptake or CO2 release consists of a sealed container with the living specimen together with a substance to absorb the carbon dioxide given off during respiration, such as soda lime pellets or cotton wads soaked with potassium hydroxide. The oxygen uptake is detected by manometry. Typically, a U-tube manometer is used, which directly shows the pressure difference between the container and the atmosphere. As an organism takes up O2, it generates a proportionate quantity of CO2 (see respiratory quotient), but all the CO2 is absorbed by the soda lime. Therefore, all of the drop of pressure in the chamber can be attributed to the drop of O2 partial pressure in the container. The rate of change gives a direct and reasonably accurate reading for the organism&#x27;s rate of respiration.

As changes in temperature or pressure can also affect the displacement of the manometric fluid, a second respirometer identical to the first except with a dead specimen (or something with the same mass as the specimen in place of the organism) is sometimes set up. Subtracting the displacement of the second respirometer from the first allows for control of these factors.

The set up of modern respirometers is described in more detail under respirometry. A respirometer may also be called an oxygraph. Suppliers for whole animal respirometers are e.g. Sable Systems, Respirometer Systems and Applications, Qubit Systems, Eco-environment, Bio-technology, or Challenge Technology; for mitochondrial respirometers, Oroboros Instruments, Hansatech Instruments, or YSI.

<doc id="44481" wikidata="Q484924" url="?curid=44481" title="Tuff">
<text>Tuff is a type of rock made of volcanic ash ejected from a vent during a volcanic eruption. Following ejection and deposition, the ash is lithified into a solid rock. Rock that contains greater than 75% ash is considered tuff, while rock containing 25% to 75% ash is described as tuffaceous (for example, &quot;tuffaceous sandstone&quot;). A pyroclastic rock containing 25–75% volcanic bombs and/or volcanic blocks is called tuff breccia. Tuff composed of sandy volcanic material can be referred to as volcanic sandstone.

Tuff is a relatively soft rock, so it has been used for construction since ancient times. Because it is common in Italy, the Romans used it often for construction. The Rapa Nui people used it to make most of the &quot;moai&quot; statues on Easter Island.

Tuff can be classified as either igneous or sedimentary rock. It is usually studied in the context of igneous petrology, although it is sometimes described using sedimentological terms.

Tuff is often erroneously called tufa in guidebooks and in television programs but tufa is a form of travertine.

==Volcanic Ash==
The material that is expelled in a volcanic eruption can be classified into three types:

# Volcanic gases, a mixture made mostly of steam, carbon dioxide, and a sulfur compound (either sulfur dioxide, SO2, or hydrogen sulfide, H2S, depending on the temperature)
# Lava, the name of magma when it emerges and flows over the surface
# Tephra, particles of solid material of all shapes and sizes ejected and thrown through the air

Tephra is made when magma inside the volcano is blown apart by the rapid expansion of hot volcanic gases. Magma commonly explodes as the gas dissolved in it comes out of solution as the pressure decreases when it flows to the surface. These violent explosions produce particles of material that can then fly from the volcano. Solid particles smaller than 2 mm in diameter (sand-sized or smaller) are called volcanic ash.

Volcanic ash is further divided into fine ash, with particle sizes smaller than 0.0625 mm in diameter, and coarse ash, with particle sizes between 0.0625 mm and 2 mm in diameter. Tuff is correspondingly divided into coarse tuff (coarse ash tuff) and fine tuff (fine ash tuff or dust tuff). Consolidated tephra composed mostly of coarser particles is called lapillistone (particles 2 mm to 64 mm in diameter) or agglomerate or pyroclastic breccia (particles over 64 mm in diameter) rather than tuff.

Volcanic ash can vary greatly in composition, and so tuffs are further classified by the composition of the ash from which they formed. Ash from high-silica volcanism, particularly in ash flows, consists mainly of shards of volcanic glass, and tuff formed predominantly from glass shards is described as vitric tuff. The glass shards are typically either irregular in shape or are roughly triangular with convex sides. They are the shattered walls of countless small bubbles that formed in the magma as dissolved gases rapidly came out of solution.

Tuffs formed from ash consisting predominantly of individual crystals are described as crystal tuffs, while those formed from ash consisting predominantly of pulverized rock fragments are described as lithic tuffs. 

The chemical composition of volcanic ash reflects the entire range of volcanic rock chemistry, from high-silica rhyolitic ash to low-silica basaltic ash, and tuffs are likewise described as rhyolitic, andesitic, basaltic, and so on.

==Transport and lithification==
The most straightforward way for volcanic ash to move away from the vent is as ash clouds that are part of an eruption column. These fall to the surface as &quot;fallout&quot; deposits that are characteristically well-sorted and tend to form a blanket of uniform thickness across terrain. Column collapse results in a more spectacular and destructive form of transport, which takes the form of pyroclastic flows and surges that characteristically are poorly sorted and pool in low terrain. Surge deposits sometimes show sedimentary structures typical of high-velocity flow, such as dunes and antidunes. Volcanic ash already deposited on the surface can be transported as mud flows (lahars) when mingled with water from rainfall or through eruption into a body of water or ice.

Particles of volcanic ash that are sufficiently hot will weld together after settling to the surface, producing a welded tuff. Welding requires temperatures in excess of . If the rock contains scattered, pea-sized fragments or fiamme in it, it is called a welded lapilli tuff. Welded tuffs (and welded lapilli tuffs) can be of fallout origin, or deposited from ash flows, as in the case of ignimbrites. During welding, the glass shards and pumice fragments adhere together (necking at point contacts), deform, and compact together, resulting in a eutaxitic fabric. Welded tuff is commonly rhyolitic in composition, but examples of all compositions are known.

A sequence of ash flows may consist of multiple &quot;cooling units&quot;. These can be distinguished by the degree of welding. The base of a cooling unit is typically unwelded due to chilling from the underlying cold surface, and the degree of welding and of secondary reactions from fluids in the flow increases upwards towards the center of the flow. Welding decreases towards the top of the cooling unit, where the unit cools more rapidly. The intensity of welding may also decrease towards areas in which the deposit is thinner, and with distance from source.

Cooler pyroclastic flows are unwelded and the ash sheets deposited by them are relatively unconsolidated. However, cooled volcanic ash can quickly become lithified because it usually has a high content of volcanic glass. This is a thermodynamically unstable material that reacts rapidly with ground water or sea water, which leaches alkali metals and calcium from the glass. New minerals, such as zeolites, clays, and calcite, crystallize from the dissolved substances and cement the tuff.

Tuffs are further classified by their depositional environment, such as lacustrine tuff, subaerial tuff, or submarine tuff, or by the mechanism by which the ash was transported, such as fallout tuff or ash flow tuff. Reworked tuffs, formed by erosion and redeposition of ash deposits, are usually described by the transport agent, such as aeolian tuff or fluvial tuff.

==Occurrences==
Tuffs have the potential to be deposited wherever explosive volcanism takes place, and so have a wide distribution in location and age.

===High-silica volcanism===
Rhyolite tuffs contain pumiceous, glassy fragments and small scoriae with quartz, alkali feldspar, biotite, etc. Iceland, Lipari, Hungary, the Basin and Range of the American southwest, and New Zealand are among the areas where such tuffs are prominent. In the ancient rocks of Wales, Charnwood, etc., similar tuffs are known, but in all cases, they are greatly changed by silicification (which has filled them with opal, chalcedony, and quartz) and by devitrification. The frequent presence of rounded corroded quartz crystals, such as occur in rhyolitic lavas, helps to demonstrate their real nature.

Welded ignimbrites can be highly voluminous, such as the Lava Creek Tuff erupted from Yellowstone Caldera in Wyoming 631,000 years ago. This tuff had an original volume of at least . Lava Creek tuff is known to be at least 1000 times as large as the deposits of the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens, and it had a Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) of 8, greater than any eruption known in the last 10,000 years. Ash flow tuffs cover of the North Island of New Zealand and about of Nevada. Ash flow tuffs are the only volcanic product with volumes rivaling those of flood basalts.

The Tioga Bentonite of the northeastern United States varies in composition from crystal tuff to tuffaceous shale. It was deposited as ash carried by wind that fell out over the sea and settled to the bottom. It is Devonian in age and likely came from a vent in central Virginia, where the tuff reaches its maximum thickness of about .

===Alkaline volcanism===
Trachyte tuffs contain little or no quartz, but much sanidine or anorthoclase and sometimes oligoclase feldspar, with occasional biotite, augite, and hornblende. In weathering, they often change to soft red or yellow claystones, rich in kaolin with secondary quartz. Recent trachyte tuffs are found on the Rhine (at Siebengebirge), in Ischia and near Naples. Trachyte-carbonatite tuffs have been identified in the East African Rift. Alkaline crystal tuffs have been reported from Rio de Janeiro.

===Intermediate volcanism===
Andesitic tuffs are exceedingly common. They occur along the whole chain of the Cordilleras and Andes, in the West Indies, New Zealand, Japan, etc. In the Lake District, North Wales, Lorne, the Pentland Hills, the Cheviots, and many other districts of Great Britain, ancient rocks of exactly similar nature are abundant. In color, they are red or brown; their scoriae fragments are of all sizes from huge blocks down to minute granular dust. The cavities are filled with many secondary minerals, such as calcite, chlorite, quartz, epidote, or chalcedony; in microscopic sections, though, the nature of the original lava can nearly always be made out from the shapes and properties of the little crystals which occur in the decomposed glassy base. Even in the smallest details, these ancient tuffs have a complete resemblance to the modern ash beds of Cotopaxi, Krakatoa, and Mont Pelé.

===Mafic volcanism===

Mafic volcanism typically takes the form of Hawaiian eruptions that are nonexplosive and produce little ash. However, interaction between basaltic magma and groundwater or sea water results in hydromagmatic explosions that produce abundant ash. These deposit ash cones that subsequently can become cemented into tuff cones. Diamond Head, Hawaii, is an example of a tuff cone, as is the island of Ka&#x27;ula. The glassy basaltic ash produced in such eruptions rapidly alters to palagonite as part of the process of lithification. 

Although conventional mafic volcanism produce little ash, such ash as is formed may accumulate locally as significant deposits. An example is the Pahala ash of Hawaii island, which locally is as thick as . These deposits also rapidly alter to palagonite, and eventually weather to laterite. 

Basaltic tuffs are also found in Skye, Mull, Antrim, and other places, where Paleogene volcanic rocks are found; in Scotland, Derbyshire, and Ireland among the Carboniferous strata, and among the still older rocks of the Lake District, the southern uplands of Scotland, and Wales. They are black, dark green, or red in colour; vary greatly in coarseness, some being full of round spongy bombs a foot or more in diameter; and being often submarine, may contain shale, sandstone, grit, and other sedimentary material, and are occasionally fossiliferous. Recent basaltic tuffs are found in Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Jan Mayen, Sicily, the Hawaiian Islands, Samoa, etc. When weathered, they are filled with calcite, chlorite, serpentine, and especially where the lavas contain nepheline or leucite, are often rich in zeolites, such as analcite, prehnite, natrolite, scolecite, chabazite, heulandite, etc.

===Ultramafic volcanism===
Ultramafic tuffs are extremely rare; their characteristic is the abundance of olivine or serpentine and the scarcity or absence of feldspar and quartz.

====Kimberlites====
Occurrences of ultramafic tuff include surface deposits of kimberlite at maars in the diamond-fields of southern Africa and other regions. The principal variety of kimberlite is a dark bluish-green, serpentine-rich breccia (blue-ground) which, when thoroughly oxidized and weathered, becomes a friable brown or yellow mass (the &quot;yellow-ground&quot;). These breccias were emplaced as gas–solid mixtures and are typically preserved and mined in diatremes that form intrusive pipe-like structures. At depth, some kimberlite breccias grade into root zones of dikes made of unfragmented rock. At the surface, ultramafic tuffs may occur in maar deposits. Because kimberlites are the most common igneous source of diamonds, the transitions from maar to diatreme to root-zone dikes have been studied in detail. Diatreme-facies kimberlite is more properly called an ultramafic breccia rather than a tuff.

====Komatiites====
Komatiite tuffs are found, for example, in the greenstone belts of Canada and South Africa.

===Folding and metamorphism===
In course of time, changes other than weathering may overtake tuff deposits. Sometimes, they are involved in folding and become sheared and cleaved. Many of the green slates of the English Lake District are finely cleaved ashes. In Charnwood Forest also, the tuffs are slaty and cleaved. The green color is due to the large development of chlorite. Among the crystalline schists of many regions, green beds or green schists occur, which consist of quartz, hornblende, chlorite or biotite, iron oxides, feldspar, etc., and are probably recrystallized or metamorphosed tuffs. They often accompany masses of epidiorite and hornblende – schists which are the corresponding lavas and sills. Some chlorite-schists also are probably altered beds of volcanic tuff. The &quot;Schalsteins&quot; of Devon and Germany include many cleaved and partly recrystallized ash-beds, some of which still retain their fragmental structure, though their lapilli are flattened and drawn out. Their steam cavities are usually filled with calcite, but sometimes with quartz. The more completely altered forms of these rocks are platy, green chloritic schists; in these, however, structures indicating their original volcanic nature only sparingly occur. These are intermediate stages between cleaved tuffs and crystalline schists.

==Importance==
The primary economic value of tuff is as a building material. In the ancient world, tuff&#x27;s relative softness meant that it was commonly used for construction where it was available. 

===Italy===
Tuff is common in Italy, and the Romans used it for many buildings and bridges. For example, the whole port of the island of Ventotene (still in use), was carved from tuff. The Servian Wall, built to defend the city of Rome in the fourth century BC, is also built almost entirely from tuff. The Romans also cut tuff into small, rectangular stones that they used to create walls in a pattern known as &quot;opus reticulatum&quot;.

Peperino has been used in Rome and Naples as a building stone, is a trachyte tuff. Pozzolana also is a decomposed tuff, but of basic character, originally obtained near Naples and used as a cement, but this name is now applied to a number of substances not always of identical character. In the historical architecture of Naples, Neapolitan yellow tuff is the most used building material. Piperno ignimbrite tuff was also used widely in Naples and Campania.

===Germany===
In the Eifel region of Germany, a trachytic, pumiceous tuff called trass has been extensively worked as a hydraulic mortar. Tuff of the Eifel region of Germany has been widely used for construction of railroad stations and other buildings in Frankfurt, Hamburg, and other large cities. Construction using the &quot;Rochlitz Porphyr&quot;, can be seen in the Mannerist-style sculpted portal outside the chapel entrance in Colditz Castle. The trade name &quot;Rochlitz Porphyr&quot; is the traditional designation for a dimension stone of Saxony with an architectural history over 1,000 years in Germany. The quarries are located near Rochlitz.

===United States===
Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, a U.S. Department of Energy terminal storage facility for spent nuclear reactor and other radioactive waste, is in tuff and ignimbrite in the Basin and Range Province in Nevada. In Napa Valley and Sonoma Valley, California, areas made of tuff are routinely excavated for storage of wine barrels.

===Rapa Nui===
Tuff from Rano Raraku was used by the Rapa Nui people of Easter Island to make the vast majority of their famous moai statues.

===Armenia===
Tuff is used extensively in Armenia and Armenian architecture. It is the dominant type of stone used in construction in Armenia&#x27;s capital Yerevan, Gyumri, Armenia&#x27;s second largest city, and Ani, the country&#x27;s medieval capital, now in Turkey. A small village in Armenia was renamed Tufashen (literally &quot;village of tuff&quot;) in 1946.

===Tephrochronology===

Tuffs are deposited geologically instantaneously and often over a large region. This makes them highly useful as time-stratigraphic markers. The use of tuffs and other tephra deposits in this manner is known as tephrochronology and is particularly useful for Quaternary chronostratigraphy. Individual tuff beds can be &quot;fingerprinted&quot; by their chemical composition and phenocryst assemblages. Absolute ages for tuff beds can be determined by K-Ar, Ar-Ar, or carbon-14 dating. Zircon grains found in many tuffs are highly durable and can survive even metamorphism of the host tuff to schist, allowing absolute ages to be assigned to ancient metamorphic rocks. For example, dating of zircons in a metamorphosed tuff bed in the Pilar Formation provided some of the first evidence for the Picuris orogeny.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;tuff&quot; is derived from the Italian &quot;tufo&quot;.

<text>David Fabricius (9 March 1564 – 7 May 1617) was a German pastor who made two major discoveries in the early days of telescopic astronomy, jointly with his eldest son, Johannes Fabricius (1587–1615).

David Fabricius (Latinization of his proper name &quot;David Faber&quot;, or &quot;David Goldschmidt&quot;; possibly Hebrew) was born at Esens, studied at the University of Helmstedt starting in 1583 and served as pastor for small towns near his birthplace in Frisia (now northwest Germany and northeast Netherlands), at Resterhafe near Dornum in 1584 and at Osteel in 1603. As was common for Protestant ministers of the day, he dabbled in science: his particular interest was astronomy. Fabricius corresponded with astronomer Johannes Kepler.

== Scientific work ==
Fabricius discovered the first known periodic variable star (as opposed to cataclysmic variables, such as novas and supernovas), Mira, in August 1596. At first he believed it to be &quot;just&quot; another nova, as the whole concept of a recurring variable did not exist at the time. When he saw Mira brighten again in 1609, however, it became clear that a new kind of object had been discovered in the sky.

Two years later, his son Johannes Fabricius (1587–1615) returned from university in the Netherlands with telescopes that they turned on the Sun. Despite the difficulties of observing the Sun directly, they noted the existence of sunspots, the first confirmed instance of their observation (though unclear statements in East Asian annals suggest that Chinese astronomers may have discovered them with the naked eye previously, and Fabricius may have noticed them himself without a telescope a few years before). The pair soon invented camera obscura telescopy so as to save their eyes and get a better view of the solar disk, and observed that the spots moved. They would appear on the eastern edge of the disk, steadily move to the western edge, disappear, then reappear at the east again after the passage of the same amount of time that it had taken for it to cross the disk in the first place. This suggested that the Sun rotated on its axis, which had been postulated before but never backed up with evidence. Johannes then published &quot;Maculis in Sole Observatis, et Apparente earum cum Sole Conversione Narratio&quot; (&quot;Narration on Spots Observed on the Sun and their Apparent Rotation with the Sun&quot;) in June 1611. Unfortunately, after Johannes Fabricius&#x27; early death at the age of 29, the book remained obscure and was eclipsed by the independent discoveries of and publications about sunspots by Christoph Scheiner and Galileo Galilei, few months later.

== Death ==
After Fabricius denounced a local goose thief from the pulpit at Osteel in 1617, the accused man struck him on the head with a shovel and killed him.

==Legacy==
Copies of a map he made of Frisia in 1589 are also still extant. He is also name-checked in Jules Verne&#x27;s 1865 novel &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; as someone who claimed to have seen lunar inhabitants through his telescope, though that particular fact is merely part of Verne&#x27;s fiction. The large (79-kilometer) crater Fabricius in the Moon&#x27;s southern hemisphere is named after David Fabricius. In 1895 a monument was erected to his memory in the churchyard at Osteel where he was pastor from 1603 until 1617.

<text>Melvin Lawrence DeFleur (April 27, 1923 – February 13, 2017) was a professor and scholar in the field of communications. His initial field of study was social sciences.

==Biography==
Melvin Lawrence DeFleur was born in Portland, Oregon on April 27, 1923. DeFleur received his Ph.D. in social psychology from the University of Washington in 1954. His thesis, &quot;Experimental studies of stimulus response relationships in leaflet communication&quot;, drew from sociology, psychology, and communication, to study how information diffused through American communities.

He has taught at Indiana University (1954–1963), the University of Kentucky (1963–1967), Washington State University (1967–1976), the University of New Mexico (1976–1980), the University of Miami (1981–1985), Syracuse University (1987–1994) and the University of Washington before taking his last position as professor of communication at Boston University&#x27;s Department of Mass Communication, Advertising and Public Relations. In addition, he was a Fulbright Professor to Argentina twice: and was affiliated with the Argentine Sociological Society and the Ibero-Interamerican Sociological Society, for which he served as secretary general.

DeFleur was married to Margaret DeFleur, Associate Dean for Graduate Studies and Research.

DeFleur died on February 13, 2017, aged 93.

==Academic work==
His early work owes a debt to Stuart C. Dodd and George A. Lundberg, sociologists and psychologists. This group applied quantitative measure, statistical data analyses, and descriptive mathematical models used in the physical sciences to the development of sociology.

Another force affected his work: He began his career when the memories of World War II were fresh, and entered into the academic world when the Cold War played a critical role in shaping the United States&#x27; political, economic and social atmosphere. Social psychology research added to the knowledge that the United States government and military felt they needed for operating in a new world dynamic (East v. West). For example, the leafleting processes studied by Project Revere were an obvious way to communicate information to a displaced, captive, or isolated population.

He maintained a sociological focus during the early 1970s, co-writing an introductory sociology textbook that went into several editions. He co-authored a study of discrimination in university hiring practices, particularly in sociology departments (Wolfe et al., 1973), again with a strong emphasis on statistics and survey methods. However, his focus shifted. With the spread of television, he began to study the mass media. Specifically, he researched the effect of television on children&#x27;s knowledge of occupational roles, and on the factors that influence the content and output of the American broadcasting systems. He and others established a formal definition of social expectations theory, applied to a model to predict that watching television attunes a viewer to social organization patterns of various groups, even if they &quot;have never been members or never will be&quot;. Other works examined the potential relationships forged by mass media between the perception of social problems and their portrayal by the media. He wrote of his suggestion of a cultural norms theory in 1970, an idea that, in his estimation, &quot;provided the foundation for the more comprehensive social expectations theory&quot;.

In the 1970s and 1980s he continued studies on news diffusion. In reviewing some major studies (DeFleur, 1988), he found that despite emerging technology, word of mouth is still important, and major events that concern a broader population will travel further and faster. His research lead to the creation of the Media Systems Dependency Theory with Sandra Ball-Rokeach in 1976.

DeFleur cites his idea (formed with Timothy Plax) of the language-shaping function of the media as one of four theories on how media shape messages, and what that means for social conduct (DeFleur &amp; Ball-Rokeach, 1989). The other three are the meaning-construction function of the press; cultivation theory; the agenda setting function of the press. His transition from &quot;pure&quot; social psychology to mass communication mirrors the growth of this field. His theories, are widely cited in mass communication studies and in general theoretical surveys.

He is on the executive board of the Center for Global Media Studies at Washington State University, an organization whose motto, &quot;Global Media Cover the World ... We Cover Global Media,&quot; connects with the focus of his recent work studying the accuracy of audience recall of news media in a cross-cultural vein (Faccoro &amp; DeFleur, 1993).

<text>The Independent Media Center, better known as Indymedia, is an open publishing network of activist journalist collectives that report on political and social issues. Following beginnings during the 1999 Carnival Against Capital and 1999 Seattle WTO protests, Indymedia became closely associated with the global justice movement. The Indymedia network extended internationally in the early 2000s with volunteer-run centers that shared software and a common format with a newswire and columns. Police raided several centers and seized computer equipment. The centers declined in the 2010s with the waning of the global justice movement.

== Content and distribution ==

Indymedia is a website for citizen journalism that promotes activism and counters mainstream media news and commentary perspectives. Indymedia originated from protests against the concentrated ownership and perceived biases in corporate media reporting. The first Indymedia node, attached to the Seattle anti-corporate globalization protests, was seen by activists as an alternative news source to that of the corporate media, which they accused of only showing violence and confrontation, and portraying all protesters negatively. Indymedia initially covered protests between 1999 and 2001. As protests began to wane, Indymedia covered global social justice movements, such as opposition to the war in Iraq. Indymedia was purported to be the first network on-the-scene in reporting the 2008 Greek riots and the resistance towards the 2009 Honduran coup. The network also has a focus in covering the social justice campaigns of students, Indigenous people, immigrants, and peace activists. A slogan was &quot;Don&#x27;t Hate the Media, Become the Media!&quot;

Active, the software used as the basis for the first Indymedia center websites, was written by activists in Sydney. It went live in January 1999 and featured open publishing, calendars, events and contacts. Indymedia also ran a global radio project which aggregated audio RSS feeds from around the world.

==History==
The origins of Indymedia can be traced to the global justice protest Carnival Against Capital, which took place in over forty countries on June 18, 1999. In late November 1999, the first dedicated Indymedia project was ready to cover the 1999 Seattle WTO protests. The first post was made on November 24. It read:
When the protests began, a hundred videographers were on the streets filming, joined by photographers and journalists, all working as volunteers.

After Seattle, local, autonomous collectives formed. Local sociopolitical context determined each individual center&#x27;s focus. However, it was a core theme that centers would have both an open publishing structure to which anyone could contribute and an open archive. Centers tended to be set up in response to meetings of groups such as the World Bank or G8, to world forum events, or to party conventions, such as Democrat or Republican meetings in the US. By 2002, there were 90 Indymedia websites, mainly in the US, Canada and Western Europe but also Australia, New Zealand and Latin America. The number of centers continued growing, especially in Europe, reaching 142 in 2004 and 175 by 2010.

The Indymedia movement reached its peak in the mid-2000s. Centers in the United States began to atrophy around 2008, and by 2014, the global network had declined significantly, with the number of active sites down to 68. A number of reasons for the decline have been put forward. In February 2013, Ceasefire magazine had noted a decline in the use of Nottingham Indymedia, stating that activist usage of commercial social media had increased. The poverty of activist collectives to invest in resources was contrasted with the massive investments made by corporations such as Facebook and Twitter. In an article published by the journal &quot;Convergence&quot; Eva Giraud summarised some of the different arguments that had been made by academics and activists, which included informal hierarchy, bureaucracy, security issues including IP address logging, lack of regional engagement, lack of class politics, increase in web 2.0 social media use, website underdevelopment, decline in volunteers and decline in the global justice movement. Corporate Watch saw the rise of social media sites and the normalization of &#x27;open publishing&#x27; as recommodifying Indymedia&#x27;s key innovations for the cultural industry.

In a 2019 article published on occasion of Indymedia&#x27;s 20th anniversary, April Glaser suggested that factors such as volunteer burnout, lack of resources, lack of centralized accountability, lack of leadership development, and the waning of the anti-globalization movement all contributed to the decline of Indymedia.

==By region==
===United Kingdom===

Police seized servers in the UK in June 2005. An anonymous post on the Bristol Indymedia server came to police attention for suggesting an &quot;action&quot; against a freight train carrying new cars as part of a protest against cars and climate change in the run up to that year&#x27;s Gleneagles G8 summit. A member of the Bristol Indymedia group was arrested. Indymedia was supported in this matter by the National Union of Journalists and Liberty.

In August 2014, Bristol Indymedia&#x27;s servers were again seized by police after a string of attacks in the Bristol area were claimed on the Indymedia service, including a communique signed by Informal Anarchist Federation claiming the successful arson of a police firearms training centre. Bristol Indymedia stated that they would not cooperate with the authorities and that they &quot;do not intend to voluntarily hand over information to the police as they have requested&quot;.

===United States===
On October 7, 2004, the Federal Bureau Investigation took possession of several server hard drives used by a number of IMCs and hosted by U.S.-based Rackspace Managed Hosting. The servers in question were located in the United Kingdom and managed by the British arm of Rackspace, but some 20 mainly European IMC websites were affected, and several unrelated websites were affected, including the website of a Linux distribution. Some, but not all, of the legal documents relating to the confiscation of the servers were unsealed by a Texas district court in August 2005, following legal action by the Electronic Frontier Foundation. The documents revealed that the only action requested by the government was to surrender server log files.

The move was condemned by the International Federation of Journalists, who stated that, &quot;The way this has been done smacks more of intimidation of legitimate journalistic inquiry than crime-busting&quot; and called for an investigation. European civil liberties organization Statewatch and the World Association of Community Radio Broadcasters (AMARC) also voiced criticism. EFF attorney Kurt Opsahl compared the case with &quot;Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service&quot;.

New York–based journalist and Indymedia volunteer Bradley Roland Will was killed in October 2006 along with two Mexican protesters in the city of Oaxaca. People had been demonstrating in the city since May as part of an uprising prompted by a teachers strike. Reporters Without Borders condemned the actions of the Mexican government in allowing the accused gunmen to go free.

On January 30, 2009, one of the system administrators of the server that hosts indymedia.us received a grand jury subpoena from the Southern District of Indiana federal court. The subpoena asked the administrator to provide all &quot;IP addresses, times, and any other identifying information&quot; for every visitor to the site on June 25, 2008. The subpoena also included a gag order that stated that the recipient is &quot;not to disclose the existence of this request unless authorized by the Assistant U.S. Attorney.&quot; The administrator of indymedia.us could not have provided the information because Indymedia sites generally do not keep IP address logs. The Electronic Frontier Foundation determined that there was no legal basis for the gag order, and that the subpoena request &quot;violated the SCA&#x27;s restrictions on what types of data the government could obtain using a subpoena.&quot; Under Justice Department guidelines, subpoenas to news media must have the authorization of the attorney general. According to a CBS News blog, the subpoena of indymedia.us was never submitted to the Attorney General for review. On February 25, 2009, a United States Attorney sent a letter to an attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation stating that the subpoena had been withdrawn.

===Europe===

At the 2001 G8 summit in Genoa, Italian police assaulted Indymedia journalists at the Armando Diaz School where Indymedia had set up a temporary office and radio station. Twenty-nine police officers were indicted for beating people, planting evidence and wrongful arrest during the night-time raid. Thirteen were convicted.

In the aftermath of the 2017 G20 Hamburg summit protests, the German Federal Ministry of the Interior, Building and Community banned a chapter of the network called Linksunten. This had been set up in 2008, in southwestern Germany. The ministry described the network as &quot;the central communications platform among far-left extremists prone to violence&quot; and stated that it was used to spread information about violent protest tactics. German internet service providers were ordered to block communication to the website, on which police were referred to as &quot;pigs&quot; and &quot;murderers&quot; and instructions for making Molotov cocktails could be found. The German police also raided the home addresses of several activists in the Baden-Württemberg region, seizing computers and weapons.

<text>Charles Hoy Fort (August 6, 1874 – May 3, 1932) was an American writer and researcher who specialized in anomalous phenomena. The terms &quot;Fortean&quot; and &quot;Forteana&quot; are sometimes used to characterize various such phenomena. Fort&#x27;s books sold well and are still in print. His work continues to inspire admirers, who refer to themselves as &quot;Forteans&quot;, and has influenced some aspects of science fiction.

Fort&#x27;s collections of scientific anomalies, including &quot;The Book of the Damned&quot; (1919), influenced numerous science-fiction writers with their skepticism and as sources of ideas. &quot;Fortean&quot; phenomena are events which seem to challenge the boundaries of accepted scientific knowledge, and the &quot;Fortean Times&quot; (founded as &quot;The News&quot; in 1973 and renamed in 1976) investigates such phenomena.

==Biography==

Fort was born in Albany, New York, in 1874, of Dutch ancestry. His father, a grocer, was an authoritarian, and in his unpublished autobiography &quot;Many Parts,&quot; Fort mentions the physical abuse he endured from his father. Fort&#x27;s biographer, Damon Knight, suggested that his distrust of authority began in his treatment as a child. Fort developed a strong sense of independence during his early years.

As a young adult, Fort wanted to be a naturalist, collecting sea shells, minerals, and birds. Although Fort was described as curious and intelligent, he was not a good student. An autodidact, his considerable knowledge of the world was mainly due to his extensive personal reading.

At age 18, Fort left New York to embark on a world tour to &quot;put some capital in the bank of experience&quot;. He travelled through the western United States, Scotland, and England, until becoming ill in Southern Africa. When he returned home, he was nursed by Anna Filing, whom he had known since childhood. They were married on October 26, 1896, at an Episcopal church. For a few years, the newly married couple lived in poverty in the Bronx while Fort tried to earn a living writing stories for newspapers and magazines. In 1906, he began to collect accounts of anomalies.

===Career as a full-time writer===

His uncle Frank A. Fort died in 1916, and a modest inheritance gave Fort enough money to quit his various day jobs and to write full-time. In 1917, Fort&#x27;s brother Clarence died; his portion of the same inheritance was divided between Fort and his other brother, Raymond.

Fort&#x27;s experience as a journalist, coupled with his wit and contrarian nature, prepared him for his real-life work, ridiculing the pretensions of scientific positivism and the tendency of journalists and editors of newspapers and scientific journals to rationalize.

Fort wrote 10 novels, although only one, &quot;The Outcast Manufacturers&quot; (1909), a tenement tale, was published. Reviews were mostly positive, but it was unsuccessful commercially. During 1915, Fort began to write two books, titled &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, the first dealing with the idea that beings on Mars were controlling events on Earth, and the second with the postulation of a sinister civilization extant at the South Pole. These books caught the attention of writer Theodore Dreiser, who tried to get them published, but to no avail. Discouraged, Fort burnt the manuscripts, but soon began work on the book that would change the course of his life, &quot;The Book of the Damned&quot; (1919), which Dreiser helped to get published. The title referred to &quot;damned&quot; data that Fort collected, phenomena for which science could not account, and that was thus rejected or ignored.

Fort and Anna lived intermittently in London between 1920 and 1928, so Fort could carry out research in the Reading Room of the British Museum. Fort lived most of his life in the Bronx. He was, like his wife, fond of movies, and often took her from their Ryer Avenue apartment to a movie theater nearby, stopping at an adjacent newsstand for an arm full of various newspapers. Fort frequented the parks near the Bronx, where he sifted through piles of clippings. He often rode the subway down to the main Public Library on Fifth Avenue, where he spent many hours reading scientific journals, newspapers, and periodicals from around the world. Fort also had literary friends who gathered at various apartments, including his own, to drink and talk.

===Following===

Fort was pleasantly surprised to find himself the subject of a cult following. Talk arose of the formation of a formal organization to study the type of odd events related by his books. Jerome Clark writes, &quot;Fort himself, who did nothing to encourage any of this, found the idea hilarious. Yet he faithfully corresponded with his readers, some of whom had taken to investigating reports of anomalous phenomena and sending their findings to Fort&quot;.

=== Death ===
Suffering from poor health and failing eyesight, Fort distrusted doctors and did not seek medical help for his worsening health. Rather, he emphasized completing &quot;Wild Talents&quot;.

After he collapsed on May 3, 1932, Fort was rushed to Royal Hospital. Later that same day, Fort&#x27;s publisher visited him to show him the advance copies of &quot;Wild Talents&quot;. Fort died only hours afterward, probably of leukemia. He was interred in the Fort family plot in Albany, New York.

==Fort and the unexplained==

===Overview===
For more than 30 years, Fort visited libraries in New York City and London, assiduously reading scientific journals, newspapers, and magazines, collecting notes on phenomena that were not explained well by the accepted theories and beliefs of the time.

Fort took thousands of notes during his lifetime. In his undated short story &quot;The Giant, the Insect and The Philanthropic-looking Old Gentleman&quot; (first published by the International Fortean Organization in issue No. 70 of the &quot;INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown&quot;), Fort spoke of having often toyed with the idea of burning a collection of some 48,000 notes, and of one day letting &quot;several&quot; notes be blown away by the wind because he couldn&#x27;t be bothered to save them (they were supposedly returned to him by a gentleman on a neighbouring park bench). The notes were kept on cards and scraps of paper in shoeboxes, in Fort&#x27;s cramped handwriting. More than once, depressed and discouraged, Fort destroyed his work, but began anew. Some notes were published by the Fortean Society magazine &quot;Doubt&quot;, and upon the death of its editor Tiffany Thayer in 1959, most were donated to the New York Public Library, where they are still available to researchers. Material created by Fort has also survived as part of the papers of Theodore Dreiser, held at the University of Pennsylvania.

From this research, Fort wrote four books: &quot;The Book of the Damned&quot; (1919), &quot;New Lands&quot; (1923), &quot;Lo!&quot; (1931), and &quot;Wild Talents&quot; (1932). One book was written between &quot;New Lands&quot; and &quot;Lo!&quot; but it was abandoned and absorbed into &quot;Lo!.&quot;

===Fort&#x27;s writing style===
Fort suggested that a Super-Sargasso Sea exists, into which all lost things go, and justified his theories by noting that they fit the data as well as the conventional explanations. As to whether Fort &quot;believed&quot; this theory, or any of his other proposals, he himself noted, &quot;I believe nothing of my own that I have ever written&quot;.

Notable literary contemporaries of Fort&#x27;s openly admired his writing style and befriended him. Among these were: Ben Hecht, John Cowper Powys, Sherwood Anderson, Clarence Darrow, and Booth Tarkington, who wrote the foreword to &quot;New Lands.&quot;

After Fort&#x27;s death, the writer Colin Wilson said that he suspected that Fort took few if any of his &quot;explanations&quot; seriously, and noted that Fort made &quot;no attempt to present a coherent argument&quot;. He described Fort as &quot;a patron saint of cranks&quot; while at the same time he compared Fort to Robert Ripley, a popular contemporary cartoonist and writer who found major success publishing similar oddities in a syndicated newspaper panel series named &quot;Ripley&#x27;s Believe It or Not!&quot;

Wilson called Fort&#x27;s writing style &quot;atrocious&quot; and &quot;almost unreadable&quot;, yet despite his objections to Fort&#x27;s prose, he allowed that &quot;the facts are certainly astonishing enough.&quot; In the end, Fort&#x27;s work gave him &quot;the feeling that no matter how honest scientists &quot;think&quot; they are, they are still influenced by various &quot;unconscious&quot; assumptions that prevent them from attaining true objectivity. Expressed in a sentence, Fort&#x27;s principle goes something like this: People with a psychological need to &quot;believe&quot; in marvels are no more prejudiced and gullible than people with a psychological need &quot;not&quot; to believe in marvels.&quot;

By contrast, Jerome Clark, wrote that Fort was &quot;essentially a satirist hugely skeptical of human beings&#x27;—especially scientists&#x27;—claims to ultimate knowledge&quot;. Clark described Fort&#x27;s writing style as a &quot;distinctive blend of mocking humor, penetrating insight, and calculated outrageousness&quot;. Fort was skeptical of sciences and wrote his own mocking explanations to defy scientists who used traditional methods.

In a review of &quot;Lo!&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Reading Fort is a ride on a comet; if the traveler returns to earth after the journey, he will find, after his first dizziness has worn off, a new and exhilarating emotion that will color and correct all his future reading of less heady scientific literature.&quot;

===Fortean phenomena===

Examples of the odd phenomena in Fort&#x27;s books include many occurrences of the sort variously referred to as occult, supernatural, and paranormal. Reported events include teleportation (a term Fort is generally credited with inventing), falls of frogs, fishes, and inorganic materials, spontaneous human combustion, ball lightning (a term explicitly used by Fort), poltergeist events, unaccountable noises and explosions, levitation, unidentified flying objects, unexplained disappearances, giant wheels of light in the oceans, and animals found outside their normal ranges (see phantom cat). He offered many reports of out-of-place artifacts (OOPArts), strange items found in unlikely locations. He was also perhaps the first person to explain strange human appearances and disappearances by the hypothesis of alien abduction, and was an early proponent of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, specifically suggesting that strange lights or objects sighted in the skies might be alien spacecraft.

===Forteans===
Fort&#x27;s work has inspired some people to consider themselves &quot;Forteans&quot;. The first of these was Hecht, a screenwriter, who in a review of &quot;The Book of the Damned&quot;, declared, &quot;I am the first disciple of Charles Fort... henceforth, I am a Fortean&quot;.

Precisely what is encompassed by the term &quot;Fortean&quot; is a matter of great debate; the term is widely applied to people ranging from Fortean purists dedicated to Fort&#x27;s methods and interests, to those with open and active acceptance of the actuality of paranormal phenomena, a belief with which Fort may not have agreed. Most generally, Forteans have a wide interest in unexplained phenomena, concerned mostly with the natural world, and have a developed &quot;agnostic skepticism&quot; regarding the anomalies they note and discuss. For Hecht, as an example, being a Fortean meant hallowing a pronounced distrust of authority in all its forms, whether religious, scientific, political, philosophical, or otherwise. It did not, of course, include an actual belief in the anomalous data enumerated in Fort&#x27;s works.

The Fortean Society was initiated at the Savoy-Plaza Hotel in New York City on January 26, 1931, by some of Fort&#x27;s friends, including such significant writers as Hecht, Dreiser, and Alexander Woollcott, and organized by fellow American writer Thayer, half in earnest and half in the spirit of great good humor, like the works of Fort himself. The board of founders included Dreiser, Hecht, Tarkington, Powys, Aaron Sussman, former &quot;Puck&quot; editor Harry Leon Wilson, Woollcott, and J. David Stern, publisher of &quot;The Philadelphia Record&quot;. Active members of the Fortean Society included prominent science-fiction writers such as Knight and Eric Frank Russell.

Fort, however, rejected the society and refused the presidency, which went to his friend Dreiser; he was lured to its inaugural meeting by false telegrams. As a strict nonauthoritarian, Fort refused to establish himself as an authority, and further objected on the grounds that those who would be attracted by such a group would be spiritualists, zealots, and those opposed to a science that rejected them; it would attract those who &quot;believed&quot; in their chosen phenomena—an attitude exactly contrary to Forteanism. Fort did hold unofficial meetings and had a long history of getting together informally with many of New York City&#x27;s literati such as Dreiser and Hecht at their apartments, where they would talk, have a meal, and then listen to brief reports.

The magazine &quot;Fortean Times&quot; (first published in November 1973) is a proponent of Fortean journalism, combining humor, skepticism, and serious research into subjects that scientists and other respectable authorities often disdain. Another such group is the International Fortean Organization (INFO), which was formed during the early 1960s (incorporated in 1965) by brothers and writers Ron and Paul Willis, who acquired much of the material of the Fortean Society, which had largely ceased by 1959 with the death of Thayer. INFO publishes the &quot;INFO Journal: Science and the Unknown&quot; and organizes the FortFest, the world&#x27;s first continuously running conference on anomalous phenomena dedicated to the spirit of Charles Fort. INFO, since the mid-1960s, also provides audio CDs and filmed DVDs of notable conference speakers, including Colin Wilson, John Michell, Graham Hancock, John Anthony West, William Corliss, John Keel, and Joscelyn Godwin. Other notable Fortean societies include the London Fortean Society, Edinburgh Fortean Society, in Edinburgh and the Isle of Wight.

===Scholarly evaluation===
Religious scholars such as Jeffrey J. Kripal and Joseph P. Laycock view Fort as a pioneering theorist who helped define &quot;paranormal&quot; as a discursive category and provided insight into its importance in human experience. Consistently critical of how science studied abnormal phenomena in his day, Fort remains a point of reference for those who engage in such studies today.

==Literary influence==
More than a few modern authors of fiction and nonfiction who have written about the influence of Fort are sincere devotees of Fort. One of the most notable is British philosopher John Michell, who wrote the introduction to the edition of &quot;Lo!&quot;, published by John Brown in 1996. Michell says: &quot;Fort, of course, made no attempt at defining a world-view, but the evidence he uncovered gave him an &#x27;acceptance&#x27; of reality as something far more magical and subtly organized than is considered proper today.&quot; Stephen King also uses the works of Fort to illuminate his main characters, notably &quot;It&quot; and &quot;Firestarter&quot;. In &quot;Firestarter&quot;, the parents of a pyrokinetically gifted child are advised to read Fort&#x27;s &quot;Wild Talents&quot; rather than the works of baby doctor Benjamin Spock.

Loren Coleman is a well-known cryptozoologist, author of &quot;The Unidentified&quot; (1975) dedicated to Fort, and &quot;Mysterious America&quot;, which &quot;Fortean Times&quot; termed a Fortean classic. Coleman terms himself the first Vietnam era conscientious objector to base his pacificist ideas on Fortean thoughts. Jerome Clark has described himself as a &quot;skeptical Fortean&quot;. Mike Dash is another Fortean, bringing his historian&#x27;s training to bear on all manner of odd reports, while being careful to avoid uncritically accepting &quot;any&quot; orthodoxy, be it that of fringe devotees or mainstream science. Science-fiction writers of note including Philip K. Dick, Robert Heinlein, and Robert Anton Wilson were also fans of the work of Fort. Alfred Bester&#x27;s teleportation-themed novel, &quot;The Stars My Destination&quot;, pays homage to the coiner of the term by naming the first teleporter &quot;Charles Fort Jaunte&quot;. Fort&#x27;s work, of compilation and commentary on anomalous phenomena has been carried on by William R. Corliss, whose self-published books and notes bring Fort&#x27;s collections up to date.

In 1939, Eric Frank Russell first published the novel which became &quot;Sinister Barrier&quot;, in which he names Fort explicitly as an influence. Russell included some of Fort&#x27;s data in the story. In chapter 3 of William Gaddis’s 1955 novel &quot;The Recognitions&quot;, protagonist Wyatt Gwyon twice quotes from Fort’s &quot;The Book of the Damned&quot;--“By the damned, I mean the excluded”; “By prostitution, I mean usefulness”—and paraphrases him from the same book: “Charles Fort says maybe we’re fished for, by supercelestial beings.” Ivan T. Sanderson, Scottish naturalist and writer, was a devotee of Fort&#x27;s work, and referenced it heavily in several of his own books on unexplained phenomena, notably &quot;Things&quot; (1967), and &quot;More Things&quot; (1969). Louis Pauwels and Jacques Bergier&#x27;s &quot;The Morning of the Magicians&quot; was also heavily influenced by Fort&#x27;s work and mentions it often. Author Donald Jeffries referenced Charles Fort repeatedly in his 2007 novel &quot;The Unreals&quot;. Joe Milutis writes a short chapter in his book &quot;Failure, a Writer&#x27;s Life&quot; on Charles Fort, characterising Fort&#x27;s prose as &quot;well-nigh unreadable, yet strangely exhilarating&quot;.

Noted UK paranormalist, Fortean, and ordained priest Lionel Fanthorpe presented the &quot;Fortean TV&quot; series on Channel 4, between 1997 and 1998. Paul Thomas Anderson&#x27;s popular movie &quot;Magnolia&quot; (1999) has an underlying theme of unexplained events, taken from the 1920s and &#x27;30s works of Charles Fort. Fortean author Loren Coleman has written a chapter about this motion picture, entitled &quot;The Teleporting Animals and &quot;Magnolia&quot;&quot;, in one of his recent books. The film has many hidden Fortean themes, notably &quot;falling frogs&quot;. In one scene, one of Fort&#x27;s books is visible on a table in a library and an end credit thanks him by name. In the 2011 film &quot;The Whisperer in Darkness&quot;, Fort is portrayed by Andrew Leman.

American crime and science-fiction author Fredric Brown included an excerpt from Fort&#x27;s book &quot;Wild Talents&quot; as an epigraph to his novel &quot;Compliments of a Fiend&quot;. In that quote, Fort speculated about the disappearance of two people named Ambrose and wondered &quot;was someone collecting Ambroses?&quot; Brown&#x27;s novel concerns the disappearance of a character named Ambrose, and the kidnapper calls himself the &quot;Ambrose collector&quot; as an obvious &quot;homage&quot; to Fort.

In Blue Balliett&#x27;s bestselling children&#x27;s novel, &quot;Chasing Vermeer&quot;, Fort is given several mentions throughout the book, such as Fort&#x27;s &quot;Lo!&quot; being found and thoroughly read by one of the book&#x27;s protagonists, and being an inspiration to the main characters.

<doc id="44492" wikidata="Q5267198" url="?curid=44492" title="List of areas in the United States National Park System">
<text>The National Park System of the United States is the collection of physical properties owned or administered by the National Park Service. The collection includes all national parks and most national monuments, as well as several other types of protected areas of the United States.

As of December 2024, there are units of the National Park System. However, this number is somewhat misleading. For example, Denali National Park and Preserve is counted as two units, since the same name applies to a national park and an adjacent national preserve. Yet Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve is counted as one unit, despite its double designation. Counting methodology is typically based on the language of a park&#x27;s authorizing legislation.

Although the designations generally reflect sites&#x27; features, all units of the system are considered administratively equal and with few exceptions the designations themselves do not define their level of protection. Each site has a management plan consistent with its ecological, historic, and recreational resources and its enabling legislation.

In addition to areas of the National Park System, the National Park Service also provides technical and financial assistance to several affiliated areas authorized by Congress. Affiliated areas are marked on the lists below.

National Park System units are found in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories of Guam, American Samoa, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. The territory of the Northern Mariana Islands has an affiliated area but not an official NPS unit.

Nearly all units managed by the National Park Service participate in the National Park Passport Stamps program.

==National parks==
There are 63 officially designated national parks in the United States and its dependent areas, as of 2021. The national parks are considered the &quot;crown jewels&quot; of the system and are typically larger than other areas, including a variety of significant ecological and geological resources.





===Former national parks===


==National monuments==


There are 138 national monuments, 89 of which are administered by the NPS and are listed below. Of these, 87 (all except Grand Canyon-Parashant and Avi Kwa Ame) are NPS official units.
The remaining 49 monuments are administered by five other federal agencies. Three, Grand Canyon–Parashant, Craters of the Moon, and Avi Kwa Ame National Monuments, are jointly administered by the NPS and the Bureau of Land Management, and Tule Lake National Monument is joint with the Fish and Wildlife Service. National monuments are typically smaller and protect just one or few major resources. They include both natural and historical sites and can be established by the president under the Antiquities Act. 34 former national monuments have been redesignated or incorporated into national parks. 

===Former national monuments===

==National preserves==

There are 21 national preserves in the United States, 19 of which are counted by the National Park System as official units. Ten are stand-alone official units, while eleven others are designated areas where hunting or grazing is permitted as part of a larger &quot;national park and preserve&quot; or &quot;national monument and preserve&quot;. Nine of those are counted as separate units, while Oregon Caves National Monument and Preserve and New River Gorge National Park and Preserve are single units (there is no functional difference). Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve is not officially a national preserve but has similar management policies, while Salt River Bay National Historical Park and Ecological Preserve is unrelated.

==National historical parks==

There are 63 national historical parks.
;Authorized national historical parks
==National historic sites==



There are 86 national historic sites, of which 76 are NPS units, 9 are affiliated areas, and one, Grey Towers National Historic Site, is managed by the U.S. Forest Service (not listed here).

===Former national battlefield sites===
==National memorials==


There are 31 national memorials that are NPS units and five affiliated national memorials.
===Former national memorials===
===Authorized national memorials===
==National recreation areas==

There are 18 national recreation areas administered by the National Park Service. Another 22 national recreation areas are administered by the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management.
===Former or transferred national recreation areas===
==National seashores==

There are 10 national seashores.
==National lakeshores==
There are three national lakeshores, located in Michigan and Wisconsin.
===Former national lakeshores===
==National rivers and national wild and scenic rivers==
There are four national rivers (marked with an asterisk) and ten national wild and scenic rivers administered as distinct units of the National Park System. There are many more national wild and scenic rivers that run through other units.

===Former national rivers===
==National reserves==

National reserves are partnerships between federal, state, and local authorities. Within the boundaries of the three national reserves are combinations of federal land (Park Service or National Wildlife Refuges), state parks and forests, local public lands, and private properties. Two national reserves are currently managed as official units.
==National parkways==
Ten roadways and surrounding scenic areas are managed by the NPS as parkways, four of which as official units and five as part of other units.
==National historic and scenic trails==

These National Park Service trails are part of the larger National Trails System. Only six of the trails are considered official units of the park system.

==National cemeteries==

Most national cemeteries are administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs, although a few are managed by the National Park Service and the U.S. Army. None of the cemeteries are considered official units of the system; they are all affiliated with other parks.

===Transferred national cemeteries===
==National heritage areas==
The National Park Service provides limited assistance to national heritage areas, but does not administer them.

==Other NPS protected areas and administrative groups==


There are 11 NPS units of other designations, as well as other affiliated areas. The National Mall and National Capital Parks have many sites, some of which are also units of other designations.
In addition, there are sites where the NPS is authorized to provide financial and technical assistance to local authorities for interpretive or educational purposes, but do not have the right to acquire land or have a say in land use or zoning. These include the 55 National Heritage Areas, as well as National Commemorative Sites such as Quindaro Townsite or the Kennedy-King National Commemorative Site. There are also various administrative groups of listed parks, such as Manhattan Sites, National Parks of New York Harbor, and Western Arctic National Parklands. The NPS also owns conservation easements (but not the land itself) for part of the area called the Green Springs National Historic Landmark District.

===Former other areas===

In the 1930s and 1940s, the NPS developed dozens of recreational demonstration areas, most of which eventually became national or state parks.

<text>A linear motor is an electric motor that has had its stator and rotor &quot;unrolled&quot;, thus, instead of producing a torque (rotation), it produces a linear force along its length. However, linear motors are not necessarily straight. Characteristically, a linear motor&#x27;s active section has ends, whereas more conventional motors are arranged as a continuous loop.

A typical mode of operation is as a Lorentz-type actuator, in which the applied force is linearly proportional to the current and the magnetic field formula_1.

Linear motors are most commonly found in high accuracy engineering applications.

Many designs have been put forward for linear motors, falling into two major categories, low-acceleration and high-acceleration linear motors. Low-acceleration linear motors are suitable for maglev trains and other ground-based transportation applications. High-acceleration linear motors are normally rather short, and are designed to accelerate an object to a very high speed; for example, see the coilgun.

High-acceleration linear motors are typically used in studies of hypervelocity collisions, as weapons, or as mass drivers for spacecraft propulsion. They are usually of the AC linear induction motor (LIM) design with an active three-phase winding on one side of the air-gap and a passive conductor plate on the other side. However, the direct current homopolar linear motor railgun is another high acceleration linear motor design. The low-acceleration, high speed and high power motors are usually of the linear synchronous motor (LSM) design, with an active winding on one side of the air-gap and an array of alternate-pole magnets on the other side. These magnets can be permanent magnets or electromagnets. The motor for the Shanghai maglev train, for instance, is an LSM.

== Types ==

=== Brushless ===
Brushless linear motors are members of the Synchronous motor family. They are typically used in standard linear stages or integrated into custom, high performance positioning systems. Invented in the late 1980s by Anwar Chitayat at Anorad Corporation, now Rockwell Automation, and helped improve the throughput and quality of industrial manufacturing processes.

=== Brush ===
Brushed linear motors were used in industrial automation applications prior to the invention of Brushless linear motors. Compared with three phase brushless motors, which are typically being used today, brush motors operate on a single phase. Brush linear motors have a lower cost since they do not need moving cables or three phase servo drives. However, they require higher maintenance since their brushes wear out.

=== Synchronous ===
In this design the rate of movement of the magnetic field is controlled, usually electronically, to track the motion of the rotor. For cost reasons synchronous linear motors rarely use commutators, so the rotor often contains permanent magnets, or soft iron. Examples include coilguns and the motors used on some maglev systems, as well as many other linear motors. In high precision industrial automation linear motors are typically configured with a magnet stator and a moving coil. A Hall effect sensor is attached to the rotor to track the magnetic flux of the stator. The electric current is typically provided from a stationary servo drive to the moving coil by a moving cable inside a cable carrier.

=== Induction ===
In this design, the force is produced by a moving linear magnetic field acting on conductors in the field. Any conductor, be it a loop, a coil or simply a piece of plate metal, that is placed in this field will have eddy currents induced in it thus creating an opposing magnetic field, in accordance with Lenz&#x27;s law. The two opposing fields will repel each other, thus creating motion as the magnetic field sweeps through the metal.
=== Homopolar ===
In this design a large current is passed through a metal sabot across sliding contacts that are fed by two rails. The magnetic field this generates causes the metal to be projected along the rails.

=== Tubular ===

Efficient and compact design applicable to the replacement of pneumatic cylinders.

=== Piezoelectric ===
Piezoelectric drive is often used to drive small linear motors.
== History ==
=== Low acceleration ===
The history of linear electric motors can be traced back at least as far as the 1840s, to the work of Charles Wheatstone at King&#x27;s College London, but Wheatstone&#x27;s model was too inefficient to be practical. A feasible linear induction motor is described in (1905 - inventor Alfred Zehden of Frankfurt-am-Main), for driving trains or lifts. The German engineer Hermann Kemper built a working model in 1935. In the late 1940s, Dr. Eric Laithwaite of Manchester University, later Professor of Heavy Electrical Engineering at Imperial College in London developed the first full-size working model. 

In a single sided version the magnetic repulsion forces the conductor away from the stator, levitating it, and carrying it along in the direction of the moving magnetic field. He called the later versions of it magnetic river. The technologies would later be applied, in the 1984, Air-Rail Link shuttle, between Birmingham&#x27;s airport and an adjacent train station.
Because of these properties, linear motors are often used in maglev propulsion, as in the Japanese Linimo magnetic levitation train line near Nagoya. However, linear motors have been used independently of magnetic levitation, as in the Bombardier Innovia Metro systems worldwide and a number of modern Japanese subways, including Tokyo&#x27;s Toei Ōedo Line.

Similar technology is also used in some roller coasters with modifications but, at present, is still impractical on street running trams, although this, in theory, could be done by burying it in a slotted conduit.

Outside of public transportation, vertical linear motors have been proposed as lifting mechanisms in deep mines, and the use of linear motors is growing in motion control applications. They are also often used on sliding doors, such as those of low floor trams such as the Alstom Citadis and the Socimi Eurotram. Dual axis linear motors also exist. These specialized devices have been used to provide direct &quot;X&quot;-&quot;Y&quot; motion for precision laser cutting of cloth and sheet metal, automated drafting, and cable forming. Most linear motors in use are LIM (linear induction motor), or LSM (linear synchronous motor). Linear DC motors are not used due to their higher cost and linear SRM suffers from poor thrust. So for long runs in traction LIM is mostly preferred and for short runs LSM is mostly preferred.

=== High acceleration ===
High-acceleration linear motors have been suggested for a number of uses.
They have been considered for use as weapons, since current armour-piercing ammunition tends to consist of small rounds with very high kinetic energy, for which just such motors are suitable. Many amusement park launched roller coasters now use linear induction motors to propel the train at a high speed, as an alternative to using a lift hill.

The United States Navy is also using linear induction motors in the Electromagnetic Aircraft Launch System that will replace traditional steam catapults on future aircraft carriers. They have also been suggested for use in spacecraft propulsion. In this context they are usually called mass drivers. The simplest way to use mass drivers for spacecraft propulsion would be to build a large mass driver that can accelerate cargo up to escape velocity, though RLV launch assist like StarTram to low Earth orbit has also been investigated.

High-acceleration linear motors are difficult to design for a number of reasons. They require large amounts of energy in very short periods of time. One rocket launcher design calls for 300 GJ for each launch in the space of less than a second. Normal electrical generators are not designed for this kind of load, but short-term electrical energy storage methods can be used. Capacitors are bulky and expensive but can supply large amounts of energy quickly. Homopolar generators can be used to convert the kinetic energy of a flywheel into electric energy very rapidly. High-acceleration linear motors also require very strong magnetic fields; in fact, the magnetic fields are often too strong to permit the use of superconductors. However, with careful design, this need not be a major problem.

Two different basic designs have been invented for high-acceleration linear motors: railguns and coilguns.

== Usage ==
Linear motors are commonly used for actuating high performance industrial automation equipment. Their advantage, unlike any other commonly used actuator, such as a ball screw, timing belt, or rack and pinion, is that they provide any combination of high precision, high velocity, high force and long travel.

Linear motors are widely used. One of the major uses of linear motors is for propelling the shuttle in looms.

A linear motor has been used for sliding doors and various similar actuators. They have been used for baggage handling and even large-scale bulk materials transport.

Linear motors are sometimes used to create rotary motion. For example, they have been used at observatories to deal with the large radius of curvature.

Linear motors may also be used as an alternative to conventional chain-run lift hills for roller coasters. The coaster Maverick at Cedar Point uses one such linear motor in place of a chain lift.

A linear motor has been used to accelerate cars for crash tests.

=== Industrial automation ===
The combination of high precision, high velocity, high force, and long travel makes brushless linear motors attractive for driving industrial automations equipment. They serve industries and applications such as semiconductor steppers, electronics surface-mount technology, automotive cartesian coordinate robots, aerospace chemical milling, optics electron microscope, healthcare laboratory automation, food and beverage pick and place.

=== Machine tools ===
Synchronous linear motor actuators, used in machine tools, provide high force, high velocity, high precision and high dynamic stiffness, resulting in high smoothness of motion and low settling time. They may reach velocities of 2 m/s and micron-level accuracies, with short cycle times and a smooth surface finish.

=== Train propulsion ===

==== Conventional rails ====
All of the following applications are in rapid transit and have the active part of the motor in the cars.

===== Bombardier Innovia Metro =====

Originally developed in the late 1970s by UTDC in Canada as the Intermediate Capacity Transit System (ICTS). A test track was constructed in Millhaven, Ontario, for extensive testing of prototype cars, after which three lines were constructed:
* Line 3 Scarborough in Toronto (opened 1985; closed 2023)
* Expo Line of the Vancouver SkyTrain (opened 1985 and extended in 1994)
* Detroit People Mover in Detroit (opened 1987)
ICTS was sold to Bombardier Transportation in 1991 and later known as Advanced Rapid Transit (ART) before adopting its current branding in 2011. Since then, several more installations have been made:
* Kelana Jaya Line in Kuala Lumpur (opened 1998 and extended in 2016)
* Millennium Line of the Vancouver SkyTrain (opened 2002 and extended in 2016)
* AirTrain JFK in New York (opened 2003)
* Airport Express (Beijing Subway) (opened 2008)
* Everline in Yongin, South Korea (opened 2013)
All Innovia Metro systems use third rail electrification.

===== Japanese Linear Metro =====
One of the biggest challenges faced by Japanese railway engineers in the 1970s to the 1980s was the ever increasing construction costs of subways. In response, the Japan Subway Association began studying on the feasibility of the &quot;mini-metro&quot; for meeting urban traffic demand in 1979. In 1981, the Japan Railway Engineering Association studied on the use of linear induction motors for such small-profile subways and by 1984 was investigating on the practical applications of linear motors for urban rail with the Japanese Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism. In 1988, a successful demonstration was made with the Limtrain at Saitama and influenced the eventual adoption of the linear motor for the Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line in Osaka and Toei Line 12 (present-day Toei Oedo Line) in Tokyo.

To date, the following subway lines in Japan use linear motors and use overhead lines for power collection:
* Two Osaka Metro lines in Osaka:
** Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line (opened 1990)
** Imazatosuji Line (opened 2006)
* Toei Ōedo Line in Tokyo (opened 2000)
* Kaigan Line of the Kobe Municipal Subway (opened 2001)
* Nanakuma Line of the Fukuoka City Subway (opened 2005)
* Yokohama Municipal Subway Green Line (opened 2008)
* Sendai Subway Tōzai Line (opened 2015)

In addition, Kawasaki Heavy Industries has also exported the Linear Metro to the Guangzhou Metro in China; all of the Linear Metro lines in Guangzhou use third rail electrification:
* Line 4 (opened 2005)
* Line 5 (opened 2009).
* Line 6 (opened 2013)

==== Monorail ====
* There is at least one known monorail system which is not magnetically levitated, but nonetheless uses linear motors. This is the Moscow Monorail. Originally, traditional motors and wheels were to be used. However, it was discovered during test runs that the proposed motors and wheels would fail to provide adequate traction under some conditions, for example, when ice appeared on the rail. Hence, wheels are still used, but the trains use linear motors to accelerate and slow down. This is possibly the only use of such a combination, due to the lack of such requirements for other train systems.
* The TELMAGV is a prototype of a monorail system that is also not magnetically levitated but uses linear motors.

==== Magnetic levitation ====
* High-speed trains:
** Transrapid: first commercial use in Shanghai (opened in 2004)
** SCMaglev, under construction in Japan (fastest train in the world, planned to open by 2027)
* Rapid transit:
** Birmingham Airport, UK (opened 1984, closed 1995)
** M-Bahn in Berlin, Germany (opened in 1989, closed in 1991)
** Daejeon EXPO, Korea (ran only 1993)
** HSST: Linimo line in Aichi Prefecture, Japan (opened 2005)
** Incheon Airport Maglev (opened July 2014)
** Changsha Maglev Express (opened 2016)
** S1 line of Beijing Subway (opened 2017)

=== Amusement rides ===

There are many roller coasters throughout the world that use LIMs to accelerate the ride vehicles. The first being &quot;Flight of Fear&quot; at Kings Island and Kings Dominion, both opening in 1996. Battlestar Galactica: Human VS Cylon &amp; Revenge of the Mummy at Universal Studios Singapore opened in 2010. They both use LIMs to accelerate from certain point in the rides.

Revenge of the Mummy also located at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida. The Incredible Hulk Coaster and VelociCoaster at Universal Islands of Adventure also use linear motors. At Walt Disney World, Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roller Coaster Starring Aerosmith at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios and &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot;: Cosmic Rewind at Epcot both use LSM to launch their ride vehicles into their indoor ride enclosures.

In 2023 a hydraulic launch roller coaster, Top Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point in Ohio, USA, was renovated and the hydraulic launch replaced with a weaker multi-launch system using LSM, that creates less g-force.

<text>The State Council of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, also known as the Central People&#x27;s Government, is the chief administrative authority and the national cabinet of China. It is constitutionally the highest administrative organ of the country and the executive organ of the National People&#x27;s Congress, the highest organ of state power. It is composed of the premier, vice premiers, state councilors, ministers, chairpersons of commissions, the auditor-general, the governor of the People&#x27;s Bank of China, and the secretary-general.

The premier is responsible for the State Council and exercises overall leadership of its work. The secretary-general of the State Council, under the leadership of the premier, is responsible for handling the daily work of the State Council and heads the General Office of the State Council. The executive meeting of the State Council, consisting of the premier, vice premiers, state councillors and the secretary-general, meets two to three times a month, while the plenary session, consisting of all members of the State Council, meets every six months.

The State Council directly oversees provincial-level People&#x27;s Governments, and in practice maintains membership with top levels of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The State Council is legally required to implement the policies of the CCP. Aside from a few, members of the State Council are also members of the CCP&#x27;s Central Committee.

== Organization ==
The State Council is described by the Chinese constitution as the executive organ of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC), as well as the &quot;highest state administrative organ&quot;. Constitutionally, the main functions of the State Council are to formulate administrative measures, issue decisions and orders, and monitor their implementation; draft legislative bills for submission to the NPC or its Standing Committee; and prepare the economic plan and the state budget for deliberation and approval by the NPC. The State Council has flexibility in decision-making, especially with regard to economic matters, but the Politburo has ultimate authority.

In 2024, during the second session of the 14th National People&#x27;s Congress, the Organic Law of the State Council was amended to mandate the CCP Central Committee&#x27;s leadership over the State Council. The amended law also stipulates the State Council must follow the CCP&#x27;s ideology and policies.

=== Composition ===
The State Council is composed of the premier, several vice premiers, several state councillors, ministers of ministries, directors of committees, the auditor general, and the secretary-general. The premier leads the State Council and is appointed by the NPC upon the nomination by the president, though in practice the premier is chosen within the CCP leadership, including the Politburo Standing Committee. The vice premiers (one executive and generally three others), state councillors, and a secretary-general (who normally also serves as a state councillor) all assist the premier.

Each vice premier oversees certain areas of administration in support of the premier. In practice, the vice premiers and State Councillors assume responsibility for one or more sectors or issues, and remain in contact with the various bodies responsible for policy related to that area. This allows the Standing Committee to oversee a wide range of government functions. Each State Councillor performs duties as designated by the Premier. The secretary-general heads the General Office which handles the day-to-day work of the State Council.

The State Council includes 26 constituent departments, and oversees the province-level governments throughout China. Each ministry supervises one sector. Commissions outrank ministries and set policies for and coordinate the related activities of different administrative organs. Offices deal with matters of ongoing concern. The establishment, dissolution, or merger of the constituent departments are proposed by the premier and decided by the NPC or its Standing Committee. Bureaus and administrations rank below ministries. In addition to the ministries, there are 38 centrally administered government organizations that report directly to the state council. The heads of these organizations attend full meetings of the state committee on an irregular basis.

The State Council controls the Ministry for National Defense but does not control the People&#x27;s Liberation Army, which is instead controlled by the Central Military Commission (CMC). The State Council previously had joint command over the People&#x27;s Armed Police (PAP) together with the CMC, principally through the Ministry of Public Security, though 2018 reforms placed the PAP solely under CMC command.

=== Meetings ===
The plenary session of the State Council meets every six months, composed of all members of the State Council. Between meetings it is guided by an which is held two to three times a month, and can be called at the discretion of the premier. The Executive Meeting is composed of the premier, vice premiers, state councilors, and the secretary-general.

== Members ==
=== Executive Meeting ===
=== Plenary Meeting ===
The Plenary Meeting of the State Council is hosted by the Premier, joined by Vice Premiers, State Councillors, Ministers in charge of Ministries and Commissions, the Governor of the People&#x27;s Bank, the Auditor-General, and the Secretary-General. It usually runs bi-annually and when necessary, non-members can be invited to participate.

In December 1995, Chuck Noland is a FedEx systems analyst who travels the world resolving productivity problems. He lives with his girlfriend, Kelly Frears in Memphis, Tennessee. The two talk of getting married but keep experiencing setbacks due to Chuck being constantly called away to work, which also starts to put a strain on their relationship. During a Christmas dinner, Chuck experiences pain due to an infected tooth, just before he is summoned to resolve a FedEx problem in Malaysia. Before leaving, Kelly gives Chuck her grandfather&#x27;s pocket watch with a photo of her in it. He gives her a small box, saying she can wait to open it on New Year&#x27;s Eve when he returns, implying it is an engagement ring.

The FedEx cargo plane Chuck boards crashes into the Pacific Ocean during a violent storm, leaving him as the only survivor. Washing ashore on a deserted island, Chuck explores the area, discovering several FedEx packages washing up on the coast, as well as the body of one of the pilots, Albert Miller, which he buries. In the following days, Chuck struggles to locate food and water. After seeing a ship on the horizon, he unsuccessfully tries to escape the island on a life raft, but is prevented by the tide and injures his leg. Realizing it is unlikely he will be rescued, Chuck opens most of the packages, finding useful items he uses to improve his living conditions. However, he does not open a package with golden angel wings painted on it, thinking the wings have symbolic meaning. While attempting to start a fire, Chuck cuts his hand and furiously throws several objects including a Wilson volleyball, leaving a bloodstained handprint. He draws a face into the blood, names the ball &quot;Wilson&quot; and begins talking to it. Chuck realizes the chances of his rescue are low because of the wide search area. Due to severe pain from his infected tooth, he decides to perform his own tooth extraction using a rock and an ice skate. The extraction is successful, but he passes out from the pain and trauma.

Four years later, Chuck, now bearded, thinner, and disheveled, has adapted to life alone on the island. After a section from a portable toilet enclosure washes up, he begins constructing a raft, which he successfully launches past the surf with Wilson, the unopened FedEx package and his belongings in tow. Chuck survives a storm, but afterward, Wilson falls off the raft and floats away. He unsuccessfully attempts to rescue Wilson and is left to grieve his loss. Soon after, he is rescued by a passing cargo ship.

Four weeks later, Chuck is cleaned up and returned to the mainland, where he learns he was presumed dead by his family and friends. As he is given a hero&#x27;s welcome at the FedEx Headquarters in Memphis, he meets his dentist Jerry Lovett, whom he discovers has married and had a daughter with Kelly. A homecoming party is held at Chuck&#x27;s hotel suite but Kelly is emotionally unable to greet him. Later that night, Chuck visits Kelly, where they bond for the last time; the two share a passionate kiss and confess their love for each other, but they both realize she cannot leave her family, and they part ways, with Chuck returning the pocket watch Kelly gave him.

Chuck drives to Texas to return the angel-winged package to the address of the sender. Finding no one home, he leaves it at the door with a note saying the package saved his life. He departs in his vehicle and stops at a remote crossroads. A woman in a pickup truck, headed in the direction of the house, stops and gives information about where each road leads. As she drives away, Chuck notices the same angel wings painted on the tailgate of her truck. He looks down each road, trying to decide which way to go, smiling as he finally faces in the direction the truck went.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
In a 2017 Actor Roundtable with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Tom Hanks stated
=== Filming ===

The film was not shot chronologically. It began on January 18, 1999, before halting two months later. Filming resumed on April 3, 2000, and finished the following month. Hanks gained during pre-production, for the purpose of making his transformation more dramatic. After most of the film was shot, production was paused so he could lose the weight and grow his hair and beard to look like he had been living on the island for years. Another four-month production halt preceded the filming of the return scenes. During the year-long hiatus, Zemeckis used the same film crew to make another film, &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot;. While the film was in production, Hanks nearly died when he suffered an infected cut on his leg. He was rushed to a local hospital to undergo surgery and stayed there for three days. Filming of &quot;Cast Away&quot; was suspended for three weeks to allow Hanks to recover from the injury. Filming lasted for sixteen months.

&quot;Cast Away&quot; was filmed on Monuriki, one of the Mamanuca Islands in Fiji. It is in a subgroup of the Mamanuca archipelago, which is sited off the coast of Viti Levu, Fiji&#x27;s largest island. The island became a tourist attraction after the film&#x27;s release. After Chuck&#x27;s return, it is identified by Kelly as being &quot;about south of the Cook Islands,&quot; but there is no land between the southernmost Cook Islands of Mangaia and Antarctica.

The film begins and ends in the same location, on the Arrington Ranch in the Texas Panhandle south of the city of Canadian, Texas.

=== Music ===
The film&#x27;s minimal score was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri for which he won a Grammy Award in 2002. The film&#x27;s soundtrack is most notable for its lack of score and creature sound effects (such as bird song or insect sounds) while Chuck is on the island, which is intended to reinforce the feeling of isolation. &quot;Cast Away&quot; contains no original musical score until Chuck escapes the island. However, there is a Russian choral piece heard near the start of the film that was not composed or even recorded by Silvestri, so it does not appear on the film&#x27;s soundtrack list. It is a traditional Russian song written by Lev Knipper called &quot;Oh, My Field&quot; (&quot;Polyushko, Polye&quot;) and it is available on various collections of Red Army hymns.

The official soundtrack CD is an anthology of musical pieces from all the films up to that point that were both directed by Zemeckis and scored by Silvestri. The only track from &quot;Cast Away&quot; itself is the theme from the end credits.

The &quot;Cast Away&quot; soundtrack consists of 10 tracks, with performers including Elvis Presley, Chuck Berry, and Charles Brown.

=== FedEx ===
FedEx provided access to their facilities (Memphis, Los Angeles, and Moscow) as well as airplanes, trucks, uniforms, and logistical support. A team of FedEx marketers oversaw production through more than two years of filming. FedEx CEO Fred Smith made an appearance as himself for the scene where Chuck is welcomed back, which was filmed on location at FedEx&#x27;s home facilities in Memphis, Tennessee. The idea of a story based on a FedEx plane crashing gave the company &quot;a heart attack at first&quot;, but the overall story was seen as positive. FedEx, which paid no money for product placement in the film, saw an increase in brand awareness in Asia and Europe following the film&#x27;s release.

=== Wilson the volleyball ===

In the film, Wilson the volleyball serves as Chuck Noland&#x27;s personified friend and only companion during the four years that Noland spends alone on a deserted island. Named after the volleyball&#x27;s manufacturer, Wilson Sporting Goods, the character was created by screenwriter William Broyles Jr. While researching for the film, he consulted with professional survival experts, and then chose to deliberately strand himself for one week on an isolated beach in the Gulf of California, to force himself to search for water and food, and obtain his own shelter. During this time, a volleyball washed up on shore, providing the inspiration for the film&#x27;s inanimate companion. From a screenwriting point of view, Wilson also serves to realistically allow dialogue to take place in a solitary scenario.

It is rumored, but not confirmed, that one of the original volleyball props was sold at auction for $18,500 to the ex-CEO of FedEx Office, Ken May. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, Wilson launched its own joint promotion centered on its products &quot;co-starring&quot; with Tom Hanks. Wilson manufactured a volleyball with a reproduction of the bloodied handprint face on one side. It was sold for a limited time during the film&#x27;s initial release and continues to be offered on the company&#x27;s website. A screen-matched original Wilson the volleyball prop sold via Heritage Auctions on Dec 7, 2024 for $162,500.

== Reception ==
=== Box office ===
&quot;Cast Away&quot; opened in 2,774 theaters in North America and grossed $28.9 million (an average of $10,412 per theater) in its opening weekend. For the four-day Christmas long holiday weekend, it took in a total of $39.9 million. At that point, it had the highest Christmas opening weekend of any film, surpassing &quot;Patch Adams&quot;. Upon opening, &quot;Cast Away&quot; reached the number one spot at the box office, beating another Helen Hunt film, &quot;What Women Want&quot;. It would also compete against &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot;, which was released the previous month. With a total gross of $8.5 million, &quot;Cast Away&quot; held the record for having the biggest New Year&#x27;s Eve gross until &quot;Meet the Fockers&quot; took it in 2004. The film remained at the top of the box office for three weeks until it was overtaken by &quot;Save the Last Dance&quot;. &quot;Cast Away&quot; kept performing well and ended up earning $233.6 million domestically and $196 million internationally, for a total of $429.6 million, against its production budget of $90 million. It became the third-highest-grossing film of 2000, behind &quot;&quot; and &quot;Gladiator&quot;.

=== Critical response ===
On Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;Cast Away&quot; holds an approval rating of 89% based on 158 reviews, with an average rating of 7.40/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Flawed but fascinating, &quot;Cast Away&quot; offers an intelligent script, some of Robert Zemeckis&#x27; most mature directing, and a showcase performance from Tom Hanks.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100 based on reviews from 32 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film three stars out of four. In his review, he praised Hanks for doing &quot;a superb job of carrying &quot;Cast Away&quot; all by himself for about two-thirds of its running time&quot; by &quot;never straining for effect, always persuasive even in this unlikely situation, winning our sympathy with his eyes and his body language when there&#x27;s no one else on the screen.&quot; However, he also mentioned how he felt that the film is &quot;a strong and simple story surrounded by needless complications, and flawed by a last act that disappoints us and then ends on a note of forced whimsy.&quot;

=== Accolades ===
==Home media==
&quot;Cast Away&quot; was released on VHS and DVD on June 12, 2001, by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment. The DVD version of the film is a THX certified two-disc Special Edition release that features a DTS 6.1 ES audio track and several bonus features, including galleries, special effects vignettes, audio commentary, trailers, TV spots, behind-the-scenes footage, interviews, featurettes and more. It became the fastest-selling DVD release in 20th Century Fox history, selling 1.8 million copies and surpassing &quot;X-Men&quot;. Additionally, the film generated $5.5 million in rentals, which broke &quot;Traffic&quot;″s record for having the highest DVD rentals. &quot;Cast Away&quot; went on to hold this record until 2002 when it was taken by &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;. In total, the film made $57 million in home video sales and $20.6 million in home video rentals during its first week of release. It had the second-highest first week home video rentals of any film, behind &quot;Meet the Parents&quot;, as well as third-highest rentals overall, after the latter film and &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;.

A single-disc DVD version of the film was released alongside &quot;Independence Day&quot; on May 21, 2002.

The film was released on Blu-ray Disc on December 4, 2007.

== In popular culture ==
A FedEx commercial during Super Bowl XXXVII parodied the final scene of the film, in which Chuck Noland returns a package to its sender. In this version, the woman answers the door, and when Noland asks what was in the box, the woman replies: &quot;Just a satellite phone, GPS locator, fishing rod, water purifier, and some seeds. Just silly stuff.&quot;

Media executive Lloyd Braun of ABC first suggested the idea of a &quot;Cast Away&quot;–type television series at a dinner party in 2003. Thom Sherman later pitched the idea for &quot;Cast Away – The Series&quot;, but never developed the idea. The concept was later developed and pitched with the title &quot;Nowhere&quot;, which later turned into the ABC show &quot;Lost&quot;.

The second episode of the seventh season of &quot;It&#x27;s Always Sunny in Philadelphia&quot;, &quot;The Gang Goes to the Jersey Shore&quot; refers to a &quot;Cast Away&quot; scene. When Frank loses his &quot;rum ham&quot; while floating on a raft in the Atlantic Ocean, his anguish resembles that of Tom Hanks&#x27; character losing a volleyball he named &quot;Wilson.&quot;

On December 31, 2002, at Madison Square Garden, Phish played a clip from the film on the jumbotron to introduce their song &quot;Wilson&quot; during their concert. They later introduced &quot;Tom Hanks&quot; during the song onstage, but it was later revealed to be keyboardist Page McConnell&#x27;s brother Steve.

On April 15, 2022, at Progressive Field, Tom Hanks threw the ceremonial first pitch at the Cleveland Guardians home opener, accompanied by a replica of Wilson from the movie.

Dale Earnhardt Jr. raced with a Wilson replica in his car to two victories in the fall of 2001 at Dover and Talladega. This was due to a joke on the radio that he felt lonely in the car during a race.

<text>Allegro is a software library for video game development. The functionality of the library includes support for basic 2D graphics, image manipulation, text output, audio output, MIDI music, input and timers, as well as additional routines for fixed-point and floating-point matrix arithmetic, Unicode strings, file system access, file manipulation, data files, and 3D graphics. The library is written in the C programming language and designed to be used with C, C++, or Objective-C, with bindings available for Python, Lua, Scheme, D, Go, and other languages. Allegro comes with extensive documentation and many examples.

Allegro supports Windows, macOS, Unix-like systems, Android, and iOS, abstracting their application programming interfaces (APIs) into one portable interface. It can run also on top of Simple DirectMedia Layer which is used to run Allegro programs in web browser using Emscripten.

Released under the terms of the zlib license, Allegro is free and open source software.

== History ==

Initially standing for &quot;Atari Low-Level Game Routines&quot;, Allegro was originally created by for the Atari ST in the early 1990s. When Hargreaves realized the platform was dying, he abandoned the Atari version, and reimplemented his work for the Borland C++ and DJGPP compilers in 1995. Support for Borland C++ was dropped in version 2.0, and DJGPP was the only supported compiler. As DJGPP was an MS-DOS compiler, all games which used Allegro therefore used DOS, attracting the enthusiast scene for that legacy system. Around 1998, Allegro branched out into several versions. A port to Windows, WinAllegro, was created, and also during this time, a Unix port of Allegro, XwinAllegro, was created. These various ports were brought together during the Allegro 3.9 WIP versions, with Allegro 4.0 being the first stable version of Allegro to support multiple platforms.

=== Allegro 5 ===

Current development is focused on the Allegro 5 branch, a complete redesign of both the API and much of the library&#x27;s internal operation. Effort was made to make the API more consistent and multi-thread safe. By default, the library is now hardware-accelerated using OpenGL or DirectX rendering backends where appropriate. Many of the addons that existed as separate projects for Allegro 4 now interface seamlessly with Allegro proper and are bundled with the default installation. Allegro 5 is event driven.

<text>The Chatti (also Chatthi or Catti) were an ancient Germanic tribe whose homeland was near the upper Weser (&quot;Visurgis&quot;) river. They lived in central and northern Hesse and southern Lower Saxony, along the upper reaches of that river and in the valleys and mountains of the Eder and Fulda regions, a district approximately corresponding to Hesse-Kassel, though probably somewhat more extensive. They settled within the region in the first century BC. According to Tacitus, the Batavians and Cananefates of his time, tribes living within the Roman Empire, were descended from part of the Chatti, who left their homeland after an internal quarrel drove them out, to take up new lands at the mouth of the Rhine.

==Sources==
While Julius Caesar (100–44 BC) was well informed about the regions and tribes on the eastern banks of the Rhine, he never mentioned the Chatti by name. In the same large geographical region he clearly named the Suebi as the residents in his time, suggesting that they had recently driven out Celts, and were in his time still threatening the regions around them. Strabo (64/63 BC – c. 24 AD), however, mentioned both the Suevi, who he describes as a considerable nation made up of many tribes, and the Chatti, who he described as one of the smaller Germanic tribes, and did not list among the Suevi.

A century later, Pliny the Elder, in his &quot;Natural History&quot; (written 77–79 ) distinguished the Chatti and Suebi but grouped them together with the Hermunduri and the Cherusci, calling this group the Hermiones, which is a nation of Germanic tribes also mentioned by Tacitus as living in inland Germany. Some commentators believe that Caesar&#x27;s Suebi were therefore possibly the same as the later Chatti, a branch of the Suebian movement of people who had become more clearly identifiable. If not, then the Chatti may represent a survival of an older tribal name, as opposed to the Tencteri, Usipetes, and Ubii who were all were forced from homelands in the same region by the Suebic incursions.

The first ancient writer to mention the Chatti is Velleius Paterculus. He mentioned them in 6 AD in his book 2, 109 (5): “Sentius Saturninus received the order to march with his legions through the area of the Chatti to Boiohaemum, which is the name of the area occupied by Maroboduus, cutting a passage through the Hercynian forest which bounded the region.&quot;

The second ancient writer to mention the Chatti is Strabo, some time after 16 , who includes the Chatti in a listing of conquered Germanic tribes who were more settled and agricultural, but also poorer, than the nomadic tribes in central and eastern Germania such as the Suebi. They were poor because they had fought the Romans, and had been defeated and plundered. In his second book of &quot;Epigrams&quot;, Martial credited the emperor Domitian (51–96 ) as having overcome the Chatti:

For the first century , Tacitus provides important information about the Chatti&#x27;s part in the Germanic wars and certain elements of their culture. He says that:[The Chatti&#x27;s] settlements begin at the Hercynian forest, where the country is not so open and marshy as in the other cantons into which Germany stretches. They are found where there are hills, and with them grow less frequent, for the Hercynian forest keeps close till it has seen the last of its native Chatti. Hardy frames, close-knit limbs, fierce countenances, and a peculiarly vigorous courage, mark the tribe. For Germans, they have much intelligence and sagacity; they promote their picked men to power, and obey those whom they promote; they keep their ranks, note their opportunities, check their impulses, portion out the day, intrench themselves by night, regard fortune as a doubtful, valour as an unfailing, resource; and what is most unusual, and only given to systematic discipline, they rely more on the general than on the army. Their whole strength is in their infantry, which, in addition to its arms, is laden with iron tools and provisions. Other tribes you see going to battle, the Chatti to a campaign. Seldom do they engage in mere raids and casual encounters. It is indeed the peculiarity of a cavalry force quickly to win and as quickly to yield a victory. Fleetness and timidity go together; deliberateness is more akin to steady courage.

Tacitus also notes that like other Germanic tribes, the Chatti took an interest in traditions concerning haircuts and beards.A practice, rare among the other German tribes, and simply characteristic of individual prowess, has become general among the Chatti, of letting the hair and beard grow as soon as they have attained manhood, and not till they have slain a foe laying aside that peculiar aspect which devotes and pledges them to valour. Over the spoiled and bleeding enemy they show their faces once more; then, and not till then, proclaiming that they have discharged the obligations of their birth, and proved themselves worthy of their country and of their parents. The coward and the unwarlike remain unshorn. The bravest of them also wear an iron ring (which otherwise is a mark of disgrace among the people) until they have released themselves by the slaughter of a foe. Most of the Chatti delight in these fashions. Even hoary-headed men are distinguished by them, and are thus conspicuous alike to enemies and to fellow-countrymen. To begin the battle always rests with them; they form the first line, an unusual spectacle. Nor even in peace do they assume a more civilised aspect. They have no home or land or occupation; they are supported by whomsoever they visit, as lavish of the property of others as they are regardless of their own, till at length the feebleness of age makes them unequal to so stern a valour.

Between the Rhine and the Chatti, Tacitus places the Tencteres and Usipetes, who apparently had been moved since the time of Caesar into the old homeland of the Ubii, who had in turn settled in Cologne. (Caesar had described these three tribes as under pressure from Suebi to their east, and attempting to move across the Rhine.) To the south, Tacitus also says that the Chatti&#x27;s land is beyond the questionable lands, the so-called tithe lands, or agri decumates, that adventurers from the Roman sides of the Rhine and Danube had been trying to settle. It is possible that at first the Chatti moved into place on the Rhine, in the old territory of the Ubii. Cassius Dio describes Drusus establishing a fort in Chatti territory on the Rhine in 11 , and that in 10 they moved out of an area where the Romans had permitted them.

To the north of the Chatti, Tacitus places the large area of the Chauci. To the east, the neighbours of the Chatti and Chauci were the Cherusci, who Tacitus describes as excessively peace-loving in his time. (Caesar had described the Suevi, not the Chatti, as living between the Ubii on the Rhine and a forest called the Bacenis, which separated them from the Cherusci. This is why Caesar&#x27;s Suevi are sometimes thought to be Chatti.)

The Chatti successfully resisted incorporation into the Roman Empire, joining the Cheruscan war leader Arminius&#x27; coalition of tribes that annihilated Varus&#x27; legions in 9 AD in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Germanicus later, in 15, raided their lands in revenge, but Rome eventually responded to the Chatti&#x27;s belligerent defense of their independence by building the limes border fortifications along the southern boundary of their lands in central Hesse during the early years of the first century. A major raid by the Chatti into Germania Superior was defeated decisively by the legions in 50 AD. In 58 AD the Chatti were defeated by the Hermunduri in a border dispute over a religiously significant river.

Roman sources identify the fabled Mattium, beyond the Eder, as the capital of the Chatti. Destroyed by Germanicus, its location is not known today, but generally is assumed to be in the wider neighbourhood of Fritzlar north of the river Eder.

The Chatti were opponents of the emperor Domitian in 84 CE, and were allies of Lucius Antonius Saturninus in his revolt of 89 CE.

They appear again during the build up to the Marcomannic wars, first attacking southwards towards Germania superior and Raitia in what is now southern Germany, in 162, and then while the bigger battles were being fought they were repulsed together with the Hermunduri from the Rhine by Didius Julianus in 175.

After the early third century , however, the Chatti virtually disappear from the sources and are only called upon as a topical element or when writing about events of the first century. Cassius Dio is most likely not only the first author to mention the Alamanni but also the last one to record a historical appearance of the Chatti. Writing about the Germanic war of Caracalla in 213 , he has the emperor fight &quot;Κέννους, Kελτικòν ἔθνος&quot; (&quot;the Kenni, a Celtic people&quot;). This is taken from an excerpt of Dio in the writings of Joannes Xiphilinus, however, whereas the Fragmenta Valesiana refer to the same people as &quot;Chattoi&quot;. The usage of &quot;Kελτικός&quot; for Germanic peoples was an archaic tradition among Greek writers.

After Cassius Dio, the name &quot;Chattus&quot; appears among others in a panegyric by Sidonius Apollinaris in the late fifth century, now as a poetic synonym for &quot;Germanus&quot;. The last ancient source to mention the Chatti, if only in a quotation of Sulpicius Alexander describing events of the late fourth century, was Gregory of Tours.

Allegedly the Chatti were associated with the legendary &quot;First King of the Franks&quot;. The story is told of the election of the first Frankish king. The much later &quot;Liber Historiæ Francorum&quot; says that after the death of Sunno, his brother Marcomer, leader of the Ampsivarii and Chatti, proposed to the Franks that they should have one single king, contrary to their tradition. The &quot;Liber&quot; adds that Pharamond, named as Marcomer&#x27;s son, was chosen as this first king (thus beginning the tradition of long-haired kings of the Franks), and then states that when he died, his son Chlodio [428 AD] was raised up as the next king. The work says no more of him.

The Chatti eventually may in any case have become a branch of the much larger neighboring Franks and their region was incorporated in the kingdom of Clovis I, probably with the Ripuarians, at the beginning of the sixth century.

The Chatti name is apparently preserved in the medieval and modern name of Hesse in Germany, which is a name that already appears early. In 723 for example, the Anglo-Saxon missionary Winfrid—subsequently called St. Boniface, Apostle of the Germans—proselytizing among the Hessians (Hessorum), felled their sacred tree, Thor&#x27;s Oak, near Fritzlar, as part of his efforts to convert them and other Germanic tribes to Christianity.

==19th Century usage==

At the Congress of Vienna the Elector of Hesse, restored with the fall of Napoleon, unsuccessfully attempted to get recognized as &quot;King of the Chatti&quot; - though by then the Chatti had long since ceased to exist as a distinct ethnic group 

==Chasuarii and Chattuarii==
Two tribes in northern Germany have names that are sometimes compared to the Chatti. The Chattuarii, whose name appears to mean that they are dwellers upon the Chatti lands, or else Chatti people, lived near the Rhine, probably between IJssel and Lippe. They came to be seen as Franks and apparently moved over the Rhine as a Frankish people, to settle into the corner of land between the Rhine and Maas rivers.

The name of the Chattuarii is in turn, sometimes compared to another people called the Chasuarii mentioned by several classical authors. The Chasuarii were a Germanic tribe mentioned by Tacitus in the &quot;Germania&quot;. According to him, they dwelt to the north of the Chamavi and Angrivarii, who dwelt in turn to the north of the Bructeri, between Ems and Weser, however the name of the Chasuarii most often is interpreted to mean &quot;dwellers on the Hase [river]&quot;, a tributary to the Ems. The second century geographer Claudius Ptolemy mentions that the Kasouarioi lived to the east of the Abnoba mountains, in the vicinity of Hesse, but this account of northern Europe is thought to contain confusions derived from using different sources.

== Places named after the Chatti ==
* Hesse: probably derived from &quot;Chatti&quot; through the High German consonant shifts.
* Kassel: derived from the ancient &quot;Castellum Cattorum&quot;, a castle of the Chatti
* Katwijk: from Chatti and Dutch &quot;wijk&quot;, &quot;village/settlement&quot;
* Katzenelnbogen: historians speculated that the name derives from *&quot;Cattimelibocus&quot;, a combination of two words: the Chatti and &quot;Melibokus&quot;, from &quot;Μηλίβοκον&quot; (Mēlíbokon), the name of a mountain range in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geography&quot; which has been (probably incorrectly) identified with the Malchen. 
* Mont des Cats

==In popular culture==
* &quot;The Light Bearer&quot; (1994), a historical novel by Donna Gillespie.
* &quot;Mark of the Lion Series&quot; (1993), a series of historical fiction novels by Francine Rivers.
* &quot;Barbarians&quot; (2020), one of the tribes that unites against the Romans prior to the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest.

<text>Warren Sturgis McCulloch (November 16, 1898 – September 24, 1969) was an American neuropsychologist and cybernetician known for his work on the foundation for certain brain theories and his contribution to the cybernetics movement. Along with Walter Pitts, McCulloch created computational models based on mathematical algorithms called threshold logic which split the inquiry into two distinct approaches, one approach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence.

== Biography ==
Warren Sturgis McCulloch was born in Orange, New Jersey, in 1898. His brother was a chemical engineer and Warren was originally planning to join the Christian ministry. As a teenager he was associated with the theologians Henry Sloane Coffin, Harry Emerson Fosdick, Herman Karl Wilhelm Kumm and Julian F. Hecker. He was also mentored by the Quaker Rufus Jones. He attended Haverford College then studied philosophy and psychology at Yale University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1921. He continued to study psychology at Columbia and received a Master of Arts degree in 1923. Receiving his MD in 1927 from the Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York, he undertook an internship at Bellevue Hospital, New York. Then he worked under Eilhard von Domarus at the Rockland State Hospital for the Insane. He returned to academia in 1934. He worked at the Laboratory for Neurophysiology at Yale University from 1934 to 1941.

In 1941 he moved to Chicago and joined the Department of Psychiatry at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where he was a professor of psychiatry, as well as the director of the Illinois Neuropsychiatric Institute until 1951. From 1952 he worked at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts with Norbert Wiener. He was a founding member of the American Society for Cybernetics and its second president during 1967–1968. He was a mentor to the British operations research pioneer Stafford Beer.

McCulloch had a range of interests and talents. In addition to his scientific contributions he wrote poetry (sonnets), and he designed and engineered buildings and a dam at his farm in Old Lyme, Connecticut.

McCulloch married Ruth Metzger, known as &#x27;Rook&#x27;, in 1924 and they had three children. He died in Cambridge in 1969.

== Work ==
He is remembered for his work with Joannes Gregorius Dusser de Barenne from Yale and later with Walter Pitts from the University of Chicago. He provided the foundation for certain brain theories in a number of classic papers, including &quot;&quot;A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity&quot; (1943) and &quot;How We Know Universals: The Perception of Auditory and Visual Forms&quot;&quot; (1947), both published in the &quot;Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics&quot;. The former is &quot;widely credited with being a seminal contribution to neural network theory, the theory of automata, the theory of computation, and cybernetics&quot;.

McCulloch was the chair of the set of Macy conferences dedicated to Cybernetics. These, greatly due to the diversity of the backgrounds of the participants McCulloch brought in, became the foundation for the field.

In (1948), he recounted an event in the spring of 1947, when McCulloch designed a machine to allow the blind to read, by converting printed letters to tones. He designed it so that the tone is invariant for the same letter viewed under different angles. Gerhardt von Bonin saw the design, and immediately asked, &quot; Is this a diagram of the fourth layer of the visual cortex of the brain?&quot;.

In his last days in 1960s, he worked on loops, oscillations and triadic relations with Moreno-Díaz; the reticular formation with Kilmer and dynamic models of memory with Da Fonseca. His work in the 1960s was summarized in a 1968 paper.

=== Neuroscience ===
He studied the excitation of the brain by strychnine neuronography, which was a method to map brain connections. Applying strychnine in one point of the brain causes excitations in different points of the brain. Bailey, Bonin, and McCulloch conducted a series of studies in the 1940s that identified connections in the brains of macaque and chimpanzee that are consistent with modern understanding of VOF.

=== Mathematical logic ===
In 1919 he began to work mainly on mathematical logic, and by 1923 he attempted to make a logic of transitive verbs. His goal in psychology is to invent a &quot;psychon&quot; or &quot;least psychic event&quot; that are binary atomic events with necessary causes, such that they can be combined to create complex logical propositions concerning their antecedents. He noticed in 1929 that these may correspond to the all-or-nothing firings of neurons in the brain.

In the 1943 paper, they described how memories can be formed by a neural network with loops in it, or alterable synapses. These then encodes for sentences like &quot;There was some x such that x was a ψ&quot; or formula_1, and showed that looped neural networks can encode all first-order logic with equality and conversely, any looped neural networks is equivalent to a sentence in first-order logic with equality, thus showing that they are equivalent in logical expressiveness.

The 1943 paper describes neural networks operating over time, and logical universals -- &quot;there exists&quot; and &quot;for all&quot;—for spatial objects, such as geometric figures, was further developed in their 1947 paper.

He worked with Manuel Blum in studying how a neural network can be &quot;logically stable&quot;, that is, can implement a boolean function even if the activation thresholds of individual neurons are varied. They were inspired by the problem of how the brain can perform the same functions, such as breathing, under influence of caffeine or alcohol, which shifts the activation threshold over the entire brain.

He worked on triadic relations, an extension of the calculus of relations to handle relations that relates 3 objects, such as &quot;A gives B to C&quot; or &quot;A perceives B to be C&quot;. He was convinced that such a logic is necessary for understanding brain activity.

=== How we know universals ===
In the 1947 paper &quot;How we know universals&quot;, they studied the problem of recognizing objects despite changes in representation. For example, recognizing a square under different viewing angles and lighting conditions, or recognizing a phoneme under different loudness and tones. That is, recognizing objects invariant under the action of some symmetry group. This problem was partly inspired by a practical problem in designing a machine for the blind to read (recounted in Wiener&#x27;s &quot;Cybernetics&quot;, see before).

The paper proposed two solutions. The first is in computing an invariant by averaging over the symmetry group. Let the symmetry group be formula_2 and the object to be recognized be formula_3. Let a neural network implement a function formula_4. Then, the group-invariant representation would be formula_5, the group-action average. The second solution is in a negative feedback circuit that drives a canonical representation. Consider the problem of recognizing whether an object is a square. The circuit moves the eye so that the &quot;center of gravity of brightness&quot; of the object is moved to the middle of the visual field. This then effectively converts each object into a canonical representation, which can then be compared with a representation in the brain.

=== Neural network modelling ===
In the 1943 paper McCulloch and Pitts attempted to demonstrate that a Turing machine program could be implemented in a finite network of &quot;formal&quot; neurons (in the event, the Turing Machine contains their model of the brain, but the converse is not true), that the neuron was the base logic unit of the brain. In the 1947 paper they offered approaches to designing &quot;nervous nets&quot; to recognize visual inputs despite changes in orientation or size.

From 1952 McCulloch worked at the Research Laboratory of Electronics at MIT, working primarily on neural network modelling. His team examined the visual system of the frog in consideration of McCulloch&#x27;s 1947 paper, discovering that the eye provides the brain with information that is already, to a degree, organized and interpreted, instead of simply transmitting an image.

With Roberto Moreno-Díaz, he studied a formalized problem of memory. Given that neural networks can story memory by a pattern of oscillations in a circle, they studied the number of possible oscillation patterns that can be sustained by some neural network with formula_6 neurons. This came out to be formula_7 (Schnabel, 1966). Also, they proved a universality theorem, in that for each formula_6, there exists a neural network (possibly with more than formula_6 neurons) with formula_10 binary inputs, such that, for any oscillation pattern realizable by some neural network with formula_6 neurons, there exists a binary input for this universal network such that it exhibits the same pattern.

=== Control ===
McCulloch considered the problem of contradictory information and motives, which he called a &quot;heterarchy&quot; of motives, meaning that the motives are not linearly ordered, but can be ordered like formula_12. He posited the concept of &quot;poker chip&quot; reticular formations as to how the brain deals with contradictory information in a democratic, somatotopical neural network. Specifically, how the brain can commit the animal to a single course of action when the situation is ambiguous.

They designed a prototypic example neural network &quot;RETIC&quot;, with &quot;12 anastomatically coupled modules stacked in columnar array&quot;, which can switch between unambiguous stable modes based on ambiguous inputs.

His principle of &quot;Redundancy of Potential Command&quot; was developed by von Foerster and Pask in their study of self-organization and by Pask in his Conversation Theory and Interactions of Actors Theory.

<doc id="44510" wikidata="Q193869" url="?curid=44510" title="Childeric I">
<text>Childeric I (died 481 AD) was a Frankish leader in the northern part of imperial Roman Gaul and a member of the Merovingian dynasty, described as a king (Latin &quot;rex&quot;), both on his Roman-style seal ring, which was buried with him, and in fragmentary later records of his life. He was father of Clovis I, who acquired effective control over all or most Frankish kingdoms, and a significant part of Roman Gaul.

==Biography==
Most of early Merovingian history is based on the account of the 6th-century Gregory of Tours. The date of Childeric&#x27;s accession is not given in the text, but it was after emperor Avitus&#x27; death in December 456 (II. 11). The only certain date is the Battle of Vouillé in 507; most of Gregory&#x27;s other statements are contradictory.

Childeric&#x27;s father is recorded by several sources to have been Merovech, after whom the dynasty is named. Gregory (II.9) says that Merovech was reputed by some to be a descendant of Chlodio, an earlier Frankish king who had conquered Gaulish areas first in the Silva Carbonaria, then in Tournai, Cambrai and as far south as the Somme. This is roughly the definition of the Roman province of &quot;Belgica Secunda&quot; (approximately the &quot;Belgium&quot; defined by Julius Caesar centuries earlier, the region stretching from north of Paris to the Flemish coast); later, a letter of Saint Remigius to Childeric&#x27;s son Clovis I implies that Childeric had been its administrative chief.

Childeric himself is mainly associated with Roman military actions around the Loire River involving the Gallo-Roman general Aegidius. According to Gregory (II.12), Childeric was exiled to &quot;Thuringia&quot; for eight years due to Frankish distaste for his debauchery and his seduction of his subjects&#x27; daughters. In the meantime, according to Gregory, Aegidius himself took up the title of king of the Franks. Upon his return from exile, Childeric joined his host&#x27;s wife, Queen Basina, who bore their son Clovis.

Guy Halsall connects the story to Roman politics, Aegidius being an appointee of Majorian:

Halsall (p. 269) speculates that Childeric probably began a Roman military career in the service of Flavius Aetius who defeated Attila in Gaul, and he points out that much of his military career appears to have played out far from the Frankish homelands. Ulrich Nonn (map p. 37, and pp. 99–100), following his teacher Eugen Ewig, believes that the exile story reflects a real sequence of events whereby Childeric was a leader of &quot;Salian&quot; or &quot;Belgian&quot; Franks based in the Romanized areas conquered by Chlodio, who were allies under the lordship of Aegidius, but eventually able to take over his power when he and his imperial patron died. (Childeric&#x27;s son Clovis I later fought Aegidius&#x27; son Syagrius who was remembered as a King of Romans, and who had control of Soissons in the south of &quot;Belgica Secunda&quot;.)

In a passage normally considered to have come from a lost collection of annals, Gregory (II.18) gives a sequence of events which are very difficult to interpret. In 463 Childeric and Aegidius successfully repelled the Visigoths of Theodoric II from Orléans on the Loire. After the death of Aegidius soon after, Childeric and a &quot;comes&quot; (&quot;count&quot;) Paul are recorded defending the Loire region from Saxon raiders, who were possibly coordinating with the Goths now under Euric. Childeric and Paul fought Saxons under the command of a leader named &quot;Adovacrius&quot; (sometimes given by modern authors in either an Anglo-Saxon spelling form, Eadwacer, or in a spelling the same as used for his contemporary the future King of Italy Odoacer, with whom he is sometimes equated). The origin of these &quot;Saxons&quot; is however unclear, and they are described as being based upon islands somewhere in the Loire region.
Soon after this passage, Gregory of Tours (II.19) reports that Childeric coordinated with &quot;Odovacrius&quot;, this time normally assumed to be the King of Italy, against Allemanni who had entered Italy. While some authors interpret these Allemani to be Alans, a people established in the Loire region in this period. There is no consensus on this however, because the reference in this case is not apparently to events near the Loire.

==Marriage, children, and death==
Gregory of Tours, in his &quot;History of the Franks&quot;, mentions several siblings of Clovis within his narrative, apparently thus children of Childeric:
#Clovis I (died 511), whose mother was Basina.
#Audofleda, Queen of the Ostrogoths, wife of Theodoric the Great. Gregory III.31 also mentions their daughter Amalasuntha.
#Lanthechild. Gregory II.31 mentions she had been an Arian but converted to Catholicism with Clovis.
#Albofleda (died approximately 500). Gregory II.31 mentions that she died soon after being baptized with Clovis.

Childeric is generally considered to have died in 481 or 482 based on Gregory&#x27;s reports that his son Clovis died in 511 and had ruled 30 years.

==Tomb==
Childeric&#x27;s tomb was discovered in 1653 not far from the 12th-century church of Saint-Brice in Tournai, now in Belgium. Numerous precious objects were found, including jewels of gold and garnet cloisonné, gold coins, a gold bull&#x27;s head, and a ring with the king&#x27;s name inscribed. Some 300 golden winged insects (usually viewed as bees or cicadas) were also found which had been placed on the king&#x27;s cloak. Archduke Leopold William, governor of the Southern Netherlands (today&#x27;s Belgium), had the find published in Latin. The treasure went first to the Habsburgs in Vienna, then as a gift to King Louis XIV of France, who was not impressed with the treasure and stored it in the royal library, which became the Bibliothèque Nationale de France during the Revolution.

On the night of November 5–6, 1831, the treasure of Childeric was among 80 kg of treasure stolen from the Library and melted down for the gold. A few pieces were retrieved from where they had been hidden in the Seine, including two of the bees. The record of the treasure, however, now exists only in the fine engravings made at the time of its discovery and in some reproductions made for the Habsburgs.

===Origin of Napoleonic bees===

When Napoleon was looking for a heraldic symbol to trump the Capetian fleur-de-lys, he settled on Childeric&#x27;s bees as symbols of the French Empire. The minutes of a meeting of the &quot;Conseil d&#x27;État&quot; held at Saint-Cloud in June 1804 suggest that it approved the symbolism of the bees on a suggestion by Cambacérès. The design was made by Vivant Denon, Director of the Louvre.

<text>Year 437 ([[Roman numerals|CDXXXVII]]) was a common year starting on Friday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of [[Flavius Aetius (magister militum)|Aetius]] and [[Sigisvultus]] (or, less frequently, year 1190 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 437 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===

==== Europe ====
* Flavius Aetius, Roman general (&quot;magister militum&quot;), secures the besieged city of Narbonne (Southern Gaul) against King Theodoric I. He concludes a peace treaty with the Visigoths, and becomes consul for the second time.
* July 2 – Valentinian III, age 18, rules as emperor over the Western Roman Empire. His mother Galla Placidia ends her regency, but continues to exercise political influence until her death in 450.
* October 29 – Valentinian III cements an alliance with the eastern emperor, Theodosius II, by marrying his daughter Licinia Eudoxia in Constantinople. This marks the reunion of the two branches of the House of Theodosius.
* Battle of Wallop: Ambrosius Aurelianus, leader of the Romano-British, defeats the Anglo Saxons under King Vortigern. He is given all the kingdoms of the western side of Britain (according to &quot;Historia Brittonum&quot;).

==== Mesoamerica ====
* K&#x27;inich Yax K&#x27;uk&#x27; Mo&#x27; dies after an 11-year reign. He is the founder and first ruler of the pre-Columbian Maya civilization centered at Copán (modern Honduras).

=== By topic ===

==== Religion ====
* A synod at Constantinople attempts to impinge on the Pope&#x27;s rights in Illyria. Proclus tries to implement the synod&#x27;s decisions, and Pope Sixtus III reminds the Illyrian bishops of their obligations to his vicar at Thessaloniki.
&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

<text>There are 23 national parks in Poland. These were formerly run by the Polish Board of National Parks (Polish: &quot;Krajowy Zarząd Parków Narodowych&quot;), but in 2004 responsibility for their management was transferred to what is now the Ministry of Climate and the Environment. Most national parks are divided into strictly and partially protected zones. They currently encompass around 186000 hectares of forest, or around 2% of all the country&#x27;s woodlands.

Polish national parks have carried out numerous research programs and they play an important role in the ecological education. The national parks can be visited as they provide a well-developed tourism infrastructure, though visitors typically need to keep to designated areas such as trails. Many parks furthermore offer thematic trails, educational centres and natural history museums.

== Legal basis and governance of Poland&#x27;s national parks ==
In order to become a national park, an area needs to be at least 1000 hectares in size and have outstanding environmental and cultural value. The ecosystems in the park need to be in their natural state—or close to it. National parks usually play host to several &quot;valuable&quot; species; usually rare or protected ones.

The area of a national park is divided into different zones using separate methods of conservation. There are strict protection zones, as well as active and landscape-related ones. Additionally, they are usually surrounded by a protective buffer zone called &quot;otulina&quot;. Human activity is also heavily restricted within the park itself, with strict conservation rules in place. There are also significant restrictions on what can be done within the buffer zones.

Poland&#x27;s national parks are governed by the Nature Conservation Act, last amended in 2004, and they are funded from the central state budget. Each park is managed by a director, who works closely with an oversight board. They are further supervised by the Ministry of Climate and Environment.

<doc id="44513" wikidata="Q29013" url="?curid=44513" title="Chow Chow">
<text>The Chow Chow is a spitz-type of dog breed originally from Northern China. The Chow Chow is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull and small, triangular, erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for a very dense double coat that is either smooth or rough. The fur is particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive ruff or mane appearance. The coat may be shaded/self-red, black, blue, cinnamon/fawn, or cream.

== History ==

The Chow Chow has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern breeds in the 19th century. A research study has concluded that the Chow Chow dog breed originated from other indigenous dogs in central China about 8,300 years ago. The ancient breed evolved and manifests both morphological and physiological features, including its dark tongue, coat of fur, and stronger build.

One Chinese legend mentions large war dogs from Central Asia that resembled black-tongued lions. One Chinese ruler was said to own 5,000 Chows. The Chinese also used Chows to pull dog sleds through swampy terrain, and this was remarked upon by Marco Polo.

Today, the American Kennel Club registers approximately 10,000 Chow Chows a year. The Canadian Kennel Club registers approximately 350.

The English name &quot;Chow Chow&quot; is unlinked to any Chinese name such as the modern 鬆獅狗 (&quot;song shi gou&quot;, lit. &quot;loose lion dog&quot;) for the breed, and hence of uncertain origin - possible and folk etymologies refer to Pidgin English.

== Appearance ==

The Chow Chow is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull and small, triangular, erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for a very dense double coat that is either smooth or rough. The fur is particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive ruff or mane appearance. The coat may be shaded/self-red, black, blue, cinnamon/fawn, or cream.
Not all these color varieties are recognized as valid in all countries. Individuals with patchy or multicolored coats are considered to be outside the breed standard.
Chow Chow eyes are typically deep set and almond shaped. The breed is unique by their purple/blue-black tongue which no other breed has except Shar Pei, and has very straight hind legs, resulting in a rather stilted gait. The bluish color extends to the Chow Chow&#x27;s lips; this is the only dog breed with this distinctive bluish color in its lips and oral cavity (other dogs have black or a piebald pattern skin in their mouths). Another distinctive feature is the curly tail. It has thick hair and lies curled on its back. The nose should be black, but blue-coated Chow Chow can have a solid blue or slate-colored nose. According to the American Kennel Club breed standards, any other tone is not acceptable for contests. FCI countries, however, do allow a self-colored nose in the cream.

The blue-black/purple tongue gene appears to be dominant, as most mixed breed dogs that come from a Chow Chow retain that tongue color. However, the blue-black/purple tongue can also be found on the Shar Pei. This is not to say that every mixed breed dog with spots of purple on the tongue is descended from Chow Chow, as purple spots on the tongue can be found on other purebred dogs.

== Temperament ==
Owning a Chow Chow can raise the cost of homeowners&#x27; insurance because some companies consider them high-risk dogs. In a study in the &quot;Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association&quot;, Chow Chow were responsible for 8 out of 238 fatalities related to dog bites from 1979 to 1998.

== Colors ==
Chow Chows can come in a variety of coat colors. The American Kennel Club (AKC) has classified Chow Chow colors as either standard or non-standard (rare colors). The standard colors for Chow Chows are black, blue, red, cream, and cinnamon. However, colors such as fawn, white, and merle are not considered standard for this breed.

Different canine clubs worldwide may acknowledge different coat colors or even use alternative names for the colors mentioned above.

== Health ==
A UK study found the life expectancy of the Chow Chow to be 12.1 years, just higher than the 12 year average for crossbreeds and lower than the 12.7 years average for purebreeds.

===Skeletal conditions===
A North American study looking at more than a million records of dogs found 6.44% of Chow Chow dogs to have hip dysplasia compared with 3.52% overall. The study also found 4.3% of Chow Chow dogs to have cranial cruciate ligament deficiency compared to 2.52% overall.

Another North American study looking at more than 250,000 elbow scans found the Chow Chow to have the highest prevalence of elbow dysplasia, with 48.6% of dogs over the age of 2 having elbow dysplasia.

===Ophthalmological conditions===
A North American study looking at glaucoma in dog breeds found the Chow Chow to have the third highest prevalence with 4.7% of Chow Chow dogs having glaucoma compared to 0.89% overall.

===Dermatological conditions===
A study looking at records from a small animal clinic at the University of Montreal found the Chow Chow to be predisposed to alopecia X.

A review of studies in Australia found the Chow Chow to be prediposed to atopic dermatitis with a 7.1 odds ratio.

A US case study found a predisposition to pemphigus foliaceus with an odds ratio of 12.3.

A breed specific mutation causing tyrosinase deficiency which results in leukotrichia exists in the Chow Chow.
===Gastrointestinal conditions===
A UK study looking at exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in breeds found the Chow Chow to be predisposed to the condition.

===Neoplastic conditions===
An Austrian case series found an odds ratio of 23.53 for contracting stomach cancer.

A US study looking at cases of oral melanoma found the breed to be over-represented with an odds ratio of 7.89.

===Reproductive conditions===
In a Belgian study Chow Chow bitches made up 6.4% of cases of pyometra despite the breed making up 1.6% of the population. Pyometra was found to be more extreme in the breed with anaemia and endotoxaemia reported.

===Other conditions===
The Chow Chow can suffer from diabetes mellitus, and gastric cancer. Chow Chows are a high risk breed for autoimmune disease.
== Notable dogs ==
Sigmund Freud had a Chow Chow named Jo-Fi Ling who attended all of his therapy sessions because he felt that dogs had a special sense that allows them to judge a person&#x27;s character accurately, and admitted he depended on Jo-Fi for an assessment of a patient&#x27;s mental state.

U.S. Navy admiral George Dewey acquired a Chow Chow in Hong Kong in 1898 and named it Bob. Bob rarely left the admiral&#x27;s side and had the run of the cruiser . Bob died in 1899 from eating chocolates given to Dewey by well-wishers upon &quot;Olympia&quot;″s arrival in New York City.

Walt Disney and his wife, Lillian Disney, had a Chow Chow named Sunnee. It was the couple&#x27;s first dog. Allegedly, Walt gifted Lilly the Chow Chow inside a hat box, which inspired the scene in Lady and the Tramp where Lady is gifted in the same way.

<text>Mahikeng (Tswana for &quot;Place of Rocks&quot;), formerly known as Mafikeng and alternatively known as Mafeking (, ), is the capital city of the North West province of South Africa.

Close to South Africa&#x27;s border with Botswana, Mafikeng is northeast of Cape Town and west of Johannesburg. In 2001 it had a population of 49,300. In 2007 Mafikeng was reported to have a population of 250,000, of which the CBD constituted between 69,000 and 75,000. It is built on the open veld at an elevation of , by the banks of the Upper Molopo River. The Madibi goldfields are some south of the town.

==History==
===Establishment===
Molema&#x27;s town was founded by Molema Tawana (c. 1822 – January 1882).

In 1857 Molema led an advance guard to scout out the area along the Molopo River. This was a familiar area as they had previously lived in nearby Khunwana. Molema settled a town known in its early years as &quot;Molema&#x27;s town&quot;, while the main body of the Barolong under Montshiwa followed. But Montshiwa did not feel safe at Mafikeng due to the close presence and encroachment of the Boers in the Transvaal. He led his followers to Moshaneng in the territory of the Bangwaketse in present-day Botswana.

Molema remained at Mafikeng to ensure that the Barolong retained a presence there. Several of Montshiwa&#x27;s other brothers were also stationed at crucial sites in the proximity of the Molopo. Molema had to use all his diplomatic skills on several occasions to prevent Boer incursion and settlement near Mafikeng. He has been described as a man of &quot;strong personality and exceptional gifts...and Montshiwa&#x27;s chief counsellor in vital matters&quot;. (S.M Molema: 35) After negotiations with Molema, Montshiwa decided to return to Mafikeng in 1876.

Molema was a firm believer in Western education, having attended Healdtown; he opened a school for the Barolong once they had settled in the district. Molema became a farmer and businessman, as well as advising his brother Montshiwa. He died in 1882. One of his sons, Silas Molema, became a Doctor and historian of the Barolong. (see S.M. Molema). Later British settlers spelled the name as &quot;Mafeking&quot;. The Jameson Raid started from Pitsani Pothlugo (or Potlogo) north of Mafeking on December 29, 1895.

For most of the 19th century (1800s), Mafeking appeared in Southern African maps as a part of Bechuanaland, a territory consisting of Tswana tribal territories, stretching from the Bangwato of Khama in present-day Botswana to the Batlhaping in present-day South Africa&#x27;s Northern Cape and North West provinces.

Bechuanaland was ruled by Paramount Chiefs of the Tswana groups such as the Barolong, Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bahurutshe, Batlhaping and the Bangwato who under Sekgoma I and Khama III stretched Tswana lands further north to close to present day Zimbabwe and Zambia territories.

The Tswana chieftains had ruled Bechuanaland on the advice of Congregational missionaries of the London Missionary Society, including Robert Moffat who was stationed at Kuruman among the Batlhaping and David Livingstone who was based among Sechele&#x27;s Bakwena at Kolobeng close to present day Gaborone, Botswana; the Methodist missionaries of the Wesleyan Missionary Society among the Barolong; and the Lutheran Hermannsburg Missionary Society among the Bakwena ba ga Mogopa.

In 1852, the Boers of the Transvaal invaded Bechuanaland but were defeated by a Tswana army led by Sechele I (Setshele) of the Bakwena ba ga Sechele at Dimawe in present-day Botswana during the Battle of Dimawe of 1852.

The Boers of the Transvaal would successfully invade Bechuanaland 30 years later in 1882 establishing the Republic of Stellaland and State of Goshen around present day Vryburg and surrounding areas in 1882 to 1883. Stellaland and Goshen unified as the United States of Stellaland in 1883 to 1885.

In response, British Congregational missionary John MacKenzie of the London Missionary Society stationed among the Bangwato at Shoshong advised Tswana Paramount Chiefs to seek British protection.

This led to the Warren expedition of December 1884 to mid 1885, where the British sent 4000 troops from the Cape Colony led by Major General Charles Warren, repelling Boer and German encroachment into Bechuanaland and dissolving Stellaland and Goshen.

Bechuanaland was proclaimed a British protectorate, with Mafeking as the capital. But Bechuanaland was later divided into two; separating Tswana lands along the Molopo and Nossob rivers-those to the north, Bechuanaland Protectorate, remained a British protectorate, eventually gaining independence in 1966 as the republic of Botswana.

Those lands to the south of the Molopo, now part of present-day South Africa&#x27;s North-West and Northern Cape provinces, including Mafikeng, became British Bechuanaland, a short-lived colony later handed to the Cape Colony. In 1910, the Cape Colony unified with Natal, the Transvaal and Orange Free State to found the Union of South Africa.

Even after the division of Bechuanaland which placed Mafeking outside of the Bechuanaland Protectorate, Mafeking remained the capital of Bechuanaland Protectorate (present day Botswana) until Gaborone was established in 1965.

===Siege of Mafeking===

At the outbreak of the Second Boer War in 1899, the town was besieged by the Boer. The Siege of Mafeking lasted 217 days from October 1899 to May 1900, and turned Robert Baden-Powell into a national hero. In 1900, the British built a concentration camp in Mafeking to house Boer women and children. In September 1904, Lord Roberts unveiled an obelisk at Mafeking bearing the names of those who fell in defence of the town. British losses during the siege were 212 people killed, soldiers and civilians, and more than 600 wounded. Boer losses were significantly higher.

===Incorporation into Bophuthatswana===
Although it was outside the protectorate&#x27;s borders, Mafeking served as capital of the Bechuanaland Protectorate from 1894 until 1965, when Gaborone was made the capital of what was to become Botswana. Mafeking also briefly served as capital of the Bantustan of Bophuthatswana in the 1970s, before the adjoining town of Mmabatho was established as capital when Bophuthatswana became nominally independent in 1977.

Following a local referendum, Mafeking joined Bophuthatswana in 1980 and was renamed &quot;Mafikeng&quot;. The town was treated as a suburb of Mmabatho.

===Capital of North-West Province===
Following the end of apartheid in 1994, Bophuthatswana was formally reincorporated into South Africa. With that, the merged Mafikeng and Mmabatho became capital of the new North-West Province under the name Mafikeng. In February 2010, Lulu Xingwana, the Minister of Arts and Culture changed the town&#x27;s name to Mahikeng.

==Name==
The name Mahikeng means &quot;the place of rocks&quot; in the classic Setswana language of the people of the North West province of South Africa and the surrounding country of Botswana. However, the city is commonly pronounced as Mafikeng, in the vernacular of the Batswana people of Mmabatho. Historically it was also known as Mafeking, and is still referred to as such historiographically in the context of the Siege of Mafeking and Relief of Mafeking during the Boer War.

In February 2010, Lulu Xingwana, the Minister of Arts and Culture, approved the town&#x27;s name to be changed again to &quot;Mahikeng&quot;. Despite this the town&#x27;s ANC-run local government and most local residents still refer to the town as Mafikeng both informally and formally.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://mg.co.za/article/2011-08-09-old-south-africa-collides-with-new-in-city-names&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahikeng literally means “place among rocks”. It refers to volcanic rocks that provided temporary shelter for Stone Age humans in order to more easily hunt animals drinking water in the Molopo River.

<doc id="44515" wikidata="Q415054" url="?curid=44515" title="Acadians">
<text>The Acadians (; , ) are an ethnic group descended from the French who settled in the New France colony of Acadia during the 17th and 18th centuries.

Today, most descendants of Acadians live in either the Northern American region of Acadia, where descendants of Acadians who escaped the Expulsion of the Acadians (a.k.a. The Great Upheaval / &quot;Le Grand Dérangement&quot;) re-settled, or in Louisiana, where thousands of Acadians moved in the late 1700s. Descendants of the Louisiana Acadians are most commonly known as Cajuns, the anglicized term of &quot;Acadian.&quot; 

Most Acadians in Canada continue to live in majority French-speaking communities, notably those in New Brunswick where Acadians and Francophones are granted autonomy in areas such as education and health.
In some cases, Acadians intermarried with Indigenous Peoples, in particular, the Mi&#x27;kmaq. Some Louisiana Cajuns continue to speak Louisiana French, but most have been primarily anglophone since the mid-20th century.

Acadia was one of the five regions of New France. Acadia was located in what is now Eastern Canada&#x27;s Maritime provinces, as well as parts of Quebec and present-day Maine to the Kennebec River. It was ethnically, geographically and administratively different from the other French colonies such as the French colony of Canada. As a result, the Acadians developed a distinct history and culture. The settlers whose descendants became Acadians primarily came from the west-central region of France, such as the rural areas of Poitou-Charentes.

During the French and Indian War, (known in Canada as The Seven Years&#x27; War) British colonial officers suspected that Acadians were aligned with France, after finding some Acadians fighting alongside French troops at Fort Beauséjour. Though most Acadians remained neutral during the war, the British, together with New England legislators and militia, carried out the Great Expulsion (Le Grand Dérangement) of the Acadians between 1755 and 1764. They forcefully deported approximately 11,500 Acadians from the maritime region. Approximately one-third perished from disease and drowning. 
In retrospect, the result has been described as an ethnic cleansing of the Acadians from Maritime Canada.

Acadians speak a variety of French called Acadian French, which has a few regional accents (for example, Chiac in the southeast of New Brunswick, or Brayon in the northwest of New Brunswick). Most can also speak English. The Louisiana Cajun descendants tend to speak English, including Cajun English or Louisiana French, a relative of Acadian French from Canada.

Estimates of contemporary Acadian populations vary widely. The Canadian census of 2006 reported only 96,145 Acadians in Canada, based on self-declared ethnic identity. 
However, the Canadian Encyclopedia estimates that there are at least 500,000 of Acadian ancestry in Canada, which would include many who declared their ethnic identity for the census as French or as Canadian.

==Pre-deportation history==


During the early 17th century, about 60 French families were established in Acadia. They developed relations with the peoples of the Wabanaki Confederacy (particularly the regional Mi&#x27;kmaq). The Acadians lived mainly in the coastal regions of the Bay of Fundy; they reclaimed farming land from the sea by building dikes to control water and drain certain wetlands.

Living in a contested borderland region between French Canada and the British territories on New England and the coast, the Acadians often became entangled in the conflict between the powers. Their competition in Europe played out in North America as well. Over a period of 74 years, six wars (the four French and Indian Wars, Father Rale&#x27;s War, and Father Le Loutre&#x27;s War) took place in Acadia and Nova Scotia, in which the Wabanaki Confederacy and some Acadians fought to keep the British from taking over the region. While France lost political control of Acadia in 1713, the Mí&#x27;kmaq did not concede land to the British. Along with Acadians, the Mi&#x27;kmaq used military force to resist the British. That was particularly evident in the early 1720s during Dummer&#x27;s War.

The British had conquered Acadia in 1710. Over the next 45 years, the Acadians refused to sign an unconditional oath of allegiance to Britain. Many were influenced by Father Jean-Louis Le Loutre, who from his arrival in 1738 until his capture in 1755, preached against the &quot;English devils&quot;. 
Father Le Loutre led the Acadian people during the Acadian Exodus, as an act of defiance towards British demands and oppression. Acadians took part in various militia operations against the British and maintained vital supply lines to the French Fortress of Louisbourg and Fort Beausejour. 
During the French and Indian War, the British sought to neutralize any military threat posed by the Acadians and to interrupt the vital supply lines which they provided to Louisbourg by making them sign an oath of allegiance to the crown.
The British founded the town of Halifax and fortified it in 1749 in order to establish a base against the French. The Mi&#x27;kmaq resisted the increased number of British (Protestant) settlements by making numerous raids on Halifax, Dartmouth, Lawrencetown, and Lunenburg. During the French and Indian War, the Mi&#x27;kmaq assisted the Acadians in resisting the British during the Expulsion of the Acadians.

Many Acadians might have signed an unconditional oath to the British monarchy had the circumstances been better, while other Acadians would not sign because it was religious oath which denied the Catholic faith because the British Monarch was head of the Church of England. 
Acadians had numerous reasons against signing an oath of loyalty to the British Crown. Acadian men feared that signing the oath would commit them to fighting against France during wartime. They also worried about whether their Mi&#x27;kmaq neighbours might perceive an oath as acknowledging the British claim to Acadia rather than that of the indigenous Mi&#x27;kmaq. Acadians believed that if they signed the oath, they might put their villages at risk of attack by the Mi&#x27;kmaq.

== Geographical distribution ==
Data from this section from Statistics Canada, 2021.

=== Provinces &amp; territories ===
Today about one third of the population of the officially bilingual province of New Brunswick speaks French as their mother tongue. The great majority of these are of Acadian ancestry, and there are also many Acadian institutions, organizations and cultural events.

In the Great Expulsion (known by French speakers as &quot;le Grand Dérangement&quot;), after the Battle of Fort Beauséjour beginning in August 1755 under Lieutenant Governor Lawrence, approximately 11,500 Acadians (three-quarters of the Acadian population in Nova Scotia) were expelled, families were separated, their lands and property confiscated, and in some cases their homes were burned. The Acadians were deported to separated locations throughout the British eastern seaboard colonies, from New England to Georgia, where many were put into forced labour, imprisoned, or put into servitude.

===Second Wave===
The British conducted a second and smaller expulsion of Acadians after taking control of the north shore of what is now New Brunswick. After the fall of Quebec and defeat of the French, the British lost interest in such relocations.

Some Acadians were deported to England, some to the Caribbean, and some to France. After being expelled to France, many Acadians were eventually recruited by the Spanish government to migrate to &quot;Luisiana&quot; (present-day Louisiana). These Acadians settled into or alongside the existing Louisiana Creole settlements, sometimes intermarrying with Creoles, and gradually developed what became known as Cajun culture.

===Louisiana Acadians===

After 1758, thousands were transported to France. Most of the Acadians who later went to Louisiana sailed there from France on five Spanish ships. These had been provided by the Spanish Crown, which was eager to populate their Louisiana colony with Catholic settlers who might provide farmers to supply the needs of New Orleans residents. The Spanish had hired agents to seek out the dispossessed Acadians in Brittany and kept this effort secret in order to avoid angering the French king. These new arrivals from France joined the earlier wave expelled from Acadia, and gradually their descendants developed the Cajun population (which included multiracial unions and children) and culture. They continued to be attached to French culture and language, and Catholicism.

The Spanish offered the Acadians lowlands along the Mississippi River in order to block British expansion from the east. Some would have preferred Western Louisiana, where many of their families and friends had settled. In addition, that land was more suitable to mixed crops of agriculture. Rebels among them marched to New Orleans and ousted the Spanish governor. The Spanish later sent infantry from other colonies to put down the rebellion and execute the leaders. After the rebellion in December 1769, Spanish Governor O&#x27;Reilly permitted the Acadians who had settled across the river from Natchez to resettle along the Iberville or Amite rivers closer to New Orleans.

===Returnees===

In time, some Acadians returned to the Maritime provinces of Canada, mainly to New Brunswick and coastal villages that were not occupied by colonists from New England.

The British prohibited them from resettling their lands and villages in what became Nova Scotia. A few of the Acadians in this area had evaded the British for several years, but the brutal winter weather eventually forced them to surrender. Some returnees settled in the region of Fort Sainte-Anne, now Fredericton, but were later displaced when the Crown awarded land grants to numerous United Empire Loyalists from the Thirteen Colonies after the victory of the United States in the American Revolution. Most of the descendants of Acadian returnees now live primarily on the eastern coast of New Brunswick, Canada.

In 2003, at the request of Acadian representatives, Queen Elizabeth II, Queen of Canada issued a Royal Proclamation acknowledging the deportation. She established 28 July as an annual day of commemoration, beginning in 2005. The day is called the &quot;Great Upheaval&quot; on some English-language calendars.

Before the American Revolutionary War, the Crown settled Protestant European immigrants and New England Planters in former Acadian communities and farmland. After the war, it made land grants in Nova Scotia to Loyalists. British policy was to establish a majority culture of Protestant religions and to assimilate Acadians with the local populations where they resettled.

==Geography==

The Acadians today live predominantly in the Canadian Maritime provinces (New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia), as well as parts of Quebec, Canada, and in Louisiana and Maine, United States.

In New Brunswick, Acadians inhabit the northern and eastern shores of New Brunswick. Other groups of Acadians can be found in the Magdalen Islands and the Gaspé Peninsula. Ethnic Acadian descendants still live in and around the area of Madawaska, Maine, where some of the Acadians first landed and settled in what is now known as the St. John Valley. There are also Acadians in Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia, at Chéticamp, Isle Madame, and Clare. East and West Pubnico, located at the end of the province, are the oldest regions that are predominantly ethnic Acadian.

Other ethnic Acadians can be found in the southern regions of New Brunswick, Western Newfoundland and in New England. Many of these communities have assimilated to varying degrees into the majority culture of English speakers. For many families in predominantly Anglophone communities, French-language attrition has occurred, particularly in younger generations.

The Acadians who settled in Louisiana after 1764 became known as Cajuns for the culture they developed. They have had a dominant cultural influence in many parishes, particularly in the southwestern area of the state, which is known as Acadiana.

==Culture==
Acadians are a vibrant minority, particularly in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada, and in Louisiana (Cajuns) and northern Maine, United States. Since 1994, &quot;Le Congrès Mondial Acadien&quot; has worked as an organization to unite these disparate communities and help preserve the culture.

In 1881, Acadians at the First Acadian National Convention, held in Memramcook, New Brunswick, designated 15 August, the Christian feast of the Assumption of Mary, as the national feast day of their community. On that day, the Acadians celebrate by having a &quot;tintamarre,&quot; a big parade and procession for which people dress up with the colors of Acadia and make a lot of noise and music.

The national anthem of the Acadians is &quot;Ave Maris Stella&quot;, adopted in 1884 at Miscouche, Prince Edward Island. The anthem was revised at the 1992 meeting of the Société Nationale de l&#x27;Acadie. The second, third and fourth verses were translated into French, with the first and last kept in the original Latin.

The Federation des Associations de Familles Acadiennes of New Brunswick and the Société Saint-Thomas d&#x27;Aquin of Prince Edward Island have resolved to commemorate 13 December annually as &quot;Acadian Remembrance Day&quot;, in memory of the sinking of the &quot;Duke William&quot; and of the nearly 2,000 Acadians deported from Ile-Saint Jean who died in 1758 while being deported across the North Atlantic: from hunger, disease and drowning. The event has been commemorated annually since 2004; participants mark the day by wearing a black star.

==Legacy==
American writer Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published &quot;Evangeline&quot;, an epic poem loosely based on the 1755 deportation. The poem became an American classic. Activists used it as a catalyst in reviving a distinct Acadian identity in both Maritime Canada and in Louisiana. Antonine Maillet&#x27;s novel &quot;Pélagie-la-charette&quot; concerns the return voyage to Acadia of several deported families, starting 15 years after the Great Expulsion.

In the early 20th century, two statues were made of the fictional figure of &quot;Evangeline&quot; to commemorate the Expulsion: one was installed in St. Martinville, Louisiana and the other in Grand-Pré, Nova Scotia. The Acadian Memorial (Monument Acadien) has an eternal flame; it honors the 3,000 Acadians who settled in Louisiana after the Expulsion. Monuments to the Acadian Expulsion have been erected at several sites in the Maritime Provinces, such as at Georges Island, Nova Scotia, and at Beaubears Island.

== Flags ==
The flag of the Acadians is the French tricolour, with the addition of a golden star in the blue field. This symbolizes Saint Mary, Our Lady of the Assumption, patron saint of the Acadians and widely known as the &quot;Star of the Sea&quot;. This flag was adopted in 1884 at the Second Acadian National Convention, held in Miscouche, Prince Edward Island.

Acadians in the diaspora have adopted other symbols. The flag of Acadians in Louisiana, known as Cajuns, was designed by Thomas J. Arceneaux of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. In 1974 it was adopted by the Louisiana legislature as the official emblem of the Acadiana region. The state has supported the culture, in part because it has attracted cultural and heritage tourism.

In 2004 New England Acadians, who were attending Le Congrès Mondial Acadien in Nova Scotia, endorsed a design by William Cork for a New England Acadian flag.

==Prominent Acadians==

* Noël Doiron (1684–1758). A regional leader, Noel was among the more than 350 Acadians who died during the deportation when the &quot;Duke William&quot; sank on 13 December 1758. He was widely celebrated and places have been named for him in Nova Scotia.
* Jean Baptiste Guedry (d. 1726). An example of an Acadian who resisted British rule. He took over a small ship off Acadia and was tried for piracy. The trial was publicized to the Mi&#x27;kmaq tribes as an example of English law. Guedry&#x27;s trial was used as a counter to local customs, which allowed the holding of a group—i.e., all Englishmen—responsible for an individual&#x27;s crimes. His prosecutors also used his trial as a test case for separating English law as applied to Acadia from law applied to First Nations groups like the Wabanaki Confederacy.
* Joseph Broussard, an Acadian folk hero and militia leader who joined French priest Jean-Louis Le Loutre in resisting the British occupation of Acadia.

<text>François Boucher ( , ; ; 29 September 1703 – 30 May 1770) was a French painter, draughtsman and etcher, who worked in the Rococo style. Boucher is known for his idyllic and voluptuous paintings on classical themes, decorative allegories, and pastoral scenes. He was perhaps the most celebrated painter and decorative artist of the 18th century.

==Life==
A native of Paris, Boucher was the son of a lesser known painter Nicolas Boucher, who gave him his first artistic training. At the age of seventeen, a painting by Boucher was admired by the painter François Lemoyne. Lemoyne later appointed Boucher as his apprentice, but after only three months, he went to work for the engraver Jean-François Cars.
In 1720, he won the elite Grand Prix de Rome for painting, but did not take up the consequential opportunity to study in Italy until five years later, due to financial problems at the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture. On his return from studying in Italy he was admitted to the refounded Académie de peinture et de sculpture on 24 November 1731. His &quot;morceau de réception&quot; (reception piece) was his &quot;Rinaldo and Armida&quot; of 1734.

Boucher married Marie-Jeanne Buzeau in 1733. The couple had three children together. Boucher became a faculty member in 1734 and his career accelerated from this point as he was promoted Professor then Rector of the academy, becoming inspector at the Royal Gobelins Manufactory and finally &quot;Premier Peintre du Roi&quot; (First Painter of the King) in 1765.
Boucher died on 30 May 1770 in his native Paris. His name, along with that of his patron Madame de Pompadour, had become synonymous with the French Rococo style, leading the Goncourt brothers to write: &quot;Boucher is one of those men who represent the taste of a century, who express, personify and embody it.&quot;

Boucher is famous for saying that nature is &quot;trop verte et mal éclairée&quot; (too green and badly lit).

Boucher was associated with the gemstone engraver Jacques Guay, whom he taught to draw. He also mentored the Moravian-Austrian painter Martin Ferdinand Quadal as well as the neoclassical painter Jacques-Louis David in 1767. Later, Boucher made a series of drawings of works by Guay which Madame de Pompadour then engraved and distributed as a handsomely bound volume to favored courtiers.

==Painting==

Boucher took inspiration from artists such as Peter Paul Rubens and Antoine Watteau. Boucher&#x27;s early works celebrate the idyllic and tranquil portrayal of nature and landscape with great elan. However, his art typically forgoes traditional rural innocence to portray scenes with a definitive style of eroticism as his mythological scenes are passionate and intimately amorous rather than traditionally epic. Boucher&#x27;s paintings of a flirtatious shepherd and shepherdess in a woodland setting, featured in &quot;The Enjoyable Lesson&quot; (&quot;The Flute Players&quot;) of 1748 and &quot;An Autumn Pastoral&quot; (&quot;The Grape Eaters&quot;) of 1749, were based upon characters in a 1745 play by Boucher&#x27;s close friend Charles-Simon Favart. Boucher&#x27;s characters in those paintings later inspired a pair of figurines created by the Sèvres Porcelain Manufactory, –66. Marquise de Pompadour (mistress of King Louis XV), whose name became synonymous with Rococo art, was a great admirer of his work. Marquise de Pompadour is often referred to as the &quot;godmother of Rococo&quot; and Boucher&#x27;s portraits were central to her self-presentation and cultivation of her image. For instance, Boucher&#x27;s &#x27;Sketch for a Portrait of Madame de Pompadour&#x27;, displayed in the Starhemburg room at Waddesdon Manor, acts as a surviving example of the oil preparation prior to the, now lost, portrait. In one hand she holds her hat, in the other she picks up a pearl bracelet with a portrait of the king – symbolising the relationship upon which her status depends.
Boucher&#x27;s paintings such as &quot;The Breakfast&quot; (1739), a familial scene, show how he was as a master of the genre scene, where he regularly used his own wife and children as models. These intimate family scenes are contrasting to the licentious style seen in his &quot;Odalisque&quot; portraits.

The dark-haired version of the &quot;Odalisque&quot; portraits prompted claims by the art critic Denis Diderot that Boucher was &quot;prostituting his own wife&quot;, and the &quot;Blonde Odalisque&quot; was a portrait that illustrated the extramarital relationships of the King. Boucher gained lasting notoriety through such private commissions for wealthy collectors and, after Diderot expressed his disapproval, his reputation came under increasing critical attack during the last years of his career.
==Theatrical and tapestry designs==

Along with his painting, Boucher also designed theater costumes and sets, and the ardent intrigues of the comic operas of Charles Simon Favart closely paralleled his own style of painting. Tapestry design was also a concern. For the Beauvais tapestry workshops he first designed a series of &quot;Fêtes italiennes&quot; (&quot;Italian festivals&quot;) in 1736, which proved to be very successful and often rewoven over the years, and then, commissioned in 1737, a suite of the story of Cupid and Psyche. During two decades&#x27; involvement with the Beauvais tapestry workshops Boucher produced designs for six series of hangings in all, like the tapestry showing Psyche and the Basketmaker from 1741 to 1742.

Boucher was also called upon for designs for court festivities organized by that section of the King&#x27;s household called the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi and for the opera and for royal châteaux Versailles, Fontainebleau and Choisy. His designs for all of the aforementioned augmented his earlier reputation, resulting in many engravings from his work and even reproduction of his designs on porcelain and biscuit-ware at the Vincennes and Sèvres factories. The death of Oudry in 1755 put an end to its contribution to Beauvais but his collaboration with the Gobelins lasted until 1765, when he stepped down from his position as an inspector.

==Drawings and prints==


Boucher was a very prolific and varied draftsman. His drawings served not only as preparatory studies for his paintings and as designs for printmakers but also as finished works of art for which there was a great demand by collectors. Boucher followed standard studio practices of the time, by first working out the overall composition of his major canvases, and then making chalk studies for individual figures, or groups of figures. He also relied on oil and gouache sketches in the preparation of major commissions.

Gradually he made more and more sketches as independent works for the market. The &quot;Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; (Metropolitan Museum of Art), a free and painterly sketch in gouache, was long considered a preparatory sketch for Madame de Pompadour&#x27;s private altarpiece &quot;La lumière du monde&quot; (ca. 1750, Musée des Beaux-Arts, Lyon). Recent scholarship suggests, however, that it was made at least 10 years later as an autonomous work. In the last decade of his career the artist began to favor brown chalk, a fabricated medium.

Boucher was also a gifted engraver and etcher. Boucher etched some 180 original copperplates. He made many etchings after Watteau. He thus helped propagate a taste for reproductions of drawings. When his own drawings began to sell, 266 of them were etched in stipple substitutes by Gilles Demarteau. These were printed in red ink so they resembled red chalk drawings which could be framed as little pictures. They could then be hung in the small blank spaces of the elaborately decorated paneling of luxury dwellings.

Boucher&#x27;s most original inventions were decorative, and he contributed to the fashionable style of chinoiserie, after having etched 12 &#x27;Figures Chinoises&#x27; (Chinese figures) by Watteau.

<text>Ossip Zadkine (; 28 January 1888 – 25 November 1967) was a Russian and French artist of the School of Paris. He is best known as a sculptor, but also produced paintings and lithographs.

==Early years and education==
Zadkine was born on 28 January 1888 as Yossel Aronovich Tsadkin () in the city of Vitsebsk, Russian Empire (now Belarus). He was born to a baptized Jewish father and a mother named Zippa-Dvoyra, who he claimed to be of Scottish origin. Archival materials state that Iosel-Shmuila Aronovich Tsadkin was of Jewish faith and studied in the Vitebsk City Technical School between 1900 and 1904. He also studied in the Yury Pen&#x27;s art school with would-be artists Marc Chagall (then Movsha Shagal) and Victor Mekler (then Avigdor Mekler). Archival materials contradict Zadkine himself and states that his father did not convert to the Russian Orthodox religion and his mother was not of a Scottish extraction. He had 5 siblings: sisters Mira, Roza and Fania and brothers Mark and Moses.

Zadkine claimed in his memoir that at the age of fifteen he had been sent by his father to Sunderland in the north of England, to stay with distant Scottish relatives and learn some &quot;good manners&quot;. However, recent research has discovered that he ran away from home with a younger brother,and ended up living in Sunderland with the family of his paternal uncle, Joseph Zadkin, who had himself emigrated from Belarus a few years previously. In Sunderland he took art classes in Sunderland Town Hall and was taught to use a chisel by his uncle who was a cabinetmaker. He then moved to London and attended lessons at the Regent Street Polytechnic where he won a prize for modelling in 1908 but considered the teachers to be too conservative.

Zadkine settled in Paris in 1910. He studied at the École des Beaux-Arts for six months. In 1911 he lived and worked in La Ruche. While in Paris he joined the Cubist movement, working in a Cubist idiom from 1914 to 1925. He later developed his own style, one that was strongly influenced by African and Greek art.

== Career ==

In 1921 he obtained French citizenship. Zadkine served as a stretcher-bearer in the French Army during World War I, and was wounded in action. He spent World War II in the US. His best-known work is probably the sculpture &quot;The Destroyed City&quot; (1951–1953), representing a man without a heart, a memorial to the destruction of the center of the Dutch city of Rotterdam in 1940 by the Nazi-German Luftwaffe.

He taught sculpture classes at Académie de la Grande Chaumière until 1958, students of his included artists Geula Dagan (1925–2008), Gunnar Aagaard Andersen and Genevieve Pezet.

== Death and legacy ==
Zadkine died in Paris in 1967 at the age of 79 after undergoing abdominal surgery and was interred in the Cimetière du Montparnasse.

=== Museums ===
His former home and studio in Montparnasse is now the Musée Zadkine. When his former wife Prax died, she donated the house and art studio to the City of Paris for the formation of Musée Zadkine.

There is also a Musée Zadkine in the village of Les Arques in the Midi-Pyrénées region of France. Zadkine lived in Les Arques for a number of years, and while there, carved an enormous Christ on the Cross and Pieta that are featured in the 12th-century church which stands opposite the museum.

==Personal life==
In August 1920, Zadkine married Valentine Prax (1897–1981), an Algerian-born painter of Sicilian and French-Catalan descent. Prax and Zadkine had no children.

Zadkine was a neighbor in Montparnasse and a friend of Henry Miller and was represented by the character &quot;Borowski&quot; in Miller&#x27;s novel, &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot; (1934). His other neighbors there included Chaïm Soutine, and Tsuguharu Foujita.

While living in Manhattan during wartime from 1942 to 1945, Zadkine had a relationship with American artist Carol Janeway and created several portraits of her.

The artist&#x27;s only child, Nicolas Hasle (born 1960), was born after an affair with a Danish woman, Annelise Hasle. Since 2009, Hasle, a psychiatrist, who had been acknowledged by the artist and had his parentage legally established in France in the 1980s, has been party to a lawsuit with the City of Paris to establish his claim to his father&#x27;s estate.

<doc id="44519" wikidata="Q2291417" url="?curid=44519" title="List of national parks of Canada">
<text>Canada&#x27;s national parks are protected areas under the &quot;Canada National Parks Act&quot;, owned by the Government of Canada and administered for the benefit, education, and enjoyment of the people of Canada and its future generations. National parks are administered by Parks Canada, a Crown agency operating under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Environment and Climate Change. The goal of the national parks system is to set aside lands representing the country&#x27;s 39 distinct natural regions described in the &quot;National Parks System Plan&quot;, primarily to protect the ecological integrity of the land, and secondarily to allow the public to explore, learn about and enjoy Canada&#x27;s natural spaces.

Canada&#x27;s first national park was created in 1885 through an Order-in-Council to reserve over the Cave and Basin Hot Springs to prevent the land from being sold for private development despite claims being made for it. Modelled after the American experience with Yellowstone National Park, the &quot;Rocky Mountains Park Act&quot;, adopted in 1887, established the Rocky Mountains Park (now Banff National Park). The idea of a national park was popular and led to numerous proposals for the Ministry of the Interior to consider, including additional sites along the Canadian Pacific Railway (e.g. Yoho and Glacier and an expansion of Banff) and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (e.g. Jasper). In 1911 the &quot;Rocky Mountains Park Act&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act&quot; which created the world&#x27;s first National Park Service, the Dominion Parks Branch, to administer national parks in Canada. These early national parks, including those established under the leadership of JB Harkin who was the first commissioner of the Dominion Parks Branch, were set aside to reserve lands principally for tourism and conservation but also had an exclusionary policy prohibiting First Nations peoples from using their traditional lands within the new parks. In 1922, Wood Buffalo National Park was the first to allow traditional indigenous activities to continue. In 1972, Parks Canada defined national park reserves as lands administered by the agency intended to become national parks pending settlement of indigenous land rights and agreements for continued traditional use of the lands.

, there are 37 national parks and 11 national park reserves, covering an area of approximately , or about 3.3% of the total land area of Canada, and representing 31 of its 39 natural regions. There is at least one park located in every one of the nation&#x27;s 13 provinces and territories. Parks Canada reported attendance of 15,449,249 at all national parks and reserves in 2016–17, including over four million visits to the busiest park (Banff) and only two persons at the least-visited park (Tuktut Nogait). Parks Canada additionally manages three National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs), a single NMCA Reserve, and the country&#x27;s lone National Landmark. The &quot;Canada National Parks Act&quot; also allows for recognition of National Historic Sites that commemorate events, landmarks, or objects of national importance, and which may include similar levels of protection and administration as national parks. Feasibility studies are underway to establish further national parks in unrepresented regions.

==National parks and national park reserves==

National park reserves are indicated by &quot;(Reserve)&quot; after the park name. The national urban park is indicated by &quot;(Urban)&quot; after the park name.

 
===By province/territory===
===Proposed National Park Reserves===
The following are areas which Parks Canada is in the process of evaluating as potential parks. While they may be reserved from alienation or have federal-provincial/territorial agreements, they have not been formally established through legislation as parks.
There remain seven Natural Regions unrepresented by either current or proposed parks. As Parks Canada has a long-term goal of preserving representative areas of all Natural Regions, future parks will likely be established in these areas. These regions are:
* the &quot;Boreal Lake Plateau&quot; region of Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec
* the &quot;Laurentian Boreal Highlands&quot; region of Newfoundland and Labrador and Quebec
* the &quot;Manitoba Lowlands&quot; region of Manitoba
* the &quot;Northern Interior Plateaux and Mountains&quot; region of British Columbia and Yukon
* the &quot;Southampton Plain&quot; region of Nunavut
* the &quot;Ungava Tundra Plateau&quot; region of Quebec and Nunavut
* the &quot;Whale River&quot; region of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nunavut, and Quebec

===Abolished national parks===

* Brereton and Vidal were transferred to provincial jurisdiction, both continuing as (renamed) provincial parks.
* Buffalo, Menissawok, Nemiskam and Wawaskesy were created expressly to protect and regenerate dangerously low populations of bison and pronghorn, and were delisted when those populations improved.

==National Marine Conservation Areas==
National Marine Conservation Areas (NMCAs) is a program established in 2002 with the goal of preserving marine ecosystems representing the 29 marine regions of Canada. They are designed for sustainable use, although they usually also contain areas designed to protect ecological integrity. National Marine Conservation Area Reserves are protected areas proposed to be added to the NMCA system pending settlement of indigenous land and water rights. In the interim, they are administered under park rules.

, established NMCAs and NMCA Reserves protect of waters, wetlands, and coastlines, representing five of the 29 identified marine regions with studies underway for protected areas in three additional regions.


===Proposed National Marine Conservation Areas===

==National Landmarks==
The National Landmarks program was established in 1978 to protect specific natural features considered &quot;outstanding, exceptional, unique, or rare to this country. These natural features would typically be isolated entities and of scientific interest.&quot; The enabling legislation expired 10 years later, and was not renewed. Pingo National Landmark was the only such unit established in that time.


==Provincial parks categorized as national parks==

Provincial and territorial parks are administered and funded by their respective governments. The province of Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Société des établissements de plein air du Québec&quot; (Sépaq) names its protected areas &quot;national parks&quot; (). These are not part of the National Parks System administered by Parks Canada, other than Saguenay–St. Lawrence Marine Park which is co-managed by both agencies.

Some sub-national parks are categorized by the IUCN under the umbrella term &quot;national parks&quot; (Category II) in its global Protected Area Management Categories. As of 2011, there were more than 1500 Category II-listed areas across the country, including nearly 700 in B.C., and at least 500 in Ontario. Only Quebec uses the term “national park” for such provincial areas, using the IUCN&#x27;s category name as justification.

In addition to the national park system, several federal agencies manage natural, scientific, and recreational areas. In the National Capital Region, a number of parklands come under the jurisdiction of the National Capital Commission, including Gatineau Park in Quebec. None of these are part of the national park system.

<text>Mutiny on the Bounty is a 1932 novel by Charles Nordhoff and James Norman Hall, based on the mutiny against Lieutenant William Bligh, commanding officer of the &quot;Bounty&quot; in 1789. It has been made into several films and a musical. It was the first of what became &quot;The Bounty Trilogy&quot;, which continues with &quot;Men Against the Sea&quot;, and concludes with &quot;Pitcairn&#x27;s Island&quot;.

==Plot introduction==
The novel tells the story through a fictional first-person narrator by the name of Roger Byam, based on a crew member Peter Heywood. Byam, although not one of the mutineers, remains with the &quot;Bounty&quot; after the mutiny. He subsequently returns to Tahiti and is eventually arrested and taken back to England to face a court-martial. He and several other members of the crew are eventually acquitted.

==Characters in &quot;Mutiny on the Bounty&quot;==
*Roger Byam – main protagonist, loosely based on the life of midshipman Peter Heywood; but with differences in the book it is claimed that Byam&#x27;s only living relative was his mother who died of shock after William Bligh had accused her son of being an active mutineer; in fact, Heywood had several siblings; his mother survived his court-martial- although his sister Nessy Heywood did die a year after his acquittal
*William Bligh – Lieutenant and commander of the &quot;Bounty&quot;
*Fletcher Christian – eventual mutineer

<doc id="44525" wikidata="Q5597" url="?curid=44525" title="Raphael">
<text>Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino (; March 28 or April 6, 1483April 6, 1520), now generally known in English as Raphael ( , ), was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form, ease of composition, and visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.

His father Giovanni Santi was court painter to the ruler of the small but highly cultured city of Urbino. He died when Raphael was eleven, and Raphael seems to have played a role in managing the family workshop from this point. He probably trained in the workshop of Pietro Perugino, and was described as a fully trained &quot;master&quot; by 1500. He worked in or for several cities in north Italy until in 1508 he moved to Rome at the invitation of Pope Julius II, to work on the Apostolic Palace at the Vatican. He was given a series of important commissions there and elsewhere in the city, and began to work as an architect. He was still at the height of his powers at his death in 1520.

Raphael was enormously productive, running an unusually large workshop and, despite his early death at 37, leaving a large body of work. His career falls naturally into three phases and three styles, first described by Giorgio Vasari: his early years in Umbria, then a period of about four years (1504–1508) absorbing the artistic traditions of Florence, followed by his last hectic and triumphant twelve years in Rome, working for two popes and their close associates. Many of his works are found in the Vatican Palace, where the frescoed Raphael Rooms were the central, and the largest, work of his career. The best known work is &quot;The School of Athens&quot; in the Vatican Stanza della Segnatura. After his early years in Rome, much of his work was executed by his workshop from his drawings, with considerable loss of quality. He was extremely influential in his lifetime, though outside Rome his work was mostly known from his collaborative printmaking.

After his death, the influence of his great rival Michelangelo exceeded his until the 18th and 19th centuries, when Raphael&#x27;s more serene and harmonious qualities were again regarded as the highest models. Thanks to the influence of art historian Johann Joachim Winckelmann, his work became a formative influence on Neoclassical painting, but his techniques would later be explicitly and emphatically rejected by groups such as the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.

==Background==

Raphael was born in the small but artistically significant central Italian city of Urbino in the Marches region, where his father Giovanni Santi was court painter to the Duke. The reputation of the court had been established by Federico da Montefeltro, a highly successful condottiere who had been created Duke of Urbino by Pope Sixtus IV – Urbino formed part of the Papal States – and who died the year before Raphael was born. The emphasis of Federico&#x27;s court was more literary than artistic, but Giovanni Santi was a poet of sorts as well as a painter, and had written a rhymed chronicle of the life of Federico, and both wrote the texts and produced the decor for masque-like court entertainments. His poem to Federico shows him as keen to demonstrate awareness of the most advanced North Italian painters, and Early Netherlandish artists as well. In the very small court of Urbino he was probably more integrated into the central circle of the ruling family than most court painters.

Federico was succeeded by his son Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, who married Elisabetta Gonzaga, daughter of the ruler of Mantua, the most brilliant of the smaller Italian courts for both music and the visual arts. Under them, the court continued as a centre for literary culture. Growing up in the circle of this small court gave Raphael the excellent manners and social skills stressed by Vasari. Court life in Urbino at just after this period was to become set as the model of the virtues of the Italian humanist court through Baldassare Castiglione&#x27;s depiction of it in his classic work &quot;The Book of the Courtier&quot;, published in 1528. Castiglione moved to Urbino in 1504, when Raphael was no longer based there but frequently visited, and they became good friends. Raphael became close to other regular visitors to the court: Pietro Bibbiena and Pietro Bembo, both later cardinals, were already becoming well known as writers, and would later be in Rome during Raphael&#x27;s period there. Raphael mixed easily in the highest circles throughout his life, one of the factors that tended to give a misleading impression of effortlessness to his career. He did not receive a full humanistic education however; it is unclear how easily he read Latin.

==Early life and work==

Raphael&#x27;s mother Màgia died in 1491 when he was eight, followed on August 1, 1494, by his father, who had already remarried. Raphael was thus orphaned at eleven; his formal guardian became his only paternal uncle, Bartolomeo, a priest, who subsequently engaged in litigation with his stepmother. The boy probably continued to live with his stepmother when not staying as an apprentice with a master. He had already shown talent, according to Vasari, who says that Raphael had been &quot;a great help to his father&quot;. A self-portrait drawing from his teenage years shows his precocity. His father&#x27;s workshop continued and, probably together with his stepmother, Raphael evidently played a part in managing it from a very early age. In Urbino, he came into contact with the works of Paolo Uccello, previously the court painter (d. 1475), and Luca Signorelli, who until 1498 was based in nearby Città di Castello.

According to Vasari, Raphael&#x27;s father placed him in the workshop of the Umbrian master Pietro Perugino as an apprentice &quot;despite the tears of his mother&quot;. The evidence of an apprenticeship comes only from Vasari and another source, and has been disputed; eight was very early for an apprenticeship to begin. An alternative theory is that the boy received at least some training from Timoteo Viti, who acted as court painter in Urbino from 1495. Most modern historians agree that Raphael at least worked as an assistant to Perugino from around 1500; the influence of Perugino on Raphael&#x27;s early work is very clear: &quot;probably no other pupil of genius has ever absorbed so much of his master&#x27;s teaching as Raphael did&quot;, according to Wölfflin. Vasari wrote that it was impossible to distinguish between their hands at this period, but many modern art historians claim to do better and detect his hand in specific areas of works by Perugino or his workshop. Apart from stylistic closeness, their techniques are very similar as well, for example having paint applied thickly, using an oil varnish medium, in shadows and darker garments, but very thinly on flesh areas. An excess of resin in the varnish often causes cracking of areas of paint in the works of both masters. The Perugino workshop was active in both Perugia and Florence, perhaps maintaining two permanent branches. Raphael is described as a &quot;master&quot;, that is to say fully trained, in December 1500.

His first documented work was the &quot;Baronci Altarpiece&quot; for the church of Saint Nicholas of Tolentino in Città di Castello, a town halfway between Perugia and Urbino. Evangelista da Pian di Meleto, who had worked for his father, was also named in the commission. It was commissioned in 1500 and finished in 1501; now only some cut sections and a preparatory drawing remain. In the following years he painted works for other churches there, including the &quot;Mond Crucifixion&quot; (about 1503) and the Brera &quot;Wedding of the Virgin&quot; (1504), and for Perugia, such as the &quot;Oddi Altarpiece&quot;. He very probably also visited Florence in this period. These are large works, some in fresco, where Raphael confidently marshals his compositions in the somewhat static style of Perugino. He also painted many small and exquisite cabinet paintings in these years, probably mostly for the connoisseurs in the Urbino court, like the &quot;Three Graces&quot; and &quot;St. Michael&quot;, and he began to paint Madonnas and portraits. In 1502 he went to Siena at the invitation of another pupil of Perugino, Pinturicchio, &quot;being a friend of Raphael and knowing him to be a draughtsman of the highest quality&quot; to help with the cartoons, and very likely the designs, for a fresco series in the Piccolomini Library in Siena Cathedral. He was evidently already much in demand even at this early stage in his career.

==Influence of Florence==

Raphael led a &quot;nomadic&quot; life, working in various centres in Northern Italy, but spent a good deal of time in Florence, perhaps from about 1504. Although there is traditional reference to a &quot;Florentine period&quot; of about 1504–1508, he was possibly never a continuous resident there. He may have needed to visit the city to secure materials in any case. There is a letter of recommendation of Raphael, dated October 1504, from the mother of the next Duke of Urbino to the Gonfaloniere of Florence: &quot;The bearer of this will be found to be Raphael, painter of Urbino, who, being greatly gifted in his profession has determined to spend some time in Florence to study. And because his father was most worthy and I was very attached to him, and the son is a sensible and well-mannered young man, on both accounts, I bear him great love...&quot;

As earlier with Perugino and others, Raphael was able to assimilate the influence of Florentine art, whilst keeping his own developing style. Frescos in Perugia of about 1505 show a new monumental quality in the figures which may represent the influence of Fra Bartolomeo, who Vasari says was a friend of Raphael. But the most striking influence in the work of these years is Leonardo da Vinci, who returned to the city from 1500 to 1506. Raphael&#x27;s figures begin to take more dynamic and complex positions, and though as yet his painted subjects are still mostly tranquil, he made drawn studies of fighting nude men, one of the obsessions of the period in Florence. Another drawing is a portrait of a young woman that uses the three-quarter length pyramidal composition of the just-completed &quot;Mona Lisa&quot;, but still looks completely Raphaelesque. Another of Leonardo&#x27;s compositional inventions, the pyramidal &quot;Holy Family&quot;, was repeated in a series of works that remain among his most famous easel paintings. There is a drawing by Raphael in the Royal Collection of Leonardo&#x27;s lost &quot;Leda and the Swan&quot;, from which he adapted the contrapposto pose of his own &quot;Saint Catherine of Alexandria&quot;. He also perfects his own version of Leonardo&#x27;s sfumato modelling, to give subtlety to his painting of flesh, and develops the interplay of glances between his groups, which are much less enigmatic than those of Leonardo. But he keeps the soft clear light of Perugino in his paintings.

Leonardo was more than thirty years older than Raphael, but Michelangelo, who was in Rome for this period, was just eight years his senior. Michelangelo already disliked Leonardo, and in Rome came to dislike Raphael even more, attributing conspiracies against him to the younger man. Raphael would have been aware of his works in Florence, but in his most original work of these years, he strikes out in a different direction. His &quot;Deposition of Christ&quot; draws on classical sarcophagi to spread the figures across the front of the picture space in a complex and not wholly successful arrangement. Wöllflin detects in the kneeling figure on the right the influence of the Madonna in Michelangelo&#x27;s &quot;Doni Tondo&quot;, but the rest of the composition is far removed from his style, or that of Leonardo. Though highly regarded at the time, and much later forcibly removed from Perugia by the Borghese, it stands rather alone in Raphael&#x27;s work. His classicism would later take a less literal direction.

==Roman period==
===Vatican &quot;Stanze&quot;===
In 1508, Raphael moved to Rome, where he resided for the rest of his life. He was invited by the new pope, Julius II, perhaps at the suggestion of his architect Donato Bramante, then engaged on St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, who came from just outside Urbino and was distantly related to Raphael. Unlike Michelangelo, who had been kept lingering in Rome for several months after his first summons, Raphael was immediately commissioned by Julius to fresco what was intended to become the Pope&#x27;s private library at the Vatican Palace. This was a much larger and more important commission than any he had received before; he had only painted one altarpiece in Florence itself. Several other artists and their teams of assistants were already at work on different rooms, many painting over recently completed paintings commissioned by Julius&#x27;s loathed predecessor, Alexander VI, whose contributions, and arms, Julius was determined to efface from the palace. Michelangelo, meanwhile, had been commissioned to paint the Sistine Chapel ceiling.

This first of the famous &quot;Stanze&quot; or &quot;Raphael Rooms&quot; to be painted, now known as the &quot;Stanza della Segnatura&quot; after its use in Vasari&#x27;s time, was to make a stunning impact on Roman art, and remains generally regarded as his greatest masterpiece, containing &quot;The School of Athens&quot;, &quot;The Parnassus&quot; and the &quot;Disputa&quot;. Raphael was then given further rooms to paint, displacing other artists including Perugino and Signorelli. He completed a sequence of three rooms, each with paintings on each wall and often the ceilings too, increasingly leaving the work of painting from his detailed drawings to the large and skilled workshop team he had acquired, who added a fourth room, probably only including some elements designed by Raphael, after his early death in 1520. The death of Julius in 1513 did not interrupt the work at all, as he was succeeded by Raphael&#x27;s last pope, the Medici Pope Leo X, with whom Raphael formed an even closer relationship, and who continued to commission him. Raphael&#x27;s friend Cardinal Bibbiena was also one of Leo&#x27;s old tutors, and a close friend and advisor.

In the course of painting the room, Raphael was clearly influenced by Michelangelo&#x27;s Sistine Chapel ceiling. Vasari said Bramante let him into the chapel secretly. Raphael completed the first section of his work in 1511 and the reaction of other artists to the daunting force of Michelangelo was the dominating question in Italian art for the following few decades. Raphael, who had already shown his gift for absorbing influences into his own personal style, rose to the challenge perhaps better than any other artist. One of the first and clearest instances was the portrait in &quot;The School of Athens&quot; of Michelangelo himself, as Heraclitus, which seems to draw clearly from the Sybils and &quot;ignudi&quot; of the Sistine ceiling. Other figures in that and later paintings in the room show the same influences, but as still cohesive with a development of Raphael&#x27;s own style. Michelangelo accused Raphael of plagiarism and years after Raphael&#x27;s death, complained in a letter that &quot;everything he knew about art he got from me&quot;, although other quotations show more generous reactions.

These very large and complex compositions have been regarded ever since as among the supreme works of the grand manner of the High Renaissance, and the &quot;classic art&quot; of the post-antique West. They give a highly idealised depiction of the forms represented, and the compositions, though very carefully conceived in drawings, achieve &quot;sprezzatura&quot;, a term invented by his friend Castiglione, who defined it as &quot;a certain nonchalance which conceals all artistry and makes whatever one says or does seem uncontrived and effortless ...&quot;. According to Michael Levey, &quot;Raphael gives his [figures] a superhuman clarity and grace in a universe of Euclidian certainties&quot;. The painting is nearly all of the highest quality in the first two rooms, but the later compositions in the Stanze, especially those involving dramatic action, are not entirely as successful either in conception or their execution by the workshop.

===Architecture===

After Bramante&#x27;s death in 1514, Raphael was named architect of the new St Peter&#x27;s. Most of his work there was altered or demolished after his death and the acceptance of Michelangelo&#x27;s design, but a few drawings have survived. It appears his designs would have made the church a good deal gloomier than the final design, with massive piers all the way down the nave, &quot;like an alley&quot; according to a critical posthumous analysis by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. It would perhaps have resembled the temple in the background of &quot;The Expulsion of Heliodorus from the Temple&quot;.

He designed several other buildings, and for a short time was the most important architect in Rome, working for a small circle around the Papacy. Julius had made changes to the street plan of Rome, creating several new thoroughfares, and he wanted them filled with splendid palaces.

An important building, the Palazzo Branconio dell&#x27;Aquila for Leo&#x27;s Papal Chamberlain Giovanni Battista Branconio, was completely destroyed to make way for Bernini&#x27;s &quot;piazza&quot; for St. Peter&#x27;s, but drawings of the façade and courtyard remain. The façade was an unusually richly decorated one for the period, including both painted panels on the top story (of three), and much sculpture on the middle one.

The main designs for the Villa Farnesina were not by Raphael, but he did design, and decorate with mosaics, the Chigi Chapel for the same patron, Agostino Chigi, the Papal Treasurer. Another building, for Pope Leo&#x27;s doctor, the Palazzo Jacopo da Brescia, was moved in the 1930s but survives; this was designed to complement a palace on the same street by Bramante, where Raphael himself lived for a time.

The Villa Madama, a lavish hillside retreat for Cardinal Giulio de&#x27; Medici, later Pope Clement VII, was never finished, and his full plans have to be reconstructed speculatively. He produced a design from which the final construction plans were completed by Antonio da Sangallo the Younger. Even incomplete, it was the most sophisticated villa design yet seen in Italy, and greatly influenced the later development of the genre; it appears to be the only modern building in Rome of which Palladio made a measured drawing.

Only some floor-plans remain for a large palace planned for himself on the new via Giulia in the rione of Regola, for which he was accumulating the land in his last years. It was on an irregular island block near the river Tiber. It seems all façades were to have a giant order of pilasters rising at least two storeys to the full height of the piano nobile, &quot;a grandiloquent feature unprecedented in private palace design&quot;.

Raphael asked Marco Fabio Calvo to translate Vitruvius&#x27;s &quot;Four Books of Architecture&quot; into Italian; this he received around the end of August 1514. It is preserved at the Library in Munich with handwritten margin notes by Raphael.

===Antiquity===
In about 1510, Raphael was asked by Bramante to judge contemporary copies of &quot;Laocoön and His Sons&quot;. In 1515, he was given powers as Prefect over all antiquities unearthed within, or a mile outside the city. Anyone excavating antiquities was required to inform Raphael within three days, and stonemasons were not allowed to destroy inscriptions without permission. Raphael wrote a letter to Pope Leo suggesting ways of halting the destruction of ancient monuments, and proposed a visual survey of the city to record all antiquities in an organised fashion. The pope intended to continue to re-use ancient masonry in the building of St Peter&#x27;s, also wanting to ensure that all ancient inscriptions were recorded, and sculpture preserved, before allowing the stones to be reused.

According to Marino Sanuto the Younger&#x27;s diary, in 1519 Raphael offered to transport an obelisk from the Mausoleum of August to St. Peter&#x27;s Square for 90,000 ducats. According to Marcantonio Michiel, Raphael&#x27;s &quot;youthful death saddened men of letters because he was not able to furnish the description and the painting of ancient Rome that he was making, which was very beautiful&quot;. Raphael intended to make an archaeological map of ancient Rome but this was never executed. Four archaeological drawings by the artist are preserved.

===Other painting projects===

The Vatican projects took most of his time, although he painted several portraits, including those of his two main patrons, the popes Julius II and his successor Leo X, the former considered one of his finest. Other portraits were of his own friends, like Castiglione, or the immediate Papal circle. Other rulers pressed for work, and King Francis I of France was sent two paintings as diplomatic gifts from the Pope. For Agostino Chigi, the hugely rich banker and papal treasurer, he painted the &quot;Triumph of Galatea&quot; and designed further decorative frescoes for his Villa Farnesina, a chapel in the church of Santa Maria della Pace and mosaics in the funerary chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo. He also designed some of the decoration for the Villa Madama, the work in both villas being executed by his workshop.

One of his most important papal commissions was the Raphael Cartoons (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum), a series of 10 cartoons, of which seven survive, for tapestries with scenes of the lives of Saint Paul and Saint Peter, for the Sistine Chapel. The cartoons were sent to Brussels to be woven in the workshop of Pier van Aelst. It is possible that Raphael saw the finished series before his death—they were probably completed in 1520. He also designed and painted the &quot;Loggie&quot; at the Vatican, a long thin gallery then open to a courtyard on one side, decorated with Roman-style grottesche. He produced a number of significant altarpieces, including &quot;The Ecstasy of St. Cecilia&quot; and the &quot;Sistine Madonna&quot;. His last work, on which he was working up to his death, was a large &quot;Transfiguration&quot;, which together with &quot;Il Spasimo&quot; shows the direction his art was taking in his final years—more proto-Baroque than Mannerist.

==Painting materials==
Raphael painted several of his works on wood support (&quot;Madonna of the Pinks&quot;) but he also used canvas (&quot;Sistine Madonna&quot;) and he was known to employ drying oils such as linseed or walnut oils. His palette was rich and he used almost all of the then available pigments such as ultramarine, lead-tin-yellow, carmine, vermilion, madder lake, verdigris and ochres. In several of his paintings (Ansidei Madonna) he even employed the rare brazilwood lake, metallic powdered gold and even less known metallic powdered bismuth.

==Workshop==
Vasari says that Raphael eventually had a workshop of fifty pupils and assistants, many of whom later became significant artists in their own right. This was arguably the largest workshop team assembled under any single old master painter, and much higher than the norm. They included established masters from other parts of Italy, probably working with their own teams as sub-contractors, as well as pupils and journeymen. We have very little evidence of the internal working arrangements of the workshop, apart from the works of art themselves, which are often very difficult to assign to a particular hand.

The most important figures were Giulio Romano, a young pupil from Rome (only about twenty-one at Raphael&#x27;s death), and Gianfrancesco Penni, already a Florentine master. They were left many of Raphael&#x27;s drawings and other possessions, and to some extent continued the workshop after Raphael&#x27;s death. Penni did not achieve a personal reputation equal to Giulio&#x27;s, as after Raphael&#x27;s death he became Giulio&#x27;s less-than-equal collaborator in turn for much of his subsequent career. Perino del Vaga, already a master, and Polidoro da Caravaggio, who was supposedly promoted from a labourer carrying building materials on the site, also became notable painters in their own right. Polidoro&#x27;s partner, Maturino da Firenze, has, like Penni, been overshadowed in subsequent reputation by his partner. Giovanni da Udine had a more independent status, and was responsible for the decorative stucco work and grotesques surrounding the main frescoes. Most of the artists were later scattered, and some killed, by the violent Sack of Rome in 1527. This did however contribute to the diffusion of versions of Raphael&#x27;s style around Italy and beyond.

Vasari emphasises that Raphael ran a very harmonious and efficient workshop, and had extraordinary skill in smoothing over troubles and arguments with both patrons and his assistants—a contrast with the stormy pattern of Michelangelo&#x27;s relationships with both. However though both Penni and Giulio were sufficiently skilled that distinguishing between their hands and that of Raphael himself is still sometimes difficult, there is no doubt that many of Raphael&#x27;s later wall-paintings, and probably some of his easel paintings, are more notable for their design than their execution. Many of his portraits, if in good condition, show his brilliance in the detailed handling of paint right up to the end of his life.

Other pupils or assistants include Raffaellino del Colle, Andrea Sabbatini, Bartolommeo Ramenghi, Pellegrino Aretusi, Vincenzo Tamagni, Battista Dossi, Tommaso Vincidor, Timoteo Viti (the Urbino painter), and the sculptor and architect Lorenzetto (Giulio&#x27;s brother-in-law). The printmakers and architects in Raphael&#x27;s circle are discussed below. It has been claimed the Flemish Bernard van Orley worked for Raphael for a time, and Luca Penni, brother of Gianfrancesco and later a member of the First School of Fontainebleau, may have been a member of the team.

===Portraits===
==Drawings==
Raphael was one of the finest draftsmen in the history of Western art, and used drawings extensively to plan his compositions. According to a near-contemporary, when beginning to plan a composition, he would lay out a large number of stock drawings of his on the floor, and begin to draw &quot;rapidly&quot;, borrowing figures from here and there. Over forty sketches survive for the &quot;Disputa&quot; in the Stanze, and there may well have been many more originally; over four hundred sheets survive altogether. He used different drawings to refine his poses and compositions, apparently to a greater extent than most other painters, to judge by the number of variants that survive: &quot;... This is how Raphael himself, who was so rich in inventiveness, used to work, always coming up with four or six ways to show a narrative, each one different from the rest, and all of them full of grace and well done.&quot; wrote another writer after his death. For John Shearman, Raphael&#x27;s art marks &quot;a shift of resources away from production to research and development&quot;.

When a final composition was achieved, scaled-up full-size cartoons were often made, which were then pricked with a pin and &quot;pounced&quot; with a bag of soot to leave dotted lines on the surface as a guide. He also made unusually extensive use, on both paper and plaster, of a &quot;blind stylus&quot;, scratching lines which leave only an indentation, but no mark. These can be seen on the wall in &quot;The School of Athens&quot;, and in the originals of many drawings. The &quot;Raphael Cartoons&quot;, as tapestry designs, were fully coloured in a glue distemper medium, as they were sent to Brussels to be followed by the weavers.

In later works painted by the workshop, the drawings are often painfully more attractive than the paintings. Most Raphael drawings are rather precise—even initial sketches with naked outline figures are carefully drawn, and later working drawings often have a high degree of finish, with shading and sometimes highlights in white. They lack the freedom and energy of some of Leonardo&#x27;s and Michelangelo&#x27;s sketches, but are nearly always aesthetically very satisfying. He was one of the last artists to use metalpoint (literally a sharp pointed piece of silver or another metal) extensively, although he also made superb use of the freer medium of red or black chalk. In his final years he was one of the first artists to use female models for preparatory drawings—male pupils (&quot;garzoni&quot;) were normally used for studies of both sexes.

==Printmaking==
Raphael made no prints himself, but entered into a collaboration with Marcantonio Raimondi to produce engravings to Raphael&#x27;s designs, which created many of the most famous Italian prints of the century, and was important in the rise of the reproductive print. His interest was unusual in such a major artist; from his contemporaries it was only shared by Titian, who had worked much less successfully with Raimondi. A total of about fifty prints were made; some were copies of Raphael&#x27;s paintings, but other designs were apparently created by Raphael purely to be turned into prints. Raphael made preparatory drawings, many of which survive, for Raimondi to translate into engraving.

The most famous original prints to result from the collaboration were &quot;Lucretia&quot;, the &quot;Judgement of Paris&quot; and &quot;The Massacre of the Innocents&quot; (of which two virtually identical versions were engraved). Among prints of the paintings &quot;The Parnassus&quot; (with considerable differences) and &quot;Galatea&quot; were also especially well known. Outside Italy, reproductive prints by Raimondi and others were the main way that Raphael&#x27;s art was experienced until the twentieth century. Baviero Carocci, called &quot;Il Baviera&quot; by Vasari, an assistant who Raphael evidently trusted with his money, ended up in control of most of the copper plates after Raphael&#x27;s death, and had a successful career in the new occupation of a publisher of prints.

==Private life and death==
From 1517 until his death, Raphael lived in the Palazzo Caprini, lying at the corner between piazza Scossacavalli and via Alessandrina in the Borgo, in rather grand style in a palace designed by Bramante. He never married, but in 1514 became engaged to Maria Bibbiena, Cardinal Bibbiena&#x27;s niece; he seems to have been talked into this by his friend the cardinal, and his lack of enthusiasm seems to be shown by the marriage not having taken place before she died in 1520. He is said to have had many affairs, but a permanent fixture in his life in Rome was &quot;La Fornarina&quot;, Margherita Luti, the daughter of a baker (&quot;fornaro&quot;) named Francesco Luti from Siena who lived at Via del Governo Vecchio.

He was made a &quot;Groom of the Chamber&quot; of the Pope, which gave him status at court and an additional income, and also a knight of the Papal Order of the Golden Spur. Vasari claims that he had toyed with the ambition of becoming a cardinal, perhaps after some encouragement from Leo, which also may account for his delaying his marriage.

Raphael died on Good Friday, April 6, 1520, which was possibly his 37th birthday. Vasari says that Raphael had also been born on a Good Friday, which in 1483 fell on March 28, and that the artist died from exhaustion brought on by unceasing romantic interests while he was working on the Loggia. Several other possibilities for his death have been raised by later historians and scientists, such as a combination of an infectious disease and bloodletting. In his acute illness, which lasted fifteen days, Raphael was composed enough to confess his sins, receive the last rites, and put his affairs in order. He dictated his will, in which he left sufficient funds for his mistress&#x27;s care, entrusted to his loyal servant Baviera, and left most of his studio contents to Giulio Romano and Penni. At his request, Raphael was buried in the Pantheon.

Raphael&#x27;s funeral was extremely grand, attended by large crowds. According to a journal by Paris de Grassis, four cardinals dressed in purple carried his body, the hand of which was kissed by the Pope. The inscription on Raphael&#x27;s marble sarcophagus, an elegiac distich written by Pietro Bembo, reads: &quot;Here lies that famous Raphael by whom Nature feared to be conquered while he lived, and when he was dying, feared herself to die.&quot;

==Critical reception==

Raphael was highly admired by his contemporaries, although his influence on artistic style in his own century was less than that of Michelangelo. Mannerism, beginning at the time of his death, and later the Baroque, took art &quot;in a direction totally opposed&quot; to Raphael&#x27;s qualities; &quot;with Raphael&#x27;s death, classic art—the High Renaissance—subsided&quot;, as Walter Friedländer put it. He was soon seen as the ideal model by those disliking the excesses of Mannerism:the opinion ...was generally held in the middle of the sixteenth century that Raphael was the ideal balanced painter, universal in his talent, satisfying all the absolute standards, and obeying all the rules which were supposed to govern the arts, whereas Michelangelo was the eccentric genius, more brilliant than any other artists in his particular field, the drawing of the male nude, but unbalanced and lacking in certain qualities, such as grace and restraint, essential to the great artist. Those, like Dolce and Aretino, who held this view were usually the survivors of Renaissance Humanism, unable to follow Michelangelo as he moved on into Mannerism. Vasari himself, despite his hero remaining Michelangelo, came to see his influence as harmful in some ways, and added passages to the second edition of the &quot;Lives&quot; expressing similar views.

Raphael&#x27;s compositions were always admired and studied, and became the cornerstone of the training of the Academies of art. His period of greatest influence was from the late 17th to late 19th centuries, when his perfect decorum and balance were greatly admired. He was seen as the best model for the history painting, regarded as the highest in the hierarchy of genres. Sir Joshua Reynolds in his &quot;Discourses&quot; praised his &quot;simple, grave, and majestic dignity&quot; and said he &quot;stands in general foremost of the first [i.e., best] painters&quot;, especially for his frescoes (in which he included the &quot;Raphael Cartoons&quot;), whereas &quot;Michael Angelo claims the next attention. He did not possess so many excellences as Raffaelle, but those he had were of the highest kind...&quot; Echoing the sixteenth-century views above, Reynolds goes on to say of Raphael:

The excellency of this extraordinary man lay in the propriety, beauty, and majesty of his characters, his judicious contrivance of his composition, correctness of drawing, purity of taste, and the skilful accommodation of other men&#x27;s conceptions to his own purpose. Nobody excelled him in that judgment, with which he united to his own observations on nature the energy of Michael Angelo, and the beauty and simplicity of the antique. To the question, therefore, which ought to hold the first rank, Raffaelle or Michael Angelo, it must be answered, that if it is to be given to him who possessed a greater combination of the higher qualities of the art than any other man, there is no doubt but Raffaelle is the first. But if, according to Longinus, the sublime, being the highest excellence that human composition can attain to, abundantly compensates the absence of every other beauty, and atones for all other deficiencies, then Michael Angelo demands the preference. Reynolds was less enthusiastic about Raphael&#x27;s panel paintings, but the slight sentimentality of these made them enormously popular in the 19th century: &quot;We have been familiar with them from childhood onwards, through a far greater mass of reproductions than any other artist in the world has ever had...&quot; wrote Wölfflin, who was born in 1862, of Raphael&#x27;s Madonnas.

In Germany, Raphael had an immense influence on religious art of the Nazarene movement and Düsseldorf school of painting in the 19th century. In contrast, in England the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood explicitly reacted against his influence (and that of his admirers such as Joshua Reynolds), seeking to return to styles that pre-dated what they saw as his baneful influence. According to a critic whose ideas greatly influenced them, John Ruskin:
The doom of the arts of Europe went forth from that chamber [the Stanza della Segnatura], and it was brought about in great part by the very excellencies of the man who had thus marked the commencement of decline. The perfection of execution and the beauty of feature which were attained in his works, and in those of his great contemporaries, rendered finish of execution and beauty of form the chief objects of all artists; and thenceforward execution was looked for rather than thought, and beauty rather than veracity.
And as I told you, these are the two secondary causes of the decline of art; the first being the loss of moral purpose. Pray note them clearly. In mediæval art, thought is the first thing, execution the second; in modern art execution is the first thing, and thought the second. And again, in mediæval art, truth is first, beauty second; in modern art, beauty is first, truth second. The mediæval principles led up to Raphael, and the modern principles lead down from him.

By 1900, Raphael&#x27;s popularity was surpassed by Michelangelo and Leonardo, perhaps as a reaction against the etiolated Raphaelism of 19th-century academic artists such as Bouguereau. Although art historian Bernard Berenson in 1952 termed Raphael the &quot;most famous and most loved&quot; master of the High Renaissance, art historians Leopold and Helen Ettlinger say that Raphael&#x27;s lesser popularity in the 20th century is made obvious by &quot;the contents of art library shelves ... In contrast to volume upon volume that reproduce yet again detailed photographs of the Sistine Ceiling or Leonardo&#x27;s drawings, the literature on Raphael, particularly in English, is limited to only a few books&quot;. They conclude, nonetheless, that &quot;of all the great Renaissance masters, Raphael&#x27;s influence is the most continuous.&quot;

<text>Notes on Muscovite Affairs (&quot;Rerum Moscoviticarum Commentarii&quot;) (1549) was a Latin book by Baron Sigismund von Herberstein on the geography, history and customs of the Grand Duchy of Moscow. The book was the main early source of knowledge about Russia in Western Europe.

==Background==

Herberstein was an Austrian diplomat who was twice sent to Russia as Austrian ambassador, in 1517 and 1526. Born in Vipava (German &quot;Wippach&quot;), Carniola, he was familiar with Slovene, which became important later on his mission in Russia, when he was able to communicate with ordinary Russians as Slovene and Russian are both Slavic languages.

These visits occurred at a time when very little was known about Russia outside the region. The few published descriptions of Russia were in some cases wildly inaccurate.

==Historical note on Muscovy and Russia==

The Grand Duchy of Moscow, commonly referred to in the west as &quot;Muscovy&quot;, in the 16th century was one of the Russian states which emerged after the collapse of Kievan Rus&#x27; under pressure from the Golden Horde. Beginning in the early 15th Century, the Princes of Moscow began asserting their claim as the sole inheritor of the legacy of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Moscow would annex many of the other Russian principalities and would evolve into the Tsardom of Russia under Ivan the Terrible starting in the middle of the 16th century. Russia was the region, Moscow was the state until it was formally reorganized into the Russian Tsardom in 1547. Moscow was then ruled by the Muscovite monarchy, starting with Daniel of Moscow (1282–1303), who founded the Principality of Moscow, which under Ivan III saw rapid expansion, and ending with Ivan IV, who claimed the title &quot;Tsar of Russia&quot; and proclaimed the Tsardom of Russia in 1547.

In this article, &quot;Russia&quot; and &quot;Muscovy&quot; are treated as similar entities. In land area there is not much difference between Muscovy and Russia west of the Ural Mountains. Herberstein wrote about &quot;Muscovy&quot; (region based on Moscow) because that is what it was known as in the West then. We know the area as &quot;Russia&quot;, so that is how it is referred to here.

==Research==

Herberstein developed a keen interest in all things Russian, and researched in several ways:
* using his knowledge of Slavic, he questioned a variety of people on a wide range of topics.
* careful review of existing publications on Russia, comparing what he read with his own observations. He viewed most publications skeptically, because he knew that most of the authors had not been able to actually visit Russia.
* corroboration. He was careful to make sure not to accept anything that was not well corroborated. As he wrote, he &quot;did not rely upon this or that man&#x27;s account, but trusted only to the unvarying statements of many.&quot;
* investigation of Russian written publications, which provided him with information on Russian culture completely unavailable at the time in Europe.

==Content==

As a result, Herberstein was able to produce the first detailed eyewitness ethnography of Russia, encyclopedic in its scope, providing a view that was very accurate for the time of trade, religion, customs, politics, history and even a theory of Russian political culture.

The book contributed greatly to a European view held for several centuries of Russia as a despotic absolute monarchy. That view was not new, but previous writers had presented an idealized view. Herberstein influenced the development of his view in two ways:
* He accentuated the absolute power of the monarchy even more than previous works had done. Writing about the Russian Tsar, Herberstein wrote that &quot;in the power he holds over his people the ruler of Muscovy surpasses all the monarchs of the world.&quot; 
* He presented a view of Russian political culture quite opposite to that argued by other writers. Although others claimed Russians were fanatically loyal to their ruler and treated in return with great fairness, Herberstein saw and wrote differently.

His investigations made it clear that Muscovy, contrary to the view of fanatical loyalty, had suffered a violent political struggle and that Muscovy had emerged only very recently as the dominant power in the region. Besides the man who achieved the unification of Muscovy, Ivan III was characterized by Herberstein as a cruel tyrant, drunk, and a misogynist, far from being a ruler of great fairness and equity.

His description of Ivan&#x27;s unification campaign was a series of banishments and forced relocations of whole populations to break the power of regional rulers. That culminated in Ivan&#x27;s &quot;plan of ejecting all princes and others from the garrisons and fortified places&quot; and all formerly-independent princes of Russia &quot;being either moved by the grandeur of his achievements or stricken with fear, became subject to him.&quot;. All was very much at odds with previous-perceived reality but much closer to currently-understood Russian history. Similarly, the previously-touted ideal of the fairness of the Muscovy monarchy was contrasted with Herberstein&#x27;s depiction of peasants as being in &quot;a very wretched condition, for their goods are exposed to plunder from the nobility and soldiery&quot;.

==Tsar vs Czar==

One final thing for which Herberstein and his book was noted, though not widely understood, was his contribution to a spelling confusion which did not emerge until the end of the 19th century and still causes disagreement: he recorded the spelling of &quot;tsar&quot; (Russian &quot;царь&quot;, pronounced [t͡sɑrʲ]) as &quot;czar&quot;. This may cause confusion nowadays because the digraph is today only used in the Polish language and is there pronounced as [t͡ʃ]. However, early modern German (as Herberstain spoke and wrote it) and furthermore also pre-20th century Hungarian or the &#x27;mazurizing&#x27; dialects of Polish used for [t͡s]. Contrary to what the might suggest, all Slavonic languages pronounce the title &quot;tsar&quot; with [t͡s], which is always written with a simple , in Latin-writing Slavic languages as well as in the transliterations of Cyrillic-writing ones. English and French moved from the spelling to the spelling in the 19th century.

==English translations==

Marshall Poe, who has written extensively on Herberstein and Russian history generally, uses the English title &quot;Notes on the Muscovites&quot; consistently when translating the Latin title.

<text>The history of Portugal can be traced from circa 400,000 years ago, when the region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;.

The Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, which lasted almost two centuries, led to the establishment of the provinces of Lusitania in the south and Gallaecia in the north of what is now Portugal. Following the fall of Rome, Germanic tribes controlled the territory between the 5th and 8th centuries, including the Kingdom of the Suebi centred in Braga and the Visigothic Kingdom in the south.

The 711–716 invasion by the Islamic Umayyad Caliphate conquered the Visigoth Kingdom and founded the Islamic State of Al-Andalus, gradually advancing through Iberia. In 1095, Portugal broke away from the Kingdom of Galicia. Afonso Henriques, son of the count Henry of Burgundy, proclaimed himself king of Portugal in 1139. The Algarve (the southernmost province of Portugal) was conquered from the Moors in 1249, and in 1255 Lisbon became the capital. Portugal&#x27;s land boundaries have remained almost unchanged since then. During the reign of King John I, the Portuguese defeated the Castilians in a war over the throne (1385) and established a political alliance with England (by the Treaty of Windsor in 1386).

From the late Middle Ages, in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal ascended to the status of a world power during Europe&#x27;s &quot;Age of Discovery&quot; as it built up a vast empire. Signs of military decline began with the Battle of Alcácer Quibir in Morocco in 1578; this defeat led to the death of King Sebastian and the imprisonment of much of the high nobility, which had to be ransomed at great cost. This eventually led to a small interruption in Portugal&#x27;s 800-year-old independence by way of a 60-year dynastic union with Spain between 1580 and the beginning of the Portuguese Restoration War led by John IV in 1640. Spain&#x27;s disastrous defeat in its attempt to conquer England in 1588 by means of the Invincible Armada was also a factor, as Portugal had to contribute ships for the invasion. Further setbacks included the destruction of much of its capital city in an earthquake in 1755, occupation during the Napoleonic Wars, and the loss of its largest colony, Brazil, in 1822. From the middle of the 19th century to the late 1950s, nearly two million Portuguese left Portugal to live in Brazil and the United States.

In 1910, a revolution deposed the monarchy. A military coup in 1926 installed a dictatorship that remained until another coup in 1974. The new government instituted sweeping democratic reforms and granted independence to all of Portugal&#x27;s African colonies in 1975. Portugal is a founding member of NATO, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), and the Community of Portuguese Language Countries. It entered the European Economic Community (now the European Union) in 1986.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Portugal&quot; derives from the combined Roman-Celtic place name Portus Cale; a settlement where present-day&#x27;s conurbation of Porto and Vila Nova de Gaia (or simply, Gaia) stand, along the banks of river Douro in the north of what is now Portugal.

Porto stems from the Latin word for port or harbour, , with the second element &quot;Cale&quot;″s meaning and precise origin being less clear. The mainstream explanation points to an ethnonym derived from the Callaeci also known as the Gallaeci peoples, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. The names &quot;Cale&quot; and &quot;Callaici&quot; are the origin of today&#x27;s &quot;Gaia&quot; and &quot;Galicia&quot;. Another theory proposes that &quot;Cale&quot; or &quot;Calle&quot; is a derivation of the Celtic word for &#x27;port&#x27;, like the Irish or Scottish Gaelic . These explanations, would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted because the region&#x27;s pre-Roman language was Gallaecian. However, scholars like Jean Markale and Tranoy propose the Celtic branches all share the same origin, and placenames such as Cale, Gal, Gaia, Calais, Galatia, Galicia, Gaelic, Gael, Gaul (), Wales, Cornwall, Wallonia and others all stem from one linguistic root. Cala is sometimes considered not Celtic, but from Late Latin &quot;calatum&quot; &gt; &quot;calad&quot; &gt; &quot;cala&quot;, compare Italian , French , itself from Occitan &quot;cala&quot; &quot;cove, small harbour&quot; from a Pre-Indo-European root &quot;*kal&quot; / &quot;*cala&quot; (see &quot;calanque&quot; and maybe Galici-a &lt; &quot;Callaeci&quot; or &quot;Calaeci&quot;). Another theory claims it derives from the word &quot;Caladunum&quot;, in fact an unattested compound &quot;*Caladunum&quot;, that may explain the toponym Calezun in Gascony.

A further explanation proposes &quot;Gatelo&quot; as having been the origin of present-day Braga, Santiago de Compostela, and consequently the wider regions of Northern Portugal and Galicia. A different theory has it that &quot;Cala&quot; was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the Gaelic &quot;Cailleach&quot;, a supernatural hag). Some French scholars believe the name may have come from , the port of the Gauls or Celts.

Around 200 BC, the Romans took the Iberian Peninsula from the Carthaginians during the Second Punic War. In the process they conquered Cale, renaming it (&#x27;Port of Cale&#x27;) and incorporating it in the province of Gaellicia with its capital in Bracara Augusta (modern day Braga, Portugal). During the Middle Ages, the region around Portus Cale became known by the Suebi and Visigoths as &quot;Portucale&quot;. The name &quot;Portucale&quot; changed into &quot;Portugale&quot; during the 7th and 8th centuries. By the 9th century, &quot;Portugale&quot; was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers Douro and Minho, the Minho flowing along what would become the northern Portugal–Spain border. By the 11th and 12th centuries, &quot;Portugale&quot;, &quot;Portugallia&quot;, &quot;Portvgallo&quot; or &quot;Portvgalliae&quot; was already referred to as &quot;Portugal&quot;.

The 14th-century Middle French name for the country, , which added an intrusive /n/ sound through the process of excrescence, spread to Middle English. Middle English variant spellings included , , and . The spelling is found in Chaucer&#x27;s Epilogue to the Nun&#x27;s Priest&#x27;s Tale. These variants survive in the &quot;Torrent of Portyngale&quot;, a Middle English romance composed around 1400, and &quot;Old Robin of Portingale&quot;, an English Child ballad. and variants were also used in Scots and survive in the Cornish name for the country, &quot;Portyngal&quot;.

== Early history ==

The early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the Iberian Peninsula located in southwestern Europe. The name of Portugal derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name Portus Cale. The region was settled by Pre-Celts and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the Gallaeci, Lusitanians, Celtici and Cynetes (also known as Conii). Some coastal areas were visited by Phoenicians-Carthaginians and Ancient Greeks. It was incorporated in the Roman Republic dominions as Lusitania and part of Gallaecia, after 45 BC until 298 AD.

=== Prehistory ===

The region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by humans since circa 400,000 years ago, when Homo heidelbergensis entered the area. The oldest human fossil found in Portugal is the 400,000-year-old &quot;Aroeira 3&quot; &quot;H. Heidelbergensis&quot; skull discovered in the Cave of Aroeira in 2014. Later Neanderthals roamed the northern Iberian peninsula and a tooth has been found at Nova da Columbeira cave in Estremadura. Homo sapiens sapiens arrived in Portugal around 35,000 years ago, spreading and roaming the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula. These were subsistence societies and although they did not establish prosperous settlements, they did form organized societies. Neolithic Portugal experimented with domestication of herding animals, the raising of some cereal crops and fluvial or marine fishing.

Pre-Celtic tribes inhabited Portugal leaving a cultural footprint. The Cynetes developed a written language, leaving many stelae, which are mainly found in the south of Portugal. Early in the first millennium BC, waves of Celts invaded Portugal from Central Europe and inter-married with the local populations, forming different tribes. Another theory suggests that Celts inhabited western Iberia / Portugal well before any large Celtic migrations from Central Europe. A number of linguists expert in ancient Celtic have presented compelling evidence that the Tartessian language, once spoken in parts of SW Spain and SW Portugal, is at least proto-Celtic in structure.
The Celtic presence in Portugal is traceable, in broad outline, through archaeological and linguistic evidence. They dominated much of northern and central Portugal; but in the south, they were unable to establish their stronghold, which retained its non-Indo-European character until the Roman conquest. In southern Portugal, some small, semi-permanent commercial coastal settlements were also founded by Phoenician-Carthaginians.

Modern archaeology and research shows a Portuguese root to the Celts in Portugal and elsewhere. During that period and until the Roman invasions, the Castro culture (a variation of the Urnfield culture also known as &quot;Urnenfelderkultur&quot;) was prolific in Portugal and modern Galicia. This culture, together with the surviving elements of the Atlantic megalithic culture and the contributions that come from the more Western Mediterranean cultures, ended up in what has been called the Cultura Castreja or Castro Culture. This designation refers to the characteristic Celtic populations called &#x27;dùn&#x27;, &#x27;dùin&#x27; or &#x27;don&#x27; in Gaelic and that the Romans called castrae in their chronicles.

Based on the Roman chronicles about the Callaeci peoples, along with the Lebor Gabála Érenn narrations and the interpretation of the archaeological remains throughout the northern half of Portugal and Galicia, it is possible to infer that there was a matriarchal society, with a military and religious aristocracy probably of the feudal type.
 The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the druids to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.

The first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as Strabo, Herodotus and Pliny the Elder among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the Gallaeci of Northern Portugal as: &quot;A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.&quot;

There were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the Lusitanians; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the Celtici of Alentejo, and the Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve. Among the tribes or sub-divisions were the Bracari, Coelerni, Equaesi, Grovii, Interamici, Leuni, Luanqui, Limici, Narbasi, Nemetati, Paesuri, Quaquerni, Seurbi, Tamagani, Tapoli, Turduli, Turduli Veteres, Turduli Oppidani, Turodi, and Zoelae. A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as Tavira) were also founded in the Algarve region by Phoenicians–Carthaginians.

=== Ancient history ===

Numerous pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula inhabited the territory when a Roman invasion occurred in the 3rd century BC. The Romanization of Hispania took several centuries. The Roman provinces that covered present-day Portugal were Lusitania in the south and Gallaecia in the north.

Numerous Roman sites are scattered around present-day Portugal. Some of the urban remains are quite large, such as Conímbriga and Miróbriga. Several works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres, and layman&#x27;s homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, sarcophagi, and ceramics are also numerous.

Following the fall of Rome, the Kingdom of the Suebi and the Visigothic Kingdom controlled the territory between the 5th and 8th centuries.

== Romanization ==


Romanization began with the arrival of the Roman army in the Iberian Peninsula in 218 BC during the Second Punic War against Carthage. The Romans sought to conquer Lusitania, a territory that included all of modern Portugal south of the Douro river and Spanish Extremadura, with its capital at Emerita Augusta (now Mérida).

Mining was the primary factor that made the Romans interested in conquering the region: one of Rome&#x27;s strategic objectives was to cut off Carthaginian access to the Iberian copper, tin, gold, and silver mines. The Romans intensely exploited the Aljustrel (Vipasca) and Santo Domingo mines in the Iberian Pyrite Belt which extends to Seville.

While the south of what is now Portugal was relatively easily occupied by the Romans, the conquest of the north was achieved only with difficulty due to resistance from Serra da Estrela by Celts and Lusitanians led by Viriatus, who managed to resist Roman expansion for years. Viriatus, a shepherd from Serra da Estrela who was expert in guerrilla tactics, waged relentless war against the Romans, defeating several successive Roman generals, until he was assassinated in 140 BC by traitors bought by the Romans. Viriatus has long been hailed as the first truly heroic figure in proto-Portuguese history. Nonetheless, he was responsible for raids into the more settled Romanized parts of Southern Portugal and Lusitania that involved the victimization of the inhabitants.

The conquest of the Iberian Peninsula was complete two centuries after the Roman arrival, when they defeated the remaining Cantabri, Astures and Gallaeci in the Cantabrian Wars in the time of Emperor Augustus (19 BC). In 74 AD, Vespasian granted Latin Rights to most municipalities of Lusitania. In 212 AD, the Constitutio Antoniniana gave Roman citizenship to all free subjects of the empire and, at the end of the century, the emperor Diocletian founded the province of Gallaecia, which included modern-day northern Portugal, with its capital at Bracara Augusta (now Braga). As well as mining, the Romans also developed agriculture, on some of the best agricultural land in the empire. In what is now Alentejo, vines and cereals were cultivated, and fishing was intensively pursued in the coastal belt of the Algarve, Póvoa de Varzim, Matosinhos, Troia and the coast of Lisbon, for the manufacture of garum that was exported by Roman trade routes to the entire empire. Business transactions were facilitated by coinage and the construction of an extensive road network, bridges and aqueducts, such as Trajan&#x27;s bridge in Aquae Flaviae (now Chaves).

Roman rule brought geographical mobility to the inhabitants of Portugal and increased their interaction with the rest of the world as well as internally. Soldiers often served in different regions and eventually settled far from their birthplace, while the development of mining attracted migration into the mining areas. The Romans founded numerous cities, such as Olisipo (Lisbon), Bracara Augusta (Braga), Aeminium (Coimbra) and Pax Julia (Beja), and left important cultural legacies in what is now Portugal. Vulgar Latin (the basis of the Portuguese language) became the dominant language of the region, and Christianity spread throughout Lusitania from the third century.

== Germanic invasions ==

===The Suebi===
In 409, with the decline of the Roman Empire, the Iberian Peninsula was occupied by Germanic tribes that the Romans referred to as barbarians. In 411, with a federation contract with Emperor Honorius, many of these people settled in Hispania. An important group was made up of the Suebi and Vandals in Gallaecia, who founded the Kingdom of the Suebi with its capital in Braga. They came to dominate Aeminium (Coimbra) as well, and there were Visigoths to the south. The Suebi and the Visigoths were the Germanic tribes who had the most lasting presence in the territories corresponding to modern Portugal. As elsewhere in Western Europe, there was a decline in urban life during the Dark Ages.

Roman institutions declined in the wake of the Germanic invasions with the exception of ecclesiastical organizations, which were fostered by the Suebi in the fifth century and adopted by the Visigoths afterwards. Although the Suebi and Visigoths were initially followers of Arianism and Priscillianism, they adopted Catholicism from the local inhabitants. St. Martin of Braga was a particularly influential evangelist at this time.

The Kingdom of the Suebi was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of Gallaecia-Lusitania. 5th-century vestiges of Alan settlements were found in Alenquer (from old Germanic &quot;Alan kerk&quot;, &quot;temple of the Alans&quot;), Coimbra and Lisbon.

King Hermeric made a peace treaty with the Gallaecians before passing his domains to Rechila, his son. In 429, the Visigoths moved south to expel the Alans and Vandals and founded a kingdom with its capital in Toledo. In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to Rechiar. Subsequently, this new king started to print coins under his own name, becoming the first of the Germanic kings to do so, and then was baptised to Nicene Christianity, probably by the Bishop Balconius, also becoming the first of the Germanic kings to do so, even before Clovis, king of the Franks. This bellicose king, almost conquered the whole of Hispania, taking many prisoners and several important cities, but failed to consolidate his conquest over the territory and didn&#x27;t even come near Tarragona.

After the assassination of the patrician Flavius Aëtius, Rechiar attempted, yet again, to conquer the whole of the peninsula, however his ambitions were derailed by the invading Visigoths under their king and Roman &quot;foederatus&quot; Theodoric II acting on the orders of the emperor Avitus. This led to a resounding defeat of the Suebian kingdom, with Rechiar fleeing wounded from Braga, only to be captured at Oporto and executed in December of 456 (d.C.). The realm was then divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457–459) reunified the kingdom. He was assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.
Although the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:
Frumar (Frumario 459–463) and Remismund (Remismundo, son of Maldras) (459–469) who would re-reunify his father&#x27;s kingdom in 463. He would be forced to adopt Arianism in 465 due to the Visigoth influence. From 470, conflict between the Suebi and Visigoths increased.

=== The Visigoths ===
By 500, the Visigothic Kingdom had been installed in Iberia, it was based in Toledo and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.
After the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that Theodemund (Teodemundo) most likely ruled the Suebians.

The dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550–559) who reinstalled Catholic Christianity in 550. He was succeeded by Theodemar (559–570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held. After the death of Theodemar, Miro (570–583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held. The councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the Christianization of the pagan population (&quot;De correctione rusticorum&quot;) under the auspices of Saint Martin of Braga (São Martinho de Braga).

The Visigothic civil war began in 577, in which Miro intervened. Later, in 583, he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed campaign Miro died, thereby ending the prominence of the Suebi in Hispanic politics, and in two years the kingdom would be conquered by the Visigoths.

In the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. Eborico (Eurico, 583–584) was dethroned by Andeca (Audeca 584–585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Liuvigild. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Visigothic kingdom.
Leovigild was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and Gallia Narbonensis.

For the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths. With the Visigoths settled in the newly formed kingdom, a new class emerged that had been unknown in Roman times: a nobility, which played a large social and political role during the Middle Ages. It was under the Visigoths that the Church began to play an important part within the state. Since the Visigoths did not learn Latin from the local people, they had to rely on Catholic bishops to continue the Roman system of governance. The laws established during the Visigothic monarchy were thus made by councils of bishops, and the clergy started to emerge as a high-ranking class.

Under the Visigoths, Gallaecia was a well-defined space governed by a doge of its own. Doges at this time were related to the monarchy and acted as princes in all matters. Both &#x27;governors&#x27; Wamba and Wittiza (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo). These two became known as the &#x27;vitizians&#x27;, who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711. King Roderic (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia. From the various Germanic groups who settled in western Iberia, the Suebi left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.
According to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.
Bracara Augusta, the modern city of Braga and former capital of Gallaecia, became the capital of the Suebi. Apart from cultural and some linguistic traces, the Suebians left the highest Germanic genetic contribution of the Iberian Peninsula in Portugal and Galicia. Orosius, at that time resident in Hispania, shows a rather pacific initial settlement, the newcomers working their lands or serving as bodyguards of the locals.
Another Germanic group that accompanied the Suebi and settled in Gallaecia were the Buri. They settled in the region between the rivers &quot;Cávado&quot; and &quot;Homem&quot;, in the area known as Terras de Bouro (Lands of the Buri).

== Al-Andalus (711–868) ==

During the caliphate of the Umayyad Caliph Al-Walid I, commander Tariq ibn-Ziyad led a small force that landed at Gibraltar on 30 April 711, ostensibly to intervene in a Visigothic civil war. After a decisive victory over King Roderic at the Battle of Guadalete on 19 July 711, Tariq ibn-Ziyad, joined by the Arab governor Musa ibn Nusayr of Ifriqiya, brought most of the Visigothic kingdom under Muslim occupation in a seven-year campaign. The Visigothic resistance to this invasion was ineffective, though sieges were required to sack a couple of cities. This is in part because the ruling Visigoth population is estimated at a mere 1 to 2% of the total population. On one hand this isolation is said to have been &#x27;a reasonably strong and effective instrument of government&#x27;; on the other, it was highly &#x27;centralised to the extent that the defeat of the royal army left the entire land open to the invaders. The resulting power vacuum, which may have indeed caught Tariq completely by surprise, would have aided the Muslim conquest immensely. Indeed, it may have been equally welcome to the Hispano-Roman peasants whoas D.W. Lomax claimswere disillusioned by the prominent legal, linguistic and social divide between them and the &#x27;barbaric&#x27; and &#x27;decadent&#x27; Visigoth royalty.

The Visigothic territories included what is today Spain, Portugal, Andorra, Gibraltar, and the southwestern part of France known in ancient times as Septimania. The invading Moors wanted to conquer and convert all of Europe to Islam, so they crossed the Pyrenees to use Visigothic Septimania as a base of operations. Muslims called their conquests in Iberia &#x27;al-Andalus&#x27; and in what was to become Portugal, they mainly consisted of the old Roman province of Lusitania (the central and southern regions of the country), while Gallaecia (the northern regions) remained unsubdued. Until the Berber revolt in the 730s, al-Andalus was treated as a dependency of Umayyad North Africa. Subsequently, links were strained until the caliphate was overthrown in the late 740s. The Medieval Muslim Moors, who conquered and destroyed the Christian Visigothic kingdom in the Iberian Peninsula, were a mix of Berbers from North Africa and Arabs from the Middle East.
By 714 Évora, Santarém and Coimbra had been conquered, and two years later Lisbon was in Muslim control. By 718 most of today&#x27;s Portuguese territory was under Umayyad rule. The Umayyads eventually stopped in Poitiers but Muslim rule in Iberia would last until 1492 with the fall of the Kingdom of Granada. For the next several centuries, much of the Iberian Peninsula remained under Umayyad rule. Much of the populace was allowed to remain Christian, and many of the lesser feudal rulers worked out deals where they would submit to Umayyad rule in order to remain in power. They would pay a jizya tax, kill or turn over rebels, and in return receive support from the central government. But some regions, including Lisbon, Gharb Al-Andalus, and the rest of what would become Portugal, rebelled, succeeded in freeing themselves by the early 10th century

== Reconquista ==

In 718 AD, a Visigothic noble named Pelagius was elected leader by the ousted Visigoth nobles. Pelagius called for the remnant of the Christian Visigothic armies to rebel against the Moors and re-group in the unconquered northern Asturian highlands, better known today as the Cantabrian Mountains, a mountain region in modern northwestern Spain adjacent to the Bay of Biscay. He planned to use the Cantabrian Mountain range as a place of refuge and protection from the invaders and as a springboard to reconquer lands from the Moors. After defeating the Moors in the Battle of Covadonga in 722 AD, Pelagius was proclaimed king to found the Christian Kingdom of Asturias and start the war of reconquest known in Portuguese (and Spanish) as the &quot;Reconquista&quot;.

Currently, historians and archaeologists generally agree that northern Portugal between the Minho and the Douro rivers kept a significant share of its population, a social and political Christian area that until the late 9th century had no acting state powers. However, in the late 9th century, the region became part of a complex of powers, the Galician-Asturian, Leonese and Portuguese power structures.

The coastal regions in the North were also attacked by Norman and Viking raiders mainly from 844. The last great invasion, through the Minho (river), ended with the defeat of Olaf II Haraldsson in 1014 against the Galician nobility who also stopped further advances into the County of Portugal.

=== Creation of the County of Portugal ===

At the end of the 9th century, a small minor county based in the area of Portus Cale was established by Vímara Peres on the orders of King Alfonso III of León, Galicia and Asturias. After annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up its realms, King Alfonso III named Vímara Peres as its first count. Since the rule of Count Diogo Fernandes, the county increased in size and importance and, from the 10th century onward, with Count Gonçalo Mendes as &quot;Magnus Dux Portucalensium&quot; (Grand Duke of the Portuguese), the Portuguese counts started using the title of duke, indicating even larger importance and territory. The region became known simultaneously as &quot;Portucale&quot;, &quot;Portugale&quot;, and &quot;Portugalia&quot;the County of Portugal. The Kingdom of Asturias was later divided as a result of dynastic disputes; the northern region of Portugal became part of the Kingdom of Galicia and later part of the Kingdom of León.

Suebi-Visigothic arts and architecture, in particular sculpture, had shown a natural continuity with the Roman period. With the Reconquista, new artistic trends took hold, with Galician-Asturian influences more visible than the Leonese. The Portuguese group was characterized by a general return to classicism. The county courts of Viseu and Coimbra played a very important role in this process. Mozarabic architecture was found in the south, in Lisbon and beyond, while in the Christian realms Galician-Portuguese and Asturian architecture prevailed.

As a vassal of the Kingdom of León, Portugal grew in power and territory and occasionally gained &quot;de facto&quot; independence during weak Leonese reigns; Count Mendo Gonçalves even became regent of the Kingdom of Leon between 999 and 1008. In 1070, the Portuguese Count Nuno Mendes desired the Portuguese title and fought the Battle of Pedroso on 18 February 1071 with Garcia II of Galicia, who gained the Galician title, which included Portugal, after the 1065 partition of the Leonese realms. The battle resulted in Nuno Mendes&#x27; death and the declaration of Garcia as King of Portugal, the first person to claim this title. Garcia styled himself as &quot;King of Portugal and Galicia&quot; (&quot;Garcia Rex Portugallie et Galleciae&quot;). Garcia&#x27;s brothers, Sancho II of Castile and Alfonso VI of Leon, united and annexed Garcia&#x27;s kingdom in 1071 as well. They agreed to split it among themselves; however, Sancho was killed by a noble the next year. Alfonso took Castile for himself and Garcia recovered his kingdom of Portugal and Galicia. In 1073, Alfonso VI gathered all power, and beginning in 1077, styled himself &quot;Imperator totius Hispaniæ&quot; (Emperor of All Hispania). When the emperor died, the Crown was left to his daughter Urraca, while his illegitimate daughter Teresa inherited the County of Portugal; in 1095, Portugal broke away from the Kingdom of Galicia. Its territories, consisting largely of mountains, moorland and forests, were bounded on the north by the Minho River, and on the south by the Mondego River.

=== Foundation of the Kingdom of Portugal ===

At the end of the 11th century, the Burgundian knight Henry became count of Portugal and defended its independence by merging the County of Portugal and the County of Coimbra. His efforts were assisted by a civil war that raged between León and Castile and distracted his enemies. Henry&#x27;s son Afonso Henriques took control of the county upon his death. The city of Braga, the unofficial Catholic centre of the Iberian Peninsula, faced new competition from other regions. Lords of the cities of Coimbra and Porto fought with Braga&#x27;s clergy and demanded the independence of the reconstituted county.

Portugal traces its national origin to 24 June 1128, the date of the Battle of São Mamede. Afonso proclaimed himself &quot;Prince of Portugal&quot; after this battle and in 1139, he assumed the title &quot;King of Portugal&quot;. In 1143, the Kingdom of León recognised him as King of Portugal by the Treaty of Zamora. In 1179, the papal bull Manifestis Probatum of Pope Alexander III officially recognised Afonso I as king. After the Battle of São Mamede, the first capital of Portugal was Guimarães, from which the first king ruled. Later, when Portugal was already officially independent, he ruled from Coimbra.

=== Affirmation of Portugal ===

The Algarve, the southernmost region of Portugal, was finally conquered from the Moors in 1249, and in 1255 the capital shifted to Lisbon. Spain finally completed its &quot;Reconquista&quot; until 1492, almost 250 years later. Portugal&#x27;s land boundaries have been notably stable for the rest of the country&#x27;s history. The border with Spain has remained almost unchanged since the 13th century. The Treaty of Windsor (1386) created an alliance between Portugal and England that remains in effect to this day. Since early times, fishing and overseas commerce have been the main economic activities.

In 1383, John I of Castile, husband of Beatrice of Portugal and son-in-law of Ferdinand I of Portugal, claimed the throne of Portugal. A faction of petty noblemen and commoners, led by John of Aviz (later King John I of Portugal) and commanded by General Nuno Álvares Pereira defeated the Castilians in the Battle of Aljubarrota. With this battle, the House of Aviz became the ruling house of Portugal.

The new ruling dynasty would proceed to push Portugal to the limelight of European politics and culture, creating and sponsoring works of literature, like the &quot;Crónicas d&#x27;el Rei D. João I&quot; by Fernão Lopes, the first riding and hunting manual &quot;Livro da ensinança de bem cavalgar toda sela&quot; and &quot;O Leal Conselheiro&quot; both by King Edward of Portugal and the Portuguese translations of Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De Oficiis&quot; and Seneca&#x27;s &quot;De Beneficiis&quot; by the well traveled Prince Peter of Coimbra, as well as his magnum opus &quot;Tratado da Vertuosa Benfeytoria&quot;. In an effort of solidification and centralization of royal power the monarchs of this dynasty also ordered the compilation, organization and publication of the first three compilations of laws in Portugal: the &quot;Ordenações d&#x27;el Rei D. Duarte&quot;, which was never enforced; the &quot;Ordenações Afonsinas,&quot; whose application and enforcement was not uniform across the realm; and the &quot;Ordenações Manuelinas&quot;, which took advantage of the printing press to reach every corner of the kingdom. The Avis Dynasty also sponsored works of architecture like the &quot;Mosteiro da Batalha&quot; (literally, the Monastery of the Battle) and led to the creation of the manueline style of architecture in the 16th century.

== Naval exploration and Portuguese Empire (15th–16th centuries) ==


During the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal became a leading European power that ranked with England, France and Spain in terms of economic, political and cultural influence. Though not dominant in European affairs, Portugal did have an extensive colonial trading empire throughout the world backed by a powerful thalassocracy. Portugal was a pioneer in, and major beneficiary of, the Atlantic slave trade, leading to nearly four centuries of Slavery in Portugal. 

The beginnings of the Portuguese Empire can be traced to 25 July 1415, when the Portuguese set sail for the rich Islamic trading center of Ceuta in North Africa. The Armada was accompanied by King John I, his sons Prince Duarte (a future king), Prince Pedro, and Prince Henry the Navigator, and the legendary Portuguese hero Nuno Álvares Pereira. On 21 August 1415, Ceuta was conquered by Portugal, and the long-lived Portuguese Empire was founded.

The conquest of Ceuta was facilitated by a major civil war that had been engaging the Muslims of the Maghreb (North Africa) since 1411. This civil war prevented a re-capture of Ceuta from the Portuguese, when the king of Granada Muhammed IX, the Left-Handed, laid siege to Ceuta and attempted to coordinate forces in Morocco and attract aid and assistance for the effort from Tunis. The Muslim attempt to retake Ceuta was ultimately unsuccessful and Ceuta remained the first part of the new Portuguese Empire. Further steps were taken that soon expanded the Portuguese Empire much further.

In 1418, two of Prince Henry the Navigator&#x27;s captains, João Gonçalves Zarco and Tristão Vaz Teixeira, were driven by a storm to an island that they called Porto Santo (&quot;Holy Port&quot;) in gratitude for their rescue from the shipwreck. In 1419, João Gonçalves Zarco disembarked on the Island of Madeira. Uninhabited Madeira was colonized by the Portuguese in 1420.

Between 1427 and 1431, most of the Azores were discovered and these uninhabited islands were colonized by the Portuguese in 1445. Portuguese expeditions may have attempted to colonize the Canary Islands as early as 1336, but the Crown of Castile objected to any Portuguese claim to them. Castile began its own conquest of the Canaries in 1402. Castile expelled the last Portuguese from the Canary islands in 1459, and they eventually became part of the Spanish Empire.

In 1434, Gil Eanes passed Cape Bojador, south of Morocco. The trip marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of Africa. Before this event, very little was known in Europe about what lay beyond the cape. At the end of the 13th century and the beginning of the 14th, those who tried to venture there became lost, which gave birth to legends of sea monsters. Some setbacks occurred: in 1436 the Canaries were officially recognized as Castilian by the popeearlier they had been recognized as Portuguese; in 1438, the Portuguese were defeated in a military expedition to Tangier.

These setbacks did not deter the Portuguese from pursuing their exploratory efforts. In 1448, on the small island of Arguim off the coast of Mauritania, an important castle was built to function as a &quot;feitoria&quot;, or trading post, for commerce with inland Africa. Some years before, the first African gold was brought to Portugal that circumvented the Arab caravans that crossed the Sahara. Some time later, the caravels explored the Gulf of Guinea, which led to the discovery of several uninhabited islands: Cape Verde, São Tomé, Príncipe and Annobón.

On 13 November 1460, Prince Henry the Navigator died. He had been the leading patron of maritime exploration by Portugal and immediately following his death, exploration lapsed. Henry&#x27;s patronage had shown that profits could be made from the trade that followed the discovery of new lands. Accordingly, when exploration commenced again, private merchants led the way in attempting to stretch trade routes further down the African coast.

In the 1470s, Portuguese trading ships reached the Gold Coast. In 1471, the Portuguese captured Tangier, after years of attempts. Eleven years later, the fortress of São Jorge da Mina in the town of Elmina on the Gold Coast in the Gulf of Guinea was built. Christopher Columbus set sail aboard the fleet of ships taking materials and building crews to Elmina in December 1481. In 1483, Diogo Cão reached and explored the Congo River.

=== Discovery of the sea route to India and the Treaty of Tordesillas ===

In 1484, Portugal officially rejected Columbus&#x27; idea of reaching India from the west, because it was seen as unfeasible. Some historians have claimed that the Portuguese had already performed fairly accurate calculations concerning the size of the world and therefore knew that sailing west to reach the Indies would require a far longer journey than navigating to the east. However, this continues to be debated. Thus began a long-lasting dispute that eventually resulted in the signing of the Treaty of Tordesillas with Castile in 1494. The treaty divided the (largely undiscovered) New World equally between the Portuguese and the Castilians, along a north–south meridian line 370 leagues (1770 km/1100 miles) west of the Cape Verde islands, with all lands to the east belonging to Portugal and all lands to the west to Castile.
With the expedition beyond the Cape of Good Hope by Bartolomeu Dias in 1487, the richness of India was now accessible. Indeed, the cape takes its name from the promise of rich trade with the east. Between 1498 and 1501, Pero de Barcelos and João Fernandes Lavrador explored North America. At the same time, Pero da Covilhã reached Ethiopia by land. Vasco da Gama sailed for India and arrived at Calicut on 20 May 1498, returning in glory to Portugal the next year. The Monastery of Jerónimos was built, dedicated to the discovery of the route to India.

At the end of the 15th century, Portugal expelled some local Sephardic Jews, along with those refugees who had come from Castile and Aragon after 1492. In addition, many Jews were forcibly converted to Catholicism and remained as &quot;conversos&quot;. Many Jews remained secretly Jewish, in danger of persecution by the Portuguese Inquisition. In 1506, 3,000 New Christians were massacred in Lisbon.

In early 1500, Pedro Álvares Cabral set sail from Cape Verde with 13 ships and crews and nobles such as Nicolau Coelho; the explorer Bartolomeu Dias and his brother Diogo; Duarte Pacheco Pereira (author of the &quot;Esmeraldo&quot;); nine chaplains; and some 1,200 men. From Cape Verde, they sailed southwest across the Atlantic. On 22 April 1500, they caught sight of land in the distance. They disembarked and claimed this new land for Portugal. This was the coast of what later became the Portuguese colony of Brazil.

The real goal of the expedition was to open sea trade to the empires of the east. Trade with the east had effectively been cut off since the Conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Accordingly, Cabral turned away from exploring the coast of the new land of Brazil and sailed southeast, back across the Atlantic and around the Cape of Good Hope. Cabral reached Sofala on the east coast of Africa in July 1500. In 1505, a Portuguese fort was established here and the land around the fort later formed the Portuguese colony of Mozambique.

Cabral&#x27;s fleet then sailed east and landed in Calicut in India in September 1500. Here they traded for pepper and opened European sea trade with the empires of the east. No longer would the Muslim Ottoman occupation of Constantinople form a barrier between Europe and the east. Ten years later, in 1510, Afonso de Albuquerque, after attempting and failing to capture and occupy Zamorin&#x27;s Calicut militarily, conquered Goa on the west coast of India.

João da Nova discovered Ascension Island in 1501 and Saint Helena in 1502; Tristão da Cunha was the first to sight the archipelago still known by his name in 1506. In 1505, Francisco de Almeida was engaged to improve Portuguese trade with the far east. Accordingly, he sailed to East Africa. Several small Islamic states along the coast of MozambiqueKilwa, Brava and Mombasawere destroyed or became subjects or allies of Portugal. Almeida then sailed on to Cochin, made peace with the ruler and built a stone fort there.

==== Portuguese Empire ====
By the 16th century, the two million people who lived in the original Portuguese lands ruled a vast empire with many millions of inhabitants in the Americas, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. From 1514, the Portuguese had reached China and Japan. In the Indian Ocean and Arabian Sea, one of Cabral&#x27;s ships discovered Madagascar (1501), which was partly explored by Tristão da Cunha (1507); Mauritius was discovered in 1507, Socotra occupied in 1506, and in the same year, Lourenço de Almeida visited Ceylon.

In the Red Sea, Massawa was the most northerly point frequented by the Portuguese until 1541, when a fleet under Estevão da Gama penetrated as far as Suez. Hormuz, in the Persian Gulf, was seized by Afonso de Albuquerque in 1515, who also entered into diplomatic relations with Persia. In 1521, a force under Antonio Correia conquered Bahrain and ushered in a period of almost 80 years of Portuguese rule of the Persian Gulf archipelago

On the Asiatic mainland, the first trading stations were established by Pedro Álvares Cabral at Cochin and Calicut (1501). More important were the conquests of Goa (1510) and Malacca (1511) by Afonso de Albuquerque, and the acquisition of Diu (1535) by Martim Afonso de Sousa. East of Malacca, Albuquerque sent Duarte Fernandes as envoy to Siam (now Thailand) in 1511 and dispatched to the Moluccas two expeditions (1512, 1514), which founded the Portuguese dominion in Maritime Southeast Asia. The Portuguese established their base in the Spice Islands on the island of Ambon. Fernão Pires de Andrade visited Canton in 1517 and opened up trade with China, where, in 1557, the Portuguese were permitted to occupy Macau. Japan, accidentally reached by three Portuguese traders in 1542, soon attracted large numbers of merchants and missionaries. In 1522, one of the ships in the expedition that Ferdinand Magellan organized in the Spanish service completed the first circumnavigation of the globe.

== 1580 succession crisis, Iberian Union and decline of the Empire ==
On 4 August 1578, while fighting in Morocco, young King Sebastian died in the Battle of Alcácer Quibir without an heir. The late king&#x27;s elderly great-uncle, Cardinal Henry, then became king. Henry I died a mere two years later, on 31 January 1580. The death of the latter, without any appointed heirs, led to the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580. Portugal was worried about the maintenance of its independence and sought help to find a new king.

One of the claimants to the throne, António, Prior of Crato, a bastard son of Infante Louis, Duke of Beja, and only grandson through the male line of king Manuel I of Portugal, lacked support from the clergy and most of the nobility, but was acclaimed as king in Santarém and in some other towns in June 1580.

Philip II of Spain, through his mother Isabella of Portugal, also a grandson of Manuel I, claimed the Portuguese throne and did not recognize António as king of Portugal. The king appointed Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba, as captain general of his army. The duke was 73 years old and ill at the time, but Fernando mustered his forces, estimated at 20,000 men, in Badajoz, and in June 1580 crossed the Spanish-Portuguese border and moved towards Lisbon.

The Duke of Alba met little resistance and in July set up his forces at Cascais, west of Lisbon. By mid-August, the Duke was only 10 kilometers from the city. West of the small brook Alcântara, the Spanish encountered a Portuguese force on the eastern side of it, commanded by António, and his lieutenant Francisco de Portugal, 3rd Count of Vimioso. In late August, the Duke of Alba defeated António&#x27;s force, a ragtag army assembled in a hurry and composed mainly of local peasants, and freed slaves at the Battle of Alcântara. This battle ended in a decisive victory for the Spanish army, both on land and sea. Two days later, the Duke of Alba captured Lisbon, and on 25 March 1581, Philip II of Spain was crowned King of Portugal in Tomar as Philip I. This cleared the way for Philip to create an Iberian Union spanning all of Iberia under the Spanish crown.

Philip rewarded the Duke of Alba with the titles of 1st Viceroy of Portugal on 18 July 1580 and Constable of Portugal in 1581. With these titles, the Duke of Alba represented the Spanish monarch in Portugal and was second in hierarchy only after King Philip in Portugal. He held both titles until his death in 1582. The Portuguese and Spanish Empires came under a single rule, but resistance to Spanish rule in Portugal did not come to an end. The Prior of Crato held out in the Azores until 1583, and he continued to seek to recover the throne actively until his death in 1595. Impostors claimed to be King Sebastian in 1584, 1585, 1595 and 1598. &quot;Sebastianism&quot;, the myth that the young king will return to Portugal on a foggy day, has prevailed until modern times.

=== Decline of the Portuguese Empire under the Philippine Dynasty ===
After the 16th century, Portugal gradually saw its wealth and influence decrease. Portugal was officially an autonomous state, but in actuality, the country was in a personal union with the Spanish crown from 1580 to 1640. The &quot;Council of Portugal&quot; remained independent inasmuch as it was one of the key administrative units of the Castilian monarchy, legally on equal terms with the Council of the Indies. The joining of the two crowns deprived Portugal of a separate foreign policy, and the enemies of Spain became the enemies of Portugal. England had been an ally of Portugal since the Treaty of Windsor in 1386, but war between Spain and England led to a deterioration of the relations with Portugal&#x27;s oldest ally and the loss of Hormuz in 1622. From 1595 to 1663, the Dutch–Portuguese War led to invasions of many countries in Asia and competition for commercial interests in Japan, Africa and South America. In 1624, the Dutch seized Salvador, the capital of Brazil; in 1630, they seized Pernambuco in northern Brazil. A treaty of 1654 returned Pernambuco to Portuguese control, however. Both the English and the Dutch continued to aspire to dominate both the Atlantic slave trade and the spice trade with the Far East.

The Dutch intrusion into Brazil was long-lasting and troublesome to Portugal. The Dutch captured the entire coast except that of Bahia and much of the interior of the contemporary Northeastern Brazilian states of Bahia, Sergipe, Alagoas, Pernambuco, Paraíba, Rio Grande do Norte and Ceará, while Dutch privateers sacked Portuguese ships in both the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Beginning with a major Spanish–Portuguese military operation in 1625, this trend was reversed, and it laid the foundations for the recovery of remaining Dutch-controlled areas. The other smaller, less developed areas were recovered in stages and relieved of Dutch piracy in the next two decades by local resistance and Portuguese expeditions. After the dissolution of the Iberian Union in 1640, Portugal would re-establish its authority over some lost territories of the Portuguese Empire.

== Portuguese Restoration War (1640–1668) ==
At home, there was peace under the first two Spanish kings, Philip II and Philip III. They maintained Portugal&#x27;s status, gave positions to Portuguese nobles in the Spanish courts, and Portugal maintained an independent law, currency and government. It was proposed to move the Spanish capital to Lisbon. Later, Philip IV tried to make Portugal a Spanish province, and Portuguese nobles lost power.

Because of this, as well as the general strain on the finances of the Spanish throne as a result of the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the Duke of Braganza, one of the native noblemen and a descendant of King Manuel I, was proclaimed King of Portugal as John IV on 1 December 1640, and a war of independence against Spain was launched. The governors of Ceuta did not accept the new king; rather, they maintained their allegiance to Philip IV and Spain. The Portuguese Restoration War ended the sixty-year period of the Iberian Union under the House of Habsburg. This was the beginning of the House of Braganza, which reigned in Portugal until 1910.

King John IV&#x27;s eldest son came to reign as Afonso VI, however his physical and mental disabilities left him overpowered by Luís de Vasconcelos e Sousa, 3rd Count of Castelo Melhor. In a palace coup organized by the King&#x27;s wife, Maria Francisca of Savoy, and his brother, Pedro, Duke of Beja, King Afonso VI was declared mentally incompetent and exiled first to the Azores, and then to the Royal Palace of Sintra, outside Lisbon. After Afonso&#x27;s death, Pedro came to the throne as King Pedro II. Pedro&#x27;s reign saw the consolidation of national independence, imperial expansion, and investment in domestic production.

Pedro II&#x27;s son, John V, saw a reign characterized by the influx of gold into the coffers of the royal treasury, supplied largely by the royal fifth (a tax on precious metals), that was received from the Portuguese colonies of Brazil and Maranhão. Disregarding traditional Portuguese institutions of governance, John V acted as an absolute monarch, nearly depleting the country&#x27;s tax revenues on ambitious architectural works, most notably Mafra Palace, and on commissions and additions for his sizeable art and literary collections.

Owing to his craving for international diplomatic recognition, John also spent large sums on the embassies he sent to the courts of Europe, the most famous being those he sent to Paris in 1715 and Rome in 1716.

Official estimates – and most estimates made so far – place the number of Portuguese migrants to Colonial Brazil during the gold rush of the 18th century at 600,000. This represented one of the largest movements of European populations to their colonies in the Americas during colonial times. From 1709, John V prohibited emigration, since Portugal had lost a sizable proportion of its population. Brazil was elevated to a vice-kingdom.

== Pombaline era ==

In 1738, Sebastião de Melo, the talented son of a Lisbon squire, began a diplomatic career as the Portuguese Ambassador in London and later in Vienna. The Queen regent of Portugal, Maria Anna of Austria, was fond of De Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo&#x27;s second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian field marshal Leopold Josef, Count von Daun. King John V of Portugal however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year, and his son Joseph I of Portugal was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the Maria Anna&#x27;s approval, he appointed Melo as Minister of Foreign Affairs. As the king&#x27;s confidence in de Melo increased, he entrusted him with more control of the state.

By 1755, Sebastião de Melo was made prime-minister. Impressed by British economic success he had witnessed while ambassador, he successfully implemented similar economic policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India; reorganized the army and the navy; restructured the University of Coimbra; and ended discrimination against different Christian sects in Portugal.
But Sebastião de Melo&#x27;s greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of port to ensure the wine&#x27;s quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law on all classes of Portuguese society, from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country&#x27;s tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.

Disaster fell upon Portugal in the morning of 1 November 1755, when Lisbon was struck by a violent earthquake with an estimated Richter scale magnitude of 9. The city was razed to the ground by the earthquake and the subsequent tsunami and fires. De Melo survived by a stroke of luck and immediately embarked on rebuilding the city, with his famous quote: &quot;What now? We bury the dead and feed the living.&quot;

Despite the natural disaster, Lisbon&#x27;s population suffered no epidemics and within less than one year the city was being rebuilt. The new Lisbon downtown was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline Downtown of Lisbon still remain as one of Lisbon&#x27;s tourist attractions: they represent the world&#x27;s first Earthquake-resistant structures. Sebastião de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of seismology by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.

Following the earthquake, Joseph I gave his prime minister even more power, and Sebastião de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758, Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The Távora family and the Duke of Aveiro were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The Jesuits were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebastião de Melo showed no mercy and prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy and ensured the victory of the minister against his enemies. Based upon his swift resolve, Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of Oeiras in 1759.

Following the Távora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made &quot;Marquis of Pombal&quot; in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I&#x27;s death in 1779. However, historians also argue that Pombal&#x27;s &quot;enlightenment&quot; and economic progress, while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, furthering colonial exploitation, intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.

The new ruler, Queen Maria I of Portugal, disliked the Marquis (See &quot;Távora affair&quot;), and forbade him from coming within 20 miles of her, thus curtailing his influence.

=== Portuguese-led invasion of Spain in 1707 ===
In 1707, as part of the War of the Spanish Succession, a joint Portuguese, Dutch, and British army, led by the Marquis of Minas, António Luís de Sousa, conquered Madrid and acclaimed the Archduke Charles of Austria as King Charles III of Spain. Along the route to Madrid, the army led by the Marquis of Minas was successful in conquering Ciudad Rodrigo and Salamanca. Later in the following year, Madrid was reconquered by Spanish troops loyal to the Bourbons.

=== &quot;The Ghost War&quot; ===

In 1762, France and Spain tried to urge Portugal to join the Bourbon Family Compact by claiming that Great Britain had become too powerful due to its successes in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Joseph refused to accept and maintained that his 1704 alliance with Britain was no threat.

In spring 1762, Spanish and French troops invaded Portugal from the north as far as the Douro, while a second column sponsored the Siege of Almeida, captured the city, and threatened to advance on Lisbon. The arrival of a force of British troops helped the Portuguese army commanded by the Count of Lippe by blocking the Franco-Spanish advance and driving them back across the border following the Battle of Valencia de Alcántara. At the Treaty of Paris in 1763, Spain agreed to hand Almeida back to Portugal.

== Crises of the nineteenth century ==
=== Napoleonic era ===

With the invasions by Napoleon, Portugal began a decline that lasted until the 20th century, it was hastened by the independence of Brazil in 1822, the country&#x27;s largest colonial possession.

In 1807, Portugal refused Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s demand to accede to the Continental System of embargo against the United Kingdom; a French invasion under General Junot followed, and Lisbon was captured on 8 December 1807. British intervention in the Peninsular War helped in maintaining Portuguese independence. During the war, João VI of Portugal, the prince regent, transferred his court, including Maria I, to the Portuguese territory of Brazil, and established Rio de Janeiro as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. This episode is known as the Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil. The last French troops were expelled in 1812. The war cost Portugal the town of Olivença, now governed by Spain. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental state, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.
As a result of the change in its status and arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, economical, military, educational, and scientific apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. By 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that João VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the Liberal Revolution of 1820, which started in Porto, demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.

Thus he returned to Portugal but left his son Pedro in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared Brazil&#x27;s independence from Portugal. Cisplatina (today&#x27;s sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.

Brazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of &quot;Emperor of Brazil&quot;. John VI&#x27;s death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, Maria II. However, Pedro&#x27;s brother, Infante Miguel, claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter&#x27;s rights to the throne, Pedro launched the Liberal Wars to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel&#x27;s defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.

After 1815, the Portuguese expanded their trading ports along the African coast, moving inland to take control of Angola and Mozambique. The slave trade was abolished in 1836, in part because many foreign slave ships were flying the Portuguese flag. In Portuguese India, trade flourished in the colony of Goa, with its subsidiary colonies of Macau, near Hong Kong on the China coast, and Timor, north of Australia. The Portuguese successfully introduced Catholicism and the Portuguese language into their colonies, while most settlers continued to head to Brazil.

=== Constitutional monarchy ===
Queen Maria II (Mary II) and King Ferdinand II&#x27;s son, King Pedro V (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853–1861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the cholera outbreak of 1853–1856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro&#x27;s reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers Infante Fernando and Infante João, Duke of Beja, and his wife, Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. Pedro not having children, his brother, Luís I of Portugal (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.

At the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. Luanda, Benguela, Bissau, Lourenço Marques, Porto Amboim and the Island of Mozambique were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.

With the Conference of Berlin of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the Scramble for Africa. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like Nova Lisboa, Sá da Bandeira, Silva Porto, Malanje, Tete, Vila Junqueiro, Vila Pery and Vila Cabral were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like Beira, Moçâmedes, Lobito, João Belo, Nacala and Porto Amélia were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the Benguela railway in Angola, and the Beira railway in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.

On 11 January 1890, the British government delivered an ultimatum to Portugal, demanding the withdrawal of Portuguese forces from the area between Portugal&#x27;s colonies of Mozambique and Angola. The area had been claimed by Portugal as part of its colonialist Pink Map project, but Britain disputed these claims, mostly due to Cecil Rhodes&#x27; aspirations to create a Cape to Cairo Railway, which was intended to link all British colonies via a single railway. The government of Portugal quietly accepted the ultimatum and withdrew their forces from the disputed area, leading to a widespread backlash among the Portuguese public, who viewed acceptance of the British demands as a humiliation. It is considered directly responsible for the 31 January 1891 revolt, an attempted Republican coup that took place in Porto.

The Portuguese territories in Africa were Cape Verde, São Tomé and Príncipe, Portuguese Guinea, Angola, and Mozambique. The tiny fortress of São João Baptista de Ajudá on the coast of Dahomey, was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of Portuguese India, Portuguese Timor and Portuguese Macau.

On 1 February 1908, King Dom Carlos I of Portugal and his heir apparent and his eldest son, Prince Royal Dom Luís Filipe, Duke of Braganza, were assassinated in Lisbon in the Terreiro do Paço by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, Alfredo Luís da Costa and Manuel Buíça. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared bankrupt twice – first on 14 June 1892, and then again on 10 May 1902 – causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, Manuel II of Portugal, became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the 5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution, which abolished the monarchy and installed a republican government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into exile in London, England.

== The First Republic (1910–1926) ==
The First Republic has, over the course of the recent past, been neglected by many historians in favor of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot;. As a result, it is difficult to attempt a global synthesis of the republican period in view of the important gaps that still persist in our knowledge of its political history. As far as the 5 October 1910 Revolution is concerned, a number of valuable studies have been made, first among which ranks Vasco Pulido Valente&#x27;s polemical thesis. This historian posited the Jacobin and urban nature of the revolution carried out by the Portuguese Republican Party (PRP) and claimed that the PRP had turned the republican regime into a de facto dictatorship. This vision clashes with an older interpretation of the First Republic as a progressive and increasingly democratic regime that presented a clear contrast to António de Oliveira Salazar&#x27;s ensuing dictatorship.

=== Religion ===
The First Republic was intensely anti-clerical. It was secularist and followed the liberal tradition of disestablishing the powerful role that the Catholic Church once held. Historian Stanley Payne points out, &quot;The majority of Republicans took the position that Catholicism was the number one enemy of individualistic middle-class radicalism and must be completely broken as a source of influence in Portugal.&quot; Under the leadership of Afonso Costa, the justice minister, the revolution immediately targeted the Catholic Church: churches were plundered, convents were attacked and clergy were harassed. Scarcely had the provisional government been installed when it began devoting its entire attention to an anti-religious policy, in spite of the disastrous economic situation. On 10 Octoberfive days after the inauguration of the Republicthe new government decreed that all convents, monasteries and religious orders were to be suppressed. All residents of religious institutions were expelled and their goods confiscated. The Jesuits were forced to forfeit their Portuguese citizenship.

A series of anti-Catholic laws and decrees followed each other in rapid succession. On 3 November, a law legalizing divorce was passed and then there were laws to recognize the legitimacy of children born outside wedlock, authorize cremation, secularize cemeteries, suppress religious teaching in the schools and prohibit the wearing of the cassock. In addition, the ringing of church bells to signal times of worship was subjected to certain restraints, and the public celebration of religious feasts was suppressed. The government also interfered in the running of seminaries, reserving the right to appoint professors and determine curricula. This whole series of laws authored by Afonso Costa culminated in the law of Separation of Church and State, which was passed on 20 April 1911.

=== Constitution ===
A republican constitution was approved in 1911, inaugurating a parliamentary regime with reduced presidential powers and two chambers of parliament. The Republic provoked important fractures within Portuguese society, notably among the essentially monarchist rural population, in the trade unions, and in the Church. Even the PRP had to endure the secession of its more moderate elements, who formed conservative republican parties like the Evolutionist Party and the Republican Union. In spite of these splits, the PRP, led by Afonso Costa, preserved its dominance, largely due to a brand of clientelist politics inherited from the monarchy. In view of these tactics, a number of opposition forces were forced to resort to violence in order to enjoy the fruits of power. There are few recent studies of this period of the Republic&#x27;s existence, known as the &#x27;old&#x27; Republic. Nevertheless, an essay by Vasco Pulido Valente should be consulted (1997a), as should the attempt to establish the political, social, and economic context made by M. Villaverde Cabral (1988).

The PRP viewed the outbreak of the First World War as a unique opportunity to achieve a number of goals: putting an end to the twin threats of a Spanish invasion of Portugal and of foreign occupation of the African colonies and, at the internal level, creating a national consensus around the regime and even around the party. These domestic objectives were not met, since participation in the conflict was not the subject of a national consensus and since it did not therefore serve to mobilise the population. Quite the opposite occurred: existing lines of political and ideological fracture were deepened by Portugal&#x27;s intervention in the First World War. The lack of consensus around Portugal&#x27;s intervention in turn made possible the appearance of two dictatorships, led by General Pimenta de Castro (January–May 1915) and Sidónio Pais (December 1917 – December 1918).

&quot;&quot;, also known as &quot;Dezembrismo&quot; (&quot;Decemberism&quot;), aroused a strong interest among historians, largely as a result of the elements of modernity that it contained. António José Telo has made clear the way in which this regime predated some of the political solutions invented by the totalitarian and fascist dictatorships of the 1920s and 1930s. Sidónio Pais undertook the rescue of traditional values, notably the &quot;Pátria&quot; (&quot;Homeland&quot;), and attempted to rule in a charismatic fashion.

A move was made to abolish traditional political parties and to alter the existing mode of national representation in parliament (which, it was claimed, exacerbated divisions within the &quot;Pátria&quot;) through the creation of a corporative Senate, the founding of a single-party (the National Republican Party), and the attribution of a mobilising function to the leader. The state carved out an economically interventionist role for itself while, at the same time, repressing working-class movements and leftist republicans. Sidónio Pais also attempted to restore public order and to overcome some of the rifts of the recent past, making the republic more acceptable to monarchists and Catholics.

=== Political instability ===

The vacuum of power created by Sidónio Pais&#x27;s murder on 14 December 1918 led the country to a brief civil war. The monarchy&#x27;s restoration was proclaimed in the north of Portugal (known as the Monarchy of the North) on 19 January 1919, and four days later a monarchist insurrection broke out in Lisbon. A republican coalition government, led by José Relvas, coordinated the struggle against the monarchists by loyal army units and armed civilians. After a series of clashes the monarchists were definitively chased from Oporto on 13 February 1919. This military victory allowed the PRP to return to government and to emerge triumphant from the elections held later that year, having won the usual absolute majority.

It was during this restoration of the &#x27;old&#x27; republic that an attempted reform was carried out in order to provide the regime with greater stability. In August 1919 a conservative president was elected – António José de Almeida (whose Evolutionist party had come together in wartime with the PRP to form a flawed, because incomplete, Sacred Union) – and his office was given the power to dissolve parliament. Relations with the Holy See, restored by Sidónio Pais, were preserved. The president used his new power to resolve a crisis of government in May 1921, naming a Liberal government (the Liberal party being the result of the postwar fusion of Evolutionists and Unionists) to prepare the forthcoming elections.

These were held on 10 July 1921, with victory going, as was usually the case, to the party in power. However, Liberal government did not last long. On 19 October a military &quot;pronunciamento&quot; was carried out during which – and apparently against the wishes of the coup&#x27;s leaders – a number of prominent conservative figures, including Prime Minister António Granjo, were assassinated. This event, known as the &#x27;night of blood&#x27; left a deep wound among political elites and public opinion. There could be no greater demonstration of the essential fragility of the Republic&#x27;s institutions and proof that the regime was democratic in name only, since it did not even admit the possibility of the rotation in power characteristic of the elitist regimes of the nineteenth century.

A new round of elections on 29 January 1922 inaugurated a fresh period of stability: the PRP once again emerged from the contest with an absolute majority. Discontent with this situation had not, however, disappeared. Numerous accusations of corruption, and the manifest failure to resolve pressing social concerns wore down the more visible PRP leaders while making the opposition&#x27;s attacks more deadly. At the same time, moreover, all political parties suffered from growing internal factionalism, especially the PRP itself. The party system was fractured and discredited.

This is clearly shown by the fact that regular PRP victories at the ballot box did not lead to stable government. Between 1910 and 1926, there were forty-five governments. The opposition of presidents to single-party governments, internal dissent within the PRP, the party&#x27;s almost non-existent internal discipline, and its desire to group together and lead all republican forces made any government&#x27;s task practically impossible. Many different formulas were attempted, including single-party governments, coalitions, and presidential executives, but none succeeded. Force was clearly the sole means open to the opposition if the PRP wanted to enjoy the fruits of power.

=== Evaluation of the republican experiment ===
Historians have emphasized the failure and collapse of the republican dream by the 1920s. Sardica summarizes the consensus of historians:
:within a few years, large parts of the key economic forces, intellectuals, opinion-makers and middle classes changed from left to right, trading the unfulfilled utopia of a developing and civic republicanism for notions of &quot;order,&quot; &quot;stability&quot; and &quot;security&quot;. For many who had helped, supported or simply cheered the Republic in 1910, hoping that the new political situation would repair the monarchy&#x27;s flaws (government instability, financial crisis, economic backwardness and civic anomie), the conclusion to be drawn, in the 1920s, was that the remedy for national maladies called for much more than the simple removal of the king...The First Republic collapsed and died as a result of the confrontation between raised hopes and meager deeds.

Sardica, however, also points out the permanent impact of the republican experiment:
:Despite its overall failure, the First Republic endowed twentieth-century Portugal with an insurpassable and enduring legacya renewed civil law, the basis for an educational revolution, the principle of separation between State and Church, the overseas empire (only brought to an end in 1975), and a strong symbolic culture whose materializations (the national flag, the national anthem and the naming of streets) nobody has dared to alter and which still define the present-day collective identity of the Portuguese. The Republic&#x27;s prime legacy was indeed that of memory.

=== 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état ===


By the mid-1920s the domestic and international scenes began to favour another authoritarian solution, wherein a strengthened executive might restore political and social order. Since the opposition&#x27;s constitutional route to power was blocked by the various means deployed by the PRP to protect itself, it turned to the army for support. The political awareness of the armed forces had grown during the war, and many of their leaders had not forgiven the PRP for sending them to a war they did not want to fight.

They seemed to represent, to conservative forces, the last bastion of &#x27;order&#x27; against the &#x27;chaos&#x27; that was taking over the country. Links were established between conservative figures and military officers, who added their own political and corporative demands to the already complex equation. The 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état enjoyed the support of most army units and even of most political parties. As had been the case in December 1917, the population of Lisbon did not rise to defend the Republic, leaving it at the mercy of the army.

There are few global and up-to-date studies of this turbulent third phase of the Republic&#x27;s existence. Nevertheless, much has been written about the crisis and fall of the regime and the 28 May movement. The First Republic continues to be the subject of an intense debate. A historiographical balance sheet by Armando Malheiro da Silva (2000) identifies three main interpretations. For some historians the First Republic was a progressive and increasingly democratic regime. For others it was essentially a prolongation of the liberal and elitist regimes of the 19th century. A third group chooses to highlight the regime&#x27;s revolutionary, Jacobin and dictatorial nature.

== Estado Novo (1933–1974) ==
=== Salazar dictatorship ===
Political chaos, several strikes, harsh relations with the Church, and considerable economic problems aggravated by a disastrous military intervention in the First World War led to the military 28 May 1926 coup d&#x27;état. This coup installed the &quot;Second Republic&quot;, which started as the &quot;Ditadura Nacional&quot; (National Dictatorship) and became the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; (New State) in 1933, led by economist António de Oliveira Salazar. He transformed Portugal into a sort of Fascist regime that evolved into a single-party corporative regime. Portugal, although neutral, informally aided the Nationalists in the Spanish Civil War (1936–39).

Salazar&#x27;s policy after the war was to provide a certain level of liberalization in politics, in terms of organized opposition with more freedom of the press. Opposition parties were tolerated to an extent, but they were also controlled, limited, and manipulated, with the result that they split into factions and never formed a united opposition.

=== World War II ===
Portugal was officially neutral in World War II, but in practice Salazar collaborated with the British and sold them rubber and tungsten. In late 1943, he allowed the Allies to establish air bases in the Azores to fight German U-boats. Moreover, Salazar helped Spain avoid German control. However, as tungsten was a major product of Portugal, it was also sold to Germany until June 1944, when the threat of a German attack on Portugal was minimal. Salazar worked to regain control of East Timor after the Japanese had seized it. Also, he admitted several thousand Jewish refugees during the war. Lisbon, maintaining air connections with Britain and the U.S., became a hotbed of spies of several war parties and served as the base for the International Red Cross in its distribution of relief supplies to POWs.

=== Colonies ===
In 1961, the Portuguese army was involved in armed action in its colony in Goa against an Indian invasion (see Operation Vijay). The operations resulted in a Portuguese defeat and the loss of the colonies in India. Independence movements also became active in Portuguese Angola, Portuguese Mozambique and Portuguese Guinea; the Portuguese Colonial War started. Some 122,000 Africans died in the conflict. Portugal, during this period, was never an outcast, and was a founding member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).

After the death of Salazar in 1970, his replacement by Marcelo Caetano offered a certain hope that the regime would open up, the &quot;primavera marcelista&quot; (Marcelist spring). However the colonial wars in Africa continued, political prisoners remained incarcerated, freedom of association was not restored, censorship was only slightly eased and the elections remained tightly controlled.

The regime retained its characteristic traits: censorship, corporateness, with a market economy dominated by a handful of economical groups, continuous surveillance and intimidation of several sectors of society through the use of a political police and techniques instilling fear (such as arbitrary imprisonment, systematic political persecution and even assassination of anti-regime insurgents).

== The Third Republic (1974–present) ==

The Carnation Revolution of April 25, 1974, an effectively bloodless left-wing military coup, installed the &quot;Third Republic&quot; and implemented broad democratic reforms.

=== Third Portuguese Republic ===
The &quot;Processo Revolucionário Em Curso&quot; (&quot;Ongoing Revolutionary Process&quot;) was the tumultuous period during the Portuguese transition to democracy. It started after a failed right-wing coup d&#x27;état on March 11, 1975, and ended after a failed left-wing coup d&#x27;état on November 25, 1975. This period was marked by political turmoil, violence, and instability, and the nationalization of industries. Portugal was polarized between the conservative north, with its many independent small farmers, and the radical south, where communists helped peasants seize control of large estates. Finally, in the 1976 legislative election, the Socialist Party came in first in elections and its leader Mário Soares formed Portugal&#x27;s first democratically elected government in nearly a half century.

The Social Democratic Party and its center-right allies under Prime Minister Aníbal Cavaco Silva gained control of parliament in 1987 and 1991 while the Socialist Party and its allies succeeded in the 1991 presidential election to retain the presidency for its popular leader Mario Soares.

=== Violent decolonisation ===
In 1975, Portugal granted independence to its Overseas Provinces (&quot;Províncias Ultramarinas&quot; in Portuguese) in Africa (Portuguese Mozambique, Portuguese Angola, Portuguese Guinea, Portuguese Cape Verde and Portuguese São Tomé and Príncipe). Nearly 1 million Portuguese or persons of Portuguese descent left these former colonies as refugees. In 1975 Indonesia invaded and annexed the Portuguese province of Portuguese Timor (Timor Leste) in Asia before independence could be granted. The massive exodus of the Portuguese military and citizens from Angola and Mozambique, would prompt an era of chaos and severe destruction in those territories after independence from Portugal in 1975. From May 1974 to the end of the 1970s, over a million Portuguese citizens from Portugal&#x27;s African territories (mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique) left those territories as destitute refugees – the &quot;retornados&quot;.

The newly independent countries were ravaged by brutal civil wars in the following decadesthe Angolan Civil War (1975–2002) and Mozambican Civil War (1977–1992)responsible for millions of deaths and refugees. The Asian dependency of Macau, after an agreement in 1986, was returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1999. Portugal applied international pressure to secure East Timor&#x27;s independence from Indonesia, as East Timor was still legally a Portuguese dependency, and recognized as such by the United Nations. After a referendum in 1999, East Timor voted for independence, which Portugal recognized in 2002.

With the 1975–1976 independence of its colonies (apart from Macau), the 560-year-old Portuguese Empire effectively ended. Simultaneously, 15 years of war effort also came to an end; many Portuguese returned from the colonies (the &quot;retornados&quot;) and came to comprise a sizeable proportion of the population: approximately 580,000 of Portugal&#x27;s 9.8 million citizens in 1981. This opened new paths for the country&#x27;s future just as others closed. In 1986, Portugal entered the European Economic Community and left the European Free Trade Association which had been founded by Portugal and its partners in 1960. The country joined the euro in 1999. The Portuguese Empire ended &quot;de facto&quot; in 1999 when Macau was returned to China, and &quot;de jure&quot; in 2002 when East Timor became independent.

===Socio-economic evolution===
Economic development was one of the major objectives of the Carnation Revolution and it was widely perceived that the new democracy would have the same unfortunate fate of the previous democratic regimes in Portugal (Constitutional Monarchy and First Republic) if, like them, it failed to provide economic development and decent standards of living to its citizens. Relative to Western Europe, Portugal remained stagnant (and thus poor and underdeveloped) for most of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime (particularly in the first 30 years), but the modernization of the economy and development of the country still started in the last years of the regime, with a period of strong growth from 1961 to 1973. However, the gap between Portugal and most of Western Europe was still abysmal by the mid-1970s. Overall, the Third Republic gave continuity to the growth started in the 1960s and was marked by a major socio-economic development (particularly until the early 2000s). GDP per capita rose from 50% of EC-12 average in 1970 to 70% in 2000, which nonetheless represented an approach to the Western European standards of living without precedents in the previous centuries. Concurrent with the economic development, the Third Republic also witnessed major improvements in health, education, infrastructure, housing and welfare. However, as of 2019, Portugal still has not converged with the most advanced economies of Central and Northern Europe, as the economy has been stagnant since the early 2000s.

The Portuguese economy declined in the centuries following the end of the Age of Discoveries and neither the Constitutional Monarchy (1834–1910) nor the First Republic (1910–1926) were able to put the country in the path to industrialization and development. While António de Oliveira Salazar managed to discipline the Portuguese public finances in the 1930s, the first three decades of the &quot;Estado Novo&quot; regime were also marked by a relative stagnation and underdevelopment. While Western world enjoyed strong economic growth, Portugal remained behind. As such, by 1960 the Portuguese GDP per capita was only 38% of the EC-12 average, and Portugal was one of the most backward countries in Europe. However, things started to change in the late &quot;Estado Novo&quot;: starting in the early 1960s, Portugal entered in a period of robust economic growth and structural modernization, owing to a liberalization of the economy and the rise of a new elite (which was developmental, technocratic and politically liberal). As an expression of such economic opening, in 1960 Portugal was one of the EFTA founding member states. Such remarkable growth period allowed the Portuguese GDP per capita to reach 56% of the EC-12 average by 1973.

In the early 1970s, the government of Marcelo Caetano paved some foundations for a welfare state (which actually was only built after the April 25, 1974, revolution), with reforms in health (Gonçalves Ferreira reform) and education (Veiga Simão reform). However, the new wealth acquired from the 1960–73 growth was unevenly distributed, and the 1960s were also marked by mass emigration. The April 25, 1974, revolution happened when this growth period was fading, owing to the 1973 oil crisis. However, the political turmoil following the April 25, 1974, coup (mainly from March to November 1975) definitively led to the end of such economic growth period. Portugal lost suddenly and chaotically its African possessions and from May 1974 to the end of the 1970s, over a million Portuguese citizens from Portugal&#x27;s African territories (mostly from Portuguese Angola and Mozambique) left those territories and arrived at metropolitan Portugal as destitute refugees – the &quot;retornados&quot;.The first 10 years of the Third Republic, in the context of the transition to democracy, were years of economic troubles, during which Portugal received two IMF-monitored bailouts (from 1977–1979 and from 1983–1985). However, despite an overall crisis from 1973 to 1985, there were some years of very high economic growth, and reforms were enacted that allowed to improve standards of living and level of development, such as the construction of a true Social Security scheme, universal health coverage and the continuation of the process of increasing access to education. In 1985 Portugal left the second IMF bailout and in 1986 the country entered the European Economic Community (and left the EFTA). Strong economic growth resumed. The growth of many of Portugal&#x27;s main exporting companies and the European Union&#x27;s structural and cohesion funds were leading forces in a new period of robust economic growth and socio-economic development which would last (though with a short crisis around 1992–1994) to the early 2000s. In 1991, GDP per capita surpassed the 1973 level (relative to EEC) and by 2000 it had achieved 70% of the EU-12 average, which nonetheless constituted an approach to the Western European standards of living without precedents in the centuries before. However, the economy has been stagnant since the early 2000s (around the accession to Euro) and was hit hard by the effects of the Great Recession: public debt (historically below or in average to that of Europe and Germany) shot up from 68% of GDP in 2007 to 126% in 2012, which was one of the factors that led to a 78-billion-euro IMF/EU-monitored bailout from 2011 to 2014. Economic growth has resumed in the mid-2010s.

Some indicators can be provided to illustrate the major socio-economic development Portugal endured in the Third Republic. Portuguese GDP per capita was at 54% of the average of Northern and Central European countries in 1975 (up from 38% in 1960, owing to the remarkable growth in the 1960s and early 1970s) more or less the same level it was 10 years later (owing to the crisis), from when it rose from 55% in 1985 to a virtually unprecedented 70% in 2000. In 1970, there were 94 physicians by 100,000 inhabitants, while in 1990 there were 281, and in 2011 there were 405. In 1970, infant mortality rate in Portugal was 55.5 per 1,000 live births (in France it was 18.2). Infant mortality rate declined to 10.9 in 1990 and 2.5 in 2010 (by which time, it was one of lowest in the world). In 1970, only 37% of deliveries were held in official health facilities, while by 1985 such number had risen to 96% and by 2000 it was close to 100%. According to a political analyst, &quot;almost all health data transport Portugal from the Third World to the First in two decades&quot;. In 1970, only 3.8% of teenagers were enrolled in high school; such number rose to 28% in 1990, 59% in 2000 and 71% in 2010. The illiteracy rate was 26% in 1970 (by comparison, in Spain it was 9%s) and declined to 11% in 1990 and 5% in 2010. In housing, major improvements happened: in 1970 only 47% of households had piped water supply and 68% had access to electricity. Historical data shows that in 1991, 86% of households had piped water supply and 98% had access to electricity.

By 2021, Portugal had the 4th lowest GDP per capita (PPP) of the eurozone.

<text>Li Peng (; 20 October 1928 – 22 July 2019) was a Chinese politician who served as the 4th premier of China from 1987 to 1998, and as the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, China&#x27;s top legislative body, from 1998 to 2003. For much of the 1990s Li was ranked second in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) hierarchy behind then CCP General Secretary Jiang Zemin. He retained his seat on the CCP Politburo Standing Committee until his retirement in 2002.

Li was the son of an early Communist revolutionary, Li Shuoxun, who was executed by the Kuomintang. After meeting Zhou Enlai in Sichuan, Li was raised by Zhou and his wife, Deng Yingchao. Li trained to be an engineer in the Soviet Union and worked at an important national power company after returning to China. He escaped the political turmoil of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s due to his political connections and his employment in the company. After Deng Xiaoping became China&#x27;s leader in the late 1970s, Li took a number of increasingly important and powerful political positions, eventually becoming premier in 1987.

As Premier, Li was the most visible representative of China&#x27;s government who backed the use of force to quell the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989. During the demonstrations, Li used his authority as premier to declare martial law and, in cooperation with Deng, who was the Chairman of the Central Military Commission, declared military law and the suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen square protestors, ultimately resulting in a massacre.

Li advocated a largely conservative approach to Chinese economic reform, which placed him at odds with CCP General Secretary Zhao Ziyang, who fell out of favour in 1989. After Zhao was removed from office, Li promoted a conservative socialist economic agenda but lost influence to incoming vice premier Zhu Rongji, and was unable to prevent the increasing market liberalization of the Chinese economy. During his time in office, he helmed the controversial Three Gorges Dam project. He and his family managed a large Chinese power monopoly, which the Chinese government broke up after his term as premier expired. Li died at the age of 90 in Beijing.

==Childhood==
Li was born as Li Yuanpeng () at his family house in Shanghai French Concession, now in 545 Yanan Road, Huangpu District in Shanghai. His family has ancestral roots in Chengdu, Sichuan. He was the son of Li Shuoxun, one of the earliest CCP revolutionaries, who was the political commissar of the Twentieth Division during the Nanchang uprising, and Zhao Juntao, also an early Communist operative. In 1931, Li&#x27;s father, then working undercover in Hainan, was captured and executed by the Kuomintang. Li was believed to have met Deng Yingchao, wife of senior Communist leader Zhou Enlai, in Chengdu in 1939, who then took him to Chongqing to meet Zhou, though Zhou was in the Communist base of Yan&#x27;an, and they did not meet until late 1940. In 1941, when Li was twelve, Zhou sent Li to Yan&#x27;an, where Li studied until 1945. As a seventeen-year-old, in 1945, Li joined the Chinese Communist Party.

==Early career==
In 1941, Li Peng began studying at the Yan&#x27;an Institute of Natural Science (a predecessor of the Beijing Institute of Technology). In July 1946, Li was sent to work in Zhangjiakou. According to his own recollection, in 1947, he journeyed through Shandong and North Korea, eventually ending up in Harbin where he began managing some work for a lard processing plant. In 1948, Li Peng was sent to study at the Moscow Power Engineering Institute, majoring in hydroelectric engineering. A year later, in 1949, Zhou Enlai became Premier of the newly declared People&#x27;s Republic of China. Li graduated in 1954. During his time in the Soviet Union, Li was the head of the Chinese Students Association in the Soviet Union.

When Li returned to China in 1955, the country was firmly under the control of the Communist Party. Li took part in technical, then management work in the power industry, beginning his career in Northeast China. At the outset of the Cultural Revolution, Li was sent to Beijing to head up the municipal power bureau. He played a leading role in the construction of the Tuhe Powerplant in Tangshan and the Gaojing Powerplant in Beijing. During his time at Gaojing, he worked three days and three nights supervising the construction of the site. On 4 October 1974, he was struck by a vehicle while riding his bicycle home from work. In 1976, Li was dispatched to affected regions of the Tangshan earthquake as head of the power restoration efforts.

Li advanced politically after the ascent of Deng Xiaoping, and served as the Vice Minister and later Minister of Power, the Communist Party secretary of the North China Electric Power Administration Bureau between 1979 and 1983, as well as the vice minister of Water Conservancy and Power between 1982 and 1983. Much of Li&#x27;s rapid political promotion was due to the support of Party elder Chen Yun.

Li joined the Central Committee at the 12th Party National Congress in 1982. In 1984, he was put in charge of the newly established State Council Leading Small Group on the Electronics Industry. In 1985 he was named minister of the State Education Commission, and was elected to the Politburo and the Party Secretariat. In 1987, after the 13th Party Congress, Li became a member of the powerful Politburo Standing Committee.

==Premiership==

===Defender of state control===

In November 1987, after Premier Zhao Ziyang was promoted to CCP General Secretary, Li became acting Premier. He was formally elected Premier in March 1988. At the time of his promotion, Li seemed like an unusual choice for Premier because he did not seem to share Deng&#x27;s enthusiasm for introducing market reforms. Li was raised to the position of Premier thanks partially to the departure of Hu Yaobang, who was forced to resign as General Secretary after the Party blamed him for a series of student-led protests in 1987.

Throughout the 1980s, political dissent and social problems, including inflation, urban migration, and school overcrowding, became great problems in China. Despite these acute challenges, Li shifted his focus away from the day-to-day concerns of energy, communications, and raw materials allocation, and took a more active role in the ongoing intra-party debate on the pace of market reforms. Politically, Li opposed the modern economic reforms pioneered by Zhao Ziyang throughout Zhao&#x27;s years of public service. In 1988, he downgraded the role of the System Reform Commission, a State Council body created by Zhao Ziyang. While students and intellectuals urged greater reforms, some party elders increasingly feared that the instability opened up by any significant reforms would threaten to undermine the authority of the Communist Party, which Li had spent his career attempting to strengthen.

After Zhao became General Secretary, his proposals in May 1988 to expand free enterprise led to popular complaints (which some suggest were politically inspired) about inflation fears. Public fears about the negative effects of market reforms gave conservatives (including Li Peng) the opening to call for greater centralization of economic controls and stricter prohibitions against Western influences, especially opposing further expansion of Zhao&#x27;s more free enterprise-oriented approach. This precipitated a political debate, which grew more heated through the winter of 1988–1989.

===1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre===

The 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre began with the mass mourning over the death of former General secretary Hu Yaobang, widely perceived to have been purged for his support of political liberalization. On the eve of Hu&#x27;s funeral, 100,000 people gathered at Tiananmen Square. Beijing students began the demonstrations to encourage continued economic reform and liberalization, and these demonstrations soon evolved into a mass movement for political reform. From Tiananmen Square, the protesters later expanded into the surrounding streets. Non-violent protests also occurred in cities throughout China, including Shanghai and Wuhan. Rioting occurred in Xi&#x27;an and Changsha.

The Tiananmen protests were partially protests against the affluence of the children of high-ranking Communist Party officials, and the perception that second-generation officials had received their fortunes through exploiting their parents&#x27; influence. Li, whose family has often been at the center of corruption allegations within the Chinese power industry, was vulnerable to these charges.

An editorial published in the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; on 26 April and bearing the name of Deng Xiaoping, denounced the demonstrations as &quot;premeditated and organized turmoil with anti-Party and anti-socialist motives&quot;. The article had the effect of worsening the demonstrations by angering its leaders, who then made their demands more extreme. Zhao Ziyang later wrote in his autobiography that although Deng had stated many of those sentiments in a private conversation with Li Peng shortly before the editorial was written, Li had the comments disseminated to Party members and published as the editorial without Deng&#x27;s knowledge or consent.

Li strictly refused to negotiate with the Tiananmen protesters out of principle, and became one of the officials most objected to by protesters. One of the protest&#x27;s key leaders, Wu&#x27;erkaixi, during a hunger strike, publicly scolded Li on National Television, saying he was ignoring the needs of the people. Some observers say that Wang&#x27;s statements insulted Li personally, hardening his resolve to end the protest by violent means.

Among the other senior members of the central government, Li became the one who most strongly favored violence and known as the &quot;Butcher of Beijing&quot; for his role in the crackdown. After winning the support of most of his colleagues, apparently including Deng Xiaoping, Li officially declared martial law in Beijing on 20 May 1989 and promised &quot;resolute and decisive measures to put an end to the turmoil&quot;. The protests were crushed by the military on 3–4 June. Most estimates of the dead range from several hundred to several thousand people. Li later described the crackdown as a historic victory for communism, and wrote that he feared the protests would be as potentially damaging to China as the Cultural Revolution had been. The martial law was lifted by Li on 10 January 1990.

===Political longevity===

Although the Tiananmen crackdown was an &quot;international public relations disaster for China,&quot; it ensured that Li would have a long and productive career. He remained powerful even though he had been one of the main targets of protesters, partly because the leadership believed that limiting Li&#x27;s career would be the same as admitting that they had made mistakes by suppressing the 1989 protests. By keeping Li at the upper levels of the Party, China&#x27;s leaders communicated to the world that the country remained stable and united. Because of Li&#x27;s role in the crackdown, he was viewed as politically repellent in most Western capitals and Western delegations traveling to China often had to debate whether they could be seen meeting with Li.

In the immediate aftermath of the Tiananmen protests, Li took a leading role in a national austerity program, intended to slow economic growth and inflation and re-centralize the economy. Li worked to increase taxes on agriculture and export-industries and increased salaries to less efficient industries owned by the government. Li directed a tight monetary policy, implementing price controls on many commodities, supporting higher interest rates, and cutting off state loans to private and cooperative sectors in attempts to reduce inflation. After the fifth plenum of the 13th Central Committee in November 1989, Li established a State Council Production Commission to better coordinate the implementation of the plans.

On 18 April 1990, Li spoke at a celebration for the fifth anniversary of the Shanghai Volkswagen Corporation. During his speech, Li stated that &quot;some policies of the economic and technological zones and Special Economic Zones can be implemented in the Pudong area&quot;. Li stated that future investors from Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan were welcomed and that China would provide preferential conditions for cooperation and improve the investment environment. The occasion is often described as Pudong&#x27;s &quot;birthday&quot;.

In January 1992, at the same time as Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s southern tour, Li attended the annual gathering of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. At the summit, Li told the audience, &quot;We must further accelerate the pace of reform and opening&quot;, and encouraged them to invest in China. 

In 1992, Li attended the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The meeting was the beginning of China&#x27;s shift to a more active role in international environmental policy. At the conference, Li stated that the pursuit of environmental protection should not cause neglect of economic development and that international environmental cooperation should not infringe on national sovereignty.

Li suffered a heart attack in 1993 and began to lose influence within the Party to first-ranking vice premier Zhu Rongji, a strong advocate for economic liberalization. In that year, when Li made his annual work report to the Politburo, he was forced to make over seventy changes to make the plans acceptable to Deng. Perhaps realizing that opposition to the market reforms would be poorly received by Deng and other Party elders, Li publicly supported Deng&#x27;s economic reforms. Li was reappointed Premier in 1993, despite a large protest vote for Zhu. Zhu Rongji eventually succeeded Li after the latter&#x27;s second term expired in 1998.

Li began two megaprojects when he was the Premier. He initiated the construction of the Three Gorges Dam on 14 December 1994, and later began preparations for the Shenzhou Manned Space Program. Both programs were subject to much controversy within China and abroad. The Shenzhou program was especially criticized for its extraordinary cost (tens of billions of dollars). Many economists and humanitarians suggested that those billions in capital might be better invested in helping the Chinese population deal with economic hardships and improvement in China&#x27;s education, health services, and legal system.

==Chairmanship of the National People&#x27;s Congress==
Li remained premier until 1998, when he was constitutionally limited to two terms. After his second term expired, he became the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress. Support for Li for the largely-ceremonial position was low, as he received less than 90% of the vote at the first session of the 9th National People&#x27;s Congress, where he was the only candidate. He spent much of his time monitoring what he considered his life&#x27;s work to have been, the Three Gorges Dam. Li&#x27;s interest in the Dam reflected his earlier career as a hydraulic engineer, and he spent much of his career in office in presiding over a vast and growing power industry. At this time Li Peng considered himself to be a builder and a modernizer.

On 22 August 2000, Li was in New York for a UN meeting. At the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, a licensed private investigator served him with a legal summons in connection with human rights litigation involving the Tiananmen square crackdown. A &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter and photographer accompanied the process server and documented the event. Li was outraged, having viewed the U.S. government as complicit because the summons had been transmitted through his U.S. security detail.

==Legacy and death==
After retiring in 2003, Li retained some influence in the Politburo Standing Committee. Luo Gan, who presided over law enforcement and national security between 2002 and 2007, was considered Li&#x27;s protégé. After the retirement of Luo Gan during 17th Party Congress, Li&#x27;s influence waned considerably. He was subject to frequent speculation over corruption issues that plague him and his family. In addition, perhaps more than any other leader, Li&#x27;s public image had become inextricably associated with memory of the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, and as a result he continued to be a widely despised figure among a substantial segment of the Chinese population well into the 21st century. He was generally unpopular in China, where he (had) &quot;has long been a figure of scorn and suspicion&quot;.

Li spent much of the 1990s expanding and managing an energy monopoly, State Power Corporation of China. Because the company was staffed by Li&#x27;s relatives, Li was accused of turning China&#x27;s energy industry into a &quot;family fiefdom&quot;. At its height, Li&#x27;s power company controlled 72% of all energy-producing assets in China, and was ranked as the sixtieth-largest company in the world by &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine. After Li&#x27;s departure from government, Li&#x27;s energy monopoly was split into five smaller companies by the Chinese government.

In 2010, Li&#x27;s autobiographical work, &quot;The Critical Moment – Li Peng Diaries&quot;, was published by New Century Press. &quot;The Critical Moment&quot; covered Li&#x27;s activities during the period of the Tiananmen Square protests, and was published on the protests&#x27; twenty-first anniversary. &quot;The Critical Moment&quot; was characterized by reviewers as largely an attempt to minimize Li&#x27;s culpability during the most egregious stages of the crackdown; some also say he attempted to shift blame to Deng. He reappeared at the 19th Party Congress on 18 October 2017, marking his last public appearance prior to his death.

Li died on 22 July 2019 at the age of 90. He had been receiving medical treatment in a hospital in Beijing at the time of his death. His funeral was held on 29 July 2019. Attendees of the funeral included CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping, Premier Li Keqiang, and former General Secretary Jiang Zemin.

==Family==
Li Peng was married to Zhu Lin (), a deputy manager in &quot;a large firm in the south of China&quot;. Li and Zhu had 3 children: Li&#x27;s elder son, Li Xiaopeng; Li&#x27;s daughter, Li Xiaolin; and, Li&#x27;s younger son, Li Xiaoyong. Li Xiaoyong is married to Ye Xiaoyan, the daughter of Communist veteran Ye Ting&#x27;s second son, Ye Zhengming.

Li&#x27;s family benefited from Li&#x27;s high position during the 1980s and 1990s. Two of Li&#x27;s children, Li Xiaopeng and Li Xiaolin, inherited and ran two of China&#x27;s electrical monopolies. State-run Chinese media have publicly questioned whether it is in China&#x27;s long-term interest to preserve the &quot;new class of monopoly state capitalists&quot; that Li&#x27;s family represents. Li Xiaopeng entered politics in Shanxi and became its governor in 2012 and then in 2016, he became Minister of Transport. Li Xiaolin served as chief executive of China Power International Development, before being transferred out in 2016 to a minor executive post at a different power company.
