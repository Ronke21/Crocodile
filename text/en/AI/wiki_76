<text>Thomas Telford (9 August 1757 – 2 September 1834) was a Scottish civil engineer. After establishing himself as an engineer of road and canal projects in Shropshire, he designed numerous infrastructure projects in his native Scotland, as well as harbours and tunnels. Such was his reputation as a prolific designer of highways and related bridges, he was dubbed the &#x27;Colossus of Roads&#x27; (a pun on the Colossus of Rhodes), and, reflecting his command of all types of civil engineering in the early 19th century, he was elected as the first president of the Institution of Civil Engineers, a post he held for 14 years until his death.

The town of Telford in Shropshire was named after him.

==Early career==
Telford was born on 9 August 1757, at Glendinning, a hill farm east of Eskdalemuir Kirk, in the rural parish of Westerkirk, in Eskdale, Dumfriesshire. His father John Telford, a shepherd, died soon after Thomas was born. Thomas was raised in poverty by his mother Janet Jackson (died 1794).
At the age of 14, he was apprenticed to a stonemason, and some of his earliest work can still be seen on the bridge across the River Esk in Langholm in Dumfries and Galloway. He worked for a time in Edinburgh and in 1782 he moved to London where, after meeting architects Robert Adam and Sir William Chambers, he was involved in building additions to Somerset House there. Two years later he found work at Portsmouth dockyard and – although still largely self-taught – was extending his talents to the specification, design and management of building projects.

In 1787, through his wealthy patron William Pulteney, he became Surveyor of Public Works in Shropshire. His projects included renovation of Shrewsbury Castle, the town&#x27;s prison (during the planning of which he met leading prison reformer John Howard), the Church of St Mary Magdalene, Bridgnorth and another church, St Michael&#x27;s, in Madeley. Called in to advise on a leaking roof at St Chad&#x27;s Church, Shrewsbury in 1788, he warned the church was in imminent danger of collapse; his reputation was made locally when it collapsed three days later, but he was not the architect for its replacement.

As the Shropshire county surveyor, Telford was also responsible for bridges. In 1790 he designed Montford Bridge carrying the London–Holyhead road over the River Severn at Montford, the first of some 40 bridges he built in Shropshire, including major crossings of the Severn at Buildwas, and Bridgnorth. The bridge at Buildwas was Telford&#x27;s first iron bridge. He was influenced by Abraham Darby&#x27;s bridge at Ironbridge, and observed that it was grossly over-designed for its function, and many of the component parts were poorly cast. By contrast, his bridge was wider in span and half the weight, although it now no longer exists. He was one of the first engineers to test his materials thoroughly before construction. As his engineering prowess grew, Telford was to return to this material repeatedly.

In 1795, the bridge at Bewdley in Worcestershire was swept away in the winter floods and Telford was responsible for the design of its replacement. The same winter floods saw the bridge at Tenbury also swept away. This bridge across the River Teme was the joint responsibility of both Worcestershire and Shropshire and the bridge has a bend where the two counties meet. Telford was responsible for the repair to the northern (Shropshire) end of the bridge.

==Ellesmere Canal==
Telford&#x27;s reputation in Shropshire led to his appointment in 1793 to manage the detailed design and construction of the Ellesmere Canal, linking the ironworks and collieries of Wrexham via the north-west Shropshire town of Ellesmere, with Chester, utilising the existing Chester Canal, and then the River Mersey.

Among other structures, this involved the spectacular Pontcysyllte Aqueduct over the River Dee in the Vale of Llangollen, where Telford used a new method of construction consisting of troughs made from cast iron plates and fixed in masonry. Extending for over with an altitude of above the valley floor, the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct consists of nineteen arches, each with a span. Being a pioneer in the use of cast-iron for large scaled structures, Telford had to invent new techniques, such as using boiling sugar and lead as a sealant on the iron connections. Canal engineer William Jessop oversaw the project but left the detailed execution of the project in Telford&#x27;s hands. The aqueduct was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2009.

The same period also saw Telford involved in the design and construction of the Shrewsbury Canal. When the original engineer, Josiah Clowes, died in 1795, Telford succeeded him. One of Telford&#x27;s achievements on this project was the design of Longdon-on-Tern Aqueduct, the cast-iron aqueduct at Longdon-on-Tern, pre-dating that at Pontcysyllte, and substantially bigger than the UK&#x27;s first cast-iron aqueduct, built by Benjamin Outram on the Derby Canal just months earlier. The aqueduct is no longer in use, but is preserved as a distinctive piece of canal engineering.

The Ellesmere Canal was left uncompleted in 1805 because it failed to generate the revenues needed to finance the connecting sections to Chester and Shrewbury. However, alongside his canal responsibilities, Telford&#x27;s reputation as a civil engineer meant he was constantly consulted on numerous other projects. These included water supply works for Liverpool, improvements to London&#x27;s docklands and the rebuilding of London Bridge (c. 1800).

Most notably (and again William Pulteney was influential), in 1801 Telford devised a master plan to improve communications in the Highlands of Scotland, a massive project that was to last some 20 years. It included the building of the Caledonian Canal along the Great Glen and redesign of sections of the Crinan Canal, some of new roads, over a thousand new bridges (including the Craigellachie Bridge), numerous harbour improvements (including works at Aberdeen, Dundee, Peterhead, Wick, Portmahomack and Banff), and 32 new churches.

Telford also undertook highway works in the Scottish Lowlands, including of new roads and numerous bridges, ranging from a 112 ft (34 m) span stone bridge across the Dee at Tongueland in Kirkcudbright (1805–06) to the 129 ft (39 m) tall Cartland Crags bridge near Lanark (1822).

In 1809, Telford was tasked with improving the Howth Road in Dublin, to connect the new harbour at Howth to the city of Dublin as part of wider plan to improve communication between Dublin and London. The milestones that are a feature of this route from Howth to the GPO on O&#x27;Connell Street still mark the route. He also drafted the first design of the Ulster Canal. Irish engineer, William Dargan, was trained by Telford.

Telford was consulted in 1806 by the King of Sweden about the construction of a canal between Gothenburg and Stockholm. His plans were adopted and construction of the Göta Canal began in 1810. Telford travelled to Sweden at that time to oversee some of the more important initial excavations.

Many of Telford&#x27;s projects were undertaken due to his role as a member of the Exchequer Bill Loan Commission, an organ set up under the Public Works Loans Act 1817 (57 Geo. 3. c. 34), to help finance public work projects that would generate employment.

==The &#x27;Colossus of Roads&#x27;==
During his later years, Telford was responsible for rebuilding sections of the London to Holyhead road, a task completed by his assistant of ten years, John MacNeill; today, much of the route is the A5 trunk road, although the Holyhead Road diverted off the A5 along what is now parts of A45, A41 and A464 through the cities of Coventry, Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Between London and Shrewsbury, most of the work amounted to improvements. Beyond Shrewsbury, and especially beyond Llangollen, the work often involved building a highway from scratch. Notable features of this section of the route include the
Waterloo Bridge across the River Conwy at Betws-y-Coed, the ascent from there to Capel Curig and then the descent from the pass of Nant Ffrancon towards Bangor. Between Capel Curig and Bethesda, in the Ogwen Valley, Telford deviated from the original road, built by Romans during their occupation of this area.

On the island of Anglesey a new embankment across the Stanley Sands to Holyhead was constructed, but the crossing of the Menai Strait was the most formidable challenge, overcome by the Menai Suspension Bridge (1819–26). Spanning , this was the longest suspension bridge of the time. Unlike modern suspension bridges, Telford used individually linked iron eye bars for the cables.
Telford also worked on the North Wales coast road between Chester and Bangor, including another major suspension bridge at Conwy, opened later the same year as its Menai counterpart.

Further afield Telford designed a road to cross the centre of the Isle of Arran. Named the &#x27;String road&#x27;, this route traverses bleak and difficult terrain to allow traffic to cross between east and west Arran avoiding the circuitous coastal route. His work on improving the Glasgow – Carlisle road, later to become the A74, has been described as &quot;a model for future engineers.&quot;

Telford improved on methods for the building of macadam roads by improving the selection of stone based on thickness, taking into account traffic, alignment and slopes.

The punning nickname &#x27;Colossus of Roads&#x27; was given to Telford by his friend, the eventual Poet Laureate, Robert Southey.

In 1821, he was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

==The &#x27;Telford Church&#x27;==
An Act of Parliament in 1823 provided a grant of £50,000 for the building of up to 40 churches and manses in communities without any church buildings (hence the alternative name: &#x27;Parliamentary Church&#x27; or &#x27;Parliamentary Kirk&#x27;). The total cost was not to exceed £1500 on any site and Telford was commissioned to undertake the design. He developed a simple church of T-shaped plan and two manse designs – a single-storey and a two-storey, adaptable to site and ground conditions, and to brick or stone construction, at £750 each. Of the 43 churches originally planned, 32 were eventually built around the Scottish highlands and islands (the other 11 were achieved by redoing existing buildings). The last of these churches was built in 1830. Some have been restored and/or converted to private use.

==Late career==
Other works by Telford include the St Katharine Docks (1824–28) close to Tower Bridge in central London, where he worked with the architect Philip Hardwick, the Gloucester and Berkeley Ship Canal (today known as the Gloucester and Sharpness Canal), Over Bridge near Gloucester, the second Harecastle Tunnel on the Trent and Mersey Canal (1827), and the Birmingham and Liverpool Junction Canal (today part of the Shropshire Union Canal) – started in May 1826 but finished, after Telford&#x27;s death, in January 1835. At the time of its construction in 1829, Galton Bridge was the longest single span in the world. Telford surveyed and planned the Macclesfield Canal, which was completed by William Crosley (or Crossley). He also built Whitstable harbour in Kent in 1832, in connection with the Canterbury and Whitstable Railway with an unusual system for flushing out mud using a tidal reservoir. He also completed the &quot;Grand Trunk&quot; after James Brindley died due to being over-worked.

In 1820, Telford was appointed the first President of the recently formed Institution of Civil Engineers, a post he held until his death.

==Freemasonry==
He was Initiated into Freemasonry in Antiquity Lodge, No. 26, (Portsmouth, England) in 1770. This lodge no longer exists. He was a founder member of Phoenix Lodge, No. 257 (also in Portsmouth). Telford designed a room within the George Inn for the lodge. In 1786 he became an affiliate member of Salopian Lodge, No. 262 (Shrewsbury, England).

==Telford&#x27;s death==
Telford&#x27;s young draughtsman and clerk 1830–34 George Turnbull in his diary states:

&quot;On the 23rd&quot; [August 1834] &quot;Mr Telford was taken seriously ill of a bilious derangement to which he had been liable ... he grew worse and worse&quot; … [surgeons] &quot;attended him twice a day, but it was to no avail for he died on the 2nd September, very peacefully at about 5pm. … His old servant James Handscombe and I were the only two in the house&quot; [24 Abingdon Street, London] &quot;when he died. He was never married. Mr Milne and Mr Rickman were, no doubt, Telford&#x27;s most intimate friends. ... I went to Mr Milne and under his direction … made all the arrangements about the house and correspondence. ... Telford had no blood relations that we knew of. The funeral took place on the 10th September [in Westminster Abbey]. ... Mr Telford was of the most genial disposition and a delightful companion, his laugh was the heartiest I ever heard; it was a pleasure to be in his society.&quot;

Thomas Telford was buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey; a statue was erected to him nearby, in St Andrew&#x27;s Chapel adjoining the north transept.

Throughout his life Telford had a great affection for his birthplace of Eskdale and its people and in his will left legacies to the two local libraries at Westerkirk and Langholm.

==Honours==
In 2011 he was one of seven inaugural inductees to the Scottish Engineering Hall of Fame.

==Telford the poet==
Telford&#x27;s reputation as a man of letters may have preceded his fame as an engineer: he had published poetry between 1779 and 1784, and an account of a tour of Scotland with Robert Southey. His will left bequests to Southey (who would later write Telford&#x27;s biography), the poet Thomas Campbell (1777–1844) and to the publishers of the &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot; (to which he had been a contributor).

George Turnbull states that Telford wrote and gave him a poem:

(Turnbull includes notes that explain nine references to Burns&#x27;s life in the poem.)

Turnbull also states:

His ability and perseverance may be understood from various literary compositions of after life, such as the articles he contributed to the &quot;Edinburgh Encyclopædia&quot;, such as Architecture, Bridge-building, and Canal-making. Singular to say the earliest distinction he acquired in life was as a poet. Even at 30 years of age he reprinted at Shrewsbury a poem called &quot;Eskdale&quot;, … Some others of his poems are in my possession.

Another example, later in Telford&#x27;s life, was &quot;To Sir John Malcolm on Receiving His Miscellaneous Poems&quot; (1831).

<doc id="43243" wikidata="Q3542872" url="?curid=43243" title="Religion and sexuality">
<text>The views of the various different religions and religious believers regarding human sexuality range widely among and within them, from giving sex and sexuality a rather negative connotation to believing that sex is the highest expression of the divine. Some religions distinguish between human sexual activities that are practised for biological reproduction (sometimes allowed only when in formal marital status and at a certain age) and those practised only for sexual pleasure in evaluating relative morality.

Sexual morality has varied greatly over time and between cultures. A society&#x27;s sexual norms—standards of sexual conduct—can be linked to religious beliefs, or social and environmental conditions, or all of these. Sexuality and reproduction are fundamental elements in human interaction and societies worldwide. Furthermore, &quot;sexual restriction&quot; is one of the universals of culture peculiar to all human societies.

Accordingly, most religions have seen a need to address the question of a &quot;proper&quot; role for sexuality. Religions have differing codes of sexual morality, which regulate sexual activity or assign normative values to certain sexually charged actions or ideas. Each major religion has developed a moral code covering issues of human sexuality, morality, ethics, etc. These moral codes seek to regulate the situations that can give rise to sexual interest and to influence people&#x27;s sexual activities and practices.

==Abrahamic religions==
Abrahamic religions (namely Judaism, Samaritanism, Christianity, the Baháʼí Faith, and Islam) have traditionally affirmed and endorsed a patriarchal and heteronormative approach towards human sexuality.

Catholicism in particular favours exclusively penetrative vaginal intercourse between men and women within the boundaries of marriage over all other forms of human sexual activity, including autoeroticism, masturbation, anal sex, oral sex, non-penetrative and non-heterosexual sexual intercourse (all of which have been labeled as &quot;sodomy&quot; at various times), believing and teaching that such behaviors are forbidden and considered sinful, and further compared to or derived from the alleged behavior of the residents of Sodom and Gomorrah. However, the status of LGBT people in early Christianity and early Islam is debated.

===Baháʼí Faith===
In the Baháʼí Faith, sexual relationships are permitted only between a husband and wife, and marriage is emphasized in the faith. Bahá&#x27;u&#x27;lláh, the founder of the Baháʼí Faith, forbade any sexual intercourse outside a heterosexual marriage in his book of laws; the Kitáb-i-Aqdas. Homosexual sexual relationships and same-sex marriages continue to be prohibited.

===Christianity===
The Old Testament and Christianity have historically affirmed and endorsed a patriarchal and heteronormative approach towards human sexuality, favouring exclusively penetrative vaginal intercourse between men and women within the boundaries of marriage over all other forms of human sexual activity, including autoeroticism, masturbation, anal sex, oral sex, non-penetrative and non-heterosexual sexual intercourse (all of which have been labeled as &quot;sodomy&quot; at various times), believing and teaching that such behaviors are forbidden because they&#x27;re considered sinful, and further compared to or derived from the behavior of the alleged residents of Sodom and Gomorrah.

In the New Testament, Jesus discussed little about sex, and most of the information about sex comes from the Old Testament and Paul&#x27;s writings, and some are controversial today.

Sexuality carried out between different sexes, between 2 people (Monogamy, although polygamy is not forbidden) and in particular procreation, is generally understood as the ideal state.

There is conjugal love through &quot;Song of Songs&quot; in which it is about eroticism and romance.

====New Testament====
Paul the Apostle stated in 1 Corinthians &quot;To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain unmarried as I am. But if they are not practising self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.&quot; Importantly, Paul&#x27;s view of sex is also that it is actually unnecessary for those with certain gifts (presumably &quot;celibacy&quot;). Jennifer Wright Knust says Paul framed desire a force Christians gained control over whereas non-Christians were &quot;enslaved&quot; by it. Further, Paul says the bodies of Christians were members of Christ&#x27;s body and thus sexual desire must be eschewed.

New Testament scholar N. T. Wright asserts that Paul absolutely forbade fornication, irrespective of a new Christian&#x27;s former cultural practices. Wright notes &quot;If a Corinthian were to say, &#x27;Because I&#x27;m a Corinthian, I have always had a string of girl-friends I sleep with, that&#x27;s part of our culture,&#x27; Paul would respond, &#x27;Not now you&#x27;re a Christian you don&#x27;t.&#x27;... When someone disagreed with Paul&#x27;s clear rules on immorality or angry disputes, the matters he deals with in Colossians 3.5–10, he is... firm, as we see dramatically in 1 Corinthians 5 and 6. There is no place in the Christian fellowship for such practices and for such a person.&quot;

Some have suggested that Paul&#x27;s treatment of sex was influenced by his conviction that the end of the world was imminent. Under this view, Paul, believing that the world would soon end, took it as a corollary that all earthly concerns, including sex, should hold little interest for Christians. Paul&#x27;s letters show far greater concern with sexual issues than the gospel writers attributed to Jesus, since Paul was building Christian communities over decades and responding to various issues that arose.

The theologian Lee Gatiss states that &quot;the word &#x27;fornication&#x27; has gone out of fashion and is not in common use to describe non-marital sex. However, it is an excellent translation for [the Biblical term] , which basically referred to any kind of sex outside of marriage... This has been contested... but the overwhelming weight of scholarship and all the available evidence from the ancient world points firmly in this direction. &#x27;Flee sexual immorality () and pursue self-control&#x27; (cf. 1 Thess 4:1–8) was the straightforward message to Christians in a sex-crazed world.&quot;

====Early Christianity====
In early Christianity, reflection on scriptural texts introduced an eschatological hermeneutic to the reading of the Book of Genesis. The Garden of Eden was seen as a normative ideal state to which Christians were to strive; writers linked the future enjoyment of Heaven to the original blessedness of Adam and Eve in their reflections.

The valuation of virginity in the ancient church brought into relief a tension between the Genesis injunction to &quot;be fruitful and multiply&quot; with its understood contextual implication of marriage as a social institution, and the interpretation of the superiority of virginity over marriage, sexual activity and family formation from the Gospel texts Matt 19:11-12, Matt 19:29. One way patristic thinkers tried to harmonize the texts was through the position that there had actually been no sexual intercourse in Eden: on this reading, sex happened after the fall of man and the expulsion from Eden, thus preserving virginity as the perfect state both in the historical Paradise and the anticipated Heaven. John Chrysostom, Gregory of Nyssa, Justin Martyr, Epiphanius of Salamis, and Irenaeus of Lyons all espoused this view:
* Gregory of Nyssa, &quot;On Virginity&quot;, 12 &quot;He did not yet judge of what was lovely by taste or sight; he found in the Lord alone all that was sweet; and he used the helpmeet given him only for this delight, as Scripture signifies when it said that &#x27;he knew her not&#x27; till he was driven forth from the garden, and till she, for the sin which she was decoyed into committing, was sentenced to the pangs of childbirth. We, then, who in our first ancestor were thus ejected, are allowed to return to our earliest state of blessedness by the very same stages by which we lost Paradise. What are they? Pleasure, craftily offered, began the Fall, and there followed after pleasure shame, and fear, even to remain longer in the sight of their Creator, so that they hid themselves in leaves and shade; and after that they covered themselves with the skins of dead animals; and then were sent forth into this pestilential and exacting land where, as the compensation for having to die, marriage was instituted&quot;.
* John Chrysostom, &quot;On Virginity&quot;, 14.3 &quot;When the whole world had been completed and all had been readied for our repose and use, God fashioned man for whom he made the world... Man did need a helper, and she came into being; not even then did marriage seem necessary... Desire for sexual intercourse, conception, labor, childbirth, and every form of corruption had been banished from their souls. As a clear river shooting forth from a pure source, so they were in that place adorned by virginity.&quot; 15.2 &quot;Why did marriage not appear before the treachery? Why was there no intercourse in paradise? Why not the pains of childbirth before the curse? Because at that time these things were superfluous.&quot;
* Irenaeus, &quot;Against Heresies&quot;, Book 3, ch 22:4 &quot;But Eve was disobedient; for she did not obey when as yet she was a virgin. And even as she, having indeed a husband, Adam, but being nevertheless as yet a virgin (for in Paradise they were both naked, and were not ashamed, inasmuch as they, having been created a short time previously, had no understanding of the procreation of children: for it was necessary that they should first come to adult age, and then multiply from that time onward), having become disobedient, was made the cause of death, both to herself and to the entire human race...&quot;
* Epiphanius of Salamis, &quot;Panarion&quot;, 78.17–19 &quot;And as in paradise Eve, still a virgin, fell into the sin of disobedience, once more through the Virgin [Mary] came the obedience of grace.&quot;
* Justin Martyr, &quot;Dialogue with Trypho&quot;, ch 100 &quot;For Eve, who was a virgin and undefiled, having conceived the word of the serpent, brought forth disobedience and death. But the Virgin Mary received faith and joy, when the angel Gabriel announced the good tidings to her...&quot;

Prof. John Noonan suggests that &quot;if one asks... where the Christian Fathers derived their notions on marital intercourse – notions which have no express biblical basis – the answer must be, chiefly from the Stoics&quot;. He uses texts from Musonius Rufus, Seneca the Younger, and Ocellus Lucanus, tracing works of Clement of Alexandria, Origen and Jerome to the works of these earlier thinkers, particularly as pertaining to the permissible use of the sexual act, which in the Stoic model must be subdued, dispassionate, and justified by its procreative intent.

Augustine of Hippo had a different challenge: to respond to the errors of Manichaeism. The Manichees, according to Augustine, were &quot;opposed to marriage, because they are opposed to procreation which is the purpose of marriage&quot;. &quot;The method of contraception practised by these Manichees whom Augustine knew is the use of the sterile period as determined by Greek medicine&quot;, which Augustine condemns (this stands in contrast to the contemporarily permitted Catholic use of Natural family planning). Elaine Pagels says, &quot;By the beginning of the fifth century, Augustine had actually declared that spontaneous sexual desire is the proof of—and penalty for—universal original sin&quot;, though that this view goes against &quot;most of his Christian predecessors&quot;.

As monastic communities developed, the sexual lives of monks came under scrutiny from two theologians, John Cassian and Caesarius of Arles, who commented on the &quot;vices&quot; of the solitary life. &quot;Their concerns were not with the act of masturbation, but with the monks who vowed chastity. The monks&#x27; vow made masturbation an illicit act; the act itself was not considered sinful... In fact... prior to Cassian, masturbation was not considered a sexual offence for anyone.&quot;

====Catholicism====
From the beginning of the thirteenth century, the Catholic Church formally recognized marriage between a freely consenting, baptized man and woman as a sacrament – an outward sign communicating a special gift of God&#x27;s love. The Council of Florence in 1438 gave this definition, following earlier church statements in 1208, and declared that sexual union was a special participation in the union of Christ in the church. However the Puritans, while highly valuing the institution, viewed marriage as a &quot;civil&quot;, rather than a &quot;religious&quot; matter, being &quot;under the jurisdiction of the civil courts&quot;. This is because they found no biblical precedent for clergy performing marriage ceremonies. Further, marriage was said to be for the &quot;relief of concupiscence&quot; as well as any spiritual purpose.

The Catholic moral theologian Charles E. Curran stated &quot;the fathers of the Church are practically silent on the simple question of masturbation&quot;.

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; teaches that &quot;the flesh is the hinge of salvation&quot;. The &quot;Catechism&quot; indicates that sexual relationships in marriage is &quot;a way of imitating in the flesh the Creator&#x27;s generosity and fecundity&quot; and lists fornication as one of the &quot;offenses against chastity&quot;, calling it &quot;an intrinsically and gravely disordered action&quot; because &quot;use of the sexual faculty, for whatever reason, outside of marriage is essentially contrary to its purpose&quot;. The &quot;conjugal act&quot; aims &quot;at a deeply personal unity, a unity that, beyond union in one flesh, leads to forming one heart and soul&quot; since the marriage bond is to be a sign of the love between God and humanity.

Pope John Paul II&#x27;s first major teaching was on the theology of the body, presented in a series of lectures by the same name. Over the course of five years he elucidated a vision of sex that was not only positive and affirming but was about redemption, not condemnation. He taught that by understanding God&#x27;s plan for physical love we could understand &quot;the meaning of the whole of existence, the meaning of life.&quot; He taught that human beings were created by a loving God for a purpose: to be loving persons who freely choose to love, to give themselves as persons who express their self-giving through their bodies. Thus, sexual intercourse between husband and wife is a symbol of their total mutual self-donation.

For John Paul II, &quot;The body, and it alone, is capable of making visible what is invisible: the spiritual and divine.&quot; He says there is no other more perfect image of the unity and communion of God in mutual love than the sexual act of a married couple, whereby they give themselves in a total way – exclusively to one another, and up to the end of their lives, and in a fruitfully generous way by participating in the creation of new human beings. Through this perspective, he understands the immorality of extra-marital sex. It falsifies the language of the human body, a language of total love worthy of persons by using the body for selfish ends, thus treating persons as things and objects, rather than dealing with embodied persons with the reverence and love that incarnate spirits deserve. John Paul II stresses that there is great beauty in sexual love when done in harmony with the human values of freely chosen total commitment and self-giving. For him, this sexual love is a form of worship, an experience of the sacred.

Roman Catholics believe that masturbation is a sin.

In September 2015, the Vatican&#x27;s Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, responsible for enforcing Catholic doctrine, did not permit a transgender man in Spain to serve as a godfather effectively barring transgender Catholics from serving as a baptismal sponsors. The statement concluded: &quot;[...] the result is evident that this person does not possess the requisite of leading a life conformed to the faith and to the position of godfather (CIC, can 874 §1,3), therefore is not able to be admitted to the position of godmother nor godfather. One should not see this as discrimination, but only the recognition of an objective absence of the requisites that by their nature are necessary to assume the ecclesial responsibility of being a godparent.&quot;

====Protestantism====
Views over sexuality in Protestant churches differ.

Conservative Protestants assert that any and all sex outside of marriage, including that conducted between committed, engaged or cohabiting couples, is the sin of fornication.

Unlike Roman Catholics, certain Protestants do not disapprove of masturbation due to the lack of a Biblical injunction against the act, including mainline and conservative denominations. Among those Protestants who do not view masturbation as being sinful, there are various restrictions, such as making sure it does not lead to use of pornography or looking lustfully at people or mutual masturbation or addiction to the act. It must also not be undertaken in a spirit of defiance against God.

===== Lutheran and Reformed churches =====
The Confessional Lutheran tradition, which includes several denominations worldwide (such as the Lutheran Church – Missouri Synod) takes a traditional stance towards human sexuality, teaching that &quot;God created male and female, sexual human beings&quot;. Confessional Lutherans hold that &quot;Upon creating man and women and the rest of creation, God observed that &#x27;it (was) good,&#x27; including the gift of sex.&quot; The Confessional Lutheran denominations view &quot;pornography, homosexuality and cohabitation&quot; as sinful.

All 20 Lutheran and Reformed churches of the Evangelical Church in Germany welcome LGBT members, as well as the Protestant Church in the Netherlands. In these Lutheran and Reformed churches gay ministers are permitted in ministry and gay married couples are allowed in their churches.

Inside the Lutheran Church of Sweden, the Bishop of Stockholm, Eva Brunne is a lesbian in a registered partnership with Gunilla Lindén, who is also an ordained priest of the Church of Sweden.

===== Anglicanism =====
The Anglican Church upholds human sexuality as a gift from a loving God, designed to be between a man and a woman in a monogamous, lifetime union of marriage. It also recognises singleness and dedicated celibacy as Christ-like. It reassures people with same-sex attraction they are loved by God, and are welcomed as full members of the Body of Christ. The church leadership has a variety of views in regard to homosexual expression and ordination. Some expressions of sexuality are considered sinful, including &quot;promiscuity, prostitution, incest, pornography, paedophilia, predatory sexual behaviour, and sadomasochism (all of which may be heterosexual and homosexual), adultery, violence against wives, and female circumcision.&quot; The church is concerned with pressures on young people to engage sexually and encourages abstinence.

In the Anglican Church, there is a large discussion over the blessing of gay couples, and over tolerance of homosexuality. The discussion is more about the aspect of love between two people of the same-sex in a relationship than it is about the sexual aspect of a relationship.

===== Methodism =====
The Free Methodist Church teaches:

The Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection teaches: &quot;We believe that God has commanded that no intimate sexual activity be engaged in outside of marriage between a man and a woman.&quot; It additionally holds that those who remarry after divorce are living in a state of adultery.

The United Methodist Church permits its clergy to officiate same-sex weddings.

=====Metropolitan Community Church=====
The Metropolitan Community Church, also known as the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches, has a specific outreach to lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender families and communities.

====Latter Day Saints movement====
Within the many branches of the Latter Day Saints movement, the principal denomination, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), teaches conservative views around sexual ethics in their Law of Chastity, which holds that masturbation, pre- and extra-marital sex, and same-sex sexual activity are sins. In the mid-1800s, however, it was allowed for men to be married to and have children with several women, and this was also discontinued in the late 1800s.
On various occasions, LDS Church leaders have taught that members should not masturbate as part of obedience to the LDS law of chastity. The LDS Church believes that sex outside of opposite-sex marriage is sinful, and that any same-sex sexual activity is a serious sin. God is believed to be in a heterosexual marriage with the Heavenly Mother, and Mormons believe that opposite-sex marriage is what God wants for all his children. Top LDS Church leaders formerly taught that attractions to those of the same sex were a sin or disease that could be changed or fixed, but now have no stance on the etiology of homosexuality, and teach that therapy focused on changing sexual orientation is unethical. Lesbian, gay, and bisexual members are, thus, left with the option of attempting to change their sexual orientation, entering a mixed-orientation opposite-sex marriage, or living a celibate lifestyle without any sexual expression (including masturbation).

The LDS Church teaches that women&#x27;s principal role is to raise children. Women who rejected this role as being a domestic woman in the home, were seen as unstable and corrupted. Before 1890, the Mormon leaders taught that polygamy was a way to salvation, and many had multiple wives into the early 1900s, and some women practiced polyandry.

The Mormon religion teaches that marriage should be with a man and a woman. The LDS Church teaches its members to obey the law of chastity, which says that &quot;sexual relations are proper only between a man and a woman who are legally and lawfully wedded as husband and wife.&quot; Violations of this code include: &quot;adultery, being without natural affection, lustfulness, infidelity, incontinence, filthy communications, impurity, inordinate affection, fornication.&quot; The traditional Mormon religion forbids all homosexual behavior, whether it be intra-marriage or extramarital. In Romans 1:24-32, Paul preached to the Romans that homosexual behavior was sinful. In Leviticus 20:13, Moses included in his law that homosexual actions and behaviors were against God&#x27;s will. In the 1830s, LDS founder, Joseph Smith, instituted the private practice on polygamy. The practice was defended by the church as a matter of religious freedom. In 1890, the church practice was terminated. Since the termination of polygamy, Mormons have solely believed in marriage between two people, and those two people being a man and a woman. The LDS community states that they still love homosexuals as sons and daughters of the Lord, but if they act upon their inclinations, then they are subject to discipline of the church.

====Unitarian Universalism====
Several Unitarian Universalist congregations have undertaken a series of organizational, procedural, and practical steps to become acknowledged as a &quot;Welcoming Congregation&quot;: a congregation which has taken specific steps to welcome and integrate gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) members. UU ministers perform same-sex unions and now same-sex marriages where legal (and sometimes when not, as a form of civil protest). On June 29, 1984, the Unitarian Universalists became the first major church &quot;to approve religious blessings on homosexual unions.&quot;

Unitarian Universalists have been in the forefront of the work to make same-sex marriages legal in their local states and provinces, as well as on the national level. Gay men, bisexuals, and lesbians are also regularly ordained as ministers, and a number of gay, bisexual, and lesbian ministers have, themselves, now become legally married to their partners. In May 2004, Arlington Street Church was the site of the first state-sanctioned same-sex marriage in the United States. The official stance of the UUA is for the legalization of same-sex marriage—&quot;Standing on the Side of Love.&quot; In 2004 UU Minister Rev. Debra Haffner of The Religious Institute on Sexual Morality, Justice, and Healing published &quot;An Open Letter on Religious Leaders on Marriage Equality&quot; to affirm same-sex marriage from a multi-faith perspective. In December 2009, Washington, DC Mayor Adrian Fenty signed the bill to legalize same-sex marriage for the District of Columbia in All Souls Church, Unitarian (Washington, D.C.).

Unitarian Universalists for Polyamory Awareness is a group within Unitarian Universalism whose vision is &quot;for Unitarian Universalism to become the first poly-welcoming mainstream religious denomination.&quot;

===Islam===


Interfaith marriages are recognized between Muslims and Non-Muslim &quot;People of the Book&quot; (usually enumerated as Jews, Christians, and Sabians). According to the traditional interpretation of Islamic law (&quot;sharīʿa&quot;), a Muslim man is allowed to marry a Christian or Jewish woman, but this ruling does not apply to women who belong to other Non-Muslim religious groups, whereas a Muslim woman is not allowed to marry a Non-Muslim man of any Non-Muslim religious group. In general, the Quran tells Muslim men not to marry Non-Muslim women, and it tells Muslim women not to marry non-Muslim men, but it makes an allowance for Muslim men to marry women of the People of the Book under certain conditions, such as a low amount of Muslim women in their vicinity. Additionally, the non-Muslim wife must be devout in her religion and not be unchaste. Some Muslim scholars discourage all interfaith marriages, citing cultural differences between Muslims and Non-Muslims.

In some societies outside the traditional &quot;dar al-islam&quot;, interfaith marriages between Muslims and Non-Muslims are not uncommon, including marriages that contradict the historic Sunni understanding of &quot;ijmāʿ&quot; (the consensus of &quot;fuqāha&quot;) as to the bounds of legitimacy. The tradition of reformist and progressive Islam, however, permits marriage between Muslim women and Non-Muslim men; Islamic scholars opining this view include Khaleel Mohammed, Hassan Al-Turabi, among others. Despite Sunni Islam prohibiting it, interfaith marriages between Muslim women and Non-Muslim men take place at substantial rates. In the United States, about 10% of Muslim women are today married to Non-Muslim men.
Attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people and their experiences in the Muslim world have been influenced by its religious, legal, social, political, and cultural history. The religious stigma and sexual taboo associated with homosexuality in Islamic societies can have profound effects for those Muslims who self-identify as LGBTQ+. Today, most LGBTQ-affirming Islamic organizations and individual congregations are primarily based in the Western world and South Asian countries; they usually identify themselves with the liberal and progressive movements within Islam.

Homosexual acts are forbidden in traditional Islamic jurisprudence and are liable to different punishments, including flogging, stoning, and the death penalty, depending on the situation and legal school. However, homosexual relationships were generally tolerated in pre-modern Islamic societies, and historical records suggest that these laws were invoked infrequently, mainly in cases of rape or other &quot;exceptionally blatant infringement on public morals&quot;. Public attitudes toward homosexuality in the Muslim world underwent a marked negative change starting from the 19th century through the global spread of Islamic fundamentalist movements such as Salafism and Wahhabism, and the influence of the sexual notions and restrictive norms prevalent in Europe at the time: a number of Muslim-majority countries have retained criminal penalties for homosexual acts enacted under European colonial rule. In recent times, extreme prejudice, discrimination, and violence against LGBT people persists, both socially and legally, in much of the Muslim world, exacerbated by increasingly socially conservative attitudes and the rise of Islamist movements in Muslim-majority countries.

===Judaism===


In the perspective of traditional Judaism, sex and reproduction are the holiest of acts one can do, the act through which one can imitate God, and in order to preserve its sanctity there are many boundaries and guidelines. Within the boundaries, there are virtually no outright strictures, and it is in fact obligatory. It prohibits sexual relations outside of heterosexual marriage, maintains biblical strictures on relations within marriage including observance of &quot;niddah&quot;, a prohibition on relations for a period including the menstrual period, and &quot;tzniut&quot;, requirements of modest dress and behavior. Traditional Judaism views the physical acts of adultery, incest, intentional waste of semen, the physical act of men having sex with men, and male masturbation as grave sins. Judaism permits relatively free divorce, with Orthodox Judaism and Conservative Judaism requiring a religious divorce ceremony for a divorce to be religiously recognized. Worldwide movements in Judaism considered more liberal have rejected Jewish law as binding but rather inspirational and allegorical, so adapted perspectives more consistent with general contemporary Western culture.

Most of mainstream Judaism does not accept polyamory, although some people consider themselves Jewish and polyamorous. One prominent rabbi who accepts polyamory is Sharon Kleinbaum, who was ordained in Reconstructionist Judaism, which considers biblical Jewish law as not necessarily binding, but is treated as a valuable cultural remnant that should be upheld unless there is reason for the contrary. She is the senior rabbi at Congregation Beit Simchat Torah in New York which works independently of any major American Jewish denomination. R Kleinbaum states that polyamory is a choice that does not preclude a Jewishly observant, socially conscious life. Some polyamorous Jews also point to biblical patriarchs having multiple wives and concubines as evidence that polyamorous relationships can be sacred in Judaism. There is an email list dedicated to polyamorous Jews, called &quot;AhavaRaba&quot;, which roughly translates to &quot;big love&quot; in Hebrew. (Its name echoes the Ahava rabbah prayer expressing thanks for God&#x27;s &quot;abundant love&quot;).

====Orthodox====

There are several levels to the observance of physical and personal modesty (&quot;tzniut&quot;), according to Orthodox Judaism, as derived from various sources in &quot;halakha&quot;. Observance of these rules varies from aspirational to mandatory to routine across the spectrum of Orthodox stricture and observance.

Orthodox Judaism also maintains a strong prohibition on interfaith sexual relations and marriage. Orthodox Judaism, alone of all the Jewish denominations, retains relatively mild traditional disabilities on divorce, including a Biblical prohibition on a Kohen (priestly descendant of Aaron) marrying a divorcee or a woman who has engaged in certain types of sexual misconduct. An Orthodox bill of divorce is required for a divorce to be recognized.

====Conservative====
Conservative Judaism, consistent with its general view that halakha (Jewish law) is a binding guide to Jewish life but subject to periodic revision by the Rabbinate, has lifted a number of strictures observed by Orthodox Judaism. In particular, in December 2006, Conservative Judaism&#x27;s Committee on Jewish Law and Standards adopted &quot;responsa&quot; presenting diametrically opposed views on the issue of homosexuality. It adopted an opinion restricting a prior prohibition on homosexual conduct to male-male anal sex only, which it declared to be the only Biblical prohibition, declaring all other prohibitions (e.g. male-male oral sex or lesbian sex) rabbinic, and lifting all rabbinic restrictions based on its interpretation of the Talmudic principle of Kevod HaBriyot (&quot;human dignity&quot;). While declining to develop a form of religious gay marriage, it permitted blessing lesbian and gay unions and ordaining openly lesbian and gay rabbis who agree not to engage in male-male anal sex. It is also a traditionalist opinion, upholding all traditional prohibitions on homosexual activity, also adopted as a majority opinion, The approach permits individual rabbis, congregations, and rabbinical schools to set their own policy on homosexual conduct. It reflects a profound change from a prior blanket prohibition on male homosexual practices. It acknowledges a sharp divergence of views on sexual matters within Conservative Judaism, such that there is no single Conservative Jewish approach to matters of sexuality. Conservative Judaism currently straddles the divide between liberal and traditional opinion on sexual matters within contemporary American society, permitting both views.

Conservative Judaism has maintained on its books a variety of requirements and prohibitions, including a requirement that married women observe the family purity laws and a general prohibition on non-marital heterosexual conduct. The family purity laws require women to be recognized as tumah or niddah during their menstrual period. As a tumah, a woman is to wait 7 days for her menstrual cycle to end and then 7 &quot;clean days&quot; in order to enter the mikveh and begin sexual relations. During this time, it is forbidden to have any type of contact with the niddah, thus anything she touches is not to be touched and no physical contact is permitted. On the same day as the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards released its homosexuality responsa, it released multiple opinions on the subject of niddah including a responsum lifting certain traditional restrictions on husband-wife contact during the niddah period while maintaining a prohibition on sexual relations. The permissive responsum on homosexuality used the Conservative movement&#x27;s approach to niddah as an analogy for construing the Biblical prohibition against male homosexual conduct narrowly and lifting restrictions it deemed Rabbinic in nature. The responsum indicated it would be making a practical analogy between an approach in which male homosexual couples would be on their honor to refrain from certain acts and its approach to niddah:
The responsum enjoined young people not to be &quot;promiscuous&quot; and to prepare themselves for &quot;traditional marriage&quot; if possible, while not explicitly lifting or re-enforcing any express strictures on non-marital heterosexual conduct.

Even before this responsum, strictures on pre-marital sex had been substantially ignored, even in official circles. For example, when the Jewish Theological Seminary of America proposed enforcing a policy against non-marital cohabitation by rabbinical students in the 1990s, protests by cohabiting rabbinical students resulted in a complete rescission of the policy.

Conservative Judaism formally prohibits interfaith marriage and its standards currently indicate it will expel a rabbi who performs an interfaith marriage. It maintains a variety of formal strictures including a prohibition on making birth announcements in synagogue bulletins for children on non-Jewish mothers and accepting non-Jews as synagogue members. However, interfaith marriage is relatively widespread among the Conservative laity, and the Conservative movement has recently adapted a policy of being more welcoming of interfaith couples in the hopes of interesting their children in Judaism.

Conservative Judaism, which was for much of the 20th century the largest Jewish denomination in the United States declined sharply in synagogue membership in the United States the 1990s, from 51% of synagogue memberships in 1990 to 33.1% in 2001, with most of the loss going to Orthodox Judaism and most of the rest to Reform. The fracturing in American society of opinion between increasingly liberal and increasingly traditionalist viewpoints on sexual and other issues, as well as the gap between official opinion and general lay practice vis-a-vis the more traditionalist and liberal denominations, may have contributed to the decline.

====Reform, Liberal, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic====

Reform Judaism, Humanistic Judaism, and Reconstructionist Judaism do not observe or require traditional sexuality rules and have welcomed non-married and homosexual couples and endorsed homosexual commitment ceremonies and marriages.

Reform and Reconstructionist Judaism are more tolerant of interfaith partnerships and often explicitly welcome interfaith families at their synagogues and services. Reform and Liberal branches of Judaism do not currently perform religious (and therefore legally binding) marriage ceremonies for interfaith couples; however as of October 2020, Liberal Rabbis may bless an interfaith marriage under a chuppah at their discretion, provided the couple intend to keep a Jewish household. Humanistic Judaism permits interfaith marriage. Reform, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic Judaism also do not require a religious divorce ceremony separate from a civil divorce.

It has been speculated that the more tolerant attitudes of Reform, Reconstructionist, and Humanistic Judaism towards both sexual diversity and interfaith marriage may have contributed to the rise in their popularity during the 1990s, from about 33% of affiliated households to 38%, passing Conservative Judaism as the largest Jewish denomination in the United States.

==Dharmic religions==

===Buddhism===
The most common formulation of Buddhist ethics are the five precepts and the Noble Eightfold Path, which say that one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure. These precepts take the form of voluntary, personal undertakings, not divine mandate or instruction.

Of the five precepts, the third vow is to refrain from sex with another&#x27;s spouse, someone under age (namely, those protected by their parents or guardians), and those who have taken vows of religious celibacy. In Chinese Buddhism, the third vow is interpreted as refraining from sex outside marriage.

Buddhist monks and nuns of most traditions are expected to refrain from all sexual activity and the Buddha is said to have admonished his followers to avoid unchastity &quot;as if it were a pit of burning cinders.&quot; While laypersons may have sex within marriage, monastics are not to have any sexual conduct at all.

===Hinduism===


Religiously, Hindus begin life at the Brahmacharya or &quot;student&quot; stage, in which they are directed to chastely advance themselves educationally and spiritually to prepare themselves for a life of furthering their &quot;dharma&quot; (societal, occupational, parental, etc. duties) and &quot;karma&quot; (right earthly actions); only once they reach the Grihastya or &quot;householder&quot; stage can they seek &quot;kama&quot; (physical pleasure) and artha (worldly achievement, material prosperity) through marriage and their vocations, respectively.

According to the Dharmasastras or the religious legal texts of Hinduism, marriage in Hinduism is an institution for reproduction and thus is naturally limited to heterosexual couples. Furthermore, sex outside of marriage is prohibited. The Manusmriti list eight types of marriage of which four are consensual and encouraged and four are non-consensual and discouraged. However, popular practices did not necessarily reflect religious teachings.

The &quot;Kama Sutra&quot; (Discourse on Kāma) by Vatsayana, widely believed to be just a manual for sexual practices, offers an insight into the sexual mores, ethics and societal rules that were prevalent in ancient India. The erotic sculptures of Khajuraho also offer insight. Abhigyana Shakuntalam, a drama in Sanskrit by Kālidāsa, cited as one of the best examples of shringara rasa (romance, one of the nine rasas or emotions), talks of the love story of Dushyanta and Shakuntala.

=== Sikhism ===
A disciplined Sikh is expected to be in control of sexual desire at all times. &quot;Kaam&quot;, or &quot;excessive&quot; lust, is one of the five thieves, or vices, that interfere with one&#x27;s spiritual journey. Normal and healthy amounts of sexuality and lust are not condemned nor considered &quot;kaam&quot;.

== East Asian religions ==

===Taoism===
In Chinese mythology, Jiutian Xuannü is the goddess of war, sex, and longevity. She is closely related to Sunü (素女), who is her divine sister. Both their names combined, as &quot;xuansu zhidao&quot; (玄素之道), signify the Daoist arts of the bedchamber. Most books bearing Jiutian Xuannü&#x27;s name were about warfare, but there were a few books that were specifically about sex. The &quot;Xuannü Jing&quot; (玄女經, &quot;Mysterious Woman Classic&quot;) and the &quot;Sunü Jing&quot; (素女經, &quot;Natural Woman Classic&quot;), both dating to the Han dynasty, were handbooks in dialogue form about sex. Texts from the &quot;Xuannü Jing&quot; have been partly incorporated into the Sui dynasty edition of the &quot;Sunü Jing&quot;. From the Han dynasty onwards, these handbooks would be familiar to the upper class. On the other side, during the Han dynasty, Wang Chong had criticized the sexual arts as &quot;not only harming the body but infringing upon the nature of man and woman.&quot; During the Tang dynasty and earlier periods, Jiutian Xuannü was often associated with the sexual arts. The &quot;Xuannü Jing&quot; remained a familiar work among the literati during the Tang and Sui dynasties.

The &quot;Dongxuanzi Fangzhong Shu&quot; (洞玄子房中術, &quot;Bedchamber Arts of the Master of the Grotto Mysteries&quot;), which was likely written by the 7th-century poet Liu Zongyuan, contains explicit descriptions of the sexual arts that was supposedly transmitted from Jiutian Xuannü. The sexual practices, that Jiutian Xuannü supposedly taught, were often compared to alchemy and physiological procedures for prolonging life. In Ge Hong&#x27;s &quot;Baopu Zi&quot;, there&#x27;s a passage in which Jiutian Xuannü tells Huangdi that sexual techniques are &quot;like the intermingling of water and fire—it can kill or bring new life depending upon whether or not one uses the correct methods.&quot;

Tu&#x27;er Shen (), The Leveret Spirit is a Chinese Shenist or Taoist deity who manages love and sex between men. His name is often colloquially translated as &quot;Rabbit God&quot;. Wei-Ming Temple in the Yonghe District of New Taipei City in Taiwan is dedicated to Tu&#x27;er Shen. About 9000 pilgrims visit the temple each year to pray to find a suitable partner. The Wei-ming temple also performs love ceremony for gay couples.

==Indigenous religions==
===African Diasporic religions===
Within Candomblé, a syncretic religion primarily found in Brazil, there is widespread (though not universal) support for gay rights, many members are LGBT, and have performed gay marriages. Practitioners of Santería, primarily found in Cuba, generally (though not universally) welcome LGBT members and include them in religious or ritual activities. Also a Brazilian syncretic religion, Umbanda houses generally support LGBT rights and have performed gay marriages. Homosexuality is religiously acceptable in Haitian Vodou. The lwa or loa (spirits) Erzulie Dantor and Erzulie Freda are often associated with and viewed as protectors of queer people. The lao Ghede Nibo is sometimes depicted as an effeminate drag queen and inspires those he inhabits to lascivious sexuality of all kinds.

===Ancient Mesopotamian religion===
Individuals who went against the traditional gender binary were heavily involved in the cult of Inanna, an ancient Mesopotamian goddess. During Sumerian times, a set of priests known as &quot;gala&quot; worked in Inanna&#x27;s temples, where they performed elegies and lamentations. Men who became &quot;gala&quot; sometimes adopted female names and their songs were composed in the Sumerian &quot;eme-sal&quot; dialect, which, in literary texts, is normally reserved for the speech of female characters. Some Sumerian proverbs seem to suggest that &quot;gala&quot; had a reputation for engaging in anal sex with men. During the Akkadian Period, &quot;kurgarrū&quot; and &quot;assinnu&quot; were servants of Ishtar who dressed in female clothing and performed war dances in Ishtar&#x27;s temples. Several Akkadian proverbs seem to suggest that they may have also had homosexual proclivities. Gwendolyn Leick, an anthropologist known for her writings on Mesopotamia, has compared these individuals to the contemporary Indian &quot;hijra.&quot; In one Akkadian hymn, Ishtar is described as transforming men into women. Some modern pagans include Inanna in their worship.

===Pre-colonial religions of the Americas===


Among the Indigenous peoples of the Americas prior to the European colonization, many Nations had respected ceremonial, religious, and social roles for homosexual, bisexual, and gender-nonconforming individuals in their communities and in many contemporary Native American and First Nations communities, these roles still exist. Homosexual and gender-variant individuals were also common among other pre-conquest civilizations in Latin America, such as the Aztecs, Mayans, Quechuas, Moches, Zapotecs, and the Tupinambá of Brazil and were accepted in their various religions.

==New religious movements==
Since the beginning of the sexual liberation movement in the Western world, which coincided with second-wave feminism and the women&#x27;s liberation movement initiated in the early 1960s, new religious movements and alternative spiritualities such as Modern Paganism and the New Age began to grow and spread across the globe alongside their intersection with the sexual liberation movement and the counterculture of the 1960s, and exhibited characteristic features, such as the embrace of alternative lifestyles, unconventional dress, rejection of Abrahamic religions and their conservative social mores, use of cannabis and other recreational drugs, relaxed attitude, sarcastic humble or self-imposed poverty, and &quot;laissez-faire&quot; sexual behavior. The sexual liberation movement was aided by feminist ideologues in their mutual struggle to challenge traditional ideas regarding female sexuality, male sexuality, and queer sexuality. Elimination of undue favorable bias towards men and objectification of women, as well as support for women&#x27;s right to choose their sexual partners free of outside interference or societal judgment, were three of the main goals associated with sexual liberation from the feminist perspective.

===Modern Paganism===
Most Neopagan religions have the theme of fertility (both physical and creative/spiritual) as central to their practices, and as such encourage what they view as a healthy sex life, consensual sex between adults, regardless of gender.

Heathenry, a modern Germanic Pagan movement, includes several pro-LGBT groups. Some groups legitimize openness toward LGBT practitioners by reference to the gender-bending actions of Thor and Odin in Norse mythology. There are, for instance, homosexual and transgender members of The Troth, a prominent U.S. Heathen organisation. Many Heathen groups in Northern Europe perform same-sex marriages, and a group of self-described &quot;Homo-Heathens&quot; marched in the 2008 Stockholm Pride carrying a statue of the Norse god Freyr. Research found a greater proportion of LGBT practitioners within Heathenry (21%) than wider society, although noted that the percentage was lower than in other forms of modern Paganism.

Wicca, like other religions, has adherents with a broad spectrum of views, ranging from conservative to liberal. It is a largely nondogmatic religion and has no prohibitions against sexual intercourse outside of marriage or relationships between members of the same sex. The religion&#x27;s ethics are largely summed up by the Wiccan Rede: &quot;An it harm none, do as thou wilt&quot;, which is interpreted by many as allowing and endorsing responsible sexual relationships of all varieties. Specifically in the Wiccan tradition of modern witchcraft, one of the widely accepted pieces of Craft liturgy, the Charge of the Goddess instructs that &quot;...all acts of love and pleasure are [the Goddess&#x27;] rituals&quot;, giving validity to all forms of sexual activity for Wiccan practitioners.

In the Gardnerian and Alexandrian forms of Wicca, the &quot;Great Rite&quot; is a sex ritual much like the hieros gamos, performed by a priest and priestess who are believed to embody the Wiccan God and Goddess. The Great Rite is almost always performed figuratively using the athame and chalice as symbols of the penis and vagina. The literal form of the ritual is always performed by consenting adults, by a couple who are already lovers and in private. The Great Rite is not seen as an opportunity for casual sex.

===Raëlism===


Raëlism, an international new religious movement and UFO religion which was founded in France in 1974, promotes a positive outlook towards human sexuality, including homosexuality. Its founder Raël recognised same-sex marriage, and a Raëlian press release stated that sexual orientation is genetic and it also likened discrimination against gay people to racism. Some Raëlian leaders have performed licensed same-sex marriages.

===Santa Muerte===
The cult of Santa Muerte is a new religious movement centered on the worship of Santa Muerte, a cult image, female deity, and folk saint which is popularly revered in Mexican Neopaganism and folk Catholicism. A personification of death, she is associated with healing, protection, and safe delivery to the afterlife by her devotees. Santa Muerte is also revered and seen as a saint and protector of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ+) communities in Mexico, since LGBTQ+ people are considered and treated as outcasts by the Catholic Church, evangelical churches, and Mexican society at large. Many LGBTQ+ people ask her for protection from violence, hatred, disease, and to help them in their search for love. Her intercession is commonly invoked in same-sex marriage ceremonies performed in Mexico. The Iglesia Católica Tradicional México-Estados Unidos, also known as the Church of Santa Muerte, recognizes gay marriage and performs religious wedding ceremonies for homosexual couples. According to R. Andrew Chesnut, PhD in Latin American history and professor of Religious studies, the cult of Santa Muerte is the single fastest-growing new religious movement in the Americas.

===Satanism===
LaVeyan Satanism is critical of Abrahamic sexual mores, considering them narrow, restrictive and hypocritical. Sex is viewed as an indulgence, but one that should only be freely entered into with consent. The Eleven Satanic Rules of the Earth only give two instructions regarding sex, namely &quot;Do not make sexual advances unless you are given the mating signal&quot; and &quot;Do not harm little children&quot;, although the latter is much broader and encompasses physical and other abuse. This has always been consistent part of Church of Satan policy since its inception in 1966 as Peter H. Gilmore wrote in an essay supporting same sex marriage:
Satanists are pluralists, accepting gays, lesbians, bisexuals, BDSM, polyamorists, transgender people, and asexuals. In that essay, he also stated:
Allegations have been made by antifascist organisations, several British politicians and the media that the Order of Nine Angles condones and encourages sexual abuse, and this has been given as one of the reasons why the O9A should be proscribed by the British government. Many O9A members openly view rape as an effective way to undermine society by transgressing against its norms. White Star Acception commits rapes by their own admission and O9A texts such as &quot;The Dreccian Way&quot;, &quot;Iron Gates&quot;, &quot;Bluebird&quot; and &quot;The Rape Anthology&quot; recommend and praise rape and pedophilia, even suggesting rape is necessary for &quot;ascension of the Ubermensch&quot;. To advance in rank, ONA member must perform assaults, lynching and sexual assault being the most recommended. Material promoting pedophilia has also appeared in ONA&#x27;s in house magazine &quot;Fenrir&quot;. According to BBC News, &quot;the authorities are concerned by the number of paedophiles associated with the ONA&quot;.

==Western esotericism and occultism==

Sex magic is a term for various types of sexual activity used in magical, ritualistic, or otherwise religious and spiritual pursuits found within Western esotericism which is a broad spectrum of spiritual traditions found in Western society, or refers to the collection of the mystical, esoteric knowledge of the Western world. One practice of sex magic is using the energy of sexual arousal or orgasm with visualization of a desired result. A premise of sex magic is the concept that sexual energy is a potent force that can be harnessed to transcend one&#x27;s normally perceived reality. The earliest known practical teachings of sex magic in the Western world come from 19th-century American occultist Paschal Beverly Randolph, under the heading of &quot;The Mysteries of Eulis&quot;. In the latter part of the 19th century, sexual reformer Ida Craddock published several works dealing with sacred sexuality, most notably &quot;Heavenly Bridegrooms&quot; and &quot;Psychic Wedlock&quot;. Aleister Crowley reviewed &quot;Heavenly Bridegrooms&quot; in the pages of his journal &quot;The Equinox&quot;, stating:

It was one of the most remarkable human documents ever produced, and it should certainly find a regular publisher in book form. The authoress of the MS. claims that she was the wife of an angel. She expounds at the greatest length the philosophy connected with this thesis. Her learning is enormous. [...]

This book is of incalculable value to every student of occult matters. No Magick library is complete without it.
Aleister Crowley became involved with Theodor Reuss and Ordo Templi Orientis following the publication of &quot;The Book of Lies&quot; between 1912 and 1913. According to Crowley&#x27;s account, Reuss approached him and accused him of having revealed the innermost (sexual) secret of O.T.O. in one of the cryptic chapters of this book. When it became clear to Reuss that Crowley had done so unintentionally, he initiated Crowley into the IX° (ninth degree) of O.T.O. and appointed him &quot;Sovereign Grand Master General of Ireland, Iona and all the Britains.&quot;

While the O.T.O. included, from its inception, the teaching of sex magick in the highest degrees of the Order, when Crowley became head of the Order, he expanded on these teachings and associated them with different degrees as follows:
* VIII°: masturbatory or auto-sexual magical techniques were taught, referred as the &quot;Lesser Work of Sol&quot;
* IX°: heterosexual magical techniques were taught
* XI°: anal intercourse magical techniques were taught.

Hugh Urban, professor of comparative religion at Ohio State University, noted Crowley&#x27;s emphasis on sex as &quot;the supreme magical power&quot;. According to Crowley:

<doc id="43245" wikidata="Q5933" url="?curid=43245" title="Westminster Abbey">
<text>Westminster Abbey, formally titled the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter at Westminster, is an Anglican church in the City of Westminster, London, England. Since 1066, it has been the location of the coronations of 40 English and British monarchs and a burial site for 18 English, Scottish, and British monarchs. At least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey since 1100.

Although the origins of the church are obscure, an abbey housing Benedictine monks was on the site by the mid-10th century. The church got its first large building from the 1040s, commissioned by King Edward the Confessor, who is buried inside. Construction of the present church began in 1245 on the orders of Henry III. The monastery was dissolved in 1559, and the church was made a royal peculiar – a Church of England church, accountable directly to the sovereign – by Elizabeth I. The abbey, the Palace of Westminster and St Margaret&#x27;s Church became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987 because of their historic and symbolic significance.

The church&#x27;s Gothic architecture is chiefly inspired by 13th-century French and English styles, although some sections of the church have earlier Romanesque styles or later Baroque and modern styles. The Henry VII Chapel, at the east end of the church, is a typical example of Perpendicular Gothic architecture; antiquarian John Leland called it &quot;orbis miraculum&quot; (&quot;the wonder of the world&quot;).

The abbey is the burial site of more than 3,300 people, many prominent in British history: monarchs, prime ministers, poets laureate, actors, musicians, scientists, military leaders, and the Unknown Warrior. Due to the fame of the figures buried there, artist William Morris described the abbey as a &quot;National Valhalla&quot;.

==History==
Historians agree that there was a monastery dedicated to Saint Peter on the site prior to the 11th century, though its exact origin is somewhat obscure. One legend claims that it was founded by the Saxon king Sæberht of Essex, and another claims that its founder was the fictional 2nd-century British king Lucius. One tradition claims that a young fisherman on the River Thames had a vision of Saint Peter near the site. This seems to have been quoted as the origin of the salmon that Thames fishermen offered to the abbey, a custom still observed annually by the Fishmongers&#x27; Company.

The origins of the abbey are generally thought to date to about 959, when Dunstan and King Edgar installed a community of Benedictine monks on the site. At that time, the location was an island in the Thames called Thorney Island. This building has not survived, but archaeologists have found some pottery and foundations from this period on the abbey site.

===Edward the Confessor&#x27;s abbey===
Between 1042 and 1052, Edward the Confessor began rebuilding Saint Peter&#x27;s Abbey to provide himself with a royal burial church. It was built in the Romanesque style and was the first church in England built on a cruciform floorplan. The master stonemason for the project was Leofsi Duddason, with Godwin and Wendelburh Gretsyd (meaning &quot;fat purse&quot;) as patrons, and Teinfrith as &quot;churchwright&quot;, probably meaning someone who worked on the carpentry and roofing. Endowments from Edward supported a community that increased from a dozen monks during Dunstan&#x27;s time, to as many as 80. The building was completed around 1060 and was consecrated on 28December 1065, about a week before Edward&#x27;s death on 5January 1066. A week later, he was buried in the church; nine years later, his wife Edith was buried alongside him. His successor, Harold Godwinson, was probably crowned here, although the first documented coronation is that of William the Conqueror later that year.

The only extant depiction of Edward&#x27;s abbey is in the Bayeux Tapestry. The foundations still survive under the present church, and above ground, some of the lower parts of the monastic dormitory survive in the undercroft, including a door said to come from the previous Anglo-Saxon abbey. It was a little smaller than the current church, with a central tower.

In 1103, thirty-seven years after his death, Edward&#x27;s tomb was re-opened by Abbot Gilbert Crispin and Henry I, who discovered that his body was still in perfect condition. This was considered proof of his saintliness, and he was canonised in 1161. Two years later he was moved to a new shrine, during which time his ring was removed and placed in the abbey&#x27;s collection.

The abbey became more closely associated with royalty from the second half of the 12th century, as kings increasingly used the nearby Palace of Westminster as the seat of their governments. In 1222, the abbey was officially granted exemption from the Bishop of London&#x27;s jurisdiction, making it answerable only to the head of the Church itself. By this time, the abbey owned a large swath of land around it, from modern-day Oxford Street to the Thames, plus entire parishes in the City of London, such as St Alban, Wood Street and St Magnus the Martyr, as well as several wharfs.

Outside London, the abbey owned estates across southeast England, including in Middlesex, Hertfordshire, Essex, Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire. The abbot was also the lord of the manor in Westminster, as a town of two to three thousand people grew around the abbey. As a consumer and employer on a grand scale, the abbey helped fuel the town&#x27;s economy, and relations with the town remained unusually cordial, but no enfranchising charter was issued during the Middle Ages.

=== Henry III&#x27;s rebuilding ===
Westminster Abbey continued to be used as a coronation site, but after Edward the Confessor, no monarchs were buried there until Henry III began to rebuild it in the Gothic style. Henry III wanted it built as a shrine to venerate Edward, to match great French churches such as Rheims Cathedral and Sainte-Chapelle, and as a burial place for himself and his family. Construction began on 6July 1245 under Henry&#x27;s master mason, Henry of Reynes. The first building stage included the entire eastern end, the transepts, and the easternmost bay of the nave. The Lady chapel, built from around 1220 at the extreme eastern end, was incorporated into the chevet of the new building.

Part of the new building included a rich shrine and chapel to Edward the Confessor, of which the base only still stands. The golden shrine with its jewelled figures no longer exists. 4,000 marks (about £5,800) for this work came from the estate of David of Oxford, the husband of Licoricia of Winchester, and a further £2,500 came from a forced contribution from Licoricia herself, by far the biggest single donation at that time.

Around 1253, Henry of Reynes was replaced by John of Gloucester, who was replaced by Robert of Beverley around 1260. During the summer, there were up to 400 workers on the site at a time, including stonecutters, marblers, stone-layers, carpenters, painters and their assistants, marble polishers, smiths, glaziers, plumbers, and general labourers. From 1257, Henry III held assemblies of local representatives in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s chapter house; these assemblies were a precursor to the House of Commons. Henry III also commissioned the Cosmati pavement in front of the High Altar. Further work produced an additional five bays for the nave, bringing it to one bay west of the choir. Here, construction stopped in about 1269. By 1261, Henry had spent £29,345 19s 8d on the abbey, and the final sum may have been near £50,000. A consecration ceremony was held on 13October 1269, during which the remains of Edward the Confessor were moved to their present location at the shrine behind the main altar. After Henry&#x27;s death and burial in the abbey in 1272, construction did not resume and Edward the Confessor&#x27;s old Romanesque nave remained attached to the new building for over a century.

In 1296, Edward I captured the Scottish coronation stone, the Stone of Scone. He had a Coronation Chair made to hold it, which he entrusted to the abbot at Westminster Abbey. In 1303, the small crypt underneath the chapter house was broken into and a great deal of the king&#x27;s treasure was stolen. It was thought that the thieves must have been helped by the abbey monks, fifty of whom were subsequently imprisoned in the Tower of London.

=== Completion of the Gothic church ===
From 1376, Abbot Nicholas Litlyngton and Richard II donated large sums to finish the church. The remainder of the old nave was pulled down and rebuilding commenced, with his mason Henry Yevele closely following the original design even though it was now more than 100 years out of date. During the Peasants&#x27; Revolt of 1381, Richard prayed at Edward the Confessor&#x27;s shrine for &quot;divine aid when human counsel was altogether wanting&quot; before meeting the rebels at Smithfield. In the modern day, the abbey holds Richard&#x27;s full-length portrait, the earliest of an English king, on display near the west door.

Building work was not fully complete for many years. Henry V, disappointed with the abbey&#x27;s unfinished state, gave extra funds towards the rebuilding. In his will, he left instructions for a chantry chapel to be built over his tomb; the chapel can be seen from ground level. Between 1470 and 1471, because of fallout from the Wars of the Roses, Elizabeth Woodville, the wife of Edward IV, took sanctuary at Westminster Abbey while her husband was deposed, and gave birth to Edward V in the abbot&#x27;s house. In 1495, building work finally reached the end of the nave, finishing with the west window.

Under Henry VII, the 13th-century Lady chapel was demolished and rebuilt in a Perpendicular Gothic style; it is known as the Henry VII Chapel. Work began in 1503 and the main structure was completed by 1509, although decorative work continued for several years afterwards. Henry&#x27;s original reason for building such a grand chapel was to have a place suitable for the burial of another saint alongside the Confessor, as he planned on having Henry VI canonised. The Pope asked Henry VII for a large sum of money to proclaim Henry VI a saint; Henry VII was unwilling to pay the sum, and so instead he is buried in the centre of the chapel with his wife, Elizabeth of York, rather than a large raised shrine like the Confessor.

A view of the abbey dated 1532 shows a lantern tower above the crossing, but this is not shown in any later depiction. It is unlikely that the loss of this feature was caused by any catastrophic event: structural failure seems more likely. Other sources maintain that a lantern tower was never built. The current squat pyramid dates from the 18th century; the painted wooden ceiling below it was installed during repairs to World War II bomb damage.
In the early 16th century, a project began under Abbot John Islip to add two towers to the western end of the church. These had been partially built up to roof level when building work stopped due to uncertainty caused by the English Reformation.

=== Dissolution and Reformation ===
In the 1530s, Henry VIII broke away from the authority of the Catholic Church in Rome and seized control of England&#x27;s monasteries, including Westminster Abbey, beginning the English Reformation. In 1535, when the king&#x27;s officers assessed the abbey&#x27;s funds, their annual income was £3,000. Henry&#x27;s agents removed many relics, saints&#x27; images, and treasures from the abbey. The golden feretory that housed the coffin of Edward the Confessor was melted down, and monks hid his bones to save them from destruction. The monastery was dissolved and the building became the cathedral for the newly created Diocese of Westminster. The abbot, William Benson, became dean of the cathedral, while the prior and five of the monks were among the twelve newly created canons.

The Westminster diocese was dissolved in 1550, but the abbey was recognised (in 1552, retroactively to 1550) as a second cathedral of the Diocese of London until 1556. Money meant for the abbey, which is dedicated to St Peter, was diverted to the treasury of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral; this led to an association with the already-old saying &quot;robbing Peter to pay Paul&quot;.

The abbey saw the return of Benedictine monks under the Catholic Mary I, but they were again ejected under Elizabeth I in 1559. In 1560, Elizabeth re-established Westminster as a &quot;royal peculiar&quot; – a church of the Church of England responsible directly to the sovereign, rather than to a diocesan bishop – and made it the Collegiate Church of Saint Peter, a non-cathedral church with an attached chapter of canons, headed by a dean. From that date onwards, the building was simply a church, though it was still called an abbey. Elizabeth also re-founded Westminster School, providing for 40 students (the King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) Scholars) and their schoolmasters. The King&#x27;s Scholars have the duty of shouting &quot;Vivat Rex&quot; or &quot;Vivat Regina&quot; (&quot;Long live the King/Queen&quot;) during the coronation of a new monarch. In the modern day, the dean of Westminster Abbey remains the chair of the school governors.

In the early 17th century, the abbey hosted two of the six companies of churchmen who produced the King James Version of the Bible. They used the Jerusalem Chamber in the abbey for their meetings. The First Company was headed by the dean of the abbey, Lancelot Andrewes.

In 1642, the English Civil War broke out between Charles I and his own parliament. The Dean and Chapter fled the abbey at the outbreak of war, and were replaced by priests loyal to Parliament. The abbey itself suffered damage during the war; altars, stained glass, the organ, and the Crown Jewels were damaged or destroyed. Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell was given an elaborate funeral there in 1658, only for a body thought to be Cromwell&#x27;s to be disinterred in January 1661 and posthumously hanged from a gibbet at Tyburn. In 1669, the abbey was visited by the diarist Samuel Pepys, who saw the body of the 15th-century queen Catherine de Valois. She had been buried in the 13th-century Lady chapel in 1437, but was exhumed during building work for the Henry VII Chapel and not reburied in the intervening 150 years. Pepys leaned into the coffin and kissed her on the mouth, writing &quot;This was my birthday, thirty-six years old and I did first kiss a queen.&quot; She has since been re-interred close to her husband, Henry V. In 1685, during preparations for the coronation of James II, a workman accidentally put a scaffolding pole through the coffin of Edward the Confessor. A chorister, Charles Taylour, pulled a cross on a chain out of the coffin and gave it to the king, who then gave it to the Pope. Its whereabouts are unknown.

=== 18th and 19th centuries ===
At the end of the 17th century, the architect Christopher Wren was appointed the abbey&#x27;s first Surveyor of the Fabric. He began a project to restore the exterior of the church, which was continued by his successor, William Dickinson. After over two hundred years, the abbey&#x27;s two western towers were built in the 1740s in a Gothic–Baroque style by Nicholas Hawksmoor and John James.

On 11 November 1760, the funeral of George II was held at the abbey, and the king was interred next to his late wife, Caroline of Ansbach. He left instructions for the sides of his and his wife&#x27;s coffins to be removed so that their remains could mingle. He was the last monarch to be buried in the abbey. Around the same time, the tomb of RichardII developed a hole through which visitors could put their hands. Several of his bones went missing, including a jawbone which was taken by a boy from Westminster School and kept by his family until 1906, when it was returned to the abbey.

In the 1830s, the screen dividing the nave from the choir, which had been designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor, was replaced by one designed by Edward Blore. The screen contains the monuments to the scientist Isaac Newton and the military general James Stanhope. Further rebuilding and restoration occurred in the 19th century under the architect George Gilbert Scott, who rebuilt sections of the chapter house and north porches, and designed a new altar and reredos for the crossing. His successor, J. L. Pearson, finished the work on the north porches and also reconstructed the northern rose window.

===20th century===
The abbey saw &quot;Prayers For Prisoners&quot; suffragette protests in 1913 and 1914. Protesters attended services and interrupted proceedings by chanting &quot;God Save Mrs Pankhurst&quot; and praying for suffragette prisoners. In one protest, a woman chained herself to her chair during a sermon by the Archbishop of Canterbury. On 11June 1914, a bomb planted by suffragettes of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union exploded inside the abbey. No serious injuries were reported, but the bomb blew off a corner of the Coronation Chair. It also caused the Stone of Scone to break in half, although this was not discovered until 1950 when four Scottish nationalists broke into the church to steal the stone and return it to Scotland.

In preparation for bombing raids during World War II, the Coronation Chair and many of the abbey&#x27;s records were moved out of the city, and the Stone of Scone was buried. In 1941, on the night of 10May and the early morning of 11May, the Westminster Abbey precincts and roof were hit by incendiary bombs. Although the Auxiliary Fire Service and the abbey&#x27;s own fire-watchers were able to stop the fire spreading to the whole of the church, the deanery and three residences of abbey clergy and staff were badly damaged, and the lantern tower above the crossing collapsed, leaving the abbey open to the sky. The cost of the damage was estimated at £135,000. Some damage can still be seen in the RAF Chapel, where a small hole in the wall was created by a bomb that fell outside the chapel. No one was killed, and the abbey continued to hold services throughout the war. When hostilities ceased, evacuated objects were returned to the abbey, 60,000 sandbags were moved out, and a new permanent roof was built over the crossing. Two different designs for a narthex (entrance hall) for the west front were produced by architects Edwin Lutyens and Edward Maufe during World War II, but neither was built.

Because of its outstanding universal value, the abbey was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, together with the nearby Palace of Westminster and St Margaret&#x27;s Church.

In 1997, the abbey, which was then receiving approximately 1.75 million visitors each year, began charging admission fees to visitors at the door (although a fee for entering the eastern half of the church had existed prior to 1600).

=== 21st century ===

In June 2009, the first major building work in 250 years was proposed. A corona – a crown-like architectural feature – was suggested to be built around the lantern over the central crossing, replacing an existing pyramidal structure dating from the 1950s. This was part of a wider £23-million development of the abbey completed in 2013. On 4 August 2010, the Dean and Chapter announced that, &quot;after a considerable amount of preliminary and exploratory work&quot;, efforts toward the construction of a corona would not be continued.

The Cosmati pavement underwent a major cleaning and restoration programme for two years, beginning in 2008. On 17September 2010, Pope Benedict XVI became the first pope to set foot in the abbey when he participated in a service of evening prayer with archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. On 29April 2011, the abbey hosted the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.

In 2018, the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Galleries were opened. Located in the medieval triforium, high up around the sanctuary, they are areas for displaying the abbey&#x27;s treasures. A new Gothic access tower with a lift was designed by the abbey architect and Surveyor of the Fabric, Ptolemy Dean.

In 2020, a 13th-century sacristy was uncovered in the grounds of the abbey as part of an archaeological excavation. The sacristy was used by the monks of the abbey to store objects used in Mass, such as vestments and chalices. Also on the site were hundreds of buried bodies, mostly of abbey monks. On 10 March 2021, a vaccination centre opened in Poets&#x27; Corner to administer doses of COVID-19 vaccines.

== Architecture ==
The building is chiefly built in a Geometric Gothic style, using Reigate stone for facings. The church has an eleven-bay nave with aisles, transepts, and a chancel with ambulatory and radiating chapels. The building is supported with two tiers of flying buttresses. The western end of the nave and the west front were designed by Henry Yevele in a Perpendicular Gothic style. The Henry VII Chapel was built in a late Perpendicular style in Huddlestone stone, probably by Robert and William Vertue. The west towers were designed by Nicholas Hawksmoor and blend the Gothic style of the abbey with the Baroque style fashionable during his lifetime.

The modern Westminster Abbey is largely based on French Gothic styles, especially those found at Reims Cathedral, rather than the contemporaneous English Gothic styles. For example, the English Gothic style favours large and elaborate towers, while Westminster Abbey did not have any towers until the 18th century. It is also more similar to French churches than English ones in terms of its ratio of height to width: Westminster Abbey has the highest nave of any Gothic church in England, and the nave is much narrower than any medieval English church of a similar height. Instead of a short, square, eastern end (as was the English fashion), Westminster Abbey has a long, rounded apse, and it also has chapels radiating from the ambulatory, which is typical of a French Gothic style. However, there are also distinctively English elements, such as the use of materials of contrasting colours, as with the Purbeck marble and white stone in the crossing.

The northern entrance has three porches, with the central one featuring an elaborately-carved tympanum, leading it to acquire the nickname &quot;Solomon&#x27;s porch&quot; as a reference to the legendary temple in Jerusalem.

The abbey retains its 13th- and 14th-century cloisters, which would have been one of the busiest parts of the church when it was part of a monastery. The west cloister was used for the teaching of novice monks, the north for private study. The south cloister led to the refectory, and the east to the chapter house and dormitory. In the southwest corner of the cloisters is a cellarium formerly used by the monks to store food and wine; in modern times, it is the abbey café. The north cloister and northern end of the east cloister, closest to the church, are the oldest; they date to , whereas the rest are from 1352 to 1366. The abbey also contains a Little Cloister, on the site of the monks&#x27; infirmary. The Little Cloister dates from the end of the 17th century and contains a small garden with a fountain in the centre. A passageway from the Little Cloister leads to College Garden, which has been in continuous use for 900 years, beginning as the medicine garden for the monks of the abbey and now overlooked by canons&#x27; houses and the dormitory for Westminster School.

The newest part of the abbey is the Weston Tower, finished in 2018 and designed by Ptolemy Dean. It sits between the chapter house and the Henry VII Chapel, and contains a lift shaft and spiral staircase to allow public access to the triforium, which contains the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Galleries. The tower has a star-shaped floorplan and leaded windows with an elaborate crown rooftop. The lift shaft inside is faced with 16 kinds of stone from the abbey&#x27;s history, including Purbeck marble, Reigate stone, and Portland stone. The project took five years and cost £22.9million. The galleries were designed by McInnes Usher McKnight.

=== Interior ===
The church&#x27;s interior has Purbeck marble piers and shafting. The roof vaulting is quadripartite, with ridge ribs and bosses and, at , it is one of Britain&#x27;s highest church vaults. To accommodate as many guests as possible during coronations, the transepts were designed to be unusually long and the choir was placed east (rather than west) of the crossing; this is also seen in Rheims Cathedral. The 13th-century interior would have been painted in bright colours and gilded, although the piers would have been left unpainted.

Although the nave was built over the course of centuries from the east to the west end, generations of builders stuck to the original design and it has a unified style. Markers of the long gap in building between 1269 and 1376 are relatively minor, but can be seen at the fifth bay from the crossing. The spandrels above the arches towards the earlier east end are decorated with diaper-work, and are plain towards the (later) west end. The lancet windows on the earlier side have a foiled circle, and have an unencircled quatrefoil on the later side; the shields on the aisle walls are carved on the earlier side, and painted on the later side. Above the crossing, in the centre of the church, is a roof lantern which was destroyed by a bomb in 1941 and restored by architect Stephen Dykes Bower in 1958. In the choir aisles, shields of donors to the 13th- and 14th-century rebuilding are carved and painted in the spandrels of the arcade. At the eastern end of the nave is a large screen separating the nave from the choir, made of 13th-century stone, reworked by Edward Blore in 1834, and with paintwork and gilding by Bower in the 1960s.

Behind the main altar is the shrine and tomb of Edward the Confessor. Saints&#x27; shrines were once common in English medieval churches, but most were destroyed during the English Reformation and Edward is the only major English saint whose body still occupies his shrine. Arranged around him in a horseshoe shape are a series of tombs of medieval kings and their queens: Henry III, Eleanor of Castile, Edward I, Philippa of Hainault, Edward III, Anne of Bohemia, and Richard II. Henry V is in the centre of the horseshoe, at the eastern end. Henry III&#x27;s tomb was originally covered with pieces of coloured glass and stone, since picked off by generations of tourists. Above Henry V&#x27;s tomb, at mezzanine level over the ambulatory, is a chantry chapel built by mason John Thirske and decorated with many sculpted figures (including Henry V riding a horse and being crowned in the abbey). At the western end, the shrine is separated from the main church by a stone reredos which makes it a semi-private space. The reredos depicts episodes from Edward&#x27;s life, including his birth and the building of the abbey. The shrine is closed to the public, except for special events.

The abbey includes side chapels radiating from the ambulatory. Many were originally included in the 13th-century rebuilding as altars dedicated to individual saints, and many of the chapels still bear saints&#x27; names (such as St Nicholas and St Paul). Saints&#x27; cults were no longer orthodox after the English Reformation, and the chapels were repurposed as places for extra burials and monuments. In the north ambulatory are the Islip Chapel, the Nurses&#x27; Memorial Chapel (sometimes called the Nightingale Chapel), the Chapel of Our Lady of the Pew, the Chapel of St John the Baptist, and St Paul&#x27;s Chapel. The Islip Chapel is named after Abbot John Islip, who commissioned it in the 16th century. The screen inside is decorated with a visual pun on his name: an eye and a boy falling from a tree (eye-slip). Additional chapels in the eastern aisle of the north transept are named after (from south to north) St John the Evangelist, St Michael, and St Andrew. The chapels of St Nicholas, St Edmund, and St Benedict are in the south ambulatory.

The footprint of the south transept is smaller than the northern one because the 13th-century builders butted against the pre-existing 11th-century cloisters. To make the transepts match, the south transept overhangs the western cloister; this permitted a room above the cloisters which was used to store the abbey muniments. In the south transept is the chapel of St Faith, built as the vestry for the abbey&#x27;s monks. On the east wall is a painting of St Faith holding the grid-iron on which she was roasted to death.

=== Chapter house and Pyx Chamber ===
The octagonal chapter house was used by the abbey monks for daily meetings, where they would hear a chapter of the Rule of St Benedict and receive their instructions for the day from the abbot. The chapter house was built between 1250 and 1259 and is one of the largest in Britain, measuring nearly across. For 300 years after the English Reformation, it was used to store state records until they were moved to the Public Record Office in 1863. It was restored by George Gilbert Scott in the 19th century.

The entrance is approached from the east cloister via outer and inner vestibules, and the ceiling becomes higher as a visitor approaches the chapter house. It is an octagonal room with a central pillar, built with a small crypt below. Around the sides are benches for 80 monks, above which are large stained-glass windows depicting the coats of arms of several monarchs and the abbey&#x27;s patrons and abbots. The exterior includes flying buttresses (added in the 14th century) and a leaded roof designed by Scott. The interior walls of the chapter house are decorated with 14th- and 15th-century paintings of the Apocalypse, the Last Judgement, and birds and animals. The chapter house also has an original, mid-13th-century tiled floor. A wooden door in the vestibule, made with a tree felled between 1032 and 1064, is one of Britain&#x27;s oldest. It may have been the door to the 11th-century chapter house in Edward the Confessor&#x27;s abbey, and was re-used as the door to the Pyx Chamber in the 13th century. It now leads to an office.

The adjoining Pyx Chamber was the undercroft of the monks&#x27; dormitory. Dating to the late 11th century, it was used as a monastic and royal treasury. The outer walls and circular piers also date to the 11th century; several capitals were enriched in the 12th century, and the stone altar was added in the 13th century. The term &quot;pyx&quot; refers to the boxwood chest in which coins were held and presented to a jury during the Trial of the Pyx, when newly minted coins were presented to ensure they conformed to the required standards. The chapter house and Pyx Chamber are in the guardianship of English Heritage, but under the care and management of the Dean and Chapter of Westminster.

=== Henry VII Chapel ===


The Henry VII Lady Chapel, also known simply as the Henry VII Chapel, is a large lady chapel at the far eastern end of the abbey which was paid for by the will of King Henry VII. The chapel, built in late Perpendicular Gothic style, inspired English poet John Leland to call it the &quot;orbis miraculum&quot; (the wonder of the world). The tombs of several monarchs, including Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, George II and Mary, Queen of Scots, are in the chapel.

It is noted for its pendant- and fan vault-style ceiling, probably designed by William Vertue, which writer Washington Irving said was &quot;achieved with the wonderful minuteness and airy security of a cobweb&quot;. The ceiling is not a true fan vault, but a groin vault disguised as a fan vault. The interior walls are densely decorated with carvings, including 95 statues of saints. Many statues of saints in England were destroyed in the 17th century, so these are rare survivors. Like much of the rest of the medieval building, they would originally have been painted and gilded. From outside, The chapel walls are supported from outside by flying buttresses, each in the form of a polygonal tower topped with a cupola. At the centre of the chapel is the tomb of Henry VII and his wife, Elizabeth of York, which was sculpted by Pietro Torrigiano (who fled to England from Italy after breaking Michaelangelo&#x27;s nose in a fight).

The chapel has sub-chapels radiating from the main structure. One, to the north, contains the tombs of Mary I and Elizabeth I; both coffins are in Elizabeth&#x27;s monument. Another, to the south, contains the tomb of Mary, Queen of Scots. Both monuments were commissioned by James I, Elizabeth&#x27;s successor to the English throne and Mary&#x27;s son. At the far eastern end is the RAF Chapel, with a stained-glass window dedicated to those who died in the 1940 Battle of Britain. The RAF Chapel was the original burial site of Oliver Cromwell in 1658. Cromwell was disinterred in 1661, after the Stuart Restoration, when his body was hanged in chains on the gallows at Tyburn.

The chapel has been the mother church of the Order of the Bath since 1725, and the banners of its members hang above the stalls. The stalls retain their medieval misericords: small ledges for monks to perch on during services, often decorated with varied and humorous carvings.
=== Monastic buildings ===
Many rooms used by the monks have been repurposed. The dormitory became a library and a school room, and the monks&#x27; offices have been converted into houses for the clergy. The abbot had his own lodgings, and ate separately from the rest of the monks. The lodgings, now used by the Dean of Westminster, are probably the oldest continuously occupied residence in London. They include the Jericho Parlour (covered in wooden linenfold panelling), the Jerusalem Chamber (commissioned in 1369), and a grand dining hall with a minstrels&#x27; gallery which is now used by Westminster School. The prior also had his own household, separate from the monks, on the site of present-day Ashburnham House in Little Dean&#x27;s Yard (now also part of Westminster School).

== Artworks and treasures ==
The nave and transepts have sixteen crystal chandeliers made of hand-blown Waterford glass. Designed by A. B. Read and Stephen Dykes Bower, they were donated by the Guinness family in 1965 to commemorate the abbey&#x27;s 900th anniversary. The choir stalls were designed by Edward Blore in 1848. Some stalls are assigned to high commissioners of countries in the Commonwealth of Nations.

Beyond the crossing to the west is the sacrarium, which contains the high altar. The abbey has the 13th-century Westminster Retable, thought to be the altarpiece from Henry III&#x27;s 13th-century church and the earliest surviving English panel painting altatrpiece, in its collections. The present high altar and screen were designed by George Gilbert Scott between 1867 and 1873, with sculptures of Moses, St Peter, St Paul, and King David by H. H. Armistead, as well as a mosaic of the Last Supper by J. R. Clayton and Antonio Salviati.

The south transept contains wall paintings made , which Richard Jenkyns calls &quot;the grandest of their time remaining in England&quot;. Depicting Thomas the Apostle looking at Christ&#x27;s wounds and St Christopher carrying the Christ Child, the paintings were discovered in 1934 behind two monuments. Fourteenth-century paintings are on the backs of the &quot;sedilia&quot; (seats used by priests on either side of the high altar). On the south side are three figures: Edward the Confessor, the angel Gabriel, and the Virgin Mary. On the north side are two kings (possibly Henry III and Edward I) surrounding a religious figure, possibly St Peter. They were walled off during the Commonwealth period by order of Parliament, and were later rediscovered.

Over the Great West Door are ten statues of 20th-century Christian martyrs of various denominations; the statues were sculpted by the abbey&#x27;s craftsmen in 1998. Those commemorated are Maximilian Kolbe, Manche Masemola, Janani Luwum, Grand Duchess Elizabeth Feodorovna, Martin Luther King Jr., Óscar Romero, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Esther John, Lucian Tapiedi, and Wang Zhiming.

From the chapter house is a doorway leading to the abbey&#x27;s library, which was built as a dormitory for the monks and has been used as a library since the 16th century. The collection has about 16,000 volumes. Next to the library is the Muniment Room, where the abbey&#x27;s historic archives are kept.

=== Cosmati pavement ===
At the crossing in front of Edward the Confessor&#x27;s shrine and the main altar is the Cosmati pavement, a 700-year-old tile floor made of almost 30,000 pieces of coloured glass and stone. Measuring almost 25 feet square, coronations take place here.

The floor is named after the Cosmati family in Rome, who were known for such work. It was commissioned by Richard Ware, who travelled to Rome in 1258, when he became abbot, and returned with stone and artists. The porphyry used was originally quarried as far away as Egypt, and was presumably brought to Italy during the Roman Empire. It was surrounded by a Latin inscription in brass letters (since lost) identifying the artist as Odericus, probably referring to designer Pietro di Oderisio or his son. The inscription also predicted the end of the world 19,863 years after its creation. Unlike traditional mosaic work, the pieces were not cut to a uniform size but made using a technique known as &quot;opus sectile&quot; (&quot;cut work&quot;). It is unique among Cosmati floors in Europe for the use of dark Purbeck-marble trays, forming bold borders, instead of the more typical white marble. The pavement influenced later floor treatments at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, and Canterbury Cathedral.

Geometric designs, such as those in the pavement, were thought to help the abbey&#x27;s monks with contemplation, and conveyed medieval Christian ideas on the nature of the universe that could not easily be put into words. Much of the design relies on the geometric doubling of the square, considered a trade secret by stonemasons. The four-sided squares, four-fold symmetry, and the four inner roundels of the design represent the four elements of classical philosophy, with the central roundel representing the unformed state of the universe at its creation. Each inner roundel is touched by two bands, which represent the shared qualities of each element; water and air were both considered &quot;moist&quot; in classical philosophy, and air and fire were both considered &quot;hot&quot;.

=== Stained glass ===

The abbey&#x27;s 13th-century windows would have been filled with stained glass, but much of this was destroyed in the English Civil War and the Blitz and was replaced with clear, plain glass. Since the 19th century, new stained glass, designed by artists such as Ninian Comper (on the north side of the nave) and Hugh Easton and Alan Younger (in the Henry VII Chapel), has replaced clear glass.

The north rose window was designed by James Thornhill and made by Joshua Price in 1722; it shows Christ, the apostles (without Judas Iscariot), the Four Evangelists, and, in the centre, the Bible. The window was restored by J. L. Pearson in the 19th century, during which the feet of the figures were cut off. Thornhill also designed the great west window, which shows the Biblical figures of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as representatives of the Twelve Tribes of Israel underneath.

In the Henry VII Chapel, the west window was designed by John Lawson and unveiled in 1995. It depicts coats of arms and cyphers of Westminster Abbey&#x27;s benefactors, particularly John Templeton (whose coat of arms is prominent in the lower panel). In the centre are the arms of Elizabeth II. The central east window, designed by Alan Younger and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, was unveiled in 2000. It depicts Comet Hale–Bopp, which was passing over the artist&#x27;s house at the time, as the star of Bethlehem. The donors of the window, Lord and Lady Harris of Peckham, are shown kneeling at the bottom.

In 2018, artist David Hockney unveiled a new stained-glass window for the north transept to celebrate the reign of Elizabeth II. It shows a country scene inspired by his native Yorkshire, with hawthorn blossoms and blue skies. Hockney used an iPad to design the window, replicating the backlight that comes through stained glass.

=== Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Galleries ===

The Westminster Abbey Museum was located in the 11th-century vaulted undercroft beneath the former monks&#x27; dormitory. This is one of the oldest areas of the abbey, dating almost to the foundation of the church by Edward the Confessor in 1065. This space had been used as a museum since 1908, but was closed to the public when it was replaced as a museum in June 2018 by the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Galleries (high in the abbey&#x27;s triforium and accessed through the Weston Tower, which encloses a lift and stairs).

The exhibits include a set of life-size effigies of English and British monarchs and their consorts, originally made to lie on the coffin in the funeral procession or to be displayed over the tomb. The effigies date from the 14th to the 18th centuries, and some include original clothes.

On display in the galleries is &quot;The Coronation Theatre, Westminster Abbey: A Portrait of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II&quot;, a portrait by Ralph Heimans of the queen standing on the Cosmati pavement where she was crowned in 1953. Other exhibits include a model of an unbuilt tower designed by Christopher Wren; a paper model of the abbey as it was for Queen Victoria&#x27;s 1837 coronation; and the wedding licence of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, who were married in the abbey in 2011.

== Burials and memorials ==

Over 3,300 people are buried or commemorated in the abbey. For much of its history, most of the people buried there (other than monarchs) were people with a connection to the church – either ordinary locals or the monks of the abbey, who were generally buried without surviving markers. Since the 18th century, it has been an honour for any British person to be buried or commemorated in the abbeya practice boosted by the lavish funeral and monument of Isaac Newton, who died in 1727. By 1900, so many prominent figures were buried in the abbey that the writer William Morris called it a &quot;National Valhalla&quot;.

Politicians buried in the abbey include Pitt the Elder, Charles James Fox, Pitt the Younger, William Wilberforce, William Gladstone, and Clement Attlee. A cluster of scientists surrounds the tomb of Isaac Newton, including Charles Darwin and Stephen Hawking. Actors include David Garrick, Henry Irving, and Laurence Olivier. Musicians tend to be buried in the north aisle of the nave, and include Henry Purcell and Ralph Vaughan Williams. George Frideric Handel is buried in Poets&#x27; Corner.

An estimated 18 English, Scottish and British monarchs are buried in the abbey, including Edward the Confessor, Henry III, Edward I, Edward III, Richard II, Henry V, Edward V, Henry VII, Edward VI, Mary I, Mary Queen of Scots, Elizabeth I, James I, Charles II, Mary II, William III, Queen Anne, and George II. Elizabeth and Mary Queen of Scots were the last monarchs to be buried with full tomb effigies; monarchs buried after them are commemorated in the abbey with simple inscriptions. George II was the last monarch to be buried in the abbey, in 1760, and George III&#x27;s brother, Henry Frederick, was the last member of the royal family to be buried in the abbey, in 1790. Most monarchs after George II have been buried in St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor Castle, or at the Frogmore Royal Burial Ground, east of Windsor Castle.

=== Poets&#x27; Corner ===

The south transept of the church is known as Poets&#x27; Corner because of its high number of burials of, and memorials to, poets and writers. The first was Geoffrey Chaucer (buried around 1400), who was employed as Clerk of the King&#x27;s Works and had apartments in the abbey. A second poet, Edmund Spenser (who was local to the abbey), was buried nearby in 1599. The idea of a Poets&#x27; Corner did not crystallise until the 18th century, when memorials were established to writers buried elsewhere, such as William Shakespeare and John Milton. Since then, writers buried in Poets&#x27; Corner have included John Dryden, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Charles Dickens, and Rudyard Kipling. Not all writers buried in the abbey are in the south transept; Ben Jonson is buried standing upright in the north aisle of the nave, and Aphra Behn in the cloisters.

=== The Unknown Warrior ===
On the floor, just inside the Great West Door in the centre of the nave, is the grave of the Unknown Warrior: an unidentified soldier killed on a European battlefield during the First World War. Although many countries have a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (or Warrior), the one in Westminster Abbey was the first; it came about as a response to the unprecedented death toll of the war. The idea came from army chaplain David Railton, who suggested it in 1920. The funeral was held on 11 November 1920, the second anniversary of the end of the war. The Unknown Warrior lay in state for a week afterwards, and an estimated 1.25 million people viewed his gravesite in that time. This grave is the only floor stone in the abbey on which it is forbidden to walk, and every visit by a foreign head of state begins with a visit to it.

== Royal occasions ==
The abbey has strong connections with the royal family. It has been patronised by monarchs, been the location for coronations, royal weddings and funerals, and several monarchs have attended services there. One monarch was born and one died at Westminster Abbey. In 1413, Henry IV collapsed while praying at the shrine of Edward the Confessor. He was moved into the Jerusalem Chamber, and died shortly afterwards. Edward V was born in the abbot&#x27;s house in 1470.

The first jubilee celebration held at the abbey was for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee in 1887. Rather than wearing the full regalia that she had worn at her coronation, she wore her black mourning clothes topped with the insignia of the Order of the Garter and a miniature crown. She sat in the Coronation Chair—which received a coat of dark varnish for the occasion, which was painstakingly removed afterwards—making her the only monarch to sit in the chair twice. Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip, marked their silver, gold, and diamond wedding anniversaries with services at the abbey and regularly attended annual observances there for Commonwealth Day.

The monarch participates in the Office of the Royal Maundy on Maundy Thursday each year, during which selected elderly people (as many people of each sex as the monarch has years of their life) receive alms of coins. The service has been held at churches around the country since 1952, returning to the abbey every 10 years.

=== Coronations ===

Since the coronation of William the Conqueror in 1066, 40 English and British monarchs have been crowned in Westminster Abbey (not counting Edward V, Lady Jane Grey, and Edward VIII, who were never crowned). In 1216, Henry III could not be crowned in the abbey because London was occupied by hostile forces at the time. Henry was crowned in Gloucester Cathedral, and had a second coronation at Westminster Abbey in 1220. When he had the abbey rebuilt, it was designed with long transepts to accommodate many guests at future coronations. Much of the order of service derives from the &quot;Liber Regalis&quot;, an illuminated manuscript made in 1377 for the coronation of Richard II and held in the abbey&#x27;s collections. On 6 May 2023, the coronation of Charles III took place at the abbey. The area used in the church is the crossing, known in the abbey as &quot;the theatre&quot; because of its suitability for grand events. The space in the crossing is clear rather than filled with immovable pews (like many similar churches), allowing for temporary seating in the transepts.
The Coronation Chair (the throne on which English and British sovereigns are seated when they are crowned) is in the abbey&#x27;s St George&#x27;s Chapel near the west door, and has been used at coronations since the 14th century. From 1301 to 1996 (except for a short time in 1950, when the stone was stolen by Scottish nationalists), the chair housed the Stone of Scone upon which the kings of Scots were crowned. Although it has been kept in Scotland at Edinburgh Castle since 1996, the stone is returned to the Coronation Chair in the abbey as needed for coronations. The chair was accessible to the public during the 18th and 19th centuries; people could sit in it, and some carved initials into the woodwork.

Before the 17th century, a king would hold a separate coronation for his new queen if he married after his coronation. The last of these to take place in the abbey was the coronation of Anne Boleyn in 1533, after her marriage to Henry VIII. Fifteen coronations of queens consort have been held in the abbey. A coronation for Jane Seymour, Henry VIII&#x27;s third wife, was planned but she died before it took place; no coronations were planned for Henry&#x27;s subsequent wives. Mary I&#x27;s husband, Philip of Spain, was not given a separate coronation due to concerns that he would attempt to rule alone after Mary&#x27;s death. Since then, there have been few opportunities for a second coronation; monarchs have generally come to the throne already married.

Henry II held a coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey in 1170 for his son, known as Henry the Young King, while Henry II was still alive in an attempt to secure the succession. However, the Young King died before his father and never took the throne.

===Weddings===
At least 16 royal weddings have taken place at the abbey. Royal weddings at the abbey were relatively rare before the 20th century, with royals often married in a Chapel Royal or at Windsor Castle; this changed with the 1922 wedding of Princess Mary at the abbey. In 1923, Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon became the first royal bride to leave her bouquet on the grave of the Unknown Warrior, a practice continued by many royal brides since.
Royal weddings have included:
=== Funerals ===
Many royal funerals took place at the abbey between that of Edward the Confessor in 1066 and that of Prince Henry, the last royal buried in the church, in 1790. There were no royal funerals at the abbey from then until that of Queen Alexandra in 1925; the queen was buried in Windsor Castle. Other queen consorts, such as Mary of Teck in 1953 and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother in 2002, have also had funerals at the abbey before being buried elsewhere.

On 6 September 1997, the ceremonial funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales was held at the abbey. Before the funeral, the railings of the abbey were swamped with flowers and tributes. The event was more widely seen than any previous occasion in the abbey&#x27;s history, with 2 billion television viewers worldwide. Diana was buried privately on a private island at Althorp, her family estate.

On 19 September 2022, the state funeral of Elizabeth II took place at the abbey before her burial at St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor. It was the first funeral of a monarch at Westminster Abbey for more than 260 years.

==People==

=== Dean and Chapter ===
Westminster Abbey is a collegiate church governed by the Dean and Chapter of Westminster as established by a royal charter from Elizabeth I dated 21 May 1560, which created it as the Collegiate Church of St Peter Westminster (a royal peculiar). In 2019, David Hoyle was appointed Dean of Westminster. The chapter consists of four canons and a senior administrative officer, known as the Receiver General. One of the canons is also rector of the adjoining St Margaret&#x27;s Church, Westminster, and is often the chaplain of the Speaker of the House of Commons. In addition to the dean and canons, there are minor canons.

=== King&#x27;s almsmen ===
Six King&#x27;s (or Queen&#x27;s) almsmen and women are supported by the abbey. They are appointed by royal warrant on the recommendation of the dean and the Home Secretary, attend Matins and Evensong on Sundays, and perform requested duties for a small stipend. On duty, they wear a distinctive red gown with a crowned rose badge on the left shoulder.

The almshouse was founded near the abbey by Henry VII in 1502, and the twelve almsmen and three almswomen were originally minor court officials who were retired due to age or disability. They were required to be over the age of 50, single, with a good reputation, literate, able to look after themselves, and with an income of under £4 per year. The building survived the Dissolution of the Monasteries, but was demolished for road-widening in 1779. From the late 18th to the late 20th century, almsmen were usually old soldiers and sailors; today, they are primarily retired abbey employees.

=== Schools ===
Westminster School is in the abbey. Instruction has taken place since the 14th century with the monks of the abbey; the school regards its founder as Elizabeth I, who dissolved the monastery for the last time and provided for the establishment of the school, the dean, canons, assistant clergy, and lay officers. The schoolboys were rambunctious; Westminster boys have defaced the Coronation Chair, disrupted services, and once interrupted the consecration of four bishops with a bare-knuckle fight in the cloisters. One schoolboy carved on the Coronation Chair that he had slept in it overnight, making him probably its longest inhabitant. Westminster School became independent of the abbey Dean and Chapter in 1868, although the institutions remain closely connected. Westminster Abbey Choir School, also on the abbey grounds, educates the choirboys who sing for abbey services.

=== Order of the Bath ===
The Most Honourable Order of the Bath is a British order of chivalry whose spiritual home is the abbey&#x27;s Henry VII Chapel. The order was founded by George I in 1725, fell out of fashion after 1812, and was revived by George V in 1913. The name derives from the elaborate medieval ceremony for appointing a knight, which included bathing as a symbol of purification. Members are given stalls with their banner, crest, and a stall plate at installation ceremonies in the abbey every four years. Since there are more members than stalls, some members wait many years for their installation. The Order of the Bath is the fourth-oldest British orders of chivalry, after the Orders of the Garter, the Thistle, and St Patrick (the latter is presently dormant).

==Music==

Andrew Nethsingha has been the abbey&#x27;s organist and master of the choristers since 2023. Peter Holder is the sub-organist, Matthew Jorysz the assistant organist, and Dewi Rees is the organ scholar.

===Choir===
Since its foundation in the 14th century, the primary role of the Westminster Abbey choir has been to sing for daily services; the choir also plays a central role in many state occasions, including royal weddings and funerals, coronations, and memorial services. In 2012, the choir accepted an invitation from Pope Benedict XVI to sing with the Sistine Chapel Choir at a Papal Mass in St Peter&#x27;s Basilica. The all-male choir consists of twelve professional adult singers and thirty boy choristers from eight to 13 years old who attend the Westminster Abbey Choir School.

===Organ===
The first record of an organ at Westminster Abbey was the mention of a gift of three marks from Henry III in 1240 for the repair of one (or more) organs. &quot;Unum parem organorum&quot; (&quot;a pair of organs&quot;) was recorded in the Lady Chapel in 1304. An inventory compiled for the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1540 lists a pair of organs in the choir and one in the Islip Chapel. During the Commonwealth, a Royalist source said that soldiers who were billeted in the abbey &quot;brake downe the Organ, and pawned the pipes at severall Ale-houses for pots of Ale&quot;; an organ was played at the Restoration in 1660, however, suggesting that it had not been completely destroyed. In 1720, an organ gifted by George II and built by Christopher Shrider was installed over the choir screen; organs had previously been hidden on the north side of the choir. The organ was rebuilt by William Hill &amp; Son in 1848.

A new organ was built by Harrison &amp; Harrison in 1937, with four manuals and 84 speaking stops, and was played publicly for the first time at the coronation of George VI and Elizabeth that year. Some pipework from the previous Hill organ of 1848 was re-voiced and incorporated into the new instrument. The two organ cases, designed and built in the late 19th century by J. L. Pearson, were reinstated and coloured in 1959.

In 1982 and 1987, Harrison &amp; Harrison enlarged the organ at the direction of Simon Preston to include an additional lower choir organ and a bombarde organ. The full instrument has five manuals and 109 speaking stops. Its console was refurbished by Harrison &amp; Harrison in 2006, and space was prepared for two additional 16-foot stops on the lower choir organ and the bombarde organ. The abbey has three other organs: the two-manual Queen&#x27;s Organ in the Lady Chapel, a smaller continuo organ, and a practice organ.

===Bells===
There have been bells at the abbey since at least the time of Henry III, and the current bells were installed in the north-west tower in 1971. The ring is made up of ten bells, hung for change ringing, which were cast in 1971 by the Whitechapel Bell Foundry and tuned to the musical notes F#, E, D, C#, B, A, G, F#, E and D. The tenor bell in D (588.5 Hz) has a weight of 30cwt, 1qtr, 15 lb (3,403 lb, or 1,544 kg). Two additional service bells were cast by Robert Mot in 1585 and 1598, and a sanctus bell was cast in 1738 by Richard Phelps and Thomas Lester. Two bells are unused; one was cast , and the second was cast in 1742 by Thomas Lester. The Westminster Abbey Company of Ringers ring peals on special occasions, such as the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.

== In popular culture ==
Westminster Abbey is mentioned in the play &quot;Henry VIII&quot; by William Shakespeare and John Fletcher, when a gentleman describes Anne Boleyn&#x27;s coronation. The abbey was mentioned in a 1598 sonnet by Thomas Bastard which begins, &quot;When I behold, with deep astonishment/ To famous Westminster how there restort/ Living in brass or stony monument/ The princes and the worthies of all sort&quot;. Poetry about the abbey has also been written by Francis Beaumont and John Betjeman. The building has appeared in paintings by artists such as Canaletto, Wenceslaus Hollar, William Bruce Ellis Ranken, and J. M. W. Turner.

Playwright Alan Bennett produced &quot;The Abbey&quot;, a 1995 documentary recounting his experiences of the building. Key scenes in the book and film &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; take place in Westminster Abbey. The abbey refused to allow filming in 2005 (calling the book &quot;theologically unsound&quot;), and the film uses Lincoln Cathedral as a stand-in. The abbey issued a fact sheet to their staff which answered questions and debunked several claims made in the book. In 2022, it was announced that the abbey had given rare permission to film inside the church for &quot;&quot;.

He was born in Fundi, today in Campania, in the Lazio region of Italy. Soter is known for declaring that marriage was valid only as a sacrament blessed by a priest and also for formally inaugurating Easter as an annual festival in Rome.
His name, from Greek Σωτήριος from σωτήρ &quot;saviour&quot;, would be his baptismal name, as his lifetime predates the tradition of adopting papal names.

==Roman Martyrology==
Saint Soter&#x27;s feast day is celebrated on 22 April, as is that of Saint Caius. The Roman Martyrology, the official list of recognized saints, references Soter: &quot;At Rome, Saint Soter, Pope, whom Dionysius of Corinth praises for his outstanding charity towards needy exiled Christians who came to him, and towards those who had been condemned to the mines.&quot;

It has often been supposed that all the earliest Popes suffered martyrdom, but the Roman Martyrology does not give Pope Soter the title of martyr. The book detailing the 1969 revision of the General Roman Calendar states: &quot;There are no grounds for including Saint Soter and Saint Caius among the martyrs.&quot;

==Reaction to the Montanist movement==
The Montanist movement, which originated in Asia Minor, made its way to Rome and Gaul in the second half of the 2nd century, during the reign of Eleuterus. Its nature did not diverge so much from the orthodoxy of the time for it to initially be labeled heresy. During the violent persecution at Lyon, in 177, local confessors wrote from their prison concerning the new movement to the Asiatic and Phrygian communities as well as to Pope Eleuterus. The bearer of their letter to the pope was the presbyter Irenaeus, soon to become Bishop of Lyon. It appears from statements of Eusebius concerning these letters that the Christians of Lyon, though opposed to the Montanist movement, advocated patience and pleaded for the preservation of ecclesiastical unity.

When the Roman church took its definite stand against Montanism is not precisely known. Tertullian records that a Roman bishop sent some conciliatory letters to the Montanists, but based on the complaints of Praxeas &quot;concerning the prophets themselves and their churches, and by insistence on the decisions of the bishop&#x27;s predecessors&quot; forced the pontiff to recall these letters. The &quot;Praedestinatorum Haeresis&quot; (once attributed to Augustine of Hippo, but now considered to be the work of an unknown author) states that &quot;Holy Soter, Pope of the City, wrote against them a book, as did the master, Apollonius of Ephesus. Against these wrote the priest Tertullian of Carthage, who &quot;in all ways wrote well, wrote first and wrote incomparably, in this alone did reprehensibly, that he defended Montanus&quot;. At Rome, the Gnostics and Marcionites continued to preach against the Catholic Church.

<doc id="43254" wikidata="Q48324" url="?curid=43254" title="Morality">
<text>Morality () is the categorization of intentions, decisions and actions into those that are proper, or &quot;right&quot;, and those that are improper, or &quot;wrong&quot;. Morality can be a body of standards or principles derived from a code of conduct from a particular philosophy, religion or culture, or it can derive from a standard that is understood to be universal. Morality may also be specifically synonymous with &quot;goodness&quot;, &quot;appropriateness&quot; or &quot;rightness&quot;.

Moral philosophy includes meta-ethics, which studies abstract issues such as moral ontology and moral epistemology, and normative ethics, which studies more concrete systems of moral decision-making such as deontological ethics and consequentialism. An example of normative ethical philosophy is the Golden Rule, which states: &quot;One should treat others as one would like others to treat oneself.&quot;

Immorality is the active opposition to morality (i.e., opposition to that which is good or right), while amorality is variously defined as an unawareness of, indifference toward, or disbelief in any particular set of moral standards or principles.

== History ==
== Ethics ==

Ethics (also known as moral philosophy) is the branch of philosophy which addresses questions of morality. The word &quot;ethics&quot; is &quot;commonly used interchangeably with &#x27;morality&#x27;... and sometimes it is used more narrowly to mean the moral principles of a particular tradition, group, or individual.&quot; Likewise, certain types of ethical theories, especially deontological ethics, sometimes distinguish between ethics and morality.
Philosopher Simon Blackburn writes that &quot;Although the morality of people and their ethics amounts to the same thing, there is a usage that restricts morality to systems such as that of Immanuel Kant, based on notions such as duty, obligation, and principles of conduct, reserving ethics for the more Aristotelian approach to practical reasoning, based on the notion of a virtue, and generally avoiding the separation of &#x27;moral&#x27; considerations from other practical considerations.&quot;

== Descriptive and normative ==
In its descriptive sense, &quot;morality&quot; refers to personal or cultural values, codes of conduct or social mores that are observed to be accepted by a significant number of individuals (not necessarily all) in a society. It does not connote objective claims of right or wrong, but only refers to claims of right and wrong that are seen to be made and to conflicts between different claims made. Descriptive ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.

In its normative sense, &quot;morality&quot; refers to whatever (if anything) is &quot;actually&quot; right or wrong, which may be independent of the values or mores held by any particular peoples or cultures. Normative ethics is the branch of philosophy which studies morality in this sense.

== Realism and anti-realism ==
Philosophical theories on the nature and origins of morality (that is, theories of meta-ethics) are broadly divided into two classes:
* Moral realism is the class of theories which hold that there are true moral statements that report objective moral facts. For example, while they might concede that forces of social conformity significantly shape individuals&#x27; &quot;moral&quot; decisions, they deny that those cultural norms and customs define morally right behavior. This may be the philosophical view propounded by ethical naturalists, but not all moral realists accept that position (e.g. ethical non-naturalists).
* Moral anti-realism, on the other hand, holds that moral statements either fail or do not even attempt to report objective moral facts. Instead, they hold that moral sentences are either categorically false claims of objective moral facts (error theory); claims about subjective attitudes rather than objective facts (ethical subjectivism); or else do not attempt to describe the world at all but rather something else, like an expression of an emotion or the issuance of a command (non-cognitivism).

Some forms of non-cognitivism and ethical subjectivism, while considered anti-realist in the robust sense used here, are considered realist in the sense synonymous with moral universalism. For example, universal prescriptivism is a universalist form of non-cognitivism which claims that morality is derived from reasoning about implied imperatives, and divine command theory and ideal observer theory are universalist forms of ethical subjectivism which claim that morality is derived from the edicts of a god or the hypothetical decrees of a perfectly rational being, respectively.

==Anthropology==

=== Morality with practical reasoning ===
Practical reason is necessary for the moral agency but it is not a sufficient condition for moral agency. Real life issues that need solutions do need both rationality and emotion to be sufficiently moral. One uses rationality as a pathway to the ultimate decision, but the environment and emotions towards the environment at the moment must be a factor for the result to be truly moral, as morality is subject to culture. Something can only be morally acceptable if the culture as a whole has accepted this to be true. Both practical reason and relevant emotional factors are acknowledged as significant in determining the morality of a decision.

===Tribal and territorial===
Celia Green made a distinction between tribal and territorial morality. She characterizes the latter as predominantly negative and proscriptive: it defines a person&#x27;s territory, including his or her property and dependents, which is not to be damaged or interfered with. Apart from these proscriptions, territorial morality is permissive, allowing the individual whatever behaviour does not interfere with the territory of another. By contrast, tribal morality is prescriptive, imposing the norms of the collective on the individual. These norms will be arbitrary, culturally dependent and &#x27;flexible&#x27;, whereas territorial morality aims at rules which are universal and absolute, such as Kant&#x27;s &#x27;categorical imperative&#x27; and Geisler&#x27;s graded absolutism. Green relates the development of territorial morality to the rise of the concept of private property, and the ascendancy of contract over status.

===In-group and out-group===

Some observers hold that individuals apply distinct sets of moral rules to people depending on their membership of an &quot;in-group&quot; (the individual and those they believe to be of the same group) or an &quot;out-group&quot; (people not entitled to be treated according to the same rules). Some biologists, anthropologists and evolutionary psychologists believe this in-group/out-group discrimination has evolved because it enhances group survival. This belief has been confirmed by simple computational models of evolution. In simulations this discrimination can result in both unexpected cooperation towards the in-group and irrational hostility towards the out-group. Gary R. Johnson and V.S. Falger have argued that nationalism and patriotism are forms of this in-group/out-group boundary. Jonathan Haidt has noted that experimental observation indicating an in-group criterion provides one moral foundation substantially used by conservatives, but far less so by liberals.

In-group preference is also helpful at the individual level for the passing on of one&#x27;s genes. For example, a mother who favors her own children more highly than the children of other people will give greater resources to her children than she will to strangers&#x27;, thus heightening her children&#x27;s chances of survival and her own gene&#x27;s chances of being perpetuated. Due to this, within a population, there is substantial selection pressure exerted toward this kind of self-interest, such that eventually, all parents wind up favoring their own children (the in-group) over other children (the out-group).

===Comparing cultures===
Peterson and Seligman approach the anthropological view looking across cultures, geo-cultural areas and across millennia. They conclude that certain virtues have prevailed in all cultures they examined. The major virtues they identified include &quot;wisdom / knowledge; courage; humanity; justice; temperance; and transcendence&quot;. Each of these include several divisions. For instance &quot;humanity&quot; includes &quot;love&quot;, &quot;kindness&quot;, and &quot;social intelligence&quot;.

Still, others theorize that morality is not always absolute, contending that moral issues often differ along cultural lines. A 2014 PEW research study among several nations illuminates significant cultural differences among issues commonly related to morality, including divorce, extramarital affairs, homosexuality, gambling, abortion, alcohol use, contraceptive use, and premarital sex. Each of the 40 countries in this study has a range of percentages according to what percentage of each country believes the common moral issues are acceptable, unacceptable, or not moral issues at all. Each percentage regarding the significance of the moral issue varies greatly on the culture in which the moral issue is presented.

Advocates of a theory known as moral relativism subscribe to the notion that moral virtues are right or wrong only within the context of a certain standpoint (e.g., cultural community). In other words, what is morally acceptable in one culture may be taboo in another. They further contend that no moral virtue can objectively be proven right or wrong Critics of moral relativism point to historical atrocities such as infanticide, slavery, or genocide as counter arguments, noting the difficulty in accepting these actions simply through cultural lenses.

Fons Trompenaars, author of &quot;Did the Pedestrian Die?&quot;, tested members of different cultures with various moral dilemmas. One of these was whether the driver of a car would have his friend, a passenger riding in the car, lie in order to protect the driver from the consequences of driving too fast and hitting a pedestrian. Trompenaars found that different cultures had quite different expectations, from none to definite.

Anthropologists from Oxford&#x27;s Institute of Cognitive &amp; Evolutionary Anthropology (part of the School of Anthropology &amp; Museum Ethnography) analysed ethnographic accounts of ethics from 60 societies, comprising over 600,000 words from over 600 sources and discovered what they believe to be seven universal moral rules: help your family, help your group, return favours, be brave, defer to superiors, divide resources fairly, and respect others&#x27; property.

==Evolution==
The development of modern morality is a process closely tied to sociocultural evolution. Some evolutionary biologists, particularly sociobiologists, believe that morality is a product of evolutionary forces acting at an individual level and also at the group level through group selection (although to what degree this actually occurs is a controversial topic in evolutionary theory). Some sociobiologists contend that the set of behaviors that constitute morality evolved largely because they provided possible survival or reproductive benefits (i.e. increased evolutionary success). Humans consequently evolved &quot;pro-social&quot; emotions, such as feelings of empathy or guilt, in response to these moral behaviors.

On this understanding, moralities are sets of self-perpetuating and biologically driven behaviors which encourage human cooperation. Biologists contend that all social animals, from ants to elephants, have modified their behaviors, by restraining immediate selfishness in order to improve their evolutionary fitness. Human morality, although sophisticated and complex relative to the moralities of other animals, is essentially a natural phenomenon that evolved to restrict excessive individualism that could undermine a group&#x27;s cohesion and thereby reducing the individuals&#x27; fitness.

On this view, moral codes are ultimately founded on emotional instincts and intuitions that were selected for in the past because they aided survival and reproduction (inclusive fitness). Examples: the maternal bond is selected for because it improves the survival of offspring; the Westermarck effect, where close proximity during early years reduces mutual sexual attraction, underpins taboos against incest because it decreases the likelihood of genetically risky behaviour such as inbreeding.

The phenomenon of reciprocity in nature is seen by evolutionary biologists as one way to begin to understand human morality. Its function is typically to ensure a reliable supply of essential resources, especially for animals living in a habitat where food quantity or quality fluctuates unpredictably. For example, some vampire bats fail to feed on prey some nights while others manage to consume a surplus. Bats that did eat will then regurgitate part of their blood meal to save a conspecific from starvation. Since these animals live in close-knit groups over many years, an individual can count on other group members to return the favor on nights when it goes hungry (Wilkinson, 1984)

Marc Bekoff and Jessica Pierce (2009) have argued that morality is a suite of behavioral capacities likely shared by all mammals living in complex social groups (e.g., wolves, coyotes, elephants, dolphins, rats, chimpanzees). They define morality as &quot;a suite of interrelated other-regarding behaviors that cultivate and regulate complex interactions within social groups.&quot; This suite of behaviors includes empathy, reciprocity, altruism, cooperation, and a sense of fairness. In related work, it has been convincingly demonstrated that chimpanzees show empathy for each other in a wide variety of contexts. They also possess the ability to engage in deception, and a level of social politics prototypical of our own tendencies for gossip and reputation management.
Christopher Boehm (1982) has hypothesized that the incremental development of moral complexity throughout hominid evolution was due to the increasing need to avoid disputes and injuries in moving to open savanna and developing stone weapons. Other theories are that increasing complexity was simply a correlate of increasing group size and brain size, and in particular the development of theory of mind abilities.

==Psychology==


In modern moral psychology, morality is sometimes considered to change through personal development. Several psychologists have produced theories on the development of morals, usually going through stages of different morals. Lawrence Kohlberg, Jean Piaget, and Elliot Turiel have cognitive-developmental approaches to moral development; to these theorists morality forms in a series of constructive stages or domains. In the Ethics of care approach established by Carol Gilligan, moral development occurs in the context of caring, mutually responsive relationships which are based on interdependence, particularly in parenting but also in social relationships generally. Social psychologists such as Martin Hoffman and Jonathan Haidt emphasize social and emotional development based on biology, such as empathy. Moral identity theorists, such as William Damon and Mordechai Nisan, see moral commitment as arising from the development of a self-identity that is defined by moral purposes: this moral self-identity leads to a sense of responsibility to pursue such purposes. Of historical interest in psychology are the theories of psychoanalysts such as Sigmund Freud, who believe that moral development is the product of aspects of the super-ego as guilt-shame avoidance. Theories of moral development therefore tend to regard it as positive moral development: the higher stages are morally higher, though this, naturally, involves a circular argument. The higher stages are better because they are higher, but the better higher because they are better.

As an alternative to viewing morality as an individual trait, some sociologists as well as social- and discursive psychologists have taken upon themselves to study the &quot;in-vivo&quot; aspects of morality by examining how persons conduct themselves in social interaction.

A new study analyses the common perception of a decline in morality in societies worldwide and throughout history. Adam M. Mastroianni and Daniel T. Gilbert present a series of studies indicating that the perception of moral decline is an illusion and easily produced, with implications for misallocation of resources, underuse of social support, and social influence. To begin with, the authors demonstrate that people in no less than 60 nations hold the belief that morality is deteriorating continuously, and this conviction has been present for the last 70 years. Subsequently, they indicate that people ascribe this decay to the declining morality of individuals as they age and the succeeding generations. Thirdly, the authors demonstrate that people&#x27;s evaluations of the morality of their peers have not decreased over time, indicating that the belief in moral decline is an illusion. Lastly, the authors explain a basic psychological mechanism that uses two well-established phenomena (distorted exposure to information and distorted memory of information) to cause the illusion of moral decline. The authors present studies that validate some of the predictions about the circumstances in which the perception of moral decline is attenuated, eliminated, or reversed (e.g., when participants are asked about the morality of people closest to them or people who lived before they were born).

===Moral cognition===

Moral cognition refers to cognitive processes implicated in moral judgment and decision making, and moral action. It consists of several domain-general cognitive processes, ranging from perception of a morally salient stimulus to reasoning when faced with a moral dilemma. While it is important to mention that there is not a single cognitive faculty dedicated exclusively to moral cognition, characterizing the contributions of domain-general processes to moral behavior is a critical scientific endeavor to understand how morality works and how it can be improved.

Cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists investigate the inputs to these cognitive processes and their interactions, as well as how these contribute to moral behavior by running controlled experiments. In these experiments putatively moral versus nonmoral stimuli are compared to each other, while controlling for other variables such as content or working memory load. Often, the differential neural response to specifically moral statements or scenes, are examined using functional neuroimaging experiments.

Critically, the specific cognitive processes that are involved depend on the prototypical situation that a person encounters. For instance, while situations that require an active decision on a moral dilemma may require active reasoning, an immediate reaction to a shocking moral violation may involve quick, affect-laden processes. Nonetheless, certain cognitive skills such as being able to attribute mental states—beliefs, intents, desires, emotions to oneself, and others is a common feature of a broad range of prototypical situations. In line with this, a meta-analysis found overlapping activity between moral emotion and moral reasoning tasks, suggesting a shared neural network for both tasks. The results of this meta-analysis, however, also demonstrated that the processing of moral input is affected by task demands.

Regarding the issues of morality in video games, some scholars believe that because players appear in video games as actors, they maintain a distance between their sense of self and the role of the game in terms of imagination. Therefore, the decision-making and moral behavior of players in the game are not representing player&#x27;s Moral dogma.

It has been recently found that moral judgment consists in concurrent evaluations of three different components that align with precepts from three dominant moral theories (virtue ethics, deontology, and consequentialism): the character of a person (Agent-component, A); their actions (Deed-component, D); and the consequences brought about in the situation (Consequences-component, C). This, implies that various inputs of the situation a person encounters affect moral cognition.

Jonathan Haidt distinguishes between two types of moral cognition: moral intuition and moral reasoning. Moral intuition involves the fast, automatic, and affective processes that result in an evaluative feeling of good-bad or like-dislike, &quot;without&quot; awareness of going through any steps. Conversely, moral reasoning does involve conscious mental activity to reach a moral judgment. Moral reasoning is controlled and less affective than moral intuition. When making moral judgments, humans perform moral reasoning to support their initial intuitive feeling. However, there are three ways humans can override their immediate intuitive response. The first way is conscious verbal reasoning (for example, examining costs and benefits). The second way is reframing a situation to see a new perspective or consequence, which triggers a different intuition. Finally, one can talk to other people which illuminates new arguments. In fact, interacting with other people is the cause of most moral change.

==Neuroscience==
The brain areas that are consistently involved when humans reason about moral issues have been investigated by multiple quantitative large-scale meta-analyses of the brain activity changes reported in the moral neuroscience literature. The neural network underlying moral decisions overlaps with the network pertaining to representing others&#x27; intentions (i.e., theory of mind) and the network pertaining to representing others&#x27; (vicariously experienced) emotional states (i.e., empathy). This supports the notion that moral reasoning is related to both seeing things from other persons&#x27; points of view and to grasping others&#x27; feelings. These results provide evidence that the neural network underlying moral decisions is probably domain-global (i.e., there might be no such things as a &quot;moral module&quot; in the human brain) and might be dissociable into cognitive and affective sub-systems.

Cognitive neuroscientist Jean Decety thinks that the ability to recognize and vicariously experience what another individual is undergoing was a key step forward in the evolution of social behavior, and ultimately, morality. The inability to feel empathy is one of the defining characteristics of psychopathy, and this would appear to lend support to Decety&#x27;s view. Recently, drawing on empirical research in evolutionary theory, developmental psychology, social neuroscience, and psychopathy, Jean Decety argued that empathy and morality are neither systematically opposed to one another, nor inevitably complementary.

===Brain areas===

An essential, shared component of moral judgment involves the capacity to detect morally salient content within a given social context. Recent research implicated the salience network in this initial detection of moral content. The salience network responds to behaviorally salient events and may be critical to modulate downstream default and frontal control network interactions in the service of complex moral reasoning and decision-making processes.

The explicit making of moral right and wrong judgments coincides with activation in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC), a region involved in valuation, while intuitive reactions to situations containing implicit moral issues activates the temporoparietal junction area, a region that plays a key role in understanding intentions and beliefs.

Stimulation of the VMPC by transcranial magnetic stimulation, or neurological lesion, has been shown to inhibit the ability of human subjects to take into account intent when forming a moral judgment. According to such investigations, TMS did not disrupt participants&#x27; ability to make any moral judgment. On the contrary, moral judgments of intentional harms and non-harms were unaffected by TMS to either the RTPJ or the control site; presumably, however, people typically make moral judgments of intentional harms by considering not only the action&#x27;s harmful outcome but the agent&#x27;s intentions and beliefs. So why were moral judgments of intentional harms not affected by TMS to the RTPJ? One possibility is that moral judgments typically reflect a weighted function of any morally relevant information that is available at the time. Based on this view, when information concerning the agent&#x27;s belief is unavailable or degraded, the resulting moral judgment simply reflects a higher weighting of other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). Alternatively, following TMS to the RTPJ, moral judgments might be made via an abnormal processing route that does not take belief into account. On either account, when belief information is degraded or unavailable, moral judgments are shifted toward other morally relevant factors (e.g., outcome). For intentional harms and non-harms, however, the outcome suggests the same moral judgment as to the intention. Thus, the researchers suggest that TMS to the RTPJ disrupted the processing of negative beliefs for both intentional harms and attempted harms, but the current design allowed the investigators to detect this effect only in the case of attempted harms, in which the neutral outcomes did not afford harsh moral judgments on their own.

Similarly, individuals with a lesion of the VMPC judge an action purely on its outcome and are unable to take into account the intent of that action.

==Genetics==

Moral intuitions may have genetic bases. A 2022 study conducted by scholars Michael Zakharin and Timothy C. Bates, and published by the &quot;European Journal of Personality&quot;, found that moral foundations have significant genetic bases. Another study, conducted by Smith and Hatemi, similarly found significant evidence in support of moral heritability by looking at and comparing the answers of moral dilemmas between twins. 

Genetics play a role in influencing prosocial behaviors and moral decision-making. Genetics contribute to the development and expression of certain traits and behaviors, including those related to morality. However, it is important to note that while genetics play a role in shaping certain aspects of moral behavior, morality itself is a multifaceted concept that encompasses cultural, societal, and personal influences as well.

==Politics==
If morality is the answer to the question &#x27;how ought we to live&#x27; at the individual level, politics can be seen as addressing the same question at the social level, though the political sphere raises additional problems and challenges. It is therefore unsurprising that evidence has been found of a relationship between attitudes in morality and politics. Moral foundations theory, authored by Jonathan Haidt and colleagues, has been used to study the differences between liberals and conservatives, in this regard. Haidt found that Americans who identified as liberals tended to value care and fairness higher than loyalty, respect and purity. Self-identified conservative Americans valued care and fairness less and the remaining three values more. Both groups gave care the highest over-all weighting, but conservatives valued fairness the lowest, whereas liberals valued purity the lowest. Haidt also hypothesizes that the origin of this division in the United States can be traced to geo-historical factors, with conservatism strongest in closely knit, ethnically homogeneous communities, in contrast to port-cities, where the cultural mix is greater, thus requiring more liberalism.

Group morality develops from shared concepts and beliefs and is often codified to regulate behavior within a culture or community. Various defined actions come to be called moral or immoral. Individuals who choose moral action are popularly held to possess &quot;moral fiber&quot;, whereas those who indulge in immoral behavior may be labeled as socially degenerate. The continued existence of a group may depend on widespread conformity to codes of morality; an inability to adjust moral codes in response to new challenges is sometimes credited with the demise of a community (a positive example would be the function of Cistercian reform in reviving monasticism; a negative example would be the role of the Dowager Empress in the subjugation of China to European interests). Within nationalist movements, there has been some tendency to feel that a nation will not survive or prosper without acknowledging one common morality, regardless of its content.

Political morality is also relevant to the behavior internationally of national governments, and to the support they receive from their host population. The Sentience Institute, co-founded by Jacy Reese Anthis, analyzes the trajectory of moral progress in society via the framework of an expanding moral circle. Noam Chomsky states that
... if we adopt the principle of universality: if an action is right (or wrong) for others, it is right (or wrong) for us. Those who do not rise to the minimal moral level of applying to themselves the standards they apply to others—more stringent ones, in fact—plainly cannot be taken seriously when they speak of appropriateness of response; or of right and wrong, good and evil.

In fact, one of them, maybe the most, elementary of moral principles is that of universality, that is, If something&#x27;s right for me, it&#x27;s right for you; if it&#x27;s wrong for you, it&#x27;s wrong for me. Any moral code that is even worth looking at has that at its core somehow.

==Religion==

Religion and morality are not synonymous. Morality does not depend upon religion although for some this is &quot;an almost automatic assumption&quot;. According to &quot;The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics&quot;, religion and morality &quot;are to be defined differently and have no definitional connections with each other. Conceptually and in principle, morality and a religious value system are two distinct kinds of value systems or action guides.&quot;

=== Positions ===
Within the wide range of moral traditions, religious value-systems co-exist with contemporary secular frameworks such as consequentialism, freethought, humanism, utilitarianism, and others. There are many types of religious value-systems. Modern monotheistic religions, such as Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and to a certain degree others such as Sikhism and Zoroastrianism, define right and wrong by the laws and rules as set forth by their respective scriptures and as interpreted by religious leaders within each respective faith. Other religions spanning pantheistic to nontheistic tend to be less absolute. For example, within Buddhism, the intention of the individual and the circumstances should be accounted for in the form of merit, to determine if an action is termed right or wrong. Barbara Stoler Miller points out a further disparity between the values of religious traditions, stating that in Hinduism, &quot;practically, right and wrong are decided according to the categories of social rank, kinship, and stages of life. For modern Westerners, who have been raised on ideals of universality and egalitarianism, this relativity of values and obligations is the aspect of Hinduism most difficult to understand&quot;.

Religions provide different ways of dealing with moral dilemmas. For example, Hinduism lacks any absolute prohibition on killing, recognizing that it &quot;may be inevitable and indeed necessary&quot; in certain circumstances. Monotheistic traditions view certain acts—such as abortion or divorce—in more absolute terms. Religion is not always positively associated with morality. Philosopher David Hume stated that &quot;the greatest crimes have been found, in many instances, to be compatible with a superstitious piety and devotion; Hence it is justly regarded as unsafe to draw any inference in favor of a man&#x27;s morals, from the fervor or strictness of his religious exercises, even though he himself believe them sincere.&quot;

Religious value-systems can be used to justify acts that are contrary to general contemporary morality, such as massacres, misogyny and slavery. For example, Simon Blackburn states that &quot;apologists for Hinduism defend or explain away its involvement with the caste system, and apologists for Islam defend or explain away its harsh penal code or its attitude to women and infidels&quot;. In regard to Christianity, he states that the &quot;Bible can be read as giving us a carte blanche for harsh attitudes to children, the mentally handicapped, animals, the environment, the divorced, unbelievers, people with various sexual habits, and elderly women&quot;, and notes morally-suspect themes in the Bible&#x27;s New Testament as well. Elizabeth Anderson likewise holds that &quot;the Bible contains both good and evil teachings&quot;, and it is &quot;morally inconsistent&quot;. Christian apologists address Blackburn&#x27;s viewpoints and construe that Jewish laws in the Hebrew Bible showed the evolution of moral standards towards protecting the vulnerable, imposing a death penalty on those pursuing slavery and treating slaves as persons and not as property. Humanists like Paul Kurtz believe that we can identify moral values across cultures, even if we do not appeal to a supernatural or universalist understanding of principles – values including integrity, trustworthiness, benevolence, and fairness. These values can be resources for finding common ground between believers and nonbelievers.

=== Empirical analyses ===
Several studies have been conducted on the empirics of morality in various countries, and the overall relationship between faith and crime is unclear. A 2001 review of studies on this topic found &quot;The existing evidence surrounding the effect of religion on crime is varied, contested, and inconclusive, and currently, no persuasive answer exists as to the empirical relationship between religion and crime.&quot; Phil Zuckerman&#x27;s 2008 book, &quot;Society without God&quot;, based on studies conducted during 14 months in Scandinavia in 2005–2006, notes that Denmark and Sweden, &quot;which are probably the least religious countries in the world, and possibly in the history of the world&quot;, enjoy &quot;among the lowest violent crime rates in the world [and] the lowest levels of corruption in the world&quot;.

Dozens of studies have been conducted on this topic since the twentieth century. A 2005 study by Gregory S. Paul published in the &quot;Journal of Religion and Society&quot; stated that, &quot;In general, higher rates of belief in and worship of a creator correlate with higher rates of homicide, juvenile and early adult mortality, STD infection rates, teen pregnancy, and abortion in the prosperous democracies,&quot; and &quot;In all secular developing democracies a centuries long-term trend has seen homicide rates drop to historical lows&quot; with the exceptions being the United States (with a high religiosity level) and &quot;theistic&quot; Portugal. In a response, Gary Jensen builds on and refines Paul&#x27;s study. he concludes that a &quot;complex relationship&quot; exists between religiosity and homicide &quot;with some dimensions of religiosity encouraging homicide and other dimensions discouraging it&quot;. In April 2012, the results of a study which tested their subjects&#x27; pro-social sentiments were published in the &quot;Social Psychological and Personality Science&quot; journal in which non-religious people had higher scores showing that they were more motivated by their own compassion to perform pro-social behaviors. Religious people were found to be less motivated by compassion to be charitable than by an inner sense of moral obligation.

==Notes==

:a. Studies on divorce in the United States done by the Barna Group suggested that atheists and agnostics have lower divorce rates than faith groups on average (though some faith groups had lower rates still). The study notes that fewer atheists and agnostics enter into marriage relative to faith-based individuals.
:b. Some studies appear to show positive links in the relationship between religiosity and moral behavior Modern research in criminology also suggests an inverse relationship between religion and crime, with some studies establishing this connection. A meta-analysis of 60 studies on religion and crime concluded, &quot;religious behaviors and beliefs exert a moderate deterrent effect on individuals&#x27; criminal behavior&quot;.
:c. Zuckerman identifies that Scandinavians have &quot;relatively high rates of petty crime and burglary&quot;, but &quot;their overall rates of violent crime—such as murder, aggravated assault, and rape—are among the lowest on earth&quot; (Zuckerman 2008, pp. 5–6).
:d. The authors also state that &quot;A few hundred years ago rates of homicide were astronomical in Christian Europe and the American colonies,&quot; and &quot;the least theistic secular developing democracies such as Japan, France, and Scandinavia have been most successful in these regards.&quot; They argue for a positive correlation between the degree of public religiosity in a society and certain measures of dysfunction, an analysis published later in the same journal argues that a number of methodological problems undermine any findings or conclusions in the research.
:e. Blackburn provides examples such as the phrase in Exodus 22:18 that has &quot;helped to burn alive tens or hundreds of thousands of women in Europe and America&quot;: &quot;Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live,&quot; and notes that the Old Testament God apparently has &quot;no problems with a slave-owning society&quot;, considers birth control a crime punishable by death, and &quot;is keen on child abuse&quot;. Others interpret these passages differently, arguing for example that Jewish laws show the evolution of moral standards in society: that Jews actually threatened those who pursued forced slavery with the death penalty, held that slaves were persons instead of property, and protected them in several ways.

<text>The Pony Express was an American express mail service that used relays of horse-mounted riders between Missouri and California. It was operated by the Central Overland California and Pikes Peak Express Company.

During its 18 months of operation beginning in 1860, the Pony Express reduced the time for messages to travel between the east and west US coast to about 10 days. It became the west&#x27;s most direct means of eastwest communication before the first transcontinental telegraph was established (October 24, 1861), and was vital for tying the new state of California with the rest of the United States.

Despite a heavy subsidy, the Pony Express was not a financial success and went bankrupt in 18 months, when a faster telegraph service was established. Nevertheless, it demonstrated that a unified transcontinental system of communications could be established and operated year-round. When replaced by the telegraph, the Pony Express quickly became romanticized and became part of the lore of the Old West. Its reliance on the ability and endurance of hardy riders and fast horses was seen as evidence of rugged American individualism of the frontier times.

==Inception and founding==
The idea of having a fast mail route to the Pacific Coast was prompted largely by California&#x27;s newfound prominence and its rapidly growing population. After gold was discovered there in 1848, thousands of prospectors, investors, and businessmen made their way to California, at that time a new territory of the U.S. By 1850, California entered the Union as a free state. By 1860, the population had grown to 380,000. The prospect of California and its national role became the source of bitter partisan debate in Congress. The demand for a faster way to get the mail and other communications to and from this westernmost state became even greater as the American Civil War approached.

William Russell, Alexander Majors, and William B. Waddell were the three founders of the Pony Express. They were already in the freighting and drayage business. At the peak of the operations, they employed 6,000 men, owned 75,000 oxen, thousands of wagons, and warehouses, plus a sawmill, a meatpacking plant, a bank, and an insurance company.

Russell was a prominent businessman, well respected among his peers and the community. Waddell was co-owner of the firm Morehead, Waddell &amp; Co. In 1859, C. R. Morehead took the proposal for the Pony Express to President Buchanan. After Morehead was bought out and moved to Leavenworth to enter the mercantile business, Waddell merged his company with Russell&#x27;s, changing the name to Waddell &amp; Russell. In 1855, they took on a new partner, Alexander Majors, and founded the company of Russell, Majors &amp; Waddell. They held government contracts for delivering army supplies to the western frontier, and Russell had a similar idea for contracts with the U.S. government for fast mail delivery.

By using a short route and mounted riders rather than traditional stagecoaches, they proposed to establish a fast mail service between St. Joseph, Missouri, and Sacramento, California, with letters delivered in 10 days, which many said was impossible. The initial price was set at $5 per , then $2.50, and by July 1861 to $1. The initial price was 250 times the price of mail through the normal mail service, which was $0.02. The founders of the Pony Express hoped to win an exclusive government mail contract, but that did not come about.

Russell, Majors, and Waddell organized and put together the Pony Express in two months in the winter of 1860. The undertaking assembled 80 riders, 184 stations, 400 horses, and several hundred personnel during January and February 1861.

Majors was a religious man and resolved &quot;by the help of God&quot; to overcome all difficulties. He presented each rider with a Pony Express special-edition Bible and required this oath, which they were also required to sign.

==Operation==

In 1860, the roughly 186 Pony Express stations were about apart along the Pony Express route. At each station, the express rider would change to a fresh horse, get a bite to eat, and would only take the mail pouch called a &quot;mochila&quot; (from the Spanish for pouch or backpack) with him.

The employers stressed the importance of the pouch. They often said that, if it came to be, the horse and rider should perish before the &quot;mochila&quot; did. The &quot;mochila&quot; was thrown over the saddle and held in place by the weight of the rider sitting on it. Each corner had a &quot;cantina,&quot; or pocket. Bundles of mail were placed in these &quot;cantinas&quot;, which were padlocked for safety. The&quot; mochila&quot; could hold of mail along with the of material carried on the horse. Eventually, everything except one revolver and a water sack was removed, allowing for a total of on the horse&#x27;s back. Riders, who could not weigh over , changed about every , and rode day and night. In emergencies, a given rider might ride two stages back to back, over 20 hours on a quickly moving horse.

Whether riders tried crossing the Sierra Nevada in winter is unknown, but they certainly crossed central Nevada. By 1860, a telegraph station was in Carson City, Nevada Territory. The riders received $125 a month as pay. As a comparison, the wage for unskilled labor at the time was about $0.43–1.00 per day, and for semi-skilled laborers like bricklayers and carpenters was usually less than $2 per day.

Alexander Majors, one of the founders of the Pony Express, had acquired more than 400 horses for the project. He selected horses from around the west, paying an average of $200. These averaged about high and each; thus, the name pony was appropriate, even if not strictly correct in all cases.
==Pony Express route==

Beginning at St. Joseph, Missouri, the approximately route roughly followed the Oregon and California trails to Fort Bridger in Wyoming, and then the Mormon Trail (known as the Hastings Cutoff) to Salt Lake City, Utah. From there, it followed the Central Nevada Route to Carson City, Nevada Territory, before passing over the Sierra and reaching to Sacramento, California. From there mail was transferred to boats to go downriver to San Francisco or, on occasion, via a combination of riders and ferries to the destination.

The route started at St. Joseph, Missouri, on the Missouri River, and then followed what is modern-day U.S. Highway 36 (the Pony Express Highway) to Marysville, Kansas, where it turned northwest following Little Blue River to Fort Kearny in Nebraska. Through Nebraska, it followed the Great Platte River Road, cutting through Gothenburg, Nebraska, clipping the edge of Colorado at Julesburg; and passing Courthouse Rock, Chimney Rock, and Scotts Bluff, before arriving first at Fort Laramie and then Fort Caspar (Platte Bridge Station) in Wyoming. From there, it followed the Sweetwater River, passing Independence Rock, Devil&#x27;s Gate, and Split Rock, through South Pass to Fort Bridger and then south to Salt Lake City, Utah. From Salt Lake City, it generally followed the Central Nevada Route blazed in 1859 by Captain James H. Simpson of the Corps of Topographical Engineers. This route roughly follows today&#x27;s US 50 across Nevada and Utah. It crossed the Great Basin, the Utah-Nevada Desert, and the Sierra Nevada near Lake Tahoe before arriving in Sacramento. Mail was transferred and sent by steamer down the Sacramento River to San Francisco. An alternative overland route was used for the first month and whenever the steamer departure was missed. The alternative route, roughly following first today&#x27;s Interstate 80, then Interstate 680, then California Route 24, took the mail by horseback through Benicia, California. This route would then cross the Carquinez Strait via ferry to Martinez, then on horseback onward to Oakland and across the San Francisco Bay by ferry to San Francisco.

===Stations===
Along the long and arduous route used by the Pony Express, 190 stations were used. The stations and station keepers were essential to the successful, timely, and smooth operation of the Pony Express mail system. The stations were often fashioned out of existing structures, several of them located in military forts, while others were built anew in remote areas where living conditions were basic. The route was divided into five divisions. To maintain the rigid schedule, 157 relay stations were located from apart, as the terrain would allow. At each &quot;swing station&quot;, riders would exchange their tired mounts for fresh ones, while &quot;home stations&quot; provided room and board for the riders between runs. This technique allowed the mail to be moved across the continent in record time. Each rider rode about per day.

==First journeys==

===Westbound===
The first westbound Pony Express trip left St. Joseph on April 3, 1860, and arrived 10 days later in Sacramento, California, on April 14. These letters were sent under cover from the east to St. Joseph, and never directly entered the U.S. mail system. Today, only a single letter is known to exist from the inaugural westbound trip from St. Joseph to Sacramento. It was delivered in an envelope embossed with postage (depicted below) that was first issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1855.

The messenger delivering the &quot;mochila&quot; from New York and Washington, DC, missed a connection in Detroit and arrived in Hannibal, Missouri, two hours late. The railroad cleared the track and dispatched a special locomotive called &quot;Missouri&quot; with a one-car train to make the trek across Missouri in a record 4 hours and 51 minutes, an average of . It arrived at Olive and 8th Street, a few blocks from the company&#x27;s new headquarters in a hotel at Patee House at 12th and Penn Street, St. Joseph, and the company&#x27;s nearby stables on Penn Street. The first pouch contained 49 letters, five private telegrams, and some papers for San Francisco and intermediate points.

St. Joseph Mayor M. Jeff Thompson, William H. Russell, and Alexander Majors gave speeches before the &quot;mochila&quot; was handed off. The ride began at about 7:15 pm. The &quot;St. Joseph Gazette&quot; was the only newspaper included in the bag.

The identity of the first rider has long been in dispute. The St. Joseph &quot;Weekly West&quot; (April 4, 1860) reported Johnson William Richardson was the first rider.
Johnny Fry is credited in some sources as the rider. Nonetheless, the first westbound rider carried the pouch across the Missouri River ferry to Elwood, Kansas. The first horse-ridden leg of the Express was only about from the Express stables/railroad area to the Missouri River ferry at the foot of Jules Street. Reports indicated that horse and rider crossed the river. In later rides, the courier crossed the river without a horse and picked up his mount at a stable on the other side.

The first westbound &quot;mochila&quot; reached Sacramento, on April 14, at 1:00 am.

===Eastbound===
The first eastbound Pony Express trip left Sacramento on April 3, 1860, and arrived at its destination 10 days later in St. Joseph, Missouri. From St. Joseph, letters were placed in the U.S. mails for delivery to eastern destinations. Only two letters are known to exist from the inaugural eastbound trip.

==Mail==

As the Pony Express mail service existed only briefly in 1860 and 1861, few examples of Pony Express mail survive. Contributing to the scarcity of Pony Express mail is that the cost to send a letter was $5.00 at the beginning (, or 2 days of semi-skilled labor). By the end of the Pony Express, the price had dropped to $1.00 per ounce but even that was considered expensive to mail one letter. Only 250 known examples of Pony Express mail remain.

===Postmarks===

Various postmarks were added to the mail to be carried by the Pony Express at the point of departure.
==Fastest mail service==
William Russell, senior partner of Russell, Majors, and Waddell, and one of the biggest investors in the Pony Express, used the 1860 presidential election, of Abraham Lincoln, as a way to promote the Pony Express and how fast it could deliver the U.S. Mail. This was an important event because just four years earlier, in the prior election, it took months to get news of James Buchanan&#x27;s win. The election of Lincoln was important because the newly-named president would have to take the country into the Civil War. Prior to the election, Russell hired extra riders to ensure that fresh riders and relay horses were available along the route. On November 7, 1860, a Pony Express rider departed Fort Kearny, Nebraska Territory (the end of the eastern telegraph line) with the election results. Riders briskly traversed the route, over snow-covered trails to Fort Churchill, Nevada Territory (the end of the western telegraph line). California&#x27;s newspapers received word of Lincoln&#x27;s election only 7 days and 17 hours after the East Coast papers, an &quot;unrivaled feat at the time&quot;.

==Attacks==
The Paiute War was a minor series of raids and ambushes initiated by American expansion into the territory of the Paiute Indian tribe in Nevada, which resulted in the disruption of mail services of the Pony Express. It took place from May through June 1860, though sporadic violence continued for a period afterward.
In the brief history of the Pony Express, only once did the mail not go through. After completing eight weekly trips from both Sacramento and Saint Joseph, the Pony Express was forced to suspend mail services because of the outbreak of the Paiute Indian War in May 1860.

About 6,000 Paiutes in Nevada had suffered during a winter of fierce blizzards that year. By spring, the whole tribe was ready to embark on a war, except for the Paiute chief named Numaga. For three days, Numaga fasted and argued for peace.
Meanwhile, a raiding party attacked Williams Station, a Pony Express station located on the then Carson River under present-day Lake Lahontan (reservoir), not to be confused with the large endorheic Pleistocene lake of the same name (Lake Lahontan). One account says the raid was a deliberate attempt to provoke war. Another says the raiders had heard that men at the station had kidnapped two Paiute women, and fighting broke out when they went to investigate and free the women. Either way, the war party killed five men and the station was burned.

During the following weeks, other isolated incidents occurred when whites in the Paiute country were ambushed and killed. The Pony Express was a special target. Seven other express stations were also attacked; 16 employees were killed, and around 150 express horses were either stolen or driven off. Those who worked at the stations had no one around, possibly for miles, to help defend against the attacks, making working at the stations one of the deadliest jobs in the whole operation. The Paiute War cost the Pony Express company about $75,000 in livestock and station equipment, not to mention the loss of life. In June of that year, the Paiute uprising had been ended through the intervention of U.S. troops, after which four delayed mail shipments from the East were finally brought to San Francisco on June 25, 1860.

During this brief war, one Pony Express mailing, which left San Francisco on July 21, 1860, did not immediately reach its destination. That mail pouch (&quot;mochila&quot;) did not reach St. Joseph and subsequently New York until almost two years later.

==Famous riders==

In 1860, riding for the Pony Express was difficult work – riders had to be tough and lightweight. An advertisement allegedly read, &quot;Wanted: Young, skinny, wiry fellows not over eighteen. Must be expert riders, willing to risk death daily. Orphans preferred,&quot; but one historian, Joseph Nardone, claims that it is a hoax (dating no earlier than 1902), as no one has found the ad in contemporary newspaper archives.

The Pony Express had an estimated 80 riders traveling east or west along the route at any given time. In addition, about 400 other employees were used, including station keepers, stock tenders, and route superintendents. Many young men applied; Waddell and Majors could have easily hired riders at low rates, but instead offered $100 a montha handsome sum for that time. Author Mark Twain described the riders in his travel memoir &quot;Roughing It&quot; as: &quot;... usually a little bit of a man&quot;. Though the riders were small, lightweight, generally teenaged boys, they came to be seen as heroes of the American West. There was no systematic list of riders kept by the company, but a partial list has been compiled by Raymond and Nancy Settle in their &quot;Saddles &amp; Spurs&quot; (1972).

James Butler &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Hickok never worked as a rider and only worked as a stocktender for the Pony Express.

===First riders===
The identity of the first westbound rider to depart St. Joseph has been disputed, but currently most historians have narrowed it down to either Johnny Fry or Billy Richardson. Both Expressmen were hired at St. Joseph for A. E. Lewis&#x27; Division, which ran from St. Joseph to Seneca, Kansas, a distance of . They covered at an average speed of , including all stops. Before the mail pouch was delivered to the first rider on April 3, 1860, time was taken out for ceremonies and several speeches. First, Mayor M. Jeff Thompson gave a brief speech on the significance of the event for St. Joseph. Then William H. Russell and Alexander Majors addressed the gala crowd about how the Pony Express was just a &quot;precursor&quot; to the construction of a transcontinental railroad. At the conclusion of all the speeches, around 7:15 pm, Russell turned the mail pouch over to the first rider. A cannon fired, the large assembled crowd cheered, and the rider dashed to the landing at the foot of Jules Street, where the ferry boat &quot;Denver&quot;, under a full head of steam, alerted by the signal cannon, waited to carry the horse and rider across the Missouri River to Elwood, Kansas Territory. On April 9 at 6:45 pm, the first rider from the east reached Salt Lake City, Utah. Then, on April 12, the mail pouch reached Carson City, Nevada Territory, at 2:30 pm. The riders raced over the Sierra Nevada, through Placerville, California, and on to Sacramento. Around midnight on April 14, 1860, the first mail pouch was delivered by the Pony Express to San Francisco. With it was a letter of congratulations from President Buchanan to California Governor Downey along with other official government communications, newspapers from New York, Chicago, and St. Louis, and other important mail to banks and commercial houses in San Francisco. In all, 85 pieces of mail were delivered on this first trip.

James Randall is credited as &quot;the first eastbound rider&quot; from the San Francisco Alta telegraph office, since he was on the steamship &quot;Antelope&quot; to go to Sacramento. Mail for the Pony Express left San Francisco at 4:00 pm, carried by horse and rider to the waterfront, and then on by steamboat to Sacramento, where it was picked up by the Pony Express rider. At 2:45 am, William (Sam) Hamilton was the first Pony Express rider to begin the journey from Sacramento. He rode all the way to Sportsman Hall Station, where he gave his &quot;mochila &quot;filled with mail to Warren Upson. A California Registered Historical Landmark plaque at the site reads:

===William Cody===

Probably more than any other rider in the Pony Express, William Cody (better known as Buffalo Bill) epitomizes the legend and the folklore, be it fact or fiction, of the Pony Express. Numerous stories have been told of young Cody&#x27;s adventures as a Pony Express rider, though his accounts may have been fabricated or exaggerated. At age 15, Cody was on his way west to California when he met Pony Express agents along the way and signed on with the company. Cody helped in the construction of several way-stations. Thereafter, he was employed as a rider and was given a short delivery run from the township of Julesburg, which lay to the west. After some months, he was transferred to Slade&#x27;s Division in Wyoming, where he is said to have made the longest nonstop ride from Red Buttes Station to Rocky Ridge Station and back when he found that his relief rider had been killed. This trail of was completed in 21 hours and 40 minutes, and 21 horses were required. On one occasion when he is said to have carried mail, he unintentionally ran into an Indian war party, but managed to escape. Cody was present for many significant chapters in early western history, including the gold rush, the building of the railroads, and cattle herding on the Great Plains. A career as a scout for the Army under General Phillip Sheridan following the Civil War earned him his nickname and established his notoriety as a frontiersman.

===Robert Haslam===

&quot;Pony Bob&quot; Haslam was among the most brave, resourceful, and best-known riders of the Pony Express. He was born in January 1840 in London, United Kingdom, and came to the United States as a teenager. Haslam was hired by Bolivar Roberts, helped build the stations, and was given the mail run from Friday&#x27;s Station at Lake Tahoe to Buckland&#x27;s Station near Fort Churchill, to the east.

His greatest ride, in 8 hours and 20 minutes while wounded, was an important contribution to the fastest trip ever made by the Pony Express. The mail carried Lincoln&#x27;s inaugural address. Indian problems in 1860 led to Haslam&#x27;s record-breaking ride. He had received the eastbound mail (probably the May 10 mail from San Francisco) at Friday&#x27;s Station. When he reached Buckland&#x27;s Station, his relief rider was so badly frightened over the Indian threat that he refused to take the mail. Haslam agreed to take the mail all the way to Smith&#x27;s Creek for a total distance of without a rest. After a rest of 9 hours, he retraced his route with the westbound mail, where at Cold Springs, he found that Indians had raided the place, killing the station keeper and running off all of the stock. On the ride, he was shot through the jaw with an Indian arrow, losing three teeth.
Finally, he reached Buckland&#x27;s Station, making the round trip the longest on record.

Pony Bob continued to work as a rider for Wells Fargo and Company after the Civil War, scouted for the U.S. Army well into his 50s, and later accompanied his good friend &quot;Buffalo Bill&quot; Cody on a diplomatic mission to negotiate the surrender of Chief Sitting Bull in December 1890. He drifted in and out of public mention, but died in Chicago during the winter of 1912 (age 72) in deep poverty after suffering a stroke. Buffalo Bill paid for his friend&#x27;s headstone at Mount Greenwood Cemetery (111 Street and Sacramento) on Chicago&#x27;s far south side.

===Jack Keetley===

Jack Keetley was hired by A. E. Lewis for his division at the age of 19 and put on the run from Marysville to Big Sandy. He was one of those who rode for the Pony Express during the entire 19 months of its existence.

Jack Keetley&#x27;s longest ride, upon which he doubled back for another rider, ended at Seneca, where he was taken from the saddle sound asleep. He had ridden in 31 hours without stopping to rest or eat. After the Pony Express was disbanded, Keetley went to Salt Lake City, where he engaged in mining. He died there on October 12, 1912, where he was also buried.

In 1907, Keetley wrote the following letter (excerpt):

===Billy Tate===
Billy Tate was a 14-year-old Pony Express rider who rode the express trail in Nevada near Ruby Valley. During the Paiute uprising of 1860, he was chased by a band of Paiute Indians on horseback and was forced to retreat into the hills behind some big rocks, where he killed seven of his assailants in a shoot-out before being killed himself. His body was found riddled with arrows, but was not scalped, a sign that the Paiutes honored their enemy.
=== Major Howard Egan ===
Egan emigrated to the United States from Ireland with his parents in the early 1830s. While living in Massachusetts, he joined the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (also known as &quot;Mormons&quot;). He was with the Pioneer Party of 1847 that journeyed to the west to modern day Salt Lake City, Utah. At the start of the Pony Express, he was appointed Superintendent of the Division from Salt Lake City to Robert&#x27;s Creek which is in present day Nevada. Egan filled in when others couldn&#x27;t ride. After the Pony Express, he ranched and became involved with the court system in Utah.

==Horses==
At the west end of the Pony Express route in California, W.W. Finney purchased 100 head of short-coupled stock called &quot;California horses&quot;, while A.B. Miller purchased another 200 native ponies in and around the Great Salt Lake Valley. The horses were ridden quickly between stations, a distance of . They were then relieved, and a fresh horse was exchanged for the one that just arrived from its strenuous run.

During his route of , a Pony Express rider would change horses 8 to 10 times. The horses were ridden at a fast canter of around and at times they were driven to full gallop at speeds up to . Horses of the Pony Express were purchased in Missouri, Iowa, California, and some western U.S. territories.

The types of horses ridden by riders of the Pony Express included Morgans and thoroughbreds, which were often used on the eastern end of the trail. Mustangs were often used on the western (more rugged) end of the mail route.

==Saddle==

In 1844, years before the Pony Express came to St. Joseph, Israel Landis opened a small saddle and harness shop there. His business expanded as the town grew, and when the Pony Express came to town, Landis was the ideal candidate to produce saddles for the newly founded Pony Express. Because Pony Express riders rode their horses at a quick pace over a distance of or more between stations, every consideration was made to reduce the overall weight the horse had to carry. To help reduce this load, special lightweight saddles were designed and crafted. Using less leather and fewer metallic and wood components, they fashioned a saddle that was similar in design to the regular stock saddle generally in use in the West at that time.

The mail pouch was a separate component to the saddle that made the Pony Express unique. Standard mail pouches for horses were never used because of their size and shape, as detaching and attaching it from one saddle to the other was time-consuming, causing undue delay in changing mounts. With many stops to make, the delayed time at each station would accumulate to appreciable proportions. To get around this difficulty, a &quot;mochila&quot; (a covering of leather) was thrown over the saddle. The saddle horn and cantle projected through holes that were specially cut to size in the &quot;mochila&quot;. Attached to the broad leather skirt of the &quot;mochila&quot; were four &quot;cantinas&quot;, or box-shaped hard leather compartments, where letters were carried on the journey.

==Closing==
During its brief time in operation, the Pony Express delivered about 35,000 letters between St. Joseph and Sacramento. Although the Pony Express proved that the central/northern mail route was viable, Russell, Majors, and Waddell did not get the contract to deliver mail over the route. The contract was instead awarded to Jeremy Dehut in March 1861, who had taken over the southern, congressionally favored Butterfield Overland Mail Stage Line. The so-called &quot;Stagecoach King&quot;, Ben Holladay, acquired the Russell, Majors, and Waddell stations for his stagecoaches.

Shortly after the contract was awarded, the start of the American Civil War caused the stage line to cease operation. From March 1861, the Pony Express ran mail only between Salt Lake City and Sacramento. The Pony Express announced its closure on October 26, 1861, two days after the transcontinental telegraph reached Salt Lake City and connected Omaha, Nebraska, and Sacramento. Other telegraph lines connected points along the line and other cities on the east and west coasts.

Despite the subsidy, the Pony Express was a financial failure. It grossed $90,000 and lost $200,000.

In 1866, after the Civil War was over, Holladay sold the Pony Express assets along with the remnants of the Butterfield Stage to Wells Fargo for $1.5 million.

==Legacy==

=== Postage stamps ===
In 1869, the United States Post Office issued the first U.S. postage stamp to depict an actual historic event, and the subject chosen was the Pony Express. Until then, only the faces of George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and Andrew Jackson were found on the face of U.S. postage. Sometimes mistaken for an actual stamp used by the Pony Express, the &quot;Pony Express Stamp&quot; issue was released in 1869 (8 years after the Pony Express service had ended) to honor the men who rode the long and sometimes dangerous journeys and to commemorate the service they provided for the nation. In 1940 and 1960, commemorative stamps were issued for the 80th and 100th anniversaries of the Pony Express, respectively.
===Historical research===
The foundation of accountable Pony Express history rests in the few tangible areas where records, papers, letters, and mailings have yielded the most historical evidence. Until the 1950s, most of what was known about the short-lived Pony Express was the product of a few accounts, hearsay, and folklore, generally true in their overall aspects, but lacking in verification in many areas for those who wanted to explore the history surrounding the founders, the various riders, and station keepers, or who were interested in stations or forts along the Pony Express route.

The most complete books on the Pony Express are &quot;The Story of the Pony Express&quot; by Raymond and Mary Settle and &quot;Saddles and Spurs&quot; by Roy Bloss. Settle&#x27;s account is unique, as he was the first writer and historical researcher to make use of Pony Express founder William B. Waddell&#x27;s papers, now in a collection at the Huntington Library in San Marino, California. Mr. Settle wrote in the mid-1950s. Mr. Bloss was a writer for the Pony Express Centennial. While Settle&#x27;s work was published generally without his annotations and notes, the writer&#x27;s background here is unique and Settle does have an excellent bibliography. When Settle prepared to publish his well-researched account, he had a good volume of footnotes, citations prepared, but the editors chose not to use most of them. Instead, they opted for a less expensive approach to print and publish and released an accurate, but simplified account. Settle was not pleased with this new and sudden development, as he put much time and effort into the annotations. Yet, the account Settle wrote was and is a definitive one and is considered the best account on the history of the Pony Express among many historians.

=== National Historic Trail ===
The Pony Express route was designated the Pony Express National Historic Trail August 3, 1992, by an act of Congress. Its route goes through eight states and includes substantial sections of land managed by the Bureau of Land Management in California, Colorado, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming.

The public can auto-tour the route, visit interpretive sites and museums, and hike, bike, or horseback ride various trail segments. Sites open to public visitation along the trail include the Sand Mountain Recreation Area in Nevada; automobile access to a backcountry byway (the Pony Express Trail National Back Country Byway) along the route itself, Boyd Station and Simpson Springs Campground in Utah; and the Little Sandy Crossing in Wyoming. In total, approximately 120 historic sites along the trail may eventually be open to the public, including 50 stations or station ruins.

The National Pony Express Association is a nonprofit, volunteer-led historical organization. Its purpose is to preserve the original Pony Express trail and to continue the memory and importance of Pony Express in American history in partnership with the National Park Service, Pony Express Trail Association, and Oregon-California Trails Association.

===Other commemorations===

From 1866 until 1889, the Pony Express logo was used by stagecoach and freight company Wells Fargo, which provided secure mail service. Wells Fargo used the Pony Express logo for its guard and armored-car services. The logo continued to be used when other companies took over the security business into the 1990s. Since 2001, the Pony Express logo is no longer used for security businesses, since the business has been sold.

In June 2006, the United States Postal Service announced it had trademarked &quot;Pony Express&quot; along with &quot;Air Mail&quot;.
April 3, 2010 was the Pony Express&#x27;s 150th anniversary. Located in St. Joseph, Missouri, the Patee House Museum, which was the Pony Express&#x27;s headquarters, hosted events celebrating the anniversary.

On April 14, 2015, Google released a playable doodle game celebrating their 155th anniversary.

==In popular culture==
The continued remembrance and popularity of the Pony Express can be linked to Buffalo Bill Cody, his autobiographies, and his Wild West Show. The first book dedicated solely to the Pony Express was not published until 1900. However, in his first autobiography, published in 1879, Cody claims to have been an Express rider. While this claim has recently come under dispute, his show became the &quot;primary keeper of the pony legend&quot; when it premiered as a scene in the Wild West Show.

<doc id="43266" wikidata="Q835439" url="?curid=43266" title="Great Awakening">
<text>The Great Awakening was a series of religious revivals in American Christian history. Historians and theologians identify three, or sometimes four, waves of increased religious enthusiasm between the early 18th century and the late 20th century. Each of these &quot;Great Awakenings&quot; was characterized by widespread revivals led by evangelical Protestant ministers, a sharp increase of interest in religion, a profound sense of conviction and redemption on the part of those affected, an increase in evangelical church membership, and the formation of new religious movements and denominations.

George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, and Gilbert Tennent were influential during the First Great Awakening. Some of the influential groups during the Great Awakening were the New Lights and the Old Lights. 
The First Great Awakening in the American colonies is closely related to the Evangelical Revival in the British Isles.

Pulling away from ritual and ceremony, the Great Awakening made religion more personal by fostering a sense of spiritual conviction of personal sin and need for redemption, and by encouraging introspection and a commitment to personal morality. It incited rancor and division between traditionalists, who insisted on the continuing importance of ritual and doctrine, and revivalists who encouraged emotional involvement and personal commitment. It had a major impact in reshaping the Congregational church, the Presbyterian church, the Dutch Reformed Church, and the German Reformed denomination, and strengthened the small Baptist and Methodist denominations. It had less impact on Anglicans and Quakers. Unlike the Second Great Awakening, which began about 1800 and reached out to the unchurched, the First Great Awakening focused on those who were already church members. It changed their rituals, their piety, and their self-awareness.

== First Great Awakening ==

The First Great Awakening began in the 1730s and lasted to about 1740, though pockets of revivalism had occurred in years prior, especially amongst the ministry of Solomon Stoddard, Jonathan Edwards&#x27;s grandfather. Edwards&#x27;s congregation was involved in a revival later called the &quot;Frontier Revivals&quot; in the mid-1730s, though this was on the wane by 1737. But as American religious historian Sydney E. Ahlstrom noted, the Great Awakening &quot;was still to come, ushered in by the Grand Itinerant&quot;, the British evangelist George Whitefield. Whitefield arrived in Georgia in 1738 and returned in 1739 for a second visit of the Colonies, making a &quot;triumphant campaign north from Philadelphia to New York, and back to the South&quot;. In 1740, he visited New England, and &quot;at every place he visited, the consequences were large and tumultuous&quot;. Ministers from various evangelical Protestant denominations supported the Great Awakening. In the middle colonies, he influenced not only the British churches, but the Dutch and German.

Additionally, pastoral styles began to change. In the late colonial period, most pastors read their sermons, which were theologically dense and advanced a particular theological argument or interpretation. Nathan O. Hatch argues that the evangelical movement of the 1740s played a key role in the development of democratic thought, as well as the belief of the free press and the belief that information should be shared and completely unbiased and uncontrolled. Michał Choiński argues that the First Great Awakening marks the birth of the American &quot;rhetoric of the revival&quot; understood as &quot;a particular mode of preaching in which the speaker employs and it has a really wide array of patterns and communicative strategies to initiate religious conversions and spiritual regeneration among the hearers&quot;. All these theological, social, and rhetorical notions ushered in the period of the American Revolution. This contributed to create a demand for religious freedom. The Great Awakening represented the first time African Americans embraced Christianity in large numbers.

In the later part of the 1700s, the Revival came to the English colonies of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island primarily through the efforts of Henry Alline and his New Light movement.

==Second Great Awakening==
The Second Great Awakening (sometimes known simply as &quot;the Great Awakening&quot;) was a religious revival that occurred in the United States beginning in the late eighteenth century and lasting until the middle of the nineteenth century. While it occurred in all parts of the United States, it was especially strong in the Northeast and the Midwest. This awakening was unique in that it moved beyond the educated elite of New England to those who were less wealthy and less educated. The center of revivalism was the so-called Burned-over district in western New York. Named for its overabundance of hellfire-and-damnation preaching, the region produced dozens of new denominations, communal societies, and reform.

Among these dozens of new denominations were free black churches, run independently of existing congregations that were predominantly of white attendance. During the period between the American revolution and the 1850s, black involvement in largely white churches declined in great numbers, with participation becoming almost non-existent by the 1840s–1850s; some scholars argue that this was largely due to racial discrimination within the church. This discrimination came in the form of segregated seating and the forbiddance of African Americans from voting in church matters or holding leadership positions in many white churches. Reverend Richard Allen, a central founder of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, was quoted describing one such incident of racial discrimination in a predominantly white church in Philadelphia, in which fellow preacher and a former slave from Delaware, Absalom Jones, was grabbed by a white church trustee in the midst of prayer and forcefully told to leave.

Closely related to the Second Great Awakening were other reform movements such as temperance, abolition, and women&#x27;s rights. The temperance movement encouraged people to abstain from consuming alcoholic drinks in order to preserve family order. The abolition movement fought to abolish slavery in the United States. The women&#x27;s rights movement grew from female abolitionists who realized that they could fight for their own political rights, too. In addition to these causes, reforms touched nearly every aspect of daily life, such as restricting the use of tobacco and dietary and dress reforms. The abolition movement emerged in the North from the wider Second Great Awakening 1800–1840.

== Third Great Awakening ==
The Third Great Awakening in the 1850s–1900s was characterized by new denominations, active missionary work, Chautauquas, and the Social Gospel approach to social issues. The YMCA (founded in 1844) played a major role in fostering revivals in the cities in the 1858 Awakening and after. The revival of 1858 produced leaders such as Dwight L. Moody who carried out religious work in the Civil War armies. The Christian and Sanitary Commissions and numerous Freedmen&#x27;s Societies were also formed during the war.

==Fourth Great Awakening==
The Fourth Great Awakening is a debated concept that has not received the acceptance of the first three. Advocates such as economist Robert Fogel say it happened in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The Jesus Movement is cited as evidence of this awakening, and it created a shift in church music styles.

Mainline Protestant denominations weakened sharply in both membership and influence while the most conservative religious denominations (such as the Southern Baptists) grew rapidly in numbers, spread across the United States, had grave internal theological battles and schisms, and became politically powerful.

== Terminology ==
The idea of an &quot;awakening&quot; implies a slumber or passivity during secular or less religious times. Awakening is a term which originates from, and is embraced often and primarily by, evangelical Christians. In recent times, the idea of &quot;awakenings&quot; in United States history has been put forth by conservative American evangelicals.

In the late 2010s and 2020s the term &quot;Great Awakening&quot; has been used by promoters of the QAnon conspiracy theory to denote awareness of their theory.

In 2018, the British political commentator Andrew Sullivan described the &quot;Great Awokening&quot;, describing it as a &quot;cult of social justice on the left, a religion whose followers show the same zeal as any born-again Evangelical [Christian]&quot; and who &quot;punish heresy by banishing sinners from society or coercing them to public demonstrations of shame&quot;. In 2024, &quot;The Third Awokening&quot; was used as the title of a book by Professor Eric Kaufmann on the same subject.

<text>The Second Great Awakening was a Protestant religious revival during the late 18th to early 19th century in the United States. It spread religion through revivals and emotional preaching and sparked a number of reform movements. Revivals were a key part of the movement and attracted hundreds of converts to new Protestant denominations. The Methodist Church used circuit riders to reach people in frontier locations.

The Second Great Awakening led to a period of social reform and an emphasis on salvation by institutions. The outpouring of religious fervor and revival began in Kentucky and Tennessee in the 1790s and early 1800s among the Presbyterians, Methodists, and Baptists. New religious movements emerged during the Second Great Awakening, such as Adventism, Dispensationalism, and the Latter Day Saint movement. The Second Great Awakening also led to the founding of several well-known colleges, seminaries, and mission societies.

Historians named the Second Great Awakening in the context of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1750s and of the Third Great Awakening of the late 1850s to early 1900s. The First Awakening was part of a much larger evangelical religious movement that was sweeping across England, Scotland, and Germany.

==Spread of revivals==
===Background===
Like the First Great Awakening a half century earlier, the Second Great Awakening in North America reflected Romanticism characterized by enthusiasm, emotion, and an appeal to the supernatural. It rejected the skepticism, deism, Unitarianism, and rationalism left over from the American Enlightenment, about the same time that similar movements flourished in Europe. Pietism was sweeping Germanic countries and evangelicalism was waxing strong in England.

The Second Great Awakening occurred in several episodes and over different denominations; however, the revivals were very similar. As the most effective form of evangelizing during this period, revival meetings cut across geographical boundaries. The movement quickly spread throughout Kentucky, Indiana, Tennessee, and southern Ohio, as well as other regions of the United States and Canada. Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on itinerant ministers, known as circuit riders, who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert.

===Theology===

Postmillennialist theology dominated American Protestantism in the first half of the 19th century. Postmillennialists believed that Christ will return to earth after the &quot;Millennium&quot;, which could entail either a literal 1,000 years or a figurative &quot;long period&quot; of peace and happiness. Christians thus had a duty to purify society in preparation for that return. This duty extended beyond American borders to include Christian Restorationism. George Fredrickson argues that Postmillennial theology &quot;was an impetus to the promotion of Progressive reforms, as historians have frequently pointed out.&quot; During the Second Great Awakening of the 1830s, some diviners expected the Millennium to arrive in a few years. By the late 1840s, however, the great day had receded to the distant future, and postmillennialism became a more passive religious dimension of the wider middle-class pursuit of reform and progress.

===Burned-over district===

Beginning in the 1820s, Western New York State experienced a series of popular religious revivals that would later earn this region the nickname &quot;the burned-over district,&quot; which implied the area was set ablaze with spiritual fervor. This term, however, was not used by contemporaries in the first half of the nineteenth century, as it originates from Charles Grandison Finney&#x27;s &quot;Autobiography of Charles G Finney&quot; (1876), in which he writes, &quot;I found that region of country what, in the western phrase, would be called, a &#x27;burnt district.&#x27; There had been, a few years previously, a wild excitement passing through that region, which they called a revival of religion, but which turned out to be spurious.&quot; During this period, a number of nonconformist, folk religion, and evangelical sects flourished in the region.

The extent to which religious fervor actually affected the region was reassessed in last quarter of the twentieth century. Linda K. Pritchard used statistical data to show that compared to the rest of New York State, the Ohio River Valley in the lower Midwest, and the country as a whole, the religiosity of the Burned-over District was typical rather than exceptional. More recent works, however, have argued that these revivals in Western New York had a unique and lasting impact upon the religious and social life of the entire nation.

===West and Tidewater South===
On the American frontier, evangelical denominations, especially Methodists and Baptists, sent missionary preachers and exhorters to meet the people in the backcountry in an effort to support the growth of church membership and the formation of new congregations. Another key component of the revivalists&#x27; techniques was the camp meeting. These outdoor religious gatherings originated from field meetings and the Scottish Presbyterians&#x27; &quot;Holy Fairs&quot;, which were brought to America in the mid-eighteenth century from Ireland, Scotland, and Britain&#x27;s border counties. Most of the Scotch-Irish immigrants before the American Revolutionary War settled in the backcountry of Pennsylvania and down the spine of the Appalachian Mountains in present-day Maryland and Virginia, where Presbyterian emigrants and Baptists held large outdoor gatherings in the years prior to the war. The Presbyterians and Methodists sponsored similar gatherings on a regular basis after the Revolution.

The denominations that encouraged the revivals were based on an interpretation of man&#x27;s spiritual equality before God, which led them to recruit members and preachers from a wide range of classes and all races. Baptists and Methodist revivals were successful in some parts of the Tidewater South, where an increasing number of common planters, plain folk, and slaves were converted.

===West===
In the newly settled frontier regions, the revival was implemented through camp meetings. These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion, and they were important as social venues. The camp meeting was a religious service of several days&#x27; length with preachers. Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship. The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these events. The revivals also followed an arc of great emotional power, with an emphasis on the individual&#x27;s sins and need to turn to Christ, and a sense of restoring personal salvation. This differed from the Calvinists&#x27; belief in predestination as outlined in the Westminster Confession of Faith, which emphasized the inability of men to save themselves and decreed that the only way to be saved was by God&#x27;s electing grace. Upon their return home, most converts joined or created small local churches, which grew rapidly.

The Revival of 1800 in Logan County, Kentucky, began as a traditional Presbyterian sacramental occasion. The first informal camp meeting began in June, when people began camping on the grounds of the Red River Meeting House. Subsequent meetings followed at the nearby Gasper River and Muddy River congregations. All three of these congregations were under the ministry of Presbyterian Reverend James McGready. A year later, in August 1801, an even larger sacrament occasion that is generally considered to be America&#x27;s first camp meeting was held at Cane Ridge in Bourbon County, Kentucky, under Barton W. Stone (1772–1844) with numerous Presbyterian, Baptist, and Methodist ministers participating in the services. The six-day gathering attracting perhaps as many as 20,000 people, although the exact number of attendees was not formally recorded. Due to the efforts of such leaders as Stone and Alexander Campbell (1788–1866), the camp meeting revival spread religious enthusiasm and became a major mode of church expansion, especially for the Methodists and Baptists. Presbyterians and Methodists initially worked together to host the early camp meetings, but the Presbyterians eventually became less involved because of the noise and often raucous activities that occurred during the protracted sessions.

As a result of the Revival of 1800, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church was founded in 1810 near Dickson, Tennessee by the Revs: Samuel McAdow, Finis Ewing, and Samuel King and became a strong supporter of the revivalist movement. Cane Ridge was also instrumental in fostering what became known as the Restoration Movement, which consisted of non-denominational churches committed to what they viewed as the original, fundamental Christianity of the New Testament. Churches with roots in this movement include the Churches of Christ, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada. The congregations of these denomination were committed to individuals&#x27; achieving a personal relationship with Christ.

===Church membership soars===

The Methodist circuit riders and local Baptist preachers made enormous gains in increasing church membership. To a lesser extent the Presbyterians also gained members, particularly with the Cumberland Presbyterian Church in sparsely settled areas. As a result, the numerical strength of the Baptists and Methodists rose relative to that of the denominations dominant in the colonial period—the Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists. Among the new denominations that grew from the religious ferment of the Second Great Awakening are the Latter Day Saint movement,Restoration Movement, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Churches of Christ, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the Evangelical Christian Church in Canada.

The converts during the Second Great Awakening were predominantly female. A 1932 source estimated at least three female converts to every two male converts between 1798 and 1826. Young people (those under 25) also converted in greater numbers, and were the first to convert.

==New movements==
===Adventism===
The Advent Movement emerged in the 1830s and 1840s in North America, and was preached by ministers such as William Miller, whose followers became known as Millerites. The name refers to belief in the soon Second Advent of Jesus (popularly known as the Second coming) and resulted in several major religious denominations, including Seventh-day Adventists, Advent Christians, and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

===Holiness movement===

Though its roots are in the First Great Awakening and earlier, a re-emphasis on Wesleyan teachings on sanctification emerged during the Second Great Awakening, leading to a distinction between Mainline Methodism and Holiness churches.

===Restoration Movement===

The idea of restoring a &quot;primitive&quot; form of Christianity grew in popularity in the U.S. after the American Revolution. This desire to restore a purer form of Christianity without an elaborate hierarchy contributed to the development of many groups during the Second Great Awakening, including the Latter Day Saints and Shakers. Several factors made the restoration sentiment particularly appealing during this time period:

* To immigrants in the early 19th century, the land in the United States seemed pristine, edenic and undefiled – &quot;the perfect place to recover pure, uncorrupted and original Christianity&quot; – and the tradition-bound European churches seemed out of place in this new setting.
* A primitive faith based on the Bible alone promised a way to sidestep the competing claims of the many denominations available and for congregations to find assurance of being right without the security of an established national church.

The Restoration Movement began during, and was greatly influenced by, the Second Great Awakening. While the leaders of one of the two primary groups making up this movement, Thomas Campbell and Alexander Campbell, resisted what they saw as the spiritual manipulation of the camp meetings, the revivals contributed to the development of the other major branch, led by Barton W. Stone. The Southern phase of the Awakening &quot;was an important matrix of Barton Stone&#x27;s reform movement&quot; and shaped the evangelistic techniques used by both Stone and the Campbells.

==Culture and society==

Efforts to apply Christian teaching to the resolution of social problems presaged the Social Gospel of the late 19th century. Converts were taught that to achieve salvation they needed not just to repent personal sin but also work for the moral perfection of society, which meant eradicating sin in all its forms. Thus, evangelical converts were leading figures in a variety of 19th century reform movements.

Congregationalists set up missionary societies to evangelize the western territory of the northern tier. Members of these groups acted as apostles for the faith, and also as educators and exponents of northeastern urban culture. The Second Great Awakening served as an &quot;organizing process&quot; that created &quot;a religious and educational infrastructure&quot; across the western frontier that encompassed social networks, a religious journalism that provided mass communication, and church-related colleges. Publication and education societies promoted Christian education; most notable among them was the American Bible Society, founded in 1816. Women made up a large part of these voluntary societies. The Female Missionary Society and the Maternal Association, both active in Utica, NY, were highly organized and financially sophisticated women&#x27;s organizations responsible for many of the evangelical converts of the New York frontier.

There were also societies that broadened their focus from traditional religious concerns to larger societal ones. These organizations were primarily sponsored by affluent women. They did not stem entirely from the Second Great Awakening, but the revivalist doctrine and the expectation that one&#x27;s conversion would lead to personal action accelerated the role of women&#x27;s social benevolence work. Social activism influenced abolition groups and supporters of the Temperance movement. They began efforts to reform prisons and care for the handicapped and mentally ill. They believed in the perfectibility of people and were highly moralistic in their endeavors.

==African Americans==
Baptists and Methodists in the South preached to slaveholders and slaves alike. Conversions and congregations started with the First Great Awakening, resulting in Baptist and Methodist preachers being authorized among slaves and free African Americans more than a decade before 1800. &quot;Black Harry&quot; Hosier, an illiterate freedman who drove Francis Asbury on his circuits, proved to be able to memorize large passages of the Bible verbatim and became a cross-over success, as popular among white audiences as the black ones Asbury had originally intended for him to minister. His sermon at Thomas Chapel in Chapeltown, Delaware, in 1784 was the first to be delivered by a black preacher directly to a white congregation.

Despite being called the &quot;greatest orator in America&quot; by Benjamin Rush and one of the best in the world by Bishop Thomas Coke, Hosier was repeatedly passed over for ordination and permitted no vote during his attendance at the Christmas Conference that formally established American Methodism. Richard Allen, the other black attendee, was ordained by the Methodists in 1799, but his congregation of free African Americans in Philadelphia left the church there because of its discrimination. They founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME) in Philadelphia. After first submitting to oversight by the established Methodist bishops, several AME congregations finally left to form the first independent African-American denomination in the United States in 1816. Soon after, the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church (AME Zion) was founded as another denomination in New York City.

Early Baptist congregations were formed by slaves and free African Americans in South Carolina and Virginia. Especially in the Baptist Church, African Americans were welcomed as members and as preachers. By the early 19th century, independent African-American congregations numbered in the several hundreds in some cities of the South, such as Charleston, South Carolina, and Richmond and Petersburg, Virginia. With the growth in congregations and churches, Baptist associations formed in Virginia, for instance, as well as Kentucky and other states.

The revival also inspired slaves to demand freedom. In 1800, out of African-American revival meetings in Virginia, a plan for slave rebellion was devised by Gabriel Prosser, although the rebellion was discovered and crushed before it started. Despite white attempts to control independent African-American congregations, especially after the Nat Turner uprising of 1831, a number of African-American congregations managed to maintain their separation as independent congregations in Baptist associations. State legislatures passed laws requiring them always to have a white man present at their worship meetings.

==Women==
Women, who made up the majority of converts during the Awakening, played a crucial role in its development and focus. It is not clear why women converted in larger numbers than men. Various scholarly theories attribute the discrepancy to a reaction to the perceived sinfulness of youthful frivolity, an inherent greater sense of religiosity in women, a communal reaction to economic insecurity, or an assertion of the self in the face of patriarchal rule. Husbands, especially in the South, sometimes disapproved of their wives&#x27; conversion, forcing women to choose between submission to God or their spouses. Church membership and religious activity gave women peer support and place for meaningful activity outside the home, providing many women with communal identity and shared experiences.

Despite the predominance of women in the movement, they were not formally indoctrinated or given leading ministerial positions. However, women took other public roles; for example, relaying testimonials about their conversion experience, or assisting sinners (both male and female) through the conversion process. Leaders such as Charles Finney saw women&#x27;s public prayer as a crucial aspect in preparing a community for revival and improving their efficacy in conversion. Women also took crucial roles in the conversion and religious upbringing of children. During the period of revival, mothers were seen as the moral and spiritual foundation of the family, and were thus tasked with instructing children in matters of religion and ethics.

The greatest change in women&#x27;s roles stemmed from participation in newly formalized missionary and reform societies. Women&#x27;s prayer groups were an early and socially acceptable form of women&#x27;s organization. In the 1830s, female moral reform societies rapidly spread across the North making it the first predominantly female social movement. Through women&#x27;s positions in these organizations, women gained influence outside of the private sphere.

Changing demographics of gender also affected religious doctrine. In an effort to give sermons that would resonate with the congregation, ministers stressed Christ&#x27;s humility and forgiveness, in what the historian Barbara Welter calls a &quot;feminization&quot; of Christianity.

==Political implications==

Revivals and perfectionist hopes of improving individuals and society continued to increase from 1840 to 1865 across all major denominations, especially in urban areas. Evangelists often directly addressed issues such as slavery, greed, and poverty, laying the groundwork for later reform movements. The influence of the Awakening continued in the form of more secular movements. In the midst of shifts in theology and church polity, American Christians began progressive movements to reform society during this period. Known commonly as antebellum reform, this phenomenon included reforms against the consumption of alcohol, for women&#x27;s rights and abolition of slavery, and a multitude of other issues faced by society.

The religious enthusiasm of the Second Great Awakening was echoed by the new political enthusiasm of the Second Party System. More active participation in politics by more segments of the population brought religious and moral issues into the political sphere. The spirit of evangelical humanitarian reforms was carried on in the antebellum Whig party.

Historians stress the common understanding among participants of reform as being a part of God&#x27;s plan. As a result, local churches saw their roles in society in purifying the world through the individuals to whom they could bring salvation, and through changes in the law and the creation of institutions. Interest in transforming the world was applied to mainstream political action, as temperance activists, antislavery advocates, and proponents of other variations of reform sought to implement their beliefs into national politics. While Protestant religion had previously played an important role on the American political scene, the Second Great Awakening strengthened the role it would play.

<text>Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) is a species of krill found in the Antarctic waters of the Southern Ocean. It is a small, swimming crustacean that lives in large schools, called swarms, sometimes reaching densities of 10,000–30,000 animals per cubic metre. It feeds directly on minute phytoplankton, thereby using the primary production energy that phytoplankton originally derive from the sun in order to sustain its pelagic life cycle. It grows to a length of , weighs up to , and can live for up to six years. A key species in the Antarctic ecosystem and in terms of biomass, &quot;E. superba&quot; is one of the most abundant animal species on the planet, with a cumulative biomass of approximately .

==Life cycle==
The main spawning season of Antarctic krill is from January to March, both above the continental shelf and also in the upper region of deep sea oceanic areas. In the typical way of all krill, the male attaches a spermatophore to the genital opening of the female. For this purpose, the first pleopods (legs attached to the abdomen) of the male are constructed as mating tools. Females lay 6,000–10,000 eggs at one time. They are fertilised as they pass out of the genital opening.

According to the classical hypothesis of Marriosis De&#x27; Abrtona, derived from the results of the expedition of the famous British research vessel RRS &quot;Discovery&quot;, egg development then proceeds as follows: gastrulation (development of egg into embryo) sets in during the descent of the eggs on the shelf at the bottom, in oceanic areas in depths around . The egg hatches as a nauplius larva; once this has moulted into a metanauplius, the young animal starts migrating towards the surface in a migration known as developmental ascent.

The next two larval stages, termed second nauplius and metanauplius, still do not eat but are nourished by the remaining yolk. After three weeks, the young krill has finished the ascent. They can appear in enormous numbers counting 2 per litre in water depth. Growing larger, additional larval stages follow (second and third calyptopis, first to sixth furcilia). They are characterised by increasing development of the additional legs, the compound eyes and the setae (bristles). At , the juvenile krill resembles the habitus of the adults. Krill reach maturity after two to three years. Like all crustaceans, krill must moult in order to grow. Approximately every 13 to 20 days, krill shed their chitinous exoskeleton and leave it behind as exuvia.

==Food==
The gut of &quot;E. superba&quot; can often be seen shining green through its transparent skin. This species feeds predominantly on phytoplankton—especially very small diatoms (20 μm), which it filters from the water with a feeding basket. The glass-like shells of the diatoms are cracked in the gastric mill and then digested in the hepatopancreas. The krill can also catch and eat copepods, amphipods and other small zooplankton. The gut forms a straight tube; its digestive efficiency is not very high and therefore a lot of carbon is still present in the feces. Antarctic krill (&quot;E. superba&quot;) primarily has chitinolytic enzymes in the stomach and mid-gut to break down chitinous spines on diatoms, additional enzymes can vary due to its expansive diet.

In aquaria, krill have been observed to eat each other. When they are not fed, they shrink in size after moulting, which is exceptional for animals this size. It is likely that this is an adaptation to the seasonality of their food supply, which is limited in the dark winter months under the ice. However, the animal&#x27;s compound eyes do not shrink, and so the ratio between eye size and body length has thus been found to be a reliable indicator of starvation. A krill with ample food supply would have eyes proportional to body length, compared to a starving krill that would have eyes that appeared larger than what is normal. 
===Filter feeding===
Antarctic krill directly ingest minute phytoplankton cells, which no other animal of krill size can do. This is accomplished through filter feeding, using the krill&#x27;s highly developed front legs which form an efficient filtering apparatus: the six thoracopods (legs attached to the thorax) create a &quot;feeding basket&quot; used to collect phytoplankton from the open water. In the finest areas the openings in this basket are only 1 μm in diameter. In lower food concentrations, the feeding basket is pushed through the water for over half a metre in an opened position, and then the algae are combed to the mouth opening with special setae (bristles) on the inner side of the thoracopods.

===Ice-algae raking===
Antarctic krill can scrape off the green lawn of ice algae from the underside of pack ice. Krill have developed special rows of rake-like setae at the tips of their thoracopods, and graze the ice in a zig-zag fashion. One krill can clear an area of a square foot in about 10 minutes (1.5 cm2/s). Recent discoveries have found that the film of ice algae is well developed over vast areas, often containing much more carbon than the whole water column below. Krill find an extensive energy source here, especially in the spring after food sources have been limited during the winter months.

===Biological pump and carbon sequestration===

Krill are thought to undergo between one and three vertical migrations from mixed surface waters to depths of 100 m daily. The krill is a very untidy feeder, and it often spits out aggregates of phytoplankton (spitballs) containing thousands of cells sticking together. It also produces fecal strings that still contain significant amounts of carbon and, glass shells of the diatoms. Both are heavy and sink very fast into the abyss. This process is called the biological pump. As the waters around Antarctica are very deep (), they act as a carbon dioxide sink: this process exports large quantities of carbon (fixed carbon dioxide, CO2) from the biosphere and sequesters it for about 1,000 years.

If the phytoplankton is consumed by other components of the pelagic ecosystem, most of the carbon remains in the upper layers of the ocean. There is speculation that this process is one of the largest biofeedback mechanisms of the planet, maybe the most sizable of all, driven by a gigantic biomass. Still more research is needed to quantify the Southern Ocean ecosystem.

==Biology==

===Bioluminescence===

Krill are often referred to as &quot;light-shrimp&quot; because they emit light through bioluminescent organs. These organs are located on various parts of the individual krill&#x27;s body: one pair of organs at the eyestalk (cf. the image of the head above), another pair are on the hips of the second and seventh thoracopods, and singular organs on the four pleonsternites. These light organs emit a yellow-green light periodically, for up to 2–3 s. They are considered so highly developed that they can be compared with a flashlight. There is a concave reflector in the back of the organ and a lens in the front that guide the light produced. The whole organ can be rotated by muscles, which can direct the light to a specific area. The function of these lights is not yet fully understood; some hypotheses have suggested they serve to compensate the krill&#x27;s shadow so that they are not visible to predators from below; other speculations maintain that they play a significant role in mating or schooling at night.

The krill&#x27;s bioluminescent organs contain several fluorescent substances. The major component has a maximum fluorescence at an excitation of 355 nm and emission of 510 nm.

===Escape reaction===
Krill use an escape reaction to evade predators, swimming backwards very quickly by flipping their rear ends. This swimming pattern is also known as lobstering. Krill can reach speeds of over . The trigger time to optical stimulus is, despite the low temperatures, only 55 ms.

=== Genome ===
The genome of &quot;E. superba&quot; spans about 48 GB and is thus one of the largest in the animal kingdom and the largest that has been assembled to date. Its content of repetitive DNA is about 70% and may reach up to 92.45% after additional repeat annotation, which is also the largest fraction known of any genome. There is no evidence of polyploidy. Shao et al. annotated 28,834 protein-coding genes in the Antarctic krill genome, which is similar to other animal genomes. The gene and intron lengths of Antarctic krill are notably shorter than those of lungfishes and Mexican axolotl, two other animals with giant genomes.

== Geographic distribution ==

Antarctic krill has a circumpolar distribution, being found throughout the Southern Ocean, and as far north as the Antarctic Convergence. At the Antarctic Convergence, the cold Antarctic surface water submerges below the warmer subantarctic waters. This front runs roughly at 55° south; from there to the continent, the Southern Ocean covers 32 million square kilometres. This is 65 times the size of the North Sea. In the winter season, more than three-quarters of this area become covered by ice, whereas become ice free in summer. The water temperature fluctuates at .

The waters of the Southern Ocean form a system of currents. Whenever there is a West Wind Drift, the surface strata travels around Antarctica in an easterly direction. Near the continent, the East Wind Drift runs counterclockwise. At the front between both, large eddies develop, for example, in the Weddell Sea. The krill swarms swim with these water masses, to establish one single stock all around Antarctica, with gene exchange over the whole area. Currently, there is little knowledge of the precise migration patterns since individual krill cannot yet be tagged to track their movements. The largest shoals are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite. One swarm covered an area of of ocean, to a depth of and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill. Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them. By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface.

==Ecology==
Antarctic krill is the keystone species of the Antarctic ecosystem beyond the coastal shelf, and provides an important food source for whales, seals (such as leopard seals, fur seals, and crabeater seals), squid, icefish, penguins, albatrosses and many other species of birds. Crabeater seals have even developed special teeth as an adaptation to catch this abundant food source: its unusual multilobed teeth enable this species to sieve krill from the water. Its dentition looks like a perfect strainer, but how it operates in detail is still unknown. Crabeaters are the most abundant seal in the world; 98% of their diet is made up of &quot; E. superba&quot;. These seals consume over 63 million tonnes of krill each year. Leopard seals have developed similar teeth (45% krill in diet). All seals consume 63–130 million tonnes, all whales 34–43 million tonnes, birds 15–20 million tonnes, squid 30–100 million tonnes, and fish 10–20 million tonnes, adding up to 152–313 million tonnes of krill consumption each year.

The size step between krill and its prey is unusually large: generally it takes three or four steps from the 20 μm small phytoplankton cells to a krill-sized organism (via small copepods, large copepods, mysids to 5 cm fish).

&quot;E. superba&quot; lives only in the Southern Ocean. In the North Atlantic, &quot;Meganyctiphanes norvegica&quot; and in the Pacific, &quot;Euphausia pacifica&quot; are the dominant species.

===Biomass and production===
The biomass of Antarctic krill was estimated in 2009 to be 0.05 gigatons of carbon (Gt C), similar to the total biomass of humans (0.06 Gt C). The reason Antarctic krill are able to build up such a high biomass and production is that the waters around the icy Antarctic continent harbour one of the largest plankton assemblages in the world, possibly &quot;the&quot; largest. The ocean is filled with phytoplankton; as the water rises from the depths to the light-flooded surface, it brings nutrients from all of the world&#x27;s oceans back into the photic zone where they are once again available to living organisms.

Thus primary production—the conversion of sunlight into organic biomass, the foundation of the food chain—has an annual carbon fixation of 1–2 g/m2 in the open ocean. Close to the ice it can reach 30–50 g/m2. These values are not outstandingly high, compared to very productive areas like the North Sea or upwelling regions, but the area over which it takes place is enormous, even compared to other large primary producers such as rainforests. In addition, during the Austral summer there are many hours of daylight to fuel the process. All of these factors make the plankton and the krill a critical part of the planet&#x27;s ecocycle.

===Decline with shrinking pack ice===

A possible decline in Antarctic krill biomass may have been caused by the reduction of the pack ice zone due to global warming. Antarctic krill, especially in the early stages of development, seem to need the pack ice structures in order to have a fair chance of survival. The pack ice provides natural cave-like features which the krill uses to evade their predators. In the years of low pack ice conditions the krill tend to give way to salps, a barrel-shaped free-floating filter feeder that also grazes on plankton.

===Ocean acidification===
Another challenge for Antarctic krill, as well as many calcifying organisms (corals, bivalve mussels, snails etc.), is the acidification of the oceans caused by increasing levels of carbon dioxide. Krill exoskeleton contains carbonate, which is susceptible to dissolution under low pH conditions. It has already been shown that increased carbon dioxide can disrupt the development of krill eggs and even prevent the juvenile krill from hatching, leading to future geographically widespread decreases in krill hatching success. The further effects of ocean acidification on the krill life cycle however remains unclear but scientists fear that it could significantly impact on its distribution, abundance and survival.

===Fisheries===
The fishery of Antarctic krill is on the order of 100,000 tonnes per year. The major catching nations are South Korea, Norway, Japan and Poland. The products are used as animal food and fish bait. Krill fisheries are difficult to operate in two important respects. First, a krill net needs to have very fine meshes, producing a very high drag, which generates a bow wave that deflects the krill to the sides. Second, fine meshes tend to clog very fast.

Yet another problem is bringing the krill catch on board. When the full net is hauled out of the water, the organisms compress each other, resulting in great loss of the krill&#x27;s liquids. Experiments have been carried out to pump krill, while still in water, through a large tube on board. Special krill nets also are currently under development. The processing of the krill must be very rapid since the catch deteriorates within several hours. Its high protein and vitamin content makes krill quite suitable for both direct human consumption and the animal-feed industry.

Fishing and potentially overfishing krill is an issue of increasing concern.

<text>In linear algebra, the trace of a square matrix , denoted , is the sum of the elements on its main diagonal, formula_1. It is only defined for a square matrix (). 

The trace of a matrix is the sum of its eigenvalues (counted with multiplicities). Also, for any matrices and of the same size. Thus, similar matrices have the same trace. As a consequence, one can define the trace of a linear operator mapping a finite-dimensional vector space into itself, since all matrices describing such an operator with respect to a basis are similar.

The trace is related to the derivative of the determinant (see Jacobi&#x27;s formula).

== Definition ==
The trace of an square matrix is defined as
formula_2
where denotes the entry on the row and column of . The entries of can be real numbers, complex numbers, or more generally elements of a field . The trace is not defined for non-square matrices.

== Example ==
Let be a matrix, with
formula_3

Then
formula_4

== Properties ==

=== Basic properties ===
The trace is a linear mapping. That is,
formula_5
for all square matrices and , and all scalars .

A matrix and its transpose have the same trace:
formula_6

This follows immediately from the fact that transposing a square matrix does not affect elements along the main diagonal.

=== Trace of a product ===
The trace of a square matrix which is the product of two matrices can be rewritten as the sum of entry-wise products of their elements, i.e. as the sum of all elements of their Hadamard product. Phrased directly, if and are two matrices, then:
formula_7

If one views any real matrix as a vector of length (an operation called vectorization) then the above operation on and coincides with the standard dot product. According to the above expression, is a sum of squares and hence is nonnegative, equal to zero if and only if is zero. Furthermore, as noted in the above formula, . These demonstrate the positive-definiteness and symmetry required of an inner product; it is common to call the Frobenius inner product of and . This is a natural inner product on the vector space of all real matrices of fixed dimensions. The norm derived from this inner product is called the Frobenius norm, and it satisfies a submultiplicative property, as can be proven with the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality:
formula_8
if and are real matrices such that is a square matrix. The Frobenius inner product and norm arise frequently in matrix calculus and statistics.

The Frobenius inner product may be extended to a hermitian inner product on the complex vector space of all complex matrices of a fixed size, by replacing by its complex conjugate.

The symmetry of the Frobenius inner product may be phrased more directly as follows: the matrices in the trace of a product can be switched without changing the result. If and are and real or complex matrices, respectively, then

This is notable both for the fact that does not usually equal , and also since the trace of either does not usually equal . The similarity-invariance of the trace, meaning that for any square matrix and any invertible matrix of the same dimensions, is a fundamental consequence. This is proved by
formula_9
Similarity invariance is the crucial property of the trace in order to discuss traces of linear transformations as below.

Additionally, for real column vectors formula_10 and formula_11, the trace of the outer product is equivalent to the inner product:
=== Cyclic property ===
More generally, the trace is &quot;invariant under circular shifts&quot;, that is,

This is known as the &quot;cyclic property&quot;.

Arbitrary permutations are not allowed: in general,
formula_12

However, if products of &quot;three&quot; symmetric matrices are considered, any permutation is allowed, since:
formula_13
where the first equality is because the traces of a matrix and its transpose are equal. Note that this is not true in general for more than three factors.

=== Trace of a Kronecker product ===
The trace of the Kronecker product of two matrices is the product of their traces:
formula_14

===Characterization of the trace===
The following three properties:
formula_15
characterize the trace up to a scalar multiple in the following sense: If formula_16 is a linear functional on the space of square matrices that satisfies formula_17 then formula_16 and formula_19 are proportional.

For formula_20 matrices, imposing the normalization formula_21 makes formula_16 equal to the trace.

===Trace as the sum of eigenvalues===
Given any matrix , there is

where are the eigenvalues of counted with multiplicity. This holds true even if is a real matrix and some (or all) of the eigenvalues are complex numbers. This may be regarded as a consequence of the existence of the Jordan canonical form, together with the similarity-invariance of the trace discussed above.

===Trace of commutator===
When both and are matrices, the trace of the (ring-theoretic) commutator of and vanishes: , because and is linear. One can state this as &quot;the trace is a map of Lie algebras from operators to scalars&quot;, as the commutator of scalars is trivial (it is an Abelian Lie algebra). In particular, using similarity invariance, it follows that the identity matrix is never similar to the commutator of any pair of matrices.

Conversely, any square matrix with zero trace is a linear combination of the commutators of pairs of matrices. Moreover, any square matrix with zero trace is unitarily equivalent to a square matrix with diagonal consisting of all zeros.

===Traces of special kinds of matrices===
=== Relationship to the characteristic polynomial ===

The trace of an formula_23 matrix formula_24 is the coefficient of formula_25 in the characteristic polynomial, possibly changed of sign, according to the convention in the definition of the characteristic polynomial.

== Relationship to eigenvalues ==
If is a linear operator represented by a square matrix with real or complex entries and if are the eigenvalues of (listed according to their algebraic multiplicities), then

This follows from the fact that is always similar to its Jordan form, an upper triangular matrix having on the main diagonal. In contrast, the determinant of is the &quot;product&quot; of its eigenvalues; that is,
formula_26

Everything in the present section applies as well to any square matrix with coefficients in an algebraically closed field.

=== Derivative relationships ===
If is a square matrix with small entries and denotes the identity matrix, then we have approximately

formula_27

Precisely this means that the trace is the derivative of the determinant function at the identity matrix. Jacobi&#x27;s formula 

formula_28

is more general and describes the differential of the determinant at an arbitrary square matrix, in terms of the trace and the adjugate of the matrix.

From this (or from the connection between the trace and the eigenvalues), one can derive a relation between the trace function, the matrix exponential function, and the determinant:formula_29

A related characterization of the trace applies to linear vector fields. Given a matrix , define a vector field on by . The components of this vector field are linear functions (given by the rows of ). Its divergence is a constant function, whose value is equal to .

By the divergence theorem, one can interpret this in terms of flows: if represents the velocity of a fluid at location and is a region in , the net flow of the fluid out of is given by , where is the volume of .

The trace is a linear operator, hence it commutes with the derivative:
formula_30

== Trace of a linear operator ==
In general, given some linear map (where is a finite-dimensional vector space), we can define the trace of this map by considering the trace of a matrix representation of , that is, choosing a basis for and describing as a matrix relative to this basis, and taking the trace of this square matrix. The result will not depend on the basis chosen, since different bases will give rise to similar matrices, allowing for the possibility of a basis-independent definition for the trace of a linear map.

Such a definition can be given using the canonical isomorphism between the space of linear maps on and , where is the dual space of . Let be in and let be in . Then the trace of the indecomposable element is defined to be ; the trace of a general element is defined by linearity. The trace of a linear map can then be defined as the trace, in the above sense, of the element of corresponding to &quot;f&quot; under the above mentioned canonical isomorphism. Using an explicit basis for and the corresponding dual basis for , one can show that this gives the same definition of the trace as given above.

== Numerical algorithms ==

=== Stochastic estimator ===
The trace can be estimated unbiasedly by &quot;Hutchinson&#x27;s trick&quot;:Given any matrix formula_31, and any random formula_32 with formula_33, we have formula_34. 

For a proof expand the expectation directly. 

Usually, the random vector is sampled from formula_35 (normal distribution) or formula_36 (Rademacher distribution).

More sophisticated stochastic estimators of trace have been developed.

== Applications ==
If a 2 x 2 real matrix has zero trace, its square is a diagonal matrix.

The trace of a 2 × 2 complex matrix is used to classify Möbius transformations. First, the matrix is normalized to make its determinant equal to one. Then, if the square of the trace is 4, the corresponding transformation is &quot;parabolic&quot;. If the square is in the interval , it is &quot;elliptic&quot;. Finally, if the square is greater than 4, the transformation is &quot;loxodromic&quot;. See classification of Möbius transformations.

The trace is used to define characters of group representations. Two representations of a group are equivalent (up to change of basis on ) if for all .

The trace also plays a central role in the distribution of quadratic forms.

== Lie algebra ==
The trace is a map of Lie algebras formula_37 from the Lie algebra formula_38 of linear operators on an -dimensional space ( matrices with entries in formula_39) to the Lie algebra of scalars; as is Abelian (the Lie bracket vanishes), the fact that this is a map of Lie algebras is exactly the statement that the trace of a bracket vanishes:
formula_40

The kernel of this map, a matrix whose trace is zero, is often said to be &#x27; or &#x27;, and these matrices form the simple Lie algebra formula_41, which is the Lie algebra of the special linear group of matrices with determinant 1. The special linear group consists of the matrices which do not change volume, while the special linear Lie algebra is the matrices which do not alter volume of &quot;infinitesimal&quot; sets.

In fact, there is an internal direct sum decomposition formula_42 of operators/matrices into traceless operators/matrices and scalars operators/matrices. The projection map onto scalar operators can be expressed in terms of the trace, concretely as:
formula_43

Formally, one can compose the trace (the counit map) with the unit map formula_44 of &quot;inclusion of scalars&quot; to obtain a map formula_45 mapping onto scalars, and multiplying by . Dividing by makes this a projection, yielding the formula above.

In terms of short exact sequences, one has
formula_46
which is analogous to
formula_47
(where formula_48) for Lie groups. However, the trace splits naturally (via formula_49 times scalars) so formula_50, but the splitting of the determinant would be as the th root times scalars, and this does not in general define a function, so the determinant does not split and the general linear group does not decompose:
formula_51

=== Bilinear forms ===
The bilinear form (where , are square matrices)
formula_52
is called the Killing form, which is used for the classification of Lie algebras.

The trace defines a bilinear form:
formula_53

The form is symmetric, non-degenerate and associative in the sense that:
formula_54

For a complex simple Lie algebra (such as ), every such bilinear form is proportional to each other; in particular, to the Killing form.

Two matrices and are said to be &quot;trace orthogonal&quot; if
formula_55

There is a generalization to a general representation formula_56 of a Lie algebra formula_57, such that formula_58 is a homomorphism of Lie algebras formula_59 The trace form formula_60 on formula_61 is defined as above. The bilinear form
formula_62
is symmetric and invariant due to cyclicity.

== Generalizations ==
The concept of trace of a matrix is generalized to the trace class of compact operators on Hilbert spaces, and the analog of the Frobenius norm is called the Hilbert–Schmidt norm.

If is a trace-class operator, then for any orthonormal basis formula_63, the trace is given by
formula_64
and is finite and independent of the orthonormal basis.

The partial trace is another generalization of the trace that is operator-valued. The trace of a linear operator which lives on a product space is equal to the partial traces over and :
formula_65

For more properties and a generalization of the partial trace, see traced monoidal categories.

If is a general associative algebra over a field , then a trace on is often defined to be any map which vanishes on commutators; for all . Such a trace is not uniquely defined; it can always at least be modified by multiplication by a nonzero scalar.

A supertrace is the generalization of a trace to the setting of superalgebras.

The operation of tensor contraction generalizes the trace to arbitrary tensors.

Gomme and Klein (2011) define a matrix trace operator formula_66 that operates on block matrices and use it to compute second-order perturbation solutions to dynamic economic models without the need for tensor notation.

==Traces in the language of tensor products==
Given a vector space , there is a natural bilinear map given by sending to the scalar . The universal property of the tensor product automatically implies that this bilinear map is induced by a linear functional on .

Similarly, there is a natural bilinear map given by sending to the linear map . The universal property of the tensor product, just as used previously, says that this bilinear map is induced by a linear map . If is finite-dimensional, then this linear map is a linear isomorphism. This fundamental fact is a straightforward consequence of the existence of a (finite) basis of , and can also be phrased as saying that any linear map can be written as the sum of (finitely many) rank-one linear maps. Composing the inverse of the isomorphism with the linear functional obtained above results in a linear functional on . This linear functional is exactly the same as the trace.

Using the definition of trace as the sum of diagonal elements, the matrix formula is straightforward to prove, and was given above. In the present perspective, one is considering linear maps and , and viewing them as sums of rank-one maps, so that there are linear functionals and and nonzero vectors and such that and for any in . Then
:formula_67
for any in . The rank-one linear map has trace and so
:formula_68
Following the same procedure with and reversed, one finds exactly the same formula, proving that equals .

The above proof can be regarded as being based upon tensor products, given that the fundamental identity of with is equivalent to the expressibility of any linear map as the sum of rank-one linear maps. As such, the proof may be written in the notation of tensor products. Then one may consider the multilinear map given by sending to . Further composition with the trace map then results in , and this is unchanged if one were to have started with instead. One may also consider the bilinear map given by sending to the composition , which is then induced by a linear map . It can be seen that this coincides with the linear map . The established symmetry upon composition with the trace map then establishes the equality of the two traces.

For any finite dimensional vector space , there is a natural linear map ; in the language of linear maps, it assigns to a scalar the linear map . Sometimes this is called &quot;coevaluation map&quot;, and the trace is called &quot;evaluation map&quot;. These structures can be axiomatized to define categorical traces in the abstract setting of category theory.

<text>William IV (William Henry; 21 August 1765 – 20 June 1837) was King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and King of Hanover from 26 June 1830 until his death in 1837. The third son of George III, William succeeded his elder brother George IV, becoming the last king and penultimate monarch of Britain&#x27;s House of Hanover.

William served in the Royal Navy in his youth, spending time in British North America and the Caribbean, and was later nicknamed the &quot;Sailor King&quot;. In 1789, he was created Duke of Clarence and St Andrews. Between 1791 and 1811, he cohabited with the actress Dorothea Jordan, with whom he had ten children. In 1818, he married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen; William was not known to have had mistresses during their marriage. In 1827, he was appointed Britain&#x27;s Lord High Admiral, the first since 1709. 

As his two elder brothers died without leaving legitimate issue, William inherited the throne when he was 64 years old. His reign saw several reforms: the Poor Law was updated, child labour restricted, slavery abolished in nearly all of the British Empire, and the electoral system refashioned by the Reform Act 1832. Although William did not engage in politics as much as his brother or his father, he was the last British monarch to appoint a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. He granted his German kingdom a short-lived liberal constitution. William had no surviving legitimate children at the time of his death, so he was succeeded by his niece Victoria in the United Kingdom and his brother Ernest Augustus in Hanover.

== Early life ==

William was born in the early hours of the morning on 21 August 1765 at Buckingham House, the third child and son of King George III and Queen Charlotte. He had two elder brothers, George, Prince of Wales, and Prince Frederick (later Duke of York and Albany), and was not expected to inherit the Crown. He was baptised in the Great Council Chamber of St James&#x27;s Palace on 20 September 1765. His godparents were the King&#x27;s siblings: Prince William Henry, Duke of Gloucester and Edinburgh; Prince Henry (later Duke of Cumberland and Strathearn); and Princess Augusta, Hereditary Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel.

William spent most of his early life in Richmond and at Kew Palace, where he was educated by private tutors. At the age of thirteen, he joined the Royal Navy as a midshipman, in Admiral Digby&#x27;s squadron. For four years the lieutenant of his watch was Richard Goodwin Keats, with whom he formed a life-long friendship and whom he described as the one to whom he owed all his professional knowledge. He was present at the Battle of Cape St Vincent in 1780, when the &quot;San Julián&quot; struck her colours to his ship. His experiences in the navy seem to have been little different from those of other midshipmen, though in contrast to other sailors he was accompanied on board ship by a tutor. He did his share of the cooking and got arrested with his shipmates after a drunken brawl in Gibraltar; he was hastily released from custody after his identity became known.

William served in New York during the American War of Independence, making him the only member of the British royal family to visit America up to and through the American Revolution. While William was in America, George Washington approved a plot to kidnap him, writing:

The spirit of enterprise so conspicuous in your plan for surprising in their quarters and bringing off the Prince William Henry and Admiral Digby merits applause; and you have my authority to make the attempt in any manner, and at such a time, as your judgment may direct. I am fully persuaded, that it is unnecessary to caution you against offering insult or indignity to the persons of the Prince or Admiral...

The plot did not come to fruition; the British heard of it and assigned guards to William, who had until then walked around New York unescorted. In September 1781, William held court at the Manhattan home of Governor Robertson. In attendance were Mayor David Mathews, Admiral Digby, and General Delancey.

William became a lieutenant in 1785 and captain of the following year, during which he spent time in the colonies of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. Later in 1786, he was stationed in the West Indies under Horatio Nelson, who wrote of William, &quot;in his professional line, he is superior to two-thirds, I am sure, of the [naval] list; and in attention to orders, and respect to his superior officer, I hardly know his equal.&quot; The two were great friends, and dined together almost nightly. At Nelson&#x27;s wedding, William insisted on giving the bride away. After touring Quebec in 1787, he was, the next year, given command of the frigate and promoted to rear-admiral while commanding in 1790.

William sought to be made a duke like his elder brothers, and to receive a similar parliamentary grant, but his father was reluctant. To put pressure on him, William threatened to stand for the British House of Commons for the constituency of Totnes in Devon. Appalled at the prospect of his son making his case to the voters, the King created him Duke of Clarence and St Andrews and Earl of Munster on 19 May 1789, supposedly saying: &quot;I well know it is another vote added to the Opposition.&quot; William&#x27;s political record was inconsistent and, like many politicians of the time, cannot be ascribed to a single party. However, he allied himself publicly with the Whigs, as did his elder brothers, who were known to be in conflict with the political positions of their father.

== Naval career ==

William ceased his active service in the Royal Navy in 1790. When Britain declared war on France in 1793, he was eager to serve his country and expected to be given a command but was not, perhaps at first because he had broken his arm by falling down some stairs drunk, but later perhaps because he gave a speech in the House of Lords opposing the war. The following year he spoke in favour of the war, and expected a command after his change of heart; none came. The Admiralty did not reply to his request. He did not lose hope of being appointed to an active post. In 1798 he was made an admiral, but the rank was purely nominal. Despite repeated petitions, he was never given a command throughout the Napoleonic Wars. In 1811, he was appointed to the honorary position of Admiral of the Fleet. In 1813, he came nearest to involvement in actual fighting, when he visited the British troops fighting in the Low Countries. Watching the bombardment of Antwerp from a church steeple, he came under fire, and a bullet pierced his coat.

Instead of serving at sea, William spent time in the House of Lords, where he spoke in opposition to the abolition of slavery, which still existed in the British colonies. Freedom would do the slaves little good, he argued. He had travelled widely and, in his eyes, the living standard among freemen in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland was worse than that among slaves in the West Indies. His experience in the Caribbean, where he &quot;quickly absorbed the plantation owners&#x27; views about slavery&quot;, lent weight to his position, which was perceived as well-argued and just by some of his contemporaries. In his first speech before Parliament he called himself &quot;an attentive observer of the state of the negroes&quot; who found them well cared for and &quot;in a state of humble happiness&quot;. Others thought it &quot;shocking that so young a man, under no bias of interest, should be earnest in continuance of the slave trade&quot;. In his speech to the House, William insulted William Wilberforce, the leading abolitionist, saying: &quot;the proponents of the abolition are either fanatics or hypocrites, and in one of those classes I rank Mr. Wilberforce&quot;. On other issues he was more liberal, such as supporting moves to abolish penal laws against dissenting Christians. He also opposed efforts to bar those found guilty of adultery from remarriage.

== Relationships and marriage ==

William had an illegitimate son before 1791 whose mother is unknown; the son, also called William, likely drowned off Madagascar when HMS &quot;Blenheim&quot; sank or foundered in February 1807. Caroline von Linsingen, whose father was a general in the Hanoverian infantry, claimed to have had a son, Heinrich, by William in around 1790 but William was not in Hanover at the time that she claims, and the story is considered implausible by historians.

From 1791, William lived with an Irish actress, Dorothea Bland, better known by her stage name Mrs Jordan, the title &quot;Mrs&quot; being assumed at the start of her stage career to explain an inconvenient pregnancy and &quot;Jordan&quot; because she had &quot;crossed the water&quot; from Ireland to Britain. He appeared to enjoy the domesticity of his life with Mrs. Jordan, remarking to a friend: &quot;Mrs Jordan is a very good creature, very domestic and careful of her children. To be sure she is absurd sometimes and has her humours. But there are such things more or less in all families.&quot; The couple, while living quietly, enjoyed entertaining, with Mrs. Jordan writing in late 1809: &quot;We shall have a full and merry house this Christmas, &#x27;tis what the dear Duke delights in.&quot; The King was accepting of his son&#x27;s relationship with the actress (though recommending that he halve her allowance); in 1797, he created William the Ranger of Bushy Park, which included a large residence, Bushy House, for William&#x27;s growing family. William used Bushy as his principal residence until he became king. His London residence, Clarence House, was constructed to the designs of John Nash between 1825 and 1827.

The couple had ten illegitimate children—five sons and five daughters—nine of whom were named after William&#x27;s siblings; each was given the surname &quot;FitzClarence&quot;. Their affair lasted for twenty years before ending in 1811. Mrs Jordan had no doubt about the reason for the break-up: &quot;Money, money, my good friend, has, I am convinced made HIM at this moment the most wretched of men&quot;, adding, &quot;With all his excellent qualities, his domestic &quot;virtues&quot;, his love for his &quot;lovely&quot; children, what must he not at this moment suffer?&quot; She was given a financial settlement of £4,400 () per year and custody of her daughters on condition that she did not resume the stage. When she resumed acting in an effort to repay debts incurred by the husband of one of her daughters from a previous relationship, William took custody of the daughters and stopped paying the £1,500 () designated for their maintenance. After Mrs Jordan&#x27;s acting career began to fail, she fled to France to escape her creditors and died, impoverished, near Paris in 1816.
Deeply in debt, William made several attempts at marrying a wealthy heiress, such as Catherine Tylney-Long, but his suits were unsuccessful. Following the death of William&#x27;s niece Princess Charlotte of Wales, then second-in-line to the British throne, in 1817, George III was left with twelve children but no legitimate grandchildren. The race was on among his sons, the royal dukes, to marry and produce an heir. William had great advantages in this race—his two older brothers were both childless and estranged from their wives, who were both beyond childbearing age anyway, and William was the healthiest of the three. If he lived long enough, he would almost certainly ascend the British and Hanoverian thrones and have the opportunity to sire the next monarch. William&#x27;s initial choices of potential wives either met with the disapproval of his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, or turned him down. His younger brother Prince Adolphus, Duke of Cambridge, was sent to Germany to scout out the available Protestant princesses; he came up with Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, but her father, Frederick, declined the match. Two months later Adolphus married Augusta himself. Eventually, however, a princess was found who was amiable, home-loving and willing to accept (even enthusiastically welcome) William&#x27;s nine surviving children, several of whom had not yet reached adulthood. In the Drawing Room at Kew Palace on 11 July 1818, William married Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen.

William&#x27;s marriage, which lasted almost twenty years until his death, was a happy one. Adelaide took both William and his finances in hand. For their first year of marriage the couple lived in economical fashion in Germany. William&#x27;s debts were soon on the way to being paid, especially since Parliament had voted him an increased allowance, which he reluctantly accepted after his requests to have it increased further were refused. William is not known to have had mistresses after his marriage. The couple had two short-lived daughters and Adelaide suffered two miscarriages. Despite this, false rumours that she was pregnant persisted into William&#x27;s reign—he dismissed them as &quot;damned stuff&quot;.

== Lord High Admiral ==

William&#x27;s eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, had been Prince Regent since 1811 because of the mental illness of their father. In 1820, George III died and the Prince Regent became George IV. William was now second in the line of succession, preceded only by his brother Frederick. Reformed since his marriage, William walked for hours, ate relatively frugally, and the only drink he imbibed in quantity was barley water flavoured with lemon. Both of his older brothers were unhealthy, and it was considered only a matter of time before he became king. When Frederick died in 1827, William, then more than 60 years old, became heir presumptive. Later that year, the incoming prime minister, George Canning, appointed him to the office of Lord High Admiral, which had been in commission (that is, exercised by a board rather than by a single individual) since 1709. While in office, William had repeated conflicts with his Council, which was composed of Admiralty officers. Things finally came to a head in 1828 when, as Lord High Admiral, he put to sea with a squadron of ships, leaving no word of where they were going, and remained away for ten days. The King requested his resignation through the prime minister, Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington; he complied.

Despite the difficulties William experienced, he did considerable good as Lord High Admiral. He abolished the cat o&#x27; nine tails for most offences other than mutiny, attempted to improve the standard of naval gunnery, and required regular reports of the condition and preparedness of each ship. He commissioned the first steam warship and advocated the construction of more. Holding the office permitted him to make mistakes and learn from them—a process that might have been far more costly if he had not learnt before becoming king that he should act only with the advice of his councillors.

William spent much of his remaining time during his brother&#x27;s reign in the House of Lords. He supported the Catholic Emancipation Bill against the opposition of his younger brother Ernest Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, describing the latter&#x27;s position on the Bill as &quot;infamous&quot;, to Ernest&#x27;s outrage. George IV&#x27;s health was increasingly bad; it was obvious by early 1830 that he was near death. The King took his leave of William at the end of May, stating, &quot;God&#x27;s will be done. I have injured no man. It will all rest on you then.&quot; William&#x27;s genuine affection for his older brother could not mask his rising anticipation that he would soon be king.

== Reign ==

=== Early reign ===

When George IV died on 26 June 1830 without surviving legitimate issue, William succeeded him as William IV. Aged 64, he was the oldest person at that point to assume the British throne, a distinction he would hold until surpassed by Charles III in 2022.

Unlike his extravagant brother, William was unassuming, discouraging pomp and ceremony. In contrast to George IV, who tended to spend most of his time in Windsor Castle, William was known, especially early in his reign, to walk, unaccompanied, through London or Brighton. Until the Reform Crisis eroded his standing he was very popular among the people, who saw him as more approachable and down-to-earth than his brother.

The King immediately proved himself a conscientious worker. The prime minister, the Duke of Wellington, stated that he had done more business with King William in ten minutes than he had with George IV in as many days. Lord Brougham described him as an excellent man of business, asking enough questions to help him understand the matter—whereas George IV feared to ask questions lest he display his ignorance and George III would ask too many and then not wait for a response.

The King did his best to endear himself to the people. Charlotte Williams-Wynn wrote shortly after his accession: &quot;Hitherto the King has been indefatigable in his efforts to make himself popular, and do good natured and amiable things in every possible instance.&quot; Emily Eden noted: &quot;He is an immense improvement on the last unforgiving animal, who died growling sulkily in his den at Windsor. This man at least &quot;wishes&quot; to make everybody happy, and everything he has done has been benevolent.&quot;

William dismissed his brother&#x27;s French chefs and German band, replacing them with English ones to public approval. He gave much of George IV&#x27;s art collection to the nation and halved the royal stud. George had begun an extensive (and expensive) renovation of Buckingham Palace; William refused to reside there and twice tried to give the palace away, once to the Army as a barracks and once to Parliament after the Houses of Parliament burned down in 1834. His informality could be startling: when in residence at the Royal Pavilion in Brighton, he used to send to the hotels for a list of their guests and invite anyone he knew to dinner, urging guests not to &quot;bother about clothes. The Queen does nothing but embroider flowers after dinner.&quot;

Upon taking the throne, William did not forget his nine surviving illegitimate children, creating his eldest son, George, Earl of Munster and granting the other children the precedence of a daughter or a younger son of a marquess. Despite this his children importuned for greater opportunities, disgusting elements of the press who reported that the &quot;impudence and rapacity of the FitzJordans is unexampled&quot;. The relationship between William and his sons &quot;was punctuated by a series of savage and, for the King at least, painful quarrels&quot; over money and honours. His daughters, on the other hand, proved an ornament to his court, as &quot;They are all, you know, pretty and lively, and make society in a way that real princesses could not.&quot;

=== Reform crisis ===
At the time, the death of the monarch caused fresh Parliamentary elections and, in the general election of 1830, Wellington&#x27;s Tories lost ground to the Whigs under Lord Grey, though the Tories still had the largest number of seats. With the Tories bitterly divided, Wellington was defeated in the House of Commons in November, and Lord Grey formed a government. Grey pledged to reform the electoral system, which had seen few changes since the fifteenth century. The inequities in the system were great; for example, large towns such as Manchester and Birmingham elected no members (though they were part of county constituencies), while small boroughs, known as rotten or pocket boroughs—such as Old Sarum with just seven voters—elected two members of Parliament each. Often, the rotten boroughs were controlled by great aristocrats, whose nominees were invariably elected by the constituents—who were, most often, their tenants—especially since the secret ballot was not yet used in Parliamentary elections. Landowners who controlled seats were even able to sell them to prospective candidates.
When the First Reform Bill was defeated in the House of Commons in 1831, Grey&#x27;s ministry urged William to dissolve Parliament, which would lead to a new general election. At first, William hesitated to exercise his prerogative powers to dissolve Parliament because elections had just been held the year before and the country was in a state of high excitement which might boil over into violence. He was, however, irritated by the conduct of the Opposition, which announced its intention to move the passage of an Address, or resolution, in the House of Lords, against dissolution. Regarding the Opposition&#x27;s motion as an attack on his prerogative, and at the urgent request of Lord Grey and his ministers, the King prepared to go in person to the House of Lords and prorogue Parliament. The monarch&#x27;s arrival would stop all debate and prevent passage of the Address. When initially told that his horses could not be ready at such short notice, William is supposed to have said, &quot;Then I will go in a hackney cab!&quot; Coach and horses were assembled quickly and he immediately proceeded to Parliament. Said &quot;The Times&quot; of the scene before William&#x27;s arrival, &quot;It is utterly impossible to describe the scene ... The violent tones and gestures of noble Lords ... astonished the spectators, and affected the ladies who were present with visible alarm.&quot; Lord Londonderry brandished a whip, threatening to thrash the Government supporters, and was held back by four of his colleagues. William hastily put on the crown, entered the Chamber, and dissolved Parliament. This forced new elections for the House of Commons, which yielded a great victory for the reformers. But although the Commons was clearly in favour of parliamentary reform, the Lords remained implacably opposed to it.

The crisis saw a brief interlude for the celebration of the King&#x27;s coronation on 8 September 1831. At first, William wished to dispense with the coronation entirely, feeling that his wearing the crown while proroguing Parliament answered any need. He was persuaded otherwise by traditionalists. He refused, however, to celebrate the coronation in the expensive way his brother had—the 1821 coronation had cost £240,000, of which £16,000 was merely to hire the jewels. At William&#x27;s instructions, the Privy Council budgeted less than £30,000 for the coronation. When traditionalist Tories threatened to boycott what they called the &quot;Half Crown-nation&quot;, the King retorted that they should go ahead, and that he anticipated &quot;greater convenience of room and less heat&quot;.

After the rejection of the Second Reform Bill by the House of Lords in October 1831, agitation for reform grew across the country; demonstrations grew violent in so-called &quot;Reform Riots&quot;. In the face of popular excitement, the Grey ministry refused to accept defeat, and re-introduced the Bill, despite the continued opposition of peers in the House of Lords. Frustrated by the Lords&#x27; obdurate attitude, Grey suggested that the King create a sufficient number of new peers to ensure the passage of the Reform Bill. The King objected—though he had the power to create an unlimited number of peers, he had already created 22 new peers in his Coronation Honours. William reluctantly agreed to the creation of the number of peers sufficient &quot;to secure the success of the bill&quot;. However, the King, citing the difficulties with a permanent expansion of the peerage, told Grey that the creations must be restricted as much as possible to the eldest sons and collateral heirs of existing peers, so that the created peerages would for the most part be absorbed as subsidiary titles. This time, the Lords did not reject the bill outright, but began preparing to change its basic character through amendments. Grey and his fellow ministers decided to resign if the King did not agree to an immediate and large creation to force the bill through in its entirety. The King refused, and accepted their resignations. The King attempted to restore the Duke of Wellington to office, but Wellington had insufficient support to form a ministry and the King&#x27;s popularity sank to an all-time low. Mud was slung at his carriage and he was publicly hissed. The King agreed to reappoint Grey&#x27;s ministry, and to create new peers if the House of Lords continued to pose difficulties. Concerned by the threat of the creations, most of the bill&#x27;s opponents abstained and the Reform Act 1832 was passed. The mob blamed William&#x27;s actions on the influence of his wife and brother, and his popularity recovered.

=== Foreign policy ===
William distrusted foreigners, particularly anyone French, which he acknowledged as a &quot;prejudice&quot;. He also felt strongly that Britain should not interfere in the internal affairs of other states, which brought him into conflict with the interventionist foreign secretary, Lord Palmerston. William supported Belgian independence and, after unacceptable Dutch and French candidates were put forward, favoured Prince Leopold of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, the widower of his niece Charlotte, as a candidate for the newly created Belgian throne.

Though he had a reputation for tactlessness and buffoonery, William could be shrewd and diplomatic. He foresaw that the potential construction of a canal at Suez would make good relations with Egypt vital to Britain. Later in his reign, he flattered the American ambassador at a dinner by announcing that he regretted not being &quot;born a free, independent American, so much did he respect that nation, which had given birth to George Washington, the greatest man that ever lived&quot;. By exercising his personal charm, William assisted in the repair of Anglo-American relations, which had been so deeply damaged during the reign of his father.

=== King of Hanover ===
Public perception in Germany was that Britain dictated Hanoverian policy. This was not the case. In 1832, Austrian chancellor Klemens von Metternich introduced laws that curbed fledgling liberal movements in Germany. Lord Palmerston opposed this, and sought William&#x27;s influence to cause the Hanoverian government to take the same position. The Hanoverian government instead agreed with Metternich, much to Palmerston&#x27;s dismay, and William declined to intervene. The conflict between William and Palmerston over Hanover was renewed the following year when Metternich called a conference of the German states, to be held in Vienna, and Palmerston wanted Hanover to decline the invitation. Instead, William&#x27;s brother Prince Adolphus, Viceroy of Hanover, accepted, backed fully by William. In 1833, William signed a new constitution for Hanover, which empowered the middle class, gave limited power to the lower classes, and expanded the role of the parliament. The constitution would later be revoked by his brother and successor in Hanover, King Ernest Augustus.

=== Later reign and death ===

For the remainder of his reign, William interfered actively in politics only once, in 1834, when he became the last British sovereign to choose a prime minister contrary to the will of Parliament. In 1834, the ministry was facing increasing unpopularity and Lord Grey retired; the home secretary, William Lamb, 2nd Viscount Melbourne, replaced him. Melbourne retained most Cabinet members, and his ministry retained an overwhelming majority in the House of Commons. Some members of the Government, however, were anathema to the King, and increasingly left-wing policies concerned him. The previous year Grey had already pushed through legislation reforming the Protestant Church of Ireland. The Church collected tithes throughout Ireland, supported multiple bishoprics and was wealthy. However, barely an eighth of the Irish population belonged to the Church of Ireland. In some parishes, there were no Church of Ireland members at all, but there was still a priest paid for by tithes collected from the local Catholics and Presbyterians, leading to charges that idle priests were living in luxury at the expense of Irish people living at the level of subsistence. Grey&#x27;s Act had reduced the number of bishoprics by half, abolished some of the sinecures and overhauled the tithe system. Further measures to appropriate the surplus revenues of the Church of Ireland were mooted by the more radical members of the Government, including Lord John Russell. The King had an especial dislike for Russell, calling him &quot;a dangerous little Radical.&quot;
In November 1834, the leader of the House of Commons and chancellor of the Exchequer, Lord Althorp, inherited a peerage, thus removing him from the Commons to the Lords. Melbourne had to appoint a new Commons leader and a new Chancellor (who by long custom, must be drawn from the Commons), but the only candidate whom Melbourne felt suitable to replace Althorp as Commons leader was Lord John Russell, whom William (and many others) found unacceptable due to his radical politics. William claimed that the ministry had been weakened beyond repair and used the removal of Lord Althorp—who had previously indicated that he would retire from politics upon becoming a peer—as the pretext for the dismissal of the entire ministry. With Lord Melbourne gone, William chose to entrust power to a Tory, Sir Robert Peel. Since Peel was then in Italy, the Duke of Wellington was provisionally appointed prime minister. When Peel returned and assumed leadership of the ministry for himself, he saw the impossibility of governing because of the Whig majority in the House of Commons. Consequently, Parliament was dissolved to force fresh elections. Although the Tories won more seats than in the previous election, they were still in the minority. Peel remained in office for a few months but resigned after a series of parliamentary defeats. Melbourne was reappointed as prime minister, remaining there for the rest of William&#x27;s reign, and the King was forced to accept Russell as Commons leader.

The King had a mixed relationship with Lord Melbourne. Melbourne&#x27;s government mooted more ideas to introduce greater democracy, such as the devolution of powers to the Legislative Council of Lower Canada, which greatly alarmed the King, who feared it would eventually lead to the loss of the colony. At first, the King bitterly opposed these proposals. William exclaimed to Lord Gosford, Governor General-designate of Canada: &quot;Mind what you are about in Canada ... mind me, my Lord, the Cabinet is not my Cabinet; they had better take care or by God, I will have them impeached.&quot; When William&#x27;s son Augustus enquired of his father whether the King would be entertaining during Ascot week, William gloomily replied, &quot;I cannot give any dinners without inviting the ministers, and I would rather see the devil than any one of them in my house.&quot; Nevertheless, William approved the Cabinet&#x27;s recommendations for reform. Despite his disagreements with Melbourne, the King wrote warmly to congratulate the prime minister when he triumphed in the adultery case brought against him concerning Caroline Norton—he had refused to permit Melbourne to resign when the case was first brought. The King and Lord Melbourne eventually found a &quot;modus vivendi&quot;, with Melbourne applying tact and firmness when called for and William realising that his prime minister was far less radical in his politics than the King had feared.

Both the King and Queen were fond of their niece, Princess Alexandrina Victoria of Kent. Their attempts to forge a close relationship with the girl were frustrated by the conflict between the King and Victoria&#x27;s widowed mother, the Duchess of Kent and Strathearn. The King, angered at what he took to be disrespect from the Duchess to his wife, took the opportunity at what proved to be his final birthday banquet in August 1836 to settle the score. Speaking to those assembled at the banquet, who included the Duchess and Princess Victoria, William expressed his hope that he would survive until Victoria was 18 so that the Duchess would never be regent. He said, &quot;I trust to God that my life may be spared for nine months longer ... I should then have the satisfaction of leaving the exercise of the Royal authority to the personal authority of that young lady, heiress presumptive to the Crown, and not in the hands of a person now near me, who is surrounded by evil advisers and is herself incompetent to act with propriety in the situation in which she would be placed.&quot; The speech was so shocking that Victoria burst into tears, while her mother sat in silence and was only with difficulty persuaded not to leave immediately after dinner (the two left the next day). William&#x27;s outburst undoubtedly contributed to Victoria&#x27;s tempered view of him as &quot;a good old man, though eccentric and singular&quot;. William survived, though mortally ill, to the month after Victoria&#x27;s coming of age. &quot;Poor old man!&quot;, Victoria wrote as he was dying, &quot;I feel sorry for him; he was always personally kind to me.&quot;
William was &quot;very much shaken and affected&quot; by the death of his eldest daughter, Sophia, Lady de L&#x27;Isle and Dudley, in childbirth in April 1837. William and his eldest son, the Earl of Munster, were estranged at the time, but William hoped that a letter of condolence from Munster signalled a reconciliation. His hopes were not fulfilled and Munster, still thinking he had not been given sufficient money or patronage, remained bitter to the end.

Queen Adelaide attended the dying William devotedly, not going to bed herself for more than ten days. William died in the early hours of the morning of 20 June 1837 at Windsor Castle, where he was buried in the Royal Vault at St George&#x27;s Chapel.

== Legacy ==

As William had no living legitimate issue, the British throne passed to his niece Victoria, the only legitimate child of Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, George III&#x27;s fourth son. Under Salic Law, a woman could not rule Hanover and so the Hanoverian throne went to George III&#x27;s fifth son, Ernest Augustus. William&#x27;s death thus ended the personal union of Britain and Hanover, which had persisted since 1714. The main beneficiaries of his will were his eight surviving children by Mrs Jordan. Although William is not the direct ancestor of the later monarchs of the United Kingdom, he has many notable descendants through his illegitimate children with Mrs Jordan, including British prime minister David Cameron, TV presenter Adam Hart-Davis, and author and statesman Duff Cooper.

William IV had a short but eventful reign. In Britain, the Reform Crisis marked the ascendancy of the House of Commons and the corresponding decline of the House of Lords, and the King&#x27;s unsuccessful attempt to remove the Melbourne ministry indicated a reduction in the political influence of the Crown and of the King&#x27;s influence over the electorate. During the reign of George III, the king could have dismissed one ministry, appointed another, dissolved Parliament, and expected the electorate to vote in favour of the new administration. Such was the result of a dissolution in 1784, after the dismissal of the Fox-North Coalition, and in 1807, after the dismissal of Lord Grenville. But when William dismissed the Melbourne ministry, the Tories under Peel failed to win the ensuing elections. The monarch&#x27;s ability to influence the opinion of the electorate, and therefore national policy, had been reduced. None of William&#x27;s successors has attempted to remove a government or to appoint another against the wishes of Parliament. William understood that as a constitutional monarch he had no power to act against the opinion of Parliament. He said, &quot;I have my view of things, and I tell them to my ministers. If they do not adopt them, I cannot help it. I have done my duty.&quot;

During William&#x27;s reign, the British Parliament enacted major reforms, including the Factory Act 1833 (preventing child labour), the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 (emancipating slaves in the colonies), and the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834 (standardising provision for the destitute). William attracted criticism both from reformers, who felt that reform did not go far enough, and from reactionaries, who felt that reform went too far. A modern interpretation sees him as failing to satisfy either political extreme by trying to find a compromise between two bitterly opposed factions, but in the process proving himself more capable as a constitutional monarch than many had supposed.

=== Arms ===
Before becoming king, William, as a son of the sovereign, was granted the use of the royal arms (without the electoral inescutcheon in the Hanoverian quarter) in 1781, differenced by a label of three points argent, the centre point bearing a cross gules, the outer points each bearing an anchor azure. In 1801 his arms altered with the royal arms, however the marks of difference remained the same.

As king, William used the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom undifferenced: Quarterly, I and IV Gules three lions passant guardant in pale Or (for England); II Or a lion rampant within a tressure flory-counter-flory Gules (for Scotland); III Azure a harp Or stringed Argent (for Ireland); overall an escutcheon tierced per pale and per chevron (for Hanover), I Gules two lions passant guardant Or (for Brunswick), II Or a semy of hearts Gules a lion rampant Azure (for Lüneburg), III Gules a horse courant Argent (for Westphalia), overall an inescutcheon Gules charged with the crown of Charlemagne Or, the whole escutcheon surmounted by a crown.

<text>Rebecca De Mornay (born August 29, 1959) is an American actress. Her breakthrough film role came in 1983, when she starred in &quot;Risky Business&quot;. De Mornay is also known for her roles in &quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1985), &quot;Runaway Train&quot; (1985), &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; (1985), &quot;Backdraft&quot; (1991), and &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot; (1992).

Her other film credits include &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; (1993), &quot;Never Talk to Strangers&quot; (1995), &quot;Identity&quot; (2003), &quot;Lords of Dogtown&quot;, &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot; (both 2005), and &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010). On television, she starred as Wendy Torrance in the miniseries adaptation of &quot;The Shining&quot; (1997), and as Dorothy Walker on Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; (2015–19).

==Early life==
De Mornay was born Rebecca Jane Pearch in Santa Rosa, California, the daughter of Julie and Wally George (né George Walter Pearch), a disc jockey and later television host. Her paternal grandmother was vaudeville performer and child film actress Eugenia Clinchard.

Her parents divorced in 1960, and she took the surname of her stepfather, Richard De Mornay, after her mother married him in 1961. She spent her early years in Pasadena, California, until her stepfather died of a stroke on March 2, 1962, aged 48. After his death, De Mornay and her half-brother Peter were raised by her mother, who relocated the family to Europe, where they lived in several different locations. She attended the independent Summerhill School in Leiston, Suffolk, England before completing her studies at a private high school in Germany.

== Career ==

By the time she was 16, De Mornay had an agent who was selling her songs to German rock &amp; roll musicians, and she had written the theme song for a kung fu movie called &quot;Goodbye Bruce Lee: His Last Game of Death&quot; (1975). In 1980, De Mornay returned to the United States and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Institute to study acting. She made her film debut with a small part in Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1981 film &quot;One from the Heart&quot;, which starred her real-life partner at the time, Harry Dean Stanton. Her star-making role came two years later in &quot;Risky Business&quot; (1983), as a call girl who seduces a high-school student played by Tom Cruise. In 1985, she played the title role in &quot;The Slugger&#x27;s Wife&quot; opposite Michael O&#x27;Keefe, and co-starred in &quot;The Trip to Bountiful&quot; and &quot;Runaway Train&quot;, both of which were nominated for several Academy Awards. That same year, she appeared with Starship&#x27;s Mickey Thomas in the music video for the song &quot;Sara&quot;. The song reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart on March 15, 1986.

She also appeared in Roger Vadim&#x27;s provocative 1988 remake of &quot;And God Created Woman&quot;, and as the wife of Kurt Russell&#x27;s character in Ron Howard&#x27;s &quot;Backdraft&quot; (1991). In 1990 she enacted the role of a USAF Captain pilot in HBO&#x27;s successful Cold War film &quot;By the Dawn&#x27;s Early Light&quot;. One of De Mornay&#x27;s most commercially successful films was the thriller &quot;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&quot;, released in 1992. She starred as a defense lawyer in Sidney Lumet&#x27;s murder drama &quot;Guilty as Sin&quot; (1993) with Don Johnson. Then she appeared in the 1995 drama film &quot;Never Talk to Strangers&quot; opposite Antonio Banderas, for which she was also the executive producer.

In 2003, she guest-starred as primary antagonist in the first two episodes of season 2 of &quot;Boomtown&quot;. In 2004, she guest-starred as attorney Hannah Rose for the last few episodes of &quot;The Practice&quot; and the following year, had a brief role alongside Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn in &quot;Wedding Crashers&quot;. De Mornay also starred in the 2007 drama &quot;American Venus&quot;.

In June 2007, she appeared in the HBO series &quot;John from Cincinnati&quot; with a starring role as matriarch of a troubled Imperial Beach, California, surfing family and the grandmother/guardian of a teen surfer on the brink of greatness. She appeared in Darren Lynn Bousman&#x27;s &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day&quot; (2010).

In 2012, De Mornay played the role of Finch&#x27;s mom in the movie &quot;American Reunion&quot; where she portrayed an attractive older woman and a love interest of Stifler. From 2015 to 2019, she appeared in &quot;Jessica Jones&quot; as Trish Walker&#x27;s abusive mother.

==Personal life==
De Mornay dated actor Harry Dean Stanton in the early 1980s. They met in 1981 on the set of &quot;One from the Heart&quot; and dated until De Mornay and Tom Cruise began an affair while filming &quot;Risky Business&quot; in 1982. De Mornay and Cruise parted in 1985.

De Mornay married writer Bruce Wagner on December 16, 1986; they divorced in 1990.

De Mornay subsequently dated and was briefly engaged to singer Leonard Cohen. She co-produced Cohen&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;The Future&quot;, which is also dedicated to her.

De Mornay was in a relationship with actor turned sportscaster Patrick O&#x27;Neal. They have two daughters together.

<doc id="43274" wikidata="Q464009" url="?curid=43274" title="Knight Rider (1982 TV series)">
<text>Knight Rider is an American action crime drama television series created and produced by Glen A. Larson. The series was originally broadcast on NBC from September 26, 1982, to April 4, 1986. The show stars David Hasselhoff as Michael Knight, a sleek and modern crime fighter assisted by KITT, an advanced, artificially intelligent, self-aware, and nearly indestructible car. This was the last series Larson devised at Universal Television before he moved to 20th Century Fox Television. The series received mixed to negative reviews from critics.

==Plot==
Self-made billionaire Wilton Knight rescues police Detective Lieutenant Michael Arthur Long after a near-fatal shot to the face, giving him a new identity (by plastic surgery) and a new name: Michael Knight. Wilton selects Michael to be the primary field agent in the pilot program of his public justice organization, the Foundation for Law and Government (FLAG). The other half of this pilot program is the Knight Industries Two Thousand (KITT), a heavily modified, technologically advanced Pontiac Firebird Trans Am with numerous features, including a highly durable shell and frame, controlled by a computer with artificial intelligence. Michael and KITT are brought in during situations where &quot;direct action might provide the only feasible solution&quot;.

Heading FLAG is Devon Miles, who takes over after Wilton&#x27;s demise and provides Michael with directives and guidance. Dr. Bonnie Barstow (season 1, 3 and 4) and April Curtis (season 2) are the chief engineers in charge of KITT&#x27;s care and act as a technical assistant to Devon.

==Cast and characters==
* David Hasselhoff as Michael Knight (born Michael Arthur Long), an undercover detective of the Los Angeles Police Department who, while on a case in Las Vegas, is shot in the face and nearly killed. Wilton Knight, creator of Knight Industries and founder of FLAG, directs his doctors to save Long&#x27;s life and reconstruct his face. With his new identity, &quot;Michael Knight&quot;, Long is provided with high tech crime-fighting equipment, most notably the car named KITT.
: Hasselhoff also played Garthe Knight, Wilton Knight&#x27;s estranged son and a criminal mastermind who drives Goliath, a Peterbilt 352 Pacemaker semi-truck armed with rockets, and protected by KITT&#x27;s Molecular Bonded Shell.
* William Daniels as the voice of KITT, or Knight Industries Two Thousand, the autonomous, artificially intelligent car, with whom Michael Knight is partnered. Daniels, who simultaneously starred on &quot;St. Elsewhere,&quot; requested not to be credited for his role as KITT&#x27;s voice.
* Edward Mulhare as Devon Miles, the leader of FLAG, who appeared in every episode to provide mission details to Knight and KITT. He was also the spokesman for FLAG whenever it came under scrutiny.
* Patricia McPherson as Dr. Bonnie Barstow (Seasons 1, 3–4), KITT&#x27;s chief technician and romantic tension for Michael. The character was dropped after the first season, but due to strong fan reaction and lobbying by Hasselhoff and Mulhare, she was returned for the third season and remained through the end of the series.
* Rebecca Holden as April Curtis (Season 2), chief technician for KITT. The character was written out when Patricia McPherson returned. The connection between the two was never established in any installments.
* Peter Parros as Reginald Cornelius III aka RC3 (Season 4), A former street vigilante who becomes the driver of the FLAG mobile unit and occasional partner for Michael and KITT.
* Richard Basehart as Wilton Knight, the founder of FLAG, who dies in the pilot episode. Basehart&#x27;s voice, however, is heard throughout the series, narrating over the intro and outro.

==Production==
===Vehicle===

The car used as KITT in the series was a customized 1982 Pontiac Firebird Trans Am, that cost US$100,000 to build (). The nose and dashboard of the car were designed by design consultant Michael Scheffe.

Stuntman Jack Gill says KITT&#x27;s ride height was dropped 1.5 inches (4 cm) from a stock Trans Am. The hero car was the only vehicle that contained the intricate dashboard. Spare cars were always on hand, and Universal eventually did all of the modifications that were needed. A mock up dashboard was used on a sound stage for closeups of the voice box or other buttons.

Glen Larson wanted the talking muscle car to have a heartbeat and asked Scheffe to design a beam of light like the Cylons had in &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; to be used on the front of the vehicle. The Pontiac&#x27;s nose was eventually extended slightly.

Gill said that the studio got the cars from Pontiac for $1 apiece, but Pontiac often gave the studio vehicles that had already been damaged from a train derailment. The only car Universal had to pay for was the hero car.

For the scenes in which KITT appeared to be driving without a driver, Gill would sit behind the driver&#x27;s seat. Gill would extend his arms and legs through the seat out of sight. A two-way mirror was created that hid Gill during scenes where KITT appeared to be driving solo. KITT was never seen driving for long periods of time solo because of the difficulty of shooting it.

William Daniels, the voice of KITT, would record his lines after the majority of the episode was filmed. Hasselhoff would work with an assistant off-camera who would read him KITT&#x27;s lines. If KITT was in motion during filming, the lines would be read to Hasselhoff through the car stereo. The vehicle was usually towed during scenes when Hasselhoff appeared to be driving.

The studio held a marketing campaign for &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. Fans could write to the network and they would receive a pamphlet detailing some features about KITT. The first campaign was held in August 1982. The pamphlet said, &quot;The Competition is NO Competition!&quot; KITT was pictured parked alongside a vehicle that resembled the General Lee from &quot;The Dukes of Hazzard&quot;.

===Soundtrack===
The &quot;Knight Rider Theme&quot; was composed by Stu Phillips and Glen A. Larson. The series DVD bonus material contains an interview about this lead music, where Glen A. Larson says he remembers a theme out of a classical piece (&quot;Marche Et Cortège De Bacchus&quot; Act III – No. 14 from &quot;Sylvia&quot; written by French composer Léo Delibes) from which he took pieces for the &quot;Knight Rider Theme&quot;. The decision to use synthesizers was largely a network decision. Larson claims that they used five or six synthesizers, drums and a Fender bass.

The rest of the series music was composed by Stu Phillips for 13 episodes and Don Peake for 75 episodes. Glen A. Larson co-wrote music for one episode and Morton Stevens wrote the music for one episode. Peake took over scoring duties with the 14th episode of season 1, &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;, in 1983, when Larson moved to Twentieth Century-Fox and Phillips was working there on his projects. Peake remained as the series sole composer until the end of the series in 1986.

In 2005, FSM released a disc of music from the series, featuring the series theme, ad bumpers and Phillips&#x27; scores for &quot;Knight of the Phoenix&quot; (the pilot), &quot;Not a Drop to Drink&quot;, &quot;Trust Doesn&#x27;t Rust&quot;, &quot;Forget Me Not&quot; and the composer&#x27;s final episode &quot;Inside Out&quot;, as well as the logo music for Glen Larson Productions. Albums of Don Peake&#x27;s scores have also been issued.

==Episodes==

The intro throughout most of the episodes began with this narration: 
During the first season, the outro was Michael and KITT driving on a road in the desert with Wilton Knight&#x27;s words of &quot;One man can make a difference, Michael.&quot; These words were phased out after episode 7, &quot;Not A Drop To Drink&quot;.

Then the narration goes on to say: 
The outro of seasons 2 and 3 was Michael and KITT driving away from the sunset toward the camera. Season 4&#x27;s outro was the same, except with KITT in Super Pursuit Mode.

==Critical reception==
At the time of its release, &quot;Knight Rider&quot; received mixed to negative reviews. At review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the first season scores 35%, based mainly on archived contemporaneous reviews, with an average rating of 5.60/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;This car can do anything -- except paper over how tiresomely silly &quot;Knight Rider&quot;&#x27;s concept is.&quot; Tom Shales, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, commented: Knight Rider&#x27; is all revved up but has no place to go, except, maybe, headlong into a large brick wall.&quot; In contrast, retrospective reviews have been more positive. Marc Bernardin of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called the show &quot;a relic from a simpler time, when audiences demanded less from their TV&quot;.

==Syndication and home media==
===In syndication===
&quot;Knight Rider&quot; was first syndicated in the U.S. in the fall of 1986. Stations were initially offered either the original hour-long format (with three minutes cut from each episode), or severely-condensed into half-hour format. Reruns were later syndicated on USA Network in 1994, Sci-Fi Channel in 2003, Sleuth in 2005, and on G4 in 2012.

===DVD releases===
Universal Studios has released all four seasons of &quot;Knight Rider&quot; on DVD in regions 1, 2 &amp; 4. A complete series box set featuring all 90 episodes in a collector&#x27;s edition box has been released in regions 1 &amp; 2.

On March 8, 2016, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1; they subsequently re-released the first two seasons on DVD on May 3, 2016. On October 4, 2016, Mill Creek re-released &quot;Knight Rider - The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1&quot;.&quot;

===Blu-Ray releases===
In Japan, NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan—a subsidiary of NBCUniversal—released a Blu-ray box set containing all four seasons, replicas, props, and memorabilia under the title ナイトライダー コンプリート ブルーレイBOX (&quot;Knight Rider: The Complete Series&quot;). The set is limited to Region Code A, which includes the U.S. It was released on November 27, 2014.

In North America, Mill Creek Entertainment released the complete series on Blu-ray in Region 1 on October 4, 2016.

On December 30, 2022, the German company Turbine Medien worked with Universal to put together &quot;Knight Rider: The 40th Anniversary Edition Blu-Ray Collection&quot;. This set is a restored uncut version with the original music when it first aired on NBC. The series is on twenty discs, with three bonus discs, and includes bonus features about the series and the &quot;Knight Rider 2000&quot; and &quot;Knight Rider 2010&quot; movies in SD. Also in SD are all 22 episodes of the series &quot;Team Knight Rider&quot;. This set was a limited edition. Only 3,939 copies were made.

On November 10, 2023, Turbine Medien made a smaller release called &quot;Knight Rider: The Special Edition Set&quot;, which includes the first twenty uncut episode Blu-ray discs and the first bonus discs with the interviews.

===Digital streaming===
The series was available for streaming on Netflix and Peacock, but is no longer streaming on any major streaming service as of May 2024. It can be purchased on Prime Video, Apple TV and YouTube.

==Spin-offs and sequels==

These adventures were continued with the television films &quot;Knight Rider 2000&quot; and &quot;Knight Rider 2010&quot; and the short-lived &quot;Team Knight Rider&quot;. One other television movie, &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, served as a pilot for the 2008 television series &quot;Knight Rider&quot;. In 1985, a spin-off series, &quot;Code of Vengeance&quot;, also premiered.

In 1988, Angelo di Marco made a French comic strip based on the series, titled &quot;K2000&quot; and published by Dargaud.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Knight Rider&quot; theme has been sampled in the songs &quot;Clock Strikes&quot; by Timbaland &amp; Magoo featuring Mad Skillz from the album &quot;Welcome to Our World&quot; (1998), &quot;Turn It Up (Remix) / Fire It Up&quot; by Busta Rhymes from the album &quot;When Disaster Strikes...&quot; (1997), and &quot;Mundian To Bach Ke&quot; by Panjabi MC from the album &quot;Legalised&quot; (1998). It was also featured as Ted (Seth MacFarlane)&#x27;s ringtone for John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg)&#x27;s phone in the 2012 comedy film &quot;Ted&quot;.

Zen Studios released a digital pinball table inspired by &quot;Knight Rider&quot; as part of the Universal Pinball: TV Classics downloadable content with other well-known nostalgic hit NBCUniversal TV shows like &quot;&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

An annual was published each year in the UK by Grandreams. These books consisted of a mix of text stories and cartoon strips, as well as photos and articles on the show&#x27;s stars and KITT. There were five annuals produced in total, each reflecting the season of the show that was airing at the time, with the final two releases covering the final season. (The last annual was printed in a quite small quantity, due to the fading popularity of the show, and is thus considerably rarer.)

<doc id="43277" wikidata="Q17247" url="?curid=43277" title="Abalone (board game)">
<text>Abalone is a two-player abstract strategy board game designed by Michel Lalet and Laurent Lévi in 1987. Players are represented by opposing black and white marbles on a hexagonal board with the objective of pushing six of the opponent&#x27;s marbles off the edge of the board.

&quot;Abalone&quot; was published in 1990 and has sold more than 4.5 million units. The year it was published it received one of the first Mensa Select awards. It is currently sold in more than thirty countries.

== Gameplay ==

=== Rules ===
The board consists of 61 circular spaces arranged in a hexagon, five on a side. Each player has 14 marbles that rest in the spaces and are initially arranged as shown below, on the left image. The players take turns with the black marbles moving first. For each move, a player moves a straight line of one, two or three marbles of one color one space in one of six directions. The move can be either &quot;broadside / arrow-like&quot; (parallel to the line of marbles) or &quot;in-line / in a line&quot; (serial in respect to the line of marbles), as illustrated below.

A player can push their opponent&#x27;s marbles (a &quot;sumito&quot;) that are in a line to their own with an in-line move only. They can only push if the pushing line has more marbles than the pushed line (three can push one or two; two can push one). Marbles must be pushed to an empty space (i.e. not blocked by a marble) or off the board. The winner is the first player to push six of the opponent&#x27;s marbles off of the edge of the board.

=== Move notation ===
The notation for recording moves gives the letters A-I to the horizontal lines, and the numbers 1–9 to northwest–southeast diagonals.

 I O O O O O
 H O O O O O O
 G + + O O O + +
 F + + + + + + + +
 E + + + + + + + + +
 D + + + + + + + + 9
 C + + @ @ @ + + 8
 B @ @ @ @ @ @ 7
 A @ @ @ @ @ 6
 1 2 3 4 5

One popular notation:
an inline move can be denoted by the movement of the trailing marble (the &quot;caboose&quot;);
broadside moves can be denoted by the initial positions of the two extremities of the &quot;lance&quot; followed by the final position of the first marble (with this notation, each broadside move has two notations possible, which could be avoided).

=== Avoiding draws ===

The dynamics of the basic game may have one serious flaw: it seems that a good but conservative player can set up their marbles in a defensive wedge and ward off all attacks indefinitely. An attacker may try to outflank this wedge or lure it into traps, but such advances are often more dangerous to the attacker than the defender. Thus, from the starting position, it takes little skill and no imagination to avoid losing, and nothing in the rules prevents games from being interminable.

Because it is boring for games to be drawn out indefinitely, serious &quot;Abalone&quot; players tacitly agree to play aggressively. A player who forms a defensive wedge and makes no attempt to attack is likely to be a novice who might lose anyway. Nevertheless, there remains the possibility of any competent player bringing the game to a standstill and successfully avoiding losing, even to a championship-level player.

There are several possible &quot;solutions&quot;. First, in tournaments, a judge may penalize a player for playing defensively. This solution is somewhat unsatisfactory, given that a judge may not always be present, and that &quot;defensive play&quot; is subjective.

Second, several variations of the rules have been developed for the same board and marbles. None of the variations has the same appealing simplicity of the original.

The third, and perhaps best, alternative starting positions have been designed to make the formation of stalemate wedges less likely. Experiments are still underway to find an opening position which neither devolves to a draw nor gives too great an advantage to the first player. One popular attempt are the &quot;Marguerite&quot; or Daisy positions, two versions of which are displayed in the center and to the right.

Another option is to create a &quot;turn limit&quot; where if no marble has been knocked off the board by turn 15, whoever has made the most progress towards the center line wins. This encourages an aggressive strategy of moving forward and often the rule will not come into play.
=== Rule variations and more players ===
&quot;Abalone&quot; can be played by three or more people using the same board with fewer marbles for each player and each player has a different color.

A number of two-player variations use a third color for passive pieces. For example, the variation called &quot;The Pillar&quot; (with a fixed marble in the centre of the board), which has been examined to some depth by Alex Borello and Nicolas Le Gal, uses a third color. Another possible variation involves either player winning the game by ejecting the central marble.

A few variations use a second layer of marbles.

== Strategy ==
Forums of &quot;Abalone&quot; communities have found that, generally:
* Keep the marbles close to the centre of the board and force the opponent to move to the edges.
* Keep the marbles close together for increased defense and attack, especially in a hexagon shape to be able to push or defend in any direction.
* Pushing the opponent off the board is not usually a good idea if it leads to weaknesses in the player&#x27;s geometry.
* Setting a &quot;trap&quot; by making a marble weak in one direction allows for opponent to weaken center defenses.

== Champions ==

Gert Schnider and Thomas Fenner participated in the evaluation and adjustment of AbaPro. Marc Tastet was the 1992 World Othello Champion, Stephane Nicolet is a two-time World Othello Championship finalist, and Jan Stastna is a strong Othello player.

In a computer-to-computer competition held in 2003 at the International Computer Games Association (ICGA) events in Graz, Austria, the AbaPro program defeated the Nacre program.

In 1999, a number of top players from the Mind Sports Olympiad signed an agreement to use a different starting position (the Belgian daisy) to revitalize the game. This has been used for top tournaments since then, including the AbaCup.

==Reception==
In the February–March 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 13), Mike Siggins called the components &quot;of good quality&quot;, and the rules &quot;extremely concise.&quot; He found the game very replayable, and commented that &quot;it has the potential to become a classic.&quot; His only complaint was that &quot;as players become more proficient the game can slow up and stalemates often result.&quot; Despite this, Siggins gave the game an above-average rating of 8 out of 10, saying, &quot;&quot;Abalone&quot; is one of the best abstract games to appear in a long while.&quot;

<text>Gráinne O&#x27;Malley (, ; – ), also known as Grace O&#x27;Malley, was the head of the Ó Máille dynasty in the west of Ireland, and the daughter of Eóghan Dubhdara Ó Máille.

Upon her father&#x27;s death, she took over active leadership of the lordship by land and sea, despite having a brother, Dónal an Phíopa Ó Máille. Marriage to Dónal an Chogaidh (Donal &quot;of the war&quot;) Ó Flaithbheartaigh brought her greater wealth and influence, reportedly owning as much as 1,000 head of cattle and horses. In 1593, when her sons Tibbot Bourke and Murchadh Ó Flaithbheartaigh (Murrough O&#x27;Flaherty) and her half-brother Dónal an Phíopa (&quot;Donal of the Pipes&quot;) were taken captive by the English governor of Connacht, Sir Richard Bingham, O&#x27;Malley sailed to England to petition for their release. She formally presented her request to Queen Elizabeth I at her court in Greenwich Palace.

O&#x27;Malley is not mentioned in the Irish annals, so documentary evidence for her life comes mostly from English sources, especially the eighteen &quot;Articles of Interrogatory&quot;, questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I. She is mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind.

In Irish folklore she is commonly known as Gráinne Mhaol (anglicised as Granuaile) and is a well-known historical figure in sixteenth-century Irish history. Her name was also rendered in contemporaneous English documents in various ways, including Gráinne O&#x27;Maly, Graney O&#x27;Mally, Granny ni Maille, Grany O&#x27;Mally, Grayn Ny Mayle, Grane ne Male, Grainy O&#x27;Maly, and Granee O&#x27;Maillie, rarely as Grace O&#x27;Malley. In popular culture, she is often referred to as &quot;The Pirate Queen&quot;.

==Early life==
O&#x27;Malley was born in Ireland around 1530, when Henry VIII was King of England and held the title Lord of Ireland. Under the policies of the English government at the time, the semi-autonomous Irish clans were left mostly to their own devices. However, this was to change over the course of O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s life as the Tudor conquest of Ireland gathered pace.

Eoghan Dubhdara Ó Máille, her father, and his family were based in Clew Bay, County Mayo. He was Chief of the Name of Clan Ó Máille and Lord of Umhaill, and claimed descent from Maille mac Conall. The Uí Mháille were one of the seafaring clans of Connacht, and they had built a row of castles facing the sea to protect their territory. They controlled most of what is now the barony of Murrisk in south-west County Mayo and recognised as their nominal overlords the Mac William Íochtar branch of the Bourkes, who controlled much of what is now County Mayo. The Bourke family (Irish: d&quot;e Búrca&quot;) were originally Anglo-Norman (de Burgh) but by O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s lifetime had become completely Gaelicised. Her mother, Margaret or Maeve, was also an O&#x27;Malley. Although she was the only child of Dubhdara and his wife, O&#x27;Malley had a paternal half-brother called Dónal na Píopa. Although under Brehon Law only male members of the derbhfine could inherit the mantle of Chief of the Name through tanistry, O&#x27;Malley &quot;was considered to be the legal retainer of the family land and seafaring activities&quot;.

With shore castles like Carrickkildavnet, the Clan Uí Mháille demanded and received black rent from those who fished off their coasts, which included fishermen from as far away as England. The head of the family was known simply by his surname as Ó Máille (anglicised as The O&#x27;Malley). The local oral tradition has it that O&#x27;Malley, as a young girl, wished to go on a trading expedition to Spain with her father. Upon being told she could not because her long hair would catch in the ship&#x27;s ropes, she cut off most of her hair to shame her father into taking her. This earned her the nickname &quot;Gráinne Mhaol&quot; (; from &quot;maol&quot;, meaning &#x27;bald&#x27; or &#x27;having cropped hair&#x27;), usually anglicised as Granuaile ( ). The nickname may also come from &quot;Gráinne Umhaill&quot; (&quot;Gráinne of Umhall&quot;, Umhall being a historical district of west Connacht dominated by the Uí Mháille).

As a child she most likely lived at her family&#x27;s residence of Belclare and Clare Island, but she may have been fostered by another family, as fosterage was traditional among the Gaelic nobility of Ireland.

==Marriage to Ó Flaithbheartaigh ==

O&#x27;Malley was married in 1546 to Dónal an Chogaidh Ó Flaithbheartaigh, &quot;tánaiste&quot; or heir to the Chief of the Name of Clan Ó Flaithbheartaigh, which would have been a good political match for the daughter of the Chief of Clan Ó Máille. As Ó Flaithbheartaigh &quot;tánaiste&quot;, Dónal an Chogaidh had expectations of one day ruling as Lord of Iar Connacht, which was roughly equivalent to modern Connemara.

She bore three children during her marriage to Dónal an Chogaidh:
* Eóghan (Owen): The eldest child, known to be kind and forgiving. Sir Richard Bingham tricked him; Owen was murdered as a result, and Bingham and his troops took over his castle.
* Méadhbh (Maeve): Said to be much like her mother, she married Richard &quot;the Devils Hook&quot; Bourke, 22nd Mac William Íochtar (d.1601) with whom she had several children. O&#x27;Malley and Bourke were supposedly very close, more than once he saved her from death.
* Murchadh (Murrough): Murrough was said to take after his father, for he enjoyed warfare. He often beat his sister Maeve, and refused to listen to his mother because of her sex. Many sources report that he betrayed his family and joined forces with Sir Richard Bingham after the murder of Owen. When O&#x27;Malley heard of this she swore she would never speak to Murrough again for the rest of her life, though she would often insult him. After Dónal an Chogaidh&#x27;s death, O&#x27;Malley left Iar Connacht and returned to Umhaill, taking with her many Clan Ó Flaithbheartaigh warriors.

In 1564, Dónal&#x27;s ambitions were dashed when his kinsman Murrough na dTuadh Ó Flaithbheartaigh was appointed by Queen Elizabeth as Chief of the Name instead of him. In 1565, Dónal was killed in an ambush while hunting in the hills surrounding Lough Corrib. His assassination was, undoubtedly, part of Dónal&#x27;s wider struggle against Clan Joyce for control of Hen&#x27;s Castle upon the lough. When the Joyces moved to take the Castle, thinking that Gráinne would not resist, she fought back successfully and forced Clan Joyce to retreat. O&#x27;Malley then returned to her own lands and established her principal residence upon Clare Island (now called Granuaile&#x27;s Castle). She allegedly took a shipwrecked sailor as her lover. The affair lasted only briefly as he was killed by Clan MacMahon of Ballyvoy. Seeking vengeance, O&#x27;Malley attacked Clan MacMahon&#x27;s stronghold of Doona Castle in Blacksod Bay and slew her lover&#x27;s murderers upon Caher Island. Her veangence against Clan MacMahon earned Gráinne the nickname the &#x27;Dark Lady of Doona&#x27;.

==Marriage to Bourke==

By 1566, O&#x27;Malley had married a second time, this time to Risdeárd an Iarainn (&quot;Iron Richard&quot;) Bourke, 18th Mac William Íochtar (d.1583), his nickname deriving from his ironworks at Burrishoole, the place of his principal castle and residence. Tibbot, 1st Viscount Mayo, was a child of this marriage.

Still not satisfied with her revenge, O&#x27;Malley then sailed for Ballycroy and attacked the garrison at Doona Castle, overpowering the defenders and taking the castle for herself. Her attack against the MacMahons was not the first time she interrupted someone at their prayers. Legend tells of another lord who stole property from her and fled to a church for sanctuary. She was determined to wait out the thief, maintaining that he could starve or surrender. The thief dug a tunnel and escaped, however, and the hermit who took care of the church broke his vow of silence to scold her for attempting to harm someone who had sought sanctuary. Her reply is not recorded.

More than twenty years after her death, an English Lord Deputy of Ireland recalled her ability as a leader of fighting men, noting the fame she still had among the Irish people.

==Autonomous status==
In 1576, O&#x27;Malley engaged in the surrender and regrant process with the Lord Deputy Sir Henry Sidney in respect of her lands. Because Rockfleet was over a week&#x27;s march from Dublin, and as she was so often at sea, control by the Crown was very weak.

In 1593, in his letter to protest O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s claims against him, Sir Richard Bingham claimed that she was &quot;nurse to all rebellions in the province for this forty years&quot;. Bingham was Lord President of Connacht, tasked with controlling local lords who had, until then, been mostly autonomous.

O&#x27;Malley had every reason, and used every opportunity, to limit the power of the Kingdom of Ireland over her part of the country. An expedition from Galway led by Sheriff William Óge Martyn attacked her castle at Clare Island in March 1579. However, they were put to flight and barely escaped.

==Meeting with Elizabeth==

In the late 16th century, English power steadily grew in Ireland and O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s power was steadily encroached upon. In June 1593, O&#x27;Malley sent a petition to the Queen. She asked her &quot;to grant her some reasonable maintenance for the little tyme she hath to live&quot;. In return she offered &quot;a surrender at her hands&quot; of the lands of her two sons and those of her two surviving Bourke nephews. She asked for &quot;free libertye during her lyve to envade with sword and fire all your highness enemyes wheresoever they are or shall be ... without any interruption of any person or persons whatsoever&quot;. In May 1593, Hugh Maguire (Lord of Fermanagh) rebelled and burned Ballymote, then under the control of Sir George Bingham. One of Maguire&#x27;s men was captured and implicated Grace&#x27;s son Tibbott-ne-Long in a wider Tyrone- inspired conspiracy against the English. Tibbott was promptly captured by Sir Richard Bingham, sent to Athlone prison and charged with treason. Grace&#x27;s half-brother Dónal na Píopa was also arrested by Sir Richard Bingham and charged with the murder of some English soldiers. Grace sailed to England to petition Queen Elizabeth I for their release. She was accompanied by Sir-Murrough-ne-Doe O&#x27;Flaherty.
Sir Richard Bingham implied that Grace sailed her own ship to England as he stated she brought over the son of Ulick Bourke of Erris and her grandnephew, the son of Tibbott Reagh Bourke who &quot;attended uppon Grany O&#x27;Maille in her late beyinge at court&quot;. The Earl of Ormond, cousin and favourite of the Queen, gave Grace an introduction to Lord Burghley, chief advisor to the Queen. Burghley sent O&#x27;Malley a list of questions, &quot;eighteen articles of interrogatory&quot; which were answered and returned.

At around the same time, Sir Richard Bingham wrote to Burghley: &quot;There be 2 notable traitors gon over Sir Morrow ne doe and Grainy O’Maly both rebelle from their childhoode and continually in accion ... for notwithstanding that they have many pardons there ys matter ynough of late found out against them to hang them by justice&quot;.

Tradition but not the written sources states that O&#x27;Malley met with the Queen at Greenwich Palace, wearing a fine gown; the two of them were surrounded by guards and the members of Elizabeth&#x27;s royal court.

Many of what Anne Chambers refers to as &quot;fanciful tales&quot; have embellished the story of the meeting in Irish story-telling tradition. For example, O&#x27;Malley is said to have refused to bow before Elizabeth because she did not recognise her as the &quot;Queen of Ireland&quot;. It was said that she had a dagger concealed about her person, which guards found upon searching her. Elizabeth&#x27;s courtiers were said to be very upset and worried, but O&#x27;Malley informed the Queen that she carried it for her own safety. Elizabeth accepted this and seemed untroubled. It was said that O&#x27;Malley had sneezed and was given a lace-edged handkerchief from a noblewoman. She apparently blew her nose into it and then threw the cloth into a nearby fireplace, much to the shock of the court. O&#x27;Malley informed everyone that in Ireland, a used handkerchief was considered dirty and was properly destroyed.

The Queen ordered her Privy Council to seek an explanation from Sir Richard Bingham regarding his treatment of O&#x27;Malley and her family and to investigate how her situation could best be relieved. Bingham defended himself replying &quot;in defence of my own innocency ... to shew me instance of any one that ever I used violence against, havinge always (I thancke the Lord) had that consideracion of christian duty as I never sought any man&#x27;s bloode otherwise then by course of her Maties. comon lawes to take away.&quot; He made his thoughts clear that &quot;how great soevr any may make her wch knoweth her not I will nevr aske but a boat of xxx tonnes to beate her ... and wth gods assistance dryve her and all her fleet into the sea.&quot;

Towards the end of September 1593 the Queen wrote to Bingham ordering the release of Tibbott-ne-Long and Dónal-ne-Píopa from prison. She also ordered for provision to be made for Grace out of her sons&#x27; estates, the amount to be deducted from their crown taxes. She requested Bingham to allow them ownership of their lands and property and &quot;protect them to live in peace to enjoy their livelihoods&quot;. The Queen stated that O&#x27;Malley had &quot;departeth with great thankfulness and with many more earnest promises that she will, as long as she lives, continue a dutiful subject, yea and will employ all her power to offend and prosecute any offender against Us&quot;.

The leading authority on the life of Grace O&#x27;Malley, Anne Chambers, states that the conversation between the two women would have been in English as all the indications are that O&#x27;Malley could speak it, and not in Latin as often said.

==Last years==
Sir Richard Bingham disagreed with the decision of the Queen and initially did not obey her instructions, which O&#x27;Malley had personally delivered to him on her return to Ireland.

O&#x27;Malley had to threaten him &quot;that she would else repaire againe into England&quot; if he did not comply. Therefore, he reluctantly agreed, &quot;to enlarge Grany O&#x27;Mally, her son Tibbott and her brother Donal na Pippe, ... upon such slender surytes.&quot;

Grace O&#x27;Malley rebuilt her fleet with three large galleys and began to return to her former life. Bingham struck, quartering a troop of his soldiers on her ships to accompany her in her voyages and later forcing her into service against some of her own kinsmen who he claimed were in rebellion. Bingham quartered another detachment of his soldiers on Grace O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s property in Burishoole, leading to her impoverishment. Unable to bear the strain, she, her sons cousins and followers &quot;were forced to withdrawe themselves into the Province of Mounster, where they do remaine in great distresse&quot;. In April 1595 O&#x27;Malley sought the aid of the Earl of Ormond at his Elizabethan manor at Carrick-on-Suir. Ormond wrote to Burghley on her behalf. At some time between 17 April and 5 May she returned to England to plead her case with Burghley. O&#x27;Malley was rewarded when in August 1595, a commission was granted by the queen and the Privy Council to investigate the lands in Mayo claimed by her two sons, her grandson Dónal O&#x27;Flaherty, son of Owen, Dermot and Dónal O&#x27;Malley of &quot;Owel O&#x27;Maillie&quot;, and Miles MacEvilly, Tibbott-ne-Long&#x27;s foster-father, &quot;with the intention of the Queen accepting their surrenders of the premises and re-granting them by letters patent.&quot;

As the Nine Years&#x27; War escalated, O&#x27;Malley sought to retrench her position with the crown. On 18 April 1595 she petitioned Lord Burghley, complaining of the activities of troops and asking to hold her estate for Elizabeth I. She added that &quot;her sons, cousins, and followers will serve with a hundred men at their own charges at sea upon the coast of Ireland in Her Majesty&#x27;s wars upon all occasions ... to continue dutiful unto Her Majesty, as true and faithful subjects&quot;. Throughout the war she encouraged and supported her son Tibbot Bourke to fight for the Crown against Tyrone&#x27;s confederation of Irish lords.

In September 1595, there was a conspiracy against Sir Richard Bingham; he fled to England and was imprisoned. Sir Conyers Clifford was appointed Governor of Connaught.

She most likely died at Rockfleet Castle around 1603, the same year as Elizabeth&#x27;s death, though the year and place of O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s death are disputed. Her family&#x27;s usual burial place was in Clare Island Abbey.

==Biographical sources==
In her 2006 biography of O&#x27;Malley, Irish historian and novelist Anne Chambers described her as:

Documentary evidence for O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s life comes mostly from English sources, as she is not mentioned in the Irish annals. The Ó Máille family &quot;book&quot;, a collection of eulogistic bardic poetry and other material of the sort kept by aristocratic Gaelic households of the period, has not survived. There are no contemporary images of her. An important source of information is the eighteen &quot;Articles of Interrogatory&quot;, questions put to her in writing on behalf of Elizabeth I. She is also mentioned in the English State Papers and in other documents of the kind, an example being a letter sent by the Lord Deputy, Sir Henry Sidney, to his son Phillip in 1577: &quot;There came to mee a most famous femynyne sea captain called Grace Imallye, and offred her service unto me, wheresoever I woulde command her, with three gallyes and two hundred fightinge men ...&quot;

Local traditions concerning her were collected by Irish scholar John O&#x27;Donovan in the 1830s and 1840s on behalf of the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. In a letter of 1838, he describes her as being &quot;most vividly remembered by tradition and people were living in the last generation who conversed with people who knew her personally&quot;.

A story is recorded of O&#x27;Malley chiding her son Tíoboíd in the course of an attack on Kanturk Castle, when she thought he was shirking the battle: (&quot;Are you trying to hide in my arse, the place that you came out of?&quot;). She is also recorded as saying, with regard to her followers, (that she would rather have a shipload of Conroys and MacAnallys than a shipload of gold).

==Westport House==

Westport House in County Mayo, Ireland, was the seat of the Browne dynasty, Marquesses of Sligo, direct descendants of Grace O&#x27;Malley. The current house was built close to the site of Cahernamart ( – &quot;fort of the beef market&quot;), an Ó Máille fort. The original house was built by Colonel John Browne, a Jacobite, who was at the Siege of Limerick (1691), and his wife Maude Bourke. Maude Bourke was O&#x27;Malley&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter.

A statue of Grace O&#x27;Malley by the artist Michael Cooper – the brother-in-law of the 11th Marquess of Sligo – is on display in Westport House, and a bronze casting of the statue is situated on the grounds near the house. Westport House also contains an exhibition on the life of O&#x27;Malley compiled by the author Anne Chambers, who wrote a biography of Granuaile.

<text>The East India Company (EIC) was an English, and later British, joint-stock company that was founded in 1600 and dissolved in 1874. It was formed to trade in the Indian Ocean region, initially with the East Indies (South Asia and Southeast Asia), and later with East Asia. The company gained control of large parts of the Indian subcontinent and Hong Kong. At its peak, the company was the largest corporation in the world by various measures and had its own armed forces in the form of the company&#x27;s three presidency armies, totalling about 260,000 soldiers, twice the size of the British Army at certain times.

Originally chartered as the &quot;Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East-Indies,&quot; the company rose to account for half of the world&#x27;s trade during the mid-1700s and early 1800s, particularly in basic commodities including cotton, silk, indigo dye, sugar, salt, spices, saltpetre, tea, and later, opium. The company also initiated the beginnings of the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent.

The company eventually came to rule large areas of the Indian subcontinent, exercising military power and assuming administrative functions. Company-ruled areas in the region gradually expanded after the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and by 1858 most of modern India, Pakistan and Bangladesh was either ruled by the company or princely states closely tied to it by treaty. Following the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857, the Government of India Act 1858 led to the British Crown assuming direct control of present-day Bangladesh, Pakistan and India in the form of the new British Indian Empire.

The company subsequently experienced recurring problems with its finances, despite frequent government intervention. The company was dissolved in 1874 under the terms of the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act enacted one year earlier, as the Government of India Act had by then rendered it vestigial, powerless, and obsolete. The official government machinery of the British Empire had assumed its governmental functions and absorbed its armies.
== Origins ==

In 1577, Francis Drake set out on an expedition from England to plunder Spanish settlements in South America in search of gold and silver. Sailing in the &quot;Golden Hind&quot; he achieved this, and then sailed across the Pacific Ocean in 1579, known then only to the Spanish and Portuguese. Drake eventually sailed into the East Indies and came across the Moluccas, also known as the Spice Islands, and met Sultan Babullah. In exchange for linen, gold, and silver, the English obtained a large haul of exotic spices, including cloves and nutmeg. Drake returned to England in 1580 and became a hero; his circumnavigation raised an enormous amount of money for England&#x27;s coffers, and investors received a return of some 5,000 percent. Thus started an important element in the eastern design during the late sixteenth century.

Soon after the Spanish Armada&#x27;s defeat in 1588, the captured Spanish and Portuguese ships and cargoes enabled English voyagers to travel the globe in search of riches. London merchants presented a petition to Elizabeth I for permission to sail to the Indian Ocean. The aim was to deliver a decisive blow to the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly of far-eastern trade. Elizabeth granted her permission and in 1591, James Lancaster in the with two other ships, financed by the Levant Company, sailed from England around the Cape of Good Hope to the Arabian Sea, becoming the first English expedition to reach India that way. Having sailed around Cape Comorin to the Malay Peninsula, they preyed on Spanish and Portuguese ships there before returning to England in 1594.

The biggest prize that galvanised English trade was the seizure of a large Portuguese carrack, the &quot;Madre de Deus&quot;, by Walter Raleigh and the Earl of Cumberland at the Battle of Flores on 13 August 1592. When she was brought in to Dartmouth she was the largest vessel ever seen in England and she carried chests of jewels, pearls, gold, silver coins, ambergris, cloth, tapestries, pepper, cloves, cinnamon, nutmeg, benjamin (a highly aromatic balsamic resin used for perfumes and medicines), red dye, cochineal and ebony. Equally valuable was the ship&#x27;s rutter (mariner&#x27;s handbook) containing vital information on the China, India, and Japan trade routes.

In 1596, three more English ships sailed east but all were lost at sea. A year later however saw the arrival of Ralph Fitch, an adventurer merchant who, with his companions, had made a remarkable nine year overland journey to Mesopotamia, the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, India and Southeast Asia. Fitch was consulted on Indian affairs and gave even more valuable information to Lancaster.

==History ==

=== Formation ===
In 1599, a group of prominent merchants and explorers met to discuss a potential East Indies venture under a royal charter. Besides Fitch and Lancaster, the group included Stephen Soame, then Lord Mayor of London; Thomas Smythe, a powerful London politician and administrator who had established the Levant Company; Richard Hakluyt, writer and proponent of British colonisation of the Americas; and several other sea-farers who had served with Drake and Raleigh.

On 22 September, the group stated their intention &quot;to venture in the pretended voyage to the East Indies (the which it may please the Lord to prosper)&quot; and to themselves invest £30,133 (over £4,000,000 in today&#x27;s money). Two days later, the &quot;Adventurers&quot; reconvened and resolved to apply to the Queen for support of the project. Although their first attempt had not been completely successful, they sought the Queen&#x27;s unofficial approval to continue. They bought ships for the venture and increased their investment to £68,373.

They convened again a year later, on 31 December 1600, and this time they succeeded; the Queen responded favourably to a petition by George, Earl of Cumberland and 218 others, including James Lancaster, Sir John Harte, Sir John Spencer (both of whom had been Lord Mayor of London), the adventurer Edward Michelborne, the nobleman William Cavendish and other aldermen and citizens. She granted her charter to their corporation named Governor and Company of Merchants of London trading into the East Indies. For a period of fifteen years, the charter awarded the company a monopoly on English trade with all countries east of the Cape of Good Hope and west of the Straits of Magellan. Any traders there without a licence from the company were liable to forfeiture of their ships and cargo (half of which would go to the Crown and half to the company), as well as imprisonment at the &quot;royal pleasure&quot;.

The charter named Thomas Smythe as the first governor of the company, and 24 directors (including James Lancaster) or &quot;committees&quot;, who made up a Court of Directors. They, in turn, reported to a Court of Proprietors, who appointed them. Ten committees reported to the Court of Directors. By tradition, business was initially transacted at the Nags Head Inn, opposite St Botolph&#x27;s church in Bishopsgate, before moving to East India House on Leadenhall Street.

=== Early voyages to the East Indies ===
Sir James Lancaster commanded the first East India Company voyage in 1601 aboard . The following year, whilst sailing in the Malacca Straits, Lancaster took the rich 1,200 ton Portuguese carrack &quot;Sao Thome&quot; carrying pepper and spices. The booty enabled the voyagers to set up two &quot;factories&quot; (trading posts) – one at Bantam on Java and another in the Moluccas (Spice Islands) before leaving. On return to England in 1603, they learned of Elizabeth&#x27;s death, but Lancaster was knighted by the new king, James I, on account of the voyage&#x27;s success. By this time, the war with Spain had ended but the company had profitably breached the Spanish-Portuguese duopoly; new horizons opened for the English.

In March 1604, Sir Henry Middleton commanded the company&#x27;s second voyage. General William Keeling, a captain during the second voyage, led the third voyage aboard &quot;Red Dragon&quot; from 1607 to 1610 along with &quot;Hector&quot; under Captain William Hawkins and &quot;Consent&quot; under Captain David Middleton.

Early in 1608, Alexander Sharpeigh was made captain of the company&#x27;s &quot;Ascension&quot;, and general or commander of the fourth voyage. Thereafter two ships, &quot;Ascension&quot; and &quot;Union&quot; (captained by Richard Rowles), sailed from Woolwich on 14 March 1608. This expedition was lost.
Initially, the company struggled in the spice trade because of competition from the Dutch East India Company. This rivalry led to military skirmishes, with each company establishing fortified trading posts, fleets, and alliances with local rulers. The Dutch, better financed and supported by their government, gained the upper hand by establishing a stronghold in the spice islands (now Indonesia), enforcing a near-monopoly through aggressive policies that eventually drove the EIC to seek trade opportunities in India instead. The English company opened a factory (trading post) in Bantam on Java on its first voyage, and imports of pepper from Java remained an important part of the company&#x27;s trade for twenty years.


English traders frequently fought their Dutch and Portuguese counterparts in the Indian Ocean. The company achieved a major victory over the Portuguese in the Battle of Swally in 1612, at Suvali in Surat. The company decided to explore the feasibility of a foothold in mainland India, with official sanction from both Britain and the Mughal Empire, and requested that the Crown launch a diplomatic mission.

==== Foothold in India ====
Company ships docked at Surat in Gujarat in 1608. The company&#x27;s first Indian factory was established in 1611 at Masulipatnam on the Andhra Coast of the Bay of Bengal, and its second in 1615 at Surat. The high profits reported by the company after landing in India initially prompted James I to grant subsidiary licences to other trading companies in England. However, in 1609, he renewed the East India Company&#x27;s charter for an indefinite period, with the proviso that its privileges would be annulled if trade was unprofitable for three consecutive years.

In 1615, James I instructed Sir Thomas Roe to visit the Mughal Emperor Nur-ud-din Salim Jahangir (r. 1605–1627) to arrange for a commercial treaty that would give the company exclusive rights to reside and establish factories in Surat and other areas. In return, the company offered to provide the Emperor with goods and rarities from the European market. This mission was highly successful, and Jahangir sent a letter to James through Sir Thomas Roe:

==== Expansion in present day South Asia ====

The company, which benefited from the imperial patronage, soon expanded its commercial trading operations. It eclipsed the Portuguese Estado da Índia, which had established bases in Goa, Chittagong, and Bombay; Portugal later ceded Bombay to England as part of the dowry of Catherine of Braganza on her marriage to King Charles II. The East India Company also launched a joint attack with the Dutch United East India Company (VOC) on Portuguese and Spanish ships off the coast of China that helped secure EIC ports in China, independently attacking the Portuguese in the Persian Gulf Residencies primarily for political reasons. The company established trading posts in Surat (1619) and Madras (1639). By 1647, the company had 23 factories and settlements in India, and 90 employees. Many of the major factories became some of the most populated and commercially influential cities in Bengal, including the walled forts of Fort William in Bengal, Fort St George in Madras, and Bombay Castle.

The first century of the Company, despite its original profits coming primarily from piracy in the Spice Islands between competing European powers and their companies, saw the East India Company change focus after suffering a major setback in 1623 when their factory in Amboyna in the Moluccas was attacked by the Dutch. This compelled the company to formally abandon their efforts in the Spice Islands, and turn their attention to Bengal where, by this time, they were making steady, if less exciting, profits. After gaining the indifferent patronage of the Mughal Empire, whose cities were &#x27;the megacities of their time&#x27; and whose wealth was unrivaled outside of Asia in the 17th century, the Company&#x27;s first century in the Mughal-ruled areas was spent cultivating their relationship with the Mughal Dynasty, and conducting peaceful trade at great profit. At first it should be said the EIC was drawn into the Mughal system, acting as a kind of vassal to Mughal authority in present-day Bangladesh: it was from this position that the Company would ultimately outplay and outmanoeuvre all competing powers in the region, to eventually use that very system to hold power itself. What started as trading posts on undesirable land were developed into sprawling factory complexes with hundreds of workers sending exotic goods to England and managing protected points to export English finished goods to local merchants. The Company&#x27;s initial rise in Bengal and successes generally came at the expense of competing European powers through the art of currying favours and well-placed bribes, as the Company was matched at every step with French expansion in the region (whose equivalent company carried substantial royal support). Throughout the entire century the company only resorted to force against the Mughals once, with terrible consequences. The Anglo-Mughal war (1686–1690) was a complete defeat, ending when the EIC effectively swore fealty to the Mughals to get their factories back.

The East India Company&#x27;s fortunes changed for the better in 1707 when Bengal and other regions under Mughal rule fell into anarchy after the death of the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb. A series of large-scale rebellions, and the collapse of the Mughal taxation system led to the effective independence of virtually all of the pre-1707 Mughal fiefs and holdings, with their capital Delhi routinely under the control of Maratha, Afghan, or usurper generals&#x27; armies. The EIC was able to take advantage of this chaos, slowly assuming direct control of the province of Bengal, and fighting numerous wars against the French for control of the east coast of the subcontinent. The Company&#x27;s position in the Mughal court as it fell apart made it possible to sponsor various powerful people on the subcontinent as they individually contended with others, steadily amassing more land and power in India to themselves.

In the 18th Century, the primary source of the Company&#x27;s profits in Bengal became taxation in conquered and controlled provinces, as the factories became fortresses and administrative hubs for networks of tax collectors that expanded into enormous cities. The Mughal Empire was the richest in the world in 1700, and the East India Company tried to strip it bare for a century thereafter. Dalrymple calls it &quot;the single largest transfer of wealth until the Nazis.&quot; What was in the 17th century the production capital of the world for textiles was forced to become a market for British-made textiles. Statues, jewels, and various other valuables were moved from the palaces of Bengal to the townhouses of the English countryside. Bengal in particular suffered the worst of Company tax farming, highlighted by the Great Bengal famine of 1770.

The primary tool of expansion for the company was the Sepoy. The Sepoys were locally raised, mostly Muslim soldiers with European training and equipment, who changed warfare in present-day South Asia. Mounted forces and their superior mobility had been king on the region&#x27;s battlefields for a thousand years, with cannon so well integrated that the Mughals fought with cannon mounted on elephants; all were no match to line infantry with decent discipline supported with field cannon. Repeatedly, a few thousand company sepoys fought vastly larger Mughal forces numerically and came out victorious. Afghan, Mughal and Maratha factions started creating their own European-style forces, often with French equipment, as the chaos intensified and the stakes were raised. Ultimately, the company won out, generally through as much diplomacy and state-craft as through fraud and deception. The gradual rise of the East India Company within the Mughal network culminated in the Second Anglo-Maratha War, in which the Company successfully ousted the Maratha, the Empire&#x27;s official protectors, at the high water point in their rise to power, and installed a young Mughal Prince as Emperor, with the Company as the de jure protectors of the Empire from their position of direct control in Bengal. This relationship was repeatedly strained as the Company continued its expansion and exploitation, however it lasted in some form until 1858, when the last Mughal Emperor was exiled as the Company was disbanded and its assets were taken over by the British Crown.

In 1634, the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan extended his hospitality to English traders to Bengal, the richest region of the empire, and in 1717 customs duties were completely waived for the English in Bengal. By then, the Company&#x27;s mainstay businesses were in cotton, silk, opium, indigo dye, saltpetre and tea. Meanwhile, the Dutch, the Company&#x27;s most aggressive competitors, had expanded their monopoly of the spice trade in the Straits of Malacca by ousting the Portuguese in 1640–1641. With reduced Portuguese and Spanish influence in the region, the EIC and VOC entered a period of intense competition, resulting in the Anglo-Dutch wars of the 17th and 18th centuries. The British were also interested in trans-Himalayan trade routes, as they would create access to untapped markets for British manufactured goods in Tibet and China. This economic interest was showcased by the Anglo-Nepalese war (1814–1816).

==== Expansion throughout Asia ====
Within the first two decades of the 17th century, the Dutch East India Company or &quot;Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie&quot;, (VOC) was the wealthiest commercial operation in the world with 50,000 employees worldwide and a private fleet of 200 ships. It specialised in the spice trade and gave its shareholders 40% annual dividend.

The British East India Company was fiercely competitive with the Dutch and French throughout the 17th and 18th centuries over spices from the Spice Islands. Some spices, at the time, could only be found on these islands, such as nutmeg and cloves; and they could bring profits as high as 400 per cent from one voyage.

The tension was so high between the Dutch and the British East Indies Trading Companies that it escalated into at least four Anglo-Dutch wars: 1652–1654, 1665–1667, 1672–1674 and 1780–1784.

Competition arose in 1635 when Charles I granted a trading licence to Sir William Courteen, which permitted the rival Courteen association to trade with the east at any location in which the EIC had no presence.

In an act aimed at strengthening the power of the EIC, King Charles II granted the EIC (in a series of five acts around 1670) the rights to autonomous territorial acquisitions, to mint money, to command fortresses and troops and form alliances, to make war and peace, and to exercise both civil and criminal jurisdiction over the acquired areas.

In 1689, a Mughal fleet commanded by Sidi Yaqub attacked Bombay. After a year of resistance the EIC surrendered in 1690, and the company sent envoys to Aurangzeb&#x27;s camp to plead for a pardon. The company&#x27;s envoys had to prostrate themselves before the emperor, pay a large indemnity, and promise better behaviour in the future. The emperor withdrew his troops, and the company subsequently re-established itself in Bombay and set up a new base in Calcutta.

==== Slavery 1621–1834 ====

The East India Company&#x27;s archives suggest its involvement in the slave trade began in 1684, when a Captain Robert Knox was ordered to buy and transport 250 slaves from Madagascar to St. Helena. The East India Company began using and transporting slaves in Asia and the Atlantic in the early 1620s, according to the Encyclopædia Britannica,&lt;ref name=&quot;topic/East&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or in 1621, according to Richard Allen. Eventually, the company ended the trade in 1834 after numerous legal threats from the British state and the Royal Navy in the form of the West Africa Squadron, which discovered various ships had contained evidence of the illegal trade.

==== Japan ====
In 1613, during the rule of Tokugawa Hidetada of the Tokugawa shogunate, the British ship , under the command of Captain John Saris, was the first English ship to call on Japan. Saris was the chief factor of the EIC&#x27;s trading post in Java, and with the assistance of William Adams, an English sailor who had arrived in Japan in 1600, he was able to gain permission from the ruler to establish a commercial house in Hirado on the Japanese island of Kyushu:
Unable to obtain Japanese raw silk for export to China, and with their trading area reduced to Hirado and Nagasaki from 1616 onwards, the company closed its factory in 1623.

==== Anglo-Mughal war ====
The first of the Anglo-Indian wars occurred in 1686 when the company conducted naval operations against Shaista Khan, the governor of Mughal Bengal. This led to the siege of Bombay and the subsequent intervention of the Mughal Emperor, Aurangzeb. Subsequently, the English company was defeated and fined.

Mughal convoy piracy incident of 1695

In September 1695, Captain Henry Every, an English pirate on board the , reached the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, where he teamed up with five other pirate captains to make an attack on the Indian fleet returning from the annual pilgrimage to Mecca. The Mughal convoy included the treasure-laden &quot;Ganj-i-Sawai&quot;, reported to be the greatest in the Mughal fleet and the largest ship operational in the Indian Ocean, and its escort, the &quot;Fateh Muhammed&quot;. They were spotted passing the straits en route to Surat. The pirates gave chase and caught up with the &quot;Fateh Muhammed&quot; some days later, and meeting little resistance, took some £40,000 of silver.

Every continued in pursuit and managed to overhaul &quot;Ganj-i-Sawai&quot;, which resisted strongly before eventually striking. &quot;Ganj-i-Sawai&quot; carried enormous wealth and, according to contemporary East India Company sources, was carrying a relative of the Grand Mughal, though there is no evidence to suggest that it was his daughter and her retinue. The loot from the &quot;Ganj-i-Sawai&quot; had a total value between £325,000 and £600,000, including 500,000 gold and silver pieces, and has become known as the richest ship ever taken by pirates.

When the news arrived in England it caused an outcry. To appease Aurangzeb, the East India Company promised to pay all financial reparations, while Parliament declared the pirates &quot;hostis humani generis&quot; (&quot;the enemy of humanity&quot;). In mid-1696 the government issued a £500 bounty on Every&#x27;s head and offered a free pardon to any informer who disclosed his whereabouts. The first worldwide manhunt in recorded history was underway.

The plunder of Aurangzeb&#x27;s treasure ship had serious consequences for the English East India Company. The furious Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb ordered Sidi Yaqub and Nawab Daud Khan to attack and close four of the company&#x27;s factories in India and imprison their officers, who were almost lynched by a mob of angry Mughals, blaming them for their countryman&#x27;s depredations, and threatened to put an end to all English trading in India. To appease Emperor Aurangzeb and particularly his Grand Vizier Asad Khan, Parliament exempted Every from all of the Acts of Grace (pardons) and amnesties it would subsequently issue to other pirates.

==== China ====
The British began trading with China in 1699. This fact is recorded from the Chinese side in &quot;The Draft History of the Qing&quot; under the year Kangxi 37 (1698). The apparent discrepancy between the British and Chinese sources can be explained by the fact that Chinese New Year of 1699 did not fall until January 31, so that any treaties entered into in January would have been logged under Kangxi 37 rather than Kangxi 38. In 1715 the Company established a permanent &quot;factory&quot; in Guangzhou (Canton).

Company started selling opium to Chinese merchants in the 1770s in exchange for goods like porcelain and tea, causing a series of opioid addiction outbreaks across China in 1820. The ruling Qing dynasty outlawed the opium trade in 1796 and 1800, but British merchants continued illegally nonetheless. The Qing took measures to prevent the East India Company from selling opium, and destroyed tens of thousands of chests of opium already in the country. This series of events led to the First Opium War in 1839, which involved a succession of British naval attacks along the Chinese coast over the course of several months. As part of the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842, the Qing were forced to give British merchants special treatment and the right to sell opium. The Chinese also ceded territory to the British, including the island of Hong Kong.

=== Forming a complete monopoly ===

==== Trade monopoly ====
The prosperity that the officers of the company enjoyed allowed them to return to Britain and establish sprawling estates and businesses, and to obtain political power, such as seats in the House of Commons. Ship captains sold their appointments to successors for up to £500. As recruits aimed to return to Britain wealthy by securing Indian money, their loyalties to their homeland increased.

The company developed a lobby in the English parliament. Pressure from ambitious tradesmen and former company associates (pejoratively termed &quot;Interlopers&quot; by the company), who wanted to establish private trading firms in India, led to the passing of the deregulating act in 1694.

This act allowed any English firm to trade with India, unless specifically prohibited by act of parliament, thereby annulling the charter that had been in force for almost 100 years. When the East India Company Act 1697 (9 Will. 3. c. 44) was passed in 1697, a new &quot;parallel&quot; East India Company (officially titled the &quot;English Company Trading to the East Indies&quot;) was floated under a state-backed indemnity of £2 million. The powerful stockholders of the old company quickly subscribed a sum of £315,000 in the new concern, and dominated the new body. The two companies wrestled with each other for some time, both in England and in India, for a dominant share of the trade.

It quickly became evident that, in practice, the original company faced scarcely any measurable competition. The companies merged in 1708, by a tripartite indenture involving both companies and the state, with the charter and agreement for the new &quot;United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies&quot; being awarded by Sidney Godolphin, 1st Earl of Godolphin. Under this arrangement, the merged company lent a sum of £3,200,000 to the Treasury, in return for exclusive privileges for the next three years, after which the situation was to be reviewed. The amalgamated company became the &quot;United Company of Merchants of England Trading to the East Indies&quot;.


A constant battle between the company lobby and Parliament followed for decades. The company sought a permanent establishment, while Parliament would not willingly allow it greater autonomy and so relinquish the opportunity to exploit the company&#x27;s profits. In 1712, another act renewed the status of the company, though the debts were repaid. By 1720, 15% of British imports were from India, almost all passing through the company, which reasserted the influence of the company lobby. The licence was prolonged until 1766 by yet another act in 1730.

At this time, Britain and France became bitter rivals. Frequent skirmishes between them took place for control of colonial possessions. In 1742, fearing the monetary consequences of a war, the British government agreed to extend the deadline for the licensed exclusive trade by the company in India until 1783, in return for a further loan of £1 million. Between 1756 and 1763, the Seven Years&#x27; War diverted the state&#x27;s attention towards consolidation and defence of its territorial possessions in Europe and its colonies in North America.

The war partly took place in the Indian theatre, between the company troops and the French forces. In 1757, the Law Officers of the Crown delivered the Pratt–Yorke opinion distinguishing overseas territories acquired by right of conquest from those acquired by private treaty. The opinion asserted that, while the Crown of Great Britain enjoyed sovereignty over both, only the property of the former was vested in the Crown.

With the advent of the Industrial Revolution, Britain surged ahead of its European rivals. Demand for Indian commodities was boosted by the need to sustain troops and the economy during the war, and by the increased availability of raw materials and efficient methods of production. As home to the revolution, Britain experienced higher standards of living. Its ever-growing cycle of prosperity, demand and production had a profound influence on overseas trade. The company became the single largest player in the British global market. In 1801 Henry Dundas reported to the House of Commons that

==== Saltpetre trade ====
Sir John Banks, a businessman from Kent who negotiated an agreement between the king and the company, began his career in a syndicate arranging contracts for victualling the navy, an interest he kept up for most of his life. He knew that Samuel Pepys and John Evelyn had amassed a substantial fortune from the Levant and Indian trades.

He became a director and later, as governor of the East India Company in 1672, he arranged a contract which included a loan of £20,000 and £30,000 worth of saltpetre—also known as potassium nitrate, a primary ingredient in gunpowder—for the King &quot;at the price it shall sell by the candle&quot;—that is by auction—where bidding could continue as long as an inch-long candle remained alight.

Outstanding debts were also agreed and the company permitted to export 250 tons of saltpetre. Again in 1673, Banks successfully negotiated another contract for 700 tons of saltpetre at £37,000 between the king and the company. So high was the demand from armed forces that the authorities sometimes turned a blind eye on the untaxed sales. One governor of the company was even reported as saying in 1864 that he would rather have the saltpetre made than the tax on salt.

=== Basis for the monopoly ===
==== Colonial monopoly ====


The Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763) resulted in the defeat of the French forces, limited French imperial ambitions, and stunted the influence of the Industrial Revolution in French territories. Robert Clive, the Governor-General, led the company to a victory against Joseph François Dupleix, the commander of the French forces in India, and recaptured Fort St George from the French. The company took this respite to seize Manila in 1762.

By the Treaty of Paris, France regained the five establishments captured by the British during the war (Pondichéry, Mahe, Karaikal, Yanam and Chandernagar) but was prevented from erecting fortifications and keeping troops in Bengal (art. XI). Elsewhere in India, the French were to remain a military threat, particularly during the War of American Independence, and up to the capture of Pondichéry in 1793 at the outset of the French Revolutionary Wars without any military presence. Although these small outposts remained French possessions for the next two hundred years, French ambitions on Indian territories were effectively laid to rest, thus eliminating a major source of economic competition for the company.

In May 1772 the EIC stock price rose significantly. In June Alexander Fordyce lost £300,000 shorting EIC stock, leaving his partners liable for an estimated £243,000 in debts. As this information became public, 20–30 banks across Europe collapsed during the British credit crisis of 1772-1773. In India alone, the company had bill debts of £1.2 million. It seems that EIC directors James Cockburn and George Colebrooke were &quot;bulling&quot; the Amsterdam market during 1772. The root of this crisis in relation to the East India Company came from the prediction by Isaac de Pinto that &#x27;peace conditions plus an abundance of money would push East Indian shares to &#x27;exorbitant heights.&#x27;

On 14 January 1773 the directors of the EIC asked for a government loan and unlimited access to the tea market in the American colonies, both of which were granted. In August 1773 the Bank of England assisted the EIC with a loan.

The East India Company had also been granted competitive advantages over colonial American tea importers to sell tea from its colonies in Asia in American colonies. This led to the Boston Tea Party of 1773 in which protesters boarded British ships and threw the tea overboard. When protesters successfully prevented the unloading of tea in three other colonies and in Boston, Governor Thomas Hutchinson of the Province of Massachusetts Bay refused to allow the tea to be returned to Britain. This was one of the incidents which led to the American Revolution and independence of the American colonies.

The company&#x27;s trade monopoly with India was abolished in the Charter Act 1813. The monopoly with China was ended in 1833, ending the trading activities of the company and rendering its activities purely administrative.

=== Disestablishment ===
In the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and under the provisions of the Government of India Act 1858, the British Government nationalised the company. The British government took over its Indian possessions, its administrative powers and machinery, and its armed forces.

The company had already divested itself of its commercial trading assets in India in favour of the UK government in 1833, with the latter assuming the debts and obligations of the company, which were to be serviced and paid from tax revenue raised in India. In return, the shareholders voted to accept an annual dividend of 10.5%, guaranteed for forty years, likewise to be funded from India, with a final pay-off to redeem outstanding shares. The debt obligations continued beyond dissolution and were only extinguished by the UK government during the Second World War.

The company remained in existence in vestigial form, continuing to manage the tea trade on behalf of the British Government (and the supply of Saint Helena) until the East India Stock Dividend Redemption Act 1873 came into effect, on 1 January 1874. This act provided for the formal dissolution of the company on 1 June 1874, after a final dividend payment and the commutation or redemption of its stock. &quot;The Times&quot; commented on 8 April 1873:
== Establishments in Britain ==

The company&#x27;s headquarters in London, from which much of India was governed, was East India House in Leadenhall Street. After occupying premises in Philpot Lane from 1600 to 1621; in Crosby House, Bishopsgate from 1621 to 1638; and in Leadenhall Street from 1638 to 1648, the company moved into Craven House, an Elizabethan mansion in Leadenhall Street. The building had become known as East India House by 1661. It was completely rebuilt and enlarged in 1726–1729 and further significantly remodelled and expanded in 1796–1800. It was finally vacated in 1860 and demolished in 1861–1862. The site is now occupied by the Lloyd&#x27;s building.

In 1607, the company decided to build its own ships and leased a yard on the River Thames at Deptford. By 1614, the yard having become too small, an alternative site was acquired at Blackwall: the new yard was fully operational by 1617. It was sold in 1656, although for some years East India Company ships continued to be built and repaired there under the new owners.

In 1803 an act of Parliament, promoted by the East India Company, established the East India Dock Company, with the aim of establishing a new set of docks (the East India Docks) primarily for the use of ships trading with India. The existing Brunswick Dock, part of the Blackwall Yard site, became the Export Dock; while a new Import Dock was built to the north. In 1838 the East India Dock Company merged with the West India Dock Company. The docks were taken over by the Port of London Authority in 1909 and closed in 1967.

The East India College was founded in 1806 as a training establishment for &quot;writers&quot; (i.e. clerks) in the company&#x27;s service. It was initially located in Hertford Castle, but moved in 1809 to purpose-built premises at Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire. In 1858 the college closed; but in 1862 the buildings reopened as a public school, now Haileybury and Imperial Service College.

The East India Company Military Seminary was founded in 1809 at Addiscombe, near Croydon, Surrey, to train young officers for service in the company&#x27;s armies in India. It was based in Addiscombe Place, an early 18th-century mansion. The government took it over in 1858 and renamed it the Royal Indian Military College. In 1861 it was closed, and the site was subsequently redeveloped.

In 1818, the company entered into an agreement by which those of its servants who were certified insane in India might be cared for at Pembroke House, Hackney, London, a private lunatic asylum run by Dr George Rees until 1838, and thereafter by Dr William Williams. The arrangement outlasted the company itself, continuing until 1870, when the India Office opened its own asylum, the Royal India Asylum, at Hanwell, Middlesex.

The East India Club in London was formed in 1849 for officers of the company. The Club still exists today as a private gentlemen&#x27;s club with its club house situated at 16 St James&#x27;s Square, London.

== Symbols ==
=== Flags ===

The English East India Company flag changed over time, with a canton based on the flag of the contemporary Kingdom, and a field of 9-to-13 alternating red and white stripes.

From 1600, the canton consisted of a St George&#x27;s Cross representing the Kingdom of England. With the Acts of Union 1707, the canton was changed to the new Union Flag—consisting of an English St George&#x27;s Cross combined with a Scottish St Andrew&#x27;s cross—representing the Kingdom of Great Britain. After the Acts of Union 1800 that joined Ireland with Great Britain to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the canton of the East India Company flag was altered accordingly to include a Saint Patrick&#x27;s Saltire.

There has been much debate about the number and order of stripes in the field of the flag. Historical documents and paintings show variations from 9-to-13 stripes, with some images showing the top stripe red and others showing it white.

At the time of the American Revolution the East India Company flag was nearly identical to the Grand Union Flag. Historian Charles Fawcett argued that the East India Company Flag inspired the Stars and Stripes of America.

=== Coat of arms ===

The East India Company&#x27;s original coat of arms was granted in 1600. The blazon of the arms is as follows: &quot;Azure, three ships with three masts, rigged and under full sail, the sails, pennants and ensigns Argent, each charged with a cross Gules; on a chief of the second a pale quarterly Azure and Gules, on the 1st and 4th a fleur-de-lis or, on the 2nd and 3rd a leopard or, between two roses Gules seeded Or barbed Vert.&quot; The shield had as a crest: &quot;A sphere without a frame, bounded with the Zodiac in bend Or, between two pennants flottant Argent, each charged with a cross Gules, over the sphere the words &quot;&quot; (Latin: God Indicates). The supporters were two sea lions (lions with fishes&#x27; tails) and the motto was (Latin: Where God Leads, Nothing Harms).

The East India Company&#x27;s later arms, granted in 1698, were: &quot;Argent a cross Gules; in the dexter chief quarter an escutcheon of the arms of France and England quarterly, the shield ornamentally and regally crowned Or.&quot; The crest was: &quot;A lion rampant guardant Or holding between the forepaws a regal crown proper.&quot; The supporters were: &quot;Two lions rampant guardant Or, each supporting a banner erect Argent, charged with a cross Gules.&quot; The motto was (Latin: Under the auspices of the King and the Parliament of England).

=== Merchant mark ===

When the East India Company was chartered in 1600, it was still customary for individual merchants or members of companies such as the Company of Merchant Adventurers to have a distinguishing merchant&#x27;s mark which often included the mystical &quot;Sign of Four&quot; and served as a trademark. The East India Company&#x27;s merchant mark consisted of a &quot;Sign of Four&quot; atop a heart within which was a saltire between the lower arms of which were the initials &quot;EIC&quot;. This mark was a central motif of the East India Company&#x27;s coinage and forms the central emblem displayed on the Scinde Dawk postage stamps.

== Ships ==

Ships of the East India Company were called East Indiamen or simply &quot;Indiamen&quot;. Their names were sometimes prefixed with the initials &quot;HCS&quot;, standing for &quot;Honourable Company&#x27;s Service&quot; or &quot;Honourable Company&#x27;s Ship&quot;, such as and .
During the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, the East India Company arranged for letters of marque for its vessels such as &quot;Lord Nelson&quot;. This was not so that they could carry cannon to fend off warships, privateers, and pirates on their voyages to India and China (that they could do without permission) but so that, should they have the opportunity to take a prize, they could do so without being guilty of piracy. Similarly, &quot;Earl of Mornington&quot;, an East India Company packet ship of only six guns, also sailed under a letter of marque.

In addition, the company had its own navy, the Bombay Marine, equipped with warships such as . These vessels often accompanied vessels of the Royal Navy on expeditions, such as the Invasion of Java.

At the Battle of Pulo Aura, which was probably the company&#x27;s most notable naval victory, Nathaniel Dance, Commodore of a convoy of Indiamen and sailing aboard the , led several Indiamen in a skirmish with a French squadron, driving them off. Some six years earlier, on 28 January 1797, five Indiamen, &quot;Woodford&quot;, under Captain Charles Lennox, &quot;Taunton-Castle&quot;, Captain Edward Studd, &quot;Canton&quot;, Captain Abel Vyvyan, &quot;Boddam&quot;, Captain George Palmer, and , Captain John Christian Lochner, had encountered Admiral de Sercey and his squadron of frigates. On this occasion the Indiamen succeeded in bluffing their way to safety, and without any shots even being fired. Lastly, on 15 June 1795, &quot;General Goddard&quot; played a large role in the capture of seven Dutch East Indiamen off St Helena.

East Indiamen were large and strongly built, and when the Royal Navy was desperate for vessels to escort merchant convoys, it bought several of them to convert to warships. &quot;Earl of Mornington&quot; became HMS &quot;Drake&quot;. Other examples include:
* 
* (1795)
* (1804)
* 
Their design as merchant vessels meant that their performance in the warship role was underwhelming and the Navy converted them to transports.

== Records ==

Unlike all other British Government records, the records from the East India Company (and its successor the India Office) are not in The National Archives at Kew, London, but are held by the British Library in London as part of the Asia, Pacific and Africa Collections. The catalogue is searchable online in the &quot;Access to Archives&quot; catalogues. Many of the East India Company records are freely available online under an agreement that the Families in British India Society has with the British Library. Published catalogues exist of East India Company ships&#x27; journals and logs, 1600–1834; accompanying catalogues also cover the company&#x27;s daughter institutions, including the East India Company College, Haileybury, and Addiscombe Military Seminary.

&quot;The Asiatic Journal and Monthly Register for British India and its Dependencies&quot;, first issued in 1816, was sponsored by the East India Company, and includes much information relating to its work.

<doc id="43282" wikidata="Q152505" url="?curid=43282" title="Leonard Bernstein">
<text>Leonard Bernstein ( ; born Louis Bernstein; August 25, 1918 – October 14, 1990) was an American conductor, composer, pianist, music educator, author, and humanitarian. Considered to be one of the most important conductors of his time, he was the first American-born conductor to receive international acclaim. Bernstein was &quot;one of the most prodigiously talented and successful musicians in American history&quot; according to music critic Donal Henahan. Bernstein&#x27;s honors and accolades include seven Emmy Awards, two Tony Awards, and 16 Grammy Awards (including the Lifetime Achievement Award) as well as an Academy Award nomination. He received the Kennedy Center Honor in 1981.

As a composer, Bernstein wrote in many genres, including symphonic and orchestral music, ballet, film and theatre music, choral works, opera, chamber music, and pieces for the piano. Bernstein&#x27;s works include the Broadway musical &quot;West Side Story&quot;, which continues to be regularly performed worldwide, and has been adapted into two (1961 and 2021) feature films, as well as three symphonies, &quot;Serenade after Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;&quot; (1954), and &quot;Chichester Psalms&quot; (1965), the original score for the Elia Kazan drama film &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954), and theater works including &quot;On the Town&quot; (1944), &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1953), &quot;Candide&quot; (1956), and his &quot;Mass&quot; (1971).

Bernstein was the first American-born conductor to lead a major American symphony orchestra. He was music director of the New York Philharmonic and conducted the world&#x27;s major orchestras, generating a legacy of audio and video recordings. Bernstein was also a critical figure in the modern revival of the music of Gustav Mahler, in whose music he was most interested. A skilled pianist, Bernstein often conducted piano concertos from the keyboard. He shared and explored classical music on television with a mass audience in national and international broadcasts, including Young People&#x27;s Concerts with the New York Philharmonic.

Bernstein worked in support of civil rights; protested against the Vietnam War; advocated nuclear disarmament; raised money for HIV/AIDS research and awareness; championed Janis Ian at age 15 and her song about interracial love, Society&#x27;s Child, on his CBS television show; and engaged in multiple international initiatives for human rights and world peace. He conducted Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Resurrection Symphony&quot; to mark the death of president John F. Kennedy, and in Israel at a concert, &quot;Hatikvah on Mt. Scopus&quot;, after the Six-Day War. The sequence of events was recorded for a documentary entitled &quot;Journey to Jerusalem&quot;. At the end of his life, Bernstein conducted a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 in Berlin to celebrate the fall of the Berlin Wall.

==Early life and education==
=== 1918–1935: Early life and family ===
Bernstein was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts, to Russian Jewish/Ukrainian Jewish parents, Jennie (née Resnick) and Samuel Joseph Bernstein, both of whom immigrated to the United States from Rivne, Russian Empire (now in Ukraine). His grandmother insisted that his first name be Louis, but his parents always called him Leonard. Bernstein legally changed his name from Louis to Leonard when he was 16. To his friends and many others, Bernstein was simply known as &quot;Lenny&quot;.

Bernstein&#x27;s mother had moved to stay with her parents in Lawrence toward the end of her first pregnancy and, since he was sickly as an infant, he stayed there until he was strong enough to join his father in Boston, where he eventually attended the Boston Latin School. When he was 15, the family moved to nearby Newton, Massachusetts.

Bernstein&#x27;s father was the owner of the Samuel J. Bernstein Hair Company. It held the exclusive distribution rights for the Frederick&#x27;s Permanent Wave Machine in the 1920s and 1930s, which made Samuel wealthy.

In Bernstein&#x27;s early youth, his only exposure to music was the household radio and music on Friday nights at Congregation Mishkan Tefila in Roxbury, Massachusetts. When Bernstein was ten years old, Samuel&#x27;s sister Clara deposited her upright piano at her brother&#x27;s house. Bernstein asked for lessons, and subsequently had a variety of piano teachers in his youth, including Helen Coates, who later became his secretary. In the summers, the Bernstein family would go to their vacation home in Sharon, Massachusetts, where young Leonard conscripted all the neighborhood children to put on shows ranging from Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; to Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. He would often play entire operas or Beethoven symphonies with his younger sister, Shirley. Leonard&#x27;s youngest sibling, Burton, was born in 1932, 13 years after Leonard. Despite the large age differences, the three siblings remained close their entire lives.

Sam was initially opposed to young Leonard&#x27;s interest in music and attempted to discourage his son&#x27;s interest by refusing to pay for his piano lessons. Leonard then took to giving lessons to young people in his neighborhood. One of his students, Sid Ramin, became Bernstein&#x27;s orchestrator for West Side Story and a lifelong beloved friend.

Sam took his son to orchestral concerts in his teenage years and eventually supported his music education. In May 1932, Leonard attended his first orchestral concert with the Boston Pops Orchestra conducted by Arthur Fiedler. Bernstein recalled, &quot;To me, in those days, the Pops was heaven itself ... I thought ... it was the supreme achievement of the human race.&quot; It was at this concert that Bernstein first heard Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;, which made a tremendous impression on him.

Another strong musical influence was George Gershwin. Bernstein was working as a music counselor at a summer camp when news came of Gershwin&#x27;s death. Bernstein interrupted lunch in the mess hall, and then played Gershwin&#x27;s second &quot;Prelude&quot; as a memorial.

On March 30, 1932, Bernstein played Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in G minor&quot; at his first public piano performance in Susan Williams&#x27;s studio recital at the New England Conservatory. Two years later, he made his solo debut with orchestra in Grieg&#x27;s Piano Concerto in A minor with the Boston Public School Orchestra.

Bernstein&#x27;s first two education environments were both public schools: the William Lloyd Garrison School, followed by the prestigious Boston Latin School, for which Bernstein and classmate Lawrence F. Ebb wrote the Class Song.

=== 1935–1941: College years ===

 Harvard University 

In 1935, Bernstein enrolled at Harvard College, where he studied music with, among others, Edward Burlingame Hill and Walter Piston. Bernstein&#x27;s first extant composition, Psalm 148, set for voice and piano, is dated 1935. He majored in music with a final year thesis titled &quot;The Absorption of Race Elements into American Music&quot; (1939; reproduced in his book &quot;Findings&quot;). One of Bernstein&#x27;s intellectual influences at Harvard was the aesthetics Professor David Prall, whose multidisciplinary outlook on the arts inspired Bernstein for the rest of his life. One of Bernstein&#x27;s friends at Harvard was future philosopher Donald Davidson, with whom Bernstein played piano duets. Bernstein wrote and conducted the musical score for the production Davidson mounted of Aristophanes&#x27; play &quot;The Birds&quot;, performed in the original Greek. Bernstein recycled some of this music in future works. While a student, Bernstein was briefly an accompanist for the Harvard Glee Club as well as an unpaid pianist for Harvard Film Society&#x27;s silent film presentations.

Bernstein mounted a student production of &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, directing its action from the piano as the composer Marc Blitzstein had done at the infamous premiere. Blitzstein, who attended the performance, subsequently became a close friend and mentor to Bernstein. As a sophomore at Harvard, Bernstein met the conductor Dimitri Mitropoulos. Mitropoulos&#x27;s charisma and power as a musician were major influences on Bernstein&#x27;s eventual decision to become a conductor. Mitropoulos invited Bernstein to come to Minneapolis for the 1940–41 season to be his assistant, but the plan fell through because of union issues. In 1937, Bernstein sat next to Aaron Copland at a dance recital at Town Hall in New York City. Copland invited Bernstein to his birthday party afterwards, where Bernstein impressed the guests by playing Copland&#x27;s challenging Piano Variations, a work Bernstein loved. Although he was never a formal student of Copland&#x27;s, Bernstein regularly sought his advice, often citing him as his &quot;only real composition teacher&quot;. Bernstein graduated from Harvard in 1939 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;cum laude&quot;.

 Curtis Institute of Music 

After graduating from Harvard, Bernstein enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia. At Curtis, Bernstein studied conducting with Fritz Reiner (who is said to have given Bernstein the only &quot;A&quot; grade he ever awarded); piano with Isabelle Vengerova; orchestration with Randall Thompson; counterpoint with Richard Stöhr; and score reading with Renée Longy Miquelle. In 1940, Bernstein attended the inaugural year of the Tanglewood Music Center (then called the Berkshire Music Center) at the Boston Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s summer home. Bernstein studied conducting with the BSO&#x27;s music director, Serge Koussevitzky, who became a profound lifelong inspiration to Bernstein. He became Koussevitzky&#x27;s conducting assistant at Tanglewood and later dedicated his Symphony No. 2: &quot;The Age of Anxiety&quot; to his beloved mentor. One of Bernstein&#x27;s classmates, both at Curtis and at Tanglewood, was Lukas Foss, who remained a lifelong friend and colleague. Bernstein returned to Tanglewood nearly every summer for the rest of his life to teach and conduct the young music students. Bernstein received a diploma in conducting from Curtis in 1941.

== Career ==
=== 1940s: Rise to prominence ===
Soon after he left Curtis, Bernstein moved to New York City where he lived in various apartments in Manhattan. Bernstein supported himself by coaching singers, teaching piano, and playing the piano for dance classes in Carnegie Hall. He found work with Harms-Witmark, transcribing jazz and pop music and publishing his work under the pseudonym &quot;Lenny Amber&quot;. (&quot;Bernstein&quot; means &quot;amber&quot; in German.)

Bernstein briefly shared an apartment in Greenwich Village with his friend Adolph Green. Green was then part of a satirical music troupe called The Revuers, featuring Betty Comden and Judy Holliday. With Bernstein sometimes providing piano accompaniment, The Revuers often performed at the legendary jazz club the Village Vanguard. On April 21, 1942, Bernstein performed the premiere of his first published work, &quot;Sonata for Clarinet and Piano&quot;, with clarinetist David Glazer at the Institute of Modern Art in Boston.


====New York Philharmonic conducting debut====
Bernstein would later make his New York Philharmonic conducting debut. On November 14, 1943, having recently been appointed assistant conductor to Artur Rodziński of the New York Philharmonic, Bernstein made his major conducting debut at short notice—and without any rehearsal—after guest conductor Bruno Walter came down with the flu. The challenging program included works by Robert Schumann, Miklós Rózsa, Richard Wagner, and Richard Strauss.

The next day, &quot;The New York Times&quot; carried the story on its front page and remarked in an editorial, &quot;It&#x27;s a good American success story. The warm, friendly triumph of it filled Carnegie Hall and spread far over the air waves.&quot; Many newspapers throughout the country carried the story, which, in combination with the concert&#x27;s live national CBS Radio Network broadcast, propelled Bernstein to instant fame. Over the next two years, Bernstein made conducting debuts with ten different orchestras in the United States and Canada, greatly broadening his repertoire and initiating a lifelong frequent practice of conducting concertos from the piano.

On January 28, 1944, Bernstein conducted the premiere of his Symphony No. 1: &quot;Jeremiah&quot; with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and soloist Jennie Tourel. In the fall of 1943, Bernstein and Jerome Robbins began work on their first collaboration, &quot;Fancy Free&quot;, a ballet about three young sailors on leave in wartime New York City. &quot;Fancy Free&quot; premiered on April 18, 1944, with the Ballet Theatre (now the American Ballet Theatre) at the old Metropolitan Opera House, with scenery by Oliver Smith and costumes by Kermit Love.

Bernstein and Robbins decided to expand the ballet into a musical and invited Comden and Green to write the book and lyrics. &quot;On the Town&quot; opened on Broadway&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre on December 28, 1944. The show resonated with audiences during World War II, and it broke race barriers on Broadway: Japanese-American dancer Sono Osato in a leading role; a multiracial cast dancing as mixed race couples; and a Black concertmaster, Everett Lee, who eventually took over as music director of the show. &quot;On the Town&quot; became an MGM motion picture in 1949, starring Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra, and Jules Munshin as the three sailors. Only part of Bernstein&#x27;s score was used in the film and additional songs were provided by Roger Edens.
From 1945 to 1947, Bernstein was the music director of the New York City Symphony, which had been founded the previous year by the conductor Leopold Stokowski. The orchestra (with support from Mayor Fiorello La Guardia) had modern programs and affordable tickets. In 1946, Bernstein made his overseas debut with the Czech Philharmonic at the inaugural Prague Spring International Music Festival. He also recorded Ravel&#x27;s Piano Concerto in G major as soloist and conductor with the Philharmonia Orchestra. On July 4, 1946, Bernstein conducted the European premiere of &quot;Fancy Free&quot; with the Ballet Theatre at the Royal Opera House in London. On August 6 he conducted opera professionally for the first time, with the American premiere of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; at Tanglewood, commissioned by Koussevitzky. That same year, Arturo Toscanini invited Bernstein to guest conduct two concerts with the NBC Symphony Orchestra, one of which featured Bernstein as soloist in Ravel&#x27;s Piano Concerto in G major.

====Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, television debut and Tanglewood====

In 1947, Bernstein conducted in Tel Aviv for the first time, beginning a lifelong association with the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, then known as the Palestine Symphony Orchestra. The next year, he conducted an open-air concert for Israeli troops at Beersheba in the middle of the desert during the Arab-Israeli war. In 1957, he conducted the inaugural concert of the Mann Auditorium in Tel Aviv. In 1967, he conducted a concert on Mount Scopus to commemorate the Reunification of Jerusalem, featuring Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 and Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto with soloist Isaac Stern. The city of Tel Aviv added his name to the Habima Square (Orchestra Plaza) in the center of the city. On December 10, 1949, Bernstein made his first television appearance as conductor with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. The concert, which included an address by Eleanor Roosevelt, celebrated the first anniversary of the United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s ratification of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and included the premiere of Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Preamble for a Solemn Occasion&quot; with Sir Laurence Olivier narrating text from the UN Charter. The concert was televised by NBC Television Network. In April 1949, Bernstein performed as piano soloist in the world premiere of his Symphony No. 2: The Age of Anxiety with Koussevitzy conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra. On December 2, 1949, Bernstein conducted the world premiere of the Messiaen&#x27;s &quot;Turangalîla-Symphonie&quot;, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the New York premiere in Carnegie Hall on the afternoon of December 10. Part of the rehearsal for the concert was recorded and released by the orchestra. When Koussevitzky died in 1951, Bernstein became head of the orchestra and conducting departments at Tanglewood.

=== 1950s: Career expansion and &quot;West Side Story&quot; ===

The 1950s comprised the most active years of Bernstein&#x27;s career. He created five new works for the Broadway stage, composed several symphonic works and an iconic film score, and was appointed music director of the New York Philharmonic with whom he toured the world, including concerts behind the Iron Curtain. Bernstein also harnessed the power of television to expand his educational reach, and he married and started a family. In 1950, Bernstein composed incidental music for a Broadway production of J. M. Barrie&#x27;s play &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. The production, which opened on Broadway on April 24, 1950, starred Jean Arthur as Peter Pan and Boris Karloff in the dual roles of George Darling and Captain Hook. The show ran for 321 performances.

In 1951, Bernstein composed &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot;, a one-act opera in seven scenes with an English libretto by the composer. The opera portrays the troubled marriage of a couple whose idyllic suburban post-war environment belies their inner turmoil. Ironically, Bernstein wrote most of the opera while on his honeymoon in Mexico with his wife, Felicia Montealegre. Bernstein was a visiting music professor at Brandeis University from 1951 to 1956. In 1952, he created the Brandeis Festival of the Creative Arts, where he conducted the premiere of &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot; on June 12 of that year. The NBC Opera Theatre subsequently presented the opera on television in November 1952. It opened on Broadway at the Playhouse Theatre on April 19, 1955, and ran for six weeks. Three decades later, Bernstein wrote a second opera, &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, which picked up the story and characters of &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot; in a later period.
 &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; (1953) 

In 1953, Bernstein wrote the score for the musical &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; on very short notice, with a book by Joseph A. Fields and Jerome Chodorov and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. Like the 1940 play, directed on Broadway by George S. Kaufman, it is based on the autobiographical short stories, collectively titled &quot;My Sister Eileen&quot;, that were written by Ruth McKenney and published in the early 1930s by &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. They tell the story of two sisters from Ohio who move to New York City and seek success from their squalid basement apartment in Greenwich Village. &quot;Wonderful Town&quot; opened on Broadway on February 25, 1953, at the Winter Garden Theatre, starring Rosalind Russell in the role of Ruth Sherwood, Edie Adams as Eileen Sherwood, and George Gaynes as Robert Baker. It won five Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Actress.

 &quot;Candide&quot; (1956) 

In the three years leading up to Bernstein&#x27;s appointment as music director of the New York Philharmonic, Bernstein was simultaneously working on the scores for two Broadway shows. The first of the two was the operetta-style musical &quot;Candide.&quot; Lillian Hellman originally brought Bernstein her idea of adapting Voltaire&#x27;s novella. The original collaborators on the show were book writer John Latouche and lyricist Richard Wilbur. &quot;Candide&quot; opened on Broadway on December 1, 1956, at the Martin Beck Theatre, in a production directed by Tyrone Guthrie. Anxious about the parallels Hellman had deliberately drawn between Voltaire&#x27;s story and the ongoing hearings conducted by the House Un-American Activities Committee, Guthrie persuaded the collaborators to cut their most incendiary sections prior to opening night. While the production was a box office disaster, running for only two months for a total of 73 performances, the cast album became a cult classic, which kept Bernstein&#x27;s score alive. There have been several revivals, with modifications to improve the book. The elements of the music that have remained best known and performed over the decades are the Overture, which quickly became one of the most frequently performed orchestral compositions by a 20th century American composer; the coloratura aria &quot;Glitter and Be Gay&quot;, which Barbara Cook sang in the original production; and the grand finale &quot;Make Our Garden Grow&quot;.

 &quot;West Side Story&quot; (1957)
The other musical Bernstein was writing simultaneously with &quot;Candide&quot; was &quot;West Side Story&quot;. Bernstein collaborated with director and choreographer Jerome Robbins, book writer Arthur Laurents, and lyricist Stephen Sondheim. The story is an updated retelling of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, set in the mid-1950s in the slums of New York City&#x27;s Upper West Side. The Romeo character, Tony, is affiliated with the Jets gang, who are of white Northern European descent. The Juliet character is Maria, who is connected to the Sharks gang, recently arrived from Puerto Rico. The original Broadway production opened at the Winter Garden Theatre on September 26, 1957, and ran 732 performances. Robbins won the Tony Award for Best Choreographer, and Oliver Smith won the Tony for Best Scenic Designer.

Bernstein&#x27;s score for &quot;West Side Story&quot; blends &quot;jazz, Latin rhythms, symphonic sweep and musical-comedy conventions in groundbreaking ways for Broadway&quot;. It was orchestrated by Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal following detailed instructions from Bernstein. The dark theme, sophisticated music, extended dance scenes, and focus on social problems marked a turning point in musical theatre. In 1960, Bernstein prepared a suite of orchestral music from the show, titled &quot;Symphonic Dances from West Side Story&quot;, which continues to be popular with orchestras worldwide. A 1961 United Artists film adaptation, directed by Robert Wise and Robbins, starred Natalie Wood as Maria and Richard Beymer as Tony. The film won ten Academy Awards, including Best Picture and a ground-breaking Best Supporting Actress award for Puerto Rican-born Rita Moreno playing the role of Anita. A film adaptation directed by Steven Spielberg opened in 2021.
In addition to Bernstein&#x27;s compositional activity for the stage, he wrote a symphonic work, &quot;Serenade after Plato&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot;&quot; (1954); the score &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954); and &quot;Prelude, Fugue and Riffs&quot;, composed in 1949, but only premiered in 1955, for jazz big band and solo clarinet. In 1953, Bernstein became the first American conductor to appear at La Scala in Milan, conducting Cherubini&#x27;s &quot;Medea&quot;, with Maria Callas in the title role. Callas and Bernstein reunited at La Scala to perform Bellini&#x27;s &quot;La sonnambula&quot; in 1955. On November 14, 1954, Bernstein presented the first of his television lectures for the CBS Television Network arts program &quot;Omnibus&quot;. The live lecture, entitled &quot;Beethoven&#x27;s Fifth Symphony&quot;, involved Bernstein explaining the symphony&#x27;s first movement with the aid of musicians from the &quot;Symphony of the Air&quot; (formerly NBC Symphony Orchestra). The program featured manuscripts from Beethoven&#x27;s own hand, as well as a giant painting of the first page of the score covering the studio floor. Six more &quot;Omnibus&quot; lectures followed from 1955 to 1961 (later on ABC and then NBC) covering a broad range of topics: jazz, conducting, American musical comedy, modern music, J. S. Bach, and grand opera.

 Music director of the New York Philharmonic 

Bernstein was appointed the music director of the New York Philharmonic in 1957, sharing the post jointly with Dimitri Mitropoulos until he took sole charge in 1958. Bernstein held the music directorship until 1969 when he was appointed &quot;Laureate Conductor&quot;. He continued to conduct and make recordings with the orchestra for the rest of his life. Bernstein&#x27;s television teaching took a quantum leap when, as the new music director of the New York Philharmonic, he put the orchestra&#x27;s traditional Saturday afternoon Young People&#x27;s Concerts on the CBS Television Network. Millions of viewers of all ages and around the world enthusiastically embraced Bernstein and his engaging presentations about classical music. Bernstein often presented talented young performers on the broadcasts. Many of them became celebrated in their own right, including conductors Claudio Abbado and Seiji Ozawa; flutist Paula Robison; and pianist André Watts. From 1958 until 1972, the 53 Young People&#x27;s Concerts comprised the most influential series of music education programs ever produced on television. They were highly acclaimed by critics and won numerous Emmy Awards.

Some of Bernstein&#x27;s scripts, all of which he wrote himself, were released in book form and on records. A recording of &quot;Humor in Music&quot; was awarded a Grammy award for Best Documentary or Spoken Word Recording (other than comedy) in 1961. The programs were shown in many countries around the world, often with Bernstein dubbed into other languages, and the concerts were later released on home video by Kultur Video.

In 1958, Bernstein and Mitropoulos led the New York Philharmonic on its first tour south of the border, through 12 countries in Central and South America. The United States Department of State sponsored the tour to improve the nation&#x27;s relations with its southern neighbors. In 1959, the Department of State also sponsored Bernstein and the Philharmonic on a 50-concert tour through Europe and the Soviet Union, portions of which were filmed by the CBS Television Network. A highlight of the tour was Bernstein&#x27;s performance of Shostakovich&#x27;s Fifth Symphony, in the presence of the composer, who came on stage at the end to congratulate Bernstein and the musicians.

=== 1960s: Innovations and Lincoln Center ===
 New York Philharmonic Innovations 

Bernstein&#x27;s innovative approach to themed programming included introducing audiences to composers less-performed at the time such as Gustav Mahler, Carl Nielsen, Jean Sibelius, and Charles Ives (including the world premiere of his Symphony No. 2). Bernstein actively advocated for the commission and performance of works by contemporary composers, conducting over 40 world premieres by a diverse roster of composers ranging from John Cage to Alberto Ginastera to Luciano Berio. He also conducted US premieres of 19 major works from around the globe, including works by Dmitri Shostakovich, Pierre Boulez, and György Ligeti.
Bernstein championed American composers, especially those with whom he had a close friendship, such as Aaron Copland, William Schuman, and David Diamond. This decade saw a significant expansion of Bernstein and the Philharmonic&#x27;s collaboration with Columbia Records, together they released over 400 compositions, covering a broad swath of the classical music canon. Bernstein welcomed the Philharmonic&#x27;s additions of its first Black musician, Sanford Allen, and its second woman musician, Orin O&#x27;Brien. Bernstein also shared the Philharmonic&#x27;s commitment to connecting with as many New Yorkers as possible. That vision became a reality with the launch of the Concerts in the Parks in 1965, which Bernstein conducted often. Another milestone was the Philharmonic&#x27;s first visit to Japan in 1961, when Bernstein led acclaimed Philharmonic concerts and engaged in cultural exchange. Over the years, he led the Orchestra on tours to 144 cities in 38 countries.

Bernstein initiated the Philharmonic&#x27;s informal Thursday Evening Preview Concerts, which included Bernstein&#x27;s talks from the stage, a practice that was unheard of at the time. In one oft-reported incident, on April 6, 1962, Bernstein appeared on stage before a performance of the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 1 in D minor to explain that the soloist, Glenn Gould, had chosen an idiosyncratic approach to the work. Bernstein explained that while he did not totally agree with it, he thought Gould&#x27;s interpretation was an artistically worthy exploration. Bernstein questioned: &quot;In a concerto, who is the boss: the soloist or the conductor?&quot; The incident created a stir that reverberated in the press for decades; see .

In 1960, Bernstein and the New York Philharmonic marked the centennial of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s birth with a series of performances. The composer&#x27;s widow, Alma, attended some of Bernstein&#x27;s rehearsals. That same year, Bernstein made his first commercial recording of a Mahler symphony (the Fourth). Over the next seven years, he recorded the entire Mahler symphony cycle with the New York Philharmonic (except for the 8th Symphony, which was recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra). The combination of concert performances, television talks, and recordings led to a renewed interest in Mahler, especially in the United States. Bernstein claimed that he identified with the works on a personal level, and once wrote of the composer: &quot;I&#x27;m so sympathetic to Mahler: I understand his problem. It&#x27;s like being two different men locked up in the same body; one man is a conductor and the other a composer ... It&#x27;s like being a double man.&quot;
 Opening Lincoln Center 

On May 14, 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower broke ground for Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. On September 23, 1962, the New York Philharmonic moved from Carnegie Hall to its new home, Philharmonic Hall (now David Geffen Hall). Bernstein conducted the gala opening concert featuring works by Mahler, Beethoven, and Vaughan Williams, as well as the premiere of Aaron Copland&#x27;s &quot;Connotations&quot;. In 1964, Bernstein conducted at the Metropolitan Opera for the first time in Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s production of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Falstaff&quot;. In subsequent years, Bernstein returned to The Met to conduct &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; (1970) and &quot;Carmen&quot; (1972), as well as at the Centennial Gala in 1983.

 An Artist&#x27;s Response to Violence 

In 1961, Bernstein composed and conducted a fanfare for President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s pre-inaugural gala.

On November 23, 1963, the day after the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Bernstein conducted the New York Philharmonic and the Schola Cantorum of New York in a nationally televised memorial featuring the Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2: &quot;Resurrection&quot;. Later that week, in a speech to the United Jewish Appeal, Bernstein said: &quot;This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.&quot; After Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, Bernstein conducted the &quot;Adagietto&quot; movement from Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 5 at the funeral mass.

 &quot;Kaddish&quot; and &quot;Chichester Psalms&quot; 

Due to his commitment to the New York Philharmonic and his many other activities, Bernstein had little time for composition during the 1960s, composing just two major works. His Symphony No. 3: &quot;Kaddish&quot; was written in 1963; Bernstein dedicated the work: &quot;To the Beloved Memory of John F. Kennedy.&quot; The work features a large orchestra, a full choir, a boys&#x27; choir, a soprano soloist, and a narrator. &quot;Kaddish&quot; refers to the Jewish prayer recited for the dead. Bernstein wrote the text of the narration himself; his wife, Felicia Montealegre, narrated the US premiere of the work.

In 1965, Bernstein took a sabbatical year from the New York Philharmonic to concentrate on composition, during which he composed &quot;Chichester Psalms.&quot; Commissioned by the Dean of Chichester Cathedral, Walter Hussey, the work premiered at Philharmonic Hall in New York City on July 15, 1965, conducted by Bernstein himself, and subsequently at Chichester Cathedral, conducted by John Birch. For his text, Bernstein chose excerpts from the Book of Psalms in the original Hebrew. In 2018, Bernstein&#x27;s Centennial year, &quot;Chichester Psalms&quot; was cited as the 5th-most performed concert work worldwide.

 Vienna Philharmonic debut 

In 1966, Bernstein began a lifelong rich relationship with the Vienna Philharmonic, conducting concerts as well as making his debut at the Vienna State Opera in Luchino Visconti&#x27;s production of &quot;Falstaff&quot; with Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau in the title role. Bernstein was largely responsible for restoring the works of Mahler to the Vienna Philharmonic&#x27;s core repertoire. Bernstein recorded Mahler&#x27;s Symphonies numerous times with the orchestra. Bernstein returned to the State Opera in 1968 for a production of &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; and in 1970 for Otto Schenk&#x27;s production of Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;.

=== 1970s: &quot;Mass&quot;, &quot;Dybbuk&quot; and international acclaim ===
During the 1970s, Bernstein&#x27;s company, Amberson, in partnership with Unitel, produced and coordinated filmed recordings of his symphonic concerts around the world. For the rest of his life, Bernstein preferred to derive his audio recordings from live performances. Nearly 80% of Bernstein&#x27;s recordings with his new recording partner, Deutsche Grammophon, were recorded live.

Bernstein&#x27;s major compositions during the 1970s were his &quot;Mass: A Theatre Piece for Singers, Players, and Dancers&quot;; his score for the ballet &quot;Dybbuk&quot;; his orchestral vocal work &quot;&quot;; and his U.S. bicentennial musical &quot;1600 Pennsylvania Avenue&quot;, with lyrics by Alan Jay Lerner, which was his last Broadway show and only theatrical flop.

 &quot;Mass: A Theatre Piece for Singers, Players, and Dancers&quot; (1971) 
In 1966, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis commissioned Bernstein to compose a work for the inauguration of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C., Bernstein began writing &quot;Mass&quot; in 1969 as a large-scale theatrical work based on the Tridentine Mass of the Catholic Church, and in 1971, Bernstein invited the young composer and lyricist Stephen Schwartz, who had recently opened the musical &quot;Godspell&quot; off-Broadway, to collaborate as co-lyricist. The world premiere took place on September 8, 1971, conducted by Maurice Peress, directed by Gordon Davidson, and choreographed by Alvin Ailey.

Bernstein&#x27;s score combines elements of musical theater, jazz, gospel, blues, folk, rock, and symphonic music, and the libretto combines Latin and English liturgy, Hebrew prayer, and additional lyrics written by Bernstein and Schwartz.

&quot;Mass&quot; received both rapturous and critical reactions, from audiences and music critics alike. While some members of the Catholic Church praised the piece&#x27;s expression of contemporary crises of faith, others considered it blasphemous. (In 2000, Pope John Paul II requested a performance of &quot;Mass&quot; at the Vatican itself.) President Richard Nixon declined to attend the premiere due to its anti-Vietnam War message. Viewpoints on &quot;Mass&quot; continue to evolve over time, and Edward Seckerson wrote in 2021, 50 years after its premiere: &quot;Put simply, no other work of Bernstein&#x27;s encapsulates exactly who he was as a man or as a musician; no other work displays his genius, his intellect, his musical virtuosity and innate theatricality quite like &quot;Mass&quot;.&quot;

 The Unanswered Question: Six Talks at Harvard 

In the 1972–73 academic year, Bernstein was appointed to the Charles Eliot Norton Chair as Professor of Poetry at Harvard, where he delivered six lectures, &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot;, which explored such elements as tonality, harmony, and form through the lens of Noam Chomsky&#x27;s linguistic theories. Bernstein provided musical examples from the piano, and pre-recorded musical works with the Boston Symphony Orchestra. Amberson arranged for the lectures to be videotaped at the WGBH studios in Boston. The six lectures were broadcast on PBS in 1976, and subsequently released on home video and published as a book.
&quot;Dybbuk&quot; (1974)

Bernstein collaborated with Jerome Robbins to create &quot;Dybbuk&quot;, a ballet based on S. Ansky&#x27;s play of the same name. The ballet depicts Ansky&#x27;s tale of a young woman possessed by a malicious spirit, known in Jewish folklore as a &quot;dybbuk&quot;. &quot;Dybbuk&quot; was premiered by the New York City Ballet at the New York State Theater on May 16, 1974, with Bernstein conducting. A revision of the choreography and the score was made later the same year, titled &quot;Dybbuk Variations&quot;. It received its premiere in November 1974.

 &quot;Songfest: A Cycle of American Poems for Six Singers and Orchestra&quot; 

Bernstein&#x27;s &quot;Songfest: A Cycle of American Poems for Six Singers and Orchestra&quot; premiered on October 11, 1977, the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., with the composer conducting the National Symphony Orchestra. The work was intended as a tribute to the 1976 American Bicentennial, but was not finished in time. The work sets an array of texts by 13 American poets spanning three centuries. Bernstein deliberately selected the widest possible array of literary voices to express the nation&#x27;s essential diversity; the poets include June Jordan, Julia de Burgos, Walt Whitman, and Langston Hughes. On July 4, 1985, Bernstein conducted a nationally televised performance of &quot;Songfest&quot; as part of the National Symphony&#x27;s annual &quot;A Capitol Fourth&quot; concert.

 International conducting and recordings 

After becoming Conductor Laureate of the New York Philharmonic in 1969, Bernstein took advantage of his freed-up schedule to increase the pace of his world travel, conducting twenty-nine orchestras throughout Europe, Asia, and the Americas, and making live recordings with them for both Unitel and Deutsche Grammophon. Bernstein founded Amberson Productions in 1969. In partnership with Unitel, Amberson created many video productions of concert performances, starting with Verdi&#x27;s Requiem Mass in St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1970, produced and directed by Humphrey Burton. Burton would go on to collaborate with Bernstein on his music video projects for the rest of Bernstein&#x27;s life.

In 1972, Bernstein recorded Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;, with Marilyn Horne in the title role and James McCracken as Don Jose, after leading several stage performances of the opera at the Metropolitan Opera. The recording was one of the first in stereo to use the original spoken dialogue between the sung portions of the opera. The recording was Bernstein&#x27;s first for Deutsche Grammophon and won a Grammy. In working with Unitel and Deutsche Grammophon, Bernstein made a host of video and audio recordings with such orchestras as Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Orchestre de Paris, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Orchestra Sinfonica di Roma della Rai, Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, and Orchestre National de France. In the late 1970s, Bernstein conducted a complete Beethoven symphony cycle with the Vienna Philharmonic, and cycles of Brahms and Schumann were to follow in the 1980s.

Among the many noteworthy Amberson productions with Unitel were Bernstein conducting Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 &quot;Resurrection&quot; with the London Symphony Orchestra at Ely Cathedral in 1973 and &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the Vienna State Opera in 1978. In 1970, Bernstein wrote and narrated &quot;Bernstein on Beethoven: A Celebration in Vienna,&quot; an in-depth exploration of Beethoven on the composer&#x27;s 200th birthday, filmed on location in and around Vienna. It features excerpts of Bernstein&#x27;s rehearsals and performance of &quot;Fidelio&quot; at the Vienna State Opera, directed by Otto Schenk (which was later revived and filmed in 1978); Bernstein playing the Piano Concerto No. 1 and conducting from the piano; and a performance of Symphony No. 9 with the Vienna Philharmonic, featuring the young Plácido Domingo among the soloists. The show, produced and directed by Humphrey Burton, was broadcast around the world and won an Emmy Award.

Also recorded by Unitel, in October 1976, was Bernstein&#x27;s concert in Munich with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and pianist Claudio Arrau to benefit Amnesty International. To honor his late wife and to continue their joint support for human rights, Bernstein subsequently established the Felicia Montealegre Bernstein Fund of Amnesty International USA to provide aid for human rights activists.

In 1979, Bernstein conducted the Berlin Philharmonic for the first and only time, in two charity concerts for Amnesty International featuring performances of Mahler&#x27;s Ninth Symphony, recorded live on Deutsche Grammophon. The invitation for the concerts had come from the orchestra and not from its principal conductor Herbert von Karajan. There has been speculation about why Karajan never invited Bernstein to conduct his orchestra. The full reasons will probably never be known—they were on friendly terms and respected each other, but sometimes practiced a little mutual one-upmanship such that they were described as fierce rivals. It was often suggested that Bernstein could not conduct in Berlin while Karajan was alive (the Berlin Philharmonic was regarded as Karajan&#x27;s own), the truth was that Berlin Philharmonic&#x27;s managing director Wolfgang Stresemann actually invited Bernstein but as part of a subscription concert series, which Bernstein disliked.

=== 1980s: &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, and Tanglewood ===

During the 1980s, Bernstein pursued a packed schedule, continuing to conduct, teach, compose, and produce several television documentaries. Bernstein&#x27;s most significant compositions of the decade were his opera &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;; &quot;Divertimento for Orchestra&quot;; &quot;Ḥalil&quot; for flute and orchestra; &quot;Concerto for Orchestra &quot;Jubilee Games&quot;&quot;; and the song cycle &quot;Arias and Barcarolles&quot;. Bernstein received the Kennedy Center Honors award in 1980, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1985, France&#x27;s Legion of Honour (Commander) in 1985, and Japan&#x27;s Praemium Imperiale in 1990, among others.

In the 1980s, Bernstein cemented his educational legacy by co-founding three music academies: Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival Orchestral Academy, and the Pacific Music Festival. Bernstein continued his longtime relationship with Tanglewood to the end of his life, including a lavish televised gala in 1988 to celebrate his 70th birthday, as well as his final concert performance in August 1990.

 &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; (1983) 

In 1983, Bernstein wrote a new opera, &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, with a libretto by Stephen Wadsworth. The opera premiered at the Houston Grand Opera on June 17, 1983, conducted by John DeMain. The opera was a sequel to Bernstein&#x27;s 1951 opera &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot;, which preceded the new opera at the premiere. In 1984, Bernstein and Wadsworth reconfigured &quot;A Quiet Place&quot; to include &quot;Trouble in Tahiti&quot; in its middle. This version was performed at La Scala and the Kennedy Center, with John Mauceri conducting. In 1986, Bernstein himself conducted and recorded the work at the Vienna State Opera.

 Conducting activities 

During the 1980s, in addition to continuing his productive relationship with the New York, Israel, and Vienna Philharmonics, Bernstein was also a regular guest conductor with several other major orchestras around the world. In Munich with the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Bernstein recorded works including Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;; Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Creation&quot;; and Mozart&#x27;s Requiem and &quot;Great Mass in C minor&quot;. In Rome with the Accademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, Bernstein recorded works by Debussy, as well as Puccini&#x27;s &quot;La bohème&quot;, featuring an all-American cast. In Amsterdam with Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, Bernstein recorded Mahler&#x27;s Symphonies No. 1, 4, and 9, among other works.

In May 1986, the London Symphony Orchestra mounted a Bernstein Festival at the Barbican Centre, featuring a concert in which Bernstein conducted his own works. Queen Elizabeth II attended the performance. In December 1989, Bernstein conducted the London Symphony Orchestra in his operetta &quot;Candide&quot; and subsequently recorded the work at Abbey Road Studios. The recording starred Jerry Hadley, June Anderson, Christa Ludwig, and Adolph Green in the leading roles. The live concert from the Barbican Centre in London was captured on video.

 Ode to &quot;Freedom&quot; (1989)

On December 25, 1989, Bernstein conducted Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 9 in East Berlin&#x27;s Konzerthaus as part of a celebration of the fall of the Berlin Wall. He had conducted the same work in West Berlin the previous day. The orchestra consisted of members representing the two German States and the four occupying powers of post-war Berlin. The Christmas Day concert was broadcast live to an estimated audience of 100 million people in more than twenty countries. For the occasion, Bernstein reworded Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s text of the &quot;Ode to Joy&quot;, replacing the word (joy) with the word (freedom). Bernstein added, &quot;I&#x27;m sure that Beethoven would have given us his blessing.&quot;

 Final concert at Tanglewood 

Bernstein conducted his last concert on August 19, 1990, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Tanglewood. He led Benjamin Britten&#x27;s &quot;Four Sea Interludes&quot; from &quot;Peter Grimes&quot; and Beethoven&#x27;s Symphony No. 7. The program also included Bernstein&#x27;s own &quot;Arias and Barcarolles&quot; in a new orchestration by Bright Sheng. However, poor health prevented Bernstein from preparing it, and Tanglewood Conducting Fellow Carl St. Clair was engaged to conduct the work in his stead.

Bernstein suffered a coughing fit during the third movement of the Beethoven, but continued to conduct the piece to its conclusion, leaving the stage during the ovation, appearing exhausted and in pain. The concert was later issued on CD as &quot;Leonard Bernstein – The Final Concert&quot; by Deutsche Grammophon.

 Amberson Productions 

Bernstein&#x27;s Amberson Productions continued its collaborations with Unitel throughout the 1980s. In 1982, PBS aired an Emmy-nominated series &quot;Bernstein/Beethoven&quot; featuring all nine Beethoven symphonies and other works using films that Unitel had recorded of Bernstein conducting the Vienna Philharmonic in the late 1970s. The series includes conversations between Bernstein and actor Maximilian Schell, who also read from Beethoven&#x27;s letters.
In 1984, Bernstein conducted a Deutsche Grammophon recording of &quot;West Side Story&quot;, his only recording of the entire work. The album, featuring opera singers Kiri Te Kanawa, José Carreras, Marilyn Horne, and Tatiana Troyanos, was an international bestseller. An Emmy-nominated film &quot;The Making of West Side Story&quot; documented the recording process.

Other documentaries that Bernstein made during the 1980s include &quot;The Little Drummer Boy&quot;, which delved into the music of Gustav Mahler, and &quot;The Love of Three Orchestras&quot;, exploring his work with the New York, Vienna, and Israel Philharmonics.

 Educational activities

Bernstein&#x27;s nurturing experience at the Tanglewood Music Festival inspired him to use his international influence to recreate that environment for young musicians in the final years of his life. During summer 1987, Bernstein celebrated the 100th anniversary of Nadia Boulanger at the American Conservatory in Fontainebleau. Bernstein gave a master class inside the castle of Fontainebleau.

 Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute 

In 1982, Bernstein, with Los Angeles Philharmonic general manager Ernest Fleischmann and University of Southern California professor Daniel Lewis, co-founded the Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, a summer training academy inspired by Tanglewood. Bernstein served as artistic co-director and taught conducting classes for two summers. During that time, he performed and recorded American works, including some of his own, with the Los Angeles Philharmonic for Deutsche Grammophon.

 Orchestra Academy of the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival 

In May 1986, Bernstein conducted the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus for the inaugural concert of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, in a performance of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Die Schöpfung&quot; (&quot;The Creation&quot;). He returned the following year when he founded the festival&#x27;s Orchestra Academy, once again recreating the nurturing atmosphere of Bernstein&#x27;s Tanglewood experience. Over three summers, Bernstein took the students on international tours to Germany, Italy, and the Soviet Union.

To commemorate Bernstein&#x27;s legacy as an educator and founder of the Orchestra Academy, the festival created the Leonard Bernstein Award in 2002, which has honored young musicians including Lang Lang, Jonathan Biss, and Alisa Weilerstein, among many others.

 Founding of the Pacific Music Festival 

In 1990, Bernstein&#x27;s final summer, he founded the Pacific Music Festival in Sapporo, Japan with Michael Tilson Thomas and the London Symphony Orchestra. The Festival&#x27;s goal was to emphasize musical training for young students in the Pacific region.

In his opening address, Bernstein said: &quot;And my decision has been, without too much thought, to spend most of the remaining energy and time the Lord grants me in education and sharing, as much as possible, with younger people.&quot; As artistic director, Bernstein worked with the students in that first summer, but had to cut his time short due to ill health.

 Bernstein Education Through the Arts (BETA) Fund 

In 1990, Bernstein received the Praemium Imperiale, an international prize awarded by the Japan Arts Association for lifetime achievement in the arts. Bernstein used the $100,000 prize to establish The Bernstein Education Through the Arts (BETA) Fund. He provided this grant to develop an arts-based education program. The Leonard Bernstein Center was posthumously established in April 1992, and initiated extensive school-based research, ultimately leading to the current Leonard Bernstein Artful Learning Program.

==Personal life==

Bernstein had two younger siblings, Shirley and Burton. The three children lived with their parents, Samuel and Jennie, in the suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts, in a community of mostly Eastern European Jewish immigrants.

Bernstein had asthma, and the condition kept him from serving in the military during World War II.

Bernstein married actress Felicia Montealegre Cohn on September 9, 1951. They had three children: Jamie, Alexander, and Nina. The Bernstein family lived in New York City and Fairfield, Connecticut, and maintained a close-knit atmosphere surrounded by extended family and friends. The family owned a house in Redding, Connecticut, which they sold in 1964. Bernstein had a studio with a piano in each of his dwellings. The contents of his former studio at Fairfield, Connecticut are housed at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music.

Throughout his life, Bernstein had affairs with both men and women. In April 1943, he sought advice from Aaron Copland about living as a gay man in the public eye, a notion he brought up again in a letter to David Oppenheim in July of that year. In a private letter written after their marriage, Felicia acknowledged her husband&#x27;s sexual orientation. She wrote him: &quot;You are a homosexual and may never change – you don&#x27;t admit to the possibility of a double life, but if your peace of mind, your health, your whole nervous system depend on a certain sexual pattern what can you do?&quot;

In 1976, Bernstein left Felicia for a period to live in Northern California with Tom Cothran, a music scholar who had assisted him on research for the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures that Bernstein delivered at Harvard. The following year, Felicia was diagnosed with lung cancer. Bernstein moved back in with her and cared for her until her death on June 16, 1978.

Bernstein continued to have relationships with men until his death on October 14, 1990.

When he was not composing and conducting, Bernstein enjoyed skiing, playing tennis, and engaging in all manner of word games, especially anagrams.

==Death and legacy==
Bernstein announced his retirement from conducting on October 9, 1990. He died five days later at the age of 72, in his New York apartment at The Dakota, of a heart attack brought on by mesothelioma. A longtime heavy smoker, Bernstein had emphysema from his mid-50s. On the day of his funeral procession through the streets of Manhattan, construction workers removed their hats and waved, calling out &quot;Goodbye, Lenny&quot;. Bernstein is buried near the summit of Battle Hill at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York, next to his wife and with a copy of the score of Mahler&#x27;s Fifth Symphony lying across his heart.

On August 25, 2018 (the 100th anniversary of his birth), Bernstein was honored with a Google Doodle. The Skirball Cultural Center in Los Angeles created an exhibition titled &quot;Leonard Bernstein at 100&quot; for his centennial.

Bradley Cooper&#x27;s drama film &quot;Maestro&quot; (2023) chronicles the relationship between Bernstein (played by Cooper) and his wife, Felicia Montealegre (played by Carey Mulligan). Produced by Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese, the film premiered at the Venice International Film Festival. As the Spotlight Gala feature of the 61st New York Film Festival, it was the first film presentation at the recently renovated David Geffen Hall in Lincoln Center, which was also where Bernstein had conducted as music director of the New York Philharmonic from its opening as Philharmonic Hall in 1962 until 1969.

Bernstein sought to make music both intelligible and enjoyable to all. Through his educational efforts, including several books and the creation of two major international music festivals, Bernstein influenced several generations of young musicians.
==Social activism and humanitarian efforts==
Since earliest adulthood, Bernstein was committed to furthering social change and making the world a better place. Throughout his life, Bernstein fought for a variety of political and humanitarian causes, from the civil rights movement to the Vietnam War protests to nuclear disarmament to advocacy during the AIDS crisis.

Bernstein&#x27;s first public efforts for social change became apparent in 1939 when, as a college student at Harvard, he organized and led a performance of Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s recently banned musical, &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, about the struggles of the working class.

=== FBI file ===
Bernstein was involved in numerous left-wing causes and organizations since the 1940s, at which time the FBI began its decades-long monitoring of Bernstein&#x27;s activities &quot;for his ties to communist organizations.&quot; In the 1980s, through the Freedom of Information Act, he was able to view his FBI file, which was over 800 pages long. In the early 1950s, he was briefly blacklisted by the United States Department of State and CBS, but he was never asked to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee.

=== Civil rights ===
Bernstein expressed his support of civil rights in the United States in numerous ways. Some examples include multiracial casting in &quot;On the Town&quot; in the 1940s; instigating of blind auditions at the New York Philharmonic in the 1960s; and the robust support of artists of color in classical music.

On March 24, 1965, at the invitation of Harry Belafonte, Bernstein participated in the Stars for Freedom Rally, a star-studded performance in support of the marchers heading from Selma to Montgomery to demand voting rights. The next day, Martin Luther King Jr., the leader of the march, delivered one of his most famous speeches, &quot;How Long, Not Long&quot;.

==== &quot;Radical Chic&quot; ====
On January 14, 1970, Bernstein and his wife Felicia held an event at their Manhattan apartment seeking to raise awareness and funds for the defense of members of the Black Panther Party, known as the Panther 21. &quot;The New York Times&quot; initially covered the gathering in its society section, but later published an editorial harshly unfavorable to Bernstein.

The story became widely publicized, climaxing in June of that year with the appearance of &quot;Radical Chic: That Party at Lenny&#x27;s&quot;, a cover story by journalist Tom Wolfe in &quot;New York Magazine&quot;. The article led to the popularization of the pejorative term &quot;radical chic&quot;. Bernstein and his wife Felicia received hate mail, and their building was picketed by Jewish Defense League protesters. Bernstein&#x27;s FBI file later revealed that the Bureau had generated the letters, and had implanted agents to make the protests look more substantial.

=== Anti-Vietnam war efforts ===

On January 21, 1968, Bernstein and Paul Newman co-hosted &quot;Broadway for Peace&quot; at Lincoln Center&#x27;s Philharmonic Hall to support the Congressional Peace Campaign Committee, which funded congressional campaigns opposing the Vietnam War. For the occasion, Bernstein composed a song, &quot;So Pretty&quot;, sung by Barbra Streisand accompanied by Bernstein on the piano.

On January 19, 1973, Bernstein conducted members of the National Symphony Orchestra in a &quot;Concert of Peace&quot; at the Washington National Cathedral. The free performance of Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Mass in Time of War&quot;, which took place on the eve of the second inauguration of Richard Nixon, was in protest of Nixon&#x27;s failure to bring an end to the Vietnam War.

=== Rostropovich and the Soviet Union ===
Bernstein played a key role in the release of renowned cellist and conductor Mstislav Rostropovich from the USSR in 1974. Rostropovich, a strong believer in free speech and democracy, had been officially held in disgrace; his concerts and tours both at home and abroad cancelled; and in 1972 he was prohibited to travel outside of the Soviet Union. During a trip to the USSR in 1974, U.S. Senator from Massachusetts Ted Kennedy and his wife Joan, urged by Bernstein and others in the cultural sphere, mentioned Rostropovich&#x27;s situation to Leonid Brezhnev, the Soviet Union Communist Party Leader. Two days later, Rostropovich was granted his exit visa.

=== Nuclear disarmament ===
Bernstein was a committed and outspoken supporter of nuclear disarmament. In 1980, he gave a commencement speech at Johns Hopkins University warning the graduating class of the dangers of nuclear proliferation. In 1983, he dedicated the activities surrounding his 65th birthday to the issue of nuclear disarmament. In 1985, he brought the European Community Youth Orchestra on a &quot;Journey for Peace&quot; tour across Europe and Japan, performing at the Hiroshima Peace Ceremony to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the bombing.

=== Advocacy for AIDS research and patient care ===
In the 1980s, Bernstein was frustrated that the Reagan Administration took so long to acknowledge the existence of the AIDS epidemic, let alone provide resources for research and patient care. Bernstein was galvanized to provide advocacy however he could. In a written statement for a June 1983 benefit for AIDS advocacy in Houston, Bernstein wrote: &quot;AIDS is , repeat , the Gay Plague it is so often made out to be; it is part of the human condition, and must be universally researched and annihilated.&quot;

On April 30, 1983, at Madison Square Garden in New York City, Bernstein participated in one of the earliest HIV / AIDS fundraisers, which raised over $250,000 for the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis (GMHC). Bernstein conducted the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus Orchestra with mezzo-soprano Shirley Verrett in &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;.

On November 8, 1987, Bernstein participated in another event to benefit the Gay Men&#x27;s Health Crisis. The concert at Carnegie Hall, &quot;Music for Life&quot;, was dedicated to Dr. Mathilde Krim and her work at the American Foundation for AIDS Research (amFAR). Bernstein was joined by Leontyne Price, Marilyn Horne, Luciano Pavarotti, and Yo-Yo Ma, among others.

On November 15, 1989, Bernstein refused the National Medal of Arts from President George H. W. Bush in protest against the revoked National Endowment for the Arts grant for a New York exhibit of AIDS-related art.

=== Philanthropy ===
Bernstein funded a variety of fellowships, funds, and scholarships including ones at the Tanglewood Music Center, Jacobs School of Music, Brandeis University, and the ASCAP Foundation. Several of these funds were named for his late wife Felicia Montealegre, including scholarships at the Juilliard School, Columbia University School of the Arts, New York University Tisch School of the Arts, and the Felicia Montealegre Bernstein Fund of Amnesty International USA.

Bernstein had a lifelong interest in integrating the arts into general education. When he won the Japan Art Association&#x27;s Praemium Imperiale award in 1990, Bernstein used the $100,000 prize money to initiate a project in Nashville, Tennessee that would eventually lead to the current nationwide teaching model known as Artful Learning.

== Influence and characteristics ==
=== As a conductor ===

Leonard Bernstein was one of the most important conductors of the 20th century. He was held in high regard by musicians around the world, including the members of the New York Philharmonic, which he led for eleven seasons; the Vienna Philharmonic, where he received an honorary membership; the Boston Symphony Orchestra, which he conducted principally at Tanglewood for over 50 years; the London Symphony Orchestra, of which he was president; and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, where he appeared regularly as their guest conductor. Audiences worldwide eagerly anticipated Bernstein&#x27;s performances, from New York to Tokyo to Caracas to Sydney.

In 1943, Bernstein&#x27;s last-minute conducting debut in Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic, which was broadcast live nationwide, caused him to become famous overnight. He soon became the first American-born, American-trained conductor to achieve international status, at a time when conductors traditionally came from Europe.

Bernstein&#x27;s three major conducting mentors were Serge Koussevitzky, Dimitri Mitropoulos, and Fritz Reiner. Bernstein&#x27;s conducting was characterized by his physically expressive podium manner. Orchestra members often remarked that Bernstein&#x27;s every gesture conveyed a specific musical communication for them.

Bernstein performed a wide classical music repertoire from the Baroque era to the music of his time. Bernstein conducted and recorded definitive interpretations of works by traditional composers such as Haydn, Beethoven, Brahms, Schumann, and Tchaikovsky; championed music by lesser known composers such as Mahler, Sibelius, and Nielsen; and advocated modern composers such as Stravinsky, Hindemith, Shostakovich, and Ligeti. Bernstein programmed American composers everywhere in the world that he conducted, sharing the music of Gershwin, Copland, and Ives. He expanded the definitions of the genres that could be included in the concert hall by programming jazz, musical theater, and works from Latin America.

A skilled pianist, he often conducted piano concertos from the keyboard, including works by Gershwin, Mozart, Beethoven, and Ravel.

Bernstein was also an influential conducting teacher and mentor. During his many years at Tanglewood, Schleswig-Holstein and elsewhere, Bernstein directly influenced many young conductors, including Seiji Ozawa, Claudio Abbado, Lorin Maazel, Marin Alsop, Michael Tilson Thomas, James DePreist, Edo de Waart, Eiji Oue, JoAnn Falletta, Yutaka Sado, Maurice Peress, Carl St. Clair, John Mauceri, and Jaap van Zweden.

=== As an educator ===
Bernstein&#x27;s impact as an educator stretched far beyond his music students. Through the medium of television, Bernstein introduced millions of viewers worldwide to symphonic music. His &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts with the New York Philharmonic&quot; brought in younger viewers, while his &quot;Omnibus&quot;, &quot;Ford Presents&quot;, and &quot;Lincoln Presents&quot; brought musical concepts to general audiences.

In the 1950s, Bernstein taught at Brandeis University for several years, and founded their Festival of the Creative Arts, which the institution later named after him. Over the course of his career, Bernstein taught at numerous locations worldwide, including at the Tanglewood Institute, and founded three summer festivals of his own: Los Angeles Philharmonic Institute, Orchestral Academy of the Schleswig-Holstein Musik Festival, and the Pacific Music Festival.

=== As a composer ===

Bernstein&#x27;s music combined genres and musical styles. He wove together elements of classical, jazz, popular, Broadway, Latin, Jewish music, and more to create a musical fabric uniquely his own.

Bernstein&#x27;s Jewish influences are clearly audible in both his symphonic and theatre works. Two of his symphonies, &quot;Symphony No. 1: &quot;Jeremiah&quot;&quot; and &quot;Symphony No. 3: &quot;Kaddish&quot;&quot;, incorporated Hebrew texts and sources, as did his &quot;Chichester Psalms&quot;, &quot;Hashkiveinu&quot;, &quot;Four Sabras&quot;, &quot;Halil&quot;, and &quot;Dybbuk&quot;. In two of his theatre works, &quot;Candide&quot; and &quot;West Side Story&quot;, the call of the shofar can clearly be heard in the score. Bernstein occasionally turned to Christian sources as well, for example in his &quot;Missa Brevis&quot; and his theatre work &quot;MASS&quot;.

Among the 20th century composers who influenced Bernstein were Aaron Copland, Igor Stravinsky, Maurice Ravel, George Gershwin, and Marc Blitzstein. Bernstein&#x27;s score for &quot;West Side Story&quot; incorporated multiple elements from classical, Latin-Caribbean, and bebop jazz. While his music was rooted in tonality, many of his works incorporated 12-tone elements – from the atonal score of the ballet &quot;Dybbuk&quot; to his &quot;Symphony No. 3: &quot;Kaddish&quot;&quot;.

Bernstein&#x27;s Broadway shows — &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;On the Town&quot;, &quot;Wonderful Town,&quot; and &quot;Candide&quot; — as well as his theatre piece &quot;MASS&quot; continue to be produced worldwide. In addition to his works for the stage, all three of his symphonies, his &quot;Serenade&quot;, and his song cycles, including &quot;Songfest&quot; and &quot;Arias and Barcaroles&quot;, are inspired by theatrical and literary sources. Bernstein himself said that virtually all his compositions &quot;could in some sense be thought of as &#x27;theatre&#x27; pieces&quot;.

Bernstein&#x27;s keen sense of rhythm lent his compositions readily to use for ballet and other dance forms. In addition to his own ballets — &quot;Fancy Free&quot;, &quot;Facsimile&quot;, and &quot;Dybbuk&quot; — and musicals, many works were choreographed in his lifetime, as well as afterward, for both stage and film. Choreographers of Bernstein&#x27;s music include Jerome Robbins, Alvin Ailey, John Neumeier, Alexei Ratmansky, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker, Larry Keigwin, and Justin Peck.

The eclectic nature of Bernstein&#x27;s music often generated criticism, particularly from the academic community of the mid-20th century where the Second Viennese School and its 12-tone approach held sway. Bernstein received additional criticism for his theatre work &quot;MASS&quot;, which some members of the Catholic Church considered offensive. The work&#x27;s thinly veiled antiwar stance was enough to prevent President Richard Nixon from attending the premiere at the 1971 opening of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, D.C. While his eclecticism, as well as his fearlessness in taking on social issues, generated controversy in his lifetime, Bernstein is now considered a hero and role model for the next generation of composers.

Despite frequent criticism in his lifetime, Bernstein&#x27;s music has endured into the 21st century and is regularly performed, discussed, and recorded around the world. In 2008–09, his 90th anniversary year, Bernstein was the second-most frequently performed American composer (behind Aaron Copland). In 2018, his centennial year, Bernstein was the third-most played composer worldwide for the year, alongside Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, and Brahms. That year, four of the five most-played concert works worldwide were Bernstein compositions: &quot;Symphonic Dances from West Side Story&quot;, &quot;Overture to Candide&quot;, &quot;Serenade (after Plato&#x27;s Symposium)&quot;, and &quot;Chichester Psalms&quot;.

==Audio recordings==
Between 1945 and 1950, Bernstein recorded a variety of works for RCA Victor, primarily consisting of his own compositions and those of other American composers. During this time, he also recorded for Decca Records and Hargail Records. His recordings for Decca Records contains some &quot;musical analysis&quot; recordings in a form similar to his &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts&quot;.

On April 2, 1956, Bernstein signed his first long-term contract with Columbia Records regarding services as conductor, piano soloist, and as commentator. Between 1956 and 1979, Bernstein recorded over 500 compositions for Columbia, 455 of which were recorded with the New York Philharmonic. Bernstein&#x27;s typical pattern of recording at that time was to record major works in the studio immediately following the orchestra&#x27;s subscription concerts or on one of the &quot;Young People&#x27;s Concerts.&quot; Any spare studio time that remained was used to record short orchestral showpieces and other works.

In 1990, Sony Classical acquired Columbia/CBS Records. Between 1992 and 1993, Sony reissued and digitally remastered Bernstein&#x27;s complete Columbia catalog as part of a 100-volume, 125-CD &quot;Royal Edition&quot;, featuring watercolors by Charles, Prince of Wales on the covers.

Between 1997 and 2001, Sony issued the &quot;Bernstein Century&quot; series, which was a combination of new re-releases and items from the &quot;Royal Edition&quot;. The rights to Bernstein&#x27;s RCA Victor recordings became owned by Sony following its 2008 acquisition of Bertelsmann Music Group (BMG). The complete Bernstein Columbia and RCA Victor catalog was reissued on CD in a three-volume series of box sets (released in 2010, 2014, and 2018, respectively) comprising a total of 198 discs under the mantle &quot;Leonard Bernstein Edition&quot;.

In 1972, Bernstein made his first recording for Deutsche Grammophon: Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. On October 17, 1976, Bernstein made his first live recording on Deutsche Grammophon, leading to a 14-year collaboration until his death in 1990. The vast majority of the DG recordings were of live performances, which had become Bernstein&#x27;s preferred approach to recording. From the 1970s onward, Bernstein&#x27;s audio recordings were supplemented with films produced by Amberson Productions and Unitel, which were subsequently released on LaserDisc and DVD.

Bernstein recorded for other labels as well. Notable exceptions include recordings of Gustav Mahler&#x27;s &quot;Song of the Earth&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s 15th piano concerto and &quot;Linz&quot; symphony with the Vienna Philharmonic for Decca Records (1966); Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie fantastique&quot; and &quot;Harold en Italie&quot; (1976) for EMI; and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot; (1981) for Philips Records. In total, Bernstein received 63 Grammy Award nominations and was awarded 16 Grammys in various categories, including for posthumously released recordings. He was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Grammy in 1985.

<text>The Java Remote Method Invocation (Java RMI) is a Java API that performs remote method invocation, the object-oriented equivalent of remote procedure calls (RPC), with support for direct transfer of serialized Java classes and distributed garbage-collection.

The original implementation depends on Java Virtual Machine (JVM) class-representation mechanisms and it thus only supports making calls from one JVM to another. The protocol underlying this Java-only implementation is known as Java Remote Method Protocol (JRMP). In order to support code running in a non-JVM context, programmers later developed a CORBA version.

Usage of the term RMI may denote solely the programming interface or may signify both the API and JRMP, IIOP, or another implementation, whereas the term RMI-IIOP (read: RMI over IIOP) specifically denotes the RMI interface delegating most of the functionality to the supporting CORBA implementation.

The basic idea of Java RMI, the distributed garbage-collection (DGC) protocol, and much of the architecture underlying the original Sun implementation, come from the &quot;network objects&quot; feature of Modula-3.

==Generalized code==
The programmers of the original RMI API generalized the code somewhat to support different implementations, such as a HTTP transport. Additionally, the ability to pass arguments &quot;by value&quot; was added to CORBA in order to be compatible with the RMI interface. Still, the RMI-IIOP and JRMP implementations do not have fully identical interfaces.

RMI functionality comes in the package , while most of Sun&#x27;s implementation is located in the codice_1 package. Note that with Java versions before Java 5.0 developers had to compile RMI stubs in a separate compilation step using codice_2. Version 5.0 of Java and beyond no longer require this step.

==Jini version==
Jini offers a more advanced version of RMI in Java. It functions similarly but provides more advanced security, object discovery capabilities, and other mechanisms for distributed object applications.
==Example==
The following classes implement a simple client-server program using RMI that displays a message.

; codice_3 interface : defines the interface that is used by the client and implemented by the server.
import java.rmi.Remote;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;

public interface RmiServerIntf extends Remote {
 String getMessage() throws RemoteException;


; codice_4 class : listens to RMI requests and implements the interface which is used by the client to invoke remote methods.
import java.rmi.Naming;
import java.rmi.RemoteException;
import java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject;
import java.rmi.registry.*;

public class RmiServer extends UnicastRemoteObject implements RmiServerIntf {
 public static final String MESSAGE = &quot;Hello World&quot;;

 public RmiServer() throws RemoteException {
 super(0); // required to avoid the &#x27;rmic&#x27; step, see below

 public String getMessage() {
 return MESSAGE;

 public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
 System.out.println(&quot;RMI server started&quot;);

 try { //special exception handler for registry creation
 LocateRegistry.createRegistry(1099);
 System.out.println(&quot;java RMI registry created.&quot;);
 } catch (RemoteException e) {
 //do nothing, error means registry already exists
 System.out.println(&quot;java RMI registry already exists.&quot;);
 
 //Instantiate RmiServer
 RmiServer server = new RmiServer();

 // Bind this object instance to the name &quot;RmiServer&quot;
 Naming.rebind(&quot;//localhost/RmiServer&quot;, server);
 System.out.println(&quot;PeerServer bound in registry&quot;);
}
; codice_5 class : this is the client which gets the reference (a proxy) to the remote object living on the server and invokes its method to get a message. If the server object implemented java.io.Serializable instead of java.rmi.Remote, it would be serialized and passed to the client as a value.
import java.rmi.Naming;

public class RmiClient {
 public static void main(String args[]) throws Exception {
 RmiServerIntf server = (RmiServerIntf)Naming.lookup(&quot;//localhost/RmiServer&quot;);
 System.out.println(server.getMessage());
}
Before running this example, we need to make a &#x27;stub&#x27; file for the interface we used. For this task we have the RMI compiler - &#x27;rmic&#x27;
*Note: we make a stub file from the &#x27;*.class&#x27; file with the implementation of the remote interface, not from the &#x27;*.java&#x27; file.

 rmic RmiServer

Note that since version 5.0 of J2SE support for dynamically generated stub files has been added, and rmic is only provided for backwards compatibility with earlier runtimes, or for programs that don&#x27;t provide an explicit port number (or zero) when exporting remote objects, which is required for generated stubs to be possible, as described in the Javadoc for UnicastRemoteObject. See the comment in the constructor above.

<text>The Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA) is a standard defined by the Object Management Group (OMG) designed to facilitate the communication of systems that are deployed on diverse platforms. CORBA enables collaboration between systems on different operating systems, programming languages, and computing hardware. CORBA uses an object-oriented model although the systems that use the CORBA do not have to be object-oriented. CORBA is an example of the distributed object paradigm.

While briefly popular in the mid to late 1990s, CORBA&#x27;s complexity, inconsistency, and high licensing costs have relegated it to being a niche technology.

==Overview==
CORBA enables communication between software written in different languages and running on different computers. Implementation details from specific operating systems, programming languages, and hardware platforms are all removed from the responsibility of developers who use CORBA. CORBA normalizes the method-call semantics between application objects residing either in the same address-space (application) or in remote address-spaces (same host, or remote host on a network). Version 1.0 was released in October 1991.

CORBA uses an interface definition language (IDL) to specify the interfaces that objects present to the outer world. CORBA then specifies a &quot;mapping&quot; from IDL to a specific implementation language like C++ or Java. Standard mappings exist for Ada, C, C++, C++11, COBOL, Java, Lisp, PL/I, Object Pascal, Python, Ruby, and Smalltalk. Non-standard mappings exist for C#, Erlang, Perl, Tcl, and Visual Basic implemented by object request brokers (ORBs) written for those languages. Versions of IDL have changed significantly with annotations replacing some pragmas.

The CORBA specification dictates there shall be an ORB through which an application would interact with other objects. This is how it is implemented in practice:

# The application initializes the ORB, and accesses an internal &quot;Object Adapter&quot;, which maintains things like reference counting, object (and reference) instantiation policies, and object lifetime policies.
# The Object Adapter is used to register instances of the &quot;generated code classes&quot;. Generated code classes are the result of compiling the user IDL code, which translates the high-level interface definition into an OS- and language-specific class base for use by the user application. This step is necessary in order to enforce CORBA semantics and provide a clean user process for interfacing with the CORBA infrastructure.

Some IDL mappings are more difficult to use than others. For example, due to the nature of Java, the IDL-Java mapping is rather straightforward and makes usage of CORBA very simple in a Java application. This is also true of the IDL to Python mapping. The C++ mapping requires the programmer to learn datatypes that predate the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). By contrast, the C++11 mapping is easier to use, but requires heavy use of the STL. Since the C language is not object-oriented, the IDL to C mapping requires a C programmer to manually emulate object-oriented features.

In order to build a system that uses or implements a CORBA-based distributed object interface, a developer must either obtain or write the IDL code that defines the object-oriented interface to the logic the system will use or implement. Typically, an ORB implementation includes a tool called an IDL compiler that translates the IDL interface into the target language for use in that part of the system. A traditional compiler then compiles the generated code to create the linkable-object files for use in the application. This diagram illustrates how the generated code is used within the CORBA infrastructure:

This figure illustrates the high-level paradigm for remote interprocess communications using CORBA. The CORBA specification further addresses data typing, exceptions, network protocols, communication timeouts, etc. For example: Normally the server side has the Portable Object Adapter (POA) that redirects calls either to the local servants or (to balance the load) to the other servers. The CORBA specification (and thus this figure) leaves various aspects of distributed system to the application to define including object lifetimes (although reference counting semantics are available to applications), redundancy/fail-over, memory management, dynamic load balancing, and application-oriented models such as the separation between display/data/control semantics (e.g. see Model–view–controller), etc.

In addition to providing users with a language and a platform-neutral remote procedure call (RPC) specification, CORBA defines commonly needed services such as transactions and security, events, time, and other domain-specific interface models.

==Versions history==
This table presents the history of CORBA standard versions.
Note that IDL changes have progressed with annotations (e.g. @unit, @topic) replacing some pragmas.

==Servants==
A servant is the invocation target containing methods for handling the remote method invocations. In the newer CORBA versions, the remote object (on the server side) is split into the object &quot;(that is exposed to remote invocations)&quot; and servant &quot;(to which the former part forwards the method calls)&quot;. It can be one &quot;servant&quot; per remote &quot;object&quot;, or the same servant can support several (possibly all) objects, associated with the given Portable Object Adapter. The &quot;servant&quot; for each &quot;object&quot; can be set or found &quot;once and forever&quot; (servant activation) or dynamically chosen each time the method on that object is invoked (servant location). Both servant locator and servant activator can forward the calls to another server. In total, this system provides a very powerful means to balance the load, distributing requests between several machines. In the object-oriented languages, both remote &quot;object&quot; and its &quot;servant&quot; are objects from the viewpoint of the object-oriented programming.

&quot;Incarnation&quot; is the act of associating a servant with a CORBA object so that it may service requests. Incarnation provides a concrete servant form for the virtual CORBA object. Activation and deactivation refer only to CORBA objects, while the terms incarnation and etherealization refer to servants. However, the lifetimes of objects and servants are independent. You always incarnate a servant before calling activate_object(), but the reverse is also possible, create_reference() activates an object without incarnating a servant, and servant incarnation is later done on demand with a Servant Manager.

The &quot;&quot; (POA) is the CORBA object responsible for splitting the server side remote invocation handler into the remote &quot;object&quot; and its &quot;servant&quot;. The object is exposed for the remote invocations, while the servant contains the methods that are actually handling the requests. The servant for each object can be chosen either statically (once) or dynamically (for each remote invocation), in both cases allowing the call forwarding to another server.

On the server side, the POAs form a tree-like structure, where each POA is responsible for one or more objects being served. The branches of this tree can be independently activated/deactivated, have the different code for the servant location or activation and the different request handling policies.

==Features==
The following describes some of the most significant ways that CORBA can be used to facilitate communication among distributed objects.

===Objects By Reference===
This reference is either acquired through a stringified Uniform Resource Locator (URL), NameService lookup (similar to Domain Name System (DNS)), or passed-in as a method parameter during a call.

Object references are lightweight objects matching the interface of the real object (remote or local). Method calls on the reference result in subsequent calls to the ORB and blocking on the thread while waiting for a reply, success, or failure. The parameters, return data (if any), and exception data are marshaled internally by the ORB according to the local language and OS mapping.

===Data By Value===
The CORBA Interface Definition Language provides the language- and OS-neutral inter-object communication definition. CORBA Objects are passed by reference, while data (integers, doubles, structs, enums, etc.) are passed by value. The combination of Objects-by-reference and data-by-value provides the means to enforce great data typing while compiling clients and servers, yet preserve the flexibility inherent in the CORBA problem-space.

===Objects By Value (OBV)===
Apart from remote objects, the CORBA and RMI-IIOP define the concept of the OBV and Valuetypes. The code inside the methods of Valuetype objects is executed locally by default. If the OBV has been received from the remote side, the needed code must be either &quot;a priori&quot; known for both sides or dynamically downloaded from the sender. To make this possible, the record, defining OBV, contains the Code Base that is a space-separated list of URLs whence this code should be downloaded. The OBV can also have the remote methods.

===CORBA Component Model (CCM)===
CORBA Component Model (CCM) is an addition to the family of CORBA definitions. It was introduced with CORBA 3 and it describes a standard application framework for CORBA components. Though not dependent on &quot;language dependent Enterprise Java Beans (EJB)&quot;, it is a more general form of EJB, providing four component types instead of the two that EJB defines. It provides an abstraction of entities that can provide and accept services through well-defined named interfaces called &quot;ports&quot;.

The CCM has a component container, where software components can be deployed. The container offers a set of services that the components can use. These services include (but are not limited to) notification, authentication, persistence, and transaction processing. These are the most-used services any distributed system requires, and, by moving the implementation of these services from the software components to the component container, the complexity of the components is dramatically reduced.

===Portable interceptors===
Portable interceptors are the &quot;hooks&quot;, used by CORBA and RMI-IIOP to mediate the most important functions of the CORBA system. The CORBA standard defines the following types of interceptors:

# IOR interceptors mediate the creation of the new references to the remote objects, presented by the current server.
# Client interceptors usually mediate the remote method calls on the client (caller) side. If the object Servant exists on the same server where the method is invoked, they also mediate the local calls.
# Server interceptors mediate the handling of the remote method calls on the server (handler) side.

The interceptors can attach the specific information to the messages being sent and IORs being created. This information can be later read by the corresponding interceptor on the remote side. Interceptors can also throw forwarding exceptions, redirecting request to another target.

===General InterORB Protocol (GIOP)===

The GIOP is an abstract protocol by which Object request brokers (ORBs) communicate. Standards associated with the protocol are maintained by the Object Management Group (OMG). The GIOP architecture provides several concrete protocols, including:

# Internet InterORB Protocol (IIOP) – The Internet Inter-Orb Protocol is an implementation of the GIOP for use over the Internet, and provides a mapping between GIOP messages and the TCP/IP layer.
# SSL InterORB Protocol (SSLIOP) – SSLIOP is IIOP over SSL, providing encryption and authentication.
# HyperText InterORB Protocol (HTIOP) – HTIOP is IIOP over HTTP, providing transparent proxy bypassing.
# Zipped IOP (ZIOP) – A zipped version of GIOP that reduces the bandwidth usage.

===VMCID (Vendor Minor Codeset ID)===
Each standard CORBA exception includes a minor code to designate the subcategory of the exception. Minor exception codes are of type unsigned long and consist of a 20-bit &quot;Vendor Minor Codeset ID&quot; (VMCID), which occupies the high order 20 bits, and the minor code proper which occupies the low order 12 bits.

Minor codes for the standard exceptions are prefaced by the VMCID assigned to OMG, defined as the unsigned long constant CORBA::OMGVMCID, which has the VMCID allocated to OMG occupying the high order 20 bits. The minor exception codes associated with the standard exceptions that are found in Table 3–13 on page 3-58 are or-ed with OMGVMCID to get the minor code value that is returned in the ex_body structure (see Section 3.17.1, &quot;Standard Exception Definitions&quot;, on page 3-52 and Section 3.17.2, &quot;Standard Minor Exception Codes&quot;, on page 3-58).

Within a vendor assigned space, the assignment of values to minor codes is left to the vendor. Vendors may request allocation of VMCIDs by sending email to codice_1. A list of currently assigned VMCIDs can be found on the OMG website at: https://www.omg.org/cgi-bin/doc?vendor-tags

The VMCID 0 and 0xfffff are reserved for experimental use. The VMCID OMGVMCID (Section 3.17.1, &quot;Standard Exception Definitions&quot;, on page 3-52) and 1 through 0xf are reserved for OMG use.

The Common Object Request Broker: Architecture and Specification (CORBA 2.3)

===Corba Location (CorbaLoc)===
Corba Location (CorbaLoc) refers to a stringified object reference for a CORBA object that looks similar to a URL.

All CORBA products must support two OMG-defined URLs: &quot; and &quot;. The purpose of these is to provide a human readable and editable way to specify a location where an IOR can be obtained.

An example of corbaloc is shown below:

A CORBA product may optionally support the &quot;, &quot;, and &quot;&quot; formats. The semantics of these is that they provide details of how to download a stringified IOR (or, recursively, download another URL that will eventually provide a stringified IOR). Some ORBs do deliver additional formats which are proprietary for that ORB.

==Benefits==
CORBA&#x27;s benefits include language- and OS-independence, freedom from technology-linked implementations, strong data-typing, high level of tunability, and freedom from the details of distributed data transfers.

; Language independence:CORBA was designed to free engineers from limitations of coupling their designs to a particular software language. Currently there are many languages supported by various CORBA providers, the most popular being Java and C++. There are also C++11, C-only, Smalltalk, Perl, Ada, Ruby, and Python implementations, just to mention a few.

; OS-independence: CORBA&#x27;s design is meant to be OS-independent. CORBA is available in Java (OS-independent), as well as natively for Linux/Unix, Windows, Solaris, OS X, OpenVMS, HPUX, Android, LynxOS, VxWorks, ThreadX, INTEGRITY, and others.

; Freedom from technologies: One of the main implicit benefits is that CORBA provides a neutral playing field for engineers to be able to normalize the interfaces between various new and legacy systems. When integrating C, C++, Object Pascal, Java, Fortran, Python, and any other language or OS into a single cohesive system design model, CORBA provides the means to level the field and allow disparate teams to develop systems and unit tests that can later be joined into a whole system. This does not rule out the need for basic system engineering decisions, such as threading, timing, object lifetime, etc. These issues are part of any system regardless of technology. CORBA allows system elements to be normalized into a single cohesive system model.&lt;br&gt; For example, the design of a multitier architecture is made simple using Java Servlets in the web server and various CORBA servers containing the business logic and wrapping the database accesses. This allows the implementations of the business logic to change, while the interface changes would need to be handled as in any other technology. For example, a database wrapped by a server can have its database schema change for the sake of improved disk usage or performance (or even whole-scale database vendor change), without affecting the external interfaces. At the same time, C++ legacy code can talk to C/Fortran legacy code and Java database code, and can provide data to a web interface.

; Data-typing: CORBA provides flexible data typing, for example an &quot;ANY&quot; datatype. CORBA also enforces tightly coupled data typing, reducing human errors. In a situation where Name-Value pairs are passed around, it is conceivable that a server provides a number where a string was expected. CORBA Interface Definition Language provides the mechanism to ensure that user-code conforms to method-names, return-, parameter-types, and exceptions.

; High tunability: Many implementations (e.g. ORBexpress (Ada, C++, and Java implementation) and OmniORB (open source C++ and Python implementation)) have options for tuning the threading and connection management features. Not all ORB implementations provide the same features.

; Freedom from data-transfer details: When handling low-level connection and threading, CORBA provides a high level of detail in error conditions. This is defined in the CORBA-defined standard exception set and the implementation-specific extended exception set. Through the exceptions, the application can determine if a call failed for reasons such as &quot;Small problem, so try again&quot;, &quot;The server is dead&quot;, or &quot;The reference does not make sense.&quot; The general rule is: Not receiving an exception means that the method call completed successfully. This is a very powerful design feature.

; Compression: CORBA marshals its data in a binary form and supports compression. IONA, Remedy IT, and Telefónica have worked on an extension to the CORBA standard that delivers compression. This extension is called ZIOP and this is now a formal OMG standard.

==Problems and criticism==
While CORBA delivered much in the way code was written and software constructed, it has been the subject of criticism.

Much of the criticism of CORBA stems from poor implementations of the standard and not deficiencies of the standard itself. Some of the failures of the standard itself were due to the process by which the CORBA specification was created and the compromises inherent in the politics and business of writing a common standard sourced by many competing implementors.

; Initial implementation incompatibilities
: The initial specifications of CORBA defined only the IDL, not the on-the-wire format. This meant that source-code compatibility was the best that was available for several years. With CORBA 2 and later this issue was resolved.

; Location transparency
: CORBA&#x27;s notion of location transparency has been criticized; that is, that objects residing in the same address space and accessible with a simple function call are treated the same as objects residing elsewhere (different processes on the same machine, or different machines). This is a fundamental design flaw, as it makes all object access as complex as the most complex case (i.e., remote network call with a wide class of failures that are not possible in local calls). It also hides the inescapable differences between the two classes, making it impossible for applications to select an appropriate use strategy (that is, a call with 1 μs latency and guaranteed return will be used very differently from a call with 1 s latency with possible transport failure, in which the delivery status is potentially unknown and might take 30 s to time out).
; Design and process deficiencies
: The creation of the CORBA standard is also often cited for its process of design by committee. There was no process to arbitrate between conflicting proposals or to decide on the hierarchy of problems to tackle. Thus the standard was created by taking a union of the features in all proposals with no regard to their coherence. This made the specification complex, expensive to implement entirely, and often ambiguous.

: A design committee composed of a mixture of implementation vendors and customers created a diverse set of interests. This diversity made difficult a cohesive standard. Standards and interoperability increased competition and eased customers&#x27; movement between alternative implementations. This led to much political fighting within the committee and frequent releases of revisions of the CORBA standard that some ORB implementors ensured were difficult to use without proprietary extensions. Less ethical CORBA vendors encouraged customer lock-in and achieved strong short-term results. Over time the ORB vendors that encourage portability took over market share. 

; Problems with implementations
: Through its history, CORBA has been plagued by shortcomings in poor ORB implementations. Unfortunately many of the papers criticizing CORBA as a standard are simply criticisms of a particularly bad CORBA ORB implementation.

: CORBA is a comprehensive standard with many features. Few implementations attempt to implement all of the specifications, and initial implementations were incomplete or inadequate. As there were no requirements to provide a reference implementation, members were free to propose features which were never tested for usefulness or implementability. Implementations were further hindered by the general tendency of the standard to be verbose, and the common practice of compromising by adopting the sum of all submitted proposals, which often created APIs that were incoherent and difficult to use, even if the individual proposals were perfectly reasonable.

: Robust implementations of CORBA have been very difficult to acquire in the past, but are now much easier to find. The SUN Java SDK comes with CORBA built-in. Some poorly designed implementations have been found to be complex, slow, incompatible, and incomplete. Robust commercial versions began to appear but for significant cost. As good quality free implementations became available the bad commercial implementations died quickly.

; Firewalls
: CORBA (more precisely, GIOP) is not tied to any particular communications transport. A specialization of GIOP is the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol or IIOP. IIOP uses raw TCP/IP connections in order to transmit data.

: If the client is behind a very restrictive firewall or transparent proxy server environment that only allows HTTP connections to the outside through port 80, communication may be impossible, unless the proxy server in question allows the HTTP CONNECT method or SOCKS connections as well. At one time, it was difficult even to force implementations to use a single standard port – they tended to pick multiple random ports instead. As of today, current ORBs do have these deficiencies. Due to such difficulties, some users have made increasing use of web services instead of CORBA. These communicate using XML/SOAP via port 80, which is normally left open or filtered through a HTTP proxy inside the organization, for web browsing via HTTP. Recent CORBA implementations, though, support SSL and can be easily configured to work on a single port. Some ORBS, such as TAO, omniORB, and JacORB also support bidirectional GIOP, which gives CORBA the advantage of being able to use callback communication rather than the polling approach characteristic of web service implementations. Also, most modern firewalls support GIOP &amp; IIOP and are thus CORBA-friendly firewalls.
