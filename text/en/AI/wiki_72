<text>Mercedes-Benz Group AG (formerly Daimler-Benz, DaimlerChrysler, and Daimler) is a German multinational automotive company headquartered in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is one of the world&#x27;s leading car manufacturers. Daimler-Benz was formed with the merger of Benz &amp; Cie., the world&#x27;s oldest car company, and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft in 1926. The company was renamed DaimlerChrysler upon the acquisition of the American automobile manufacturer, Chrysler Corporation in 1998, it was renamed to Daimler upon the divestment of Chrysler in 2007. In 2021, Daimler was the second-largest German automaker and the sixth-largest worldwide by production. In February 2022, Daimler was renamed Mercedes-Benz Group as part of a transaction that spun-off its commercial vehicle segment as an independent company, Daimler Truck.

The Mercedes-Benz Group&#x27;s marques are Mercedes-Benz for cars and vans (including Mercedes-AMG and Mercedes-Maybach). It has shares in other vehicle manufacturers such as Daimler Truck, BAIC Motor and Aston Martin. Since 2019, Smart left Daimler AG and became a 50/50 joint venture with Geely.

By unit sales, the Mercedes-Benz Group is the tenth-largest car manufacturer in the world; shipping two million passenger vehicles in 2021 and by revenue the seventh-largest car manufacturer worldwide in 2023. Also in 2023, the company was ranked 42nd in the Forbes Global 2000. The group provides financial services through its Mercedes-Benz Mobility arm. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index. The central company headquarters, the Mercedes-Benz offices, a car assembly plant, the Mercedes-Benz Museum and the Mercedes-Benz Arena are situated in the Mercedes-Benz complex in Stuttgart.

==History==
===1926–1998: Daimler-Benz===
The Mercedes-Benz Group origin is in an &quot;Agreement of Mutual Interest&quot; signed on 1 May 1924 between Benz &amp; Cie. (founded in 1883 by Carl Benz) and Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft (founded in 1890 by Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach). Both companies continued to manufacture their separate automobile and internal combustion engine marques until 28 June 1926, when Benz &amp; Cie. and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft formally merged – becoming Daimler-Benz AG (Aktiengesellschaft) – and agreed that thereafter, all of the factories would use the brand name of &quot;Mercedes-Benz&quot; on their automobiles. The inclusion of the name Mercedes in the new brand name honored the most important model series of DMG automobiles, the Mercedes series, which were designed and built by Wilhelm Maybach. They derived their name from a 1900 engine named after the daughter of Emil Jellinek. Jellinek became one of DMG&#x27;s directors in 1900, ordered a small number of motor racing cars built to his specifications by Maybach, stipulated that the engine must be named &quot;Daimler-Mercedes&quot;, and made the new automobile famous through motorsports. That race car later became known as the &quot;Mercedes 35 hp&quot;. The first of the series of production models bearing the name Mercedes had been produced by DMG in 1902. Jellinek left the DMG board of directors in 1909.

The name of Daimler as a marque of automobiles had been given by Gottlieb Daimler for use by other companies. It is or was used principally by Daimler Motor Company and Austro-Daimler later Steyr-Daimler-Puch but also, very briefly by Daimler Manufacturing Company and Panhard-Daimler, and others. The new company, Daimler-Benz, did not obtain consent to include Daimler in its brand name and used the name Mercedes to represent the Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft interest. Karl Benz remained as a member of the board of directors of Daimler-Benz AG until his death in 1929.

Although Daimler-Benz is best known for its Mercedes-Benz automobile brand, during World War II, it also created a notable series of engines for German aircraft, tanks, and submarines. Its cars became the first choice of many Nazi, Fascist Italian, and Japanese officials including Hermann Göring, Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini and Hirohito, who most notably used the Mercedes-Benz 770 luxury car. Daimler also produced parts for German arms, most notably barrels for Mauser Kar98k rifles. During World War II, Daimler-Benz had over 60,000 concentration camp prisoners and other forced laborers to build machinery. After the war, Daimler admitted to its links and coordination with the Nazi government.
In 1966, Maybach-Motorenbau GmbH merged with Mercedes-Benz Motorenbau Friedrichshafen GmbH to form Maybach Mercedes-Benz Motorenbau GmbH, under partial ownership by Daimler-Benz. The company is renamed Motoren und Turbinen-Union Friedrichshafen GmbH (MTU Friedrichshafen) in 1969.

In 1989, Daimler-Benz InterServices AG (Debis) was created to handle data processing, financial and insurance services, and real estate management for the Daimler group.

In 1995, MTU Friedrichshafen became a wholly owned subsidiary of Daimler-Benz.

===1998–2007: DaimlerChrysler===

In a so-called &quot;merger of equals,&quot; or &quot;marriage made in heaven,&quot; according to its then CEO and architect Jürgen E. Schrempp, Daimler-Benz, and United States–based automobile manufacturer Chrysler Corporation, the smallest of the main three American automakers, merged in 1998 in an exchange of shares and formed DaimlerChrysler AG. Valued at 38 billion, it was the world&#x27;s largest ever cross-border deal.

The terms of the merger allowed Daimler-Benz&#x27;s non-automotive businesses such as Daimler-Benz InterServices AG, &quot;debis AG&quot; for short, to continue to pursue their respective strategies of expansion. &quot;debis AG&quot; reported revenues of $8.6 bn (DM 15.5 bn) in 1997.

The merger was contentious with investors launching lawsuits over whether the transaction was the &#x27;merger of equals&#x27; that senior management claimed or actually amounted to a Daimler-Benz takeover of Chrysler. A class action investor lawsuit was settled in August 2003 for US$300 million while a suit by billionaire investor activist Kirk Kerkorian was dismissed on 7 April 2005. The transaction claimed the job of its architect, Chairman Jürgen E. Schrempp, who resigned at the end of 2005 in response to the fall of the company&#x27;s share price following the transaction.

Another issue of contention is whether the merger delivered promised synergies and successfully integrated the two businesses. Martin H. Wiggers&#x27; concept of a platform strategy, like the VW Group&#x27;s, was implemented only for a few models, so the synergy effects in development and production were low. As late as 2002, DaimlerChrysler appeared to run two independent product lines. Later that year, the company launched products that did integrate elements from both sides of the company, including the Chrysler Crossfire, which was based on the Mercedes SLK platform and utilized Mercedes&#x27;s 3.2 L V6, and the Dodge Sprinter/Freightliner Sprinter, a re-badged Mercedes-Benz Sprinter van.

In 2000, DaimlerChrysler acquired the Detroit Diesel Corporation and placed its on-highway division under Daimler Trucks North America. The off-highway division was placed under MTU Friedrichshafen to form MTU America. Detroit Diesel branding has been maintained by DTNA and MTU America. In 2005, MTU-Friedrichshafen was sold to the Swedish investment firm EQT Partners. That same year, DaimlerChrysler entered into an alliance with Mitsubishi Motors Corporation in an effort to reach the Asian market. The alliance resulted in the platform sharing between the 2002-2013 Colt and first-generation Smart Forfour, but the declining performance of Mitsubishi led DaimlerChrysler to sell its shares back by 2004.

In 2006, Chrysler reported losses of US$1.5 billion. It then announced plans to lay off 13,000 employees in mid-February 2007, close a major assembly plant and reduce production at other plants in order to restore profitability by 2008. That same year, Chrysler was overtaken by Toyota in the US market, leaving it outside of the traditional &quot;Big Three&quot; of US automakers for the first time.

DaimlerChrysler had reportedly approached other carmakers and investment groups to sell Chrysler in early 2007. General Motors was reported to be a suitor, but Daimler agreed to sell the Chrysler unit to Cerberus Capital Management in May 2007 for US$6 billion and completed the sale on 3 August 2007. The original agreement stated that Cerberus would take an 80.1 percent stake in the new company, Chrysler Holding LLC. DaimlerChrysler changed its name to Daimler AG and retained the remaining 19.9% stake in the separated Chrysler LLC.

The terms saw Daimler pay Cerberus US$650 million to take Chrysler and associated liabilities off its hands. Of the US$7.4 billion purchase price, Cerberus Capital Management was to invest US$5 billion in Chrysler Holdings and US$1.05 billion in Chrysler&#x27;s financial unit. The de-merged Daimler AG received US$1.35 billion directly from Cerberus but directly invested US$2 billion in Chrysler itself. Chrysler filed bankruptcy in 2009.

DC Aviation rose in 2007 from the previous DaimlerChrysler Aviation, an auxiliary of DaimlerChrysler AG, which was established in 1998.

===2007–2022: Daimler AG===

In May 2010, the &quot;Shenzhen BYD Daimler New Technology Co., Ltd.&quot;, trading as &quot;Denza&quot; was established between BYD and Daimler to produce luxury electric vehicles.

In November 2014, Daimler announced it would acquire 25 percent of Italian motorcycle producer MV Agusta for an undisclosed fee. MV Holding acquired the 25 percent of MV Agusta back from Daimler in December 2017.

On 3 August 2015, Nokia announced that it had reached a deal to sell its Here digital maps division to a consortium of three German automakers—BMW, Daimler AG, and Volkswagen Group, for €2.8 billion. This was seen as an indication that the automakers were interested in automated cars.

In 2017, Daimler announced a series of acquisitions and partnerships with car startups focused on car sharing, in a move towards what it sees as the next generation of car ownership and usage. Part of its corporate strategy is to &quot;transition from being an automobile manufacturer to a mobility services provider&quot;.

In April 2017 it announced a partnership with Via, a New York–based ride-sharing app, to launch a new ride-sharing service across Europe. In September, it was announced that Daimler had led a fundraising round for car-sharing start up Turo, which is a platform that lets owners rent their vehicles out to other users. It also acquired Flinc, a German startup that has built an app for peer-to-peer-style carpooling, has invested in Storedot, Careem, Blacklane, and FlixBus. It has also acquired car2go and mytaxi (now Free Now).

Li Shufu of Chinese automobile manufacturer Geely took a 9.69% stake in the company, through Tenaciou3 Prospect Investment Limited, in February 2018, making it the company&#x27;s largest single shareholder. Geely is already known from its ownership of Volvo Car Corporation. In September 2018, Daimler invested $155 million in US-based electric bus and its battery management technology manufacturer Proterra.

In July 2019, BAIC Group purchased a 5% stake in Daimler, which is a reciprocal shareholder in BAIC&#x27;s Hong Kong listed subsidiary.

In September 2019, Daimler announced that it would be &quot;stopping its internal combustion engine development initiatives as part of its efforts to embrace electric vehicles.&quot;

In February 2020, Daimler partnered with Twelve to create the world&#x27;s first C-pillar made with polycarbonate from CO2 electrolysis in an effort towards a fully carbon neutral fleet.

In September 2020, the company was fined 875 million dollars by the United States for having violated the Clean Air Act. It agreed to pay $1.5 billion to settle all related court actions.

In February 2021, Daimler said it planned to rename itself adopting the name of its flagship marque, Mercedes-Benz, and spun off its heavy commercial vehicles unit, Daimler Truck, into a separate listed company. Daimler Truck is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and its first trading day was on 10 December 2021.

In the 2021 review of WIPO&#x27;s annual World Intellectual Property Indicators Daimler ranked 8th in the world, with 65 of its designs in industrial design registrations being published under the Hague System during 2020. This position is up on its previous 10th-place ranking in 2019.

===Since 2022: Mercedes-Benz Group===
On 28 January 2022, CEO Ola Källenius announced that Daimler will be rebranded as Mercedes-Benz to pursue a higher valuation for the company as it shifts deeper into high-tech electric vehicles. On 1 February 2022, Daimler officially changed its registered company name to Mercedes-Benz Group AG.

Sales of Mercedes-Benz Group vehicles in 2023 – 2,491,600 (+1.5%). Sales of superior products increased: Mercedes-Maybach (+19%), G-Class (+11%) and Mercedes-AMG (+4%). Fully electric Mercedes-Benz passenger car sales rose by 73% during the year. Only Core segment sales declined by 2%, with 1,096,800 units sold due to supplier bottlenecks and the transition to the new E-Class.

=== Joint ventures and alliances ===
====FAW and later Beijing Automotive Group====
From 1986 to 1989, Daimler produced the Mercedes-Benz W123 (200 and 230E) sedans in China under a joint venture with FAW Group, with 828 units assembled in Changchun.

Beijing Jeep was a joint venture between Chrysler and BAIC Motor. After DaimlerChrysler was formed, its legal name was changed to Beijing Benz in 2004, and it started producing Mercedes-Benz models in 2006. The partnership has continued during the Daimler AG era.

In February 2013, Daimler acquired a 12% stake in BAIC Motor, becoming the first western car manufacturer to own a stake in a Chinese company.

Daimler works with China&#x27;s Beiqi Foton (a subsidiary of BAIC) to build Auman trucks.

====Force Motors====
Daimler has partnered with Force Motors since the 1950s, they let Force Motors use the OM616 on the Force Gurkha and Trax.

====Fujian Benz====
In 2007 Daimler created a joint venture with Fujian Motors Group and China Motor Corporation and created Fujian Benz (originally Fujian Daimler Automotive Co.).

====SsangYong Motors====
Between 1990 and 2010 SsangYong partnered with Daimler-Benz. The deal was for SsangYong to develop an SUV with Mercedes-Benz technology. This was supposedly to allow SsangYong to gain footholds in new markets without having to build their own infrastructure (utilizing existing Mercedes-Benz networks) while giving Mercedes a competitor in the then-booming SUV market. This resulted in the Musso, which was sold first by Mercedes-Benz and later by SsangYong. SsangYong further benefited from this alliance, long after Daimler-Benz stopped selling the Musso, producing a badge engineered version of the Mercedes-Benz MB100, the Istana and using Daimler designs in many other models, including the second-generation Korando (engine and transmission), the Rexton (transmission), the Chairman H (chassis and transmission) and the Kyron (transmission). Ssangyong Also Partnered with Daewoo Motors to sell the chairman, Korando, Istana, and Musso to the rest of South Korea and Asia, Ssangyong later partnered with SAIC (Roewe) to rebadge the Chairman W in china as the Roewe R95/850 and the Kyron as Roewe W5 and also use the Mercedes-Benz 5G-Tronic transmission for the W5, SAIC has been working with Daimler since the 1964 with the Shanghai SH760 using a modified W121 chassis. Micro another company that rebadged Ssangyong&#x27;s like Kyron, Actyon and Rexton using Mercedes-Benz engines.

====Renault-Nissan-Mitsubishi and Daimler Alliance====
On 7 April 2010, Renault-Nissan executives, Carlos Ghosn and Dieter Zetsche, announced an intercourse between the three companies. The first fruits of the alliance in 2012 included engine sharing (Infiniti Q50 utilising Mercedes diesel engines) and a re-badged Renault Kangoo being sold as a Mercedes-Benz Citan.

== Alternative propulsion ==
===Electric===

Daimler AG and the utility company RWE AG were set in 2009 to begin a joint electric car and charging station test project in the German capital, Berlin, called &quot;E-Mobility Berlin.&quot; 

Following trials in 2007 and then with Tesla in 2009, Daimler is building a production Smart electric drive car using Tesla&#x27;s battery technology. Daimler temporarily invested in Tesla, saving it from bankruptcy.
Daimler&#x27;s joint venture with BYD has resulted in the creation of the new brand Denza.

In 2016, Daimler subsidiary ACCUMOTIVE announced their stationary batteries, to store up to 20 kWh of solar power for later use. Daimler plans to invest €1.5 billion in battery technology, and unveiled a factory in Kamenz in May 2017.

In September 2019, Daimler redirected its internal combustion engine development initiatives to focus on electric vehicle technologies, leaving electric propulsion rather less of an &quot;alternative&quot; and more the Daimler mainline. Their Research and Development department has developed a compostable battery that uses graphene-based organic cell chemistry. This means that no rare, toxic metals are needed for the battery, which makes it 100% recyclable.

Since 2019, fully electric cars have been released through the Mercedes-EQ brand.

===Fuel cell===
Daimler has been involved with fuel cell vehicle development for some time, with a number of research and concept vehicles shown and demonstrated, the first being the 2002 Mercedes-Benz F-Cell car and the Mercedes-Benz Citaro hydrogen bus.

===Hybrid===
Mercedes-Benz launched its first passenger car model equipped with a hybrid drive system in summer 2009, the Mercedes-Benz S-Class 400 Hybrid. and the Citaro Hybrid bus in 2007. Daimler Trucks and Mitusbishi Fuso have also trialed various hybrid models including the Mitsubishi Fuso Canter Eco Hybrid and Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star Aero Star Eco Hybrid bus.

===Biofuel research===
Daimler AG is involved in a joint project with Archer Daniels Midland Company and Bayer CropScience to develop the semi-evergreen shrub jatropha curcas as a biofuel.

== Formula One ==

On 16 November 2009, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased a 75.1% stake in Brawn GP (Daimler holding 45.1%). The company was rebranded as Mercedes GP with its base in Brackley, UK and Ross Brawn remaining team principal. The Brawn purchase led to Daimler selling back its stake in McLaren in stages, completed in 2011. Mercedes continued to provide sponsorship and engines to McLaren until 2014.

Prior to the 2011 season, Daimler and Aabar Investments purchased the remaining 24.9% stake owned by the team management in February 2011. In November 2012, Aabar Investments sold its remaining shares, leaving the team (rebranded as Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team) wholly Daimler-owned.

Daimler also owns Mercedes AMG High Performance Powertrains which, as of 2024, supplied engines to Aston Martin, Williams, and McLaren, in addition to Mercedes AMG Petronas.

==O-Bahn==

The O-Bahn system was conceived by Daimler-Benz to enable buses to avoid traffic congestion by sharing tram tunnels in the German city of Essen. However, the project did not materialise there; the project was built in the Australian city of Adelaide.

==Bribery and corruption==
On 1 April 2010, Daimler AG&#x27;s German and Russian subsidiaries each pleaded guilty to two counts of bribery charges brought by the U.S. Justice Department and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The parent company made a US$185 million settlement, but the company and its Chinese subsidiary remained subject to a two-year deferred prosecution agreement requiring further cooperation with regulators, adherence to internal controls and meeting other terms before final sentencing. Daimler would face harsher penalties should it fail to meet the terms of the agreement during the two-year period.

Additionally, Louis J. Freeh, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, served as an independent monitor to oversee Daimler&#x27;s compliance with anti-bribery laws.

U.S. prosecutors accused key executives of Daimler, Daimler subsidiaries, and Daimler affiliates of illegally showering foreign officials with money and gifts between 1998 and 2008 to secure government contracts around the world. The investigation for the case revealed that Daimler improperly paid some $56 million in bribes related to more than 200 transactions in at least 22 countries (including China, Russia, Turkey, Hungary, Greece, Latvia, Serbia and Montenegro, Egypt, and Nigeria, among other places) that, in return, awarded the company $1.9 billion in revenue and at least $91.4 million in illegal profits.

The SEC case was sparked in 2004 after David Bazzetta, a former auditor at then DaimlerChrysler Corp, filed a whistleblower complaint after he was fired for raising questions about bank accounts controlled by Mercedes-Benz units in South America. Bazzetta alleged that he learned in a July 2001 corporate audit executive committee meeting in Stuttgart that business units &quot;continued to maintain secret bank accounts to bribe foreign government officials&quot;, though the company knew the practice violated U.S. laws.

In another attempt to silence Bazzetta, Daimler later offered to settle his termination of employment suit out of court and he eventually accepted a settlement. But Daimler&#x27;s strategy with Bazzetta proved to be a failure as the U.S. criminal investigation for violating anti-bribery laws was already underway in what has been one of the most wide-ranging cases brought against a foreign corporation.

According to the charges, the bribes were frequently made by over-invoicing customers and paying the excess back to top government officials or their proxies. The bribes also took the form of luxury European vacations, armored Mercedes vehicles for high-ranking government officials and a birthday gift to the dictator of Turkmenistan, Turkmenbashi (Saparmurat Niyazov), including a golden box and 10,000 copies of his personal manifesto, &quot;Ruhnama&quot;, translated into German.

Investigators also found that the firm violated the terms of the United Nations&#x27; Oil-for-Food Programme with Iraq by giving kickbacks worth 10% of the contract values to officials within the Iraqi government, then led by Saddam Hussein. The SEC said the company made more than $4 million in profit from the sale of vehicles and spare parts in the corrupt oil-for-food deals.

U.S. prosecutors further alleged that some bribes were paid through shell companies based in the U.S. &quot;In some cases Daimler wired these improper payments to U.S. bank accounts or to the foreign bank accounts of U.S. shell companies in order to transmit the bribe&quot;, the court papers said.

Prosecutors said that Daimler engaged in a &quot;long-standing practice&quot; of paying bribes, due in part to a corporate culture that encouraged the practice.

&quot;Using offshore bank accounts, third-party agents and deceptive pricing practices, [Daimler AG, its subsidiaries and its affiliates] saw foreign bribery as a way of doing business,&quot; said Mythili Raman, a principal deputy in the Justice Department&#x27;s criminal division.

&quot;It is no exaggeration to describe corruption and bribe-paying at Daimler as a standard business practice&quot;, Robert Khuzami, director of the SEC&#x27;s enforcement division, said in a statement.

As per the agreement with prosecutors, the two Daimler subsidiaries admitted to knowingly violating the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars companies and their officials from paying bribes to foreign officials to win business. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act applies to any company that lists its shares on U.S. stock exchanges. Daimler AG was listed with the symbol &quot;DAI&quot; on the New York Stock Exchange, giving the Justice Department jurisdiction over the German car maker&#x27;s payments in countries around the globe. Judge Richard J. Leon of the United States District Court in Washington, D.C., approved the plea agreement and settlement, calling it a &quot;just resolution.&quot; Daimler AG agreed to settle for $2.2 billion to US and California state regulators.

== Labor relations ==

=== United States ===
In March 2024, workers at the Mercedes-Benz plant in Tuscaloosa County, Alabama filed charges against the company with the US National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), accusing the company of illegally disciplining workers at the plant in retaliation for organizing with the United Auto Workers (UAW) labor union. In May 2024, following the loss of a unionization vote at the plant, the UAW filed a formal complaint with the NLRB seeking a new election due to what it called &quot;wanton lawlessness&quot; on the part of Mercedes-Benz in the run up to the election, with the UAW accusing the company of holding anti-union captive audience meetings, targeting pro-union workers for drug tests, and illegally terminating UAW supporters.

<doc id="42978" wikidata="Q45765" url="?curid=42978" title="Jack London">
<text>John Griffith Chaney (January 12, 1876 – November 22, 1916), better known as Jack London, was an American novelist, journalist and activist. A pioneer of commercial fiction and American magazines, he was one of the first American authors to become an international celebrity and earn a large fortune from writing. He was also an innovator in the genre that would later become known as science fiction.

London was part of the radical literary group &quot;The Crowd&quot; in San Francisco and a passionate advocate of animal welfare, workers&#x27; rights and socialism. London wrote several works dealing with these topics, such as his dystopian novel &quot;The Iron Heel&quot;, his non-fiction exposé &quot;The People of the Abyss&quot;, &quot;War of the Classes&quot;, and &quot;Before Adam&quot;.

His most famous works include &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; and &quot;White Fang&quot;, both set in Alaska and the Yukon during the Klondike Gold Rush, as well as the short stories &quot;To Build a Fire&quot;, &quot;An Odyssey of the North&quot;, and &quot;Love of Life&quot;. He also wrote about the South Pacific in stories such as &quot;The Pearls of Parlay&quot; and &quot;The Heathen&quot;.

== Family ==
Jack London was born January 12, 1876. His mother, Flora Wellman, was the fifth and youngest child of Pennsylvania Canal builder Marshall Wellman and his first wife, Eleanor Garrett Jones. Marshall Wellman was descended from Thomas Wellman, an early Puritan settler in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Flora left Ohio and moved to the Pacific coast when her father remarried after her mother died. In San Francisco, Flora worked as a music teacher and spiritualist.

Biographer Clarice Stasz and others believe London&#x27;s father was astrologer William Chaney. Flora Wellman was living with Chaney in San Francisco when she became pregnant. Whether Wellman and Chaney were legally married is unknown. Stasz notes that in his memoirs, Chaney refers to London&#x27;s mother Flora Wellman as having been &quot;his wife&quot;; he also cites an advertisement in which Flora called herself &quot;Florence Wellman Chaney&quot;.

According to Flora Wellman&#x27;s account, as recorded in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; of June 4, 1875, Chaney demanded that she have an abortion. When she refused, he disclaimed responsibility for the child. In desperation, she shot herself. She was not seriously wounded, but she was temporarily deranged. After giving birth, Flora sent the baby for wet-nursing to Virginia (Jennie) Prentiss, a neighbor and former slave. Prentiss was an important maternal figure throughout London&#x27;s life, and he would later refer to her as his primary source of love and affection as a child.

Late in 1876, Flora Wellman married John London, a partially disabled Civil War veteran, and brought her baby John, later known as Jack, to live with the newly married couple. The family moved around the San Francisco Bay Area before settling in Oakland, where London completed public grade school. The Prentiss family moved with the Londons, and remained a stable source of care for the young Jack.

In 1897, when he was 21 and a student at the University of California, Berkeley, London searched for and read the newspaper accounts of his mother&#x27;s suicide attempt and the name of his biological father. He wrote to William Chaney, then living in Chicago. Chaney responded that he could not be London&#x27;s father because he was impotent; he casually asserted that London&#x27;s mother had relations with other men and averred that she had slandered him when she said he insisted on an abortion. London was devastated by his father&#x27;s letter; in the months following, he quit school at Berkeley and went to the Klondike during the gold rush boom.

== Early life ==
London was born near Third and Brannan Streets in San Francisco. The house burned down in the fire after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake; the California Historical Society placed a plaque at the site in 1953. Although the family was working class, it was not as impoverished as London&#x27;s later accounts claimed. London was largely self-educated.
In 1885, London found and read Ouida&#x27;s long Victorian novel &quot;Signa&quot;. He credited this as the seed of his literary success. In 1886, he went to the Oakland Public Library and found a sympathetic librarian, Ina Coolbrith, who encouraged his learning. (She later became California&#x27;s first &quot;poet laureate&quot; and an important figure in the San Francisco literary community).

In 1889, London began working 12 to 18 hours a day at Hickmott&#x27;s Cannery. Seeking a way out, he borrowed money from his foster mother Virginia Prentiss, bought the sloop &quot;Razzle-Dazzle&quot; from an oyster pirate named French Frank, and became an oyster pirate himself. In his memoir, &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, he claims also to have stolen French Frank&#x27;s mistress Mamie. After a few months, his sloop became damaged beyond repair. London hired on as a member of the California Fish Patrol.

In 1893, he signed on to the sealing schooner &quot;Sophie Sutherland&quot;, bound for the coast of Japan. When he returned, the country was in the grip of the panic of &#x27;93 and Oakland was swept by labor unrest. After grueling jobs in a jute mill and a street-railway power plant, London joined Coxey&#x27;s Army and began his career as a tramp. In 1894, he spent 30 days for vagrancy in the Erie County Penitentiary at Buffalo, New York. In &quot;The Road&quot;, he wrote:

After many experiences as a hobo and a sailor, he returned to Oakland and attended Oakland High School. He contributed a number of articles to the high school&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Aegis&quot;. His first published work was &quot;Typhoon off the Coast of Japan&quot;, an account of his sailing experiences.
As a schoolboy, London often studied at Heinold&#x27;s First and Last Chance Saloon, a port-side bar in Oakland. At 17, he confessed to the bar&#x27;s owner, John Heinold, his desire to attend university and pursue a career as a writer. Heinold lent London tuition money to attend college.

London desperately wanted to attend the University of California, located in Berkeley. In 1896, after a summer of intense studying to pass certification exams, he was admitted. Financial circumstances forced him to leave in 1897, and he never graduated. No evidence has surfaced that he ever wrote for student publications while studying at Berkeley.

While at Berkeley, London continued to study and spend time at Heinold&#x27;s saloon, where he was introduced to the sailors and adventurers who would influence his writing. In his autobiographical novel, &quot;John Barleycorn,&quot; London mentioned the pub&#x27;s likeness seventeen times. Heinold&#x27;s was the place where London met Alexander McLean, a captain known for his cruelty at sea. London based his protagonist Wolf Larsen, in the novel &quot;The Sea-Wolf,&quot; on McLean.

Heinold&#x27;s First and Last Chance Saloon is now unofficially named Jack London&#x27;s Rendezvous in his honor.

== Gold rush and first success ==
On July 12, 1897, London (age 21) and his sister&#x27;s husband Captain Shepard sailed to join the Klondike Gold Rush. This was the setting for some of his first successful stories. London&#x27;s time in the harsh Klondike, however, was detrimental to his health. Like so many other men who were malnourished in the goldfields, London developed scurvy. His gums became swollen, leading to the loss of his four front teeth. A constant gnawing pain affected his hip and leg muscles, and his face was stricken with marks that always reminded him of the struggles he faced in the Klondike. Father William Judge, &quot;The Saint of Dawson&quot;, had a facility in Dawson that provided shelter, food and any available medicine to London and others. His struggles there inspired London&#x27;s short story, &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; (1902, revised in 1908), which many critics assess as his best.

His landlords in Dawson were mining engineers Marshall Latham Bond and Louis Whitford Bond, educated at the Bachelor&#x27;s level at the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale and at the Master&#x27;s level at Stanford, respectively. The brothers&#x27; father, Judge Hiram Bond, was a wealthy mining investor. While the Bond brothers were at Stanford, Hiram at the suggestion of his brother bought the New Park Estate at Santa Clara as well as a local bank. The Bonds, especially Hiram, were active Republicans. Marshall Bond&#x27;s diary mentions friendly sparring with London on political issues as a camp pastime.

London left Oakland with a social conscience and socialist leanings; he returned to become an activist for socialism. He concluded that his only hope of escaping the work &quot;trap&quot; was to get an education and &quot;sell his brains&quot;. He saw his writing as a business, his ticket out of poverty and, he hoped, as a means of beating the wealthy at their own game.

On returning to California in 1898, London began working to get published, a struggle described in his novel &quot;Martin Eden&quot; (serialized in 1908, published in 1909). His first published story since high school was &quot;To the Man On Trail&quot;, which has frequently been collected in anthologies. When &quot;The Overland Monthly&quot; offered him only five dollars for it—and was slow paying—London came close to abandoning his writing career. In his words, &quot;literally and literarily I was saved&quot; when &quot;The Black Cat&quot; accepted his story &quot;A Thousand Deaths&quot; and paid him $40—the &quot;first money I ever received for a story&quot;.

London began his writing career just as new printing technologies enabled lower-cost production of magazines. This resulted in a boom in popular magazines aimed at a wide public audience and a strong market for short fiction. In 1900, he made $2,500 in writing, about $ in today&#x27;s currency.
Among the works he sold to magazines was a short story known as either &quot;Diable&quot; (1902) or &quot;Bâtard&quot; (1904), two editions of the same basic story. London received $141.25 for this story on May 27, 1902. In the text, a cruel French Canadian brutalizes his dog, and the dog retaliates and kills the man. London told some of his critics that man&#x27;s actions are the main cause of the behavior of their animals, and he would show this famously in another story, &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;.

In early 1903, London sold &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; for $750 and the book rights to Macmillan. Macmillan&#x27;s promotional campaign propelled it to swift success.

While living at his rented villa on Lake Merritt in Oakland, California, London met poet George Sterling; in time they became best friends. In 1902, Sterling helped London find a home closer to his own in nearby Piedmont. In his letters London addressed Sterling as &quot;Greek&quot;, owing to Sterling&#x27;s aquiline nose and classical profile, and he signed them as &quot;Wolf&quot;. London was later to depict Sterling as Russ Brissenden in his autobiographical novel &quot;Martin Eden&quot; (1910) and as Mark Hall in &quot;The Valley of the Moon&quot; (1913).

In later life London indulged his wide-ranging interests by accumulating a personal library of 15,000 volumes. He referred to his books as &quot;the tools of my trade&quot;.

== &quot;The Crowd&quot; (literary group) ==
&quot;The Crowd&quot; gathered at the restaurants (including Coppa&#x27;s&lt;ref name=&quot;sfchronicle/10609139&quot;&gt;
* 
* &lt;/ref&gt;) at the old Montgomery Block&lt;ref name=&quot;Boylan/Revolutionary-Lives-Ch1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and later was a:
Bohemian group that often spent its Sunday afternoons picnicking, reading each other&#x27;s latest compositions, gossiping about each other&#x27;s infidelities and frolicking beneath the cherry boughs in the hills of Piedmont

– Alex Kershaw, historian&lt;ref name=&quot;paintingpiedmont/crowd&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Formed after 1898, they met at Xavier Martinez&#x27;s home on Sundays, and at Jack London&#x27;s home on Wednesdays. The group usually included George Sterling (poet) and his wife Caroline &quot;Carrie&quot; E. (née Rand) Sterling, Anna Strunsky, Herman Whitaker, Ambrose Bierce, Richard Partington and his wife Blanche, Joseph Noel (dramatist, novelist and journalist),&lt;ref name=&quot;archives.nypl/21404&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes/1946/08/08/joseph-noel-65&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Joaquin Miller, Arnold Genthe and the hosts, Jack London and his wife, Bessie Maddern London, and Xavier Martinez and his wife, Elsie Whitaker Martinez.

== First marriage (1900–1904) ==

London married Elizabeth Mae (or May) &quot;Bessie&quot; Maddern on April 7, 1900, the same day &quot;The Son of the Wolf&quot; was published. Bess had been part of his circle of friends for a number of years. She was related to stage actresses Minnie Maddern Fiske and Emily Stevens. Stasz says, &quot;Both acknowledged publicly that they were not marrying out of love, but from friendship and a belief that they would produce sturdy children.&quot; Kingman says, &quot;they were comfortable together... Jack had made it clear to Bessie that he did not love her, but that he liked her enough to make a successful marriage.&quot;

London met Bessie through his friend at Oakland High School, Fred Jacobs; she was Fred&#x27;s fiancée. Bessie, who tutored at Anderson&#x27;s University Academy in Alameda California, tutored Jack in preparation for his entrance exams for the University of California at Berkeley in 1896. Jacobs was killed aboard the &quot;Scandia&quot; in 1897, but Jack and Bessie continued their friendship, which included taking photos and developing the film together. This was the beginning of Jack&#x27;s passion for photography.

During the marriage, London continued his friendship with Anna Strunsky, co-authoring &quot;The Kempton-Wace Letters&quot;, an epistolary novel contrasting two philosophies of love. Anna, writing &quot;Dane Kempton&#x27;s&quot; letters, arguing for a romantic view of marriage, while London, writing &quot;Herbert Wace&#x27;s&quot; letters, argued for a scientific view, based on Darwinism and eugenics. In the novel, his fictional character contrasted two women he had known.

London&#x27;s pet name for Bess was &quot;Mother-Girl&quot; and Bess&#x27;s for London was &quot;Daddy-Boy&quot;. Their first child, Joan, was born on January 15, 1901, and their second, Bessie &quot;Becky&quot; (also reported as Bess), on October 20, 1902. Both children were born in Piedmont, California. Here London wrote one of his most celebrated works, &quot;The Call of the Wild.&quot;

While London had pride in his children, the marriage was strained. Kingman says that by 1903 the couple were close to separation as they were &quot;extremely incompatible&quot;. &quot;Jack was still so kind and gentle with Bessie that when Cloudsley Johns was a house guest in February 1903 he didn&#x27;t suspect a breakup of their marriage.&quot;

London reportedly complained to friends Joseph Noel and George Sterling:

Stasz writes that these were &quot;code words for [Bess&#x27;s] fear that [Jack] was consorting with prostitutes and might bring home venereal disease.&quot;

On July 24, 1903, London told Bessie he was leaving and moved out. During 1904, London and Bess negotiated the terms of a divorce, and the decree was granted on November 11, 1904.

== War correspondent (1904) ==

London accepted an assignment of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; to cover the Russo-Japanese War in early 1904, arriving in Yokohama on January 25, 1904. He was arrested by Japanese authorities in Shimonoseki, but released through the intervention of American ambassador Lloyd Griscom. After travelling to Korea, he was again arrested by Japanese authorities for straying too close to the border with Manchuria without official permission, and was sent back to Seoul. Released again, London was permitted to travel with the Imperial Japanese Army to the border, and to observe the Battle of the Yalu.

London asked William Randolph Hearst, the owner of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, to be allowed to transfer to the Imperial Russian Army, where he felt that restrictions on his reporting and his movements would be less severe. However, before this could be arranged, he was arrested for a third time in four months, this time for assaulting his Japanese assistants, whom he accused of stealing the fodder for his horse. Released through the personal intervention of President Theodore Roosevelt, London departed the front in June 1904.

== Bohemian Club ==
On August 18, 1904, London went with his close friend, the poet George Sterling, to &quot;Summer High Jinks&quot; at the Bohemian Grove. London was elected to honorary membership in the Bohemian Club and took part in many activities. Other noted members of the Bohemian Club during this time included Ambrose Bierce, Gelett Burgess, Allan Dunn, John Muir, Frank Norris, and Herman George Scheffauer.

Beginning in December 1914, London worked on &quot;The Acorn Planter, A California Forest Play&quot;, to be performed as one of the annual Grove Plays, but it was never selected. It was described as too difficult to set to music. London published &quot;The Acorn Planter&quot; in 1916.

== Second marriage ==
After divorcing Maddern, London married Charmian Kittredge in 1905. London had been introduced to Kittredge in 1900 by her aunt Netta Eames, who was an editor at &quot;Overland Monthly&quot; magazine in San Francisco. The two met prior to his first marriage but became lovers years later after Jack and Bessie London visited Wake Robin, Netta Eames&#x27; Sonoma County resort, in 1903. London was injured when he fell from a buggy, and Netta arranged for Charmian to care for him. The two developed a friendship, as Charmian, Netta, her husband Roscoe, and London were politically aligned with socialist causes. At some point the relationship became romantic, and Jack divorced his wife to marry Charmian, who was five years his senior.

Biographer Russ Kingman called Charmian &quot;Jack&#x27;s soul-mate, always at his side, and a perfect match.&quot; Their time together included numerous trips, including a 1907 cruise on the yacht &quot;Snark&quot; to Hawaii and Australia. Many of London&#x27;s stories are based on his visits to Hawaii, the last one for 10 months beginning in December 1915.

The couple also visited Goldfield, Nevada, in 1907, where they were guests of the Bond brothers, London&#x27;s Dawson City landlords. The Bond brothers were working in Nevada as mining engineers.

London had contrasted the concepts of the &quot;Mother Girl&quot; and the &quot;Mate Woman&quot; in &quot;The Kempton-Wace Letters&quot;. His pet name for Bess had been &quot;Mother-Girl&quot;; his pet name for Charmian was &quot;Mate-Woman&quot;. Charmian&#x27;s aunt and foster mother, a disciple of Victoria Woodhull, had raised her without prudishness. Every biographer alludes to Charmian&#x27;s uninhibited sexuality.

Joseph Noel calls the events from 1903 to 1905 &quot;a domestic drama that would have intrigued the pen of an Ibsen... London&#x27;s had comedy relief in it and a sort of easy-going romance.&quot; In broad outline, London was restless in his first marriage, sought extramarital sexual affairs, and found, in Charmian Kittredge, not only a sexually active and adventurous partner, but his future life-companion. They attempted to have children; one child died at birth, and another pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.

In 1906, London published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine his eye-witness report of the San Francisco earthquake.

== Beauty Ranch (1905–1916) ==
In 1905, London purchased a ranch in Glen Ellen, Sonoma County, California, on the eastern slope of Sonoma Mountain. He wrote: &quot;Next to my wife, the ranch is the dearest thing in the world to me.&quot; He desperately wanted the ranch to become a successful business enterprise. Writing, always a commercial enterprise with London, now became even more a means to an end: &quot;I write for no other purpose than to add to the beauty that now belongs to me. I write a book for no other reason than to add three or four hundred acres to my magnificent estate.&quot;

Stasz writes that London &quot;had taken fully to heart the vision, expressed in his agrarian fiction, of the land as the closest earthly version of Eden ... he educated himself through the study of agricultural manuals and scientific tomes. He conceived of a system of ranching that today would be praised for its ecological wisdom.&quot; He was proud to own the first concrete silo in California. He hoped to adapt the wisdom of Asian sustainable agriculture to the United States. He hired both Italian and Chinese stonemasons, whose distinctly different styles are obvious.

The ranch was an economic failure. Sympathetic observers such as Stasz treat his projects as potentially feasible, and ascribe their failure to bad luck or to being ahead of their time. Unsympathetic historians such as Kevin Starr suggest that he was a bad manager, distracted by other concerns and impaired by his alcoholism. Starr notes that London was absent from his ranch about six months a year between 1910 and 1916 and says, &quot;He liked the show of managerial power, but not grinding attention to detail ... London&#x27;s workers laughed at his efforts to play big-time rancher [and considered] the operation a rich man&#x27;s hobby.&quot;

London spent $80,000 ($ in current value) to build a stone mansion called Wolf House on the property. Just as the mansion was nearing completion, two weeks before the Londons planned to move in, it was destroyed by fire.

London&#x27;s last visit to Hawaii, beginning in December 1915, lasted eight months. He met with Duke Kahanamoku, Prince Jonah Kūhiō Kalaniana&#x27;ole, Queen Lili&#x27;uokalani and many others, before returning to his ranch in July 1916. He was suffering from kidney failure, but he continued to work.

The ranch (abutting stone remnants of Wolf House) is now a National Historic Landmark and is protected in Jack London State Historic Park.

== Animal activism ==
London witnessed animal cruelty in the training of circus animals, and his subsequent novels &quot;Jerry of the Islands&quot; and &quot;Michael, Brother of Jerry&quot; included a foreword entreating the public to become more informed about this practice. In 1918, the Massachusetts Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and the American Humane Education Society teamed up to create the Jack London Club, which sought to inform the public about cruelty to circus animals and encourage them to protest this establishment. Support from Club members led to a temporary cessation of trained animal acts at Ringling–Barnum and Bailey in 1925.

== Death ==
London died November 22, 1916, in a sleeping porch in a cottage on his ranch. London had been a robust man but had suffered several serious illnesses, including scurvy in the Klondike. Additionally, during travels on the &quot;Snark&quot;, he and Charmian picked up unspecified tropical infections and diseases, including yaws. At the time of his death, he suffered from dysentery, late-stage alcoholism, and uremia; he was in extreme pain and taking morphine and opium, both common over-the-counter drugs at the time.

London&#x27;s ashes were buried on his property not far from the Wolf House. London&#x27;s funeral took place on November 26, 1916, attended only by close friends, relatives, and workers of the property. In accordance with his wishes, he was cremated and buried next to some pioneer children, under a rock that belonged to the Wolf House. After Charmian&#x27;s death in 1955, she was also cremated and then buried with her husband in the same spot that her husband chose. The grave is marked by a mossy boulder. The buildings and property were later preserved as Jack London State Historic Park, in Glen Ellen, California.
===Suicide debate===
Because he was using morphine, many older sources describe London&#x27;s death as a suicide, and some still do. This conjecture appears to be a rumor, or speculation based on incidents in his fiction writings. His death certificate gives the cause as uremia, following acute renal colic.

The biographer Clarice Stasz writes, &quot;Following London&#x27;s death, for a number of reasons, a biographical myth developed in which he has been portrayed as an alcoholic womanizer who committed suicide. Recent scholarship based upon firsthand documents challenges this caricature.&quot; Most biographers, including Russ Kingman, now agree he died of uremia aggravated by an accidental morphine overdose.

London&#x27;s fiction features several suicides. In his autobiographical memoir &quot;John Barleycorn&quot;, he claims, as a youth, to have drunkenly stumbled overboard into the San Francisco Bay, &quot;some maundering fancy of going out with the tide suddenly obsessed me.&quot; He said he drifted and nearly succeeded in drowning before sobering up and being rescued by fishermen. In the dénouement of &quot;The Little Lady of the Big House&quot;, the heroine, confronted by the pain of a mortal gunshot wound, undergoes a physician-assisted suicide by morphine. Also, in &quot;Martin Eden&quot;, the principal protagonist, who shares certain characteristics with London, drowns himself.

== Plagiarism accusations ==

London was vulnerable to accusations of plagiarism, both because he was such a conspicuous, prolific, and successful writer and because of his methods of working. He wrote in a letter to Elwyn Hoffman, &quot;expression, you see—with me—is far easier than invention.&quot; He purchased plots and novels from the young Sinclair Lewis and used incidents from newspaper clippings as writing material.

In July 1901, two pieces of fiction appeared within the same month: London&#x27;s &quot;Moon-Face&quot;, in the &quot;San Francisco Argonaut,&quot; and Frank Norris&#x27; &quot;The Passing of Cock-eye Blacklock&quot;, in &quot;Century Magazine&quot;. Newspapers showed the similarities between the stories, which London said were &quot;quite different in manner of treatment, [but] patently the same in foundation and motive.&quot; London explained both writers based their stories on the same newspaper account. A year later, it was discovered that Charles Forrest McLean had published a fictional story also based on the same incident.

Egerton Ryerson Young claimed &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; (1903) was taken from Young&#x27;s book &quot;My Dogs in the Northland&quot; (1902). London acknowledged using it as a source and claimed to have written a letter to Young thanking him.

In 1906, the &quot;New York World&quot; published &quot;deadly parallel&quot; columns showing eighteen passages from London&#x27;s short story &quot;Love of Life&quot; side by side with similar passages from a nonfiction article by Augustus Biddle and J. K. Macdonald, titled &quot;Lost in the Land of the Midnight Sun&quot;. London noted the &quot;World&quot; did not accuse him of &quot;plagiarism&quot;, but only of &quot;identity of time and situation&quot;, to which he defiantly &quot;pled guilty&quot;.

The most serious charge of plagiarism was based on London&#x27;s &quot;The Bishop&#x27;s Vision&quot;, Chapter 7 of his novel &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; (1908). The chapter is nearly identical to an ironic essay that Frank Harris published in 1901, titled &quot;The Bishop of London and Public Morality&quot;. Harris was incensed and suggested he should receive 1/60th of the royalties from &quot;The Iron Heel,&quot; the disputed material constituting about that fraction of the whole novel. London insisted he had clipped a reprint of the article, which had appeared in an American newspaper, and believed it to be a genuine speech delivered by the Bishop of London.

== Views ==
===Atheism===
London was an atheist. He is quoted as saying, &quot;I believe that when I am dead, I am dead. I believe that with my death I am just as much obliterated as the last mosquito you and I squashed.&quot;

=== Political views ===
London wrote from a socialist viewpoint, which is evident in his novel &quot;The Iron Heel&quot;. Neither a theorist nor an intellectual socialist, London&#x27;s socialism grew out of his life experience. As London explained in his essay &quot;How I Became a Socialist&quot;, his views were influenced by his experience with people at the bottom of the social pit. His optimism and individualism faded, and he vowed never to do more hard physical work than necessary. He wrote that his individualism was hammered out of him, and he was politically reborn. He often closed his letters &quot;Yours for the Revolution&quot;.

London joined the Socialist Labor Party in April 1896. In the same year, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; published a story about the twenty-year-old London&#x27;s giving nightly speeches in Oakland&#x27;s City Hall Park, an activity he was arrested for a year later. In 1901, he left the Socialist Labor Party and joined the new Socialist Party of America. He ran unsuccessfully as the high-profile Socialist candidate for mayor of Oakland in 1901 (receiving 245 votes) and 1905 (improving to 981 votes), toured the country lecturing on socialism in 1906, and published two collections of essays about socialism: &quot;War of the Classes&quot; (1905) and &quot;Revolution, and other Essays&quot; (1906).

Stasz notes: &quot;London regarded the Wobblies as a welcome addition to the Socialist cause, although he never joined them in going so far as to recommend sabotage.&quot; Stasz mentions a personal meeting between London and Big Bill Haywood in 1912. In his 1913 book &quot;The Cruise of the Snark&quot;, London writes about appeals to him for membership of the &quot;Snark&quot;&#x27;s crew from office workers and other &quot;toilers&quot; who longed for escape from the cities, and of being cheated by workmen.

In his Glen Ellen ranch years, London felt some ambivalence toward socialism and complained about the &quot;inefficient Italian labourers&quot; in his employ. In 1916, he resigned from the Glen Ellen chapter of the Socialist Party. In an unflattering portrait of London&#x27;s ranch days, California cultural historian Kevin Starr refers to this period as &quot;post-socialist&quot; and says that &quot;[...] by 1911 [...] London was more bored by the class struggle than he cared to admit.&quot;

George Orwell, however, identified a fascist strain in London&#x27;s outlook:But temperamentally he was very different from the majority of Marxists. With his love of violence and physical strength, his belief in &#x27;natural aristocracy&#x27;, his animal-worship and exaltation of the primitive, he had in him what one might fairly call a Fascist strain.
====Electoral history====






=== Race ===
London shared common concerns among many European Americans in California about Asian immigration, described as &quot;the yellow peril&quot;; he used the latter term as the title of a 1904 essay. This theme was also the subject of a story he wrote in 1910 called &quot;The Unparalleled Invasion&quot;. Presented as an historical essay set in the future, the story narrates events between 1976 and 1987, in which China, with an ever-increasing population, is taking over and colonizing its neighbors with the intention of taking over the entire Earth. The western nations respond with biological warfare and bombard China with dozens of the most infectious diseases. On his fears about China, he admits (at the end of &quot;The Yellow Peril&quot;), &quot;it must be taken into consideration that the above postulate is itself a product of Western race-egotism, urged by our belief in our own righteousness and fostered by a faith in ourselves which may be as erroneous as are most fond race fancies.&quot;

By contrast, many of London&#x27;s short stories are notable for their empathetic portrayal of Mexican (&quot;The Mexican&quot;), Asian (&quot;The Chinago&quot;), and Hawaiian (&quot;Koolau the Leper&quot;) characters. London&#x27;s war correspondence from the Russo-Japanese War, as well as his unfinished novel &quot;Cherry&quot;, show he admired much about Japanese customs and capabilities. London&#x27;s writings have been popular among the Japanese, who believe he portrayed them positively.

In &quot;Koolau the Leper&quot;, London describes Koolau, who is a Hawaiian leper—and thus a very different sort of &quot;superman&quot; than Martin Eden—and who fights off an entire cavalry troop to elude capture, as &quot;indomitable spiritually—a ... magnificent rebel&quot;. This character is based on Hawaiian leper Kaluaikoolau, who in 1893 revolted and resisted capture from forces of the Provisional Government of Hawaii in the Kalalau Valley.

Those who defend London against charges of racism cite the letter he wrote to the &quot;Japanese-American Commercial Weekly&quot; in 1913:

In 1996, after the City of Whitehorse, Yukon, renamed a street in honor of London, protests over London&#x27;s alleged racism forced the city to change the name of &quot;Jack London Boulevard&quot; back to &quot;Two-mile Hill&quot;.

Shortly after boxer Jack Johnson was crowned the first black world heavyweight champ in 1908, London pleaded for a &quot;great white hope&quot; to come forward to defeat Johnson, writing: &quot;Jim Jeffries must now emerge from his Alfalfa farm and remove that golden smile from Jack Johnson&#x27;s face. Jeff, it&#x27;s up to you. The White Man must be rescued.&quot;

===Eugenics===

With other modernist writers of the day, London supported eugenics. The notion of &quot;good breeding&quot; complemented the Progressive era scientism, the belief that humans assort along a hierarchy by race, religion, and ethnicity. The Progressive Era catalog of inferiority offered basis for threats to American Anglo-Saxon racial integrity. London wrote to Frederick H. Robinson of the periodical &quot;Medical Review of Reviews&quot;, stating, &quot;I believe the future belongs to eugenics, and will be determined by the practice of eugenics.&quot; Although this led some to argue for forced sterilization of criminals or those deemed feeble-minded, London did not express this extreme. His short story &quot;Told in the Drooling Ward&quot; is from the viewpoint of a surprisingly astute &quot;feebled-minded&quot; person.

Hensley argues that London&#x27;s novel &quot;Before Adam&quot; (1906–07) reveals pro-eugenic themes. London advised his collaborator Anna Strunsky during preparation of &quot;The Kempton-Wace Letters&quot; that he would take the role of eugenics in mating, while she would argue on behalf of romantic love. (Love won the argument.) &quot;The Valley of the Moon&quot; emphasizes the theme of &quot;real Americans,&quot; the Anglo Saxon, yet in &quot;Little Lady of the Big House&quot;, London is more nuanced. The protagonist&#x27;s argument is not that all white men are superior, but that there are more superior ones among whites than in other races. By encouraging the best in any race to mate will improve its population qualities. Living in Hawaii challenged his orthodoxy. In &quot;My Hawaiian Aloha,&quot; London noted the liberal intermarrying of races, concluding how &quot;little Hawaii, with its hotch potch races, is making a better demonstration than the United States.&quot;

== Works ==
=== Short stories ===

Western writer and historian Dale L. Walker writes:

London&#x27;s &quot;strength of utterance&quot; is at its height in his stories, and they are painstakingly well-constructed. &quot;To Build a Fire&quot; is the best known of all his stories. Set in the harsh Klondike, it recounts the haphazard trek of a new arrival who has ignored an old-timer&#x27;s warning about the risks of traveling alone. Falling through the ice into a creek in seventy-five-below weather, the unnamed man is keenly aware that survival depends on his untested skills at quickly building a fire to dry his clothes and warm his extremities. After publishing a tame version of this story—with a sunny outcome—in &quot;The Youth&#x27;s Companion&quot; in 1902, London offered a second, more severe take on the man&#x27;s predicament in &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; in 1908. Reading both provides an illustration of London&#x27;s growth and maturation as a writer. As Labor (1994) observes: &quot;To compare the two versions is itself an instructive lesson in what distinguished a great work of literary art from a good children&#x27;s story.&quot;

Other stories from the Klondike period include: &quot;All Gold Canyon&quot;, about a battle between a gold prospector and a claim jumper; &quot;The Law of Life&quot;, about an aging American Indian man abandoned by his tribe and left to die; &quot;Love of Life&quot;, about a trek by a prospector across the Canadian tundra; &quot;To the Man on Trail,&quot; which tells the story of a prospector fleeing the Mounted Police in a sled race, and raises the question of the contrast between written law and morality; and &quot;An Odyssey of the North,&quot; which raises questions of conditional morality, and paints a sympathetic portrait of a man of mixed White and Aleut ancestry.

London was a boxing fan and an avid amateur boxer. &quot;A Piece of Steak&quot; is a tale about a match between older and younger boxers. It contrasts the differing experiences of youth and age but also raises the social question of the treatment of aging workers. &quot;The Mexican&quot; combines boxing with a social theme, as a young Mexican endures an unfair fight and ethnic prejudice to earn money with which to aid the revolution.

Several of London&#x27;s stories would today be classified as science fiction. &quot;The Unparalleled Invasion&quot; describes germ warfare against China; &quot;Goliath&quot; is about an irresistible energy weapon; &quot;The Shadow and the Flash&quot; is a tale about two brothers who take different routes to achieving invisibility; &quot;A Relic of the Pliocene&quot; is a tall tale about an encounter of a modern-day man with a mammoth. &quot;The Red One&quot; is a late story from a period when London was intrigued by the theories of the psychiatrist and writer Jung. It tells of an island tribe held in thrall by an extraterrestrial object.

Some nineteen original collections of short stories were published during London&#x27;s brief life or shortly after his death. There have been several posthumous anthologies drawn from this pool of stories. Many of these stories were located in the Klondike and the Pacific. A collection of &quot;Jack London&#x27;s San Francisco Stories&quot; was published in October 2010 by Sydney Samizdat Press.

=== Novels ===
London&#x27;s most famous novels are &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot;, &quot;White Fang&quot;, &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot;, &quot;The Iron Heel&quot;, and &quot;Martin Eden&quot;.

In a letter dated December 27, 1901, London&#x27;s Macmillan publisher George Platt Brett, Sr., said &quot;he believed Jack&#x27;s fiction represented &#x27;the very best kind of work&#x27; done in America.&quot;

Critic Maxwell Geismar called &quot;The Call of the Wild&quot; &quot;a beautiful prose poem&quot;; editor Franklin Walker said that it &quot;belongs on a shelf with &quot;Walden&quot; and &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot;&quot;; and novelist E.L. Doctorow called it &quot;a mordant parable ... his masterpiece.&quot;

The historian Dale L. Walker commented:

Some critics have said that his novels are episodic and resemble linked short stories. Dale L. Walker writes:

Ambrose Bierce said of &quot;The Sea-Wolf&quot; that &quot;the great thing—and it is among the greatest of things—is that tremendous creation, Wolf Larsen ... the hewing out and setting up of such a figure is enough for a man to do in one lifetime.&quot; However, he noted, &quot;The love element, with its absurd suppressions, and impossible proprieties, is awful.&quot;

&quot;The Iron Heel&quot; is an example of a dystopian novel that anticipates and influenced George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;. London&#x27;s socialist politics are explicitly on display here. &quot;The Iron Heel&quot; meets the contemporary definition of soft science fiction. &quot;The Star Rover&quot; (1915) is also science fiction.

=== &quot;Credo&quot; is likely by London despite doubts ===
London&#x27;s literary executor, Irving Shepard, quoted a &quot;Jack London Credo&quot; in an introduction to a 1956 collection of London stories:

&lt;poem&gt;
I would rather be ashes than dust!
I would rather that my spark should burn out in a brilliant blaze than it should be stifled by dry-rot.
I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.
The function of man is to live, not to exist.
I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong them.
I shall use my time.
&lt;/poem&gt;

The biographer Stasz notes that the passage &quot;has many marks of London&#x27;s style&quot; but the only line that could be safely attributed to London was the first. The words Shepard quoted were from a story in the &quot;San Francisco Bulletin&quot;, December 2, 1916, by journalist Ernest J. Hopkins, who visited the ranch just weeks before London&#x27;s death. Stasz notes, &quot;Even more so than today journalists&#x27; quotes were unreliable or even sheer inventions,&quot; and says no direct source in London&#x27;s writings has been found. However, at least one line, according to Stasz, is authentic, being referenced by London and written in his own hand in the autograph book of Australian suffragette Vida Goldstein:

&lt;poem&gt;
Dear Miss Goldstein:–
Seven years ago I wrote you that I&#x27;d rather be ashes than dust. I still subscribe to that sentiment.
Sincerely yours,
Jack London
Jan. 13, 1909
&lt;/poem&gt;

In his short story &quot;By The Turtles of Tasman&quot;, a character, defending her &quot;ne&#x27;er-do-well grasshopperish father&quot; to her &quot;antlike uncle&quot;, says: &quot;... my father has been a king. He has lived ... Have you lived merely to live? Are you afraid to die? I&#x27;d rather sing one wild song and burst my heart with it, than live a thousand years watching my digestion and being afraid of the wet. When you are dust, my father will be ashes.&quot;

The last three sentences of the credo have been deemed to be an authentic quotation of Jack London by &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of American Quotations&quot;. Likewise, National Public Radio has ascribed the quotation to Jack London, and explained that it was published via a journalist; NPR did not question the accuracy of that reporter who first published the credo in 1916.

Part of the credo was used to describe the philosophy of the fictional character James Bond, in the Ian Fleming novel &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; (1964), and again in the movie &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021). According to a 2021 article about that Bond movie in &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;The quote was originally...by the American writer Jack London...&quot;

=== Diatribe about scabs has unknown author ===
A short diatribe on &quot;The Scab&quot; is often quoted within the U.S. labor movement and frequently attributed to London. It opens:

In 1913 and 1914, a number of newspapers printed the first three sentences with varying terms used instead of &quot;scab&quot;, such as
&quot;knocker&quot;,
&quot;stool pigeon&quot;
or &quot;scandal monger&quot;. Those newspapers did not attribute those sentences to London.

This passage as given above was the subject of a 1974 Supreme Court case, &quot;Letter Carriers v. Austin&quot;, in which Justice Thurgood Marshall referred to it as &quot;a well-known piece of trade union literature, generally attributed to author Jack London&quot;. A union newsletter had published a &quot;list of scabs,&quot; which was granted to be factual and therefore not libelous, but then went on to quote the passage as the &quot;definition of a scab&quot;. The case turned on the question of whether the &quot;definition&quot; was defamatory. The court ruled that &quot;Jack London&#x27;s... &#x27;definition of a scab&#x27; is merely rhetorical hyperbole, a lusty and imaginative expression of the contempt felt by union members towards those who refuse to join&quot;, and as such was not libelous and was protected under the First Amendment.

Despite being frequently attributed to London, the passage does not appear at all in the extensive collection of his writings at Sonoma State University&#x27;s website. However, in his book &quot;War of the Classes&quot; he published a 1903 speech titled &quot;The Scab&quot;, which gave a much more balanced view of the topic:

<doc id="42986" wikidata="Q124164" url="?curid=42986" title="Alternating current">
<text>Alternating current (AC) is an electric current that periodically reverses direction and changes its magnitude continuously with time, in contrast to direct current (DC), which flows only in one direction. Alternating current is the form in which electric power is delivered to businesses and residences, and it is the form of electrical energy that consumers typically use when they plug kitchen appliances, televisions, fans and electric lamps into a wall socket. The abbreviations &quot;AC&quot; and &quot;DC&quot; are often used to mean simply &quot;alternating&quot; and &quot;direct&quot;, respectively, as when they modify &quot;current&quot; or &quot;voltage&quot;.

The usual waveform of alternating current in most electric power circuits is a sine wave, whose positive half-period corresponds with positive direction of the current and vice versa (the full period is called a &quot;cycle&quot;). &quot;Alternating current&quot; most commonly refers to power distribution, but a wide range of other applications are technically alternating current although it is less common to describe them by that term. In many applications, like guitar amplifiers, different waveforms are used, such as triangular waves or square waves. Audio and radio signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. These types of alternating current carry information such as sound (audio) or images (video) sometimes carried by modulation of an AC carrier signal. These currents typically alternate at higher frequencies than those used in power transmission.

== Transmission, distribution, and domestic power supply ==

Electrical energy is distributed as alternating current because AC voltage may be increased or decreased with a transformer. This allows the power to be transmitted through power lines efficiently at high voltage, which reduces the energy lost as heat due to resistance of the wire, and transformed to a lower, safer voltage for use. Use of a higher voltage leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power. The power losses (formula_1) in the wire are a product of the square of the current ( I ) and the resistance (R) of the wire, described by the formula:

:formula_2

This means that when transmitting a fixed power on a given wire, if the current is halved (i.e. the voltage is doubled), the power loss due to the wire&#x27;s resistance will be reduced to one quarter.

The power transmitted is equal to the product of the current and the voltage (assuming no phase difference); that is,
:formula_3
Consequently, power transmitted at a higher voltage requires less loss-producing current than for the same power at a lower voltage. Power is often transmitted at hundreds of kilovolts on pylons, and transformed down to tens of kilovolts to be transmitted on lower level lines, and finally transformed down to 100 V – 240 V for domestic use.

High voltages have disadvantages, such as the increased insulation required, and generally increased difficulty in their safe handling. In a power plant, energy is generated at a convenient voltage for the design of a generator, and then stepped up to a high voltage for transmission. Near the loads, the transmission voltage is stepped down to the voltages used by equipment. Consumer voltages vary somewhat depending on the country and size of load, but generally motors and lighting are built to use up to a few hundred volts between phases. The voltage delivered to equipment such as lighting and motor loads is standardized, with an allowable range of voltage over which equipment is expected to operate. Standard power utilization voltages and percentage tolerance vary in the different mains power systems found in the world.

High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) electric power transmission systems have become more viable as technology has provided efficient means of changing the voltage of DC power. Transmission with high voltage direct current was not feasible in the early days of electric power transmission, as there was then no economically viable way to step the voltage of DC down for end user applications such as lighting incandescent bulbs.

Three-phase electrical generation is very common. The simplest way is to use three separate coils in the generator stator, physically offset by an angle of 120° (one-third of a complete 360° phase) to each other. Three current waveforms are produced that are equal in magnitude and 120° out of phase to each other. If coils are added opposite to these (60° spacing), they generate the same phases with reverse polarity and so can be simply wired together. In practice, higher &quot;pole orders&quot; are commonly used. For example, a 12-pole machine would have 36 coils (10° spacing). The advantage is that lower rotational speeds can be used to generate the same frequency. For example, a 2-pole machine running at 3600 rpm and a 12-pole machine running at 600 rpm produce the same frequency; the lower speed is preferable for larger machines. If the load on a three-phase system is balanced equally among the phases, no current flows through the neutral point. Even in the worst-case unbalanced (linear) load, the neutral current will not exceed the highest of the phase currents. Non-linear loads (e.g. the switch-mode power supplies widely used) may require an oversized neutral bus and neutral conductor in the upstream distribution panel to handle harmonics. Harmonics can cause neutral conductor current levels to exceed that of one or all phase conductors.

For three-phase at utilization voltages a four-wire system is often used. When stepping down three-phase, a transformer with a Delta (3-wire) primary and a Star (4-wire, center-earthed) secondary is often used so there is no need for a neutral on the supply side. For smaller customers (just how small varies by country and age of the installation) only a single phase and neutral, or two phases and neutral, are taken to the property. For larger installations, all three phases and neutral are taken to the main distribution panel. From the three-phase main panel, both single and three-phase circuits may lead off. Three-wire single-phase systems, with a single center-tapped transformer giving two live conductors, is a common distribution scheme for residential and small commercial buildings in North America. This arrangement is sometimes incorrectly referred to as &quot;two phase&quot;. A similar method is used for a different reason on construction sites in the UK. Small power tools and lighting are supposed to be supplied by a local center-tapped transformer with a voltage of 55 V between each power conductor and earth. This significantly reduces the risk of electric shock in the event that one of the live conductors becomes exposed through an equipment fault whilst still allowing a reasonable voltage of 110 V between the two conductors for running the tools.

An additional wire, called the bond (or earth) wire, is often connected between non-current-carrying metal enclosures and earth ground. This conductor provides protection from electric shock due to accidental contact of circuit conductors with the metal chassis of portable appliances and tools. Bonding all non-current-carrying metal parts into one complete system ensures there is always a low electrical impedance path to ground sufficient to carry any fault current for as long as it takes for the system to clear the fault. This low impedance path allows the maximum amount of fault current, causing the overcurrent protection device (breakers, fuses) to trip or burn out as quickly as possible, bringing the electrical system to a safe state. All bond wires are bonded to ground at the main service panel, as is the neutral/identified conductor if present.

The frequency of the electrical system varies by country and sometimes within a country; most electric power is generated at either 50 or 60 Hertz (Hz). Some countries have a mixture of 50 Hz and 60 Hz supplies, notably electricity power transmission in Japan. 

===Low frequency===
A low frequency eases the design of electric motors, particularly for hoisting, crushing and rolling applications, and commutator-type traction motors for applications such as railways. However, low frequency also causes noticeable flicker in arc lamps and incandescent light bulbs. The use of lower frequencies also provided the advantage of lower transmission losses, which are proportional to frequency. 

The original Niagara Falls generators were built to produce 25 Hz power, as a compromise between low frequency for traction and heavy induction motors, while still allowing incandescent lighting to operate (although with noticeable flicker). Most of the 25 Hz residential and commercial customers for Niagara Falls power were converted to 60 Hz by the late 1950s, although some 25 Hz industrial customers still existed as of the start of the 21st century. 16.7 Hz power (formerly 16 2/3 Hz) is still used in some European rail systems, such as in Austria, Germany, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland.

===High frequency===
Off-shore, military, textile industry, marine, aircraft, and spacecraft applications sometimes use 400 Hz, for benefits of reduced weight of apparatus or higher motor speeds. Computer mainframe systems were often powered by 400 Hz or 415 Hz for benefits of ripple reduction while using smaller internal AC to DC conversion units.

== Effects at high frequencies ==
A direct current flows uniformly throughout the cross-section of a homogeneous electrically conducting wire. An alternating current of any frequency is forced away from the wire&#x27;s center, toward its outer surface. This is because an alternating current (which is the result of the acceleration of electric charge) creates electromagnetic waves (a phenomenon known as electromagnetic radiation). Electric conductors are not conducive to electromagnetic waves (a perfect electric conductor prohibits all electromagnetic waves within its boundary), so a wire that is made of a non-perfect conductor (a conductor with finite, rather than infinite, electrical conductivity) pushes the alternating current, along with their associated electromagnetic fields, away from the wire&#x27;s center. The phenomenon of alternating current being pushed away from the center of the conductor is called skin effect, and a direct current does not exhibit this effect, since a direct current does not create electromagnetic waves. 

At very high frequencies, the current no longer flows &quot;in&quot; the wire, but effectively flows &quot;on&quot; the surface of the wire, within a thickness of a few skin depths. The skin depth is the thickness at which the current density is reduced by 63%. Even at relatively low frequencies used for power transmission (50 Hz – 60 Hz), non-uniform distribution of current still occurs in sufficiently thick conductors. For example, the skin depth of a copper conductor is approximately 8.57 mm at 60 Hz, so high-current conductors are usually hollow to reduce their mass and cost. This tendency of alternating current to flow predominantly in the periphery of conductors reduces the effective cross-section of the conductor. This increases the effective AC resistance of the conductor since resistance is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. A conductor&#x27;s AC resistance is higher than its DC resistance, causing a higher energy loss due to ohmic heating (also called I2R loss).

=== Techniques for reducing AC resistance ===
For low to medium frequencies, conductors can be divided into stranded wires, each insulated from the others, with the relative positions of individual strands specially arranged within the conductor bundle. Wire constructed using this technique is called Litz wire. This measure helps to partially mitigate skin effect by forcing more equal current throughout the total cross section of the stranded conductors. Litz wire is used for making high-Q inductors, reducing losses in flexible conductors carrying very high currents at lower frequencies, and in the windings of devices carrying higher radio frequency current (up to hundreds of kilohertz), such as switch-mode power supplies and radio frequency transformers.

=== Techniques for reducing radiation loss ===
As written above, an alternating current is made of electric charge under periodic acceleration, which causes radiation of electromagnetic waves. Energy that is radiated is lost. Depending on the frequency, different techniques are used to minimize the loss due to radiation.

==== Twisted pairs ====
At frequencies up to about 1 GHz, pairs of wires are twisted together in a cable, forming a twisted pair. This reduces losses from electromagnetic radiation and inductive coupling. A twisted pair must be used with a balanced signaling system so that the two wires carry equal but opposite currents. Each wire in a twisted pair radiates a signal, but it is effectively canceled by radiation from the other wire, resulting in almost no radiation loss.

==== Coaxial cables ====
Coaxial cables are commonly used at audio frequencies and above for convenience. A coaxial cable has a conductive wire inside a conductive tube, separated by a dielectric layer. The current flowing on the surface of the inner conductor is equal and opposite to the current flowing on the inner surface of the outer tube. The electromagnetic field is thus completely contained within the tube, and (ideally) no energy is lost to radiation or coupling outside the tube. Coaxial cables have acceptably small losses for frequencies up to about 5 GHz. For microwave frequencies greater than 5 GHz, the losses (due mainly to the dielectric separating the inner and outer tubes being a non-ideal insulator) become too large, making waveguides a more efficient medium for transmitting energy. Coaxial cables often use a perforated dielectric layer to separate the inner and outer conductors in order to minimize the power dissipated by the dielectric.

==== Waveguides ====
Waveguides are similar to coaxial cables, as both consist of tubes, with the biggest difference being that waveguides have no inner conductor. Waveguides can have any arbitrary cross section, but rectangular cross sections are the most common. Because waveguides do not have an inner conductor to carry a return current, waveguides cannot deliver energy by means of an electric current, but rather by means of a &quot;guided&quot; electromagnetic field. Although surface currents do flow on the inner walls of the waveguides, those surface currents do not carry power. Power is carried by the guided electromagnetic fields. The surface currents are set up by the guided electromagnetic fields and have the effect of keeping the fields inside the waveguide and preventing leakage of the fields to the space outside the waveguide. Waveguides have dimensions comparable to the wavelength of the alternating current to be transmitted, so they are feasible only at microwave frequencies. In addition to this mechanical feasibility, electrical resistance of the non-ideal metals forming the walls of the waveguide causes dissipation of power (surface currents flowing on lossy conductors dissipate power). At higher frequencies, the power lost to this dissipation becomes unacceptably large.

==== Fiber optics ====
At frequencies greater than 200 GHz, waveguide dimensions become impractically small, and the ohmic losses in the waveguide walls become large. Instead, fiber optics, which are a form of dielectric waveguides, can be used. For such frequencies, the concepts of voltages and currents are no longer used.

==Formulation==

Alternating currents are accompanied (or caused) by alternating voltages. An AC voltage &quot;v&quot; can be described mathematically as a function of time by the following equation:

:formula_4,

where
* formula_5 is the peak voltage (unit: volt),
* formula_6 is the angular frequency (unit: radians per second). The angular frequency is related to the physical frequency, formula_7 (unit: hertz), which represents the number of cycles per second, by the equation formula_8.
* formula_9 is the time (unit: second).

The peak-to-peak value of an AC voltage is defined as the difference between its positive peak and its negative peak. Since the maximum value of formula_10 is +1 and the minimum value is −1, an AC voltage swings between formula_11 and formula_12. The peak-to-peak voltage, usually written as formula_13 or formula_14, is therefore formula_15.

=== Root mean square voltage ===


Below an AC waveform (with no DC component) is assumed.

The RMS voltage is the square root of the mean over one cycle of the square of the instantaneous voltage.

.&lt;/math&gt;
| For a sinusoidal voltage:
: formula_16

where the trigonometric identity formula_17 has been used and the factor formula_18 is called the crest factor, which varies for different waveforms.
| For a triangle waveform centered about zero
: formula_19
| For a square waveform centered about zero
: formula_20

=== Power ===
The relationship between voltage and the power delivered is:
:formula_21,

where formula_22 represents a load resistance.

Rather than using instantaneous power, formula_23, it is more practical to use a time-averaged power (where the averaging is performed over any integer number of cycles). Therefore, AC voltage is often expressed as a root mean square (RMS) value, written as formula_24, because
:formula_25

;Power oscillation: formula_26
For this reason, AC power&#x27;s waveform becomes Full-wave rectified sine, and its fundamental frequency is double of the one of the voltage&#x27;s.
=== Examples of alternating current ===
To illustrate these concepts, consider a 230 V AC mains supply used in many countries around the world. It is so called because its root mean square value is 230 V. This means that the time-averaged power delivered formula_27 is equivalent to the power delivered by a DC voltage of 230 V. To determine the peak voltage (amplitude), we can rearrange the above equation to:
:formula_28
:formula_29

For 230 V AC, the peak voltage formula_5 is therefore formula_31, which is about 325 V, and the peak power formula_32 is formula_33, that is 460 RW. During the course of one cycle (two cycle as the power) the voltage rises from zero to 325 V, the power from zero to 460 RW, and both falls through zero. Next, the voltage descends to reverse direction, -325 V, but the power ascends again to 460 RW, and both returns to zero.

== Information transmission ==
Alternating current is used to transmit information, as in the cases of telephone and cable television. Information signals are carried over a wide range of AC frequencies. POTS telephone signals have a frequency of about 3 kHz, close to the baseband audio frequency. Cable television and other cable-transmitted information currents may alternate at frequencies of tens to thousands of megahertz. These frequencies are similar to the electromagnetic wave frequencies often used to transmit the same types of information over the air.

== History ==
The first alternator to produce alternating current was an electric generator based on Michael Faraday&#x27;s principles constructed by the French instrument maker Hippolyte Pixii in 1832. Pixii later added a commutator to his device to produce the (then) more commonly used direct current. The earliest recorded practical application of alternating current is by Guillaume Duchenne, inventor and developer of electrotherapy. In 1855, he announced that AC was superior to direct current for electrotherapeutic triggering of muscle contractions. Alternating current technology was developed further by the Hungarian Ganz Works company in the 1870s, and, in the 1880s, by Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, Lucien Gaulard, and Galileo Ferraris.

In 1876, Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov invented a lighting system where sets of induction coils were installed along a high-voltage AC line. Instead of changing voltage, the primary windings transferred power to the secondary windings which were connected to one or several electric candles (arc lamps) of his own design, used to keep the failure of one lamp from disabling the entire circuit. In 1878, the Ganz factory, Budapest, Hungary, began manufacturing equipment for electric lighting and, by 1883, had installed over fifty systems in Austria-Hungary. Their AC systems used arc and incandescent lamps, generators, and other equipment.

=== Transformers ===
The development of the alternating current transformer to change voltage from low to high level and back, allowed generation and consumption at low voltages and transmission, over great distances, at high voltage, with savings in the cost of conductors and energy losses. A bipolar open-core power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They exhibited an AC system powering arc and incandescent lights was installed along five railway stations for the Metropolitan Railway in London and a single-phase multiple-user AC distribution system Turin in 1884. These early induction coils with open magnetic circuits were inefficient at transferring power to loads. Until about 1880, the paradigm for AC power transmission from a high voltage supply to a low voltage load was a series circuit. Open-core transformers with a ratio near 1:1 were connected with their primaries in series to allow use of a high voltage for transmission while presenting a low voltage to the lamps. The inherent flaw in this method was that turning off a single lamp (or other electric device) affected the voltage supplied to all others on the same circuit. Many adjustable transformer designs were introduced to compensate for this problematic characteristic of the series circuit, including those employing methods of adjusting the core or bypassing the magnetic flux around part of a coil. The direct current systems did not have these drawbacks, giving it significant advantages over early AC systems.

In the UK, Sebastian de Ferranti, who had been developing AC generators and transformers in London since 1882, redesigned the AC system at the Grosvenor Gallery power station in 1886 for the London Electric Supply Corporation (LESCo) including alternators of his own design and open core transformer designs with serial connections for utilization loads - similar to Gaulard and Gibbs. In 1890, he designed their power station at Deptford and converted the Grosvenor Gallery station across the Thames into an electrical substation, showing the way to integrate older plants into a universal AC supply system.

In the autumn of 1884, Károly Zipernowsky, Ottó Bláthy and Miksa Déri (ZBD), three engineers associated with the Ganz Works of Budapest, determined that open-core devices were impractical, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage. Bláthy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and Déri had performed the experiments; In their joint 1885 patent applications for novel transformers (later called ZBD transformers), they described two designs with closed magnetic circuits where copper windings were either wound around a ring core of iron wires or else surrounded by a core of iron wires. In both designs, the magnetic flux linking the primary and secondary windings traveled almost entirely within the confines of the iron core, with no intentional path through air (see toroidal cores). The new transformers were 3.4 times more efficient than the open-core bipolar devices of Gaulard and Gibbs. The Ganz factory in 1884 shipped the world&#x27;s first five high-efficiency AC transformers. This first unit had been manufactured to the following specifications: 1,400 W, 40 Hz, 120:72 V, 11.6:19.4 A, ratio 1.67:1, one-phase, shell form.

The ZBD patents included two other major interrelated innovations: one concerning the use of parallel connected, instead of series connected, utilization loads, the other concerning the ability to have high turns ratio transformers such that the supply network voltage could be much higher (initially 140 to 2000 V) than the voltage of utilization loads (100 V initially preferred). When employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces.
The other essential milestone was the introduction of &#x27;voltage source, voltage intensive&#x27; (VSVI) systems&#x27; by the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885. In early 1885, the three engineers also eliminated the problem of eddy current losses with the invention of the lamination of electromagnetic cores. Ottó Bláthy also invented the first AC electricity meter.

===Adoption===

The AC power system was developed and adopted rapidly after 1886. In March of that year, Westinghouse engineer William Stanley, designing a system based on the Gaulard and Gibbs transformer, demonstrated a lighting system in Great Barrington: A Siemens generator&#x27;s voltage of 500 volts was converted into 3000 volts, and then the voltage was stepped down to 500 volts by six Westinghouse transformers. With this setup, the Westinghouse company successfully powered thirty 100-volt incandescent bulbs in twenty shops along the main street of Great Barrington. By the fall of that year Ganz engineers installed a ZBD transformer power system with AC generators in Rome.

Based on Stanley&#x27;s success, the new Westinghouse Electric went on to develop alternating current (AC) electric infrastructure throughout the United States. The spread of Westinghouse and other AC systems triggered a push back in late 1887 by Thomas Edison (a proponent of direct current), who attempted to discredit alternating current as too dangerous in a public campaign called the &quot;war of the currents&quot;. 

In 1888, alternating current systems gained further viability with the introduction of a functional AC motor, something these systems had lacked up till then. The design, an induction motor, was independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla (with Tesla&#x27;s design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US). This design was independently further developed into the modern practical three-phase form by Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky and Charles Eugene Lancelot Brown in Germany on one side, and Jonas Wenström in Sweden on the other, though Brown favored the two-phase system.

The Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant, constructed in 1890, was among the first hydroelectric alternating current power plants. A long-distance transmission of single-phase electricity from a hydroelectric generating plant in Oregon at Willamette Falls sent power fourteen miles downriver to downtown Portland for street lighting in 1890. In 1891, another transmission system was installed in Telluride Colorado. The first three-phase system was established in 1891 in Frankfurt, Germany. The Tivoli–Rome transmission was completed in 1892. The San Antonio Canyon Generator was the third commercial single-phase hydroelectric AC power plant in the United States to provide long-distance electricity. It was completed on December 31, 1892, by Almarian William Decker to provide power to the city of Pomona, California, which was 14 miles away. Meanwhile, the possibility of transferring electrical power from a waterfall at a distance was explored at the Grängesberg mine in Sweden. A fall at Hällsjön, Smedjebackens kommun, where a small iron work had been located, was selected. In 1893, a three-phase system was used to transfer 400 horsepower a distance of , becoming the first commercial application. In 1893, Westinghouse built an alternating current system for the Chicago World Exposition. In 1893, Decker designed the first American commercial three-phase power plant using alternating current—the hydroelectric Mill Creek No. 1 Hydroelectric Plant near Redlands, California. Decker&#x27;s design incorporated 10 kV three-phase transmission and established the standards for the complete system of generation, transmission and motors used in USA today. The original Niagara Falls Adams Power Plant with three two-phase generators was put into operation in August 1895, but was connected to the remote transmission system only in 1896. The Jaruga Hydroelectric Power Plant in Croatia was set in operation two days later, on 28 August 1895. Its generator (42 Hz, 240 kW) was made and installed by the Hungarian company Ganz, while the transmission line from the power plant to the City of Šibenik was long, and the municipal distribution grid 3000 V/110 V included six transforming stations.

Alternating current circuit theory developed rapidly in the latter part of the 19th and early 20th century. Notable contributors to the theoretical basis of alternating current calculations include Charles Steinmetz, Oliver Heaviside, and many others. Calculations in unbalanced three-phase systems were simplified by the symmetrical components methods discussed by Charles LeGeyt Fortescue in 1918.

<text>A convoy is a group of vehicles, typically motor vehicles or ships, traveling together for mutual support and protection. Often, a convoy is organized with armed defensive support and can help maintain cohesion within a unit. It may also be used in a non-military sense, for example when driving through remote areas.
==Naval convoys==
===Age of Sail===
Naval convoys have been in use for centuries, with examples of merchant ships traveling under naval protection dating to the 12th century. The use of organized naval convoys dates from when ships began to be separated into specialist classes and national navies were established.

By the French Revolutionary Wars of the late 18th century, effective naval convoy tactics had been developed to ward off pirates and privateers. Some convoys contained several hundred merchant ships. The most enduring system of convoys were the Spanish treasure fleets, that sailed from the 1520s until 1790.

When merchant ships sailed independently, a privateer could cruise a shipping lane and capture ships as they passed. Ships sailing in convoy presented a much smaller target: a convoy was as hard to find as a single ship. Even if the privateer found a convoy and the wind was favourable for an attack, it could still hope to capture only a handful of ships before the rest managed to escape, and a small escort of warships could easily thwart it. As a result of the convoy system&#x27;s effectiveness, wartime insurance premiums were consistently lower for ships that sailed in convoys.

Many naval battles in the Age of Sail were fought around convoys, including:
*The Battle of Portland (1653)
*The Battle of Ushant (1781)
*The Battle of Dogger Bank (1781)
*The Glorious First of June (1794)
*The Battle of Pulo Aura (1804)

By the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Royal Navy had in place a sophisticated convoy system to protect merchant ships. Losses of ships travelling out of convoy, however, were so high that no merchant ship was allowed to sail unescorted.

===World War I===

In the early 20th century, the dreadnought changed the balance of power in convoy battles. Steaming faster than merchant ships and firing at long ranges, a single battleship could destroy many ships in a convoy before the others could scatter over the horizon. To protect a convoy against a capital ship required providing it with an escort of another capital ship, at very high opportunity cost (i.e. potentially tying down multiple capital ships to defend different convoys against one opponent ship).

Battleships were the main reason that the British Admiralty did not adopt convoy tactics at the start of the first Battle of the Atlantic in World War I. But the German capital ships had been bottled up in the North Sea, and the main threat to shipping came from U-boats. From a tactical point of view, World War I–era submarines were similar to privateers in the age of sail. These submarines were only a little faster than the merchant ships they were attacking, and capable of sinking only a small number of vessels in a convoy because of their limited supply of torpedoes and shells. The Admiralty took a long time to respond to this change in the tactical position, and in April 1917 convoys were trialled, before being officially introduced in the Atlantic in September 1917.

Other arguments against convoys were raised. The primary issue was the loss of productivity, as merchant shipping in convoy has to travel at the speed of the slowest vessel in the convoy and spent a considerable amount of time in ports waiting for the next convoy to depart. Further, large convoys were thought to overload port resources.

Actual analysis of shipping losses in World War I disproved all these arguments, at least so far as they applied to transatlantic and other long-distance traffic. Ships sailing in convoys were far less likely to be sunk, even when not provided with an escort. The loss of productivity due to convoy delays was small compared with the loss of productivity due to ships being sunk. Ports could deal more easily with convoys because they tended to arrive on schedule and so loading and unloading could be planned.

In his book &quot;On the Psychology of Military Incompetence&quot;, Norman Dixon suggested that the hostility towards convoys in the naval establishment were in part caused by a (sub-conscious) perception of convoys as effeminating, due to warships having to care for civilian merchant ships. Convoy duty also exposes the escorting warships to the sometimes hazardous conditions of the North Atlantic, with only rare occurrences of visible achievement (i.e. fending off a submarine assault).

===World War II===
====Atlantic====


The British adopted a convoy system, initially voluntary and later compulsory for almost all merchant ships, the moment that World War II was declared. Each convoy consisted of between 30 and 70 mostly unarmed merchant ships. Canadian, and later American, supplies were vital for Britain to continue its war effort. The course of the Battle of the Atlantic was a long struggle as the Germans developed anti-convoy tactics and the British developed counter-tactics to thwart the Germans.

The capability of a heavily armed warship against a convoy was dramatically illustrated by the fate of Convoy HX 84. On November 5, 1940, the German heavy cruiser encountered the convoy. &quot;Maiden&quot;, &quot;Trewellard&quot;, and &quot;Kenbame Head&quot; were quickly destroyed, and &quot;Beaverford&quot; and &quot;Fresno City&quot; falling afterwards. Only the sacrifices of the armed merchant cruiser and the freighter &quot;Beaverford&quot; to stall the &quot;Scheer&quot;, in addition to failing light, allowed the rest of the convoy to escape.

The deterrence value of a battleship in protecting a convoy was also dramatically illustrated when the German light battleships (referred by some as battlecruisers) and , mounting guns, came upon an eastbound British convoy (HX 106, with 41 ships) in the North Atlantic on February 8, 1941. When the Germans detected the slow but well-protected battleship escorting the convoy, they fled the scene rather than risk damage from her guns.

The enormous number of vessels involved and the frequency of engagements meant that statistical techniques could be applied to evaluate tactics: an early use of operational research in war.

Prior to overt participation in World War II, the US was actively engaged in convoys with the British in the North Atlantic Ocean, primarily supporting British activities in Iceland.

After Germany declared war on the US, the US Navy decided not to organize convoys on the American eastern seaboard. US Fleet Admiral Ernest King ignored advice on this subject from the British, as he had formed a poor opinion of the Royal Navy early in his career. The result was what the U-boat crews called their Second Happy Time, which did not end until convoys were introduced.

====Pacific====

In the Pacific Theater of World War II, Japanese merchant ships rarely traveled in convoys. Japanese destroyers were generally deficient in antisubmarine weaponry compared to their Allied counterparts, and the Japanese navy did not develop an inexpensive convoy escort like the Allies&#x27; destroyer escort/frigate until it was too late. In the early part of the conflict, American submarines in the Pacific were ineffective as they suffered from timid tactics, faulty torpedoes, and poor deployment, while there were only small numbers of British and Dutch boats. U.S. Admiral Charles A. Lockwood&#x27;s efforts, coupled with strenuous complaints from his captains, rectified these problems and U.S. submarines became much more successful by war&#x27;s end. As a result, the Japanese merchant fleet was largely destroyed by the end of the war. Japanese submarines, unlike their U.S. and German equivalents, focused on U.S. battle fleets rather than merchant convoys, and while they did manage some early successes, sinking two U.S. carriers, they failed to significantly inhibit the invasion convoys carrying troops and equipment in support of the U.S. island-hopping campaign.

Several notable battles in the South Pacific involved Allied bombers interdicting Japanese troopship convoys which were often defended by Japanese fighters, notable Guadalcanal (13 November 1942), Rabaul (5 January 1943), and the Battle of the Bismarck Sea (2–4 March 1943).

At the Battle off Samar, the effectiveness of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s escorts was demonstrated when they managed to defend their troop convoy from a much larger and more powerful Japanese battle-fleet. The Japanese force comprised four battleships and numerous heavy cruisers, while the U.S. force consisted of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts. Large numbers of American aircraft (albeit without much anti-ship ordnance other than torpedoes) and aggressive tactics of the destroyers (with their radar-directed gunfire) allowed the U.S. to sink three Japanese heavy cruisers at the cost of one escort carrier and three destroyers.

====Tactics====

The German anti-convoy tactics included:
* long-range surveillance aircraft to find convoys;
* strings of U-boats (wolfpacks) that could be directed onto a convoy by radio;
* breaking the British naval codes;
* improved anti-ship weapons, including magnetic detonators and sonic homing torpedoes.

The Allied responses included:
* air raids on the U-boat bases at Brest and La Rochelle;
* converted merchant ships, e.g., Merchant aircraft carriers, Catapult Aircraft Merchantman and armed merchant cruisers
* Q-ships, submarine-hunters disguised as unarmed merchant ships to lure submarines into an attack
* more convoy escorts, including cheaply produced yet effective destroyer escorts/frigates (as corvettes were meant as a stopgap), and escort carriers;
* fighter aircraft (carried by escort carriers and merchant aircraft carriers) that would drive off German bombers and attack U-boats
* long-range aircraft patrols to find and attack U-boats;
* improved anti-submarine weapons such as the hedgehog;
* larger convoys, allowing more escorts per convoy as well as the extraction of enough escorts to form hunter-killer support groups that were not attached to a particular convoy
* allocating vessels to convoys according to speed, so that faster ships were less exposed.

They were also aided by
* improved sonar (ASDIC) allowing escort vessels to better track U-boats;
* breaking the German naval cipher;
* improved radar and radio direction finding allowing planes to find and destroy U-boats;
* improved escort anti-submarine tactics developed by the Western Approaches Tactical Unit

* The Battle of the Barents Sea, December 1942
* The Battle of the Bismarck Sea, March 1943

The convoy prefix indicates the route of the convoy. For example, &#x27;PQ&#x27; would be Iceland to Northern Russia and &#x27;QP&#x27; the return route.

===Analysis===
The success of convoys as an anti-submarine tactic during the world wars can be ascribed to several reasons related to U-boat capabilities, the size of the ocean and convoy escorts.

In practice, Type VII and Type IX U-boats were limited in their capabilities. Submerged speed and endurance was limited and not suited for overhauling many ships. Even a surfaced U-boat could take several hours to gain an attack position. Torpedo capacity was also restricted to around fourteen (Type VII) or 24 (Type IX), thus limiting the number of attacks that could be made, particularly when multiple firings were necessary for a single target. There was a real problem for the U-boats and their adversaries in finding each other; with a tiny proportion of the ocean in sight, without intelligence or radar, warships and even aircraft would be fortunate in coming across a submarine. The Royal Navy and later the United States Navy each took time to learn this lesson. Conversely, a U-boat&#x27;s radius of vision was even smaller and had to be supplemented by regular long-range reconnaissance flights.

For both major allied navies, it had been difficult to grasp that, however large a convoy, its &quot;footprint&quot; (the area within which it could be spotted) was far smaller than if the individual ships had traveled independently. In other words, a submarine had less chance of finding a single convoy than if it were scattered as single ships. Moreover, once an attack had been made, the submarine would need to regain an attack position on the convoy. If, however, an attack were thwarted by escorts, even if the submarine had escaped damage, it would have to remain submerged for its own safety and might only recover its position after many hours&#x27; hard work. U-boats patrolling areas with constant and predictable flows of sea traffic, such as the United States Atlantic coast in early 1942, could dismiss a missed opportunity in the certain knowledge that another would soon present itself.

The destruction of submarines required their discovery, an improbable occurrence on aggressive patrols, by chance alone. Convoys, however, presented irresistible targets and could not be ignored. For this reason, the U-boats presented themselves as targets to the escorts with increasing possibility of destruction. In this way, the Ubootwaffe suffered severe losses, for little gain, when pressing pack attacks on well-defended convoys.

===Post-World War II===
The largest convoy effort since World War II was Operation Earnest Will, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s 1987–88 escort of reflagged Kuwaiti tankers in the Persian Gulf during the Iran–Iraq War.

In the present day, convoys are used as a tactic by navies to deter pirates off the coast of Somalia from capturing unarmed civilian freighters who would otherwise pose easy targets if they sailed alone.

==Road convoys==
===Humanitarian aid convoys===
The word &quot;convoy&quot; is also associated with groups of road vehicles being driven, mostly by volunteers, to deliver humanitarian aid, supplies, and—a stated objective in some cases—&quot;solidarity&quot;.

In the 1990s these convoys became common traveling from Western Europe to countries of the former Yugoslavia, in particular Bosnia and Kosovo, to deal with the aftermath of the wars there. They also travel to countries where standards of care in institutions such as orphanages are considered low by Western European standards, such as Romania; and where other disasters have led to problems, such as around the Chernobyl disaster in Belarus and Ukraine.

The convoys are made possible partly by the relatively small geographic distances between the stable and affluent countries of Western Europe, and the areas of need in Eastern Europe and, in a few cases, North Africa and even Iraq. They are often justified because although less directly cost-effective than mass freight transport, they emphasise the support of large numbers of small groups, and are quite distinct from multinational organisations such as United Nations humanitarian efforts.

===Truckers&#x27; convoys===

Truckers&#x27; convoys consisting of semi-trailer trucks and/or petrol tankers are more similar to a caravan than a military convoy.

Truckers&#x27; convoys were created as a byproduct of the U.S.&#x27; national 55 mph speed limit and 18-wheelers becoming the prime targets of speed traps. Most truckers had difficult schedules to keep and as a result had to maintain a speed above the posted speed limit to reach their destinations on time. Convoys were started so that multiple trucks could run together at a high speed with the rationale being that if they passed a speed trap the police would only be able to pull over one of the trucks in the convoy. When driving on a highway, convoys are also useful to conserve fuel by drafting.

The film &quot;Convoy&quot;, inspired by a 1975 song of the same name, explores the camaraderie between truck drivers, where the culture of the CB radio encourages truck drivers to travel in convoys.

Truck convoys are sometimes organized for fundraising, charity, or promotional purposes. They can also be used as a form of protest, such as the Canada convoy protest in 2022.

===Special convoy rights===

The Highway Code of several European countries (Norway, Italy, Greece, Netherlands, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, possibly more) includes special rights for marked convoys. They have to be treated like a single vehicle. If the first vehicle has passed an intersection, all others may do so without interruption. If other road users overtake the convoy, they are not allowed to split into the queue. Clear and uniform marking has been required in court decisions for these rights to apply. Operating such convoy usually needs special permission, but there are exemptions for emergency and catastrophe intervention. Common practice is, to operate with the same style of marking as NATO convoys: STANAG 2154 marking plus country-specific augmentation listed in Annex B to the STANAG.

During the Cold War with its high number of military exercises, the military was the main user of convoy rights. Today, catastrophes like large-scale flooding might bring a high number of flagged convoys to the roads. Large-scale evacuations for the disarming of World War II bombs are another common reason for non-governmental organization (NGO) unit movements under convoy rights.

===Storm convoys===
In Norway, &quot;convoy driving&quot; () is used during winter in case weather is too bad for vehicles to pass on their own. Convoy driving is initiated when the strong wind quickly fills the road with snow behind snowplows, particularly on mountain passes. Only a limited number of vehicles are allowed for each convoy and convoy leader is obliged to decline vehicles not fit for the drive. Storm convoys are prone to multiple-vehicle collision. Convoy driving is used through Hardangervidda pass on road 7 during blizzards. Convoy is sometimes used on road E134 at the highest and most exposed sections during bad weather. On European route E6 through Saltfjellet pass convoy driving is often used when wind speed is over 15–20 m/s (fresh or strong gale) in winter conditions. During the winter of 1990 there was convoy driving for almost 500 hours at Saltfjellet

<doc id="42991" wikidata="Q723435" url="?curid=42991" title="Sugar glider">
<text>The sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) is a small, omnivorous, arboreal, and nocturnal gliding possum. The common name refers to its predilection for sugary foods such as sap and nectar and its ability to glide through the air, much like a flying squirrel. They have very similar habits and appearance to the flying squirrel, despite not being closely related—an example of convergent evolution. The scientific name, &quot;Petaurus breviceps&quot;, translates from Latin as &quot;short-headed rope-dancer&quot;, a reference to their canopy acrobatics.

The sugar glider is characterised by its pair of gliding membranes, known as patagia, which extend from its forelegs to its hindlegs. Gliding serves as an efficient means of reaching food and evading predators. The animal is covered in soft, pale grey to light brown fur which is countershaded, being lighter in colour on its underside.
The sugar glider, as strictly defined in a recent analysis, is only native to a small portion of southeastern Australia, corresponding to southern Queensland and most of New South Wales east of the Great Dividing Range; the extended species group, including populations which may or may not belong to &quot;P. breviceps&quot;, occupies a larger range covering much of coastal eastern and northern Australia, New Guinea, and nearby islands. Members of &quot;Petaurus&quot; are popular exotic pets; these pet animals are also frequently referred to as &quot;sugar gliders&quot;, but recent research indicates, at least for American pets, that they are not &quot;P. breviceps&quot; but a closely related species, ultimately originating from a single source near Sorong in West Papua. This would possibly make them members of the Krefft&#x27;s glider (&quot;P. notatus&quot;), but the taxonomy of Papuan &quot;Petaurus&quot; populations is still poorly resolved.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
The genus &quot;Petaurus&quot; is believed to have originated in New Guinea during the mid Miocene epoch, approximately 18 to 24 million years ago. The modern Australian &quot;Petaurus&quot;, along with New Guinean members of what were formerly considered &quot;P. breviceps&quot;, diverged from their closest living New Guinean relatives ~9-12 mya. They probably dispersed from New Guinea to Australia between 4.8 and ~8.4 mya, with the oldest &quot;Petaurus&quot; fossils in Australia being dated to 4.46 million years. This may have been possible due to sea level lowering from about 7 to 10 mya, resulting in land bridges between New Guinea and Australia.

The taxonomy of the species is complex, and is still not fully resolved. It was formerly understood to have a wide range across Australia and New Guinea, being the only glider to have this distribution, and to be divided into seven subspecies, with three occurring in Australia and four in New Guinea. This traditional subspecific division was based on small morphological differences, such as colour and body size. However, a 2010 genetic analysis using mitochondrial DNA indicates that these morphologically-defined subspecies may not represent genetically unique populations. 

Further studies have found significant genetic variation within populations traditionally classified in &quot;P. breviceps&quot;, sufficient to warrant splitting the species into multiple. The subspecies &quot;P. b. biacensis&quot;, from Biak Island off of New Guinea, was reclassified as a separate species, the Biak glider (&quot;Petaurus biacensis&quot;). In 2020, a landmark study suggested that &quot;P. breviceps&quot; actually comprised three cryptic species: the Krefft&#x27;s glider (&quot;Petaurus notatus&quot;), found throughout most of eastern Australia and introduced to Tasmania, the savanna glider (&quot;Petaurus ariel&quot;), native to northern Australia, and a more narrowly defined &quot;P. breviceps&quot;, restricted to a small section of coastal forest in southern Queensland and most of New South Wales. In addition, other sugar glider populations throughout this range (such as those on New Guinea and the Cape York Peninsula) may represent undescribed species or be conspecific with previously described species. This indicates that contrary to previous findings of a large range (which in fact applied to &quot;P. notatus&quot; and, to a lesser extent, to &quot;P. ariel&quot;), &quot;P. breviceps&quot; is a range-restricted species that is sensitive to ecological disasters, such as the 2019-20 Australian bushfires, which significantly affected large portions of its habitat.

&quot;P. breviceps&quot; and &quot;P. notatus&quot; are estimated to have diverged ~1 million years ago, and may have originated from long term geographic isolation. The early-mid Pleistocene saw an uplifting of the Great Dividing Range, contributing to and coinciding with aridification of the interior of Australia, including on the western side of the range. This, as well as other climactic and geographic factors, may have isolated the ancestors of &quot;P. breviceps&quot; to refugia on the eastern, coastal side of the Great Dividing Range. This would be an example of allopatric speciation.

==Distribution and habitat==
Sugar gliders are distributed in the coastal forests of southeastern Queensland and most of New South Wales. Their distribution extends to altitudes of 2000m in the eastern ranges. In parts of its range, it may overlap with Krefft&#x27;s glider (&quot;P. notatus&quot;).

The sugar glider occurs in sympatry with the squirrel glider and yellow-bellied glider; and their coexistence is permitted through niche partitioning where each species has different patterns of resource use.

Like all arboreal, nocturnal marsupials, sugar gliders are active at night, and they shelter during the day in tree hollows lined with leafy twigs.
The average home range of sugar gliders is , and is largely related to the abundance of food sources; density ranges from two to six individuals per hectare (0.8–2.4 per acre).

Native owls (&quot;Ninox&quot; sp.) are their primary predators; others in their range include kookaburras, goannas, snakes, and quolls. Feral cats (&quot;Felis catus&quot;) also represent a significant threat.

==Appearance and anatomy==

The sugar glider has a squirrel-like body with a long, partially (weakly) prehensile tail. The length from the nose to the tip of the tail is about , and males and females weigh respectively. Heart rate range is 200–300 beats per minute, and respiratory rate is 16–40 breaths per minute. The sugar glider is a sexually dimorphic species, with males typically larger than females. Sexual dimorphism has likely evolved due to increased mate competition arising through social group structure; and is more pronounced in regions of higher latitude, where mate competition is greater due to increased food availability.

The fur coat on the sugar glider is thick, soft, and is usually blue-grey; although some have been known to be yellow, tan or (rarely) albino. A black stripe is seen from its nose to midway on its back. Its belly, throat, and chest are cream in colour. Males have four scent glands, located on the forehead, chest, and two paracloacal (associated with, but not part of the cloaca, which is the common opening for the intestinal, urinal and genital tracts) that are used for marking of group members and territory. Scent glands on the head and chest of males appear as bald spots. Females also have a paracloacal scent gland and a scent gland in the pouch, but do not have scent glands on the chest or forehead.

The sugar glider is nocturnal; its large eyes help it to see at night and its ears swivel to help locate prey in the dark. The eyes are set far apart, allowing more precise triangulation from launching to landing locations while gliding.

Each foot on the sugar glider has five digits, with an opposable toe on each hind foot. These opposable toes are clawless, and bend such that they can touch all the other digits, like a human thumb, allowing it to firmly grasp branches. The second and third digits of the hind foot are partially syndactylous (fused together), forming a grooming comb. The fourth digit of the forefoot is sharp and elongated, aiding in extraction of insects under the bark of trees.

The gliding membrane extends from the outside of the fifth digit of each forefoot to the first digit of each hind foot. When the legs are stretched out, this membrane allows the sugar glider to glide a considerable distance. The membrane is supported by well developed tibiocarpalis, humerodorsalis and tibioabdominalis muscles, and its movement is controlled by these supporting muscles in conjunction with trunk, limb and tail movement.

Lifespan in the wild is up to 9 years; is typically up to 12 years in captivity, and the maximum reported lifespan is 17.8 years.

==Biology and behaviour==
===Gliding===
The sugar glider is one of a number of volplane (gliding) possums in Australia. It glides with the fore- and hind-limbs extended at right angles to the body, with feet flexed upwards. The animal launches itself from a tree, spreading its limbs to expose the gliding membranes. This creates an aerofoil enabling it to glide or more. For every travelled horizontally when gliding, it falls . Steering is controlled by moving limbs and adjusting the tension of the gliding membrane; for example, to turn left, the left forearm is lowered below the right.

This form of arboreal locomotion is typically used to travel from tree to tree; the species rarely descends to the ground. Gliding provides three dimensional avoidance of arboreal predators, and minimal contact with ground dwelling predators; as well as possible benefits in decreasing time and energy consumption spent foraging for nutrient poor foods that are irregularly distributed. Young carried in the pouch of females are protected from landing forces by the septum that separates them within the pouch.

===Torpor===
Sugar gliders can tolerate ambient air temperatures of up to through behavioural strategies such as licking their coat and exposing the wet area, as well as drinking small quantities of water.
In cold weather, sugar gliders will huddle together to avoid heat loss, and will enter torpor to conserve energy. Huddling as an energy conserving mechanism is not as efficient as torpor. Before entering torpor, a sugar glider will reduce activity and body temperature normally in order to lower energy expenditure and avoid torpor. With energetic constraints, the sugar glider will enter into daily torpor for 2–23 hours while in rest phase. 
Torpor differs from hibernation in that torpor is usually a short-term daily cycle. Entering torpor saves energy for the animal by allowing its body temperature to fall to a minimum of to . When food is scarce, as in winter, heat production is lowered in order to reduce energy expenditure. With low energy and heat production, it is important for the sugar glider to peak its body mass by fat content in the autumn (May/June) in order to survive the following cold season. In the wild, sugar gliders enter into daily torpor more often than sugar gliders in captivity. The use of torpor is most frequent during winter, likely in response to low ambient temperature, rainfall, and seasonal fluctuation in food sources.

===Diet and nutrition===

Sugar gliders are seasonally adaptive omnivores with a wide variety of foods in their diet, and mainly forage in the lower layers of the forest canopy. Sugar gliders may obtain up to half their daily water intake through drinking rainwater, with the remainder obtained through water held in its food. In summer they are primarily insectivorous, and in the winter when insects (and other arthropods) are scarce, they are mostly exudativorous (feeding on acacia gum, eucalyptus sap, manna, honeydew or lerp). Sugar gliders have an enlarged caecum to assist in digestion of complex carbohydrates obtained from gum and sap.
To obtain sap or gum from plants, sugar gliders will strip the bark off trees or open bore holes with their teeth to access stored liquid. Little time is spent foraging for insects, as it is an energetically expensive process, and sugar gliders will wait until insects fly into their habitat, or stop to feed on flowers.
Gliders consume approximately 11 g of dry food matter per day. This equates to roughly 8% and 9.5% of body weight for males and females, respectively.

They are opportunistic feeders and can be carnivorous, preying mostly on lizards and small birds. They eat many other foods when available, such as nectar, acacia seeds, bird eggs, pollen, fungi and native fruits. Pollen can make up a large portion of their diet, therefore sugar gliders are likely to be important pollinators of &quot;Banksia&quot; species.

===Reproduction===

Like most marsupials, female sugar gliders have two ovaries and two uteri; they are polyestrous, meaning they can go into heat several times a year. The female has a marsupium (pouch) in the middle of her abdomen to carry offspring. The pouch opens anteriorly, and two lateral pockets extend posteriorly when young are present. Four nipples are usually present in the pouch, although reports of individuals with two nipples have been recorded. Male sugar gliders have two pairs of bulbourethral glands and a bifurcated penis to correspond with the two uteri of females.

The age of sexual maturity in sugar gliders varies slightly between the males and females. Males reach maturity at 4 to 12 months of age, while females require from 8 to 12 months. In the wild, sugar gliders breed once or twice a year depending on the climate and habitat conditions, while they can breed multiple times a year in captivity as a result of consistent living conditions and proper diet.

A sugar glider female gives birth to one (19%) or two (81%) babies (joeys) per litter. The gestation period is 15 to 17 days, after which the tiny joey will crawl into a mother&#x27;s pouch for further development. They are born largely undeveloped and furless, with only the sense of smell being developed. The mother has a scent gland in the external marsupium to attract the sightless joeys from the uterus. Joeys have a continuous arch of cartilage in their shoulder girdle which disappears soon after birth; this supports the forelimbs, assisting the climb into the pouch. Young are completely contained in the pouch for 60 days after birth, wherein mammae provide nourishment during the remainder of development. Eyes first open around 80 days after birth, and young will leave the nest around 110 days after birth. By the time young are weaned, the thermoregulatory system is developed, and in conjunction with a large body size and thicker fur, they are able to regulate their own body temperature.

Breeding is seasonal in southeast Australia, with young only born in winter and spring (June to November). Unlike animals that move along the ground, the sugar glider and other gliding species produce fewer, but heavier, offspring per litter. This allows female sugar gliders to retain the ability to glide when pregnant.

===Socialisation===
Sugar gliders are highly social animals. They live in family groups or colonies consisting of up to seven adults, plus the current season&#x27;s young. Up to four age classes may exist within each group, although some sugar gliders are solitary, not belonging to a group. They engage in social grooming, which in addition to improving hygiene and health, helps bond the colony and establish group identity.

Within social communities, there are two codominant males who suppress subordinate males, but show no aggression towards each other. These co-dominant pairs are more related to each other than to subordinates within the group; and share food, nests, mates, and responsibility for scent marking of community members and territories.

Territory and members of the group are marked with saliva and a scent produced by separate glands on the forehead and chest of male gliders. Intruders who lack the appropriate scent marking are expelled violently. Rank is established through scent marking; and fighting does not occur within groups, but does occur when communities come into contact with each other. Within the colony, no fighting typically takes place beyond threatening behaviour. Each colony defends a territory of about where eucalyptus trees provide a staple food source.

Sugar gliders are one of the few species of mammals that exhibit male parental care. The oldest codominant male in a social community shows a high level of parental care, as he is the probable father of any offspring due to his social status.
This paternal care evolved in sugar gliders as young are more likely to survive when parental investment is provided by both parents. In the sugar glider, biparental care allows one adult to huddle with the young and prevent hypothermia while the other parent is out foraging, as young sugar gliders aren&#x27;t able to thermoregulate until they are 100 days old (3.5 months).

Communication in sugar gliders is achieved through vocalisations, visual signals and complex chemical odours. Chemical odours account for a large part of communication in sugar gliders, similar to many other nocturnal animals. Odours may be used to mark territory, convey health status of an individual, and mark rank of community members. Gliders produce a number of vocalisations including barking and hissing.

=== Conservation ===
Under the prior taxonomy, the sugar glider was not considered endangered, and its conservation rank was &quot;Least Concern (LC)&quot; on the IUCN Red List. However, with newer taxonomic studies indicating that it has a small and restricted range, it is now thought to be far more sensitive to potential threats. For example, the species&#x27; native range was hit hard by the 2019-20 Australian bushfires, which occurred just a few months prior to the publishing of the study indicating the true extent of its range. Sugar gliders use tree hollows, making them especially sensitive to intense fires. However, despite the loss of natural habitat in Australia over the last 200 years, it is adaptable and capable of living in small patches of remnant bush, particularly if it does not have to cross large expanses of cleared land to reach them. Sugar gliders may persist in areas that have undergone mild-moderate selective logging, as long as three to five hollow bearing trees are retained per hectare. Although not currently threatened by habitat loss, the ability of sugar gliders to forage and avoid predators successfully may be decreased in areas of high light pollution.

Conservation in Australia is enacted at the federal, state and local levels, where sugar gliders are protected as a native species. The central conservation law in Australia is the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act). The National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 is an example of conservation law in the state of South Australia, where it is legal to keep (only) one sugar glider without a permit, provided it was acquired legally from a source with a permit. A permit is required to obtain or possess more than one glider, or if one wants to sell or give away any glider in their possession. It is illegal to capture or sell wild sugar gliders without a permit.

===In captivity===

In captivity, the sugar glider can suffer from calcium deficiencies if not fed an adequate diet. A lack of calcium in the diet causes the body to leach calcium from the bones, with the hind legs first to show noticeable dysfunction. Calcium to phosphorus ratios should be 2:1 to prevent hypocalcemia, sometimes known as hind leg paralysis (HLP). Their diet should be 50% insects (gut-loaded) or other sources of protein, 25% fruit and 25% vegetables. Some of the more recognised diets are Bourbon&#x27;s Modified Leadbeaters (BML), High Protein Wombaroo (HPW) and various calcium rich diets with Leadbeaters Mixture (LBM). Iron storage disease (hemochromatosis) is another dietary problem that has been reported in captive gliders and can lead to fatal complications if not diagnosed and treated early.

A large amount of attention and environmental enrichment may be required for the highly social species, especially for those kept as individuals. Inadequate social interaction can lead to depression and behavioural disorders such as loss of appetite, irritability and self-mutilation.
=== As a pet ===
In several countries, the sugar glider (or what was formerly considered to be the sugar glider) is popular as an exotic pet, and is sometimes referred to as a pocket pet. In Australia, there is opposition to keeping native animals as pets from Australia&#x27;s largest wildlife rehabilitation organisation (WIRES), and concerns from Australian wildlife conservation organisations regarding animal welfare risks including neglect, cruelty and abandonment.

In Australia, sugar gliders can be kept in Victoria, South Australia, and the Northern Territory. However, they are not allowed to be kept as pets in Western Australia, New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory, Queensland or Tasmania.

DNA analysis indicates that &quot;the USA (sugar) glider population originates from West Papua, Indonesia with no illegal harvesting from other native areas such as Papua New Guinea or Australia&quot;. Given that the West Papuan gliders have been tentatively classified as Krefft&#x27;s gliders (albeit to be changed in the future), this indicates that at least the captive gliders kept in the United States are Krefft&#x27;s gliders, not sugar gliders.

<text>Back to the Future is a 1985 American science fiction film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Zemeckis and Bob Gale. It stars Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, Lea Thompson, Crispin Glover, and Thomas F. Wilson. Set in 1985, it follows Marty McFly (Fox), a teenager accidentally sent back to 1955 in a time-traveling DeLorean automobile built by his eccentric scientist friend Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown (Lloyd), where he inadvertently prevents his future parents from falling in lovethreatening his own existenceand is forced to reconcile them and somehow get back to the future.

Gale and Zemeckis conceived the idea for &quot;Back to the Future&quot; in 1980. They were desperate for a successful film after numerous collaborative failures, but the project was rejected more than forty times by various studios because it was not considered raunchy enough to compete with the successful comedies of the era. A development deal was secured with Universal Pictures following Zemeckis&#x27;s success directing &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984). Fox was the first choice to portray Marty but was unavailable; Eric Stoltz was cast instead. Shortly after principal photography began in November 1984, Zemeckis determined Stoltz was not right for the part and made the concessions necessary to hire Fox, including re-filming scenes already shot with Stoltz and adding $4million to the budget. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was filmed in and around California and on sets at Universal Studios, and concluded the following April.

After highly successful test screenings, the release date was brought forward to July3, 1985, giving the film more time in theaters during the busiest period of the theatrical year. The change resulted in a rushed post-production schedule and some incomplete special effects. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was a critical and commercial success, earning $381.1million to become the highest-grossing film of 1985 worldwide. Critics praised the story, humor, and the cast, particularly Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. It received multiple award nominations and won an Academy Award, three Saturn Awards, and a Hugo Award. Its theme song, &quot;The Power of Love&quot; by Huey Lewis and the News, was also a success.

&quot;Back to the Future&quot; has since grown in esteem and is now considered by critics and audiences to be one of the greatest science fiction films and among the best films ever made. In 2007, the United States Library of Congress selected it for preservation in the National Film Registry. The film was followed by two sequels, &quot;Back to the Future Part II&quot; (1989) and &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; (1990). Spurred by the film&#x27;s dedicated fan following and effect on popular culture, Universal Studios launched a multimedia franchise, which now includes video games, theme park rides, an animated television series, and a stage musical. Its enduring popularity has prompted numerous books about its production, documentaries, and commercials.

==Plot==

In 1985, teenager Marty McFly lives in Hill Valley, California, with his depressed alcoholic mother, Lorraine; his older siblings, who are professional and social failures; and his meek father, George, who is bullied by his supervisor, Biff Tannen. After Marty&#x27;s band fails a music audition, he confides in his girlfriend, Jennifer Parker, that he fears becoming like his parents despite his ambitions.

That night, Marty meets his eccentric scientist friend, Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown, in the Twin Pines mall parking lot. Doc unveils a time machine built from a modified DeLorean, powered by plutonium he swindled from Libyan terrorists. After Doc inputs a destination time of November 5, 1955 (the day he first conceived his time travel invention), the terrorists arrive unexpectedly and gun him down. Marty flees in the DeLorean, inadvertently activating time travel when he reaches .

Arriving in 1955, Marty discovers he has no plutonium, so he cannot return to 1985. While exploring a burgeoning Hill Valley, Marty encounters his teenage father and discovers Biff was bullying George even then. George falls into the path of an oncoming car while spying on the teenage Lorraine changing clothes, and Marty is knocked unconscious while saving him. He wakes to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who becomes infatuated with him. Marty tracks down and convinces a younger Doc that he is from the future, but Doc explains the only source available in 1955 capable of generating the 1.21 gigawatts of power required for time travel is a lightning bolt. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that documents an upcoming lightning strike at the town&#x27;s courthouse. As Marty&#x27;s siblings begin to fade from a photo he carries with him, Doc realizes Marty&#x27;s actions are altering the future and jeopardizing his existence; Lorraine was supposed to tend to George instead of Marty after the car accident. Early attempts to get his parents acquainted fail, and Lorraine&#x27;s infatuation with Marty deepens.

Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, and he plots to feign inappropriate advances on her, allowing George to intervene and rescue her, but the plan goes awry when Biff&#x27;s gang locks Marty in the trunk of the performing band&#x27;s car, while Biff forces himself onto Lorraine. George arrives expecting to find Marty but is assaulted by Biff. After Biff hurts Lorraine, an enraged George knocks him unconscious and escorts the grateful Lorraine to the dance. The band frees Marty from their car, but the lead guitarist injures his hand in the process, so Marty takes his place, performing while George and Lorraine share their first kiss. With his future no longer in jeopardy, Marty hurries to the courthouse to meet Doc.

Doc discovers a letter from Marty warning him about his future and rips it, worried about the consequences. To save Doc, Marty recalibrates the DeLorean to return ten minutes before he had left the future. The lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985, but the DeLorean breaks down, forcing Marty to run back to the mall. He arrives as Doc is being shot. While Marty grieves at his side, Doc sits up, revealing he had pieced Marty&#x27;s note back together and wore a bulletproof vest. He takes Marty home and departs to 2015 in the DeLorean. Marty wakes the next morning to discover his father is now a confident and successful science fiction author, his mother is fit and happy, his siblings are successful, and Biff is a servile valet in George&#x27;s employ. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, Doc suddenly reappears in the DeLorean, insisting they return with him to the future to save their children from terrible fates.

==Production==
===Conception and writing===
Long-time collaborators Bob Gale and Robert Zemeckis conceived &quot;Back to the Future&quot; in 1980. They wanted to develop a film about time travel but struggled to create a satisfying narrative, and were desperate for a successful project after the critical or commercial failures of their recent efforts in collaboration with Zemeckis&#x27;s mentor, Steven Spielberg.

Following the release of their comedy &quot;Used Cars&quot; (1980), Gale visited his parents and came across his father&#x27;s high school yearbook. He wondered if he and his father would have been friends had they attended school together. He did not think so, but realized he could test his theory if he could travel back to a time when he and his parents were a similar age. He shared the idea with Zemeckis, who recalled his mother&#x27;s childhood stories were often contradictory.

Gale and Zemeckis began a draft in late 1980. They sketched and acted out each scene to help develop the dialogue and actions. They believed many time-travel films focused on the past being immutable and wanted to show the past being altered and the effect those changes would have on the future. In the draft, video pirate Professor Brown builds a time machine that sends his young friend Marty back to the 1950s where he interrupts his parents&#x27; first meeting. In September 1980, Gale and Zemeckis pitched their idea to Columbia Pictures president Frank Price, who had liked &quot;Used Cars&quot; and was keen to work with the pair. Gale recalled having to rein in Zemeckis&#x27;s enthusiastic pitch before Price had time to change his mind. Gale and Zemeckis completed the first draft for Price on February21, 1981, but Price believed it needed significant refinement.

Some early concepts were abandoned. Originally, Marty&#x27;s actions in 1955 had a more significant impact on the future, making 1985 more futuristic and advanced, but every person who read the script took issue with the idea. Marty&#x27;s father also became a boxer, a result of his knockout punch on Biff. The time machine was a stationary object moved around on the back of a truck. Inspired by the documentary &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot;, the drained time machine was written to be powered by Marty driving it into a nuclear explosion, combined with an additional ingredient: Coca-Cola. Gale and Zemeckis took inspiration from tales of legendary scientists, opting to make the time machine&#x27;s creator an individual instead of a faceless corporation or government. The pair wanted the inciting time-travel incident to be an accident so that it would not appear that the hero was seeking personal gain.

Gale and Zemeckis drew humor from the cultural contrasts between 1955 and 1985, such as Marty entering a 1955 soda shop in 1985 clothing; the shop owner asks Marty if he is a sailor because his down vest resembles a life preserver. They also identified conveniences of 1985 that Marty had taken for granted, but would be denied in 1955. Gale and Zemeckis struggled with the writing, as they were in their 30s and did not particularly identify with either era. They were inspired by the All-American aesthetic of films by Frank Capra featuring white picket fences and exaggerated characters similar to Biff, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, science fiction films, and books by Robert Silverberg and Robert Heinlein. The romantic relationship between 1955 Lorraine and her future son was one of the more difficult writing challenges. Gale and Zemeckis attempted to take the concept as far as possible to keep the audience on edge. They believed it had to be Lorraine who stopped the relationship; she remarks that kissing Marty feels like kissing her brother. Gale jokingly said no one asked how she could make that comparison, but that audiences would accept it because they did not want the relationship to happen. The second draft was completed by April7, 1981.

===Development===
Price opted not to green-light the second draft; although he liked it, he did not believe it would appeal to anyone else. The most successful comedies at the time, such as &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978), &quot;Porky&#x27;s&quot; (1981), and &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot; (1982), featured sexual and bawdy elements; &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was considered too tame in comparison. The project went into turnaround (a process allowing other studios to purchase the idea). The script was rejected some forty times, sometimes multiple times by the same studios. Reasons given included the concept being unappealing to contemporary rebellious youth and the failures of other time travel films, such as &quot;The Final Countdown&quot; (1980) and &quot;Time Bandits&quot; (1981). Walt Disney Productions turned it down because they considered Marty&#x27;s fighting off his future mother&#x27;s advances too risqué for their brand. The only supporter of the project was Spielberg, but with their previous collaborations considered relative failures, Gale and Zemeckis feared another misstep would suggest they could get work only through being friends with Spielberg.

Zemeckis accepted the next project offered to him, &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot; (1984). Against expectations, the film was a significant success and gave Zemeckis enough credibility to return to &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Zemeckis held a grudge against the studios that had rejected the project and turned to Spielberg, who had set up his own production company, Amblin Entertainment, at Universal Studios, where Price now worked. Spielberg disliked Price because he had rejected &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) and demanded his involvement in &quot;Back to the Future&quot; be minimal. Sidney Sheinberg installed himself as chief executive to oversee the studio&#x27;s investment in the project. Amblin executives Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall joined Spielberg as the film&#x27;s executive producers.

However, rights to &quot;Back to the Future&quot; remained with Columbia Pictures. Price&#x27;s successor at Columbia Pictures, Guy McElwaine, was developing a satire of the Universal-owned noir film &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944) called &quot;Big Trouble&quot; (1986). Its similarities to &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; meant the studio would violate Universal Pictures&#x27; copyright. With production imminent, McElwaine asked for the rights from Price; in exchange, Price obtained the rights to &quot;Back to the Future&quot;.

Sheinberg suggested modifications to the film, including changing the title to &quot;Space Man from Pluto&quot;, believing &quot;Back to the Future&quot; would not resonate with audiences. Gale and Zemeckis did not know how to reject Sheinberg&#x27;s suggestions without risking his ire. Spielberg intervened, sending Sheinberg a memo reading: &quot;Hi Sid, thanks for your most humorous memo, we all got a big laugh out of it, keep &#x27;em coming.&quot; Spielberg knew Sheinberg would be too embarrassed to admit his memo was to be taken seriously. Sheinberg later claimed the story was &quot;bullshit&quot;. Sheinberg also wanted to change the name of Marty&#x27;s mother from Meg to Lorraine (a tribute to his wife Lorraine Gary), and rename Professor Brown to Doc Brown because he considered it more accessible. The third draft was completed by July 1984. The lengthy development allowed Gale and Zemeckis to refine the script&#x27;s jokes, especially ones that had become dated since 1980. The joke about former actor Ronald Reagan becoming President of the United States remained following his re-election in 1984.

===Casting===
Michael J. Fox was the first choice to portray Marty McFly. Gale and Zemeckis believed his acting timing in the NBC sitcom &quot;Family Ties&quot; (1982–1989) as the sophisticated Alex P. Keaton could be translated to Marty&#x27;s clumsiness. Spielberg asked the show&#x27;s producer Gary David Goldberg to have Fox read the script. Concerned Fox&#x27;s absence would damage &quot;Family Ties&quot;″ success, especially with fellow star Meredith Baxter on maternity leave, Goldberg did not give Fox the script. Other young stars were considered, including: John Cusack, C. Thomas Howell, Johnny Depp, Ralph Macchio, Charlie Sheen, Jon Cryer, Ben Stiller, Peter DeLuise, Billy Zane, George Newbern, Robert Downey Jr., Christopher Collet, Matthew Modine, and Corey Hart (who declined to audition). Howell was the frontrunner, but Sheinberg preferred Eric Stoltz, who had impressed with his portrayal of Rocky Dennis in an early screening of the drama film &quot;Mask&quot; (1985). With the filming date approaching, Zemeckis opted for Stoltz. Sheinberg promised that if Stoltz did not work out, they could reshoot the film. The character&#x27;s name was derived from &quot;Used Cars&quot; production assistant Marty Casella. Zemeckis suggested McFly because it sounded &quot;All-American&quot;.

Among others, Jeff Goldblum, John Lithgow, Dudley Moore, Ron Silver, Robin Williams, John Cleese, Mandy Patinkin, Gene Hackman, James Woods, and Mark Mothersbaugh were considered for the role of Doc Brown. Producer Neil Canton suggested Lithgow, having worked with him and Christopher Lloyd on &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot; (1984). Lithgow was unavailable, and the role was offered to Lloyd. He was reluctant to join the production until a friend encouraged him to take the part. Albert Einstein and conductor Leopold Stokowski inspired Lloyd&#x27;s wild, white hair. Lloyd affected a hunched posture to lower his height closer to the tall Fox.

The filmmakers became aware of Lea Thompson while researching Stoltz in the comedy-drama &quot;The Wild Life&quot; (1984). Crispin Glover used many of his own mannerisms in portraying George McFly. Gale described his performance as &quot;nuts&quot;, and Zemeckis was reportedly unhappy with Glover&#x27;s performance choices, instructing him to be more restrained as the older George. Glover lost his voice during filming and later dubbed in some lines. Deluise, Zane, Tim Robbins, and J.J. Cohen were considered to play Biff Tannen. Cohen was not considered intimidating enough against Stoltz, and the role went to ThomasF. Wilson, his first feature starring role. Zane and Cohen were cast as Biff&#x27;s minions Match and Skinhead instead. Tannen&#x27;s name was taken from Universal Studios executive Ned Tanen, who had been unpleasant with Gale and Zemeckis.

Melora Hardin was cast as Jennifer Parker on a two-film contract. After Stoltz&#x27;s replacement, the crew were polled about Hardin being taller than Fox; the female crew overwhelmingly voted Marty should not be shorter than his girlfriend. Hardin was replaced by Claudia Wells, who had previously declined the role because of her commitment to the short-lived television series &quot;Off the Rack&quot; (1984). Actresses Kyra Sedgwick and Jill Schoelen were also considered; Schoelen was told she looked too &quot;exotic&quot; and not sufficiently All-American. Doc Brown&#x27;s pet, a dog named Einstein, was originally scripted as a chimpanzee named Shemp. Sheinberg insisted films featuring chimps never did well. James Tolkan was the first choice for Principal Strickland after Zemeckis saw him in the crime drama &quot;Prince of the City&quot; (1981). Singer and soundtrack contributor Huey Lewis cameos as a Battle of the Bands judge. Lewis agreed to appear as long as he was uncredited and could wear a disguise. Gale cameos as the hand in the radiation suit tapping the DeLorean time display.

===Filming with Stoltz===
Principal photography began on November26, 1984, on a 14-week schedule set to conclude on February28, 1985, with an estimated $14million budget. Filming took place mainly at the Universal Studios lot and on location in California. Dean Cundey served as the cinematographer; he and Zemeckis had collaborated on &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. Editor Arthur Schmidt was hired after Zemeckis saw his work on &quot;Firstborn&quot; (1984); Schmidt recommended hiring Harry Keramidas as co-editor. Frank Marshall also served as a second unit director.

Owing to the tight schedule, editing occurred concurrently with filming. On December30, 1984, Zemeckis reviewed the existing scenes with Schmidt and Keramidas. Zemeckis was reluctant to review the footage because he would be self-critical, but he believed Stoltz&#x27;s acting was not working and had already listed several scenes he wanted to reshoot. Zemeckis called in Gale and the producers to show them the footage; they agreed Stoltz was not right for the part. Stoltz was performing the role with an intense and serious tone, not the &quot;screwball&quot; energy they desired. Gale characterized Stoltz as a good actor in the wrong role.

Stoltz utilized method acting and stayed in character as Marty when not filming, refusing to answer to his own name. This resulted in feuding with some of the cast and crew, including Wilson. Stoltz put his full strength into pushing Wilson rather than imitating doing so, despite Wilson&#x27;s protests. Spielberg said Zemeckis needed a replacement in place before firing Stoltz, or he risked the production being canceled. Zemeckis and the producers asked Sheinberg for permission to do whatever was necessary to accommodate Fox&#x27;s participation; Spielberg made another call to Goldberg. On January3, 1985, Goldberg told Fox about withholding the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; script from him, and the filmmakers wanted to know if he was interested. Baxter had returned to the show, and they could be more flexible with Fox as long as &quot;Family Ties&quot; took priority. Fox agreed to join without reading the script. The transition could not take place immediately and filming continued with Stoltz in the lead role, unaware he was to be replaced.

On January 10, 1985, Zemeckis informed Stoltz that he was being fired. Zemeckis described it as &quot;the hardest meeting I&#x27;ve ever had in my life and it was all my fault. I broke [Stoltz&#x27;s] heart.&quot; Stoltz was reported to have told his makeup artist he was not a comedian and did not understand why he was cast. The producers informed the principal cast and the rest of the crew much of the film would be re-shot. Cundey said most of the crew saw Stoltz&#x27;s removal as &quot;good news&quot;. Crew members later said there were obvious signs Stoltz would be replaced; the set designers were told to not change the 1955 set, and a scene involving a discussion between Marty and Doc was filmed showing only Doc. Stoltz had shot numerous key scenes including Marty traveling to 1955 in the DeLorean, its breaking down as he prepares to return to 1985, and his final scene was Marty&#x27;s return to 1985. Filming fell behind schedule, with 34days of filming lost and an additional cost of $3.5–$4.0million, including Stoltz receiving his salary in full. Universal Pictures&#x27; marketing team was tasked with mitigating the negative publicity from a project replacing its main star.

===Filming with Fox===

Fox&#x27;s first day on set was January15, 1985. He filmed &quot;Family Ties&quot; during the day before traveling to the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; filming location. Often, he would not return home until early the following morning, and on weekends, the schedule was pushed back further as &quot;Family Ties&quot; was filmed in front of a live audience. The teamster drivers entrusted with dropping off Fox at home often had to carry the actor to bed. This continued until April, when &quot;Family Ties&quot; finished filming. Gale said Fox&#x27;s youth meant he could cope with less sleep than usual; Fox described it as exhausting, but worth the effort. Further into the filming schedule, Fox was energetic during his scenes but struggled to stay awake off set. He ad-libbed some lines when he forgot the intended dialogue, and recalled looking for a camcorder on the &quot;Family Ties&quot; set, before realizing it was a prop on &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. He also had to learn to mimic playing the guitar and choreographed skateboarding routines taught by Per Welinder and Bob Schmelzer.

To compensate for his conflicting schedules and reduce production costs, some scenes involving Marty were shot without Fox, who filmed his part separately. Re-shooting scenes allowed the filmmakers to identify problems and implement new ideas. To avoid building an additional classroom set, the opening pan across the array of clocks in Doc Brown&#x27;s laboratory replaced an opening scene where Marty sets off a fire alarm to get out of detention. The height differences between Stoltz and Fox necessitated other changes, such as a scene of Fox teaching George how to punch because Fox could not reach the necessary prop. According to Gale, once Fox replaced Stoltz, the atmosphere on set improved. Thompson anecdotally said while Stoltz ate lunch alone in his trailer, Fox ate lunch with the cast and crew.

The production used many locations in and around Los Angeles. The clock tower is a structure on the Universal Studios Lot in Universal City, California. When filmed from below, Lloyd was positioned on a recreation of the clock tower, but when filmed from above, Lloyd stood atop the tower itself. Production designer Lawrence G. Paull insisted on using the Universal backlot sets because of the difficulties and costs involved in making an on-location area look 1955-appropriate. Whittier High School in the city of Whittier is the Hill Valley high school. Marty&#x27;s home and the surrounding Lyon estates are in Arleta, Los Angeles. Several of the residential locations were filmed in Pasadena: Lorraine&#x27;s and George&#x27;s 1955 homes, and Doc Brown&#x27;s 1955 home. (Its exterior is the Gamble House; interiors were shot at the historic Blacker House.) Puente Hills Mall in City of Industry, California serves as the Twin Pines mall, which later becomes the Lone Pine mall after Marty knocks over one of the trees at Twin Pines ranch in 1955, which was filmed at the Walt Disney Studios-owned Golden Oak Ranch in Newhall, Santa Clarita, California. Other locations include the basement of the Hollywood United Methodist Church where the school dance was filmed, and Griffith Park, where Marty begins his drive to the courthouse to return to 1985, passing by a lamp post outside the Greek Theatre.

Filming concluded after 107 days on April26, 1985. The final day of filming included pick-up shots of Marty and Einstein the dog in the DeLorean.

===Post-production===
Arthur F. Repola served as the post-production supervisor, but he became responsible for many aspects outside his role, including budgets, storyboarding, and general problem-solving. Those roles belonged to Kennedy and Marshall, but both were occupied on other films. Schmidt found editing the film difficult because he had to imagine where the special effects would later be added; there was no time or budget to re-edit afterward.

A rough version of the movie was cut together for a test screening at the Century 22 theater in San Jose, California, in mid-May 1985, just three weeks after filming concluded. The audience was seemingly uninterested at the exposition-heavy opening but became engaged after the DeLorean appeared. At a test screening in Long Beach, California, 94% of the audience responded they would recommend the film; 99% rated it very good or excellent. Gale said there was some concern when Doc&#x27;s dog Einstein was sent through time, as the audience believed he had been killed. The film was re-cut and screened again at the Alfred Hitchcock theater at Universal Studios for executives, including Sheinberg. He was so impressed he moved the scheduled release date forward to July3, 1985, to give it more time in theaters during the peak summer season. The new date reduced the post-production schedule to just nine weeks for special effects and editing. Zemeckis spent much of June rushing to finish the film.

Deleted scenes include: Doc looking at an issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;, remarking the future looks better; a scene of 1985 George being coerced into buying a large amount of peanut brittle from a young girl; a scene of young George trapped in a phone booth by the man who interrupts his dance with Lorraine; and the scene of Marty pretending to be &quot;Darth Vader&quot;, which was shortened. Zemeckis considered cutting the &quot;JohnnyB. Goode&quot; performance because it did not advance the story, but test audiences reacted well to it. There is a dispute if a shot of Stoltz&#x27;s hand is in the finished film in the scene where Marty punches Biff. Gale noted it is impossible to tell without checking the original film negative, which would risk damaging it. The final 116minute cut was completed on June 23, 1985. Universal Studios took out a full-page advertisement in &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, thanking the post-production crew for completing their work on time. The final budget was $19million.

===Music===


Alan Silvestri composed the score for &quot;Back to the Future&quot;; he had worked with Zemeckis on &quot;Romancing the Stone&quot;. The only direction Zemeckis gave him was &quot;it&#x27;s got to be big&quot;. Silvestri used an orchestral score to create a sound that contrasted with the small-town setting and the significant time-changing events occurring within it. He wanted a heroic theme that would be instantly recognizable.

Huey Lewis was approached to write a theme song for the film; he was coming off the success of his recent album &quot;Sports&quot;. He met with Gale, Spielberg, and Zemeckis, who intended that Huey Lewis and the News be Marty&#x27;s favorite band. Though flattered, Lewis did not want to participate because he did not know how to write film songs and did not want to write one called &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. Zemeckis assured Lewis he could write any song he wanted. Lewis agreed to submit the next song he wrote, which was &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. Lewis maintains &quot;Power of Love&quot; was his first submission, but Zemeckis recalled a different first song that was rejected. Lewis later acquiesced to Zemeckis&#x27;s request for a second song, &quot;Back in Time&quot;.

Musician Eddie Van Halen performed the guitar riff Marty (dressed as &quot;Darth Vader&quot;) uses to wake George. The filmmakers wanted to use Van Halen&#x27;s music, but the band refused to take part, so Eddie took part on his own. Mark Campbell provided Marty&#x27;s singing voice, but did not receive credit, as the filmmakers wanted to pretend Fox was singing. When music supervisor Bones Howe learned of this, he secured Campbell a small percentage of the soundtrack revenue as compensation. Paul Hanson taught Fox how to use a guitar to play &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot;, and choreographer Brad Jeffries spent four weeks teaching Fox to replicate various rock star moves popularized by artists like Pete Townshend, Jimi Hendrix, and Chuck Berry. Berry withheld permission to use &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; until the day before filming, receiving $50,000 for the rights. Harry WatersJr. provided the vocals on &quot;Earth Angel&quot;.

==Design==
===Special effects===
Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) developed the film&#x27;s special effects under the supervision of Ken Ralston and Kevin Pike. It contains approximately 27–32 special effects shots, compared to the 300 such shots typical in contemporaneous higher-budget films. Despite working simultaneously on &quot;The Goonies&quot; and &quot;Cocoon&quot;, Ralston took on the additional project because it required relatively few effects, and he wanted to realize the planned ending of Marty driving the time machine into a nuclear explosion. The team had a nine-and-a-half-week schedule, reduced to less than nine once Universal Pictures moved up the release date. ILM was working on &quot;Back to the Future&quot; up to the moment it had to be handed over to print the theatrical film reels.

The tight schedule affected the special effects&#x27; quality. Ralston was disappointed by the scene where Marty&#x27;s hand fades away as his future is altered. Fox was filmed separately from his hand and the two were composited together; the hand was filmed with a wide-angle lens, making it appear too large, and it had to be scaled down. Zemeckis wanted a subtle fade, but it resulted in a small circle of the hand fading away and there was no time to fix it. In the same scene, Marty and his siblings fade away from a photo. ILM found it difficult to fade the photo&#x27;s individual aspects, especially as it was moving on the neck of a guitar. A replica of the guitar neck was constructed at four times the normal size; the guitar strings were made of cable up to a quarter-inch thick. An 11-by-14 aluminum plate was attached to hold the enlarged photograph. ILM used a version of the photo without Marty or his siblings and individually pasted each character into the photo. When this failed, four different photos were used: one containing the background, and one for each McFly sibling. A mechanical camera cycled through each photo and printed it to the film. The enlarged guitar was moved around to add to the realism.

The original nuclear explosion ending was considered too complicated and expensive, with an estimated cost of $1million. Art director Andrew Probert storyboarded the scene, which would have been created using sets and miniatures. With the ending moved to the clock tower, ILM researched storms to achieve the right aesthetic. Clouds were constructed from polyester fiberfill, suspended in a net, and filmed from above while Ralston shone a powerful light from below. He used a rheostat to rapidly change the lights&#x27; intensity to imitate lightning.

Developed by Wes Takahashi&#x27;s animation department, the lightning bolt that strikes the clock tower was described as &quot;the largest bolt of lightning in cinematic history&quot;. It was intended to originate in the distance and move closer, but the footage was filmed too close to the tower and there was insufficient space between it and the top of the frame. There was also an issue with showing the bolt onscreen for too long as it made it more obviously animated. The frame count was reduced, but the bolt did not look chaotic enough. Zemeckis picked out a single frame of the bolt in an &quot;S&quot;formation and asked that the effect focus on that shape and be reduced to twenty frames. The bolt was drawn in black ink on white paper; diffusion effects and a glow were added by the optical department.

===The DeLorean time machine===

The DeLorean was developed under the supervision of Lawrence Paull, who designed it with artist Ron Cobb and illustrator Andrew Probert. They intended for the vehicle to look fixed together from common parts. The time machine was originally conceived as a stationary device; at one point it was a refrigerator. Spielberg vetoed the idea, concerned child viewers might attempt to climb into one. Zemeckis suggested the DeLorean because it offered mobility and a unique design; the gull-wing doors would appear like an alien UFO to a 1950s family. The Ford Motor Company offered $75,000 to use a Ford Mustang instead; Gale responded, &quot;Doc Brown doesn&#x27;t drive a fucking Mustang&quot;. Michael Fink was hired as the art department liaison and tasked with realizing Cobb&#x27;s sketches and overseeing the car&#x27;s construction. He was recruited by Paull and Canton, who had worked with him on &quot;Blade Runner&quot; (1982) and &quot;Buckaroo Banzai&quot;, respectively. Fink had a project lined up but agreed to help in the free weeks he had remaining. Three DeLoreans used were purchased from a collector: one for stunts, one for special effects, and a more detailed hero version for close-up shots. They were unreliable and often broke down. was chosen as the time travel speed because it was easy to remember and looked &quot;cool&quot; on the speedometer.

The flying DeLorean in the final scene used a combination of live-action footage, animation, and a 1:5 scale (approximately long) model built by Steve Gawley and the model shop crew. The act of the DeLorean traveling through time was called the &#x27;time slice&#x27; effect. Zemeckis knew only that he wanted the transition to be violent. He described it as a &quot;Neanderthal sitting on the hood of the DeLorean and chipping away the fabric of time in front of him&quot;. The effect is so quick as to be imperceptible. Zemeckis preferred this, as he did not want the audience to think too much about how everything worked.

===Art direction and makeup===
Actual brand names, such as Texaco, were used to make the sets more realistic, and the producers mandated the inclusion of certain brands that had paid to appear in the film. An unidentified gas company offered a large sum to be included, but Paull used Texaco because it reminded him of a joke from &quot;The Milton Berle Show&quot;. This choice led to some disputes, such as Pepsi parent company, PepsiCo, wanting to omit a joke about the Tab drink made by its rival Coca-Cola. Twenty clock wranglers were needed to synch up the many clocks in the opening scene, and pulleys were used to start them simultaneously. Drew Struzan produced the film&#x27;s poster. The producers hoped his in-demand poster artwork would generate further interest in the film.

The film uses a stylized adaptation of the 1950s aesthetics, closer to television show interpretations than an exact recreation. Modern technologies such as contemporary fabrics were used because the designers believed the fashions of the time were not interesting. To represent characters across three decades, the filmmakers did not want to have older actors stand in for the younger ones, believing the change would be obvious and distracting. Special effects artist Ken Chase performed makeup tests on the young actors to age them; initial results were discouraging. He created a prosthetic neck and a bald cap with a receding hairline for Glover but considered them excessive. Chase found it difficult to balance aging the actors and retaining enough of their natural appearance to remain recognizable.

Casts were made of the actors&#x27; faces, from which plaster molds were made. Chase sculpted more subtle effects over the plaster molds using latex. For Lorraine, he crafted jowls and eye bags, plus body padding to reflect her increased weight and alcohol abuse. Instead of a receding hairline, Chase changed the style of George&#x27;s hair; he used prosthetics only to give him a less-defined jawline. Biff&#x27;s character changed more significantly because Chase wanted him to look &quot;obnoxious&quot;; he was fattened, given sideburns, and a comb over hairstyle to hide a growing bald spot. The prosthetics were combined with makeup and lighting to further age the characters.

Chase found the work frustrating compared to his experiences with more fantastical prostheses that made it easier to hide defects. The rubber latex did not reflect light the same way as natural skin, so Chase used a stippling process (creating a pattern with small dots) to variegate the actors&#x27; faces to better conceal where the skin and prosthetics met; close-up shots were avoided. Doc&#x27;s appearance was not altered significantly. Chase painted latex on Lloyd which, when removed, caused crinkles in the skin, onto which other elements, such as liver spots and shadows, were painted.
==Release==
===Context===

By June 1985, the theatrical industry had experienced a 14% decline in ticket sales over the previous year&#x27;s $4billion record sales. The summer period (beginning the final week of May) had 45films scheduled for release, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Goonies&quot;, &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;, &quot;Fletch&quot;, and the latest James Bond film &quot;A View to a Kill&quot;. This 25% increase over the previous year&#x27;s releases led to concerns among industry professionals the competition would divide audiences and limit financial returns, at a time when the average cost of making and marketing a film had increased to $14.5million and $7million, respectively. A higher budget to secure a popular, and thus profitable, cast was considered a suitable risk. Most films scheduled for release were aimed at younger audiences, focusing on fantasy and the supernatural. Reflecting the times, these fantasy elements often employed a technological source instead of a magical one. Only a few films, like &quot;Cocoon&quot; and &quot;Prizzi&#x27;s Honor&quot;, targeted adults.

Initially, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was scheduled to be released in May 1985, but was pushed back to June21, the earliest Zemeckis could have the film ready. The delay caused by Stoltz&#x27;s replacement pushed the release back to July19, and later to August. Sheinberg moved the release date forward to July3, giving it an extra sixteen days of theatrical screen time during the industry&#x27;s most profitable period of the year. The move offered about 100,000 extra screenings, together worth an estimated $40million. He said he also wanted to avoid the negative perception of films released later in the summer period; other blockbuster films were usually released early. The change required renegotiations with theater owners to secure screens in an already-crowded marketplace. In some cities, it was legally required that exhibitors be shown a film before purchase; an unfinished cut of the film was shown to theater owners and young test audiences. They described it as lesser than &quot;E.T.the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; or &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, but still a guaranteed box office hit. Fox was unavailable for promotional work because he was filming &quot;Family Ties Vacation&quot; (1985) in London.

===Box office===
In the United States (U.S.) and Canada, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; received a wide release on July3, 1985, ahead of the Independence Day holiday weekend. The film earned $3.6million during the opening Wednesday and Thursday, and a further $11.3million during its inaugural weekend from 1,420 theatersan average of $7,853 per theater. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; finished as the number one film of the weekend ahead of Western &quot;Pale Rider&quot; ($7million), in its second weekend, and &quot;Rambo: First Blood PartII&quot; ($6.4million) in its seventh. It retained the number one position in its second weekend with a further gross of $10.6million, ahead of the debuting action film &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; ($7.8million) and &quot;Cocoon&quot; ($5million), and in its third weekend, ahead of the re-release of &quot;E.T.the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; ($8.8million) and &quot;Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome&quot; ($5.4million). Although it fell to number two in its fourth weekend, behind the debuting &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot; ($12.3million), &quot;Back to the Future&quot; regained the number one position in its fifth weekend and remained there for the following eight weeks. Recalling the opening weeks, Gale said, &quot;our second weekend was higher than our first weekend, which is indicative of great word of mouth.&quot;

The film remained a steady success, earning $155million by October, surpassing &quot;Rambo: First Blood PartII&quot;″s $149million box office earnings to become the year&#x27;s highest-grossing film. In total, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was the number one film for eleven of its twelve first weeks and remained in the top ten highest-grossing films for a total of twenty-four. By the end of its theatrical run, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; earned an approximate box office gross of $210.6million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1985, ahead of &quot;Rambo: First Blood PartII&quot; ($150.4million), the sports drama &quot;Rocky IV&quot; ($127.9million), and the drama &quot;The Color Purple&quot; ($94.2million). Box Office Mojo estimated more than 59million tickets were sold. Industry experts suggest that as of 1997 the box office returns to the studio (minus the theaters&#x27; share) was $105.5million.

The year was considered an unsuccessful one for film. Despite a record number of film releases, ticket sales were down 17% compared with 1984. Industry executives blamed the problem, in part, on a lack of originality, and a glut of youth-oriented films targeted at those under18. Only &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and &quot;Rambo: First Blood PartII&quot; were considered blockbusters, earning more than double the box office of &quot;Cocoon&quot;. Films offering escapism and pro-America themes also fared well. After years of poor performances, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, alongside &quot;Fletch&quot;, &quot;Brewster&#x27;s Millions&quot;, and &quot;Mask&quot;, reversed Universal Pictures&#x27; fortunes.

Outside the United States and Canada, the film earned a further estimated $170.5million, making it the third-highest-grossing film of the year, behind the romantic drama &quot;Out of Africa&quot; ($179.1million) and &quot;RockyIV&quot; ($172.6million). Cumulatively, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; earned a worldwide gross of $381.1million, making it the highest-grossing film of 1985, ahead of &quot;RockyIV&quot; ($300.5million) and &quot;Rambo: First Blood PartII&quot; ($300.4million). &quot;Back to the Future&quot; has received several theatrical re-releases to celebrate anniversaries, including a remastered version screened in 2010. These releases have raised the film&#x27;s worldwide total to $388.8million.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
&quot;Back to the Future&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics. Most reviewers agreed &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was among the year&#x27;s most entertaining films, partly because of its focus on storytelling instead of pure spectacle. Paul Attanasio and Gene Siskel argued that while &quot;Back to the Future&quot; appeared to be &quot;everything wrong&quot; with youth-targeted films, it successfully subverted expectations by focusing on a relatable narrative with an emotional core, and employed irreverent, good-natured humor. They, alongside Richard Corliss, agreed that it would endure because it offered something for children and adults. Some reviewers, such as Corliss and Leonard Maltin agreed that the exposition-heavy opening was &quot;Back to the Future&quot;″s weakest part, but led into a stronger half filled with &quot;wit&quot;, &quot;wonder&quot;, &quot;comic epiphany&quot;, and original ideas.

Dave Kehr remarked that Gale and Zemeckis were among the first generation of filmmakers openly influenced by growing up on televised entertainment, and their inspirations are evident throughout. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; said that despite Spielberg&#x27;s producer role, it was Zemeckis&#x27;s vision, being more subtle, gentler, and &quot;less noisy&quot;. Some reviewers compared it favorably to the 1946 fantasy drama &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;, which offered a similar premise of a central character changing his future. Roger Ebert said the film offered humanity, charm, humor, and many surprises that were among its &quot;greatest pleasures&quot;. Sheila Benson was more critical; she found &quot;Back to the Future&quot; to be overproduced and underdeveloped, featuring a hollow ending focused on materialistic rewards and lacking tension because Marty&#x27;s success never seemed in doubt. Siskel countered that the tension came from defying the expectations of a typical time travel film by making the past mutable and the future uncertain. Paul Attanasio criticized some aspects that seemed to be &quot;mechanically&quot; designed to create the broadest audience appeal.

The cast performances were generally well received, particularly those of Fox, Lloyd, Thompson, and Glover. Reviewers consistently praised Fox&#x27;s &quot;appealing&quot; performance, although some believed Lloyd&#x27;s performance outshone the rest. Kehr and Attanasio considered his uncontrolled performance and unique &quot;intensity&quot; a tribute to mad scientist characters, portrayed by the likes of Sid Caesar and John Belushi, while creating the definitive scientist archetype for modern audiences. In contrast, Vincent Canby and &quot;Variety&quot;″s review said that Thompson&#x27;s &quot;deceptively passionate&quot; performance and Glover&#x27;s bumbling-to-confident character provided &quot;Back to the Future&quot;″s standout performances. Some reviewers considered the use of Libyan terrorists, an actual fear at the time, to be in poor taste.

===Accolades===
&quot;Back to the Future&quot; received four nominations at the 43rd Golden Globe Awards, for Best Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy), Best Actor in a Motion Picture (Musical or Comedy) (Fox), Best Original Song (&quot;The Power of Love&quot;), and Best Screenplay (Gale and Zemeckis). The film was also named Favorite Motion Picture at the 12th People&#x27;s Choice Awards. At the 1986 Academy Awards, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; received one award for Best Sound Effects Editing (CharlesL. Campbell and Robert Rutledge). It received a further three nominations: Best Original Screenplay (Gale and Zemeckis); Best Sound (Bill Varney, B. Tennyson Sebastian II, Robert Thirlwell, and William B. Kaplan); and Best Original Song (&quot;The Power of Love&quot;).

At the 39th British Academy Film Awards, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; received five nominations, including Best Film, Best Original Screenplay (Gale and Zemeckis), Best Visual Effects (Pike and Ralston), Best Production Design (Paull), and Best Editing (Schmidt and Keramidas). At the 13th Saturn Awards, the film won three awards: Best Science Fiction Film, Best Actor (Fox), and Best Special Effects (Pike). It also won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; performed well internationally: it won Best Foreign Producer (Spielberg) and Best Foreign Screenplay at the David di Donatello awards (Italy), Outstanding Foreign Film from the Japan Academy, and the Goldene Leinwand (Germany) for selling more than three million tickets in its first eighteen months.

==Post-release==
===Home media===
&quot;Back to the Future&quot; was released on VHS on May 22, 1986, priced at $79.95, becoming the first film to sell 450,000 units at that price point, and was also the most-rented cassette of the year. A sequel was not planned until after &quot;Back to the Future&quot;″s theatrical release, and a &quot;ToBe Continued...&quot; graphic was appended to the end of the home release to promote awareness of future films. When &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was released on DVD in 2002, the graphic was removed because Gale and Zemeckis wanted it to be faithful to an in-theater experience. It debuted on Blu-ray in 2010 for the film&#x27;s 25thanniversary. The release featured a six-part documentary including interviews with the cast and crew, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted scenes, and associated music videos from all three films. The release also included the public debut of footage of Stoltz portraying Marty McFly. For its 35thanniversary in 2020, a remastered 4K Ultra HD version was released on Blu-ray and Ultra HD Blu-ray. Along with extras included in previous releases, this edition included audition footage and an exploration of the film&#x27;s props hosted by Gale. Limited edition steel bookcases and a display replicate of the levitating hoverboard from &quot;Back to the Future PartII&quot; were also available.

The &quot;Back to the Future&quot; soundtrack was released in July 1985 on cassette tape, LP record, and compact disc (CD). The soundtrack&#x27;s lead single, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, peaked at number one on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Sales were initially slow, but it eventually peaked at number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, in part because of the success of &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. Silvestri&#x27;s score received a limited release in 2009 onCD, containing the film score and unreleased variations. The scores for all three &quot;Back to the Future&quot; films were first released on LPrecord in 2016, individually and as a collection. Silvestri supervised the remaster of the original master recordings, including previously unreleased tracks, and Gale contributed liner notes.

===Other media===


In 1985, film merchandising was a relatively new concept, popularized by the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; film trilogy (1977–1983). As &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was not specifically aimed at children, there was no significant merchandising accompanying its release. Although a novelization by George Gipe was released in 1985, one of the earliest items for children, a rideable DeLorean, was not released until 1986. The film and its sequels have since been represented across a wide variety of merchandise including: Playmobil, playing cards, clothing, pottery, posters, board games, sculpted figures, plush toys, Funko POP! figures, action figures, Hot Wheels and die-cast vehicles, books, music albums, and Christmas ornaments.

&quot;Back to the Future&quot; received several video game adaptations. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; was released alongside the film for the Amstrad CPC, Commodore 64, and ZX Spectrum. An arcade-adventure game, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, was released in 1989 for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Gale called it one of the worst games ever made and advised people against purchasing it. &quot;Back to the Future: The Pinball&quot; was released in 1990, although Fox refused permission for the game to use his likeness. An episodic graphic adventure game, &quot;Back to the Future: The Game&quot;, was released in 2010. Gale contributed to the game&#x27;s narrative, which takes place after the events of the third film. An area in &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot; is based on &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and features voice work by Lloyd.

&quot;Back to the Future: The Ride&quot;, a simulator ride, ran from 1991 to 2007 at Universal Studios Hollywood and Universal Studios Florida. The ride&#x27;s development was supervised by Spielberg and featured Doc Brown (Lloyd) chasing down Biff (Wilson) who has stolen the DeLorean. A version of the ride at Universal Studios Japan ran from 2001 to 2016. A &quot;Back to the Future&quot;-themed Monopoly board game was released in 2015. A Funko board game was released in 2020. It casts players as one of the main characters from the films to battle different Tannens across history.

There have been several books about the making of the film series. &quot;We Don&#x27;t Need Roads: The Making of the Back to the Future Trilogy&quot; is an oral history by those involved in the production. &quot;Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History&quot;, a book chronicling the development of the entire &quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise, was released in 2015. The British Film Institute released &quot;BFI Film Classics: Back to the Future&quot; about the film&#x27;s background. The series also includes comic books detailing Doc&#x27;s and Marty&#x27;s adventures before and after the events depicted in the films. A crossover between the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; and Transformers franchises included a transforming DeLorean toy and associated comic books.

==Thematic analysis==
===Parental relationships and fate===
The main theme of &quot;Back to the Future&quot; concerns taking control and personal responsibility over one&#x27;s destiny: A situation can be changed even if it seems otherwise impossible to overcome. Thompson said the film represents how one moment can have a significant and lasting impact on a person&#x27;s life. Gale believed Doc provided the perfect summary of the series&#x27; running theme, when in &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; he said: &quot;Your future is whatever you make it, so make it a good one.&quot;

At the start of the film, Marty is rejected at Battle of the Bands and admits he fears his ambitions will remain unrealized. He worries he will end up like his parents and sees direct evidence in 1955 of George, also afraid of rejection, and being unable to approach Lorraine; his fears risk Marty&#x27;s future. Marty sets about manipulating the past to ensure his survival without concern for what impact his presence in 1955 is having on others. On his return to 1985, he is rewarded with wealthier parents and a nicer car, but he has simultaneously damaged Biff&#x27;s future, reducing him to a valet for the McFlys. Glover criticized the morality of the film&#x27;s ending, believing Marty&#x27;s reward should be happy parents in love with each other, and considered it a result of the film serving corporate interests, promoting the accumulation of wealth and purchasing material objects. In 2015, Zemeckis said the ending was perfect for its time but would be different if he made it now, although Gale disagreed and said he did not apologize for the scene. American audiences generally had no issue with this ending, but it was criticized by some international audiences.

Despite rejection by film studios for not being raunchy enough, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; alludes to sexual assault, racism, and the Oedipus complexa psychiatric theory suggesting a child holds an unconscious sexual desire for their opposite-sexed parent, as in the relationship between Marty and his future mother Lorraine in 1955. The relationships between parents and children are the basis of many elements of the film. Thompson believed the film had remained relevant to new generations because of its core idea that Marty&#x27;s and the viewer&#x27;s parents were once children and had the same dreams and ambitions they do.

===Reaganism and American anxieties===
Critics Justin Chang and Mark Olsen suggest the film can be seen as promoting Reaganismthe political positions of president Ronald Reaganwhich endorses older values of the American dream, initiative, and technological advancement. The Hill Valley of 1985 is depicted as run down and in decay, while in 1955 it is presented as a more simplistic and seemingly safer time, seen through a nostalgic lens. Marty&#x27;s future is bettered because he goes back to 1955 and teaches George to be more assertive and self-reliant; his initiative leads to a more prosperous future for Marty with materialistic rewards. The film uses many brand names of the time, ostensibly to make the setting more realistic, e.g. Mountain Dew, Pepsi, and Texaco, but the filmmakers received financial compensation from the brand owners, making their inclusion promotional and commercialistic instead of artistic.

Film studies lecturer SorchaNí Fhlainn argues that many 1980s films resulted from the American public&#x27;s desire for escapism from cultural anxieties and fears, including nuclear proliferation, unemployment, crime, growing inequality, and the AIDS crisis. In her view, films like those of the &quot;Star Wars&quot; series and &quot;Back to the Future&quot; offered a childlike reassurance of safety and comfort, emphasizing idealized American values and the positive effects of instilling power in a patriarchal figure like George McFly or Darth Vader. English professor Susan Jeffords considered Doc Brown to be an analog for Reagan, a man who embraces technological advancement, who conflicts with Libyan terrorists and provides the means for a failing family to better themselves.

The song &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; by Chuck Berry is used during the film&#x27;s final act. Berry initially resisted allowing the song to be used in the film. NPR argued that while Berry&#x27;s resistance may have been a matter of money, there are underlying racial issues involved in Marty, a white male, seemingly rewriting history to invent the rock and roll music genre, which was heavily influenced by African-American music. The 1955 segment also presents a distorted view of America, showing an African-American band playing at the high school dance, which would have been disallowed. Similarly, the African-American character Goldie Wilson is seemingly inspired to work towards becoming mayor by Marty&#x27;s intervention, inspiring a Reagan-style initiative and self-reliance.

===Influences===
As film fans, Gale and Zemeckis&#x27;s influences are seen throughout &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. There are references to &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1939), &quot;The Shaggy Dog&quot; (1959), &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964), &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; (1977), the &quot;Star Wars&quot; film series, and television shows including &quot;Mister Peabody&quot;, &quot;Star Trek: The Original Series&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. There are also allusions to 1960&#x27;s &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (based on H. G. Wells&#x27;s 1895 novella of the same name) and &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur&#x27;s Court&quot; by Mark Twain, in which the central character seemingly moves through time. The DeLorean dashboard chronometer uses the same color scheme as the time device of &quot;The Time Machine&quot;. Critic Ray Loynd opined that Doc can be seen as a King Arthur-type, with Marty serving as his knight.

==Legacy==
===Cultural influence===
Since its release, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; has remained an enduring popular culture touchstone, and in 2007, the United States Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the National Film Registry for being culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant. The film elevated Fox from a financially struggling actor to one of the most in-demand and globally recognized stars in Hollywood, and Gale received fan mail for decades after its release. He said he understood the continuing appreciation for the original film as it was the &quot;purest&quot; and &quot;most complete&quot; in the series. Fox compared it to &quot;The Wizard ofOz&quot; (1939), saying it still appeals to children because they do not think of it as an old film. In 2012, Thompson called it the greatest role of her career. Dean Cundey believed it resonated with fans because it offers the fantasy of going back in time to change things and make the present better. Lloyd described being approached by fans from around the world, who have said the film inspired them to become a scientist.

Many of the principal cast have reunited since the film&#x27;s release. Often these reunions are for charity, including The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson&#x27;s disease (Fox was diagnosed with the disease at age29), and Project HOPE. A 2019 reunion for the TCM Classic Film Festival featured the 4Krestoration premiere of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Josh Gad hosted a &quot;Back to the Future&quot; retrospective featuring many cast and crew. The cast has also appeared in advertisements only loosely related to &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, trading on their associated popularity.

The film has global popular appeal, particularly in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Argentina, the Netherlands, and Japan. On October21, 2015 (the day Doc and Marty travel to at the end of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, as depicted in &quot;Back to the FutureII&quot;) an estimated 27million social media users discussed the films; the most active users were in the United States, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Canada, and Brazil. Ronald Reagan was also a fan, referring to the film during his 1986 State of the Union Address to appeal to America&#x27;s young voters, saying, &quot;Never has there been a more exciting time to be alive, a time of rousing wonder and heroic achievement. As they said in the film &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, &#x27;Where we&#x27;re going, we don&#x27;t need roads. Although Gale has said that Reagan, after enjoying the joke about Doc Brown&#x27;s incredulous response to him becoming president, ordered the theater&#x27;s projectionist to stop the film, roll it back, and run it again, this is disputed by Reagan&#x27;s advisor, Mark Weinberg. &quot;Back to the Future&quot; is also seen as responsible for a resurgence of skateboarding in the 1980s. It made skateboarding a mainstream pastime acceptable for all, not just rebellious teenagers.

&quot;Back to the Future&quot; has been referred to in a variety of media, including television, films, and video games. Doc and Marty, respectively, inspired the eponymous characters of the 2013 animated television show &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;. The British pop rock band McFly are named for Marty McFly. The 2011 novel &quot;Ready Player One&quot; by Ernest Cline and the 2018 film adaptation (directed by Spielberg) both heavily refer to the film, including the central character using a DeLorean for transport. Filmmaker J. J. Abrams has also cited it as an inspiration.

The 2015 crowdfunded documentary &quot;Back in Time&quot; follows various fans of the series and details the impact it has had on their lives, interspersed with interviews from the crew including Fox and Lloyd. The DeLorean is considered one of the most iconic vehicles in film history. DeLorean&#x27;s creator John DeLorean was a fan of the film and sent personal letters to Gale and Zemeckis, thanking them for using his vehicle. The DeLorean was not a popular vehicle before the film&#x27;s release. However, in the years since it has become a popular collector&#x27;s item, the DeLorean Motor Company issued kits enabling fans to make their vehicle look like the DeLorean time machine. Gale led a restoration of one of the original screen-used DeLoreans in 2011, documented in &quot;Out of Time: Saving the DeLorean Time Machine&quot;.

===Modern reception===

&quot;Back to the Future&quot; is considered a landmark of American cinema, and one of the greatest films ever made. In 2004, &quot;The New York Times&quot; listed it as one of the 1,000 Best Movies Ever, and the following year its screenplay was listed as the 56th greatest screenplay of the preceding 75 years by the Writers Guild of America. Throughout the rest of the 2000s, it appeared on Film4&#x27;s &quot;50 Films to See Before You Die&quot; (number10), &quot;Empire&quot;″s 500 Greatest Movies of All Time (number23), behind the 1977 space opera &quot;Star Wars&quot;, and the American Film Institute listed it as the number10 best science fiction film, based on a poll of fifteen hundred people from the creative community. In 2010, &quot;Total Film&quot; named it one of the 100 greatest movies ever made, and the following year it was voted by BBC Radio 1 and BBC Radio 1Xtra listeners as their fourth favorite film of all time. It is also listed in the film reference book &quot;1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die&quot;. A 2014 poll of 2,120 entertainment-industry members by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; ranked it as the 12th best film of all time, again behind &quot;Star Wars&quot;. In 2015, the screenplay was listed as the 67th funniest on the WGA&#x27;s 101 Funniest Screenplays list, and &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; also listed the film at number84 on its list of 200 essential movies to watch.

Several publications have named it as one of the best science fiction films ever made, and one of the best films of the 1980s. &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it as the numberone and numberfour best time-travel film ever made respectively. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; named it the 40th most essential film to be watched by pre-teens and the 28th best high-school movie. Marty McFly appeared at number39 on &quot;Empire&quot;″s 2006 list of its &quot;100 Greatest Movie Characters&quot;; Doc Brown followed at number76.

&quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; assesses approval rating from the aggregated reviews of critics, with an average rating of . The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;Inventive, funny, and breathlessly constructed, &quot;Back to the Future&quot; is a rousing time-travel adventure with an unforgettable spirit.&quot; Based on this score, Rotten Tomatoes also listed it as the 87th best Action and Adventure film. The film has a score of 87 out of 100 on Metacritic based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In the United Kingdom, readers of &quot;Empire&quot; voted the film as 11th on their 2017 list of &quot;The 100 Greatest Movies&quot;.

==Sequels and adaptations==
A sequel was not initially planned, and the teaser ending of Doc, Marty, and Jennifer flying off in the DeLorean suggested their adventures would continue off-screen. Universal Pictures was eager to pursue a sequel based on the significant financial and critical success of &quot;Back to the Future&quot;. However, Zemeckis and Gale were reluctant to participate, believing sequels often retreaded the best elements of the original film. They were also concerned that a poor follow-up could alienate &quot;Back to the Future&quot; passionate fan base, and undermine the pair after their first major joint success. Zemeckis and Gale acquiesced by 1987, once Universal Pictures clarified they would, if necessary, make a sequel without them. The pair&#x27;s sequel script was so long it was split into two films, &quot;Back to the Future PartII&quot; (1989) and &quot;Back to the Future PartIII&quot; (1990); the films were shot back to back.

&quot;Part II&quot; depicts Marty and Doc traveling to 2015, inadvertently enabling the now-elderly Biff Tannen to steal the DeLorean and return to 1955, rewriting history in his favor. Wells and Glover did not return for the sequels. &quot;PartII&quot; was a financial success but was criticized for its complex, convoluted narrative. Zemeckis has said it is his least favorite film in the series. The final film, &quot;PartIII&quot; follows Marty as he travels to 1885 to rescue a time-stranded Doc. While the film fared less well financially than the two earlier films, it was more critically well-received than &quot;PartII&quot;. A 2018 poll by &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; of 2,200 people found 71% wanted a &quot;Back to the Future&quot; sequel, ahead of another &quot;Toy Story&quot; or &quot;Indiana Jones&quot; film. Gale has said there will never be a fourth film, likening it to &quot;selling your kids into prostitution&quot;. He added a &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film could never happen without Fox, who could not participate because of the effects of his Parkinson&#x27;s disease. 

An animated television series, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, aired on CBS between 1991 and 1992. It follows Doc&#x27;s and Marty&#x27;s adventures through various historical periods, intercut with live-action segments featuring Doc (Lloyd), performing science experiments alongside Bill Nye. A short film, &quot;Doc Brown Saves the World&quot; (2015), celebrated the film&#x27;s 30th anniversary. Lloyd reprised his role as Doc, who must travel to the future to prevent a nuclear holocaust in 2045. A musical theater production, &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, debuted in February 2020 at the Manchester Opera House, England, to positive reviews. The musical was written by Gale and Zemeckis, with music written by Silvestri and Glen Ballard. Gale described it as the best way to give fans more &quot;Back to the Future&quot; without adding to the film series. In 2024, Zemeckis said he was interested in adapting the musical into a movie. Overall, the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; franchise is considered one of the most successful film franchises in history.

<doc id="42994" wikidata="Q371008" url="?curid=42994" title="Chain letter">
<text>A chain letter is a message that attempts to convince the recipient to make a number of copies and pass them on to a certain number of recipients. The &quot;chain&quot; is an exponentially growing pyramid (a tree graph) that cannot be sustained indefinitely.

Common methods used in chain letters include emotionally manipulative stories, get-rich-quick pyramid schemes, and the exploitation of superstition to threaten the recipient. Originally, chain letters were letters sent by mail; today, chain letters are often sent electronically via email, social network sites, and text messages.

==Types==
There are two main types of chain letter:

# Hoaxes: hoaxes attempt to trick or defraud users. A hoax could be malicious, instructing users to delete a file necessary to the operating system by claiming it is a virus. It could also be a scam that convinces users to spread the letter to other people for a specific reason, or send money or personal information. Phishing attacks could fall into this.
# Urban legends: urban legends are designed to be redistributed and usually warn users of a threat or claim to be notifying them of important or urgent information. Another common form are the emails that promise users monetary rewards for forwarding the message or suggest that they are signing something that will be submitted to a particular group. Urban legends usually have no negative effect aside from wasted time.

In the United States, chain letters that request money or other items of value and promise a substantial return to the participants (such as the infamous Make Money Fast scheme) are illegal.

Some colleges and military bases have passed regulations stating that in the private mail of college students and military personnel, respectively, chain letters are not authorized and will be thrown out. However, it is often difficult to distinguish chain letters from genuine correspondence.

==Channels==

===Print===

The oldest known channel for chain letters is written, or printed, on letters on paper. These might be exchanged hand-to-hand or distributed through the mail. Already in the nineteenth century, chain letters were known to have circulated among Muslim pilgrims going on the hajj to Mecca. Those chain letters promised blessings or curses and required replication. One notorious early example was the &quot;Prosperity Club&quot; or &quot;Send-a-Dime&quot; letter. This letter started in Denver, Colorado in 1935, based on an earlier luck letter. It soon swamped the Denver post office with hundreds of thousands of letters before spilling into St. Louis and other cities. In 1964, the head of the United States Postal Inspection Service ordered a nationwide crackdown on violators of postal fraud and lottery laws due to an increase of chain letters reported around college towns in the United States. The typical letters included a list of names and instructed the recipient to send money to the name at the top of the list, remove that name, add their own name to the bottom of the list, and forward the letters to two more people.

===Email===
Some email messages sent as chain letters may seem fairly harmless; for example, a school student wishing to see how many people can receive their email for a science project, but they can grow exponentially and be hard to stop. Infamously, the salacious Claire Swire email spread in a chain-like fashion when its recipient sought to learn Swire&#x27;s identity.

Messages sometimes include phony promises from companies or wealthy individuals (such as Bill Gates) promising a monetary reward to everyone who receives the message. They may also be politically motivated, such as &quot;Save the Scouts, forward this to as many friends as possible&quot; or a warning that a popular TV or radio show may be forced off the air. Some, such as the &quot;Hawaiian Good Luck Totem&quot;, which has spread in thousands of forms, threaten users with bad luck if not forwarded.

Platforms such as Twitter and YouTube can host chain letters playing with users&#x27; emotions. They may also be in the form of warnings, such as stories of escaped convicts, which urge the reader to pass the message on. One chain letter distributed on MSN Hotmail began, &quot;Hey it&#x27;s Tara and John the directors of MSN...&quot; and subsequently claimed readers&#x27; accounts would be deleted if they did not pass on the message.

Another common form of email chain letter is the virus hoax and a form of cyberbullying.

===Web communities===
Chain letters within social media platforms became widespread on Myspace (in the form of Myspace bulletins) and YouTube (in the form of video comments) as well as on Facebook through messages or applications. For instance, the chain post/email of Carmen Winstead, supposedly about a girl from Indiana who was pushed down a sewage drain in a fire drill, states that, &quot;if you do not repost/send this to 10 people, Carmen will find you and kill you.&quot; Chain letters are often coupled with intimidating hoaxes or the promise of providing the sender with &quot;secret&quot; information once they have forwarded the message.

<doc id="42997" wikidata="Q707" url="?curid=42997" title="Flevoland">
<text>Flevoland () is the twelfth and newest province of the Netherlands, established in 1986, when the southern and eastern Flevopolders, together with the Noordoostpolder, were merged into one provincial entity. It is in the centre of the country in the former Zuiderzee, which was turned into the freshwater IJsselmeer by the closure of the Afsluitdijk in 1932. Almost all of the land belonging to Flevoland was reclaimed in the 1950s and 1960s while splitting the Markermeer and Bordering lakes from the IJsselmeer. As to dry land, it is the smallest province of the Netherlands at , but not gross land as that includes much of the waters of the fresh water lakes (meres) mentioned.

The province had a population of about 445,000 as of January 2023 and consists of six municipalities. Its capital is Lelystad and its most populous city is Almere, which forms part of the Randstad and has grown to become the seventh largest city of the country. Flevoland is bordered in the extreme north by Friesland, in the northeast by Overijssel, and in the northwest by the lakes Markermeer and IJsselmeer. In the southeast, the province borders on Gelderland; in the southwest on Utrecht and North Holland. Outside urban areas, the land in Flevoland is predominantly used for agriculture.

==Etymology==
Flevoland was named after Lacus Flevo, a name recorded in Roman sources for a large inland lake at the southern end of the later-formed Zuiderzee; it was mentioned by the Roman geographer Pomponius Mela in his &quot;De Chorographia&quot; in 44 AD. Due to the slowly rising sea level, a number of lakes gradually developed in the Zuiderzee region, which eventually became contiguous. Pomponius wrote about this: &quot;The northern branch of the Rhine extends to Lake Flevo, which encloses an island of the same name and then flows to the sea like a normal river.&quot; Other sources speak of Flevum, which means &#x27;flow&#x27;. The process continued and gradually the Zuiderzee arose from this lake. The names &quot;Flevoland&quot; and &quot;Vlieland&quot; have the same origin.

==History==
Between 790 and 1250, Lake Flevo became connected with the North Sea. As a result, a number of villages were swallowed by the sea. The newly created inland sea was called Almere.

After a flood in 1916, the decision was made to enclose and reclaim the Zuiderzee, an inland sea within the Netherlands, and thus the Zuiderzee Works started. Other sources indicate other times and reasons, but also agree that in 1932, the Afsluitdijk was completed, which closed off the sea completely. The Zuiderzee was later divided into IJsselmeer (mere at the end of the river IJssel) and Markermeer, planned to be mostly drained to make the Markerwaard. The Markerwaard was never built due to post-War fiscal austerity.

The first land reclaimed was the northeast polder (&quot;Noordoostpolder&quot;) in 1942. This took in the former small islands Urk and Schokland. It was at first added to the Province of Overijssel.

In the southwest the Flevopolder – larger than the above – was then reclaimed; its northeastern half in 1957 and its southwestern half in 1968.

A key feature of the latter is a narrow body of water kept at three metres below sea level along the former coastline, to stabilize the water table and prevent coastal towns from losing their waterfront and access to the sea. Thus, the Flevopolder became an artificial island joined to the mainland by bridges. The municipalities on the three parts voted to become a province, shortly before this was effected in 1986.

Since that time, Flevoland is the youngest of the 12 provinces of the Netherlands, having been granted this status in 1986. Its current sources of revenue are the cultivation of flowers, farming and tourism. In recent times, it has built many wind turbines as a source of renewable energy.

== Geography ==
=== Zuiderzee Works ===
Eastern Flevoland (&quot;Oostelijk Flevoland&quot; or &quot;Oost-Flevoland&quot;) and Southern Flevoland (&quot;Zuidelijk Flevoland&quot; or &quot;Zuid-Flevoland&quot;), unlike the Noordoostpolder, have broad channel between them and the mainland: the Veluwemeer and Gooimeer, respectively, making them, together, the world&#x27;s largest artificial island.

They are two polders with a joint hydrological infrastructure, with a dividing dike in the middle, the &quot;Knardijk&quot;, that will keep one polder safe if the other is flooded. The two main drainage canals that traverse the dike can be closed by floodgates in such an event. The pumping stations are the &quot;Wortman&quot; (diesel powered) at Lelystad-Haven, the &quot;Lovink&quot; near Harderwijk on the eastern dike and the &quot;Colijn&quot; (both electrically powered) along the northern dike beside the Ketelmeer.

A new element in the design of Eastern Flevoland is the larger city Lelystad (1966), named after Cornelis Lely, the man who had played a crucial role in designing and realising the Zuiderzee Works. Other more conventional settlements already existed by then; Dronten, the major local town, was founded in 1962, followed by two smaller satellite villages, Swifterbant and Biddinghuizen, in 1963. These three were incorporated in the new municipality of Dronten on 1 January 1972.

Southern Flevoland has only one pumping station, the diesel-powered &quot;De Blocq van Kuffeler&quot;. Because of the hydrological union of the two Flevolands, it simply joins the other three in maintaining the water level of both polders. Almere relieves the housing shortage and increasing overcrowding on the old land. Its name is derived from the early medieval name for Lake Almere. Almere was to be divided into three major settlements initially; the first, &quot;Almere-Haven&quot; (1976) situated along the coast of the Gooimeer (one of the peripheral lakes), the second and largest was to fulfill the role of city centre as &quot;Almere-Stad&quot; (1980), and the third was &quot;Almere-Buiten&quot; (1984) to the northwest towards Lelystad. In 2003, the municipality made a new &quot;Structuurplan&quot; which started development of three new settlements: &quot;Overgooi&quot; in the southeast, &quot;Almere-Hout&quot; in the east, and &quot;Almere-Poort&quot; in the West. In time, &quot;Almere-Pampus&quot; could be developed in the northwest, with possibly a new bridge over the IJmeer towards Amsterdam.

The Oostvaardersplassen is a landscape of shallow pools, islets, and swamps. Originally, this low part of the new polder was destined to become an industrial area. Spontaneous settlement of interesting flora and fauna turned the area into a nature park, of such importance that the new railway line was diverted. The recent decline in agricultural land use will in time make expanding &quot;natural&quot; land use possible, and connect the Oostvaardersplassen to the Veluwe.

The centre of the polder most closely resembles the prewar polders in that it is almost exclusively agricultural. In contrast, the southeastern part is dominated by extensive forests. Here is also found the only other settlement of the polder, Zeewolde (1984), again a more conventional town acting as the local centre. Zeewolde became a municipality at the same time as Almere, on 1 January 1984, which in the case of Zeewolde meant that the municipality existed before the town itself, with only farms in the surrounding land to be governed until the town started to grow.

=== Municipalities ===
== Demographics ==
On 1 January 2023, Flevoland had a total population of 444,701 and a population density of . It is the 2nd least populous province of the Netherlands, with only Zeeland having fewer people. The city of Almere is the most populous municipality in the province.

==Religion==
In 2015, 15.5% of the population belonged to the Protestant Church in the Netherlands while 12.3% was Roman Catholic, 7.2% was Muslim and 9.9% belonged to other churches or faiths. Over half (55.2%) of the population identified as non-religious.

== Politics ==
Since 2023, the King&#x27;s Commissioner of Flevoland is , who is a member of the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD).

The Provincial Council of Flevoland has 41 seats. At the provincial elections in March 2023, the Farmer–Citizen Movement (BBB) became the largest party with 10 seats. The People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD) is second largest with 4 seats, after which the Party for Freedom (PVV), Labour Party (PvdA) and Green Left (, GL) won 3 seats each. Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA), Democrats 66 (D66), Party for the Animals (PvdD), Socialist Party (SP), Christian Union (CU), Reformed Political Party (SGP), JA21 and Forum for Democracy (FVD) all won 2 seats each. 50PLUS and Strong Local Flevoland (SLP), a regional party, both won 1 seat each.

== Economy ==
The gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was €14 billion in 2018, accounting for 1.8% of the Netherlands&#x27; economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €29,500 or 98% of the EU27 average in the same year.

== Transport ==
=== Rail ===
The Flevopolder is served by the Flevolijn, running from Weesp to Lelystad, and the Hanzelijn, continuing from Lelystad towards Zwolle. The two railways stations of the province with intercity services are Almere Centrum and Lelystad Centrum.

Furthermore, Lelystad Zuid is a planned railway station between Almere Oostvaarders and Lelystad Centrum. It has been partially constructed preceding the opening of the railway in 1988, but construction has been put on indefinite hold because of slower-than-expected development of the city of Lelystad.

Amongst the cities with direct train connections to Flevoland are Amsterdam, Utrecht, The Hague, Zwolle, Groningen, Leeuwarden and Schiphol Airport.

=== Airport ===
There is one airport in the province: Lelystad Airport. A second airport, Noordoostpolder Airport near Emmeloord, was closed in the late 1990s due to town expansion.

<doc id="43000" wikidata="Q2907" url="?curid=43000" title="Sucre">
<text>Sucre (; ) is the &quot;de jure&quot; capital city of Bolivia, the capital of the Chuquisaca Department and the sixth most populous city in Bolivia. Located in the south-central part of the country, Sucre lies at an elevation of . This relatively high altitude gives the city a subtropical highland climate with cool temperatures year-round. Over the centuries, the city has received various names, including La Plata, Charcas, and Chuquisaca. Today, the region is of predominantly Quechua background, with some Aymara communities and influences.

Sucre holds major national importance and is an educational and government center, as well as the location of the Bolivian Supreme Court. Its pleasant climate and low crime rates have made the city popular amongst foreigners and Bolivians alike. Notably, Sucre contains one of the best preserved Hispanic colonial and republican historic city centres in the Western Hemisphere - similar to cities such as Cuzco and Quito. This architectural heritage and the millenarian history of the Charcas region has led to Sucre&#x27;s designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city has held an important place in Bolivian history from its place as an important center in the Real Audencia de Charcas, and later as the first capital of Bolivia before the fall of silver&#x27;s importance as a global mineral commodity. Some regional tension remains from the historical transfer of capital functions to La Paz, and even today the issue features an important role in local culture and political ideology.

==History==
Prior to Spanish colonization, Sucre was an Inca town called Chuquisaca, a name that remains an alternative designation for the city today. The name &quot;Chuquisaca&quot; possibly derives from the Quechua words &quot;chuqi&quot;, meaning &#x27;precious metal&#x27; or &#x27;silver&#x27;, and &quot;shaqa&quot; or &quot;saqa&quot;, meaning &#x27;abundance&#x27;, &#x27;a heap&#x27;, or &#x27;a pile of small things&#x27;, thus translating to &#x27;a heap of precious metal&#x27; or &#x27;a pile of silver&#x27;.

Chuquisaca was the provincial capital of the wamani of Charca, established after Topa Inka Yupanqui conquered the Aymara kingdom that originally occupied the area and imposed the Quechua language on them. According to Inca Garcilaso de la Vega, the Inca ruler received ambassadors from the kingdom of Tucman (Tucumán) while in Charca. Due to their warrior background, the Charcas were excluded from various state duties and many served as soldiers, being recruited in large numbers by Wayna Qhapaq for northern campaigns. During Wayna Qhapaq&#x27;s wars in modern-day Ecuador, the Guarani-speaking Chiriguanos from Paraguay invaded the Charcas frontier, aided by a band of European explorers. Although the Chiriguanos were repelled by commanders sent by Wayna Qhapaq from Quito, the Portuguese conquistador Aleixo Garcia is believed to be the first European to make contact with Charcas in 1525.

Although the Inca territories south of Cusco were assigned to the head conquistador Diego de Almagro, there is no record of him visiting Chuquisaca and the Charcas territory during his 1535 expedition to Collasuyo. After Almagro&#x27;s murder in 1538, Francisco Pizarro, sent his brothers Gonzalo Pizarro and Hernando Pizarro to Charcas to claim the region. Hernando Pizarro traveled to Chuquisaca along with the Emperor Paullu Inca. During their visit, they met with Consara, the principal lord of the Charcas region. Consara provided crucial information about the resources of Charca, including silver mines in Porco, gold mines in Chiutamarca, copper mines in Aytacara, and tin mines in Chayanta. The settlement was briefly occupied by Diego Méndez, under the orders of Diego de Almagro II, during Almagro II&#x27;s uprising against Pizarro and the Spanish government.

The Spanish foundation of Sucre occurred on November 30, 1538, under the name &quot;Ciudad de la Plata de la Nueva Toledo&quot; (City of Silver of New Toledo) by Pedro Anzures, Marqués de Campo Redondo. In 1559, the Spanish King Philip II established the &quot;Audiencia de Charcas&quot; in La Plata with authority over an area which covers what is now Paraguay, southeastern Peru, northern Chile and Argentina, and much of Bolivia. The &quot;Real Audiencia of Charcas&quot; was a subdivision of the Viceroyalty of Peru until 1776, when it was transferred to the newly created Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. In 1601 the Recoleta Monastery was founded by the Franciscans. In 1609, an archbishopric was founded in the city. In 1624 St Francis Xavier University of Chuquisaca was founded.
Very much a Spanish city during the colonial era, the narrow streets of the city centre are organised in a grid, reflecting the Andalusian culture that is embodied in the architecture of the city&#x27;s great houses and numerous convents and churches. Sucre remains the seat of the Roman Catholic Church in Bolivia, and a common sight is members of religious orders dressed in traditional habit. For much of its colonial history, Sucre&#x27;s temperate climate was preferred by the Spanish royalty and wealthy families involved in silver trade coming from Potosí. Sucre&#x27;s University (Universidad Mayor Real y Pontificia de San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca) is one of the oldest universities in the new world.

On May 25, 1809, the Bolivian independence movement was started with the ringing of the bell of the Basilica of Saint Francisco. This bell was rung to the point of breakage, but it can still be found in the Basilica today: it is one of the most precious relics of the city.
Until the 19th century, La Plata was the judicial, religious and cultural centre of the region. It was proclaimed provisional capital of the newly independent Upper Peru (later, Bolivia) in July 1826. On July 12, 1839, President José Miguel de Velasco proclaimed a law naming the city as the capital of Bolivia, and renaming it in honor of the revolutionary leader Antonio José de Sucre. After the economic decline of Potosí and its silver industry, the Bolivian seat of government was moved from Sucre to La Paz in 1898. Many argue Sucre was the location of the beginning of the Latin American independence movement against Spain. From that point of view, Bolivia was the last Spanish imperial territory in South America to gain its independence, in 1825. In 1991, Sucre became a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

==Government==
Together with La Paz, Sucre is one of two governmental centers of Bolivia: It is the seat of the judiciary, where the Supreme Court of Justice is located. As designated in the Constitution of Bolivia, Sucre is the true capital of the nation, while La Paz is the seat of government. Sucre is also the capital city of the department of Chuquisaca. The government of the City of Sucre is divided into executive and legislative branches. The Mayor of Sucre is the executive head of the city government, elected for a term of five years by general election. The legislative branch consists of the Municipal Council, which elects a President, Vice President and Secretary from a group of eleven members.

The mayor of Sucre is Enrique Leaño of the Movement for Socialism, who defeated Horacio Poppe in elections held on March 3, 2021.

The Municipal Council is the legislative branch of the government of the municipality of Sucre, the constitutional capital of Bolivia. The council consists of eleven elected members, and it elects its own President, Vice President and Secretary. The members of the municipal council elected on May 3, 2021 are:

*Oscar Sandy (MAS)
*Yolanda Barrios (MAS)
*Rodolfo Avilés (MAS)
*Guadalupe Fernández (MAS)
*Eduardo Lora (R-2025)
*Melisa Cortés (R-2025)
*Antonio Pino (R-2025)
*Carmen Rosa Torres (R-2025)
*Jenny Montaño (C-A)
*Gonzalo Pallares (CST)
*Edwin González (Unidos)

==Geography and territorial organization==

Sucre is divided into eight numbered districts: the first five of these are urban districts, while Districts 6, 7, and 8 are rural districts. Each is administered by a Sub-Mayor (), appointed by the Mayor of Sucre. The rural districts include numerous rural communities outside the urban area.

Sucre is served by Alcantari Airport, situated to the South.

===Climate===
Sucre has a subtropical highland climate (Köppen: Cwb), with mild temperatures year round. Rain generally falls in summer thunderstorms.

The highest record temperature was while the lowest record temperature was 
==The City of Four Names==

Each of the well known names represent a specific era of the city&#x27;s history:

*&quot;Charcas&quot; was the indigenous name for the place upon which the Spaniards built the colonial city.
*&quot;La Plata&quot; was the name given to the emerging Hispanic city of privilege and honor.
*The name &quot;Chuquisaca&quot; was bestowed upon the city during the independence era.
*&quot;Sucre&quot; honors the great marshal of the Battle of Ayacucho (December 9, 1824), Antonio José de Sucre.
*&quot;La Ciudad Blanca&quot; is a nickname that was bestowed upon the city because many of the colonial style houses and structures are painted white.

==Sports==
Sucre has the most important sport facilities in Bolivia, and the most practiced sport in the city is football. Sucre has the second-biggest football and Olympic stadium in the country, the Estadio Patria. As of the 2019 Apertura, the 2008 champion club Universitario de Sucre was relegated from the Bolivian professional league, leaving the city without a first-division team.

Other sports are also practiced, such as swimming at la Piscina Bolivariana, basketball at numerous courts around the city, as well as taekwondo, kung fu, volleyball, tennis and racquetball.

==Economy==

The Mercado Campesino marketplace is the largest in Sucre.

==Education==
Sucre is home to the second oldest public university in the Americas, the Universidad Mayor Real y Pontificia de San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca; often abbreviated USFX. The university draws students both nationally and internationally, and different departments can be found scattered around the city. Degree areas at USFX include law, political science, medicine, odontology, chemistry, business administration, financial sciences, and more.

The city also features other academic institutions such as a campus of the private university Universidad Privada del Valle, also known as Univalle, the National Teachers School (Escuela Nacional de Maestros &quot;Mariscal Sucre&quot;), the Universidad Privada Domingo Savio, and the Universidad Andina Simón Bolívar.

==Architecture==
The city of Sucre contains many old and classic buildings.

===The House of Freedom ===
Built in 1621, it is perhaps the most important building of the nation. The republic was founded in this building by Simón Bolívar who wrote the Bolivian Constitution.
The &quot;Salón de la Independencia&quot; houses the Bolivian Declaration of Independence.

===National Library===
Built on the same year of the foundation of the Republic, it is the first and the most important historical, bibliographical and documentation center of the country. The National Library has documents that date from 16th century.

===Metropolitan Cathedral===

Built between 1559 and 1712, the cathedral has the &quot;Museo Catedraliceo&quot; which is the first and most important religious museum of the country. The &quot;Pinacoteca&quot; has a vast collection of paintings by Colonial and Republican masters and also by Europeans such as Bitti, Fourchaudt and Van Dyck. The Cathedral contains a vast amount of jewelry made of gold, silver and gemstones.

===Archbishop&#x27;s Palace===
Built in 1609, was an important religious and historic institution during colonial times.

One of the best buildings of republican architecture, this was completed in 1896. It was the first Palace of Government of Bolivia but when the government was moved to La Paz it became the Chuquisaca Governorship Palace.

===Supreme Court of Justice===
On July 16, 1827, the Supreme Court of the Nation was established. Its first president was Dr. Manuel Maria Urcullo. Others prominent in its history include Dr. Pantaleon Dalence, who was twice president of the Supreme Court and through his qualities became known as the &#x27;Father of Bolivian Justice&#x27;. This institution was installed in several places before moving to its current building. It was designed in the neoclassical style under the canons of French academicism and was inaugurated on May 25, 1945.

===General Cemetery===

<text>Guar gum, also called guaran, is a galactomannan polysaccharide extracted from guar beans that has thickening and stabilizing properties useful in food, feed, and industrial applications. The guar seeds are mechanically dehusked, hydrated, milled and screened according to application. It is typically produced as a free-flowing, off-white powder.

==Production and trade==

The guar bean is principally grown in India, Pakistan, the United States, Australia and Africa. India is the largest producer, accounting for nearly 80% of world production. In India, Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Haryana are the main producing regions. The US has produced 4,600 to 14,000 tonnes of guar over the last 5 years. Texas acreage since 1999 has fluctuated from about 7,000 to 50,000 acres. The world production for guar gum and its derivatives is about 1.0 million tonnes. Non-food guar gum accounts for about 40% of the total demand.

==Properties==

===Chemical composition===
Chemically, guar gum is an exo-polysaccharide composed of the sugars galactose and mannose. The backbone is a linear chain of β 1,4-linked mannose residues to which galactose residues are 1,6-linked at every second mannose, forming short side-branches. Guar gum has the ability to withstand temperatures of 80 °C (176 °F) for five minutes.

===Solubility and viscosity===
Guar gum is more soluble than locust bean gum due to its extra galactose branch points. Unlike locust bean gum, it is not self-gelling. Either borax or calcium can cross-link guar gum, causing it to gel. In water, it is nonionic and hydrocolloidal. It is not affected by ionic strength or pH, but will degrade at extreme pH and temperature (e.g., pH 3 at 50 °C). It remains stable in solution over pH range 5–7. Strong acids cause hydrolysis, and loss of viscosity and alkalis in strong concentration also tend to reduce viscosity. It is insoluble in most hydrocarbon solvents. The viscosity attained is dependent on time, temperature, concentration, pH, rate of agitation and particle size of the powdered gum used. The lower the temperature, the lower the rate at which viscosity increases, and the lower the final viscosity. Above 80°C, the final viscosity is slightly reduced. Finer guar powders swell more rapidly than larger particle size coarse powdered gum.

Guar gum shows a clear low shear plateau on the flow curve and is strongly shear-thinning. The rheology of guar gum is typical for a random coil polymer. It does not show the very high low shear plateau viscosities seen with more rigid polymer chains such as xanthan gum. It is very thixotropic above 1% concentration, but below 0.3%, the thixotropy is slight. Guar gum shows viscosity synergy with xanthan gum. Guar gum and micellar casein mixtures can be slightly thixotropic if a biphase system forms.

===Thickening===
One use of guar gum is as a thickening agent in foods and medicines for humans and animals. Because it is gluten-free, it is used as an additive to replace wheat flour in baked goods.:41 It has been shown to reduce serum cholesterol and lower blood glucose levels.

Guar gum is also economical because it has almost eight times the water-thickening ability of other agents (e.g., cornstarch) and only a small quantity is needed for producing sufficient viscosity. Because less is required, costs are reduced.

In addition to guar gum&#x27;s effects on viscosity, its high ability to flow, or &quot;deform&quot;, gives it favorable rheological properties. It forms breakable gels when cross-linked with boron. It is used in various multi-phase formulations for hydraulic fracturing, in some as an emulsifier because it helps prevent oil droplets from coalescing, and in others as a stabilizer to help prevent solid particles from settling and/or separating.

Fracking entails the pumping of sand-laden fluids into an oil or natural gas reservoir at high pressure and flow rate. This cracks the reservoir rock and then props the cracks open. Water alone is too thin to be effective at carrying proppant sand, so guar gum is one of the ingredients added to thicken the slurry mixture and improve its ability to carry proppant. There are several properties which are important 1. Thixotropic: the fluid should be thixotropic, meaning it should gel within a few hours. 2. Gelling and de-gelling: The desired viscosity changes over the course of a few hours. When the fracking slurry is mixed, it needs to be thin enough to make it easier to pump. Then as it flows down the pipe, the fluid needs to gel to support the proppant and flush it deep into the fractures. After that process, the gel has to break down so that it is possible to recover the fracking fluid but leave the proppant behind. This requires a chemical process which produces then breaks the gel cross-linking at a predictable rate. Guar+boron+proprietary chemicals can accomplish both of these goals at once.

===Ice crystal growth===
Guar gum retards ice crystal growth by slowing mass transfer across the solid/liquid interface. It shows good stability during freeze-thaw cycles. Thus, it is used in egg-free ice cream. Guar gum has synergistic effects with locust bean gum and sodium alginate. May be synergistic with xanthan: together with xanthan gum, it produces a thicker product (0.5% guar gum / 0.35% xanthan gum), which is used in applications such as soups, which do not require clear results.

Guar gum is a hydrocolloid, hence is useful for making thick pastes without forming a gel, and for keeping water bound in a sauce or emulsion. Guar gum can be used for thickening cold and hot liquids, to make hot gels, light foams and as an emulsion stabilizer. Guar gum can be used for cottage cheeses, curds, yoghurt, sauces, soups and frozen desserts. Guar gum is also a good source of fiber, with 80% soluble dietary fiber on a dry weight basis.

===Grading===

Guar gum is analysed for
Guar gum powder standards are:

* HS-Code- 130 232 30
* CAS No.- 9000-30-0
* EEC No.- E 412
* BT No.- 1302 3290
* EINECS No. - 232-536-8
* Imco Code- Harmless

==Manufacturing process==
Depending upon the requirement of end product, various processing techniques are used. The commercial production of guar gum normally uses roasting, differential attrition, sieving, and polishing. Food-grade guar gum is manufactured in stages. Guar split selection is important in this process. The split is screened to clean it and then soaked to pre-hydrate it in a double-cone mixer. The prehydrating stage is very important because it determines the rate of hydration of the final product. The soaked splits, which have reasonably high moisture content, are passed through a flaker. The flaked guar split is ground and then dried. The powder is screened through rotary screens to deliver the required particle size. Oversize particles are either recycled to main ultra fine or reground in a separate regrind plant, according to the viscosity requirement.

This stage helps to reduce the load at the grinder. The soaked splits are difficult to grind. Direct grinding of those generates more heat in the grinder, which is not desired in the process, as it reduces the hydration of the product. Through the heating, grinding, and polishing process, the husk is separated from the endosperm halves and the refined guar split is obtained. Through the further grinding process, the refined guar split is then treated and converted into powder. The split manufacturing process yields husk and germ called “guar meal”, widely sold in the international market as cattle feed. It is high in protein and contains oil and albuminoids, about 50% in germ and about 25% in husks. The quality of the food-grade guar gum powder is defined from its particle size, rate of hydration, and microbial content.

Manufacturers define different grades and qualities of guar gum by the particle size, the viscosity generated with a given concentration, and the rate at which that viscosity develops. Coarse-mesh guar gums will typically, but not always, develop viscosity more slowly. They may achieve a reasonably high viscosity, but will take longer to achieve. On the other hand, they will disperse better than fine-mesh, all conditions being equal. A finer mesh, such as a 200 mesh, requires more effort to dissolve. Modified forms of guar gum are available commercially, including enzyme-modified, cationic and hydropropyl guar.

==Industrial applications==

* Textile industry – sizing, finishing and printing
* Paper industry – improved sheet formation, folding and denser surface for printing
* Explosives industry – as waterproofing agent mixed with ammonium nitrate, nitroglycerin, etc.
* Pharmaceutical industry – as binder or as disintegrator in tablets; main ingredient in some bulk-forming laxatives
* Cosmetics and toiletries industries – thickener in toothpastes, conditioner in shampoos (usually in a chemically modified version)
* Hydraulic fracturing – Shale oil and gas extraction industries consumes about 90% of guar gum produced from India and Pakistan.
Fracturing fluids normally consist of many additives that serve two main purposes, firstly to enhance fracture creation and proppant carrying capability and secondly to minimize formation damage. Viscosifiers, such as polymers and crosslinking agents, temperature stabilizers, pH control agents, and fluid loss control materials are among the additives that assist fracture creation. Formation damage is minimized by incorporating breakers, biocides, and surfactants. More appropriate gelling agents are linear polysaccharides, such as guar gum, cellulose, and their derivatives.

Guar gums are preferred as thickeners for enhanced oil recovery (EOR). Guar gum and its derivatives account for most of the gelled fracturing fluids. Guar is more water-soluble than other gums, and it is also a better emulsifier, because it has more galactose branch points. Guar gum shows high low-shear viscosity, but it is strongly shear-thinning. Being non-ionic, it is not affected by ionic strength or pH but will degrade at low pH at moderate temperature (pH 3 at 50 °C). Guar&#x27;s derivatives demonstrate stability in high temperature and pH environments. Guar use allows for achieving exceptionally high viscosities, which improves the ability of the fracturing liquid to transport proppant. Guar hydrates fairly rapidly in cold water to give highly viscous pseudoplastic solutions of, generally, greater low-shear viscosity than other hydrocolloids. The colloidal solids present in guar make fluids more efficient by creating less filter cake. Proppant pack conductivity is maintained by utilizing a fluid that has excellent fluid loss control, such as the colloidal solids present in guar gum.

Guar has up to eight times the thickening power of starch. Derivatization of guar gum leads to subtle changes in properties, such as decreased hydrogen bonding, increased solubility in water-alcohol mixture, and improved electrolyte compatibility. These changes in properties result in increased use in different fields, like textile printing, explosives, and oil-water fracturing applications.

=== Crosslinking guar ===

Guar molecules have a tendency to aggregate during the hydraulic fracturing process, mainly due to intermolecular hydrogen bonding. These aggregates are detrimental to oil recovery because they clog the fractures, restricting the flow of oil. Cross-linking guar polymer chains prevents aggregation by forming metal–hydroxyl complexes. The first crosslinked guar gels were developed in the late 1960s. Several metal additives have been used for crosslinking; among them are chromium, aluminium, antimony, zirconium, and the more commonly used boron. Boron, in the form of B(OH)4, reacts with the hydroxyl groups on the polymer in a two-step process to link two polymer strands together to form bis-diol complexes.

1:1 1,2 diol complex and a 1:1 1,3 diol complex, place the negatively charged borate ion onto the polymer chain as a pendant group. Boric acid itself does not apparently complex to the polymer so that all bound boron is negatively charged. The primary form of crosslinking may be due to ionic association between the anionic borate complex and adsorbed cations on the second polymer chain . The development of cross-linked gels was a major advance in fracturing fluid technology. Viscosity is enhanced by tying together the low molecular weight strands, effectively yielding higher molecular weight strands and a rigid structure. Cross-linking agents are added to linear polysaccharide slurries to provide higher proppant transport performance, relative to linear gels.

Lower concentrations of guar gelling agents are needed when linear guar chains are cross-linked. It has been determined that reduced guar concentrations provide better and more complete breaks in a fracture. The breakdown of cross-linked guar gel after the fracturing process restores formation permeability and allows increased production flow of petroleum products.

* Mining
* Hydroseeding – formation of seed-bearing &quot;guar tack&quot;
* Medical institutions, especially nursing homes - used to thicken liquids and foods for patients with dysphagia
* Fire retardant industry – as a thickener in Phos-Chek
* Nanoparticles industry – to produce silver or gold nanoparticles, or develop innovative medicine delivery mechanisms for drugs in pharmaceutical industry
* Slime (toy), based on guar gum crosslinked with sodium tetraborate

==Food applications==

The largest market for guar gum is in the food industry. In the US, differing percentages are set for its allowable concentration in various food applications. In Europe, guar gum has EU food additive code E412. Xanthan gum and guar gum are the most frequently used gums in gluten-free recipes and gluten-free products.

Applications include:

*In baked goods, it increases dough yield, gives greater resiliency, and improves texture and shelf life; in pastry fillings, it prevents &quot;weeping&quot; (syneresis) of the water in the filling, keeping the pastry crust crisp. It is primarily used in hypoallergenic recipes that use different types of whole-grain flours. Because the consistency of these flours allows the escape of gas released by leavening, guar gum is needed to improve the thickness of these flours, allowing them to rise as a normal flour would.
*In dairy products, it thickens milk, yogurt, kefir, and liquid cheese products, and helps maintain homogeneity and texture of ice creams and sherbets. It is used for similar purposes in plant milks.
*For meat, it functions as a binder.
*In condiments, it improves the stability and appearance of salad dressings, barbecue sauces, relishes, ketchups and others.
*In canned soup, it is used as a thickener and stabilizer. 
*It is also used in dry soups, instant oatmeal, sweet desserts, canned fish in sauce, frozen food items, and animal feed.
*The FDA has banned guar gum as a weight loss pill due to reports of the substance swelling and obstructing the intestines and esophagus.
*For cattle feed, as it enhances in the production of more milk as well as more percentage of fat in the milk.

== Nutritional and medicinal effects==
Guar gum, as a water-soluble fiber, acts as a bulk-forming laxative. Several studies have found it decreases cholesterol levels. These decreases are thought to be a function of its high soluble fiber content.

Moreover, its low digestibility lends its use in recipes as a filler, which can help to provide satiety or slow the digestion of a meal, thus lowering the glycemic index of that meal. In the late 1980s, guar gum was used and heavily promoted in several weight-loss drugs. The US Food and Drug Administration eventually recalled these due to reports of esophageal blockage from insufficient fluid intake, after one brand alone caused at least 10 users to be hospitalized, and a death. For this reason, guar gum is no longer approved for use in over-the-counter weight loss drugs in the United States, although this restriction does not apply to supplements. Moreover, a meta-analysis found guar gum supplements were not effective in reducing body weight.

Guar-based compounds, such as hydroxypropyl guar, have been used in artificial tears to treat dry eye.

===Allergies===
Some studies have found an allergic sensitivity to guar gum developed in a few individuals working in an industrial environment where airborne concentrations of the substance were present. In those affected by the inhalation of the airborne particles, common adverse reactions were occupational rhinitis and asthma.

=== Dioxin contamination ===
In July 2007, the European Commission issued a health warning to its member states after high levels of dioxins were detected in guar gum, which was used as a thickener in small quantities in meat, dairy, dessert and delicatessen products. The source was traced to guar gum from India that was contaminated with pentachlorophenol (PCP), a pesticide no longer in use. PCP contains dioxins, which damage the human immune system.

<text>The Rio Grande ( or ) in the United States or the Río Bravo (del Norte) in Mexico (), also known as P’osoge in Tewa and Tó Ba’áadi in Navajo, is one of the principal rivers (along with the Colorado River) in the Southwestern United States and in northern Mexico. The length of the Rio Grande is , making it the 4th longest river in the United States and in North America by main stem. It originates in south-central Colorado, in the United States, and flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Rio Grande drainage basin (watershed) has an area of ; however, the endorheic basins that are adjacent to and within the greater drainage basin of the Rio Grande increase the total drainage-basin area to .

The Rio Grande with its fertile valley, along with its tributaries, is a vital water source for seven U.S. and Mexican states, and flows primarily through arid and semi-arid lands. After traversing the length of New Mexico, the Rio Grande becomes the Mexico–United States border, between the U.S. state of Texas and the northern Mexican states of Chihuahua and Coahuila, Nuevo León and Tamaulipas; a short segment of the Rio Grande is a partial state-boundary between the U.S. states of New Mexico and Texas. Since the mid–twentieth century, only 20 percent of the Rio Grande&#x27;s water reaches the Gulf of Mexico, because of the voluminous consumption of water required to irrigate farmland (e.g. the Mesilla and Lower Rio Grande Valleys) and to continually hydrate cities (e.g. Albuquerque); such water usages are additional to the reservoirs of water retained with diversion dams. of the river in New Mexico and Texas are designated as the Rio Grande Wild and Scenic River.

==Geography==
The Rio Grande rises in the western part of Rio Grande National Forest, in the U.S. state of Colorado, and is formed by the joining of several streams at the base of Canby Mountain, in the San Juan Mountains, due east of the Continental Divide of the Americas. From the Continental Divide, the Rio Grande flows through the San Luis Valley, then south into New Mexico, and passes through the Rio Grande Gorge, near Taos, then toward Española, afterwards collecting additional waters from the Colorado River basin via the San Juan-Chama Diversion Project and from the Rio Chama. The Rio Grande then continues southwards, irrigating the farmlands in the Middle Rio Grande Valley through the desert cities of Albuquerque and Las Cruces in New Mexico, to El Paso, Texas and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, in Mexico. In the Albuquerque metropolitan area, the Rio Grande flows by historic Pueblo villages, such as Sandia Pueblo and Isleta Pueblo. South of El Paso, the Rio Grande is the national border between the U.S. and Mexico.

The segment of the river that forms the international border ranges from , depending on how the river is measured. The Rio Conchos is a major tributary of the Rio Grande, with its confluence 310 km. (193 straight air miles) southeast of El Paso near Ojinaga, in Chihuahua, Mexico. Downstream, other tributaries include the Pecos River and Devils River, both entering the Rio Grande from the north in the vicinity of Amistad Reservoir in Texas, and the Rio Salado and Rio San Juan both entering from the south with confluences in Tamaulipas, Mexico.

The Rio Grande rises in high mountains and flows for much of its length at high elevation; the valley floor at Albuquerque is , and El Paso above sea level. In New Mexico, the river flows through the Rio Grande rift from one sediment-filled basin to another, cutting canyons between the basins and supporting a fragile bosque ecosystem on its flood plain. From Albuquerque southward, the river flows through desert. Although irrigated agriculture exists throughout most of its stretch, it is particularly extensive in the subtropical Lower Rio Grande Valley. The river ends in a small, sandy delta at the Gulf of Mexico. During portions of 2001 and 2002, the mouth of the Rio Grande was blocked by a sandbar. In the fall of 2003, the sandbar was cleared by high river flows around .

The Rio Grande flows through a valley with diverse animal and plants communities. Conservation of the river and the valley is a recurring theme for people who live in the region.

==Navigation==
Although the river&#x27;s greatest depth is , the Rio Grande generally cannot be navigated by passenger riverboats or by cargo barges. Navigation is only possible near the mouth of the river, in rare circumstances up to Laredo, Texas.

Navigation was active during much of the 19th century, with over 200 different steamboats operating between the river&#x27;s mouth close to Brownsville and Rio Grande City, Texas. Many steamboats from the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers were requisitioned by the U.S. government and moved to the Rio Grande during the Mexican–American War in 1846. They provided transport for the U.S. Army, under General Zachary Taylor, to invade Monterrey, Nuevo León, via Camargo Municipality, Tamaulipas. Army engineers recommended that with small improvements, the river could easily be made navigable as far north as El Paso. Those recommendations were never acted upon.
The Brownsville &amp; Matamoros International Bridge, a large swing bridge, dates back to 1910 and is still in use today by automobiles connecting Brownsville with Matamoros, Tamaulipas. The swing mechanism has not been used since the early 1900s, though, when the last of the big steamboats disappeared. At one point, the bridge also had rail traffic. Railroad trains no longer use this bridge. A new rail bridge (West Rail International Crossing) connecting the U.S. and Mexico was built about 15 miles west of the Brownsville &amp; Matamoros International Bridge. It was inaugurated in August 2015. It moved all rail operations out of downtown Brownsville and Matamoros. The West Rail International Crossing is the first new international rail crossing between the U.S. and Mexico in over a century. The Brownsville &amp; Matamoros International Bridge is now operated by the Brownsville and Matamoros Bridge Company, a joint venture between the Mexican government and the Union Pacific Railroad.

At the mouth of the Rio Grande, on the Mexican side, was the large commercial port of Bagdad, Tamaulipas. During the American Civil War, this was the only legitimate port of the Confederacy. European warships anchored offshore to maintain the port&#x27;s neutrality, and managed to do so successfully throughout that conflict, despite occasional stare-downs with blockading ships from the US Navy. It was a shallow-draft river port, with several smaller vessels that hauled cargo to and from the deeper-draft cargo ships anchored off shore. These deeper-draft ships could not cross the shallow sandbar at the mouth of the river. The port&#x27;s commerce was European military supplies, in exchange for bales of cotton.

==History==

===Ancestral Rio Grande===
The sedimentary basins forming the modern Rio Grande Valley were not integrated into a single river system draining into the Gulf of Mexico until relatively recent geologic time. Instead, the basins formed by the opening of the Rio Grande rift were initially bolsons, with no external drainage and a central playa. An axial river existed in the Espanola Basin as early as 13 million years ago, reaching the Santo Domingo Basin by 6.9 million years ago. However, at this time, the river drained into a playa in the southern Albuquerque Basin where it deposited the Popotosa Formation. The upper reach of this river corresponded to the modern Rio Chama, but by 5 million years ago, an ancestral Rio Grande draining the eastern San Juan Mountains had joined the ancestral Rio Chama.

The ancestral Rio Grande progressively integrated basins to the south, reaching the Mesilla Basin by 4.5 million years and the Palomas basin by 3.1 million years ago, forming Lake Palomas. River capture by a tributary of the Pecos River then occurred, with the Rio Grande flowing to Texas by 2.06 million years, and finally joining the Pecos River 800,000 years ago, which drained into the Gulf of Mexico. Volcanism in the Taos Plateau reduced drainage from the San Luis Basin until a spillover event 440,000 years ago that drained Lake Alamosa, forming the Rio Grande Gorge, and fully reintegrated the San Luis Basin into the Rio Grande watershed.

===Prior to European contact===

Archeological sites from the earliest human presence in the Rio Grande Valley are scarce, due to traditional Indigenous nomadic culture, Pleistocene and Holocene river incision or burial under the Holocene floodplain. However, some early sites are preserved on West Mesa on the west side of the Rio Grande near Albuquerque. These include Folsom sites, possibly dating from around 10,800 to 9,700 BCE, that were probably short-term sites such as buffalo kill sites. Preservation is better in flanking basins of the Rio Grande Valley, where numerous Folsom sites and a much smaller number of earlier Clovis sites have been identified. Later Paleo-Indian groups included the Belen and Cody cultures, who appear to have taken advantage of the Rio Grande Valley for seasonal migrations and may have settled more permanently in the valley.

The Paleo-Indian cultures gave way to the Archaic Oshara tradition beginning around 5450 BCE. The Oshara began cultivation of maize between 1750 and 750 BCE, and their settlements became larger and more permanent.

Drought induced the collapse of the Ancestral Puebloan culture, at Chaco Canyon and elsewhere across the Four Corners region, at around 1130 CE. This led to a mass migration of the Ancestral Puebloans to the Rio Grande and other more fertile valleys of the Southwest, competing with other indigenous communities such as the Apache with territory in the Rio Grande Valley. This led to decades of conflict (the Coalition Period), the eventual merging of cultures, and the establishment of most of the Tanoan and Keresan pueblos of the Rio Grande Valley. This was followed by the Classic Period, from about 1325 CE to 1600 CE and the arrival of the Spanish. The upper Rio Grande Valley was characterized by occasional periods of extreme drought, and the human inhabitants make extensive use of gridded gardens and check dams to stretch the uncertain water supply.

===Spanish exploration===

In 1519, a Spanish naval expedition along the northeastern coast of Mexico charted the mouths of several rivers including the Rio Grande. In 1536, the Rio Grande appeared for the first time on a map of New Spain produced by a royal Spanish cartographer. In the autumn of 1540, a military expedition of the Viceroyalty of New Spain led by Francisco Vásquez de Coronado, Governor of Nueva Galicia, reached the Tiwa pueblos along the Rio Grande in the future New Mexico. On July 12, 1598, Don Juan de Oñate y Salazar established the New Spain colony of Santa Fe de Nuevo Méjico at the new village of San Juan de los Caballeros adjacent to the Ohkay Owingeh Pueblo at the confluence of the Rio Grande and the Río Chama.

===Since 1830===

During the late 1830s and early 1840s, the river marked the disputed border between Mexico and the nascent Republic of Texas; Mexico marked the border at the Nueces River. The disagreement provided part of the rationale for the Mexican–American War in 1846, after Texas had been admitted as a new state. Since 1848, the Rio Grande has marked the boundary between Mexico and the United States from the twin cities of El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, to the Gulf of Mexico. As such, crossing the river was the escape route used by some Texan slaves to seek freedom. Mexico had liberal colonization policies and had abolished slavery in 1828. In 1899, after a gradual change to the river position, a channel was dug for flood control which moved the river, creating what was called Cordova Island, which became the center of the Chamizal dispute. Resolving the dispute took many years and resulted in a 1909 combined assassination attempt on the American and Mexican presidents.

=== Rio Grande Water Rights (1900–present) ===
Following the approval of the Rio Grande Project by federal lawmakers in 1905, the waters of the Rio Grande were to be divided between the states of New Mexico and Texas based on their respective amount of irrigable land. The project also accorded of water annually to Mexico in response to the country&#x27;s demands. This was meant to put an end to the many years of disagreement concerning rights to the river&#x27;s flow and the construction of a dam and reservoir at various location on the river between the agricultural interests of the Mesilla Valley and those of El Paso and Juárez. In the agreement provisions were made to construct Elephant Butte dam on public lands. This act was the first occurrence of congressionally directed allocation of an interstate river (although New Mexico would not achieve statehood till 1912).
Following the admittance of New Mexico into the union, the increased settlement of the Rio Grande farther north in Colorado and near Albuquerque, the 1938 Rio Grande Compact developed primarily because of the necessary repeal of the Rio Grande embargo among other issues. Though both Colorado and New Mexico were initially eager to begin negotiations, they broke down over whether Texas should be allowed to join negotiations in 1928, though it had representatives present. In an effort to avoid litigation of the matter in the Supreme Court a provisional agreement was signed in 1929 which stated that negotiations would resume once a reservoir was built on the New Mexico-Colorado state line. The construction of this was delayed by the Market Crash of 1929. With negotiations remaining stagnant, Texas sued New Mexico over the issue in 1935, prompting the intervention of the president who set up the Rio Grande Joint Investigation the findings of which helped lead to the final agreement. The 1938 Rio Grande Compact provided for the creation of a compact commission, the creation of gaging stations along the river to ensure flow amounts by Colorado to New Mexico at the state line and by New Mexico to Elephant Butte Reservoir, the water once there would fall under the regulation of the Rio Grande Project which would guarantee provision to Texas and Mexico. A system of debits and credits was created to account for variations in the water provided. The compact remains in effect today, though it has been amended twice.

 In 1944, the US and Mexico signed a treaty regarding the river. Due to drought conditions which have prevailed throughout much of the 21st century, calls for a reexamination of this treaty have been made by locals in New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas. Texas, being the state with the least amount of control over the waterway, has routinely seen an under-provision of water since 1992. In 1997, the US designated the Rio Grande as one of the American Heritage Rivers. Two portions of the Rio Grande are designated National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, one in northern New Mexico and the other in Texas, at Big Bend National Park.

In mid-2001, a -wide sandbar formed at the mouth of the river, marking the first time in recorded history that the Rio Grande failed to empty into the Gulf of Mexico. The sandbar was dredged, but reformed almost immediately. Spring rains the following year flushed the reformed sandbar out to sea, but it returned in mid-2002. By late 2003, the river once again reached the Gulf.

===Uncertain future===

For much of the time since water rights were introduced in the 1890s, the Rio Grande flowed through Las Cruces from February to October each year, but this is subject to climate change. In 2020, the river flowed only from March to September. As of January 2021, the Elephant Butte Irrigation District (Ebid) expected that water shortages would mean the river only flows through Las Cruces from June through July. The water shortages are affecting the local ecosystem and endangering species including cottonwood trees and the southwestern willow flycatcher. The water of the Rio Grande is over-appropriated: that is, more users for the water exist than water in the river. Because of both drought and overuse, the section from Las Cruces downstream through Ojinaga frequently runs dry and was recently tagged &quot;The Forgotten River&quot; by those wishing to bring attention to the river&#x27;s deteriorated condition.

In 2022, due to increasing drought and water use, the water debt owed to Texas increased from 31,000 acre-feet to over 130,000 acre-feet since 2021, despite &quot;very significant efforts that were done on the river this year to keep water flowing downstream.&quot; In response, New Mexico increased its program offering to subsidize farmers who fallow their fields rather than planting crops, which uses additional water; the city of Albuquerque shut off its domestic supply diversion and switched to full groundwater pumping in 2021.

Additionally, in 2022, work began on El Vado Dam, during which it is unavailable for storage, reducing system capacity by about 180,000 acre-feet. MRGCD has requested storage of &quot;native water&quot; downstream at Abiquiu Reservoir, which normally only stores waters imported into the Rio Grande watershed from the Colorado River watershed via the San Juan–Chama Project.

Elephant Butte Reservoir, the main storage reservoir on the Rio Grande, was reported at 13.1% of capacity as of May 1, 2022, further decreasing to only 5.9% full by November 2021. Nearly a year later, in October 2022, the reservoir had made only insignificant rebounds, resting at 6.4% of capacity.

In late July 2022, due to extreme drought, the Rio Grande ran dry for about 50 miles in the middle Rio Grande Valley, including five miles in Albuquerque, the first time it had done so in over 40 years. The following winter, the basin experienced above-average snowfall, leading to very high flows in the river in spring of 2023 and flooding of some of its tributaries, including the Jemez and Pecos Rivers. By that summer, after the spring runoff had concluded and due to a failed New Mexico monsoon season and record high temperatures, the river went dry in Albuquerque for a second consecutive year.

==River modifications==

The United States and Mexico share the water of the river under a series of agreements administered by the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC), US–Mexico. The most notable of these treaties were signed in 1906 and 1944. The IBWC traces its institutional roots to 1889, when the International Boundary Committee was established to maintain the border. The IBWC today also allocates river waters between the two nations and provides for flood control and water sanitation. Use of that water belonging to the United States is regulated by the Rio Grande Compact, an interstate pact between Colorado, New Mexico, and Texas.

The Upper Colorado River Basin Compact allots of water from the upper Colorado River basin per year to municipalities in New Mexico. Albuquerque owns , about three-quarters of the total amount. The water is delivered to the Rio Grande via the San Juan–Chama Project. The project&#x27;s construction was initiated by legislation signed by President John F. Kennedy in 1962, and was completed in 1971. This diversion project transports water under the continental divide from tributaries of the San Juan River (the Navajo, the Little Navajo, and Blanco Rivers) to Heron Reservoir, which empties into the Rio Chama before this connects to the Rio Grande. Although it held rights to San Juan-Chama water for many years, it was only as of 2008 that Albuquerque began using it as part of its municipal supply, with the completion of San Juan-Chama Drinking Water Project (SJCDWP) by the Albuquerque Bernalillo County Water Utility Authority.
The SJCDWP uses an adjustable-height diversion dam to skim imported San Juan-Chama water from the Rio Grande, then pumps this water to a treatment plant on Albuquerque&#x27;s north side. From there it is added to a municipal drinking water distribution system serving Albuquerque&#x27;s metro area. Diversions are restricted during periods of low river flow in order to protect the riparian ecosystem and mitigate effects on endangered species like the Rio Grande silvery minnow. Treated effluent water is recycled into the Rio Grande south of the city. Surface water from the SJCDWP comprises a significant percentage of Albuquerque&#x27;s drinking water supply, with groundwater constituting the remainder; annual percentages vary according to runoff and climate conditions. Acquisition of native pre-1907 water rights is not part of the Water Authority&#x27;s long-term resource management plan, dubbed WATER 2120.

Dams on the Rio Grande include Rio Grande Dam, Cochiti Dam, Elephant Butte Dam, Caballo Dam, Amistad Dam, Falcon Dam, Anzalduas Dam, and Retamal Dam. In southern New Mexico and the upper portion of the Texas border segment, the river&#x27;s discharge dwindles. Diversions, mainly for agricultural irrigation, have increased the natural decrease in flow such that by the time the river reaches Presidio, little or no water is left. Below Presidio, the Rio Conchos restores the flow of water. Near Presidio, the river&#x27;s discharge is frequently zero. Its average discharge is , down from at Elephant Butte Dam. Supplemented by other tributaries, the Rio Grande&#x27;s discharge increases to its maximum annual average of near Rio Grande City. Large diversions for irrigation below Rio Grande City reduce the river&#x27;s average flow to at Brownsville and Matamoros.

==Crossings==

The major international border crossings along the river are at Ciudad Juárez and El Paso; Presidio and Ojinaga; Laredo and Nuevo Laredo; McAllen and Reynosa; and Brownsville and Matamoros. Other notable border towns are the Texas/Coahuila pairings of Del Rio–Ciudad Acuña and Eagle Pass–Piedras Negras.

The four Pueblo names likely antedated the Spanish &quot;entrada&quot; by several centuries.

* , Navajo, &quot;Female River&quot; (the direction south is female in Navajo cosmology)

 was most commonly used for the upper Rio Grande (roughly, within the present-day borders of New Mexico) from Spanish colonial times to the end of the Mexican period in the mid-19th century. This use was first documented by the Spanish in 1582. Early American settlers in South Texas began to use the modern &#x27;English&#x27; name Rio Grande. By the late 19th century, in the United States, the name Rio Grande had become standard in being applied to the entire river, from Colorado to the sea.

By 1602, had become the standard Spanish name for the lower river, below its confluence with the Rio Conchos.

==Tributaries==
The largest tributary of the Rio Grande by discharge is the Rio Conchos, which contributes almost twice as much water as any other. In terms of drainage basin size, the Pecos River is the largest.

<doc id="43006" wikidata="Q189045" url="?curid=43006" title="Britpop">
<text>Britpop was a mid-1990s British-based music culture movement that emphasised Britishness. Musically, Britpop produced bright, catchy alternative rock, with significant influences from British guitar pop of the 1960s and 1970s. Britpop was considered a musical reaction to the darker lyrical themes and soundscapes of the American-led grunge music of the time, and Britain&#x27;s own shoegaze music scene. The movement brought British alternative rock into the mainstream and formed the larger British popular cultural movement, Cool Britannia, which evoked the Swinging Sixties and the British guitar pop of that decade.

Britpop was a phenomenon that highlighted bands emerging from the independent music scene of the early 1990s. Although often seen as a cultural moment rather than a distinct musical genre, its associated bands typically drew inspiration from the British pop music of the 1960s, the glam rock and punk rock of the 1970s, and the indie pop of the 1980s.

The most successful bands linked with Britpop were Oasis, Blur, Suede and Pulp, known as the &quot;big four&quot; of the movement. The timespan of Britpop is generally considered to be 1993–1997, and its peak years to be 1995–1996. A chart battle between Blur and Oasis (dubbed &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;) brought the movement to the forefront of the British press in 1995. While music was the main focus, fashion, art and politics also got involved, with Tony Blair and New Labour aligning themselves with the movement.

During the late 1990s, many Britpop acts began to falter commercially or break up, or otherwise moved towards new genres or styles. Commercially, Britpop lost out to teen pop, while artistically it segued into a post-Britpop indie movement, associated with bands such as Travis and Coldplay.

==Style, roots and influences==
Though Britpop has sometimes been viewed as a marketing tool and more of a cultural moment than a distinct musical genre, there are musical conventions and influences the bands grouped under the Britpop term have in common. Britpop bands show elements from the British pop music of the 1960s, glam rock and punk rock of the 1970s, and indie pop of the 1980s in their music, attitude, and clothing. Specific influences vary: Blur drew from the Kinks and early Pink Floyd, Oasis took inspiration from the Beatles, and Elastica had a fondness for arty punk rock, notably Wire and both incarnations of Adam and the Ants. Regardless, Britpop artists project a sense of reverence for British pop sounds of the past. The Kinks&#x27; Ray Davies and XTC&#x27;s Andy Partridge are sometimes advanced as the &quot;godfathers&quot; or &quot;grandfathers&quot; of Britpop, though Davies disputes it. Others similarly labelled include Paul Weller and Adam Ant.

Alternative rock acts from the indie scene of the 1980s and early 1990s were the direct ancestors of the Britpop movement. The influence of the Smiths is common to the majority of Britpop artists. The Madchester scene, fronted by the Stone Roses, Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets (for whom Oasis&#x27;s Noel Gallagher had worked as a roadie during the Madchester years), was an immediate root of Britpop since its emphasis on good times and catchy songs provided an alternative to the British-based shoegazing and American based grunge styles of music. Pre-dating Britpop by four years, Liverpool-based group the La&#x27;s hit single &quot;There She Goes&quot; was described by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a &quot;founding piece of Britpop&#x27;s foundation&quot;.

Local identity and regional British accents are common to Britpop groups, as well as references to British places and culture in lyrics and image. Stylistically, Britpop bands use catchy hooks and lyrics that were relevant to young British people of their own generation. Britpop bands conversely denounced grunge as irrelevant and having nothing to say about their lives. In contrast to the dourness of grunge, Britpop was defined by &quot;youthful exuberance and desire for recognition&quot;. Damon Albarn of Blur summed up the attitude in 1993 when after being asked if Blur were an &quot;anti-grunge band&quot; he said, &quot;Well, that&#x27;s good. If punk was about getting rid of hippies, then I&#x27;m getting rid of grunge.&quot;

In spite of the professed disdain for the genres, some elements of both crept into the more enduring facets of Britpop. Noel Gallagher has since championed Ride and once stated that Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain was the only songwriter he had respect for in the last ten years, and that he felt their music was similar enough that Cobain could have written &quot;Wonderwall&quot;. By 1996, Oasis&#x27;s prominence was such that &quot;NME&quot; termed a number of Britpop bands (including The Boo Radleys, Ocean Colour Scene and Cast) &quot;Noelrock&quot;, citing Gallagher&#x27;s influence on their music. Journalist John Harris described these bands, and Gallagher, as sharing &quot;a dewy-eyed love of the 1960s, a spurning of much beyond rock&#x27;s most basic ingredients, and a belief in the supremacy of &#x27;real music&#x27;&quot;.

The imagery associated with Britpop was equally British and working class. A rise in unabashed maleness, exemplified by &quot;Loaded&quot; magazine, binge drinking and lad culture in general, would be very much part of the Britpop era. The Union Jack became a prominent symbol of the movement (as it had a generation earlier with mod bands such as the Who) and its use as a symbol of pride and nationalism contrasted deeply with the controversy that erupted just a few years before when former Smiths singer Morrissey performed draped in it. The emphasis on British reference points made it difficult for the genre to achieve success in the US.

==Origins and first years==
John Harris has suggested that Britpop began when Blur&#x27;s fourth single &quot;Popscene&quot; and Suede&#x27;s &quot;The Drowners&quot; were released around the same time in the spring of 1992. He stated, &quot;[I]f Britpop started anywhere, it was the deluge of acclaim that greeted Suede&#x27;s first records: all of them audacious, successful and very, very British.&quot; Suede were the first of the new crop of guitar-orientated bands to be embraced by the UK music media as Britain&#x27;s answer to Seattle&#x27;s grunge sound. Their debut album &quot;Suede&quot; became the fastest-selling debut album in the history of the UK. In April 1993, &quot;Select&quot; magazine featured Suede&#x27;s lead singer Brett Anderson on the cover with a Union Flag in the background and the headline &quot;Yanks go home!&quot; The issue included features on Suede, the Auteurs, Denim, Saint Etienne and Pulp and helped start the idea of an emerging movement.

Blur were involved in a vibrant social scene in London (dubbed &quot;The Scene That Celebrates Itself&quot; by &quot;Melody Maker&quot;) that focused on a weekly club called Syndrome in Oxford Street; the bands that met up were a mix of music styles, some would be labelled shoegazing, while others would go on to be part of Britpop. The dominant musical force of the period was the grunge invasion from the United States, which filled the void left in the indie scene by the Stone Roses&#x27; inactivity. Blur, however, took on an Anglocentric aesthetic with their second album &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; (1993).

Blur&#x27;s new approach was inspired by a tour of the United States in the spring of 1992. During the tour, frontman Damon Albarn began to resent American culture and found the need to comment on that culture&#x27;s influence seeping into Britain. Justine Frischmann, formerly of Suede and leader of Elastica (and at the time in a relationship with Albarn) explained, &quot;Damon and I felt like we were in the thick of it at that point... it occurred to us that Nirvana were out there, and people were very interested in American music, and there should be some sort of manifesto for the return of Britishness.&quot; John Harris wrote in an &quot;NME&quot; article just before the release of &quot;Modern Life is Rubbish&quot;: &quot;[Blur&#x27;s] timing has been fortuitously perfect. Why? Because, as with baggies and shoegazers, loud, long-haired Americans have just found themselves condemned to the ignominious corner labelled &#x27;yesterday&#x27;s thing&#x27;.&quot; The music press also fixated on what the &quot;NME&quot; had dubbed the New Wave of New Wave, a term applied to the more punk-derivative acts such as Elastica, S*M*A*S*H and These Animal Men.

While &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; was a moderate success, Blur&#x27;s third album, &quot;Parklife&quot;, made them arguably the most popular band in the UK in 1994. &quot;Parklife&quot; continued the fiercely British nature of its predecessor, and coupled with the death of Nirvana&#x27;s Kurt Cobain in April of that year British alternative rock became the dominant rock genre in the country. That same year Oasis released their debut album &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, which broke Suede&#x27;s record for fastest-selling debut album; it went on to be certified 7× Platinum (2.1 million sales) by the BPI. Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best British Album for &quot;Parklife&quot; (ahead of &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;). In 1995, Pulp released the album &quot;Different Class&quot; which reached number one, and included the single &quot;Common People&quot;. The album sold over 1.3 million copies in the UK.

The term &quot;Britpop&quot; arose when the media were drawing on the success of British designers and films, the Young British Artists (sometimes termed &quot;Britart&quot;) such as Damien Hirst, and on the mood of optimism with the decline of John Major&#x27;s government, and the rise of the youthful Tony Blair as leader of the Labour Party. After terms such as &quot;the New Mod&quot; and &quot;Lion Pop&quot; were used in the press around 1992, journalist (and now BBC Radio 6 Music DJ) Stuart Maconie used the term Britpop in 1993 (though recounting the event in a BBC Radio 2 programme from 2020, he believed it may have been used in the 1960s, around the time of the British Invasion). However, journalist and musician John Robb states he had used the term in the late 1980s in &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine to refer to bands such as the La&#x27;s, the Stone Roses and Inspiral Carpets.

It was not until 1994 that Britpop started to be used by the UK media in relation to contemporary music and events. Bands emerged aligned with the new movement. At the start of 1995, bands including Sleeper, Supergrass and Menswear scored pop hits. Elastica released their debut album &quot;Elastica&quot; that March; its first week sales surpassed the record set by &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot; the previous year. The music press viewed the scene around Camden Town as a musical centre; frequented by groups like Blur, Elastica, and Menswear; &quot;Melody Maker&quot; declared &quot;Camden is to 1995 what Seattle was to 1992, what Manchester was to 1989, and what Mr Blobby was to 1993.&quot;

==&quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;==
A chart battle between Blur and Oasis, dubbed &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;, brought Britpop to the forefront of the British press in 1995. The bands had initially praised each other but over the course of the year antagonisms between the two increased. Spurred on by the media, they became engaged in what the &quot;NME&quot; dubbed on the cover of its 12 August issue the &quot;British Heavyweight Championship&quot; with the pending release of Blur&#x27;s single &quot;Country House&quot; and Oasis&#x27; &quot;Roll with It&quot; on the same day. The battle pitted the two bands against each other, with the conflict as much about British class and regional divisions as it was about music. Oasis were taken as representing the North of England, while Blur represented the South. The event caught the public&#x27;s imagination and gained mass media attention in national newspapers, tabloids and television news. &quot;NME&quot; wrote about the phenomenon:

Billed as the greatest pop rivalry since the Beatles and the Rolling Stones, it was spurred on by jibes thrown back and forth between the two groups, with Oasis dismissing Blur as &quot;Chas &amp; Dave chimney sweep music&quot;, while Blur referred to their opponents as the &quot;Oasis Quo&quot; in a deriding of their alleged unoriginality and inability to change. In what was the best week for UK singles sales in a decade, on 20 August, Blur&#x27;s &quot;Country House&quot; sold 274,000 copies against &quot;Roll with It&quot; by Oasis which sold 216,000, the songs charting at number one and number two, respectively. Blur performed their chart topping single on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, with the band&#x27;s bassist Alex James wearing an &#x27;Oasis&#x27; t-shirt. However, in the long run Oasis became more commercially successful than Blur, at home and abroad. In a 2019 interview, Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher reflected on the chart battle between the two songs, both of which he saw as &quot;shit&quot;, and suggested that a chart race between Oasis&#x27; &quot;Cigarettes &amp; Alcohol&quot; and Blur&#x27;s &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; would have had greater merit. He also noted that he and Blur frontman Damon Albarn – with whom Gallagher had enjoyed multiple musical collaborations during the 2010s – were now friends. Both men have noted that they do not discuss their 1990s rivalry, with Albarn adding, &quot;I value my friendship with Noel because he is one of the only people who went through what I did in the Nineties.&quot; Noel Gallagher has also described Blur guitarist Graham Coxon as &quot;one of the most talented guitarists of his generation.&quot;
==Peak and decline==
In the months following the chart battle, &quot;NME&quot; states, &quot;Britpop became a major cultural phenomenon&quot;. Oasis&#x27;s second album, &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, sold over four million copies in the UK – becoming the fifth best-selling album in UK chart history. Blur&#x27;s third album in their &#x27;Life&#x27; trilogy, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, sold over one million copies. At the 1996 Brit Awards, both albums were nominated for Best British Album (as was Pulp&#x27;s &quot;Different Class&quot;), with Oasis winning the award. All three bands were also nominated for Best British Group and Best Video, which were won by Oasis. While accepting Best Video (for &quot;Wonderwall&quot;), Oasis taunted Blur by singing the chorus of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Parklife&quot; and changing the lyrics to &quot;shite life&quot;.

Oasis&#x27; third album &quot;Be Here Now&quot; (1997) was highly anticipated. Despite initially attracting positive reviews and selling strongly, the record was soon subjected to strong criticism from music critics, record-buyers and even Noel Gallagher himself for its overproduced and bloated sound. Music critic Jon Savage pinpointed &quot;Be Here Now&quot; as the moment where Britpop ended; Savage said that while the album &quot;isn&#x27;t the great disaster that everybody says&quot;, he commented that &quot;[i]t was supposed to be the big, big triumphal record&quot; of the period. At the same time, Blur sought to distance themselves from Britpop with their self-titled fifth album, assimilating American lo-fi influences such as Pavement. Albarn explained to the &quot;NME&quot; in January 1997 that &quot;We created a movement: as far as the lineage of British bands goes, there&#x27;ll always be a place for us... We genuinely started to see that world in a slightly different way.&quot;

As Britpop slowed, many acts began to falter and broke up. The sudden popularity of the pop group the Spice Girls has been seen as having &quot;snatched the spirit of the age from those responsible for Britpop&quot;. While established acts struggled, attention began to turn to the likes of Radiohead and the Verve, who had been previously overlooked by the British media. These two bands – in particular Radiohead – showed considerably more esoteric influences from the 1960s and 1970s that were uncommon among earlier Britpop acts. In 1997, Radiohead and the Verve released their respective albums &quot;OK Computer&quot; and &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, both widely acclaimed. Post-Britpop bands such as Travis, Stereophonics and Coldplay, influenced by Britpop acts, particularly Oasis, with more introspective lyrics, were some of the most successful rock acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s.

==Aftermath==
===Legacy===
Retrospective documentaries on the movement include &quot;The Britpop Story&quot;, a BBC programme presented by John Harris on BBC Four in August 2005 as part of Britpop Night, ten years after Blur and Oasis went head-to-head in the charts, and &quot;Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop&quot;, a 2003 documentary film written and directed by John Dower. Both documentaries include mention of Tony Blair and New Labour&#x27;s efforts to align themselves with the distinctly British cultural resurgence that was underway, as well Britpop artists such as Damien Hirst.

===Successors and revivals===
====Post-Britpop====
After Britpop the media focused on bands that may have been established acts, but had been overlooked due to focus on the Britpop movement. Bands such as Radiohead and the Verve, and new acts such as Travis, Stereophonics, Feeder and particularly Coldplay, achieved wider international success than most of the Britpop groups that had preceded them, and were some of the most commercially successful acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. These bands avoided the Britpop label while still producing music derived from it. Bands that had enjoyed some success during the mid-1990s, but were not really part of the Britpop scene, included the Verve and Radiohead. The music of most bands was guitar based, often mixing elements of British traditional rock (or British trad rock), particularly the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and Small Faces with American influences. Post-Britpop bands also used elements from 1970s British rock and pop music. Drawn from across the UK, the themes of their music tended to be less parochially centred on British, English and London life, and more introspective than had been the case with Britpop at its height. This, beside a greater willingness to woo the American press and fans, may have helped a number of them in achieving international success. They have been seen as presenting the image of the rock star as an ordinary person, or &quot;boy-next-door&quot; and their increasingly melodic music was criticised for being bland or derivative.

The cultural and musical scene in Scotland, dubbed &quot;Cool Caledonia&quot; by some elements of the press, produced a number of successful alternative acts, including the Supernaturals from Glasgow. Travis, also from Glasgow, were one of the first major rock bands to emerge in the post-Britpop era, and have been credited with a major role in disseminating and even creating the subgenre of post-Britpop. From Edinburgh Idlewild, more influenced by post-grunge, produced three top 20 albums, peaking with &quot;The Remote Part&quot; (2002). The first major band to break through from the post-Britpop Welsh rock scene, dubbed &quot;Cool Cymru&quot;, were Catatonia, whose single &quot;Mulder and Scully&quot; (1998) reached the top ten in the UK, and whose album &quot;International Velvet&quot; (1998) reached number one, but they were unable to make much impact in the US and, after personal problems, broke up at the end of the century. Other Welsh bands included Stereophonics and Feeder.
These acts were followed by a number of bands who shared aspects of their music, including Snow Patrol from Northern Ireland and Elbow, Embrace, Starsailor, Doves, Electric Pyramid and Keane from England. The most commercially successful band in the milieu were Coldplay, whose debut album &quot;Parachutes&quot; (2000) went multi-platinum and helped make them one of the most popular acts in the world by the time of their second album &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot; (2002). Snow Patrol&#x27;s &quot;Chasing Cars&quot; (from their 2006 album &quot;Eyes Open&quot;) is the most widely played song of the 21st century on UK radio.

====Post-punk/garage rock revival====

Bands like Coldplay, Starsailor and Elbow, with introspective lyrics and even tempos, began to be criticised at the beginning of the new millennium as bland and sterile and the wave of garage rock or post-punk revival bands, like the Hives, the Vines, the Strokes, the Black Keys and the White Stripes, that sprang up in that period were welcomed by the musical press as &quot;the saviours of rock and roll&quot;. British groups in this vein, including the Libertines, Razorlight, Kaiser Chiefs, Arctic Monkeys and Bloc Party, were viewed by some as a &quot;second wave&quot; of Britpop&quot;. These bands have been seen as looking less to music of the 1960s and more to 1970s–1980s punk, new wave, and post-punk, while still being influenced by Britpop. Despite these developments, artists such as Travis, Stereophonics and Coldplay continued to record and enjoy commercial success into the late 2000s.

====2010s–2020s Britpop revival====

At the beginning of the 2010s, a wave of new bands emerged that combined indie rock with the Britpop of the 1990s. Viva Brother launched an update on Britpop, dubbed “Gritpop,” with their debut album &quot;Famous First Words&quot;, although they did not receive significant support from the music press. In 2012, All the Young released their debut album, Welcome Home. Later, bands such as Superfood and the Australian band DMA&#x27;s joined the revival, with DMA&#x27;s debut album receiving favorable reviews.

In the mid-2020s, a new group of artists began drawing inspiration from the energy and iconography of mid-1990s Britain. Notable examples include Nia Archives, whose debut album &quot;Silence Is Loud&quot; features a Union Jack on its cover, and Dua Lipa, who explored Britpop influences in her album &quot;Radical Optimism&quot;. AG Cook’s triple album &quot;Britpop&quot; reimagines the genre’s aesthetic, featuring Charli XCX and a warped Union Jack cover. Rachel Chinouriri’s album &quot;What a Devastating Turn of Events&quot; notably incorporates Britpop influences, aiming to recreate the visual and sonic aesthetics of the Britpop movement. Chinouriri cited bands like Oasis and The Libertines as key inspirations.

==Terminology==
Artists of the genre have dismissed the &quot;Britpop&quot; term. Oasis bandleader Noel Gallagher denied that the band were associated with the term: &quot;We&#x27;re not Britpop, we&#x27;re universal rock. The media can take the Britpop and stick it as far up the back entry of the country houses as they can take it.&quot; Blur guitarist Graham Coxon stated in the 2009 documentary &quot;Blur – No Distance Left to Run&quot; that he &quot;didn&#x27;t like being called Britpop, or pop, or PopBrit, or however you want to put it.&quot; Pulp frontman Jarvis Cocker also expressed his dislike for the term in an interview with Stephen Merchant on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; in 2010, describing it as a &quot;horrible, bitty, sharp sound.&quot;

In 2020, with attention turning to all &quot;landfill indie&quot; acts of the 2000s, Mark Beaumont of the &quot;NME&quot; argued that the term Britpop had been devalued, ignoring all the cultural aspects that had made the scene so important, with the term becoming a &quot;catch-all&quot; for &quot;any band that played guitars in the 1990s.&quot;

<text>Blur are an English rock band formed in London in 1988. The band consists of singer Damon Albarn, guitarist Graham Coxon, bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree. Their debut album, &quot;Leisure&quot; (1991), incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegaze. Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks, the Beatles and XTC, Blur released the albums &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; (1993), &quot;Parklife&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1995). As a result, the band helped to popularise the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK, aided by a widely publicised chart battle with rival band Oasis in 1995 dubbed &quot;The Battle of Britpop&quot;.

Blur&#x27;s self-titled fifth album (1997) saw another stylistic shift, influenced by the lo-fi styles of American indie rock groups, and became their third UK chart-topping album. Its single &quot;Song 2&quot; brought the band mainstream success in the US for the first time. Their next album, &quot;13&quot; (1999) saw the band experimenting with electronic and art rock styles, and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn and Coxon. Their seventh album, &quot;Think Tank&quot; (2003), continued their experimentation with electronic sounds and was shaped by Albarn&#x27;s growing interest in hip hop and world music, featuring more minimal guitar work. Coxon left the band early in the sessions for &quot;Think Tank&quot;, and Blur disbanded for several years after the album&#x27;s tour in 2003.

In 2009, Blur reunited with Coxon and embarked on a European reunion tour. In the following years, they released several singles and compilations and toured internationally. In 2012, they received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music. Their eighth album, &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; (2015), was their first in twelve years and the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British charts. After the &quot;Magic Whip&quot; tour, Blur went on hiatus until the release of their ninth album, &quot;The Ballad of Darren&quot;, in 2023.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Leisure&quot;, 1988–1991===
Blur were formed in December 1988 when bassist Alex James joined Damon Albarn&#x27;s band, Circus, and they changed the name to Seymour after J. D. Salinger&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Already in the band were drummer Dave Rowntree, who had joined in October, and guitarist Graham Coxon, Albarn&#x27;s childhood friend from Essex, who was studying at the University of London&#x27;s Goldsmiths College along with Albarn and James. The group performed live for the first time in summer 1989 in the goods shed of the East Anglian Railway Museum at Chappel &amp; Wakes Colne. In November, Food Records&#x27; A&amp;R representative Andy Ross attended a Seymour performance that convinced him to court the group for his label. The only concern held by Ross and Food was that they disliked the band&#x27;s name. Food drew up a list of alternatives, from which the group decided on Blur. Food Records finally signed the rechristened band in March 1990.

From March to July 1990, Blur toured Britain, opening for the Cramps, and testing out new songs. In October 1990, after their tour was over, Blur released the single &quot;She&#x27;s So High&quot;, which reached number 48 in the UK Singles Chart. The band had trouble creating a follow-up single, but they made progress when paired with producer Stephen Street. The resulting single release, &quot;There&#x27;s No Other Way&quot;, became a hit, peaking at number eight. As a result of the single&#x27;s success, Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented the Syndrome club in London dubbed &quot;The Scene That Celebrates Itself&quot;. &quot;NME&quot; magazine wrote in 1991, &quot;[Blur] are [the] acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam.&quot;

The band&#x27;s third single, &quot;Bang&quot;, performed relatively disappointingly, reaching only number 24. Andy Ross and Food owner David Balfe were convinced Blur&#x27;s best course of action was to continue drawing influence from the Madchester genre. Blur attempted to expand their musical sound, but the recording of the group&#x27;s debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio. Although the resulting album &quot;Leisure&quot; (1991) peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart, it received mixed reviews, and according to journalist John Harris, &quot;could not shake off the odour of anti-climax&quot;.

===Britpop years, 1992–1995===
After discovering they were £60,000 in debt, Blur toured the United States in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their financial losses. The group released the single &quot;Popscene&quot; to coincide with the start of the tour. Featuring &quot;a rush of punk guitars, &#x27;60s pop hooks, blaring British horns, controlled fury, and postmodern humor&quot;, &quot;Popscene&quot; was a turning point for the band musically. However, upon its release it only charted at number 32. &quot;We felt &#x27;Popscene&#x27; was a big departure; a very, very English record&quot;, Albarn told the &quot;NME&quot; in 1993, &quot;But that annoyed a lot of people ... We put ourselves out on a limb to pursue this English ideal and no-one was interested.&quot; As a result of the single&#x27;s lacklustre performance, plans to release a single named &quot;Never Clever&quot; were scrapped and work on Blur&#x27;s second album was pushed back.

During the two-month American tour, the band became increasingly unhappy, often venting frustrations on each other, leading to several physical confrontations. The band members were homesick; Albarn said, &quot;I just started to miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere.&quot; Upon the group&#x27;s return to Britain, Blur (Albarn in particular) were upset by the success rival group Suede had achieved while they were gone. After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well-received set by Suede on the same bill, Blur were in danger of being dropped by Food. By that time, Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana. Although sceptical of Albarn&#x27;s new manifesto for Blur, Balfe gave assent for the band&#x27;s choice of Andy Partridge (of XTC) to produce their follow-up to &quot;Leisure&quot;. The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory, but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group.

Blur completed their second album &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; in December 1992, but Food Records said the album required more potential hit singles and asked them to return to the studio for a second time. The band complied and Albarn wrote &quot;For Tomorrow&quot;, which became the album&#x27;s lead single. &quot;For Tomorrow&quot; was a minor success, reaching number 28 on the charts. &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; was released in May 1993. The announcement of the album&#x27;s release included a press photo which featured Blur, dressed in a mix of mod and skinhead attire, posing alongside a mastiff with the words &quot;British Image 1&quot; spraypainted behind them. At the time, such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press; to quieten concerns, Blur released the &quot;British Image 2&quot; photo, which was &quot;a camp restaging of a pre-war aristocratic tea party&quot;. &quot;Modern Life Is Rubbish&quot; peaked at number 15 on the British charts, but failed to break into the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, selling only 19,000 copies there.

The success of &quot;Parklife&quot; (1994) revived Blur&#x27;s commercial fortunes. The album&#x27;s first single, the disco-influenced &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot;, found favour on BBC Radio 1 and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart, and number 59 in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 where it remains the band&#x27;s highest-charting single. &quot;Parklife&quot; entered the British charts at number one and stayed on the album charts for 90 weeks. Enthusiastically greeted by the music press—the &quot;NME&quot; called it &quot;a Great Pop Record ... bigger, bolder, narkier and funnier [than &quot;Modern Life is Rubbish&quot;]&quot;—&quot;Parklife&quot; is regarded as one of Britpop&#x27;s defining records. Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards, including Best Band and Best Album for &quot;Parklife&quot;. Coxon later pointed to &quot;Parklife&quot; as the moment when &quot;[Blur] went from being regarded as an alternative, left field arty band to this amazing new pop sensation&quot;.

Blur began working on their fourth album &quot;The Great Escape&quot; at the start of 1995. Building upon the band&#x27;s previous two albums, Albarn&#x27;s lyrics for the album consisted of several third-person narratives. James reflected, &quot;It was all more elaborate, more orchestral, more theatrical, and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional, misfit characters fucking up.&quot; The release of the album&#x27;s lead single &quot;Country House&quot; played a part in Blur&#x27;s public rivalry with Manchester band Oasis termed the &quot;Battle of Britpop&quot;. Partly due to increasing antagonisms between the groups, Blur and Oasis released their new singles on the same day, an event the &quot;NME&quot; called &quot;The British Heavyweight Championship&quot;. The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon, and Albarn appeared on the &quot;News at Ten&quot;. At the end of the week, &quot;Country House&quot; ultimately outsold Oasis&#x27; &quot;Roll With It&quot; by 274,000 copies to 216,000, becoming Blur&#x27;s first number one single.

&quot;The Great Escape&quot;, which Albarn told the public was the last instalment in the band&#x27;s Life Trilogy, was released in September 1995 to ecstatic reviews. The &quot;NME&quot; hailed it as &quot;spectacularly accomplished, sumptuous, heart-stopping and inspirational&quot;, while &quot;Mojo&quot; argued &quot;Blur are the very best that &#x27;95 Britpop has to offer and this is a most gong-worthy sound, complete with head-slicing guitars, catchy tunes and very funny words&quot;. Entering the UK charts at number one, the album sold nearly half a million copies in its first month of sale. However, opinion quickly changed and Blur found themselves largely out of favour with the media once again. Following the worldwide success of Oasis&#x27; &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; (which went quadruple platinum in the United States), the media quipped &quot;[Blur] wound up winning the battle but losing the war.&quot; Blur became perceived as an &quot;inauthentic middle class pop band&quot; in comparison to the &quot;working class heroes&quot; Oasis, which Albarn said made him feel &quot;stupid and confused&quot;. Alex James later summarised, &quot;After being the People&#x27;s Hero, Damon was the People&#x27;s Prick for a short period ... basically, he was a loser – very publicly.&quot;

===Reinvention after Britpop, 1996–2000===
An early 1996 &quot;Q&quot; magazine interview revealed that relations between Blur members had become very strained; journalist Adrian Deevoy wrote that he found them &quot;on the verge of a nervous breakup&quot;. Coxon, in particular, began to resent his bandmates: James for his playboy lifestyle, and Albarn for his control over Blur&#x27;s musical direction and public image. The guitarist struggled with drinking problems and, in a rejection of the group&#x27;s Britpop aesthetic, made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement. In February 1996, when Coxon and James were absent for a lip-synced Blur performance broadcast on Italian television, they were replaced by a cardboard cutout and a roadie, respectively. Blur biographer Stuart Maconie later wrote that, at the time, &quot;Blur were sewn together very awkwardly&quot;.

Although he had previously dismissed it, Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon&#x27;s tastes in lo-fi and underground music, and recognised the need to significantly change Blur&#x27;s musical direction once again. &quot;I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you&#x27;ve got to move on&quot;, he said. He subsequently approached Street, and argued for a more stripped-down sound on the band&#x27;s next record. Coxon, recognising his own personal need to—as Rowntree put it—&quot;work this band&quot;, wrote a letter to Albarn, describing his desire for their music &quot;to scare people again&quot;. After initial sessions in London, the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland, away from the Britpop scene.

The result was &quot;Blur&quot;, the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, released in February 1997. Although the music press predicted that the lo-fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur&#x27;s teenage girl fan-base, they generally applauded the effort. Pointing out lyrics such as &quot;Look inside America/She&#x27;s alright&quot;, and noting Albarn&#x27;s &quot;obligatory nod to Beck, [and promotion of] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so&quot;, reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time—an about-face of their attitude during the Britpop years. Despite cries of &quot;commercial suicide&quot;, the album and its first single, &quot;Beetlebum&quot;, debuted at number one in the UK. Although the album could not match the sales of its predecessors in Britain, internationally &quot;Blur&quot; was more successful. In the US, the album received strong reviews, reached number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold. The album&#x27;s second single and second track, aptly named &quot;Song 2&quot;, was also popular on alternative radio, reaching number six on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock chart and remaining on that chart for 26 weeks. After it was licensed for use in various media—such as soundtracks, advertisements and television shows—&quot;Song 2&quot; became the most recognisable Blur song in the US. After the success of &quot;Blur&quot;, the band embarked on a nine-month world tour.

In February 1998, a few months after completing the tour, Blur released &quot;Bustin&#x27; + Dronin&#x27;&quot; for the Japanese market. The album is a collection of Blur songs remixed by artists such as Thurston Moore, William Orbit and Moby. Among the tracks, the band were most impressed by Orbit&#x27;s effort and enlisted him to replace Street as producer for their next album, citing a need to approach the recording process from a fresh perspective.

Released in March 1999, Blur&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;13&quot; saw them drift still further away from their Britpop-era attitude and sound. Orbit&#x27;s production style allowed for more jamming, and incorporated a &quot;variety of emotions, atmospheres, words and sounds&quot; into the mix. &quot;13&quot; was creatively dominated by Coxon, who &quot;was simply allowed to do whatever he chose, unedited&quot;, by Orbit. Albarn&#x27;s lyrics—more heart-felt, personal and intimate than on previous occasions—were reflective of his break-up with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann, his partner of eight years. The album received generally favourable reviews from the press. While &quot;Q&quot; called it &quot;a dense, fascinating, idiosyncratic and accomplished art rock album&quot;, the &quot;NME&quot; felt it was inconsistent and &quot;(at least) a quarter-of-an-hour too long&quot;. &quot;13&quot; debuted at the top of the UK charts, staying at that position for two weeks. The album&#x27;s lead single, the gospel-based &quot;Tender&quot;, opened at the second spot on the charts. After &quot;Coffee &amp; TV&quot;, the first Blur single to feature Coxon on lead vocals, only reached number 11 in the UK, manager Chris Morrison demanded a chart re-run because of what he deemed was a sales miscalculation.
In July 1999, in celebration of their tenth anniversary, Blur released a 22-CD limited edition box-set of their singles. The accompanying tour saw Blur play the A-sides of the 22 singles in their chronological order of release. In October 2000, the group released the compilation &quot;&quot;, which debuted at number three in the UK and went 4× Platinum due to 1,200,000 copies being shipped. Dismissed by the band as &quot;the first record we have seen as product&quot;, the track listing and release dates of &quot;Blur: The Best Of&quot; were determined on the basis of market research and focus groups conducted by Blur&#x27;s record label, EMI. By this time, the group had largely disowned the upbeat pop singles from the Britpop era, and favoured the more arty, experimental work on &quot;Blur&quot; and &quot;13&quot;. In an otherwise highly enthusiastic review of the best-of for the &quot;NME&quot;, Steve Sutherland criticised the band&#x27;s &quot;sheer disregard&quot; for their earlier work; &quot;Just because these songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big-sales battle with Oasis doesn&#x27;t mean that we&#x27;re morons to love them.&quot;

===Coxon&#x27;s departure, &quot;Think Tank&quot; and hiatus, 2001–2007===
After &quot;13&quot; and the subsequent tours in 1999–2000, band members pursued other projects. Graham Coxon recorded a string of solo albums, while Damon Albarn dedicated his time to Gorillaz, the animated band he had created with Jamie Hewlett. Alex James worked with Fat Les and co-wrote several songs with Sophie Ellis-Bextor and Marianne Faithfull.

Recording for Blur&#x27;s next album began in London in November 2001, but concerted work started in June 2002, with the sessions moving to Marrakech, Morocco soon after, and then to Devon back in the UK. Not long after the sessions began, Coxon left the group. Graham had developed a drinking problem once Blur had become more mainstream being more involved in the business side of music then he would have liked to have, which ended up giving him huge anxiety and depression problems. This caused friendships and relationship problems. Coxon said &quot;there were no rows&quot; and &quot;[the band] just recognized the feeling that we needed some time apart&quot;. Before the album was released, Blur released a new single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Bomb When You Are the Bomb&quot; as a very limited white label release. The song is largely electronic, and was part of the band&#x27;s protest against war in the Middle East. Albarn, however, attempted to assuage fans&#x27; fears that the album would be electronic by providing reassurances that the band&#x27;s new album would be &quot;a rockin&#x27; record&quot;, and also said that it has &quot;a lot of finely crafted pop songs&quot;. Early in 2002, Blur recorded a song that would be played by European Space Agency&#x27;s Beagle 2 lander once it touched down; however, attempts to locate the probe after it landed on Mars were fruitless.

&quot;Think Tank&quot;, released in May 2003, was filled with atmospheric, brooding electronic sounds, featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn, and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon. The guitarist&#x27;s absence also meant that &quot;Think Tank&quot; was almost entirely written by Albarn. Its sound was seen as a testament to Albarn&#x27;s increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music, and to his complete control over the group&#x27;s creative direction. &quot;Think Tank&quot; was yet another UK number one and reached number 56 in the United States. It was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards. The band did a successful tour in 2003, with former Verve guitarist Simon Tong filling in for Coxon.

In 2005, XFM News reported that Blur would record an EP, and denied that they would hire a replacement guitarist for Coxon. There were also some aborted recordings made in 2005. Overall the band kept a low profile and did no studio or touring work as a three-piece. After Coxon significantly thawed on the subject of rejoining Blur, in 2007 band members announced that they would reunite, and that they intended to record together first in August, with the date later being pushed back to September, then October. Though the band members finally met up in October, they posted on their website that they had only &quot;met up for an enjoyable lunch&quot; and that there were no &quot;other music plans for Blur&quot;.

===Reunion performances, 2008–2015===
In December 2008, Blur announced they would reunite for a concert at London&#x27;s Hyde Park on 3 July 2009. Days later, the band added a second date, for 2 July. A series of June preview shows were also announced, ending at Manchester Evening News arena on the 26th. All the shows were well received; &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s music critic Alexis Petridis gave their performance at Goldsmiths college a full five stars, and wrote &quot;Blur&#x27;s music seems to have potentiated by the passing of years ... they sound both more frenetic and punky and more nuanced and exploratory than they did at the height of their fame&quot;. Blur headlined the Glastonbury Festival on 28 June, where they played for the first time since their headline slot in 1998. Reviews of the Glastonbury performance were enthusiastic; &quot;The Guardian&quot; called them &quot;the best Glastonbury headliners in an age&quot;. The band released their second greatest hits album &quot;&quot; on 15 June 2009.

Blur also headlined at other summer festivals, including Oxegen 2009 in Ireland, and the Scottish outdoor show of T in the Park. Their T in the Park headline slot was put in jeopardy after Graham Coxon was admitted to hospital with food poisoning. Ultimately, the band did play, albeit an hour and a half after they were scheduled to appear. After the completion of the reunion dates, James said the group had not discussed further plans, and Albarn told &quot;Q&quot; soon after that Blur had no intention of recording or touring again. He said, &quot;I just can&#x27;t do it anymore&quot;, and explained that the main motivation for participating in the reunion was to repair his relationship with Coxon, which he succeeded at. Coxon also said that no further Blur activity was planned, telling NME.com in September, &quot;We&#x27;re in touch and we say &#x27;Wotcha&#x27; and all that but nothing has been mentioned about any more shows or anything else&quot;.

In January 2010, &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot;, a documentary about the band, was released in cinemas and a month later on DVD. The same month, their 1994 album &quot;Parklife&quot; was one of ten classic album covers from British artists commemorated on a UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail; the collection was unveiled by Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page. In April 2010, Blur released their first new recording since 2003, &quot;Fool&#x27;s Day&quot;, for the Record Store Day event, as a vinyl record limited to 1000 copies; it was later made available as a free download on their website. &quot;No Distance Left to Run&quot; was nominated as Best Long Form Music Video for the 53rd Grammy Awards, Blur&#x27;s first-ever Grammy nomination.
In February 2012, Blur were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the 2012 Brit Awards. Later that month, Albarn and Coxon premiered a new track together live, &quot;Under the Westway&quot;. In April, the band announced that a box-set entitled &quot;Blur 21&quot;—containing all seven Blur studio albums, four discs of unreleased rarities and three DVDs—would be released in July. Blur had also entered the studio early that year to record material for a new album, but in May producer William Orbit told the &quot;NME&quot; that Albarn had halted recording. Blur&#x27;s official Twitter and Facebook pages announced that the band would release two singles &quot;The Puritan&quot; and &quot;Under the Westway&quot; on 2 July. That August, Blur headlined a show at Hyde Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. In 2013, the band performed at the Rock Werchter in Belgium, the Spanish and Portuguese dates of the Primavera Sound festival, and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the United States.

=== &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; and second hiatus, 2015–2022 ===
In April 2015, Blur released their first studio album in twelve years, &quot;The Magic Whip&quot;. Conceived over five days in Hong Kong after a cancelled Japan tour in 2013, the album was inspired by the city as well. &quot;There&#x27;s nothing pastoral about it&quot;, Albarn said, &quot;it&#x27;s very urban&quot;. &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; also marks the return of Coxon, absent on all but one track on &quot;Think Tank&quot;, and Stephen Street, Blur&#x27;s producer during the Britpop era.

&quot;The Magic Whip&quot; received positive reviews. Awarding the album a full five stars, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; called &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; &quot;a triumphant comeback that retains the band&#x27;s core identity while allowing ideas they&#x27;d fermented separately over the past decade to infuse their sound with mature and peculiar new flavour combinations&quot;. The &quot;NME&quot; concurred, saying Blur were &quot;a reunited band making music to rival their very best&quot;. It was also a commercial success, becoming the sixth consecutive Blur LP since &quot;Parklife&quot; (1994) to top the British charts. The &quot;Guardian&quot; also noted that at times during its first week of release, &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; sold &quot;more than the rest of the top five combined&quot;. &quot;The Magic Whip&quot; also became Blur&#x27;s highest charting album in the United States when it peaked at number 24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. That December &quot;New World Towers&quot;, a documentary on the recording process of &quot;The Magic Whip&quot;, was released in select British theatres.

Blur went on hiatus following the 2015 &quot;Magic Whip&quot; tour. They briefly reunited in March 2019 for a surprise performance at an Albarn-organized Africa Express event in London.

=== &quot;The Ballad of Darren,&quot; and second reunion, 2022–present ===

On 14 November 2022, Blur announced that they would perform at Wembley Stadium on 8 July 2023 – their first headline performance since 2015. On 10 February 2023, in line with the reunion, the band collaborated with clothing brand PLEASURES to release a line of items commemorating their 1997 album &quot;Blur&quot;.

On 18 May 2023, Blur released &quot;The Narcissist&quot;, the first single from their ninth studio album &quot;The Ballad of Darren&quot;. The next day, the band played their first concert in eight years on 19 May 2023 at the Colchester Arts Centre in Colchester. Following the warmup shows, Blur performed at Primavera Sound in Barcelona and Malahide Castle near Dublin. Blur headlined Wembley Stadium on 8 July and 9 July 2023, with Jockstrap, Sleaford Mods, and Self Esteem as the support acts for the first show, and The Selecter and Paul Weller as support acts for the second show. &quot;The Ballad of Darren&quot; was released on 21 July, and was preceded by the second single &quot;St. Charles Square&quot;. After the album&#x27;s release, the band performed at the Øyafestivalen in Oslo on 10 August, Way Out West in Gothenburg on 11 August, Flow Festival in Helsinki on 13 August and Summer Sonic Festival in Tokyo and Osaka on 19 and 20 August.

On 5 December, Albarn announced that Blur would enter another hiatus, saying, &quot;[It&#x27;s] time to wrap up this campaign. It’s too much for me.&quot; However, the band accepted a late night phone call offer to play 2024&#x27;s Coachella, with management giving them five minutes to decide, prompting Albarn to postpone the hiatus. Blur added a warm-up show at Pomona Fox Theater supported by Jockstrap on 10 April, the group&#x27;s first U.S. shows since 2015. The band&#x27;s first week Coachella performance on 13 April drew significant media attention for the lack of crowd interaction during &quot;Girls &amp; Boys&quot; and Albarn&#x27;s visible frustration. During the band&#x27;s second week Coachella performance on 20 April, Albarn said it was probably the band&#x27;s final show. In early May 2024, it was announced that July 2024 will see the release of a new documentary titled &quot;To the End&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Blur&#x27;s musical style has been described as Britpop, indie rock, alternative rock, art pop, pop rock, and art rock, with influences from indie rock and lo-fi. The band&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Think Tank&quot; moved into more of an electronic sound. Some of the band&#x27;s influences include David Bowie, Bobby Womack, William Onyeabor, the B-52&#x27;s, the Kinks, Pink Floyd, the Jam and Depeche Mode. In their days as Seymour, they were a &quot;shambolic&quot; avant-pop band, whose early concerts exhibited their art school background; meanwhile, Albarn &quot;took cues&quot; from Syd Barrett and Julian Cope.

<doc id="43008" wikidata="Q1120684" url="?curid=43008" title="Supergrass">
<text>Supergrass are an English rock band formed in 1993. For the majority of the band&#x27;s tenure, the line-up consisted of brothers Gaz (lead vocals, guitar) and Rob Coombes (keyboards), Mick Quinn (bass, backing vocals) and Danny Goffey (drums, backing vocals). Originally a three-piece, the band was officially joined by Rob Coombes in 2002.

The band signed to Parlophone Records in 1994 and produced &quot;I Should Coco&quot; (1995), the best-selling debut album for the label since the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Please Please Me&quot;. Their first album&#x27;s fourth single, &quot;Alright&quot;, was an international hit. The band went on to release five albums: &quot;In It for the Money&quot; (1997), &quot;Supergrass&quot; (1999), &quot;Life on Other Planets&quot; (2002), &quot;Road to Rouen&quot; (2005) and &quot;Diamond Hoo Ha&quot; (2008), as well as a compilation called &quot;Supergrass Is 10&quot; (2004).

In August 2009, the band signed to Cooking Vinyl and began work on their seventh studio album, &quot;Release the Drones&quot;. The album remains unreleased and unfinished. On 12 April 2010, the band announced that they were splitting up due to musical and creative differences. The group disbanded after four farewell gigs, the final one at La Cigale, Paris, on 11 June 2010.

The band reformed in 2019, initially to perform at Pilton Party followed by a &quot;secret&quot; gig at Oslo in Hackney, London. The band made their final appearance of their reunion to date with a performance in honour of Foo Fighters&#x27; recently deceased drummer Taylor Hawkins at his tribute concert in 2022, performing some of Hawkins&#x27; favourite songs from Supergrass&#x27;s catalogue. Hawkins had previously expressed his love of the band, and had even made a cameo drum appearance at one of their concerts.

The band announced a 2025 UK tour at the end of 2024 playing &quot;I Should Coco&quot; (for its 30th anniversary) in its entirety plus hits.

==History==
===The Jennifers and formation (1990–1993)===
At the age of 16 and 18 respectively and whilst attending Wheatley Park School just outside Oxford, Gaz Coombes and Danny Goffey were playing in the Jennifers along with Nick Goffey and Andy Davies. Danny and Nick Goffey are the sons of former BBC Top Gear presenter and motoring journalist Chris Goffey.

The Jennifers began building a reputation in the Oxford indie music scene, influenced by Ride, the Charlatans, Inspiral Carpets, the Kinks, the Who, and including traits of the shoegaze era. The band played gigs at various venues around Oxfordshire, often public houses and clubs. One pub the band played at was the Jericho Tavern in Oxford.

They sold a demo tape recorded and produced by Nick Langston at Stargoat Studios near Banbury. The demo featured three songs: &quot;Flying&quot;, which featured a 20-second countdown at the beginning, the recording of a rocket launch and then a fast guitar-based section which appeared to be influenced by the Stone Roses; &quot;Inside of Me&quot;, mostly similar in style but with a slower, funk-inflected jam at the end; and a guitar-based ballad simply titled &quot;(Slow Song)&quot; on the tape. The band enjoyed enough success to release one single in 1992, &quot;Just Got Back Today&quot;, on Nude Records, which is now a highly sought-after rarity. Second single, &quot;Tightrope&quot; was never released due to disagreements with Nude Records (but does appear on compilation CD &#x27;Days Spent Dreaming&#x27;), the band split up soon after this in the fall of 1992. Andy Davies went off to university and Nic Goffey went on to form a directing partnership with friend Dom Hawley, later directing many videos for Supergrass.

When Coombes began working at the local Harvester, he befriended co-worker Mick Quinn. The two realised they had common music interests and Coombes invited Quinn to come and jam with him and Goffey. In February 1993 they formed a band named Theodore Supergrass &quot;for about two months,&quot; according to Quinn, who explained, &quot;[T]hen we realized that Theodore was a bit rubbish so we took that off.&quot;

Goffey claims that the name was his idea and says, &quot;Although the others will dispute it, it was me. We were Theodore Supergrass and the idea was the band would be a little black character, and we wouldn&#x27;t ever have to do interviews. We&#x27;d get the questions in advance, script the answers and then animate Theodore Supergrass answering them. But it cost too much money.&quot;
Gaz&#x27;s brother, Rob Coombes, played flute for the band&#x27;s début gig at the Co-Op Hall, Oxford in 1993. In January 1995 he first performed as keyboardist with the band for a live Radio 1 John Peel session. His role in the band progressed over the years, post-I Should Coco material is credited to &quot;Supergrass and Rob Coombes&quot;, however, he wasn&#x27;t introduced as a band member until almost a decade later.

===Britpop years and stardom (1994–1998)===

In mid-1994, Supergrass issued their debut single &quot;Caught by the Fuzz&quot; on the small independent local label Backbeat Records. The song recounts lead singer and guitarist Gaz Coombes&#x27;s experience of being arrested by the police for possession of cannabis. The limited release of vinyl copies sold out quickly, thanks in part to support from John Peel on his Radio One show. The Parlophone label signed the band and re-released the single in the autumn of the same year. It achieved the rare feat of being both &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Single Of The Week&quot; status in the same week.

&quot;Mansize Rooster&quot;, released in February 1995, peaked at number 20 in the UK Singles Chart and &quot;Lenny&quot; was the band&#x27;s first top 10 single. &quot;Lenny&quot; was followed soon afterwards by the band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;I Should Coco&quot; (May 1995), which entered the UK Albums Chart at number one. It achieved half a million sales in the UK and over a million worldwide. &quot;NME&quot; reviewer Steve Sutherland gave the album a nine out of ten rating, writing, &quot;These freaks shall inherit the earth.&quot; The album&#x27;s fourth single, the double A-side release &quot;Alright&quot;/&quot;Time&quot;, stayed in the UK Top Three for a month, peaking at number two.

Supergrass followed &quot;I Should Coco&quot; with 18 months of heavy touring, appearing at festivals such as Scotland&#x27;s T in the Park and the Glastonbury Festival. After Performing at Rio&#x27;s &quot;Hollywood Rock Festival&quot; in April 1996, Supergrass met the train robber Ronnie Biggs, and he apparently said to them, &quot;I was frightened for my life when I heard there was a supergrass in the area.&quot; A photograph of Ronnie Biggs and Gaz together was subsequently included in the music video for their 1996 single &quot;Going Out&quot;. Recorded at Great Linford Manor the single peaked at number five in the UK chart, but was the last song produced by Sam Williams. Supergrass returned to Sawmills Studio to co-produce follow up album, &quot;In It for the Money&quot; (released April 1997), with John Cornfield. The album was a huge success and went platinum in the UK, but confused some fans expecting something similar to &quot;I Should Coco&quot;. The single, &quot;Richard III&quot;, reached number two. Subsequent releases, &quot;Sun Hits the Sky&quot; and &quot;Late in the Day&quot;, reached numbers 10 and 18 respectively.

Around this time Supergrass also appeared on the front cover of &quot;The Big Issue&quot;, interviewed for the magazine at Heathrow Airport by ex-drug smuggler Howard Marks.

===Further musical growth (1999–2004)===

The band again took a short break before returning in 1999 with the single &quot;Pumping on Your Stereo&quot;. The promo video, produced in conjunction with the Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop, featured the band with comical &quot;muppet&quot; bodies. The single generated welcome publicity following their time out of the limelight, as did a small sold-out tour scheduled around the single release, the final night of which was at Shepherd&#x27;s Bush Empire as part of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Five Night Stand&quot; festival. The single and the tour were followed by their third LP &quot;Supergrass&quot; (1999). The following spring the record was released in the US Once more, the album was recorded at Sawmills Studio with longtime associate Cornfield producing. &quot;Supergrass&quot; was well received critically and commercially and it has since gone platinum in the UK, but did not reap the same level of success as its predecessors. Critics claimed the album was &quot;hit and miss&quot;, which showed up particularly as the &quot;also-rans are surrounded by songs that are as great as anything Supergrass has ever recorded&quot;. Their next single, &quot;Moving&quot;, proved popular and reached the Top Ten in the UK. And their third single, &quot;Mary&quot; entered the Top 40. There followed a long hiatus.

After three years out of the limelight, the band returned with &quot;Life on Other Planets&quot; (September 2002), recorded at &quot;Heliocentric&quot;, &quot;Rockfield&quot; and &quot;Mayfair&quot; Studios and produced by Beck collaborator Tony Hoffer. The album was released in the UK on Parlophone, but in the US on the Island Def Jam imprint. The record was not as commercially successful as Supergrass&#x27;s first three albums, failing to make the Top Three in the UK albums chart. However, the critical response to the album was generally very positive, with Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic claiming &quot;The world is a better place for having Supergrass in it.&quot;. It has since gone gold in the UK. &quot;Life on Other Planets&quot; was also notable as it was the first Supergrass album to recognise Rob Coombes as an official member. For the band&#x27;s first three albums, Supergrass officially consisted of Gaz Coombes, Goffey and Quinn although Rob Coombes contributed to many of the band&#x27;s songs and videos, and toured with them. Tracks recorded before this were often credited to &quot;Supergrass and Rob Coombes&quot;. The band followed &quot;Life on Other Planets&quot; with another extended three-year hiatus, devoted to touring and personal engagements.

In June 2004 the band&#x27;s record company suggested the band release a singles compilation &quot;Supergrass Is 10&quot;, spawning two new self-produced tracks: &quot;Kiss of Life&quot; and &quot;Bullet&quot;. The companion DVD contained &quot;Home Movie&quot;, a humorous documentary charting the band&#x27;s first 10 years&#x27; achievements, made in collaboration with &quot;Seen the Light&quot; video director Simon Hilton. The record entered the UK albums chart at number four and has since gone gold in the UK.

===Development (2005–2008)===
Recording of their fifth studio album, &quot;Road to Rouen&quot;, began in France in a studio built by the band in Normandy. Working with French engineer Pierre-Olivier Marger and it represented a significant change in direction and was perceived as a more mature body of work.

&quot;St. Petersburg&quot;, the string-laden first single, was released on 8 August 2005. The album followed a week later (released 27 September in North America) and reached No. 9 on the UK chart, going on to achieve silver status in the UK. Opinion at the time was divided, but the album garnered the band many new fans and a measure of creative respect, some even embracing it as &quot;the sound of a band at last hitting their stride&quot;.

Second single, &quot;Low C&quot;, featured a video by acclaimed &quot;Pumping On Your Stereo&quot; video director Garth Jennings, shot in Weeki Wachee Springs Florida. Third single &quot;Fin&quot;, interpreted as a missive to the Coombes brothers&#x27; recently deceased mother, received much critical praise, &quot;The Guardian&quot; referring to it as &quot;so gorgeously light and airy that listening to it is like sleepwalking in space&quot;.

The band toured the songs in both acoustic and electric formats with percussionist Satin Singh joining the live band throughout. From August 2005 to September 2006 they performed in Japan, South America, the United States, and Europe, finishing with a memorable gig at the Beijing Pop Festival.

The follow-up album, &quot;Diamond Hoo Ha&quot; was recorded at Hansa Tonstudio, Berlin, with producer
Nick Launay, and mixed at Seedy Underbelly Studios in Los Angeles. The band toured in the summer of 2007, headlining Guilfest, among others, and debuting new material, with the youngest sibling of the Coombes brothers, ex-22-20s keyboardist Charly, on second guitar, percussion and backing vocals.

On 27 September 2007, bassist Mick Quinn sustained a broken heel bone and two spinal fractures in a sleepwalking accident whilst on holiday in France (Quinn sleepwalked out of a first floor window of the villa he was staying at in the South of France.). 
During his recuperation, Gaz and Danny promoted first single &quot;Diamond Hoo Ha Man&quot; as the Diamond Hoo Ha Men, with a run of small club shows in December and January. To celebrate the single release, Mick Quinn appeared as Diamond Hoo Ha Man &quot;Biff Hymenn&quot; at the Apple Store, Regent Street, London, marking his return to touring duties on 15 January. Charly directed &quot;Glange Fever&quot; (under pseudonym &quot;Chas Harrison&quot;) a rockumentary which followed their exploits.

For a handful of &quot;full band&quot; Supergrass dates on the Diamond Hoo Ha tour (as opposed to Gaz &amp; Danny as the Diamond Hoo Ha Men duo), Charly Coombes filled in for Mick Quinn on bass while he recovered from his injuries.
When Mick recovered &amp; returned to the band, Charly remained with them on second guitar &amp; percussion (as per his work on the record) for the rest of the tour.

In February 2008, the video of their second single &quot;Bad Blood&quot; was released on the band&#x27;s official web-site, winning Best Rock Video at the UK Music Video Awards, and the single followed on 17 March.

In 2008, Parlophone was taken over by venture capitalist group, Terra Firma, and Supergrass ended their contract with the label. &quot;Rebel In You&quot;, final single from the &quot;Diamond Hoo Ha&quot; album, was released, under licence from Parlophone, on the band&#x27;s own imprint, Supergrass Records.

===Independent career and split (2009–2010)===
The band headlined Wychwood Festival on 30 May and also Sellindge Music Festival (6 June), Provinssirock Festival (13 June) and a short European trek in July at BBK Live (10 July) at Bilbao, Bikini Festival (11 July) in Toulouse, Festival Les Ardentes (12 July) in Liège (Belgium) and Paredes de Coura Festival (30 July) in Portugal. There was also a co-headlining date at 2009&#x27;s Truck Festival along with Ash, on 25–26 July at Hill Farm in Steventon, Oxfordshire.

On 12 April 2010, the band announced they were to split up after a series of four farewell shows, with their final gig in Paris on 11 June 2010.

At the time of the split, Supergrass were working on their seventh studio album, tentatively titled &quot;Release the Drones&quot;. In early 2010, the band revealed that the album had been influenced by krautrock bands such as Can, and drone music, and that the members had swapped instruments on several tracks during its recording. Coombes said of the approach to the album: &quot;This record&#x27;s actually been very collaborative. It&#x27;s been cool to try something different and chaotic.&quot; Coombes stated that the album was &quot;nearly finished&quot;, and it was scheduled for release in May. The album remains unfinished and unreleased.

===Reformation (2019–present)===

In July 2019, it was reported in the press that the band were to reform and play at Pilton Party on 6 September 2019. On 22 August 2019, the Twitter account Secretglasto posted &quot;We&#x27;re not going to Grass up the special guest at the Pilton Party, but we&#x27;re pretty sure they&#x27;ll be Super.&quot; In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot;, the band confirmed they are not going to be working on new material, with Goffey stating that &quot;the positive vibe of playing together would be compromised by going into a studio for ages&quot; and that &quot;the idea is to play gigs, not create more music&quot;. Gaz Coombes told &quot;Q&quot; that he was prepared to give a year up to perform with Supergrass, but was wary of promising to make new music.

After performing two warm up shows at The Empire in Coventry and the Cheese &amp; Grain in Frome the band embarked on a short European tour visiting France, Belgium and The Netherlands before doing a full UK tour finishing with two sold-out shows at Alexandra Palace, London on 7 March.

The band were due to tour across America and Australia in April and May 2020 as well as festival appearances in Norway, Italy, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK (which would have also included their 5th appearance at Glastonbury) but all were cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite the tour&#x27;s cancellation, Supergrass still managed to perform a live-streamed gig on 21 August at The Bullingdon in their hometown of Oxford. The show was a collaboration with Goose Island Brewery and served as a launch event for the new Supergrass-inspired beer Man Sized Brew Sir, which was named after the band&#x27;s song &quot;Mansize Rooster&quot;. Ticket proceeds for the event went to the Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy Charity and the band&#x27;s charity of choice, the suicide prevention charity CALM. The band also played a socially-distanced show at the Virgin Money Unity Arena in Newcastle the next day.

On 27 November, Supergrass released &quot;Live on Other Planets&quot;, a live album consisting of songs recorded at various dates on their recent reunion tour. The album was released to mark the band&#x27;s 25th anniversary; to capture the reunion gigs and thank the fans who attended; and to support grassroots music venues, with proceeds from the album&#x27;s sales going to the #SaveOurVenues campaign in aid of venues struggling due to the pandemic.

On 3 September 2022 the band performed a 3-song set at the Taylor Hawkins Tribute Concert at Wembley Stadium. Gaz Coombes also took lead vocal duties on covers of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Modern Love&quot; (performed with Nile Rodgers) and the Police&#x27;s &quot;Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic&quot; (performed with Foo Fighters alongside Stewart Copeland on drums). Following the performance, Gaz Coombes confirmed on his social media that it was the band&#x27;s &quot;final Supergrass reunion show&quot;. &quot;I want to thank all you [Supergrass] fans for the love and incredible support you&#x27;ve shown us over the last three years,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It&#x27;s been a blast.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Coombes announced a return to his solo career – as did Goffey, who confirmed the band&#x27;s hiatus to &quot;NME&quot;. &quot;Gaz is gonna do something himself, and I&#x27;ve got this thing coming up, so we&#x27;ll give it a rest for six months and then we’ll see,&quot; he said.

On 16 September 2024, the band reunited to play a 30th Anniversary tour of &quot;I Should Coco&quot;, in May 2025.

==Solo projects==
During 1998, Coombes and Quinn were invited to play on Dr John&#x27;s &quot;Anutha Zone&quot; album (they appear on the track &quot;Voices In My Head&quot;), whilst Goffey contributed to the debut album by Lodger (which also featured his partner Pearl Lowe and members of the band Delicatessen).

Danny Goffey has also embarked on a solo project between Supergrass engagements called &quot;Van Goffey&quot; which saw tracks being released via MySpace in August 2006, the first three being &quot;Crack House Blues&quot;, &quot;I Feel so Gaye&quot; and &quot;Natalie Loves the F&quot;. He plays drums on the charity football song &quot;Born In England&quot; by a collective of musicians called Twisted X, which charted at number 8 in the UK Charts in 2004. Danny Goffey was also a drummer on the 2004 charity single &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;, along with members of Radiohead and the Darkness under the name Band Aid 20.

In July 2008, Coombes joined Foo Fighters on stage during a show that saluted the Who&#x27;s musical career, VH1 Rock Honors. Coombes performed vocals on the Who&#x27;s classic song &quot;Bargain&quot;.

In 2007 and 2008, while Mick Quinn was still recuperating from his injury, Danny Goffey and Gaz Coombes were performing as the duo Diamond Hoo Ha Men, the name taken from the band&#x27;s sixth album and its lead single (see above). They appeared in character as Duke Diamond and Randy Hoo Ha to play gigs at small venues. Gigs included an appearance at the Apple Store on London&#x27;s Regent Street, which featured Mick Quinn&#x27;s first appearance in the band since his injury. He appeared on stage introduced by Gaz as Biff Hymen.

Goffey and Coombes were members of side-project the Hotrats (originally the Hot Rats). They released an album of covers produced by Nigel Godrich called &quot;Turn Ons&quot; on 25 January 2010. A cover of &quot;Drive My Car&quot; by the Beatles appears in an advert for Orange, a fragrance by Hugo Boss. Since Supergrass announced they were to split, the Hotrats have joined with Air to perform &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; live for the first time, over several concert dates. A deluxe 3CD / 1DVD box-set of the Hot Rats album was scheduled for release in June 2020.

In May 2010, Mick Quinn formed the DB Band with former Shake Appeal bassist Fab Wilson. The band released their first EP &quot;Stranger in the Alps&quot; on 17 September 2011. They have toured the Netherlands, France and appeared at Oxford&#x27;s Truck Festival in Steventon.

Gaz Coombes completed his first solo album, &quot;Here Come the Bombs&quot;, at his home studio in Oxford. The album was recorded with Sam Williams, who produced 1995&#x27;s &quot;I Should Coco&quot; for Supergrass, and released on 21 May 2012. Coombes&#x27; second album, &quot;Matador&quot;, was released 26 January 2015, charting at No. 18 on the UK Albums Chart and nominated for the 2015 Mercury Music Prize. Coombes released a third studio album, titled &quot;World&#x27;s Strongest Man&quot; on Caroline Records in 2018.

In 2015, Mick Quinn began playing as touring bassist for Swervedriver, whose members Adam Franklin and Jimmy Hartridge were childhood friends of his in Oxford. He would eventually join the band as a full member in 2017, appearing on the band&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Future Ruins&quot;.

<text>Eunice Mary Kennedy Shriver (July 10, 1921 – August 11, 2009) was an American philanthropist. Shriver was a member of the Kennedy family by birth, and a member of the Shriver family through her marriage to Sargent Shriver, who was the United States Ambassador to France and the final Democratic nominee for Vice President of the United States in 1972. She was a sister of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, U.S. Senators Robert F. Kennedy and Edward Kennedy, and U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith. 

Shriver was the founder of the Special Olympics, a sports organization for persons with intellectual disabilities. For her efforts on behalf of disabled people, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1984.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Eunice Mary Kennedy was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on July 10, 1921. She was the fifth of nine children of Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., and Rose Fitzgerald. Her siblings included U.S. President and Senator John F. Kennedy, U.S. Attorney General and U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy, U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy, and U.S. Ambassador to Ireland Jean Kennedy Smith.

Eunice was educated at the Convent of the Sacred Heart School in Noroton, Connecticut, and Manhattanville College. She studied at Stanford University where she competed on the swimming and track and field teams. After graduating from Stanford in 1943 with a Bachelor of Science degree in sociology, she moved to Washington, D.C. and worked for the Special War Problems Division of the U.S. State Department. Kennedy eventually moved to the U.S. Justice Department as executive secretary for a project dealing with juvenile delinquency. During her time in Washington, she shared a townhouse in Georgetown with her brother John, then a U.S. Congressman. Kennedy served as a social worker at the Federal Industrial Institution for Women for one year before moving to Chicago in 1951 to work with the House of the Good Shepherd women&#x27;s shelter and Chicago Juvenile Court.

==Charity work and awards==


Shriver became executive vice president of the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation in 1957. She shifted the organization&#x27;s focus from Catholic charities to research on the causes of intellectual disabilities, and humane ways to treat them. This interest eventually culminated in, among other things, the Special Olympics movement.

A long-time advocate for children&#x27;s health and disability issues, Shriver championed the creation of the President&#x27;s Panel on Mental Retardation in 1961. The panel was significant in the movement from institutionalization to community integration in the U.S. and throughout the world. Shriver was a key founder of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), a part of the National Institutes of Health in 1962.

In 1962, Shriver founded Camp Shriver, a summer day camp for children and adults with intellectual disabilities at her Maryland farm to explore their capabilities in a variety of sports and physical activities. From that camp came the concept of Special Olympics. Shriver founded the Special Olympics in 1968. That year, the Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. Foundation helped to plan and fund the First International Special Olympics Summer Games, held in Chicago&#x27;s Soldier Field where 1,000 athletes with intellectual disabilities from 26 states and Canada competed. In her speech at the opening ceremony, Shriver said, &quot;The Chicago Special Olympics prove a very fundamental fact, the fact that exceptional children — children with mental retardation — can be exceptional athletes, the fact that through sports they can realize their potential for growth.&quot; Special Olympics Inc. was established as a nonprofit charity in 1968; since that time, nearly three million athletes have participated.

In 1969, Shriver moved to France and pursued her interest in intellectual disability there. She started organizing small activities with Paris organizations, mostly reaching out to families of kids who had special needs to provide activities for them, laying the foundation for a robust international expansion of the Special Olympics in the late 1970s and 1980s.

In 1982, Shriver founded the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Center for Community of Caring at University of Utah, Salt Lake City. The Community is a &quot;grades K-12, whole school, comprehensive character education program with a focus on disabilities... adopted by almost 1,200 schools nationwide and in Canada&quot;.

Shriver was awarded the nation&#x27;s highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1984 by U.S. President Ronald Reagan for her work on behalf of persons with disabilities. In 1988, she received the Laetare Medal, considered the highest award for American Catholics, by the University of Notre Dame. In 1990 Shriver was awarded the Eagle Award from the United States Sports Academy. The Eagle Award is the academy&#x27;s highest international honor and was awarded to Shriver for her significant contributions to international sport.

In 1992, Shriver received the Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service Benefiting the Disadvantaged, an award given out annually by the Jefferson Awards for Public Service.

For her work in nationalizing the Special Olympics, Shriver received the Civitan International World Citizenship Award. Her advocacy on this issue has also earned her other awards and recognitions, including honorary degrees from numerous universities. She is the second American and only woman to appear on a US coin while still living. Her portrait is on the obverse of the 1995 commemorative silver dollar honoring the Special Olympics. On the reverse is the quotation attributed to Shriver, &quot;As we hope for the best in them, hope is reborn in us.&quot;

In 1998, Shriver was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

Shriver received the 2002 Theodore Roosevelt Award (the Teddy), an annual award given by the National Collegiate Athletic Association to a graduate from an NCAA member institution who earned a varsity letter in college for participation in intercollegiate athletics, and who ultimately became a distinguished citizen of national reputation based on outstanding life accomplishment. In addition to the Teddy recognition, she was selected in 2006 as part of the NCAA Centennial celebration as one of the 100 most-influential individuals in its first century; she was listed ninth. In 2006, she received a papal knighthood from Pope Benedict XVI, being made a Dame of the Order of St. Gregory the Great (DSG). Her mother had been created a papal countess in 1950 by Pope Pius XII.

In 2008, she received the Foremother Award from the National Center for Health Research for her lifetime achievements.

In 2008, the U.S. Congress changed the NICHD&#x27;s name to the &quot;Eunice Kennedy Shriver&quot; National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. In December 2008, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; named Shriver the first recipient of Sportsman of the Year Legacy Award. On May 9, 2009, the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery (NPG) in Washington, D.C., unveiled an historic portrait of her, the first portrait the NPG has ever commissioned of an individual who had not served as a U.S. president or First Lady. The portrait depicts her with four Special Olympics athletes (including Loretta Claiborne) and one Best Buddies participant. It was painted by David Lenz, the winner of the Outwin Boochever Portrait Competition in 2006. As part of the Portrait Competition prize, the NPG commissioned a work from the winning artist to depict a living subject for the collection. Lenz, whose son, Sam, has Down syndrome and is an enthusiastic Special Olympics athlete, was inspired by Shriver&#x27;s dedication to working with people with intellectual disabilities.

Shriver became involved with Dorothy Hamill&#x27;s special skating program in the Special Olympics after Hamill&#x27;s Olympic Games ice-skating win. In September 2010, the State University of New York at Brockport, home of the 1979 Special Olympics, renamed its football stadium the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Stadium.

In July 2017, Shriver posthumously received the Arthur Ashe Courage Award at the 2017 ESPY Awards.

==Political involvement==
Shriver actively campaigned for her elder brother, John, during his successful 1960 U.S. presidential election.

Although Shriver was a Democrat, she was a vocal supporter of the anti-abortion movement. In 1990, Shriver wrote a letter to &quot;The New York Times&quot; denouncing an abortion rights group for having used a quotation of President Kennedy&#x27;s words out of context in support of their position. Shriver was one of several prominent Democrats – including Governor Robert P. Casey of Pennsylvania and Bishop Austin Vaughan of New York – who took out a full-page &quot;The New York Times&quot; advertisement opposing &quot;abortion on demand&quot; during the 1992 Democratic Convention (the Party adopted a 1992 platform that emphasized its support for abortion rights). Shriver was a supporter of several anti-abortion organizations: Feminists for Life of America, the Susan B. Anthony List, and Democrats for Life of America.

Despite being a Democrat, Shriver supported her Republican son-in-law Arnold Schwarzenegger&#x27;s successful 2003 Governor of California election.

On January 28, 2008, aged 86, Shriver was present at American University in Washington, D.C., when her brother, U.S. Senator Edward M. Kennedy, announced his endorsement of Barack Obama&#x27;s 2008 Democratic U.S. presidential campaign.

==Personal life==

On May 23, 1953, aged 31, Shriver married Sargent Shriver in a Roman Catholic ceremony at Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City. Her husband served as the U.S. ambassador to France from 1968 to 1970 and was the 1972 Democratic U.S. vice presidential candidate (with George McGovern as the candidate for U.S. President). They had five children: Robert Sargent Shriver III, Maria Owings Shriver (Schwarzenegger), Timothy Perry Shriver, Mark Kennedy Shriver, and Anthony Paul Kennedy Shriver. Shriver had nineteen grandchildren at the time of her death.

She had a close relationship with her sister Rosemary Kennedy, who was intellectually disabled and who became incapacitated due to a lobotomy. Shriver suffered a stroke and broken hip in 2005. On November 18, 2007, aged 86, she was admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she spent several weeks.

===Death===
On August 7, 2009, Shriver was admitted to Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Massachusetts with an undisclosed ailment. On August 10, her relatives were called to the hospital. She died at the hospital the next day at the age of 88, two weeks before her brother, Senator Ted Kennedy, died on August 25, 2009, at the age of 77.

Shriver&#x27;s family issued a statement upon her death, reading in part:

President Barack Obama remarked after Shriver&#x27;s death that she was &quot;an extraordinary woman who, as much as anyone, taught our nation—and our world—that no physical or mental barrier can restrain the power of the human spirit.&quot;

===Funeral and burial===
On August 14, 2009, an invitation-only Requiem Mass was celebrated for Shriver at St. Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church in Hyannis. Following the Requiem Mass, she was buried at the St. Francis Xavier parish cemetery in nearby Centerville, Massachusetts. Pope Benedict XVI sent a letter of condolence to her family. Because her brother Ted had terminal brain cancer, he was unable to attend the funeral, and their sister Jean Kennedy Smith stayed with him. Ted died two weeks later, leaving Jean as the sole surviving child of Joseph and Rose Kennedy until her death on June 17, 2020, at the age of 92.

<text>John Lingard (5 February 1771 – 17 July 1851) was an English Catholic priest and historian, the author of &quot;The History of England, From the First Invasion by the Romans to the Accession of Henry VIII&quot;, an eight-volume work published in 1819. Lingard was a teacher at the English College at Douai, and at the seminary at Crook Hall, and later St. Cuthbert&#x27;s College. In 1811 he retired to Hornby in Lancashire to continue work on his writing.

Though Lingard was accorded no recognition by the British intellectual establishment and is no longer popular as an historian, his contribution to historical method came at a critical point in British intellectual history. That he was also a Catholic priest, in a turbulent time for the Church in England, makes that contribution all the more interesting.

==Biography==
Born in 1771 in St Thomas Street in central Winchester to recusant parents, John Lingard was the son of John and Elizabeth Rennell Lingard. His mother was from an old Catholic family who had been persecuted for their beliefs; his father was, by trade, a carpenter, who had converted to Catholicism upon his marriage. They each migrated from their native Claxby in Lincolnshire, first to London, where they met once again and married, then, after a short return to their old home, to Winchester, where he was born.

Bishop Challoner recommended the young John Lingard for a &quot;burse&quot; at the English College at Douai, France. He entered the college in September 1782, to commence training for the priesthood. At the English College, he excelled in the humanities before beginning the study of theology. At the end of his course in philosophy he was retained as professor of grammar at one of the lower schools. Narrowly escaping attacks by mobs at the time of the French Revolution upon the declaration of war between the Kingdom of Great Britain and France, he returned to England in 1793 in charge of two brothers named Oliveira and of William, afterwards Lord Stourton. For nearly a year, he was tutor to young Stourton at Baron Stourton&#x27;s residence near York.
When Lingard learned that a number of his students from Douai had made it to Arthur Storey&#x27;s school in Tudhoe, he asked leave of the Baron to join them, which was granted.

In 1792 Thomas Eyre was appointed to the mission of Pontop Hall, near Lanchester, County Durham. In 1794 Bishop William Gibson asked Eyre to take charge of the Northern students who had been expelled from Douai, and who were then temporarily at Tudhoe under John Lingard. Eyre relocated Lingard and his students to Pontop Hall, and then later to Crook Hall, all within a few miles of Durham. Nominally Lingard held the chair of philosophy; practically, besides the duties of vice-president to Eyre, he undertook in addition those of prefect of studies, procurator, and of professor of Church history.

Lingard concluded his theological studies and was ordained at York in April 1795. In 1805, he wrote a series of letters which, after their publication in a periodical, were collected as &quot;Catholic Loyalty Vindicated&quot;. In 1806 the first edition of &quot;The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church&quot; appeared, a development of his informal lectures. He remained at Crook Hall for fourteen years until, in 1808, the seminary moved to St. Cuthbert&#x27;s College. Lingard donated a stained glass window to St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Chapel at Ushaw.
Upon the death of Eyre in 1810, Lingard, having continued as vice-president, governed the college, at the same time teaching theology. In 1811, he retired to take charge of the secluded mission at Hornby, in Lancashire, spending most of the rest of his life there. Devoting himself to his study and writing, he was well liked as a quiet and gentle man by the residents. He was offered the presidency of St Patrick&#x27;s College, Maynooth and of Old Hall Green, but declined both.

In 1819, the first three volumes of &quot;The History of England&quot; was published. Volume I was originally intended as textbook for schools. In 1821, Pope Pius VIII created Lingard a doctor of Divinity. A fourth volume followed in 1823, bringing the history up to the reign of Edward VI. He built St. Mary&#x27;s Church with the proceeds from volume IV of the &quot;History of England&quot;. Lingard would refer to it in jest as &quot;Henry VIII&#x27;s Chapel&quot;. (The church is a Grade II listed building.) When he traveled to Rome for research in 1825, Pope Leo XII presented him with a gold medal. Subsequent volumes appeared at intervals until he completed the work in 1849.

Lingard died at Hornby on 17 July 1851 at the age of eighty-one. He was buried, at his request, in the cloister of the college cemetery at Ushaw.

==Writing==
===&quot;The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church&quot;===
&quot;The Antiquities of the Anglo-Saxon Church&quot; arose from a series of informal talks Lingard gave at Ushaw. They were compiled and edited, and published at Newcastle in 1806. Lingard emphasized that he drew his information wherever possible from original works. He demonstrated that the church in England grew contemporaneously with expanding political structures, and that the institutional structure of the church planted by Augustine of Canterbury developed within the politico-social environment of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Lingard argued that &quot;...By preserving the use of the Latin tongue, they imposed on the clergy the necessity of study, kept alive the spirit of improvement, and transmitted to future generations the writings of the classics, and the monuments of profane and ecclesiastical history.&quot; In his discussion of saints and their holy books, Lingard implies a continuity between the Anglo-Saxon Christians and the English Roman Catholics of his own day, some of whom retained custody of the ancient manuscripts. The section regarding Ecgberht of Ripon, Willibrord, and Boniface suggests that a number of practices and traditions many of his contemporaries would regard as &quot;Romish&quot; were actually exported to the continent by Englishmen. By drawing a connection between Anglo-Saxon Christians and nineteenth century Roman Catholics he sought to show that the latter were not only good Christians, but also good and loyal Englishmen.

===&quot;The History of England&quot;===
The principal object of his major work, &quot;The History of England&quot;, is to emphasise the disastrous effects of the Reformation. A substantial scholarly work which gave full treatment to the history of England, the book was later expanded by the author and the title changed to reflect the period covered. As each additional volume appeared the &quot;History&quot; reputation increased, while Lingard continued to revise and improve the whole work. Most of the earnings from this project and his other writings were directed towards the educating of students to the priesthood.

In his style and presentation of English history, Lingard demonstrates the prevalent manner of Catholic scholarship – he gives, for example, no indication that he is a priest on the title page, and professes emphatically to be writing an impartial history. But in a curious turnaround, his &quot;History&quot; by its very impartiality is a Catholic apologetic, and Lingard&#x27;s desire for impartiality is a reflection of the Catholic political and intellectual situation in the Emancipation era.

The Catholic position in the early nineteenth century, politically speaking, was that of a minority body, allied to the Whig-Radical-Dissenting political grouping, and seeking religious and political freedom. This alliance encouraged Old Catholic intellectuals to present their arguments in &#x27;liberal&#x27; and &#x27;reasonable&#x27; form – the argumentative advantage in this being that it presented Catholics as enlightened and tolerant, and their opposition as prejudiced and bigoted.

Lingard himself argued that one of his chief duties as an historian was: &quot;to weigh with care the value of the authorities on which I rely, and to watch with jealousy the secret workings of my own personal feelings and prepossessions. Such vigilance is a matter of necessity to every writer of history ... Otherwise, he will be continually tempted to make an unfair use of the privilege of the historian; he will sacrifice the interests of truth to the interests of party, national, or religious, or political.&quot; (J. Lingard, &quot;History of England&quot;, vol 1, 6th edition, London: Charles Dolman, 1854, p. 6.)

Lingard adopted a non-controversial and sober approach to history with the emphasis on incontrovertible fact and using primary rather than secondary sources.
In the History, Lingard faces the task of convincing Protestants of the fundamental truths of the Catholic faith, while maintaining an unbiased presentation of historical truth. He possesses little sense of &quot;preaching to the converted&quot; (in a very literal sense), and aims his work more at influencing Protestants than placating his Ultramontane opposition. In a letter of 18 December 1819, Lingard wrote: &quot;... my only chance of being read by Protestants depends upon my having the reputation of a temperate writer. The good to be done is by writing a book which Protestants will read.&quot; (Lingard to Kirke, in Haile, Bonney, Life and Letters of John Lingard, 1771–1851, London: 1912, pp 166–67).

Lingard&#x27;s History is also an apt demonstration of the advantages a Catholic historian of the time may have had, in terms of impartiality. Lingard&#x27;s religion had to a large extent isolated him from the mainstream nationalism which surrounded Protestant historians, as well as from the growing &quot;providentialist&quot; concept of history. Lingard&#x27;s strength of argument, however, continued to be popular, and the influence of Protestant animosity for Catholic apologetic also led him to develop a keen critical judgement. He was devoted to absolute accuracy and detail and the History was a groundbreaking work in its use of primary sources. Lingard made extensive use of Vatican archives and French, Italian, Spanish and English dispatches, document collections and state papers – the first British historian to do so. The peripheral nature of English Catholicism put him in a position of &quot;outside observer&quot; to much of English intellectual culture, and this is reflected in his historical works. Despite this distancing effect, however, Lingard maintained an active interest in politics all his life and was a noted pamphleteer.

The edition that is usually seen is a 10 volume set, &quot;to the Accession of William and Mary in 1688.&quot; There is an enlarged 13 volume set published just before Lingard&#x27;s death which was his final revision, &quot;to the Commencement of the Reign of William the Third.&quot; The History was abridged and revised adding material to bring its treatment up to the then present and used as a text in English Catholic schools during the nineteenth century.

William Cobbett also used the work as an unbiased reference source for his own &quot;History of the Protestant Reformation&quot; in which he puts forward the argument that the reformation had disastrous consequences for the ordinary people of England. His work would in turn be influential in the passage of the Catholic emancipation bill by preparing the way for public acceptance and the minimisation of sectarian violence.

===Gospel translation===
Lesser known than Lingard&#x27;s historical works is his anonymously published translation of the Four Gospels in 1836. The title page reads simply that the work is &quot;by a Catholic.&quot; Lingard departed from usual Catholic practice by using early Greek manuscripts rather than the Latin Vulgate as the principal basis for the translation. This resulted in such renderings as &quot;repent&quot; rather than &quot;do penance&quot; (Matt 3:2). His willingness to depart from Catholic custom contrasts with his contempt for the Protestant concept of &quot;private interpretation&quot; of Scripture. In a note to John 1:1, he states, &quot;Hence it happens that men of every persuasion find confirmation of their peculiar opinions in the sacred volumes: for, in fact, it is not the Scripture that informs them, but that they affix their own meaning to the language of Scripture.&quot;

The work influenced Francis P. Kenrick (1796–1863), Roman Catholic Bishop of Philadelphia, and later Archbishop of Baltimore, who published his own translation of the Four Gospels in 1849. By 1851, Lingard felt sufficiently confident to publish a new edition of his Four Gospels in his own name.

Lingard also authored the very popular Catholic hymn to the Virgin Mary titled Hail Queen of Heaven, the Ocean Star, loosely based on the medieval Latin plainchant Ave maris stella. J. Vincent Higginson described it as &quot;one of the oldest English vernacular hymns commonly found in Catholic hymnals.&quot;

==Honours==
In 1821 Pope Pius VII honoured Lingard with a triple doctorate – in theology, canon law and civil law – and a few years later Leo XII conferred upon him a gold medal generally only given to cardinals and princes. There is even strong evidence that he was made a cardinal &quot;in pectore&quot; (&quot;in the breast&quot;) in 1826. This meant that the Pope could have announced the appointment publicly at some future time.

<doc id="43017" wikidata="Q650583" url="?curid=43017" title="Gruinard Island">
<text>Gruinard Island ( ;
) is a small, oval-shaped Scottish island approximately long by wide, located in Gruinard Bay, about halfway between Gairloch and Ullapool. At its closest point to the mainland, it is about offshore. In 1942, the island became a sacrifice zone,&lt;ref name=&quot;newstatesman/ai-odh&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and was dangerous for all mammals after military experiments with the anthrax bacterium, until it was decontaminated in 1990.

==Early history==
The island was mentioned by Dean Munro who travelled the area in the mid-16th century. He wrote that it was Clan MacKenzie territory, &quot;full of woods&quot; (it is treeless today), and that it was &quot;guid for fostering of thieves and rebellis&quot;.

Historically, the counties of Ross-shire and Cromartyshire have both laid claim to Gruinard Island due to the position of the island in between Gairloch and Ullapool. In the late 1780s, the villages became substantial fishing and sheep farming communities leading Gruinard Island to be utilized as an area of land for grazing sheep or as a small dock for fishing. By 1881, the population on the island was 6, soon becoming uninhabited with no record detailing any established population.

In 1926, Rosalynd Maitland purchased the Eilean Darach estate which included Gruinard Island. Rosalynd Maitland bequeathed the island to her niece Molly Dunphie who was friends with Winston Churchill.

==Biological warfare testing==
In 1942, during World War II, a biological warfare test was carried out on Gruinard by scientists from the Biology Department of Porton Down. The test was conducted as part of Operation Vegetarian, an ultimately unused plan which called for the dispersal of linseed cakes spiked with anthrax across the German countryside. It was recognised that tests would cause long-lasting contamination of the immediate area by anthrax spores, so a remote and uninhabited island was required. Gruinard was surveyed, deemed suitable, and requisitioned from its owners by the British government. Porton Down meteorologist Sir Oliver Graham Sutton was put in charge of a fifty-man team to conduct the trial, with David Willis Wilson Henderson in charge of the germ bomb. Biology Department head Paul Fildes made frequent visits.

The anthrax strain chosen was a highly virulent type called &quot;Vollum 14578&quot;, named after R. L. Vollum, Professor of Bacteriology at the University of Oxford, who supplied it. Eighty sheep were taken to the island and bombs filled with anthrax spores were detonated close to where selected groups were tethered. The sheep became infected with anthrax and began to die within days of exposure.

Some of the experiments were recorded on 16 mm colour movie film, which was declassified in 1997. One sequence shows the detonation of an anthrax bomb fixed at the end of a tall pole supported with guy ropes. After the bomb explodes, a brownish aerosol cloud drifts away towards the target animals. A later sequence shows anthrax-infected sheep carcasses being burned in incinerators at the end of the experiment. After the tests were completed, scientists concluded that a large release of anthrax spores would thoroughly pollute German cities, rendering them uninhabitable for decades afterwards. Those conclusions were supported by the inability to decontaminate the island after the experiment—the spores were sufficiently durable to resist any efforts at decontamination.

In 1945, when the island&#x27;s owner sought its return, the Ministry of Supply recognised that the island was contaminated, and so could not be de-requisitioned until it was deemed safe. In 1946, the government agreed to acquire the island and to take responsibility for it. The owner or their heirs would be able to repurchase the island for £500 when it was declared &quot;fit for habitation by man and beast&quot;. For many years, it was judged too hazardous and expensive to decontaminate the island sufficiently to allow public access, and Gruinard Island was quarantined indefinitely. Visits to the island were prohibited, except for periodic checks by Porton Down personnel to determine the level of contamination.

==Operation Dark Harvest==
In 1981 newspapers began receiving messages with the heading &quot;Operation Dark Harvest&quot; which demanded that the government decontaminate the island, and reported that a &quot;team of microbiologists from two universities&quot; had landed on the island with the aid of local people and collected of soil.

The group threatened to leave samples of the soil &quot;at appropriate points that will ensure the rapid loss of indifference of the government and the equally rapid education of the general public&quot;. The same day a sealed package of soil was left outside the military research facility at Porton Down; tests revealed that it contained anthrax bacilli. A few days later another sealed package of soil was left in Blackpool, where the governing Conservative Party was holding its annual conference. The soil did not contain anthrax, but officials said that the soil was similar to that found on the island.

==Decontamination==
Starting in 1986 a determined effort was made to decontaminate Gruinard Island, 280 tonnes of formaldehyde solution diluted in sea water was sprayed over all 485 acres (196 hectares) of the island and the worst-contaminated topsoil around the dispersal site was removed. Run-off from the formaldehyde seeped into the ocean and slowly led to the destruction of intertidal organisms such as barnacles, crustaceans, and seaweed. By 2000, research into intertidal organisms recovery launched and is still ongoing; however, researchers from that survey project in 2007 have said that “recolonization is ongoing, rather than complete.”

A flock of sheep was placed on the island not long after the cleanup in 1987 and remained healthy.

On 24 April 1990, after 48 years of quarantine and four years after the solution was applied, junior defence minister Michael Neubert visited the island and announced its safety by removing the warning signs.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/604838492&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 1990, the island was repurchased by the heirs of the original owner for the original sale price of £500. There was some confusion in which members of the public did not know it was being resold solely to its original owners and people from around the world sent letters to the British government asking to purchase the island for £500.

== Wildfire ==

On 26 March 2022, the island was burned &quot;from one end to the other&quot; by a wildfire. Eyewitnesses described the scene as &quot;apocalyptic&quot;. The cause of the wildfire has not been confirmed but around 200 hectares have been destroyed by the fire. A spokeswoman on behalf of the Gruinard estate did not explicitly state the cause of the fire, only that &quot;It hasn&#x27;t caused any damage. It has done good.&quot;

==Popular culture references==
Gruinard Island is mentioned in the novels &quot;The Anthrax Mutation&quot; by Alan Scott (1971), &quot;The Enemy&quot; by Desmond Bagley (1977), &quot;1982, Janine&quot; by Alasdair Gray (1984), &quot;Isvik&quot; by Hammond Innes (1991), &quot;Sea of Death&quot; by Richard P. Henrick (1992), &quot;The Fist of God&quot; by Frederick Forsyth (1994), &quot;Quantico&quot; by Greg Bear (2005), &quot;The Big Over Easy&quot; by Jasper Fforde (2005), &quot;Forbidden Island&quot; by Malcolm Rose (2009), &quot;And then you die&quot; by Iris Johansen (1998), &quot;The Island&quot; by R. J. Price (better-known as the poet Richard Price) (2010), &quot;And the Land Lay Still&quot; by James Robertson, &quot;The Impossible Dead&quot; by Ian Rankin (2011), &quot;White Pines&quot; by Gemma Amor (2020), and &quot;Paying the Piper&quot; by Sharon McCrumb. It also features as the principal setting for the novel &quot;El año de gracia&quot; by Cristina Fernández Cubas, in which the protagonist spends a winter shipwrecked on the island. The island is the principal location in the novel &quot;Anthrax Island&quot; by D. L. Marshall (2021).

In issues 187–188 of the comic book &quot;Hellblazer&quot;, in a story titled &quot;Bred in the Bone&quot;, the protagonist&#x27;s niece finds herself on Gruinard surrounded by flesh-eating children. The issues were released in 2003 and were written by Mike Carey and illustrated by Doug Alexander Gregory.

An episode of the British wartime TV series &quot;Foyle&#x27;s War&quot; entitled &quot;Bad Blood&quot; involved biological testing – a reference to the Gruinard testing.

The 1970 &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; episode &quot;Three Dead Cows at Makapu, Part 2&quot; featured a scientist played by Ed Flanders who threatened to unleash a deadly virus on the island of Oahu. When being interrogated, the scientist briefly mentions Gruinard Island and how it will be uninhabitable for a century due to anthrax experiments.

&quot;Outlying Islands&quot;, a Fringe First-winning play by Scottish dramatist David Greig, is a fictionalised account of two British scientists&#x27; visit to an island in Scotland where the government plans to test anthrax inspired by the story of Gruinard.

&quot;Smallpox Island&quot;, off the north-west coast of Scotland, appears in the &quot;2000 AD&quot; comic strip &quot;Caballistics, Inc.&quot;, although the warnings of contamination from biological weapons are a cover for a top secret, high-security prison.

The 2006 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio drama &quot;Night Thoughts&quot; is set on the fictional Gravonax Island, the name and history of which are inspired by those of Gruinard.

The 2013 UK TV series &quot;Utopia&quot; describes the fictional outbreak of a new form of flu. During Episode 3, Dugdale visits the proposed origin of the virus at the, now quarantined, Island of Fetlar. On arrival, personnel at the island, wearing orange overalls, carry one of numerous covered bodies past on a stretcher in a scene that is nearly identical to that seen in the original test footage from Gruinard Island. In the dramatisation however, the personnel at Fetlar are seen wearing dust masks as opposed to the gas masks seen in the Gruinard footage; likely due to budget constraints (much of Utopia was not filmed where it claims to be).

The experiments are referred to in the storyline of &quot;Trust&quot;, the third and fourth episodes of Series 16 of the BBC series &quot;Silent Witness&quot;.

<text>South West Africa was a territory under South African administration from 1915 to 1966, and under South African occupation from 1966 to 1990. Renamed &quot;Namibia&quot; by the United Nations in 1968, it became independent under this name on 21 March 1990. 

South West Africa bordered Angola (a Portuguese colony before 1975), Botswana (Bechuanaland before 1966), South Africa, and Zambia (Northern Rhodesia before 1964). During its administration, South Africa applied its own apartheid system in the territory of South West Africa.

A German colony known as German South West Africa from 1884 to 1915, it was made a League of Nations mandate of the Union of South Africa following Germany&#x27;s defeat in the First World War. Although the mandate was repealed by the United Nations on 27 October 1966, South African control over the territory continued despite its illegality under international law. The territory was administered directly by the South African government from 1915 to 1978, when the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference laid the groundwork for semi-autonomous rule. During an interim period between 1978 and 1985, South Africa gradually granted South West Africa a limited form of home rule, culminating in the formation of a Transitional Government of National Unity.

==German colony==
As a German colony from 1884, it was known as German South West Africa (&quot;Deutsch-Südwestafrika&quot;). Germany had a difficult time administering the territory, which experienced many insurrections against the harsh German rule, especially those led by guerrilla leader Jacob Morenga. The main port, Walvis Bay, and the Penguin Islands were annexed by the UK in 1878, becoming part of the Cape Colony in 1884. Following the creation of the Union of South Africa in 1910, Walvis Bay became part of the Cape Province.

As part of the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty in 1890, a corridor of land taken from the northern border of Bechuanaland, extending as far as the Zambezi River, was added to the colony. It was named the Caprivi Strip (&quot;Caprivizipfel&quot;) after the German Chancellor Leo von Caprivi.

==South African rule==
In 1915, during the South West Africa campaign of World War I, South Africa captured the German colony. After the war, it was declared a League of Nations Class C Mandate territory under the Treaty of Versailles, with the Union of South Africa responsible for the administration of South West Africa. From 1922, this included Walvis Bay, which, under the South West Africa Affairs Act, was governed as if it were part of the mandated territory. South West Africa remained a League of Nations Mandate until World War II and the collapse of the League of Nations.

The Mandate was supposed to become a United Nations Trust Territory when League of Nations Mandates were transferred to the United Nations following World War II. The Prime Minister, Jan Smuts, objected to South West Africa coming under UN control and refused to allow the territory&#x27;s transition to independence, instead seeking to make it South Africa&#x27;s fifth province in 1946.

Although this never occurred, in 1949, the South West Africa Affairs Act was amended to give representation in the Parliament of South Africa to whites in South West Africa, which gave them six seats in the House of Assembly and four in the Senate.

This was to the advantage of the National Party, which enjoyed strong support from the predominantly Afrikaner and ethnic German white population in the territory. Between 1950 and 1977, all of South West Africa&#x27;s parliamentary seats were held by the National Party.

An additional consequence of this was the extension of apartheid laws to the territory. This gave rise to several rulings at the International Court of Justice, which in 1950 ruled that South Africa was not obliged to convert South West Africa into a UN trust territory, but was still bound by the League of Nations Mandate, with the United Nations General Assembly assuming the supervisory role. The ICJ also clarified that the General Assembly was empowered to receive petitions from the inhabitants of South West Africa and to call for reports from the mandatory nation, South Africa. The General Assembly constituted the Committee on South West Africa to perform the supervisory functions.

In another Advisory Opinion issued in 1955, the Court further ruled that the General Assembly was not required to follow League of Nations voting procedures in determining questions concerning South West Africa. In 1956, the Court further ruled that the committee had the power to grant hearings to petitioners from the mandated territory. In 1960, Ethiopia and Liberia filed a case in the International Court of Justice against South Africa alleging that South Africa had not fulfilled its mandatory duties. This case did not succeed, with the Court ruling in 1966 that they were not the proper parties to bring the case.

===Mandate terminated===

There was a protracted struggle between South Africa and forces fighting for independence, particularly after the formation of the South West Africa People&#x27;s Organisation (SWAPO) in 1960.

On 27 October 1966, the General Assembly passed resolution 2145 (XXI) which declared the Mandate terminated and that the Republic of South Africa had no further right to administer South West Africa. South African control over the territory nevertheless continued despite its illegality under international law. In 1971, acting on a request for an Advisory Opinion from the United Nations Security Council, the ICJ ruled that the continued presence of South Africa in Namibia was illegal and that South Africa was under an obligation to withdraw from Namibia immediately. It also ruled that all member states of the United Nations were under an obligation not to recognise as valid any act performed by South Africa on behalf of Namibia.

South West Africa became known as Namibia by the UN when the General Assembly changed the territory&#x27;s name by Resolution 2372 (XXII) of 12 June 1968. SWAPO was recognised as representative of the Namibian people, and gained UN observer status when the territory of South West Africa was already removed from the list of non-self-governing territories.

In 1977, South Africa transferred control of Walvis Bay back to the Cape Province, thereby making it an exclave.

===Bantustans (1968–1980)===

The South African authorities established 10 bantustans in South West Africa in the late 1960s and early 1970s in accordance with the Odendaal Commission, three of which were granted self-rule. These bantustans were replaced with separate ethnicity based second-tier representative authorities in 1980.

===Three-tier system of governance (1980–1989)===
The South African government convened the Turnhalle Constitutional Conference between 1976 and 1978 with a view to achieving an &quot;internal&quot; solution to the status of South West Africa. The conference was attended by representatives of 11 ethnic groups: Herero, Baster, Tswana, Damara, Ovambo, Lozi, Nama, Kavango, San, the Coloureds, and the Whites. However, the largest freedom movement, SWAPO, was not invited. The conference produced a 29-page document entitled &quot;Petition for the establishment of an interim government&quot;. The petition contained a request to set up an interim government for the territory, as well as a draft constitution for &quot;a republican, democratic state&quot; to be known as &quot;South West Africa/Namibia&quot; with its own flag and national anthem.

Under the proposals, there was to be a three-tiered system of governance. The first tier, the Central Government, would consist of a National Assembly which would appoint a Council of Ministers. The second tier would consist of ethnically based Representative Authorities and the third tier would be made up of Local Authorities.

====Tier one: Central Government====
;Interim Government (1980–1983)
The upper tier of governance consisted of an elected fifty member National Assembly with legislative powers. The assembly would appoint a Council of Ministers with executive powers. Multi-racial elections for the National Assembly were held in December 1978. The Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) won 41 of the 50 seats and its leader, Dirk Mudge would become Chairman of the Council of Ministers on 1 July 1980. Johannes Skrywer, also of the DTA, became Speaker of the National Assembly.

The interim government collapsed on 18 January 1983 following the resignation of the Council of Ministers citing interference from the South African government and proposals to create a State Council.

;Direct rule (1983–1985)

Following the collapse of the Interim Government, its legislative and executive powers returned to South African Administrator-General Willie van Niekerk, who was assisted by and Jan F Greebe as chief executive officer. The Representative Authorities and Local Authorities continued to function as intended during this period.

;Transitional Government of National Unity (1985–1989)
A Multi-Party Conference was established in September 1983 to suggest arrangements for the formation of a new Central Government. Nineteen parties participated in the conference, but again SWAPO was excluded.

The Multi-Party Conference issued the &quot;Windhoek Declaration of Basic Principles&quot; in 1984 and a &quot;Bill of Fundamental Rights and Objectives&quot; the following year, resulting in the establishment of a Transitional Government of National Unity (TGNU) on 17 June 1985.

Unlike the previous Interim Government, the TGNU was not directly elected but instead consisted of an appointed 62 member National Assembly and an 8-member Council of Ministers which would be led by each member on a three-month rotational basis. The DTA was awarded 22 seats in the National Assembly with five other parties being awarded 8 seats each. Johannes Skrywer would again become Speaker of the National Assembly and Dawid Bezuidenhout would be the first Chairman of the Council of Ministers.

====Tier two: Representative Authorities====
The second-tier of governance in South West Africa consisted of ethnic-based Representative Authorities which replaced the previous system of Bantustans that were established in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Each authority would have executive and legislative competencies, being made up of elected Legislative Assemblies who would appoint Executive Committees led by chairmen. Representative Authorities had responsibility for land tenure, agriculture, education up to primary level, teachers&#x27; training, health services, and social welfare and pensions and their Legislative Assemblies had the ability to pass legislation known as Ordinances. Unlike the former Bantustans, Representative Authorities functioned on the basis of ethnicity only and were no longer based on geographically defined areas. 

Representative Authorities were created for Whites, Coloureds, Ovambos, Kavangos, Lozi, Damaras, Namas, Tswanas, and Herero. A similar body had been established for Rehoboth Basters by the Rehoboth Self-Determination Act, 1976. An advisory council was established for San Bushmen in 1986. No representative body was established for Himbas.

====Tier three: Local authorities====
Local authorities formed the lowest tier of governance in South West Africa. Previously established local government bodies would continue to exist and new ones could be formed. In urban areas, the local authority would be an elected local council. In rural areas where local governance structures was based on traditional customary law, the relevant Representative Authority could support their further development.

===Transition to independence (1989–1990)===
The Three-tier system of governance was suspended on 28 February 1989 following the signing of a peace agreement the previous year. As stipulated by United Nations Security Council Resolution 435, a United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) was deployed on 1 April 1989. Elections to a Constituent Assembly were held in November 1989 and the territory became independent as the Republic of Namibia on 21 March 1990. Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands remained under South African control until 1994.

<text>Gulliver&#x27;s Travels, originally Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel Gulliver, First a Surgeon, and then a Captain of Several Ships is a 1726 prose satire by the Anglo-Irish writer and clergyman Jonathan Swift, satirising both human nature and the &quot;travellers&#x27; tales&quot; literary subgenre. It is Swift&#x27;s best-known full-length work and a classic of English literature. The English dramatist John Gay remarked, &quot;It is universally read, from the cabinet council to the nursery.&quot; The book has been adapted into films, movies and theatrical performances over the centuries.

The book was an immediate success, and Swift claimed that he wrote &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; &quot;to vex the world rather than divert it&quot;.

==Plot==
===Part I: A Voyage to Lilliput===

The travel begins with a short preamble in which Lemuel Gulliver gives a brief outline of his life and history before his voyages.

;4 May 1699 – 13 April 1702

During his first voyage, Gulliver is washed ashore after a shipwreck and finds himself a prisoner of a race of tiny people less than tall, much like the little people in mythology, who are inhabitants of the island country of Lilliput. After giving assurances of his good behaviour, he is given a residence in Lilliput and becomes a favourite of the Lilliput Royal Court. He is also given permission by the King of Lilliput to go around the city on the condition that he must not hurt their subjects.

At first, the Lilliputians are hospitable to Gulliver, but they are also wary of the threat that his size poses to them. The Lilliputians reveal themselves to be a people who put great emphasis on trivial matters. For example, which end of an egg a person cracks becomes the basis of a deep political rift within that nation. They are a people who revel in displays of authority and performances of power. Gulliver assists the Lilliputians to subdue their neighbours the Blefuscudians by stealing their fleet. However, he refuses to reduce the island nation of Blefuscu to a province of Lilliput, displeasing the King and the royal court.

Gulliver is charged with treason for, among other crimes, urinating in the capital though he was putting out a fire. He is convicted and sentenced to be blinded. With the assistance of a kind friend, &quot;a considerable person at court&quot;, he escapes to Blefuscu. Here, he spots and retrieves an abandoned boat and sails out to be rescued by a passing ship, which safely takes him back home with some Lilliputian animals he carries with him.

===Part II: A Voyage to Brobdingnag===
;20 June 1702 – 3 June 1706

Gulliver soon sets out again. When the sailing ship &quot;Adventure&quot; is blown off course by storms and forced to sail for land in search of fresh water, Gulliver is abandoned by his companions and left on a peninsula on the western coast of the North American continent.

The grass of Brobdingnag is as tall as a tree. He is then found by a farmer who is about 72 ft (22 m) tall, judging from Gulliver estimating the man&#x27;s step being . The giant farmer brings Gulliver home, and his daughter Glumdalclitch cares for Gulliver. The farmer treats him as a curiosity and exhibits him for money. After a while the constant display makes Gulliver sick, and the farmer sells him to the queen of the realm. Glumdalclitch (who accompanied her father while exhibiting Gulliver) is taken into the queen&#x27;s service to take care of the tiny man. Since Gulliver is too small to use their huge chairs, beds, knives and forks, the queen commissions a small house to be built for him so that he can be carried around in it; this is referred to as his &quot;travelling box&quot;.

Between small adventures such as fighting giant wasps and being carried to the roof by a monkey, he discusses the state of Europe with the King of Brobdingnag. The king is not happy with Gulliver&#x27;s accounts of Europe, especially upon learning of the use of guns and cannon. On a trip to the seaside, his traveling box is seized by a giant eagle which drops Gulliver and his box into the sea where he is picked up by sailors who return him to England.

===Part III: A Voyage to Laputa, Balnibarbi, Luggnagg, Glubbdubdrib and Japan===


;5 August 1706 – 16 April 1710

Setting out again, Gulliver&#x27;s ship is attacked by pirates, and he is marooned close to a desolate rocky island near India. He is rescued by the flying island of Laputa, a kingdom devoted to the arts of music, mathematics, and astronomy but unable to use them for practical ends. Rather than using armies, Laputa has a custom of throwing rocks down at rebellious cities on the ground.

Gulliver tours Balnibarbi, the kingdom ruled from Laputa, as the guest of a low-ranking courtier and sees the ruin brought about by the blind pursuit of science without practical results, in a satire on bureaucracy and on the Royal Society and its experiments. At the Grand Academy of Lagado in Balnibarbi, great resources and manpower are employed on researching preposterous schemes such as extracting sunbeams from cucumbers, softening marble for use in pillows, learning how to mix paint by smell, and uncovering political conspiracies by examining the excrement of suspicious persons. Gulliver refers in passing to his visit to Tribnia (that is, Britain), called by some Langden (that is, England), where the main occupations are plotting and informing. Gulliver is then taken to Maldonada, the main port of Balnibarbi, to await a trader who can take him on to Japan.

While waiting for a passage, Gulliver takes a short side-trip to the island of Glubbdubdrib which is southwest of Balnibarbi. On Glubbdubdrib, he visits a magician&#x27;s dwelling and discusses history with the ghosts of historical figures, the most obvious restatement of the &quot;ancients versus moderns&quot; theme in the book. The ghosts include Julius Caesar, Brutus, Homer, Aristotle, René Descartes, and Pierre Gassendi.

On the island of Luggnagg, he encounters the &quot;struldbrugs&quot;, people who are immortal. They do not have the gift of eternal youth, but suffer the infirmities of old age and are considered legally dead at the age of eighty.

After reaching Japan, Gulliver asks the Emperor &quot;to excuse my performing the ceremony imposed upon my countrymen of trampling upon the crucifix&quot;, which the Emperor does. Gulliver returns home, determined to stay there for the rest of his days.

===Part IV: A Voyage to the Land of the Houyhnhnms===
;7 September 1710 – 5 December 1715

Despite his earlier intention of remaining at home, Gulliver returns to sea as the captain of a merchantman, as he is bored with his employment as a surgeon. On this voyage, he is forced to find new additions to his crew who, he believes, have turned against him. His crew then commits mutiny. After keeping him contained for some time, they resolve to leave him on the first piece of land they come across, and continue as pirates. He is abandoned in a landing boat and comes upon a race of deformed savage humanoid creatures to which he conceives a violent antipathy. Shortly afterwards, he meets the Houyhnhnms, a race of talking horses. They are the rulers while the deformed creatures that resemble human beings are called Yahoos.

Some scholars have identified the relationship between the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos as a master/slave dynamic.

Gulliver becomes a member of a horse&#x27;s household and comes to both admire and emulate the Houyhnhnms and their way of life, rejecting his fellow humans as merely Yahoos endowed with some semblance of reason which they only use to exacerbate and add to the vices Nature gave them. However, an Assembly of the Houyhnhnms rules that Gulliver, a Yahoo with some semblance of reason, is a danger to their civilization and commands him to swim back to the land that he came from. Gulliver&#x27;s &quot;Master&quot;, the Houyhnhnm who took him into his household, buys him time to create a canoe to make his departure easier. After another disastrous voyage, he is rescued against his will by a Portuguese ship. He is disgusted to see that Captain Pedro de Mendez, whom he considers a Yahoo, is a wise, courteous, and generous person.

He returns to his home in England, but is unable to reconcile himself to living among &quot;Yahoos&quot; and becomes a recluse, remaining in his house, avoiding his family and his wife, and spending several hours a day speaking with the horses in his stables.

==Composition and history==
It is uncertain exactly when Swift started writing &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. (Much of the writing was done at Loughry Manor in Cookstown, County Tyrone, whilst Swift stayed there.) Some sources suggest as early as 1713 when Swift, Gay, Pope, Arbuthnot and others formed the Scriblerus Club with the aim of satirising popular literary genres. According to these accounts, Swift was charged with writing the memoirs of the club&#x27;s imaginary author, Martinus Scriblerus, and also with satirising the &quot;travellers&#x27; tales&quot; literary subgenre. It is known from Swift&#x27;s correspondence that the composition proper began in 1720 with the mirror-themed Parts I and II written first, Part IV next in 1723 and Part III written in 1724; but amendments were made even while Swift was writing &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot;. By August 1725 the book was complete; and as &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; was a transparently anti-Whig satire, it is likely that Swift had the manuscript copied so that his handwriting could not be used as evidence if a prosecution should arise, as had happened in the case of some of his Irish pamphlets (the &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot;). In March 1726 Swift travelled to London to have his work published; the manuscript was secretly delivered to the publisher Benjamin Motte, who used five printing houses to speed production and avoid piracy. Motte, recognising a best-seller but fearing prosecution, cut or altered the worst offending passages (such as the descriptions of the court contests in Lilliput and the rebellion of Lindalino), added some material in defence of Queen Anne to Part II, and published it. The first edition was released in two volumes on 28 October 1726, priced at 8&quot;s&quot;. 6&quot;d&quot;.

Motte published &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; anonymously, and as was often the way with fashionable works, several follow-ups (&quot;Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput&quot;), parodies (&quot;Two Lilliputian Odes, The first on the Famous Engine With Which Captain Gulliver extinguish&#x27;d the Palace Fire...&quot;) and &quot;keys&quot; (&quot;Gulliver Decipher&#x27;d&quot; and &quot;Lemuel Gulliver&#x27;s Travels into Several Remote Regions of the World Compendiously Methodiz&#x27;d&quot;, the second by Edmund Curll who had similarly written a &quot;key&quot; to Swift&#x27;s &quot;Tale of a Tub&quot; in 1705) were swiftly produced. These were mostly printed anonymously (or occasionally pseudonymously) and were quickly forgotten. Swift had nothing to do with them and disavowed them in Faulkner&#x27;s edition of 1735. Swift&#x27;s friend Alexander Pope wrote a set of five &quot;Verses on Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, which Swift liked so much that he added them to the second edition of the book, though they are rarely included in modern editions.

===Faulkner&#x27;s 1735 edition===
In 1735 an Irish publisher, George Faulkner, printed a set of Swift&#x27;s works, Volume III of which was &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. As revealed in Faulkner&#x27;s &quot;Advertisement to the Reader&quot;, Faulkner had access to an annotated copy of Motte&#x27;s work by &quot;a friend of the author&quot; (generally believed to be Swift&#x27;s friend Charles Ford) which reproduced most of the manuscript without Motte&#x27;s amendments, the original manuscript having been destroyed. It is also believed that Swift at least reviewed proofs of Faulkner&#x27;s edition before printing, but this cannot be proved. Generally, this is regarded as the &quot;Editio Princeps&quot; of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; with one small exception. This edition had an added piece by Swift, &quot;A letter from Capt. Gulliver to his Cousin Sympson&quot;, which complained of Motte&#x27;s alterations to the original text, saying he had so much altered it that &quot;I do hardly know mine own work&quot; and repudiating all of Motte&#x27;s changes as well as all the keys, libels, parodies, second parts and continuations that had appeared in the intervening years. This letter now forms part of many standard texts.

===Lindalino===
The five-paragraph episode in Part III, telling of the rebellion of the surface city of Lindalino against the flying island of Laputa, was an allegory of the affair of &quot;Drapier&#x27;s Letters&quot; of which Swift was proud. Lindalino represented Dublin and the impositions of Laputa represented the British imposition of William Wood&#x27;s poor-quality copper currency. Faulkner had omitted this passage, either because of political sensitivities raised by an Irish publisher printing an anti-British satire, or possibly because the text he worked from did not include the passage. In 1899 the passage was included in a new edition of the &quot;Collected Works&quot;. Modern editions derive from the Faulkner edition with the inclusion of this 1899 addendum.

Isaac Asimov notes in &quot;The Annotated Gulliver&quot; that Lindalino is generally taken to be Dublin, being composed of double &quot;L-I-N&quot;s; hence, Dublin.

==Major themes==
&quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; has been described as a Menippean satire, a children&#x27;s story, proto-science fiction and a forerunner of the modern novel.

Published seven years after Daniel Defoe&#x27;s successful &quot;Robinson Crusoe&quot;, &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; may be read as a systematic rebuttal of Defoe&#x27;s optimistic account of human capability. In &quot;The Unthinkable Swift: The Spontaneous Philosophy of a Church of England Man&quot;, Warren Montag argues that Swift was concerned to refute the notion that the individual precedes society, as Defoe&#x27;s work seems to suggest. Swift regarded such thought as a dangerous endorsement of Thomas Hobbes&#x27; radical political philosophy and for this reason Gulliver repeatedly encounters established societies rather than desolate islands. The captain who invites Gulliver to serve as a surgeon aboard his ship on the disastrous third voyage is named Robinson.

Allan Bloom asserts that Swift&#x27;s lampooning of the experiments of Laputa is the first questioning by a modern liberal democrat of the effects and cost on a society which embraces and celebrates policies pursuing scientific progress. Swift wrote:
A possible reason for the book&#x27;s classic status is that it can be seen as many things to many people. Broadly, the book has three themes:
* A satirical view of the state of European government, and of petty differences between religions
* An inquiry into whether people are inherently corrupt or whether they become corrupted
* A restatement of the older &quot;ancients versus moderns&quot; controversy previously addressed by Swift in &quot;The Battle of the Books&quot;

In storytelling and construction the parts follow a pattern:
* The causes of Gulliver&#x27;s misadventures become more malignant as time goes on—he is first shipwrecked, then abandoned, then attacked by strangers, then attacked by his own crew.
* Gulliver&#x27;s attitude hardens as the book progresses—he is genuinely surprised by the viciousness and politicking of the Lilliputians but finds the behaviour of the Yahoos in the fourth part reflective of the behaviour of people.
* Each part is the reverse of the preceding part—Gulliver is big/small/wise/ignorant, the countries are complex/simple/scientific/natural, and Gulliver perceives the forms of government as worse/better/worse/better than Britain&#x27;s (although Swift&#x27;s opinions on this matter are unclear).
* Gulliver&#x27;s viewpoint between parts is mirrored by that of his antagonists in the contrasting part—Gulliver sees the tiny Lilliputians as being vicious and unscrupulous, and then the king of Brobdingnag sees Europe in exactly the same light; Gulliver sees the Laputians as unreasonable, and his Houyhnhnm master sees humanity as equally so.
* No form of government is ideal—the simplistic Brobdingnagians enjoy public executions and have streets infested with beggars, the honest and upright Houyhnhnms who have no word for lying are happy to suppress the true nature of Gulliver as a Yahoo and are equally unconcerned about his reaction to being expelled.
* Specific individuals may be good even where the race is bad—Gulliver finds a friend in each of his travels and, despite Gulliver&#x27;s rejection and horror toward all Yahoos, is treated very well by the Portuguese captain, Don Pedro, who returns him to England at the book&#x27;s end.

=== Misogyny ===
Although Swift is often accused of misogyny in this work, many scholars believe Gulliver&#x27;s blatant misogyny to be intentional, and that Swift uses satire to openly mock misogyny throughout the book. One of the most cited examples of this comes from Gulliver&#x27;s description of a Brobdingnagian woman:

This open critique towards aspects of the female body is something that Swift often brings up in other works of his, particularly in poems such as &quot;The Lady&#x27;s Dressing Room&quot; and &quot;A Beautiful Young Nymph Going To Bed&quot;.

A criticism of Swift&#x27;s use of misogyny by Felicity A. Nussbaum proposes the idea that &quot;Gulliver himself is a gendered object of satire, and his antifeminist sentiments may be among those mocked&quot;. Gulliver’s own masculinity is often mocked, seen in how he is made to be a coward among the Brobdingnag people, repressed by the people of Lilliput, and viewed as an inferior Yahoo among the Houyhnhnms.

Nussbaum goes on to say in her analysis of the misogyny of the stories that in the adventures, particularly in the first story, the satire is not singularly focused on satirizing women, but to satirize Gulliver himself as a politically naive and inept giant whose masculine authority comically seems to be in jeopardy.

Another criticism of Swift&#x27;s use of misogyny delves into Gulliver&#x27;s repeated use of the word &#x27;nauseous&#x27;, and the way that Gulliver is fighting his emasculation by commenting on how he thinks the women of Brobdingnag are disgusting.

This commentary of Deborah Needleman Armintor relies upon the way that the giant women do with Gulliver as they please, in much the same way as one might play with a toy, and get it to do everything one can think of. Armintor&#x27;s comparison focuses on the pocket microscopes that were popular in Swift&#x27;s time. She talks about how this instrument of science was transitioned to something toy-like and accessible, so it shifted into something that women favored, and thus men lost interest. This is similar to the progression of Gulliver&#x27;s time in Brobdingnag, from man of science to women&#x27;s plaything.

=== Comic misanthropy ===
Misanthropy is a theme that scholars have identified in &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Arthur Case, R.S. Crane, and Edward Stone discuss Gulliver&#x27;s development of misanthropy and come to the consensus that this theme ought to be viewed as comical rather than cynical.

In terms of Gulliver&#x27;s development of misanthropy, these three scholars point to the fourth voyage. According to Case, Gulliver is at first averse to identifying with the Yahoos, but, after he deems the Houyhnhnms superior, he comes to believe that humans (including his fellow Europeans) are Yahoos due to their shortcomings. Perceiving the Houyhnhnms as perfect, Gulliver thus begins to perceive himself and the rest of humanity as imperfect. According to Crane, when Gulliver develops his misanthropic mindset, he becomes ashamed of humans and views them more in line with animals. This new perception of Gulliver&#x27;s, Stone claims, comes about because the Houyhnhnms&#x27; judgement pushes Gulliver to identify with the Yahoos. Along similar lines, Crane holds that Gulliver&#x27;s misanthropy is developed in part when he talks to the Houyhnhnms about mankind because the discussions lead him to reflect on his previously held notion of humanity. Specifically, Gulliver’s master, who is a Houyhnhnm, provides questions and commentary that contribute to Gulliver’s reflectiveness and subsequent development of misanthropy. However, Case points out that Gulliver&#x27;s dwindling opinion of humans may be blown out of proportion due to the fact that he is no longer able to see the good qualities that humans are capable of possessing. Gulliver’s new view of humanity, then, creates his repulsive attitude towards his fellow humans after leaving Houyhnhnmland. But in Stone&#x27;s view, Gulliver’s actions and attitude upon his return can be interpreted as misanthropy that is exaggerated for comic effect rather than for a cynical effect. Stone further suggests that Gulliver goes mentally mad and believes that this is what leads Gulliver to exaggerate the shortcomings of humankind.

Another aspect that Crane attributes to Gulliver’s development of misanthropy is that when in Houyhnhnmland, it is the animal-like beings (the Houyhnhnms) who exhibit reason and the human-like beings (the Yahoos) who seem devoid of reason; Crane argues that it is this switch from Gulliver’s perceived norm that leads the way for him to question his view of humanity. As a result, Gulliver begins to identify humans as a type of Yahoo. To this point, Crane brings up the fact that a traditional definition of man—&quot;Homo est animal rationale&quot; (Humans are rational animals)—was prominent in academia around Swift&#x27;s time. Furthermore, Crane argues that Swift had to study this type of logic (see Porphyrian Tree) in college, so it is highly likely that he intentionally inverted this logic by placing the typically given example of irrational beings—horses—in the place of humans and vice versa.

Stone points out that &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot; takes a cue from the genre of the travel book, which was popular during Swift&#x27;s time period. From reading travel books, Swift’s contemporaries were accustomed to beast-like figures of foreign places; thus, Stone holds that the creation of the Yahoos was not out of the ordinary for the time period. From this playing off of familiar genre expectations, Stone deduces that the parallels that Swift draws between the Yahoos and humans is meant to be humorous rather than cynical. Even though Gulliver sees Yahoos and humans as if they are one and the same, Stone argues that Swift did not intend for readers to take on Gulliver’s view; Stone states that the Yahoos&#x27; behaviors and characteristics that set them apart from humans further supports the notion that Gulliver&#x27;s identification with Yahoos is not meant to be taken to heart. Thus, Stone sees Gulliver’s perceived superiority of the Houyhnhnms and subsequent misanthropy as features that Swift used to employ the satirical and humorous elements characteristic of the Beast Fables of travel books that were popular with his contemporaries; as Swift did, these Beast Fables placed animals above humans in terms of morals and reason, but they were not meant to be taken literally.

===Character analysis===
Pedro de Mendez is the name of the Portuguese captain who rescues Gulliver in Book IV. When Gulliver is forced to leave the Island of the Houyhnhnms, his plan is &quot;to discover some small Island uninhabited&quot; where he can live in solitude. Instead, he is picked up by Don Pedro&#x27;s crew. Despite Gulliver&#x27;s appearance—he is dressed in skins and speaks like a horse—Don Pedro treats him compassionately and returns him to Lisbon.

Though Don Pedro appears only briefly, he has become an important figure in the debate between so-called soft school and hard school readers of &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. Some critics contend that Gulliver is a target of Swift&#x27;s satire and that Don Pedro represents an ideal of human kindness and generosity. Gulliver believes humans are similar to Yahoos in the sense that they make &quot;no other use of reason, than to improve and multiply ... vices&quot;. Captain Pedro provides a contrast to Gulliver&#x27;s reasoning, proving humans are able to reason, be kind, and most of all: civilized. Gulliver sees the bleak fallenness at the center of human nature, and Don Pedro is merely a minor character who, in Gulliver&#x27;s words, is &quot;an Animal which had some little Portion of Reason&quot;.

=== Political allusions ===
Part I is probably responsible for the greatest number of political allusions. One of the most commonly noted parallels is that the wars between Lilliput and Blefuscu resemble those between England and France. The enmity between the low heels and the high heels is often interpreted as a parody of the Whigs and Tories, and the character referred to as Flimnap is often interpreted as an allusion to Sir Robert Walpole, a British statesman and Whig politician who Swift had a personally turbulent relationship with.

In Part III, the grand Academy of Lagado in Balnibarbi resembles and satirizes the Royal Society, which Swift was openly critical of. Furthermore, &quot;A. E. Case, acting on a tipoff offered by the word &#x27;projectors,&#x27; found [the Academy] to be the hiding place of many of those speculators implicated in the South Sea Bubble.&quot; According to Treadwell, however, these implications extend beyond the speculators of the South Sea Bubble to include the many projectors of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century England, including Swift himself. Not only is Swift satirizing the role of the projector in contemporary English politics, which he dabbled in during his younger years, but the role of the satirist, whose goals align with that of a projector: &quot;The less obvious corollary of that word [projector] is that it must include the poor deluded satirist himself, since satire is, in its very essence, the wildest of all projects - a scheme to reform the world.&quot;

Ann Kelly describes Part IV of &quot;The Travels&quot; and the Yahoo-Houyhnhnm relationship as an allusion to that of the Irish and the British: &quot;The term that Swift uses to describe the oppression in both Ireland and Houyhnhnmland is &#x27;slavery&#x27;; this is not an accidental word choice, for Swift was well aware of the complicated moral and philosophical questions raised by the emotional designation &#x27;slavery.&#x27; The misery of the Irish in the early eighteenth century shocked Swift and all others who witnessed it; the hopeless passivity of the people in this desolate land made it seem as if both the minds and bodies of the Irish were enslaved.&quot; Kelly goes on to write: &quot;Throughout the Irish tracts and poems, Swift continually vacillates as to whether the Irish are servile because of some defect within their character or whether their sordid condition is the result of a calculated policy from without to reduce them to brutishness. Although no one has done so, similar questions could be asked about the Yahoos, who are slaves to the Houyhnhnms.&quot; However, Kelly does not suggest a wholesale equivalence between Irish and Yahoos, which would be reductive and omit the various other layers of satire at work in this section.

==Language==
Part I includes examples of the Lilliputian language, including a paragraph for which Gulliver provides a translation. In his annotated edition of the book published in 1978, Isaac Asimov claims that &quot;making sense out of the words and phrases introduced by Swift...is a waste of time,&quot; and these words were invented nonsense. However, Irving Rothman, a professor at University of Houston, points out that the language may have been derived from Hebrew, which Swift had studied at Trinity College Dublin.
== Reception ==

The book was very popular upon release and was commonly discussed within social circles. Public reception widely varied, with the book receiving an initially enthusiastic reaction with readers praising its satire, and some reporting that the satire&#x27;s cleverness sounded like a realistic account of a man&#x27;s travels. James Beattie commended Swift’s work for its &quot;truth&quot; regarding the narration and claims that &quot;the statesman, the philosopher, and the critick, will admire his keenness of satire, energy of description, and vivacity of language&quot;, noting that even children can enjoy the novel. As popularity increased, critics came to appreciate the deeper aspects of &quot;Gulliver’s Travels.&quot; It became known for its insightful take on morality, expanding its reputation beyond just humorous satire.

Despite its initial positive reception, the book faced backlash. Viscount Bolingbroke, a friend of Swift and one of the first critics of the book, criticised the author for his overt use of misanthropy. Other negative responses to the book also looked towards its portrayal of humanity, which was considered inaccurate. Swifts’s peers rejected the book on claims that its themes of misanthropy were harmful and offensive. They criticized its satire for exceeding what was deemed acceptable and appropriate, including the Houyhnhnms and Yahoos’s similarities to humans. There was also controversy surrounding the political allegories. Readers enjoyed the political references, finding them humorous. However, members of the Whig party were offended, believing that Swift mocked their politics.

British novelist and journalist William Makepeace Thackeray described Swift&#x27;s work as &quot;blasphemous&quot;, saying its critical view of mankind was ludicrous and overly harsh. He concluded that he could not understand the origins of Swift’s critiques on humanity.

==Cultural influences==

The term &quot;Lilliputian&quot; has entered many languages as an adjective meaning &quot;small and delicate&quot;. There is a brand of small cigar called Lilliput, and a series of collectable model houses known as &quot;Lilliput Lane&quot;. The smallest light bulb fitting (5 mm diameter) in the Edison screw series is called the &quot;Lilliput Edison screw&quot;. In Dutch and Czech, the words &quot;Lilliputter&quot; and &quot;lilipután&quot;, respectively, are used for adults shorter than 1.30 meters, although in Dutch this term is controversial. Conversely, &quot;Brobdingnagian&quot; appears in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; as a synonym for &quot;very large&quot; or &quot;gigantic&quot;.

In like vein, the term &quot;yahoo&quot; is often encountered as a synonym for &quot;ruffian&quot; or &quot;thug&quot;. In the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; it is defined as &quot;a rude, noisy, or violent person&quot; and its origins attributed to Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;.

In the discipline of computer architecture, the terms &quot;big-endian&quot; and &quot;little-endian&quot; are used to describe two possible ways of laying out bytes of data in computer memory. The terms derive from one of the satirical conflicts in the book, in which two religious sects of Lilliputians are divided between those who crack open their soft-boiled eggs from the little end, the &quot;Little-endians&quot;, and those who use the big end, the &quot;Big-endians&quot;. The nomenclature was chosen as an irony, since the choice of which byte-order method to use is technically trivial (both are equally good), but actually still important: systems which do it one way are thus incompatible with those that do it the other way, and so it &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot; be left to each individual designer&#x27;s choice, resulting in a &quot;holy war&quot; over a triviality.

It has been pointed out that the long and vicious war which started after a disagreement about which was the best end to break an egg is an example of the narcissism of small differences, a term Sigmund Freud coined in the early 1900s.

===In other works===
Many sequels followed the initial publishing of the &quot;Travels&quot;. The earliest of these was the anonymously authored &quot;Memoirs of the Court of Lilliput&quot;, published 1727, which expands the account of Gulliver&#x27;s stays in Lilliput and Blefuscu by adding several gossipy anecdotes about scandalous episodes at the Lilliputian court. Abbé Pierre Desfontaines, the first French translator of Swift&#x27;s story, wrote a sequel, &quot;Le Nouveau Gulliver ou Voyages de Jean Gulliver, fils du capitaine Lemuel Gulliver&quot; (The New Gulliver, or the travels of John Gulliver, son of Captain Lemuel Gulliver), published in 1730. Gulliver&#x27;s son has various fantastic, satirical adventures.

The traces of Swift&#x27;s work can be found in the work of some modern science fiction writers. Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Shah Guido G&quot; describes a flying island which dominates the lands underneath, and a large portion of Robert Heinlein&#x27;s Starman Jones takes place on a planet where intelligent &quot;horses&quot; dominate wild Yahoo-like humanoids.

The Hungarian writer Frigyes Karinthy wrote two satirical novels with Gulliver as the protagonist. The first, &quot;Voyage to Faremido&quot; (1916), is about artificial intelligence, and the second, &quot;Capillaria&quot; (1921), describes an underwater world inhabited by women and the result of the first sexual encounter between men and women. 

In the short story &quot;El informe de Brodie&quot; (&quot;Brodie&#x27;s Report&quot;) by Jorge Luis Borges, published in 1970 and inspired, according to its author, by the last journey of Swift&#x27;s character, the protagonist is a Scottish shepherd who narrates his experience in a place inhabited by primitive men whom he calls Yahoos. 

In 2014 the Argentine writer Edgar Brau published a novel titled &quot;El oficio de Gulliver&quot; (&quot;Gulliver’s Craft&quot;), which describes a fifth voyage (in 1722) of Jonathan Swift’s character, in which he discovers an island located off the coast of Patagonia. Every so many years, the island shrinks until it reaches the size of a tortoise, without affecting daily life; after a while, it expands again. There, Gulliver lives a series of adventures accompanied by Tito, an anteater he has rescued and taught to speak. The novel is a satire on present-day issues.

===In music===
Georg Philipp Telemann wrote a Gulliver Suite for 2 violins without bass between 1728 and 1729. It includes a &quot;Lilliputian&quot; chaconne, a &quot;Brobigdinian&quot; gigue as well as a Loure of the &quot;well-mannered houyhnhnms&quot; combined with a Fury of the &quot;naughty yahoos&quot;.

<text>A levee ( or ), dike (American English), dyke (British English; see spelling differences), embankment, floodbank, or stop bank is an elevated ridge, natural or artificial, alongside the banks of a river, often intended to protect against flooding of the area adjoining the river. It is usually earthen and often runs parallel to the course of a river in its floodplain or along low-lying coastlines.

Naturally occurring levees form on river floodplains following flooding, where sediment and alluvium is deposited and settles, forming a ridge and increasing the river channel&#x27;s capacity. Alternatively, levees can be artificially constructed from fill, designed to regulate water levels. In some circumstances, artificial levees can be environmentally damaging.

Ancient civilizations in the Indus Valley, ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia and China all built levees. Today, levees can be found around the world, and failures of levees due to erosion or other causes can be major disasters, such as the catastrophic 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans that occurred as a result of Hurricane Katrina.

== Etymology ==
Speakers of American English use the word &quot;levee&quot;, from the French word (from the feminine past participle of the French verb , &#x27;to raise&#x27;). It originated in New Orleans a few years after the city&#x27;s founding in 1718 and was later adopted by English speakers. The name derives from the trait of the levee&#x27;s ridges being raised higher than both the channel and the surrounding floodplains.

The modern word &quot;dike&quot; or &quot;dyke&quot; most likely derives from the Dutch word , with the construction of dikes well attested as early as the 11th century. The Westfriese Omringdijk, completed by 1250, was formed by connecting existing older dikes. The Roman chronicler Tacitus mentions that the rebellious Batavi pierced dikes to flood their land and to protect their retreat (70 CE). The word originally indicated both the trench and the bank. It closely parallels the English verb &quot;to dig&quot;.

In Anglo-Saxon, the word already existed and was pronounced as &quot;dick&quot; in northern England and as &quot;ditch&quot; in the south. Similar to Dutch, the English origins of the word lie in digging a trench and forming the upcast soil into a bank alongside it. This practice has meant that the name may be given to either the excavation or to the bank. Thus Offa&#x27;s Dyke is a combined structure and Car Dyke is a trench – though it once had raised banks as well. In the English Midlands and East Anglia, and in the United States, a dike is what a ditch is in the south of England, a property-boundary marker or drainage channel. Where it carries a stream, it may be called a running dike as in &quot;Rippingale Running Dike&quot;, which leads water from the catchwater drain, Car Dyke, to the South Forty Foot Drain in Lincolnshire (TF1427). The Weir Dike is a soak dike in Bourne North Fen, near Twenty and alongside the River Glen, Lincolnshire. In the Norfolk and Suffolk Broads, a dyke may be a drainage ditch or a narrow artificial channel off a river or broad for access or mooring, some longer dykes being named, e.g., Candle Dyke.

In parts of Britain, particularly Scotland and Northern England, a dyke may be a field wall, generally made with dry stone.

== Uses ==
The main purpose of artificial levees is to prevent flooding of the adjoining countryside and to slow natural course changes in a waterway to provide reliable shipping lanes for maritime commerce over time; they also confine the flow of the river, resulting in higher and faster water flow. Levees can be mainly found along the sea, where dunes are not strong enough, along rivers for protection against high floods, along lakes or along polders. Furthermore, levees have been built for the purpose of impoldering, or as a boundary for an inundation area. The latter can be a controlled inundation by the military or a measure to prevent inundation of a larger area surrounded by levees. Levees have also been built as field boundaries and as military defences. More on this type of levee can be found in the article on dry-stone walls.

Levees can be permanent earthworks or emergency constructions (often of sandbags) built hastily in a flood emergency.

Some of the earliest levees were constructed by the Indus Valley civilization (in Pakistan and North India from ) on which the agrarian life of the Harappan peoples depended. Levees were also constructed over 3,000 years ago in ancient Egypt, where a system of levees was built along the left bank of the River Nile for more than , stretching from modern Aswan to the Nile Delta on the shores of the Mediterranean. The Mesopotamian civilizations and ancient China also built large levee systems. Because a levee is only as strong as its weakest point, the height and standards of construction have to be consistent along its length. Some authorities have argued that this requires a strong governing authority to guide the work and may have been a catalyst for the development of systems of governance in early civilizations. However, others point to evidence of large-scale water-control earthen works such as canals and/or levees dating from before King Scorpion in Predynastic Egypt, during which governance was far less centralized.

Another example of a historical levee that protected the growing city-state of Mēxihco-Tenōchtitlan and the neighboring city of Tlatelōlco, was constructed during the early 1400s, under the supervision of the tlahtoani of the altepetl Texcoco, Nezahualcoyotl. Its function was to separate the brackish waters of Lake Texcoco (ideal for the agricultural technique &quot;Chināmitls&quot;) from the fresh potable water supplied to the settlements. However, after the Europeans destroyed Tenochtitlan, the levee was also destroyed and flooding became a major problem, which resulted in the majority of The Lake being drained in the 17th century.

Levees are usually built by piling earth on a cleared, level surface. Broad at the base, they taper to a level top, where temporary embankments or sandbags can be placed. Because flood discharge intensity increases in levees on both river banks, and because silt deposits raise the level of riverbeds, planning and auxiliary measures are vital. Sections are often set back from the river to form a wider channel, and flood valley basins are divided by multiple levees to prevent a single breach from flooding a large area. A levee made from stones laid in horizontal rows with a bed of thin turf between each of them is known as a &quot;spetchel&quot;.

Artificial levees require substantial engineering. Their surface must be protected from erosion, so they are planted with vegetation such as Bermuda grass in order to bind the earth together. On the land side of high levees, a low terrace of earth known as a &quot;banquette&quot; is usually added as another anti-erosion measure. On the river side, erosion from strong waves or currents presents an even greater threat to the integrity of the levee. The effects of erosion are countered by planting suitable vegetation or installing stones, boulders, weighted matting, or concrete revetments. Separate ditches or drainage tiles are constructed to ensure that the foundation does not become waterlogged.

=== River flood prevention ===

Prominent levee systems have been built along the Mississippi River and Sacramento River in the United States, and the Po, Rhine, Meuse River, Rhône, Loire, Vistula, the delta formed by the Rhine, Maas/Meuse and Scheldt in the Netherlands and the Danube in Europe. During the Chinese Warring States period, the Dujiangyan irrigation system was built by the Qin as a water conservation and flood control project. The system&#x27;s infrastructure is located on the Min River, which is the longest tributary of the Yangtze River, in Sichuan, China.

The Mississippi levee system represents one of the largest such systems found anywhere in the world. It comprises over of levees extending some along the Mississippi, stretching from Cape Girardeau, Missouri, to the Mississippi delta. They were begun by French settlers in Louisiana in the 18th century to protect the city of New Orleans. The first Louisiana levees were about high and covered a distance of about along the riverside. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, in conjunction with the Mississippi River Commission, extended the levee system beginning in 1882 to cover the riverbanks from Cairo, Illinois to the mouth of the Mississippi delta in Louisiana. By the mid-1980s, they had reached their present extent and averaged in height; some Mississippi levees are as high as . The Mississippi levees also include some of the longest continuous individual levees in the world. One such levee extends southwards from Pine Bluff, Arkansas, for a distance of some . The scope and scale of the Mississippi levees has often been compared to the Great Wall of China.

The United States Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) recommends and supports cellular confinement technology (geocells) as a best management practice. Particular attention is given to the matter of surface erosion, overtopping prevention and protection of levee crest and downstream slope. Reinforcement with geocells provides tensile force to the soil to better resist instability.

Artificial levees can lead to an elevation of the natural riverbed over time; whether this happens or not and how fast, depends on different factors, one of them being the amount and type of the bed load of a river. Alluvial rivers with intense accumulations of sediment tend to this behavior. Examples of rivers where artificial levees led to an elevation of the riverbed, even up to a point where the riverbed is higher than the adjacent ground surface behind the levees, are found for the Yellow River in China and the Mississippi in the United States.

=== Coastal flood prevention ===
Levees are very common on the marshlands bordering the Bay of Fundy in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Canada. The Acadians who settled the area can be credited with the original construction of many of the levees in the area, created for the purpose of farming the fertile tidal marshlands. These levees are referred to as dykes. They are constructed with hinged sluice gates that open on the falling tide to drain freshwater from the agricultural marshlands and close on the rising tide to prevent seawater from entering behind the dyke. These sluice gates are called &quot;aboiteaux&quot;. In the Lower Mainland around the city of Vancouver, British Columbia, there are levees (known locally as dikes, and also referred to as &quot;the sea wall&quot;) to protect low-lying land in the Fraser River delta, particularly the city of Richmond on Lulu Island. There are also dikes to protect other locations which have flooded in the past, such as the Pitt Polder, land adjacent to the Pitt River, and other tributary rivers.

Coastal flood prevention levees are also common along the inland coastline behind the Wadden Sea, an area devastated by many historic floods. Thus the peoples and governments have erected increasingly large and complex flood protection levee systems to stop the sea even during storm floods. The biggest of these are the huge levees in the Netherlands, which have gone beyond just defending against floods, as they have aggressively taken back land that is below mean sea level. 

=== Spur dykes or groynes ===

These typically man-made hydraulic structures are situated to protect against erosion. They are typically placed in alluvial rivers perpendicular, or at an angle, to the bank of the channel or the revetment, and are used widely along coastlines. There are two common types of spur dyke, permeable and impermeable, depending on the materials used to construct them.

=== Natural examples===
Natural levees commonly form around lowland rivers and creeks without human intervention. They are elongated ridges of mud and/or silt that form on the river floodplains immediately adjacent to the cut banks. Like artificial levees, they act to reduce the likelihood of floodplain inundation.

Deposition of levees is a natural consequence of the flooding of meandering rivers which carry high proportions of suspended sediment in the form of fine sands, silts, and muds. Because the carrying capacity of a river depends in part on its depth, the sediment in the water which is over the flooded banks of the channel is no longer capable of keeping the same number of fine sediments in suspension as the main thalweg. The extra fine sediments thus settle out quickly on the parts of the floodplain nearest to the channel. Over a significant number of floods, this will eventually result in the building up of ridges in these positions and reducing the likelihood of further floods and episodes of levee building.

If aggradation continues to occur in the main channel, this will make levee overtopping more likely again, and the levees can continue to build up. In some cases, this can result in the channel bed eventually rising above the surrounding floodplains, penned in only by the levees around it; an example is the Yellow River in China near the sea, where oceangoing ships appear to sail high above the plain on the elevated river.

Levees are common in any river with a high suspended sediment fraction and thus are intimately associated with meandering channels, which also are more likely to occur where a river carries large fractions of suspended sediment. For similar reasons, they are also common in tidal creeks, where tides bring in large amounts of coastal silts and muds. High spring tides will cause flooding, and result in the building up of levees.

== Failures and breaches ==
Both natural and man-made levees can fail in a number of ways. Factors that cause levee failure include overtopping, erosion, structural failures, and levee saturation. The most frequent (and dangerous) is a levee breach. Here, a part of the levee actually breaks or is eroded away, leaving a large opening for water to flood land otherwise protected by the levee. A breach can be a sudden or gradual failure, caused either by surface erosion or by subsurface weakness in the levee. A breach can leave a fan-shaped deposit of sediment radiating away from the breach, described as a crevasse splay. In natural levees, once a breach has occurred, the gap in the levee will remain until it is again filled in by levee building processes. This increases the chances of future breaches occurring in the same location. Breaches can be the location of meander cutoffs if the river flow direction is permanently diverted through the gap.

Sometimes levees are said to fail when water overtops the crest of the levee. This will cause flooding on the floodplains, but because it does not damage the levee, it has fewer consequences for future flooding.

Among various failure mechanisms that cause levee breaches, soil erosion is found to be one of the most important factors. Predicting soil erosion and scour generation when overtopping happens is important in order to design stable levee and floodwalls. There have been numerous studies to investigate the erodibility of soils. Briaud et al. (2008) used Erosion Function Apparatus (EFA) test to measure the erodibility of the soils and afterwards by using Chen 3D software, numerical simulations were performed on the levee to find out the velocity vectors in the overtopping water and the generated scour when the overtopping water impinges the levee. By analyzing the results from EFA test, an erosion chart to categorize erodibility of the soils was developed. Hughes and Nadal in 2009 studied the effect of combination of wave overtopping and storm surge overflow on the erosion and scour generation in levees. The study included hydraulic parameters and flow characteristics such as flow thickness, wave intervals, surge level above levee crown in analyzing scour development. According to the laboratory tests, empirical correlations related to average overtopping discharge were derived to analyze the resistance of levee against erosion. These equations could only fit to the situation, similar to the experimental tests, while they can give a reasonable estimation if applied to other conditions.

Osouli et al. (2014) and Karimpour et al. (2015) conducted lab scale physical modeling of levees to evaluate score characterization of different levees due to floodwall overtopping.

Another approach applied to prevent levee failures is electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). This non-destructive geophysical method can detect in advance critical saturation areas in embankments. ERT can thus be used in monitoring of seepage phenomena in earth structures and act as an early warning system, e.g., in critical parts of levees or embankments.

==Negative impacts==
Large scale structures designed to modify natural processes inevitably have some drawbacks or negative impacts.

=== Ecological impact ===
Levees interrupt floodplain ecosystems that developed under conditions of seasonal flooding. In many cases, the impact is two-fold, as reduced recurrence of flooding also facilitates land-use change from forested floodplain to farms.

=== Increased height ===
In a natural watershed, floodwaters spread over a landscape and slowly return to the river. Downstream, the delivery of water from the area of flooding is spread out in time. If levees keep the floodwaters inside a narrow channel, the water is delivered downstream over a shorter time period. The same volume of water over a shorter time interval means higher river stage (height). As more levees are built upstream, the recurrence interval for high-water events in the river increases, often requiring increases in levee height.

=== Levee breaches produce high-energy flooding ===
During natural flooding, water spilling over banks rises slowly. When a levee fails, a wall of water held back by the levee suddenly pours out over the landscape, much like a dam break. Impacted areas far from a breach may experience flooding similar to a natural event, while damage near a breach can be catastrophic, including carving out deep holes and channels in the nearby landscape. 

=== Prolonged flooding after levee failure ===
Under natural conditions, floodwaters return quickly to the river channel as water-levels drop. During a levee breach, water pours out into the floodplain and moves down-slope where it is blocked from return to the river. Flooding is prolonged over such areas, waiting for floodwater to slowly infiltrate and evaporate. 

=== Subsidence and seawater intrusion ===
Natural flooding adds a layer of sediment to the floodplain. The added weight of such layers over many centuries makes the crust sink deeper into the mantle, much like a floating block of wood is pushed deeper into the water if another board is added on top. The momentum of downward movement does not immediately stop when new sediment layers stop being added, resulting in subsidence (sinking of land surface). In coastal areas, this results in land dipping below sea level, the ocean migrating inland, and salt-water intruding into freshwater aquifers.

=== Coastal sediment loss ===
Where a large river spills out into the ocean, the velocity of the water suddenly slows and its ability to transport sand and silt decreases. Sediments begin to settle out, eventually forming a delta and extending to the coastline seaward. During subsequent flood events, water spilling out of the channel will find a shorter route to the ocean and begin building a new delta. Wave action and ocean currents redistribute some of the sediment to build beaches along the coast. When levees are constructed all the way to the ocean, sediments from flooding events are cut off, the river never migrates, and elevated river velocity delivers sediment to deep water where wave action and ocean currents cannot redistribute. Instead of a natural wedge shaped delta forming, a &quot;birds-foot delta&quot; extends far out into the ocean. The results for surrounding land include beach depletion, subsidence, salt-water intrusion, and land loss.

<doc id="43026" wikidata="Q339338" url="?curid=43026" title="Endianness">
<text>In computing, endianness is the order in which bytes within a word of digital data are transmitted over a data communication medium or addressed (by rising addresses) in computer memory, counting only byte significance compared to earliness. Endianness is primarily expressed as big-endian (BE) or little-endian (LE), terms introduced by Danny Cohen into computer science for data ordering in an Internet Experiment Note published in 1980. The adjective &quot;endian&quot; has its origin in the writings of 18th century Anglo-Irish writer Jonathan Swift. In the 1726 novel &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, he portrays the conflict between sects of Lilliputians divided into those breaking the shell of a boiled egg from the big end or from the little end. By analogy, a CPU may read a digital word big end first or little end first.

Computers store information in various-sized groups of binary bits. Each group is assigned a number, called its &quot;address&quot;, that the computer uses to access that data. On most modern computers, the smallest data group with an address is eight bits long and is called a byte. Larger groups comprise two or more bytes, for example, a 32-bit word contains four bytes. There are two possible ways a computer could number the individual bytes in a larger group, starting at either end. Both types of endianness are in widespread use in digital electronic engineering. The initial choice of endianness of a new design is often arbitrary, but later technology revisions and updates perpetuate the existing endianness to maintain backward compatibility.

A big-endian system stores the most significant byte of a word at the smallest memory address and the least significant byte at the largest. A little-endian system, in contrast, stores the least-significant byte at the smallest address. Of the two, big-endian is thus closer to the way the digits of numbers are written left-to-right in English, comparing digits to bytes. &quot;Bi-endianness&quot; is a feature supported by numerous computer architectures that feature switchable endianness in data fetches and stores or for instruction fetches. Other orderings are generically called &quot;middle-endian&quot; or &quot;mixed-endian&quot;.

Big-endianness is the dominant ordering in networking protocols, such as in the Internet protocol suite, where it is referred to as &quot;network order&quot;, transmitting the most significant byte first. Conversely, little-endianness is the dominant ordering for processor architectures (x86, most ARM implementations, base RISC-V implementations) and their associated memory. File formats can use either ordering; some formats use a mixture of both or contain an indicator of which ordering is used throughout the file.

== Characteristics ==
Computer memory consists of a sequence of storage cells (smallest addressable units); in machines that support byte addressing, those units are called &quot;bytes&quot;. Each byte is identified and accessed in hardware and software by its memory address. If the total number of bytes in memory is &quot;n&quot;, then addresses are enumerated from 0 to &quot;n&quot; − 1.

Computer programs often use data structures or fields that may consist of more data than can be stored in one byte. In the context of this article where its type cannot be arbitrarily complicated, a &quot;field&quot; consists of a consecutive sequence of bytes and represents a &quot;simple data value&quot; which – at least potentially – can be manipulated by &quot;one&quot; single hardware instruction. On most systems, the address of a multi-byte simple data value is the address of its first byte (the byte with the lowest address). There are exceptions to this rule – for example, the Add instruction of the IBM 1401 addresses variable-length fields at their low-order (highest-addressed) position with their lengths being defined by a word mark set at their high-order (lowest-addressed) position. When an operation such as addition is performed, the processor begins at the low-order positions at the high addresses of the two fields and works its way down to the high-order.

Another important attribute of a byte being part of a &quot;field&quot; is its &quot;significance&quot;.
These attributes of the parts of a field play an important role in the sequence the bytes are accessed by the computer hardware, more precisely: by the low-level algorithms contributing to the results of a computer instruction.

=== Numbers ===
Positional number systems (mostly base 2, or less often base 10) are the predominant way of representing and particularly of manipulating integer data by computers. In pure form this is valid for moderate sized non-negative integers, e.g. of C data type codice_1. In such a number system, the &quot;value&quot; of a digit which it contributes to the whole number is determined not only by its value as a single digit, but also by the position it holds in the complete number, called its significance. These positions can be mapped to memory mainly in two ways:

* Decreasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as &quot;big-endian&quot; and
* Increasing numeric significance with increasing memory addresses (or increasing time), known as &quot;little-endian&quot;.

In these expressions, the term &quot;end&quot; is meant as the extremity where the &quot;big&quot; resp. &quot;little&quot; significance is written &quot;first&quot;, namely where the field &quot;starts&quot;.

The integer data that are directly supported by the computer hardware have a fixed width of a low power of 2, e.g. 8 bits ≙ 1 byte, 16 bits ≙ 2 bytes, 32 bits ≙ 4 bytes, 64 bits ≙ 8 bytes, 128 bits ≙ 16 bytes. The low-level access sequence to the bytes of such a field depends on the operation to be performed. The least-significant byte is accessed first for addition, subtraction and multiplication. The most-significant byte is accessed first for division and comparison. See .

=== Text ===

When character (text) strings are to be compared with one another, e.g. in order to support some mechanism like sorting, this is very frequently done lexicographically where a single positional element (character) also has a positional value. Lexicographical comparison means almost everywhere: first character ranks highest – as in the telephone book. Almost all machines which can do this using a single instruction are big-endian or at least mixed-endian.

Integer numbers written as text are always represented most significant digit first in memory, which is similar to big-endian, independently of text direction.

=== Byte addressing ===
When memory bytes are printed sequentially from left to right (e.g. in a hex dump), little-endian representation of integers has the significance increasing from right to left. In other words, it appears backwards when visualized, which can be counter-intuitive.

This behavior arises, for example, in FourCC or similar techniques that involve packing characters into an integer, so that it becomes a sequence of specific characters in memory. For example, take the string &quot;JOHN&quot;, stored in hexadecimal ASCII. On big-endian machines, the value appears left-to-right, coinciding with the correct string order for reading the result (&quot;J O H N&quot;). But on a little-endian machine, one would see &quot;N H O J&quot;. Middle-endian machines complicate this even further; for example, on the PDP-11, the 32-bit value is stored as two 16-bit words &quot;JO&quot; &quot;HN&quot; in big-endian, with the characters in the 16-bit words being stored in little-endian, resulting in &quot;O J N H&quot;.

=== Byte swapping ===

Byte-swapping consists of rearranging bytes to change endianness. Many compilers provide built-ins that are likely to be compiled into native processor instructions (/), such as . Software interfaces for swapping include:

* Standard network endianness functions (from/to BE, up to 32-bit). Windows has a 64-bit extension in .
* BSD and Glibc functions (from/to BE and LE, up to 64-bit).
* macOS macros (from/to BE and LE, up to 64-bit).
* The function in C++23.

Some CPU instruction sets provide native support for endian byte swapping, such as (x86 — 486 and later, i960 — i960Jx and later), and (ARMv6 and later).

Some compilers have built-in facilities for byte swapping. For example, the Intel Fortran compiler supports the non-standard specifier when opening a file, e.g.: . Other compilers have options for generating code that globally enables the conversion for all file IO operations. This permits the reuse of code on a system with the opposite endianness without code modification.

== Considerations ==

=== Simplified access to part of a field ===

On most systems, the address of a multi-byte value is the address of its first byte (the byte with the lowest address); little-endian systems of that type have the property that, for sufficiently low data values, the same value can be read from memory at different lengths without using different addresses (even when alignment restrictions are imposed). For example, a 32-bit memory location with content can be read at the same address as either 8-bit (value = 4A), 16-bit (004A), 24-bit (00004A), or 32-bit (0000004A), all of which retain the same numeric value. Although this little-endian property is rarely used directly by high-level programmers, it is occasionally employed by code optimizers as well as by assembly language programmers. While not allowed by C++, such type punning code is allowed as &quot;implementation-defined&quot; by the C11 standard and commonly used in code interacting with hardware.

=== Calculation order ===

Some operations in positional number systems have a natural or preferred order in which the elementary steps are to be executed. This order may affect their performance on small-scale byte-addressable processors and microcontrollers. However, high-performance processors usually fetch multi-byte operands from memory in the same amount of time they would have fetched a single byte, so the complexity of the hardware is not affected by the byte ordering.

Addition, subtraction, and multiplication start at the least significant digit position and propagate the carry to the subsequent more significant position. On most systems, the address of a multi-byte value is the address of its first byte (the byte with the lowest address). The implementation of these operations is marginally simpler using little-endian machines where this first byte contains the least significant digit.

Comparison and division start at the most significant digit and propagate a possible carry to the subsequent less significant digits. For fixed-length numerical values (typically of length 1,2,4,8,16), the implementation of these operations is marginally simpler on big-endian machines.

Some big-endian processors (e.g. the IBM System/360 and its successors) contain hardware instructions for lexicographically comparing varying length character strings.

The normal data transport by an assignment statement is in principle independent of the endianness of the processor.

== Hardware ==

Many historical and extant processors use a big-endian memory representation, either exclusively or as a design option. The IBM System/360 uses big-endian byte order, as do its successors System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture. The PDP-10 uses big-endian addressing for byte-oriented instructions. The IBM Series/1 minicomputer uses big-endian byte order. The Motorola 6800 / 6801, the 6809 and the 68000 series of processors use the big-endian format. Solely big-endian architectures include the IBM z/Architecture and OpenRISC. The PDP-11 minicomputer, however, uses little-endian byte order, as does its VAX successor.

The Datapoint 2200 used simple bit-serial logic with little-endian to facilitate carry propagation. When Intel developed the 8008 microprocessor for Datapoint, they used little-endian for compatibility. However, as Intel was unable to deliver the 8008 in time, Datapoint used a medium-scale integration equivalent, but the little-endianness was retained in most Intel designs, including the MCS-48 and the 8086 and its x86 successors, including IA-32 and x86-64 processors. The MOS Technology 6502 family (including Western Design Center 65802 and 65C816), the Zilog Z80 (including Z180 and eZ80), the Altera Nios II, the Atmel AVR, the Andes Technology NDS32, the Qualcomm Hexagon, and many other processors and processor families are also little-endian.

The Intel 8051, unlike other Intel processors, expects 16-bit addresses for LJMP and LCALL in big-endian format; however, xCALL instructions store the return address onto the stack in little-endian format.

=== Bi-endianness ===

Some instruction set architectures feature a setting which allows for switchable endianness in data fetches and stores, instruction fetches, or both; those instruction set architectures are referred to as &quot;bi-endian&quot;. Architectures that support switchable endianness include PowerPC/Power ISA, SPARC V9, ARM versions 3 and above, DEC Alpha, MIPS, Intel i860, PA-RISC, SuperH SH-4, IA-64, C-Sky, and RISC-V. This feature can improve performance or simplify the logic of networking devices and software. The word &quot;bi-endian&quot;, when said of hardware, denotes the capability of the machine to compute or pass data in either endian format.

Many of these architectures can be switched via software to default to a specific endian format (usually done when the computer starts up); however, on some systems, the default endianness is selected by hardware on the motherboard and cannot be changed via software (e.g. Alpha, which runs only in big-endian mode on the Cray T3E).

IBM AIX and IBM i run in big-endian mode on bi-endian Power ISA; Linux originally ran in big-endian mode, but by 2019, IBM had transitioned to little-endian mode for Linux to ease the porting of Linux software from x86 to Power. SPARC has no relevant little-endian deployment, as both Oracle Solaris and Linux run in big-endian mode on bi-endian SPARC systems, and can be considered big-endian in practice. ARM, C-Sky, and RISC-V have no relevant big-endian deployments, and can be considered little-endian in practice.

The term &quot;bi-endian&quot; refers primarily to how a processor treats data accesses. Instruction accesses (fetches of instruction words) on a given processor may still assume a fixed endianness, even if data accesses are fully bi-endian, though this is not always the case, such as on Intel&#x27;s IA-64-based Itanium CPU, which allows both.

Some nominally bi-endian CPUs require motherboard help to fully switch endianness. For instance, the 32-bit desktop-oriented PowerPC processors in little-endian mode act as little-endian from the point of view of the executing programs, but they require the motherboard to perform a 64-bit swap across all 8 byte lanes to ensure that the little-endian view of things will apply to I/O devices. In the absence of this unusual motherboard hardware, device driver software must write to different addresses to undo the incomplete transformation and also must perform a normal byte swap.

Some CPUs, such as many PowerPC processors intended for embedded use and almost all SPARC processors, allow per-page choice of endianness.

SPARC processors since the late 1990s (SPARC v9 compliant processors) allow data endianness to be chosen with each individual instruction that loads from or stores to memory.

The ARM architecture supports two big-endian modes, called &quot;BE-8&quot; and &quot;BE-32&quot;. CPUs up to ARMv5 only support BE-32 or word-invariant mode. Here any naturally aligned 32-bit access works like in little-endian mode, but access to a byte or 16-bit word is redirected to the corresponding address and unaligned access is not allowed. ARMv6 introduces BE-8 or byte-invariant mode, where access to a single byte works as in little-endian mode, but accessing a 16-bit, 32-bit or (starting with ARMv8) 64-bit word results in a byte swap of the data. This simplifies unaligned memory access as well as memory-mapped access to registers other than 32-bit.

Many processors have instructions to convert a word in a register to the opposite endianness, that is, they swap the order of the bytes in a 16-, 32- or 64-bit word. 

Recent Intel x86 and x86-64 architecture CPUs have a MOVBE instruction (Intel Core since generation 4, after Atom), which fetches a big-endian format word from memory or writes a word into memory in big-endian format. These processors are otherwise thoroughly little-endian.

There are also devices which use different formats in different places. For instance, the BQ27421 Texas Instruments battery gauge uses the little-endian format for its registers and the big-endian format for its random-access memory.

SPARC historically used big-endian until version 9, which is bi-endian. Similarly early IBM POWER processors were big-endian, but the PowerPC and Power ISA descendants are now bi-endian. The ARM architecture was little-endian before version 3 when it became bi-endian.

=== Floating point ===

Although many processors use little-endian storage for all types of data (integer, floating point), there are a number of hardware architectures where floating-point numbers are represented in big-endian form while integers are represented in little-endian form. There are ARM processors that have mixed-endian floating-point representation for double-precision numbers: each of the two 32-bit words is stored as little-endian, but the most significant word is stored first. VAX floating point stores little-endian 16-bit words in big-endian order. Because there have been many floating-point formats with no network standard representation for them, the XDR standard uses big-endian IEEE 754 as its representation. It may therefore appear strange that the widespread IEEE 754 floating-point standard does not specify endianness. Theoretically, this means that even standard IEEE floating-point data written by one machine might not be readable by another. However, on modern standard computers (i.e., implementing IEEE 754), one may safely assume that the endianness is the same for floating-point numbers as for integers, making the conversion straightforward regardless of data type. Small embedded systems using special floating-point formats may be another matter, however.

=== Variable-length data ===

Most instructions considered so far contain the size (lengths) of their operands within the operation code. Frequently available operand lengths are 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16 bytes. But there are also architectures where the length of an operand may be held in a separate field of the instruction or with the operand itself, e.g. by means of a word mark. Such an approach allows operand lengths up to 256 bytes or larger. The data types of such operands are character strings or BCD. Machines able to manipulate such data with one instruction (e.g. compare, add) include the IBM 1401, 1410, 1620, System/360, System/370, ESA/390, and z/Architecture, all of them of type big-endian.

=== Middle-endian ===

Numerous other orderings, generically called &quot;middle-endian&quot; or &quot;mixed-endian&quot;, are possible.

The PDP-11 is in principle a 16-bit little-endian system. The instructions to convert between floating-point and integer values in the optional floating-point processor of the PDP-11/45, PDP-11/70, and in some later processors, stored 32-bit &quot;double precision integer long&quot; values with the 16-bit halves swapped from the expected little-endian order. The UNIX C compiler used the same format for 32-bit long integers. This ordering is known as &quot;PDP-endian&quot;.

UNIX was one of the first systems to allow the same code to be compiled for platforms with different internal representations. One of the first programs converted was supposed to print out , but on the Series/1 it printed instead.

A way to interpret this endianness is that it stores a 32-bit integer as two little-endian 16-bit words, with a big-endian word ordering:

Segment descriptors of IA-32 and compatible processors keep a 32-bit base address of the segment stored in little-endian order, but in four nonconsecutive bytes, at relative positions 2, 3, 4 and 7 of the descriptor start.

== Software ==

=== Logic design ===

Hardware description languages (HDLs) used to express digital logic often support arbitrary endianness, with arbitrary granularity. For example, in SystemVerilog, a word can be defined as little-endian or big-endian.

=== Files and filesystems ===

The recognition of endianness is important when reading a file or filesystem created on a computer with different endianness.

Fortran sequential unformatted files created with one endianness usually cannot be read on a system using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a record (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal to the number of bytes in the data. An attempt to read such a file using Fortran on a system of the other endianness results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect.

Unicode text can optionally start with a byte order mark (BOM) to signal the endianness of the file or stream. Its code point is U+FEFF. In UTF-32 for example, a big-endian file should start with ; a little-endian should start with .

Application binary data formats, such as MATLAB &quot;.mat&quot; files, or the &quot;.bil&quot; data format, used in topography, are usually endianness-independent. This is achieved by storing the data always in one fixed endianness or carrying with the data a switch to indicate the endianness. An example of the former is the binary XLS file format that is portable between Windows and Mac systems and always little-endian, requiring the Mac application to swap the bytes on load and save when running on a big-endian Motorola 68K or PowerPC processor.

TIFF image files are an example of the second strategy, whose header instructs the application about the endianness of their internal binary integers. If a file starts with the signature it means that integers are represented as big-endian, while means little-endian. Those signatures need a single 16-bit word each, and they are palindromes, so they are endianness independent. stands for Intel and stands for Motorola. Intel CPUs are little-endian, while Motorola 680x0 CPUs are big-endian. This explicit signature allows a TIFF reader program to swap bytes if necessary when a given file was generated by a TIFF writer program running on a computer with a different endianness.

As a consequence of its original implementation on the Intel 8080 platform, the operating system-independent File Allocation Table (FAT) file system is defined with little-endian byte ordering, even on platforms using another endianness natively, necessitating byte-swap operations for maintaining the FAT on these platforms.

ZFS, which combines a filesystem and a logical volume manager, is known to provide adaptive endianness and to work with both big-endian and little-endian systems.

=== Networking ===

Many IETF RFCs use the term &quot;network order&quot;, meaning the order of transmission for bytes &quot;over the wire&quot; in network protocols. Among others, the historic defines the network order for protocols in the Internet protocol suite to be big-endian.

However, not all protocols use big-endian byte order as the network order. The Server Message Block (SMB) protocol uses little-endian byte order. In CANopen, multi-byte parameters are always sent least significant byte first (little-endian). The same is true for Ethernet Powerlink.

The Berkeley sockets API defines a set of functions to convert 16- and 32-bit integers to and from network byte order: the (host-to-network-short) and (host-to-network-long) functions convert 16- and 32-bit values respectively from machine (&quot;host&quot;) to network order; the and functions convert from network to host order. These functions may be a no-op on a big-endian system.

While the high-level network protocols usually consider the byte (mostly meant as &quot;octet&quot;) as their atomic unit, the lowest layers of a network stack may deal with ordering of bits within a byte.

<doc id="43036" wikidata="Q207047" url="?curid=43036" title="Scoville scale">
<text>The Scoville scale is a measurement of pungency (spiciness or &quot;heat&quot;) of chili peppers and other substances, recorded in Scoville heat units (SHU). It is based on the concentration of capsaicinoids, among which capsaicin is the predominant component.

The scale is named after its creator, American pharmacist Wilbur Scoville, whose 1912 method is known as the Scoville organoleptic test. The Scoville organoleptic test is a subjective assessment derived from the capsaicinoid sensitivity by people experienced with eating hot chilis.

An alternative method, high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), can be used to analytically quantify the capsaicinoid content as an indicator of pungency.

== Scoville organoleptic test ==
In the Scoville organoleptic test, an exact weight of dried pepper is dissolved in alcohol to extract the heat components (capsaicinoids), then diluted in a solution of sugar water. Decreasing concentrations of the extracted capsaicinoids are given to a panel of five trained tasters, until a majority (at least three) can no longer detect the heat in a dilution. The heat level is based on this dilution, rated in multiples of 100 SHU.

Another source using subjective assessment stated, &quot;Conventional methods used in determining the level of pungency or capsaicin concentration are using a panel of tasters (Scoville organoleptic test method). ... Pepper pungency is measured in Scoville heat units (SHU). This measurement is the highest dilution of a chili pepper extract at which heat can be detected by a taste panel.&quot;

A weakness of the Scoville organoleptic test is its imprecision due to human subjectivity, depending on the taster&#x27;s palate and number of mouth heat receptors, which vary widely among subjects. Another shortcoming is sensory fatigue; the palate is quickly desensitized to capsaicinoids after tasting a few samples within a short time period. Results vary widely (up to ± 50%) between laboratories.

== Quantification by HPLC ==
Since the 1980s, spice heat has been assessed quantitatively by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), which measures the concentration of heat-producing capsaicinoids, typically with capsaicin content as the main measure. As stated in one review &quot;the most reliable, rapid, and efficient method to identify and quantify capsaicinoids is HPLC; the results of which can be converted to Scoville heat units by multiplying the parts-per-million by 16.&quot;

HPLC method gives results in American Spice Trade Association 1985 &quot;pungency units&quot;, which are defined as one part capsaicin equivalent per million parts dried pepper mass. This &quot;parts per million of heat&quot; (ppmH) is found with the following calculation: 
formula_1

Peak areas are calculated from HPLC traces of dry samples of the substance to be tested in 1 ml of acetonitrile. The standard used to calibrate the calculation is 1 gram of capsaicin. Scoville heat units are found by multiplying the ppmH value by a factor of 15. By this definition of ppmH, spicy compounds other than the two most important capsaicinoids are ignored, despite the ability of HPLC to measure these other compounds at the same time.

==Scoville ratings==

===Considerations===
Since Scoville ratings are defined per unit of dry mass, comparison of ratings between products having different water content can be misleading. For example, typical fresh chili peppers have a water content around 90%, whereas Tabasco sauce has a water content of 95%. For law-enforcement-grade pepper spray, values from 500,000 up to 5 million SHU have been reported, but the actual strength of the spray depends on the dilution. This problem can be overcome by stating the water content along with the Scoville value. One way to do so is the &quot;D-value&quot;, defined as total mass divided by dry mass.

Numerical results for any specimen vary depending on its cultivation conditions and the uncertainty of the laboratory methods used to assess the capsaicinoid content. Pungency values for any pepper are variable, owing to expected variation within a species, possibly by a factor of 10 or more, depending on seed lineage, climate and humidity, and soil composition supplying nutrients. The inaccuracies described in the measurement methods also contribute to the imprecision of these values.

===&quot;Capsicum&quot; peppers===
&quot;Capsicum&quot; chili peppers are commonly used to add pungency in cuisines worldwide. The range of pepper heat reflected by a Scoville score is from 500 or less (sweet peppers) to over 2.6 million (&quot;Pepper X&quot;) (table below; Scoville scales for individual chili peppers are in the respective linked article). Some peppers such as the Guntur chilli and Rocoto are excluded from the list due to their very wide SHU range. Others such as Dragon&#x27;s Breath and Chocolate 7-pot have not been officially verified.



The class of compounds causing pungency in plants such as chili peppers is called capsaicinoids, which display a linear correlation between concentration and Scoville scale, and may vary in content during ripening. Capsaicin is the major capsaicinoid in chili peppers.

The Scoville scale may be used to express the pungency of other, unrelated TRPV1 agonists, sometimes with extrapolation for much hotter compounds. One such substance is resiniferatoxin, an alkaloid present in the sap of some species of euphorbia plants (spurges). Since it is 1,000 times as hot as capsaicin, it would have a Scoville scale rating of 16 billion. In the table below, non-capsaicinoid compounds are italicized.

<doc id="43038" wikidata="Q4203961" url="?curid=43038" title="Propitiation">
<text>Propitiation is the act of appeasing or making well-disposed a deity, thus incurring divine favor or avoiding divine retribution. It is related to the idea of atonement and sometime mistakenly conflated with expiation. The discussion here encompasses usage only in the Christian tradition.

==Christian theology==

In Romans 3:25 the King James Version, New King James Version, New American Standard Bible, and the English Standard Version translates &quot;propitiation&quot; from the Greek word &quot;hilasterion&quot;. Concretely it specifically means the lid of The Ark of The Covenant. The only other occurrence of &quot;hilasterion&quot; in the NT is in Hebrews 9:5, where it is translated as &quot;mercy seat&quot; in all of the Bible translations named above as well as the Revised Standard Version and the New Revised Standard Version.

For many Christians it has the meaning of &quot;that which expiates or propitiates&quot; or &quot;the gift which procures propitiation&quot;. (KJV) reads: &quot;And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.&quot; There is frequent similar use of &quot;hilasterion&quot; in the Septuagint, ff. The mercy seat was sprinkled with blood on Yom Kippur (), representing that the righteous sentence of the Law had been executed, changing a judgment seat into a mercy seat (; compare with &quot;throne of grace&quot; in ; place of communion, ().

Another Greek word, &quot;hilasmos&quot;, is used for Christ as our propitiation in 1 John 2:2; 4:10; and in the Septuagint (; ; ). The thought in the OT sacrifices and in the NT fulfillment, is that Christ completely satisfied the just demands of the Holy Father for judgment on sin, by his death at Calvary (). &quot;TDNT&quot;, however, takes a different view of &quot;Hebrews: &quot;&quot;If the author uses the ritual as a means to portray Christ&#x27;s work, he also finds that in the new covenant the literal offerings of the ritual are replaced by the obedience of Christ (10:5ff.; cf. Ps. 40) and the Christian ministry of praise and mutual service (13:15-16; cf. Ps. 50). In other words, total self-giving, first that of Christ, and then, on this basis, that of his people, is the true meaning of sacrifice.

God, in view of the cross, is declared righteous in having been able to justify sins in the OT period, as well as in being able to forgive sinners under the New Covenant (; cf. , note).

Writing in &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bible Dictionary&quot; (1952), Methodist theologian Edwin Lewis summarizes Paul&#x27;s teaching in Romans 3 that God&#x27;s attitude toward sin is revealed &quot;through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus&quot; (Rom. 3:23-26). &quot;The nature of sin must be set forth through the very means through which reconciliation is to be brought about: this means the sacrificial death of Jesus Christ, which is therefore &#x27;a propitiation&#x27; (v. 25 KJV). ... God&#x27;s righteousness, which makes sin a barrier to fellowship, and God&#x27;s love, which would destroy the barrier, are revealed and satisfied in one and the same means, the gift of Christ to be the Mediator between Himself and men.&quot;

==Propitiation and expiation==

=== Book of Common Prayer ===
The Church of England&#x27;s Book of Common Prayer (1662), following the prayer of confession before reception of Holy Communion, the priest is to offer &quot;comfortable words&quot; which consist of a series of four verses from the New Testament. The final text is from 1 John 2:1-2 (KJV): &quot;If any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the propitiation for our sins.&quot; The same text was used in the American editions of 1789 and 1928. However, in the Episcopal Church&#x27;s 1979 Book of Common Prayer, in the Rite One form, &quot;propitiation&quot; was changed to read &quot;perfect offering,&quot; and with the rest of verse 2 added: &quot;and not for ours only, but for the sins of the whole world.&quot;

=== Reformation theology ===
The case for translating &quot;hilasterion&quot; as &quot;expiation&quot; instead of &quot;propitiation&quot; was put forward by British scholar C. H. Dodd in 1935 and at first gained wide support. Scottish scholars Francis Davidson and G.T. Thompson, writing in &quot;The New Bible Commentary&quot;, first published in 1953, state that &quot;The idea is not that of conciliation of an angry God by sinful humanity, but of expiation of sin by a merciful God through the atoning death of His Son. It does not necessarily exclude, however, the reality of righteous wrath because of sin.&quot; The Anglican theologian and biblical scholar Austin Farrer, writing a quarter century after Dodd, argued that Paul&#x27;s words in Romans 3 should be translated in terms of expiation rather than propitiation: &quot;God himself, says St Paul, so far from being wrathful against us, or from needing to be propitiated, loved us enough to set forth Christ as an expiation of our sins through his blood.&quot;

&quot;Hilasterion&quot; is translated as &quot;expiation&quot; in the Revised Standard Version and the New American Bible (Revised Edition), and as &quot;the means of expiating sin&quot; in the New English Bible and the Revised English Bible. The New Revised Standard Version and the New International Version translate this as &quot;sacrifice of atonement&quot;.

Dodd argued that in pagan Greek the translation of &quot;hilasterion&quot; was indeed to propitiate, but that in the Septuagint (the oldest Greek translation of the Hebrew OT) that &quot;kapporeth&quot; (Hebrew for &quot;covering&quot;) is often translated with words that mean &quot;to cleanse or remove&quot;. This view was initially challenged by Roger Nicole in twenty-one arguments. Later it was also challenged by Leon Morris who argued that because of the focus in the book of Romans on God&#x27;s wrath, that the concept of &quot;hilasterion&quot; needed to include the appeasement of God&#x27;s wrath. Writing in the &quot;New Bible Dictionary&quot;, Morris states that &quot;Propitiation is a reminder that God is implacably opposed to everything that is evil, that his opposition may properly be described as &#x27;wrath&#x27;, and that this wrath is put away only by the atoning work of Christ.&quot;

Presbyterian scholar Henry S. Gehman of Princeton Theological Seminary in his &quot;New Westminster Bible Dictionary&quot; (1970) argued that for &quot;hilasterion&quot; in Romans 3:25 and &quot;hilasmos&quot; in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10, &quot;In these cases RSV more properly has &#x27;expiation,&#x27; which means the extinguishing of guilt by suffering a penalty or offering a sacrifice as an equivalent. ... It is God who sent forth his Son to be the expiation of sin. Through the death of Christ sins are expiated or annulled, and fellowship is restored.&quot;

Likewise, the Anglican theologian and biblical scholar Reginald H. Fuller, writing in &quot;The Oxford Companion to the Bible&quot;, has noted that while the precise meaning of &quot;hilasterion&quot; is disputed, and while some translate it as &quot;propitiation&quot;, this, he says, &quot;suggests appeasing or placating an angry deity-- a notion hardly compatible with biblical thought and rarely occurring in that sense in the Hebrew Bible. It requires God as its object, whereas in this hymn [Romans 3:24-25] God is the subject: &#x27;whom God put forward.&#x27; ... Accordingly, the rendering &#x27;expiation&#x27; is the most probable.&quot;

In his semantic study of &quot;hilasterion&quot; David Hill, of the University of Sheffield, claims that Dodd leaves out several Septuagint references to propitiation, and cites apocryphal sources.

Many Reformed theologians stress the idea of propitiation because it specifically addresses dealing with God&#x27;s wrath, and consider it to be a necessary element for understanding how the atonement as penal substitution makes possible Christ&#x27;s propitiation for sins by dying in the place of sinners. Critics of penal substitutionary atonement state that seeing the Atonement as appeasing God is a &quot;pagan&quot; idea that makes God seem tyrannical.

J. I. Packer in &quot;Knowing God&quot;, first published in 1973, designates a distinct difference between pagan and Christian propitiation: &quot;In paganism, man propitiates his gods, and religion becomes a form of commercialism and, indeed, of bribery. In Christianity, however, God propitiates his wrath by his own action. He set forth Jesus Christ, says Paul, to be the propitiation of our sins.&quot;

John Stott writes that propitiation &quot;does not make God gracious...God does not love us because Christ died for us, Christ died for us because God loves us&quot;. John Calvin, quoting Augustine from &quot;John&#x27;s Gospel&quot; cx.6, writes, &quot;Our being reconciled by the death of Christ must not be understood as if the Son reconciled us, in order that the Father, then hating, might begin to love us&quot;. Continuing the quote: &quot;... but that we were reconciled to him already, loving, though at enmity with us because of sin. To the truth of both propositions we have the attestation of the Apostle, &#x27;God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us,&#x27; (Rom. 5: 8.) Therefore, he had this love towards us even when, exercising enmity towards him, we were the workers of iniquity. Accordingly, in a manner wondrous and divine, he loved even when he hated us.&quot;

Packer also cites God&#x27;s love as the impetus that provides Christ&#x27;s sacrifice for the reconciliation of mankind and hence the removal of God&#x27;s wrath. According to Packer, propitiation (and the wrath of God that propitiation implies) is necessary to properly define God&#x27;s love; God could not be righteous and &quot;His love would degenerate into sentimentality (without Christ&#x27;s death containing aspects of propitiation).The wrath of God is as personal, and as potent, as his Love.&quot;

Thus the definition of Christian propitiation asserted by Calvin, Packer and Murray holds that within God there is a dichotomy of love and anger, but through propitiation love trumps anger, abolishing it. &quot;&#x27;The doctrine of the propitiation is precisely this that God loved the objects of His wrath so much that He gave His own Son to the end that He by His blood should make provision for the removal of this wrath... (John Murray, &quot;The Atonement&quot;, p. 15)&#x27;&quot;

=== Contemporary Catholic theology ===
The Latin Vulgate translates &quot;hilasterion&quot; in Romans 3:25, and &quot;hilasmos&quot; in 1 John 4:10, as &quot;propitiationem&quot;, and this is carried over to the Douay-Rheims Bible as &quot;propitiation&quot;. This was also the case with the Confraternity Bible (New Testament 1941). However the promulgation of the encyclical &quot;Divino Afflante Spiritu&quot; in 1943, and the Second Vatican Council document &quot;Dei verbum&quot; in 1965, led to increased engagement with biblical manuscripts in the original languages, and ecumenical cooperation in Bible translation. A Catholic Edition of the Revised Standard Version New Testament was published in 1965. And an &quot;imprimatur&quot; was granted in 1966 to the Oxford Annotated Bible with the Apocrypha by Richard Cardinal Cushing of Boston. Another ecumenical edition of the RSV was published as the Common Bible in 1973. In 1970 the first edition of the New American Bible was published. In both the RSV and the NAB, &quot;hilasterion&quot; in Romans 3:25, and &quot;hilasmos&quot; in 1 John 2:2 and 4:10, are translated as &quot;expiation.&quot;

The NAB includes a note on the use of &quot;expiation&quot; in Romans 3:25, explaining that &quot;this rendering is preferable to &#x27;propitiation,&#x27; which suggests hostility on the part of God toward sinners. As Paul will be at pains to point out (5:8-10), it is humanity that is hostile to God.&quot;

Raymond E. Brown in the &quot;New Jerome Biblical Commentary&quot; argues that in the NT sacrifice (&quot;hilasterion&quot;) does not appease God&#x27;s wrath but is best expressed from its Jewish roots (76.89–95) as atonement or expiation (82.73). Recent Catholic studies have depended heavily on the Trinitarian perspective presented by Jesuit theologian Edward J. Kilmartin:
 Sacrifice is not, in the first place, an activity of human beings directed to God and, in the second place, something that reaches its goal in the response of divine acceptance and bestowal of divine blessing on the cultic community. Rather, sacrifice in the New Testament understanding – and thus in its Christian understanding – is, in the first place, the self-offering of the Father in the gift of his Son, and in the second place the unique response of the Son in his humanity to the Father, and in the third place, the self-offering of believers in union with Christ by which they share in his covenant relationship with the Father.Jesuit theologian Robert Daly has explained the background for this renewed understanding. Daly points out that the initiative is entirely with the Father who &quot;loved us and sent his Son as expiation for our sins&quot; (1 John 4:10 NAB), and that &quot;when we see the sacrifice of Christ and the sacrifice of the Mass as a Trinitarian event, we see that, strictly speaking, there are no recipients.&quot; He compares the Eucharist to a marriage ceremony that receives its meaning by becoming the reality of one&#x27;s life.

The French Jesuit theologian and biblical scholar Stanislas Lyonnet has explained the Johannine usage of the term, &quot;When St. John in two different places alludes first to the heavenly intercession of Christ before the Father (1 John 2.2), and then to the work accomplished here below by His death and resurrection (1 Jn 4.10), he declares that He is or that the Father has made Him a &quot;&#x27;hilasmos&quot; for our sins.&#x27; This term certainly carries the same meaning which it always has in O.T. Greek (Vulgate Ps 130.4) and which the Latin word &quot;propitiatio&quot; also always conveys in the liturgy: through Christ and in Christ, the Father achieves the plan of His eternal love (1 Jn 4.8) in &#x27;showing Himself propitious,&#x27; that is in &#x27;pardoning&#x27; men, by an efficacious pardon which really destroys sins, which &#x27;purifies&#x27; man and communicates to him God&#x27;s own life (1 Jn 4.9).&quot;

Along similar lines, the entry on &quot;sacrifice&quot; in the &quot;Theological Dictionary of the New Testament&quot;, after reviewing the epistles of Paul and Hebrews, concludes that &quot;total self-giving, first that of Christ, and then, on this basis, that of his people, is the true meaning of sacrifice.&quot; And Cardinal-theologian Walter Kasper, in his book &quot;The God of Jesus Christ&quot;, concludes that what Jesus effected was to give suffering &quot;eternal import, the import of love.&quot; Kasper points out that Gregory of Nyssa and Augustine of Hippo, working out of the New Testament, speak of a God who can freely choose to feel compassion, which implies suffering. Kasper adds that: &quot;It is Origen who gave us the clearest statement. In Origen&#x27;s words: &#x27;First God suffered, then he came down. What was the suffering he accepted for us? The suffering of love.&#x27; Origen adds that it is not just the Son but also the Father who suffers so. This is made possible by God&#x27;s freedom in love.&quot;

Currently, however, some scripture scholars contend that using the word &quot;propitiation&quot; was a mistranslation by Jerome from the Greek &quot;hilastērion&quot; into the Latin Vulgate, and is misleading for describing the sacrifice of Jesus and its Eucharistic remembrance. One expression of the conclusion of theologians is that sacrifice &quot;is not something human beings do to God (that would be propitiation) but something which God does for human kind (which is expiation).&quot;

<text>An omphalos is a religious stone artefact. In Ancient Greek, the word () means &quot;navel&quot;. Among the Ancient Greeks, it was a widespread belief that Delphi was the center of the world. According to the myths regarding the founding of the Delphic Oracle, Zeus, in his attempt to locate the center of the Earth, launched two eagles from the two ends of the world, and the eagles, starting simultaneously and flying at equal speed, crossed their paths above the area of Delphi, and so that was the place where Zeus placed the stone. The Latin term is umbilicus mundi, &#x27;navel of the world&#x27;.

Omphalos is also the name of the stone given to Cronus. 

== Delphi ==
Most accounts locate the Delphi omphalos in the adyton (sacred part of the temple) near the Pythia (oracle). The stone sculpture itself, which may be a copy, has a carving of a knotted net covering its surface and a hollow center, widening towards the base. The omphalos represents the stone which Rhea wrapped in swaddling clothes, pretending it was Zeus, in order to deceive Cronus. (Cronus was the father who swallowed his children so as to prevent them from usurping him as he had deposed his own father, Uranus.)

Omphalos stones were believed to allow direct communication with the gods. Holland (1933) suggested that the stone was hollow to allow intoxicating vapours breathed by the Oracle to channel through it. Erwin Rohde wrote that the Python at Delphi was an earth spirit, who was conquered by Apollo and buried under the Omphalos. However, understanding of the use of the omphalos is uncertain due to destruction of the site by Theodosius I and Arcadius in the 4th century CE.

== Art ==
&quot;Omphalos&quot; is a public art sculpture by Dimitri Hadzi formerly located in the Harvard Square, Cambridge, Massachusetts under the Arts on the Line program. , the sculpture has been deinstalled; it will be relocated to Rockport, Massachusetts.

&quot;Omfalos&quot; is a concrete and rock sculpture by the conceptual artist Lars Vilks, previously standing in the Kullaberg nature reserve, Skåne County, Sweden. As of 2001, the sculpture belongs to the collections of Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden.

== Literature ==
In literature, the word &quot;omphalos&quot; has held various meanings but usually refers to the stone at Delphi. Authors who have used the term include: Homer, Pausanias, D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, Philip K. Dick, Jacques Derrida, Ted Chiang, Sandy Hingston and Seamus Heaney. For example, Joyce uses the term in the novel, &quot;Ulysses&quot;:

In Ted Chiang&#x27;s short story &quot;Omphalos&quot; (2019), the protagonist is forced to question her belief about where the center of the world is located.

In “The Toome Road”, a Seamus Heaney poem from the 1979 anthology Field Work, Heaney writes about an encounter with a convoy of armoured cars in Northern Ireland, “… O charioteers, above your dormant guns, 
It stands here still, stands vibrant as you pass, 
The invisible, untoppable omphalos.”

== Omphalos syndrome ==
&quot;Omphalos syndrome&quot; refers to the belief that a place of geopolitical power and currency is the most important place in the world.

<text>Gigi () is a 1944 novella by French writer Colette. The plot focuses on a young Parisian girl being groomed for a career as a courtesan and her relationship with the wealthy cultured man named Gaston who falls in love with her and eventually marries her.

The novel was translated into English by Roger Senhouse and published (with &quot;The Cat&quot; translated by Antonia White) in 1953.

The life story of Yola Letellier, 
the wife of Henri Letellier (publisher of &quot;Le Journal&quot; and mayor of Deauville (1925–1928)), was the inspiration for the novel.

==Adaptations==
The novella was the basis for a 1949 French film starring Danièle Delorme and Gaby Morlay. 

In 1951, it was adapted for the stage by Anita Loos. Colette had personally picked the yet unknown Audrey Hepburn on first sight to play the title role. Her Aunt Alicia was played by stage legend Cathleen Nesbitt, who was to become Hepburn&#x27;s acting mentor from that time on. Opening on Broadway at the Fulton Theatre on 24 November 1951, the play ran for 219 performances (finishing on 31 May 1952) and Hepburn&#x27;s Broadway debut earned her a Theatre World Award.

A 1958 musical film version, starring Leslie Caron in the title role, with a screenplay by Alan Jay Lerner and a score by Lerner and Frederick Loewe, won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Lerner and Loewe adapted the film for an expurgated 1973 stage musical that proved to be unsuccessful but was revived on Broadway in 2015.

<text>The National Center for Science Education (NCSE) is a not-for-profit membership organization in the United States whose stated mission is to educate the press and the public on the scientific and educational aspects of controversies surrounding the teaching of evolution and climate change, and to provide information and resources to schools, parents, and other citizens working to keep those topics in public school science education. 

Based in Oakland, California, it claims 4,500 members that include scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens of varied religious and political affiliations. The Center opposes the teaching of religious views in science classes in America&#x27;s public schools; it does this through initiatives such as Project Steve. The Center has been called the &quot;leading anti-creationist organization&quot; in the United States. The Center is affiliated with the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

NCSE is currently a member of the National Coalition Against Censorship.

==History==
In 1980 Stanley L. Weinberg, a veteran high-school teacher in Iowa, began to organize statewide Committees of Correspondence &quot;committed to the defense of education in evolutionary theory,&quot; modelled upon the committees of correspondence in pre-Revolutionary America. Their purpose was to keep interested parties informed about creationist endeavours and to share ideas for responses, allowing a political response at a local level. This grew into volunteer networks in most states, with the &quot;Creation/Evolution Newsletter&quot; interconnecting them, which was incorporated as the NCSE in 1983. In 1987, author and lecturer Eugenie Scott became its executive director. The Board of Directors and official supporters, as explained by NCSE, &quot;reflects our scientific roots.&quot;

In the 1990s, based upon its monitoring of creationist efforts, it issued warnings of high levels of official anti-evolutionism and a &quot;sharp surge upwards&quot; in creationist attacks on evolution, including attempts to downgrade evolution from &quot;fact&quot; to &quot;theory&quot; (see evolution as theory and fact) or present the &quot;evidence against evolution&quot; (see objections to evolution).

The organization&#x27;s supporters include Bruce Alberts, former President of the National Academy of Sciences; Donald Johanson, discoverer of the &quot;Lucy&quot; fossil; and evolutionary biologist Francisco J. Ayala. Also the late paleontologist and writer Stephen Jay Gould was a long-time supporter. As of 2012, the group has 4500 members who are &quot;scientists, teachers, clergy, and citizens with diverse religious and political affiliations.&quot;

Amanda L. Townley has been the organization&#x27;s Executive Director since December 2023. She replaced Ann Reid, who had been appointed to the position in 2013. Previously, Eugenie C. Scott served as executive director for 27 years, 1986 to 2013.

== Activities and programs ==
The NCSE maintains up-to-date listings of current events and information regarding creationist and antievolution advocacy, as well as about evolution education. Historian of science Michael Shermer describes its website as being one of &quot;the two best resources on the Internet on the evolution/creation topic&quot; (the other being TalkOrigins Archive). The NCSE also opposes intelligent design and other &quot;alternatives&quot; to evolution because it says they are misleading euphemisms for creationism.

NCSE &quot;is religiously neutral, though it cooperates nationally and locally with religious organizations, as well as scientific and educational organizations like the National Academy of Sciences, the National Association of Biology Teachers, and the National Science Teachers Association.&quot; Its willingness to engage positively with, and avoid taking sides against, religiously minded supporters of evolution has been noted by historian of creationism Ronald L. Numbers and atheist author Richard Dawkins.

The NCSE offers a variety of lecturers, including biologists, anthropologists, philosophers, and theologians, for topics relating to evolution, science, and education. Also it hosts activities including trips and conferences. It publishes Reports of the National Center for Science Education bimonthly, containing peer-reviewed articles, book reviews, and news. From 1980 to 1997, it published the Creation/Evolution Journal, which has since been merged into &quot;Reports of the National Center for Science Education&quot;. Additionally, it publishes books, such as a compilation of scientific analyses of creationist books.

In 2003, the NCSE gained international attention with Project Steve.

In 2005, the NCSE assisted the plaintiffs in &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, the most prominent case testing the constitutionality of intelligent design in public school science classes, and put their extensive library of creationist materials at the plaintiffs&#x27; disposal. Nick Matzke, the NCSE&#x27;s Public Information Project Director at the time, served as liaison to the legal team, and was responsible for uncovering the substitution of &quot;intelligent design&quot; for &quot;creationism&quot; within drafts of &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;, which became a devastating part of the testimony of Barbara Forrest (also an NCSE Director), and was cited extensively in Judge John E. Jones III&#x27;s .

In April 2008, the NCSE launched Expelled Exposed, a website critical of the alleged documentary &quot;&quot; starring Ben Stein. The website received press attention and a large amount of traffic.

In 2012, the NCSE announced they would be engaged in efforts to keep climate change education, and global warming issues, safe from threats from special interests. They have developed a series of lessons addressing climate change misconceptions and offer teacher training through a Teacher Ambassador program. 

==Media==
Eugenie Scott appeared on Uncommon Knowledge, as NCSE spokesperson, twice in 2001 debating intelligent design creationist William A. Dembski. Then in 2004, NCSE was represented by Scott on Penn and Teller&#x27;s Showtime television show &quot;Bullshit!&quot; on the episode &quot;Creationism&quot;. Scott offered scientific views about the creationist and intelligent design movements. She noted, &quot;it would be unfair to tell students that there is a serious dispute going on among scientists whether evolution took place. There&#x27;s not.&quot; She further noted that &quot;a lot of the time the creationists ... they&#x27;ll search through scientific journals and try to pull out something they think demonstrates evolution doesn&#x27;t work and there is a kind of interesting rationale behind it. Their theology is such that if one thing is wrong with the Bible you have to throw it all out so that&#x27;s why Genesis has to be interpreted literally. They look at science the same way. If one little piece of the evolutionary puzzle doesn&#x27;t fit the whole thing has to go.&quot; Scott then explained &quot;that&#x27;s not the way science is done.&quot;

In November 2007 Scott discussed the NCSE&#x27;s exploration of intelligent design on the NOVA documentary &quot;Judgment Day: Intelligent Design on Trial&quot;, which documented &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;.

<doc id="43047" wikidata="Q725955" url="?curid=43047" title="Edwards v. Aguillard">
<text>Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578 (1987), was a United States Supreme Court case concerning the constitutionality of teaching creationism. The Court considered a Louisiana law requiring that where evolutionary science was taught in public schools, creation science must also be taught. The constitutionality of the law was successfully challenged in District Court, Aguillard v. Treen, 634 F. Supp. 426 (ED La.1985), and the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, &quot;Aguillard v. Edwards,&quot; 765 F.2d 1251 (CA5 1985). The United States Supreme Court ruled that this law violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. In its decision, the court opined that &quot;teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.&quot;

In support of Aguillard, 72 Nobel Prize-winning scientists, 17 state academies of science, and seven other scientific organizations filed amicus briefs that described creation science as being composed of religious tenets.

==Background==

Modern American creationism arose from the theological split over modernist higher criticism and its rejection by the fundamentalist Christian movement, which promoted biblical literalism and, post 1920, took up the anti-evolution cause led by William Jennings Bryan. The teaching of evolution had become a common part of the public school curriculum, but his campaign was based on the idea that &quot;Darwinism&quot; had caused German militarism and threatened traditional religion and morality. Several states passed legislation to ban or restrict the teaching of evolution. The Tennessee Butler Act was tested in the Scopes trial of 1925, and continued in effect with the result that many schools did not teach evolution.

When the United States sought to catch up in science during the 1960s with new teaching standards, which reintroduced evolution, the creation science movement arose, presenting what was claimed to be scientific evidence supporting young Earth creationism. Attempts were made to reintroduce legal bans, but the Supreme Court ruled in 1968&#x27;s &quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot; that bans on teaching evolutionary biology are unconstitutional as they violate the establishment clause of the United States Constitution, which forbids the government from advancing a particular religion.

In the early 1980s, several states attempted to introduce creationism alongside the teaching of evolution, and the Louisiana legislature passed a law, authored by State Senator Bill P. Keith of Caddo Parish, entitled the &quot;Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act.&quot; The Act did not require teaching either creationism or evolution, but did require that, if evolutionary science was taught, then &quot;creation science&quot; must be taught as well. Creationists lobbied aggressively for the law. The stated purpose of the Act was to protect &quot;academic freedom&quot;. Counsel for the state later admitted at the Supreme Court oral argument that the &quot;legislature may not [have] used the term &#x27;academic freedom&#x27; in the correct legal sense. They might have [had] in mind, instead, a basic concept of fairness; teaching all the evidence.&quot; Governor David C. Treen signed the bill into law in 1981.

The District Court in Aguillard v. Treen, 634 F. Supp. 426 (ED La.1985), and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, 765 F.2d 1251 (CA5 1985), ruled against Louisiana, finding that its actual purpose in enacting the statute was to promote the religious doctrine of &quot;creation science&quot;. An Arkansas District Court previously held in a 1982 decision in &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot; that a similar &quot;balanced treatment&quot; statute violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. Arkansas did not appeal the loss. Creationists believed the statute at issue in &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; had a better chance of passing constitutional muster, and so Louisiana appealed its loss in the trial and appellate courts to the Supreme Court.

The case was styled &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; because by the time the case reached the Supreme Court, Edwin Edwards had succeeded David Treen as governor of Louisiana, which was being sued, and Don Aguillard, a science teacher and assistant principal at Acadiana High School in Lafayette Parish, Louisiana, was the lead original plaintiff in District Court among a group of Louisiana teachers, students, parents, scientists, and clergy.

==Result==
On June 19, 1987, the Supreme Court, in a seven-to-two majority opinion written by Justice William J. Brennan, ruled that the Act constituted an unconstitutional infringement on the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, based on the three-pronged &quot;Lemon&quot; test, which is:
# The government&#x27;s action must have a legitimate secular purpose;
# The government&#x27;s action must not have the primary effect of either advancing or inhibiting religion; and
# The government&#x27;s action must not result in an &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; of the government and religion.

The Supreme Court held that the Act is facially invalid as violative of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, because it lacks a clear secular purpose (first part of the above &quot;Lemon&quot; test), since (a) the Act does not further its stated secular purpose of &quot;protecting academic freedom&quot;, and (b) the Act impermissibly endorses religion by advancing the religious belief that a supernatural being created humankind.

However, it did note that alternative scientific theories could be taught:
The Court found that, although the Louisiana legislature had stated that its purpose was to &quot;protect academic freedom&quot;, that purpose was dubious because the Act gave Louisiana teachers no freedom they did not already possess and instead limited their ability to determine what scientific principles should be taught. Because it was unconvinced by the state&#x27;s proffered secular purpose, the Court went on to find that the legislature had a &quot;preeminent religious purpose in enacting this statute&quot;.

==Dissent==
Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, dissented, accepting the Act&#x27;s stated purpose of &quot;protecting academic freedom&quot; as a sincere and legitimate secular purpose. They interpreted the term &quot;academic freedom&quot; to refer to &quot;students&#x27; freedom from indoctrination&quot;, in this case their freedom &quot;to decide for themselves how life began, based upon a fair and balanced presentation of the scientific evidence&quot;. However, they also criticized the first prong of the Lemon test, noting that &quot;to look for the sole purpose of even a single legislator is probably to look for something that does not exist&quot;.

==Consequences and aftermath==
The ruling was one in a series of developments addressing issues related to the American creationist movement and the separation of church and state. The scope of the ruling affected public schools and did not include independent schools, home schools, Sunday schools and Christian schools, which remained free to teach creationism.

During the case, creationists worked on a creationist biology textbook, with the hope of a huge market if the appeal went their way. Drafts were given various titles, including &quot;Biology and Creation&quot;. After the &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; ruling, the authors changed the terms &quot;creation&quot; and &quot;creationists&quot; in the text to &quot;intelligent design&quot; and &quot;design proponents&quot;, and the book was published as &quot;Of Pandas and People&quot;. This supplementary textbook for school use attacked evolutionary biology without mentioning the identity of the &quot;intelligent designer&quot;. Promotion of intelligent design creationism by the intelligent design movement eventually led to the textbook&#x27;s use in a school district being challenged in another court case. &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot; went to trial on September 26, 2005, and was decided in U.S. District Court on December 20, 2005, in favor of the plaintiffs, who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The 139-page opinion of &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover&quot; was hailed as a landmark decision, firmly establishing that creationism and intelligent design were religious teachings and not areas of legitimate scientific research. Because the Dover school board chose not to appeal, the case never reached a circuit court or the U.S. Supreme Court.

Wendell Bird served as a special assistant attorney general for Louisiana in the case and later became a staff attorney for the Institute for Creation Research and Association of Christian Schools International. Bird later authored books promoting creationism and teaching it in public schools.

<doc id="43050" wikidata="Q1096404" url="?curid=43050" title="Neo-Darwinism">
<text>Neo-Darwinism is generally used to describe any integration of Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection with Gregor Mendel&#x27;s theory of genetics. It mostly refers to evolutionary theory from either 1895 (for the combinations of Darwin&#x27;s and August Weismann&#x27;s theories of evolution) or 1942 (&quot;modern synthesis&quot;), but it can mean any new Darwinian- and Mendelian-based theory, such as the current evolutionary theory.

==Original use==

Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution by natural selection, as published in 1859, provided a selection mechanism for evolution, but not a trait transfer mechanism. Lamarckism was still a very popular candidate for this. August Weismann and Alfred Russel Wallace rejected the Lamarckian idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics that Darwin had accepted and later expanded upon in his writings on heredity. The basis for the complete rejection of Lamarckism was Weismann&#x27;s germ plasm theory. Weismann realised that the cells that produce the germ plasm, or gametes (such as sperm and eggs in animals), separate from the somatic cells that go on to make other body tissues at an early stage in development. Since he could see no obvious means of communication between the two, he asserted that the inheritance of acquired characteristics was therefore impossible; a conclusion now known as the Weismann barrier.

It is, however, usually George Romanes who is credited with the first use of the word in a scientific context. Romanes used the term to describe the combination of natural selection and Weismann&#x27;s germ plasm theory that evolution occurs solely through natural selection, and not by the inheritance of acquired characteristics resulting from use or disuse, thus using the word to mean &quot;Darwinism without Lamarckism.&quot;

Following the development, from about 1918 to 1947, of the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology, the term neo-Darwinian started to be used to refer to that contemporary evolutionary theory.

==Current meaning==
Biologists, however, have not limited their application of the term &quot;neo-Darwinism&quot; to the historical synthesis. For example, Ernst Mayr wrote in 1984 that:
:The term &quot;neo-Darwinism&quot; for the synthetic theory [of the early 20th century] is sometimes considered wrong, because the term neo-Darwinism was coined by Romanes in 1895 as a designation of Weismann&#x27;s theory.

Publications such as &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; use &quot;neo-Darwinism&quot; to refer to current-consensus evolutionary theory, not the version prevalent during the early 20th century. Similarly, Richard Dawkins and Stephen Jay Gould have used &quot;neo-Darwinism&quot; in their writings and lectures to denote the forms of evolutionary biology that were contemporary when they were writing.

<doc id="43051" wikidata="Q622137" url="?curid=43051" title="Lehigh University">
<text>Lehigh University (LU) is a private research university in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, United States. The university was established in 1865 by businessman Asa Packer. Lehigh University&#x27;s undergraduate programs have been coeducational since the 1971–72 academic year. , the university had 5,911 undergraduate students and 1,781 graduate students.

Lehigh has five colleges: the P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science, the College of Arts and Sciences, the College of Business, the College of Education, and the College of Health. The College of Arts and Sciences is the largest, with 38% of the university&#x27;s students. The university offers Interdisciplinary Studies, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts, Master of Science, Master of Business Administration, Master of Engineering, Master of Education, Doctor of Philosophy, and Doctor of Education degrees.

The university is classified among &quot;Doctoral Universities R1: Very High Research Activity&quot;.

==Campuses==

Lehigh University is located in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, in the historically industrial Lehigh Valley region of eastern Pennsylvania. Lehigh encompasses , including of recreational and playing fields and 150 buildings comprising four million square feet of floor space. It is organized into three contiguous campuses on and around South Mountain, including:
*The Asa Packer Campus, built into the northern slope of the mountain, the university&#x27;s original and primary campus;
*The Mountaintop Campus, atop South Mountain, including intramural sports fields, Imbt Laboratories, and Iacocca Hall; and
*The Murray H. Goodman Campus, immediately south, where a 16,000-seat stadium and some of Lehigh University&#x27;s sports facilities are located.

In May 2012, Lehigh was the beneficiary a gift of 755 acres of property in nearby Upper Saucon Township, Pennsylvania from the Donald B. and Dorothy L. Stabler Foundation. The gift from the estate of the long-time benefactor allowed the university to expand to its current size of 2,350 acres across all its campuses, and to consider new long-term potential uses for the university&#x27;s new properties.

==Administration==
As a private institution, Lehigh University is governed by its board of trustees, established 1866. The board can have no less than 18, nor more than 35 members at any given time. The board selects the university president, as well as their vice presidents who operate as &quot;executive agents&quot; of the board.

===Presidents===

===Student governance===
In 1988, a student senate was created at the university to act as a governing body for undergraduate students, though it is empowered only to offer recommendations to the university&#x27;s board. Still, the student senate still has an impact as it determines which clubs receive funding and which are authorized to be listed as official university clubs. A separate student senate exists for graduate students, known as GSS, which focuses on advocacy for grant procurement and graduate student travel costs to visit sites.

==Academics==

, Lehigh has 584 full-time faculty members, with 95% holding a doctorate degree or the highest degree in their field. Faculty members are required to have a minimum of four office hours per week.

Lehigh&#x27;s average class size is 28 students; the student-to-faculty ratio is 10:1.

The university offers undergraduate enrollment to all its colleges except its College of Education. Students are permitted to take courses or major and minor in subjects outside of their respective college. The university operates on a semester system.

===Colleges===

==== College of Arts and Sciences ====
Based in Maginnes Hall, the College of Arts and Sciences offers a variety of humanities courses and visual arts programs and many music programs, including a marching band, the Wind Ensemble, and the Philharmonic orchestra. It has a dedicated Humanities Center, which is the site for many literature and other arts-based programs, including the Drown Writers Series. Lehigh also has a program called ArtsLehigh, oriented towards enhancing interest in the arts on campus.

==== College of Business ====
Lehigh introduced business and economics classes in 1893, with the first dedicated classes in economics being offered in 1897 and the first professor of economics being hired by the school, John L. Stewart, in 1898. Stewart is credited with creating the College of Business in 1918, establishing its original courses and teaching most of the classes himself. The college&#x27;s inaugural class of 1922 numbered just 77. Through the 1930s the College of Business Administration stayed consistent, with around 10 professors and 350 students, and in 1938 was accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business, with enrollment that year jumping to 465, or 25% of the total student body. In 1952 the College of Business Administration began offering a five-year course in Industrial engineering and business, as well as graduate courses for Master of Business Administration degrees and was expanded to include Master of Science degrees by 1964. In 1957 the college moved from Coppée Hall to the purpose-built Drown Hall.

==== College of Education ====
More than 7,000 students have received master&#x27;s, education specialist, Pennsylvania Department of Education teaching certificates and certifications, doctoral degrees, and professional certificates from Lehigh&#x27;s College of Education .

==== P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science ====
Graduates of Lehigh&#x27;s P.C. Rossin College of Engineering and Applied Science invented the escalator and founded Packard Motor Car Company and the companies that built the locks and lockgates of the Panama Canal. Other notable alumni include Roger Penske, Lee Iacocca, John W. Fisher, and Terry Hart. Tau Beta Pi, the engineering honor society, was founded at Lehigh. In 2005, George Tamaro, a Lehigh University master&#x27;s degree in civil engineering alumnus, was the John Fritz Medal award recipient, issued by the American Association of Engineering Societies.

==== College of Health ====
Lehigh&#x27;s College of Health offers classes in biostatistics, epidemiology, population health data science, and others related to population health. The college opened on August 21, 2020, and was the first in the world to offer undergraduate, graduate, and executive degrees in population health. It is based at the Health, Science, and Technology (HST) building which opened in January 2022.

==Student life==

===Fraternities and sororities===
A large majority of Lehigh&#x27;s social fraternities and sororities have their own university-owned houses; most of the fraternities and sororities are located along Upper and Lower Sayre Park Roads in a region known as &quot;The Hill&quot;.

Lehigh has one of the highest levels of student participation in fraternities and sororities; approximately 34% of undergraduates are members of a fraternity or sorority. During new member education, Greek life membership rises to almost 45%. There are 10 fraternities, all of which are housed on campus, and eight sororities, all of which are housed on campus.

Lehigh&#x27;s &quot;golden age of fraternities&quot; came in the mid-1980s when there were 36 fraternities on campus, all located on &quot;The Hill&quot;. Sororities were notably forced to operate off campus. When the drinking age was increased to 21, fraternities started to run into frequent hazing incidents and disciplinary issues which resulted in many of them being forced by the school to disband in the 1990s. Many of their former houses were transitioned to sorority houses and a few were demolished to make way for more dorms. As of 2024, some of the houses on &quot;The Hill&quot; remain vacant.

===Traditions and student newspaper===
Lehigh&#x27;s school colors, brown and white, date back to 1874, and the school newspaper, &quot;The Brown and White&quot;, has been continuously published since 1894.

Lehigh University is home to several unique and cherished traditions, particularly during the annual Spirit Week leading up to the Lehigh-Lafayette football game.

One of the highlights is the Bed Races, where students form teams, decorate beds, and drag race them down Packer Avenue. Initially, students constructed their own beds to demonstrate their engineering skills.

Orientation Week also features class flag presentations at &quot;The Rally,&quot; where each class is represented by an official flag passed down by their adopting class, 50 years their senior. The oldest surviving class flag dates back to 1889.

The Lehigh-Lafayette football rivalry, which began in 1884, is one of the most celebrated in college football, with the two schools having met more times than any other rivalry in the nation.

The Marching 97 band also plays a key role in Le-Laf Week, performing traditional Lehigh fight songs as they parade through campus. The &quot;Eco-flame&quot; tradition, originating in the 1970s when Professor Rich Aaronson invited the band to perform for his ECO 001 class, remains a staple of the week.

Campus-wide events such as Lehigh After Dark’s carnival and the GO campaign launch, which featured a Halsey concert, bring students from various class years and interest groups together, further enhancing the community spirit.

===ROTC===

Since 1919 Lehigh maintains a unit in the Army Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps, the Steel Battalion of the 2nd ROTC Brigade, which is headquartered in Jordan Hall on the mountaintop campus.

==Athletics==

As a member of the Patriot League, Lehigh competes in 25 different NCAA Division I sports. Lehigh&#x27;s 2006 student-athlete graduation rate of 97% ranked 12th among all 326 NCAA Division I institutions. In 2002, it won the inaugural &quot;USA Today&quot;/NCAA Foundation Award for having the nation&#x27;s top graduation rate of all Division I institutions.

Lehigh graduates have gone on to professional careers in the National Football League, Major League Baseball, Major League Soccer, and the National Basketball Association as players, scouts, coaches, and owners. Lehigh graduates have competed in the Super Bowl and won gold medals for the U.S. at the Olympic Games. While it is not a school sport, a number of Lehigh alumni, including Roger Penske, Al Holbert, and John Fitch, went on to successful careers in auto racing.

===Basketball===

Lehigh&#x27;s fifth trip to the NCAA tournament in 2012 proved to be their most notable to date, thanks to its first-round game as a #15 seed on March 16, 2012, against the #2 seed Duke Blue Devils. Despite being a heavy underdog, thanks to CJ McCollum&#x27;s 30-point heroics, the Mountain Hawks pulled off the stunning upset, defeating the Blue Devils 75-70 and making it only the sixth time that a 15th seed had defeated a second seed.

===Football===

Lehigh University and nearby Lafayette College are rivals in sports. Since 1884, the two football teams have met over 150 times, making the game between the two programs, known as The Rivalry, the most played in the history of college football.

The rivalry between Lehigh and Lafayette is also the longest uninterrupted rivalry in college football; the teams have played annually since 1897. For the 150th meeting, the teams played before a sold-out Yankee Stadium in New York City.

The week leading up to the game features traditional festivities, including decorating fraternity houses, parties, rallies and the Marching 97 performing unexpectedly during classes the Friday before the game.

===Wrestling===
The most storied athletic program at Lehigh is its wrestling team, which began in 1910. Over the past several decades, the Lehigh wrestling team has produced 158 All-Americans and had numerous squads finish with Top 20 NCAA national rankings, including finishing second in the nation in 1939. In 2008, the athletic department hired Pat Santoro, a two-time national champion and two-time winner of the EIWA Coach of the Year (2009, 2012) as Lehigh&#x27;s head wrestling coach.

Home dual meets and tournaments take place in Leeman-Turner Arena at Grace Hall, on the university&#x27;s main campus. Commonly known as &quot;The Snake Pit&quot;, it has been the home of Lehigh wrestling since 1942. In 2013, Grace Hall was converted into the Caruso Wrestling Complex, including a visiting area and Lehigh&#x27;s College Wrestling Wall of Fame.

In March 2017, Lehigh wrestler and Bethlehem native Darian Cruz won the NCAA Division I national wrestling tournament, becoming Lehigh&#x27;s first national champion since Zach Rey, Lehigh&#x27;s current assistant wrestling coach, won the title in the heavyweight division six years earlier, in 2011.

=== Lacrosse ===
Lehigh University&#x27;s lacrosse program is a prominent part of Lehigh&#x27;s athletic offerings, with both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams competing at the Division I level. The men&#x27;s team and women&#x27;s team compete in the Patriot League.

The men&#x27;s lacrosse team has achieved historic success over the years, including four Patriot League Championships. The team earned an automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament in 2024 after rallying to defeat Boston University 11–10 in the championship game.

==The Clery Act==
On April 5, 1986, Jeanne Clery, a 19-year-old Lehigh freshman, was raped and murdered in her Lehigh dorm room; the perpetrator, a Lehigh student, was apprehended, tried, and sentenced to death. In 1990, the backlash against unreported crimes on numerous campuses across the country led the United States Congress to pass the Jeanne Clery Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act, known as the Clery Act, which requires that colleges reveal information regarding crime on their campuses.
