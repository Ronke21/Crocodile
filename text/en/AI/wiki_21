<text>The Green Mountain Boys were a militia organization established in 1770 in the territory between the British provinces of New York and New Hampshire, known as the New Hampshire Grants and later in 1777 as the Vermont Republic (which later became the state of Vermont). Headed by Ethan Allen and members of his extended family, it was instrumental in resisting New York&#x27;s attempts to control the territory, over which it had won &quot;de jure&quot; control in a territorial dispute with New Hampshire.

Some companies served in the American Revolutionary War, including notably when the Green Mountain Boys, led under the command of Ethan Allen who was assisted by Benedict Arnold, captured Fort Ticonderoga on Lake Champlain on May 10, 1775, and invaded Canada later in 1775. In early June 1775, Ethan Allen and his then subordinate, Seth Warner, induced the Continental Congress at Philadelphia to create a Continental Army ranger regiment from the then New Hampshire Grants. Having no treasury, the Congress directed that New York&#x27;s revolutionary Congress pay for the newly authorized regiment. In July 1775, Allen&#x27;s militia was granted support from the New York revolutionary Congress.

The Green Mountain Boys disbanded more than a year before Vermont declared its independence in 1777 from Great Britain &quot;as a separate, free and independent jurisdiction or state&quot;. The Vermont Republic operated for 14 years, before being admitted in 1791 to the United States as the 14th state.

The remnants of the Green Mountain Boys militia were largely reconstituted as the Green Mountain Continental Rangers. Command of the newly formed regiment passed from Allen to Seth Warner. Allen joined the staff of the Northern Army of New York&#x27;s Major General Philip Schuyler and was given the rank of lieutenant colonel. Under Warner the regiment fought at the battles of Hubbardton and Bennington in 1777. The regiment was disbanded in 1779.
==History==

The original &quot;Green Mountain Boys&quot; were a militia organized in what is now southwestern Vermont in the decade prior to the American Revolutionary War. They comprised settlers and land speculators who held New Hampshire titles to lands between the Connecticut River and Lake Champlain, an area then known as the New Hampshire Grants, that is now modern Vermont. New York was given legal control of the area by a decision of the British crown and refused to respect the New Hampshire titles and town charters. Although a few towns with New York land titles, notably Brattleboro on the Connecticut River, supported the change, the vast majority of the settlers in the sparsely populated frontier region rejected the authority of New York. 

With several hundred members, the Green Mountain Boys effectively controlled the area where New Hampshire grants had been issued. They were led by Ethan Allen, his brother Ira Allen, and their cousins Seth Warner and Remember Baker. They were based at the Catamount Tavern in Bennington. By the 1770s, the Green Mountain Boys had become an armed military force and &quot;de facto&quot; government, which was also a militia, that prevented New York from exercising its authority in the northeast portion of the Province of New York. New York authorities had standing warrants for the arrest of the leaders of the rebellious Vermonters but were unable to exercise them. New York surveyors and other officials attempting to exercise their authority were prevented from doing so and in some cases were severely beaten, and settlers arriving to clear and work land under New York–issued grants were forced off their land, and sometimes had their possessions destroyed. At the same time, New York sought to extend its authority over the territory. During an event once known as the Westminster massacre, anti-Yorkers occupied the courthouse in Westminster to prevent a New York judge from holding court, and two men were killed in the ensuing standoff. Ethan Allen then went to Westminster with a band of Boys and organized a convention calling for the territory&#x27;s independence from New York.

When the American Revolutionary War started in 1775, Ethan Allen and a troop of his men, along with Connecticut Colonel Benedict Arnold, marched up to Lake Champlain and captured the strategically important British military posts at Fort Ticonderoga, Crown Point, and Fort George, all in New York. The Boys also briefly held St. John&#x27;s in Québec, but retreated on word of arriving British regulars.

In Summer 1775, the Green Mountain Boys became the basis for the Green Mountain Rangers, a regiment in the Continental Army that selected colonel Seth Warner as its leader. Some of the Green Mountain Boys preferred to remain with Ethan Allen and were taken prisoners along with Allen in August 1775 in a bungled attempt to capture the city of Montreal. Among them were Congressman Matthew Lyon and Lieutenant Benjamin Tucker. 

Vermont eventually declared itself an independent nation in January 1777, and organized a government based in Windsor. The armed forces of the Vermont Republic was based upon the Green Mountain Boys. Although Vermont initially supported the American Revolutionary War and sent troops to fight John Burgoyne&#x27;s British invasion from Quebec in battles at Hubbardton and Bennington in 1777, Vermont eventually adopted a more neutral stance and became a haven for deserters from both the British and colonial armies. George Washington, who had more than sufficient difficulties with the British, brushed off Congressional demands that he subdue Vermont. During the Haldimand Affair, some members of the Green Mountain Boys became involved in secret negotiations with British officials about restoring the Crown&#x27;s rule over the territory.

The &quot;Vermont Army&quot; version of the Green Mountain Boys faded away after Vermont joined the United States as the 14th U.S. state in 1791, although the Green Mountain Boys mustered for the War of 1812, The Civil War, the Spanish–American War, and following World War I as the Vermont National Guard.

==Flag==

A remnant of a Green Mountain Boys flag, believed to have belonged to John Stark, is owned by the Bennington Museum. It still exists as one of the few regimental flags from the time of the American Revolution. Although Stark was at the Battle of Bennington and likely flew this flag, the battle has become more commonly associated with the Bennington flag, which is believed to be a 19th-century banner.

==Vermont National Guard==

The Vermont Army National Guard and Vermont Air National Guard are collectively known as the Vermont National Guard or &quot;Green Mountain Boys.&quot; Both units use the original Green Mountain Boys battle flag as their banner.

<text>Mark the Evangelist (Koinē Greek: Μᾶρκος, : &quot;Mârkos&quot;), also known as [[John Mark]] (Koinē Greek: Ἰωάννης Μᾶρκος, &quot;Iōánnēs Mârkos;&quot; Aramaic&quot;: ܝܘܚܢܢ, romanized: Yōḥannān&quot;) or Saint Mark, was the person who is traditionally ascribed to be the author of the Gospel of Mark. Most modern Bible scholars have concluded that the Gospel of Mark was written by an anonymous author rather than an identifiable historical figure, though the topic remains contentious among experts. According to Church tradition, Mark founded the episcopal see of Alexandria, which was one of the five most important sees of early Christianity. His feast day is celebrated on April 25, and his symbol is the winged lion.

==Identity==

According to William Lane (1974), an &quot;unbroken tradition&quot; identifies Mark the Evangelist with John Mark, and John Mark as the cousin of Barnabas. However, Hippolytus of Rome, in &quot;On the Seventy Apostles&quot;, distinguishes Mark the Evangelist (2 Timothy 4:11), John Mark (Acts 12:12, 25; 13:5, 13; 15:37), and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (Colossians 4:10; Philemon 24). According to Hippolytus, they all belonged to the &quot;Seventy Disciples&quot; who were sent out by Jesus to disseminate the gospel (Luke 10:1ff.) in Judea.

According to Eusebius of Caesarea, Herod Agrippa I, in his first year of reign over the whole of Judea (AD 41), killed James, son of Zebedee and arrested Peter, planning to kill him after the Passover. Peter was saved miraculously by angels, and escaped out of the realm of Herod (Acts 12:1–19). Peter went to Antioch, then through Asia Minor (visiting the churches in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, as mentioned in 1 Peter 1:1), and arrived in Rome in the second year of Emperor Claudius (AD 42). Somewhere on the way, Peter encountered Mark and took him as travel companion and interpreter. Mark the Evangelist wrote down the sermons of Peter, thus composing the Gospel according to Mark, before he left for Alexandria in the third year of Claudius (AD 43).

According to the Acts 15:39, Mark went to Cyprus with Barnabas after the Council of Jerusalem.

According to tradition, in AD 49, about 16 years after the Ascension of Jesus, Mark travelled to Alexandria and founded the Church of Alexandria, having already been in Egypt for 4-5 years. The Coptic Orthodox Church, the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria, and the Coptic Catholic Church all trace their origins to this original community. Aspects of the Coptic liturgy can be traced back to Mark himself. He became the first bishop of Alexandria and he is honoured as the founder of Christianity in Africa.

According to Eusebius, Mark was succeeded by Anianus as the bishop of Alexandria in the eighth year of Nero (62/63), probably, but not definitely, due to his coming death. Later Coptic tradition says that he was martyred in 68.

Modern Bible scholars (i.e. most critical scholars) have concluded that the Gospel of Mark was written by an anonymous author rather than by Mark. For instance, the author of the Gospel of Mark knew very little about the geography of the region (having apparently never visited it), &quot;was very far from being a peasant or a fisherman&quot;, was unacquainted with Jewish customs (unlikely for someone from Palestine), and was probably &quot;a Hellenized Jew who lived outside of Palestine&quot;. Mitchell Reddish does concede that the name of the author might have been Mark (making the gospel possibly homonymous), but the identity of this Mark is unknown. Similarly, &quot;Francis Moloney suggests the author was someone named Mark, though maybe not any of the Marks mentioned in the New Testament&quot;. &quot;The Routledge Encyclopedia of the Historical Jesus&quot; takes the same approach: the author was named Mark, but scholars are undecided who this Mark was.

The four canonical gospels are anonymous and most researchers agree that none of them was written by eyewitnesses. 

==Biblical and traditional information==
Evidence for Mark the Evangelist&#x27;s authorship of the Gospel of Mark that bears his name originates with Papias (). Scholars of the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School are &quot;almost certain&quot; that Papias is referencing John Mark. Modern mainstream Bible scholars find Papias&#x27;s information difficult to interpret.

The Coptic Church accords with identifying Mark the Evangelist with John Mark, as well as that he was one of the Seventy Disciples sent out by Jesus (Luke 10:1), as Hippolytus confirmed. Coptic tradition also holds that Mark the Evangelist hosted the disciples in his house after Jesus&#x27;s death, that the resurrected Jesus came to Mark&#x27;s house (John 20), and that the Holy Spirit descended on the disciples at Pentecost in the same house. Furthermore, Mark is also believed to have been among the servants at the Marriage at Cana who poured out the water that Jesus turned to wine (John 2:1–11).

According to the Coptic tradition, Mark was born in Cyrene, a city in the Pentapolis of North Africa (now Libya). This tradition adds that Mark returned to Pentapolis later in life, after being sent by Paul to Colossae (Colossians 4:10; Philemon 24.) Some, however, think these actually refer to Mark the Cousin of Barnabas), and serving with him in Rome (2 Timothy 4:11); from Pentapolis he made his way to Alexandria. When Mark returned to Alexandria, the pagans of the city resented his efforts to turn the Alexandrians away from the worship of their traditional gods. In AD 68, they placed a rope around his neck and dragged him through the streets until he was dead.

==Veneration==
The Feast of St Mark is observed on April 25 by the Catholic and Eastern Orthodox Churches. For those Churches still using the Julian calendar, April 25 according to it aligns with May 8 on the Gregorian calendar until the year 2099. The Coptic Orthodox Church observes the Feast of St Mark on Parmouti 30 according to the Coptic calendar which always aligns with April 25 on the Julian calendar or May 8 on the Gregorian calendar.

Where John Mark is distinguished from Mark the Evangelist, John Mark is celebrated on September 27 (as in the Roman Martyrology) and Mark the Evangelist on April 25.

Mark is remembered in the Church of England and in much of the Anglican Communion, with a Festival on 25 April.

==In art==

Mark the Evangelist is most often depicted writing or holding his gospel. In Christian tradition, Mark the Evangelist is symbolized by a winged lion.

Mark the Evangelist attributes are the lion in the desert; he can be depicted as a bishop on a throne decorated with lions; as a man helping Venetian sailors. He is often depicted holding a book with &quot;pax tibi Marce&quot; written on it or holding a palm and book. Other depictions of Mark show him as a man with a book or scroll, accompanied by a winged lion. The lion might also be associated with Jesus&#x27; Resurrection because lions were believed to sleep with open eyes, thus a comparison with Christ in his tomb, and Christ as king.

Mark the Evangelist can be depicted as a man with a halter around his neck and as rescuing Christian slaves from Saracens.

<text>Telugu (; , ) is a classical Dravidian language native to the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where it is also the official language. Spoken by about 96 million people (2022), Telugu is the most widely spoken member of the Dravidian language family, and one of the twenty-two scheduled languages of the Republic of India. It is one of the few languages that has primary official status in more than one Indian state, alongside Hindi and Bengali. Telugu is one of the languages designated as a classical language by the Government of India. It is the 14th most spoken native language in the world. Modern Standard Telugu is based on the dialect of erstwhile Krishna, Guntur, East Godavari and West Godavari districts of Coastal Andhra.

Telugu is also spoken in the states of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and the union territories of Puducherry and Andaman and Nicobar Islands. It is also spoken by members of the Telugu diaspora spread across countries like United States, Australia, Malaysia, Mauritius, UAE, Saudi Arabia and others. Telugu is the fastest-growing language in the United States. It is also a protected language in South Africa and is offered as an optional third language in schools in KwaZulu-Natal province.

According to Mikhail S. Andronov, Telugu split from the Proto-Dravidian language around 1000 BCE. The earliest Telugu words appear in Prakrit inscriptions dating to , found in Bhattiprolu, Andhra Pradesh. Telugu label inscriptions and Prakrit inscriptions containing Telugu words have been dated to the era of Emperor Ashoka (257 BCE), as well as to the Satavahana and Vishnukundina periods. Inscriptions in Old Telugu script were found as far away as Indonesia and Myanmar. Telugu has been in use as an official language for over 1,400 years and has served as the court language for numerous dynasties in Southern and Eastern India, including the Eastern Chalukyas, Eastern Gangas, Kakatiyas, Vijayanagara Empire, Qutb Shahis, Madurai Nayaks, and Thanjavur Nayaks. It was also used as an official language outside its homeland, even by non-Telugu dynasties such as the Thanjavur Marathas in Tamil Nadu.

Telugu has an unbroken, prolific, and diverse literary tradition of over a thousand years. Pavuluri Mallana&#x27;s &quot;Sāra Sangraha Ganitamu&quot; () is the first scientific treatise on mathematics in any Dravidian language. Avadhānaṃ, a literary performance that requires immense memory power and an in-depth knowledge of literature and prosody, originated and was specially cultivated among Telugu poets for over five centuries. Roughly 10,000 pre-colonial inscriptions exist in Telugu.

In the precolonial era, Telugu became the language of high culture throughout South India. Vijaya Ramaswamy compared it to the overwhelming dominance of French as the cultural language of Europe during roughly the same era. Telugu also predominates in the evolution of Carnatic music, one of two main subgenres of Indian classical music and is widely taught in music colleges focusing on Carnatic tradition. Over the centuries, many non-Telugu speakers have praised the natural musicality of Telugu speech, referring to it as a mellifluous and euphonious language.
== Etymology ==

Speakers of Telugu refer to it as simply &quot;Telugu&quot; or &quot;Telugoo&quot;. Older forms of the name include &quot;Teluṅgu&quot; and &quot;Tenuṅgu&quot;. &quot;Tenugu&quot; is derived from the Proto-Dravidian word &quot;*ten&quot; (&quot;south&quot;) to mean &quot;the people who lived in the south/southern direction&quot; (relative to Sanskrit and Prakrit-speaking peoples). The name &quot;Telugu&quot;, then, is a result of an &quot;n&quot; to &quot;l&quot; alternation established in Telugu.

The popular belief holds that Telugu is derived from Trilinga of Trilinga Kshetras being the land bounded by the three Lingas which is Telugu homeland. P. Chenchiah and Bhujanga Rao note that Atharvana Acharya in the 13th century wrote a grammar of Telugu, calling it the &quot;Trilinga Śabdānusāsana (or Trilinga Grammar)&quot;. However, most scholars note that Atharvana&#x27;s grammar was titled &quot;Atharvana Karikavali.&quot; Appa Kavi in the 17th century explicitly wrote that &quot;Telugu&quot; was derived from &quot;Trilinga&quot;. Scholar C. P. Brown made a comment that it was a &quot;strange notion&quot; since the predecessors of Appa Kavi had no knowledge of such a derivation.

George Abraham Grierson and other linguists doubt this derivation, holding rather that &quot;Telugu&quot; was the older term and &quot;Trilinga&quot; must be the later Sanskritisation of it. If so the derivation itself must have been quite ancient because &quot;Triglyphum&quot;, &quot;Trilingum&quot; and &quot;Modogalingam&quot; are attested in ancient Greek sources, the last of which can be interpreted as a Telugu rendition of &quot;Trilinga&quot;.

== History ==
Telugu, as a Dravidian language, descends from Proto-Dravidian, a proto-language. Linguistic reconstruction suggests that Proto-Dravidian was spoken around the fourth millennium BCE. Comparative linguistics confirms that Telugu belongs to the South Dravidian-II (also called South-Central Dravidian) sub-group, which also includes the non-literary languages like Gondi, Kuvi, Koya, Pengo, Konda and Manda.

Proto-Telugu is the reconstructed linguistic ancestor of all the dialects and registers of Telugu. Russian linguist Mikhail S. Andronov, places the split of Telugu at 1000 BCE.

The linguistic history of Telugu is periodised as follows:
* Pre-historic Telugu ( 600 BCE–200 BCE)
* Old Telugu (200 BCE–1000 CE)
* Middle Telugu (1000 CE–1600 CE)
* Modern Telugu (1600 CE–present)

=== Pre-historic Telugu (c. 600 BCE – 200 BCE) ===
Pre-historic Telugu is identified with the period around 600 BCE or even earlier. Pre-historic Telugu is considered one of the most conservative languages of the Dravidian family based on its linguistic features.

* Plural Markers: One notable feature is the presence of contrast in plural markers, such as &quot;-ḷ&quot; and &quot;-nkkVḷ&quot; (a combination of &quot;-nkk&quot; and &quot;-Vḷ&quot;), which was lost in the earliest forms of many other Dravidian languages. Examples include &quot;pū-ḷ&quot; (flowers), &quot;ā-ḷ&quot; (cows), distinct from &quot;kolan-kuḷ&quot; (tanks), and &quot;ī-gaḷ&quot; (houseflies).
* Nominative Markers: The nominative markers were &quot;-nḏu&quot; (masc.sg.p1) and &quot;-aṁbu&quot; (inanimate.sg), which continued to appear in early inscriptions.
* Personal Pronouns: Reconstructed personal pronouns include &quot;ñān&quot; (I) with the oblique form &quot;ñā&quot;, and &quot;ñām&quot; or &quot;ēm&quot; (we).
* Phonemic Retention: The early language displayed high phonemic retention, with characteristic phonemes like the voiced retroflex approximant (&quot;ḻ&quot; or /ɻ/) and the voiced alveolar plosive (&quot;ḏ&quot; or /d/), which evolved into the alveolar trill (&quot;ṟ&quot; or /r/) in different positions. Both /d/ and /r/ are evidenced as distinct phonemes in early epigraphic records.
* Tenses: Tenses were structured as &quot;past vs non-past,&quot; and gender was categorized as &quot;masculine vs non-masculine.&quot;
* Demonstratives: Three demonstratives were in use: &quot;ā&quot; (distant &#x27;that&#x27;), &quot;ī&quot; (proximate &#x27;this&#x27;), and &quot;ū&quot; (intermediate &#x27;yonder&#x27;; in Classical Telugu, &quot;ulla&quot;).
* Non-Palatalized Initials: Non-palatalized initials are identified in words like &quot;kēsiri&quot; (&quot;they did&quot;), found in inscriptions up until the 8th century CE.
* Word Endings: Words typically ended in vowels, though some had consonant endings with sonorants like &quot;-y&quot;, &quot;-r&quot;, &quot;-m&quot;, &quot;-n&quot;, &quot;-l&quot;, &quot;-ḷ&quot;, &quot;-ḻ&quot;, and &quot;-w&quot;. Classical Telugu developed an epenthetic &quot;-u&quot; that vowelized the final consonant, a feature that has been partly retained in Modern Telugu.
* Place Name Suffixes: Archaic place name suffixes include &quot;-puḻōl&quot;, &quot;-ūr&quot;, &quot;-paḷḷiya&quot;, &quot;-pāḷiyam&quot;, &quot;-paṟṟu&quot;, &quot;-konḏa&quot;, &quot;-pūṇḍi&quot;, &quot;-paṭṭaṇa(ṁbu)&quot;, &quot;pāḻu&quot;, &quot;paṟiti&quot;, and &quot;pāka(m)&quot;.
* Apical Displacement: Apical displacement was underway for certain words.
* Conjunctive Marker: The conjunctive marker &quot;-um&quot; had various structural applications.

=== Earliest records ===
One of the earliest Telugu words, &quot;nágabu&quot;, found at the Amaravati Stupa, is dated to around 200 BCE. This word was further analyzed by Iravatham Mahadevan in his attempts to decipher the Indus script. Several Telugu words, primarily personal and place names, were identified at Amaravati, Nagarjunakonda, Krishna river basin, Ballari, Eluru, Ongole and Nellore between 200 BCE and 500 CE.

The Ghantasala Brahmin inscription and the pillar inscription of Vijaya Satakarni at Vijayapuri, Nagarjunakonda, and other locations date to the first century CE. Additionally, the Tummalagudem inscription of the Vishnukundinas dates to the 5th century CE. Telugu place names in Prakrit inscriptions are attested from the 2nd century CE onwards.

A number of Telugu words were found in the Sanskrit and Prakrit inscriptions of the Satavahana dynasty, Vishnukundina dynasty, and Andhra Ikshvakus. The coin legends of the Satavahanas, in all areas and all periods, used a Prakrit dialect without exception. Some reverse coin legends are in Telugu and Tamil languages.

=== Post-Ikshvaku period ===
The period from the 4th century CE to 1022 CE marks the second phase of Telugu history, following the Andhra Ikshvaku period. The first long inscription entirely in Telugu, dated to 575 CE, is attributed to the Renati Choda king Dhanunjaya and found in the Kadapa district.

An early Telugu label inscription, &quot;tolacuwānḍru&quot; (తొలచువాండ్రు; ), is found on one of the rock-cut caves around the Keesaragutta temple, 35 kilometers from Hyderabad. This inscription is dated to the Vishnukundina period of around 400 CE and is the earliest known short Telugu inscription from the Telangana region.

Several titles of Mahendravarman I in Telugu language, dated to , were inscribed on cave-inscriptions in Tamil Nadu.

From the 6th century onwards, complete Telugu inscriptions began to appear in districts neighbouring Kadapa such as Prakasam and Palnadu. Metrically composed Telugu inscriptions and those with ornamental or literary prose appear from 630 CE. The Madras Museum plates of Balliya-Choda dated to the mid-ninth century CE, are the earliest copper plate grants in the Telugu language.

During this period, Telugu was heavily influenced by Sanskrit and Prakrit, corresponding to the advent of Telugu literature. Initially, Telugu literature appeared in inscriptions and poetry in the courts of rulers, and later in written works, such as Nannayya&#x27;s &quot;Andhra Mahabharatam&quot; (1022 CE).

=== Middle Ages ===
The third phase is marked by further stylisation and sophistication of the literary languages. During this period the split of the Telugu from the Telugu-Kannada alphabet took place.

=== Vijayanagara Empire ===
The Vijayanagara Empire gained dominance from 1336 to the late 17th century, reaching its peak during the rule of Krishnadevaraya in the 16th century, when Telugu literature experienced what is considered its Golden Age. The 15th-century Venetian explorer Niccolò de&#x27; Conti, who visited the Vijayanagara Empire, found that the words in the Telugu language end with vowels, just like those in Italian, and hence referred to it as &quot;The Italian of the East&quot;; a saying that has been widely repeated.

=== Delhi Sultanate, Qutb Shahi, and Nizam era ===
A distinct dialect developed in present-day Hyderabad region, due to Persian and Arabic influence. This influence began with the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate rule by the Tughlaq dynasty in the northern Deccan Plateau during the 14th century.

In the latter half of the 17th century, the Mughal Empire extended further south, culminating in the establishment of the Hyderabad State by the dynasty of the Nizam of Hyderabad in 1724. This heralded an era of Persian influence on the Telugu language, especially Hyderabad State. The effect is also evident in the prose of the early 19th century, as in the &quot;kaifiyats&quot;.

=== Colonial period ===
In the late 19th and the early 20th centuries, the influence of the English language was seen, and modern communication/printing press arose as an effect of British rule, especially in the areas that were part of the Madras Presidency. Literature from this time had a mix of classical and modern traditions and included works by such scholars as Gidugu Venkata Ramamoorty, Kandukuri Veeresalingam, Gurajada Apparao, Gidugu Sitapati and Panuganti Lakshminarasimha Rao.

In the princely Hyderabad State, the Andhra Mahasabha was started in 1921 with the main goal of promoting Telugu language, literature, its books and historical research. Key figures in this movement included Madapati Hanumantha Rao (founder of the Andhra Mahasabha), Komarraju Venkata Lakshmana Rao (founder of the Library Movement in Hyderabad State), and Suravaram Pratapa Reddy.

Since the 1930s, what was considered an &quot;elite&quot; literary form of the Telugu language has now spread to the common people with the introduction of mass media like movies, television, radio and newspapers. This form of the language is also taught in schools and colleges as a standard.

=== Post-independence period ===
Telugu is one of the 22 languages with official status in India. The Andhra Pradesh Official Language Act, 1966, declares Telugu the official language of the state that is currently divided into Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It also has official language status in the Yanam district of the union territory of Puducherry. It is the fourth most spoken Indian language in India after Hindi, Bengali and Marathi. It is one of the six classical languages of India.

Telugu Language Day is celebrated every year on 29 August, the birthday of Telugu poet Gidugu Venkata Ramamurthy. The fourth World Telugu Conference was organised in Tirupati in the last week of December 2012. Issues related to Telugu language policy were deliberated at length. The American Community Survey has said that data for 2016 which were released in September 2017 showed Telugu is the third most widely spoken Indian language in the US. Hindi tops the list followed by Gujarati, as of the 2010 census.

In the Indian subcontinent, a command over the Telugu language, alongside Sanskrit, Tamil, Meitei, Oriya, Persian, or Arabic, is highly appreciated and respected for learning dances (most significantly Indian Classical Dances) as dancers could have the tools of these languages to go into the primary material texts.

== Geographic distribution ==
Telugu is natively spoken in the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and Yanam district of Puducherry. Telugu speakers are also found in the neighbouring states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, some parts of Jharkhand, and the Kharagpur region of West Bengal in India. Many Telugu immigrants are also found in the states of Gujarat, Goa, Bihar, Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, and Rajasthan. 7.2% of the population, Telugu is the fourth-most-spoken native language in India after Hindi, Bengali, and Marathi. In Karnataka, 7.0% of the population speak Telugu, and 5.6% in Tamil Nadu.

There are more than 400,000 Telugu Americans in the United States. , Telugu is the fastest-growing language in the United States, (especially in New Jersey and New York City), with the number of Telugu speakers in the United States increasing by 86% between 2010 and 2017. , it is the 18th most spoken native language in the United States and the third most spoken South Asian language after Hindi and Urdu. Minority Telugus are also found in Australia, New Zealand, Bahrain, Canada, Fiji, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Singapore, Mauritius, Myanmar, Europe (Italy, the United Kingdom), South Africa, Trinidad and Tobago, and the United Arab Emirates.

== Legal status ==
Telugu is the official language of the Indian states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. It is one of the 22 languages under schedule 8 of the constitution of India. It is one of the official languages of the union territories of Puducherry. Telugu is a protected language in South Africa. According to the Constitution of South Africa, the Pan South African Language Board must promote and ensure respect for Telugu along with other languages. The Government of South Africa announced that Telugu will be re-included as an official subject in the South African schools after it was removed from the curriculum in state schools.

In addition, with the creation in October 2004 of a legal status for classical languages by the Government of India on 8 August 2008, Telugu was also given classical language status due to several campaigns.

== Epigraphical records ==
According to the famous Japanese historian Noboru Karashima who served as the president of the Epigraphical Society of India in 1985, there are approximately 10,000 inscriptions which exist in the Telugu language as of the year 1996 making it one of the most densely inscribed languages. Telugu inscriptions are found in all the districts of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. They are also found in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, and Chhattisgarh. According to recent estimates by ASI (Archaeological Survey of India) the number of inscriptions in the Telugu language goes up to 14,000. Adilabad, Medak, Karimnagar, Nizamabad, Ranga Reddy, Hyderabad, Mahbubnagar, Anantapur, Chittoor and Srikakulam produced only a handful of Telugu inscriptions in the Kakatiya era between 1135 CE and 1324 CE.

== Geographical influence ==

=== Telugu region boundaries ===
Andhra is characterised as having its own mother tongue, and its territory has been equated with the extent of the Telugu language. The equivalence between the Telugu linguistic sphere and the geographical boundaries of Andhra is also brought out in an eleventh-century description of Andhra boundaries. Andhra, according to this text, was bounded in north by Mahendra mountain in the modern Ganjam district in Odisha and to the south by Srikalahasteeswara temple in Tirupati district. However, Andhra extended westwards as far as Srisailam in Nandyal district, about halfway across the modern state. According to other sources in the early sixteenth century, the northern boundary is Simhachalam and the southern limit is Tirumala of the Telugu ation.

=== Telugu Place Names ===

Telugu place names are present all around Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. Common suffixes are -&quot;ooru, -pudi, -padu, -peta, -pattanam, -wada,&quot; -&quot;gallu, -cherla, -seema, -gudem, -palle, -palem, -konda, -veedu, -valasa, -pakam, -paka, -prolu, -wolu, -waka, -ili, -kunta, -parru, -villi, -gadda, -kallu, -eru, -varam,-puram,-pedu&quot; and -&quot;palli&quot;. Examples that use this nomenclature are Nellore, Tadepalligudem, Guntur, Chintalapudi, Yerpedu, Narasaraopeta, Sattenapalle, Visakapatnam, Vizianagaram, Ananthagiri, Vijayawada, Vuyyuru, Macherla, Poranki, Ramagundam, Warangal, Mancherial, Peddapalli, Siddipet, Pithapuram, Banswada, and Miryalaguda.

== Dialects ==
There are four regional dialects in Telugu:

* Western : Telangana
* Southern: Rayalaseema
* Central: Coastal Andhra
* Northern : North Andhra

Colloquially, Telangana, Rayalaseema and Coastal Andhra dialects are considered the three Telugu dialects and regions.

Waddar, Chenchu, and Manna-Dora are all closely related to Telugu. Other dialects of Telugu are Berad, Dasari, Dommara, Golari, Kamathi, Komtao, Konda-Reddi, Salewari, Vadaga, Srikakula, Visakhapatnam, East Godavari, Rayalaseema, Nellore, Guntur, Vadari Bangalore, and Yanadi.

== Phonology ==

The Roman transliteration used for transcribing the Telugu script is the National Library at Kolkata romanisation.

Telugu words generally end in vowels. In Old Telugu, this was absolute; in the modern language &quot;m, n, y, w&quot; may end a word. Sanskrit loans have introduced aspirated and murmured consonants as well.

Telugu does not have contrastive stress, and speakers vary on where they perceive stress. Most place it on the penultimate or final syllable, depending on word and vowel length.

=== Consonants ===
The table below lists the consonant phonemes of Telugu, along with the symbols used in the transliteration of the Telugu script used here (where different from IPA).

* The aspirated and breathy-voiced consonants occur mostly in Sanskrit and Prakrit loanwords, additionally /tʰ/ is used to substitute /θ/ in English loans, the only aspirate which occurs natively is /dʱ/ which occurs only in a few compound numbers e.g. /pɐddʱenimidi/ &quot;18&quot; likely a result of the proto Dravidian laryngeal */H/ there is also an unaspirated /pɐddenimidi/ version which is used more commonly. All of the fricatives except for native also only occurs in loanwords.
* Perso-Arabic phonemes like /q, x, ɣ, z/ are substituted with /k, kʰ, ɡ, d͡ʒ/ similar to Hindi.
* /t͡s, d͡z/ occur only in native words and lack aspirated/breathy forms. Native words with /t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ/ before non front vowels became /t͡s, d͡z/; this change became phonemised after loaning words with /t͡ʃ, d͡ʒ/ from other languages. Intervocalically /d͡z/ can become [z] e.g. [rɐːzu, d͡zoːli, ɡudd͡zu].
* /ʋ/ can be rounded to a [β̞ʷ] around rounded vowels.
* The common Proto Dravidian approximant */ɻ/ merged with /ɖ/ in Telugu while it was preserved as /ɽ/ in the other Southern II branch languages.
* Many of the old /ɳ/ and /ɭ/ merged with /n/ and /l/. 

Most consonants contrast in length in word-medial position, meaning that there are long (geminated) and short phonetic renderings of the sounds. A few examples of words that contrast by length of word-medial consonants:

* /ɡɐdi/ &quot;gadi&quot; (room) – /ɡɐdːi/ &quot;gaddi&quot; (grass)
* /ɐʈu/ &quot;aṭu&quot; (that side) – /ɐʈːu/ &quot;aṭṭu&quot; (pancake)
* /moɡɐ/ &quot;moga&quot; (male) – /moɡːɐ/ &quot;mogga&quot; (bud) 
* /nɐmɐkɐmu/ &quot;namakamu&quot; (a vedic hymn) – /nɐmːɐkɐmu/ &quot;nammakamu&quot; (belief)
* /kɐnu/ &quot;kanu&quot; (to give birth to) – /kɐnːu/ &quot;kannu&quot; (eye)
* /kɐlɐ/ &quot;kala&quot; (dream) – /kɐlːɐ/ &quot;kalla&quot; (falsehood) 
* /mɐɾi/ &quot;mari&quot; (again) – /mɐɾːi/ &quot;marri&quot; (banyan tree)

All retroflex consonants occur in intervocalic position and when adjacent to a retroflex consonant, for instance. /ʋɐːɳiː/ &quot;vāṇī&quot; &#x27;tippet&#x27;, /kɐʈɳɐm/ &quot;kaṭṇam&quot; &#x27;dowry&#x27;, /pɐɳɖu/ &quot;paṇḍu&quot; &#x27;fruit&#x27;; /kɐɭɐ/ &quot;kaḷa&quot; &#x27;art&#x27;. With the exception of /ɳ/ and /ɭ/, all occur word-initial in a few words, such as /ʈɐkːu/ &quot;ṭakku&quot; &#x27;pretence&#x27;, /ʈhiːʋi/ &quot;ṭhīvi&quot; &#x27;grandeur&#x27;, /ɖipːɐ/ &quot;ḍippā&quot; &#x27;half of a spherical object&#x27;, and /ʂoːku/ &quot;ṣōku&quot; &#x27;fashionable appearance&#x27;.

The approximant /j/ occurs in word-initial position only in borrowed words, such as. /jɐnɡu/ &quot;yangu&quot;, from English &#x27;young&#x27;, /jɐʃɐsːu/ &quot;yaśassu&quot; from Sanskrit &quot;yaśas&quot; /jɐʃɐs/ &#x27;fame&#x27;.

=== Vowels ===
Vowels in Telugu contrast in length; there are short and long versions of all vowels except for /æ/, which only occurs as long. Long vowels can occur in any position within the word, but native Telugu words do not end in a long vowel. Short vowels occur in all positions of a word, with the exception of /o/, which does not occur word-finally. The vowels of Telugu are illustrated below, along with the Telugu script and romanisation.

* An emphatic u maybe added to loans ending with a consonant, eg. school &gt; iskūlu.

==== Allophones ====
In most dialects, the vowel only occurs in loan words. In the Guntur dialect, is a frequent allophone of in certain verbs in the past tense.

Telugu has two diphthongs: () and ().

Roots alter according to whether the first vowel is tense or lax. Also, if the second vowel is open (i.e., or ), then the first vowel is more open and centralised (e.g., &#x27;goat&#x27;, as opposed to &#x27;nail&#x27;). Telugu words also have vowels in inflectional suffixes that are harmonised with the vowels of the preceding syllable.

===Colloquial speech===

* In some colloquial speech ṇ, ḷ might completely merge with n, l except in clusters with retroflex plosives.

*Telanganan dialects merge ś to ṣ while other dialects merge ś with s, eg. iṣṭam, dēśam &gt; istaw̃, dēsaw̃/dēṣaw̃.

* Non initial and particularly final m tends to be [w̃].

* Initial kṣ tend to be kś before front vowels and kṣ/ṭṣ before other in educated speech, ch for uneducated speech; medially tts(h) for all.

* Cluster simplification, eg. viplavam, amlam, raktam, anyāyam &gt; yipalavaw̃, āw̃alaw̃, rattaw̃, annēyaw̃.

* va, vā becomes (w)o, {ā, ō} initially, eg. vāḍu &gt; āḍu/ōḍu. Before front vowels the v becomes y, eg. vennela &gt; yennela.

* Some aspirates might be debuccalized to a h while previous actual h&#x27;s might be deleted, eg. mukham, mahā &gt; muhaw̃/mugaw̃, mā.

*Telanganan speech tend to have less aspirated consonants.

* Palatalization, eg. madhyāhnam &gt; majjhānaw̃/majjhēnaw̃.

* ph, ts, dz &gt; f, s, j.

* Differences in suffixing, eg. kannu-lu &gt; Coastal kaḷḷu, Rayalseema kaṇḍḷu/kaṇḷu, Telangana kanlu.

* Sri Lankan Telugu too lacks ṇ, ḷ, merges c with s and has vowel alternations like i instead of final -u, perhaps due to Tamil and Sinhalese influence.

== Grammar ==
The traditional study of Telugu Grammar is known as &quot;vyākaraṇam&quot; (వ్యాకరణం). The first treatise on Telugu grammar, the &quot;Āndhra Śabda Cintāmaṇi&quot;, was written in Sanskrit by Nannayya, considered the first Telugu poet and translator, in the 12th century CE. This grammar followed patterns described in grammatical treatises such as &quot;Aṣṭādhyāyī&quot; and &quot;Vālmīkivyākaranam&quot;, but unlike Pāṇini, Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering &quot;samjnā&quot;, &quot;sandhi&quot;, &quot;ajanta&quot;, &quot;halanta&quot; and &quot;kriya&quot;.

In the 19th century, Chinnaya Suri wrote a condensed work on Telugu grammar called &quot;Bāla Vyākaraṇam&quot;, borrowing concepts and ideas from Nannayya&#x27;s grammar.

=== Morphosyntax ===
Relations between participants in an event are coded in Telugu words through suffixation; there are no prefixes or infixes in the language. There are six word classes in Telugu: nominals (proper nouns, pronouns), verbs (actions or events), modifiers (adjectives, quantifiers, numerals), adverbs (modify the way in which actions or events unfold), and clitics.

Telugu nouns are inflected for number (singular, plural), noun class (three classes traditionally termed &quot;masculine, feminine&quot;, and &quot;neuter&quot;) and case (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, vocative, instrumental, and locative).

==== Word order ====
The basic word order in Telugu is subject-object-verb (SOV).

==== Noun classes (gender) ====
As with other Dravidian languages, gender in Telugu follows a semantic system, in the sense that it is mostly the meaning of the word which defines the noun class to which it belongs. There are three noun classes: masculine (human males, &quot;he-&quot;gender), feminine (human females, &quot;she&quot;-gender), and neuter (all non-humans, &quot;it-gender&quot;). The gender of most nouns is encoded through agreement/indexation in pronominal suffixes rather than overtly on the noun.

In terms of the verbal agreement system, genders in marking on the Telugu verb only occur in the third person.

The Telugu gender system differs from other Dravidian languages such as Tamil in that the Telugu feminine shares indexation morphemes with the masculine plural (&quot;-ru&quot;) and with the neuter singular (&quot;-di&quot;). What characterises the three-gender system is then the individual behaviour of the singular-plural &quot;pairs&quot; of suffixes.

=== Pronouns ===
Telugu pronouns include personal pronouns (the persons speaking, the persons spoken to, or the persons or things spoken about); indefinite pronouns; relative pronouns (connecting parts of sentences); and reciprocal or reflexive pronouns (in which the object of a verb is acted on by the verb&#x27;s subject).

==== Personal pronouns ====

In informal Telugu, personal pronouns distinguish masculine from non-masculine.

==== Demonstratives ====
There is a wide variety of demonstrative pronouns in Telugu, whose forms depend on both proximity to the speaker and the level of formality. The formal demonstratives may also be used as formal personal pronoun, that is, the polite forms for &quot;this woman&quot; or &quot;this man&quot; and &quot;that woman&quot; or &quot;that man&quot; can also simply mean &quot;she&quot; and &quot;he&quot; in more formal contexts&quot;.&quot;

In the singular, there are four levels of formality when speaking about males and females, although the most formal/polite form is the same for both human genders. In both singular and plural, Telugu distinguishes two levels of distance from speaker (like in English), basically &quot;this and that&quot;, and &quot;these and those&quot;.

In the plural, there are no distinctions between formality levels, but once again masculine and feminine forms are the same, while the neuter demonstratives are different.
=== Case system ===
The nominative case (&quot;karta&quot;), the object of a verb (&quot;karma&quot;), and the verb are somewhat in a sequence in Telugu sentence construction. &quot;&quot;Vibhakti&quot; (case of a noun) and &quot;pratyāyamulu&quot; (an affix to roots and words forming derivatives and inflections) depict the ancient nature and progression of the language. The &quot;Vibhaktis&quot;&quot; of Telugu language &quot; డు [ɖu], ము [mu], వు [vu], లు [lu]&quot;, etc., are different from those in Sanskrit and have been in use for a long time.

== Lexicon ==

Majority of the lexicon in Telugu is inherited from Proto-Dravidian language, a reconstructed hypothetical language of third millennium BCE. Telugu retained some of the most archaic words, markers and morphemes of the Dravidian origin. It shares its cognates with its closest South-Dravidian-II languages like Gondi, Kuwi and also with other Dravidian languages such as Tamil and Kannada.

The lexicon of Classical Telugu works shows a pervasive influence of Sanskrit; there is also evidence suggesting an earlier influence even before Nannaya. During the period 1000–1100 CE, Nannaya&#x27;s re-writing of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot; in Telugu (మహాభారతము) established the liberal borrowing of Sanskrit words.

Literature in &quot;acca telugu&quot; or &quot;jānu telugu (జానుతెలుగు)&quot; by poets like Adibhatla Narayana Dasu and Ponneganti Telaganna emphasised the importance of native lexicon of Dravidian origin, in contrast to the extensive borrowings from Sanskrit and Prakrit. Spoken Telugu preserved most of its Dravidian lexicon intact in various colloquial dialects.

The vocabulary of Telugu, especially in the city of Hyderabad, has borrowings from Persian and Arabic (through Urdu and directly) languages. These words have been modified to fit Telugu phonology. This was due to Turkic rule in these regions, such as the erstwhile kingdoms of Golkonda and Hyderabad (e.g., కబురు, for Urdu , or జవాబు, for Urdu , ).

Many words were borrowed from English language in the modern era and a few from Portuguese during the colonial era. Modern Telugu vocabulary can be said to constitute a diglossia because the formal, standardised version of the language is either lexically Sanskrit or heavily influenced by Sanskrit, as taught in schools, and used by the government and Hindu religious institutions. However, colloquial Telugu is less influenced by Sanskrit and varies depending upon region.

===Prakruti and Vikruti===
Telugu has many Tatsama words. They are called Prakruti, which are equivalent to Sanskrit words. The equivalent colloquial or Tadbhava words are called Vikruti, which means distorted. However, Prakruti is only used as a medium of instruction in educational institutions, offices etc.

== Writing system ==
Telugu script is an abugida comprising 60 symbols – 16 vowels, 3 vowel modifiers, and 41 consonants. Telugu has a complete set of letters that follow a system to express sounds. The script is derived from the Brahmi script like those of many other Indian languages. Telugu script is written from left to right and comprises sequences of both simple and complex characters. It is syllabic in nature – the basic units of writing are syllables. Inasmuch as the number of possible syllables is very large, syllables are composed of more basic units such as vowels (&quot;&quot;acchu&quot; or &quot;swaram&quot;) and consonants (&quot;hallu&quot; or &quot;vyanjanam&quot;&quot;). Consonants in consonant clusters take shapes that are very different from the shapes they take elsewhere. Consonants are presumed pure consonants, that is, without any vowel sound in them. However, it is traditional to write and read consonants with an implied &quot;a&quot; vowel sound. When consonants combine with other vowel signs, the vowel part is indicated orthographically using signs known as vowel &quot;&quot;mātras&quot;. The shapes of vowel &quot;mātras&quot; are also very different from the shapes of the corresponding vowels.

Historically, a sentence used to end with either a single bar। (&quot;pūrna virāmam&quot;) or a double bar॥ (&quot;dīrgha virāmam&quot;&quot;); in handwriting, Telugu words were not separated by spaces. However, in modern times, English punctuation (commas, semicolon, etc.) has virtually replaced the old method of punctuation.

Telugu has full-zero (&quot;anusvāra&quot; or &quot;sunna&quot; ) ( ం ), half-zero (&quot;arthanusvāra&quot; or &quot;candrabindu&quot; or &quot;ara-sunna&quot; ) (ఁ) and &quot;visarga&quot; ( ః ) to convey various shades of nasal sounds. [la] and [La], [ra] and [Ra] are differentiated.

Telugu has &quot;ĉ&quot; [t͡s] and &quot;ĵ&quot; [d͡z], which are not represented in Sanskrit.
=== () ===
These are some examples of combining a consonant with different vowels.

=== Number system ===
Telugu has ten digits employed with the Hindu–Arabic numeral system. However, in modern usage, the Arabic numerals have replaced them.

Telugu is assigned Unicode codepoints: 0C00-0C7F (3072–3199).

== Literature ==
=== Ancient Telugu Writings Period (300 BC 500 CE) ===
==== Amaravati Stupa ====
Amarāvati Stupa is a ruined Buddhist stūpa at the village of Amaravathi, Palnadu district, Andhra Pradesh, India, probably built in phases between the third century BCE and about 250 CE. The word &quot;nagabu&quot; was one of the first Telugu words that was written on the Amaravati Stupa.
=== Early Medieval Telugu Writings Period (500 850 CE) ===
These writings were mostly written by the Vishnukudinas, Telugu Chodas, and the Chalukyas.

==== Kallamalla Writing (575 CE) ====
This is the first writing entirely written in Telugu. It was written by Renati Choda king Dhanunjaya. in 575 CE. It was found on the premises of Chennakesava-Siddeshwara temple at Kalamalla village in Yerraguntla Mandal of the district.

==== Indravarma Sasanam ====
This was a writing written by Indra Varma in the 6th century. Indra Varma was a Vishnukudina king in the 6th century.
==== Janashrayi-Chhandovichiti ====
The 6th- or 7th-century Sanskrit text &quot;Janashrayi-Chhandovichiti&quot; (or &quot;Janāśraya-chandas&quot;) deals with the metres used in Telugu, including some metres that are not found in Sanskrit prosody. This indicates that Telugu poetry existed during or around the 6th century.

==== Vipparla and Lakshmipuram Writings ====
Vipparla Inscription of Jayasimha I and the Lakshmipuram inscription of the Mangi yuvaraja were the earliest Telugu inscriptions of Eastern chalukyas found in the 7th century AD.
==== Addanki Poem ====
Addanki inscription also known as the Pandaranga inscription belongs to 848AD, excavated near the Thousand Pillar Temple of Addanki. It is testimony to a flourishing Telugu literature much before the available literary texts. Locals believe that this is the first poem ever to be written in Telugu, also called the first Padya Sasanam(Poetic inscription) with (dvipada, with Yati and Prasa; style taruvoja)Staying with the Boya campaign, Pandaranga got victories in all military campaigns of his master Gunaga Vijayaditya III. The inscription spoke about the donation of land by the king to him for his successful military exploits.

=== Telugu Jain Literature Period (850-1020 CE) ===
==== Malliya Rechana ====
Malliya Rechana composed the first Telugu poetic prosody book Kavijanasrayam (pre-Nannayya chandassu). This was a popular one and referred by many poets. There seems to be even an earlier prosody book by Rechana&#x27;s guru Vaadindra Chudamani which is not available.

Veturi Prabhakara Sastry in 1900s mentioned the existence of &quot;Pre-Nannayya Chandassu&quot; in Raja Raja Narendra Pattabhisheka Sanchika. Accurate dating of this piece of literature happened after the 1980s discoveries in Karimnagar. Rechana&#x27;s work is variously dated from 940 CE to 12th and 13th century. Most scholars date him to post-Nannaya period.

==== Adikavi Pampa ====
Adikavi Pampa had written a Telugu work named Jinendra Puranam, a Jain work written in 941 CE.

===The Pre-Nannaya Period (before 1020 CE)===

In the earliest period Telugu literature existed in the form of inscriptions, precisely from 575 CE onward. Metrically composed Telugu inscriptions and those with ornamental or literary prose appear from 630 CE. Most scholars posit that Telugu literature existed prior to Nannaya (11th century), the first known Telugu poet. T. Vijay Kumar notes, &quot;Since no literary texts in Telugu pre-dating 1020 C.E. have so far actually been discovered, the existence of any pre-Nannaya literature remains a matter of speculation and debate.&quot;

===The Age of the Puranas (1020–1400 CE)===

This is the period of Kavitrayam or Trinity of Poets. Nannayya, Tikkana, and Yerrapragada (or Errana) are known as the Kavitrayam.

Nannaya&#x27;s (Telugu: నన్నయ) &quot;Andhra Mahabharatam&quot; written in early 11th century is commonly referred to as the first Telugu literary composition (Aadi Kavyam). Although there is evidence of Telugu literature before Nannaya, he is given the epithet Aadi Kavi (&quot;the first poet&quot;). Nannaya Bhattu acknowledged the help extended to him by his friend Narayana Bhattu in his composition in fields like making choices of grammatical forms, metres, form of the book, etc. and compares it to that extended to Arjuna by God Sri Krishna in the Bharata war. Nannaya was the first to establish a formal grammar of written Telugu. This grammar followed the patterns which existed in grammatical treatises like Aṣṭādhyāyī and Vālmīkivyākaranam but unlike Pāṇini, Nannayya divided his work into five chapters, covering samjnā, sandhi, ajanta, halanta and kriya.[14] Nannaya completed the first two chapters and a part of the third chapter of the Mahabharata epic, which is rendered in the Champu style.

Tikkana Somayaji (1205–1288 CE): Nannaya&#x27;s &quot;Andhra Mahabharatam&quot; was almost completed by Tikanna Somayaji (Telugu: తిక్కన సోమయాజి) (1205–1288) who wrote chapters 4 to 18.

Yerrapragada: (Telugu: ఎర్రాప్రగడ) who lived in the 14th century, finished the epic by completing the third chapter. He mimics Nannaya&#x27;s style in the beginning, slowly changes tempo and finishes the chapter in the writing style of Tikkana. These three writers – Nannaya, Tikanna and Yerrapragada – are known as the Kavitraya (&quot;three great poets&quot;) of Telugu. Other such translations like Marana&#x27;s Markandeya Puranam, Ketana&#x27;s &quot;Dasakumara Charita&quot;, Yerrapragada&#x27;s Harivamsam followed. Many scientific works, like Ganitasarasangrahamu by Pavuluri Mallana and Prakirnaganitamu by Eluganti Peddana, were written in the 12th century.

Sumati Satakam, which is a neeti (&quot;moral&quot;), is one of the most famous Telugu Satakams. Satakam is composed of more than a 100 padyalu (poems). According to many literary critics Sumati Satakam was composed by Baddena Bhupaludu (Telugu: బద్దెన భూపాల) (CE 1220–1280). He was also known as Bhadra Bhupala. He was a Chola prince and a vassal under the Kakatiya empress Rani Rudrama Devi, and a pupil of Tikkana. If we assume that the Sumati Satakam was indeed written by Baddena, it would rank as one of the earliest Satakams in Telugu along with the Vrushadhipa Satakam of Palkuriki Somanatha and the Sarveswara Satakam of Yathavakkula Annamayya. The Sumatee Satakam is also one of the earliest Telugu works to be translated into a European language, as C. P. Brown rendered it in English in the 1840s.

Palkuriki Somanatha: Important among his Telugu language writings are the Basava Purana, Panditaradhya charitra, Malamadevipuranamu and Somanatha Stava–in dwipada metre (&quot;couplets&quot;); Anubhavasara, Chennamallu Sisamalu, Vrushadhipa Sataka and Cheturvedasara–in verses; Basavodharana in verses and ragale metre (rhymed couplets in blank verse); and the Basavaragada.

Gona Budda Reddy: His &quot;Ranganatha Ramayanam&quot; was a pioneering work in the Telugu language on the theme of the &quot;Ramayana&quot; epic. Most scholars believe he wrote it between 1300 and 1310 A.D., possibly with help from his family. The work has become part of cultural life in Andhra Pradesh and is used in puppet shows.

In the Telugu literature Tikkana was given agraasana (top position) by many famous critics.

Paravastu Chinnayya Soori (1807–1861) is a well-known Telugu writer who dedicated his entire life to the progress and promotion of Telugu language and literature. Sri Chinnayasoori wrote the &quot;Bala Vyakaranam&quot; in a new style after doing extensive research on Telugu grammar. Other well-known writings by Chinnayasoori are &quot;Neethichandrika&quot;, &quot;Sootandhra Vyaakaranamu&quot;, &quot;Andhra Dhatumoola&quot;, and &quot;Neeti Sangrahamu&quot;.

Kandukuri Veeresalingam (1848–1919) is generally considered the father of modern Telugu literature. His novel &quot;Rajasekhara Charitamu&quot; was inspired by the Vicar of Wakefield. His work marked the beginning of a dynamic of socially conscious Telugu literature and its transition to the modern period, which is also part of the wider literary renaissance that took place in Indian culture during this period. Other prominent literary figures from this period are Gurajada Appa Rao, Viswanatha Satyanarayana, Gurram Jashuva, Rayaprolu Subba Rao, Devulapalli Krishnasastri and Srirangam Srinivasa Rao, popularly known as &quot;Mahakavi&quot; Sri Sri. Sri Sri was instrumental in popularising free verse in spoken Telugu (&quot;vaaduka bhasha&quot;), as opposed to the pure form of written Telugu used by several poets in his time. Devulapalli Krishnasastri is often referred to as the Shelley of Telugu literature because of his pioneering works in Telugu Romantic poetry.

Viswanatha Satyanarayana won India&#x27;s national literary honour, the Jnanpith Award for his magnum opus &quot;Ramayana Kalpavrukshamu&quot;. C. Narayana Reddy won the Jnanpith Award in 1988 for his poetic work, &quot;Viswambara&quot;. Ravuri Bharadhwaja won the third Jnanpith Award for Telugu literature in 2013 for &quot;Paakudu Raallu&quot;, a graphic account of life behind the screen in film industry. &quot;Kanyasulkam&quot;, the first social play in Telugu by Gurajada Appa Rao, was followed by the progressive movement, the free verse movement and the Digambara style of Telugu verse. Other modern Telugu novelists include Unnava Lakshminarayana (&quot;Maalapalli&quot;), Bulusu Venkateswarulu (&quot;Bharatiya Tatva Sastram&quot;), Kodavatiganti Kutumba Rao and Buchi Babu.

<text>The Battle of Bennington was a battle of the American Revolutionary War, part of the Saratoga campaign, that took place on August 16, 1777, on a farm in Walloomsac, New York, about from its namesake, Bennington, Vermont. An American force of 2,000 men, primarily New Hampshire and Massachusetts militiamen, led by General John Stark, and reinforced by Vermont militiamen led by Colonel Seth Warner and members of the Green Mountain Boys, decisively defeated a detachment of General John Burgoyne&#x27;s army led by Lieutenant-Colonel Friedrich Baum, and supported by additional troops under Lieutenant-Colonel Heinrich von Breymann.

Baum&#x27;s detachment of 700 men consisted of Hessian and British Army troops, Canadian and Loyalist irregulars and a number of Iroquois warriors. He was sent by Burgoyne to raid Bennington in the disputed New Hampshire Grants area for horses, draft animals, provisions, and other supplies. Believing the town to be only lightly defended, Burgoyne and Baum were unaware that Stark and 1,500 American militiamen were stationed there. After a rain-caused standoff, Stark&#x27;s men enveloped Baum&#x27;s position, taking many prisoners, and killing Baum. Reinforcements for both sides arrived as Stark and his men were mopping up, and the battle restarted, with Warner and Stark driving away Breymann&#x27;s reinforcements with heavy casualties.

The battle was a major strategic success for the American cause and is considered one of the turning points of the war; it reduced Burgoyne&#x27;s army in size by almost 1,000 men, led his Native American allies to largely abandon him, and deprived him of much-needed supplies, such as mounts for his cavalry regiments, draft animals and provisions, all factors that contributed to Burgoyne&#x27;s eventual defeat at Saratoga. The victory galvanized colonial support for the Patriot cause, and played a key role in bringing France into the war on the American side. The battle&#x27;s anniversary is celebrated in the state of Vermont as Bennington Battle Day.

==Background==
With the American Revolutionary War two years old, the British changed their plans. Giving up on the rebellious New England Colonies, they decided to split the Thirteen Colonies and isolate New England from what the British believed to be the more loyal Southern Colonies. The British command devised a grand plan to divide the colonies via a three-way pincer movement towards Albany. The western pincer, proceeding eastward from Lake Ontario under the command of Barry St. Leger, was repulsed when the Siege of Fort Stanwix failed, and the southern pincer, which was to progress up the Hudson valley from New York City, never started since General William Howe decided instead to capture Philadelphia.

The northern pincer, proceeding southward from Montreal, enjoyed the most success. After British victories at Fort Ticonderoga, Hubbardton, and Fort Anne, General John Burgoyne proceeded with the Saratoga campaign, with the goal of capturing Albany, New York and gaining control of the Hudson River valley, where Burgoyne&#x27;s force could (as the plan went) meet the other pincers, dividing the colonies in two.

===British forces===

Burgoyne&#x27;s progress towards Albany had initially met with some success, including the scattering of Seth Warner&#x27;s men in the Battle of Hubbardton. However, his advance had slowed to a crawl by late July, due to logistical difficulties, exacerbated by the American destruction of a key road, and the army&#x27;s supplies began to dwindle. Burgoyne&#x27;s concern over supplies was magnified in early August when he received word that Howe was going to Philadelphia, rather than advance up the Hudson River valley. In response to a proposal first made on July 22 by the commander of his Hessian troops, Baron Riedesel, Burgoyne sent a detachment of about 800 soldiers under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Friedrich Baum from Fort Miller on a foraging mission to acquire horses for Prince Ludwig&#x27;s Dragoon Regiment, draft animals to assist in moving the army, and to harass the Americans. Baum&#x27;s detachment was primarily made up of dismounted dragoons from Prince Ludwig&#x27;s Dragoon Regiment. Along the way, 150 local Loyalists, 58 Canadian irregulars, around 100 Iroquois warriors, and 48 soldiers from the British Army&#x27;s Company of Select Marksmen joined the detachment. Baum was originally ordered to proceed to the Connecticut River valley where they believed horses could be procured for the dragoons. However, as Baum was preparing to leave, Burgoyne changed the goal to be a supply depot at Bennington, having received intelligence reports that the town was defended only by 400 demoralized militia from Warner&#x27;s command.

===American forces===
Unknown to Burgoyne, the citizens of the New Hampshire Grants territory (now Vermont, which was then disputed between New York and the Vermont Republic) had appealed to the states of New Hampshire and Massachusetts for protection from the invading army following the British capture of Ticonderoga. New Hampshire responded on July 18 by authorizing John Stark to raise a militia for the defense of the people &quot;or the annoyance of the enemy&quot;. Using funds provided by John Langdon, Stark raised 1,500 New Hampshire militiamen in the space of six days, more than 10% of New Hampshire&#x27;s male population over the age of sixteen. They were first marched to the Fort at Number 4 (modern-day Charlestown, New Hampshire), then crossed the Connecticut river border into the Grants and stopped at Manchester, where Stark conferred with Warner. While in Manchester, General Benjamin Lincoln, whose promotion in preference to Stark had been the cause for Stark&#x27;s resignation from the Continental Army, attempted to assert Army authority over Stark and his men. Stark refused, stating that he was solely responsible to the New Hampshire authorities. Stark then went on to Bennington with Warner as a guide, while Warner&#x27;s men remained in Manchester. Lincoln returned to the American camp at Stillwater, where he and General Philip Schuyler hatched a plan for Lincoln, with 500 men, to join with Stark and Warner in actions to harass Burgoyne&#x27;s communications and supply lines at Skenesboro. Baum&#x27;s movements significantly altered these plans.

==Prelude==

Baum&#x27;s troops left Burgoyne&#x27;s camp at Fort Edward on August 9 and marched to Fort Miller, where they waited until they were joined by the Iroquois and the Company of Select Marksmen. The company marched off toward Bennington on August 11. In minor skirmishes along the way they learned from prisoners taken that a sizable force was in place at Bennington. On August 14 Baum&#x27;s men encountered a detachment of Stark&#x27;s men that had been sent out to investigate reports of British-allied Indians in the area. Stark&#x27;s men retreated, destroying a bridge to delay Baum&#x27;s advance. Stark, on receiving word of the approaching force, sent a request to Manchester for support, and then moved his troops out of Bennington toward Baum&#x27;s force, setting up a defensive line. Baum sent a message to Burgoyne following the first contact indicating that the American force was larger than expected, but that it was likely to retreat before him. He then advanced a few miles further until he neared Stark&#x27;s position. He then realized that at least part of his first message was incorrect, so he sent a second message to Burgoyne, requesting reinforcements.

It rained for the next day and a half, preventing battle. During this time, Baum&#x27;s men constructed a small redoubt at the crest of the hill and hoped that the weather would prevent the Americans from attacking before reinforcements arrived. Stark sent out skirmishers to probe the Hessians lines, who killed thirty British-allied Iroquois warriors in spite of the difficulties of keeping their gunpowder dry. Reinforcements for both sides marched out on the 15th; travel was quite difficult due to the heavy rains. Burgoyne sent 550 men under Heinrich von Breymann, while Warner&#x27;s company of about 350 Green Mountain Boys came south from Manchester under Lieutenant Samuel Safford&#x27;s command.

Late on the night of August 15, Stark was awakened by the arrival of Parson Thomas Allen and a band of Massachusetts militiamen from nearby Berkshire County who insisted on joining his force. In response to the minister&#x27;s fiery threat that his men would never come out again if they were not allowed to participate, Stark is reported to have said, &quot;Would you go now on this dark and rainy night? Go back to your people and tell them to get some rest if they can, and if the Lord gives us sunshine to-morrow and I do not give you fighting enough, I will never call on you to come again.&quot; Stark&#x27;s forces again swelled the next day with the arrival of some Stockbridge Indians, bringing his force (excluding Warner&#x27;s men) to nearly 2,000 men.

Stark was not the only beneficiary of unexpected reinforcements; Baum&#x27;s force grew by almost 100 when a group of local Loyalists arrived in his camp on the morning of August 16.

==Battle==
On the afternoon of August 16, the weather cleared, and Stark ordered his men to be ready to attack. Stark is reputed to have rallied his troops by saying they were here to fight for their &quot;natural born rights as Englishmen&quot; and he added &quot;There are your enemies, the Red Coats and the Tories. They are ours, or this night Molly Stark sleeps a widow.&quot; Upon hearing that the militia had melted away into the woods, Baum assumed that the Americans were retreating or redeploying. However, Stark had decided to capitalize on weaknesses in the widely distributed position of the Hessians, and had sent sizable flanking parties to either side of his lines. These movements were assisted by a ruse employed by Stark&#x27;s men that enabled them to get closer safely without alarming the opposing forces. The Hessians, most of whom spoke no English, had been told that soldiers with bits of white paper in their hats were Loyalists, and should not be fired on; Stark&#x27;s men had also heard this and many of them had adorned their hats with white paper.

When the fighting broke out around 3:00 PM the Hessian position was immediately surrounded by gunfire, which Stark described as &quot;the hottest engagement I have ever witnessed, resembling a continual clap of thunder.&quot; The Loyalist and Iroquois positions were quickly overrun, causing many of them to flee or surrender. This left Baum and his dragoons trapped alone on the high ground. The Hessians fought valiantly, even after their ammunition wagon was destroyed. As their powder ran low, they resorted to hand-to-hand combat. In desperation, Baum ordered the dragoons to remount their horses and charge the Americans hoping to break through and escape. The Americans held fast and fired on the charging Hessians, killing many and shattering their morale. The remaining Hessians surrendered, while Baum soon died from a mortal wound.

After the battle ended, while Stark&#x27;s militiamen were busy disarming the prisoners and looting their supplies, Breymann arrived with his reinforcements. Seeing the Americans in disarray, they immediately pressed their attack. After hastily regrouping, Stark&#x27;s forces tried to hold their ground against the new Hessian onslaught but began to fall back. Before their lines collapsed, Warner&#x27;s men arrived on the scene to reinforce Stark&#x27;s troops. Pitched battle continued until dark, when both sides disengaged. Breymann began a hasty retreat; he had lost one quarter of his force and all of his artillery pieces.

==Aftermath==
Total Hessian, Loyalist and Iroquois losses at Bennington were recorded at 207 dead and 700 captured; American losses included 30 Americans dead and 40 wounded. The battle was at times particularly brutal when Loyalists met Patriots, as in some cases they came from the same communities. The prisoners, who were first kept in Bennington, were eventually marched to Boston.

Burgoyne&#x27;s army was readying to cross the Hudson at Fort Edward on August 17 when the first word of the battle arrived. Believing that reinforcements might be necessary, Burgoyne marched the army toward Bennington until further word arrived that Breymann and the remnants of his force were returning. Stragglers continued to arrive throughout the day and night, while word of the disaster spread within the camp.

The effect on Burgoyne&#x27;s campaign was significant. Not only had he lost nearly 1,000 men, of which half were irreplaceable regular troops, but he soon lost his Indian allies as well. In a council following the battle, the tribesmen (who had traveled with him from Quebec) gave up on Burgoyne and deserted him. This loss severely hampered the general&#x27;s reconnaissance efforts in the days to come. The failure to bring in fresh supplies resulted in even greater strain on the already overextended British supply lines from Canada, which eventually broke in September. The shortage of supplies was a significant factor in Burgoyne&#x27;s decision to surrender at Saratoga, following which France entered the war.

American Patriots reacted to news of the battle with optimism. Especially after Burgoyne&#x27;s Indian screen left him, small groups of local Patriots began to emerge to harass the fringes of British positions. A significant portion of Stark&#x27;s force returned home and did not again become influential in the campaign until appearing at Saratoga on October 13 to complete the encirclement of Burgoyne&#x27;s army.

John Stark&#x27;s reward from the New Hampshire General Assembly for &quot;the Memorable Battle of Bennington&quot; was &quot;a compleat suit of Clothes becoming his Rank&quot;. A reward that Stark likely valued the highest was a message of thanks from John Hancock, president of the Continental Congress, which included a commission as &quot;brigadier in the army of the United States&quot;.

==Order of battle==
The battle forces are generally described as in Morrissey. His numbers are generally consistent with other sources on the British units, although there is disagreement across a wide array of sources on the number of troops under Breymann, which are generally listed at either approximately 550 or 650. Morrissey is also incorrect in identifying some of the American units. He identifies William Gregg as having a separate command; Gregg apparently led several companies in Nichols&#x27; regiment. Morrissey also failed to include the Massachusetts militia, and misidentified Langdon&#x27;s company, erroneously believing they may have been from Worcester, Massachusetts. (Militia companies from the Worcester area marched on Bennington, with some companies arriving the day after the battle.) Langdon originally raised his company in 1776, but it did not become a cavalry unit until 1778.

==Commemorations==
August 16 is a legal holiday in Vermont, known as Bennington Battle Day. The battlefield, now a New York state historic site, was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 20, 1961, and added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. In the 1870s, the local historic society in Bennington commissioned the design and construction of the Bennington Battle Monument, which was complete in 1889 and dedicated in 1891 with ceremonies attended by President Benjamin Harrison. The Monument, an obelisk high, is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Although the monument was not ready in time to mark the centennial of the battle, the 100th anniversary of the battle was marked by speeches attended by President Rutherford B. Hayes.

Every year on Bennington Battle Day there is a firing of the Molly Stark Cannon, the oldest firing cannon in the United States. The cannon was captured at the Battle of Bennington.

<text>The Asian Games, also known as Asiad, is a continental multi-sport event held every four years for athletes of Asia. The Games were regulated by Asian Games Federation from the first Games in New Delhi, India in 1951, until the 1978 Games. Since the 1982 Games, they have been organized by the Olympic Council of Asia, after the breakup of the Asian Games Federation. The Games are recognized by the International Olympic Committee and are the second largest multi-sport event after the Olympic Games.

Nine nations have hosted the Asian Games. Forty-six nations have participated in the Games, including Israel, which was excluded from the Games after its last participation in 1974. The last edition of the Games was held in Hangzhou, China, from 23 September to 8 October 2023.

Since 2010, it has been common for the host of the Asian Games to host the Asian Para Games held shortly after the end of the Games. This event is exclusive to athletes with disabilities, just like Paralympic Games. But unlike the Paralympics where the host city&#x27;s contract mentions the holding of both events, the case of Asia does not mention the mandatory holding of both. Instead, the exclusion of the Asian Para Games from the Asian Games host city&#x27;s contract means that both events run independently from one other, and may lead to occasions in the future when the two events are held in different cities and countries.

==History==
===Origins===
The Far Eastern Championship Games existed previous to the Asian Games, the former mooted in 1912 for a location set between Japan, the Philippines, and China. The inaugural Far Eastern Games were held in Manila in 1913 with 6 participating nations. There were ten Far Eastern Games held by 1934. The second Sino-Japanese War in 1934, and Japan&#x27;s insistence on including the Manchu Empire as a competitor nation in the Games, caused China to announce its withdrawal from participation. The Far Eastern Games scheduled for 1938 were cancelled. The organization was eventually discontinued.

===Formation===
After World War II, several areas in Asia became sovereign states. Many of these countries sought to exhibit Asian prowess without violence. At the London 1948 Summer Olympics, a conversation started between China and the Philippines to restore the idea of the Far Eastern Games. Guru Dutt Sondhi, the Indian International Olympic Committee representative, believed that the restoration of the Far Eastern Games would sufficiently display the spirit of unity and level of achievement taking place in Asian sports. He proposed the idea of a new competition – which came to be the Asian Games. The Asian Athletic Federation would eventually be formed. A preparatory committee was set up to draft the charter for this new body. On 13 February 1949, the Asian Athletic Federation was formally inaugurated in New Delhi, announced as the inaugural host city to be held in 1950.

===Years of crises===
In 1962, the Games were hit by several crises. The host country Indonesia refused to permit Israel and Taiwan to participate due to political recognition issues. The IOC terminated its sponsorship of the Games and terminated Indonesia&#x27;s membership in the IOC. The Asian Football Confederation (AFC), International Amateur Athletics Federation (IAAF), and the International Weightlifting Federation (IWF) also removed their recognition of the Games.

South Korea renounced its plan to host the 1970 Asian Games on the grounds of a national security crisis; the main reason was due to a financial crisis. The previous host, Thailand, would host the Games in Bangkok using funds transferred from South Korea. Japan was asked to host but declined the opportunity as they were already committed to Expo &#x27;70 in Osaka. This edition marked the Games&#x27; inaugural television broadcasting, worldwide. In Tehran, in 1974, the Games formally recognized the participation of China, North Korea, and Mongolia. Israel was allowed to participate despite the opposition from the Arab world, while Taiwan was permitted to continue taking part (as &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;) although its status was abolished in a general meeting on 16 November 1973 by the Games Federation.

Before the 1978 Games, Pakistan retracted its plan to host the 1975 Games due to a financial crisis and political issues. Thailand offered to host and the Games were held in Bangkok. As in 1962, Taiwan and Israel refused participation by the Games Federation, amid political issues and security fears. Several governing bodies protested the ban. The International Olympic Committee threatened to bar the participating athletes from the 1980 Summer Olympics. Several nations withdrew before the Games opening.

===Reorganization and expansion===
These events led the National Olympic Committees in Asia to revise the constitution of the Asian Games Federation. The Olympic Council of Asia was created in November 1981, excluding Israel and Taiwan. India was scheduled to host in 1982 and the OCA decided to maintain the old AGF timetable. The OCA formally started to supervise the Games starting with the 1986 Asian Games scheduled for Seoul, South Korea. In the 1990 Asian Games held in Beijing, Taiwan (Republic of China) was re-admitted, under pressure by the People&#x27;s Republic of China to compete as &quot;Chinese Taipei&quot;.

The 1994 Games held in Hiroshima included the inaugural participation of the former 5 republics of the Soviet Union who were part of Central Asia: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. It was also the first edition of the Games held in a host country outside its capital city. However, Iraq was suspended from the Games due to the 1990 Persian Gulf War. North Korea boycotted the Games due to political issues with the host country. The Games were hampered during the opening ceremony due to a heart attack that killed Nareshkumar Adhikari, the chief of the Nepalese delegation.

The 1998 Games marked the fourth time the Games were held in Bangkok, Thailand. This time the city participated in a bidding process. The opening ceremony was on 6 December; the previous three were on 9 December. King Bhumibol Adulyadej opened the Games; the closing ceremony was on 20 December (the same date as all the previous games hosted by Thailand).

==Background==
===Symbols===
The Asian Games Movement uses symbols to represent the ideals embodied in the Asian Games charter. The Asian Games motto is &quot;Ever Onward&quot; which was designed and proposed by Guru Dutt Sondhi upon the creation of the Asian Games Federation in 1949. The Asian Games symbol is a bright sun in red with 16 rays and a white circle in the middle of its disc which represents the ever glimmering and warm spirit of the Asian people.

===Mascots===
Since the 1982 Asian Games in New Delhi, India, the Asian Games have had a mascot, usually an animal native to the area or occasionally human figures representing the cultural heritage.

===Participation===

All 45 members affiliated with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) are eligible to participate in the Games.

According to membership in the OCA, transcontinental Kazakhstan is an Asian country and could participate in the Asian Games, but this right could not apply to Egypt as the country had 6% of the territory on Sinai, participating in the African Games instead. Turkey and Russia/Soviet Union — whose major geographical parts are located in the Asian continent — participate in the European Games rather than the Asian Games. Similarly, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Cyprus, and Armenia are mostly located in Asia but participate in the European Games instead of the Asian Games.

In history, 46 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) have sent competitors to the Games. Israel has been excluded from the Games since 1976, the reason cited as being due to security reasons. Israel requested to participate in the 1982 Games, but the request was rejected by the organizers due to the Munich massacre. Israel is now a member of the European Olympic Committees (EOC) and competes at the European Games.

Taiwan, Palestine, Hong Kong, and Macau participate in the Asian Games according to membership in OCA. Due to its continuing ambiguous political status, Taiwan has participated in the Games under the flag of Chinese Taipei since 1990. Macau since 1990 has been allowed to compete as one of the NOCs in the Asian Games, despite not being recognized by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for participation in the Olympic Games.

In 2007, the President of OCA, Sheikh Ahmed Al-Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, rejected the proposal to allow Australia to participate in the Games. He stated that while Australia would add good value to the Asian Games, it would be unfair to the Oceania National Olympic Committees (ONOC). Being members of ONOC, Australia and New Zealand have participated in the Pacific Games since 2015. This motion was mooted again in 2017 after Australia participated in the 2017 Asian Winter Games as they are in discussions to become a full Asian Games member shortly. However, the Australian Olympic Committee announced that Australia would be allowed a small contingent of athletes for the 2022 Games, as long as the qualification for Summer Olympics events such as basketball and volleyball are through the Asia-Pacific region.

There are only seven countries, namely India, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Singapore, and Thailand, that have competed in all editions of the games.

==List of sports==
The historical average for the edition of events by the edition of the Asian Games is nearly 260 events with nearly 24 sports by edition. The last edition held in Hangzhou, China was the edition with the largest number of events when 481 finals in 40 sports were held. Until the 2018 edition, each host country was allowed to set up the program respecting their local demands, which led to a dizzying growth of the event. However, this flexibility rule ruled out the entry of some Olympic sports such as the modern pentathlon and triathlon of the programs of some editions between 1986 and 2006. This flexibility also increased the number of athletes participating in each edition. However, it forced the event to be massive, as there was no calculation of athlete quotas per NOC. To avoid gigantism, OCA established a new policy to be applied since the 2018 Asian Games which limited the number of sports to be played at the Games to 40. This new rule is by the Olympic program for the subsequent edition of the Summer Olympic Games and if there is any prior change, the entity will necessarily follow it. However, each region that makes up the body can nominate a regional sport according to its demands. Between one and two extra sports could also be included due to the local demands.

===Disciplines===
==Medal table==
Of the 46 National Olympic Committees participating throughout the history of the Games, 43 have won at least a single medal in the competition, leaving three National Olympic Committees without a medal: Bhutan, Maldives, and Timor-Leste yet to win a single medal. 38 National Olympic Committees have won at least one gold medal (only Japan and India have done so at every Asian Games), while Japan and China became the only two NOCs in history to emerge as the first places at the Medal Tables.

In the 2022 Games, India became the fourth nation in history after Japan, China, and South Korea to cross the 100-medal mark in one edition. China, together with Japan and South Korea became the first three countries to cross the overall 200-medal mark in one edition during the 1986 Asian Games. At the 2022 Games, China became the first NOC to surpass the threshold of 100 gold medals, 200 gold medals, 300 overall medals and 400 overall medals in a single edition.

==MVP table==
The Most Valuable Player or MVP award was introduced in the 1998 Games in Bangkok, Thailand. The award was originally awarded to one individual. During the 2022 edition in Hangzhou, the Games started awarding a male and a female athlete separately.

==Centennial Festival==
On 8 November 2012, the OCA decided at its 31st General Assembly in Macau to create a special multi-sport event called the Asian Games Centennial Festival in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Oriental Games, now known as the Far Eastern Championship Games. OCA awarded the Philippines the hosting rights as it was also the host 100 years previous. The event was originally scheduled to be held in Boracay, Malay, Aklan from 27 to 29 November 2013 but due to the events surrounding Typhoon Haiyan, it was moved to January 2014.

<text>Business is the practice of making one&#x27;s living or making money by producing or buying and selling products (such as goods and services). It is also &quot;any activity or enterprise entered into for profit.&quot;

A business entity is not necessarily separate from the owner and the creditors can hold the owner liable for debts the business has acquired. The taxation system for businesses is different from that of the corporates. A business structure does not allow for corporate tax rates. The proprietor is personally taxed on all income from the business.

A distinction is made in law and public offices between the term business and a company such as a corporation or cooperative. Colloquially, the terms are used interchangeably.

Corporations are distinct from with sole proprietors and partnerships. They are separate legal entities and provide limited liability for their owners and members. They are subject to corporate tax rates. They are also more complicated and expensive to set up, but offer more protection and benefits for the owners and members.

== Forms ==

Forms of business ownership vary by jurisdiction, but several common entities exist:
* A sole proprietorship, also known as a sole trader, is owned by one person and operates for their benefit. The owner operates the business alone and may hire employees. A sole proprietor has unlimited liability for all obligations incurred by the business, whether from operating costs or judgments against the business. All assets of the business belong to a sole proprietor, including, for example, a computer infrastructure, any inventory, manufacturing equipment, or retail fixtures, as well as any real property owned by the sole proprietor.
* A partnership is a business owned by two or more people. In most forms of partnerships, each partner has unlimited liability for the debts incurred by the business. The three most prevalent types of for-profit partnerships are general partnerships, limited partnerships, and limited liability partnerships.
* Corporations&#x27; owners have limited liability, and the business has a legal personality separate from its owners. Corporations can be either government-owned or privately owned, and they can organize either for profit or as nonprofit organizations. A privately owned, for-profit corporation is owned by its shareholders, who elect a board of directors to direct the corporation and hire its managerial staff. A privately owned, for-profit corporation can be either privately held by a small group of individuals, or publicly held, with publicly traded shares listed on a stock exchange.
* A cooperative or co-op is a limited-liability business that can organize as for-profit or not-for-profit. A cooperative differs from a corporation in that it has members, not shareholders, and they share decision-making authority. Cooperatives are typically classified as either consumer cooperatives or worker cooperatives. Cooperatives are fundamental to the ideology of economic democracy.
* Limited liability companies (LLC) and other specific types of business organization protect their owners or shareholders from business failure by doing business under a separate legal entity with certain legal protections. In contrast, a general partnership or persons working on their own are usually not as protected.
* A franchise is a system in which entrepreneurs purchase the rights to open and run a business from a larger corporation. Franchising in the United States is widespread and is a major economic powerhouse. One out of twelve retail businesses in the United States are franchised and 8 million people are employed in a franchised business.
* Company limited by guarantee is commonly used where companies are formed for non-commercial purposes, such as clubs or charities. The members guarantee the payment of certain (usually nominal) amounts if the company goes into insolvent liquidation, but otherwise, they have no economic rights in relation to the company. This type of company is common in England. A company limited by guarantee may be with or without having share capital.
* A company limited by shares is the most common form of the company used for business ventures. Specifically, a limited company is a &quot;company in which the liability of each shareholder is limited to the amount individually invested&quot; with corporations being &quot;the most common example of a limited company.&quot; This type of company is common in England and many English-speaking countries. A company limited by shares may be a
** publicly traded company or a
** privately held company.
* A company limited by guarantee with a share capital is a hybrid entity, usually used where the company is formed for non-commercial purposes, but the activities of the company are partly funded by investors who expect a return. This type of company may no longer be formed in the UK, although provisions still exist in law for them to exist.
* An unlimited company with or without a share capital is a hybrid entity, a company where the liability of members or shareholders for the debts (if any) of the company are not limited. In this case, the doctrine of a veil of incorporation does not apply.
Less common types of companies are:
* Most corporations by letters patent are &quot;corporations sole&quot; and not companies as the term is commonly understood today.
* Charter corporations were the only types of companies before the passing of modern companies legislation. Now they are relatively rare, except for very old companies that still survive (of which there are still many, particularly many British banks), or modern societies that fulfill a quasi-regulatory function (for example, the Bank of England is a corporation formed by a modern charter).
* Statutory companies are certain companies that have been formed by a private statute passed in the relevant jurisdiction, and are relatively rare today.
&quot;Ltd after the company&#x27;s name signifies limited company, and PLC (public limited company) indicates that its shares are widely held.&quot;

In legal parlance, the owners of a company are normally referred to as the &quot;members&quot;. In a company limited or unlimited by shares (formed or incorporated with a share capital), this will be the shareholders. In a company limited by guarantee, this will be the guarantors. Some offshore jurisdictions have created special forms of offshore company in a bid to attract business for their jurisdictions. Examples include &quot;segregated portfolio companies&quot; and restricted purpose companies.

There are, however, many, many sub-categories of types of company that can be formed in various jurisdictions in the world.

Companies are also sometimes distinguished into public companies and private companies for legal and regulatory purposes. Public companies are companies whose shares can be publicly traded, often (although not always) on a stock exchange which imposes listing requirements/Listing Rules as to the issued shares, the trading of shares and a future issue of shares to help bolster the reputation of the exchange or particular market of exchange. Private companies do not have publicly traded shares, and often contain restrictions on transfers of shares. In some jurisdictions, private companies have maximum numbers of shareholders.

A parent company is a company that owns enough voting stock in another firm to control management and operations by influencing or electing its board of directors; the second company being deemed as a subsidiary of the parent company. The subsidiary company can be allowed to maintain its own board of directors. The definition of a parent company differs by jurisdiction, with the definition normally being defined by way of laws dealing with companies in that jurisdiction.

== Classifications ==

* Agriculture, such as the domestication of fish, animals, and livestock, as well as lumber, oil, vegetables, fruits, etc.
* Mining businesses that extract natural resources and raw materials, such as wood, petroleum, natural gas, ores, metals or minerals.
* Service businesses offer intangible goods or services and typically charge for labor or other services provided to government, to consumers, or to other businesses. Interior decorators, beauticians, hair stylists, make-up artists, tanning salons, laundromats, dry cleaners, and pest controllers are service businesses.
** Financial services businesses include banks, brokerage firms, credit unions, credit cards, insurance companies, asset and investment companies such as private-equity firms, private-equity funds, real estate investment trusts, sovereign wealth funds, pension funds, mutual funds, index funds, hedge funds, stock exchanges, and other companies that generate profits through investment and management of capital.
** Transportation businesses such as railways, airlines, and shipping companies deliver goods and individuals to their destinations for a fee.
** Utilities produce public services such as water, electricity, waste management or sewage treatment. These industries are usually operated under the charge of a public government.
* Entertainment companies and mass media agencies generate profits primarily from the sale of intellectual property. They include film studios and production houses, mass media companies such as cable television networks, online digital media agencies, talent agencies, mobile media outlets, newspapers, book and magazine publishing houses.
** Sports organizations are involved in producing, facilitating, promoting, or organizing any activity, experience, or business enterprise focused on sports. They make their profits by selling goods and services that are sports related.
* Industrial manufacturers produce products, either from raw materials or from component parts, then export the finished products at a profit. They include tangible goods such as cars, buses, medical devices, glass, or aircraft.
* Real estate businesses sell, invest, construct and develop properties, including land, residential homes, and other buildings.
* Retailers, wholesalers, and distributors act as middlemen and get goods produced by manufacturers to the intended consumers; they make their profits by marking up their prices. Most stores and catalog companies are distributors or retailers.

== Activities ==
=== Accounting ===

Accounting is the measurement, processing, and communication of financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494. Accounting, which has been called the &quot;language of business&quot;, measures the results of an organization&#x27;s economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators. Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms &quot;accounting&quot; and &quot;financial reporting&quot; are often used as synonyms.

===Commerce===

Commerce is the process of exchanging goods and services.
It is not just a single activity, but a set of activities that includes trade (buying and selling goods and services) and auxiliary services or aids to trade, that includes communication and marketing, logistics, finance, banking, insurance, and legal services related to trade. Business is also defined as engaging in commerce, as these are done in all businesses.

=== Finance ===
Finance is a field that deals with the study of money and investments. It includes the dynamics of assets and liabilities over time under conditions of different degrees of uncertainty and risk.
In the context of business and management, finance deals with the problems of ensuring that the firm can safely and profitably carry out its operational and financial objectives; i.e. that it: (1) has sufficient cash flow for ongoing and upcoming operational expenses, and (2) can service both maturing short-term debt repayments, and scheduled long-term debt payments.
Finance also deals with the &quot;long term&quot; objective of maximizing the value of the business, while also balancing risk and profitability; this includes the interrelated questions of (1) capital investment, which businesses and projects to invest in; (2) capital structure, deciding on the mix of funding to be used; and (3) dividend policy, what to do with &quot;excess&quot; capital.

=== Human resources ===
Human resources can be defined as division of business that involves finding, screening, recruiting, and training job applicants. Human resources, or HR, is crucial for all businesses to succeed as it helps companies adjust to a fast-moving business environment and the increasing demand for jobs.

The term &quot;Human Resource&quot; was first coined by John R. Commons in his novel &quot;&#x27;The Distribution of Wealth&#x27;.&quot; HR departments are relatively new as they began developing in the late 20th century. HR departments main goal is to maximize employee productivity and protecting the company from any issues that may arise in the future. Some of the most common activities conducted by those working in HR include increasing innovation and creativity within a company, applying new approaches to work projects, and efficient training and communication with employees.

Two of the most popular subdivisions of HR are Human Resource Management, HRM, and Human Resource Information Systems, or HRIS. The HRM route is for those who prefer an administrative role as it involves oversight of the entirety of the company. HRIS involves the storage and organization of employee data including full names, addresses, means of contact, and anything else required by that certain company.

Some careers of those involved in the Human Resource field include enrollment specialists, HR analyst, recruiter, employment relations manager, etc.

===Information technology===
Many businesses have an Information technology (IT) department, which supports the use of information technology and computer systems in support of enterprise goals. The role of a chief information officer is to lead this department. For example, Ford Motor Company in the United States employs &quot;more than 3,000 team members with advanced computing, analytical and technical skills&quot;.

=== Manufacturing ===

Manufacturing is the production of merchandise for use or sale using labour and machines, tools, chemical and biological processing, or formulation. The term may refer to a range of human activity, from handicraft to high tech, but is most commonly applied to industrial production, in which raw materials are transformed into finished goods on a large scale.

=== Marketing ===

Marketing is defined by the American Marketing Association as &quot;the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large.&quot; The term developed from the original meaning which referred literally to going to a market to buy or sell goods or services. Marketing tactics include advertising as well as determining product pricing.

With the rise in technology, marketing is further divided into a class called digital marketing. It is marketing products and services using digital technologies.

=== Research and development ===

Research and development refer to activities in connection with corporate or government innovation. Research and development constitute the first stage of development of a potential new service or product. Research and development are very difficult to manage since the defining feature of the research is that the researchers do not know in advance exactly how to accomplish the desired result.

=== Safety ===
Injuries cost businesses billions of dollars annually. Studies have shown how company acceptance and implementation of comprehensive safety and health management systems reduce incidents, insurance costs, and workers&#x27; compensation claims. New technologies, like wearable safety devices and available online safety training, continue to be developed to encourage employers to invest in protection beyond the &quot;canary in the coal mine&quot; and reduce the cost to businesses of protecting their employees.

=== Sales ===

Sales are activity related to selling or the number of goods or services sold in a given time period. Sales are often integrated with all lines of business and are key to a companies&#x27; success.

== Management ==
The efficient and effective operation of a business, and study of this subject, is called management. The major branches of management are financial management, marketing management, human resource management, strategic management, production management, operations management, service management, and information technology management.

Owners may manage their businesses themselves, or employ managers to do so for them. Whether they are owners or employees, managers administer three primary components of the business&#x27;s value: financial resources, capital (tangible resources), and human resources. These resources are administered in at least six functional areas: legal contracting, manufacturing or service production, marketing, accounting, financing, and human resources.

=== Restructuring state enterprises ===
In recent decades, states modeled some of their assets and enterprises after business enterprises. In 2003, for example, China modeled 80% of its state-owned enterprises on a company-type management system. Many state institutions and enterprises in China and Russia have transformed into joint-stock companies, with part of their shares being listed on public stock markets.

=== Business process management ===
Business process management (BPM) is a holistic management approach focused on aligning all aspects of an organization with the wants and needs of clients. BPM attempts to improve processes continuously. It can, therefore, be described as a &quot;process optimization process&quot;. It is argued that BPM enables organizations to be more efficient, effective and capable of change than a functionally focused, traditional hierarchical management approach. 

== Organization and regulation ==

Most legal jurisdictions specify the forms of ownership that a business can take, creating a body of commercial law applicable to business.

The major factors affecting how a business is organized are usually:
* The size and scope of the business firm and its structure, management, and ownership, broadly analyzed in the theory of the firm. Generally, a smaller business is more flexible, while larger businesses, or those with wider ownership or more formal structures, will usually tend to be organized as corporations or (less often) partnerships. In addition, a business that wishes to raise money on a stock market or to be owned by a wide range of people will often be required to adopt a specific legal form to do so.
* The sector and country. Private profit-making businesses are different from government-owned bodies. In some countries, certain businesses are legally obliged to be organized in certain ways.
* Tax advantages. Different structures are treated differently in tax law and may have advantages for this reason.
* Disclosure and compliance requirements. Different business structures may be required to make less or more information public (or report it to relevant authorities) and may be bound to comply with different rules and regulations.
* Control and coordination requirements. In function of the risk and complexity of the tasks to organize, a business is organized through a set of formal and informal mechanisms. In particular, contractual and relational governance can help mitigate opportunism as well as support communication and information sharing.

Many businesses are operated through a separate entity such as a corporation or a partnership (either formed with or without limited liability). Most legal jurisdictions allow people to organize such an entity by filing certain charter documents with the relevant Secretary of State or equivalent and complying with certain other ongoing obligations. The relationships and legal rights of shareholders, limited partners, or members are governed partly by the charter documents and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the entity is organized. Generally speaking, shareholders in a corporation, limited partners in a limited partnership, and members in a limited liability company are shielded from personal liability for the debts and obligations of the entity, which is legally treated as a separate &quot;person&quot;. This means that unless there is misconduct, the owner&#x27;s own possessions are strongly protected in law if the business does not succeed.

Where two or more individuals own a business together but have failed to organize a more specialized form of vehicle, they will be treated as a general partnership. The terms of a partnership are partly governed by a partnership agreement if one is created, and partly by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. No paperwork or filing is necessary to create a partnership, and without an agreement, the relationships and legal rights of the partners will be entirely governed by the law of the jurisdiction where the partnership is located. A single person who owns and runs a business is commonly known as a &quot;sole proprietor&quot;, whether that person owns it directly or through a formally organized entity. Depending on the business needs, an adviser can decide what kind is proprietorship will be most suitable.

General partners in a partnership (other than a limited liability partnership), plus anyone who personally owns and operates a business without creating a separate legal entity, are personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business.

Generally, corporations are required to pay tax just like &quot;real&quot; people. In some tax systems, this can give rise to so-called double taxation, because first the corporation pays tax on the profit, and then when the corporation distributes its profits to its owners, individuals have to include dividends in their income when they complete their personal tax returns, at which point a second layer of income tax is imposed.

In most countries, there are laws that treat small corporations differently from large ones. They may be exempt from certain legal filing requirements or labor laws, have simplified procedures in specialized areas, and have simplified, advantageous, or slightly different tax treatment.

&quot;Going public&quot; through a process known as an initial public offering (IPO) means that part of the business will be owned by members of the public. This requires the organization as a distinct entity, to disclose information to the public, and adhering to a tighter set of laws and procedures. Most public entities are corporations that have sold shares, but increasingly there are also public LLC&#x27;s that sell units (sometimes also called shares), and other more exotic entities as well, such as, for example, real estate investment trusts in the US, and unit trusts in the UK. A general partnership cannot &quot;go public&quot;.

=== Commercial law ===
A very detailed and well-established body of rules that evolved over a very long period of time applies to commercial transactions. The need to regulate trade and commerce and resolve business disputes helped shape the creation of law and courts. The Code of Hammurabi dates back to about 1772 BC for example and contains provisions that relate, among other matters, to shipping costs and dealings between merchants and brokers. The word &quot;corporation&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;corpus&quot;, meaning body, and the Maurya Empire in Iron-Age India accorded legal rights to business entities.

In many countries, it is difficult to compile all the laws that can affect a business into a single reference source. Laws can govern the treatment of labour and employee relations, worker protection and safety, discrimination on the basis of age, gender, disability, race, and in some jurisdictions, sexual orientation, and the minimum wage, as well as unions, worker compensation, and working hours and leave.

Some specialized businesses may also require licenses, either due to laws governing entry into certain trades, occupations or professions, that require special education or to raise revenue for local governments. Professions that require special licenses include law, medicine, piloting aircraft, selling liquor, radio broadcasting, selling investment securities, selling used cars, and roofing. Local jurisdictions may also require special licenses and taxes just to operate a business.

Some businesses are subject to ongoing special regulation, for example, public utilities, investment securities, banking, insurance, broadcasting, aviation, and health care providers. Environmental regulations are also very complex and can affect many businesses.

=== Capital ===
 When businesses need to raise money (called capital), they sometimes offer securities for sale.

Capital may be raised through private means, by an initial public offering or IPO on a stock exchange, or in multiple other ways.

Major stock exchanges include the Shanghai Stock Exchange, Singapore Exchange, Hong Kong Stock Exchange, New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ (the US), the London Stock Exchange (UK), the Tokyo Stock Exchange (Japan), and Bombay Stock Exchange (India). Most countries with capital markets have at least one.

Businesses that have gone public are subject to regulations concerning their internal governance, such as how executive officers&#x27; compensation is determined, and when and how information is disclosed to shareholders and to the public. In the United States, these regulations are primarily implemented and enforced by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Other western nations have comparable regulatory bodies. The regulations are implemented and enforced by the China Securities Regulation Commission (CSRC) in China. In Singapore, the regulatory authority is the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), and in Hong Kong, it is the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC).

The proliferation and increasing complexity of the laws governing business have forced increasing specialization in corporate law. It is not unheard of for certain kinds of corporate transactions to require a team of five to ten attorneys due to sprawling regulation. Commercial law spans general corporate law, employment and labor law, health-care law, securities law, mergers and acquisitions, tax law, employee benefit plans, food and drug regulation, intellectual property law on copyrights, patents, trademarks, telecommunications law, and financing.

Other types of capital sourcing include crowdsourcing on the Internet, venture capital, bank loans, and debentures.

=== Intellectual property ===

Businesses often have important &quot;intellectual property&quot; that needs protection from competitors for the company to stay profitable. This could require patents, copyrights, trademarks, or preservation of trade secrets. Most businesses have names, logos, and similar branding techniques that could benefit from trademarking. Patents and copyrights in the United States are largely governed by federal law, while trade secrets and trademarking are mostly a matter of state law. Because of the nature of intellectual property, a business needs protection in every jurisdiction in which they are concerned about competitors. Many countries are signatories to international treaties concerning intellectual property, and thus companies registered in these countries are subject to national laws bound by these treaties. In order to protect trade secrets, companies may require employees to sign noncompete clauses which will impose limitations on an employee&#x27;s interactions with stakeholders, and competitors.

=== Trade unions===

A trade union (or labor union) is an organization of workers who have come together to achieve common goals such as protecting the integrity of its trade, improving safety standards, achieving higher pay and benefits such as health care and retirement, increasing the number of employees an employer assigns to complete the work, and better working conditions. The trade union, through its leadership, bargains with the employer on behalf of union members ( members) and negotiates labor contracts (collective bargaining) with employers. The most common purpose of these associations or unions is &quot;maintaining or improving the conditions of their employment&quot;. This may include the negotiation of wages, work rules, complaint procedures, rules governing hiring, firing, and promotion of workers, benefits, workplace safety and policies.

<text>Commerce is the organized system of activities, functions, procedures and institutions that directly or indirectly contribute to the smooth, unhindered large-scale distribution and transfer (exchange through buying and selling) of goods and services at the right time, place, quantity, quality and price through various channels among the original producers and the final consumers within local, regional, national or international economies. The diversity in the distribution of natural resources, differences of human needs and wants, and division of labour along with comparative advantage are the principal factors that give rise to commercial exchanges.
Commerce consists of trade and aids to trade (i.e. auxiliary commercial services) taking place along the entire supply chain. Trade is the exchange of goods (including raw materials, intermediate and finished goods) and services between buyers and sellers in return for an agreed-upon price at traditional (or online) marketplaces. It is categorized into domestic trade, including retail and wholesale as well as local, regional, inter-regional and international/foreign trade (encompassing import, export and entrepôt/re-export trades). The exchange of currencies (in foreign exchange markets), commodities (in commodity markets/exchanges) and securities and derivatives (in stock exchanges and financial markets) in specialized exchange markets also falls under the umbrella of trade. On the other hand, auxiliary commercial activities (aids to trade) which can facilitate trade include commercial intermediaries, banking, credit financing and related services, transportation, packaging, warehousing, communication, advertising and insurance. Their purpose is to remove hindrances related to direct personal contact, payments, savings, funding, separation of place and time, product protection and preservation, knowledge and risk.

The broader framework of commerce incorporates additional elements and factors such as laws and regulations (including intellectual property rights and antitrust laws), policies, tariffs and trade barriers, consumers and consumer trends, producers and production strategies, supply chains and their management, financial transactions for ordinary and extraordinary business activities, market dynamics (including supply and demand), technological innovation, competition and entrepreneurship, trade agreements, multinational corporations and small and medium-sized enterprisess (SMEs), and macroeconomic factors (like economic stability).
Commerce drives economic growth, development and prosperity, promotes regional and international interdependence, fosters cultural exchange, creates jobs, improves people&#x27;s standard of living by giving them access to a wider variety of goods and services, and encourages innovation and competition for better products. On the other hand, commerce can worsen economic inequality by concentrating wealth (and power) into the hands of a small number of individuals, and by prioritizing short-term profit over long-term sustainability and ethical, social, and environmental considerations, leading to environmental degradation, labor exploitation and disregard for consumer safety. Unregulated, it can lead to excessive consumption (generating undesirable waste) and unsustainable exploitation of nature (causing resource depletion). Harnessing commerce&#x27;s benefits for the society while mitigating its drawbacks remains vital for policymakers, businesses and other stakeholders, who are increasingly adopting sustainable practices, ethical sourcing, and circular economy models,

Commerce traces its origins to ancient localized barter systems, leading to the establishment of periodic marketplaces, and culminating in the development of currencies for efficient trade. In medieval times, trade routes (like the Silk Road) with pivotal commercial hubs (like Venice) connected regions and continents, enabling long-distance trade and cultural exchange. From the 15th to the early 20th century, European colonial powers dominated global commerce on an unprecedented scale, giving rise to maritime trade empires with their powerful colonial trade companies (e.g., Dutch East India Company and British East India Company) and ushering in an unprecedented global exchange (see Columbian exchange). In the 19th century, modern banking and related international markets along with the Industrial Revolution fundamentally reshaped commerce. In the post-colonial 20th century, free market principles gained ground, multinational corporations and consumer economies thrived in U.S.-led capitalist countries and free trade agreements (like GATT and WTO) emerged, whereas communist economies encountered trade restrictions, limiting consumer choice. Furthermore, in the mid-20th century, the adoption of standardized shipping containers facilitated seamless and efficient intermodal freight transport, leading to a surge in international trade. By the century&#x27;s end, developing countries saw their share in world trade rise from a quarter to a third. 21st century commerce is increasingly technology-driven (see e-commerce, role of artificial intelligence and automation), globalized, intricately regulated, ethically responsible and sustainability-focused (e.g., climate-resilient trade practices), with multilateral economic integrations (like the European Union) or coalitions (like BRICS), gig economy and platform-based uberisation of services, geopolitical shifts and trade wars leading to its reconfiguration. 
==Etymology==
The English-language word &quot;commerce&quot; has been derived from the Latin word , from (&quot;together&quot;) and (&quot;merchandise&quot;).

==Relation to business and trade==

Despite many similarities (to the extent that they are sometimes used as synonyms in layman&#x27;s terms and in other contexts), commerce, business and trade are distinct concepts.

===Commerce and business===
Commerce deals with buying, selling and distribution of goods and services from producers to customers as well as related matters such as marketing, finance, laws, transportation and insurance.

In a general sense, business is the activity of earning money and making one&#x27;s living through engaging in commerce. The difference between business and commerce is that business can also refer to a commercial entity, such as a company. So, in a more specific sense, a business is an organization or activity for making a profit by providing goods and services which meet the needs of its customers or consumers.

Viewed in this way, commerce is a broader concept and an overall, all-encompassing aspect of business. Commerce provides the underlying large-scale transactional environment comprising all kinds of exchanges within which individual business organizations operate for generating profits.

===Commerce and trade===
Commerce is distinguishable from trade as well. Trade is the transaction (buying and selling) of goods and services that makes a profit for the seller and satisfies the want or need of the buyer. When trade is carried out within a country, it is called home or domestic trade, which can be wholesale or retail. A wholesaler buys from the producer in bulk and sells to the retailer who then sells again to the final consumer in smaller quantities. Trade between a country and the rest of the world is called foreign or international trade, which consists of import trade and export trade, both being wholesale in general.

Commerce not only includes trade as defined above, but also the auxiliary services or aids to trade and means that facilitate such trade. Auxiliary services aid trade by providing services which such as transportation, communication, warehousing, insurance, banking, credit financing to companies, advertising, packaging, and the services of commercial agents and agencies. In other words, commerce encompasses a wide array of political, economical, technological, logistical, legal, regulatory, social and cultural aspects of trade on a large scale. From a marketing perspective, commerce creates time and place utility by making goods and services available to the customers at the right place and at the right time by changing their location or placement.

Described in this manner, trade is a part of commerce and commerce is an aspect of business.

==History==
Historian Peter Watson and Ramesh Manickam date the history of long-distance commerce from 150,000 years ago. In historic times, the introduction of currency as a standardized money facilitated the exchange of goods and services.

Commerce was a costly endeavor in the antiquities because of the risky nature of transportation, which restricted it to local markets. Commerce then expanded along with the improvement of transportation systems over time. In the Middle Ages, long-distance and large-scale commerce was still limited within continents. Banking systems developed in medieval Europe, facilitating financial transactions across national boundaries. Markets became a feature of town life, and were regulated by town authorities. With the advent of the Age of Discovery and oceangoing ships, commerce took an international, trans-continental stature.

Currently the reliability of international trans-oceanic shipping and mailing systems and the facility of the Internet has made commerce possible between cities, regions and countries situated anywhere in the world. In the 21st century, Internet-based electronic commerce (where financial information is transferred over Internet), and its subcategories such as wireless mobile commerce and social network-based social commerce have been and continue to get adopted widely.

==Regulation==

Legislative bodies and ministries or ministerial departments of commerce regulate, promote and manage domestic and foreign commercial activities within a country. International commerce can be regulated by bilateral treaties between countries. After the second world war and the rise of free trade among nations, multilateral arrangements such as the GATT and later the World Trade Organization became the principal systems regulating global commerce. The International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is another important organization which sets rules and resolves disputes in international commerce.

Where national government bodies undertake commercial activity with or inside other states, this commercial activity may fall outside the protection of the international rules which govern legal relationships between independent states: see, for example, the &quot;commercial activity exception&quot; applicable under the United States&#x27; Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976.

<text>Philip Melanchthon (born Philipp Schwartzerdt; 16 February 1497 – 19 April 1560) was a German Lutheran reformer, collaborator with Martin Luther, the first systematic theologian of the Protestant Reformation, an intellectual leader of the Lutheran Reformation, and influential designer of educational systems.

He stands next to Luther and John Calvin as a reformer, theologian, and shaper of Protestantism.

==Early life and education==

He was born Philipp Schwartzerdt on 16 February 1497 at Bretten, where his father Georg Schwarzerdt (1459–1508) was armorer to Philip, Count Palatine of the Rhine. His mother was Barbara Reuter (1476/77-1529). Bretten was burned in 1689 by French troops during the War of the Palatinate Succession. The town&#x27;s Melanchthonhaus was built on the site of his place of birth in 1897.

In 1507 he was sent to the Latin school at Pforzheim, where the rector, Georg Simler of Wimpfen, introduced him to the Latin and Greek poets and to Aristotle. He was influenced by his great-uncle Johann Reuchlin, a Renaissance humanist, who suggested Philipp follow a custom common among humanists of the time and change his surname from &quot;Schwartzerdt&quot; (literally &#x27;black earth&#x27;), into the Greek equivalent &quot;Melanchthon&quot; ().

Philipp was 11 years old in 1508 when both his grandfather (d. 17 October) and father (d. 27 October) died within eleven days of each other. He and a brother were brought to Pforzheim to live with his maternal grandmother, Elizabeth Reuter, sister of Reuchlin.

The next year he entered the University of Heidelberg, where he studied philosophy, rhetoric, astronomy, and astrology, and became known as a scholar of Greek thought. In 1509, Melanchthon received his B.A. at the University of Heidelberg, and in 1512, his M.A. at Tübingen, where he would teach after obtaining his degrees. In 1518, he was called to Wittenberg at the request of his uncle to teach Greek. While there, he was also taught the technical aspects of astrology by Johannes Stöffler.

After gaining a master&#x27;s degree in 1512, he began to study theology at Tübingen. Under the influence of Reuchlin, Erasmus, and others, he became convinced that true Christianity was something different from the scholastic theology taught at the university. In 1519, he received a B.D. and quickly began collaborating with Martin Luther on a translation of the Bible. 

His first publications included a number of poems in a collection edited by Jakob Wimpfeling (), the preface to Reuchlin&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1514), an edition of Terence (1516), and a book of Greek grammar (1518).

==Professor at Wittenberg==

Already recognized as a reformer, he was opposed at Tübingen. He accepted a call to the University of Wittenberg from Martin Luther on the recommendation of his great-uncle, and became professor of Greek there in 1518 at the age of 21. He studied the Scriptures, especially of Paul, and evangelical doctrine. He attended the disputation of Leipzig (1519) as a spectator, but participated with his own comments. After his views were attacked by Johann Eck, he replied based on the authority of Scripture in his &quot;Defensio contra Johannem Eckium&quot; (Wittenberg, 1519).

Following lectures on the Gospel of Matthew and the Epistle to the Romans, together with his investigations into Pauline doctrine, he was granted the degree of bachelor of theology, and transferred to the theological faculty. He married Katharina Krapp (Katharina Melanchthon), (1497–1557) daughter of Wittenberg&#x27;s mayor, on 25 November 1520. They had four children: Anna, Philipp, Georg, and Magdalen.

==Theological disputes==

In the beginning of 1521, Melanchthon defended Luther in his &quot;Didymi Faventini versus Thomam Placentinum pro M. Luthero oratio&quot; (Wittenberg, n.d.). He argued that Luther rejected only papal and ecclesiastical practises which were at variance with Scripture. But while Luther was absent at Wartburg Castle, during the disturbances caused by the Zwickau prophets, Melanchthon wavered.

The appearance of Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Loci communes rerum theologicarum seu hypotyposes theologicae&quot; (Wittenberg and Basel, 1521) was of subsequent importance to the Reformation. Melanchthon discussed the &quot;leading thoughts&quot; of Paul&#x27;s Letter to the Romans and used this platform to present a new doctrine of Christianity; one where faith in God was more important than good deeds. &quot;Loci communes&quot; contributed to the gradual rise of the Lutheran scholastic tradition, and the later theologians Martin Chemnitz, Mathias Haffenreffer, and Leonhard Hutter expanded upon it. Melanchthon continued to lecture on the classics.

On a journey in 1524 to his native town, he encountered the papal legate, Cardinal Lorenzo Campeggio, who tried to draw him from Luther&#x27;s cause. In his &quot;Unterricht der Visitatorn an die Pfarherrn im Kurfürstentum zu Sachssen&quot; (1528) Melanchthon presented the evangelical doctrine of salvation as well as regulations for churches and schools.

In 1529, Melanchthon accompanied the elector to the Diet of Speyer. His hopes of persuading the Holy Roman Empire to recognize the Reformation were not fulfilled. A friendly attitude towards the Swiss at the Diet was something he later changed, calling Huldrych Zwingli&#x27;s doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s Supper &quot;an impious dogma&quot;.

==Augsburg Confession==
The composition now known as the &quot;Augsburg Confession&quot; was presented at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, and would come to be considered perhaps the most significant document of the Protestant Reformation.

While the confession was based on Luther&#x27;s Marburg and Schwabach articles, it was mainly the work of Melanchthon; although it was commonly thought of as a unified statement of doctrine by the two reformers, Luther did not conceal his dissatisfaction with its irenic tone. Indeed, some would criticize Melanchthon&#x27;s conduct at the Diet as unbecoming of the principle he promoted, implying that faith in the truth of his cause should logically have inspired Melanchthon to a firmer and more dignified posture. Others point out that he had not sought the part of a political leader, suggesting that he seemed to lack the requisite energy and decision for such a role and may simply have been a lackluster judge of human nature.

Melanchthon represented Luther at the conference, as Luther was barred from attending. Charles V had called the Diet of Augsburg in order to unite religious groups in the face of a potential war with the Ottoman Empire. However, despite all efforts and attempts at compromise, there was no reconciliation between Catholics and Lutherans.

After the confession was discussed and official response, the Pontifical Confutation of the Augsburg Confession was produced. Melanchthon wrote a reply to this which became known as the Apology of the Augsburg Confession.

Melanchthon then settled into the comparative quiet of his academic and literary labours. His most important theological work of this period was the &quot;Commentarii in Epistolam Pauli ad Romanos&quot; (Wittenberg, 1532), noteworthy for introducing the idea that &quot;to be justified&quot; means &quot;to be accounted just&quot;, whereas the Apology had placed side by side the meanings of &quot;to be made just&quot; and &quot;to be accounted just&quot;. Melanchthon&#x27;s increasing fame gave occasion for prestigious invitations to Tübingen (September 1534), France, and England but consideration of the elector caused him to refuse them.

In 1540, he produced a revised edition, the Variata, which was signed by John Calvin. The main difference is in the treatment of the real presence in the Lord&#x27;s Supper. Many Lutheran churches specify that they subscribe to the &quot;Unaltered Augsburg Confession&quot;, as opposed to the Variata.

==Controversies in the 1530s==
Melanchthon played an important role in discussions concerning the Lord&#x27;s Supper which began in 1531. He approved of Bucer&#x27;s Wittenberg Concord and discussed the question with Bucer in Kassel in 1534. He worked for an agreement on this question, as his patristic studies and the Dialogue (1530) of Johannes Oecolampadius had made him doubt the correctness of Luther&#x27;s doctrine.

Zwingli&#x27;s death and the change of the political situation changed his earlier stance in regard to a union. Bucer did not go so far as to believe with Luther that the true body of Christ in the Lord&#x27;s Supper is bitten by the teeth, but admitted the offering of the body and blood in the symbols of bread and wine. Melanchthon discussed Bucer&#x27;s views with Luther&#x27;s adherent, but Luther himself would not agree to a &quot;veiling&quot; of the dispute.Melanchthon&#x27;s relationship with Luther was not changed by his mediation work, although for a time Luther suspected that Melanchthon was &quot;almost of the opinion of Zwingli&quot;.

During his time in Tübingen in 1536 Melanchthon was heavily criticised by Cordatus, preacher in Niemeck, as he had taught that works are necessary for salvation. In the second edition of his &quot;Loci&quot; (1535), he abandoned his earlier strict doctrine of determinism and instead taught what he called Synergism. He repudiated Cordatus&#x27; criticism in a letter to Luther and his other colleagues, stating that he had never departed from their common teachings on this subject and in the Antinomian Controversy of 1537 Melanchthon was in harmony with Luther.

==Controversies in the 1540s==

Melanchthon faced controversies over the Interims and the Adiaphora (1547). He rejected the Augsburg Interim, which the emperor wished to impose. During negotiations concerning the Leipzig Interim he made controversial concessions. In agreeing to various Catholic usages, Melanchthon held the opinion that they are adiaphora, if nothing is changed in the pure doctrine and the sacraments which Jesus instituted. However he disregarded the position that concessions made under such circumstances have to be regarded as a denial of Evangelical convictions.

Melanchthon later regretted his actions.

After Luther&#x27;s death he became seen by many as the &quot;theological leader of the German Reformation&quot; although the Gnesio-Lutherans led by Matthias Flacius accused him and his followers of heresy and apostasy. Melanchthon bore the accusations with patience, dignity, and self-control.

In his controversy on justification with Andreas Osiander Melanchthon satisfied all parties. He took part also in a controversy with Stancaro, who held that Christ was our justification only according to his human nature.

==Controversies in the 1550s==
In 1552 the Elector of Saxony declared himself ready to send deputies to a council to be convened at Trent, but only under the condition that the Protestants should have a share in the discussions, and that the Pope should not be considered as the presiding officer and judge. This declaration was partly due to advice from Melanchthon. As it was agreed upon to send a confession to Trent, Melanchthon drew up the Confessio Saxonica, a repetition of the Augsburg Confession, discussing in greater detail the points of controversy with Rome. On his way to Trent at Dresden in March 1552, he saw the military preparations of Maurice of Saxony, and after reaching Nuremberg, he returned to Wittenberg, as Maurice had turned against the emperor. After his return, the condition of the Protestants became more favourable and were still more so at the Peace of Augsburg (1555). However Melanchthon&#x27;s difficulties increased from that time.

The last years of his life were embittered by disputes over the Interim and the freshly started controversy on the Lord&#x27;s Supper. As the statement &quot;good works are necessary for salvation&quot; appeared in the Leipzig Interim, in 1551 its Lutheran opponents attacked Georg Major, Melanchthon&#x27;s friend and disciple. Melanchthon dropped the formula altogether, seeing how easily it could be misunderstood.

His opponents continued to go against him, accusing him of synergism and Zwinglianism. At the Colloquy of Worms in 1557 which he had reluctantly attended, the adherents of Flacius and the Saxon theologians tried to humiliate him as a heretic. Melanchthon persevered in his efforts for the peace of the church, suggesting a synod of the Evangelical party and drawing up the Frankfurt Recess, which he defended later against attacks.

The controversies on the Lord&#x27;s Supper embittered the last years of his life. The renewal of this dispute was due to the growing acceptance of Calvinistic doctrine and its influence upon Germany. He never agreed with this, and the personal presence and self-impartation of Christ in the Lord&#x27;s Supper were especially important for him, although he did not definitely state how body and blood are related to this. Although rejecting the physical act of mastication, he nevertheless assumed the real presence of the body of Christ and therefore also a real self-impartation. He also differed from Calvin in emphasizing the relation of the Lord&#x27;s Supper to justification.

==Views on the Virgin Mary==
Melanchthon viewed any veneration of saints rather critically but he developed positive commentaries about Mary.

In his &quot;Annotations in Evangelia&quot;, he wrote a study on Luke 2:52, and discussed Mary&#x27;s faith. He noted that &quot;she kept all things in her heart&quot; which to him was a call to the church to follow her example. He believed that Mary was negligent when she lost her son in the temple, but she did not sin. He also believed that Mary was conceived with original sin like every other human being, but she was spared the consequences of it. As such, he opposed the feast of the Immaculate Conception, which at the time, was not dogma, but was celebrated in several cities and had been approved at the Council of Basel in 1439. He declared that the Immaculate Conception was an invention of monks. He saw Mary as a representation (Typus) of the church and believed that in the Magnificat, Mary spoke for the whole church. Standing under the cross, Mary suffered like no other human being; as such, he believed that Christians have to unite with her under the cross, in order to become Christ-like.

==Views on natural philosophy==
In lecturing on the &quot;Librorum de judiciis astrologicis&quot; of Ptolemy in 1535–1536, Melanchthon expressed to students his interest in Greek mathematics, astronomy and astrology. He considered that a purposeful God had reasons to exhibit comets and eclipses. He was the first to print a paraphrased edition of Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Tetrabiblos&quot; in Basel, 1554. Natural philosophy, in his view, was directly linked to Providence, a point of view that was influential in curriculum change after the Protestant Reformation in Germany. In the period 1536-1539 he was involved in three academic innovations: the refoundation of Wittenberg along Protestant lines, the reorganization at Tübingen, and the foundation of the University of Leipzig.

==Death==

Before these theological dissensions were settled, Melanchthon died. Only a few days before his death, he had written a note which gave his reasons for not fearing death. On the left hand side of the note were the words, &quot;You will be delivered from sins, and be freed from the acrimony and fury of theologians&quot;; on the right, &quot;You will go to the light, see God, look upon his Son, learn those wonderful mysteries which you have not been able to understand in this life.&quot; The immediate cause of death was a severe cold which he had contracted on a journey to Leipzig in March 1560, followed by a fever that consumed his strength, although his body had already been weakened. He was pronounced dead on 19 April 1560. His body was buried beside Luther&#x27;s in the Schloßkirche in Wittenberg.

In Melanchthon&#x27;s last moments, he continued to worry over the desolate condition of the church. He prayed continually and listened to passages of Scripture. The words of &quot;John 1:11-12&quot; were especially significant to him - &quot;His own received him not; but as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God.&quot; When Caspar Peucer, his son-in-law, asked him if he wanted anything, he replied, &quot;Nothing but heaven.&quot;

He is commemorated in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod on 16 February, his birthday, and in the calendar of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 25 June, the date of the presentation of the Augsburg Confession.

==Estimation of his works and character==
===Relationship with Luther===

Melanchthon&#x27;s importance for the Reformation lay essentially in the fact that he systematized Luther&#x27;s ideas, defended them in public, and made them the basis of a religious education. These two figures, by complementing each other, could be said to have harmoniously achieved the results of the Reformation. Melanchthon was impelled by Luther to work for the Reformation; his own inclinations would have kept him in academia. Without Luther&#x27;s influence he could have been &quot;a second Erasmus&quot;, although he had a deep religious interest in the Reformation. While Luther scattered the sparks among the people, Melanchthon had the sympathy of educated people and scholars. Both Luther&#x27;s strength of faith and Melanchthon&#x27;s calmness, temperance and love of peace, had a share in the success of the movement.

Both were aware of their mutual position and they thought of it as a “divine necessity”. Melanchthon wrote in 1520, &quot;I would rather die than be separated from Luther&quot;, whom he also compared to Elijah, and called him &quot;the man full of the Holy Ghost&quot;. In spite of the strained relations between them in the last years of Luther&#x27;s life, Melanchthon said at Luther&#x27;s death, &quot;Dead is the horseman and chariot of Israel who ruled the church in this last age of the world!&quot;
In the preface to Melanchthon&#x27;s &quot;Kolosserkommentar&quot; (1529), Luther wrote, &quot;I had to fight with rabble and devils, for which reason my books are very warlike. I am the rough pioneer who must break the road; but Master Philip comes along softly and gently, sows and waters heartily, since God has richly endowed him with gifts.&quot; Luther also praised Melanchthon&#x27;s revised &quot;Loci&quot; and called him &quot;a divine instrument which has achieved the very best in the department of theology to the great rage of the devil and his scabby tribe.&quot; Luther never spoke directly against Melanchthon. However often he was dissatisfied with Melanchthon&#x27;s actions, he never uttered a word against his private character, although Melanchthon sometimes evinced a lack of confidence in Luther. In a letter to Carlowitz, before the Diet of Augsburg, he protested that Luther, with his hot-headed nature, exercised a personally humiliating pressure upon him.

The distinction between Luther and Melanchthon is well brought out in Luther&#x27;s letters to the latter (June 1530):
===His work as reformer===

As a reformer, Melanchthon&#x27;s work was characterized by moderation, conscientiousness, caution, and love of peace; however these qualities were sometimes said to only be lack of decision, consistence, and courage. His main priority was for the welfare of the community and for the quiet development of the church.

Melanchthon had an innate aversion to quarrels and discord; yet, often he was very irritable. His irenical character often led him to adapt himself to the views of others, as may be seen from his correspondence with Erasmus and from his public attitude from the Diet of Augsburg to the Interim. It was said not to be merely a personal desire for peace, but his conservative religious nature that guided him in his acts of conciliation. He never could forget that his father on his death-bed had besought his family &quot;never to leave the church.&quot; He stood toward the history of the church in an attitude of piety and reverence that made it much more difficult for him than for Luther to be content with the thought of the impossibility of a reconciliation with the Catholic Church. He laid stress upon the authority of the Church Fathers, not only of Augustine, but also of the Greek Fathers.

His attitude in matters of worship was conservative, and in the Leipsic Interim he was said by Cordatus and Schenk even to be Crypto-Catholic. He did not look for a reconciliation with Catholicism at the price of pure doctrine. He attributed more value to the external appearance and organization of the Church than Luther did, as can be seen from his treatment of the &quot;doctrine of the church&quot;. The ideal conception of the church, which he expressed in &quot;Loci&quot; in 1535, later lost its prominence when he began to emphasize the conception of the true visible church as it may be found among the Protestants.

He believed that the relation of the church to God was that the church held the divine office of the ministry of the Gospel. The universal priesthood was for Melanchthon as for Luther no principle of an ecclesiastical constitution, but a purely religious principle. In accordance with this idea he tried to keep the traditional church constitution and government, including the bishops. He did not want, however, a church altogether independent of the state, but rather, in agreement with Luther, he believed it the duty of the secular authorities to protect religion and the church. He looked upon the consistories as ecclesiastical courts which therefore should be composed of spiritual and secular judges, as he believed that the official authority of the church did not lie in a special class of priests, but rather in the whole congregation, to be represented therefore not only by ecclesiastics, but also by laymen. In advocating church union he did not overlook differences in doctrine for the sake of common practical tasks.

The older he grew, the less he distinguished between the Gospel as the announcement of the will of God, and right doctrine as the human knowledge of it. He took pains to safeguard unity in doctrine by theological formulas of union, but these were made as broad as possible and were restricted to the needs of practical religion.
===As scholar===
As a scholar Melanchthon embodied the spiritual culture of his age. His writing was simple and clear; his manuals, even if they were not always original, were quickly introduced into schools and kept their place for more than a century. For him, knowledge existed only for the service of moral and religious education, and so the teacher of Germany prepared the way for the religious thoughts of the Reformation. He was an important figure in the movement known as Christian humanism, which exerted a lasting influence upon scientific life in Germany.

Melanchthon wrote many treatises on education and learning that present some of his views on the basis, method, and goal of reformed education. In his &quot;Book of Visitation&quot;, Melanchthon outlines a school plan that recommends schools to teach Latin only. He suggests children should be broken up into three distinct groups: children who are learning to read, children who know how to read and are ready to learn grammar, and children who are well-trained in grammar and syntax. Melanchthon also believed that the disciplinary system of the classical &quot;seven liberal arts&quot;, and the sciences studied in the higher faculties could not encompass the new revolutionary discoveries of the age in terms of either content or method. He expanded the traditional categorization of science in several directions, incorporating not only history, geography and poetry but also the new natural sciences in his system of scholarly disciplines.

===As theologian===
As a theologian, his strength lay in collecting and systematizing the ideas of others, especially of Luther, for the purpose of instruction. He kept to the practical, and did not look at the connection of the parts, and his &quot;Loci&quot; were in the form of isolated paragraphs. His humanistic mode of thought formed the basis of his theology so that he acknowledged moral and religious truths outside of Christianity, and brought Christian truth into closer contact with them, to mediate between Christian revelation and ancient philosophy.

Melanchthon&#x27;s views differed from Luther&#x27;s only in some modifications of ideas. Melanchthon looked upon the law as not only the correlate of the Gospel, but as the unchangeable order of the spiritual world with its basis in God himself. He distilled Luther&#x27;s view of redemption to that of legal satisfaction. He did not focus on the mysticism running through Luther&#x27;s theology, but emphasized the ethical and intellectual elements.

After giving up determinism and absolute predestination and ascribing a certain moral freedom to humanity, he tried to ascertain the share of free will in conversion, naming three causes as concurring in the work of conversion - the Word, the Spirit, and the human will, which was not passive, but resisting its own weakness. After 1548 he used Erasmus&#x27; definition of freedom, &quot;the capability of applying oneself to grace.&quot; 

In dividing faith into knowledge, assent, and trust, he made the participation of the heart subsequent to that of the intellect, which gave rise to the view of the later orthodoxy that the establishment and acceptation of pure doctrine should precede the personal attitude of faith. His conception of faith corresponded with his view that the Church is the communion of those who adhere to the true belief and that her visible existence depends upon the consent of her unregenerated members to her teachings.

Melanchthon&#x27;s doctrine of the Lord&#x27;s Supper lacked the mysticism of faith by which Luther united the sensual elements and supersensual realities. It did however demand their formal distinction.

The development of Melanchthon&#x27;s beliefs may be seen from the history of the &quot;Loci&quot;. Originally he intended a development of the leading ideas representing the Evangelical conception of salvation, while the later editions approached a plan of a text-book of dogma. At first he insisted on the necessity of every event, rejected the philosophy of Aristotle, and had not fully developed his doctrine of the sacraments. In 1535 he treated for the first time the doctrine of God and that of the Trinity; he rejected the doctrine of the necessity of every event and named free will as a concurring cause in conversion. The doctrine of justification received its forensic form and the necessity of good works was emphasized in the interest of moral discipline. The last editions are distinguished from the earlier ones by the prominence given to the theoretical and rational element.

===As moralist===
In ethics he preserved and renewed the tradition of ancient morality and represented the Protestant conception of life. His books on morals were chiefly drawn from the classics, and were influenced not so much by Aristotle as by Cicero. His principal works in this line were &quot;Prolegomena&quot; to Cicero&#x27;s &quot;De officiis&quot; (1525); &quot;Enarrationes librorum Ethicorum Aristotelis&quot; (1529); &quot;Epitome philosophiae moralis&quot; (1538); and &quot;Ethicae doctrinae elementa&quot; (1550).

In his &quot;Epitome philosophiae moralis&quot; he considers the relation of philosophy to the law of God and the Gospel. Moral principles are knowable in the light of reason. Melanchthon calls these the law of God, and being endowed in human nature by God, so also the law of nature. The virtuous pagans had not yet developed the ideas of Original Sin and the Fall, or the fallen aspect of human nature itself, and so could not articulate or explain why humans did not always act virtuously. If virtue was the true law of human nature (having been put there by God himself) than the light of reason could only be darkened by sin. The revealed law, necessitated because of sin, is distinguished from natural law only by its greater completeness and clearness. The fundamental order of moral life can be grasped also by reason; therefore the development of moral philosophy from natural principles must not be neglected. Melanchthon therefore made no sharp distinction between natural and revealed morals.

His contribution to Christian ethics in the proper sense can be seen in the Augsburg Confession and its Apology as well as in his &quot;Loci&quot;, where he followed Luther in depicting the Protestant ideal of life, the free realization of the divine law by a personality blessed in faith and filled with the spirit of God.
===As exegete===
Melanchthon&#x27;s formulation of the authority of Scripture became the norm for some time. The principle of his hermeneutics is expressed in his words: &quot;Every theologian and faithful interpreter of the heavenly doctrine must necessarily be first a grammarian, then a dialectician, and finally a witness.&quot; By &quot;grammarian&quot; he meant the philologist who is master of history, archaeology, and ancient geography. For the method of interpretation, he insisted on the unity of the sense and upon the literal sense in contrast to the four senses of the scholastics. He further stated that whatever is looked for in the words of Scripture, outside of the literal sense, is only dogmatic or practical application.

His commentaries are full of theological and practical matter, confirming the doctrines of the Reformation. The most important are those on Genesis, Proverbs, Daniel, the Psalms, Romans (edited in 1522 against his will by Luther), Colossians (1527), and John (1523). Melanchthon worked with Luther in his translation of the Bible, and both the books of the Maccabees in Luther&#x27;s Bible are ascribed to him. A Latin Bible published in 1529 at Wittenberg is designated as a joint work of Melanchthon and Luther.

===As historian and preacher===

Melanchthon&#x27;s influence in historical theology was felt until the seventeenth century, especially in the method of treating church history in connection with political history. His was the first Protestant attempt at a history of dogma with both &quot;Sententiae veterum aliquot patrum de caena domini&quot; (1530) and &quot;De ecclesia et auctoritate verbi Dei&quot; (1539).

Melanchthon exerted a wide influence in homiletics, and has been regarded in the Protestant church as the author of the methodical style of preaching. He stayed aloof from dogmatizing or rhetoric in the &quot;Annotationes in Evangelia&quot; (1544), the &quot;Conciones in Evangelium Matthaei&quot; (1558), and in his German sermons prepared for George of Anhalt. He never preached from the pulpit and his Latin sermons &quot;(Postilla)&quot; were prepared for the Hungarian students at Wittenberg who did not understand German.

In 1548 he published the &quot;History of the Life and Acts of Luther&quot;. In this book, he includes the image of Luther nailing the 95 Theses to the Door of Castle Church in Wittenberg. However, he had not met Luther at this time and Luther himself never mentioned this event.

Melanchthon also produced the first Protestant work on the method of theological study, as well as his &quot;Catechesis puerilis&quot; (1532), a religious manual for younger students, and a German catechism (1549).

===As professor and philosopher===
As a philologist and pedagogue Melanchthon was the spiritual heir of the South German Humanists, such as Reuchlin, Jakob Wimpfeling, and Rodolphus Agricola, who represented an ethical conception of the humanities. He saw the liberal arts and a classical education as paths, not only towards natural and ethical philosophy, but also towards divine philosophy. The ancient classics were seen as the sources of a purer knowledge, and also the best means of educating the youth both by their beauty of form and by their ethical content. By his activity in educational institutions and his compilations of Latin and Greek grammars and commentaries, he became the founder of the learned schools of Evangelical Germany, using a combination of humanistic and Christian ideals. The influence of his philosophical compendia ended only with the rule of the Leibniz–Wolff school.

He came to Wittenberg with the plan of editing the complete works of Aristotle and he edited the &quot;Rhetoric&quot; (1519) and the &quot;Dialectic&quot; (1520).

He believed that the relation of philosophy to theology is characterized by the distinction between Law and Gospel. The former, as a light of nature, is innate; it also contains the elements of the natural knowledge of God which, however, have been obscured and weakened by sin. Therefore, renewed promulgation of the Law by revelation became necessary and was furnished in the Decalogue; and all law, including that in the form of natural philosophy, contains only demands, shadowings; its fulfillment is given only in the Gospel, the object of certainty in theology, by which also the philosophical elements of knowledge - experience, principles of reason, and syllogism - receive only their final confirmation. As the law is a divinely ordered pedagogue that leads to Christ, philosophy, its interpreter, is subject to revealed truth as the principal standard of opinions and life.

He published &quot;De dialecta libri iv&quot; (1528), &quot;Erotemata dialectices&quot; (1547), &quot;Liber de anima&quot; (1540), &quot;Initia doctrinae physicae&quot; (1549), and &quot;Ethicae doctrinae elementa&quot; (1550).

===Personal appearance and character===

There have been preserved original portraits of Melanchthon by three famous painters of his time - Hans Holbein the Younger with one version in the Royal Gallery of Hanover, Albrecht Dürer and Lucas Cranach the Elder. Melanchthon was described as being dwarfish, misshapen, and physically weak, although he is said to have had a bright and sparkling eye, which kept its colour till the day of his death.

He did not value money and possessions; his hospitality was often misused in such a way that his Swabian servant sometimes had difficulty in managing the household. His domestic life was happy. He called his home &quot;a little church of God&quot;, always found peace there, and showed a tender solicitude for his wife and children. A French scholar once found him rocking the cradle with one hand, and holding a book in the other.

His closest friend was Joachim Camerarius, whom he called the half of his soul. His extensive correspondence forms a commentary on his life. He wrote speeches and scientific treatises for others, permitting them to use their own signatures. He acknowledged his faults even to opponents like Flacius, and was open to criticism. He laid great stress upon prayer, daily meditation on the Bible, and attendance of public service.

<text>Albury-Wodonga is the broad settlement incorporating the twin Australian cities of Albury and Wodonga, which are separated geographically by the Murray River and politically by a state border: Albury on the north of the river is part of New South Wales, while Wodonga on the south bank is in Victoria.


In the early 1970s, Albury-Wodonga was selected as the primary focus of the Whitlam Federal Labor government&#x27;s scheme to arrest the uncontrolled growth of Australia&#x27;s large metropolitan areas (in particular Sydney and Melbourne) by encouraging decentralisation. The National Urban Growth Centres initiative, which was Australia’s closest attempt to replicate the &#x27;New Towns&#x27; strategy of post-war European models, had grand plans to turn Albury–Wodonga into a major inland city. Albury–Wodonga, it was said, was &#x27;central to the most ambitious plan for deliberate Commonwealth government intervention in regional development since the founding of Canberra as the National Capital&#x27;.

Embarking on what was deemed &#x27;an exciting adventure&#x27;, the Albury-Wodonga pilot scheme involved three governments—the Commonwealth, NSW and Victoria. On 25 January 1973 the Premier of New South Wales, Sir Robert Askin, the Premier of Victoria, Rupert Hamer and the Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam signed the initial agreement for the accelerated development of Albury-Wodonga. According to some, it was a unique cross-border agreement that illustrated a &#x27;spirit of cooperative federalism&#x27;.

Under Whitlam’s newly established Department of Urban and Regional Development (DURD), the ambition to decentralise Australia and promote new growth centres was further demonstrated in the budget allocations of 1973/4 and 1974/75—a provision of $33 million and $223 million for urban growth centres consecutively. In 1973/74, $9 million of the $33 million was allocated to the urban growth centre of Albury–Wodonga. The remaining $24 million was distributed between six other nominated growth centres.

However, due to the subsequent Fraser Government&#x27;s repudiation of Labor&#x27;s decentralisation policies, the plan to populate inland areas and cities other than the State capitals was abandoned. No other Commonwealth Government since, either Coalition or Labor, has made any attempt at repopulating inland areas. Thus the current Albury–Wodonga population is far below the 300,000 projected by Gough Whitlam in the 1970s.

The population increased by 1.1% per year on average from 81,540 in 2008 to 86,274 in 2013. Further increasing to 89,007 by the 2016 census, giving an average annual growth rate of 1.04%.

In the 2021 census, Albury-Wodonga had a population of 97,793. As of 2023, the Albury-Wodonga website describes it as having a combined population around 100,000 residents and being Australia&#x27;s 20th largest city. The website Invest Albury Wodonga claims that the city has reached a population milestone and sustainable population tipping point by having 250,000 people within 100km of Albury-Wodonga.

== Albury–Wodonga&#x27;s National Growth Centre Experience ==
Albury–Wodonga’s national growth centre experience derived from Australia’s decentralisation processes in the post-war era. Australia, at the time was seen to be borrowing the idea from British town and country planning which had developed from the Garden City concept. The &#x27;New Towns&#x27; approach, as it was known, was a popular form of planning used in 1940–50’s UK to aid national decentralisation. The main features of the concept were the strengthening of neighbourhoods and civic centres, development of industrial zones and greenbelts. Meanwhile, in Australia, some began to term the new development as &#x27;satellite towns&#x27; and emphasised the improved conditions around housing, more open spaces and easier access to the countryside. Soon after, elements of the &#x27;new towns&#x27; could be found in metropolitan planning strategies in Australian cities such as Canberra and Elizabeth.

By the 1970’s the concept was adopted by the Whitlam government who took up the idea as a national urban development policy, and nominated a range of cities to be affected, some pre-existing (Albury–Wodonga, Bathurst-Orange) and others to be developed (Monarto). 
Both the Commonwealth and State governments were involved in the strategies to accelerate the growth of Albury–Wodonga. Together they established the Albury–Wodonga Development Corporation which held mandates for local land development, economic and community planning and reafforestation and for the overall implementation of the project.

=== Strategies for relocation ===

From a Commonwealth perspective there was a desire to relocate public servants from larger cities such as Canberra and Sydney to Albury–Wodonga due to concerns around rising costs in highly populated urban areas. Further support came from the AWDC who, in turn, offered high standard rental housing and support for key transferred public servants and developed an innovative newcomer program to help those transferred and their families. Despite these efforts, a high-level of public service relocation did not take place. However, Albury–Wodonga was, successful in establishing an Australia Tax Office bureau and today still has a large number of defence jobs as a result of a major logistics centre development and training school set up by the federal government.

Universities and corporate decentralisation were also seen as a way to grow a prosperous urban area. The establishment of a university would not only increase the number of jobs but also expand the occupational breadth in the workforce. A university would provide access to tertiary education for rural and regional students and limit the loss of local school leavers from the region.

Similarly, attracting private enterprise was used as a mechanism to accelerate growth. Thus the AWDC developed an economic strategy focussed on the strengthening of distribution and manufacturing services in the region. Albury–Wodonga was to become a regional distribution hub. Moreover, the AWDC enticed new businesses to relocate by providing rental start-up factories, rental housing for employees and promoting the child-care and education facilities already available. To attract larger private enterprises (for example Mars Petcare and the Newsprint Mill at Ettamogah) the state and Commonwealth governments intervened, enforcing provisions such a social housing for employees, to help accelerate growth.

Furthermore, similar to other places that fell under the &#x27;New Towns&#x27; strategy, retaining green space was important for the Albury–Wodonga growth centre. In and around the area, the AWDC planted approximately 3 million trees and shrubs, becoming one of Australia’s biggest urban re-afforestation programs. Today Albury–Wodonga continues to exercise environmental leadership through various sustainability initiatives.

<text>Bangers and mash or sausages and mash is a traditional British dish consisting of sausages and mashed potato. The dish is usually served with onion gravy, but may also include fried onions and peas.
This dish, even when cooked at home, may be thought of as an example of pub grub, meaning it is relatively quick and easy to make in large quantities.

In 2009, the dish was listed as Britain&#x27;s most popular comfort food in a survey commissioned by TV channel &quot;Good Food&quot;.

==Etymology==
Although it is sometimes stated that the term &quot;banger&quot; has its origins in World War II, it is recorded in use at least as far back as 1919. The term is said to have originated from the fact that sausages produced during the meat rationing of World War I were made with such a high water content that they were liable to explode when cooked.

<doc id="39217" wikidata="Q3776296" url="?curid=39217" title="Donnybrook, Dublin">
<text>Donnybrook () is a district of Dublin, Ireland, on the southside of the city, in the Dublin 4 postal district. It is home to the Irish public service broadcaster Raidió Teilifís Éireann (RTÉ) and was once part of the Pembroke Township. Its neighbouring suburbs are Ballsbridge, Sandymount, Ranelagh and Clonskeagh.

Donnybrook is also a civil parish mainly situated in the old barony of Dublin.

==History==

Donnybrook Fair dates from a charter of King John of England in 1204 and was held annually until 1855. It began as a fair for livestock and agricultural produce but later declined, growing into more of a carnival and funfair. Drunkenness, fighting, and hasty marriages became commonplace and the people of Donnybrook were anxious that it should cease. Eventually, the fair&#x27;s reputation for tumult was its undoing. From the 1790s on, there were campaigns against the drunken brawl the fair had become. After a good deal of local fundraising, the patent was bought by a group of prominent residents and clergy, bringing about its demise. The Fair took place on lands now occupied by Donnybrook Rugby Ground and the Ever Ready Garage. The word &quot;donnybrook&quot; has since entered the English language to describe a rowdy brawl.

===Donnybrook castle===

Donnybrook Castle was an Elizabethan mansion and residence of the Ussher family. James Ussher was appointed Archbishop of Armagh in the Church of Ireland by Queen Elizabeth I of England. The mansion was demolished in 1759 and later replaced in 1795 by the existing Georgian house. It is now occupied by the Religious Sisters of Charity.

===Donnybrook cemetery===
Donnybrook Cemetery dates back to the 8th century and was once the location of a church founded by St Broc. It was also the site of Catholic and Church of Ireland churches, both called St Mary&#x27;s. Those buried in it include Dr Bartholomew Mosse, the founder of the Rotunda Hospital, Sir Edward Lovett Pearce, architect of the Irish Houses of Parliament on College Green and Dr Richard Madden, biographer of the United Irishmen. It is possible that the wall on the south side of the cemetery is the oldest man-made structure still existing in Donnybrook. The brick chimney behind the cemetery was built on the site of a former marble works and later served as a Magdalene laundry. Two ancestors of Meghan Markle, Mary McCue and Thomas Bird, an English soldier, were married at St Mary&#x27;s Church of Ireland church, Donnybrook, in 1860.

==Geography==
The river Dodder runs through Donnybrook and at one time there was a ford here. It is subject to periodic serious flooding and in 1628 one of the Usshers of Donnybrook Castle drowned while trying to cross.

===Civil parish===
Donnybrook is a civil parish consisting of sixteen townlands. All but four of these townlands are situated in the Barony of Dublin. Donnybrook is the single biggest parish in that barony. The most southerly townlands, Annefield, Simmonscourt and Priesthouse, belong to the barony of Rathdown. The smallest of these, Annefield, is itself an enclave of Simmonscourt which gives its name to a pavilion of the Royal Dublin Society. Today, the majority of Priesthouse is occupied by Elm Park Golf Club and the studios of RTÉ. The remaining townland of Sallymount - the parish&#x27;s most westerly point - is in the barony of Uppercross.

==Donnybrook today==
The television and radio studios of the national broadcaster, RTÉ, are located in Priesthouse, Donnybrook. There is also a large Dublin Bus garage located in the area.

<text>Ballsbridge () (from historic Ball&#x27;s Bridge) is an affluent neighbourhood of the city of Dublin, the capital of Ireland. The area is largely situated north and west of a three-arch stone bridge across the River Dodder, on the south side of the city. The sign on the bridge still proclaims it as &quot;Ball&#x27;s Bridge&quot;, in recognition of the fact that the original bridge on that location was built and owned by the Ball family, a well-known Dublin merchant family in the 1500s and the 1600s. The current bridge was built in 1791.

Ballsbridge was once part of the Pembroke Township.

==History==
18th-century maps show that the area of Dublin that is now Ballsbridge was originally mud flats and marsh, with many roads converging on a small village located around the bridge, and known already as Ballsbridge. Situated on the Dodder, this village had a ready source of power for small industries, including by the 1720s, a linen and cotton printers, and, by the 1750s, a paper mill and a gunpowder factory.

The land around Ballsbridge was rural and mostly belonged to the Earl of Pembroke. After the Royal Dublin Society (RDS) moved into its present site near Ballsbridge in 1879, the Earl of Pembroke began to develop these lands into suburban residential housing. The RDS held their first show on their new premises in the early 1880s. In 1903, the land formerly known as the &#x27;Forty Acres&#x27; was given to the city by the Earl of Pembroke to establish Herbert Park.(The Earl of Pembroke&#x27;s surname was Herbert.)

Until 1965, there was a well-known botanical garden on Landsdowne Road near Ballsbridge. The garden belonged to Trinity College, which had leased land from the Earl of Pembroke. In 1960, the original lease from the Pembroke Estate expired and was not renewed. After reducing their size considerably, Trinity decided, in 1965, to close the botanical gardens at that location and to open a new garden at Dartry. Two hotels now stand on the site.

In 1916, the Mount Street bridge, which spans the Grand Canal at the foot of Northumberland Road, was the site of an important battle during the Easter Rising. The O&#x27;Rahilly, one of the leaders of the Rising, lived at 40 Herbert Park. Another resistance leader, Eoin MacNeill, who refused to participate in the Rising, lived down the road at 19 Herbert Park.

==Popular culture==
The date of 16 June 1904, now commemorated as Bloomsday, was chosen by the writer James Joyce for the setting of his novel Ulysses because it was the date on which he lost his virginity to his girlfriend Nora Barnacle - Joyce was renting a room at the time in a house at 60 Shelbourne Road.

In the 1940s and 50s, the writer Brendan Behan lived in Ballsbridge, as did the poet Patrick Kavanagh, who lived at 62 Pembroke Road. Busts of Behan and Kavanagh are on display at two pubs along Pembroke Road, Searson&#x27;s and the Wellington. Kavanagh wrote his famous poem On Raglan Road about a girl he met on that street in 1944.

==Buildings, structures and parks==
The bridge itself forms the heart of the Ballsbridge suburb which extends northwards towards the Grand Canal along Northumberland Road up to Haddington Road and Shelbourne Road, southwards along the Merrion Road towards Merrion and along Anglesea Road towards Donnybrook, and westwards to encompass the area around Pembroke Road, Clyde Road, Elgin Road and Herbert Park. The bridge was extensively modernised and widened by 24 feet in 1900 by William Kaye-Parry.

Herbert Park, a public park, is thirty-two acres in size and is divided by a road, also called Herbert Park, and forms part of Ballsbridge&#x27;s nebulous border with Donnybrook.

The Royal Dublin Society (RDS) has its grounds here, and the Lansdowne Road headquarters of the Irish Rugby Football Union (IRFU) is on the boundary between Ballsbridge and Irishtown. The corporate headquarters of Allied Irish Banks (AIB) are also located in Ballsbridge. The former Pembroke Town Hall is located to the immediate northwest of the RDS.

Ailesbury Road, along with adjacent Shrewsbury Road, contains the most expensive properties in Dublin, and the roads are featured in the Irish edition of the board game &quot;Monopoly&quot;. Shrewsbury Road was the sixth most expensive street in the world in 2007.

Many of Dublin&#x27;s embassies and diplomatic residences are located in the southern part of Ballsbridge on and around Ailesbury Road. The British, American, Italian, Spanish, Dutch and Israeli embassies are all located in the Ballsbridge area of Dublin.

The U.S. embassy, an iconic cylindrical building, is a major landmark in present-day Ballsbridge. It was designed in 1955 by John M. Johansen, Professor of Architecture at Yale University. The project was 9 years in incubation and the building was inaugurated in 1964.

Gurdwara Guru Nanak Darbar, the place of assembly and worship for the Irish Sikh community, is located on Serpentine Avenue. It is located on the site of the old Oscar Cinema which the community purchased in 1987.

==Transport==
The DART train passes nearby, stopping at Lansdowne Road (which is also frequently served by commuter services) and Sandymount stations.

Ballsbridge used to be served by the Dublin tramways 6, 7 and 8, and also served as the terminus for tram line 5 back when Ballsbridge was still known as Pembroke. The tram lines were closed throughout the 1930s and 1940s and the 6, 7 and 8 were the last to close, with all three ending on 9 July 1949.

Ballsbridge is serviced by the following bus routes: 
* 4 Ballymun to Monkstown
* 7 Cherrywood to Dublin
* 7a Loughlinstown to Dublin
* 18 Palmerstown to Sandymount
* 27X Clare Hall to Belfield

A number of services have been withdrawn due to Dublin Bus&#x27; &quot;Network Direct&quot; route restructuring programme.

<text>Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS, also written ISIS) is a routing protocol designed to move information efficiently within a computer network, a group of physically connected computers or similar devices. It accomplishes this by determining the best route for data through a packet switching network.

The IS-IS protocol is defined in ISO/IEC 10589:2002 as an international standard within the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference design. 

In 2005, IS-IS was called &quot;the &quot;de facto&quot; standard for large service provider network backbones&quot;.

== Description ==
IS-IS is an interior gateway protocol, designed for use within an administrative domain or network. This is in contrast to exterior gateway protocols, primarily Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), which is used for routing between autonomous systems.

IS-IS is a link-state routing protocol, operating by reliably flooding link state information throughout a network of routers. Each IS-IS router independently builds a database of the network&#x27;s topology, aggregating the flooded network information. Like the OSPF protocol, IS-IS uses Dijkstra&#x27;s algorithm for computing the best path through the network. Packets (datagrams) are then forwarded, based on the computed ideal path, through the network to the destination.

== History ==
The IS-IS protocol was developed by a team of people working at Digital Equipment Corporation as part of DECnet Phase V.

The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) published IS-IS in 1990, but that RFC was later retracted and marked as &quot;historic&quot; because it republished a draft rather than a final version of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard, causing confusion.

The protocol was standardized by ISO in 1992 as ISO 10589, for communication between network devices that are termed Intermediate Systems (as opposed to end systems or hosts) by the ISO. The purpose of IS-IS was to make the routing of datagrams possible using the ISO-developed OSI protocol stack called Connectionless-mode Network Service (CLNS).
IS-IS was developed at roughly the same time that the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF was developing a similar protocol called OSPF. IS-IS was later extended to support routing of &quot;datagrams&quot; in the Internet Protocol (IP), the network-layer protocol of the global Internet. This version of the IS-IS &quot;routing&quot; protocol was then called &quot;Integrated IS-IS&quot;.

== IS-IS terminology ==
In IS-IS world there is slightly different terminology which comes from ISO wording. Below is the ISO terminology and its counterpart which is widely used in standards and related documentation.

* Intermediate system - router
* Designated intermediate system - designated router
* End system - host
* Circuit - link
* Adjacency - neighborship

== Circuit types ==
Compared to OSPF, IS-IS has only two circuit types - broadcast (LAN) and P2P. Therefore, designs such as P2MP are unavailable in IS-IS.

== Packet types ==
IS-IS adjacency can be either broadcast or point-to-point.

; IS-IS Hello PDU (IIH) : The IS-IS hello packets needs to be exchanged periodically between 2 routers to establish adjacency. Based on the negotiation, one of them will be selected as DIS (Designated IS). This hello packet will be sent separately for Level-1 or Level-2. There are 3 IS-IS hello packets depending on the circuit type - 
:* LAN L1 (PDU type 15)
:* LAN L2 (PDU type 16)
:* P2P (PDU type 17). As can be seen, on point-to-point links there are no separate hello packets per level, while on broadcast links - there are. In IS-IS, compared to OSPF, hello timers do not need to match.
; Link State PDU (LSP) : This contains the actual route information. This LSP can contain many type–length–values (TLVs). LSP header is called LSP ID and consists of System ID, Pseudonode ID and Fragment ID. In example of LSP ID 1921.6820.0002.02-01
:* 1921.6820.0002 is System ID (that generated this LSP),
:* 02 is Pseudonode ID,
:* 01 is Fragment ID.
:If Pseudonode ID is equal to zero, then this is a real intermediate system. Any value different from zero means that this LSP is generated by DIS (Pseudonode).
:If LSP is too big, then it gets fragmented. In order to indicate this, Fragment ID is used. If Fragment ID is equal to zero, then no fragmentation has occurred.
; Complete Sequence Number PDU (CSNP) : This packet will be sent only by the DIS. By default, for every 10 seconds, CSNP packet will be transmitted by DIS. This will contain the list of LSP IDs along with sequence number and checksum.
; Partial Sequence Number PDU (PSNP) : If the router which receives CSNP packet finds some discrepancy in its own database, it will send an PSNP request asking the DIS to send specific LSP back to it.

== IS-IS addressing and NET ==
From regular TCP/IP world we are used to know that each Layer 3 interface (including loopback) has its own IPv4 or IPv6 address. The most important point is that loopback interface always stays up (unless deleted) compared to physical or logical interfaces.

Therefore, ISO chose a different approach - instead of assigning layer 3 address to each interface, single address is assigned to loopback interface, while other interfaces are considered as unnumbered. This single address is called NET (Network Entity Title).

On a single intermediate system there can be up to 3 NET addresses. This is useful during migration from one area to another.

NET consists of Area, System ID and NSEL. Area itself consists of AFI (Address Family Identifier) and Area ID.

Area can have variable length of 1 - 13 bytes, System ID is 6 bytes and NSEL - 1 byte.

Let&#x27;s check on an example NET of 49.0100.1921.6821.1138.00. Here,

* 49 is AFI, and in case of 49 it means &quot;private address space&quot;, similar to RFC1918 for IPv4.,
* 0100 is Area ID,
* 49.0100 is Area,
* 1921.6821.1138 is System ID,
* 00 is NSEL, which must be zero. If not zero, then no IS-IS adjacency is formed.

== Hostname resolution ==
Let&#x27;s imagine, that engineer examines L2 or L1 database, or needs to view a specific LSP. Each LSP has LSP ID, consisting of System ID, Pseudonode ID and Fragment ID. Because generally System ID is router&#x27;s loopback address, remembering which loopback address to which router is not always convenient.

Similar problem is observed in OSPF, when LSDB or specific LSA is checked - they are listed by Advertising router, which is actually an IP. In case of OSPF, in order to overcome difficulty of remembering router IPs or consulting with list, local DNS resolution can be configured. But as it might be understood, this is not very convenient and fast way, especially during troubleshooting ongoing issues.

IS-IS solves this problem in a very elegant manner - in each LSP there is TLV 137, which displays hostname of the originating router. By this means, all routers know hostnames of other routers in the level by examining LSPs. That&#x27;s why when viewing LSP in L2 or L1 database, they are displayed by hostname, not System ID.

On the other hand, if needed, hostnames and their matching System IDs can be easily seen from IS-IS which keeps their list.

== Areas and levels ==
In IS-IS there is concept of areas, but here it works differently from OSPF. First of all, in contrary to OSPF, in IS-IS area is terminated on router, not link. 

In IS-IS, backbone area consists of contiguous Level 2 routers. Level 1 areas can be thought as stub areas in OSPF, where very limited reachability information is available. L1/L2 routers act like area border routers (ABRs) between L1 routers and L2 routers by keeping two databases - L1 database and L2 database.

Here is very important role of L1/L2 router - if it is connected to L2 router in another area, then it sets ATT (ATTached bit) in its L1 LSP. L1 routers which receive this LSP (with ATT bit) add default route to originator of this LSP. This is different from OSPF, where ABR generates default route to stub area routers and sends it via LSA 3.

Another difference of router in L1 area in IS-IS from router in stub area in OSPF is that L1 router can inject external routes into area, which travels up to L1/L2 router. With that, it resembles NSSA area in OSPF (where you cannot have external routes from backbone area, but you can inject external routes to NSSA area which are then translated to regular LSA 5 external routes by NSSA ABRs). 

However, by default, external L1 routes are not injected from L1 to L2. This can be changed by policy on L1/L2 router, which accepts L1 external routes and originates them into L2. 

In case of OSPF, if at some moment it is needed to inject external routes into OSPF domain from stub area, this can be done only by changing area type from stub to NSSA. This will causes tearing down OSPF neighborship. In IS-IS, this happens hit-less, just by adding a new export policy under protocol.

== Attribute bits in LSPs ==
IS-IS LSPs contain specific information, encoded to Attribute block in LSP header, which is 8 bits long. Here are some of the important ones

* P bit - Partition repair bit, 8th bit, indicates if partitioned L1 area can be repaired (joined together) over L2 area. Modern deployments of IS-IS generally do not support partition repair function, therefore, it is not set.
* ATT bit - Attached bit, 7th - 4th bits, indicates if originating router is attached to another area. If these bits are set by L1/L2 router in its L1 LSP, then other routers in L1 area will automatically generate default route to the originator. Technically, there are 4 ATT bits, each of them responsible for Error, Expense, Delay and Default metrics. This was because when IS-IS was originally developed, it was assumed that routing protocol would support multiple topologies and separately calculate a separate SPF for each metric. Later, this was deprecated, therefore, modern IS-IS deployments when necessary, set only 4th bit (for default metric).
* OL bit - Overload bit, 3rd bit, indicates if the router is overloaded. If this bit is set, then this router is NOT used as transit. However, it will be still reachable. Overload bit can be set by router under heavy load or intentionally by engineer. Setting overload bit is an easy way to gracefully offload the router prior to maintenance which requires router reboot. After router reboots and is available, then overload bit can be cleared manually. Another implementation would be to wait for other dependent protocols (such as BGP) to fully establish neighborship, and only after that become transit. This is because IS-IS converges much faster compared to BGP and if the router becomes transit before BGP has fully converged, this could cause traffic blackholing. A good example would be PE router, running MPLS VPN with IS-IS and BGP. After PE boots, establishes IS-IS adjacency, establishes BGP neighborship with other routers, overload bit is cleared and this router joins MPLS VPN network.
* IS type bits - 2nd and 1st bits, indicate IS type of the originator. It can be L1 only, L2 only and L1/L2. If only first bit is set, then this is L1 only, if only second bit - L2 only, and if both bits are set - then this is L1/L2 router.

== Wide metrics ==
When IS-IS was initially introduced, TLVs for IS reachability (TLV 2) and IP reachability (TLVs 128 and 130) could have interface metric no more than 63 (6 bits) and total accumulated path metric of no more than 1023 (10 bits).

Obviously, nowadays with higher link speeds and more hops in the path it would be challenging to stay within these limits.

Therefore, 2 new TLVs - TLV 22 for Extended IS reachability and TLV 135 for Extended IP reachability - were introduced. With this, now link metric can be up to 16.7 million (24 bits) and total accumulated path metric can be up to 4 billion (32 bits).

Older style metric is therefore called narrow metrics, while new style metric - wide metrics. 

Wide metrics or narrow metrics can be set on level base.

== Adjacency formation ==
Compared to OSPF, in IS-IS rules and conditions of adjacency formation are much simpler and mainly depend on the router level.

* L1 router cannot form any adjacency with L2 router under any conditions.
* L1 router can form L1 adjacency with other L1 router if their areas match.
* L1 router can form L1 adjacency with L1/L2 router if their areas match.
* L2 router can form L2 adjacency with other L2 router regardless of their areas (they don&#x27;t need to match).
* L2 router can form only L2 adjacency with other L1/L2 router regardless of their areas (they don&#x27;t need to match).
* L1/L2 router can form both L2 and L1 adjacency with other L1/L2 router if their areas match.

== Broadcast segments and designated intermediate system ==
On broadcast networks IS-IS is prone to issue, similar to OSPF, when all routers on the broadcast segment need to form adjacency and exchange LSPs. Therefore, number of LSPs increase in square.

In order to overcome this issue, on each LAN segment a designated intermediate system (DIS) is elected. The router with the highest priority and System ID wins. But, if a new router shows up and has better priority or System ID, then it is elected as a new DIS.

Elected DIS router is a pseudonode, which uses resources (including System ID) of one real router. DIS describes adjacency between routers in the broadcast segment in hub-spoke manner, where DIS is the hub while other routers (including router, promoted to DIS) are spokes.

Pseudonode ID in LSPs, originated from DIS, always have Pseudonode ID field different from zero.

All routers on the LAN segment form adjacency with only DIS and exchanges LSPs with it. 

The function of DIS is to send periodic CSNPs on the LAN segment and reply to PSNPs from other routers. In case of DIS failure a new DIS will be elected in the segment. The role of DIS is not as critical as of DR in OSPF. That&#x27;s why there is no backup DIS (BDIS) elected in IS-IS compared to BDR in OSPF.

== Authentication ==
IS-IS supports both simple password and MD5 authentication types. In IS-IS, per-level or per-interface authentication is possible.

In addition, to protect from replay attack, IS-IS uses increasing Sequence number in IIH. 

== IPv6 support and multi-topology ==
Because IS-IS encapsulates its PDUs into Layer 2 frame, it does not depend on Layer 3 protocols, such as IPv4 or IPv6. This is different from OSPF, which uses IPv4. Therefore, when IPv6 came up, adding IPv6 support to OSPF would require re-writing the protocol. That is how OSPFv3 was created. 

In case of IS-IS, TLV 232 for IPv6 interface address and TLV 236 for IPv6 reachability were added to support IPv6. And of course, IPv6 needs to be enabled on the interface. 

In order to display supported Layer 3 protocols, also called NLPID (Network Layer Protocol ID), TLV 129 is used. Here, IPv4 has code of 0xCC, while IPv6 - 0x8E. 

There might be an issue, if IPv4 and IPv6 topologies do not overlap. This could happen due to misconfiguration or intentionally (if some routers between do not support IPv6). For this situations, multi-topology support is added to IS-IS. 

TLV 229 was added to display supported multi-topologies, such as IPv4 unicast and IPv6 unicast. 

If multi-topology is enabled, IS-IS will calculate separate SPF tree for IPv4 and IPv6. This means twice the resource usage, but from the other side, this prevents traffic blackholing. 

When multi-topology is enabled, then IS-IS will use TLV 222 for Multi-topology IS reachability, TLV 235 for Multi-topology IP reachability and TLV 236 for Multi-topology IPv6 reachability. 

== IS-IS path selection ==
Depending on the configuration, the router can have either L1, L2 or both L1/L2 databases, against which it runs SPF algorithm. 

But there can be situations, when IS-IS router has exactly the same prefix in different level databases, or external and internal. In order to choose best path in this situations, there is a very specific order, in which the route goes from the most preferred to the least preferred: 

* L1 intra-area with internal metric,
* L1 external with internal metric,
* L2 intra-area with internal metric,
* L2 external with internal metric,
* Inter-area (from L1 to L2) with internal metric,
* Inter-area external (from L1 to L2) with internal metric,
* Inter-area (from L2 to L1) with internal metric,
* Inter-area external (from L2 to L1) with internal metric,
* L1 external with external metric,
* L2 external with external metric,
* Inter-area external (from L1 to L2) with external metric,
* Inter-area external (from L2 to L1) with external metric.

== BFD support ==
IS-IS has Hello packets (IIH) which carry information about the router and are used to form adjacency. Another function of hello packets is to detect failure between routers. This can be problematic, if the routers are not directly connected to each other and there is some active equipment between them.

Technically, it is possible to lower hello and hold time intervals to detect failure faster, but this can put unnecessary stress to router. 

Instead of this, BFD can be used. Because BFD is running in data plane over UDP, it nearly does not impact main CPU. Also, BFD can provide sub-second failure detection.

== Other uses ==
IS-IS is also used as the control plane for IEEE 802.1aq Shortest Path Bridging (SPB). SPB allows for shortest-path forwarding in an Ethernet mesh network context utilizing multiple equal cost paths. This permits SPB to support large Layer 2 topologies, with fast convergence, and improved use of the mesh topology. Combined with this is single point provisioning for logical connectivity membership. IS-IS is therefore augmented with a small number of TLVs and sub-TLVs, and supports two Ethernet encapsulating data paths, 802.1ad Provider Bridges and 802.1ah Provider Backbone Bridges. SPB requires no state machine or other substantive changes to IS-IS, and simply requires a new Network Layer Protocol Identifier (NLPID) and set of TLVs. This extension to IS-IS is defined in the IETF proposed standard RFC 6329.

<text>Amaterasu Ōmikami (), often called Amaterasu for short, also known as Ōhirume no Muchi no Kami (), is the goddess of the sun in Japanese mythology. Often considered the chief deity (&quot;kami&quot;) of the Shinto pantheon, she is also portrayed in Japan&#x27;s earliest literary texts, the () and the (720 CE), as the ruler (or one of the rulers) of the heavenly realm Takamagahara and as the mythical ancestress of the Imperial House of Japan via her grandson Ninigi. Along with two of her siblings (the moon deity Tsukuyomi and the impetuous storm-god Susanoo) she ranks as one of the &quot;Three Precious Children&quot; (, ), the three most important offspring of the creator god Izanagi.

Amaterasu&#x27;s chief place of worship, the Grand Shrine of Ise in Ise, Mie Prefecture, is one of Shinto&#x27;s holiest sites and a major pilgrimage center and tourist spot. As with other Shinto &quot;kami&quot;, she is also enshrined in a number of Shinto shrines throughout Japan.

==Name==
The goddess is referred to as &quot;Amaterasu Ōmikami&quot; ( / ; historical orthography: , &quot;Amaterasu Ohomikami&quot;; Old Japanese: &quot;Amaterasu Opomi1kami2&quot;) in the , while the gives the following variant names:

*Ōhirume-no-Muchi (; Man&#x27;yōgana: ; hist. orthography: , &quot;Ohohirume-no-Muchi&quot;; Old Japanese: &quot;Opopi1rume1-no2-Muti&quot;)
*Amaterasu Ō(mi)kami (; hist. orthography: , &quot;Amaterasu Oho(mi)kami&quot;)
*Amaterasu Ōhirume no Mikoto ()
*Hi-no-Kami (; OJ: &quot;Pi1-no-Kami2&quot;)

&quot;Amaterasu&quot; is thought to derive from the verb (&quot;ama&quot; + &quot;teru&quot; ) combined with the honorific auxiliary verb &quot;-su&quot;, while &quot;Ōmikami&quot; means &#x27;great august deity&#x27; (&quot;ō&quot; + honorific prefix &quot;mi-&quot; + &quot;kami&quot;). Notably, &quot;Amaterasu&quot; in &quot;Amaterasu Ōmikami&quot; is not technically a name the same way &quot;Susanoo&quot; in &quot;Susa no O no Mikoto&quot; or &quot;Ōkuninushi&quot; in &quot;Ōkuninushi no Kami&quot; are. is an attributive verb form that modifies the noun after it, . This epithet is therefore, much more semantically transparent than most names recorded in the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, in that it means exactly what it means, without allusion, inference or etymological opacity, literally &#x27;The Great August Goddess Who Shines in Heaven&#x27;. This usage is analogous to the use of relative clauses in English, only different in that Japanese clauses are placed in front of the noun they modify. This is further exemplified by (1) an alternative epithet, (, ), which is a plain, non-honorific version of , (2) alternative forms of the verb used elsewhere, for example its continuative form () in the &quot;Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku&quot;, and (3) similar uses of attributive verb forms in certain epithets, such as Emperor Jimmu&#x27;s (, ). There are, still, certain verb forms that are treated as proper names, such as the terminal negative in &#x27;Ugayafukiaezu no Mikoto&#x27; (, )

Her other name, , is usually understood as meaning (cf. &quot;hiru&quot; , from &quot;hi&quot; + &quot;me&quot; ), though alternative etymologies such as (taking to mean ) or (suggested by Orikuchi Shinobu, who put forward the theory that Amaterasu was originally conceived of as the consort or priestess of a male solar deity) had been proposed. A possible connection with the name Hiruko (the child rejected by the gods Izanagi and Izanami and one of Amaterasu&#x27;s siblings) has also been suggested. To this name is appended the honorific , which is also seen in a few other theonyms such as &#x27;Ō(a)namuchi&#x27; or &#x27;Michinushi-no-Muchi&#x27; (an epithet of the three Munakata goddesses).

As the ancestress of the imperial line, the epithet (, ; also read as ) is also applied to Amaterasu in names such as Amaterasu Sume(ra) Ō(mi)kami (, also read as &#x27;Tenshō Kōtaijin&#x27;) and &#x27;Amaterashimasu-Sume(ra)-Ōmikami&#x27; ().

During the medieval and early modern periods, the deity was also referred to as &#x27;Tenshō Daijin&#x27; (the &quot;on&#x27;yomi&quot; of ) or &#x27;Amateru Ongami&#x27; (an alternate reading of the same).

The name &quot;Amaterasu Ōmikami&quot; has been translated into English in different ways. While a number of authors such as Donald Philippi rendered it as , Basil Hall Chamberlain argued (citing the authority of Motoori Norinaga) that it is more accurately understood to mean (because the auxiliary is merely honorific, not causative, such interpretation as would miss the mark), and accordingly translated it as . Gustav Heldt&#x27;s 2014 translation of the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, meanwhile, renders it as &quot;the great and mighty spirit Heaven Shining.&quot;

==Mythology==
===In classical mythology===
====Birth====
Both the () and the (720 CE) agree in their description of Amaterasu as the daughter of the god Izanagi and the elder sister of Tsukuyomi, the deity of the moon, and Susanoo, the god of storms and seas. The circumstances surrounding the birth of these three deities, known as the &quot;Three Precious Children&quot; (, ), however, vary between sources:

*In the , Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi and Susanoo were born when Izanagi went to &quot;[the plain of] Awagihara by the river-mouth of Tachibana in Himuka in [the island of] Tsukushi&quot; and bathed () in the river to purify himself after visiting Yomi, the underworld, in a failed attempt to rescue his deceased wife, Izanami. Amaterasu was born when Izanagi washed his left eye, Tsukuyomi was born when he washed his right eye, and Susanoo was born when he washed his nose. Izanagi then appoints Amaterasu to rule Takamagahara (the &quot;Plain of High Heaven&quot;), Tsukuyomi the night, and Susanoo the seas.
*The main narrative of the has Izanagi and Izanami procreating after creating the Japanese archipelago; to them were born (in the following order) Ōhirume-no-Muchi (Amaterasu), Tsukuyomi, the &#x27;leech-child&#x27; Hiruko, and Susanoo:

*A variant legend recorded in the &quot;Shoki&quot; has Izanagi begetting Ōhirume (Amaterasu) by holding a bronze mirror in his left hand, Tsukuyomi by holding another mirror in his right hand, and Susanoo by turning his head and looking sideways.
*A third variant in the &quot;Shoki&quot; has Izanagi and Izanami begetting the sun, the moon, Hiruko, and Susanoo, as in the main narrative. Their final child, the fire god Kagutsuchi, caused Izanami&#x27;s death (as in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;).
*A fourth variant relates a similar story to that found in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, wherein the three gods are born when Izanagi washed himself in the river of Tachibana after going to Yomi.

====Amaterasu and Tsukuyomi====
One of the variant legends in the &quot;Shoki&quot; relates that Amaterasu ordered her brother Tsukuyomi to go down to the terrestrial world (Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, the &quot;Central Land of Reed-Plains&quot;) and visit the goddess Ukemochi. When Ukemochi vomited foodstuffs out of her mouth and presented them to Tsukuyomi at a banquet, a disgusted and offended Tsukuyomi slew her and went back to Takamagahara. This act upset Amaterasu, causing her to split away from Tsukuyomi, thus separating night from day.

Amaterasu then sent another god, Ame-no-Kumahito (), who found various food-crops and animals emerging from Ukemochi&#x27;s corpse.

Amaterasu had the grains collected and sown for humanity&#x27;s use and, putting the silkworms in her mouth, reeled thread from them. From this began agriculture and sericulture.

This account is not found in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, where a similar story is instead told of Susanoo and the goddess Ōgetsuhime.

====Amaterasu and Susanoo====
When Susanoo, the youngest of the three divine siblings, was expelled by his father Izanagi for his troublesome nature and incessant wailing on account of missing his deceased mother Izanami, he first went up to Takamagahara to say farewell to Amaterasu. A suspicious Amaterasu went out to meet him dressed in male clothing and clad in armor, at which Susanoo proposed a trial by pledge (&quot;ukehi&quot;) to prove his sincerity. In the ritual, the two gods each chewed and spat out an object carried by the other (in some variants, an item they each possessed). Five (or six) gods and three goddesses were born as a result; Amaterasu adopted the males as her sons and gave the females – later known as the three Munakata goddesses – to Susanoo.
Susanoo, declaring that he had won the trial as he had produced deities of the required gender, then &quot;raged with victory&quot; and proceeded to wreak havoc by destroying his sister&#x27;s rice fields and defecating in her palace. While Amaterasu tolerated Susanoo&#x27;s behavior at first, his &quot;misdeeds did not cease, but became even more flagrant&quot; until one day, he bore a hole in the rooftop of Amaterasu&#x27;s weaving hall and hurled the &quot;heavenly piebald horse&quot; (, ), which he had flayed alive, into it. One of Amaterasu&#x27;s weaving maidens was alarmed and struck her genitals against a weaving shuttle, killing her. In response, a furious Amaterasu shut herself inside the Ame-no-Iwayato (, , also known as Ama-no-Iwato), plunging heaven and earth into total darkness.

The main account in the &quot;Shoki&quot; has Amaterasu wounding herself with the shuttle when Susanoo threw the flayed horse in her weaving hall, while a variant account identifies the goddess who was killed during this incident as Wakahirume-no-Mikoto (, ).

Whereas the above accounts identify Susanoo&#x27;s flaying of the horse as the immediate cause for Amaterasu hiding herself, yet another variant in the &quot;Shoki&quot; instead portrays it to be Susanoo defecating in her seat:
====The Heavenly Rock Cave====

After Amaterasu hid herself in the cave, the gods, led by Omoikane, the god of wisdom, conceived a plan to lure her out:

Inside the cave, Amaterasu is surprised that the gods should show such mirth in her absence. Ame-no-Uzume answered that they were celebrating because another god greater than her had appeared. Curious, Amaterasu slid the boulder blocking the cave&#x27;s entrance and peeked out, at which Ame-no-Koyane and Futodama brought out the mirror (the Yata-no-Kagami) and held it before her. As Amaterasu, struck by her own reflection (apparently thinking it to be the other deity Ame-no-Uzume spoke of), approached the mirror, Ame-no-Tajikarao took her hand and pulled her out of the cave, which was then immediately sealed with a straw rope, preventing her from going back inside. Thus was light restored to the world.

As punishment for his unruly conduct, Susanoo was then driven out of Takamagahara by the other gods. Going down to earth, he arrived at the land of Izumo, where he killed the monstrous serpent Yamata no Orochi to rescue the goddess Kushinadahime, whom he eventually married. From the serpent&#x27;s carcass Susanoo found the sword Ame-no-Murakumo-no-Tsurugi (, ), also known as Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi ( ), which he presented to Amaterasu as a reconciliatory gift.

====The subjugation of Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni====
After a time, Amaterasu and the primordial deity Takamimusubi (also known as Takagi-no-Kami) declared that Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, which was then being ruled over by Ōkuninushi (also known as Ō(a)namuchi), the descendant (&quot;Kojiki&quot;) or the son (&quot;Shoki&quot;) of Susanoo, should be pacified and put under the jurisdiction of their progeny, claiming it to be teeming with &quot;numerous deities which shone with a lustre like that of fireflies, and evil deities which buzzed like flies&quot;. Amaterasu ordered Ame-no-Oshihomimi, the firstborn of the five male children born during her contest with Susanoo, to go down to earth and establish his rule over it. However, after inspecting the land below, he deemed it to be in an uproar and refused to go any further. At the advice of Omoikane and the other deities, Amaterasu then dispatched another of her five sons, Ame no Hohi. Upon arriving, however, Ame no Hohi began to curry favor with Ōkuninushi and did not send back any report for three years. The heavenly deities then sent a third messenger, Ame-no-Wakahiko, who also ended up siding with Ōkuninushi and marrying his daughter Shitateruhime. After eight years, a female pheasant was sent to question Ame-no-Wakahiko, who killed it with his bow and arrow. The blood-stained arrow flew straight up to Takamagahara at the feet of Amaterasu and Takamimusubi, who then threw it back to earth with a curse, killing Ame-no-Wakahiko in his sleep.

The preceding messengers having thus failed to complete their task, the heavenly gods finally sent the warrior deities Futsunushi and Takemikazuchi to remonstrate with Ōkuninushi. At the advice of his son Kotoshironushi, Ōkuninushi agreed to abdicate and left the physical realm to govern the unseen spirit world, which was given to him in exchange. The two gods then went around Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni, killing those who resisted them and rewarding those who rendered submission, before going back to heaven.
With the earth now pacified, Amaterasu and Takamimusubi again commanded Ame-no-Oshihomimi to descend and rule it. He, however, again demurred and suggested that his son Ninigi be sent instead. Amaterasu thus bequeathed to Ninigi, the sword Susanoo gave her, along with the two items used to lure her out of the Ame-no-Iwayato: the mirror Yata-no-Kagami and the jewel Yasakani no Magatama. With a number of gods serving as his retinue, Ninigi came down from heaven to Mount Takachiho in the land of Himuka and built his palace there. Ninigi became the ancestor of the emperors of Japan, while the mirror, jewel, and sword he brought with him became the three sacred treasures of the imperial house. Five of the gods who accompanied him in his descent - Ame-no-Koyane, Futodama, Ame-no-Uzume, Ishikoridome (the maker of the mirror), and Tamanoya (the maker of the jewel) - meanwhile became the ancestors of the clans involved in court ceremonial such as the Nakatomi and the Inbe.

====Emperor Jimmu and the Yatagarasu====
Many years later, Ninigi&#x27;s great-grandson, Kamuyamato-Iwarebiko (later known as Emperor Jimmu), decided to leave Himuka in search of a new home with his elder brother Itsuse. Migrating eastward, they encountered various gods and local tribes who either submitted to them or resisted them. After Itsuse died of wounds sustained during a battle against a chieftain named Nagasunehiko, Iwarebiko retreated and went to Kumano, located on the southern part of the Kii Peninsula. While there, he and his army were enchanted by a god in the shape of a giant bear and fell into a deep sleep. At that moment, a local named Takakuraji had a dream in which Amaterasu and Takamimusubi commanded the god Takemikazuchi to help Iwarebiko. Takemikazuchi then dropped his sword, Futsu-no-Mitama, into Takakuraji&#x27;s storehouse, ordering him to give it to Iwarebiko. Upon waking up and discovering the sword inside the storehouse, Takakuraji went to where Iwarebiko was and presented it to him. The magic power of the Futsu-no-Mitama immediately exterminated the evil gods of the region and roused Iwarebiko and his men from their slumber.

Continuing their journey, the army soon found themselves stranded in the mountains. Takamimusubi (so the &quot;Kojiki&quot;) or Amaterasu (&quot;Shoki&quot;) then told Iwarebiko in a dream that the giant crow Yatagarasu would be sent to guide them in their way. Soon enough, the bird appeared and led Iwarebiko and his men to safety. At length, Iwarebiko arrived at the land of Yamato (modern Nara Prefecture) and defeated Nagasunehiko, thereby avenging his brother Itsuse. He then established his palace-capital at Kashihara and ruled therein.

====Enshrinement in Ise====
An anecdote concerning Emperor Sujin relates that Amaterasu (via the Yata-no-Kagami and the Kusanagi sword) and Yamato-no-Okunitama, the tutelary deity of Yamato, were originally worshipped in the great hall of the imperial palace. When a series of plagues broke out during Sujin&#x27;s reign, he &quot;dreaded [...] the power of these Gods, and did not feel secure in their dwelling together.&quot; He thus entrusted the mirror and the sword to his daughter , who brought them to the village of Kasanuhi, and she would become the first Saiō. and delegated the worship of Yamato-no-Okunitama to another daughter, Nunakiirihime. When the pestilence showed no sign of abating, he then performed divination, which revealed the plague to have been caused by Ōmononushi, the god of Mount Miwa. When the god was offered proper worship as per his demands, the epidemic ceased.

During the reign of Sujin&#x27;s son and successor, Emperor Suinin, custody of the sacred treasures were transferred from Toyosukiirihime to Suinin&#x27;s daughter Yamatohime, who took them first to &quot;Sasahata in Uda&quot; to the east of Miwa. Heading north to Ōmi, she then eastwards to Mino and proceeded south to Ise, where she received a revelation from Amaterasu:

This account serves as the origin myth of the Grand Shrine of Ise, Amaterasu&#x27;s chief place of worship.
Later, when Suinin&#x27;s grandson Prince Ousu (also known as Yamato Takeru) went to Ise to visit his aunt Yamatohime before going to conquer and pacify the eastern regions on the command of his father, Emperor Keikō, he was given the divine sword to protect him in times of peril. It eventually came in handy when Yamato Takeru was lured onto an open grassland by a treacherous chieftain, who then set fire to the grass to entrap him. Desperate, Yamato Takeru used the sword to cut the grass around him (a variant in the &quot;Shoki&quot; has the sword miraculously mow the grass of its own accord) and lit a counter-fire to keep the fire away. This incident explains the sword&#x27;s name (&quot;Grass Cutter&quot;). On his way home from the east, Yamato Takeru – apparently blinded by hubris – left the Kusanagi in the care of his second wife, Miyazuhime of Owari, and went to confront the god of Mount Ibuki on his own. Without the sword&#x27;s protection, he fell prey to the god&#x27;s enchantment and became ill and died afterwards. Thus the Kusanagi stayed in Owari, where it was enshrined in the shrine of Atsuta.

====Empress Jingū and Amaterasu&#x27;s &quot;aramitama&quot;====

At one time, when Emperor Chūai was on a campaign against the Kumaso tribes of Kyushu, his consort Jingū was possessed by unknown gods who told Chūai of a land rich in treasure located on the other side of the sea that is his for the taking. When Chūai doubted their words and accused them of being deceitful, the gods laid a curse upon him that he should die &quot;without possessing this land.&quot; (The &quot;Kojiki&quot; and the &quot;Shoki&quot; diverge at this point: in the former, Chūai dies almost immediately after being cursed, while in the latter, he dies of a sudden illness a few months after.)
After Chūai&#x27;s death, Jingū performed divination to ascertain which gods had spoken to her husband. The deities identified themselves as Tsukisakaki Izu no Mitama Amazakaru Mukatsuhime no Mikoto (, &#x27;The Awe-inspiring Spirit of the Planted &quot;Sakaki&quot;, the Lady of Sky-distant Mukatsu&#x27;, usually interpreted as the &quot;aramitama&quot; or &#x27;violent spirit&#x27; of Amaterasu), Kotoshironushi, and the three gods of Sumie (Sumiyoshi): Uwatsutsunoo, Nakatsutsunoo, and Sokotsutsunoo. Worshiping the gods in accordance with their instructions, Jingū then set out to conquer the promised land beyond the sea: the three kingdoms of Korea.

When Jingū returned victorious to Japan, she enshrined the deities in places of their own choosing; Amaterasu, warning Jingū not to take her along to the capital, instructed her to install it in Hirota, the harbor where the empress disembarked.

== Family ==
=== Family tree ===











=== Consorts ===
She is a virgin goddess and never engages in sexual relationships. However, according to , she was a consort to a sun god and some telling stories place Tsukuyomi as her husband.

=== Siblings ===
Amaterasu has many siblings, most notably Susanoo and Tsukiyomi. Basil Hall Chamberlain used the words &quot;elder brother&quot; to translate her dialog referring to Susanoo in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, even though he noted that she was his elder sister. The word (which was also used by Izanami to address her elder brother and husband Izanagi) was &quot;nase&quot; (phonetically spelt in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;; modern dictionaries use the semantic spelling , whose kanji literally mean ), an ancient term used only by females to refer to their brothers, who had higher status than them. (As opposed to males using ( in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;) to refer to their sisters, who had lower status than them.) The &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; used the Chinese word () instead.

Some tellings say she had a sister named Wakahirume who was a weaving maiden and helped Amaterasu weave clothes for the other kami in heaven. Wakahirume was later accidentally killed by Susanoo.

Other traditions say she had an older brother named Hiruko.

=== Descendants ===

Amaterasu has five sons, Ame-no-oshihomimi, Ame no Hohi, Amatsuhikone, Ikutsuhikone, and Kumanokusubi, who were given birth to by Susanoo by chewing her hair jewels. According to one account in the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot;, it was because these children were male that Susanoo won during the ritual to prove his intent, even though they were not his children, but hers. This explanation of the outcome of the ritual contradicts that in the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, according to which it was because she gave birth to female children using his sword, and those children were his. The &quot;Kojiki&quot; claims he won because he had daughters to whom she gave birth, while the &quot;Nihon Shoki&quot; claims he won because he himself gave birth to her sons. Several figures and noble clans claim descent from Amaterasu most notably the Japanese imperial family through Emperor Jimmu who descended from her grandson Ninigi.

Her son Ame no Hohi is considered the ancestral kami of clans in Izumo which includes the Haji clan, Sugawara clan, and the Senge clan. The legendary sumo wrestler Nomi no Sukune is believed to be a 14th-generation descendant of Amenohohi.

==Worship==
The Ise Grand Shrine ( ) located in Ise, Mie Prefecture, Japan, houses the inner shrine, Naiku, dedicated to Amaterasu. Her sacred mirror, Yata no Kagami, is said to be kept at this shrine as one of the Imperial regalia objects. A ceremony known as () is held every twenty years at this shrine to honor the many deities enshrined, which is formed by 125 shrines altogether. New shrine buildings are built at a location adjacent to the site first. After the transfer of the object of worship, new clothing and treasure and offering food to the goddess the old buildings are taken apart. The building materials taken apart are given to many other shrines and buildings to renovate. This practice is a part of the Shinto faith and has been practiced since the year 690 CE, but is not only for Amaterasu but also for many other deities enshrined in Ise Grand Shrine. Additionally, from the late 7th century to the 14th century, an unmarried princess of the Imperial Family, called &quot;Saiō&quot; () or (), served as the sacred priestess of Amaterasu at the Ise Shrine upon every new dynasty.

The in Takachiho, Miyazaki Prefecture, Japan is also dedicated to Amaterasu and sits above the gorge containing Ama-no-Iwato.

The worship of Amaterasu to the exclusion of other has been described as &quot;the cult of the sun.&quot; This phrase may also refer to the early pre-archipelagoan worship of the sun.

According to the &quot;Engishiki&quot; () and &quot;Sandai Jitsuroku&quot; () of the Heian period, the sun goddess had many shrines named &quot;Amateru&quot; or &quot;Amateru-mitama&quot;, which were mostly located in the Kinki area. However, there have also been records of a shrine on Tsushima Island, coined as either &quot;Teruhi Gongen&quot; or the &quot;Shining Sun Deity&quot; during medieval times. It was later found that such a shrine was meant for a male sun deity named Ameno-himitama.

Amaterasu was also once worshiped at Hinokuma shrines. The Hinokuma shrines were used to worship the goddess by the Ama people in the Kii Provinces. Because the Ama people were believed to have been fishermen, researchers have conjectured that the goddess was also worshiped for a possible connection to the sea.

In Kurozumikyō, a Shinto-derived new religion that was founded in 1814 by Munetada Kurozumi (黒住宗忠), Amaterasu is the supreme deity that is worshipped.

Amaterasu was thought by some in the early 20th century until after World War II to have &quot;created the Japanese archipelago from the drops of water that fell from her spear&quot; and in historic times, the spear was an item compared to the sun and solar deities.

== Differences in worship ==
Amaterasu, while primarily being the goddess of the sun, is also sometimes worshiped as having connections with other aspects and forms of nature. Amaterasu can also be considered a goddess of the wind and typhoons alongside her brother, and even possibly death. There are many connections between local legends in the Ise region with other goddesses of nature, such as a nameless goddess of the underworld and sea. It is possible that Amaterasu&#x27;s name became associated with these legends in the Shinto religion as it grew throughout Japan.

One source interprets from the Heavenly Rock Cave myth that Amaterasu was seen as being responsible for the normal cycle of day and night.

A historical myth holds that she painted the islands of Japan into being, alongside her siblings Susanoo and Tsukuyomi.

In contrast, Amaterasu, while enshrined at other locations, also can be seen as the goddess that represents Japan and its ethnicity. The many differences in Shinto religion and mythology can be due to how different local gods and beliefs clashed. In the Meiji Era, the belief in Amaterasu fought against the Izumo belief in Ōkuninushi for spiritual control over the land of Japan. During this time, the religious nature of Okininushi may have been changed to be included in Shinto mythology. Osagawara Shouzo built shrines in other countries to mainly spread Japan&#x27;s culture and Shinto religion. It, however, was usually seen as the worshiping of Japan itself, rather than Amaterasu. Most of these colonial and oversea shrines were destroyed after WWII.

=== Other worshiped forms ===

==== Snake ====
Outside of being worshiped as a sun goddess, some have argued that Amaterasu was once related to snakes. There was a legend circulating among the Ise Priests that essentially described an encounter of Amaterasu sleeping with the Saiō every night in the form of a snake or lizard, evidenced by fallen scales in the priestess&#x27; bed. This was recorded by a medieval monk in his diary, which stated that &quot;in ancient times Amaterasu was regarded as a snake deity or as a sun deity.&quot; In the Ise kanjō, the god&#x27;s snake form is considered an embodiment of the &quot;three poisons&quot;, namely greed, anger, and ignorance. Amaterasu is also linked to a snake cult, which is also tied to the theory that the initial gender of the goddess was male.

==== Dragon ====

In general, some of these Amaterasu–dragon associations have been in reference to Japanese plays. One example has been within the Chikubushima tradition in which the dragon goddess Benzaiten was the emanation of Amaterasu. Following that, in the Japanese epic, Taiheki, one of the characters, Nitta Yoshisada (), made comparisons with Amaterasu and a dragon Ryūjin with the quote: &quot;I have heard that the Sun Goddess of Ise … conceals her true being in the august image of Vairocana, and that she has appeared in this world in the guise of a dragon god of the blue ocean.&quot;

Another tradition of the Heavenly Cave story depicts Amaterasu as a &quot;dragon-fox&quot; ( or ) during her descent to the famed cave because it is a type of animal/kami that emits light from its entire body.

The connection between the fox, Dakiniten, and Amaterasu can also be seen in the &quot;Keiran Shūyōshū&quot;, which features the following retelling of the myth of Amaterasu&#x27;s hiding:

Commenting on the &quot;sokui kanjō&quot;, Bernard Faure writes:under the name &quot;Fox King,&quot; Dakiniten became a manifestation of the sun goddess Amaterasu, with whom the new emperor united during the enthronement ritual. [...] The Buddhist ritual allowed the ruler to symbolically cross over the limits separating the human and animal realms to harness the wild and properly superhuman energy of the &quot;infrahuman&quot; world, so as to gain full control of the human sphere.

== Relation to women&#x27;s positions in early Japanese society ==

Because Amaterasu has the highest position among the Shinto deities, there has been debate on her influence and relation to women&#x27;s positions in early Japanese society. Some scholars have argued that the goddess&#x27; presence and high stature within the system could suggest that early rulers in Japan were female. Others have argued the goddess&#x27; presence implies strong influences female priests had in Japanese politics and religion.

<doc id="39221" wikidata="Q1146448" url="?curid=39221" title="Thermodynamic free energy">
<text>In thermodynamics, the thermodynamic free energy is one of the state functions of a thermodynamic system. The change in the free energy is the maximum amount of work that the system can perform in a process at constant temperature, and its sign indicates whether the process is thermodynamically favorable or forbidden. Since free energy usually contains potential energy, it is not absolute but depends on the choice of a zero point. Therefore, only relative free energy values, or changes in free energy, are physically meaningful.

The free energy is the portion of any first-law energy that is available to perform thermodynamic work at constant temperature, &quot;i.e.&quot;, work mediated by thermal energy. Free energy is subject to irreversible loss in the course of such work. Since first-law energy is always conserved, it is evident that free energy is an expendable, second-law kind of energy. Several free energy functions may be formulated based on system criteria. Free energy functions are Legendre transforms of the internal energy.

The Gibbs free energy is given by , where is the enthalpy, is the absolute temperature, and is the entropy. , where is the internal energy, is the pressure, and is the volume. is the most useful for processes involving a system at pressure and temperature , because, in addition to subsuming any entropy change due merely to heat, a change in also excludes the work needed to &quot;make space for additional molecules&quot; produced by various processes. Gibbs free energy change therefore equals work not associated with system expansion or compression, at constant temperature and pressure, hence its utility to solution-phase chemists, including biochemists.

The historically earlier Helmholtz free energy is defined in contrast as . Its change is equal to the amount of reversible work done on, or obtainable from, a system at constant . Thus its appellation &quot;work content&quot;, and the designation (). Since it makes no reference to any quantities involved in work (such as and ), the Helmholtz function is completely general: its decrease is the maximum amount of work which can be done &quot;by&quot; a system at constant temperature, and it can increase at most by the amount of work done &quot;on&quot; a system isothermally. The Helmholtz free energy has a special theoretical importance since it is proportional to the logarithm of the partition function for the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics. (Hence its utility to physicists; and to gas-phase chemists and engineers, who do not want to ignore work.)

Historically, the term &#x27;free energy&#x27; has been used for either quantity. In physics, &quot;free energy&quot; most often refers to the Helmholtz free energy, denoted by (or ), while in chemistry, &quot;free energy&quot; most often refers to the Gibbs free energy. The values of the two free energies are usually quite similar and the intended free energy function is often implicit in manuscripts and presentations.

== Meaning of &quot;free&quot; ==
The basic definition of &quot;energy&quot; is a measure of a body&#x27;s (in thermodynamics, the system&#x27;s) ability to cause change. For example, when a person pushes a heavy box a few metres forward, that person exerts mechanical energy, also known as work, on the box over a distance of a few meters forward. The mathematical definition of this form of energy is the product of the force exerted on the object and the distance by which the box moved (). Because the person changed the stationary position of the box, that person exerted energy on that box. The work exerted can also be called &quot;useful energy&quot;, because energy was converted from one form into the intended purpose, i.e. mechanical use. For the case of the person pushing the box, the energy in the form of internal (or potential) energy obtained through metabolism was converted into work to push the box. This energy conversion, however, was not straightforward: while some internal energy went into pushing the box, some was diverted away (lost) in the form of heat (transferred thermal energy). 

For a reversible process, heat is the product of the absolute temperature formula_1 and the change in entropy formula_2 of a body (entropy is a measure of disorder in a system). The difference between the change in internal energy, which is formula_3, and the energy lost in the form of heat is what is called the &quot;useful energy&quot; of the body, or the work of the body performed on an object. In thermodynamics, this is what is known as &quot;free energy&quot;. In other words, free energy is a measure of work (useful energy) a system can perform at constant temperature. 

Mathematically, free energy is expressed as

formula_4

This expression has commonly been interpreted to mean that work is extracted from the internal energy formula_5 while formula_6 represents energy not available to perform work. However, this is incorrect. For instance, in an isothermal expansion of an ideal gas, the internal energy change is formula_7 and the expansion work formula_8 is derived exclusively from the formula_6 term supposedly not available to perform work. But it is noteworthy that the derivative form of the free energy: formula_10 (for Helmholtz free energy) does indeed indicate that a spontaneous change in a non-reactive system&#x27;s free energy (NOT the internal energy) comprises the available energy to do work (compression in this case) formula_11 and the unavailable energy formula_12. Similar expression can be written for the Gibbs free energy change.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, the theory of heat, i.e., that heat is a form of energy having relation to vibratory motion, was beginning to supplant both the caloric theory, i.e., that heat is a fluid, and the four element theory, in which heat was the lightest of the four elements. In a similar manner, during these years, heat was beginning to be distinguished into different classification categories, such as &quot;free heat&quot;, &quot;combined heat&quot;, &quot;radiant heat&quot;, specific heat, heat capacity, &quot;absolute heat&quot;, &quot;latent caloric&quot;, &quot;free&quot; or &quot;perceptible&quot; caloric (&quot;calorique sensible&quot;), among others.

In 1780, for example, Laplace and Lavoisier stated: “In general, one can change the first hypothesis into the second by changing the words ‘free heat, combined heat, and heat released’ into ‘vis viva, loss of vis viva, and increase of vis viva.’&quot; In this manner, the total mass of caloric in a body, called &quot;absolute heat&quot;, was regarded as a mixture of two components; the free or perceptible caloric could affect a thermometer, whereas the other component, the latent caloric, could not. The use of the words &quot;latent heat&quot; implied a similarity to latent heat in the more usual sense; it was regarded as chemically &quot;bound&quot; to the molecules of the body. In the adiabatic compression of a gas, the absolute heat remained constant but the observed rise in temperature implied that some latent caloric had become &quot;free&quot; or perceptible.

During the early 19th century, the concept of perceptible or free caloric began to be referred to as &quot;free heat&quot; or &quot;heat set free&quot;. In 1824, for example, the French physicist Sadi Carnot, in his famous &quot;Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire&quot;, speaks of quantities of heat ‘absorbed or set free’ in different transformations. In 1882, the German physicist and physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz coined the phrase ‘free energy’ for the expression formula_13, in which the change in &quot;A&quot; (or &quot;G&quot;) determines the amount of energy ‘free’ for work under the given conditions, specifically constant temperature.

Thus, in traditional use, the term &quot;free&quot; was attached to Gibbs free energy for systems at constant pressure and temperature, or to Helmholtz free energy for systems at constant temperature, to mean ‘available in the form of useful work.’ With reference to the Gibbs free energy, we need to add the qualification that it is the energy &quot;free&quot; for non-volume work and compositional changes.

An increasing number of books and journal articles do not include the attachment &quot;free&quot;, referring to &quot;G&quot; as simply Gibbs energy (and likewise for the Helmholtz energy). This is the result of a 1988 IUPAC meeting to set unified terminologies for the international scientific community, in which the adjective ‘free’ was supposedly banished. This standard, however, has not yet been universally adopted, and many published articles and books still include the descriptive ‘free’.

==Application==
Just like the general concept of energy, free energy has a few definitions suitable for different conditions. In physics, chemistry, and biology, these conditions are thermodynamic parameters (temperature formula_1, volume formula_15, pressure formula_16, etc.). Scientists have come up with several ways to define free energy. The mathematical expression of Helmholtz free energy is:

:formula_17

This definition of free energy is useful for gas-phase reactions or in physics when modeling the behavior of isolated systems kept at a constant volume. For example, if a researcher wanted to perform a combustion reaction in a bomb calorimeter, the volume is kept constant throughout the course of a reaction. Therefore, the heat of the reaction is a direct measure of the free energy change, formula_18. In solution chemistry, on the other hand, most chemical reactions are kept at constant pressure. Under this condition, the heat formula_19 of the reaction is equal to the enthalpy change formula_20 of the system. Under constant pressure and temperature, the free energy in a reaction is known as Gibbs free energy formula_21.

:formula_22

These functions have a minimum in chemical equilibrium, as long as certain variables (formula_1, and formula_15 or formula_16) are held constant. In addition, they also have theoretical importance in deriving Maxwell relations. Work other than may be added, e.g., for electrochemical cells, or work in elastic materials and in muscle contraction. Other forms of work which must sometimes be considered are stress-strain, magnetic, as in adiabatic demagnetization used in the approach to absolute zero, and work due to electric polarization. These are described by tensors.

In most cases of interest there are internal degrees of freedom and processes, such as chemical reactions and phase transitions, which create entropy. Even for homogeneous &quot;bulk&quot; materials, the free energy functions depend on the (often suppressed) composition, as do all proper thermodynamic potentials (extensive functions), including the internal energy.

formula_26 is the number of molecules (alternatively, moles) of type formula_27 in the system. If these quantities do not appear, it is impossible to describe compositional changes. The differentials for processes at uniform pressure and temperature are (assuming only formula_28 work):

:formula_29

:formula_30

where &quot;μ&quot;&quot;i&quot; is the chemical potential for the &quot;i&quot;th component in the system. The second relation is especially useful at constant formula_1 and formula_16, conditions which are easy to achieve experimentally, and which approximately characterize living creatures. Under these conditions, it simplifies to

:formula_33

Any decrease in the Gibbs function of a system is the upper limit for any isothermal, isobaric work that can be captured in the surroundings, or it may simply be dissipated, appearing as formula_1 times a corresponding increase in the entropy of the system and/or its surrounding.

An example is surface free energy, the amount of increase of free energy when the area of surface increases by every unit area.

The path integral Monte Carlo method is a numerical approach for determining the values of free energies, based on quantum dynamical principles.

===Work and free energy change===
For a reversible isothermal process, Δ&quot;S&quot; = &quot;q&quot;rev/&quot;T&quot; and therefore the definition of &quot;A&quot; results in

: formula_35 (at constant temperature)

This tells us that the change in free energy equals the reversible or maximum work for a process performed at constant temperature. Under other conditions, free-energy change is not equal to work; for instance, for a reversible adiabatic expansion of an ideal gas, Importantly, for a heat engine, including the Carnot cycle, the free-energy change after a full cycle is zero, while the engine produces nonzero work. It is important to note that for heat engines and other thermal systems, the free energies do not offer convenient characterizations; internal energy and enthalpy are the preferred potentials for characterizing thermal systems.

===Free energy change and spontaneous processes===
According to the second law of thermodynamics, for any process that occurs in a closed system, the inequality of Clausius, Δ&quot;S&quot; &gt; &quot;q&quot;/&quot;T&quot;surr, applies. For a process at constant temperature and pressure without non-&quot;PV&quot; work, this inequality transforms into formula_36. Similarly, for a process at constant temperature and volume, formula_37. Thus, a negative value of the change in free energy is a necessary condition for a process to be spontaneous; this is the most useful form of the second law of thermodynamics in chemistry. In chemical equilibrium at constant &quot;T&quot; and &quot;p&quot; without electrical work, d&quot;G&quot; = 0.

== History ==
The quantity called &quot;free energy&quot; is a more advanced and accurate replacement for the outdated term &quot;affinity&quot;, which was used by chemists in previous years to describe the &quot;force&quot; that caused chemical reactions. The term affinity, as used in chemical relation, dates back to at least the time of Albertus Magnus.

From the 1998 textbook &quot;Modern Thermodynamics&quot; by Nobel Laureate and chemistry professor Ilya Prigogine we find: &quot;As motion was explained by the Newtonian concept of force, chemists wanted a similar concept of ‘driving force’ for chemical change. Why do chemical reactions occur, and why do they stop at certain points? Chemists called the ‘force’ that caused chemical reactions affinity, but it lacked a clear definition.&quot;

During the entire 18th century, the dominant view with regard to heat and light was that put forth by Isaac Newton, called the &quot;Newtonian hypothesis&quot;, which states that light and heat are forms of matter attracted or repelled by other forms of matter, with forces analogous to gravitation or to chemical affinity.

In the 19th century, the French chemist Marcellin Berthelot and the Danish chemist Julius Thomsen had attempted to quantify affinity using heats of reaction. In 1875, after quantifying the heats of reaction for a large number of compounds, Berthelot proposed the &quot;principle of maximum work&quot;, in which all chemical changes occurring without intervention of outside energy tend toward the production of bodies or of a system of bodies which liberate heat.

In addition to this, in 1780 Antoine Lavoisier and Pierre-Simon Laplace laid the foundations of thermochemistry by showing that the heat given out in a reaction is equal to the heat absorbed in the reverse reaction. They also investigated the specific heat and latent heat of a number of substances, and amounts of heat given out in combustion. In a similar manner, in 1840 Swiss chemist Germain Hess formulated the principle that the evolution of heat in a reaction is the same whether the process is accomplished in one-step process or in a number of stages. This is known as Hess&#x27; law. With the advent of the mechanical theory of heat in the early 19th century, Hess&#x27;s law came to be viewed as a consequence of the law of conservation of energy.

Based on these and other ideas, Berthelot and Thomsen, as well as others, considered the heat given out in the formation of a compound as a measure of the affinity, or the work done by the chemical forces. This view, however, was not entirely correct. In 1847, the English physicist James Joule showed that he could raise the temperature of water by turning a paddle wheel in it, thus showing that heat and mechanical work were equivalent or proportional to each other, i.e., approximately, . This statement came to be known as the mechanical equivalent of heat and was a precursory form of the first law of thermodynamics.

By 1865, the German physicist Rudolf Clausius had shown that this equivalence principle needed amendment. That is, one can use the heat derived from a combustion reaction in a coal furnace to boil water, and use this heat to vaporize steam, and then use the enhanced high-pressure energy of the vaporized steam to push a piston. Thus, we might naively reason that one can entirely convert the initial combustion heat of the chemical reaction into the work of pushing the piston. Clausius showed, however, that we must take into account the work that the molecules of the working body, i.e., the water molecules in the cylinder, do on each other as they pass or transform from one step of or state of the engine cycle to the next, e.g., from (formula_38) to (formula_39). Clausius originally called this the &quot;transformation content&quot; of the body, and then later changed the name to entropy. Thus, the heat used to transform the working body of molecules from one state to the next cannot be used to do external work, e.g., to push the piston. Clausius defined this &quot;transformation heat&quot; as formula_40.

In 1873, Willard Gibbs published &quot;A Method of Geometrical Representation of the Thermodynamic Properties of Substances by Means of Surfaces&quot;, in which he introduced the preliminary outline of the principles of his new equation able to predict or estimate the tendencies of various natural processes to ensue when bodies or systems are brought into contact. By studying the interactions of homogeneous substances in contact, i.e., bodies, being in composition part solid, part liquid, and part vapor, and by using a three-dimensional volume-entropy-internal energy graph, Gibbs was able to determine three states of equilibrium, i.e., &quot;necessarily stable&quot;, &quot;neutral&quot;, and &quot;unstable&quot;, and whether or not changes will ensue. In 1876, Gibbs built on this framework by introducing the concept of chemical potential so to take into account chemical reactions and states of bodies that are chemically different from each other. In his own words, to summarize his results in 1873, Gibbs states:

In this description, as used by Gibbs, &quot;ε&quot; refers to the internal energy of the body, &quot;η&quot; refers to the entropy of the body, and &quot;ν&quot; is the volume of the body.

Hence, in 1882, after the introduction of these arguments by Clausius and Gibbs, the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz stated, in opposition to Berthelot and Thomas&#x27; hypothesis that chemical affinity is a measure of the heat of reaction of chemical reaction as based on the principle of maximal work, that affinity is not the heat given out in the formation of a compound but rather it is the largest quantity of work which can be gained when the reaction is carried out in a reversible manner, e.g., electrical work in a reversible cell. The maximum work is thus regarded as the diminution of the free, or available, energy of the system (Gibbs free energy &quot;G&quot; at &quot;T&quot; = constant, &quot;P&quot; = constant or Helmholtz free energy &quot;A&quot; at &quot;T&quot; = constant, &quot;V&quot; = constant), whilst the heat given out is usually a measure of the diminution of the total energy of the system (Internal energy). Thus, &quot;G&quot; or &quot;A&quot; is the amount of energy &quot;free&quot; for work under the given conditions.

Up until this point, the general view had been such that: “all chemical reactions drive the system to a state of equilibrium in which the affinities of the reactions vanish”. Over the next 60 years, the term affinity came to be replaced with the term free energy. According to chemistry historian Henry Leicester, the influential 1923 textbook &quot;Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Reactions&quot; by Gilbert N. Lewis and Merle Randall led to the replacement of the term &quot;affinity&quot; by the term &quot;free energy&quot; in much of the English-speaking world.

<text>The standard circulating coinage of the United Kingdom, British Crown Dependencies and British Overseas Territories is denominated in pennies and pounds sterling (symbol &quot;£&quot;, commercial GBP), and ranges in value from one penny sterling to two pounds. Since decimalisation, on 15 February 1971, the pound has been divided into 100 pence (minted on coins as new until 1981). Before decimalisation, twelve pence made a shilling, and twenty shillings made a pound. 

British coins are minted by the Royal Mint in Llantrisant, Wales. The Royal Mint also commissions the coins&#x27; designs however they also have to be accepted by the reigning monarch.

In addition to the circulating coinage, the UK also mints commemorative decimal coins (crowns) in the denomination of five pounds, ceremonial Maundy money in the denomination of 1, 2, 3 and 4 pence in sterling (.925) silver and bullion coinage of gold sovereigns, half sovereigns, and gold and silver Britannia coins are also produced. Some territories outside the United Kingdom, which use the pound sterling, produce their own coinage, with the same denominations and specifications as the UK coinage but with local designs that are not legal tender in the mainland United Kingdom.

==Currently circulating coinage==
The current decimal coins consist of:

* one penny and two pence in copper-plated steel
* five pence and ten pence in nickel-plated steel
* equilateral curve heptagonal twenty pence and fifty pence in cupronickel
* bimetallic one pound and two pounds.

All circulating coins have an effigy of one of two monarchs on the obverse; various national, regional and commemorative designs on the reverse; and the denomination in numbers or words.
;Elizabeth II: The obverse carries an abbreviated Latin inscription whose full form, , translates to &quot;Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and Defender of the Faith&quot;. The denomination is usually on the reverse.
;Charles III: The obverse carries an abbreviated, anglicised Latin inscription whose full form, , translates to &quot;Charles III, by the grace of God, King and Defender of the Faith&quot;. The denomination may be on either side.


===Production and distribution===
All genuine UK coins are produced by the Royal Mint. The same coinage is used across the United Kingdom: unlike banknotes, local issues of coins are not produced for different parts of the UK. The pound coin until 2016 was produced in regional designs, but these circulate equally in all parts of the UK (see UK designs, below).

Every year, newly minted coins are checked for size, weight, and composition at a Trial of the Pyx. Essentially the same procedure has been used since the 13th century. Assaying is now done by the Worshipful Company of Goldsmiths on behalf of HM Treasury.

The 1p and 2p coins from 1971 are the oldest standard-issue coins still in circulation. Pre-decimal crowns are the oldest coins in general that are still legal tender, although they are in practice never encountered in general circulation.

Coins from the British dependencies and territories that use sterling as their currency are sometimes found in change in other jurisdictions. Strictly, they are not legal tender in the United Kingdom; however, since they have the same specifications as UK coins, they are sometimes tolerated in commerce, and can readily be used in vending machines.

UK-issued coins are, on the other hand, generally fully accepted and freely mixed in other British dependencies and territories that use the pound.

An extensive coinage redesign was commissioned by the Royal Mint in 2005, and new designs were gradually introduced into the circulating British coinage from summer 2008. Except for the £1 coin, the pre-2008 coins remain legal tender and are expected to stay in circulation for the foreseeable future.

The estimated volume in circulation as at March 2016 is:

==History of pre-decimal coinage==
Because of trade links with Charlemagne&#x27;s Frankish Empire, the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms copied the Frankish currency system of 12 deniers (&quot;d&quot;, pennies) to the sou (shilling) and 240 deniers or 20 sous to the libra (&quot;£&quot;, pound), the origin of the name of the current British currency. It referred to the literal weight of 240 penny coins, which at 30 grains each, weighed 1 tower pound of sterling (0.925 fine) silver. At this point and for centuries, pennies were the only coins struck; shillings and pounds were only units of account.

===The penny before 1500===
The English silver penny first appeared in the 8th century CE in adoption of Western Europe&#x27;s Carolingian monetary system wherein 12 pence made a shilling and 20 shillings made a pound. The weight of the English penny was fixed at troy grains (about 1.46 grams) by Offa of Mercia, an 8th-century contemporary of Charlemagne; 240 pennies weighed 5,400 grains or a tower pound (different from the troy pound of 5,760 grains). The silver penny was the only coin minted for 500 years, from c. 780 to 1280.

From the time of Charlemagne until the 12th century, the silver currency of England was made from the highest purity silver available. But there were disadvantages to minting currency of fine silver, notably the level of wear it suffered, and the ease with which coins could be &quot;clipped&quot;, or trimmed. In 1158 a new standard for English coinage was established by Henry II with the &quot;Tealby Penny&quot; – the sterling silver standard of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. This was a harder-wearing alloy, yet it was still a rather high grade of silver. It went some way towards discouraging the practice of &quot;clipping&quot;, though this practice was further discouraged and largely eliminated with the introduction of the milled edge seen on coins today.

The weight of a silver penny stayed constant at above 22 grains until 1344; afterwards its weight was reduced to 18 grains in 1351, to 15 grains in 1412, to 12 grains in 1464, and to 10 grains in 1527.

The history of the Royal Mint stretches back to AD 886. For many centuries production was in London, initially at the Tower of London, and then at premises nearby in Tower Hill in what is today known as Royal Mint Court. In the 1970s production was transferred to Llantrisant in South Wales. Historically Scotland and England had separate coinage; the last Scottish coins were struck in 1709 shortly after union with England.

===The penny after 1500===

During the reign of Henry VIII, the silver content was gradually debased, reaching a low of one-third silver. However, in Edward VI&#x27;s reign in 1551, this debased coinage was discontinued in favor of a return to sterling silver with the penny weighing 8 grains. The first crowns and half-crowns were produced that year. From this point onwards till 1920, sterling was the rule.

Coins were originally hand-hammered – an ancient technique in which two dies are struck together with a blank coin between them. This was the traditional method of manufacturing coins in the Western world from the classical Greek era onwards, in contrast with Asia, where coins were traditionally cast. Milled (that is, machine-made) coins were produced first during the reign of Elizabeth I (1558–1603) and periodically during the subsequent reigns of James I and Charles I, but there was initially opposition to mechanisation from the moneyers, who ensured that most coins continued to be produced by hammering. All British coins produced since 1662 have been milled.

By 1601 it was decreed that one troy ounce or 480 grains of sterling silver be minted into 62 pennies (i.e. each penny weighed 7.742 grains). By 1696, the currency had been seriously weakened by an increase in clipping during the Nine Years&#x27; War to the extent that it was decided to recall and replace all hammered silver coinage in circulation. The exercise came close to disaster due to fraud and mismanagement, but was saved by the personal intervention of Isaac Newton after his appointment as Warden of the Mint, a post which was intended to be a sinecure, but which he took seriously. Newton was subsequently given the post of Master of the Mint in 1699. Following the 1707 union between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland, Newton used his previous experience to direct the 1707–1710 Scottish recoinage, resulting in a common currency for the new Kingdom of Great Britain. After 15 September 1709 no further silver coins were ever struck in Scotland.

As a result of a report written by Newton on 21 September 1717 to the Lords Commissioners of His Majesty&#x27;s Treasury the bimetallic relationship between gold coins and silver coins was changed by royal proclamation on 22 December 1717, forbidding the exchange of gold guineas for more than 21 silver shillings. Due to differing valuations in other European countries this unintentionally resulted in a silver shortage, as silver coins were used to pay for imports, while exports were paid for in gold, effectively moving Britain from the silver standard to its first gold standard, rather than the bimetallic standard implied by the proclamation.

The coinage reform of 1816 set up a weight/value ratio and physical sizes for silver coins. Each troy ounce of sterling silver was henceforth minted into 66 pence or 5 shillings.

In 1920, the silver content of all British coins was reduced from 92.5% to 50%, with some of the remainder consisting of manganese, which caused the coins to tarnish to a very dark colour after they had been in circulation for long. Silver was eliminated altogether in 1947, except for Maundy coinage, which returned to the pre-1920 92.5% silver composition.

The 1816 weight/value ratio and size system survived the debasement of silver in 1920, and the adoption of token coins of cupronickel in 1947. It even persisted after decimalisation for those coins which had equivalents and continued to be minted with their values in new pence. The UK finally abandoned it in 1992 when smaller, more convenient, &quot;silver&quot; coins were introduced.

==History of decimal coinage==

===Decimalisation===
Since decimalisation on 15 February 1971 the pound (symbol &quot;£&quot;) has been divided into 100 pence. (Prior to decimalisation the pound was divided into 20 shillings, each of 12 [old] pence; thus, there were 240 [old] pence to the pound.) The pound remained as Britain&#x27;s currency unit after decimalisation (unlike in many other British commonwealth countries, which dropped the pound upon decimalisation by introducing dollars or new units worth 10 shillings or pound). The following coins were introduced with these reverse designs:
* Half penny, 1971–1984: A crown, symbolising the monarch.
* One penny, 1971–2007: A crowned portcullis with chains (the badge of the Houses of Parliament).
* Two pence, 1971–2007: The Prince of Wales&#x27;s feathers: a plume of ostrich feathers within a coronet.
* Five pence, 1968–2007: The Badge of Scotland, a thistle royally crowned.
* Ten pence, 1968–2007: The lion of England royally crowned.
* Fifty pence, 1969–2007: Britannia and lion.

The first decimal coins – the five pence (5p) and ten pence (10p) — were introduced in 1968 in the run-up to decimalisation in order to familiarise the public with the new system. These initially circulated alongside the pre-decimal coinage and had the same size and value as the existing one shilling and two shilling coins respectively. The fifty pence (50p) coin followed in 1969, replacing the old ten shilling note. The remaining decimal coins – at the time, the half penny (p), penny (1p) and two pence (2p) — were issued in 1971 at decimalisation. A quarter-penny coin, to be struck in aluminium, was proposed at the time decimalisation was being planned, but was never minted.

The new coins were initially marked with the wording (singular) or (plural). The word &quot;new&quot; was dropped in 1982. The symbol &quot;p&quot; was adopted to distinguish the new pennies from the old, which used the symbol &quot;d&quot; (from the Latin &quot;denarius,&quot; a coin used in the Roman Empire).

===Updates 1982–1998===
In the years since decimalisation, a number of changes have been made to the coinage; these new denominations were introduced with the following designs:
* Twenty pence, 1982–2007: A crowned Tudor Rose, a traditional heraldic emblem of England (with incuse design and lettering).
* One pound (round), 1983–2016: various designs; see &quot;One pound (British coin)&quot;.
* Two pounds, 1997–2014: An abstract design of concentric circles, representing technological development from the Iron Age to the modern-day electronic age.

Additionally:
* The halfpenny was discontinued in 1984.
* The composition of the 1p and 2p was changed in 1992 from bronze to copper-plated steel without changing the design.
* The sizes of the 5p, 10p and 50p coins were reduced in 1990, 1992 and 1997, respectively, also without changing the design.

The twenty pence (20p) coin was introduced in 1982 to fill the gap between the 10p and 50p coins. The pound coin (£1) was introduced in 1983 to replace the Bank of England £1 banknote which was discontinued in 1984 (although the Scottish banks continued producing them for some time afterwards; the last of them, the Royal Bank of Scotland £1 note, is still issued in a small volume ). The designs on the £1 coin changed annually in a largely five-year cycle, until the introduction of the new 12-sided £1 coin in 2017.

The decimal halfpenny coin was demonetised in 1984 as its value was by then too small to be useful. The pre-decimal sixpence, shilling and two shilling coins, which had continued to circulate alongside the decimal coinage with values of p, 5p and 10p respectively, were finally withdrawn in 1980, 1990 and 1993 respectively. The double florin and crown, with values of 20p and 25p respectively, have technically not been withdrawn, but in practice are never seen in general circulation.

In the 1990s, the Royal Mint reduced the sizes of the 5p, 10p, and 50p coins. As a consequence, the oldest 5p coins in circulation date from 1990, the oldest 10p coins from 1992 and the oldest 50p coins come from 1997. Since 1997, many special commemorative designs of 50p have been issued. Some of these are found fairly frequently in circulation and some are rare. They are all legal tender.

In 1992 the composition of the 1p and 2p coins was changed from bronze to copper-plated steel. Due to their high copper content (97%), the intrinsic value of pre-1992 1p and 2p coins increased with the surge in metal prices of the mid-2000s, until by 2006 the coins would, if melted down, have been worth about 50% more than their face value.

A circulating bimetallic two pound (£2) coin was introduced in 1998 (first minted in, and dated, 1997). There had previously been unimetallic commemorative £2 coins which did not normally circulate. This tendency to use the two pound coin for commemorative issues has continued since the introduction of the bimetallic coin, and a few of the older unimetallic coins have since entered circulation.

There are also commemorative issues of crowns. Until 1981, these had a face value of twenty-five pence (25p), equivalent to the five shilling crown used in pre-decimal Britain. However, in 1990 crowns were redenominated with a face value of five pounds (£5) as the previous value was considered not sufficient for such a high-status coin. The size and weight of the coin remained exactly the same. Decimal crowns are generally not found in circulation as their market value is likely to be higher than their face value, but they remain legal tender.

===Obverse designs===
All modern British coins feature a profile of the current monarch&#x27;s head on the obverse. Until 2022, there had been only one monarch since decimalisation, Queen Elizabeth II, and her head appeared on all decimal coins minted up to that date, facing to the right (see also Monarch&#x27;s profile, below). Five different effigies were used, reflecting the Queen&#x27;s changing appearance as she aged. They were created by Mary Gillick (for coins minted until 1968), Arnold Machin (1968–1984), Raphael Maklouf (1985–1997), Ian Rank-Broadley (1998–2015), and Jody Clark (from 2015). In September 2022, the first portrait of Charles III was revealed, designed by Martin Jennings.

Most current coins carry a Latin inscription whose full form is , meaning &quot;Elizabeth II, by the grace of God, Queen and Defender of the Faith&quot;. The inscription appears in any of several abbreviated forms, typically . Those minted and circulated after the accession of Charles III are inscribed with , typically abbreviated as or .

===2008 redesign===
In 2008, UK coins underwent an extensive redesign which eventually changed the reverse designs of all coins, the first wholesale change to British coinage since the first decimal coins were introduced in April 1968. The major design feature was the introduction of a reverse design shared across six coins (1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p), that can be pieced together to form an image of the Royal Shield. This was the first time a coin design had been featured across multiple coins in this way. To summarize the reverse design changes made in 2008 and afterwards:
* The 1p coin depicts the lower part of the first quarter and the upper part of the third quarter of the shield, showing the lions passant of England and the harp of Ireland respectively
* The 2p coin depicts most of the second quarter of the shield, showing the lion rampant of Scotland
* The 5p coin depicts the centre of the shield, showing the meeting and parts of the constituent parts of the shield
* The 10p coin depicts most of the first quarter of the shield, containing the three lions passant of England
* The 20p coin depicts the lower part of the second quarter and upper part of the fourth quarter, showing the lion rampant of Scotland and the lions passant of England respectively
* The 50p coin depicts the point of the shield and the bottom portions of the second and third quarters showing the harp of Ireland and lions passant of England respectively
* The round, nickel-brass £1 coin from 2008 to 2016 depicted the whole of the Royal Shield. From 2017 it was changed to a bimetallic 12-sided coin depicting a rose, leek, thistle and shamrock bound by a crown.
* The £2 coin from 2015 depicts Britannia.

The original intention was to exclude both the £1 and £2 coins from the redesign because they were &quot;relatively new additions&quot; to the coinage, but it was later decided to include a £1 coin with a complete Royal Shield design from 2008 to 2016, 
and the 2015 redesign of the £2 coin occurred due to complaints over the disappearance of Britannia&#x27;s image from the 50p coin in 2008.

On all coins, the beading (ring of small dots) around the edge of the obverses has been removed. The obverse of the 20p coin has also been amended to incorporate the year, which had been on the reverse of the coin since its introduction in 1982 (giving rise to an unusual issue of a mule version without any date at all). The orientation of both sides of the 50p coin has been rotated through 180 degrees, meaning the bottom of the coin is now a corner rather than a flat edge. The numerals showing the decimal value of each coin, previously present on all coins except the £1 and £2, have been removed, leaving the values spelled out in words only.

The redesign was the result of a competition launched by the Royal Mint in August 2005, which closed on 14 November 2005. The competition was open to the public and received over 4,000 entries. The winning entry was unveiled on 2 April 2008, designed by Matthew Dent. The Royal Mint stated the new designs were &quot;reflecting a twenty-first century Britain&quot;. An advisor to the Royal Mint described the new coins as &quot;post-modern&quot; and said that this was something that could not have been done 50 years previously.

The redesign was criticised by some for having no specifically Welsh symbol (such as the Welsh Dragon), because the Royal Shield does not include a specifically Welsh symbol. Wrexham Member of Parliament (MP) Ian Lucas, who was also campaigning to have the Welsh Dragon included on the Union Flag, called the omission &quot;disappointing&quot;, and stated that he would be writing to the Queen to request that the Royal Standard be changed to include Wales. The Royal Mint stated that &quot;the Shield of the Royal Arms is symbolic of the whole of the United Kingdom and as such, represents Wales, Scotland, England and Northern Ireland.&quot; Designer Dent stated &quot;I am a Welshman and proud of it, but I never thought about the fact we did not have a dragon or another representation of Wales on the design because as far as I am concerned Wales is represented on the Royal Arms. This was never an issue for me.&quot;

The Royal Mint&#x27;s choice of an inexperienced coin designer to produce the new coinage was criticised by Virginia Ironside, daughter of Christopher Ironside who designed the previous UK coins. She stated that the new designs were &quot;totally unworkable as actual coins&quot;, due to the loss of a numerical currency identifier, and the smaller typeface used.

The German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; claimed that the redesign signalled the UK&#x27;s intention &quot;not to join the euro any time soon&quot;.

===Changes after 2008===
As of 2012, 5p and 10p coins have been issued in nickel-plated steel, and much of the remaining cupronickel types withdrawn, in order to retrieve more expensive metals. The new coins are 11% thicker to maintain the same weight.
There are heightened nickel allergy concerns over the new coins. Studies commissioned by the Royal Mint found no increased discharge of nickel from the coins when immersed in artificial sweat. However, an independent study found that the friction from handling results in four times as much nickel exposure as from the older-style coins. Sweden already plans to desist from using nickel in coins from 2015.

In 2016, the £1 coin&#x27;s composition was changed from a single-metal round shape to a 12-sided bi-metal design, with a slightly larger diameter, and with multiple past designs discontinued in favor of a single, unchanging design. Production of the new coins started in 2016, with the first, dated 2016, entering circulation 28 March 2017.

In February 2015, the Royal Mint announced a new design for the £2 coin featuring Britannia by Antony Dufort, with no change to its bimetallic composition.

Edge inscriptions on British coins used to be commonly encountered on round £1 coins of 1983–2016, but are nowadays found only on £2 coins. The standard-issue £2 coin from 1997 to 2015 carried the edge inscription . The redesigned coin since 2015 has a new edge inscription , Latin for &quot;I will claim the four seas&quot;, an inscription previously found on coins bearing the image of Britannia. Other commemorative £2 coins have their own unique edge inscriptions or designs.

===2023 redesign===
In October 2023 the Royal Mint announced new designs for the circulating coinage, which were to be released by the end of the year. The new designs feature a portrait of King Charles III facing left on the obverse, with a small Tudor Crown privy mark behind the Kings’ neck. 
The reverses are divided vertically, the leftmost third comprising a background of three interlocking “C”s, reminiscent of the interlocking C’s on the coins of King Charles II, and a large number indicating the value, countering criticism of the 2008 redesign’s lack of numeric values. The rightmost two-thirds of each design features an animal or plant representing each of the four nations:
*1p depicts the hazel dormouse.
*2p depicts the red squirrel.
*5p depicts English oak tree leaves and acorns.
*10p depicts a western capercaillie.
*20p depicts an Atlantic puffin.
*50p depicts an Atlantic salmon.
*£1 depicts two bees.
*£2 depicts the four heraldic flowers of the United Kingdom: Tudor rose, thistle, daffodil and shamrock, with the edge inscription , Latin for “In the service of all”, taken from the King&#x27;s inaugural address on 9 September 2022.

===Obsolete denominations===
The following decimal coins have been withdrawn from circulation and have ceased to be legal tender.

* The specifications and dates of 5p, 10p, and 50p coins refer to the larger sizes issued since 1968.

† The specification refers to the round coin issued from 1983 to 2016. Although obsolete, this coin is still redeemable at banks and the British railway systems.

==Commemorative issues==

===Circulating commemorative designs===
Circulating fifty pence and two pound coins have been issued with various commemorative reverse designs, typically to mark the anniversaries of historical events or the births of notable people.

Three commemorative designs were issued of the large version of the 50p: in 1973 (the EEC), 1992–3 (EC presidency) and 1994 (D-Day anniversary). Commemorative designs of the smaller 50p coin have been issued (alongside the Britannia standard issue) in 1998 (two designs), 2000, and from 2003 to 2007 yearly (two designs in 2006). For a complete list, see Fifty pence (British decimal coin).

Prior to 1997, the two pound coin was minted in commemorative issues only – in 1986, 1989, 1994, 1995 and 1996. Commemorative £2 coins have been regularly issued since 1999, alongside the standard-issue bi-metallic coins which were introduced in 1997. One or two designs have been minted each year, with the exception of none in 2000, and four regional 2002 issues marking the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester. As well as a distinct reverse design, these coins have an edge inscription relevant to the subject. The anniversary themes are continued until at least 2009, with two designs announced. For a complete list, see Two pounds (British decimal coin).

From 2018 to 2019 a series of 10p coins with 26 different designs was put in circulation &quot;celebrating Great Britain with The Royal Mint&#x27;s Quintessentially British A to Z series of coins&quot;.

===Non-circulating denominations===
Coins are sometimes issued as special collectible commemorative versions, sold at a value higher than their face value. They are usually legal tender, but worth only their face value to pay debts. For example, in 2023 a 50 pence piece was announced, the first coin depicting King Charles III, and celebrating the fictional wizard Harry Potter. The standard version sells for £11 and a colour version for £20. Other versions range up to a gold coin of £200 face value, selling for £5,215. 

The following are special-issue commemorative coins, seldom encountered in normal circulation due to their precious metal content or collectible value, but are still considered legal tender.
* Twenty-five pence or crown (25p; £0.25), 1972–1981
* Five pounds or crown (£5), 1990–present 
* Twenty pounds (£20), 2013–present
* Fifty pounds (£50), 2015–2016
* One hundred pounds (£100), 2015–2016

=== Legal tender status of commemorative coins ===

The prolific issuance since 2013 of silver commemorative £20, £50 and £100 coins at face value has led to attempts to spend or deposit these coins, prompting the Royal Mint to clarify the legal tender status of these silver coins as well as the cupronickel £5 coin. Legal tender has a very narrow legal meaning, related to paying into a court to satisfy a debt, and nobody is obliged to accept any particular form of payment (whether legal tender or not), including commemorative coins. Royal Mint guidelines advise that, although these coins were approved as legal tender, they are considered limited edition collectables not intended for general circulation.

===Maundy money===
Maundy money is a ceremonial coinage traditionally given to the poor, and nowadays awarded annually to deserving senior citizens. There are Maundy coins in denominations of one, two, three and four pence. They bear dates from 1822 to the present and are minted in very small quantities. Though they are legal tender in the UK, they are rarely or never encountered in circulation. The pre-decimal Maundy pieces have the same legal tender status and value as post-decimal ones, and effectively increased in face value by 140% upon decimalisation. Their numismatic value is much greater.

Maundy coins still bear the original portrait of the Queen as used in the circulating coins of the first years of her reign.

===Bullion coinage===
The traditional bullion coin issued by Britain is the gold sovereign, formerly a circulating coin worth 20 shillings (or one pound) and with of fine gold, but now with a nominal value of one pound. The Royal Mint continues to produce sovereigns, as well as quarter sovereigns (introduced in 2009), half sovereigns, double sovereigns and quintuple sovereigns.

Between 1987 and 2012 a series of bullion coins, the Britannia, was issued, containing 1 troy ounce (31.1 g), ounce, ounce and ounce of fine gold at a millesimal fineness of 916 (22 carat) and with face values of £100, £50, £25, and £10.

Since 2013 Britannia bullion contains 1 troy ounce of fine gold at a millesimal fineness of 999 (24 carat).

Between 1997 and 2012 silver bullion coins have also been produced under the name &quot;Britannias&quot;. The alloy used was Britannia silver (millesimal fineness 958). The silver coins were available in 1 troy ounce (31.1 g), ounce, ounce and ounce sizes. Since 2013 the alloy used is silver at a (millesimal fineness 999).

In 2016 the Royal Mint launched a series of 10 Queen&#x27;s Beasts bullion coins, one for each beast available in both gold and silver.

The Royal Mint also issues silver, gold and platinum proof sets of the circulating coins, as well as gift products such as gold coins set into jewellery.

==Non-UK coinage==

Outside the United Kingdom, the British Crown Dependencies of Jersey and Guernsey use the pound sterling as their currencies. However, they produce local issues of coinage in the same denominations and specifications, but with different designs. These circulate freely alongside UK coinage and English, Northern Irish, and Scottish banknotes within these territories, but must be converted in order to be used in the UK. The island of Alderney also produces occasional commemorative coins. &quot;(See coins of the Jersey pound, coins of the Guernsey pound, and Alderney pound for details.)&quot;. The Isle of Man is a unique case among the Crown Dependencies, issuing its own currency, the Manx pound. While the Isle of Man recognises the Pound Sterling as a secondary currency, coins of the Manx pound are not legal tender in the UK.

The pound sterling is also the official currency of the British overseas territories of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands, British Antarctic Territory and Tristan da Cunha. South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands produces occasional special collectors&#x27; sets of coins. In 2008, British Antarctic Territory issued a £2 coin commemorating the centenary of Britain&#x27;s claim to the region.

The currencies of the British overseas territories of Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands and Saint Helena/Ascension — namely the Gibraltar pound, Falkland Islands pound and Saint Helena pound — are pegged one-to-one to the pound sterling but are technically separate currencies. These territories issue their own coinage, again with the same denominations and specifications as the UK coinage but with local designs, as coins of the Gibraltar pound, coins of the Falkland Islands pound and coins of the Saint Helena pound.

The other British overseas territories do not use sterling as their official currency.

==Pre-decimal coinage==


===System===
Before decimalisation in 1971, the pound was divided into 240 pence rather than 100, though it was rarely expressed in this way. Rather it was expressed in terms of pounds, shillings and pence, where:

* £1 = 20 shillings (20s).
* 1 shilling = 12 pence (12d).

Thus: £1 = 240d. The penny was further subdivided at various times, though these divisions vanished as inflation made them irrelevant:

* 1 penny = 2 halfpennies and (earlier) 4 farthings (half farthing, a third of a farthing, and quarter farthing coins were minted in the late 19th century, and into the early 20th century in the case of the third farthing, but circulated only in certain British colonies and not in the UK).

Using the example of five shillings and sixpence, the standard ways of writing shillings and pence were:
* 5s 6d
* 5/6
* 5/- for 5 shillings only, with the dash to stand for zero pennies.

The sum of 5/6 would be spoken as &quot;five shillings and sixpence&quot; or &quot;five and six&quot;.

The abbreviation for the old penny, d, was derived from the Roman &quot;denarius&quot;, and the abbreviation for the shilling, s, from the Roman &quot;solidus&quot;. The shilling was also denoted by the slash symbol, also called a solidus for this reason, which was originally an adaptation of the long s. The symbol &quot;£&quot;, for the pound, is derived from the first letter of the Latin word for pound, &quot;libra&quot;.

A similar pre-decimal system operated in France, also based on the Roman currency, consisting of the &quot;livre&quot; (L), &quot;sol&quot; or &quot;sou&quot; (s) and &quot;denier&quot; (d). Until 1816 another similar system was used in the Netherlands, consisting of the &quot;gulden&quot; (G), &quot;stuiver&quot; (s;  G) and &quot;duit&quot;, (d;  s or  G).

===Denominations===
In the years just prior to decimalisation, the circulating British coins were:

The farthing (d) had been demonetised on 1 January 1961, whilst the crown (5/-) was issued periodically as a commemorative coin but rarely found in circulation.

The crown, half crown, florin, shilling, and sixpence were cupronickel coins (in historical times silver or silver alloy); the penny, halfpenny, and farthing were bronze; and the threepence was a twelve-sided nickel-brass coin (historically it was a small silver coin).

Some of the pre-decimalisation coins with exact decimal equivalent values continued in use after 1971 alongside the new coins, albeit with new names (the shilling became equivalent to the 5p coin, with the florin equating to 10p), and the others were withdrawn almost immediately. The use of florins and shillings as legal tender in this way ended in 1991 and 1993 when the 5p and 10p coins were replaced with smaller versions. Indeed, while pre-decimalisation shillings were used as 5p coins, for a while after decimalisation many people continued to call the new 5p coin a shilling, since it remained of a pound, but was now counted as 5p (five new pence) instead of 12d (twelve old pennies). The pre-decimalisation sixpence, also known as a sixpenny bit or sixpenny piece, was equivalent to p, but was demonetised in 1980.


===Slang and everyday usage===
Some pre-decimalisation coins or denominations became commonly known by colloquial and slang terms, perhaps the most well known being &quot;bob&quot; for a shilling, and &quot;quid&quot; for a pound. A farthing was a &quot;mag&quot;, a silver threepence was a &quot;joey&quot; and the later nickel-brass threepence was called a &quot;threepenny bit&quot; ( or bit, i.e. thrup&#x27;ny or threp&#x27;ny bit – the apostrophe was pronounced on a scale from full &quot;e&quot; down to complete omission); a sixpence was a &quot;tanner&quot;, the two-shilling coin or florin was a &quot;two-bob bit&quot;. Bob is still used in phrases such as &quot;earn/worth a bob or two&quot;, and &quot;bob‐a‐job week&quot;. The two shillings and sixpence coin or half-crown was a &quot;half-dollar&quot;, also sometimes referred to as &quot;two and a kick&quot;. A value of two pence was universally pronounced &quot;tuppence&quot;, a usage which is still heard today, especially among older people. The unaccented suffix &quot;-pence&quot;, pronounced , was similarly appended to the other numbers up to twelve; thus &quot;fourpence&quot;, &quot;sixpence-three-farthings&quot;, &quot;twelvepence-ha&#x27;penny&quot;, but &quot;eighteen pence&quot; would usually be said &quot;one-and-six&quot;.

&quot;Quid&quot; remains as popular slang for one or more pounds to this day in Britain in the form &quot;a quid&quot; and then &quot;two quid&quot;, and so on. Similarly, in some parts of the country, &quot;bob&quot; continued to represent one-twentieth of a pound, that is five new pence, and &quot;two bob&quot; is 10p.

The introduction of decimal currency caused a new casual usage to emerge, where any value in pence is spoken using the suffix &quot;pee&quot;: e.g. &quot;twenty-three pee&quot; or, in the early years, &quot;two-and-a-half pee&quot; rather than the previous &quot;tuppence-ha&#x27;penny&quot;. Amounts over a pound are normally spoken thus: &quot;five pounds forty&quot;. A value with less than ten pence over the pound is sometimes spoken like this: &quot;one pound and a penny&quot;, &quot;three pounds and fourpence&quot;. The slang term &quot;bit&quot; has almost disappeared from use completely, although in Scotland a fifty pence is sometimes referred to as a &quot;ten bob bit&quot;. Decimal denomination coins are generally described using the terms &quot;piece&quot; or coin, for example, &quot;a fifty-pee piece&quot;, a &quot;ten-pence coin&quot;.

===Monarch&#x27;s profile===
All coins since the late 17th century have featured a profile of the current monarch&#x27;s head. The direction in which they face changes with each successive monarch, a pattern that began with the Stuarts, as shown in the table below:

For the Tudors and the Stuarts up to and including Charles II, both left- and right-facing portrait images were minted within the reign of a single monarch (left-facing images were more common), together with equestrian portraits on certain coins and (earlier) full face portrait images. In the Middle Ages, portrait images tended to be full face.

There was a small quirk in this alternating pattern when Edward VIII became king in January 1936 and was portrayed facing left, the same as his predecessor George V. This was because Edward thought his left side to be better than his right. However, Edward VIII abdicated in December 1936 and his coins were never put into general circulation. When George VI came to the throne, he had his coins struck with him facing the left, as if Edward VIII&#x27;s coins had faced right (as they should have done according to tradition). Thus, in a timeline of circulating British coins, George V and VI&#x27;s coins both feature left-facing portraits, although they follow directly chronologically.

===Regal titles===
From a very early date, British coins have been inscribed with the name of the ruler of the kingdom in which they were produced, and a longer or shorter title, always in Latin; among the earliest distinctive English coins are the silver pennies of Offa of Mercia, which were inscribed with the legend &quot;King Offa&quot;. As the legends became longer, words in the inscriptions were often abbreviated so that they could fit on the coin; identical legends have often been abbreviated in different ways depending upon the size and decoration of the coin. Inscriptions which go around the edge of the coin generally have started at the centre of the top edge and proceeded in a clockwise direction. A very lengthy legend would be continued on the reverse side of the coin. All monarchs used Latinised names, save Edward III and Edward VI, both Elizabeths, and Charles III (which would have been EDWARDUS, ELIZABETHA, and CAROLUS respectively).

===Coins in the colonies===
Some coins made for circulation in the British colonies are considered part of British coinage because they have no indication of what country it was minted for and they were made in the same style as contemporary coins circulating in the United Kingdom.

A three halfpence ( pence, of a pound) coin was circulated mainly in the West Indies and Ceylon in the starting in 1834. Jamaicans referred to the coin as a &quot;quatty&quot;.

The half farthing ( of a penny, of a pound) coin was initially minted in 1828 for use in Ceylon, but was declared legal tender in the United Kingdom in 1842.

The third farthing ( of a penny, of a pound) coin was minted for use in Malta, starting in 1827.

The quarter farthing ( of a penny, of a pound) coin was minted for use in Ceylon starting in 1839.

==Mottos==
In addition to the title, a Latin or French motto might be included, generally on the reverse side of the coin. These varied between denominations and issues; some were personal to the monarch, others were more general. Some of the mottos were:

* &quot;I have made God my helper&quot;. Coins of Henry VII, Henry VIII, Elizabeth I. Possibly refers to Psalm 52:7, &quot;Ecce homo qui non-posuit Deum adjutorem suum&quot; &quot;Behold the man who did not make God his helper&quot;.
* &quot;A dazzling rose without a thorn&quot;. Coins of Henry VIII and Edward VI. Initially on the unsuccessful and very rare Crown of the Rose of Henry VIII and continued on subsequent small gold coinage into the reign of Edward VI.
* &quot;We have made God our helper&quot;. Coins of Philip and Mary. The same as above, but with a plural subject.
* &quot;I shall make them into one nation&quot;. Coins of James I, signifying his desire to unite the English and Scottish nations. Refers to Ezekiel 37:22 in the Vulgate Bible.
* &quot;I reign with Christ as my protector&quot;. Coins of Charles I.
* &quot;May God rise up, may [his] enemies be scattered&quot;. Coins of Charles I, during the Civil War. Refers to Psalm 67:1 in the Vulgate Bible (Psalm 68 in English Bible numbering).
* &quot;Peace is sought by war&quot;. Coins of the Protectorate; personal motto of Oliver Cromwell.
* &quot;Britain&quot;. Reign of Charles II to George III. Found on pennies and smaller denominations.
* . &quot;Shamed be he who thinks ill of it.&quot; Sovereigns of George III. Motto of the Order of the Garter.
* . &quot;An ornament and a safeguard.&quot; Some pound coins of Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and some crown coins including some of Victoria and George V. Refers to the inscribed edge as a protection against the clipping of precious metal, as well as being a complimentary reference to the monarch and the monarchy.

==Minting errors reaching circulation==

Coins with errors in the minting process that reach circulation are often seen as valuable items by coin collectors.

In 1983, the Royal Mint mistakenly produced some two pence pieces with the old wording &quot;New Pence&quot; on the reverse (tails) side, when the design had been changed from 1982 to &quot;Two Pence&quot;.

In 2016, a batch of double-dated £1 coins was released into circulation. These coins had the main date on the obverse as &#x27;2016&#x27;, but micro-engraving on the reverse dated as &#x27;2017&#x27;. It is not known how many exist and are in circulation, but the amount is fewer than half a million.

In June 2009, the Royal Mint estimated that between 50,000 and 200,000 dateless 20 pence coins had entered circulation, the first undated British coin to enter circulation in more than 300 years. It resulted from the accidental combination of old and new face tooling in a production batch, creating what is known as a mule, following the 2008 redesign which moved the date from the reverse (tails) to the obverse (heads) side.

<text>Melvin Kranzberg (November 22, 1917 – December 6, 1995) was an American historian, and professor of history at Case Western Reserve University from 1952 until 1971. He was a Callaway professor of the history of technology at Georgia Tech from 1972 to 1988.

Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Kranzberg graduated from Amherst College, received a master&#x27;s and a Ph.D. from Harvard University and served in the U.S. Army in Europe during World War II. He received a Bronze Star for interrogating captured German prisoners and learning the location of Nazi gun emplacements. He was one of two interrogators out of nine in Patton&#x27;s army who were not killed during the conflict. He received his interrogation training at Camp Ritchie in Maryland, making him one of the Ritchie Boys.

Kranzberg is known for his laws of technology, the first of which states &quot;Technology is neither good nor bad; &quot;nor is it neutral&quot;.&quot;

He was one of the founders of the Society for the History of Technology in the United States and long-time editor of its journal &quot;Technology and Culture&quot;. Kranzberg served as president of the society from 1983 to 1984, and edited the society&#x27;s journal from 1959 to 1981, when he turned it over to Robert C. Post of the Smithsonian Institution. The society awards a yearly $4000 fellowship named after Kranzberg to doctoral students engaged in the preparation of dissertations on the history of technology. The award is available to students all over the world. In 1967 Kranzberg was awarded the Leonardo da Vinci Medal by the Society for the History of Technology.

Howard P. Segal wrote an informative semi-biographical tribute to Kranzberg in the Virginia Quarterly Review.

There are two biographical articles by Robert C. Post in Technology and Culture:
* &quot;Back at the Start: History and Technology and Culture,&quot; T&amp;C 51 (2010): 961–94
* &quot;Chance and Contingency: Putting Mel Kranzberg in Context,&quot; T&amp;C 50 (2009): 839–72.

Kranzberg helped found the International Committee for the History of Technology.

==Kranzberg&#x27;s laws of technology==
Melvin Kranzberg&#x27;s six laws of technology state:

#Technology is neither good nor bad; nor is it neutral.
#Invention is the mother of necessity.
#Technology comes in packages, big and small.
#Although technology might be a prime element in many public issues, nontechnical factors take precedence in technology-policy decisions.
#All history is relevant, but the history of technology is the most relevant.
#Technology is a very human activity – and so is the history of technology.

<text>Open systems are computer systems that provide some combination of interoperability, portability, and open software standards. (It can also refer to specific installations that are configured to allow unrestricted access by people and/or other computers; this article does not discuss that meaning).

The term was popularized in the early 1980s, mainly to describe systems based on Unix, especially in contrast to the more entrenched mainframes and minicomputers in use at that time. Unlike older legacy systems, the newer generation of Unix systems featured standardized programming interfaces and peripheral interconnects; third party development of hardware and software was encouraged, a significant departure from the norm of the time, which saw companies such as Amdahl and Hitachi going to court for the right to sell systems and peripherals that were compatible with IBM&#x27;s mainframes.

The definition of &quot;open system&quot; can be said to have become more formalized in the 1990s with the emergence of independently administered software standards such as The Open Group&#x27;s Single UNIX Specification.

Although computer users today are used to a high degree of both hardware and software interoperability, in the 20th century the open systems concept could be promoted by Unix vendors as a significant differentiator. IBM and other companies resisted the trend for decades, exemplified by a now-famous warning in 1991 by an IBM account executive that one should be &quot;careful about getting locked into open systems&quot;.

However, in the first part of the 21st century many of these same legacy system vendors, particularly IBM and Hewlett-Packard, began to adopt Linux as part of their overall sales strategy, with &quot;open source&quot; marketed as trumping &quot;open system&quot;. Consequently, an IBM mainframe with Linux on IBM Z is marketed as being more of an open system than commodity computers using closed-source Microsoft Windows—or even those using Unix, despite its open systems heritage. In response, more companies are opening the source code to their products, with a notable example being Sun Microsystems and their creation of the OpenOffice.org and OpenSolaris projects, based on their formerly closed-source StarOffice and Solaris software products.

<doc id="39230" wikidata="Q5152578" url="?curid=39230" title="Charles Pierce (female impersonator)">
<text>Charles Pierce (July 14, 1926 – May 31, 1999) was one of the 20th century&#x27;s foremost female impersonators, particularly noted for his impersonation of Bette Davis.

==Life and career==
Born in Watertown, New York, he began his show business career playing the organ and acting in radio dramas at station WWNY. He branched out into a comedy routine, attired in tuxedo, yet managing to evoke eerily convincing imitations of popular movie actresses. Eschewing the term drag queen, which he hated, he billed himself as a male actress.

Initially playing in small gay clubs, his fame spread. He took up residence in San Francisco, where his act became well known to Hollywood stars. As he toured, his costuming became more elaborate, initially adding small props, later full costume and makeup changes. His imitations were imitated by other female impersonators, and his roles included Bette Davis, Mae West, Tallulah Bankhead, Gloria Swanson, Carol Channing, Katharine Hepburn, and Joan Crawford, and these roles became the drag queen canon. His act was centered on wit rather than mimicry; however, it often was said that he looked more like Joan Collins than Joan Collins herself.

Carol Channing was one of two Hollywood celebrities Pierce &quot;impersonated&quot; who actually saw his act. She went backstage after a show at Gold Street in San Francisco (c. 1972) and said &quot;Cheee-yarles: you do me better than I do!&quot; The other star was Bette Davis who was snuck into the Studio One Backlot to see his show in the late 1970s. According to Pierce&#x27;s longtime stage manager and dresser Kirk Frederick in his 2016 authorized Pierce biography, Davis was unimpressed with Pierce&#x27;s portrayal and refused to go backstage after the show to greet Charles, saying &quot;There is only one female impersonator who does me right, and his name is Arthur Blake.&quot; Pierce was never told Davis had attended the show. Shortly after the incident, Pierce was introduced to Davis at a private event through Geraldine Fitzgerald, a mutual friend. Frederick reports that Davis brushed off Pierce with the same reference to Blake but didn&#x27;t mention attending the show.

He performed at many clubs in New York, including The Village Gate, Ted Hook&#x27;s OnStage, The Ballroom, and Freddy&#x27;s Supper Club. His numerous San Francisco venues included the Gilded Cage, Cabaret/After Dark, Gold Street, Bimbo&#x27;s 365 Club, Olympus, The Plush Room, the Venetian Room at the Fairmont Hotel, Louise M. Davies Symphony Hall, and the War Memorial Opera House.

He was a guest actor on an episode of TV&#x27;s &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; and played a cross-dressing villain in an episode of &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; (&quot;Murder on the Moose Jaw Express&quot;). Thanks in part to his good friend actress Dixie Carter, Pierce also appeared on an early episode of the sitcom &quot;Designing Women&quot; as a steward on a cruise ship. During the episode, he imitates Joan Collins (as the ship&#x27;s waitress) and Bette Davis (as the ship&#x27;s lounge entertainment). As Davis, he quips: &quot;Was that Joan Collins hustling the tables? One bitch on this boat is enough!&quot;

He died in North Hollywood, California, aged 72, and was cremated. His memorial service at Forest Lawn Memorial Park was carefully planned and scripted by Pierce before his death. Among those attending his memorial was his friend Bea Arthur, who closed with &quot;I’ll See You Again.&quot; His ashes were interred in the Columbarium of Providence, Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles, California.

In Bea Arthur&#x27;s Tony Award-nominated one-woman show, &quot;Just Between Friends&quot;, which she played on Broadway and in London&#x27;s West End, Arthur performed &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Ingenuity&quot;, Pierce&#x27;s favorite joke. It can be heard in the cast recording.

<doc id="39235" wikidata="Q453771" url="?curid=39235" title="Albrecht III Achilles">
<text>Albrecht III (9 November 141411 March 1486) was Elector of Brandenburg from 1471 until his death, the third from the House of Hohenzollern. A member of the Order of the Swan, he received the cognomen Achilles because of his knightly qualities and virtues. He also ruled in the Franconian principalities of Ansbach from 1440 and Kulmbach from 1464 (as Albrecht I).

==Biography==
===Early life===
Albrecht was born at the Brandenburg residence of Tangermünde as the third son of the Nuremberg burgrave Frederick I and his wife, the Wittelsbach princess Elisabeth of Bavaria-Landshut. His father served as governor in Brandenburg; a few months after Albrecht&#x27;s birth, he was enfeoffed with the electorate at the Council of Constance by the Luxembourg emperor Sigismund.

After passing some time at the court of Emperor Sigismund, Albrecht took part in the Hussite Wars, and afterwards distinguished himself whilst assisting Sigismund&#x27;s successor, the Habsburg king Albert II of Germany, against the Hussites and their Polish allies. In 1435, he and his eldest brother John went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.

===Reign in Franconia===
On the division of territory which followed his father&#x27;s death in 1440, Albrecht received the Principality of Ansbach, while John took over the rule of Brandenburg as its elector. Although Albrecht&#x27;s resources were meager, he soon took a leading place among the German princes and was especially prominent in resisting the attempts of the towns to obtain self-government.

Nevertheless, Albrecht&#x27;s plans to re-unite the former Duchy of Franconia under his rule failed: in 1443, he formed a league directed mainly against the Imperial City of Nuremberg, over which his late father had formerly exercised the rights of burgrave. It was not until 1448, however, that he found a pretext for attack. After initial military successes in the First Margrave War, he was defeated at the Battle of Pillenreuther Weiher, resulting in the Treaty of Bamberg (22 June 1450), which forced Albrecht to return all of the conquered territory and to recognize the independence of Nuremberg and its associated towns.

Albrecht supported the Habsburg emperor Frederick III in his struggle with the princes who desired reforms in the Holy Roman Empire, and in return for this loyalty received many marks of favour from Frederick, including extensive judicial rights which aroused considerable irritation among neighbouring rulers.

In 1457, Albrecht arranged a marriage between his eldest son John, and Margaret, daughter of William III, Landgrave of Thuringia, who inherited the claims upon Hungary and Bohemia of her mother, a granddaughter of Emperor Sigismund. The attempt to secure these thrones for the Hohenzollerns through this marriage failed, and a similar fate befell Albrecht&#x27;s efforts to revive in his own favour the disused title of duke of Franconia.

The sharp dissensions which existed among the princes over the question of reform culminated in the Bavarian War from 1459 to 1463, when Albrecht was confronted with a league under the leadership of Elector Palatine Frederick I and his Wittelsbach cousin Duke Louis IX of Bavaria-Landshut. Though defeated in the struggle, Albrecht continued fighting against Prince-bishop Rudolf II of Würzburg and even forged an alliance with his former enemy, the Bohemian king George of Poděbrady, a step which caused Pope Paul II to place him under the ban.

Albrecht permanently resided at Ansbach from 1460; he also inherited the Principality of Kulmbach upon the death of his brother John in 1464.

===Brandenburg elector===
In 1471, Albrecht became Elector of Brandenburg, owing to the abdication of his remaining brother, Elector Frederick II, the year before. Now sole ruler over the entire Hohenzollern estates, he was soon actively engaged in their administration. By the 1472 Treaty of Prenzlau he ended the War of the Succession of Stettin, bringing the Duchy of Pomerania also under his supremacy.

Having established his right to levy a tonnage on wines in the mark, he issued in February 1473 the &quot;Dispositio Achillea&quot;, which decreed that the Margraviate of Brandenburg should descend in its entirety to the eldest son, while the younger sons should receive the Franconian possessions of the family. After treating in vain for a marriage between one of his sons and Mary of Burgundy, daughter and heiress of Duke Charles the Bold, Albrecht handed over the government of Brandenburg to his eldest son John Cicero, and returned to his Franconian possessions.

Albrecht&#x27;s main attention afterwards was claimed by the business of the empire. Seriously ill, he took part in the imperial election of 1486 which selected Maximilian of Austria as King of the Romans at Frankfurt Cathedral. A few weeks later, in March, Albrecht died while still staying in Frankfurt; he was buried in the Heilsbronn Abbey church near Ansbach. He left a considerable amount of treasure.

==Family and children==

Albrecht was married twice. First, he married 12 November 1446 Margaret of Baden, daughter of Margrave Jakob I of Baden and Catherine of Lorraine. From this marriage he had following children:
# Wolfgang, born and died in 1450.
# Ursula (25 September 145025 October 1508, Breslau), married Duke Henry I, Duke of Münsterberg-Oels.
# Elisabeth, (29 October 1451, Ansbach28 March 1524, Nürtingen), married Eberhard II, Duke of Württemberg.

# Friedrich, died young.
# John Cicero, Elector of Brandenburg (2 August 14559 January 1499).

Margaret died 24 October 1457 and in 1458 Albrecht married Anna, daughter of Frederick II, Elector of Saxony and Margarete of Austria. Their children were:
# Frederick I, (German: Friedrich II. von Brandenburg-Ansbach-Kulmbach or Friedrich der Ältere; 1460–1536), Margrave in Ansbach since 1486 and Bayreuth since 1495.
# Amalie (1 October 1461, Plassenburg3 September 1481, Baden-Baden), married Kaspar, Count Palatine of Zweibrücken.
# Anna, born and died in 1462.

# Siegmund, Margrave in Bayreuth, (27 September 1468, Ansbach26 February 1495, Ansbach).
# Albrecht, born and died in 1470.
# Georg (30 December 1472, Berlin5 December 1476, Kadolzburg).
# Dorothea (12 December 1471, Berlin13 February 1520, Bamberg), Abbess in Bamberg.
# Elisabeth (8 April 1474, Ansbach25 April 1507, Römhild), married Count Hermann VIII of Henneberg-Aschach (1470–1535)
# Magdalene (29 July 1476, Berlinbefore 4 February 1480).
# Anastasia (14 March 1478, Ansbach4 July 1534, Ilmenau), married Count William IV of Henneberg-Schleusingen (1478–1559)

===Dynastic marriages of his children===
In 1474, Albrecht married his daughter Barbara to Duke Henry XI of Głogów, who left his possessions on his death in 1476 to his widow with reversion to her family, an arrangement which was resisted by Henry&#x27;s kinsman, Duke Jan II of Żagań. Aided by King Matthias Corvinus of Hungary, Jan of Żagań invaded Brandenburg, and the Pomeranians seized the opportunity to revolt. Under these circumstances Albrecht returned to Brandenburg in 1478, compelled the Pomeranians to recognize his supremacy, and, after a stubborn struggle, secured a part of Duke Henry&#x27;s lands for his daughter in 1482.

<text>The Israel Defense Forces (IDF; , ), alternatively referred to by the Hebrew-language acronym  (), is the national military of the State of Israel. It consists of three service branches: the Israeli Ground Forces, the Israeli Air Force, and the Israeli Navy. It is the sole military wing of the Israeli security apparatus. The IDF is headed by the Chief of the General Staff, who is subordinate to the Israeli Defense Minister.

On the orders of first prime minister David Ben-Gurion, the IDF was formed on 26 May 1948 and began to operate as a conscript military, drawing its initial recruits from the already-existing paramilitaries of the Yishuv—namely Haganah, the Irgun, and Lehi. It was formed shortly after the Israeli Declaration of Independence and has participated in every armed conflict involving Israel. In the wake of the 1979 Egypt–Israel peace treaty and the 1994 Israel–Jordan peace treaty, the IDF underwent a significant strategic realignment. Previously spread across various fronts—Lebanon and Syria in the north, Jordan and Iraq in the east, and Egypt in the south—the IDF redirected its focus towards southern Lebanon and the Palestinian territories. In 2000, the IDF withdrew from Southern Lebanon and in 2005 from Gaza. Conflict between Israel and Islamist groups based in Gaza, notably Hamas, has continued since then. Moreover, notable Israeli–Syrian border incidents have occurred frequently since 2011, due to regional instability caused by the Syrian civil war.

Since 1967, the IDF has maintained a close security relationship with the United States, including in research and development cooperation, with joint efforts on the F-15I and the Arrow defence system, among others. The IDF is believed to have maintained an operational nuclear weapons capability since 1967, possibly possessing between 80 and 400 nuclear warheads. The IDF’s actions and policies in the Palestinian territories have faced widespread criticism, with accusations of repression, discrimination, and abuses of Palestinian rights.

==Etymology==
The Israeli cabinet ratified the name &quot;Israel Defense Forces&quot; (), &quot;Tzva HaHagana LeYisra&#x27;el&quot;, literally &quot;the army for the defence of Israel,&quot; on 26 May 1948. The other main contender was &quot;Tzva Yisra&#x27;el&quot; (). The name was chosen because it conveyed the idea that the army&#x27;s role was defence and incorporated the name Haganah, the pre-state defensive organization upon which the new army was based. Among the primary opponents of the name were Minister Haim-Moshe Shapira and the Hatzohar party, both in favor of &quot;Tzva Yisra&#x27;el&quot;.

==History==



The IDF traces its roots to Jewish paramilitary organizations in the New Yishuv, starting with the Second Aliyah (1904 to 1914). There had been several such organizations, or in part even older date, such as the &quot;Mahane Yehuda&quot; mounted guards company founded by Michael Halperin in 1891 (see Ness Ziona), HaMagen (1915–17), HaNoter (1912–13; see Zionism: Pre-state self-defense), and the much more consequential (but falsely-claimed &quot;first&quot; such organization), Bar-Giora, founded in September 1907. Bar-Giora was transformed into Hashomer in April 1909, which operated until the British Mandate of Palestine came into being in 1920. Hashomer was an elitist organization with a narrow scope and was mainly created to protect against criminal gangs seeking to steal property. The Zion Mule Corps and the Jewish Legion, both part of the British Army of World War I, further bolstered the Yishuv with military experience and manpower, forming the basis for later paramilitary forces.

After the 1920 Palestine riots against Jews in April 1920, the Yishuv leadership realized the need for a nationwide underground defence organization, and the Haganah was founded in June 1920. The Haganah became a full-scale defence force after the 1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine with an organized structure, consisting of three main units—the Field Corps, Guard Corps, and the Palmach. During World War II, the Yishuv participated in the British war effort, culminating in the formation of the Jewish Brigade. These would eventually form the backbone of the Israel Defense Forces, and provide it with its initial manpower and doctrine.

Following Israel&#x27;s Declaration of Independence, Prime Minister and Defense Minister David Ben-Gurion issued an order for the formation of the Israel Defense Forces on 26 May 1948. Although Ben-Gurion had no legal authority to issue such an order, the order was made legal by the cabinet on 31 May. The same order called for the disbandment of all other Jewish armed forces. The two other Jewish underground organizations, Irgun and Lehi, agreed to join the IDF if they would be able to form independent units and agreed not to make independent arms purchases. This was the background for the Altalena Affair, a confrontation surrounding weapons purchased by the Irgun resulting in a standoff between Irgun members and the newly created IDF. The affair came to an end when &quot;Altalena&quot;, the ship carrying the arms, was shelled by the IDF. Following the affair, all independent Irgun and Lehi units were either disbanded or merged into the IDF. The Palmach, a leading component of the Haganah, also joined the IDF with provisions, and Ben Gurion responded by disbanding its staff in 1949, after which many senior Palmach officers retired, notably its first commander, Yitzhak Sadeh.

The new army organized itself when the 1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine escalated into the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, which saw neighbouring Arab states attack. Twelve infantry and armoured brigades formed: Golani, Carmeli, Alexandroni, Kiryati, Givati, Etzioni, the 7th, and 8th armoured brigades, Oded, Harel, Yiftach, and the Negev. After the war, some of the brigades were converted to reserve units, and others were disbanded. Directorates and corps were created from corps and services in the Haganah, and this basic structure in the IDF still exists today.

Immediately after the 1948 war, the Israel-Palestinian conflict shifted to a low-intensity conflict between the IDF and Palestinian fedayeen. In the 1956 Suez Crisis, the IDF&#x27;s first serious test of strength after 1949, the new army captured the Sinai Peninsula from Egypt, which was later returned. In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel conquered the Sinai Peninsula, Gaza Strip, West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and Golan Heights from the surrounding Arab states, changing the balance of power in the region as well as the role of the IDF. In the following years leading up to the Yom Kippur War, the IDF fought in the War of Attrition against Egypt in the Sinai and a border war against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) in Jordan, culminating in the Battle of Karameh.

The surprise of the Yom Kippur War and its aftermath completely changed the IDF&#x27;s procedures and approach to warfare. Organizational changes were made and more time was dedicated to training for conventional warfare. However, in the following years the army&#x27;s role slowly shifted again to low-intensity conflict, urban warfare and counter-terrorism. An example of the latter was the successful 1976 Operation Entebbe commando raid to free hijacked airline passengers being held captive in Uganda. During this era, the IDF also mounted a successful bombing mission in Iraq to destroy its nuclear reactor. It was involved in the Lebanese Civil War, initiating Operation Litani and later the 1982 Lebanon War, where the IDF ousted Palestinian guerrilla organizations from Lebanon.

For twenty-five years the IDF maintained a security zone inside South Lebanon with their allies the South Lebanon Army. Palestinian militancy has been the main focus of the IDF ever since, especially during the First and Second Intifadas, Operation Defensive Shield, the Gaza War (2008–2009), the 2012 Gaza War, the 2014 Gaza War, and the 2021 Israel-Palestine crisis, causing the IDF to change many of its values and publish the IDF Code of Ethics. The Lebanese Shia organization Hezbollah has also been a growing threat, against which the IDF fought an asymmetric conflict between 1982 and 2000, as well as a full-scale war in 2006.

The Israel Defense Forces have been accused of committing various war crimes since the founding of Israel in 1948. Israel ratified the Geneva Conventions on July 6, 1951, and on January 2, 2015, the State of Palestine acceded to the Rome Statute, granting the International Criminal Court (ICC) jurisdiction over war crimes committed in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). A 2017 report by Human Rights Watch accused the IDF of unlawful killings, using excessive force in policing situations, forced displacement, excessive use of detention and excessive restrictions on movement, as well as criticized the IDF&#x27;s support and protection for Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory.
Human rights experts argue that actions taken by the IDF during armed conflicts in the OPT fall under the rubric of war crimes. Various UN special rapporteurs, alongside human rights and aid organizations including Human Rights Watch, Médecins Sans Frontières, Amnesty International, have accused Israel of war crimes.

==Organization==

All branches of the IDF answer to a single General Staff. The Chief of the General Staff is the only serving officer having the rank of Lieutenant General (&quot;Rav Aluf&quot;). He reports directly to the Defense Minister and indirectly to the Prime Minister of Israel and the cabinet. Chiefs of Staff are formally appointed by the cabinet, based on the Defense Minister&#x27;s recommendation, for three years. The government can vote to extend their service to four, and on rare occasions even five years. The current chief of staff is Herzi Halevi.

=== Ranks ===

 Unlike most militaries, the IDF uses the same rank names in all corps, including the air force and navy.

From the formation of the IDF until the late 1980s, sergeant major was a particularly important warrant officer rank, in line with usage in other armies. In the 1980s and 1990s the proliferating ranks of sergeant major became devalued, and now all professional non-commissioned officer ranks are a variation on sergeant major (&quot;rav samal&quot;) except for &quot;rav nagad&quot;.

=== Uniforms ===

The Israel Defense Forces has several types of uniforms:
* Service dress (מדי אלף &quot;Madei Alef&quot; – Uniform &quot;A&quot;) – the everyday uniform, worn by everybody.
* Field dress (מדי ב &quot;Madei Bet&quot; – Uniform &quot;B&quot;) – worn into combat, training, work on base.
The first two resemble each other but the Madei Alef is made of higher quality materials in a golden olive while the madei bet is in olive drab. The dress uniforms may also exhibit a surface shine
* Officers / Ceremonial dress (מדי שרד &quot;madei srad&quot;) – worn by officers, or during special events/ceremonies.
* Dress uniform and mess dress – worn only abroad. Several dress uniforms are depending on the season and the branch.

The service uniform for all ground forces personnel is olive green; navy and air force uniforms are beige/tan (also once worn by the ground forces). The uniforms consist of a two-pocket shirt, combat trousers, sweater, jacket or blouse, and shoes or boots. The navy also has an all-white dress uniform. The green fatigues are the same for winter and summer and heavy winter gear is issued as needed. Women&#x27;s dress parallels the men&#x27;s but may substitute a skirt for trousers and a blouse for a shirt.

Headgear included a service cap for dress and semi-dress and a field cap or &quot;Kova raful&quot; bush hat worn with fatigues. Many IDF personnel once wore the tembel as a field hat. IDF personnel generally wear berets instead of the service cap and there are many beret colours issued to IDF personnel. Paratroopers are issued a maroon beret, Golani brown, Givati purple, Nahal lime green, Kfir camouflage, Combat Engineers grey, navy blue for IDF Naval and dark grey for IDF Air Force personnel.

In combat uniforms, the Orlite helmet has replaced the British Brodie helmet Mark II/Mark III, RAC Mk II modified helmet with chin web jump harness (used by paratroopers and similar to the HSAT Mk II/Mk III paratrooper helmets), US M1 helmet, and French Modèle 1951 helmet – previously worn by Israeli infantry and airborne troops from the late 1940s to the mid-1970s and early 1980s.

Some corps or units have small variations in their uniforms – for instance, military police wear a white belt and police hat, Naval personnel have dress whites for parades, paratroopers are issued a four pocket tunic (yarkit/yerkit) worn untucked with a pistol belt cinched tight around the waist over the shirt. The IDF Air Corps has a dress uniform consisting of a pale blue shirt with dark blue trousers.

Most IDF soldiers are issued black leather combat boots, certain units issue reddish-brown leather boots for historical reasons — the paratroopers, combat medics, Nahal and Kfir Brigades, as well as some Special Forces units (Sayeret Matkal, Oketz, Duvdevan, Maglan, and the Counter-Terror School). Women were also formerly issued sandals, but this practice has ceased.

=== Insignia ===

IDF soldiers have three types of insignia (other than rank insignia) which identify their corps, specific unit, and position. A pin attached to the beret identifies a soldier&#x27;s corps. Individual units are identified by a shoulder tag attached to the left shoulder strap. The position/job of a soldier can then be identified by an aiguillette attached to the left shoulder strap and shirt pocket, and a pin indicating the soldier&#x27;s work type.

==Service==
===Military service routes===

The military service is held in three different tracks:
* Regular service (שירות חובה): mandatory military service which is held according to the Israeli security service law.
* Permanent service (שירות קבע): military service which is held as part of a contractual agreement between the IDF and the permanent position-holder.
* Reserve service (שירות מילואים): a military service in which citizens are called for active duty of at most a month every year (in accordance with the Reserve Service Law), for training and ongoing military activities and especially to increase the military forces in case of a war.

Sometimes the IDF would also hold pre-military courses (קורס קדם צבאי or קד&quot;צ) for soon-to-be regular service soldiers.

===Special service routes===
* Shoher (שוחר), a person enrolled in pre-military studies (high school, technical college up to engineering degree, some of the קד&quot;ץ courses) – after completing the twelfth study year will do a two-month boot-camp and, if allowed, enter a program of education to qualify as a practical engineer, with at least two weeks of training following each study year. Successful candidates will continue for an engineering bachelor degree.
* Civilian working for the IDF (), a civilian working for the military.

The Israeli Manpower Directorate () at the Israeli General Staff is the body which coordinates and assembles activities related to the control over human resources and its placement.

====Regular service====


National military service is mandatory for all Israeli citizens over the age of 18, although Arab (but not Druze) citizens are exempted if they so please, and other exceptions may be made on religious, physical or psychological grounds (see Profile 21). The Tal law exempted ultra-Orthodox Jews from service. In June 2024, Israel&#x27;s Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Haredi Jews were eligible for compulsory service, ending nearly eight decades of exemption. The army began drafting Haredi men the following month.

Until the draft of July 2015, men served three years in the IDF. Men drafted since July 2015 serve two years and eight months (32 months), with some roles requiring an additional four months of Permanent service. Women serve two years. The IDF women who volunteer for several combat positions often serve for three years, due to the longer period of training. Women in other positions, such as programmers, who also require lengthy training time, may also serve three years.

Many Religious Zionist men (and many Modern Orthodox who make Aliyah) elect to do Hesder, a five-year program envisioned by Rabbi Yehuda Amital which combines Torah learning and military service.

Some distinguished recruits are selected to be trained to eventually become members of special forces units. Every brigade in the IDF has its special force branch.

Career soldiers are paid on average NIS 23,000 a month. Conscripts are paid according to four tiers based on their positions. Frontline soldiers receive NIS 3,048 a month, other combat soldiers receive NIS 2,463, combat support soldiers receive NIS 1,793, and administrative soldiers receive NIS 1,235.

In 1998–2000, only about 9% of those who refused to serve in the Israeli military were granted an exemption.

====Permanent service====
Permanent service is designed for soldiers who choose to continue serving in the army after their regular service, for a short or long period, and in many cases making the military their career. Permanent service is based on a contractual agreement between the IDF and the permanent position holder.

====Reserve service====

After personnel complete their regular service, they are either granted permanent exemption from military service or assigned a position in the reserve forces. No distinction is made between the assignment of men and women to reserve service.

The IDF may call up reservists for:
* reserve service of up to one month every three years, until the age of 40 (enlisted) or 45 (officers). Reservists may volunteer after this age, with the approval of the Manpower Directorate.
* immediate active duty in wartime.

All Israelis who served in the IDF and are under the age of 40, unless otherwise exempt, are eligible for reserve duty. Only those who completed at least 20 days of reserve duty within the past three years are considered active reservists.

===Non-IDF service===
Other than the civil, i.e. non-military &quot;National Service&quot; (&quot;Sherut Leumi&quot;), IDF conscripts may serve in bodies other than the IDF in several ways.

The combat option is Israel Border Police (&quot;Magav&quot; – the exact translation from Hebrew means &quot;border guard&quot;) service, part of the Israel Police. Some soldiers complete their IDF combat training and later undergo additional counter terror and Border Police training. These are assigned to Border Police units. The Border Police units fight side by side with the regular IDF combat units though to a lower capacity. They are also responsible for security in heavy urban areas such as Jerusalem and security and crime fighting in rural areas.

Non-combat services include the (&quot;Shaham&quot;, שח&quot;מ) program, where youth serve in the Israeli Police, Israel Prison Service, or other wings of the Israeli Security Forces instead of the regular army service.

===Women===
Israel is one of only a few nations that conscript women or deploy them in combat roles, although in practice, women can avoid conscription through a religious exemption and over a third of Israeli women do so. As of 2010, 88% of all roles in the IDF are open to female candidates, and women could be found in 69% of all IDF positions.

According to the IDF, 535 female Israeli soldiers were killed during service in the period 1962–2016, and dozens before then. The IDF says that fewer than 4 percent of women are in combat positions. Rather, they are concentrated in &quot;combat-support&quot; positions which command a lower compensation and status than combat positions.

Civilian pilot and aeronautical engineer Alice Miller successfully petitioned the High Court of Justice to take the Israeli Air Force pilot training exams, after being rejected on grounds of gender. Though president Ezer Weizman, a former IAF commander, told Miller that she would be better off staying home and darning socks, the court eventually ruled in 1996 that the IAF could not exclude qualified women from pilot training. Even though Miller would not pass the exams, the ruling was a watershed, opening doors for women in new IDF roles. Female legislators took advantage of the momentum to draft a bill allowing women to volunteer for any position if they could qualify.

In 2000, the Equality Amendment to the Military Service law stated that the right of women to serve in any role in the IDF is equal to the right of men. Women have served in the military since before the founding of the state of Israel in 1948. Women started to enter combat support and light combat roles in a few areas, including the Artillery Corps, infantry units and armoured divisions. A few platoons named Karakal were formed for men and women to serve together in light infantry. By 2000, Karakal became a full-fledged battalion, with a second mixed-gender battalion, Lions of the Jordan (אריות הירדן, Arayot Ha-Yarden) formed in 2015. Many women also joined the Border Police.

In June 2011, Maj. General Orna Barbivai became the first female major general in the IDF, replacing the head of the directorate Maj. General Avi Zamir. Barbivai stated, &quot;I am proud to be the first woman to become a major general and to be part of an organization in which equality is a central principle. Ninety percent of jobs in the IDF are open to women and I am sure that other women will continue to break down barriers.&quot;

In 2013, the IDF announced they would, for the first time, allow a (MTF) transgender woman to serve in the army as a female soldier.

Elana Sztokman notes it would be &quot;difficult to claim that women are equals in the IDF&quot;. &quot;And tellingly, there is only one female general in the entire IDF,&quot; she adds. In 2012, religious soldiers claimed they were promised they would not have to listen to women sing or lecture, but IAF Chief Rabbi Moshe Raved resigned because male religious soldiers were being required to do so. In January 2015, three women IDF singers performed in one of the IDF&#x27;s units. The performance was first disrupted by fifteen religious soldiers, who left in protest and then the Master Sergeant forced the women to end the performance because it was disturbing the religious soldiers. An IDF spokesperson announced an investigation of the incident: &quot;We are aware of the incident and already begun examining it. The exclusion of women is not consistent with the values of the IDF.&quot;

Defense Minister Moshe Ya&#x27;alon has also arranged for women to be excluded from recruitment centres catering to religious males. As the IDF recruits more religious soldiers, the rights of male religious soldiers and women in the IDF come into conflict. Brig. Gen. Zeev Lehrer, who served on the chief of staff&#x27;s panel of the integration of women, noted &quot;There is a clear process of &#x27;religionization&#x27; in the army, and the story of the women is a central piece of it. There are very strong pressures at work to halt the process of integrating women into the army, and they are coming from the direction of religion.&quot;

Sex segregation is allowed in the IDF, which reached what it considers a &quot;new milestone&quot; in 2006, creating the first company of soldiers segregated in an all-female unit, the Nachshol (Hebrew for &quot;giant wave&quot;) Reconnaissance Company. &quot;We are the only unit in the world made up entirely of female combat soldiers,&quot; said Nachshol Company Commander Cpt. Dana Ben-Ezra. &quot;Our effectiveness and the dividends we earn are the factors by which we are measured, not our gender.&quot;

With the rise of social media platforms such as TikTok and Twitter, some critics claim that women in the IDF are frequently used as tools of propaganda, with official military accounts frequently posting attractive young women to create a sympathetic social media presence.

===Minorities in the IDF===
Non-Jewish minorities tended to serve in one of several special units: the Sword Battalion, also known as Unit 300 or the Minorities Unit, until it was disbanded in 2015; the Druze Reconnaissance Unit; and the Trackers Unit, composed mostly of Negev Bedouins. In 1982, the IDF general staff decided to integrate the armed forces by opening up other units to minorities, while placing some Jewish conscripts in the Minorities Unit. Until 1988, the Intelligence Corps and the Air Force remained closed to minorities.

===Druze and Circassians===
Although Israel has a majority of Jewish soldiers, all citizens including large numbers of Druze and Circassian men are subject to mandatory conscription. Originally, they served in the framework of a special unit called &quot;The Minorities&#x27; Unit&quot;, which operated until 2015 in the form of the independent Herev Gdud (&quot;Sword&quot;) battalion. However, since the 1980s Druze soldiers have increasingly protested this practice, which they considered a means of segregating them and denying them access to elite units (like sayeret units). The army has increasingly admitted Druze soldiers to regular combat units and promoted them to higher ranks from which they had been previously excluded.

In 2015, Rav Aluf Gadi Eizenkot ordered the unit&#x27;s closure to assimilate the Druze soldiers no differently than Jewish soldiers, as part of an ongoing reorganization of the army. Several Druze officers reached ranks as high as Major General, and many received commendations for distinguished service. In proportion to their numbers, the Druze people achieve much higher—documented—levels in the Israeli army than other soldiers. Nevertheless, some Druze still charge that discrimination continues, such as exclusion from the Air Force, although the official low-security classification for Druze has been abolished for some time. The first Druze aircraft navigator completed his training course in 2005. Like all Air Force pilots, his identity is not disclosed. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, many Druze who had initially sided with the Arabs deserted their ranks to either return to their villages or side with Israel in various capacities.

Since the late 1970s, the Druze Initiative Committee, centred at the village of Beit Jan and linked to Maki, has campaigned to abolish Druze conscription.

Military service is a tradition among some of the Druze population, with most opposition in Druze communities of the Golan Heights. 83 per cent of Druze boys serve in the army, according to the IDF&#x27;s statistics. According to the Israeli army in 2010, 369 Druze soldiers had been killed in combat operations since 1948.

===Bedouins and Israeli Arabs===


By law, all Israeli citizens are subject to conscription. The Defense Minister has complete discretion to grant exemption to individual citizens or classes of citizens. A long-standing policy dating to Israel&#x27;s early years extends an exemption to all other Israeli minorities (most notably Israeli Arabs). However, there is a long-standing government policy of encouraging Bedouins to volunteer and of offering them various inducements, and in some impoverished Bedouin communities a military career seems one of the few means of (relative) social mobility available. Also, Muslims and Christians are accepted as volunteers, even if older than 18.

From among non-Bedouin Arab citizens, the number of volunteers for military service—some Christian Arabs and even a few Muslim Arabs—is minute, and the government makes no special effort to increase it. Six Israeli Arabs have received orders of distinction as a result of their military service; of them the most famous is a Bedouin officer, Lieutenant Colonel Abd el-Majid Hidr (also known as Amos Yarkoni), who received the Order of Distinction. Vahid el Huzil was the first Bedouin to be a battalion commander.

Until the second term of Yitzhak Rabin as Prime Minister (1992–1995), social benefits given to families in which at least one member (including a grandfather, uncle, or cousin) had served at some time in the armed forces were significantly higher than to &quot;non-military&quot; families, which was considered a means of blatant discrimination between Jews and Arabs. Rabin led the abolition of the measure, in the teeth of strong opposition from the Right. At present, the only official advantage of military service is the attaining of security clearance and serving in some types of government positions (in most cases, security-related), as well as some indirect benefits.

Rather than perform army service, Israeli Arab youths have the option to volunteer to national service and receive benefits similar to those received by discharged soldiers. The volunteers are generally allocated to Arab populations, where they assist with social and community matters. , 1,473 Arabs were volunteering for national service. According to sources in the national service administration, Arab leaders are counselling youths to refrain from performing services to the state. According to a National Service official, &quot;For years the Arab leadership has demanded, justifiably, benefits for Arab youths similar to those received by discharged soldiers. Now, when this opportunity is available, it is precisely these leaders who reject the state&#x27;s call to come and do the service, and receive these benefits.&quot;

Although Arabs are not obliged to serve in the IDF, any Arab can volunteer. In 2008, a Muslim Arab woman was serving as a medic with unit 669.

Cpl. Elinor Joseph from Haifa became the first female Arab combat soldier for IDF.

Other Arab-Muslim officers who have served in the IDF are Second Lieutenant Hisham Abu Varia and Major Ala Wahib, the highest ranking Muslim officer in the IDF in 2013.

In October 2012, the IDF promoted Mona Abdo to become the first female Christian Arab to the rank of combat commander. Abdo had voluntarily enlisted in the IDF, which her family had encouraged, and transferred from the Ordnance Corps to the Caracal Battalion, a mixed-gender unit with both Jewish and Arab soldiers.

In 2014, an increase in Israeli Christian Arabs joining the army was reported.
Muslim Arabs have also been drafted into the Israel Defense Forces in increasing numbers in recent years. In 2020, 606 Muslim Arabs were drafted, compared to 489 in 2019 and 436 in 2018. More than half of those who have drafted have gone into combat roles.

===Ethiopian Jews===
The IDF carried out extended missions in Ethiopia and neighbouring states, whose purpose was to protect Ethiopian Jews (Beta Israel) and to help their immigration to Israel. The IDF adopted policies and special activities for the absorption and integration of Ethiopian immigrant soldiers, reported to have much improved the achievements and integration of those soldiers in the army, and Israeli society in general. Statistical research showed that the Ethiopian soldiers are esteemed as excellent soldiers and many aspire to be recruited to combat units.

===Haredim===
Under a special arrangement called Torato Umanuto, Haredi men could choose to defer service while enrolled in &quot;yeshivot&quot; and many avoided conscription altogether. This has given rise to tensions between the Israeli religious and secular communities. In 2024, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Haredi men were eligible for compulsory service and the army began drafting them.

Haredi males have the option of serving in the 97th &quot;Netzah Yehuda&quot; Infantry Battalion. This unit is a standard IDF infantry battalion focused on the Jenin region. To facilitate Haredi soldiers to serve, the Netzah Yehuda military bases follow the standards of Jewish dietary laws. The only women permitted on these bases were wives of soldiers and officers. Some Haredim serve in the IDF via the Hesder system, principally designed for the Religious Zionist sector. It is a 5-year program which includes 2 years of religious studies, 1½ years of military service and 1½ years of religious studies during which the soldiers can be recalled to active duty at any moment. Haredi soldiers may join other units of the IDF but rarely do. Although the IDF claims it will not discriminate against women, it is offering Haredim &quot;women free and secular free&quot; recruitment centres. Defense Minister Moshe Ya&#x27;alon expressed his willingness to relax regulations to meet the demands of ultra-Orthodox rabbis. Regulations regarding gender equality had already been relaxed so that Haredim could be assured that men would not receive physical exams from female medical staff.

In 2024, the Hasmonean Brigade, a Haredi infantry unit, was created to accommodate Haredi soldiers. In January 2025, the unit received it&#x27;s first 50 soldiers. 

Since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas War, 600 Haredim have enlisted through the Shlav Bet program, an IDF recruitment track intended for Haredim over the age of 26 to complete military service.

===LGBT people===

Since the early 1990s, sexual identity has presented no formal barrier in terms of soldiers&#x27; military specialization or eligibility for promotion.

Until the 1980s, the IDF tended to discharge soldiers who were openly gay. In 1983, the IDF permitted homosexuals to serve but banned them from intelligence and top-secret positions. A decade later, professor Uzi Even, an IDF reserves officer and chairman of Tel Aviv University&#x27;s Chemistry Department, revealed that his rank had been revoked and that he had been barred from researching sensitive topics in military intelligence, solely because of his sexual orientation. His testimony to the Knesset in 1993 raised a political storm, forcing the IDF to remove such restrictions against gays.

The chief of staff&#x27;s policy states that it is strictly forbidden to harm or hurt anyone&#x27;s dignity or feeling based on their gender or sexual orientation in any way, including signs, slogans, pictures, poems, lectures, any means of guidance, propaganda, publishing, voicing, and utterance. Moreover, gays in the IDF have additional rights, such as the right to take a shower alone if they want to. According to a University of California, Santa Barbara study, a brigadier general stated that Israelis show a &quot;great tolerance&quot; for gay soldiers. Consul David Saranga at the Israeli Consulate in New York, who was interviewed by the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;, said, &quot;It&#x27;s a non-issue. You can be a very good officer, a creative one, a brave one, and be gay at the same time.&quot;

A study published by the Israel Gay Youth (IGY) Movement in January 2012 found that half of the homosexual soldiers who serve in the IDF suffer from violence and homophobia, although the head of the group said &quot;I am happy to say that the intention among the top brass is to change that.&quot;

===Deaf and hard-of-hearing people===
Israel is the only country in the world that requires deaf and hard-of-hearing people to serve in the military. Sign language interpreters are provided during training, and many of them serve in non-combat capacities such as mapping and office work. The major language spoken by the deaf and hard-of-hearing in Israel is Israeli Sign Language (also called Shassi)–a language related to German Sign Language but not Hebrew or any other local language–though Israel and Palestine are home to numerous sign languages spoken by various populations like Bedouins&#x27; Al-Sayyid Bedouin Sign Language.

===Vegans===
According to a Care2 report, vegans in the IDF may refuse vaccination if they oppose animal testing. They are given artificial leather boots and a black fleece beret. Until 2014, vegan soldiers in the IDF received special allowances to buy their own food, when this policy was replaced with vegan food being provided in all bases, as well as vegan combat rations being offered to vegan combat soldiers.

===Overseas volunteers===

Non-immigrating foreign volunteers typically serve with the IDF in one of five ways:
* The Mahal program targets young non-Israeli Jews or Israeli citizens who grew up abroad (men younger than 24 and women younger than 21). The program consists typically of 18 months of IDF service, including a lengthy training for those in combat units or (for 18 months) one month of non-combat training and an additional two months of learning Hebrew after enlisting, if necessary. There are two additional subcategories of Mahal, both geared solely for religious men: Mahal Nahal Haredi (18 months), and Mahal Hesder, which combines yeshiva study of 5 months with IDF service of 16 months, for a total of 21 months. Similar IDF programs exist for Israeli overseas residents. To be accepted as a Mahal Volunteer, one must be of Jewish descent (at least one Jewish grandparent).
* Sar-El, an organization subordinate to the Israeli Logistics Corps, provides a volunteer program for non-Israeli citizens who are 17 years or older (or 15 if accompanied by a parent). The program is also aimed at Israeli citizens, aged 30 years or older, living abroad who did not serve in the Israeli Army and who now wish to finalize their status with the military. The program usually consists of three weeks of volunteer service on different rear army bases, doing non-combative work.
* Garin Tzabar offers a program mainly for Israelis who emigrated with their parents to the United States at a young age. Although a basic knowledge of the Hebrew language is not mandatory, it is helpful. Of all the programs listed, only Garin Tzabar requires full-length service in the IDF. The program is set up in stages: first, the participants go through five seminars in their country of origin, then have an absorption period in Israel at a kibbutz. Each delegation is adopted by a kibbutz in Israel and has living quarters designated for it. The delegation shares responsibilities in the kibbutz when on military leave. Participants start the program three months before being enlisted in the army at the beginning of August.
* Marva is short-term basic training for two months.
* Lev LaChayal is a program based at Yeshivat Lev Hatorah which takes a holistic approach to preparation for service. Being as ready as possible to integrate into Israeli culture, handling the physical challenges of the military, and maintaining religious values require a multi-pronged approach. The beit midrash learning, classes, physical training, and even recreational activities are designed to allow for maximum readiness.

==Doctrine==

=== IDF Code of Ethics ===

In 1992, the IDF drafted a Code of Conduct that combines international law, Israeli law, Jewish heritage and the IDF&#x27;s traditional ethical code—the IDF Spirit (, &quot;Ru&#x27;ah Tzahal&quot;).

The document defines four core values for all IDF soldiers to follow, including &quot;defense of the state, its citizens and its residents&quot;, &quot;love of the homeland and loyalty to the country&quot;, &quot;human dignity&quot; and &quot;stateliness, as well as ten secondary values.

&quot;The Spirit of the IDF&quot; (cf. supra) is still considered the only binding moral code that formally applies to the IDF troops. In 2009, Amos Yadlin (then head of Military Intelligence) suggested that the article he co-authored with Asa Kasher be ratified as a formal binding code, arguing that &quot;the current code [&#x27;The Spirit of the IDF&#x27;] does not sufficiently address one of the army&#x27;s most pressing challenges: asymmetric warfare against terrorist organizations that operate amid a civilian population&quot;.

Details of the IDF&#x27;s rules of engagement remain classified.

===Targeted killing===

Targeted killing, targeted prevention or assassination is a tactic that has been repeatedly used by the IDF and other Israeli organisations in the course of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, the Iran–Israel proxy conflict or other conflicts.

In 2005, Asa Kasher and Amos Yadlin co-authored a noticed article published in the &quot;Journal of Military Ethics&quot; under the title: &quot;Military Ethics of Fighting Terror: An Israeli Perspective&quot;. The article was meant as an &quot;extension of the classical Just War Theory&quot;, and as a &quot;[needed] third model&quot; or missing paradigm besides which of &quot;classical war (army) and law enforcement (police).&quot;, resulting in a &quot;doctrine (...) on the background of the IDF fight against acts and activities of terror performed by Palestinian individuals and organizations.&quot;

In this article, Kasher and Yadlin concluded that targeted killings of terrorists were justifiable, even at the cost of hitting nearby civilians. In a 2009 interview to &quot;Haaretz&quot;, Asa Kasher later confirmed, pointing to the fact that in an area in which the IDF does not have effective security control (e.g., Gaza, vs. East-Jerusalem), soldiers&#x27; lives protection takes priority over avoiding injury to enemy civilians. Some, along with Avishai Margalit and Michael Walzer, have disputed this argument, arguing that such a position was &quot;contrary to centuries of theorizing about the morality of war as well as international humanitarian law&quot;, since drawing &quot;a sharp line between combatants and noncombatants&quot; would be &quot;the only morally relevant distinction that all those involved in a war can agree on.&quot;

===Hannibal Directive===

The Hannibal Directive is a controversial procedure that the IDF has used to prevent the capture of Israeli soldiers by enemy forces. It was introduced in 1986, after some abductions of IDF soldiers in Lebanon and the subsequent controversial prisoner exchanges. The full text of the directive has never been published and until 2003 Israeli military censorship even forbade any discussion of the subject in the press. The directive has been changed several times. At one time the formulation was that &quot;the kidnapping must be stopped by all means, even at the price of striking and harming our own forces.&quot;

The Hannibal directive has, at times, apparently existed in two different versions, one top-secret written version, accessible only to the upper echelon of the IDF, and one &quot;oral law&quot; version for division commanders and lower levels. In the latter versions, &quot;by all means&quot; was often interpreted literally, as in &quot;an IDF soldier was better dead than abducted&quot;. In 2011, IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz stated the directive does not permit the killing of IDF soldiers.

===Dahiya doctrine===

The Dahiya doctrine is a military strategy of asymmetric warfare, outlined by former IDF Chief of General Staff Gadi Eizenkot, which encompasses the use of aerial and artillery fire against civilian infrastructure used by terrorist organizations and endorses the employment of &quot;disproportionate power&quot; to secure that end. The doctrine is named after the Dahieh neighborhood of Beirut, where Hezbollah was headquartered during the 2006 Lebanon War, which were heavily damaged by the IDF.

==Budget==

During 1950–66, Israel spent an average of 9% of its GDP on defense. Defence expenditures increased dramatically after both the 1967 and 1973 wars. They reached a high of about 30% of GDP in 1975, but have since come down significantly, following the signing of peace agreements with Jordan and Egypt.

In September 2009, Defense Minister Ehud Barak, Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu endorsed an additional NIS 1.5 billion for the defense budget to help Israel address problems regarding Iran. The budget changes came two months after Israel had approved its two-year budget. The defence budget in 2009 stood at NIS 48.6 billion and NIS 53.2 billion for 2010 – the highest amount in Israel&#x27;s history. The figure constituted 6.3% of expected gross domestic product and 15.1% of the overall budget, even before the planned NIS 1.5 billion addition.

In 2011, the prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu reversed course and moved to make significant cuts in the defence budget to pay for social programs. The General Staff concluded that the proposed cuts endangered the battle readiness of the armed forces. In 2012, Israel spent $15.2 billion on its armed forces, one of the highest ratios of defense spending to GDP among developed countries ($1,900 per person). However, Israel&#x27;s spending per capita is below that of the US.

==Equipment and weaponry==
===Military equipment===
The IDF possesses various foreign and domestically produced weapons and computer systems. Some gear comes from the US (with some equipment modified for IDF use) such as the M4A1 and M16 assault rifles, the M24 SWS 7.62 mm bolt action sniper rifle, the SR-25 7.62 mm semi-automatic sniper rifle, the F-15 Eagle and F-16 Fighting Falcon fighter jets, and the AH-1 Cobra and AH-64D Apache attack helicopters. Israel has also developed its own independent weapons industry, which has developed weapons and vehicles such as the Merkava battle tank series, Nesher and Kfir fighter aircraft, and various small arms such as the Galil and Tavor assault rifles, and the Uzi submachine gun. Israel has also installed a variant of the Samson RCWS, a remote controlled weapons platform, which can include machine guns, grenade launchers, and anti-tank missiles on a remotely operated turret, in pillboxes along the Gaza–Israel barrier intended to prevent Palestinian militants from entering its territory.

Israel has developed observation balloons equipped with sophisticated cameras and surveillance systems used to thwart terror attacks from Gaza. The IDF also possesses advanced combat engineering equipment which includes the IDF Caterpillar D9 armoured bulldozer, IDF Puma CEV, Tzefa Shiryon and CARPET minefield breaching rockets, and a variety of robots and explosive devices.

The IDF has several large internal research and development departments, and it purchases many technologies produced by the Israeli security industries including IAI, IMI, Elbit Systems, Rafael, and dozens of smaller firms. Many of these developments have been battle-tested in Israel&#x27;s numerous military engagements, making the relationship mutually beneficial, the IDF getting tailor-made solutions and the industries a good reputation.

In response to the price overruns on the US Littoral Combat Ship program, Israel is considering producing their own warships, which would take a decade and depend on diverting US financing to the project.

===Main developments===
Israel&#x27;s military technology is famous for its firearms, armoured fighting vehicles (tanks, tank-converted armoured personnel carriers (APCs), armoured bulldozers, etc.), unmanned aerial vehicles, and rocketry (missiles and rockets). Israel also has manufactured aircraft including the Kfir (reserve), IAI Lavi (cancelled), and the IAI Phalcon Airborne early warning System, and naval systems (patrol and missile ships). Much of the IDF&#x27;s electronic systems (intelligence, communication, command and control, navigation etc.) are Israeli-developed, including many systems installed on foreign platforms (esp. aircraft, tanks and submarines), as are many of its precision-guided munitions. Israel is the world&#x27;s largest exporter of drones.

Israel Military Industries (IMI), as well as its former subsidiary Israel Weapon Industries, are known for their firearms. The IMI Galil, the Uzi, the IMI Negev light machine gun and the new Tavor TAR-21 Bullpup assault rifle are used by the IDF. The Rafael Advanced Defense Systems Spike missile is one of the most widely exported ATGMs in the world.

Israel&#x27;s Arrow anti-ballistic missile system, jointly funded and produced by Israel and the United States, has successfully conducted combat intercepts of incoming ballistic missile attacks. The Iron Dome system against short-range rockets is operational and proved to be successful, intercepting hundreds of Qassam, 122 mm Grad and Fajr-5 artillery rockets fire by Palestinian militants from the Gaza Strip. David&#x27;s Sling, an anti-missile system designed to counter medium range rockets, became operational in 2017. Israel has also worked with the US on the development of a tactical high energy laser system against medium-range rockets (called Nautilus or THEL). Iron Beam is a short-range laser beam air defence system, created to eliminate rockets, artillery, and mortar bombs. With a range of several kilometres, it complements the Iron Dome system, which is specifically designed for intercepting missiles launched from greater distances.

Israel has the independent capability of launching reconnaissance satellites into orbit, a capability shared with Russia, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, South Korea, Italy, Germany, the People&#x27;s Republic of China, India, Japan, Brazil and Ukraine. Israeli security industries developed both the satellites (Ofeq) and the launchers (Shavit).

Israel is known to have developed nuclear weapons. Israel does not officially acknowledge its nuclear weapons program. It is thought Israel possesses between one hundred and four hundred nuclear warheads. It is believed that Jericho intercontinental ballistic missiles are capable of delivering nuclear warheads with a superior degree of accuracy and a range of 11,500 km. Israeli F-15I and F-16 fighter-bomber aircraft also have been cited as possible nuclear delivery systems (these aircraft types are nuclear capable in the US Air Force). The U.S. Air Force F-15E has tactical nuclear weapon (B61 and B83 bombs) capability. It has been asserted that Dolphin-class submarines have been adapted to carry Popeye Turbo Submarine-launched cruise missiles with nuclear warheads, so as to give Israel a second strike capacity.

In 2006, Israel deployed the Wolf Armoured Vehicle APC for use in urban warfare and to protect VIPs.


===Field rations===
Field rations, called &quot;manot krav&quot;, usually consist of canned tuna, sardines, beans, stuffed vine leaves, maize and fruit cocktail and bars of halva. Packets of fruit-flavoured drink powder are provided along with condiments like ketchup, mustard, chocolate spread and jam. Around 2010, the IDF announced that certain freeze-dried MREs served in water-activated disposable heaters like goulash, turkey schwarma and meatballs would be introduced as field rations.

One staple of these rations was &quot;loof&quot;, a type of Kosher spam made from chicken or beef that was phased out around 2008. Food historian Gil Marks has written that: &quot;Many Israeli soldiers insist that Loof uses all the parts of the cow that the hot dog manufacturers will not accept, but no one outside of the manufacturer and the kosher supervisors know what is inside.&quot;

===Development plans===
The IDF is planning several technological upgrades and structural reforms for the future of its land, air, and sea branches. Training has been increased, including cooperation between ground, air, and naval units.

The Israeli Army is phasing out the M-16 rifle from all ground units in favor of the IMI Tavor variants, most recently the IWI Tavor X95 flat-top (&quot;Micro-Tavor Dor Gimel&quot;). The IDF is replacing its outdated M113 armored personnel carriers in favor of new Namer APCs, with 200 ordered in 2014, the Eitan AFV, and is upgrading its IDF Achzarit APCs. The IDF announced plans to streamline its military bureaucracy so as to better maintain its reserve force, which a 2014 State Comptroller report noted was under-trained and may not be able to fulfill wartime missions. As part of the plans, 100,000 reservists will be discharged, and training for the remainder will be improved. The officer corps will be slashed by 5,000. Infantry and light artillery brigades will be reduced to increase training standards among the rest.

The IDF is planning a future tank to replace the Merkava. The new tank will be able to fire lasers and electromagnetic pulses, run on a hybrid engine, run with a crew as small as two, will be faster, and will be better protected, with emphasis on protection systems such as the Trophy over armour. The Combat Engineering Corps assimilated new technologies, mainly in tunnel detection and unmanned ground vehicles and military robots, such as remote-controlled IDF Caterpillar D9T &quot;Panda&quot; armoured bulldozers, Sahar engineering scout robot and improved Remotec ANDROS robots.

The Israeli Air Force will purchase as many as 100 F-35 Lightning II fighter jets from the United States. The aircraft will be modified and designated F-35I. They will use Israeli-built electronic warfare systems, outer wings, guided bombs, and air-to-air missiles. As part of a 2013 arms deal, the IAF will purchase KC-135 Stratotanker aerial refueling aircraft and V-22 Osprey multi-mission aircraft from the United States, as well as advanced radars for warplanes and missiles designed to take out radars. In April 2013, an Israeli official stated that within 40–50 years, piloted aircraft would be phased out of service by unmanned aerial vehicles capable of executing nearly any operation that can be performed by piloted combat aircraft. Israel&#x27;s military industries are reportedly on the path to developing such technology in a few decades. Israel will also manufacture tactical satellites for military use.

The Israeli Navy is currently expanding its submarine fleet, with a planned total of six Dolphin class submarines. Currently, five have been delivered, with the sixth, INS Drakon, expected to be delivered in 2020. It is also upgrading and expanding its surface fleet. It is planning to upgrade the electronic warfare systems of its Sa&#x27;ar 5-class corvettes and Sa&#x27;ar 4.5 class missile boats, and has ordered two new classes of warship: the Sa&#x27;ar 6-class corvette (a variant of the Braunschweig-class corvette) and the Sa&#x27;ar 72-class corvette, an improved and enlarged version of the Sa&#x27;ar 4.5-class. It plans to acquire four Saar 6-class corvettes and three Sa&#x27;ar 72-class corvettes. Israel is also developing marine artillery, including a gun capable of firing satellite-guided 155mm rounds between 75 and 120 kilometres.

==Foreign military relations==

===France===
Starting on 14 May 1948 (5 Iyar 5708), when Israel became a sovereign state, a strong military, commercial and political relationship was established between France and Israel, which lasted until 1969. Between 1956 and 1966, the two countries had the highest level of military collaboration.

===United States===


In 1983, the United States and Israel established a Joint Political Military Group, which convenes twice a year. Both the U.S. and Israel participate in joint military planning and combined exercises and have collaborated on military research and weapons development. Additionally the U.S. military maintains two classified, pre-positioned War Reserve Stocks in Israel valued at $493 million. Israel has the official distinction of being an American Major non-NATO ally.
Since 1976, Israel had been the largest annual recipient of U.S. foreign assistance. In 2009, Israel received $2.55 billion in Foreign Military Financing (FMF) grants from the Department of Defense. All but 26% of this military aid is for the purchase of military hardware from American companies only.

In October 2012, the United States and Israel began their biggest joint air and missile defence exercise, known as Austere Challenge 12, involving around 3,500 U.S. troops in the region along with 1,000 IDF personnel. Germany and Britain also participated.

Since mid-2017, the United States has operated an anti-missile system in the Negev region of Southern Israel, which is manned by 120 US Army personnel. It is a facility used by the U.S. inside a larger Mashabim Israeli Air Force base.

===India===

India and Israel enjoy strong military and strategic ties. Israeli authorities consider Indian citizens to be the most pro-Israel people in the world. Apart from being Israel&#x27;s second-largest economic partner in Asia, India is also the largest customer of Israeli arms in the world. In 2006, annual military sales between India and Israel stood at US$900 million. Israeli defense firms had the largest exhibition at the 2009 Aero India show, during which Israel offered several state-of-the art weapons to India.

The first major military deal between the two countries was the sale of Israeli Phalcon airborne warning and control system (AWACS) radars to the Indian Air Force in 2004. In March 2009, India and Israel signed a US$1.4 billion deal under which Israel would sell India an advanced air-defense system. India and Israel have also embarked on extensive space cooperation. In 2008, India&#x27;s ISRO launched Israel&#x27;s most technologically advanced spy satellite TecSAR. In 2009, India reportedly developed a high-tech spy satellite RISAT-2 with significant assistance from Israel. The satellite was successfully launched by India in April 2009.

According to a Los Angeles Times news story, the 2008 Mumbai attacks were an attack on the growing India-Israel partnership. It quotes retired Indian Vice Admiral Premvir S. Das thus &quot;Their aim was to... tell the Indians clearly that your growing linkage with Israel is not what you should be doing...&quot; In the past, India and Israel have held numerous joint anti-terror training exercises

===Germany===
Germany developed the Dolphin submarine and supplied it to Israel. Two submarines were donated by Germany. The military co-operation has been discreet but mutually profitable: Israeli intelligence, for example, sent captured Warsaw Pact armor to West Germany to be analyzed. The results aided the German development of an anti-tank system. Israel also trained members of GSG 9, a German counter-terrorism and special operations unit. The Israeli Merkava MK IV tank uses a German V12 engine produced under license.

In 2008, the website DefenseNews revealed that Germany and Israel had been jointly developing a nuclear warning system, Operation Bluebird.
===United Kingdom===

The United Kingdom has supplied equipment and spare parts for Sa&#x27;ar 4.5-class missile boats and F-4 Phantom fighter-bombers, components for small-calibre artillery ammunition and air-to-surface missiles, and engines for Elbit Hermes 450 Unmanned aerial vehicles. British arms sales to Israel mainly consist of light weaponry, and ammunition and components for helicopters, tanks, armoured personnel carriers, and combat aircraft.

===Russia===

On 19 October 1999, the Defense Minister of China, General Chi Haotian, after meeting with Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass in Damascus, Syria, to discuss expanding military ties between Syria and China, then flew directly to Israel and met with Ehud Barak, the then Prime Minister and Defense Minister of Israel where they discussed military relations. Among the military arrangements was a $1 billion Israeli–Russian sale of military aircraft to China, which were to be jointly produced by Russia and Israel.

Russia has bought drones from Israel.

===China===

Israel is the second-largest foreign supplier of arms to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, only after the Russian Federation. China has purchased a wide array of military hardware from Israel, including Unmanned aerial vehicles and communications satellites. China has become an extensive market for Israel&#x27;s military industries and arms manufacturers, and trade with Israel has allowed it to obtain &quot;dual-use&quot; technology which the United States and European Union were reluctant to provide. In 2010 Yair Golan, head of IDF Home Front Command visited China to strengthen military ties. In 2012, IDF Chief of Staff Benny Gantz visited China for high-level talks with the Chinese defence establishment.

===Cyprus===

As closely neighbouring countries, Israel and Cyprus have enjoyed greatly improving diplomatic relations since 2010. During the Mount Carmel Forest Fire, Cyprus dispatched two aviation assets to assist fire-fighting operations in Israel – the first time Cypriot Government aircraft were permitted to operate from Israeli airfields in a non-civil capacity. Israel and Cyprus have closely cooperated in maritime activities relating to Gaza, since 2010, and have reportedly begun an extensive sharing program of regional intelligence to support mutual security concerns. In May 2012, it was widely reported that the Israeli Air Force had been granted unrestricted access to the Nicosia Flight Information Region of Cyprus and that Israeli aviation assets may have operated over the island itself.

===Greece===
Since 2010, the Israeli and Greek air forces trained jointly in Greece, indicating a boost in ties due in large part to Israel&#x27;s rift with Turkey. Recent purchases include 100 million euro deal between Greece and Israel for the purchase of SPICE 1000 and SPICE 2000 pound bomb kits. In November 2011, the Israeli Air Force hosted Greece&#x27;s Hellenic Air Force in a joint exercise at the Uvda base. Similar training was held in 2012 by the IAF in cooperation with the Hellenic Air Force in the Peloponnese and parts of southern Greece in a response to the need of the IAF training of pilots in unfamiliar areas. On March 14, 2013, the navies of Israel, Greece and the US held a two-week joint military exercise for the third year in a row. The annual operation is nicknamed Noble Dina and was established in 2011. Similar to Noble Dina in 2012, the exercise in 2013 included defending offshore natural gas platforms and simulated air-to-air combat and anti-submarine warfare. In March 2017, Israel participated in the large-scale &quot;Iniochus 2017&quot; military exercise, which is organized annually by Greece, along with USA, Italy and the United Arab Emirates.

===Turkey===

Israel has provided extensive military assistance to Turkey. Israel sold Turkey IAI Heron Unmanned aerial vehicles, and modernized Turkey&#x27;s F-4 Phantom and Northrop F-5 aircraft at the cost of $900 million. Turkey&#x27;s main battle tank is the Israeli-made Sabra tank, of which Turkey has 170. Israel later upgraded them for $500 million. Israel has also supplied Turkey with Israeli-made missiles, and the two nations have engaged in naval cooperation. Turkey allowed Israeli pilots to practice long-range flying over mountainous terrain in Turkey&#x27;s Konya firing range, while Israel trains Turkish pilots at Israel&#x27;s computerized firing range at Nevatim Airbase. Until 2009, the Turkish military was one of Israel&#x27;s largest defence customers. Israel defence companies have sold unmanned aerial vehicles and long-range targeting pods.

However, relations have been strained in recent times. SInce 2010 the Turkish military has declined to participate in the annual joint naval exercise with Israel and the United States. The exercise, known as &quot;Reliant Mermaid&quot; was started in 1998 and included the Israeli, Turkish and American navies. The objective of the exercise is to practice search-and-rescue operations and to familiarize each navy with international partners who also operate in the Mediterranean Sea.

===Azerbaijan===

Azerbaijan and Israel have engaged in intense cooperation since 1992. Israeli military have been a major provider of battlefield aviation, artillery, antitank, and anti-infantry weaponry to Azerbaijan. In 2009, Israeli President Shimon Peres made a visit to Azerbaijan where military relations were expanded further, with the Israeli company Aeronautics Defense Systems Ltd announcing it was going to build a factory in Baku.

In 2012, Israel and Azerbaijan signed an agreement according to which state-run Israel Aerospace Industries would sell $1.6 billion in drones and anti-aircraft and missile defense systems to Azerbaijan. In March 2012, the magazine &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; reported that the Israeli Air Force may be preparing to use the Sitalchay Military Airbase, located from the Iranian border, for air strikes against the nuclear program of Iran, later backed up by other media.

===Other countries===
Israel has also sold to or received supplies of military equipment from the Czech Republic, Argentina, Portugal, Spain, Slovakia, Italy, South Africa, Canada, Australia, Poland, Slovenia, Romania, Hungary, Belgium, Austria, Serbia, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Vietnam and Colombia, among others.

==Commemoration==
===Parades===

Israel Defense Forces parades took place on Independence Day, during the first 25 years of the State of Israel&#x27;s existence. They were cancelled after 1973 due to financial and security concerns. The Israel Defense Forces still have weapon exhibitions country-wide on Independence Day, but they are stationary.

===Commemoration===

Yom Hazikaron, Israel&#x27;s day of remembrance for fallen soldiers, is observed on the 4th day of the month of Iyar of the Hebrew calendar, the day before the celebration of Independence Day.

The main museum for Israel&#x27;s armoured corps is the Yad La-Shiryon in Latrun, which houses one of the largest tank museums in the world. Other significant military museums are the Israel Defense Forces History Museum (Batei Ha-Osef) in Tel Aviv, the Palmach Museum, and the Beit HaTotchan of artillery in Zikhron Ya&#x27;akov. The Israeli Air Force Museum is located at Hatzerim Airbase in the Negev Desert, and the Israeli Clandestine Immigration and Naval Museum, is in Haifa.

Israel&#x27;s National Military Cemetery is at Mount Herzl. Other Israeli military cemeteries include Kiryat Shaul Military Cemetery in Tel Aviv, and Sgula military cemetery at Petah Tikva.

<text>Franco Maria Malfatti (; 13 June 1927 – 10 December 1991) was an Italian politician who served as the third president of the European Commission from 1970 to 1972. He served at Italian level as Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1979 to 1980 and Italian Minister of Education from 1973 to 1978.

==Biography==
Malfatti was born in Rome to parents from the province of Rieti. He was an important member of the governing council of Democrazia Cristiana (the Christian Democratic party), where he became chief of the political bureau and covered several institutional charges.

In Democrazia Cristiana, he was a member of Dossetti&#x27;s lobby, together with Amintore Fanfani, Aldo Moro, and Giorgio La Pira. In 1951 he was elected national representative for young members; in 1958 he was elected deputy for the districts of Rieti and Umbria. He served as minister for Foreign Affairs (1979–1980), Finance (1978–1979), Education, Industry, State holdings, and Telecommunications.

He was also the third President of the European Commission from 1970 to 1972. The &quot;Malfatti Commission&quot; began as the integration process was relaunched: the EC adopted a financial framework and competed for the single market. There was also the beginnings of political cooperation, monetary cooperation, and of enlargement as talks opened with Denmark, Ireland, Norway and the United Kingdom. He resigned from this post in 1972 to run for office in Italy.

In the 1980s he was chief of the Italian delegation in the European Parliament. Politically close to Aldo Moro&#x27;s lobby, Malfatti was among the participants in Bilderberg meetings.

This service is performed by the server in response to a service protocol request.

An example of a name server is the server component of the Domain Name System (DNS), one of the two principal namespaces of the Internet. The most important function of DNS servers is the translation (resolution) of human-memorable domain names and hostnames into the corresponding numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, the second principal name space of the Internet which is used to identify and locate computer systems and resources on the Internet.

==Domain name server==
The Internet maintains two principal namespaces: the domain name hierarchy and the IP address system. The Domain Name System maintains the domain namespace and provides translation services between these two namespaces. Internet name servers implement the Domain Name System. The top hierarchy of the Domain Name System is served by the root name servers maintained by delegation by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). DNS servers, which are located all over the world, translate domain names into IP addresses, giving them control over which server a user may access via a given domain. Below the root, Internet resources are organized into a hierarchy of domains, administered by the respective registrars and domain name holders. A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records, such as address (A, AAAA) records, name server (NS) records, and mail exchanger (MX) records for a domain name (see also List of DNS record types) and responds with answers to queries against its database.

=== Types of name servers ===

Name servers are usually either &quot;authoritative&quot; or &quot;recursive&quot;, as described below. 

Although not the usual practice today, name servers can be both authoritative &quot;and&quot; recursive, if they are configured to give authoritative answers to queries in some zones, while acting as a caching name server for all other zones.

===Authoritative name server===
An authoritative name server is a name server that is responsible for giving answers in response to questions asked about names in a zone. An authoritative-only name server returns answers only to queries about domain names for which it is responsible (as specifically configured by its administrator). 

An authoritative name server can either be a &quot;primary&quot; server or a &quot;secondary&quot; server. A primary server for a zone is the server that stores the definitive versions of all records in that zone. It is identified in the start-of-authority (SOA) resource record. A secondary server for a zone uses an automatic updating mechanism to maintain an identical copy of the primary server&#x27;s database for a zone. Examples of such mechanisms include DNS zone transfers and file transfer protocols. DNS provides a mechanism whereby the primary for a zone can notify all the known secondaries for that zone when the contents of the zone have changed. The contents of a zone are either manually configured by an administrator, or managed using Dynamic DNS.

Every domain name appears in a zone served by one or more authoritative name servers. The fully qualified domain names of the authoritative name servers of a zone are listed in the NS records of that zone. If the server for a zone is not also authoritative for its parent zone, the server for the parent zone must be configured with a delegation for the zone.

When a domain is registered with a domain name registrar, the zone administrator provides the list of name servers (typically at least two, for redundancy) that are authoritative for the zone that contains the domain. The registrar provides the names of these servers to the domain registry for the top-level domain containing the zone. The domain registry in turn configures the authoritative name servers for that top-level domain with delegations for each server for the zone. If the fully qualified domain name of any name server for a zone appears within that zone, the zone administrator provides IP addresses for that name server, which are installed in the parent zone as glue records; otherwise, the delegation consists of the list of NS records for that zone.

====Authoritative answer====
A name server indicates that its response is authoritative by setting the &quot;Authoritative Answer&quot; (&quot;AA&quot;) bit in the response to a query on a name for which it is authoritative. Name servers providing answers for which they are not authoritative (for example, name servers for parent zones) do not set the &quot;AA&quot; bit.

===Recursive Resolver===

A &quot;Recursive Resolver&quot; (sometimes called a Recursive Name Server) is a DNS name server that accepts recursive queries (defined below) from clients (who are using a stub resolver), and then resolves those queries, either from a cache of prior results, or by asking one or more authoritative servers. 

====Recursive query====

If a name server cannot answer a query because it does not contain an entry for the host in its DNS cache, it may recursively query name servers higher up in the hierarchy. This is known as a &quot;recursive query&quot; or &quot;recursive lookup&quot;. A server providing recursive queries is known as a &quot;recursive name server&quot; or &quot;recursive DNS&quot;, sometimes abbreviated as recdns.

In principle, authoritative name servers suffice for the operation of the Internet. However, with only authoritative name-servers operating, every DNS query must start with recursive queries at the root zone of the Domain Name System and each user system must implement resolver software capable of recursive operation.

===Caching name server===
Caching name servers (&quot;DNS caches&quot;) are usually recursive resolvers that store DNS query results for a period of time determined in the configuration (time-to-live) of each domain-name record. DNS caches improve the efficiency of the DNS by reducing DNS traffic across the Internet, and by reducing load on authoritative name-servers, particularly root name-servers. Because they can answer questions more quickly, they also increase the performance of end-user applications that use the DNS.

Caching name servers are often also recursive name servers—they perform every step necessary to answer any DNS query they receive. To do this the name server queries each authoritative name-server in turn, starting from the DNS root zone. It continues until it reaches the authoritative server for the zone that contains the queried domain name. That server provides the answer to the question, or definitively says it can&#x27;t be answered, and the &quot;caching resolver&quot; then returns this response to the client that asked the question.
The authority, resolving and caching functions can all be present in a DNS server implementation, but this is not required: a DNS server can implement any one of these functions alone, without implementing the others.
Internet service providers typically provide caching resolvers for their customers. In addition, many home-networking routers implement caching resolvers to improve efficiency in the local network.
Some systems utilize codice_1, which stands for the &quot;name service caching daemon&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Medea (; ; ) is the daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis. In the myth of Jason and the Argonauts, she aids Jason in his search for the Golden Fleece. Medea later marries him, but eventually kills their children and his other bride according to some versions of her story. Medea is known in most stories as a sorceress and is often depicted as a priestess of the goddess Hecate. She first appears in Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; around 700 BCE, but is best known from Euripides&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Medea&quot; and Apollonius of Rhodes&#x27;s epic &quot;Argonautica&quot;.

As a daughter of King Aeëtes, she is a mythical granddaughter of the sun god Helios and a niece of Circe, an enchantress goddess.
Her mother might have been Idyia. 
She plays the archetypal role of helper-maiden, aiding Jason in his search for the Golden Fleece. In said quest, she uses her magic to save his life and kills her brother to allow Jason to escape. Once he finishes his quest, she abandons her native home of Colchis and flees westwards with Jason, where they eventually settle in Corinth and marry. 

Euripides&#x27;s 5th-century BC tragedy &quot;Medea&quot; depicts the ending of her union with Jason, when after ten years of marriage, Jason intends to abandon her to wed King Creon&#x27;s daughter Creusa. Jason argues that their sons will have a better future in the city if he marries the King&#x27;s daughter and his sons stay in the same city with him. He claims the sacred vows he has with Medea can be broken because she is a foreigner, which makes their marriage illegitimate. Medea is exiled from Corinth by King Creon, and is offered refuge in Athens by King Aegeus after she offers to help him get an heir with her magic. In revenge against Jason, Medea murders her own sons and Jason&#x27;s new bride, King Creon&#x27;s daughter, with a poisoned crown and robes, so that Jason will be without heir and legacy for the rest of his life. 

What happens afterwards varies according to several accounts. Herodotus in his &quot;Histories&quot; mentions that she ended up leaving Athens and settling in the Iranian plateau among the Aryans, who subsequently changed their name to the Medes.

== Genealogy and divinity ==

Medea is a direct descendant of the sun god Helios (son of the Titan Hyperion and Titaness Theia) through her father King Aeëtes of Colchis. According to Hesiod (&quot;Theogony&quot; 956–962), Helios and the Oceanid Perseis produced two children, Circe and Aeëtes. Aeëtes then married the Oceanid Idyia and Medea was their child. From here, Medea&#x27;s family tree becomes a little more complicated and disputed. By some accounts, Aeëtes and Idyia only had two daughters, Medea and Chalciope (or Chalkiope). There was one son, Absyrtus (or Apsyrtus), who was the son of Aeëtes through Asterodea. This would make him a half-brother to Medea herself. According to others, Idyia gave birth to Medea and Apsyrtus while Asterodea gave birth to Chalciope. Even with the two differing accounts, it is known that Medea has a sister and a brother. 

As she becomes older, Medea marries Jason and together they have children. The number and names of their children are questioned by scholars. Depending on the account, it is two to fourteen children. In his play, &quot;Medea&quot;, Euripides mentions two unnamed sons. According to other accounts, her children were &quot;Mermerus, Pheres or Thessalus, Alcimenes and Tisander, and according to others, she had seven sons and seven daughters, while others mention only two children, Medus (some call him Polyxenus) and Eriopis, or one son Argos.&quot; No matter the number of children, Medea eventually leaves Jason in Corinth, and marries the King of Athens (Aegeus) and bears him a son. While with him, it is questioned if that was when she had her son Medeius, who goes on to become the ancestor of the Medes by conquering their lands.

Understanding Medea&#x27;s genealogy helps define her divinity. By some accounts, like the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, she is depicted as a young, mortal woman who is directly influenced by the Greek gods Hera and Aphrodite. While she possesses magical abilities, she is still a mortal with divine ancestry. Other accounts, like Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;Medea&quot;, focus on her mortality. Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Theogony&quot; places her marriage to Jason on the list of marriages between mortals and divine, suggesting that she is predominantly divine. She also has connections with Hecate, the goddess of magic, which could be one of the main sources from which she draws her magical ties. Although distinct from the Titan known as Perses, who is known for fathering Hecate, the goddess of witchcraft, Diodorus Siculus in his &quot;Bibliotheca historica&quot; made Perses of Colchis the father of Hecate by an unknown mother; Perses&#x27; brother Aeëtes then married Hecate and had Medea and Circe by her.

== Mythology ==

===Jason and Medea===

Medea is first introduced in Greek Mythology after Jason came from Iolcus to Colchis in an attempt to claim his inheritance and throne by retrieving the Golden Fleece. In the most complete surviving account, the &quot;Argonautica&quot; of Apollonius of Rhodes, Hera convinced Aphrodite or Eros to cast a spell on Medea so that she would fall in love with Jason and promise her skills to help him. She does promise her skills, but only if he agreed to marry her. Jason agreed, knowing Medea and her powers would help him in the long run. In a familiar mythic motif, Jason is promised the Golden Fleece through Aeëtes, but only if Jason could complete a list of tasks. The first harrowing task was ploughing a field with fire-breathing oxen that Jason had to yoke himself. To aid him in this, Medea gave him an unguent, called the &quot;Charm of Prometheus&quot;, to anoint himself and his weapons, to protect them from the bulls&#x27; fiery breath. After ploughing the field, Jason had to sow the teeth of a dragon. This task seemed to be fairly simple, but Medea forewarned him that the teeth would spring into soldiers. To combat this, she told him to throw a rock into the crowd to cause confusion among the soldiers. The soldiers, now confused, would then begin to attack and kill each other instead of Jason. For the last task, Aeëtes assigned Jason to fight and kill the sleepless dragon that guarded the fleece. Medea aided Jason in this task by putting the beast to sleep with her narcotic herbs. Once the dragon was asleep, Jason then took the fleece and sailed away with Medea as promised. Medea distracted her father as they fled by killing her brother Absyrtus. Knowing that the Argonaut&#x27;s journey back home would be just as perilous and deadly without divine intervention, Hera requested the help of Thetis. To convince the sea nymph, Hera told Thetis of her deep love and affection for her, as she never gave in to Zeus&#x27; advances, no matter how strongly he felt towards the nymph. Hera also calls unto Thetis&#x27; motherly love for her son Achilles, to protect Medea, his future beloved, stating that the day will come when, in the Elysian Fields, &quot;it is fated that he wed Medea, Aeëtes&#x27; daughter, there.&quot; 

In some versions, Medea was said to have dismembered her brother&#x27;s body and scattered his parts on an island, knowing her father would stop to retrieve them for proper burial; in other versions, it was Absyrtus himself who pursued them and was killed by Jason. However, in the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, Medea and Jason stopped on her aunt Circe&#x27;s private isle of Aiaia so that she could be cleansed after murdering her brother, relieving her of blame for the deed. This is one of the times we see Medea use her powers. During the fight, Atalanta, someone helping Jason in his quest, was seriously wounded. Medea was able to use her powers to heal the wound.
On the way back to Thessaly, Medea prophesied that Euphemus, the helmsman of Jason&#x27;s ship, the &quot;Argo&quot;, would one day rule over all of Libya. Pindar alleges that this came true through Battus, saying that he was a distant descendant of Euphemus (by 17 generations).

After the prophecy, the &quot;Argo&quot; reached the island of Crete, guarded by the bronze man, Talos (Talus). Talos had one vein which went from his neck to his ankle, bound shut by a single bronze nail. According to Apollodorus, Talos was slain either when Medea drove him mad with drugs, deceived him that she would make him immortal by removing the nail, or was killed by Poeas&#x27;s arrow. In the &quot;Argonautica&quot;, Medea hypnotized him from the &quot;Argo&quot;, driving him mad so that he dislodged the nail, ichor flowed from the wound, and he bled to death. After Talos died, the &quot;Argo&quot; landed.

At some point while in Thessaly, Medea and the Nereid, Thetis (the future mother of Achilles), argued over which one was the most beautiful. They appointed the Cretan Idomeneus as the judge, who declared Thetis to be the most beautiful. In her anger, Medea called all Cretans liars, and cursed them to never say the truth.

Jason, celebrating his return with the Golden Fleece, noted that his father Aeson was too aged and infirm to participate in the celebrations. Medea understood the impact this had on Jason and was able to invigorate him by withdrawing the blood from Aeson&#x27;s body, infused it with certain herbs, and returning it to his veins. The daughters of King Pelias saw this and asked Medea to perform the same service on their father. Medea agreed.

However, the service was never performed. Hera, who was angry at Pelias, conspired to make Jason fall in love with Medea, who, Hera hoped, would kill Pelias. Hera&#x27;s plan worked, and the pair fell in love with each other. When they returned to Iolcus, Pelias refused to give up his throne to Jason. Jason had been promised the throne in turn for the Golden Fleece. So, Medea conspired to have Pelias&#x27;s own daughters kill him. She demonstrated her powers to them by showing her cutting up an old ram and putting the pieces in stew. Once the pieces were in, Medea added some magic herbs and stirred the concoction, a young ram suddenly jumping out of the stew. Excited at the sight, the girls cut their father into pieces and threw him into a pot. Unfortunately, the King never came to life. Having killed Pelias, Jason and Medea fled to Corinth.

While in Corinth, the couple were married and lived together for 10 years. They had between one and fourteen children depending on the source. The known children are sons Alcimenes, Thessalus, Tisander, Mermeros and Pheres, Medus, and Argos, and a daughter, Eriopis. As well as having children, a myth states that Medea ended a famine in Corinth by sacrificing to Demeter and the nymphs. Zeus then desired her, but she declined his advances in order not to incur Hera&#x27;s wrath. As a reward, Hera offered to make her children immortal.

===Various Myth endings===
In Corinth, Jason abandoned Medea for the king, Creon&#x27;s daughter, Glauce. Before the fifth century BCE, there seem to have been two variants of the myth&#x27;s conclusion. According to the poet Eumelus, to whom the fragmentary epic &quot;Korinthiaka&quot; is usually attributed, Medea killed her children by accident. She buried them alive in the Temple of Hera, believing this would make them immortal. The poet Creophylus, however, blamed their murders on the citizens of Corinth.

According to Euripides&#x27;s version, Medea took her revenge by sending Glauce a dress and golden coronet, covered in poison. This resulted in the deaths of both the princess and the king, Creon, when he went to save his daughter. Medea then continued her revenge, murdering two of her children herself and refusing to allow Jason to hold the bodies. Afterward, she left Corinth and flew to Athens in a golden chariot driven by dragons sent by her grandfather, Helios, god of the sun.

Although Jason in Euripides calls Medea most hateful to gods and men, the fact that the chariot is given to her by Helios indicates that she has the Gods on her side. As Bernard Knox points out, Medea&#x27;s last scene parallels that of a number of indisputably divine beings in other plays by Euripides. Just like these gods, Medea &quot;interrupts and puts a stop to the violent action of the human being on the lower level&quot; and &quot;justifies her savage revenge on the grounds that she has been treated with disrespect and mockery&quot; so that she &quot;takes measures and gives orders for the burial of the dead, prophesies the future,&quot; and &quot;announces the foundation of a cult.&quot; This deliberate murder of her children by Medea appears to be Euripides&#x27;s invention, although some scholars believe Neophron created this alternate tradition. Her filicide would go on to become the standard for later writers. Pausanias, writing in the late 2nd century CE, records five different versions of what happened to Medea&#x27;s children after reporting that he has seen a monument for them while traveling in Corinth. Fleeing from Jason, Medea made her way to Thebes, where she healed Heracles (the former Argonaut) from the curse of Hera (that led him to slay his sons).

After the murder of her children, Medea fled to Athens, where she met and married Aegeus. They had one son, Medus. Another version from Hesiod makes Medus the son of Jason. Her domestic bliss was once again shattered by the arrival of Aegeus&#x27;s long-lost son, Theseus. Determined to preserve her own son&#x27;s inheritance, Medea convinced her husband that Theseus was an imposter, making him a threat and that he needed to be disposed of. To do this, Medea was planning on poisoning him as she previously had other victims. As Medea handed Theseus a cup of poison, Aegeus recognized the young man&#x27;s sword as his own, which he had left behind many years previously for his newborn son as soon as he came of age. Knocking the cup from Medea&#x27;s hand, Aegeus embraced Theseus as his own.

Medea returned to Colchis and found that Aeëtes had been deposed by his brother Perses, which prompted her to kill her uncle and restore the kingdom to her father. Herodotus reports another version, in which Medea and her son Medus fled from Athens, on her flying chariot. They landed in the Iranian plateau and lived among the Aryans, who then changed their name to the Medes.

Recounting the many variations of Medea&#x27;s story, the 1st century BCE historian Diodorus Siculus wrote, &quot;Speaking generally, it is because of the desire of the tragic poets for the marvelous that so varied and inconsistent an account of Medea has been given out.&quot;

These are extreme actions, yet in many ways understandable, logically situated within the confines of her position and societal constraints. In Euripides&#x27; play, Medea is a foreign woman living within the patriarchal society, abandoned by her husband Jason for another woman. Her choices are born from a place of rational calculation to reclaim agency in a world that has taken it from her. In fact, in the analysis of Greek tragedy made by Sarah Iles Johnston, the revenge of Medea serves &quot;as a means of reasserting her identity and ensuring that her enemies pay for their betrayal&quot;. Having killed Jason&#x27;s new bride and their children, she made his betrayal cause suffering and not success. While her actions certainly go against conventional morality, they do follow a tragic logic that is determined by the need for justice and the need of self-preservation. This underlines even further the rational approach of Medea&#x27;s intelligence and strategic planning, evidenced by how she manipulated others in order to get what she wanted. In a society where women had limited means for justice, Medea&#x27;s revenge takes the form of balance--however harsh--which is calculated in righting the books. Thus, in the light of her situation, her actions bring out rationality in extreme measures.

==&quot;Personae&quot; of Medea==
In Euripides&#x27;s play &quot;Medea,&quot; she is a woman scorned, rejected by her husband Jason and revenge seeking. Deborah Boedeker writes about different images and symbolism Euripides used in his play to evoke responses from his original Athenian audience. The Nurse, one of the characters, gives descriptions of Medea in the prologue, highlighting comparisons to great forces of nature and different animals. There are also many nautical references throughout the play either used by other characters when describing Medea or by Medea herself. By including these references, Boedeker argues that these comparisons were used to create connections to the type of woman Medea was. She holds great power (referred to by the comparisons to forces of nature), she relies on her basic animal-like instincts and emotions (connections to different animals like bulls and lions), and it draws the audience back to her original myth of Jason&#x27;s quest for the Golden Fleece and the sea voyage taken by Jason, Medea, and the Argonauts.

Emma Griffiths also adds to the analysis of Medea&#x27;s character in Euripides&#x27;s play by discussing the male/female dichotomy created by Euripides. Medea does not fit into the mold of a &quot;normal woman&quot; according to Athenian philosophy. She is depicted as having great intelligence and skill, traits typically viewed as masculine by Euripides&#x27;s original audience. On the other hand, she uses her intelligence to manipulate the men around her. This manipulation would have been a negative female trait to the Athenian audience. Griffiths also acknowledges the paradox of the methods Medea uses to kill. She poisons the princess, which would have been seen as a feminine way of murder, yet kills her children in cold blood, which is seen as more masculine. Medea is also shown as a &#x27;normal&#x27; Athenian mother by having a dialogue about her children and showing a strong maternal love and connection to them. Yet at the end of the play, she is able to kill her children as part of her revenge. It is through these opposites that Euripides creates a complicated character for his protagonist.

Marianne McDonald argues that &quot;Medea&#x27;s anger turns to violent action, which can make her into a symbol of freedom, and emblem for the colonized turning the tables on the colonizer. Euripides, more than all other tragedians, has predicted many of the horrors that occur in the modern world, showing both the glory and the monstrosity of the oppressed turned oppressor.&quot;

Although not the first depiction of Medea, the &quot;Argonautica&quot; by Apollonius of Rhodes gives a fuller description of events that lead up to Euripides&#x27;s play, mainly surrounding Jason&#x27;s quest for the Golden Fleece. In this literary work, Medea is presented not as a powerful woman seeking justice, but as a young woman who is desperately in love with Jason. So much in love that she decides to defy her father and kill her brother in order to help him. James J. Clauss writes about this Medea, attempting to unearth another version of this character for scholarship and discussion. He looks into different passages in the original text to define the meaning and draw connection to the different feelings Medea was going through. He argues the feelings of Medea&#x27;s initial love for Jason, the shame she feels for loving him and for going against her family, and final agreement to help Jason in his quest.

Multiple scholars have discussed Medea&#x27;s use as a &quot;helper maiden&quot; to Jason&#x27;s quest. A helper maid is typically a young woman who helps on a hero&#x27;s quest, usually out of love. Instead of being the center of the story, like she is in Euripides&#x27;s &quot;Medea&quot;, this version of Medea is reduced to a supporting role. Her main purpose is to help the hero with his quest. Jason would never have been successful on his quest without Medea&#x27;s help, something that is pointed out and referenced many times in ancient texts and contemporary scholarly work.

Other, non-literary traditions guided the vase-painters, and a localized, chthonic presence of Medea was propitiated with unrecorded emotional overtones at Corinth, at the sanctuary devoted to her slain children, or locally venerated elsewhere as a foundress of cities.

=== Medea as Divine Agent ===

A mortal with divine ancestry—Medea is the granddaughter of Helios—she seems to kill without consequence, suggesting that she acts as an agent of divine force (similar to Nemesis) and, as-such, is immune from vengeance that typically comes to mortals who commit injustice: 
* When her own father, Aeëtes, reneges on his promise to relinquish ownership of the Golden Fleece to Jason if he completes the tasks he set Jason, he loses his son, Absyrtus. 
* When King Pelias, Jason&#x27;s half-uncle, reneges on his promise to relinquish his stolen throne--the throne of Iolcus to the rightful heir, Jason--if Jason went on a quest to bring him the Golden Fleece, his own daughters are tricked into butchering him in a sabotaged attempt to restore his youth. 
* Later, when the Corinthian King, King Creon, allows Jason to woo his daughter, Glauce, despite the fact that they both know that Jason was already married to Medea--a marriage arranged by the Queen of the Gods &quot;and&quot; the goddess of marriage, Hera--both he and his daughter are both killed by an heirloom dress and crown (gifts of Helios&#x27;s to Medea), which had been poisoned by Medea. 

After Medea kills her brother, Absyrtus, she, Jason, and the others stop at her aunt Circe&#x27;s island, Aeaea, to be absolved of the crime. When they return to Iolcus, in Thessaly, Medea convinces Pelias&#x27;s daughters to kill their father with trickery. After this, they are, technically, an accessory to a murder—and Pelias corrupt supporters amongst Iolcus&#x27;s noble class in his own usurpation of his half-brother&#x27;s throne unite to block Jason&#x27;s claim to his father&#x27;s throne to protect their own status—so they&#x27;re forced to leave. They go to Corinth, where Jason proceeds to court and marry Glauce, a princess of Corinth, where Jason loses Hera&#x27;s favor and gains Medea&#x27;s wrath. King Creon tells Medea that she has twenty-four hours to leave, and if she doesn&#x27;t she&#x27;ll be killed. Jason comes to scold Medea and she in turn accuses him of denying his oath to the gods. Despite her previous crimes, Medea seems to have the approval of the gods. Next, Medea resolves her time to kill Glauce with a potion that causes her to catch fire. Her father Creon dies also when he in grief hugs his daughter and dies from the same poison. Medea proceeds to kill her and Jason&#x27;s children as well, and before Jason can stop her, she is escorted away on a flying chariot sent by her grandfather, Helios. Later, Medea marries King Aegeus and the two produce a son named Medus. When Theseus returns in an attempt to prove he is Aegeus&#x27;s son, Medea recognizes that he will be the heir to the throne rather than Medus, and convinces Aegeus to poison Theseus&#x27;s drink. Aegeus realizes Theseus is his son and throws the drink away. Medea is forced to leave with Medus, where they return to Colchis where Medus eventually claims the title of king. Medea sits in an odd position where though she kills many people, she never seems to face any divine consequence from it. Perhaps her actions are in keeping with the favor of the gods. True or not, Medea is framed as a curiously nuanced figure, something rare for women in Greek Mythology.

=== Modern references ===
In his book &quot;The Happiness Hypothesis&quot;, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt quotes Medea talking about her struggle between her love to Jason and obligation to her father, as an example for &quot;The divided Self&quot; and the conflict between Id and Superego:

&quot;I am dragged along by a strange new force. Desire and reason are pulling in different directions. I see the right way and approve it, but follow the wrong.”

<doc id="39248" wikidata="Q1322614" url="?curid=39248" title="Limit (category theory)">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the abstract notion of a limit captures the essential properties of universal constructions such as products, pullbacks and inverse limits. The dual notion of a colimit generalizes constructions such as disjoint unions, direct sums, coproducts, pushouts and direct limits.

Limits and colimits, like the strongly related notions of universal properties and adjoint functors, exist at a high level of abstraction. In order to understand them, it is helpful to first study the specific examples these concepts are meant to generalize.

== Definition ==
Limits and colimits in a category formula_1 are defined by means of diagrams in formula_1. Formally, a diagram of shape formula_3 in formula_1 is a functor from formula_3 to formula_1:
:formula_7
The category formula_3 is thought of as an index category, and the diagram formula_9 is thought of as indexing a collection of objects and morphisms in formula_1 patterned on formula_3.

One is most often interested in the case where the category formula_3 is a small or even finite category. A diagram is said to be small or finite whenever formula_3 is.

===Limits===

Let formula_14 be a diagram of shape formula_3 in a category formula_1. A cone to formula_9 is an object formula_18 of formula_1 together with a family formula_20 of morphisms indexed by the objects formula_21 of formula_3, such that for every morphism formula_23 in formula_3, we have formula_25.

A limit of the diagram formula_26 is a cone formula_27 to formula_9 such that for every cone formula_29 to formula_9 there exists a &quot;unique&quot; morphism formula_31 such that formula_32 for all formula_21 in formula_3.

One says that the cone formula_29 factors through the cone formula_27 with
the unique factorization formula_37. The morphism formula_37 is sometimes called the mediating morphism.

Limits are also referred to as &quot;universal cones&quot;, since they are characterized by a universal property (see below for more information). As with every universal property, the above definition describes a balanced state of generality: The limit object formula_39 has to be general enough to allow any cone to factor through it; on the other hand, formula_39 has to be sufficiently specific, so that only &quot;one&quot; such factorization is possible for every cone.

Limits may also be characterized as terminal objects in the category of cones to &quot;F&quot;.

It is possible that a diagram does not have a limit at all. However, if a diagram does have a limit then this limit is essentially unique: it is unique up to a unique isomorphism. For this reason one often speaks of &quot;the&quot; limit of &quot;F&quot;.

===Colimits===

The dual notions of limits and cones are colimits and co-cones. Although it is straightforward to obtain the definitions of these by inverting all morphisms in the above definitions, we will explicitly state them here:

A co-cone of a diagram formula_26 is an object formula_18 of formula_1 together with a family of morphisms
:formula_44

for every object formula_21 of formula_3, such that for every morphism formula_47 in formula_3, we have formula_49.

A colimit of a diagram formula_26 is a co-cone formula_27 of formula_9 such that for any other co-cone formula_29 of formula_9 there exists a unique morphism formula_55 such that formula_56 for all formula_21 in formula_3.

Colimits are also referred to as &quot;universal co-cones&quot;. They can be characterized as initial objects in the category of co-cones from formula_9.

As with limits, if a diagram formula_9 has a colimit then this colimit is unique up to a unique isomorphism.

===Variations===
Limits and colimits can also be defined for collections of objects and morphisms without the use of diagrams. The definitions are the same (note that in definitions above we never needed to use composition of morphisms in formula_3). This variation, however, adds no new information. Any collection of objects and morphisms defines a (possibly large) directed graph formula_62. If we let formula_3 be the free category generated by formula_62, there is a universal diagram formula_26 whose image contains formula_62. The limit (or colimit) of this diagram is the same as the limit (or colimit) of the original collection of objects and morphisms.

Weak limit and weak colimits are defined like limits and colimits, except that the uniqueness property of the mediating morphism is dropped.

==Examples==

===Limits===

The definition of limits is general enough to subsume several constructions useful in practical settings. In the following we will consider the limit (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) of a diagram &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot;.
*Terminal objects. If &quot;J&quot; is the empty category there is only one diagram of shape &quot;J&quot;: the empty one (similar to the empty function in set theory). A cone to the empty diagram is essentially just an object of &quot;C&quot;. The limit of &quot;F&quot; is any object that is uniquely factored through by every other object. This is just the definition of a &quot;terminal object&quot;.
*Products. If &quot;J&quot; is a discrete category then a diagram &quot;F&quot; is essentially nothing but a family of objects of &quot;C&quot;, indexed by &quot;J&quot;. The limit &quot;L&quot; of &quot;F&quot; is called the &quot;product&quot; of these objects. The cone &quot;φ&quot; consists of a family of morphisms &quot;φ&quot;&quot;X&quot; : &quot;L&quot; → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) called the &quot;projections&quot; of the product. In the category of sets, for instance, the products are given by Cartesian products and the projections are just the natural projections onto the various factors.
**Powers. A special case of a product is when the diagram &quot;F&quot; is a constant functor to an object &quot;X&quot; of &quot;C&quot;. The limit of this diagram is called the &quot;Jth power&quot; of &quot;X&quot; and denoted &quot;X&quot;&quot;J&quot;.
*Equalizers. If &quot;J&quot; is a category with two objects and two parallel morphisms from one object to the other, then a diagram of shape &quot;J&quot; is a pair of parallel morphisms in &quot;C&quot;. The limit &quot;L&quot; of such a diagram is called an &quot;equalizer&quot; of those morphisms.
**Kernels. A &quot;kernel&quot; is a special case of an equalizer where one of the morphisms is a zero morphism.
*Pullbacks. Let &quot;F&quot; be a diagram that picks out three objects &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, and &quot;Z&quot; in &quot;C&quot;, where the only non-identity morphisms are &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;g&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;Z&quot;. The limit &quot;L&quot; of &quot;F&quot; is called a &quot;pullback&quot; or a &quot;fiber product&quot;. It can nicely be visualized as a commutative square:

*Inverse limits. Let &quot;J&quot; be a directed set (considered as a small category by adding arrows &quot;i&quot; → &quot;j&quot; if and only if &quot;i&quot; ≥ &quot;j&quot;) and let &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot;op → &quot;C&quot; be a diagram. The limit of &quot;F&quot; is called an &quot;inverse limit&quot; or &quot;projective limit&quot;.
*If &quot;J&quot; = 1, the category with a single object and morphism, then a diagram of shape &quot;J&quot; is essentially just an object &quot;X&quot; of &quot;C&quot;. A cone to an object &quot;X&quot; is just a morphism with codomain &quot;X&quot;. A morphism &quot;f&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;X&quot; is a limit of the diagram &quot;X&quot; if and only if &quot;f&quot; is an isomorphism. More generally, if &quot;J&quot; is any category with an initial object &quot;i&quot;, then any diagram of shape &quot;J&quot; has a limit, namely any object isomorphic to &quot;F&quot;(&quot;i&quot;). Such an isomorphism uniquely determines a universal cone to &quot;F&quot;.
*Topological limits. Limits of functions are a special case of limits of filters, which are related to categorical limits as follows. Given a topological space &quot;X&quot;, denote by &quot;F&quot; the set of filters on &quot;X&quot;, &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot; a point, &quot;V&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) ∈ &quot;F&quot; the neighborhood filter of &quot;x&quot;, &quot;A&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot; a particular filter and formula_67 the set of filters finer than &quot;A&quot; and that converge to &quot;x&quot;. The filters &quot;F&quot; are given a small and thin category structure by adding an arrow &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot; if and only if &quot;A&quot; ⊆ &quot;B&quot;. The injection formula_68 becomes a functor and the following equivalence holds :

:: &quot;x&quot; is a topological limit of &quot;A&quot; if and only if &quot;A&quot; is a categorical limit of formula_69

===Colimits===

Examples of colimits are given by the dual versions of the examples above:
*Initial objects are colimits of empty diagrams.
*Coproducts are colimits of diagrams indexed by discrete categories.
**Copowers are colimits of constant diagrams from discrete categories.
*Coequalizers are colimits of a parallel pair of morphisms.
**Cokernels are coequalizers of a morphism and a parallel zero morphism.
*Pushouts are colimits of a pair of morphisms with common domain.
*Direct limits are colimits of diagrams indexed by directed sets.

== Properties ==

=== Existence of limits ===
A given diagram &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; may or may not have a limit (or colimit) in &quot;C&quot;. Indeed, there may not even be a cone to &quot;F&quot;, let alone a universal cone.

A category &quot;C&quot; is said to have limits of shape &quot;J&quot; if every diagram of shape &quot;J&quot; has a limit in &quot;C&quot;. Specifically, a category &quot;C&quot; is said to
*have products if it has limits of shape &quot;J&quot; for every &quot;small&quot; discrete category &quot;J&quot; (it need not have large products),
*have equalizers if it has limits of shape formula_70 (i.e. every parallel pair of morphisms has an equalizer),
*have pullbacks if it has limits of shape formula_71 (i.e. every pair of morphisms with common codomain has a pullback).
A complete category is a category that has all small limits (i.e. all limits of shape &quot;J&quot; for every small category &quot;J&quot;).

One can also make the dual definitions. A category has colimits of shape &quot;J&quot; if every diagram of shape &quot;J&quot; has a colimit in &quot;C&quot;. A cocomplete category is one that has all small colimits.

The existence theorem for limits states that if a category &quot;C&quot; has equalizers and all products indexed by the classes Ob(&quot;J&quot;) and Hom(&quot;J&quot;), then &quot;C&quot; has all limits of shape &quot;J&quot;. In this case, the limit of a diagram &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; can be constructed as the equalizer of the two morphisms
:formula_72
given (in component form) by
:formula_73
There is a dual existence theorem for colimits in terms of coequalizers and coproducts. Both of these theorems give sufficient and necessary conditions for the existence of all (co)limits of shape &quot;J&quot;.

=== Universal property ===
Limits and colimits are important special cases of universal constructions.

Let &quot;C&quot; be a category and let &quot;J&quot; be a small index category. The functor category &quot;C&quot;&quot;J&quot; may be thought of as the category of all diagrams of shape &quot;J&quot; in &quot;C&quot;. The &quot;diagonal functor&quot;
:formula_74
is the functor that maps each object &quot;N&quot; in &quot;C&quot; to the constant functor Δ(&quot;N&quot;) : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; to &quot;N&quot;. That is, Δ(&quot;N&quot;)(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;N&quot; for each object &quot;X&quot; in &quot;J&quot; and Δ(&quot;N&quot;)(&quot;f&quot;) = id&quot;N&quot; for each morphism &quot;f&quot; in &quot;J&quot;.

Given a diagram &quot;F&quot;: &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; (thought of as an object in &quot;C&quot;&quot;J&quot;), a natural transformation &quot;ψ&quot; : Δ(&quot;N&quot;) → &quot;F&quot; (which is just a morphism in the category &quot;C&quot;&quot;J&quot;) is the same thing as a cone from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;F&quot;. To see this, first note that Δ(&quot;N&quot;)(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;N&quot; for all X implies that the components of &quot;ψ&quot; are morphisms &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;X&quot; : &quot;N&quot; → &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), which all share the domain &quot;N&quot;. Moreover, the requirement that the cone&#x27;s diagrams commute is true simply because this &quot;ψ&quot; is a natural transformation. (Dually, a natural transformation &quot;ψ&quot; : &quot;F&quot; → Δ(&quot;N&quot;) is the same thing as a co-cone from &quot;F&quot; to &quot;N&quot;.)

Therefore, the definitions of limits and colimits can then be restated in the form:
*A limit of &quot;F&quot; is a universal morphism from Δ to &quot;F&quot;.
*A colimit of &quot;F&quot; is a universal morphism from &quot;F&quot; to Δ.

=== Adjunctions ===
Like all universal constructions, the formation of limits and colimits is functorial in nature. In other words, if every diagram of shape &quot;J&quot; has a limit in &quot;C&quot; (for &quot;J&quot; small) there exists a limit functor
:formula_75
which assigns each diagram its limit and each natural transformation η : &quot;F&quot; → &quot;G&quot; the unique morphism lim η : lim &quot;F&quot; → lim &quot;G&quot; commuting with the corresponding universal cones. This functor is right adjoint to the diagonal functor Δ : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot;&quot;J&quot;.
This adjunction gives a bijection between the set of all morphisms from &quot;N&quot; to lim &quot;F&quot; and the set of all cones from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;F&quot;
:formula_76
which is natural in the variables &quot;N&quot; and &quot;F&quot;. The counit of this adjunction is simply the universal cone from lim &quot;F&quot; to &quot;F&quot;. If the index category &quot;J&quot; is connected (and nonempty) then the unit of the adjunction is an isomorphism so that lim is a left inverse of Δ. This fails if &quot;J&quot; is not connected. For example, if &quot;J&quot; is a discrete category, the components of the unit are the diagonal morphisms δ : &quot;N&quot; → &quot;N&quot;&quot;J&quot;.

Dually, if every diagram of shape &quot;J&quot; has a colimit in &quot;C&quot; (for &quot;J&quot; small) there exists a colimit functor
:formula_77
which assigns each diagram its colimit. This functor is left adjoint to the diagonal functor Δ : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;C&quot;&quot;J&quot;, and one has a natural isomorphism
:formula_78
The unit of this adjunction is the universal cocone from &quot;F&quot; to colim &quot;F&quot;. If &quot;J&quot; is connected (and nonempty) then the counit is an isomorphism, so that colim is a left inverse of Δ.

Note that both the limit and the colimit functors are &quot;covariant&quot; functors.

=== As representations of functors ===

One can use Hom functors to relate limits and colimits in a category &quot;C&quot; to limits in Set, the category of sets. This follows, in part, from the fact the covariant Hom functor Hom(&quot;N&quot;, –) : &quot;C&quot; → Set preserves all limits in &quot;C&quot;. By duality, the contravariant Hom functor must take colimits to limits.

If a diagram &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; has a limit in &quot;C&quot;, denoted by lim &quot;F&quot;, there is a canonical isomorphism
:formula_79
which is natural in the variable &quot;N&quot;. Here the functor Hom(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;F&quot;–) is the composition of the Hom functor Hom(&quot;N&quot;, –) with &quot;F&quot;. This isomorphism is the unique one which respects the limiting cones.

One can use the above relationship to define the limit of &quot;F&quot; in &quot;C&quot;. The first step is to observe that the limit of the functor Hom(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;F&quot;–) can be identified with the set of all cones from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;F&quot;:
:formula_80
The limiting cone is given by the family of maps π&quot;X&quot; : Cone(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;F&quot;) → Hom(&quot;N&quot;, &quot;FX&quot;) where &quot;X&quot;(&quot;ψ&quot;) = &quot;ψ&quot;&quot;X&quot;. If one is given an object &quot;L&quot; of &quot;C&quot; together with a natural isomorphism &quot;Φ&quot; : Hom(&quot;L&quot;, –) → Cone(–, &quot;F&quot;), the object &quot;L&quot; will be a limit of &quot;F&quot; with the limiting cone given by &quot;Φ&quot;&quot;L&quot;(id&quot;L&quot;). In fancy language, this amounts to saying that a limit of &quot;F&quot; is a representation of the functor Cone(–, &quot;F&quot;) : &quot;C&quot; → Set.

Dually, if a diagram &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; has a colimit in &quot;C&quot;, denoted colim &quot;F&quot;, there is a unique canonical isomorphism
:formula_81
which is natural in the variable &quot;N&quot; and respects the colimiting cones. Identifying the limit of Hom(&quot;F&quot;–, &quot;N&quot;) with the set Cocone(&quot;F&quot;, &quot;N&quot;), this relationship can be used to define the colimit of the diagram &quot;F&quot; as a representation of the functor Cocone(&quot;F&quot;, –).

=== Interchange of limits and colimits of sets ===
Let &quot;I&quot; be a finite category and &quot;J&quot; be a small filtered category. For any bifunctor

:formula_82

there is a natural isomorphism

:formula_83

In words, filtered colimits in Set commute with finite limits. It also holds that small colimits commute with small limits.

==Functors and limits==
If &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; is a diagram in &quot;C&quot; and &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; is a functor then by composition (recall that a diagram is just a functor) one obtains a diagram &quot;GF&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;D&quot;. A natural question is then:
:“How are the limits of &quot;GF&quot; related to those of &quot;F&quot;?”

===Preservation of limits===
A functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; induces a map from Cone(&quot;F&quot;) to Cone(&quot;GF&quot;): if &quot;Ψ&quot; is a cone from &quot;N&quot; to &quot;F&quot; then &quot;GΨ&quot; is a cone from &quot;GN&quot; to &quot;GF&quot;. The functor &quot;G&quot; is said to preserve the limits of &quot;F&quot; if (&quot;GL&quot;, &quot;Gφ&quot;) is a limit of &quot;GF&quot; whenever (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) is a limit of &quot;F&quot;. (Note that if the limit of &quot;F&quot; does not exist, then &quot;G&quot; vacuously preserves the limits of &quot;F&quot;.)

A functor &quot;G&quot; is said to preserve all limits of shape &quot;J&quot; if it preserves the limits of all diagrams &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot;. For example, one can say that &quot;G&quot; preserves products, equalizers, pullbacks, etc. A continuous functor is one that preserves all &quot;small&quot; limits.

One can make analogous definitions for colimits. For instance, a functor &quot;G&quot; preserves the colimits of &quot;F&quot; if &quot;G&quot;(&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) is a colimit of &quot;GF&quot; whenever (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) is a colimit of &quot;F&quot;. A cocontinuous functor is one that preserves all &quot;small&quot; colimits.

If &quot;C&quot; is a complete category, then, by the above existence theorem for limits, a functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; is continuous if and only if it preserves (small) products and equalizers. Dually, &quot;G&quot; is cocontinuous if and only if it preserves (small) coproducts and coequalizers.

An important property of adjoint functors is that every right adjoint functor is continuous and every left adjoint functor is cocontinuous. Since adjoint functors exist in abundance, this gives numerous examples of continuous and cocontinuous functors.

For a given diagram &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; and functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot;, if both &quot;F&quot; and &quot;GF&quot; have specified limits there is a unique canonical morphism
:formula_84
which respects the corresponding limit cones. The functor &quot;G&quot; preserves the limits of &quot;F&quot; if and only if this map is an isomorphism. If the categories &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; have all limits of shape &quot;J&quot; then lim is a functor and the morphisms τ&quot;F&quot; form the components of a natural transformation
:formula_85
The functor &quot;G&quot; preserves all limits of shape &quot;J&quot; if and only if τ is a natural isomorphism. In this sense, the functor &quot;G&quot; can be said to &quot;commute with limits&quot; (up to a canonical natural isomorphism).

Preservation of limits and colimits is a concept that only applies to &quot;covariant&quot; functors. For contravariant functors the corresponding notions would be a functor that takes colimits to limits, or one that takes limits to colimits.

===Lifting of limits===
A functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; is said to lift limits for a diagram &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; if whenever (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) is a limit of &quot;GF&quot; there exists a limit (&quot;L&quot;′, &quot;φ&quot;′) of &quot;F&quot; such that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;L&quot;′, &quot;φ&quot;′) = (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;). A functor &quot;G&quot; lifts limits of shape &quot;J&quot; if it lifts limits for all diagrams of shape &quot;J&quot;. One can therefore talk about lifting products, equalizers, pullbacks, etc. Finally, one says that &quot;G&quot; lifts limits if it lifts all limits. There are dual definitions for the lifting of colimits.

A functor &quot;G&quot; lifts limits uniquely for a diagram &quot;F&quot; if there is a unique preimage cone (&quot;L&quot;′, &quot;φ&quot;′) such that (&quot;L&quot;′, &quot;φ&quot;′) is a limit of &quot;F&quot; and &quot;G&quot;(&quot;L&quot;′, &quot;φ&quot;′) = (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;). One can show that &quot;G&quot; lifts limits uniquely if and only if it lifts limits and is amnestic.

Lifting of limits is clearly related to preservation of limits. If &quot;G&quot; lifts limits for a diagram &quot;F&quot; and &quot;GF&quot; has a limit, then &quot;F&quot; also has a limit and &quot;G&quot; preserves the limits of &quot;F&quot;. It follows that:
*If &quot;G&quot; lifts limits of all shape &quot;J&quot; and &quot;D&quot; has all limits of shape &quot;J&quot;, then &quot;C&quot; also has all limits of shape &quot;J&quot; and &quot;G&quot; preserves these limits.
*If &quot;G&quot; lifts all small limits and &quot;D&quot; is complete, then &quot;C&quot; is also complete and &quot;G&quot; is continuous.
The dual statements for colimits are equally valid.

===Creation and reflection of limits===
Let &quot;F&quot; : &quot;J&quot; → &quot;C&quot; be a diagram. A functor &quot;G&quot; : &quot;C&quot; → &quot;D&quot; is said to
*create limits for &quot;F&quot; if whenever (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;) is a limit of &quot;GF&quot; there exists a unique cone (&quot;L&quot;′, &quot;φ&quot;′) to &quot;F&quot; such that &quot;G&quot;(&quot;L&quot;′, &quot;φ&quot;′) = (&quot;L&quot;, &quot;φ&quot;), and furthermore, this cone is a limit of &quot;F&quot;.
*reflect limits for &quot;F&quot; if each cone to &quot;F&quot; whose image under &quot;G&quot; is a limit of &quot;GF&quot; is already a limit of &quot;F&quot;.
Dually, one can define creation and reflection of colimits.

The following statements are easily seen to be equivalent:
*The functor &quot;G&quot; creates limits.
*The functor &quot;G&quot; lifts limits uniquely and reflects limits.
There are examples of functors which lift limits uniquely but neither create nor reflect them.

===Examples===
* Every representable functor &quot;C&quot; → Set preserves limits (but not necessarily colimits). In particular, for any object &quot;A&quot; of &quot;C&quot;, this is true of the covariant Hom functor Hom(&quot;A&quot;,–) : &quot;C&quot; → Set.
* The forgetful functor &quot;U&quot; : Grp → Set creates (and preserves) all small limits and filtered colimits; however, &quot;U&quot; does not preserve coproducts. This situation is typical of algebraic forgetful functors.
* The free functor &quot;F&quot; : Set → Grp (which assigns to every set &quot;S&quot; the free group over &quot;S&quot;) is left adjoint to forgetful functor &quot;U&quot; and is, therefore, cocontinuous. This explains why the free product of two free groups &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot; is the free group generated by the disjoint union of the generators of &quot;G&quot; and &quot;H&quot;.
* The inclusion functor Ab → Grp creates limits but does not preserve coproducts (the coproduct of two abelian groups being the direct sum).
* The forgetful functor Top → Set lifts limits and colimits uniquely but creates neither.
* Let Met&quot;c&quot; be the category of metric spaces with continuous functions for morphisms. The forgetful functor Met&quot;c&quot; → Set lifts finite limits but does not lift them uniquely.

== A note on terminology ==
Older terminology referred to limits as &quot;inverse limits&quot; or &quot;projective limits&quot;, and to colimits as &quot;direct limits&quot; or &quot;inductive limits&quot;. This has been the source of a lot of confusion.

There are several ways to remember the modern terminology. First of all,
*cokernels,
*coproducts,
*coequalizers, and
*codomains
are types of colimits, whereas
*kernels,
*products
*equalizers, and
*domains
are types of limits. Second, the prefix &quot;co&quot; implies &quot;first variable of the formula_86&quot;. Terms like &quot;cohomology&quot; and &quot;cofibration&quot; all have a slightly stronger association with the first variable, i.e., the contravariant variable, of the formula_86 bifunctor.

<text>A playwright or dramatist is a person who writes plays, which are a form of drama that primarily consists of dialogue between characters and is intended for theatrical performance rather than just
reading. Ben Jonson coined the term &quot;playwright&quot; and is the first person in English literature to refer to playwrights as separate from poets. 

The earliest playwrights in Western literature with surviving works are the Ancient Greeks. William Shakespeare is amongst the most famous playwrights in literature, both in England and across the world.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;play&quot; is from Middle English , from Old English (&quot;play, exercise; sport, game; drama, applause&quot;). The word &quot;&quot; is an archaic English term for a craftsperson or builder (as in a wheelwright or cartwright). The words combine to indicate a person who has &quot;wrought&quot; words, themes, and other elements into a dramatic form—a play. (The homophone with &quot;write&quot; is coincidental.)

The first recorded use of the term &quot;playwright&quot; is from 1605, 73 years before the first written record of the term &quot;dramatist&quot;. It appears to have been first used in a pejorative sense by Ben Jonson to suggest a mere tradesman fashioning works for the theatre.

Jonson uses the word in his Epigram 49, which is thought to refer to John Marston or Thomas Dekker:

:&quot;Epigram XLIX — On Playwright&quot;
:PLAYWRIGHT me reads, and still my verses damns,
:He says I want the tongue of epigrams ;
:I have no salt, no bawdry he doth mean ;
:For witty, in his language, is obscene.
:Playwright, I loath to have thy manners known
:In my chaste book ; I profess them in thine own.

Jonson described himself as a poet, not a playwright, since plays during that time were written in meter and so were regarded as the province of poets. This view was held as late as the early 19th century. The term &quot;playwright&quot; later again lost this negative connotation.

==History==
===Early playwrights===
The earliest playwrights in Western literature with surviving works are the Ancient Greeks. These early plays were for annual Athenian competitions among play writers held around the 5th century BC. Such notables as Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, and Aristophanes established forms still relied on by their modern counterparts. We have complete texts extant by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. The origins of Athenian tragedy remain obscure, though by the 5th century it was institutionalised in competitions (&quot;agon&quot;) held as part of festivities celebrating Dionysos (the god of wine and fertility). As contestants in the City Dionysia&#x27;s competition (the most prestigious of the festivals to stage drama), playwrights were required to present a tetralogy of plays (though the individual works were not necessarily connected by story or theme), which usually consisted of three tragedies and one satyr play.

For the ancient Greeks, playwriting involved &quot;poïesis&quot;, &quot;the act of making&quot;. This is the source of the English word &quot;poet&quot;.

Despite Chinese Theatre having performers dated back to the 6th century BC with You Meng, their perspective of theatre was such that plays had no other role than &quot;performer&quot; or &quot;actor&quot;, but given that the performers were also the ones who invented their performances, they could be considered a form of playwright.

Outside of the Western world there is Indian classical drama, with one of the oldest known playwrights being Śudraka, whose attributed plays can be dated to the second century BC. The &quot;Nāṭya Shāstra&quot;, a text on the performing arts from between 500BC-500AD, categorizes playwrights as being among the members of a theatre company, although playwrights were generally the highest in social status, with some being kings. 

===Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; techniques===
In the 4th century BCE, Aristotle wrote his &quot;Poetics&quot;, in which he analyzed the principle of action or &quot;praxis&quot; as the basis for tragedy. He then considered elements of drama: plot (&quot; &quot;), character (&quot; &quot;), thought (&#x27;), diction (&#x27;), music (&#x27;), and spectacle (&#x27;). Since the myths on which Greek tragedy were based were widely known, plot had to do with the arrangement and selection of existing material. Character was determined by choice and by action. Tragedy is mimesis—&quot;the imitation of an action that is serious&quot;. He developed his notion of hamartia, or tragic flaw, an error in judgment by the main character or protagonist, which provides the basis for the &quot;conflict-driven&quot; play.
=== Medieval ===
There were also a number of secular performances staged in the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is &quot;The Play of the Greenwood&quot; by Adam de la Halle in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and folk material such as faeries and other supernatural occurrences. Farces also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. The majority of these plays come from France and Germany and are similar in tone and form, emphasizing sex and bodily excretions.

The best known playwright of farces is Hans Sachs (1494–1576) who wrote 198 dramatic works. In England, The Second Shepherds&#x27; Play of the Wakefield Cycle is the best known early farce. However, farce did not appear independently in England until the 16th century with the work of John Heywood (1497–1580).

Playwright William Shakespeare remains arguably the most influential writer in the English language, and his works continue to be studied and reinterpreted. Most playwrights of the period typically collaborated with others at some point, as critics agree Shakespeare did, mostly early and late in his career. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright.

In England, after the interregnum, and Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, there was a move toward neoclassical dramaturgy. Between the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660 and the end of the 17th century, classical ideas were in vogue. As a result, critics of the time mostly rated Shakespeare below John Fletcher and Ben Jonson. This period saw the first professional woman playwright, Aphra Behn.

As a reaction to the decadence of Charles II era productions, sentimental comedy grew in popularity. Playwrights like Colley Cibber and Richard Steele believed that humans were inherently good but capable of being led astray. 

=== Neo-classical theory ===
The Italian Renaissance brought about a stricter interpretation of Aristotle, as this long-lost work came to light in the late 15th century. The neoclassical ideal, which was to reach its apogee in France during the 17th century, dwelled upon the unities, of action, place, and time. This meant that the playwright had to construct the play so that its &quot;virtual&quot; time would not exceed 24 hours, that it would be restricted to a single setting, and that there would be no subplots. Other terms, such as verisimilitude and decorum, circumscribed the subject matter significantly. For example, verisimilitude limits of the unities. Decorum fitted proper protocols for behavior and language on stage. 
In France, contained too many events and actions, thus, violating the 24-hour restriction of the unity of time. Neoclassicism never had as much traction in England, and Shakespeare&#x27;s plays are directly opposed to these models, while in Italy, improvised and bawdy commedia dell&#x27;arte and opera were more popular forms. 

One structural unit that is still useful to playwrights today is the &quot;French scene&quot;, which is a scene in a play where the beginning and end are marked by a change in the makeup of the group of characters onstage rather than by the lights going up or down or the set being changed.

Notable playwrights:

* Pierre Corneille (1606–84)
* Molière (1622–73)
* Jean Racine (1639–99)

=== Cretan Renaissance theatre ===
Greek theater was alive and flourishing on the island of Crete. During the Cretan Renaissance two notable Greek playwrights Georgios Chortatzis and Vitsentzos Kornaros were present in the latter part of the 16th century.

=== 19th century ===
The plays of Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Friedrich Schiller, and other &quot;Sturm und Drang&quot; playwrights inspired a growing faith in feeling and instinct as guides to moral behavior and were part of the German romanticism movement. Aleksandr Ostrovsky was Russia&#x27;s first professional playwright). 

=== Contemporary playwrights in the United States ===
Author and playwright Agatha Christie wrote &quot;The Moustrap&quot;, a murder mystery play which is the longest-running West End show, it has by far the longest run of any play in the world, with its 29,500th performance having taken place as of February 2024.

Contemporary playwrights in the United States are affected by recent declines in theatre attendance. No longer the only outlet for serious drama or entertaining comedies, theatrical productions must use ticket sales as a source of income, which has caused many of them to reduce the number of new works being produced. For example, Playwrights Horizons produced only six plays in the 2002–03 seasons, compared with thirty-one in 1973–74. Playwrights commonly encounter difficulties in getting their shows produced and often cannot earn a living through their plays alone, leading them to take up other jobs to supplement their incomes.

Many playwrights are also film makers. For instance, filmmaker Morgan Spurlock began his career as a playwright, winning awards for his play &quot;The Phoenix&quot; at both the New York International Fringe Festival in 1999 and the Route 66 American Playwriting Competition in 2000.

====New play development====
Today, theatre companies have new play development programs meant to develop new American voices in playwriting. Many regional theatres have hired dramaturges and literary managers in an effort to showcase various festivals for new work, or bring in playwrights for residencies. Funding through national organizations, such as the National Endowment for the Arts and the Theatre Communications Group, encouraged the partnerships of professional theatre companies and emerging playwrights.

Playwrights will often have a cold reading of a script in an informal sitdown setting, which allows them to evaluate their own plays and the actors performing them. Cold reading means that the actors haven&#x27;t rehearsed the work, or may be seeing it for the first time, and usually, the technical requirements are minimal. The O&#x27;Neill Festival offers summer retreats for young playwrights to develop their work with directors and actors.

Playwriting collectives like 13P and Orbiter 3 gather members together to produce, rather than develop, new works. The idea of the playwriting collective is in response to plays being stuck in the development process and never advancing to production.

<text>Solidarity Electoral Action (, AWS) was a coalition of political parties in Poland, active from 1996 to 2001. AWS was the political arm of the Solidarity trade union, whose leader Lech Wałęsa (also an AWS member), was President of Poland from 1990 to 1995, and the successor of the parties emerged from the fragmentation of the Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee.

The coalition was led by Marian Krzaklewski and Jerzy Buzek, who was Prime Minister of Poland from 1997 to 2001.

Today&#x27;s main parties in Poland, Law and Justice and Civic Platform, came out from the ashes of AWS.

==History==
The AWS was formed in June 1996 as a coalition of over 30 Christian-democratic, conservative and liberal political parties, mostly from the Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee, the Solidarity trade union&#x27;s political wing. Among them, there were the Christian National Union, the Party of Christian Democrats, the Centre Agreement, the Conservative People&#x27;s Party (formed in January 1997), the Peasants&#x27; Agreement, the Movement for the Republic (until 1997), the Nonpartisan Bloc for Support of Reforms (until 1997) and the Confederation of Independent Poland (until 1998 and again since 2001). AWS&#x27;s founding leader was Marian Krzaklewski, who was also the leader of the Solidarity trade union, having succeeded to Lech Wałęsa in 1991.

In the 1997 parliamentary election, the AWS obtained 33.8% of the vote, 201 members of the Sejm and 51 of the Senate. After the election, AWS&#x27; member Jerzy Buzek formed a coalition government, which comprised also the liberal Freedom Union.

In December 1997, a new party, Social Movement (RS), was formed. It was joined by Krzaklewski, Buzek and several other non-party independents recommended by the Solidarity trade union and/or former members of the Solidarity Citizens&#x27; Committee. Consequently, the Social Movement soon became the largest faction within the coalition. The other factions were those associated with the Christian National Union, the Party of Christian Democrats and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party. In 1998, the Confederation of Independent Poland and a group that would form the Polish Agreement were excluded from the coalition. From these groups, the League of Polish Families would later be formed. In 1999, the Party of Christian Democrats, the Centre Agreement and the Movement for the Republic merged into the Polish Christian Democratic Agreement.

Reforms relating to domestic affairs, the entry to NATO in 1999 and the accession process to the European Union led to conflicts within the coalition.

In June 2000, the Freedom Union broke its alliance with the AWS and Buzek continued to govern at the head of a minority government.

In the 2000 presidential election, Krzaklewski was AWS&#x27; official candidate and won 15.6% of the vote, but a large chunk of the coalition, especially activists from the more liberal Conservative People&#x27;s Party, had supported the independent candidate Andrzej Olechowski, who won 17.3% of the vote. As a result, Aleksander Kwaśniewski of the post-communist Democratic Left Alliance was elected president; Krzaklewski resigned from his position of AWS leader in December 2000 and was replaced by Buzek in January 2001.

Also in January 2001, AWS became a federation comprising the Solidarity trade union, the Social Movement, the Christian National Union, the Polish Christian Democratic Agreement and the Conservative People&#x27;s Party. However, in March 2001 the Conservative People&#x27;s Party withdrew from the AWS and most of it would later join Civic Platform, which had been established in January 2001 by Olechowski, AWS splinter Maciej Płażyński and Freedom Union&#x27;s Donald Tusk. More importantly, in May the Solidarity trade union withdrew too. In June most of the structure of the Centre Agreement, which was originally a member of the AWS, along with right-wing dissidents from other AWS constituent parties formed Law and Justice, under the leadership of Jarosław Kaczyński and Lech Kaczyński. Between May and July the AWS had included the Movement for Reconstruction of Poland, which would later be associated with the League of Polish Families.

In the 2001 parliamentary election, the AWS was formed mainly of four components: the Social Movement, the Christian National Union, the Polish Christian Democratic Agreement and the Confederation of Independent Poland. The coalition won 5.6% and no seats, as the electoral threshold was 8%.

Most of the remaining AWS members later joined either Civic Platform (these included both Krzaklewski and Buzek; the latter has been a member of the European Parliament since 2004 and was its President in 2009–2012) or Law and Justice. In 2002, the Polish Christian Democratic Agreement was merged into what remained of the Conservative People&#x27;s Party. In 2004 the latter and the Social Movement were replaced by the Centre Party. The Conservative People&#x27;s Party was revived in 2007 and lasted until 2014, when it became part of Poland Together. The Christian National Union, most of whose members had joined the League of Polish Families, was active until 2010. Poland Together was transformed into Agreement in 2017.

==International relations==
The International Republican Institute, a United States federal government-funded organisation loosely associated with the United States Republican Party, claims credit for having played a major role in uniting the different political parties which came together to create the AWS. It claims to have provided training in political campaigning, communications training and research which helped organise and create the AWS. It also states that once the AWS was in government, it organised an advertising campaign for the Polish government in order to stop the AWS splitting up over internal tensions: &quot;IRI initiated a post-election program that emphasized media and communications training for Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek&#x27;s chancellory and cabinet&quot;.

<text>The Polish People&#x27;s Party (, PSL) is a conservative political party in Poland. It is currently led by Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz.

Its history traces back to 1895, when it held the name People&#x27;s Party, although its name was changed to the present one in 1903. During the Second Polish Republic, the Polish People&#x27;s Party was represented by a number of parties that held its name. They were all supportive of agrarian policies, although they spanned from the left-wing to the centre-right on the political spectrum. It was reformed to the People&#x27;s Party shortly after the Sanacja regime took power. It took part into the formation of Polish government-in-exile during the World War II, and after the war it was again reformed into the Polish People&#x27;s Party, and soon after into the United People&#x27;s Party. During the existence of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, it was seen as a satellite party of the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party that promoted rural interests. After the fall of communism, it participated in the governments led by the Democratic Left Alliance. In the mid-2000s, it began shifting more to the centre-right and it adopted more conservative policies. It entered in the government again following the 2007 parliamentary election, and since 2015 it has served in the opposition. Since 2015, the party abandoned agrarianism and shifted towards an economically liberal and non-ideological character. 

Today, it is positioned in the centre-right and leans towards the right-wing; besides conservative views, it is also Christian democratic, and supports Poland&#x27;s membership in the European Union. It currently has 19 seats in the Sejm and two seats in the Senate. On national level, it heads the Polish Coalition; further, on European level, it is a part of the European People&#x27;s Party.

==History==

===Before 1945===
The party&#x27;s name traces its tradition to an agrarian party in Austrian-controlled Kingdom of Galicia, which sent MPs to the parliament in Vienna. The party was formed in 1895 in the Polish town of Rzeszów under the name Stronnictwo Ludowe (People&#x27;s Party). The party changed its name in 1903 to what it&#x27;s known as now. The party was led by Wincenty Witos and was quite successful, seating representatives in the Galician parliament before the turn of the 19th century. In the Second Polish Republic there were a few parties named PSL (Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot;, Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot;, Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Left&quot; and others) until they were removed by the Sanacja regime (see also People&#x27;s Party).

During this time, there were two parties using the term &quot;Polish People&#x27;s Party&quot;, namely Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Piast&quot; and Polish People&#x27;s Party &quot;Wyzwolenie&quot; (which were merged into People&#x27;s Party with Stronnictwo Chłopskie). During World War II, PSL took part in forming the Polish government in exile.

===Under the communist regime===

In June 1945 after the war Stanisław Mikołajczyk, a PSL leader who had been Prime Minister of the Polish government in exile, returned to communist-dominated Poland, where he joined the provisional government and rebuilt PSL. The party hoped to win the Yalta Conference-mandated elections and help establish a parliamentary system in Poland. However, the party soon found itself targeted with intimidation, arrests and violence by the communist secret police.

The communists also formed a rival ersatz &#x27;Peasants&#x27; party&#x27; controlled by them, in order to confuse voters. The January 1947 parliamentary election was heavily rigged, with the communist-controlled bloc claiming to have won 80% of the vote. The PSL were said to have won just 10% of the vote, but many neutral observers believe the PSL would have won the election had it been conducted fairly.

Mikołajczyk was soon compelled to flee Poland for his life in October 1947. The communists then forced the remains of Mikołajczyk&#x27;s PSL to unite with the pro-communist People&#x27;s Party to form the United People&#x27;s Party. The ZSL was a governing partner in the ruling coalition.

=== Post-communist period (1990–2003) ===
Around the time of the fall of communism, several PSLs were recreated, including Porozumienie Ludowe, Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe-Odrodzenie, and Polskie Stronnictwo Ludowe (Wilanów faction). In 1989, most merged into one party and took part in forming the first postwar noncommunist government in Poland with the Solidarity grouping; in 1990, the party changed its name to PSL.

It remained on the left of Polish politics in the 1990s, entering into coalitions with the postcommunist Democratic Left Alliance. In the 2001 parliamentary elections, PSL received 9% of votes and formed a coalition with the Democratic Left Alliance, an alliance which later broke down. Since then, PSL has moved towards more centrist and conservative policies.

=== Opposition years (2003–2007) ===
The party ran in the 2004 European Parliament election as part of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) and received 6% of the vote, giving it four of 54 Polish seats in the European Parliament. In the 2005 general election, the party received 7% of votes, giving it 25 seats in the Sejm and two in the Senate. In the 2007 parliamentary elections, the party placed fourth, with 8.93% of the vote and 31 out of 460 seats, and entered into a governing coalition with the victor, the centre-right conservative Civic Platform. In European parliament elections PSL received 7.01% of votes in 2009. In the 2011 national parliamentary election, Polish People&#x27;s Party received 8.36% votes which gave them 28 seats in the Sejm and two mandates in the Senate.

=== Coalition government (2007–2015) ===
After the parliamentary elections in 2007, PSL won 8.91% of the popular vote and 31 seats, it joined the government coalition led by Civic Platform. Waldemar Pawlak was appointed deputy prime minister, Marek Sawicki was appointed as agriculture minister, and Jolanta Fedak was appointed as labor minister. In the 2009 European Parliament election, it won 3 seats. After the Smolensk air disaster, presidential elections were held in which Pawlak placed fifth, winning 1.75% of the vote. In the second round they didn&#x27;t state their support for anyone.

In the 2010 local government elections, PSL obtained 16.3% of the votes in the elections to voivodship assemblies, in which it received 93 seats. In the Świętokrzyskie sejmik, the party received the most seats. In all parliamentary assemblies, PSL found itself in ruling coalitions with the PO, in four voivodeships receiving the positions of marshals. In the elections to poviat councils, the PSL committee obtained 15.88%, and in the elections to municipal councils 11% of the votes. The PSL won the largest number of village leaders (428) and mayors in the country, and in Zgierz, the party&#x27;s candidate won the presidential election. In 2011, a PiS senator defected to PSL.

In the parliamentary elections of 2011, PSL obtained 8.36% of votes on the list of candidates for the Sejm. The party also won two seats in the Senate. Eugeniusz Grzeszczak became the deputy speaker of the Sejm on behalf of the PSL. PSL again became a partner of the PO in the government coalition. On December 7, 2011, as a result of the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty, Arkadiusz Bratkowski, a PSL politician, assumed a mandate in the European Parliament.

In July 2012, Stanisław Kalemba replaced Marek Sawicki as the minister of agriculture and rural development. Pawlak was defeated during the presidential election by Janusz Piechociński. Two days later, Waldemar Pawlak announced his resignation as deputy prime minister and minister of economy. He was dismissed from both functions on November 27. On December 6, both these offices were taken over by Janusz Piechociński.

In January 2014, PSL decided to establish cooperation with SKL and Samoobrona, but SKL already in February announced that Jarosław Gowin joined Poland Together, and the PSL talks about a joint election campaign with Samoobrona did not end with an agreement. In March, MP Andrzej Dąbrowski left PSL. The party&#x27;s candidate in the 2015 presidential election was the marshal of the Świętokrzyskie Province, party vice president Adam Jarubas. He placed 6th, obtaining 238,761 votes. Before the second round, PSL was involved in the campaign of the then-incumbent President Bronisław Komorowski.

=== In Opposition (2015–2023) ===
At the 2015 parliamentary election, the PSL dropped to 5.13% of the vote, just barely over the 5% threshold. With 16 seats, it was the smallest of the five factions in the Sejm.

Since then, PSL has lost even more support to PiS during the 2018 Polish local elections when they lost 87 seats and dropped to 12.07% unlike the 23.9% they got at the last local elections. After this, the party became a junior partner in coalition with the Civic Coalition and SLD.

In the 2019 European election, PSL won three seats as a part of the European Coalition.

For the parliamentary elections in the same year, PSL decided to create a centrist and Christian-democratic coalition called the Polish Coalition. The Polish Coalition, apart from PSL, consisted of Kukiz&#x27;15, Union of European Democrats and other liberal, catholic and regionalist organisations. The coalition managed to get 30 Sejm members elected, 20 of whom were members of PSL.

In November 2020, PSL decided to end coalition with Kukiz&#x27;15 due to differences on negotiations on EU budget.

Before the 2023 parliamentary elections Polish Coalition formed a broader alliance with centrist Poland 2050 of Szymon Hołownia.
=== Coalition government (2023–present) ===
After the parliamentary elections in 2023, Third Way block won 14.4% of the popular vote and 65 seats, it joined the government coalition with Civic Coalition and The Left. Władysław Kosiniak-Kamysz was appointed as the deputy prime minister and as a Minister of National Defense, Czesław Siekierski was appointed as Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Dariusz Klimczak was appointed as Minister of Infrastructure and Krzysztof Hetman as Minister of Development and Technology. Because of the electoral success (65 MPs) Third Way block has also participated in 2024 local getting 12.07% of the votes in the elections to voivodship assemblies, in which it received 80 seats.

==Ideology==

The Polish People&#x27;s Party adhered to the principles of agrarian socialism and anti-neoliberalism in the 1990s and early 2000s, and had a post-communist character, highlighting the positive sides of the former communist system and rejecting the Polish transformation to capitalism because of its high social cost and inequality. It was positioned on the left-wing on the political spectrum during that period. As late as 2011, the party was still described as &quot;a left-wing party, representing an agrarian socialist agenda, although it is also known for its social conservatism&quot;. Up to 2008, the party also opposed liberalism, denouncing it as &quot;primitive social Darwinism&quot; and warning against a liberal state where &quot;people are subordinated to the market&quot;. After 2008, the Polish People&#x27;s Party started drifting towards centrism, abandoning its criticism of economic liberalism as well as discarding its agrarian socialist vision for the Polish economy. It embraced an ideology of &quot;neoagrarianism&quot; that postulated a third way economic system based on Catholic social teaching, which rejected the downsides of both capitalism and communism. The party then switched to Christian democracy and supported a regulated free market - the social market economy. PSL has drifted once more in the late 2010s and early 2020s towards the political right, adopting a neoliberal economic program based on deregulation and privatization. The party retained its Christian democratic character on social issues, where it continues to adhere to social conservatism.
===Ideology from 1990s to 2000s===
The party, as it was reformed in 1990, was a direct and formal successor of the socialist United People&#x27;s Party, and it inherited the party&#x27;s members, political foundations as well as funds. The PSL was one of the two major Polish parties between from the 1990s to late 2000s with communist origins along with the Democratic Left Alliance - these two parties, along with Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, formed the post-communist bloc. Thus the party had a left-wing economic program that promoted agrarian socialism and praised the fallen communist regime, appealing to the communist nostalgia of voters. The party made references to the peasant movement of the Second Polish Republic and the WW2-era PSL led by Stanisław Mikołajczyk, but these remained at a figurative level and did not affect the party&#x27;s socialist alignment. This led to a split in the party - after the anti-communist Roman Bartoszcze was ousted as the party leader and PSL made its communist legacy more explicit, disaffected agrarians who returned to Poland from exile left the party and formed Peasants&#x27; Agreement. 

In that period, the PSL condemned globalization and capitalist reforms as the driving factors behind the loss of national sovereignty and the growing inequality in the countryside. The party spoke against privatization and instead envisioned a decentralized socialist structure based on state-owned, communal as well as &quot;social&quot; (cooperative) ownership of the Polish economy. The party listed rural poverty, unemployment, lack of affordable housing and limited healthcare access as consequences of the economic liberalization pursued in the 1990s. The party also argued that the &#x27;national interests&#x27; necessitates state ownership of most industries, especially that of the banks; the party also proposed a catalogue of protectionist measures that would stop the decline of the Polish agriculture and food industry.

The PSL pointed to liberalism and authoritarian tendencies as its main ideological opponents. The party program from that time argued that &quot;in the name of blind liberalism - the doctrine of the elimination of the state from any influence on the shaping of economic structures, it passively watches as more and more segments of our market are taken over by foreign entities and as domestic companies are eliminated from it, for which, in addition, worse economic conditions are created for economic activity&quot;. Liberalism was described an ideology in which the state passively observes the struggle on the market between foreign, powerful concerns and Polish enterprises, which, being weaker and deprived of state support, fail. The party argued that the consequence of this was a high rate of unemployment, giving rise to social problems. The party also noted the existence of social disparities and the lack of prospects for the young generation, which is forced to emigrate in search of work, which caused a weakening of Poland&#x27;s international role, subject to the uncontrolled game played by global corporations.
===Drift to the right===
The origin of the party&#x27;s pivot was in the late 2000s, as the party&#x27;s anti-liberal slogan was overshadowed by the one of right-wing populist Law and Justice, while agrarian socialism became the staple of the far-left Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, which would form an anti-liberal government together with Law and Justice and League of Polish Families in 2005. PSL started cooperating with the Civic Platform at this time - a party based on liberal and conservative ideas; this forced PSL to tone down its rhetoric as to avoid attacking the anticipated future coalition partner. Political analysis of the party&#x27;s rhetoric in 2006 found that the party would increasingly embrace liberalism in place of its hitherto economically left-wing program, which placed the party closer to the Civic Platform and other centre-right parties. This was in stark contrast to a fellow agrarian party Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland, which espoused conservatively socialist views.

From the late 2000s onwards, the party pivoted away from its once agrarian socialist program in favor of &quot;neoagrarianism&quot;, which it defined as the &quot;principle of class solidarity and peasant separatism postulating the necessity of an evolutionary path of social reconstruction on the principles of economic democracy, with particular attention to the interests of agriculture and under the political leadership of the peasant layer.&quot; Neoagrarianism of the party also included the concept of a &quot;third way&quot; of social development aiming at the creation of a state system between capitalism and communism. This new form of economic system was to be based on the Catholic social teaching and eliminte both &quot;the shortcomings of capitalism and the dangers posed by communism&quot;. The neoagrarian economy was also to be based on the principle of Catholic subsidiarity, &quot; the primacy of labour over capital&quot;, as well as rejection of monetarism and neoliberalism. The party then gradually abandoned its criticism of liberalism, eventually embracing as a result.
===Modern program===
The party&#x27;s platform is strongly based on agrarianism. On social and ethical issues, PSL is attached to more social conservative values, as it opposes abortion (although it is against its criminalization, defending the current abortion law in Poland), legalisation of same-sex marriage, euthanasia, death penalty, and soft drug decriminalisation. The party is in favour of maintaining religion lessons in public education. In 2019, the party adopted (as part of an agreement with Kukiz&#x27;15) in the party&#x27;s platform direct democracy&#x27;s postulates, including introducing single-member districts, electronic voting and obligatory referendums.

Despite its formerly socialist alignment, the party embraced economic liberalism ever since it entered a coalition with the Civic Platform. The PSL supported economic policies such as increasing the retirement age, privatization of state-owned enterprises, as well as implementing deregulation in order to secure funds from the European Union. Nowadays, the party is considered economically liberal and oriented towards the free market, aligning with the parties such as Civic Platform, Poland 2050 and Modern. As part of the Third Way, PSL adopted a neoliberal-conservative program, promoting low taxes, market solutions to the housing crisis and climate change, as well as increased role of the private sector in Polish economy and publis services.

Moreover, during the leadership of Kosiniak-Kamysz, who took over after 2015 elections, PSL has visibly started leaning towards economic liberalism in order to gain voters in bigger cities. Kosiniak-Kamysz himself has described party&#x27;s ideology as &quot;moderately centrist&quot; and Christian democratic. After most of the party&#x27;s MPs voted against a law softening abortion law in Poland in 2024, PSL began to visibly present itself as the conservative wing of a ruling coalition under the premiership of Donald Tusk, which caused criticism from left-wing politicians and activists, such as Marta Lempart. Polish political scientist Rafał Chwedoruk noted that by 2024, the party has become the most right-wing in its party history, even more than it was when it entered a government with right-wing nationalists in the 1920s. Similarly, Zuzanna Dąbrowska argues that the PSL has become increasingly supportive of cooperation with other right-wing parties.

Under the leadership of Kosiniak-Kamysz, the Polish People&#x27;s Party abandoned its historical tradition of agrarianism; Kosiniak-Kamysz stressed that the Polish People&#x27;s Party should be &#x27;universal&#x27; rather than agrarian, and oversaw shifts in the party&#x27;s program towards economic liberalism and positions that are attractive to urban voters. The party&#x27;s historically left-wing stances were appropriated by a minor party AGROunia instead. After the creation of the Third Way together with Poland 2050, political scientists noted that the Polish People&#x27;s Party no longer refers to agrarianism in its program, its economic postulates are pro-business and oriented towards small and middle-sized companies, and the party has abandoned the agrarian tradition in favor of a non-ideological, big tent appeal. 
==Election results==

===Support===
The Party&#x27;s traditional support base consisted of farmers, peasants and rural voters. Voters are generally more social conservative than voters of Civic Platform. Its main competitor in rural areas is the national conservative Law and Justice (&quot;PiS&quot;).

In the 2010s, the party started to lose support between rural voters (especially in southeast of Poland, e.g. Subcarpathian Voivodeship). In 2019 election PSL gained surprisingly significant support in cities and won mandates (e. g. in Warsaw and Wrocław).

<text>Labour Union (, &quot;UP&quot;) is a minor social-democratic political party in Poland. It was a member of the Party of European Socialists (PES) until April 2022.

== History ==

Labour Union was formed in June 1992. The party contested the 1993 parliamentary elections, obtaining 7.28% of the popular vote and had 41 representatives elected to the lower house (Sejm). In the following parliamentary elections of 1997, UP received only 4.74% of votes, thereby falling short of the required 5% threshold for election to the Sejm. At the 2001 parliamentary elections, UP entered into an electoral alliance with the major Polish social-democratic party Democratic Left Alliance (SLD), and managed to get 16 of its members elected to parliament. Some of those members subsequently left UP to join the newly created Social Democracy of Poland (SDPL), a splinter group from the SLD. In May 2004, UP signed an alliance with SDPL, in which both parties agreed to jointly contest the following parliamentary elections under the SDPL banner, and to support the candidacy of Marek Borowski in the 2005 presidential election. At the 2005 parliamentary elections, SDPL gained only 3.9% of the vote, which was insufficient for the alliance to achieve parliamentary representation.

In 2006, UP joined SLD, SDPL and the liberal Democratic Party – demokraci.pl to form a centre-left electoral alliance named Left and Democrats (LiD) for the upcoming local elections. This electoral alliance was maintained for the 2007 parliamentary elections, and LiD came in third place with 13.2% of the vote, which saw 53 of its candidates elected to the Sejm. Unfortunately for UP, the party was the only one of the four component parties of the LiD alliance not to have any of its candidates elected.

In the 2011 parliamentary elections, its candidates joined the electoral lists of SLD. Again, none of them were elected.

They managed, however, to win one seat on the European Parliament elections in 2004; the party held it in the elections in 2009 and 2014.

In July 2015, the party joined the Zjednoczona Lewica (United Left) electoral alliance for the 2015 parliamentary elections. The alliance received 7.6% vote of the vote in the elections, below the 8% electoral threshold leaving it with no parliamentary representation. The alliance was dissolved in February 2016.

In the 2019 parliamentary election, Labour Union candidates ran on the Civic Coalition’s electoral lists; again, none of their candidates managed to get elected.

<doc id="39282" wikidata="Q18869" url="?curid=39282" title="Caucasus">
<text>The Caucasus () or Caucasia (), is a region spanning Eastern Europe and Western Asia. It is situated between the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea, mainly comprising Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and parts of Southern Russia. The Caucasus Mountains, including the Greater Caucasus range, have conventionally been considered as a natural barrier between Europe and Asia, bisecting the Eurasian landmass.

Mount Elbrus, Europe&#x27;s highest mountain, is situated in the Western Caucasus area of Russia. On the southern side, the Lesser Caucasus includes the Javakheti Plateau and the Armenian highlands, part of which is in Turkey.

The Caucasus is divided into the North Caucasus and South Caucasus, although the Western Caucasus also exists as a distinct geographic space within the North Caucasus. The Greater Caucasus mountain range in the north is mostly shared by Russia and Georgia as well as the northernmost parts of Azerbaijan. The Lesser Caucasus mountain range in the south is occupied by several independent states, mostly by Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia, but also extends to parts of northeastern Turkey, and northern Iran.

The region is known for its linguistic diversity: aside from Indo-European and Turkic languages, the Kartvelian, Northwest Caucasian, and Northeast Caucasian language families are indigenous to the area.

==Origin of the name==
Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;Natural History&quot; (77–79 AD) derives the name of the Caucasus from a Scythian name, &quot;Croucasis&quot;, which supposedly means &#x27;shimmering with snow&#x27;. German linguist Paul Kretschmer notes that the Latvian word &quot;kruvesis&quot; also means &#x27;frozen mud&#x27;.

Isidore of Seville&#x27;s &quot;Etymologies&quot; () also says the name means shining white like snow:

In the &quot;Tale of Past Years&quot; (1113 AD), it is stated that Old East Slavic Кавкасийскыѣ горы (&quot;Kavkasijskyě gory&quot;) came from Ancient Greek Καύκασος (&quot;Kaúkasos&quot;), which, according to M. A. Yuyukin, is a compound word that can be interpreted as the &#x27;mountain of the seagull(s)&#x27; (καύ-: καύαξ, καύηξ, -ηκος, κήξ, κηϋξ &#x27;a kind of seagull&#x27; + the reconstructed *κάσος &#x27;mountain&#x27; or &#x27;rock&#x27; richly attested both in place and personal names).

In Georgian tradition, the term Caucasus is derived from Caucas ( &quot;Ḳavḳasosi&quot;), the son of the Biblical Togarmah and legendary forefather of the Nakh peoples.

According to German philologists Otto Schrader and Alfons A. Nehring, the Ancient Greek word Καύκασος (&quot;Kaukasos&quot;) is connected to Gothic &quot;hauhs&quot; &#x27;high&#x27; as well as Lithuanian &quot;kaũkas&quot; &#x27;hillock&#x27; and &quot;kaukarà&quot; &#x27;hill, top&#x27;, Russian &quot;куча&quot; &#x27;heap&#x27;. British linguist Adrian Room claims that *&quot;kau-&quot; also means &#x27;mountain&#x27; in Pelasgian, though this is speculative given that Pelasgian is so poorly known.

==Toponyms==
The term &quot;Caucasus&quot; is not only used for the mountains themselves but also includes Ciscaucasia (which is part of the Russian Federation) and Transcaucasia. According to Alexander Mikaberidze, Transcaucasia is a &quot;Russo-centric&quot; term.

The Transcaucasus region and Dagestan were the furthest points of Parthian and later Sasanian expansions, with areas to the north of the Greater Caucasus range practically impregnable. The mythological Mount Qaf, the world&#x27;s highest mountain that ancient Iranian lore shrouded in mystery, was said to be situated in this region. The region is also one of the candidates for the location of Airyanem Vaejah, the apparent homeland of the Iranians of Zoroaster. In Middle Persian sources of the Sasanian era, the Caucasus range was referred to as &quot;Kaf Kof&quot;. The term resurfaced in Iranian tradition later on in a variant form when Ferdowsi, in his &quot;Shahnameh&quot;, referred to the Caucasus mountains as &quot;Kōh-i Kāf&quot;. &quot;Most of the modern names of the Caucasus originate from the Greek &quot;Kaukasos&quot; (Lat., &quot;Caucasus&quot;) and the Middle Persian &quot;Kaf Kof&quot;&quot;.

&quot;The earliest etymon&quot; of the name Caucasus comes from &quot;Kaz-kaz&quot;, the Hittite designation of the &quot;inhabitants of the southern coast of the Black Sea&quot;.

It was also noted that in Nakh Ков гас (&quot;Kov gas&quot;) means &quot;gateway to steppe&quot;.

===Endonyms and exonyms===
The modern endonym for the region is usually similar in many languages, and is generally between Kavkaz and Kaukaz.

==Political geography==

The North Caucasus region is also known as the &quot;Ciscaucasus&quot;, whereas the South Caucasus region is alternatively known as the &quot;Transcaucasus&quot;.

The North Caucasus contains most of the Greater Caucasus mountain range. It consists of Southern Russia, mainly the North Caucasian Federal District&#x27;s autonomous republics and the Krais in Southern Russia, and the northernmost parts of Georgia and Azerbaijan. The North Caucasus lies between the Black Sea to its west, the Caspian Sea to its east, and borders the Southern Federal District to its north. The two Federal Districts are collectively referred to as &quot;Southern Russia&quot;.

The South Caucasus borders the Greater Caucasus range and Southern Russia to its north, the Black Sea and Turkey to its west, the Caspian Sea to its east, and Iran to its south. It contains the Lesser Caucasus mountain range and surrounding lowlands. All of Armenia, Azerbaijan (excluding the northernmost parts), and Georgia (excluding the northernmost parts) are in the South Caucasus.

The watershed along the Greater Caucasus range is considered by some sources to be the dividing line between Europe and Southwest Asia. According to that, the highest peak in the Caucasus, Mount Elbrus (5,642 meters) located in western Ciscaucasus, is considered the highest point in Europe. The Kuma-Manych Depression, the geologic depression that divides the Russian Plain from the North Caucasus foreland is often regarded by classical and non-British sources as the natural and historical boundary between Europe and Asia. Another opinion is that the rivers Kura and Rioni mark this border, or even that of the river Aras.

The Caucasus is a linguistically, culturally and geographically diverse region. The nation states that compose the Caucasus today are the post-Soviet states Georgia (including Adjara and Abkhazia), Azerbaijan (including Nakhchivan), Armenia, and the Russian Federation. The Russian divisions include Dagestan, Chechnya, Ingushetia, , , , Adygea, Krasnodar Krai, and Stavropol Krai, in clockwise order.

Two territories in the region claim independence but are recognized as such by only a handful of entities: Abkhazia, and South Ossetia. Abkhazia and South Ossetia are largely recognized by the world community as part of Georgia.

==Demographics==

The region has many different languages and language families. There are more than 50 ethnic groups living in the region. No fewer than three language families are unique to the area. In addition, Indo-European languages, such as East Slavic, Armenian and Ossetian, and Turkic languages, such as Azerbaijani, Kumyk language and Karachay–Balkar, are spoken in the area. Russian is used as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; most notably in the North Caucasus.

The peoples of the northern and southern Caucasus mostly are Shia Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Eastern Orthodox Christians or Armenian Christians.

==History==

Located on the peripheries of Turkey, Iran, and Russia, the region has been an arena for political, military, religious, and cultural rivalries and expansionism for centuries. Throughout its history, the Caucasus was usually incorporated into the Iranian world. At the beginning of the 19th century, the Russian Empire conquered the territory from Qajar Iran.

===Prehistory===

The territory of the Caucasus region was inhabited by Homo erectus since the Paleolithic Era. In 1991, early Hominini fossils dating back 1.8 million years were found at the Dmanisi archaeological site in Georgia. Scientists now classify the assemblage of fossil skeletons as the subspecies &quot;Homo erectus georgicus&quot;.

The site yields the earliest unequivocal evidence for the presence of early humans outside the African continent; and the Dmanisi skulls are the five oldest hominins ever found outside Africa.

===Antiquity===
Kura–Araxes culture from about 4000 BC until about 2000 BC enveloped a vast area of approximately 1,000 km by 500 km, and mostly encompassed, on modern-day territories, the Southern Caucasus (except western Georgia), northwestern Iran, the northeastern Caucasus, eastern Turkey, and as far as Syria.

Under Ashurbanipal (669–627 BC), the boundaries of the Assyrian Empire reached as far as the Caucasus Mountains. Later ancient kingdoms of the region included Armenia, Albania, Colchis and Iberia, among others. These kingdoms were later incorporated into various Iranian empires, including Media, the Achaemenid Empire, Parthia, and the Sassanid Empire, who would altogether rule the Caucasus for many hundreds of years. In 95–55 BC, under the reign of the Armenian king Tigranes the Great, the Kingdom of Armenia included Kingdom of Armenia, vassals Iberia, Albania, Parthia, Atropatene, Mesopotamia, Cappadocia, Cilicia, Syria, Nabataean kingdom, and Judea. By the time of the first century BC, Zoroastrianism had become the dominant religion of the region; however, the region would go through two other religious transformations. Owing to the strong rivalry between Persia and Rome, and later Byzantium. The Romans first arrived in the region in the 1st century BC with the annexation of the kingdom of Colchis, which was later turned into the province of Lazicum. The next 600 years was marked by a conflict between Rome and Sassanid Empire for the control of the region. In western Georgia the eastern Roman rule lasted until the Middle Ages.
===Middle Ages===

As the Arsacid dynasty of Armenia (an eponymous branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia) was the first nation to adopt Christianity as state religion (in 301 AD), and Caucasian Albania and Georgia had become Christian entities, Christianity began to overtake Zoroastrianism and pagan beliefs. With the Muslim conquest of Persia, large parts of the region came under the rule of the Arabs, and Islam penetrated the region.

In the 10th century, the Alans (proto-Ossetians) founded the Kingdom of Alania, that flourished in the Northern Caucasus, roughly in the location of latter-day Circassia and modern North Ossetia–Alania, until its destruction by the Mongol invasion in 1238–39.

During the Middle Ages, Bagratid Armenia, Kingdom of Tashir-Dzoraget, Kingdom of Syunik and Principality of Khachen organized local Armenian population facing multiple threats after the fall of antique Kingdom of Armenia. Caucasian Albania maintained close ties with Armenia and the Church of Caucasian Albania shared the same Christian dogmas with the Armenian Apostolic Church and had a tradition of their Catholicos being ordained through the Patriarch of Armenia.

In the 12th century, the Georgian king David the Builder drove the Muslims out of the Caucasus and made the Kingdom of Georgia a strong regional power. In 1194–1204 Georgian Queen Tamar&#x27;s armies crushed new Seljuk Turkish invasions from the southeast and south and launched several successful campaigns into Seljuk Turkish-controlled Southern Armenia. The Georgian Kingdom continued military campaigns in the Caucasus region. As a result of her military campaigns and the temporary fall of the Byzantine Empire in 1204, Georgia became the strongest Christian state in the whole Near East area, encompassing most of the Caucasus stretching from Northern Iran and Northeastern Turkey to the North Caucasus.

The Caucasus region was conquered by the Ottomans, Turco-Mongols, local kingdoms and khanates, as well as, once again, Iran.

===Modern period===

Up to and including the early 19th century, most of the Southern Caucasus and southern Dagestan all formed part of the Persian Empire. In 1813 and 1828 by the Treaty of Gulistan and the Treaty of Turkmenchay respectively, the Persians were forced to irrevocably cede the Southern Caucasus and Dagestan to Imperial Russia. In the ensuing years after these gains, the Russians took the remaining part of the Southern Caucasus, comprising western Georgia, through several wars from the Ottoman Empire.

In the second half of the 19th century, the Russian Empire also conquered the North Caucasus. In the aftermath of the Caucasian Wars, the Russian military perpetrated an ethnic cleansing of Circassians, expelling this indigenous population from its homeland. Between the 1850s and World War I, about a million North Caucasian Muslims arrived in the Ottoman Empire as refugees.

Having killed and deported most of the Armenians of Western Armenia during the Armenian genocide, the Turks intended to eliminate the Armenian population of Eastern Armenia. During the 1920 Turkish–Armenian War, 60,000 to 98,000 Armenian civilians were estimated to have been killed by the Turkish army.

In the 1940s, around 480,000 Chechens and Ingush, 120,000 Karachay–Balkars and Meskhetian Turks, thousands of Kalmyks, and 200,000 Kurds in Nakchivan and Caucasus Germans were deported en masse to Central Asia and Siberia by the Soviet security apparatus. About a quarter of them died.
The Southern Caucasus region was unified as a single political entity twice – during the Russian Civil War (Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic) from 9 April 1918 to 26 May 1918, and under the Soviet rule (Transcaucasian SFSR) from 12 March 1922 to 5 December 1936. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia became independent nations.
The region has been subject to various territorial disputes since the collapse of the Soviet Union, leading to the First Nagorno-Karabakh War (1988–1994), the East Prigorodny Conflict (1989–1991), the War in Abkhazia (1992–93), the First Chechen War (1994–1996), the Second Chechen War (1999–2009), Russo-Georgian War (2008), and the Second Nagorno-Karabakh War (2020).

==Mythology==
In Greek mythology, the Caucasus was one of the pillars supporting the world. After presenting man with the gift of fire, Prometheus (or Amirani in the Georgian version) was chained there by Zeus, to have his liver eaten daily by an eagle as punishment for defying Zeus&#x27;s wish to keep the &quot;secret of fire&quot; from humans.

In Persian mythology, the Caucasus might be associated with the mythic Mount Qaf which is believed to surround the known world. It is the battlefield of Saoshyant and the nest of the Simurgh.

The Roman poet Ovid placed the Caucasus in Scythia and depicted it as a cold and stony mountain which was the abode of personified hunger. The Greek hero Jason sailed to the west coast of the Caucasus in pursuit of the Golden Fleece, and there met Medea, a daughter of King Aeëtes of Colchis.

===Later folklore===
The Caucasus has a rich folklore tradition. This tradition has been preserved orally—necessitated by the fact that for most of the languages involved, there was no alphabet until the early twentieth century—and only began to be written down in the late nineteenth century. One important tradition is that of the Nart sagas, which tell stories of a race of ancient heroes called the Narts. These sagas include such figures as Satanaya, the mother of the Narts, Sosruquo a shape changer and trickster, Tlepsh a blacksmith god, and Batradz, a mighty hero. The folklore of the Caucasus shows ancient Iranian Zoroastrian influence, involve battles with ancient Goths, Huns and Khazars, and contain many connections with ancient Indian, Norse Scandinavian, and Greek cultures.

===Links between Greek mythology and subsequent folklore===
Caucasian folklore contains many links with the myths of the ancient Greeks. There are resemblances between the mother goddess Satanaya and the Greek goddess of love Aphrodite. The story of how the trickster Nart Sosruquo, became invulnerable parallels that of the Greek hero Achilles. The ancient Greek Amazons may be connected to a Caucasian &quot;warrior Forest-Mother, Amaz-an&quot;.

Caucasian legends include stories involving giants similar to Homer&#x27;s Polyphemus story. In these stories, the giant is almost always a shepherd, and he is variously a one-eyed rock-throwing cannibal, who lives in a cave (the exit of which is often blocked by a stone), kills the hero&#x27;s companions, is blinded by a hot stake, and whose flock of animals is stolen by the hero and his men, all motifs which (along with still others) are also found in the Polyphemus story. In one example from Georgia, two brothers, who are being held prisoner by a giant one-eyed shepherd called &quot;One-eye&quot;, take a spit, heat it up, stab it into the giant&#x27;s eye, and escape.

There are also links with the ancient Greek myth of Prometheus. Many legends, widespread in the Caucasus, contain motifs shared with the Prometheus story. These motifs include a giant hero, his conflict with God or gods, the stealing of fire and giving it to men, being chained, and being tormented by a bird who pecks at his liver (or heart). The Adyge/Circassian Nart Nasran, the Georgian Amirani, the Chechen Pkharmat, and the Abkhazian Abrskil, are examples of such Prometheus-like figures.

==Ecology==
The Caucasus is an area of great ecological importance. The region is included in the list of 34 world biodiversity hotspots. It harbors some 6400 species of higher plants, 1600 of which are endemic to the region. Its wildlife includes Persian leopards, brown bears, wolves, bison, marals, golden eagles and hooded crows. Among invertebrates, some 1000 spider species are recorded in the Caucasus. Most of arthropod biodiversity is concentrated on Great and Lesser Caucasus ranges.

The region has a high level of endemism and several relict animals and plants, the fact reflecting the presence of refugial forests, which survived the Ice Age in the Caucasus Mountains. The Caucasus forest refugium is the largest throughout the Western Asian (near Eastern) region. The area has multiple representatives of disjunct relict groups of plants with the closest relatives in Eastern Asia, southern Europe, and even North America. Over 70 species of forest snails of the region are endemic. Some relict species of vertebrates are Caucasian parsley frog, Caucasian salamander, Robert&#x27;s snow vole, and Caucasian grouse, and there are almost entirely endemic groups of animals such as lizards of genus &quot;Darevskia&quot;. In general, the species composition of this refugium is quite distinct and differs from that of the other Western Eurasian refugia.

The natural landscape is one of mixed forest, with substantial areas of rocky ground above the treeline. The Caucasus Mountains are also noted for a dog breed, the Caucasian Shepherd Dog (Rus. Kavkazskaya Ovcharka, Geo. Nagazi). Vincent Evans noted that minke whales have been recorded from the Black Sea.

==Energy and mineral resources==
The Caucasus has many economically important minerals and energy resources, such as gold, silver, copper, iron ore, manganese, tungsten, zinc, oil, natural gas, and coal (both anthracite coal and brown).

==Sport==

Krasnaya Polyana is a popular center of mountain skiing and a snowboard venue.&lt;br&gt; The 2015 European Games is the first in the history of the European Games to be held in Azerbaijan.
