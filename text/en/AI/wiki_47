<doc id="40968" wikidata="Q1249999" url="?curid=40968" title="Corner reflector">
<text>A corner reflector is a retroreflector consisting of three mutually perpendicular, intersecting flat reflective surfaces. It reflects waves incident from any direction directly towards the source, but translated. The three intersecting surfaces often are triangles (forming a tetrahedron) or may have square shapes. Radar corner reflectors made of metal are used to reflect radio waves from radar sets. Optical corner reflectors, called corner cubes or cube corners, made of three-sided glass prisms, are used in surveying and laser ranging.

==Principle==
The incoming ray is reflected three times, once by each surface, which results in a reversal of direction. To see this, the three corresponding normal vectors of the corner&#x27;s perpendicular sides can be considered to form a basis (a rectangular coordinate system) (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) in which to represent the direction of an arbitrary incoming ray, . When the ray reflects from the first side, say &quot;x&quot;, the ray&#x27;s &quot;x&quot; component, &quot;a&quot;, is reversed to −&quot;a&quot; while the &quot;y&quot; and &quot;z&quot; components are unchanged, resulting in a direction of . Similarly, when reflected from side &quot;y&quot; and finally from side &quot;z&quot;, the &quot;b&quot; and &quot;c&quot; components are reversed. Therefore, the ray direction goes from to to to , and it leaves the corner reflector with all three components of direction exactly reversed. The distance travelled, relative to a plane normal to the direction of the rays, is also equal for any ray entering the reflector, regardless of the location where it first reflects.

==In radar==
Radar corner reflectors are designed to reflect the microwave radio waves emitted by radar sets back toward the radar antenna. This causes them to show a strong &quot;return&quot; on radar screens. A simple corner reflector consists of three conducting sheet metal or screen surfaces at 90° angles to each other, attached to one another at the edges, forming a &quot;corner&quot;. These reflect radio waves coming from in front of them back parallel to the incoming beam. To create a corner reflector that will reflect radar waves coming from any direction, 8 corner reflectors are placed back-to-back in an octahedron (diamond) shape. The reflecting surfaces must be larger than several wavelengths of the radio waves to function.

In maritime navigation they are placed on bridge abutments, buoys, ships and, especially, lifeboats, to ensure that these show up strongly on ship radar screens. Corner reflectors are placed on the vessel&#x27;s masts at a height of at least above sea level (giving them an approximate minimum horizon distance of ). Marine radar uses X-band microwaves with wavelengths of , so small reflectors less than across are used. In aircraft navigation, corner reflectors are installed on rural runways, to make them show up on aircraft radar.

An object that has multiple reflections from smooth surfaces produces a radar return of greater magnitude than might be expected from the physical size of the object. This effect was put to use on the ADM-20 Quail, a small decoy missile which had the same radar cross section as a B-52.

The corner reflector is not the only efficient radar reflector design; other retroreflector designs have also seen use. Luneburg lens, for example, are used on the ADM-141 TALD.

==In optics==

In optics, corner reflectors typically consist of three mirrors or reflective prism faces which return an incident light beam in the opposite direction. In surveying, retroreflector prisms are commonly used as targets for long-range electronic distance measurement using a total station.

Five arrays of optical corner reflectors have been placed on the Moon for use by Lunar Laser Ranging experiments observing a laser&#x27;s time-of-flight to measure the Moon&#x27;s orbit more precisely than was possible before. The three largest were placed by NASA as part of the Apollo program, and the Soviet Union built two smaller ones into the Lunokhod rovers.

Automobile and bicycle tail lights are molded with arrays of small corner reflectors, with different sections oriented for viewing from different angles. Reflective paint for visibility at night usually contains retroreflective spherical beads.
Thin plastic with microscopic corner reflector structures can be used as tape, on signs, or sewn or molded onto clothing.

==Other examples==
Corner reflectors can also occur accidentally. Tower blocks with balconies are often accidental acoustic corner reflectors and return a distinctive echo to an observer making a sharp sound noise, such as a hand clap, nearby.

<text>Cosmic noise, also known as galactic radio noise, is a physical phenomenon derived from outside of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It is not actually sound, and it can be detected through a radio receiver, which is an electronic device that receives radio waves and converts the information given by them to an audible form. Its characteristics are comparable to those of thermal noise. Cosmic noise occurs at frequencies above about 15 MHz when highly directional antennas are pointed toward the Sun or other regions of the sky, such as the center of the Milky Way Galaxy. Celestial objects like quasars, which are super dense objects far from Earth, emit electromagnetic waves in their full spectrum, including radio waves. The fall of a meteorite can also be heard through a radio receiver; the falling object burns from friction with the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, ionizing surrounding gases and producing radio waves. Cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) from outer space is also a form of cosmic noise. CMBR is thought to be a relic of the Big Bang, and pervades the space almost homogeneously over the entire celestial sphere. The bandwidth of the CMBR is wide, though the peak is in the microwave range.

== History ==
Karl Jansky, an American physicist and radio engineer, first discovered radio waves from the Milky Way in August, 1931. At Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1932, Jansky built an antenna designed to receive radio waves at a frequency of 20.5 MHz, which is a wavelength of approximately 14.6 meters.

After recording signals with this antenna for several months, Jansky categorized them into three types: nearby thunderstorms, distant thunderstorms, and a faint steady hiss of an unknown origin. He discovered the location of maximum intensity rose and fell once a day, which led him to believe he was detecting radiation from the Sun.

A few months went by following this signal thought to be from the Sun, and Jansky found that the brightest point moved away from the Sun and concluded the cycle repeated every 23 hours and 56 minutes. After this discovery, Jansky concluded the radiation was coming from the Milky Way and was strongest in the direction of the center of the galaxy.

Jansky&#x27;s work helped to distinguish between the radio sky and the optical sky. The optical sky is what is seen by the human eye, whereas the radio sky consists of daytime meteors, solar bursts, quasars, and gravitational waves.

Later in 1963, American physicist and radio astronomer Arno Allan Penzias (born April 26, 1933) discovered cosmic microwave background radiation. Penzias&#x27;s discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation helped establish the Big Bang theory of cosmology. Penzias and his partner, Robert Woodrow Wilson worked together on ultra-sensitive cryogenic microwave receivers, originally intended for radio astronomy observations. In 1964, upon creating their most sensitive antenna/receiver system, the Holmdel Horn Antenna, the two discovered a radio noise they could not explain. After further investigation, Penzias contacted Robert Dicke, who suggested it could be the background radiation predicted by cosmological theories, a radio remnant of the Big Bang. Penzias and Wilson won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978.

=== NASA&#x27;s work ===
The Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics, and Diffuse Emission (ARCADE) is a device designed to observe the transition out of the &quot;cosmic dark ages&quot; as the first stars ignite in nuclear fusion and the universe begins to resemble its current form.

ARCADE consists of 7 precision radiometers carried to an altitude of over 35 km (21 miles) by a scientific research balloon. The device measures the tiny heating of the early universe by the first generation of stars and galaxies to form after the Big Bang.

== Sources of cosmic noise ==
Cosmic noise refers to the background radio frequency radiation from galactic sources, which have constant intensity during geomagnetically quiet periods.

=== Sun flares ===
Cosmic noise can be traced from solar flares, which are sudden explosive releases of stored magnetic energy in the atmosphere of the Sun, causing sudden brightening of the photosphere. Solar flares can last from a few minutes to several hours.

During solar flare events, particles and electromagnetic emissions can affect Earth&#x27;s atmosphere by fluctuating the level of ionization in the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere. Increased ionization results in absorption of the cosmic radio noise as it passes through the ionosphere.

=== Solar wind ===
Solar wind is a flux of particles, protons and electrons together with nuclei of heavier elements in smaller numbers, that are accelerated by the high temperatures of the solar corona to velocities large enough to allow them to escape from the Sun&#x27;s gravitational field.

Solar wind causes sudden bursts of cosmic noise absorption in the Earth&#x27;s ionosphere. These bursts can only be detected only if the magnitude of the geomagnetic field perturbation caused by the solar wind shock is large enough.

<doc id="40970" wikidata="Q1136474" url="?curid=40970" title="Costas loop">
<text>A Costas loop is a phase-locked loop (PLL) based circuit which is used for carrier frequency recovery from suppressed-carrier modulation signals (e.g. double-sideband suppressed carrier signals) and phase modulation signals (e.g. BPSK, QPSK). It was invented by John P. Costas at General Electric in the 1950s. Its invention was described as having had &quot;a profound effect on modern digital communications&quot;.
The primary application of Costas loops is in wireless receivers. Its advantage over other PLL-based detectors is that at small deviations the Costas loop error voltage is formula_1 as compared to formula_2. This translates to double the sensitivity and also makes the Costas loop uniquely suited for tracking Doppler-shifted carriers, especially in OFDM and GPS receivers.

== Classical implementation ==

In the classical implementation of a Costas loop, a local voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) provides quadrature outputs, one to each of two phase detectors, &quot;e.g.&quot;, product detectors. The same phase of the input signal is also applied to both phase detectors, and the output of each phase detector is passed through a low-pass filter. The outputs of these low-pass filters are inputs to another phase detector, the output of which passes through a noise-reduction filter before being used to control the voltage-controlled oscillator. The overall loop response is controlled by the two individual low-pass filters that precede the third phase detector, while the third low-pass filter serves a trivial role in terms of gain and phase margin.

The above figure of a Costas loop is drawn under the &quot;locked&quot; state, where the VCO frequency and the incoming carrier frequency have become the same due to the Costas loop process. The figure does not represent the &quot;unlocked&quot; state.

== Mathematical models ==

=== In the time domain ===

In the simplest case formula_3. Therefore, formula_3 does not affect the input of the noise-reduction filter.
The carrier and voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) signals are periodic oscillations formula_5 with high-frequencies formula_6.
The block formula_7 is an analog multiplier.

A linear filter can be described mathematically by a system of linear differential equations:
:formula_8
where formula_9 is a constant matrix, formula_10 is a state vector of the filter, formula_11 and formula_12 are constant vectors.

The model of a VCO is usually assumed to be linear:
:formula_13
where formula_14 is the free-running frequency of the VCO and formula_15 is the VCO gain factor. Similarly, it is possible to consider various nonlinear models of VCO.

Suppose that the frequency of the master generator is constant
formula_16
Equation of VCO and equation of filter yield
:formula_17

The system is non-autonomous and rather tricky for investigation.

=== In the phase-frequency domain ===
In the simplest case, when
: formula_18

The standard engineering assumption is that the filter removes the upper sideband frequency from the input but leaves the lower sideband without change. Thus it is assumed that the VCO input is formula_19 This makes a Costas loop equivalent to a phase-locked loop with phase detector characteristic formula_20 corresponding to the particular waveforms formula_21 and formula_22 of the input and VCO signals. It can be proved that filter outputs in the time and phase-frequency domains are almost equal.

Thus it is possible to study the simpler autonomous system of differential equations
:formula_23.

The Krylov–Bogoliubov averaging method allows one to prove that solutions of non-autonomous and autonomous equations are close under some assumptions.
Thus, the Costas loop block diagram in the time domain can be asymptotically changed to the block diagram on the level of phase-frequency relations.

The transition to the analysis of an autonomous dynamical model of the Costas loop (in place of the non-autonomous one) allows one to overcome the difficulties related to modeling the Costas loop in the time domain, where one has to simultaneously observe a very fast time scale of the input signals and slow time scale of signal&#x27;s phase. This idea makes it possible to calculate core performance characteristics - hold-in, pull-in, and lock-in ranges.

==Frequency acquisition==


The classical Costas loop will work towards making the phase difference between the carrier and the VCO become a small, ideally zero, value. The small phase difference implies that frequency lock has been achieved.

== QPSK Costas loop ==
The classical Costas loop can be adapted to QPSK modulation for higher data rates.

The input QPSK signal is as follows
:formula_24

Inputs of low-pass filters LPF1 and LPF2 are
:formula_25

After synchronization,
the outputs of LPF1 formula_26 and LPF2 formula_27 are used to get demodulated data (formula_28 and formula_29). To adjust the frequency of the VCO to the reference frequency, signals formula_26 and formula_27 are limited and cross-multiplied:
:formula_32

Then the signal formula_33 is filtered by the loop filter and forms the tuning signal for the VCO formula_34, similar to BPSK Costas loop. Thus, QPSK Costas can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations:
:formula_35

Here formula_36 are parameters of LPF1 and LPF2 and formula_37 are parameters of the loop filter.

<doc id="40972" wikidata="Q944517" url="?curid=40972" title="Coupling">
<text>A coupling is a device used to connect two shafts together at their ends for the purpose of transmitting power. The primary purpose of couplings is to join two pieces of rotating equipment while permitting some degree of misalignment or end movement or both. In a more general context, a coupling can also be a mechanical device that serves to connect the ends of adjacent parts or objects. Couplings do not normally allow disconnection of shafts during operation, however there are torque-limiting couplings which can slip or disconnect when some torque limit is exceeded. Selection, installation and maintenance of couplings can lead to reduced maintenance time and maintenance cost.

==Uses==
Shaft couplings are used in machinery for several purposes. A primary function is to transfer power from one end to another end (ex: motor transfer power to pump through coupling).

Other common uses:

* To alter the vibration characteristics of rotating units
* To connect the driving and the driven part
* To introduce protection
* To reduce the transmission of shock loads from one shaft to another
* To slip when overload occurs

==Types==
=== Beam ===

A &quot;beam&quot; coupling, also known as &quot;helical&quot; coupling, is a flexible coupling for transmitting torque between two shafts while allowing for angular misalignment, parallel offset and even axial motion, of one shaft relative to the other. This design utilizes a single piece of material and becomes flexible by removal of material along a spiral path resulting in a curved flexible beam of helical shape. Since it is made from a single piece of material, the beam style coupling does not exhibit the backlash found in some multi-piece couplings. Another advantage of being an all machined coupling is the possibility to incorporate features into the final product while still keeping the single piece&#x27;s integrity.

Changes to the lead of the helical beam provide changes to misalignment capabilities as well as other performance characteristics such as torque capacity and torsional stiffness. It is even possible to have multiple starts within the same helix.

The material used to manufacture the beam coupling also affects its performance and suitability for specific applications such as food, medical and aerospace. Materials are typically aluminum alloy and stainless steel, but they can also be made in acetal, maraging steel and titanium. The most common applications are attaching rotary encoders to shafts and motion control for robotics.

Beam couplings can be known by various names depending upon industry. These names include flexible coupling, flexible beam coupling, flexible shaft coupling, flexure, helical coupling, and shaft coupling.

The primary benefit to using a flexible beam coupling to join two rotating shafts is to reducing vibration and reaction loads which in turn will reduce overall wear and tear on machinery and prolong equipment life.

=== Bush pin flange ===
Bush pin flange coupling is used for slightly imperfect alignment of the two shafts.

This is modified form of the protected type flange coupling. This type of coupling has pins and it works with coupling bolts. The rubber or leather bushes are used over the pins. The coupling has two halves dissimilar in construction. The pins are rigidly fastened by nuts to one of the flange and kept loose on the other flange. This coupling is used to connect shafts which have a small parallel misalignment, angular misalignment or axial misalignment. In this coupling the rubber bushing absorbs shocks and vibration during its operations. This type of coupling is mostly used to couple electric motors and machines.

=== Constant velocity ===
There are various types of constant-velocity (CV) couplings: Rzeppa joint, Double cardan joint, and Thompson coupling.

=== Clamp or split-muff ===
In this coupling, the muff or sleeve is made into two halves parts of the cast iron and they are joined by means of mild steel studs or bolts. The advantages of this coupling is that assembling or disassembling of the coupling is possible without changing the position of the shaft. This coupling is used for heavy power transmission at moderate speed.

=== Diaphragm ===
Diaphragm couplings transmit torque from the outside diameter of a flexible plate to the inside diameter, across the spool or spacer piece, and then from inside to outside diameter. The deforming of a plate or series of plates from I.D. to O.D accomplishes the misalignment.

=== Disc ===

Disc couplings transmit torque from a driving to a driven bolt tangentially on a common bolt circle. Torque is transmitted between the bolts through a series of thin, stainless steel discs assembled in a pack. Misalignment is accomplished by deforming of the material between the bolts.

=== Elastic ===

An elastic coupling transmits torque or other load by means of an elastic component. One example is the coupling used to join a windsurfing rig (sail, mast, and components) to the sailboard. In windsurfing terminology it is usually called a &quot;universal joint&quot;, but modern designs are usually based on a strong flexible material, and better technically described as an elastic coupling. They can be tendon or hourglass-shaped, and are constructed of a strong and durable elastic material. In this application, the coupling does not transmit torque, but instead transmits sail-power to the board, creating thrust (some portion of sail-power is also transmitted through the rider&#x27;s body).
=== Flexible ===
Flexible couplings are usually used to transmit torque from one shaft to another when the two shafts are slightly misaligned. They can accommodate varying degrees of misalignment up to 1.5° and some parallel misalignment. They can also be used for vibration damping or noise reduction. In rotating shaft applications a flexible coupling can protect the driving and driven shaft components (such as bearings) from the harmful effects of conditions such as misaligned shafts, vibration, shock loads, and thermal expansion of the shafts or other components.

At first, flexible couplings separate into two essential groups, metallic and elastomeric.
Metallic types utilize freely fitted parts that roll or slide against one another or, on the other hand, non-moving parts that bend to take up misalignment.
Elastomeric types, then again, gain flexibility from resilient, non-moving, elastic or plastic elements transmitting torque between metallic hubs.

===Fluid===
===Gear===

A &quot;gear coupling&quot; is a mechanical device for transmitting torque between two shafts that are not collinear. It consists of a flexible joint fixed to each shaft. The two joints are connected by a third shaft, called the spindle.

Each joint consists of a 1:1 gear ratio internal–external gear pair. The tooth flanks and outer diameter of the external gear are crowned to allow for angular displacement between the two gears. Mechanically, the gears are equivalent to rotating splines with modified profiles. They are called gears because of the relatively large size of the teeth.

Gear couplings and universal joints are used in similar applications. Gear couplings have higher torque densities than universal joints designed to fit a given space while universal joints induce lower vibrations. The limit on torque density in universal joints is due to the limited cross sections of the cross and yoke. The gear teeth in a gear coupling have high backlash to allow for angular misalignment. The excess backlash can contribute to vibration.

Gear couplings are generally limited to angular misalignments, i.e., the angle of the spindle relative to the axes of the connected shafts, of 4°–5°. Universal joints are capable of higher misalignments.

Single joint gear couplings are also used to connect two nominally coaxial shafts. In this application the device is called a gear-type flexible, or flexible coupling. The single joint allows for minor misalignments such as installation errors and changes in shaft alignment due to operating conditions. These types of gear couplings are generally limited to angular misalignments of °–°.

=== Geislinger ===
=== Giubo ===
===Grid===
A &quot;grid coupling&quot; is composed of two shaft hubs, a metallic grid spring, and a split cover kit. Torque is transmitted between the two coupling shaft hubs through the metallic grid spring element.

Like metallic gear and disc couplings, grid couplings have a high torque density. A benefit of grid couplings, over either gear or disc couplings, is the ability their grid coupling spring elements have to absorb and spread peak load impact energy over time. This reduces the magnitude of peak loads and offers some vibration dampening capability. A negative of the grid coupling design is that it generally is very limited in its ability to accommodate the misalignment.

=== Highly flexible ===

Highly flexible couplings are installed when resonance or torsional vibration might be an issue, since they are designed to eliminate torsional vibration problems and to balance out shock impacts.

They are used in installations where the systems require a high level of torsional flexibility and misalignment capacity. This type of coupling provides an effective damping of torsional vibrations, and high displacement capacity, which protects the drive. The design of the highly flexible elastic couplings makes assembly easier. These couplings also compensate shaft displacements (radial, axial and angular) and the torque is transmitted in shear. Depending on the size and stiffness of the coupling, the flexible part may be single- or multi-row.

===Hirth joints===
Hirth joints use tapered teeth on two shaft ends meshed together to transmit torque.

=== Hydrodynamic ===
=== Jaw ===

Jaw coupling is also known as spider or Lovejoy coupling.

===Magnetic===

A magnetic coupling uses magnetic forces to transmit the power from one shaft to another without any contact. This allows for full medium separation. It can provide the ability to hermetically separate two areas whilst continuing to transmit mechanical power from one to the other making these couplings ideal for applications where prevention of cross-contamination is essential.

=== Oldham ===
An &quot;Oldham coupling&quot; has three discs, one coupled to the input, one coupled to the output, and a middle disc that is joined to the first two by tongue and groove. The tongue and groove on one side is perpendicular to the tongue and groove on the other. The middle disc rotates around its center at the same speed as the input and output shafts. Its center traces a circular orbit, twice per rotation, around the midpoint between input and output shafts. Often springs are used to reduce backlash of the mechanism. An advantage to this type of coupling, as compared to two universal joints, is its compact size. The coupler is named for John Oldham who invented it in Ireland, in 1821, to solve a problem in a paddle steamer design.

=== Rag joint ===
Rag joints are commonly used on automotive steering linkages and drive trains. When used on a drive train they are sometimes known as giubos.

=== Rigid ===
Rigid couplings are used when precise shaft alignment is required; any shaft misalignment will affect the coupling&#x27;s performance as well as its life span, because rigid couplings do not have the ability to compensate for misalignment. Due to this, their application is limited, and they&#x27;re typically used in applications involving vertical drivers.

Clamped or compression rigid couplings come in two parts and fit together around the shafts to form a sleeve. They offer more flexibility than sleeved models, and can be used on shafts that are fixed in place. They generally are large enough so that screws can pass all the way through the coupling and into the second half to ensure a secure hold. Flanged rigid couplings are designed for heavy loads or industrial equipment. They consist of short sleeves surrounded by a perpendicular flange. One coupling is placed on each shaft so the two flanges line up face to face. A series of screws or bolts can then be installed in the flanges to hold them together. Because of their size and durability, flanged units can be used to bring shafts into alignment before they are joined.

=== Schmidt ===
=== Sleeve, box, or muff ===
A sleeve coupling consists of a pipe whose bore is finished to the required tolerance based on the shaft size. Based on the usage of the coupling a keyway is made in the bore in order to transmit the torque by means of the key. Two threaded holes are provided in order to lock the coupling in position.

Sleeve couplings are also known as box couplings. In this case shaft ends are coupled together and abutted against each other which are enveloped by &quot;muff&quot; or &quot;sleeve&quot;.

A &quot;gib head sunk keys&quot; hold the two shafts and sleeve together (this is the simplest type of the coupling) It is made from the cast iron and very simple to design and manufacture. It consists of a hollow pipe whose inner diameter is same as diameter of the shafts.
The hollow pipe is fitted over a two or more ends of the shafts with the help of the taper sunk key. A key and sleeve are useful to transmit power from one shaft to another shaft.

=== Tapered shaft lock ===
A tapered lock is a form of keyless shaft locking device that does not require any material to be removed from the shaft. The basic idea is similar to a clamp coupling but the moment of rotation is closer to the center of the shaft. An alternative coupling device to the traditional parallel key, the tapered lock removes the possibility of play due to worn keyways. It is more robust than using a key because maintenance only requires one tool and the self-centering balanced rotation means it lasts longer than a keyed joint would, but the downside is that it costs more.

=== Twin spring ===
A flexible coupling made from two counter-wound springs with a ball bearing in the center, which allows torque transfer from input to output shaft. Requires no lubrication to consistently run as it has no internal components.

=== Universal joint ===
==Maintenance and failure==
Coupling maintenance requires a regularly scheduled inspection of each coupling. It consists of:
* Performing visual inspections
* Checking for signs of wear or fatigue
* Cleaning couplings regularly
* Checking and changing lubricant regularly if the coupling is lubricated. This maintenance is required annually for most couplings and more frequently for couplings in adverse environments or in demanding operating conditions.
* Documenting the maintenance performed on each coupling, along with the date.

Even with proper maintenance, however, couplings can fail. Underlying reasons for failure, other than maintenance, include:
* Improper installation
* Poor coupling selection
* Operation beyond design capabilities.

External signs that indicate potential coupling failure include:
* Abnormal noise, such as screeching, squealing or chattering
* Excessive vibration or wobble
* Failed seals indicated by lubricant leakage or contamination.

==Balance==
Couplings are normally balanced at the factory prior to being shipped, but they occasionally go out of balance in operation. Balancing can be difficult and expensive, and is normally done only when operating tolerances are such that the effort and the expense are justified. The amount of coupling unbalance that can be tolerated by any system is dictated by the characteristics of the specific connected machines and can be determined by detailed analysis or experience.

<doc id="40975" wikidata="Q5186717" url="?curid=40975" title="Critical frequency">
<text>In telecommunications, the term critical frequency has the following meanings:

* In radio propagation by way of the ionosphere, the frequency at or below which a wave component is reflected by, and above which it penetrates through, an ionospheric layer.
* At near vertical incidence, the limiting frequency at or below which incidence, the wave component is reflected by, and above which it penetrates through, an ionospheric layer.

Critical Frequency changes with time of day, atmospheric conditions and angle of fire of the radio waves by antenna.

The existence of the critical frequency is the result of electron limitation, &quot;i.e.,&quot; the inadequacy of the existing number of free electrons to support reflection at higher frequencies.

In signal processing the &quot;critical frequency&quot; it is also another name for the Nyquist frequency.

Critical frequency is the highest magnitude of frequency above which the waves penetrate the ionosphere and below which the waves are reflected back from the ionosphere.
It is denoted by &quot;&quot;f&quot;c&quot;.
Its value is not fixed and it depends upon the electron density of the ionosphere.

== Equations ==

=== Critical frequency as a function of electron density ===
Critical frequency can be computed with the electron density given by:

formula_1

where &quot;N&quot;max is maximum electron density per m3 and &quot;f&quot;c is in Hz.

=== Critical frequency as a function of maximum usable frequency ===
Critical frequency can be computed by:

formula_2

where MUF is maximum usable frequency and formula_3 is the angle of incidence

== Relationship with plasma frequency ==
The dependence of critical frequency with respect with electron density can be related through plasma oscillation concept particularly the &#x27;Cold&#x27; Electrons mechanism.

formula_4

Using the electron charge formula_5, electron mass formula_6 and permittivity of free space formula_7gives,

formula_8

and solving for the frequency,

formula_9

== Relationship with index of refraction ==
The index of refraction has the formula formula_10which shows dependence in wavelength. The result that the force due to the polarization field in an ionized gas of low concentration is canceled by the effect of collisions between ions and electrons is re‐established in a simple manner that clearly displays the physical basis for the effect. Because of this cancellation the Sellmeyer formula, determines the relation between the electron number density, N, and the index of refraction, n, in the ionosphere when collisions are neglected.

formula_11.

Using the default values for electron charge formula_12, permittivity of free space and electron mass formula_13, and changing angular velocity formula_14with respect to frequency formula_15this yields to

formula_16

and solving for the refraction index n,

formula_17

== Critical frequency and the F layer of the ionosphere ==
* All long-distance HF radio communications use HF radio signals that are obliquely incident on the ionosphere. If the HF frequency is above the critical frequency, the radio signals pass through the ionosphere at an angle instead of head-on.
* The critical frequency changes continuously and the F layer of the ionosphere is mostly responsible for the reflection of radio waves back to Earth.
* The other layers(D) interact in other ways - absorption of frequency and during the day, the D Layers forms, and the F layer splits into F1 and F2 layers.
* Because of changing the Ionosphere during day and night, during daytime higher frequency bands under critical Frequency work best, but during nighttime the lower frequency bands work best.
* The D layer is present during the day and it is a good absorber of radio waves, increasing losses, Higher frequencies are absorbed less, so higher frequencies tends to perform better during daytime.

<doc id="40979" wikidata="Q877055" url="?curid=40979" title="Crystal oscillator">
<text>A crystal oscillator is an electronic oscillator circuit that uses a piezoelectric crystal as a frequency-selective element. The oscillator frequency is often used to keep track of time, as in quartz wristwatches, to provide a stable clock signal for digital integrated circuits, and to stabilize frequencies for radio transmitters and receivers. The most common type of piezoelectric resonator used is a quartz crystal, so oscillator circuits incorporating them became known as crystal oscillators. However, other piezoelectric materials including polycrystalline ceramics are used in similar circuits.

A crystal oscillator relies on the slight change in shape of a quartz crystal under an electric field, a property known as inverse piezoelectricity. A voltage applied to the electrodes on the crystal causes it to change shape; when the voltage is removed, the crystal generates a small voltage as it elastically returns to its original shape. The quartz oscillates at a stable resonant frequency (relative to other low-priced oscillators) with frequency accuracy measured in parts per million (ppm). It behaves like an RLC circuit, but with a much higher Q factor (lower energy loss on each cycle of oscillation and higher frequency selectivity) than can be reliably achieved with discrete capacitors (C) and inductors (L), which suffer from parasitic resistance (R). Once a quartz crystal is adjusted to a particular frequency (which is affected by the mass of electrodes attached to the crystal, the orientation of the crystal, temperature and other factors), it maintains that frequency with high stability.

Quartz crystals are manufactured for frequencies from a few tens of kilohertz to hundreds of megahertz. As of 2003, around two billion crystals were manufactured annually. Most are used for consumer devices such as wristwatches, clocks, radios, computers, and cellphones. However, in applications where small size and weight is needed crystals can be replaced by thin-film bulk acoustic resonators, specifically if ultra-high frequency (more than roughly 1.5 GHz) resonance is needed. Quartz crystals are also found inside test and measurement equipment, such as counters, signal generators, and oscilloscopes.

==Terminology==
A crystal oscillator is an electric oscillator type circuit that uses a piezoelectric resonator, a crystal, as its frequency-determining element. &quot;Crystal&quot; is the common term used in electronics for the frequency-determining component, a wafer of quartz crystal or ceramic with electrodes connected to it. A more accurate term for &quot;crystal&quot; is &quot;piezoelectric resonator&quot;. Crystals are also used in other types of electronic circuits, such as crystal filters.
Piezoelectric resonators are sold as separate components for use in crystal oscillator circuits. They are also often incorporated in a single package with the crystal oscillator circuit.

==History==


Piezoelectricity was discovered by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. Paul Langevin first investigated quartz resonators for use in sonar during World War I. The first crystal-controlled oscillator, using a crystal of Rochelle salt, was built in 1917 and patented in 1918 by Alexander M. Nicholson at Bell Telephone Laboratories, although his priority was disputed by Walter Guyton Cady. Cady built the first quartz crystal oscillator in 1921.
Other early innovators in quartz crystal oscillators include G. W. Pierce and Louis Essen.

Quartz crystal oscillators were developed for high-stability frequency references during the 1920s and 1930s. Prior to crystals, radio stations controlled their frequency with tuned circuits, which could easily drift off frequency by 3–4 kHz. Since broadcast stations were assigned frequencies only 10 kHz (Americas) or 9 kHz (elsewhere) apart, interference between adjacent stations due to frequency drift was a common problem. In 1925, Westinghouse installed a crystal oscillator in its flagship station KDKA, and by 1926, quartz crystals were used to control the frequency of many broadcasting stations and were popular with amateur radio operators. In 1928, Warren Marrison of Bell Laboratories developed the first quartz-crystal clock. With accuracies of up to 1 second in 30 years (30 ms/y, or 0.95 ns/s), quartz clocks replaced precision pendulum clocks as the world&#x27;s most accurate timekeepers until atomic clocks were developed in the 1950s. Using the early work at Bell Laboratories, American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) eventually established their Frequency Control Products division, later spun off and known today as Vectron International.

A number of firms started producing quartz crystals for electronic use during this time. Using what are now considered primitive methods, about 100,000 crystal units were produced in the United States during 1939. Through World War II crystals were made from natural quartz crystal, virtually all from Brazil. Shortages of crystals during the war caused by the demand for accurate frequency control of military and naval radios and radars spurred postwar research into culturing synthetic quartz, and by 1950 a hydrothermal process for growing quartz crystals on a commercial scale was developed at Bell Laboratories. By the 1970s virtually all crystals used in electronics were synthetic.

In 1968, Juergen Staudte invented a photolithographic process for manufacturing quartz crystal oscillators while working at North American Aviation (now Rockwell) that allowed them to be made small enough for portable products like watches.

Although crystal oscillators still most commonly use quartz crystals, devices using other materials are becoming more common, such as ceramic resonators.

==Principle==
A crystal is a solid in which the constituent atoms, molecules, or ions are packed in a regularly ordered, repeating pattern extending in all three spatial dimensions.

Almost any object made of an elastic material could be used like a crystal, with appropriate transducers, since all objects have natural resonant frequencies of vibration. For example, steel is very elastic and has a high speed of sound. It was often used in mechanical filters before quartz. The resonant frequency depends on size, shape, elasticity, and the speed of sound in the material. High-frequency crystals are typically cut in the shape of a simple rectangle or circular disk. Low-frequency crystals, such as those used in digital watches, are typically cut in the shape of a tuning fork. For applications not needing very precise timing, a low-cost ceramic resonator is often used in place of a quartz crystal.

When a crystal of quartz is properly cut and mounted, it can be made to distort in an electric field by applying a voltage to an electrode near or on the crystal. This property is known as inverse piezoelectricity. When the field is removed, the quartz generates an electric field as it returns to its previous shape, and this can generate a voltage. The result is that a quartz crystal behaves like an RLC circuit, composed of an inductor, capacitor and resistor, with a precise resonant frequency.

Quartz has the further advantage that its elastic constants and its size change in such a way that the frequency dependence on temperature can be very low. The specific characteristics depend on the mode of vibration and the angle at which the quartz is cut (relative to its crystallographic axes). Therefore, the resonant frequency of the plate, which depends on its size, does not change much. This means that a quartz clock, filter or oscillator remains accurate. For critical applications the quartz oscillator is mounted in a temperature-controlled container, called a crystal oven, and can also be mounted on shock absorbers to prevent perturbation by external mechanical vibrations.

==Modeling==

===Electrical model===
A quartz crystal can be modeled as an electrical network with low-impedance (series) and high-impedance (parallel) resonance points spaced closely together. Mathematically, using the Laplace transform, the impedance of this network can be written as:

: formula_1

or

: formula_2

where formula_3 is the complex frequency (formula_4), formula_5 is the series resonant angular frequency, and formula_6 is the parallel resonant angular frequency.

Adding capacitance across a crystal causes the (parallel) resonant frequency to decrease. Adding inductance across a crystal causes the (parallel) resonant frequency to increase. These effects can be used to adjust the frequency at which a crystal oscillates. Crystal manufacturers normally cut and trim their crystals to have a specified resonant frequency with a known &quot;load&quot; capacitance added to the crystal. For example, a crystal intended for a 6 pF load has its specified parallel resonant frequency when a 6.0 pF capacitor is placed across it. Without the load capacitance, the resonant frequency is higher.

===Resonance modes===
A quartz crystal provides both series and parallel resonance. The series resonance is a few kilohertz lower than the parallel one. Crystals below 30 MHz are generally operated between series and parallel resonance, which means that the crystal appears as an inductive reactance in operation, this inductance forming a parallel resonant circuit with externally connected parallel capacitance. 

Any small additional capacitance in parallel with the crystal pulls the frequency lower. Moreover, the effective inductive reactance of the crystal can be reduced by adding a capacitor in series with the crystal. This latter technique can provide a useful method of trimming the oscillatory frequency within a narrow range; in this case inserting a capacitor in series with the crystal raises the frequency of oscillation. For a crystal to operate at its specified frequency, the electronic circuit has to be exactly that specified by the crystal manufacturer. Note that these points imply a subtlety concerning crystal oscillators in this frequency range: the crystal does not usually oscillate at precisely either of its resonant frequencies.

Crystals above 30 MHz (up to &gt;200 MHz) are generally operated at series resonance where the impedance appears at its minimum and equal to the series resistance. For these crystals the series resistance is specified (&lt;100 Ω) instead of the parallel capacitance. To reach higher frequencies, a crystal can be made to vibrate at one of its overtone modes, which occur near multiples of the fundamental resonant frequency. Only odd numbered overtones are used. Such a crystal is referred to as a 3rd, 5th, or even 7th overtone crystal. To accomplish this, the oscillator circuit usually includes additional LC circuits to select the desired overtone.
===Temperature effects===
A crystal&#x27;s frequency characteristic depends on the shape or &quot;cut&quot; of the crystal. A tuning-fork crystal is usually cut such that its frequency dependence on temperature is quadratic with the maximum around 25 °C. This means that a tuning-fork crystal oscillator resonates close to its target frequency at room temperature, but slows when the temperature either increases or decreases from room temperature. A common parabolic coefficient for a 32 kHz tuning-fork crystal is −0.04 ppm/°C2:

: formula_7

In a real application, this means that a clock built using a regular 32 kHz tuning-fork crystal keeps good time at room temperature, but loses 2 minutes per year at 10 °C above or below room temperature and loses 8 minutes per year at 20 °C above or below room temperature due to the quartz crystal.

==Crystal oscillator circuits==

The crystal oscillator circuit sustains oscillation by taking a voltage signal from the quartz resonator, amplifying it, and feeding it back to the resonator. The rate of expansion and contraction of the quartz is the resonant frequency, and is determined by the cut and size of the crystal. When the energy of the generated output frequencies matches the losses in the circuit, an oscillation can be sustained.

An oscillator crystal has two electrically conductive plates, with a slice or tuning fork of quartz crystal sandwiched between them. During startup, the controlling circuit places the crystal into an unstable equilibrium, and due to the positive feedback in the system, any tiny fraction of noise is amplified, ramping up the oscillation. The crystal resonator can also be seen as a highly frequency-selective filter in this system: it only passes a very narrow subband of frequencies around the resonant one, attenuating everything else. Eventually, only the resonant frequency is active. As the oscillator amplifies the signals coming out of the crystal, the signals in the crystal&#x27;s frequency band becomes stronger, eventually dominating the output of the oscillator. The narrow resonance band of the quartz crystal filters out the unwanted frequencies.

The output frequency of a quartz oscillator can be either that of the fundamental resonance or of a multiple of that resonance, called a harmonic frequency. Harmonics are an exact integer multiple of the fundamental frequency. But, like many other mechanical resonators, crystals exhibit several modes of oscillation, usually at approximately odd integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. These are termed &quot;overtone modes&quot;, and oscillator circuits can be designed to excite them. The overtone modes are at frequencies which are approximate, but not exact odd integer multiples of that of the fundamental mode, and overtone frequencies are therefore not exact harmonics of the fundamental.

High frequency crystals are often designed to operate at third, fifth, or seventh overtones. Manufacturers have difficulty producing crystals thin enough to produce fundamental frequencies over 30 MHz. To produce higher frequencies, manufacturers make overtone crystals tuned to put the 3rd, 5th, or 7th overtone at the desired frequency, because they are thicker and therefore easier to manufacture than a fundamental crystal that would produce the same frequency—although exciting the desired overtone frequency requires a slightly more complicated oscillator circuit.
A fundamental crystal oscillator circuit is simpler and more efficient and has more pullability than a third overtone circuit.
Depending on the manufacturer, the highest available fundamental frequency may be 25 MHz to 66 MHz.

A major reason for the wide use of crystal oscillators is their high Q factor. A typical &quot;Q&quot; value for a quartz oscillator ranges from 104 to 106, compared to perhaps 102 for an LC oscillator. The maximum &quot;Q&quot; for a high stability quartz oscillator can be estimated as &quot;Q&quot; = 1.6 × 107/&quot;f&quot;, where &quot;f&quot; is the resonant frequency in megahertz.

One of the most important traits of quartz crystal oscillators is that they can exhibit very low phase noise.
In many oscillators, any spectral energy at the resonant frequency is amplified by the oscillator, resulting in a collection of tones at different phases.
In a crystal oscillator, the crystal mostly vibrates in one axis, therefore only one phase is dominant.
This property of low phase noise makes them particularly useful in telecommunications where stable signals are needed, and in scientific equipment where very precise time references are needed.

Environmental changes of temperature, humidity, pressure, and vibration can change the resonant frequency of a quartz crystal, but there are several designs that reduce these environmental effects. These include the TCXO, MCXO, and OCXO which are defined below. These designs, particularly the OCXO, often produce devices with excellent short-term stability. The limitations in short-term stability are due mainly to noise from electronic components in the oscillator circuits. Long-term stability is limited by aging of the crystal.

Due to aging and environmental factors (such as temperature and vibration), it is difficult to keep even the best quartz oscillators within one part in 1010 of their nominal frequency without constant adjustment. For this reason, atomic oscillators are used for applications requiring better long-term stability and accuracy.

===Spurious frequencies===

For crystals operated at series resonance or pulled away from the main mode by the inclusion of a series inductor or capacitor, significant (and temperature-dependent) spurious responses may be experienced. Though most spurious modes are typically some tens of kilohertz above the wanted series resonance, their temperature coefficient is different from the main mode, and the spurious response may move through the main mode at certain temperatures. Even if the series resistances at the spurious resonances appear higher than the one at the wanted frequency, a rapid change in the main mode series resistance can occur at specific temperatures when the two frequencies are coincidental.
A consequence of these activity dips is that the oscillator may lock at a spurious frequency at specific temperatures. This is generally minimized by ensuring that the maintaining circuit has insufficient gain to activate unwanted modes.

Spurious frequencies are also generated by subjecting the crystal to vibration. This modulates the resonant frequency to a small degree by the frequency of the vibrations. SC-cut (Stress Compensated) crystals are designed to minimize the frequency effect of mounting stress and they are therefore less sensitive to vibration. Acceleration effects including gravity are also reduced with SC-cut crystals, as is frequency change with time due to long term mounting stress variation.
There are disadvantages with SC-cut shear mode crystals, such as the need for the maintaining oscillator to discriminate against other closely related unwanted modes and increased frequency change due to temperature when subject to a full ambient range. SC-cut crystals are most advantageous where temperature control at their temperature of zero temperature coefficient (turnover) is possible, under these circumstances an overall stability performance from premium units can approach the stability of rubidium frequency standards.

==Commonly used crystal frequencies==

Crystals can be manufactured for oscillation over a wide range of frequencies, from a few kilohertz up to several hundred megahertz. Many applications call for a crystal oscillator frequency conveniently related to some other desired frequency, so hundreds of standard crystal frequencies are made in large quantities and stocked by electronics distributors. For example 3.579545 MHz crystals, which were made in large quantities for NTSC color television receivers, are now popular for many non-television applications (although most modern television receivers now use other frequency crystals for the color decoder). Using frequency dividers, frequency multipliers and phase-locked loop circuits, it is practical to derive a wide range of frequencies from one reference frequency.

==Crystal structures and materials==

=== Quartz ===


The most common material for oscillator crystals is quartz. At the beginning of the technology, natural quartz crystals were used but now synthetic crystalline quartz grown by hydrothermal synthesis is predominant due to higher purity, lower cost and more convenient handling. One of the few remaining uses of natural crystals is for pressure transducers in deep wells. During World War II and for some time afterwards, natural quartz was considered a strategic material by the USA. Large crystals were imported from Brazil. Raw &quot;lascas&quot;, the source material quartz for hydrothermal synthesis, are imported to USA or mined locally by Coleman Quartz. The average value of as-grown synthetic quartz in 1994 was 

==== Types ====
Two types of quartz crystals exist: left-handed and right-handed. The two differ in their optical rotation but they are identical in other physical properties. Both left and right-handed crystals can be used for oscillators, if the cut angle is correct. In manufacture, right-handed quartz is generally used. The SiO4 tetrahedrons form parallel helices; the direction of twist of the helix determines the left- or right-hand orientation. The helixes are aligned along the c-axis and merged, sharing atoms. The mass of the helixes forms a mesh of small and large channels parallel to the c-axis. The large ones are large enough to allow some mobility of smaller ions and molecules through the crystal.

Quartz exists in several phases. At 573 °C at 1 atmosphere (and at higher temperatures and higher pressures) the α-quartz undergoes quartz inversion, transforms reversibly to β-quartz. The reverse process however is not entirely homogeneous and crystal twinning occurs. Care must be taken during manufacturing and processing to avoid phase transformation. Other phases, e.g. the higher-temperature phases tridymite and cristobalite, are not significant for oscillators. All quartz oscillator crystals are the α-quartz type.

==== Quality ====
Infrared spectrophotometry is used as one of the methods for measuring the quality of the grown crystals. The wavenumbers 3585, 3500, and 3410 cm−1 are commonly used. The measured value is based on the absorption bands of the OH radical and the infrared Q value is calculated. The electronic grade crystals, grade C, have Q of 1.8 million or above; the premium grade B crystals have Q of 2.2 million, and special premium grade A crystals have Q of 3.0 million. The Q value is calculated only for the z region; crystals containing other regions can be adversely affected. Another quality indicator is the etch channel density; when the crystal is etched, tubular channels are created along linear defects. For processing involving etching, e.g. the wristwatch tuning fork crystals, low etch channel density is desirable. The etch channel density for swept quartz is about 10–100 and significantly more for unswept quartz. Presence of etch channels and etch pits degrades the resonator&#x27;s Q and introduces nonlinearities.

==== Production ====

Quartz crystals can be grown for specific purposes.

Crystals for AT-cut are the most common in mass production of oscillator materials; the shape and dimensions are optimized for high yield of the required wafers. High-purity quartz crystals are grown with especially low content of aluminium, alkali metal and other impurities and minimal defects; the low amount of alkali metals provides increased resistance to ionizing radiation. Crystals for wrist watches, for cutting the tuning fork 32768 Hz crystals, are grown with very low etch channel density.

Crystals for SAW devices are grown as flat, with large X-size seed with low etch channel density.

Special high-Q crystals, for use in highly stable oscillators, are grown at constant slow speed and have constant low infrared absorption along the entire Z axis. Crystals can be grown as Y-bar, with a seed crystal in bar shape and elongated along the Y axis, or as Z-plate, grown from a plate seed with Y-axis direction length and X-axis width. The region around the seed crystal contains a large number of crystal defects and should not be used for the wafers.

Crystals grow anisotropically; the growth along the Z axis is up to 3 times faster than along the X axis. The growth direction and rate also influences the rate of uptake of impurities. Y-bar crystals, or Z-plate crystals with long Y axis, have four growth regions usually called +X, −X, Z, and S. The distribution of impurities during growth is uneven; different growth areas contain different levels of contaminants. The Z regions are the purest, the small occasionally present S regions are less pure, the +X region is yet less pure, and the -X region has the highest level of impurities. The impurities have a negative impact on radiation hardness, susceptibility to twinning, filter loss, and long and short term stability of the crystals. Different-cut seeds in different orientations may provide other kinds of growth regions. The growth speed of the −X direction is slowest due to the effect of adsorption of water molecules on the crystal surface; aluminium impurities suppress growth in two other directions. The content of aluminium is lowest in Z region, higher in +X, yet higher in −X, and highest in S; the size of S regions also grows with increased amount of aluminium present. The content of hydrogen is lowest in Z region, higher in +X region, yet higher in S region, and highest in −X. Aluminium inclusions transform into color centers with gamma-ray irradiation, causing a darkening of the crystal proportional to the dose and level of impurities; the presence of regions with different darkness reveals the different growth regions.

The dominant type of defect of concern in quartz crystals is the substitution of an Al(III) for a Si(IV) atom in the crystal lattice. The aluminium ion has an associated interstitial charge compensator present nearby, which can be a H+ ion (attached to the nearby oxygen and forming a hydroxyl group, called Al−OH defect), Li+ ion, Na+ ion, K+ ion (less common), or an electron hole trapped in a nearby oxygen atom orbital. The composition of the growth solution, whether it is based on lithium or sodium alkali compounds, determines the charge compensating ions for the aluminium defects. The ion impurities are of concern as they are not firmly bound and can migrate through the crystal, altering the local lattice elasticity and the resonant frequency of the crystal. Other common impurities of concern are e.g. iron(III) (interstitial), fluorine, boron(III), phosphorus(V) (substitution), titanium(IV) (substitution, universally present in magmatic quartz, less common in hydrothermal quartz), and germanium(IV) (substitution). Sodium and iron ions can cause inclusions of acnite and elemeusite crystals. Inclusions of water may be present in fast-grown crystals; interstitial water molecules are abundant near the crystal seed. Another defect of importance is the hydrogen containing growth defect, when instead of a Si−O−Si structure, a pair of Si−OH HO−Si groups is formed; essentially a hydrolyzed bond. Fast-grown crystals contain more hydrogen defects than slow-grown ones. These growth defects source as supply of hydrogen ions for radiation-induced processes and forming Al-OH defects. Germanium impurities tend to trap electrons created during irradiation; the alkali metal cations then migrate towards the negatively charged center and form a stabilizing complex. Matrix defects can also be present; oxygen vacancies, silicon vacancies (usually compensated by 4 hydrogens or 3 hydrogens and a hole), peroxy groups, etc. Some of the defects produce localized levels in the forbidden band, serving as charge traps; Al(III) and B(III) typically serve as hole traps while electron vacancies, titanium, germanium, and phosphorus atoms serve as electron traps. The trapped charge carriers can be released by heating; their recombination is the cause of thermoluminescence.

The mobility of interstitial ions depends strongly on temperature. Hydrogen ions are mobile down to 10 K, but alkali metal ions become mobile only at temperatures around and above 200 K.
The hydroxyl defects can be measured by near-infrared spectroscopy. The trapped holes can be measured by electron spin resonance. The Al−Na+ defects show as an acoustic loss peak due to their stress-induced motion; the Al−Li+ defects do not form a potential well so are not detectable this way. Some of the radiation-induced defects during their thermal annealing produce thermoluminescence; defects related to aluminium, titanium, and germanium can be distinguished.

Swept crystals are crystals that have undergone a solid-state electrodiffusion purification process. Sweeping involves heating the crystal above 500 °C in a hydrogen-free atmosphere, with a voltage gradient of at least 1 kV/cm, for several hours (usually over 12). The migration of impurities and the gradual replacement of alkali metal ions with hydrogen (when swept in air) or electron holes (when swept in vacuum) causes a weak electric current through the crystal; decay of this current to a constant value signals the end of the process. The crystal is then left to cool, while the electric field is maintained. The impurities are concentrated at the cathode region of the crystal, which is cut off afterwards and discarded. Swept crystals have increased resistance to radiation, as the dose effects are dependent on the level of alkali metal impurities; they are suitable for use in devices exposed to ionizing radiation, e.g. for nuclear and space technology. Sweeping under vacuum at higher temperatures and higher field strengths yields yet more radiation-hard crystals. The level and character of impurities can be measured by infrared spectroscopy. Quartz can be swept in both α and β phase; sweeping in β phase is faster, but the phase transition may induce twinning. Twinning can be mitigated by subjecting the crystal to compression stress in the X direction, or an AC or DC electric field along the X axis while the crystal cools through the phase transformation temperature region.

Sweeping can also be used to introduce one kind of an impurity into the crystal. Lithium, sodium, and hydrogen swept crystals are used for, e.g., studying quartz behavior.

Very small crystals for high fundamental-mode frequencies can be manufactured by photolithography.

Crystals can be adjusted to exact frequencies by laser trimming. A technique used in the world of amateur radio for slight decrease of the crystal frequency may be achieved by exposing crystals with silver electrodes to vapors of iodine, which causes a slight mass increase on the surface by forming a thin layer of silver iodide; such crystals however had problematic long-term stability. Another method commonly used is electrochemical increase or decrease of silver electrode thickness by submerging a resonator in lapis lazuli dissolved in water, citric acid in water, or water with salt, and using the resonator as one electrode, and a small silver electrode as the other.

By choosing the direction of current one can either increase or decrease the mass of the electrodes.
Details were published in &quot;Radio&quot; magazine (3/1978) by UB5LEV.

Raising frequency by scratching off parts of the electrodes is not advised as this may damage the crystal and lower its Q factor. Capacitor trimmers can be also used for frequency adjustment of the oscillator circuit.

=== Other materials ===
Some other piezoelectric materials than quartz can be employed. These include single crystals of lithium tantalate, lithium niobate, lithium borate, berlinite, gallium arsenide, lithium tetraborate, aluminium phosphate, bismuth germanium oxide, polycrystalline zirconium titanate ceramics, high-alumina ceramics, silicon-zinc oxide composite, or dipotassium tartrate. Some materials may be more suitable for specific applications. An oscillator crystal can be also manufactured by depositing the resonator material on the silicon chip surface. Crystals of gallium phosphate, langasite, langanite and langatate are about 10 times more pullable than the corresponding quartz crystals, and are used in some VCXO oscillators.

==Stability==
The frequency stability is determined by the crystal&#x27;s Q. It is inversely dependent on the frequency, and on the constant that is dependent on the particular cut. Other factors influencing Q are the overtone used, the temperature, the level of driving of the crystal, the quality of the surface finish, the mechanical stresses imposed on the crystal by bonding and mounting, the geometry of the crystal and the attached electrodes, the material purity and defects in the crystal, type and pressure of the gas in the enclosure, interfering modes, and presence and absorbed dose of ionizing and neutron radiation.

The stability of AT cut crystals decreases with increasing frequency. For more accurate higher frequencies it is better to use a crystal with lower fundamental frequency, operating at an overtone.

A badly designed oscillator circuit may suddenly begin oscillating on an overtone. In 1972, a train in Fremont, California crashed due to a faulty oscillator. An inappropriate value of the tank capacitor caused the crystal in a control board to be overdriven, jumping to an overtone, and causing the train to speed up instead of slowing down.

=== Temperature ===
Temperature influences the operating frequency; various forms of compensation are used, from analog compensation (TCXO) and microcontroller compensation (MCXO) to stabilization of the temperature with a crystal oven (OCXO). The crystals possess temperature hysteresis; the frequency at a given temperature achieved by increasing the temperature is not equal to the frequency on the same temperature achieved by decreasing the temperature. The temperature sensitivity depends primarily on the cut; the temperature compensated cuts are chosen as to minimize frequency/temperature dependence. Special cuts can be made with linear temperature characteristics; the LC cut is used in quartz thermometers. Other influencing factors are the overtone used, the mounting and electrodes, impurities in the crystal, mechanical strain, crystal geometry, rate of temperature change, thermal history (due to hysteresis), ionizing radiation, and drive level.

Crystals tend to suffer anomalies in their frequency/temperature and resistance/temperature characteristics, known as activity dips. These are small downward frequency or upward resistance excursions localized at certain temperatures, with their temperature position dependent on the value of the load capacitors.

=== Mechanical stress ===
Mechanical stresses also influence the frequency. The stresses can be induced by mounting, bonding, and application of the electrodes, by differential thermal expansion of the mounting, electrodes, and the crystal itself, by differential thermal stresses when there is a temperature gradient present, by expansion or shrinkage of the bonding materials during curing, by the air pressure that is transferred to the ambient pressure within the crystal enclosure, by the stresses of the crystal lattice itself (nonuniform growth, impurities, dislocations), by the surface imperfections and damage caused during manufacture, and by the action of gravity on the mass of the crystal; the frequency can therefore be influenced by position of the crystal. Other dynamic stress inducing factors are shocks, vibrations, and acoustic noise. Some cuts are less sensitive to stresses; the SC (stress-compensated) cut is an example. Atmospheric pressure changes can also introduce deformations to the housing, influencing the frequency by changing stray capacitances.

Atmospheric humidity influences the thermal transfer properties of air, and can change electrical properties of plastics by diffusion of water molecules into their structure, altering the dielectric constants and electrical conductivity.

Other factors influencing the frequency are the power supply voltage, load impedance, magnetic fields, electric fields (in case of cuts that are sensitive to them, e.g., SC cuts), the presence and absorbed dose of γ-particles and ionizing radiation, and the age of the crystal.

== Aging ==
Crystals undergo slow gradual change of frequency with time, known as aging. There are many mechanisms involved. The mounting and contacts may undergo relief of the built-in stresses. Molecules of contamination either from the residual atmosphere, outgassed from the crystal, electrodes or packaging materials, or introduced during sealing the housing can be adsorbed on the crystal surface, changing its mass; this effect is exploited in quartz crystal microbalances. The composition of the crystal can be gradually altered by outgassing, diffusion of atoms of impurities or migrating from the electrodes, or the lattice can be damaged by radiation. Slow chemical reactions may occur on or in the crystal, or on the inner surfaces of the enclosure. Electrode material, e.g. chromium or aluminium, can react with the crystal, creating layers of metal oxide and silicon; these interface layers can undergo changes in time. The pressure in the enclosure can change due to varying atmospheric pressure, temperature, leaks, or outgassing of the materials inside. Factors outside of the crystal itself are e.g. aging of the oscillator circuitry (and e.g. change of capacitances), and drift of parameters of the crystal oven. External atmosphere composition can also influence the aging; hydrogen can diffuse through nickel housing. Helium can cause similar issues when it diffuses through glass enclosures of rubidium standards.

Gold is a favored electrode material for low-aging resonators; its adhesion to quartz is strong enough to maintain contact even at strong mechanical shocks, but weak enough to not support significant strain gradients (unlike chromium, aluminium, and nickel). Gold also does not commonly form oxides; it adsorbs organic contaminants from the air, but these are easy to remove. However, gold alone can undergo delamination; a layer of chromium is therefore sometimes used for improved binding strength. Silver and aluminium are often used as electrodes; however both form oxide layers with time that increases the crystal mass and lowers frequency. Silver can be passivated by exposition to iodine vapors, forming a layer of silver iodide. Aluminium oxidizes readily but slowly, until about 5 nm thickness is reached; increased temperature during artificial aging does not significantly increase the oxide forming speed; a thick oxide layer can be formed during manufacture by anodizing. Exposition of silver-plated crystal to iodine vapors can also be used in amateur conditions for lowering the crystal frequency slightly; the frequency can also be increased by scratching off parts of the electrodes, but that carries risk of damage to the crystal and loss of Q.

A DC voltage bias between the electrodes can accelerate the initial aging, probably by induced diffusion of impurities through the crystal. Placing a capacitor in series with the crystal and a several-megaohm resistor in parallel can minimize such voltages.

Aging decreases logarithmically with time, the largest changes occurring shortly after manufacture. Artificially aging a crystal by prolonged storage at 85 to 125 °C can increase its long-term stability.

=== Mechanical damage ===
Crystals are sensitive to shock. The mechanical stress causes a short-term change in the oscillator frequency due to the stress-sensitivity of the crystal, and can introduce a permanent change of frequency due to shock-induced changes of mounting and internal stresses (if the elastic limits of the mechanical parts are exceeded), desorption of contamination from the crystal surfaces, or change in parameters of the oscillator circuit. High magnitudes of shocks may tear the crystals off their mountings (especially in the case of large low-frequency crystals suspended on thin wires), or cause cracking of the crystal. Crystals free of surface imperfections are highly shock-resistant; chemical polishing can produce crystals able to survive tens of thousands of g.

Crystals have no inherent failure mechanisms; some have operated in devices for decades. Failures may be, however, introduced by faults in bonding, leaky enclosures, corrosion, frequency shift by aging, breaking the crystal by too high mechanical shock, or radiation-induced damage when non-swept quartz is used. Crystals can be also damaged by overdriving.

=== Frequency fluctuations ===
Crystals suffer from minor short-term frequency fluctuations as well. The main causes of such noise are e.g. thermal noise (which limits the noise floor), phonon scattering (influenced by lattice defects), adsorption/desorption of molecules on the surface of the crystal, noise of the oscillator circuits, mechanical shocks and vibrations, acceleration and orientation changes, temperature fluctuations, and relief of mechanical stresses. The short-term stability is measured by four main parameters: Allan variance (the most common one specified in oscillator data sheets), phase noise, spectral density of phase deviations, and spectral density of fractional frequency deviations. The effects of acceleration and vibration tend to dominate the other noise sources; surface acoustic wave devices tend to be more sensitive than bulk acoustic wave (BAW) ones, and the stress-compensated cuts are even less sensitive. The relative orientation of the acceleration vector to the crystal dramatically influences the crystal&#x27;s vibration sensitivity. Mechanical vibration isolation mountings can be used for high-stability crystals.

Phase noise plays a significant role in frequency synthesis systems using frequency multiplication; a multiplication of a frequency by N increases the phase noise power by N2. A frequency multiplication by 10 times multiplies the magnitude of the phase error by 10 times. This can be disastrous for systems employing PLL or FSK technologies.

Magnetic fields have little effect on the crystal itself, as quartz is diamagnetic; eddy currents or AC voltages can however be induced into the circuits, and magnetic parts of the mounting and housing may be influenced.

After the power-up, the crystals take several seconds to minutes to &quot;warm up&quot; and stabilize their frequency. The oven-controlled OCXOs require usually 3–10 minutes for heating up to reach thermal equilibrium; the oven-less oscillators stabilize in several seconds as the few milliwatts dissipated in the crystal cause a small but noticeable level of internal heating.

===Drive level===
The crystals have to be driven at the appropriate drive level. Low-frequency crystals, especially flexural-mode ones, may fracture at too high drive levels. The drive level is specified as the amount of power dissipated in the crystal. The appropriate drive levels are about 5 μW for flexural modes up to 100 kHz, 1 μW for fundamental modes at 1–4 MHz, 0.5 μW for fundamental modes 4–20 MHz and 0.5 μW for overtone modes at 20–200 MHz. Too low drive level may cause problems with starting the oscillator. Low drive levels are better for higher stability and lower power consumption of the oscillator. Higher drive levels, in turn, reduce the impact of noise by increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.

==Crystal cuts==
The resonator plate can be cut from the source crystal in many different ways. The orientation of the cut influences the crystal&#x27;s aging characteristics, frequency stability, thermal characteristics, and other parameters. These cuts operate at bulk acoustic wave (BAW); for higher frequencies, surface acoustic wave (SAW) devices are employed.

Image of several crystal cuts

The letter ‘T’ in the cut name marks a temperature-compensated cut – a cut oriented in a way that the temperature coefficients of the lattice are minimal; the FC and SC cuts are also temperature-compensated.

The high frequency cuts are mounted by their edges, usually on springs; the stiffness of the spring has to be optimal, as if it is too stiff, mechanical shocks could be transferred to the crystal and cause it to break, and too little stiffness may allow the crystal to collide with the inside of the package when subjected to a mechanical shock, and break. Strip resonators, usually AT cuts, are smaller and therefore less sensitive to mechanical shocks. At the same frequency and overtone, the strip has less pullability, higher resistance, and higher temperature coefficient.

The low frequency cuts are mounted at the nodes where they are virtually motionless; thin wires are attached at such points on each side between the crystal and the leads. The large mass of the crystal suspended on the thin wires makes the assembly sensitive to mechanical shocks and vibrations.

The crystals are usually mounted in hermetically sealed glass or metal cases, filled with a dry and inert atmosphere, usually vacuum, nitrogen, or helium. Plastic housings can be used as well, but those are not hermetic and another secondary sealing has to be built around the crystal.

Several resonator configurations are possible, in addition to the classical way of directly attaching leads to the crystal. E.g. the BVA resonator (Boîtier à Vieillissement Amélioré, Enclosure with Improved Aging), developed in 1976; the parts that influence the vibrations are machined from a single crystal (which reduces the mounting stress), and the electrodes are deposited not on the resonator itself but on the inner sides of two condenser discs made of adjacent slices of the quartz from the same bar, forming a three-layer sandwich with no stress between the electrodes and the vibrating element. The gap between the electrodes and the resonator act as two small series capacitors, making the crystal less sensitive to circuit influences. The architecture eliminates the effects of the surface contacts between the electrodes, the constraints in the mounting connections, and the issues related to ion migration from the electrodes into the lattice of the vibrating element. The resulting configuration is rugged, resistant to shock and vibration, resistant to acceleration and ionizing radiation, and has improved aging characteristics. AT cut is usually used, though SC cut variants exist as well. BVA resonators are often used in spacecraft applications.

In the 1930s to 1950s, it was fairly common for people to adjust the frequency of the crystals by manual grinding. The crystals were ground using a fine abrasive slurry, or even a toothpaste, to increase their frequency. A slight decrease by 1–2 kHz when the crystal was overground was possible by marking the crystal face with a pencil lead, at the cost of a lowered .

The frequency of the crystal is slightly adjustable (&quot;pullable&quot;) by modifying the attached capacitances. A varactor, a diode with capacitance depending on applied voltage, is often used in voltage-controlled crystal oscillators, VCXO. The crystal cuts are usually AT or rarely SC, and operate in fundamental mode; the amount of available frequency deviation is inversely proportional to the square of the overtone number, so a third overtone has only one-ninth of the pullability of the fundamental mode. SC cuts, while more stable, are significantly less pullable.

<text>Curve-fitting compaction is data compaction accomplished by replacing data to be stored or transmitted with an analytical expression.

Examples of curve-fitting compaction consisting of discretization and then interpolation are:
* Breaking of a continuous curve into a series of straight line segments and specifying the slope, intercept, and range for each segment 
* Using a mathematical expression, such as a polynomial or a trigonometric function, and a single point on the corresponding curve instead of storing or transmitting the entire graphic curve or a series of points on it.
== See also ==
* Multivariate adaptive regression splines

<text>In telecommunications, a customer-premises equipment or customer-provided equipment (CPE) is any terminal and associated equipment located at a subscriber&#x27;s premises and connected with a carrier&#x27;s telecommunication circuit at the demarcation point (&quot;demarc&quot;). The demarc is a point established in a building or complex to separate customer equipment from the equipment located in either the distribution infrastructure or central office of the communications service provider.

CPE generally refers to devices such as telephones, routers, network switches, residential gateways (RG), set-top boxes, fixed mobile convergence products, home networking adapters and Internet access gateways that enable consumers to access providers&#x27; communication services and distribute them in a residence or enterprise with a local area network (LAN).

A CPE can be an active equipment, as the ones mentioned above, or passive equipment such as analog telephone adapters (ATA) or xDSL-splitters. This includes key telephone systems and most private branch exchanges. Excluded from the CPE category are overvoltage protection equipment and pay telephones. Other types of materials that are necessary for the delivery of the telecommunication service, but are not defined as equipment, such as manuals and cable packages, and cable adapters are instead referred to as CPE-peripherals.

CPE can refer to devices purchased by the subscriber, or to those provided by the operator or service provider.

== History ==
The two phrases, &quot;customer-&quot;premises&quot; equipment&quot; and &quot;customer-&quot;provided&quot; equipment&quot;, reflect the history of this equipment.

Under the Bell System monopoly in the United States (post Communications Act of 1934), the Bell System owned the telephones, and one could not attach privately owned or supplied devices to the network, or to the station apparatus. Telephones were located on customers&#x27; premises, hence, customer-&quot;premises&quot; equipment. In the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) proceeding the Second Computer Inquiry, the FCC ruled that telecommunications carriers could no longer bundle CPE with telecommunications service, uncoupling the market power of the telecommunications service monopoly from the CPE market, and creating a competitive CPE market.

With the gradual breakup of the Bell monopoly, starting with Hush-A-Phone v. United States [1956], which allowed some non-Bell owned equipment to be connected to the network (a process called interconnection), equipment on customers&#x27; premises became increasingly owned by customers. Indeed, subscribers were eventually permitted to purchase telephones – hence, customer-&quot;provided&quot; equipment.

In the pay-TV industry many operators and service providers offer subscribers a set-top box with which to receive video services, in return for a monthly fee. As offerings have evolved to include multiple services [voice and data] operators have increasingly given consumers the opportunity to rent or buy additional devices like access modems, internet gateways and video extenders that enable them to access multiple services, and distribute them to a range of consumer electronics devices in the home.

==Technology evolution ==

===Hybrid devices===
The growth of multiple system operators, offering triple or quad-play services, required the development of hybrid CPE to make it easy for subscribers to access voice, video and data services. The development of this technology was led by Pay TV operators looking for a way to deliver video services via both traditional broadcast and broadband IP networks. Spain&#x27;s Telefonica was the first operator to launch a hybrid broadcast and broadband TV service in 2003 with its Movistar TV DTT/IPTV offering, while Polish satellite operator &#x27;n&#x27; was the first to offer its subscribers a Three-way hybrid (or Tri-brid) broadcast and broadband TV service, which launched in 2009

===Set-back box===
The term set-back box is used in the digital TV industry to describe a piece of consumer hardware that enables them to access both linear broadcast and internet-based video content, plus a range of interactive services like Electronic Programme Guides (EPG), Pay Per View (PPV) and video on demand (VOD) as well as internet browsing, and view them on a large screen television set. Unlike standard set-top boxes, which sit on top of or below the TV, a set-back box has a smaller form factor to enable it to be mounted to the rear of the display panel flat panel TV, hiding it from view.

===Residential gateway===
A residential gateway is a networking device used to connect devices in the home to the Internet or other wide area network (WAN).
It is an umbrella term, used to cover multi-function networking appliances used in homes, which may combine a DSL modem or cable modem, a network switch, a consumer-grade router, and a wireless access point. In the past, such functions were provided by separate devices, but in recent years technological convergence has enabled multiple functions to be merged into a single device.

One of the first home gateway devices to be launched was selected by Telecom Italia to enable the operator to offer triple play services in 2002: Along with a SIP VoIP handset for making voice calls, it enabled subscribers to access voice, video and data services over a 10MB symmetrical ADSL fiber connection.

===Virtual gateway===
The virtual gateway concept enables consumers to access video and data services and distribute them around their homes using software rather than hardware. The first virtual gateway was introduced in 2010 by Advanced Digital Broadcast at the IBC exhibition in Amsterdam. The ADB Virtual Gateway uses software that resides within the middleware and is based on open standards, including DLNA home networking and the DTCP-IP standard, to ensure that all content, including paid-for encrypted content like Pay TV services, can only be accessed by secure CE devices.

== Broadband ==
A subscriber unit, or SU is a broadband radio that is installed at a business or residential location to connect to an access point to send/receive high speed data wired or wirelessly. Devices commonly referred to as a subscriber unit include cable modems, access gateways, home networking adapters and mobile phones. Example brands and vendors include SpeedTouch, DrayTek, Ubee Interactive, 2Wire and Efficient Networks.

== WAN ==
CPE may also refer to any devices that terminate a WAN circuit, such as an ISDN, E-carrier/T-carrier, DSL, or metro Ethernet. This includes any customer-owned hardware at the customer&#x27;s site: routers, firewalls, network switches, PBXs, VoIP gateways, sometimes CSU/DSU and modems.

<doc id="40985" wikidata="Q5196720" url="?curid=40985" title="Cutback technique">
<text>In telecommunications, a cutback technique is a destructive technique for determining certain optical fiber transmission characteristics, such as attenuation and bandwidth.

==Procedure==
The measurement technique consists of:
#performing the desired measurements on a long length of the fiber under test,
#cutting the fiber under test at a point near the launching end,
#repeating the measurements on the short length of fiber, and
#subtracting the results obtained on the short length to determine the results for the residual long length.

The cut should be made to retain 1 meter or more of the fiber, in order to establish equilibrium mode distribution conditions for the second measurement. In a multimode fiber, the lack of an equilibrium mode distribution could introduce errors in the measurement due to output coupling effects. In a single-mode fiber, measuring a shorter cutback fiber could result in significant transmission of cladding modes (light carried in the cladding rather than the core of the optical fiber), distorting the measurement. The errors introduced will result in conservative results (&quot;i.e.&quot;, higher transmission losses and lower bandwidths) than would be realized under equilibrium conditions.

== Benefits ==
The benefit of this technique is that it allows measurement of the fiber characteristics without introducing errors due to variation in the launch conditions. For example, the coupling efficiency of the light source is kept consistent between the initial and the cutback measurements.

Several characteristics may be determined using the same test fiber.

== Attenuation measurement ==
Since the attenuation is defined as proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between formula_1 and formula_2, where formula_3 is the power at point formula_4 and formula_5 respectively. Using the cutback technique, the power transmitted through a fiber of known length is measured and compared with the same measurement for the same fiber cut to a length of formula_6 approximately.

== Related techniques ==
A variation of the cutback technique is the substitution method, in which measurements are made on a full-length of fiber, and then on a short length of fiber having the same characteristics (core size, numerical aperture), with the results from the short length being subtracted to give the results for the full length.

<doc id="40986" wikidata="Q1455881" url="?curid=40986" title="Cutoff frequency">
<text>In physics and electrical engineering, a cutoff frequency, corner frequency, or break frequency is a boundary in a system&#x27;s frequency response at which energy flowing through the system begins to be reduced (attenuated or reflected) rather than passing through.

Typically in electronic systems such as filters and communication channels, cutoff frequency applies to an edge in a lowpass, highpass, bandpass, or band-stop characteristic – a frequency characterizing a boundary between a passband and a stopband. It is sometimes taken to be the point in the filter response where a transition band and passband meet, for example, as defined by a half-power point (a frequency for which the output of the circuit is approximately −3.01 dB of the nominal passband value). Alternatively, a stopband corner frequency may be specified as a point where a transition band and a stopband meet: a frequency for which the attenuation is larger than the required stopband attenuation, which for example may be 30 dB or 100 dB.

In the case of a waveguide or an antenna, the cutoff frequencies correspond to the lower and upper cutoff wavelengths.

==Electronics==
In electronics, cutoff frequency or corner frequency is the frequency either above or below which the power output of a circuit, such as a line, amplifier, or electronic filter has fallen to a given proportion of the power in the passband. Most frequently this proportion is one half the passband power, also referred to as the 3 dB point since a fall of 3 dB corresponds approximately to half power. As a voltage ratio this is a fall to formula_1 of the passband voltage. Other ratios besides the 3 dB point may also be relevant, for example see below. Far from the cutoff frequency in the transition band, the rate of increase of attenuation (roll-off) with logarithm of frequency is asymptotic to a constant. For a first-order network, the roll-off is −20 dB per decade (approximately −6 dB per octave.)

===Single-pole transfer function example===
The transfer function for the simplest low-pass filter,
formula_2
has a single pole at . The magnitude of this function in the plane is
formula_3

At cutoff
formula_4

Hence, the cutoff frequency is given by
formula_5

Where is the s-plane variable, is angular frequency and is the imaginary unit.

===Chebyshev filters===
Sometimes other ratios are more convenient than the 3 dB point. For instance, in the case of the Chebyshev filter it is usual to define the cutoff frequency as the point after the last peak in the frequency response at which the level has fallen to the design value of the passband ripple. The amount of ripple in this class of filter can be set by the designer to any desired value, hence the ratio used could be any value.

==Radio communications==
In radio communication, skywave communication is a technique in which radio waves are transmitted at an angle into the sky and reflected back to Earth by layers of charged particles in the ionosphere. In this context, the term &quot;cutoff frequency&quot; refers to the maximum usable frequency, the frequency above which a radio wave fails to reflect off the ionosphere at the incidence angle required for transmission between two specified points by reflection from the layer.

==Waveguides==
The cutoff frequency of an electromagnetic waveguide is the lowest frequency for which a mode will propagate in it. In fiber optics, it is more common to consider the cutoff wavelength, the maximum wavelength that will propagate in an optical fiber or waveguide. The cutoff frequency is found with the characteristic equation of the Helmholtz equation for electromagnetic waves, which is derived from the electromagnetic wave equation by setting the longitudinal wave number equal to zero and solving for the frequency. Thus, any exciting frequency lower than the cutoff frequency will attenuate, rather than propagate. The following derivation assumes lossless walls. The value of c, the speed of light, should be taken to be the group velocity of light in whatever material fills the waveguide.

For a rectangular waveguide, the cutoff frequency is
formula_6
where formula_7 are the mode numbers for the rectangle&#x27;s sides of length formula_8 and formula_9 respectively. For TE modes, formula_10 (but formula_11 is not allowed), while for TM modes formula_12.

The cutoff frequency of the TM01 mode (next higher from dominant mode TE11) in a waveguide of circular cross-section (the transverse-magnetic mode with no angular dependence and lowest radial dependence) is given by 
formula_13
where formula_14 is the radius of the waveguide, and formula_15 is the first root of formula_16, the Bessel function of the first kind of order 1.

The dominant mode TE11 cutoff frequency is given by
formula_17

However, the dominant mode cutoff frequency can be reduced by the introduction of baffle inside the circular cross-section waveguide. For a single-mode optical fiber, the cutoff wavelength is the wavelength at which the normalized frequency is approximately equal to 2.405.

===Mathematical analysis===
The starting point is the wave equation (which is derived from the Maxwell equations),
formula_18
which becomes a Helmholtz equation by considering only functions of the form 
formula_19
Substituting and evaluating the time derivative gives
formula_20
The function formula_21 here refers to whichever field (the electric field or the magnetic field) has no vector component in the longitudinal direction - the &quot;transverse&quot; field. It is a property of all the eigenmodes of the electromagnetic waveguide that at least one of the two fields is transverse. The &quot;z&quot; axis is defined to be along the axis of the waveguide.

The &quot;longitudinal&quot; derivative in the Laplacian can further be reduced by considering only functions of the form 
formula_22
where formula_23 is the longitudinal wavenumber, resulting in
formula_24
where subscript T indicates a 2-dimensional transverse Laplacian. The final step depends on the geometry of the waveguide. The easiest geometry to solve is the rectangular waveguide. In that case, the remainder of the Laplacian can be evaluated to its characteristic equation by considering solutions of the form 
formula_25
Thus for the rectangular guide the Laplacian is evaluated, and we arrive at
formula_26
The transverse wavenumbers can be specified from the standing wave boundary conditions for a rectangular geometry cross-section with dimensions and :
formula_27
formula_28
where and are the two integers representing a specific eigenmode. Performing the final substitution, we obtain
formula_29
which is the dispersion relation in the rectangular waveguide. The cutoff frequency formula_30 is the critical frequency between propagation and attenuation, which corresponds to the frequency at which the longitudinal wavenumber formula_31 is zero. It is given by
formula_32
The wave equations are also valid below the cutoff frequency, where the longitudinal wave number is imaginary. In this case, the field decays exponentially along the waveguide axis and the wave is thus evanescent.

<doc id="40989" wikidata="Q5227231" url="?curid=40989" title="Data access arrangement">
<text>The term data access arrangement (DAA) has the following meanings: 
#In public switched telephone networks, a single item or group of items at the customer side of the network interface device for data transmission purposes, including all equipment that may affect the characteristics of the interface. 
#A data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE) supplied or approved by a common carrier that permits a DCE or data terminal equipment (DTE) to be attached to the common carrier network.

Data access arrangements are an integral part of all modems built for the public telephone network. In view of mixed voice and data access, DAAs are more generally referred to as direct access arrangements.

== Requirement for DAAs ==
While DAA now describes an integral component of a device that connects to the telephone network, during the 60s and 70s it described a separate device mandated by the Bell System, connected between the telephone line and non-Bell equipment, typically a modem.

Following the Carterfone decision, which required Bell to allow customers to attach any non-harmful equipment to their network, Bell mandated that subscribers use PCAs/DAAs - purchased exclusively from Western Electric - to ensure the network was protected. These devices were not required for Bell-provided equipment, only equipment made by independent manufacturers.

At the time, some subscribers believed that the DAA was a scheme by AT&amp;T to penalize and discourage use of non-Bell modems and recover lost profits from hardware sales, and the FCC began investigations into the legality of the practice. Subscribers also became frustrated when Bell failed to deliver DAAs in a timely fashion after the ruling, leading to the use of unauthorized third-party DAAs.

There were two main varieties of DAA described by AT&amp;T: manual and automatic. A manual DAA required a call to be initiated (or answered) as normal, at which point it could then be connected to the third-party device, while an automatic DAA allowed an attached device to be connected without human intervention, important for receiving modem use.

In 1975, the FCC implemented Part 68 of the FCC Rules, which granted permission for direct connection of any equipment to the telephone network given compliance with specific electrical requirements. This technically eliminated the need for DAAs, although the first modem that didn&#x27;t require a separate DAA was not marketed until 1977 when a court ruled that Part 68 was legal.

<text>In database management and information architecture, a data bank or databank is a repository of information about one or more subjects, that is, a database which is organized in a way that facilitates local or remote information retrieval and is able to process many continual queries over a long period of time. 
A &quot;data bank&quot; may also refer to an organization primarily concerned with the construction and maintenance of such a database. 

A data bank may be either centralized or decentralized, though most usage of this term refers to centralized storage and retrieval of information, by way of analogy to a monetary bank. The data in a data bank can be anything from scientific information like global temperature readings, and governmental information like census statistics, to financial-system records like credit card transactions, or the inventory available from various suppliers. 

In computing, the term &quot;databank&quot; is also obsolete (1960s through 1970s) computer jargon for &quot;database&quot; itself, and is frequently used in that sense in materials written during the same time period.

<text>In telecommunications, data compaction is the reduction of the number of data elements, bandwidth, cost, and time for the generation, transmission, and storage of data without loss of information by eliminating unnecessary redundancy, removing irrelevancy, or using special coding. 

Examples of data compaction methods are the use of fixed-tolerance bands, variable-tolerance bands, slope-keypoints, sample changes, curve patterns, curve fitting, variable-precision coding, frequency analysis, and probability analysis. 

Simply squeezing noncompacted data into a smaller space, for example by increasing packing density by transferring images from newsprint to microfilm or by transferring data on punched cards onto magnetic tape, is not data compaction.

== Everyday examples ==
The use of acronyms in texting is an everyday example. The number of bits required to transmit and store &quot;WYSIWYG&quot; (What You See Is What You Get) is reduced from its expanded equivalent (7 characters vs 28). The representation of Mersenne primes is another example. The largest known is over 17 million digits long but it is represented as &quot;M&quot;57885161 in a much more compacted form.

<text>In metadata, the term data element is an atomic unit of data that has precise meaning or precise semantics. A data element has:
# An identification such as a data element name
# A clear data element definition
# One or more representation terms
# Optional enumerated values Code (metadata)
# A list of synonyms to data elements in other metadata registries Synonym ring

Data elements usage can be discovered by inspection of software applications or application data files through a process of manual or automated Application Discovery and Understanding. Once data elements are discovered they can be registered in a metadata registry.

In telecommunications, the term data element has the following components:

#A named unit of data that, in some contexts, is considered indivisible and in other contexts may consist of data items.
#A named identifier of each of the entities and their attributes that are represented in a database.
#A basic unit of information built on standard structures having a unique meaning and distinct units or values.
#In electronic record-keeping, a combination of characters or bytes referring to one separate item of information, such as name, address, or age.

In the areas of databases and data systems more generally a data element is a concept forming part of a data model. As an element of data representation, a collection of data elements forms a data structure.

== In practice ==
In practice, data elements (fields, columns, attributes, etc.) are sometimes &quot;overloaded&quot;, meaning a given data element will have multiple potential meanings. While a known bad practice, overloading is nevertheless a very real factor or barrier to understanding what a system is doing.

<text>In telecommunications, a data forwarder or data forwarding device is a device that receives data from one data link and retransmits data representing the same information, using proper format and link protocols, to another data link. In the packet networks, this act of forwarding is referred to as packet forwarding and is performed by network switches or network routers.

For example, in the tactical communications a data forwarder may forward data between: 
* links that are identical, &quot;i.e.,&quot; TADIL B to TADIL B, 
* links that are similar, &quot;i.e.,&quot; TADIL A to TADIL B, or 
* links that are dissimilar, &quot;i.e.,&quot; TADIL A to TADIL J.
More than one source notes that routers and bridges can function as data forwarding devices. Another source suggests, in fact, that gateways are a &quot;special type of data-forwarding device&quot;.

<text>A datagram is a basic transfer unit associated with a packet-switched network. Datagrams are typically structured in header and payload sections. Datagrams provide a connectionless communication service across a packet-switched network. The delivery, arrival time, and order of arrival of datagrams need not be guaranteed by the network.

== History ==
In the early 1970s, the term &quot;datagram&quot; was created by combining the words &quot;data&quot; and &quot;telegram&quot; by the CCITT rapporteur on packet switching, Halvor Bothner-By. While the word was new, the concept had already a long history.

In 1964, Paul Baran described, in a RAND Corporation report, a hypothetical military network having to resist a nuclear attack. Small standardized &quot;message blocks&quot;, bearing source and destination addresses, were stored and forwarded in computer nodes of a highly redundant meshed computer network. Baran wrote: &quot;The network user who has called up a &quot;virtual connection&quot; to an end station and has transmitted messages ... might also view the system as a black box providing an apparent circuit connection&quot;. The concept of what we now call a virtual circuit appears in the design, although no network was built.

In 1967, Donald Davies published a seminal article in which he introduced the &quot;packet&quot; and &quot;packet switching&quot;. His proposed core network is similar to the one proposed by Paul Baran though developed independently. He assumes that &quot;all users of the network will provide themselves with some kind of error control&quot;. His target is a &quot;common-carrier communication network&quot;. To support remote access to computer services by user terminals, which at that time were transmitted character by character, he included, at the network periphery, interface computers that convert character flows into packet flows and vice versa. Davies wrote: &quot;we were really rather against the virtual circuit, because we believed that a communication network should only concern itself with packets, and that any protocols involved in assembling these packets should be done end-to-end, between the customers themselves.&quot;
In 1970, Lawrence Roberts and Barry D. Wessler published an article about ARPANET, the first multi-node packet-switching network. An accompanying paper described its switching nodes (the IMPs) and its packet formats. The network core performed datagram switching as in Baran&#x27;s and Davies&#x27; model, but the service offered to hosts by the network was connection oriented. A reliable message transfer service was thus offered to user computers, thus greatly simplifying the network design. This made the ARPANET what would come to be called a virtual circuit network.

Roberts presented the idea of packet switching to the communication professionals and faced anger and hostility. Before ARPANET was operating, they argued that the router buffers would quickly run out. After the ARPANET was operating, they argued packet switching would never be economic without the government subsidy. Baran faced the same rejection and thus failed to convince the military to construct a packet-switching network.

In 1973, Louis Pouzin presented his design for CYCLADES, the first large-scale network implementing the pure Davies datagram model. The CYCLADES team has thus been the first to tackle the highly complex problem of providing user applications a reliable virtual circuit service while using the end-to-end principle in a network service known to possibly produce non-negligible datagram losses and reordering. Although Pouzin&#x27;s concern &quot;in a first stage is not to make breakthrough [sic] in packet switching technology, but to build a reliable communications tool for Cyclades&quot;, two members of his team, Hubert Zimmerman and Gérard Le Lann, made significant contributions to the design of Internet&#x27;s TCP that Vint Cerf, its main designer, acknowledged.

In 1981, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) issued the first specification the Internet Protocol (IP). It introduced a major evolution of the datagram concept: &quot;fragmentation.&quot; With fragmentation, some parts of the global network may use large packet size (typically local area networks to minimize processing overhead), while some others may impose smaller packet sizes (typically wide area networks to minimize response time). Network nodes may fragment a datagram into several smaller packets.

In 1999, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) sanctioned the use of the already largely deployed network address translation (NAT) whereby each public address can be shared by several private devices. With it, the forthcoming Internet Address exhaustion was delayed, leaving enough time to introduce IPv6, the new generation of Internet Protocol supporting longer addresses. The initial principle of full end to end network transparency to datagrams was for this relaxed: NAT nodes had to manage per-connection states, making them in part connection oriented.

In 2015, the IETF upgraded its &quot;informational&quot; 1998 RFC 2309 that datagram switching nodes perform active queue management, to make it a stronger and more detailed &quot;best current practice&quot; recommendation through the publication of RFC 7567. While the initial datagram queueing model was simple to implement and needed no more tuning than queue lengths, support of more sophisticated and parametrized mechanisms were found necessary &quot;to improve and preserve Internet performance&quot; (RED, ECN etc.). Further research on the subject was also called for, with a list of identified items.

== Definition ==
The term &quot;datagram&quot; is defined as follows:
A datagram needs to be self-contained without reliance on earlier exchanges because there is no connection of fixed duration between the two communicating points as there is, for example, in most voice telephone conversations.

Datagram service is often compared to a mail delivery service; the user only provides the destination address but receives no guarantee of delivery, and no confirmation upon successful receipt. Datagram service is therefore considered unreliable. Datagram service routes datagrams without first creating a predetermined path. Datagram service is therefore considered connectionless. There is also no consideration given to the order in which it and other datagrams are sent or received. In fact, many datagrams in the same group can travel along different paths before reaching the same destination in a different order.

== Structure ==
Each datagram has two components, a header and a data payload. The header contains all the information sufficient for routing from the originating equipment to the destination without relying on prior exchanges between the equipment and the network. Headers may include source and destination addresses as well as type and length fields. The payload is the data to be transported. This process of nesting data payloads in a tagged header is called encapsulation.

== Examples ==
=== Internet Protocol ===
The Internet Protocol (IP) defines standards for several types of datagrams. The internet layer is a datagram service provided by an IP. For example, UDP is run by a datagram service on the internet layer. IP is an entirely connectionless, best effort, unreliable, message delivery service. TCP is a higher-level protocol running on top of IP that provides a reliable connection-oriented service.

<doc id="40995" wikidata="Q461671" url="?curid=40995" title="Data integrity">
<text>Data integrity is the maintenance of, and the assurance of, data accuracy and consistency over its entire life-cycle. It is a critical aspect to the design, implementation, and usage of any system that stores, processes, or retrieves data. The term is broad in scope and may have widely different meanings depending on the specific context even under the same general umbrella of computing. It is at times used as a proxy term for data quality, while data validation is a prerequisite for data integrity.

== Definition ==
Data integrity is the opposite of data corruption. The overall intent of any data integrity technique is the same: ensure data is recorded exactly as intended (such as a database correctly rejecting mutually exclusive possibilities). Moreover, upon later retrieval, ensure the data is the same as when it was originally recorded. In short, data integrity aims to prevent unintentional changes to information. Data integrity is not to be confused with data security, the discipline of protecting data from unauthorized parties.

Any unintended changes to data as the result of a storage, retrieval or processing operation, including malicious intent, unexpected hardware failure, and human error, is failure of data integrity. If the changes are the result of unauthorized access, it may also be a failure of data security. Depending on the data involved this could manifest itself as benign as a single pixel in an image appearing a different color than was originally recorded, to the loss of vacation pictures or a business-critical database, to even catastrophic loss of human life in a life-critical system.

== Integrity types ==

=== Physical integrity ===
Physical integrity deals with challenges which are associated with correctly storing and fetching the data itself. Challenges with physical integrity may include electromechanical faults, design flaws, material fatigue, corrosion, power outages, natural disasters, and other special environmental hazards such as ionizing radiation, extreme temperatures, pressures and g-forces. Ensuring physical integrity includes methods such as redundant hardware, an uninterruptible power supply, certain types of RAID arrays, radiation hardened chips, error-correcting memory, use of a clustered file system, using file systems that employ block level checksums such as ZFS, storage arrays that compute parity calculations such as exclusive or or use a cryptographic hash function and even having a watchdog timer on critical subsystems.

Physical integrity often makes extensive use of error detecting algorithms known as error-correcting codes. Human-induced data integrity errors are often detected through the use of simpler checks and algorithms, such as the Damm algorithm or Luhn algorithm. These are used to maintain data integrity after manual transcription from one computer system to another by a human intermediary (e.g. credit card or bank routing numbers). Computer-induced transcription errors can be detected through hash functions.

In production systems, these techniques are used together to ensure various degrees of data integrity. For example, a computer file system may be configured on a fault-tolerant RAID array, but might not provide block-level checksums to detect and prevent silent data corruption. As another example, a database management system might be compliant with the ACID properties, but the RAID controller or hard disk drive&#x27;s internal write cache might not be.

=== Logical integrity ===
This type of integrity is concerned with the correctness or rationality of a piece of data, given a particular context. This includes topics such as referential integrity and entity integrity in a relational database or correctly ignoring impossible sensor data in robotic systems. These concerns involve ensuring that the data &quot;makes sense&quot; given its environment. Challenges include software bugs, design flaws, and human errors. Common methods of ensuring logical integrity include things such as check constraints, foreign key constraints, program assertions, and other run-time sanity checks.

Physical and logical integrity often share many challenges such as human errors and design flaws, and both must appropriately deal with concurrent requests to record and retrieve data, the latter of which is entirely a subject on its own.

If a data sector only has a logical error, it can be reused by overwriting it with new data. In case of a physical error, the affected data sector is permanently unusable.

== Databases ==
Data integrity contains guidelines for data retention, specifying or guaranteeing the length of time data can be retained in a particular database (typically a relational database). To achieve data integrity, these rules are consistently and routinely applied to all data entering the system, and any relaxation of enforcement could cause errors in the data. Implementing checks on the data as close as possible to the source of input (such as human data entry), causes less erroneous data to enter the system. Strict enforcement of data integrity rules results in lower error rates, and time saved troubleshooting and tracing erroneous data and the errors it causes to algorithms.

Data integrity also includes rules defining the relations a piece of data can have to other pieces of data, such as a &quot;Customer&quot; record being allowed to link to purchased &quot;Products&quot;, but not to unrelated data such as &quot;Corporate Assets&quot;. Data integrity often includes checks and correction for invalid data, based on a fixed schema or a predefined set of rules. An example being textual data entered where a date-time value is required. Rules for data derivation are also applicable, specifying how a data value is derived based on algorithm, contributors and conditions. It also specifies the conditions on how the data value could be re-derived.

=== Types of integrity constraints ===
Data integrity is normally enforced in a database system by a series of integrity constraints or rules. Three types of integrity constraints are an inherent part of the relational data model: entity integrity, referential integrity and domain integrity.

* &quot;Entity integrity&quot; concerns the concept of a primary key. Entity integrity is an integrity rule which states that every table must have a primary key and that the column or columns chosen to be the primary key should be unique and not null.
* &quot;Referential integrity&quot; concerns the concept of a foreign key. The referential integrity rule states that any foreign-key value can only be in one of two states. The usual state of affairs is that the foreign-key value refers to a primary key value of some table in the database. Occasionally, and this will depend on the rules of the data owner, a foreign-key value can be null. In this case, we are explicitly saying that either there is no relationship between the objects represented in the database or that this relationship is unknown.
* &quot;Domain integrity&quot; specifies that all columns in a relational database must be declared upon a defined domain. The primary unit of data in the relational data model is the data item. Such data items are said to be non-decomposable or atomic. A domain is a set of values of the same type. Domains are therefore pools of values from which actual values appearing in the columns of a table are drawn.
* &quot;User-defined integrity&quot; refers to a set of rules specified by a user, which do not belong to the entity, domain and referential integrity categories.

If a database supports these features, it is the responsibility of the database to ensure data integrity as well as the consistency model for the data storage and retrieval. If a database does not support these features, it is the responsibility of the applications to ensure data integrity while the database supports the consistency model for the data storage and retrieval.

Having a single, well-controlled, and well-defined data-integrity system increases:

* stability (one centralized system performs all data integrity operations)
* performance (all data integrity operations are performed in the same tier as the consistency model)
* re-usability (all applications benefit from a single centralized data integrity system)
* maintainability (one centralized system for all data integrity administration).

Modern databases support these features (see Comparison of relational database management systems), and it has become the de facto responsibility of the database to ensure data integrity. Companies, and indeed many database systems, offer products and services to migrate legacy systems to modern databases.

=== Examples ===
An example of a data-integrity mechanism is the parent-and-child relationship of related records. If a parent record owns one or more related child records all of the referential integrity processes are handled by the database itself, which automatically ensures the accuracy and integrity of the data so that no child record can exist without a parent (also called being orphaned) and that no parent loses their child records. It also ensures that no parent record can be deleted while the parent record owns any child records. All of this is handled at the database level and does not require coding integrity checks into each application.

== File systems ==
Various research results show that neither widespread filesystems (including UFS, Ext, XFS, JFS and NTFS) nor hardware RAID solutions provide sufficient protection against data integrity problems.

Some filesystems (including Btrfs and ZFS) provide internal data and metadata checksumming that is used for detecting silent data corruption and improving data integrity. If a corruption is detected that way and internal RAID mechanisms provided by those filesystems are also used, such filesystems can additionally reconstruct corrupted data in a transparent way. This approach allows improved data integrity protection covering the entire data paths, which is usually known as end-to-end data protection.

== Data integrity as applied to various industries ==

* The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has created draft guidance on data integrity for the pharmaceutical manufacturers required to adhere to U.S. Code of Federal Regulations 21 CFR Parts 210–212. Outside the U.S., similar data integrity guidance has been issued by the United Kingdom (2015), Switzerland (2016), and Australia (2017).
* Various standards for the manufacture of medical devices address data integrity either directly or indirectly, including ISO 13485, ISO 14155, and ISO 5840.
* In early 2017, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), noting data integrity problems with automated trading and money movement surveillance systems, stated it would make &quot;the development of a data integrity program to monitor the accuracy of the submitted data&quot; a priority. In early 2018, FINRA said it would expand its approach on data integrity to firms&#x27; &quot;technology change management policies and procedures&quot; and Treasury securities reviews.
* Other sectors such as mining and product manufacturing are increasingly focusing on the importance of data integrity in associated automation and production monitoring assets.

<text>A data link is a means of connecting one location to another for the purpose of transmitting and receiving digital information (data communication). It can also refer to a set of electronics assemblies, consisting of a transmitter and a receiver (two pieces of data terminal equipment) and the interconnecting data telecommunication circuit. These are governed by a link protocol enabling digital data to be transferred from a data source to a data sink.

==Types==
There are at least three types of basic data-link configurations that can be conceived of and used:
* Simplex communications, most commonly meaning all communications in one direction only.
* Half-duplex communications, meaning communications in both directions, but not both ways simultaneously.
* Duplex communications, communications in both directions simultaneously.

==Aviation==
In civil aviation, a data-link system (known as Controller Pilot Data Link Communications) is used to send information between aircraft and air traffic controllers for example when an aircraft is too far from the ATC to make voice radio communication and radar observations possible. Such systems are used for aircraft crossing the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. One such system, used by Nav Canada and NATS over the North Atlantic, uses a five-digit data link sequence number confirmed between air traffic control and the pilots of the aircraft before the aircraft proceeds to cross the ocean. This system uses the aircraft&#x27;s flight management computer to send location, speed and altitude information about the aircraft to the ATC. ATC can then send messages to the aircraft regarding any necessary change of course. 

In unmanned aircraft, land vehicles, boats, and spacecraft, a two-way (full-duplex or half-duplex) data-link is used to send control signals, and to receive telemetry.

<text>A data service unit, sometimes called a digital service unit, is a piece of telecommunications circuit terminating equipment that transforms digital data between telephone company lines and local equipment. The device converts bipolar digital signals coming ultimately from a digital circuit and directly from a Channel service unit (CSU), into a format (e.g. RS- 530) compatible with the piece of data terminal equipment (DTE) (e.g. a router) to which the data is sent. The DSU also performs a similar process in reverse for data heading from the DTE toward the circuit. The telecommunications service a DSU supports can be a point-to-point or multipoint operation in a digital data network.

==Form and purpose==
A DSU is a two or more port device; one port is called the WAN (wide area network) port and the other is called a DTE port. The purpose of the DSU is to transfer serial data synchronously between the WAN port and the DTE ports. If more than one DTE port is used, the DSU assigns the DTE data according to time slots (channels) on the WAN side.

On the WAN side, the DSU, via a CSU, interfaces with a digital carrier such as DS1 or DS3 or a low speed Digital Data Service. On the DTE side, the DSU provides control lines, timing lines and appropriate physical and electrical interface. To maintain the synchronous relationship between the ports, the DSU manages timing by slaving ports to the bit rate of another or to its internal clock. Typically, the DTE port provides timing to the data terminal equipment while the WAN port dictates the rate.

DSUs usually include some maintenance capabilities. At minimum, they can loop data back at either the WAN or DTE ports, or at both. When only one port is looped back, the data received at that port is simultaneously sent back toward the port and passed in normal fashion to the other port. Most DSUs also allow various data patterns to be generated and monitored to measure error rate of the communication link. A DSU may be a separate piece of equipment, or may be combined in a CSU/DSU.

<doc id="40998" wikidata="Q5227354" url="?curid=40998" title="Data signaling rate">
<text>In telecommunications, data signaling rate (DSR), also known as gross bit rate, is the aggregate rate at which data passes a point in the transmission path of a data transmission system.

==Properties==
# The DSR is usually expressed in bits per second.
# The data signaling rate is given by formula_1 where &quot;m&quot; is the number of parallel channels, &quot;ni&quot; is the number of significant conditions of the modulation in the &quot;i&quot;-th channel, and &quot;Ti&quot; is the unit interval, expressed in seconds, for the &quot;i&quot;-th channel.
# For serial transmission in a single channel, the DSR reduces to (1/&quot;T&quot;)log2&quot;n&quot;; with a two-condition modulation, i. e. &quot;n&quot; = 2, the DSR is 1/&quot;T&quot;, according to Hartley&#x27;s law.
# For parallel transmission with equal unit intervals and equal numbers of significant conditions on each channel, the DSR is (&quot;m&quot;/&quot;T&quot;)log2&quot;n&quot;; in the case of a two-condition modulation, this reduces to &quot;m&quot;/&quot;T&quot;.
# The DSR may be expressed in bauds, in which case, the factor log2&quot;ni&quot; in the above summation formula should be deleted when calculating bauds.
# In synchronous binary signaling, the DSR in bits per second may be numerically the same as the modulation rate expressed in bauds. Signal processors, such as four-phase modems, cannot change the DSR, but the modulation rate depends on the line modulation scheme, in accordance with Note 4. For example, in a 2400 bit/s 4-phase sending modem, the signaling rate is 2400 bit/s on the serial input side, but the modulation rate is only 1200 bauds on the 4-phase output side.

== Maximum rate ==

The &quot;maximum user signaling rate&quot;, synonymous to gross bit rate or data signaling rate, is the maximum rate, in bits per second, at which binary information can be transferred in a given direction between users over the communications system facilities dedicated to a particular information transfer transaction, under conditions of continuous transmission and no overhead information.

For a single channel, the signaling rate is given by formula_2, where &quot;SCSR&quot; is the single-channel signaling rate in bits per second, &quot;T&quot; is the minimum time interval in seconds for which each level must be maintained, and n is the number of significant conditions of modulation of the channel.

In the case where an individual end-to-end telecommunications service is provided by parallel channels, the parallel-channel signaling rate is given by formula_3, where &quot;PCSR&quot; is the total signaling rate for &quot;m&quot; channels, &quot;m&quot; is the number of parallel channels, &quot;Ti&quot; is the minimum interval between significant instants for the &quot;I&quot;-th channel, and &quot;ni&quot; is the number of significant conditions of modulation for the &quot;I&quot;-th channel.

In the case where an end-to-end telecommunications service is provided by tandem channels, the end-to-end signaling rate is the lowest signaling rate among the component channels.

<text>In communications messages, a date-time group (DTG) is a set of characters, usually in a prescribed format, used to express the year, the month, the day of the month, the hour of the day, the minute of the hour, and the time zone, if different from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). The order in which these elements are presented may vary. The DTG is usually placed in the header of the message. One example is &quot; (UTC)&quot;; while another example is &quot;&quot;.

The DTG may indicate either the date and time a message was dispatched by a transmitting station or the date and time it was handed into a transmission facility by a user or originator for dispatch.

The DTG may be used as a message identifier if it is unique for each message.

== Military Date Time Group ==
A form of DTG is used in the US Military&#x27;s message traffic (a form of Automated Message Handling System). In US military messages and communications (e.g., on maps showing troop movements) the format is &quot;DD HHMM (SS)&quot; Z&quot; MON YY&quot;. Although occasionally seen with spaces, it can also be written as a single string of characters. Three different formats can be found:
* – Full time (used for software timestamps)
* – shortened time (used e.g. for timestamps manually written)
* – short time (e.g. used for planning)
&lt;br&gt;
 references the military identifier of time zone:

<text>Deutsch-Bonnet (DB), is a brand of sports cars created in 1937 by Charles Deutsch and René Bonnet and disappeared in 1962.

The D.B Coupés, in racing or customer versions, were intensively involved in rallying and on international circuits: 24 Hours of Le Mans, 12 Hours of Sebring, 12 Hours of Reims, TdF Automobile (notably with Prince Rainier of Monaco at the wheel, who made the brand famous).

== History ==

DB (until 1947 known as Deutsch-Bonnet) was a French automobile maker between 1938 and 1961, based in Champigny-sur-Marne near Paris. The firm was founded by Charles Deutsch and René Bonnet, an offshoot of the Deutsch family&#x27;s existing coachbuilding shop which had been taken over by Bonnet in 1932. Immediately before the war the partners concentrated on making light-weight racing cars, but a few years after the war, starting with the presentation of a Panhard based cabriolet at the 1950 Paris Motor Show, the company also began to produce small road-going sports cars. By 1952 the company no longer had its own stand at the Paris Motor Show, but one of their cars appeared as a star attraction on the large Panhard stand, reflecting the level of cooperation between the two businesses.

The company was defunct by 1961, as Deutsch and Bonnet&#x27;s differing design philosophies hamstrung further cooperation. The number of DB&#x27;s built is not certain; estimates of up to 2,000 cars are mentioned but more conservative numbers are closer to one thousand.

==Light-weight engineering==
The business produced light sports cars, originally in steel or aluminium but subsequently with fibreglass bodies mainly powered by Panhard flat-twin engines, most commonly of 610, 744, or 848 cc. Deutsch was a &quot;theoretical engineer who had a natural instinct for aerodynamics,&quot; while Bonnet was a more &quot;pragmatic mechanical engineer&quot;.

The fibreglass bodies covered a tubular central beam chassis made from steel, with front wheel drive and four wheel independent suspension directly lifted from the Panhard donors. Until 1952 all DBs had been intended for competition purposes only.

==Racing origins==

Bonnet had been promised a works drive in an Amilcar Pégase in the 1936 French Grand Prix for sports cars, but when this failed to materialise they set about building their own racer. The 1938 alloy-bodied DB1 roadster was a special, built using the remains of a Citroën Traction Avant 11CV. The construction took seventeen months. A series of numbered successors followed. The close-roofed 1.5-litre DB2&#x27;s career was hindered by the war and was sold later, without Deutsch ever using it. The DB3 was a monocoque project developed during the war, but was never built, as the improved pontoon-bodied DB4 took preference. With a central beam chassis with a forked cradle for the 1.5 litre Traction 7A-based engine (originally intended for the DB2) it was finished in July 1945, with most of the work having been carried out in secret during the occupation. The very similar 2-litre DB5 was finished soon thereafter. Their two specials both placed in the first postwar race in France, in Paris in 1945, being the only post-war cars entered. An open-wheeled DB7 appeared in 1947 (preceded by the heavy and large DB6 which saw very little action), after which the &quot;Automobiles Deutsch &amp; Bonnet&quot; was officially formed.
Neither single-seater DB was at all successful, but they did show Deutsch - who had hitherto preferred dependable standard units - that a tuned engine would become necessary. DB thus moved into the performance parts market, developing and offering a four-speed conversion for Citroëns and an overhead camshaft head - developed with the aid of engine specialists Maurice Sainturat and Dante Giacosa. The DB8 appeared in 1948, and won two &quot;concours d&#x27;élegances&quot; before partaking in any competitions. Their early cars were all built using Citroën parts, but supply was troublesome and DB soon moved on to using Panhard technology. This relationship came about as Deutsch was an officer of independent racer&#x27;s club AGACI. When this organization decided to begin a &quot;Mouvement Racer 500&quot;, modelled on the British Formula 3, Deutsch offered club members the design of a racing car using a Panhard 500 engine. One member asked to have DB build such a car, and after it made a star appearance at the 1949 Paris Salon Panhard was happy to support the construction of about fifteen more. The formula expired in 1951, with the DB Panhard 500 never competitive abroad.

DB was very active in competition, especially in Le Mans 24 Hours and other long distance racing. Nearly all DBs, even the road cars, were designed with competition foremost in mind. In 1952, a DB Speedster was entered in the 12 Hours of Sebring and won its class handsomely, beginning its career in the United States market. Steve Lansing and Ward Morehouse were the drivers.

At the 1954 Le Mans DB entered five cars and were also involved with Panhards &quot;Monopole&quot; racers. René Bonnet himself, together with racing legend Élie Bayol, finished tenth overall and best of the DBs. The other Panhard-engined also finished (in 16th), while three Renault-engined central-seater DB designs all failed to complete the race. The Renault-engined designs had been created as a concession to pressure from DB&#x27;s customers, but they did very badly in the race, in part because of a shortage of preparation time for what was an unknown entity to Deutsch and Bonnet. In either case, DB proceeded to focus on Panhard designs exclusively.

==Road cars==
The 1949 DB8 was bodied by Antem of Belgium and shown at the 1949 Paris Salon. While a handsome (winning two concours d&#x27;élegances) and modern design, Citroën refused to allow the provision of parts for series production. After DB began to depend on Panhard for engines, Antem was again commissioned to make a cabriolet with the intent to build a small series of street cars. long, the car weighed and used the Dyna&#x27;s 750 cc flat-two and much of the suspension and drivetrain. As with most DBs, it had a central frame with two outliers. An 850 cc version was also offered, a model which could reach 140 rather than the 125–130 km/h of the smaller one. Naturally, Panhard developed a racing &quot;barquette&quot; version (called the Tank) of the Antem cabriolet. These competed at Le Mans 1951 as well as several other races. About twenty Antem cabriolets were built in 1951, but DB chose to let it die in favor of a coupé version of the same (&quot;Coach&quot; in French). A few DB-Antem Coach were built, mostly for competition. These had bodywork designed by Deutsch, and again mainly relied on Dyna underpinnings and a central steel-tube frame.

The steel-bodied, Frua-designed 1952 &quot;Mille Miles&quot; (celebrating class victories at the Mille Miglia) was a mini-GT with a 65 hp Panhard two-cylinder. It was somewhat expensive, and at the 1953 Paris Salon a Chausson-designed DB Coach in fibreglass, although it did not enter production until 1954. The HBR 4/5 model (1954–1959) was the partners&#x27; most successful project to date, with several hundred of the little cars produced between 1954 and 1959. This was followed by the Le Mans convertible and hardtop, which was shown in 1959 and built by DB until 1962, and continued until 1964 by René Bonnet. About 660 of the Mille Miles/Coach/HBR were built, and 232 DB Le Mans (not including the Bonnet-built cars). Later versions could be equipped with engines of 1 and 1.3 litres, and superchargers were also available. No two cars may have been alike, as they were built according to customer specifications from a wide range of options.

==More racing success==
Deutsch&#x27;s very efficient and influential aerodynamic designs allowed DB race cars to reach impressive top speeds despite the small Panhard flat-twin engine. DB&#x27;s received class victories at Le Mans (three times), Sebring (twice), and Mille Miglia (four times). DB even managed an outright win in the handicapped 1954 Tourist Trophy sports car race, with Laureau and Armagnac driving. DB always showed strongly in the &quot;Index of Performance&quot;, a category especially suitable for DB&#x27;s small-engined, aerodynamic little racers. The Index of Performance is perhaps best known at the Le Mans 24 hours competition, but the category also existed at many French automobile races of the era, such as the Tour de France. DBs were also successful in American SCCA racing, where they racked up an impressive number of victories in the H-sports category.

==Disagreement and the end of the partnership==
Deutsch and Bonnet disagreed whether they should build cars of front-wheel drive or mid-engined design. There was also disagreement on which engines to use. Charles Deutsch, wanting to stick to Panhard engines, left DB in 1961 to found his own firm (CD). Bonnet founded &quot;Automobiles René Bonnet&quot;, producing mid-engined cars equipped with Renault power units: this business was later to become part of Matra Automobiles. Deutsch ended up an engineering consultant.

<text>A weighting filter is used to emphasize or suppress some aspects of a phenomenon compared to others, for measurement or other purposes.

== Audio applications ==
In each field of audio measurement, special units are used to indicate a weighted measurement as opposed to a basic physical measurement of energy level. For sound, the unit is the phon (1 kHz equivalent level).

=== Sound ===
Sound has three basic components, the wavelength, frequency, and speed. In sound measurement, we measure the loudness of the sound in decibels (dB). Decibels are logarithmic with 0 dB as the reference. There are also a range of frequencies that sounds can have. Frequency is the number of times a sine wave repeats itself in a second. Normal auditory systems can usually hear between 20 and 20,000 Hz. When we measure sound, the measurement instrument takes the incoming auditory signal and analyzes it for these different features. Weighting filters in these instruments then filter out certain frequencies and decibel levels depending on the filter. A weighted filters are most similar to natural human hearing. This allows the sound level meter to determine what decibel level the incoming sound would likely be for a normal hearing human&#x27;s auditory system.

=== Loudness measurements ===
In the measurement of loudness, for example, an A-weighting filter is commonly used to emphasize frequencies around 3–6 kHz where the human ear is most sensitive, while attenuating very high and very low frequencies to which the ear is insensitive. The aim is to ensure that measured loudness corresponds well with subjectively perceived loudness.
A-weighting is only really valid for relatively quiet sounds and for pure tones as it is based on the 40-phon Fletcher–Munson equal-loudness contour. The B and C curves were intended for louder sounds (though they are less used) while the D curve is used in assessing loud aircraft noise (IEC 537). B curves filter out more medium loudness levels when compared to an A curves. This curve is rarely ever used in the assessment or monitoring of noise levels anymore. C curves differ from both A and B in the fact that they filter less of the lower and higher frequencies. The filter is a much flatter shape and is used in sound measurement in especially loud and noisy environments. A weighted curves follow a 40 phon curve while C weighted follows a 100 phon curve. The three curves differ not in their measurement of exposure levels, but in the frequencies measured. A weighted curves allow more frequencies equal to or less than 500 Hz through, which is most representative of the human ear.

=== Loudness measurements with weighting filters ===
There are a variety of reasons for measuring sound. This includes following regulations to protect worker&#x27;s hearing, following noise ordinances, in telecommunications, and many more. At the basis of sound measurement is the idea of breaking down an incoming signal based on its different properties. Every incoming sinusoidal wave of sound has a frequency and amplitude. Using this information, a sound level can be deduced from the root-sums-of-squares of the amplitudes of all the incoming auditory information. Whether using a sound level meter or a noise dosimeter, the processing is somewhat similar. With a calibrated sound level meter, the incoming sounds are going to be picked up by the microphone and then measured by the internal electronic circuits. The sound measurement that the device outputs can be filtered through an A, B, or C weighting curve. The curve used will have slight effects on the resulting decibel level.

=== Telecommunications ===
In the field of telecommunications, weighting filters are widely used in the measurement of electrical noise on telephone circuits, and in the assessment of noise as perceived through the acoustic response of different types of instrument (handset). Other noise-weighting curves have existed, e.g. DIN standards. The term &quot;psophometric weighting&quot;, though referring in principle to any weighting curve intended for noise measurement, is often used to refer to a particular weighting curve, used in telephony for narrow-bandwidth voiceband speech circuits.

=== Environmental noise measurement ===
A-weighted decibels are abbreviated dB(A) or dBA. When acoustic (calibrated microphone) measurements are being referred to, then the units used will be dB SPL (sound pressure level) referenced to 20 micropascals = 0 dB SPL.

The A-weighting curve has been widely adopted for environmental noise measurement, and is standard in many sound level meters (see ITU-R 468 weighting for a further explanation).

A-weighting is also in common use for assessing potential hearing damage caused by loud noise, though this seems to be based on the widespread availability of sound level meters incorporating A-Weighting rather than on any good experimental evidence to suggest that such use is valid. The distance of the measuring microphone from a sound source is often &quot;forgotten&quot;, when SPL measurements are quoted, making the data useless. In the case of environmental or aircraft noise, distance need not be quoted as it is the level at the point of measurement that is needed, but when measuring refrigerators and similar appliances the distance should be stated; where not stated it is usually one metre (1 m). An extra complication here is the effect of a reverberant room, and so noise measurement on appliances should state &quot;at 1 m in an open field&quot; or &quot;at 1 m in anechoic chamber&quot;. Measurements made outdoors will approximate well to anechoic conditions.

A-weighted SPL measurements of noise level are increasingly to be found on sales literature for domestic appliances such as refrigerators and freezers, and computer fans. Although the threshold of hearing is typically around 0 dB SPL, this is in fact very quiet indeed, and appliances are more likely to have noise levels of 30 to 40 dB SPL.

=== Audio reproduction and broadcasting equipment ===

Human sensitivity to noise in the region of 6 kHz became particularly apparent in the late 1960s with the introduction of compact cassette recorders and Dolby-B noise reduction. A-weighted noise measurements were found to give misleading results because they did not give sufficient prominence to the 6 kHz region where the noise reduction was having greatest effect, and sometimes one piece of equipment would even measure worse than another and yet sound better, because of differing spectral content.

ITU-R 468 noise weighting was therefore developed to more accurately reflect the subjective loudness of all types of noise, as opposed to tones. This curve, which came out of work done by the BBC Research Department, and was standardised by the CCIR and later adopted by many other standards bodies (IEC, BSI/) and, , is maintained by the ITU. Noise measurements using this weighting typically also use a quasi-peak detector law rather than slow averaging. This also helps to quantify the audibility of bursty noise, ticks and pops that might go undetected with a slow rms measurement.

ITU-R 468 noise weighting with quasi-peak detection is widely used in Europe, especially in telecommunications, and in broadcasting particularly after it was adopted by the Dolby corporation who realised its superior validity for their purposes. Its advantages over A-weighting seem to be less well appreciated in the US and in consumer electronics, where the use of A-weighting predominates—probably because A-weighting produces a 9 to 12 dB &quot;better&quot; specification, see specsmanship. It is commonly used by broadcasters in Britain, Europe, and former countries of the British Empire such as Australia and South Africa.

Though the noise level of 16-bit audio systems (such as CD players) is commonly quoted (on the basis of calculations that take no account of subjective effect) as −96 dB relative to FS (full scale), the best 468-weighted results are in the region of −68 dB relative to Alignment Level (commonly defined as 18 dB below FS) i.e. −86 dB relative to FS.

The use of weighting curves is in no way to be regarded as &#x27;cheating&#x27;, provided that the proper curve is used. Nothing of relevance is being &#x27;hidden&#x27;, and even when, for example, hum is present at 50 or 100 Hz at a level above the quoted (weighted) noise floor this is of no importance because our ears are very insensitive to low frequencies at low levels, so it will not be heard. A-weighting is often used to compare and qualify ADCs, for instance, because it more accurately represents the way noise shaping hides dither noise in the ultrasonic range.

== Other applications of weighting ==
In the measurement of gamma rays or other ionising radiation, a radiation monitor or dosimeter will commonly use a filter to attenuate those energy levels or wavelengths that cause the least damage to the human body, while letting through those that do the most damage, so that any source of radiation may be measured in terms of its true danger rather than just its &#x27;strength&#x27;. The sievert is a unit of weighted radiation dose for ionising radiation, which supersedes the older unit the REM (roentgen equivalent man).

Weighting is also applied to the measurement of sunlight when assessing the risk of skin damage through sunburn, since different wavelengths have different biological effects. Common examples are the SPF of sunscreen, and the UV index.

Another use of weighting is in television, where the red, green and blue components of the signal are weighted according to their perceived brightness. This ensures compatibility with black and white receivers, and also benefits noise performance and allows separation into meaningful luminance and chrominance signals for transmission.

<text>dBm or dBmW (decibel-milliwatts) is a unit of power level expressed using a logarithmic decibel (dB) scale respective to one milliwatt (mW). It is commonly used by radio, microwave and fiber-optical communication technicians &amp; engineers to measure the power of system transmissions on a log scale, which can express both very large and very small values in a short form. dBW is a similar unit measured relative to one watt (1,000 mW), rather than a milliwatt.

The decibel (dB) is a dimensionless unit, used for quantifying the ratio between two values, such as signal-to-noise ratio. The dBm is also dimensionless, but since it compares to a fixed reference value, the dBm rating is an absolute one.

The dBm is not a part of the International System of Units (SI) and therefore is discouraged from use in documents or systems that adhere to SI units. (The corresponding SI unit is the watt.) However, the unit decibel (dB), without the &#x27;m&#x27; suffix, is permitted for relative quantities, but not accepted for use directly alongside SI units. Ten decibel-milliwatts may be written 10 dB (1 mW) in SI.

In audio and telephony, dBm is typically referenced relative to the 600-ohm impedance commonly used in telephone voice networks, while in radio-frequency work dBm is typically referenced relative to a 50-ohm impedance.

==Unit conversions==
A power level of 0 dBm corresponds to a power of 1 milliwatt. A 10 dB increase in level is equivalent to a ten-fold increase in power. Therefore, a 20 dB increase in level is equivalent to a 100-fold increase in power. A 3 dB increase in level is approximately equivalent to doubling the power, which means that a level of 3 dBm corresponds roughly to a power of 2 mW. Similarly, for each 3 dB decrease in level, the power is reduced by about one half, making −3 dBm correspond to a power of about 0.5 mW.

To express an arbitrary power in mW as in dBm, the following expression may be used:
formula_1
Conversely, to express an arbitrary power level in dBm, as in mW:
formula_2

== Table of examples ==
Below is a table summarizing useful cases:


== Standards ==
The signal intensity (power per unit area) can be converted to received signal power by multiplying by the square of the wavelength and dividing by 4 (see Free-space path loss).

In United States Department of Defense practice, unweighted measurement is normally understood, applicable to a certain bandwidth, which must be stated or implied.

In European practice, psophometric weighting may be, as indicated by context, equivalent to dBm0p, which is preferred.

In audio, 0 dBm often corresponds to approximately 0.775 volts, since 0.775 V dissipates 1 mW in a 600 Ω load. The corresponding voltage level is 0 dBu, without the 600 Ω restriction. Conversely, for RF situations with a 50 Ω load, 0 dBm corresponds to approximately 0.224 volts, since 0.224 V dissipates 1 mW in a 50 Ω load.

In general the relationship between the power level in dBm and the  voltage in volts across a load of resistance (typically used to terminate a transmission line with impedance ) is:
formula_3

Expression in dBm is typically used for optical and electrical power measurements, not for other types of power (such as thermal). A listing by power levels in watts is available that includes a variety of examples not necessarily related to electrical or optical power.

The dBm was first proposed as an industry standard in 1940.

<text>The symbol dBrn or dB(rn) is an abbreviation for [[decibels]] above [[reference noise]]. 

Weighted noise power in dB is referred to 1.0 picowatt. Thus, 0 dBrn = -90 dBm. Use of 144 line, 144-receiver, or C-message weighting, or flat weighting, can be indicated in parentheses.

With C-message weighting, a one-milliwatt, 1000 Hz tone will read +90 dBrn, but the same power as white noise, randomly distributed over a 3 kHz band will read approximately +88.5 dBrn, because of the frequency weighting. 

With 144 weightings, a one milliwatt, 1000 Hz white noise tone will also read +90 dBrn, but the same 3 kHz power will only read +82 dBrn, because of the different frequency weighting.

Note: In telecommunications, &quot;dBrn adjusted&quot; also called dBa denotes &quot;decibels adjusted&quot;, i.e. weighted absolute noise power. This is totally unrelated to and not a synonym for dB(A).

<text>A data circuit-terminating equipment (DCE) is a device that sits between the data terminal equipment (DTE) and a data transmission circuit. It is also called data communication(s) equipment and data carrier equipment. Usually, the DTE device is the terminal (or computer), and the DCE is a modem.

In a &quot;data station&quot;, the DCE performs functions such as signal conversion, coding, and line clocking and may be a part of the DTE or intermediate equipment. Interfacing equipment may be required to couple the DTE into a transmission circuit or channel and from a transmission circuit or channel into the DTE.

==Usage==
Although the terms are most commonly used with RS-232, several data communication standards define different types of interfaces between a DCE and a DTE. The DCE is a device that communicates with a DTE device in these standards. Standards that use this nomenclature include:
* Federal Standard 1037C, MIL-STD-188
* RS-232
* Certain ITU-T standards in the V series (notably V.24 and V.35)
* Certain ITU-T standards in the X series (notably X.21 and X.25)

A general rule is that DCE devices provide the clock signal (internal clocking) and the DTE device synchronizes on the provided clock (external clocking). D-sub connectors follow another rule for pin assignment. DTE devices usually transmit on pin connector number 2 and receive on pin connector number 3. DCE devices are just the opposite: pin connector number 2 receives and pin connector number 3 transmits the signals.

When two devices, that are both DTE or both DCE, must be connected together without a modem or a similar media translator between them, a crossover cable must be used, e.g. a null modem for RS-232 or an Ethernet crossover cable/body

<text>The degree of isochronous distortion, in data transmission, is the ratio of the absolute value of the maximum measured difference between the actual and the theoretical intervals separating any two significant instants of modulation (or demodulation), to the unit interval. These instants are not necessarily consecutive. This value is usually expressed as a percentage.

The result of the measurement should be qualified by an indication if the period, usually limited, of the observation. For a prolonged modulation (or demodulation), it will be appropriate to consider the probability that an assigned value of the degree of distortion will be exceeded.

<doc id="41015" wikidata="Q163461" url="?curid=41015" title="Delta modulation">
<text>Delta modulation (DM, ΔM, or Δ-modulation) is an analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog signal conversion technique used for transmission of voice information where quality is not of primary importance. DM is the simplest form of differential pulse-code modulation (DPCM) where the difference between successive samples is encoded into n-bit data streams. In delta modulation, the transmitted data are reduced to a 1-bit data stream representing either up (↗) or down (↘). Its main features are:

* The analog signal is approximated with a series of segments.
* Each segment of the approximated signal is compared to the preceding bits and the successive bits are determined by this comparison.
* Only the change of information is sent, that is, only an increase or decrease of the signal amplitude from the previous sample is sent whereas a no-change condition causes the modulated signal to remain at the same ↗ or ↘ state of the previous sample.

To achieve high signal-to-noise ratio, delta modulation must use oversampling techniques, that is, the analog signal is sampled at a rate several times higher than the Nyquist rate.

Derived forms of delta modulation are continuously variable slope delta modulation, delta-sigma modulation, and differential modulation. Differential pulse-code modulation is the superset of DM.

==Principle==
Rather than quantizing the value of the input analog waveform, delta modulation quantizes the difference between the input signal and the integral of all previous quantization steps. This quantized signal effectively represents the derivative of the input signal, so the original signal is recovered by integration, as shown in the block diagram in Fig. 2:

In its simplest form, the quantizer can be realized with a comparator referenced to 0 (a two-level quantizer), whose output is &quot;1&quot; or &quot;-1&quot; depending on whether the quantizer&#x27;s input is positive or negative. The demodulator contains an integrator (just like the one in the feedback loop) whose output rises or falls with each 1 or -1 received. An optional low-pass filter will remove high frequency zigzags (see the blue output signal of Fig. 1), so only frequencies in the band of interest remain, to recover a smooth cleaned version of the original signal.

Because each sample is only 1 bit, the transmission bit rate equals the sampling rate.

==Transfer characteristics==

The two sources of noise in delta modulation are &quot;slope overload&quot;, when step size is too small to track the original waveform, and &quot;granularity&quot;, when step size is too large. But a 1971 study shows that slope overload is less objectionable compared to granularity than one might expect based solely on SNR measures.

=== Slope overload ===
In delta modulation, there is no limit to the number of pulses of the same sign that may occur, so it is capable of tracking signals of any amplitude without clipping provided that the signal doesn&#x27;t change too rapidly. However, if an input signal formula_1 has a derivative formula_2 larger thanformula_3,where formula_4 is the sampling frequency and formula_5 is the quantization step size, then the signal changes too fast, causing slope overload. For example, if the input signal is a cosine wave with frequency formula_6 and amplitude formula_7,

:formula_8,

then its derivative,

:formula_9,

can be as large as

:formula_10.

Thus, slope overload won&#x27;t occur for a sinusoidal input if

:formula_11.

Consequently, a sinusoidal signal can be transmitted without slope overload if its amplitude is not bigger than

:formula_12.

A real input signal may be more complex than a single sinusoid, but this example illustrates how a transmitted signal may be attenuated depending on the sampling frequency, step size, and the input signal&#x27;s frequency.

While slope overload (also referred to as slope clipping) can be avoided by increasing the quantum step size or sampling rate, very high sampling rates, typically 20 times the highest frequency of interest, are required to achieve the same quality as pulse-code modulation (PCM).

=== Inability to transmit DC ===
Because the modulated signal contains only the derivative of the input, any DC and low-frequency content of the signal is lost (which may be ok for voice and other applications which do not have low frequencies), transmission errors are accumulated, and high-frequency noise is amplified. An improvement to DM called delta-sigma modulation avoids these downsides by rearranging the integrator&#x27;s position so that the modulated signal represents the amplitude of the input signal instead of just its derivative.

== History ==
The seminal paper combining feedback with oversampling to achieve delta modulation was by F. de Jager of Philips Research Laboratories in 1952. Initial patents include:

* &quot;Communication system utilizing constant amplitude pulses of opposite polarities&quot; by Maurice Deloraine et. al. (French patent issued 1946, US patent filed 1947).
* &quot;Differential quantization of communication signals&quot; by C. Chapin Cutler (filed 1950), which describes differential PCM and delta modulation (1-bit DPCM).

== Asynchronous delta modulation ==
The 1947 Deloraine, 1950 Cutler, and 1952 Jager designs were synchronous (or time-quantized). Delta modulation is also possible without a fixed sampling rate. A February 1966 paper by H. Inose &quot;Asynchronous delta-modulation system&quot; uses Schmitt triggers to detect when the input signal exceeds the local demodulator by a predetermined difference, with the benefit of reducing the number of output pulses. A November 1973 paper &quot;Signal Coding Using Asynchronous Delta Modulation&quot; (presented in 1974) investigates an algorithm that varies the sampling rate to transmit fewer samples during periods of small signal variation.

== Adaptive delta modulation ==
Adaptive delta modulation (ADM) was first published by Dr. John E. Abate (Bell Labs Fellow) in his doctoral thesis at NJ Institute Of Technology in 1968. ADM was later selected as the standard for all NASA communications between mission control and space-craft.

In the mid-1980s, Massachusetts audio company DBX marketed a commercially unsuccessful digital recording system based on adaptive delta modulation. See DBX 700.

Adaptive delta modulation or Continuously variable slope delta modulation (CVSD) is a modification of DM in which the step size is not fixed. Rather, when several consecutive bits have the same direction value, the encoder and decoder assume that slope overload is occurring, and the step size becomes progressively larger.

Otherwise, the step size becomes gradually smaller over time. ADM reduces slope error, at the expense of increasing quantization error. This error can be reduced by using a low-pass filter. ADM provides robust performance in the presence of bit errors meaning error detection and correction are not typically used in an ADM radio design, it is this very useful technique that allows for adaptive-delta-modulation.

==Applications==

=== Video game sound effects ===
The Nintendo Entertainment System&#x27;s audio processing unit (the Ricoh 2A03 chip) includes a Delta Modulation Channel (DMC) to demodulate percussion and sound effects. The DMC reads delta-encoded audio data via direct memory access into a shift register, which gets shifted out serially into an up/down counter acting as the demodulator&#x27;s integrator. Because the shift register is clocked by a configurable timer, the audio&#x27;s frequency can be shifted by adjusting the playback speed. The counter&#x27;s value is outputted though a 7-bit digital-to-analog converter (DAC). Note: writing PCM samples directly to the counter bypasses the DM demodulation to instead provide low-bit PCM output.

=== Satellite Business Systems 24 kbps delta modulation ===

Delta modulation was used by Satellite Business Systems (SBS) for its voice ports to provide long distance phone service to large domestic corporations with a significant inter-corporation communications need (such as IBM). Each traffic channel had a 32 kbit/s bitrate. This system was in service throughout the 1980s. The voice ports used digitally implemented 24 kbit/s delta modulation with Voice Activity Compression (VAC) and echo suppressors to control the half second echo path through the satellite. They performed formal listening tests to verify the 24 kbit/s delta modulator achieved full voice quality with no discernible degradation as compared to a high quality phone line or the standard 64 kbit/s μ-law companded PCM. This provided an eight to three improvement in satellite channel capacity. IBM developed the Satellite Communications Controller and the voice port functions.

The original proposal in 1974, used a state-of-the-art 24 kbit/s delta modulator with a single integrator and a &quot;Shindler Compander&quot; modified for gain error recovery. This proved to have less than full phone line speech quality. In 1977, one engineer with two assistants in the IBM Research Triangle Park, NC laboratory was assigned to improve the quality.

The final implementation replaced the integrator with a predictor implemented with a two pole complex pair low-pass filter designed to approximate the long term average speech spectrum. The theory was that ideally the integrator should be a predictor designed to match the signal spectrum. A nearly perfect Shindler Compander replaced the modified version. It was found the modified compander resulted in a less than perfect step size at most signal levels and the fast gain error recovery increased the noise as determined by actual listening tests as compared to simple signal to noise measurements. The final compander achieved a very mild gain error recovery due to the natural truncation rounding error caused by twelve bit arithmetic.

The complete function of delta modulation, VAC and Echo Control for six ports was implemented in a single digital integrated circuit chip with twelve bit arithmetic. A single digital-to-analog converter (DAC) was shared by all six ports providing voltage compare functions for the modulators and feeding sample and hold circuits for the demodulator outputs. A single card held the chip, DAC and all the analog circuits for the phone line interface including transformers.

<text>In telecommunications, a demand assignment is a method which several users share access to a communication channel on a real-time basis, &quot;i.e.&quot;, a user needing to communicate with another user on the same network requests the required circuit, uses it, and when the call is finished, the circuit is released, making the circuit available to other users. 

Demand assignment is similar to conventional telephone switching, in which common trunks are provided for many users, on a demand basis, through a limited-size trunk group.

<doc id="41017" wikidata="Q5255037" url="?curid=41017" title="Demand factor">
<text>In telecommunications, electronics and the electrical power industry, the term demand factor is used to refer to the fractional amount of some quantity being used relative to the maximum amount that could be used by the same system. The demand factor is always less than or equal to one. As the amount of demand is a time dependent quantity so is the demand factor.

: formula_1

The demand factor is often implicitly averaged over time when the time period of demand is understood by the context.

== Electrical engineering ==

In electrical engineering the demand factor is taken as a time independent quantity where the numerator is taken as the maximum demand in the specified time period instead of the averaged or instantaneous demand.

: formula_2

This is the peak in the load profile divided by the full load of the device.

Example:
If a residence has equipment which could draw 6,000 W when all equipment was drawing a full load, drew a maximum of 3,000 W in a specified time, then the demand factor = 3,000 W / 6,000 W = 0.5

This quantity is relevant when trying to establish the amount of load for which a system should be rated. In the above example, it would be unlikely that the system would be rated to 6,000 W, even though there may be a slight possibility that this amount of power can be drawn. This is closely related to the load factor which is the average load divided by the peak load in a specified time period.

<text>In communications systems, a design objective (DO) is a desired performance characteristic for communications circuits and equipment that is based on engineering analyses, but (a) is not considered feasible to mandate in a standard, or (b) has not been tested. 

DOs are used because applicable systems standards are not in existence. 

Examples of reasons for designating a performance characteristic as a DO rather than as a standard are (a) it may be bordering on an advancement in the state of the art, (b) the requirement may not have been fully confirmed by measurement or experience with operating circuits, and (c) it may not have been demonstrated that the requirement can be met considering other constraints, such as cost and size. 

A DO is sometimes established in a standard for developmental consideration. A DO may also specify a performance characteristic used in the preparation of specifications for development or procurement of new equipment or systems.

Design is the process of formulation of a plan for satisfaction of human needs

<doc id="41024" wikidata="Q206658" url="?curid=41024" title="Pulse dialing">
<text>Pulse dialing is a signaling technology in telecommunications in which a direct current local loop circuit is interrupted according to a defined coding system for each signal transmitted, usually a digit. This lends the method the often used name loop disconnect dialing. In the most common variant of pulse dialing, decadic dialing, each of the ten Arabic numerals are encoded in a sequence of up to ten pulses. The most common version decodes the digits 1 through 9, as one to nine pulses, respectively, and the digit 0 as ten pulses. Historically, the most common device to produce such pulse trains is the rotary dial of the telephone, lending the technology another name, rotary dialing.

The pulse repetition rate was historically determined based on the response time needed for electromechanical switching systems to operate reliably. Most telephone systems used the nominal rate of ten pulses per second, but operator dialing within and between central offices often used pulse rates up to twenty per second.

==Early automatic exchanges==
Automatic telephone exchange systems were developed in the late 19th and early 20th century. For identification, telephone subscribers were assigned a telephone number unique to each circuit. Various methods evolved to signal the desired destination telephone number for a telephone call directly dialed by the subscriber. An automatic switch-hook was designed by Hilborne Roosevelt.

The first commercial automatic telephone exchange, designed by Almon Brown Strowger, opened in La Porte, Indiana on 3 November 1892, and used two telegraph-type keys on the telephone, which had to be operated the correct number of times to control the vertical and horizontal relay magnets in the exchange. But the use of separate keys with separate conductors to the exchange was not practical. The most common signaling system became a system of using direct-current pulse trains generated in the telephone sets of subscribers by interrupting the single-pair wire loop of the telephone circuit.

==Rotary dial==
Strowger also filed the first patent for a rotary dial in 1891. The first dials worked by direct, forward action. The pulses were sent as the user rotated the dial to the finger stop starting at a different position for each digit transmitted. Operating the dial error-free required smooth rotary motion of the finger wheel by the user, but was found as too unreliable. This mechanism was soon refined to include a recoil spring and a centrifugal governor to control the recoil speed. The user selected a digit to be dialed by inserting a finger into the corresponding hole and rotated the dial to the finger stop. When released from this position, the dial pulsing contacts were opened and closed repeatedly, thus interrupting the loop current in a pattern on the return to the home position. The exchange switch decoded the pattern for each digit thus transmitted by stepping relays or by accumulation in digit registers.

==Pulse rate and coding==

In the first electromechanical switching systems, the current pulses generated by the rotary dial on the local loop directly operated electrical stepping switches at the central office. The mechanical nature of these relays generally limited the speed of operation, the pulsing rate, to ten pulses per second.

The specifications of the Bell System in the US required service personnel to adjust dials in customer stations to a precision of 9.5 to 10.5 pulses per second (PPS), but the tolerance of the switching equipment was generally between 8 and 11 PPS. The British (GPO, later Post Office Telecommunications) standard for Strowger switch exchanges has been ten impulses per second (allowable range 7 to 12) and a 66% break ratio (allowable range 63% to 72%).

In most switching systems one pulse is used for the digit 1, two pulses for 2, and so on, with ten pulses for the digit 0; this makes the code unary, excepting the digit 0. Exceptions to this are Sweden, with one pulse for 0, two pulses for 1, and so on, and New Zealand, with ten pulses for 0, nine pulses for 1, etc. Oslo, the capital city of Norway, used the New Zealand system, but the rest of the country did not. Systems that used this encoding of the ten digits in a sequence of up to ten pulses are known as &quot;decadic dialing&quot; systems.

Some switching systems used digit registers that doubled the allowable pulse rate up to twenty pulses per second, and the inter-digital pause could be reduced as the switch selection did not have to be completed during the pause. These included access lines to the panel switch in the 1920s, crossbar systems, the later version (7A2) of the rotary system, and the earlier 1970s stored program control exchanges.

In some telephones, the pulses may be heard in the receiver as clicking sounds. However, in general, such effects were undesirable and telephone designers suppressed them by mechanical means with off-normal switches on the dial, or greatly attenuated them by electrical means with a varistor connected across the receiver.

==Switch-hook dialing==

As pulse dialing is achieved by interruption of the local loop, it was possible to dial digits by rapidly tapping, i.e. depressing, the switch hook the corresponding number of times at approximately ten taps per second. However, many telephone makers implemented a slow switch hook release to prevent rapid switching.

In the United Kingdom, it was once possible to make calls from coin-box phones by tapping the switch hook without depositing coins. Unlawfully obtaining a free telephone call was deemed a criminal offence, abstracting electricity from the General Post Office, which operated the telephone system, and several cases were prosecuted.

In popular culture, tapping was shown in the film &quot;Red Dragon&quot; when prisoner Hannibal Lecter dialed out on a telephone without dialing mechanism. The technique was also used by the character Phantom Phreak in the film &quot;Hackers&quot;.

==Successors==
It was recognized as early as the 1910s that push button dialing was faster than with rotary dials, when the first panel switches used keys for dialing at the operator stations. In the 1940s, Bell Laboratories conducted field trials of pushbutton telephones for customer dialing to determine accuracy and efficiency. However, the technology of using mechanical reed relays was too unreliable until transistors transformed the industry. In 1963, the Bell System introduced to the public dual-tone multi-frequency (DTMF) technology under the name Touch-Tone, which was a trademark in the U.S. until 1984. The Touch-Tone system used push-button telephones. In the decades after 1963, rotary dials were gradually phased out on new telephone models in favor of keypads and the primary dialing method to the central office became touchtone dialing. Most central office systems still support rotary telephones today. Some keypad telephones have a switch or configuration method for the selection of tone or pulse dialing.

Mobile telephones and most voice-over-IP systems use out-of-band signaling and do not send any digits until the entire number has been keyed by the user. Many VoIP systems are based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), which uses a form of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI) for addressing, instead of digits alone.

<text>In electromagnetism, a dielectric (or dielectric medium) is an electrical insulator that can be polarised by an applied electric field. When a dielectric material is placed in an electric field, electric charges do not flow through the material as they do in an electrical conductor, because they have no loosely bound, or free, electrons that may drift through the material, but instead they shift, only slightly, from their average equilibrium positions, causing dielectric polarisation. Because of dielectric polarisation, positive charges are displaced in the direction of the field and negative charges shift in the direction opposite to the field. This creates an internal electric field that reduces the overall field within the dielectric itself. If a dielectric is composed of weakly bonded molecules, those molecules not only become polarised, but also reorient so that their symmetry axes align to the field.

The study of dielectric properties concerns storage and dissipation of electric and magnetic energy in materials. Dielectrics are important for explaining various phenomena in electronics, optics, solid-state physics and cell biophysics.

==Terminology==
Although the term &quot;insulator&quot; implies low electrical conduction, &quot;dielectric&quot; typically means materials with a high polarisability. The latter is expressed by a number called the relative permittivity. &quot;Insulator&quot; is generally used to indicate electrical obstruction while &quot;dielectric&quot; is used to indicate the energy storing capacity of the material (by means of polarisation). A common example of a dielectric is the electrically insulating material between the metallic plates of a capacitor. The polarisation of the dielectric by the applied electric field increases the capacitor&#x27;s surface charge for the given electric field strength.

The term &quot;dielectric&quot; was coined by William Whewell (from &quot;&quot; + &quot;electric&quot;) in response to a request from Michael Faraday.

A &quot;perfect dielectric&quot; is a material with zero electrical conductivity (cf. perfect conductor infinite electrical conductivity), thus exhibiting only a displacement current; therefore it stores and returns electrical energy as if it were an ideal capacitor.

==Electric susceptibility==
The electric susceptibility formula_1 of a dielectric material is a measure of how easily it polarises in response to an electric field. This, in turn, determines the electric permittivity of the material and thus influences many other phenomena in that medium, from the capacitance of capacitors to the speed of light.

It is defined as the constant of proportionality (which may be a tensor) relating an electric field formula_2 to the induced dielectric polarisation density formula_3 such that

formula_4

where formula_5 is the electric permittivity of free space.

The susceptibility of a medium is related to its relative permittivity formula_6 by

formula_7

So in the case of a classical vacuum,

formula_8

The electric displacement formula_9 is related to the polarisation density formula_3 by

formula_11

===Dispersion and causality===
In general, a material cannot polarise instantaneously in response to an applied field. The more general formulation as a function of time is

formula_12

That is, the polarisation is a convolution of the electric field at previous times with time-dependent susceptibility given by formula_13. The upper limit of this integral can be extended to infinity as well if one defines formula_14 for formula_15. An instantaneous response corresponds to Dirac delta function susceptibility formula_16 .

It is more convenient in a linear system to take the Fourier transform and write this relationship as a function of frequency. Due to the convolution theorem, the integral becomes a simple product,
formula_17

The susceptibility (or equivalently the permittivity) is frequency dependent. The change of susceptibility with respect to frequency characterises the dispersion properties of the material.

Moreover, the fact that the polarisation can only depend on the electric field at previous times (i.e., formula_14 for formula_15), a consequence of causality, imposes Kramers–Kronig constraints on the real and imaginary parts of the susceptibility formula_20.

==Dielectric polarisation==

===Basic atomic model===
In the classical approach to the dielectric, the material is made up of atoms. Each atom consists of a cloud of negative charge (electrons) bound to and surrounding a positive point charge at its center. In the presence of an electric field, the charge cloud is distorted, as shown in the top right of the figure.

This can be reduced to a simple dipole using the superposition principle. A dipole is characterised by its dipole moment, a vector quantity shown in the figure as the blue arrow labeled &quot;M&quot;. It is the relationship between the electric field and the dipole moment that gives rise to the behaviour of the dielectric. (Note that the dipole moment points in the same direction as the electric field in the figure. This is not always the case, and is a major simplification, but is true for many materials.)

When the electric field is removed, the atom returns to its original state. The time required to do so is called relaxation time; an exponential decay.

This is the essence of the model in physics. The behaviour of the dielectric now depends on the situation. The more complicated the situation, the richer the model must be to accurately describe the behaviour. Important questions are:
*Is the electric field constant, or does it vary with time? At what rate?
*Does the response depend on the direction of the applied field (isotropy of the material)?
*Is the response the same everywhere (homogeneity of the material)?
*Do any boundaries or interfaces have to be taken into account?
*Is the response linear with respect to the field, or are there nonlinearities?

The relationship between the electric field E and the dipole moment M gives rise to the behaviour of the dielectric, which, for a given material, can be characterised by the function F defined by the equation:
formula_21

When both the type of electric field and the type of material have been defined, one then chooses the simplest function &quot;F&quot; that correctly predicts the phenomena of interest. Examples of phenomena that can be so modelled include:

*Refractive index
*Group velocity dispersion
*Birefringence
*Self-focusing
*Harmonic generation

===Dipolar polarisation===
Dipolar polarisation is a polarisation that is either inherent to polar molecules (orientation polarisation), or can be induced in any molecule in which the asymmetric distortion of the nuclei is possible (distortion polarisation). Orientation polarisation results from a permanent dipole, e.g., that arises from the 104.45° angle between the asymmetric bonds between oxygen and hydrogen atoms in the water molecule, which retains polarisation in the absence of an external electric field. The assembly of these dipoles forms a macroscopic polarisation.

When an external electric field is applied, the distance between charges within each permanent dipole, which is related to chemical bonding, remains constant in orientation polarisation; however, the direction of polarisation itself rotates. This rotation occurs on a timescale that depends on the torque and surrounding local viscosity of the molecules. Because the rotation is not instantaneous, dipolar polarisations lose the response to electric fields at the highest frequencies. A molecule rotates about 1 radian per picosecond in a fluid, thus this loss occurs at about 1011 Hz (in the microwave region). The delay of the response to the change of the electric field causes friction and heat.

When an external electric field is applied at infrared frequencies or less, the molecules are bent and stretched by the field and the molecular dipole moment changes. The molecular vibration frequency is roughly the inverse of the time it takes for the molecules to bend, and this distortion polarisation disappears above the infrared.

===Ionic polarisation===
Ionic polarisation is polarisation caused by relative displacements between positive and negative ions in ionic crystals (for example, NaCl).

If a crystal or molecule consists of atoms of more than one kind, the distribution of charges around an atom in the crystal or molecule leans to positive or negative. As a result, when lattice vibrations or molecular vibrations induce relative displacements of the atoms, the centers of positive and negative charges are also displaced. The locations of these centers are affected by the symmetry of the displacements. When the centers do not correspond, polarisation arises in molecules or crystals. This polarisation is called ionic polarisation.

Ionic polarisation causes the ferroelectric effect as well as dipolar polarisation. The ferroelectric transition, which is caused by the lining up of the orientations of permanent dipoles along a particular direction, is called an order-disorder phase transition. The transition caused by ionic polarisations in crystals is called a displacive phase transition.

====In biological cells====
Ionic polarisation enables the production of energy-rich compounds in cells (the proton pump in mitochondria) and, at the plasma membrane, the establishment of the resting potential, energetically unfavourable transport of ions, and cell-to-cell communication (the Na+/K+-ATPase).

All cells in animal body tissues are electrically polarised – in other words, they maintain a voltage difference across the cell&#x27;s plasma membrane, known as the membrane potential. This electrical polarisation results from a complex interplay between ion transporters and ion channels.

In neurons, the types of ion channels in the membrane usually vary across different parts of the cell, giving the dendrites, axon, and cell body different electrical properties. As a result, some parts of the membrane of a neuron may be excitable (capable of generating action potentials), whereas others are not.

==Dielectric dispersion==
In physics, dielectric dispersion is the dependence of the permittivity of a dielectric material on the frequency of an applied electric field. Because there is a lag between changes in polarisation and changes in the electric field, the permittivity of the dielectric is a complex function of the frequency of the electric field. Dielectric dispersion is very important for the applications of dielectric materials and the analysis of polarisation systems.

This is one instance of a general phenomenon known as material dispersion: a frequency-dependent response of a medium for wave propagation.

When the frequency becomes higher:
# The dipolar polarisation can no longer follow the oscillations of the electric field in the microwave region around 1010 Hz,
# The ionic polarisation and molecular distortion polarisation can no longer track the electric field past the infrared or far-infrared region around 1013 Hz,
# The electronic polarisation loses its response in the ultraviolet region around 1015 Hz.

In the frequency region above ultraviolet, permittivity approaches the constant &quot;ε&quot;0 in every substance, where &quot;ε&quot;0 is the permittivity of the free space. Because permittivity indicates the strength of the relation between an electric field and polarisation, if a polarisation process loses its response, permittivity decreases.

==Dielectric relaxation==
Dielectric relaxation is the momentary delay (or lag) in the dielectric constant of a material. This is usually caused by the delay in molecular polarisation with respect to a changing electric field in a dielectric medium (e.g., inside capacitors or between two large conducting surfaces). Dielectric relaxation in changing electric fields could be considered analogous to hysteresis in changing magnetic fields (e.g., in inductor or transformer cores). Relaxation in general is a delay or lag in the response of a linear system, and therefore dielectric relaxation is measured relative to the expected linear steady state (equilibrium) dielectric values. The time lag between electrical field and polarisation implies an irreversible degradation of Gibbs free energy.

In physics, dielectric relaxation refers to the relaxation response of a dielectric medium to an external, oscillating electric field. This relaxation is often described in terms of permittivity as a function of frequency, which can, for ideal systems, be described by the Debye equation. On the other hand, the distortion related to ionic and electronic polarisation shows behaviour of the resonance or oscillator type. The character of the distortion process depends on the structure, composition, and surroundings of the sample.

===Debye relaxation===
Debye relaxation is the dielectric relaxation response of an ideal, noninteracting population of dipoles to an alternating external electric field. It is usually expressed in the complex permittivity &quot;ε&quot; of a medium as a function of the field&#x27;s angular frequency &quot;ω&quot;:

formula_22

where &quot;ε∞&quot; is the permittivity at the high frequency limit, where &quot;εs&quot; is the static, low frequency permittivity, and &quot;τ&quot; is the characteristic relaxation time of the medium. Separating into the real part formula_23 and the imaginary part formula_24 of the complex dielectric permittivity yields:

formula_25

Note that the above equation for formula_26 is sometimes written with formula_27 in the denominator due to an ongoing sign convention ambiguity whereby many sources represent the time dependence of the complex electric field with formula_28 whereas others use formula_29. In the former convention, the functions formula_23 and formula_24 representing real and imaginary parts are given by formula_32 whereas in the latter convention formula_33. The above equation uses the latter convention.

The dielectric loss is also represented by the loss tangent:

formula_34

This relaxation model was introduced by and named after the physicist Peter Debye (1913). It is characteristic for dynamic polarisation with only one relaxation time.

===Variants of the Debye equation===
;Cole–Cole equation: This equation is used when the dielectric loss peak shows symmetric broadening.
;Cole–Davidson equation: This equation is used when the dielectric loss peak shows asymmetric broadening.
;Havriliak–Negami relaxation: This equation considers both symmetric and asymmetric broadening.
;Kohlrausch–Williams–Watts function: Fourier transform of stretched exponential function.
;Curie–von Schweidler law: This shows the response of dielectrics to an applied DC field to behave according to a power law, which can be expressed as an integral over weighted exponential functions.
;Djordjevic–Sarkar approximation: This is used when the dielectric loss is approximately constant for a wide range of frequencies.

==Paraelectricity==
Paraelectricity is the nominal behaviour of dielectrics when the dielectric permittivity tensor is proportional to the unit matrix, i.e., an applied electric field causes polarisation and/or alignment of dipoles only parallel to the applied electric field. Contrary to the analogy with a paramagnetic material, no permanent electric dipole needs to exist in a paraelectric material. Removal of the fields results in the dipolar polarisation returning to zero. The mechanisms that causes paraelectric behaviour are distortion of individual ions (displacement of the electron cloud from the nucleus) and polarisation of molecules or combinations of ions or defects.

Paraelectricity can occur in crystal phases where electric dipoles are unaligned and thus have the potential to align in an external electric field and weaken it.

Most dielectric materials are paraelectrics. A specific example of a paraelectric material of high dielectric constant is strontium titanate.

The LiNbO3 crystal is ferroelectric below 1430 K, and above this temperature it transforms into a disordered paraelectric phase. Similarly, other perovskites also exhibit paraelectricity at high temperatures.

Paraelectricity has been explored as a possible refrigeration mechanism; polarising a paraelectric by applying an electric field under adiabatic process conditions raises the temperature, while removing the field lowers the temperature. A heat pump that operates by polarising the paraelectric, allowing it to return to ambient temperature (by dissipating the extra heat), bringing it into contact with the object to be cooled, and finally depolarising it, would result in refrigeration.

==Tunability==
&quot;Tunable dielectrics&quot; are insulators whose ability to store electrical charge changes when a voltage is applied.

Generally, strontium titanate () is used for devices operating at low temperatures, while barium strontium titanate () substitutes for room temperature devices. Other potential materials include microwave dielectrics and carbon nanotube (CNT) composites.

In 2013, multi-sheet layers of strontium titanate interleaved with single layers of strontium oxide produced a dielectric capable of operating at up to 125 GHz. The material was created via molecular beam epitaxy. The two have mismatched crystal spacing that produces strain within the strontium titanate layer that makes it less stable and tunable.

Systems such as have a paraelectric–ferroelectric transition just below ambient temperature, providing high tunability. Films suffer significant losses arising from defects.

==Applications==

===Capacitors===

Commercially manufactured capacitors typically use a solid dielectric material with high permittivity as the intervening medium between the stored positive and negative charges. This material is often referred to in technical contexts as the &quot;capacitor dielectric&quot;.

The most obvious advantage to using such a dielectric material is that it prevents the conducting plates, on which the charges are stored, from coming into direct electrical contact. More significantly, however, a high permittivity allows a greater stored charge at a given voltage. This can be seen by treating the case of a linear dielectric with permittivity &quot;ε&quot; and thickness &quot;d&quot; between two conducting plates with uniform charge density &quot;σε&quot;. In this case the charge density is given by

formula_35

and the capacitance per unit area by

formula_36

From this, it can easily be seen that a larger &quot;ε&quot; leads to greater charge stored and thus greater capacitance.

Dielectric materials used for capacitors are also chosen such that they are resistant to ionisation. This allows the capacitor to operate at higher voltages before the insulating dielectric ionises and begins to allow undesirable current.

===Dielectric resonator===
A &quot;dielectric resonator oscillator&quot; (DRO) is an electronic component that exhibits resonance of the polarisation response for a narrow range of frequencies, generally in the microwave band. It consists of a &quot;puck&quot; of ceramic that has a large dielectric constant and a low dissipation factor. Such resonators are often used to provide a frequency reference in an oscillator circuit. An unshielded dielectric resonator can be used as a dielectric resonator antenna (DRA).

===BST thin films===
From 2002 to 2004, the United States Army Research Laboratory (ARL) conducted research on thin film technology. Barium strontium titanate (BST), a ferroelectric thin film, was studied for the fabrication of radio frequency and microwave components, such as voltage-controlled oscillators, tunable filters and phase shifters.

The research was part of an effort to provide the Army with highly-tunable, microwave-compatible materials for broadband electric-field tunable devices, which operate consistently in extreme temperatures. This work improved tunability of bulk barium strontium titanate, which is a thin film enabler for electronics components.

In a 2004 research paper, U.S. ARL researchers explored how small concentrations of acceptor dopants can dramatically modify the properties of ferroelectric materials such as BST.

Researchers &quot;doped&quot; BST thin films with magnesium, analyzing the &quot;structure, microstructure, surface morphology and film/substrate compositional quality&quot; of the result. The Mg doped BST films showed &quot;improved dielectric properties, low leakage current, and good tunability&quot;, meriting potential for use in microwave tunable devices.

==Some practical dielectrics==
Dielectric materials can be solids, liquids, or gases. (A high vacuum can also be a useful, nearly lossless dielectric even though its relative dielectric constant is only unity.)

Solid dielectrics are perhaps the most commonly used dielectrics in electrical engineering, and many solids are very good insulators. Some examples include porcelain, glass, and most plastics. Air, nitrogen and sulfur hexafluoride are the three most commonly used gaseous dielectrics.
*Industrial coatings such as Parylene provide a dielectric barrier between the substrate and its environment.
*Mineral oil is used extensively inside electrical transformers as a fluid dielectric and to assist in cooling. Dielectric fluids with higher dielectric constants, such as electrical grade castor oil, are often used in high voltage capacitors to help prevent corona discharge and increase capacitance.
*Because dielectrics resist the flow of electricity, the surface of a dielectric may retain &quot;stranded&quot; excess electrical charges. This may occur accidentally when the dielectric is rubbed (the triboelectric effect). This can be useful, as in a Van de Graaff generator or electrophorus, or it can be potentially destructive as in the case of electrostatic discharge.
*Specially processed dielectrics, called electrets (which should not be confused with ferroelectrics), may retain excess internal charge or &quot;frozen in&quot; polarisation. Electrets have a semi-permanent electric field, and are the electrostatic equivalent to magnets. Electrets have numerous practical applications in the home and industry.
*Some dielectrics can generate a potential difference when subjected to mechanical stress, or (equivalently) change physical shape if an external voltage is applied across the material. This property is called piezoelectricity. Piezoelectric materials are another class of very useful dielectrics.
*Some ionic crystals and polymer dielectrics exhibit a spontaneous dipole moment, which can be reversed by an externally applied electric field. This behaviour is called the ferroelectric effect. These materials are analogous to the way ferromagnetic materials behave within an externally applied magnetic field. Ferroelectric materials often have very high dielectric constants, making them quite useful for capacitors.

<text>In physics, the term dielectric strength has the following meanings:

*for a pure electrically insulating material, the maximum electric field that the material can withstand under ideal conditions without undergoing electrical breakdown and becoming electrically conductive (i.e. without failure of its insulating properties).
*For a specific piece of dielectric material and location of electrodes, the minimum applied electric field (i.e. the applied voltage divided by electrode separation distance) that results in breakdown. This is the concept of breakdown voltage.

The theoretical dielectric strength of a material is an intrinsic property of the bulk material, and is independent of the configuration of the material or the electrodes with which the field is applied. This &quot;intrinsic dielectric strength&quot; corresponds to what would be measured using pure materials under ideal laboratory conditions. At breakdown, the electric field frees bound electrons. If the applied electric field is sufficiently high, free electrons from background radiation may be accelerated to velocities that can liberate additional electrons by collisions with neutral atoms or molecules, in a process known as avalanche breakdown. Breakdown occurs quite abruptly (typically in nanoseconds), resulting in the formation of an electrically conductive path and a disruptive discharge through the material. In a solid material, a breakdown event severely degrades, or even destroys, its insulating capability.

==Electrical breakdown==
Electric current is a flow of electrically charged particles in a material caused by an electric field. The mobile charged particles responsible for electric current are called charge carriers. In different substances different particles serve as charge carriers: in metals and other solids some of the outer electrons of each atom (conduction electrons) are able to move about the material; in electrolytes and plasma it is ions, electrically charged atoms or molecules, and electrons. A substance that has a high concentration of charge carriers available for conduction will conduct a large current with the given electric field created by a given voltage applied across it, and thus has a low electrical resistivity; this is called an electrical conductor. A material that has few charge carriers will conduct very little current with a given electric field and has a high resistivity; this is called an electrical insulator.

However, when a large enough electric field is applied to any insulating substance, at a certain field strength the concentration of charge carriers in the material suddenly increases by many orders of magnitude, so its resistance drops and it becomes a conductor. This is called &quot;electrical breakdown&quot;. The physical mechanism causing breakdown differs in different substances. In a solid, it usually occurs when the electric field becomes strong enough to pull outer valence electrons away from their atoms, so they become mobile. The field strength at which break down occurs is an intrinsic property of the material called its &quot;dielectric strength&quot;.

In practical electric circuits electrical breakdown is often an unwanted occurrence, a failure of insulating material causing a short circuit, resulting in a catastrophic failure of the equipment. The sudden drop in resistance causes a high current to flow through the material, and the sudden extreme Joule heating may cause the material or other parts of the circuit to melt or vaporize explosively. However, breakdown itself is reversible. If the current supplied by the external circuit is sufficiently limited, no damage is done to the material, and reducing the applied voltage causes a transition back to the material&#x27;s insulating state.

==Factors affecting apparent dielectric strength==

*It may vary with sample thickness. (see &quot;defects&quot; below)
*It may vary with operating temperature.
*It may vary with frequency.
*For gases (e.g. nitrogen, sulfur hexafluoride) it normally decreases with increased humidity as ions in water can provide conductive channels.
*For gases it increases with pressure according to Paschen&#x27;s law
*For air, dielectric strength increases slightly as the absolute humidity increases but decreases with an increase in relative humidity

== Break down field strength ==

The field strength at which break down occurs depends on the respective geometries of the dielectric (insulator) and the electrodes with which the electric field is applied, as well as the rate of increase of the applied electric field. Because dielectric materials usually contain minute defects, the practical dielectric strength will be a significantly less than the intrinsic dielectric strength of an ideal, defect-free, material. Dielectric films tend to exhibit greater dielectric strength than thicker samples of the same material. For instance, the dielectric strength of silicon dioxide films of thickness around 1 μm is about 0.5GV/m. However very thin layers (below, say, ) become partially conductive because of electron tunneling. Multiple layers of thin dielectric films are used where maximum practical dielectric strength is required, such as high voltage capacitors and pulse transformers. Since the dielectric strength of gases varies depending on the shape and configuration of the electrodes, it is usually measured as a fraction of the dielectric strength of nitrogen gas.

Dielectric strength (in MV/m, or 10⋅volt/meter) of various common materials:

==Units==
In SI, the unit of dielectric strength is volts per meter (V/m). It is also common to see related units such as volt per centimeter (V/cm), megavolts per meter (MV/m), and so on.

In United States customary units, dielectric strength is often specified in volt per mil (a mil is 1/1000 inch). The conversion is:
:formula_1

<text>Differential Manchester encoding (DM) is a line code in digital frequency modulation in which data and clock signals are combined to form a single two-level self-synchronizing data stream. Each data bit is encoded by a presence or absence of signal level transition in the middle of the bit period, followed by the mandatory level transition at the beginning. The code is insensitive to an inversion of polarity. In various specific applications, this method is also called by various other names, including biphase mark code (CC), F2F (frequency/double frequency), Aiken biphase, and conditioned diphase.

==Definition==
Differential Manchester encoding is a differential encoding technology, using the presence or absence of transitions to indicate logical value. An improvement to Manchester coding which is a special case of binary phase-shift keying, it is not necessary to know the initial polarity of the transmitted message signal, because the information is not represented by the absolute voltage levels but by their transitions.

There are two clock ticks per bit period (marked with full and dotted lines in the figure). At every second clock tick, marked with a dotted line, there is a potential level transition conditional on the data. At the other ticks, the line state changes unconditionally to ease clock recovery.

One version of the code makes a transition for 0 and no transition for 1; the other makes a transition for 1 and no transition for 0. 

Differential Manchester encoding has the following advantages:
* A transition is guaranteed at least once every bit, for robust clock recovery.
* In a noisy environment, detecting transitions is less error-prone than comparing signal levels against a threshold.
* Unlike with Manchester encoding, only the presence of a transition is important, not the polarity. Differential coding schemes will work exactly the same if the signal is inverted (e.g. wires swapped). Other line codes with this property include NRZI, bipolar encoding, coded mark inversion, and MLT-3 encoding.
* If the high and low signal levels have the same magnitude with opposite polarity, the average voltage around each unconditional transition is zero. Zero DC bias reduces the necessary transmitting power, minimizes the amount of electromagnetic noise produced by the transmission line, and eases the use of isolating transformers.

These positive features are achieved at the expense of doubling the clock frequency of the encoded data stream.

Differential Manchester encoding is specified in the IEEE 802.5 standard for Token Ring local area networks, and is used for many other applications, including magnetic and optical storage. As Biphase Mark Code (BMC), it is used in AES3, S/PDIF, SMPTE time code, USB PD, xDSL and DALI. Many magnetic stripe cards also use BMC encoding, often called F2F (frequency/double frequency) or Aiken Biphase, according to the ISO/IEC 7811 standard. Differential Manchester encoding is also the original modulation method used for single-density floppy disks, followed by double-density modified frequency modulation (MFM).

<text>In optics, a diffraction grating is an optical grating with a periodic structure that diffracts light, or another type of electromagnetic radiation, into several beams traveling in different directions (i.e., different diffraction angles). The emerging coloration is a form of structural coloration. The directions or diffraction angles of these beams depend on the wave (light) incident angle to the diffraction grating, the spacing or periodic distance between adjacent diffracting elements (e.g., parallel slits for a transmission grating) on the grating, and the wavelength of the incident light. The grating acts as a dispersive element. Because of this, diffraction gratings are commonly used in monochromators and spectrometers, but other applications are also possible such as optical encoders for high-precision motion control and wavefront measurement.

For typical applications, a reflective grating has ridges or &quot;rulings&quot; on its surface while a transmissive grating has transmissive or hollow slits on its surface. Such a grating modulates the amplitude of an incident wave to create a diffraction pattern. Some gratings modulate the phases of incident waves rather than the amplitude, and these types of gratings can be produced frequently by using holography.

James Gregory (1638–1675) observed the diffraction patterns caused by a bird feather, which was effectively the first diffraction grating (in a natural form) to be discovered, about a year after Isaac Newton&#x27;s prism experiments. The first human-made diffraction grating was made around 1785 by Philadelphia inventor David Rittenhouse, who strung hairs between two finely threaded screws. This was similar to notable German physicist Joseph von Fraunhofer&#x27;s wire diffraction grating in 1821. The principles of diffraction were discovered by Thomas Young and Augustin-Jean Fresnel. Using these principles, Fraunhofer was the first to use a diffraction grating to obtain line spectra and the first to measure the wavelengths of spectral lines with a diffraction grating.

In the 1860s, state-of-the-art diffraction gratings with small groove period (&quot;d&quot;) were manufactured by Friedrich Adolph Nobert (1806–1881) in Greifswald; then the two Americans Lewis Morris Rutherfurd (1816–1892) and William B. Rogers (1804–1882) took over the lead. By the end of the 19th century, the concave gratings of Henry Augustus Rowland (1848–1901) were the best available.

A diffraction grating can create &quot;rainbow&quot; colors when it is illuminated by a wide-spectrum (e.g., continuous) light source. Rainbow-like colors from closely spaced narrow tracks on optical data storage disks such as CDs or DVDs are an example of light diffraction caused by diffraction gratings. A usual diffraction grating has parallel lines (It is true for 1-dimensional gratings, but 2 or 3-dimensional gratings are also possible and they have their applications such as wavefront measurement), while a CD has a spiral of finely spaced data tracks. Diffraction colors also appear when one looks at a bright point source through a translucent fine-pitch umbrella fabric covering. Decorative patterned plastic films based on reflective grating patches are inexpensive and commonplace. A similar color separation seen from thin layers of oil (or gasoline, etc.) on water, known as iridescence, is not caused by diffraction from a grating but rather by thin film interference from the closely stacked transmissive layers.

==Theory of operation==

For a diffraction grating, the relationship between the grating spacing (i.e., the distance between adjacent grating grooves or slits), the angle of the wave (light) incidence to the grating, and the diffracted wave from the grating is known as the grating equation. Like many other optical formulas, the grating equation can be derived by using the Huygens–Fresnel principle, stating that each point on a wavefront of a propagating wave can be considered to act as a point wave source, and a wavefront at any subsequent point can be found by adding together the contributions from each of these individual point wave sources on the previous wavefront.

Gratings may be of the &#x27;reflective&#x27; or &#x27;transmissive&#x27; type, analogous to a mirror or lens, respectively. A grating has a &#x27;zero-order mode&#x27; (where the integer order of diffraction &quot;m&quot; is set to zero), in which a ray of light behaves according to the laws of reflection (like a mirror) and refraction (like a lens), respectively.

An idealized diffraction grating is made up of a set of slits of spacing formula_1, that must be wider than the wavelength of interest to cause diffraction. Assuming a plane wave of monochromatic light of wavelength formula_2 at normal incidence on a grating (i.e., wavefronts of the incident wave are parallel to the grating main plane), each slit in the grating acts as a quasi point wave source from which light propagates in all directions (although this is typically limited to the forward hemisphere from the point source). Of course, every point on every slit to which the incident wave reaches plays as a point wave source for the diffraction wave and all these contributions to the diffraction wave determine the detailed diffraction wave light property distribution, but diffraction angles (at the grating) at which the diffraction wave intensity is highest are determined only by these quasi point sources corresponding the slits in the grating. After the incident light (wave) interacts with the grating, the resulting diffracted light from the grating is composed of the sum of interfering wave components emanating from each slit in the grating; At any given point in space through which the diffracted light may pass, typically called observation point, the path length from each slit in the grating to the given point varies, so the phase of the wave emanating from each of the slits at that point also varies. As a result, the sum of the diffracted waves from the grating slits at the given observation point creates a peak, valley, or some degree between them in light intensity through additive and destructive interference. When the difference between the light paths from adjacent slits to the observation point is equal to an odd integer-multiple of the half of the wavelength, &quot;l&quot;formula_3 with an odd integer formula_4, the waves are out of phase at that point, and thus cancel each other to create the (locally) minimum light intensity. Similarly, when the path difference is a multiple of formula_2, the waves are in phase and the (locally) maximum intensity occurs. For light at the normal incidence to the grating, the intensity maxima occur at diffraction angles formula_6, which satisfy the relationship formula_7, where formula_6 is the angle between the diffracted ray and the grating&#x27;s normal vector, formula_1 is the distance from the center of one slit to the center of the adjacent slit, and formula_10 is an integer representing the propagation-mode of interest called the diffraction order.


When a plane light wave is normally incident on a grating of uniform period formula_1, the diffracted light has maxima at diffraction angles formula_6 given by a special case of the grating equation as
formula_13

It can be shown that if the plane wave is incident at angle formula_14 relative to the grating normal, in the plane orthogonal to the grating periodicity, the grating equation becomes
formula_15
which describes in-plane diffraction as a special case of the more general scenario of conical, or off-plane, diffraction described by the generalized grating equation:
formula_16
where formula_17 is the angle between the direction of the plane wave and the direction of the grating grooves, which is orthogonal to both the directions of grating periodicity and grating normal. 
Various sign conventions for formula_14, formula_6 and formula_10 are used; any choice is fine as long as the choice is kept through diffraction-related calculations. When solved for diffracted angle at which the diffracted wave intensity are maximized, the equation becomes
formula_21

The diffracted light that corresponds to direct transmission for a transmissive diffraction grating or specular reflection for a reflective grating is called the zero order, and is denoted formula_22. The other diffracted light intensity maxima occur at angles formula_6 represented by non-zero integer diffraction orders formula_10. Note that formula_10 can be positive or negative, corresponding to diffracted orders on both sides of the zero-order diffracted beam.

Even if the grating equation is derived from a specific grating such as the grating in the right diagram (this grating is called a blazed grating), the equation can apply to any regular structure of the same spacing, because the phase relationship between light scattered from adjacent diffracting elements of the grating remains the same. The detailed diffracted light property distribution (e.g., intensity) depends on the detailed structure of the grating elements as well as on the number of elements in the grating, but it always gives maxima in the directions given by the grating equation.

Depending on how a grating modulates incident light on it to cause the diffracted light, there are the following grating types:

* Transmission amplitude diffraction grating, which spatially and periodically modulates the intensity of an incident wave that transmits through the grating (and the diffracted wave is the consequence of this modulation). 
* Reflection amplitude diffraction gratings, which spatially and periodically modulate the intensity of an incident wave that is reflected from the grating.
* Transmission phase diffraction grating, that spatially and periodically modulates the phase of an incident wave passing through the grating.
* Reflection phase diffraction grating, that spatially and periodically modulates the phase of an incident wave reflected from the grating.

An optical axis diffraction grating, in which the optical axis is spatially and periodically modulated, is also considered either a reflection or transmission phase diffraction grating.

The grating equation applies to all these gratings due to the same phase relationship between the diffracted waves from adjacent diffracting elements of the gratings, even if the detailed distribution of the diffracted wave property depends on the detailed structure of each grating.

===Quantum electrodynamics===
Quantum electrodynamics (QED) offers another derivation of the properties of a diffraction grating in terms of photons as particles (at some level). QED can be described intuitively with the path integral formulation of quantum mechanics. As such it can model photons as potentially following all paths from a source to a final point, each path with a certain probability amplitude. These probability amplitudes can be represented as a complex number or equivalent vector—or, as Richard Feynman simply calls them in his book on QED, &quot;arrows&quot;.

For the probability that a certain event will happen, one sums the probability amplitudes for all of the possible ways in which the event can occur, and then takes the square of the length of the result. The probability amplitude for a photon from a monochromatic source to arrive at a certain final point at a given time, in this case, can be modeled as an arrow that spins rapidly until it is evaluated when the photon reaches its final point. For example, for the probability that a photon will reflect off of a mirror and be observed at a given point a given amount of time later, one sets the photon&#x27;s probability amplitude spinning as it leaves the source, follows it to the mirror, and then to its final point, even for paths that do not involve bouncing off of the mirror at equal angles. One can then evaluate the probability amplitude at the photon&#x27;s final point; next, one can integrate over all of these arrows (see vector sum), and square the length of the result to obtain the probability that this photon will reflect off of the mirror in the pertinent fashion. The times these paths take are what determines the angle of the probability amplitude arrow, as they can be said to &quot;spin&quot; at a constant rate (which is related to the frequency of the photon).

The times of the paths near the classical reflection site of the mirror are nearly the same, so the probability amplitudes point in nearly the same direction—thus, they have a sizable sum. Examining the paths towards the edges of the mirror reveals that the times of nearby paths are quite different from each other, and thus we wind up summing vectors that cancel out quickly. So, there is a higher probability that light will follow a near-classical reflection path than a path further out. However, a diffraction grating can be made out of this mirror, by scraping away areas near the edge of the mirror that usually cancel nearby amplitudes out—but now, since the photons don&#x27;t reflect from the scraped-off portions, the probability amplitudes that would all point, for instance, at forty-five degrees, can have a sizable sum. Thus, this lets light of the right frequency sum to a larger probability amplitude, and as such possess a larger probability of reaching the appropriate final point.

This particular description involves many simplifications: a point source, a &quot;surface&quot; that light can reflect off of (thus neglecting the interactions with electrons) and so forth. The biggest simplification is perhaps in the fact that the &quot;spinning&quot; of the probability amplitude arrows is actually more accurately explained as a &quot;spinning&quot; of the source, as the probability amplitudes of photons do not &quot;spin&quot; while they are in transit. We obtain the same variation in probability amplitudes by letting the time at which the photon left the source be indeterminate—and the time of the path now tells us when the photon would have left the source, and thus what the angle of its &quot;arrow&quot; would be. However, this model and approximation is a reasonable one to illustrate a diffraction grating conceptually. Light of a different frequency may also reflect off of the same diffraction grating, but with a different final point.

==Gratings as dispersive elements==
The wavelength dependence in the grating equation shows that the grating separates an incident polychromatic beam into its constituent wavelength components at different angles, i.e., it is angular dispersive. Each wavelength of input beam spectrum is sent into a different direction, producing a rainbow of colors under white light illumination. This is visually similar to the operation of a prism, although the mechanism is very different. A prism refracts waves of different wavelengths at different angles due to their different refractive indices, while a grating diffracts different wavelengths at different angles due to interference at each wavelength.

The diffracted beams corresponding to consecutive orders may overlap, depending on the spectral content of the incident beam and the grating density. The higher the spectral order, the greater the overlap into the next order.

The grating equation shows that the angles of the diffracted orders only depend on the grooves&#x27; period, and not on their shape. By controlling the cross-sectional profile of the grooves, it is possible to concentrate most of the diffracted optical energy in a particular order for a given wavelength. A triangular profile is commonly used. This technique is called &quot;blazing.&quot; The incident angle and wavelength for which the diffraction is most efficient (the ratio of the diffracted optical energy to the incident energy is the highest) are often called &quot;blazing angle&quot; and &quot;blazing wavelength.&quot; The efficiency of a grating may also depend on the polarization of the incident light. Gratings are usually designated by their &quot;groove density&quot;, the number of grooves per unit length, usually expressed in grooves per millimeter (g/mm), also equal to the inverse of the groove period. The groove period must be on the order of the wavelength of interest; the spectral range covered by a grating is dependent on groove spacing and is the same for ruled and holographic gratings with the same grating constant (meaning &quot;groove density&quot; or the groove period). The maximum wavelength that a grating can diffract is equal to twice the grating period, in which case the incident and diffracted light are at ninety degrees (90°) to the grating normal. To obtain frequency dispersion over a wider frequency one must use a prism. The optical regime, in which the use of gratings is most common, corresponds to wavelengths between 100 nm and 10 µm. In that case, the groove density can vary from a few tens of grooves per millimeter, as in &quot;echelle gratings&quot;, to a few thousands of grooves per millimeter.

When groove spacing is less than half the wavelength of light, the only present order is the &quot;m&quot; = 0 order. Gratings with such small periodicity (with respect to the incident light wavelength) are called subwavelength gratings and exhibit special optical properties. Made on an isotropic material the subwavelength gratings give rise to form birefringence, in which the material behaves as if it were birefringent.

==Fabrication==
=== SR (Surface Relief) gratings ===
SR gratings are named due to its surface structure of depressions (low relief) and elevations (high relief). Originally, high-resolution gratings were ruled by high-quality &quot;ruling engines&quot; whose construction was a large undertaking. Henry Joseph Grayson designed a machine to make diffraction gratings, succeeding with one of 120,000 lines to the inch (approx. 4,724 lines per mm) in 1899. Later, photolithographic techniques created gratings via holographic interference patterns. A holographic grating has sinusoidal grooves as the result of an optical sinusoidal interference pattern on the grating material during its fabrication, and may not be as efficient as ruled gratings, but are often preferred in monochromators because they produce less stray light. A copying technique can make high quality replicas from master gratings of either type, thereby lowering fabrication costs.

Semiconductor technology today is also used to etch holographically patterned gratings into robust materials such as fused silica. In this way, low stray-light holography is combined with the high efficiency of deep, etched transmission gratings, and can be incorporated into high-volume, low-cost semiconductor manufacturing technology.

=== VPH (Volume Phase Holography) gratings ===
Another method for manufacturing diffraction gratings uses a photosensitive gel sandwiched between two substrates. A holographic interference pattern exposes the gel, which is later developed. These gratings, called &quot;volume phase holography diffraction gratings&quot; (or VPH diffraction gratings) have no physical grooves, but instead a periodic modulation of the refractive index within the gel. This removes much of the surface scattering effects typically seen in other types of gratings. These gratings also tend to have higher efficiencies, and allow for the inclusion of complicated patterns into a single grating. A VPH diffraction grating is typically a transmission grating, through which incident light passes and is diffracted, but a VPH reflection grating can also be made by tilting the direction of a refractive index modulation with respect to the grating surface. In older versions of such gratings, environmental susceptibility was a trade-off, as the gel had to be contained at low temperature and humidity. Typically, the photosensitive substances are sealed between two substrates that make them resistant to humidity, and thermal and mechanical stresses. VPH diffraction gratings are not destroyed by accidental touches and are more scratch resistant than typical relief gratings.

===Blazed gratings===

A blazed grating is manufactured with grooves that have a sawtooth-shaped cross section, unlike the symmetrical grooves of other gratings. This allows the grating to achieve maximum diffraction efficiency, but in only one diffraction order which is dependent on the angle of the sawtooth grooves, known as the blaze angle. Common uses include specific wavelength selection for tunable lasers, among others.

=== Other gratings ===
A new technology for grating insertion into integrated photonic lightwave circuits is digital planar holography (DPH). DPH gratings are generated in computer and fabricated on one or several interfaces of an optical waveguide planar by using standard micro-lithography or nano-imprinting methods, compatible with mass-production. Light propagates inside the DPH gratings, confined by the refractive index gradient, which provides longer interaction path and greater flexibility in light steering.

==Examples==
Diffraction gratings are often used in monochromators, spectrometers, lasers, wavelength division multiplexing devices, optical pulse compressing devices, interferometers, and many other optical instruments.

Ordinary pressed CD and DVD media are every-day examples of diffraction gratings and can be used to demonstrate the effect by reflecting sunlight off them onto a white wall. This is a side effect of their manufacture, as one surface of a CD has many small pits in the plastic, arranged in a spiral; that surface has a thin layer of metal applied to make the pits more visible. The structure of a DVD is optically similar, although it may have more than one pitted surface, and all pitted surfaces are inside the disc.

Due to the sensitivity to the refractive index of the media, diffraction grating can be used as sensor of fluid properties.

In a standard pressed vinyl record when viewed from a low angle perpendicular to the grooves, a similar but less defined effect to that in a CD/DVD is seen. This is due to viewing angle (less than the critical angle of reflection of the black vinyl) and the path of the light being reflected due to this being changed by the grooves, leaving a rainbow relief pattern behind.

Diffraction gratings are also used to distribute evenly the frontlight of e-readers such as the Nook Simple Touch with GlowLight.

===Gratings from electronic components===

Some everyday electronic components contain fine and regular patterns, and as a result readily serve as diffraction gratings. For example, CCD sensors from discarded mobile phones and cameras can be removed from the device. With a laser pointer, diffraction can reveal the spatial structure of the CCD sensors. This can be done for LCD or LED displays of smart phones as well. Because such displays are usually protected just by transparent casing, experiments can be done without damaging the phones. If accurate measurements are not intended, a spotlight can reveal the diffraction patterns.

===Natural gratings===

Striated muscle is the most commonly found natural diffraction grating and, this has helped physiologists in determining the structure of such muscle. Aside from this, the chemical structure of crystals can be thought of as diffraction gratings for types of electromagnetic radiation other than visible light, this is the basis for techniques such as X-ray crystallography.

Most commonly confused with diffraction gratings are the iridescent colors of peacock feathers, mother-of-pearl, and butterfly wings. Iridescence in birds, fish and insects is often caused by thin-film interference rather than a diffraction grating. Diffraction produces the entire spectrum of colors as the viewing angle changes, whereas thin-film interference usually produces a much narrower range. The surfaces of flowers can also create a diffraction, but the cell structures in plants are usually too irregular to produce the fine slit geometry necessary for a diffraction grating. The iridescence signal of flowers is thus only appreciable very locally and hence not visible to man and flower visiting insects. However, natural gratings do occur in some invertebrate animals, like the peacock spiders, the antennae of seed shrimp, and have even been discovered in Burgess Shale fossils.
Diffraction grating effects are sometimes seen in meteorology. Diffraction coronas are colorful rings surrounding a source of light, such as the sun. These are usually observed much closer to the light source than halos, and are caused by very fine particles, like water droplets, ice crystals, or smoke particles in a hazy sky. When the particles are all nearly the same size they diffract the incoming light at very specific angles. The exact angle depends on the size of the particles. Diffraction coronas are commonly observed around light sources, like candle flames or street lights, in the fog. Cloud iridescence is caused by diffraction, occurring along coronal rings when the particles in the clouds are all uniform in size.

<text>In signal processing, a digital filter is a system that performs mathematical operations on a sampled, discrete-time signal to reduce or enhance certain aspects of that signal. This is in contrast to the other major type of electronic filter, the analog filter, which is typically an electronic circuit operating on continuous-time analog signals.

A digital filter system usually consists of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) to sample the input signal, followed by a microprocessor and some peripheral components such as memory to store data and filter coefficients etc. Program Instructions (software) running on the microprocessor implement the digital filter by performing the necessary mathematical operations on the numbers received from the ADC. In some high performance applications, an FPGA or ASIC is used instead of a general purpose microprocessor, or a specialized digital signal processor (DSP) with specific paralleled architecture for expediting operations such as filtering.

Digital filters may be more expensive than an equivalent analog filter due to their increased complexity, but they make practical many designs that are impractical or impossible as analog filters. Digital filters can often be made very high order, and are often finite impulse response filters, which allows for linear phase response. When used in the context of real-time analog systems, digital filters sometimes have problematic latency (the difference in time between the input and the response) due to the associated analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions and anti-aliasing filters, or due to other delays in their implementation.

Digital filters are commonplace and an essential element of everyday electronics such as radios, cellphones, and AV receivers.

==Characterization==

A digital filter is characterized by its transfer function, or equivalently, its difference equation. Mathematical analysis of the transfer function can describe how it will respond to any input. As such, designing a filter consists of developing specifications appropriate to the problem (for example, a second-order low-pass filter with a specific cut-off frequency), and then producing a transfer function that meets the specifications.

The transfer function for a linear, time-invariant, digital filter can be expressed as a transfer function in the &quot;Z&quot;-domain; if it is causal, then it has the form:

:formula_1

where the order of the filter is the greater of &quot;N&quot; or &quot;M&quot;.
See &quot;Z&quot;-transform&#x27;s LCCD equation for further discussion of this transfer function.

This is the form for a recursive filter, which typically leads to an infinite impulse response (IIR) behaviour, but if the denominator is made equal to unity, i.e. no feedback, then this becomes a finite impulse response (FIR) filter.

===Analysis techniques===

A variety of mathematical techniques may be employed to analyze the behavior of a given digital filter. Many of these analysis techniques may also be employed in designs, and often form the basis of a filter specification.

Typically, one characterizes filters by calculating how they will respond to a simple input such as an impulse. One can then extend this information to compute the filter&#x27;s response to more complex signals.

====Impulse response====

The impulse response, often denoted formula_2 or formula_3, is a measurement of how a filter will respond to the Kronecker delta function. For example, given a difference equation, one would set formula_4 and formula_5 for formula_6 and evaluate. The impulse response is a characterization of the filter&#x27;s behavior. Digital filters are typically considered in two categories: infinite impulse response (IIR) and finite impulse response (FIR).
In the case of linear time-invariant FIR filters, the impulse response is exactly equal to the sequence of filter coefficients, and thus:

:formula_7

IIR filters on the other hand are recursive, with the output depending on both current and previous inputs as well as previous outputs. The general form of an IIR filter is thus:
:formula_8

Plotting the impulse response reveals how a filter responds to a sudden, momentary disturbance.
An IIR filter is always recursive. While it is possible for a recursive filter to have a finite impulse response, a non-recursive filter always has a finite impulse response. An example is the moving average (MA) filter, which can be implemented both recursively and non recursively.

====Difference equation ====

In discrete-time systems, the digital filter is often implemented by converting the transfer function to a linear constant-coefficient difference equation (LCCD) via the Z-transform. The discrete frequency-domain transfer function is written as the ratio of two polynomials. For example:

:formula_9

This is expanded:
:formula_10

and to make the corresponding filter causal, the numerator and denominator are divided by the highest order of formula_11:
:formula_12

The coefficients of the denominator, formula_13, are the &#x27;feed-backward&#x27; coefficients and the coefficients of the numerator are the &#x27;feed-forward&#x27; coefficients, formula_14. The resultant linear difference equation is:
:formula_15

or, for the example above:

:formula_16

rearranging terms:

:formula_17

then by taking the inverse &quot;z&quot;-transform:

:formula_18

and finally, by solving for formula_19:

:formula_20

This equation shows how to compute the next output sample, formula_19, in terms of the past outputs, formula_22, the present input, formula_23, and the past inputs, formula_24. Applying the filter to an input in this form is equivalent to a Direct Form I or II (see below) realization, depending on the exact order of evaluation.

In plain terms, for example, as used by a computer programmer implementing the above equation in code, it can be described as follows:

formula_25 = the output, or filtered value
formula_26 = the input, or incoming raw value
formula_27 = the sample number, iteration number, or time period number

and therefore:

formula_19 = the current filtered (output) value
formula_29 = the last filtered (output) value
formula_30 = the 2nd-to-last filtered (output) value
formula_23 = the current raw input value
formula_32 = the last raw input value
formula_33 = the 2nd-to-last raw input value

==Filter design==
Although filters are easily understood and calculated, the practical challenges of their design and implementation are significant and are the subject of much advanced research.

There are two categories of digital filter: the recursive filter and the nonrecursive filter. These are often referred to as infinite impulse response (IIR) filters and finite impulse response (FIR) filters, respectively.

==Filter realization==

After a filter is designed, it must be &quot;realized&quot; by developing a signal flow diagram that describes the filter in terms of operations on sample sequences.

A given transfer function may be realized in many ways. Consider how a simple expression such as formula_34 could be evaluated – one could also compute the equivalent formula_35. In the same way, all realizations may be seen as &quot;factorizations&quot; of the same transfer function, but different realizations will have different numerical properties. Specifically, some realizations are more efficient in terms of the number of operations or storage elements required for their implementation, and others provide advantages such as improved numerical stability and reduced round-off error. Some structures are better for fixed-point arithmetic and others may be better for floating-point arithmetic.

===Direct form I===

A straightforward approach for IIR filter realization is direct form I, where the difference equation is evaluated directly. This form is practical for small filters, but may be inefficient and impractical (numerically unstable) for complex designs. In general, this form requires 2N delay elements (for both input and output signals) for a filter of order N.

===Direct form II===

The alternate direct form II only needs &quot;N&quot; delay units, where &quot;N&quot; is the order of the filter – potentially half as much as direct form I. This structure is obtained by reversing the order of the numerator and denominator sections of Direct Form I, since they are in fact two linear systems, and the commutativity property applies. Then, one will notice that there are two columns of delays (formula_36) that tap off the center net, and these can be combined since they are redundant, yielding the implementation as shown below.

The disadvantage is that direct form II increases the possibility of arithmetic overflow for filters of high &quot;Q&quot; or resonance. It has been shown that as &quot;Q&quot; increases, the round-off noise of both direct form topologies increases without bounds. This is because, conceptually, the signal is first passed through an all-pole filter (which normally boosts gain at the resonant frequencies) before the result of that is saturated, then passed through an all-zero filter (which often attenuates much of what the all-pole half amplifies).

===Cascaded second-order sections===

A common strategy is to realize a higher-order (greater than 2) digital filter as a cascaded series of second-order &quot;biquadratric&quot; (or &quot;biquad&quot;) sections (see digital biquad filter). The advantage of this strategy is that the coefficient range is limited. Cascading direct form II sections results in &quot;N&quot; delay elements for filters of order &quot;N&quot;. Cascading direct form I sections results in &quot;N&quot; + 2 delay elements, since the delay elements of the input of any section (except the first section) are redundant with the delay elements of the output of the preceding section.

===Other forms===

Other forms include:
* Direct form I and II transpose
* Series/cascade lower (typical second) order subsections
* Parallel lower (typical second) order subsections
** Continued fraction expansion
* Lattice and ladder
** One, two and three-multiply lattice forms
** Three and four-multiply normalized ladder forms
** ARMA structures
* State-space structures:
** optimal (in the minimum noise sense): formula_37 parameters
** block-optimal and section-optimal: formula_38 parameters
** input balanced with Givens rotation: formula_38 parameters
* Coupled forms: Gold Rader (normal), State Variable (Chamberlin), Kingsbury, Modified State Variable, Zölzer, Modified Zölzer
* Wave Digital Filters (WDF)
* Agarwal–Burrus (1AB and 2AB)
* Harris–Brooking
* ND-TDL
* Multifeedback
* Analog-inspired forms such as Sallen-key and state variable filters
* Systolic arrays

==Comparison of analog and digital filters==
Digital filters are not subject to the component tolerances, temperature variations, and non-linearities that greatly complicate the design of analog filters. Analog filters consist of imperfect electronic components, whose values may also change with temperature and drift with time. As the order of an analog filter increases, and thus its component count, the effect of variable component errors is greatly magnified. In digital filters, the coefficient values are stored in computer memory, making them far more stable and predictable.

Because the coefficients of digital filters are definite, they can be used to achieve much more complex and selective designs – specifically with digital filters, one can achieve a lower passband ripple, faster transition, and higher stopband attenuation than is practical with analog filters. Even if the design could be achieved using analog filters, the engineering cost of designing an equivalent digital filter would likely be much lower. Furthermore, one can readily modify the coefficients of a digital filter to make an adaptive filter or a user-controllable parametric filter. While these techniques are possible in an analog filter, they are again considerably more difficult.

Digital filters can be used in the design of finite impulse response filters which can achieve extremely steep rolloff slopes with no phase shift. Analog filters that perform the same function are often significantly more complicated, as they would require many delay elements.

Digital filters rely less on analog circuitry, potentially allowing for a better signal-to-noise ratio. A digital filter will introduce noise to a signal during analog low pass filtering, analog to digital conversion, digital to analog conversion and may introduce digital noise due to quantization. With analog filters, every component is a source of thermal noise (such as Johnson noise), so as the filter complexity grows, so does the noise.

However, digital filters do introduce a higher fundamental latency to the system. In an analog filter, latency is often negligible; strictly speaking it is the time for an electrical signal to propagate through the filter circuit. In digital systems, latency is introduced not only by delay elements in the digital signal path, but also by analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog converters that are required for a system to process analog signals. Digital filters must also deal with quantization and rounding errors, and often have much less headroom than analog filters, since most DSP ICs operate on only 5V or 3.3V while operational amplifiers typically operate on 12 to 24V.

Additionally, in very simple cases or in cases where frequencies and filter slopes are fixed, it is more cost effective to use an analog filter. Introducing a digital filter requires considerable overhead circuitry, as previously discussed, including two low pass analog filters. Analog filters also require substantially less power than digital filters and are therefore the only solution when power requirements are tight.

When making an electrical circuit on a PCB it is generally easier to use a digital solution, because the processing units are highly optimized over the years. Making the same circuit with analog components would take up a lot more space when using discrete components. Two alternatives are FPAAs and ASICs, but they are expensive for low quantities.

==Types of digital filters==
There are various ways to characterize filters; for example:
* A &quot;linear&quot; filter is a linear transformation of input samples; other filters are &quot;nonlinear&quot;. Linear filters satisfy the superposition principle, i.e. if an input is a weighted linear combination of different signals, the output is a similarly weighted linear combination of the corresponding output signals.
* A &quot;causal&quot; filter uses only previous samples of the input or output signals; while a &quot;non-causal&quot; filter uses future input samples. A non-causal filter can usually be changed into a causal filter by adding a delay to it.
* A &quot;time-invariant&quot; filter has constant properties over time; other filters such as adaptive filters change in time.
* A &quot;stable&quot; filter produces an output that converges to a constant value with time, or remains bounded within a finite interval. An &quot;unstable&quot; filter can produce an output that grows without bounds, with bounded or even zero input.
* A finite impulse response (FIR) filter uses only the input signals, while an infinite impulse response (IIR) filter uses both the input signal and previous samples of the output signal. FIR filters are always stable, while IIR filters may be unstable.

A filter can be represented by a block diagram, which can then be used to derive a sample processing algorithm to implement the filter with hardware instructions. A filter may also be described as a difference equation, a collection of zeros and poles or an impulse response or step response.

Some digital filters are based on the fast Fourier transform, a mathematical algorithm that quickly extracts the frequency spectrum of a signal, allowing the spectrum to be manipulated (such as to create very high order band-pass filters) before converting the modified spectrum back into a time-series signal with an inverse FFT operation. These filters give O(n log n) computational costs whereas conventional digital filters tend to be O(n2).

Another form of a digital filter is that of a state-space model. A well used state-space filter is the Kalman filter published by Rudolf Kálmán in 1960.

Traditional linear filters are usually based on attenuation. Alternatively nonlinear filters can be designed, including energy transfer filters, which allow the user to move energy in a designed way so that unwanted noise or effects can be moved to new frequency bands either lower or higher in frequency, spread over a range of frequencies, split, or focused. Energy transfer filters complement traditional filter designs and introduce many more degrees of freedom in filter design. Digital energy transfer filters are relatively easy to design and to implement and exploit nonlinear dynamics.

<text>In digital telephony, the digital milliwatt is a standard test signal that serves as a reference for analog signal levels in the telecommunications network. When decoding the digital milliwatt, a PCM decoder produces a sinusoidal signal with a frequency of with one milliwatt in power (, a reference for dBm0).

The digital milliwatt signal is encoded by eight 8-bit words corresponding to one pulse-code modulated cycle of the signal, sampled 8000 times per second. It is typically stored in read-only memory (ROM) in the telecommunication equipment.

The digital milliwatt signal is often generated in instruments in place of separate test equipment. It has the advantage of being tied in frequency and amplitude to the relatively stable digital clock signal and power (voltage) supply, respectively, that are used by the digital channel bank.

<text>In telecommunications, a digital multiplex hierarchy is a hierarchy consisting of an ordered repetition of tandem digital multiplexers that produce signals of successively higher data rates at each level of the hierarchy.

Digital multiplexing hierarchies may be implemented in many different configurations depending on; (a) the number of channels desired, (b) the signaling system to be used, and (c) the bit rate allowed by the communications media.

Some currently available digital multiplexers have been designated as Dl-, DS-, or M-series, all of which operate at T-carrier rates.

In the design of digital multiplex hierarchies, care must be exercised to ensure interoperability of the multiplexers used in the hierarchy.

==Digroup==

Digroup is an abbreviation for digital group. In telephony, a basic group in the digital multiplex hierarchy.

In the North American and Japanese T-carrier digital hierarchies, each digroup supports 12 PCM voice channels or their equivalent in other services. The DS1 line rate (2 digroups plus overhead bits) is 1.544 Mbit/s, supporting 24 voice channels or their equivalent in other services.

In the E-carrier European hierarchy, each digroup supports 15 PCM channels or their equivalent in other services. The DS1 line rate (2 digroups plus overhead bits) is 2.048 Mbit/s, supporting 30 voice channels or their equivalent in other services.

<text>Digital Signal 0 (DS0) is a basic digital signaling rate of 64 kilobits per second (kbit/s), corresponding to the capacity of one analog voice-frequency-equivalent communication channel. The DS0 rate, and its equivalents E0 in the E-carrier system and T0 in the T-carrier system, form the basis for the digital multiplex transmission hierarchy in telecommunications systems used in North America, Europe, Japan, and the rest of the world, for both the early plesiochronous systems such as T-carrier and for modern synchronous systems such as SDH/SONET.

The DS0 rate was introduced to carry a single digitized voice call. For a typical phone call, the audio sound is digitized at an 8 kHz sample rate, or 8000 samples per second, using 8-bit pulse-code modulation for each of the samples. This results in a data rate of 64 kbit/s.

Because of its fundamental role in carrying a single phone call, the DS0 rate forms the basis for the digital multiplex transmission hierarchy in telecommunications systems used in North America. To limit the number of wires required between two involved in exchanging voice calls, a system was built in which multiple DS0s are multiplexed together on higher capacity circuits. In this system, twenty-four (24) DS0s are multiplexed into a DS1 signal. Twenty-eight (28) DS1s are multiplexed into a DS3. When carried over copper wire, this is the well-known T-carrier system, with T1 and T3 corresponding to DS1 and DS3, respectively. 

Besides its use for voice communications, the DS0 rate may support twenty 2.4 kbit/s channels, ten 4.8 kbit/s channels, five 9.67 kbit/s channels, one 56 kbit/s channel, or one 64 kbit/s clear channel.

E0 (standardized as ITU G.703) is the European equivalent of the North American DS0 for carrying a single voice call. However, there are some subtle differences in implementation. Voice signals are encoded for carriage over E0 according to ITU G.711. Note that when a T-carrier system is used as in North America, robbed bit signaling can mean that a DS0 channel carried over that system is not an error-free bit-stream. The out-of-band signaling used in the European E-carrier system avoids this.

<text>Digital subscriber line (DSL; originally digital subscriber loop) is a family of technologies that are used to transmit digital data over telephone lines. In telecommunications marketing, the term DSL is widely understood to mean asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL), the most commonly installed DSL technology, for Internet access.

In ADSL, the data throughput in the upstream direction (the direction to the service provider) is lower, hence the designation of &quot;asymmetric&quot; service. In symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL) services, the downstream and upstream data rates are equal.

DSL service can be delivered simultaneously with wired telephone service on the same telephone line since DSL uses higher frequency bands for data transmission. On the customer premises, a DSL filter is installed on each telephone to prevent undesirable interaction between DSL and telephone service.

The bit rate of consumer ADSL services typically ranges from up to , while the later VDSL+ technology delivers between and in the direction to the customer (downstream), with up to upstream. The exact performance is depending on technology, line conditions, and service-level implementation. Researchers at Bell Labs have reached SDSL speeds over using traditional copper telephone lines, though such speeds have not been made available for the end customers yet.

==History==
Initially, it was believed that ordinary phone lines could only be used at modest speeds, usually less than 9600 bits per second. In the 1950s, ordinary twisted-pair telephone cable often carried 4 MHz television signals between studios, suggesting that such lines would allow transmitting many megabits per second. One such circuit in the United Kingdom ran some between the BBC studios in Newcastle-upon-Tyne and the Pontop Pike transmitting station. However, these cables had other impairments besides Gaussian noise, preventing such rates from becoming practical in the field. The 1980s saw the development of techniques for broadband communications that allowed the limit to be greatly extended. A patent was filed in 1979 for the use of existing telephone wires for both telephones and data terminals that were connected to a remote computer via a digital data carrier system.

The motivation for digital subscriber line technology was the Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) specification proposed in 1984 by the CCITT (now ITU-T) as part of Recommendation I.120, later reused as ISDN digital subscriber line (IDSL). Employees at Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies) developed asymmetric digital subscriber line (ADSL) by placing wide-band digital signals at frequencies above the existing baseband analog voice signal carried on conventional twisted pair cabling between telephone exchanges and customers. A patent was filed by AT&amp;T Bell Labs on the basic DSL concept in 1988.

Joseph W. Lechleider&#x27;s contribution to DSL was his insight that an asymmetric arrangement offered more than double the bandwidth capacity of symmetric DSL. This allowed Internet service providers to offer efficient service to consumers, who benefited greatly from the ability to download large amounts of data but rarely needed to upload comparable amounts. ADSL supports two modes of transport: fast channel and interleaved channel. Fast channel is preferred for streaming multimedia, where an occasional &quot;dropped bit&quot; is acceptable, but lags are less so. Interleaved channel works better for file transfers, where the delivered data must be error-free but latency (time delay) incurred by the retransmission of error-containing packets is acceptable.

Consumer-oriented ADSL was designed to operate on existing lines already conditioned for Basic Rate Interface ISDN services. Engineers developed high-speed DSL facilities such as high bit rate digital subscriber line (HDSL) and symmetric digital subscriber line (SDSL) to provision traditional Digital Signal 1 (DS1) services over standard copper pair facilities.

Older ADSL standards delivered to the customer over about of unshielded twisted-pair copper wire. Newer variants improved these rates. Distances greater than significantly reduce the bandwidth usable on the wires, thus reducing the data rate. But ADSL loop extenders increase these distances by repeating the signal, allowing the local exchange carrier (LEC) to deliver DSL speeds to any distance.
Until the late 1990s, the cost of digital signal processors for DSL was prohibitive. All types of DSL employ highly complex digital signal processing algorithms to overcome the inherent limitations of the existing twisted pair wires. Due to the advancements of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) technology, the cost of the equipment associated with a DSL deployment lowered significantly. The two main pieces of equipment are a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) at one end and a DSL modem at the other end.

It is possible to set up a DSL connection over an existing cable. Such deployment, even including equipment, is much cheaper than installing a new, high-bandwidth fiber-optic cable over the same route and distance. This is true both for ADSL and SDSL variations. The commercial success of DSL and similar technologies largely reflects the advances made in electronics over the decades that have increased performance and reduced costs even while digging trenches in the ground for new cables (copper or fiber optic) remains expensive.

These advantages made ADSL a better proposition for customers requiring Internet access than metered dial up, while also allowing voice calls to be received at the same time as a data connection. Telephone companies were also under pressure to move to ADSL owing to competition from cable companies, which use DOCSIS cable modem technology to achieve similar speeds. Demand for high bandwidth applications, such as video and file sharing, also contributed to the popularity of ADSL technology. Some of the first field trials for DSL were carried out in 1996.

Early DSL service required a dedicated dry loop, but when the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) required incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) to lease their lines to competing DSL service providers, shared-line DSL became available. Also known as DSL over unbundled network element, this unbundling of services allows a single subscriber to receive two separate services from two separate providers on one cable pair. The DSL service provider&#x27;s equipment is co-located in the same telephone exchange as that of the ILEC supplying the customer&#x27;s pre-existing voice service. The subscriber&#x27;s circuit is rewired to interface with hardware supplied by the ILEC which combines a DSL frequency and POTS signals on a single copper pair.

Since 1999, certain ISPs have been offering microfilters. These devices are installed indoors and serve the same purpose as DSL splitters, which are deployed outdoors: they divide the frequencies needed for ADSL and POTS phone calls. These filters originated out of a desire to make self-installation of DSL service possible and eliminate early outdoor DSL splitters which were installed at or near the demarcation point between the customer and the ISP. 

By 2012, some carriers in the United States reported that DSL remote terminals with fiber backhaul were replacing older ADSL systems.

==Operation==
Telephones are connected to the telephone exchange via a local loop, which is a physical pair of wires. The local loop was originally intended mostly for the transmission of speech, encompassing an audio frequency range of 300 to 3400 hertz (commercial bandwidth). However, as long-distance trunks were gradually converted from analog to digital operation, the idea of being able to pass data through the local loop (by using frequencies above the voiceband) took hold, ultimately leading to DSL.

The local loop connecting the telephone exchange to most subscribers has the capability of carrying frequencies well beyond the 3400 Hz upper limit of POTS. Depending on the length and quality of the loop, the upper limit can be tens of megahertz. DSL takes advantage of this unused bandwidth of the local loop by creating 4312.5 Hz wide channels starting between 10 and 100 kHz, depending on how the system is configured. Allocation of channels continues to higher frequencies (up to 1.1 MHz for ADSL) until new channels are deemed unusable. Each channel is evaluated for usability in much the same way an analog modem would on a POTS connection. More usable channels equate to more available bandwidth, which is why distance and line quality are a factor (the higher frequencies used by DSL travel only short distances).

The pool of usable channels is then split into two different frequency bands for upstream and downstream traffic, based on a preconfigured ratio. This segregation reduces interference. Once the channel groups have been established, the individual channels are bonded into a pair of virtual circuits, one in each direction. Like analog modems, DSL transceivers constantly monitor the quality of each channel and will add or remove them from service depending on whether they are usable. Once upstream and downstream circuits are established, a subscriber can connect to a service such as an Internet service provider or other network services, like a corporate MPLS network.

The underlying technology of transport across DSL facilities uses modulation of high-frequency carrier waves, an analog signal transmission. A DSL circuit terminates at each end in a modem which modulates patterns of bits into certain high-frequency impulses for transmission to the opposing modem. Signals received from the far-end modem are demodulated to yield a corresponding bit pattern that the modem passes on, in digital form, to its interfaced equipment, such as a computer, router, switch, etc.

Unlike traditional dial-up modems, which modulate bits into signals in the 300–3400 Hz audio baseband, DSL modems modulate frequencies from 4000 Hz to as high as 4 MHz. This frequency band separation enables DSL service and plain old telephone service (POTS) to coexist on the same cables, known as voice-grade cables. On the subscriber&#x27;s end of the circuit, inline DSL filters are installed on each telephone to pass voice frequencies but filter the high-frequency signals that would otherwise be heard as hiss. Also, nonlinear elements in the phone could otherwise generate audible intermodulation and may impair the operation of the data modem in the absence of these low-pass filters. DSL and RADSL modulations do not use the voice-frequency band so high-pass filters are incorporated in the circuitry of DSL modems filter out voice frequencies.
Because DSL operates above the 3.4 kHz voice limit, it cannot pass through a loading coil, which is an inductive coil that is designed to counteract loss caused by shunt capacitance (capacitance between the two wires of the twisted pair). Loading coils are commonly set at regular intervals in POTS lines. Voice service cannot be maintained past a certain distance without such coils. Therefore, some areas that are within range for DSL service are disqualified from eligibility because of loading coil placement. Because of this, phone companies endeavor to remove loading coils on copper loops that can operate without them. Longer lines that require them can be replaced with fiber to the neighborhood or node (FTTN).

Most residential and small-office DSL implementations reserve low frequencies for POTS, so that (with suitable filters and/or splitters) the existing voice service continues to operate independently of the DSL service. Thus POTS-based communications, including fax machines and dial-up modems, can share the wires with DSL. Only one DSL modem can use the subscriber line at a time. The standard way to let multiple computers share a DSL connection uses a router that establishes a connection between the DSL modem and a local Ethernet, powerline, or Wi-Fi network on the customer&#x27;s premises.

The theoretical foundations of DSL, like much of communication technology, can be traced back to Claude Shannon&#x27;s seminal 1948 paper, &quot;A Mathematical Theory of Communication&quot;. Generally, higher bit rate transmissions require a wider frequency band, though the ratio of bit rate to symbol rate and thus to bandwidth are not linear due to significant innovations in digital signal processing and digital modulation methods.

===Naked DSL===
Naked DSL is a way of providing only DSL services over a local loop. It is useful when the customer does not need the traditional telephony voice service because voice service is received either on top of the DSL services (usually VoIP) or through another network (E.g., mobile telephony). It is also commonly called an unbundled network element (UNE) in the United States; in Australia it is known as a unconditioned local loop (ULL); in Belgium it is known as &quot;raw copper&quot; and in the UK it is known as Single Order GEA (SoGEA).

It started making a comeback in the United States in 2004 when Qwest started offering it, closely followed by Speakeasy. As a result of AT&amp;T&#x27;s merger with SBC, and Verizon&#x27;s merger with MCI, those telephone companies have an obligation to offer naked DSL to consumers.

==Typical setup==

On the customer side, a DSL modem is hooked up to a phone line. The telephone company connects the other end of the line to a DSLAM, which concentrates a large number of individual DSL connections into a single box. The DSLAM cannot be located too far from the customer because of attenuation between the DSLAM and the user&#x27;s DSL modem. It is common for a few residential blocks to be connected to one DSLAM.
The above figure is a schematic of a simple DSL connection (in blue). The right side shows a DSLAM residing in the telephone company&#x27;s telephone exchange. The left side shows the customer premises equipment with an optional router. The router manages a local area network which connects PCs and other local devices. The customer may opt for a modem that contains both a router and wireless access. This option (within the dashed bubble) often simplifies the connection.

===Exchange equipment===

At the exchange, a digital subscriber line access multiplexer (DSLAM) terminates the DSL circuits and aggregates them, where they are handed off to other networking transports. The DSLAM terminates all connections and recovers the original digital information. In the case of ADSL, the voice component is also separated at this step, either by a filter or splitter integrated in the DSLAM or by specialized filtering equipment installed before it. Load coils in phone lines, used for extending their range in rural areas, must be removed to allow DSL to operate as they only allow frequencies of up to 4000 Hz to pass through phone cables.

===Customer equipment===
The customer end of the connection consists of a DSL modem. This converts data between the digital signals used by computers and the analog voltage signal of a suitable frequency range which is then applied to the phone line.

In some DSL variations (for example, HDSL), the modem connects directly to the computer via a serial interface, using protocols such as Ethernet or V.35. In other cases (particularly ADSL), it is common for the customer equipment to be integrated with higher-level functionality, such as routing, firewalling, or other application-specific hardware and software. In this case, the equipment is referred to as a gateway.

Most DSL technologies require the installation of appropriate DSL filters at the customer&#x27;s premises to separate the DSL signal from the low-frequency voice signal. The separation can take place either at the demarcation point, or with filters installed at the telephone outlets inside the customer premises. It is possible for a DSL gateway to integrate the filter, and allow telephones to connect through the gateway.

Modern DSL gateways often integrate routing and other functionality. The system boots, synchronizes the DSL connection and finally establishes the internet IP services and connection between the local network and the service provider, using protocols such as DHCP or PPPoE.

==Protocols and configurations==
Many DSL technologies implement an Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) layer over the low-level bitstream layer to enable the adaptation of a number of different technologies over the same link.

DSL implementations may create bridged or routed networks. In a bridged configuration, the group of subscriber computers effectively connect into a single subnetwork. The earliest implementations used DHCP to provide the IP address to the subscriber equipment, with authentication via MAC address or an assigned hostname. Later implementations often use Point-to-Point Protocol (PPP) to authenticate with a user ID and password.

==Transmission modulation methods==
Transmission methods vary by market, region, carrier, and equipment.
* Discrete multitone modulation (DMT), the most common kind, also known as Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)
* Trellis-coded pulse-amplitude modulation (TC-PAM), used for HDSL2 and SHDSL
* Carrierless amplitude phase modulation (CAP), deprecated in 1996 for ADSL, used for HDSL
* Two-binary, one-quaternary (2B1Q), used for IDSL and HDSL

The line-length limitations from telephone exchange to subscriber impose severe limits on data transmission rates. Technologies such as VDSL provide very high-speed but short-range links. VDSL is used as a method of delivering triple play services (typically implemented in fiber to the curb network architectures).

Terabit DSL, is a technology that proposes the use of the space between the dielectrics (insulators) on copper twisted pair lines in telephone cables, as waveguides for 300 GHz signals that can offer speeds of up to 1 terabit per second at distances of up to 100 meters, 100 gigabits per second for 300 meters, and 10 gigabits per second for 500 meters. The first experiment for this was carried out with copper lines that were parallel to each other, and not twisted, inside a metal pipe meant to simulate the metal armoring in large telephone cables.

<text>In telecommunications, a digital transmission group is a group of digitized voice or data channels or both with bit streams that are combined into a single digital bit stream for transmission over communications media. 

Digital transmission groups usually are categorized by their maximum capacity, not by a specific number of channels. However, the maximum digital transmission group capacity must be equal to or greater than the sum of the individual multiplexer input channel capacities.

<text>In the mathematical area of algebra, a digroup is a generalization of a group that has two one-sided product operations, formula_1 and formula_2, instead of the single operation in a group. Digroups were introduced independently by Liu (2004), Felipe (2006), and Kinyon (2007), inspired by a question about Leibniz algebras.

To explain digroups, consider a group. In a group there is one operation, such as addition in the set of integers; there is a single &quot;unit&quot; element, like 0 in the integers, and there are inverses, like formula_3 in the integers, for which both the following equations hold: formula_4 and formula_5. A digroup replaces the one operation by two operations that interact in a complicated way, as stated below. A digroup may also have more than one &quot;unit&quot;, and an element formula_6 may have different inverses for each &quot;unit&quot;. This makes a digroup vastly more complicated than a group. Despite that complexity, there are reasons to consider digroups, for which see the references.

==Definition==
A digroup is a set &quot;D&quot; with two binary operations, formula_1 and formula_2, that satisfy the following laws (e.g., Ongay 2010):
*Associativity:
::formula_1 and formula_2 are associative,
::formula_11
::formula_12
::formula_13
*Bar units: There is at least one bar unit, an formula_14, such that for every formula_15
::formula_16
:The set of bar units is called the halo of &quot;D&quot;.
*Inverse: For each bar unit &quot;e&quot;, each formula_17 has a unique &quot;e&quot;-inverse, formula_18, such that
::formula_19

==Generalized digroup==
In a generalized digroup or g-digroup, a generalization due to Salazar-Díaz, Velásquez, and Wills-Toro (2016), each element has a left inverse and a right inverse instead of one two-sided inverse.

One reason for this generalization is that it permits analogs of the isomorphism theorems of group theory that cannot be formulated within digroups.

<text>Direct distance dialing (DDD) is a telecommunications service in North America by which a caller may call any other subscriber outside the local calling area without operator assistance, DDD was introduced in the United States in 1951 with service from Englewood, New Jersey. Direct dialing by subscribers typically requires extra digits to be dialed as prefixes to the directory telephone number of the destination. International Direct Distance Dialing (IDDD) extends the system beyond the geographic boundaries of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP).

==History==
The first direct-dialed long-distance telephone calls were possible in the New Jersey communities of Englewood and Teaneck. Customers of the ENglewood 3, ENglewood 4 and TEaneck 7 exchanges, who could already dial telephone numbers in the New York City area, could place calls to eleven major cities across the United States by dialing the three-digit area code and the seven-digit directory number. Local telephone numbers still consisted of the first two letters of the central office name and five digits. On November 10, 1951, Englewood mayor M. Leslie Denning made the first customer-dialed long-distance call, to Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California.

The destinations, and their area codes, equipped with a long-distance toll-switch at that time were:

* 617: Boston, Massachusetts
* 312: Chicago, Illinois
* 216: Cleveland, Ohio
* 313: Detroit, Michigan
* 414: Milwaukee, Wisconsin
* 415: Oakland, California
* 215: Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
* 412: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
* 401: Providence, Rhode Island
* 916: Sacramento, California
* 318: San Francisco, California
Other areas could not yet be included in DDD as they did not have the necessary toll switching equipment, or because they still did not use a seven-digit local numbering plan. Montreal, Quebec, and Toronto, Ontario, in Canada, for example, had a mix of six- and seven-digit telephone numbers from 1951 to 1957, and did not have DDD until 1958. Whitehorse, Yukon, had seven-digit numbers starting in 1965, but the necessary switching equipment was not in place until 1972.

San Francisco required the special area code 318 due to temporary routing requirements. San Francisco and Oakland each had their own separate toll-switches, so calls had to be routed accordingly depending on the final destination. As the telephone equipment used at the time could only handle three-digit translation, the temporary use of area code 318 was required to distinguish between the two areas. Area code 318 was temporarily used to specify San Francisco and areas north of the Golden Gate, while calls with destinations in Oakland and the East Bay continued to use area code 415. When the electromechanical card-translator box became available in the 1952–53 period, six-digit translation became possible and the use of area code 318 was no longer required. Area code 318 was reclaimed for future use (now used as an area code for northern Louisiana), and the entire San Francisco Bay Area returned to using area code 415.

==Hardware==
The No. 4 Crossbar switching system had been introduced in the early 1940s to switch four-wire circuits and replace the incoming operator. With semiautomatic operation analogous to the early days of the panel switch, the operator in the originating city used a multifrequency keypad to dial an access code to connect to the correct city and to send the seven-digit number to incoming equipment at the terminating city. This design was further refined to serve DDD.

The card sorter of the 4A/CTS (Number 4A Crossbar / Card Translator System) allowed six-digit translation of the central office code number dialed by the customer. This determined the proper trunk circuits to use, where separate circuit groups were used for different cities in the same area code, as in the case of Oakland and San Francisco. The new device used metal cards similar in principle to computer punched cards, and they were rapidly scanned as they fell past a light beam. CTS machines were called 4A (Advanced) if the translator was included in the original installation, and 4M (Modified) if it was added later. A 1970s version of 4XB, the 4A/ETS, used a computer to translate. For international dialing, Traffic Service Position System (TSPS) provided the extra computer power.

The reach of DDD was limited due to the inefficiency and expense of switching equipment, and the limited ability to process records of completed calls. An early obstacle was that the majority of switching systems did not provide Automatic Number Identification (ANI). Common control switches, such as the 1XB switch, were fairly quickly retrofitted to provide ANI, and most 5XB switches were initially installed with ANI services. Panel switch were eventually retrofitted, as were some step-by-step systems that were not scheduled for immediate replacement. Even if a switch had ANI, it could not identify callers on party lines. This was only partly overcome by tip-party identification for two-party lines. As the cost of subscriber line carrier declined, party lines were gradually phased out.

As this and other improved technologies became available, as well as Automatic Message Accounting (AMA) computers to process the long-distance records into customer bills, the reach of DDD was slow in the 1950s, but quickened in the early 1960s. Electronic switching systems allowed electronic processing of the dialed digits, referring to electronic memories to determine call routing, and this has reached the state of the art, with digital telephone exchanges which are basically specialized computers that route voice traffic from one &quot;peripheral&quot; to another as digital data. Call routing can now be done based on the area code, central office code and even the first two digits of the line number, although routing based on digits past the central office code is usually limited to cases of competitive local exchange carriers, number pooling and number portability.

==IDDD==

In the 1960s, with the domestic conversion still underway, plans were laid to extend Direct Distance Dialing beyond North America (including a number of the Caribbean Islands). Some subscribers could already directly dial transatlantic telephone calls to certain destinations as early as in 1957 over the recently completed Atlantic cable to England. A new systematic extension of Direct Distance Dialing was developed and was introduced as International Direct Distance Dialing (IDDD) in March 1970.

With so much new equipment already working that could not handle more than the requisite ten-digit telephone numbers of DDD, the new system was based on designs by which most toll offices did not have to store and forward the whole international telephone number. Gateway offices were set up in New York, London and Paris, connected to the ordinary automatic toll network. The New York gateway was at 32 Avenue of the Americas. The new LT1 5XB switch on the tenth floor of 435 West 50th Street received new originating registers and outgoing senders able to handle fifteen-digit telephone numbers, with appropriate modifications to completing markers and other equipment. Other 5XB switches in the next few years were installed with IDDD as original equipment, and in the 1970s ESS offices also provided the service.

The key to the new system was two-stage multi-frequency pulsing. The outgoing sender sent its Class 4 toll center an off-hook signal as usual, received a wink as usual as a &quot;proceed to send&quot; signal, and outpulsed only a special three-digit (later six-digit) access code. The toll center picked a trunk through the long-distance network to the gateway office, which sent a second wink to the originating office, which then sent the whole dialed number. Thus the toll switching system needed no modification except at the gateway. The international trunks used Signaling System No. 5, a &quot;North Atlantic&quot; version of the North American multi-frequency signaling system, with minor modifications including slightly higher digit rate. European MF systems of the time used compelled signaling, which would slow down too much on a long transoceanic connection.

In the 1970s, toll centers were modified by adding the Traffic Service Position System (TSPS). With these new computers in place, digit storage in the toll system was no longer a problem. End offices were less extensively modified, and sent all their digits in a single stream. TSPS handled the gateway codes and other complexities of toll connections to the gateway office.

==Equivalent service in the United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom and other parts of the Commonwealth of Nations, an equivalent service to direct distance dialing is subscriber trunk dialing (STD), and ISD for international subscriber trunk dialing. Queen Elizabeth II inaugurated STD on 5 December 1958, when she dialed a call from Bristol to Edinburgh and spoke to the Lord Provost.

<doc id="41049" wikidata="Q1334354" url="?curid=41049" title="Direct-sequence spread spectrum">
<text>In telecommunications, direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) is a spread-spectrum modulation technique primarily used to reduce overall signal interference. The direct-sequence modulation makes the transmitted signal wider in bandwidth than the information bandwidth. 
After the despreading or removal of the direct-sequence modulation in the receiver, the information bandwidth is restored, while the unintentional and intentional interference is substantially reduced.

Swiss inventor, Gustav Guanella proposed a &quot;means for and method of secret signals&quot;. With DSSS, the message symbols are modulated by a sequence of complex values known as &quot;spreading sequence&quot;. Each element of the spreading sequence, a so-called &quot;chip&quot;, has a shorter duration than the original message symbols. The modulation of the message symbols scrambles and spreads the signal in the spectrum, and thereby results in a bandwidth of the spreading sequence. The smaller the chip duration, the larger the bandwidth of the resulting DSSS signal; more bandwidth multiplexed to the message signal results in better resistance against narrowband interference.

Some practical and effective uses of DSSS include the code-division multiple access (CDMA) method, the IEEE 802.11b specification used in Wi-Fi networks, and the Global Positioning System.

==Transmission method==
Direct-sequence spread-spectrum transmissions multiply the symbol sequence being transmitted with a spreading sequence that has a higher rate than the original message rate. Usually, sequences are chosen such that the resulting spectrum is spectrally white. Knowledge of the same sequence is used to reconstruct the original data at the receiving end. This is commonly implemented by the element-wise multiplication with the spreading sequence, followed by summation over a message symbol period. This process, &quot;despreading&quot;, is mathematically a correlation of the transmitted spreading sequence with the spreading sequence. In an AWGN channel, the despreaded signal&#x27;s signal-to-noise ratio is increased by the spreading factor, which is the ratio of the spreading-sequence rate to the data rate.

While a transmitted DSSS signal occupies a wider bandwidth than the direct modulation of the original signal would require, its spectrum can be restricted by conventional pulse-shape filtering.

If an undesired transmitter transmits on the same channel but with a different spreading sequence, the despreading process reduces the power of that signal. This effect is the basis for the code-division multiple access (CDMA) method of multi-user medium access, which allows multiple transmitters to share the same channel within the limits of the cross-correlation properties of their spreading sequences.

==Benefits==
* Resistance to unintended or intended jamming
* Sharing of a single channel among multiple users
* Reduced signal/background-noise level hampers interception
* Determination of relative timing between transmitter and receiver

==Uses==
* The United States GPS, European Galileo and Russian GLONASS satellite navigation systems; earlier GLONASS used DSSS with a single spreading sequence in conjunction with FDMA, while later GLONASS used DSSS to achieve CDMA with multiple spreading sequences.
* DS-CDMA (Direct-Sequence Code Division Multiple Access) is a multiple access scheme based on DSSS, by spreading the signals from/to different users with different codes. It is the most widely used type of CDMA.
* Cordless phones operating in the 900 MHz, 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz bands
* IEEE 802.11b 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi, and its predecessor 802.11-1999. (Their successor 802.11g uses both OFDM and DSSS)
* Automatic meter reading
* IEEE 802.15.4 (used, e.g., as PHY and MAC layer for Zigbee, or, as the physical layer for WirelessHART)
* Radio-controlled model Automotive, Aeronautical and Marine vehicles
* Spread spectrum radar for covertness and resistance to jamming and spoofing

<text>In telecommunications, a disengagement originator is the user or execution unit that initiates a disengagement attempt. The disengagement originator may be the originating user, the destination user, or the communications system. The communications system may deliberately originate the disengagement because of preemption, or inadvertently due to system malfunction.

<text>A dispersion-limited operation is an operation of a communications link in which signal waveform degradation attributable to the dispersive effects of the communications medium is the dominant mechanism that limits link performance. The dispersion is the filter-like effect which a link has on the signal, due to the different propagation speeds of the eigenmodes of the link. Practically, this means that the waveform at the input will be different from the waveform at the output of the link.

Note that the amount of allowable degradation is dependent on the quality of the receiver. In fiber optic communications, &quot;dispersion-limited operation&quot; is often confused with &quot;distortion-limited operation&quot;.

<text>In signal processing, distortion is the alteration of the original shape (or other characteristic) of a signal. In communications and electronics it means the alteration of the waveform of an information-bearing signal, such as an audio signal representing sound or a video signal representing images, in an electronic device or communication channel.

Distortion is usually unwanted, and so engineers strive to eliminate or minimize it. In some situations, however, distortion may be desirable. For example, in noise reduction systems like the Dolby system, an audio signal is deliberately distorted in ways that emphasize aspects of the signal that are subject to electrical noise, then it is symmetrically &quot;undistorted&quot; after passing through a noisy communication channel, reducing the noise in the received signal. Distortion is also used as a musical effect, particularly with electric guitars.

The addition of noise or other outside signals (hum, interference) is not considered distortion, though the effects of quantization distortion are sometimes included in noise. Quality measures that reflect both noise and distortion include the signal-to-noise and distortion (SINAD) ratio and total harmonic distortion plus noise (THD+N).

==Electronic signals==
In telecommunications and signal processing, a noise-free system can be characterised by a transfer function, such that the output formula_1 can be written as a function of the input formula_2 as

: formula_3

When the transfer function comprises only a perfect gain constant &quot;A&quot; and perfect delay &quot;T&quot;

: formula_4

the output is undistorted. Distortion occurs when the transfer function &quot;F&quot; is more complicated than this. If &quot;F&quot; is a linear function, for instance a filter whose gain and/or delay varies with frequency, the signal suffers linear distortion. Linear distortion does not introduce new frequency components to a signal but does alter the balance of existing ones.

This diagram shows the behaviour of a signal (made up of a square wave followed by a sine wave) as it is passed through various distorting functions.

# The first trace (in black) shows the input. It also shows the output from a non-distorting transfer function (straight line).
# A high-pass filter (green trace) distorts the shape of a square wave by reducing its low frequency components. This is the cause of the &quot;droop&quot; seen on the top of the pulses. This &quot;pulse distortion&quot; can be very significant when a train of pulses must pass through an AC-coupled (high-pass filtered) amplifier. As the sine wave contains only one frequency, its shape is unaltered.
# A low-pass filter (blue trace) rounds the pulses by removing the high frequency components. All systems are low pass to some extent. Note that the phase of the sine wave is different for the lowpass and the highpass cases, due to the phase distortion of the filters.
# A slightly non-linear transfer function (purple), this one gently compresses the peaks of the sine wave, as may be typical of a tube audio amplifier. This generates small amounts of low order harmonics.
# A hard-clipping transfer function (red) generates high order harmonics. Parts of the transfer function are flat, which indicates that all information about the input signal has been lost in this region.

The transfer function of an ideal amplifier, with perfect gain and delay, is only an approximation. The true behavior of the system is usually different. Nonlinearities in the transfer function of an active device (such as vacuum tubes, transistors, and operational amplifiers) are a common source of non-linear distortion; in passive components (such as a coaxial cable or optical fiber), linear distortion can be caused by inhomogeneities, reflections, and so on in the propagation path.

===Amplitude distortion===
Amplitude distortion is distortion occurring in a system, subsystem, or device when the output amplitude is not a linear function of the input amplitude under specified conditions.

===Harmonic distortion===
Harmonic distortion adds overtones that are whole number multiples of a sound wave&#x27;s frequencies. Nonlinearities that give rise to amplitude distortion in audio systems are most often measured in terms of the harmonics (overtones) added to a pure sinewave fed to the system. Harmonic distortion may be expressed in terms of the relative strength of individual components, in decibels, or the root mean square of all harmonic components: Total harmonic distortion (THD), as a percentage. The level at which harmonic distortion becomes audible depends on the exact nature of the distortion. Different types of distortion (like crossover distortion) are more audible than others (like soft clipping) even if the THD measurements are identical. Harmonic distortion in radio frequency applications is rarely expressed as THD.

===Frequency response distortion===

Non-flat frequency response is a form of distortion that occurs when different frequencies are amplified by different amounts in a filter. For example, the non-uniform frequency response curve of AC-coupled cascade amplifier is an example of frequency distortion. In the audio case, this is mainly caused by room acoustics, poor loudspeakers and microphones, long loudspeaker cables in combination with frequency dependent loudspeaker impedance, etc.

===Phase distortion===

This form of distortion mostly occurs due to electrical reactance. Here, all the components of the input signal are not amplified with the same phase shift, hence making some parts of the output signal out of phase with the rest of the output.

===Group delay distortion===
Can be found only in dispersive media. In a waveguide, phase velocity varies with frequency. In a filter, group delay tends to peak near the cut-off frequency, resulting in pulse distortion. When analog long distance trunks were commonplace, for example in 12 channel carrier, group delay distortion had to be corrected in repeaters.

==Correction of distortion==
As the system output is given by y(t) = F(x(t)), then if the inverse function F−1 can be found, and used intentionally to distort either the input or the output of the system, then the distortion is corrected.

An example of a similar correction is where LP/vinyl recordings or FM audio transmissions are deliberately pre-emphasised by a linear filter, the reproducing system applies an inverse filter to make the overall system undistorted.

Correction is not possible if the inverse does not exist—for instance if the transfer function has flat spots (the inverse would map multiple input points to a single output point). This produces an uncorrectable loss of information. Such a situation can occur when an amplifier is overdriven—causing clipping or slew rate distortion when, for a moment, the amplifier characteristics alone and not the input signal determine the output.

===Cancellation of even-order harmonic distortion===
Many symmetrical electronic circuits reduce the magnitude of even harmonics generated by the non-linearities of the amplifier&#x27;s components, by combining two signals from opposite halves of the circuit where distortion components that are roughly the same magnitude but out of phase. Examples include push-pull amplifiers and long-tailed pairs.

==Teletypewriter or modem signaling==
In binary signaling such as FSK, distortion is the shifting of the significant instants of the signal pulses from their proper positions relative to the beginning of the start pulse. The magnitude of the distortion is expressed in percent of an ideal unit pulse length. This is sometimes called &quot;bias distortion&quot;.

Telegraphic distortion is a similar and older problem, distorting the ratio between &quot;mark&quot; and &quot;space&quot; intervals.

==Audio distortion==

With respect to audio, distortion refers to any kind of deformation of an output waveform compared to its input, usually clipping, harmonic distortion, or intermodulation distortion (mixing phenomena) caused by non-linear behavior of electronic components and power supply limitations. Terms for specific types of nonlinear audio distortion include: crossover distortion and slew-induced distortion (SID).

Other forms of audio distortion are non-flat frequency response, compression, modulation, aliasing, quantization noise, wow and flutter from analog media such as vinyl records and magnetic tape. The human ear cannot hear phase distortion, except that it may affect the stereo imaging.

In most fields, distortion is characterized as unwanted change to a signal. Distortion in music is often intentionally used as an effect when applied to an electric guitar signal in styles of rock music such as heavy metal and punk rock.

==Distortion in art==
In the visual arts a distortion is any change made by an artist to the size, shape or visual character of a form in order to express an idea, convey a feeling, or enhance visual impact. Such distortions or &quot;abstractions&quot; primarily refer to purposeful deviations from photorealistic perspective or from realistic proportionality. Examples include &quot;The Weeping Woman&quot; by Picasso and &quot;The Adoration of the Shepherds&quot; by El Greco, whose human subject matters are irregularly and (as is often with physical distortions) asymmetrically proportioned in a way that is not possible in standard perspective.

==Optics==
In optics, image/optical distortion is a divergence from rectilinear projection caused by a change in magnification with increasing distance from the optical axis of an optical system.

==Map projections==
In cartography, a distortion is the misrepresentation of the area or shape of a feature. The Mercator projection, for example, distorts by exaggerating the size of regions at high latitude.

<text>In telecommunications, distortion-limited operation is the condition prevailing when distortion of a received signal, rather than its attenuated amplitude (or power), limits performance under stated operational conditions and limits. 

&quot;Note:&quot; Distortion-limited operation is reached when the system distorts the shape of the waveform beyond specified limits. For linear systems, distortion-limited operation is equivalent to bandwidth-limited operation.

<text>A distributed database is a database in which data is stored across different physical locations. It may be stored in multiple computers located in the same physical location (e.g. a data centre); or maybe dispersed over a network of interconnected computers. Unlike parallel systems, in which the processors are tightly coupled and constitute a single database system, a distributed database system consists of loosely coupled sites that share no physical components.

System administrators can distribute collections of data (e.g. in a database) across multiple physical locations. A distributed database can reside on organised network servers or decentralised independent computers on the Internet, on corporate intranets or extranets, or on other organisation networks. Because distributed databases store data across multiple computers, distributed databases may improve performance at end-user worksites by allowing transactions to be processed on many machines, instead of being limited to one.

Two processes ensure that the distributed databases remain up-to-date and current: replication and duplication.

# Replication involves using specialized software that looks for changes in the distributive database. Once the changes have been identified, the replication process makes all the databases look the same. The replication process can be complex and time-consuming, depending on the size and number of the distributed databases. This process can also require much time and computer resources. 
# Duplication, on the other hand, has less complexity. It identifies one database as a master and then duplicates that database. The duplication process is normally done at a set time after hours. This is to ensure that each distributed location has the same data. In the duplication process, users may change only the master database. This ensures that local data will not be overwritten.

Both replication and duplication can keep the data current in all distributive locations.

Besides distributed database replication and fragmentation, there are many other distributed database design technologies. For example, local autonomy, synchronous, and asynchronous distributed database technologies. The implementation of these technologies can and do depend on the needs of the business and the sensitivity/confidentiality of the data stored in the database and the price the business is willing to spend on ensuring data security, consistency and integrity.

When discussing access to distributed databases, Microsoft favors the term distributed query, which it defines in protocol-specific manner as &quot;[a]ny SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement that references tables and rowsets from one or more external OLE DB data sources&quot;.
Oracle provides a more language-centric view in which distributed queries and distributed transactions form part of distributed SQL.

== Architecture ==
There are 3 main architecture types for distributed databases:

* Shared-memory: very rarely used
* Shared-disk
* Shared-nothing

In the shared-memory and shared-disk architectures, the data is not partitioned, but it has to be in a shared-nothing architecture.

Shared-disk architecture is more common for cloud databases than for on-premise.

Historically, shared-nothing was the first architecture to be implemented on the cloud, before the advent of shared cloud storage made shared-disk possible.

In practice, different layers of the database can have different architectures. It is now common to have a compute layer with a shared nothing architecture, and a storage layer with a shared disk architecture. This is for instance the case of Snowflake and AWS Aurora.

<doc id="41055" wikidata="Q1229614" url="?curid=41055" title="Distributed-queue dual-bus">
<text>In telecommunications, a distributed-queue dual-bus network (DQDB) is a distributed multi-access network that (a) supports integrated communications using a dual bus and distributed queuing, (b) provides access to local or metropolitan area networks, and (c) supports connectionless data transfer, connection-oriented data transfer, and isochronous communications, such as voice communications.

IEEE 802.6 is an example of a network providing DQDB access methods.

== Concept of operation ==
The DQDB medium access control (MAC) algorithm is generally credited to Robert Newman who developed this algorithm in his PhD thesis in the 1980s at the University of Western Australia. To appreciate the innovative value of the DQDB MAC algorithm, it must be seen against the background of LAN protocols at that time, which were based on broadcast (such as IEEE 802.3 Ethernet) or a ring (like IEEE 802.5 Token Ring and FDDI). The DQDB may be thought of as two token rings, one carrying data in each direction around the ring. This improves reliability which is important in Metropolitan Area Networks (MAN), where repairs may take longer than in a LAN and Wi-Fi because the damage may be inaccessible.

The DQDB standard IEEE 802.6 was developed while ATM (Broadband ISDN) was still in early development, but there was strong interaction between the two standards. ATM cells and DQDB frames were harmonized. They both settled on essentially a 48-byte data frame with a 5-byte header. In the DQDB algorithm, a distributed queue was implemented by communicating queue state information via the header. Each node in a DQDB network maintains a pair of state variables which represent its position in the distributed queue and the size of the queue. The headers on the reverse bus communicated requests to be inserted in the distributed queue so that upstream nodes would know that they should allow DQDB cells to pass unused on the forward bus. The algorithm was remarkable for its extreme simplicity.

Currently DQDB systems are being installed by many carriers in entire cities, with lengths that reach up to with speeds of a DS3 line (44.736 Mbit/s). Other implementations use optical fiber for a length of up to 100 km and speeds around 150 Mbit/s.

<doc id="41056" wikidata="Q5283180" url="?curid=41056" title="Distributed switching">
<text>Distributed switching is an architecture in which multiple processor-controlled switching units are distributed. There is often a hierarchy of switching elements, with a centralized host switch and with remote switches located close to concentrations of users.

== Use in telephony networks ==
Distributed switching is often used in telephone networks, though it is often called &quot;host-remote switching&quot;.

In rural areas, population centers tend to be too small for economical deployment of a full-featured dedicated telephone exchange, and distances between these centers make transmission costs relatively high. Normal telephone traffic patterns show that most calling is done between people in a community of interest, in this case a geographical one: the population center. Use of distributed switching allows for the majority of calls that are local to that population center to be switched there without needing to be transported to and from the host switch.

The host switch provides connectivity between the remote switches and to the larger network, and the host may also directly handle some rare and complex call types (conference calling, for example) that the remote itself is not equipped to handle. Host switches also perform OAM&amp;P (Operation, Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning) functions, including billing, for the entire cluster of the host and its remote switches.

A key capability of a remote switch is the ability to act in emergency standalone (ESA) mode, wherein local calls can still be placed even in the event that the connection between that remote and the host has been lost. In this mode, only local calling is available anyway, so the billing capability of the host switch is not required. ESA is increasingly available on digital loop carrier platforms as well as on purpose-built remote switches in order to improve the scope of their utility.

== Use within telecommunications equipment platforms ==
Many data-centric telecommunications platforms such as routers and Ethernet switches utilize distributed switching on separate cards within an equipment chassis. Even when this is used, it is common to have a centralized switching fabric to interconnect the distributed switches. This architecture has become less common as backplane bus speeds and centralized switch fabric capacities have increased.

<text>In telecommunications, diurnal phase shift is the phase shift of electromagnetic signals associated with daily changes in the ionosphere. The major changes usually occur during the period of time when sunrise or sunset is present at critical points along the path. Significant phase shifts may occur on paths wherein a reflection area of the path is subject to a large tidal range. In cable systems, significant phase shifts can be occasioned by diurnal temperature variance.

<text>For two connected exchanges in a communications network, a double-ended synchronization (also called double-ended control) is a synchronization control scheme in which the phase error signals used to control the clock at one telephone exchange are derived by comparison with the phase of the incoming digital signal and the phase of the internal clocks at both exchanges.

<text>Double-sideband reduced carrier transmission (DSB-RC): transmission in which (a) the frequencies produced by amplitude modulation are symmetrically spaced above and below the carrier and (b) the carrier level is reduced for transmission at a fixed level below that which is provided to the modulator. 

&quot;Note:&quot; In DSB-RC transmission, the carrier is usually transmitted at a level suitable for use as a reference by the receiver, except for the case in which it is reduced to the minimum practical level, i.e. the carrier is suppressed.

<text>Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission (DSB-SC) is transmission in which frequencies produced by amplitude modulation (AM) are symmetrically spaced above and below the carrier frequency and the carrier level is reduced to the lowest practical level, ideally being completely suppressed.
In the DSB-SC modulation, unlike in AM, the wave carrier is not transmitted; thus, much of the power is distributed between the side bands, which implies an increase of the cover in DSB-SC, compared to AM, for the same power use.

DSB-SC transmission is a special case of double-sideband reduced carrier transmission. It is used for radio data systems. This mode is frequently used in amateur radio voice communications, especially on high-frequency bands.

==Spectrum==
DSB-SC is basically an amplitude modulation wave without the carrier, therefore reducing power waste, giving it a 50% efficiency. This is an increase compared to normal AM transmission (DSB) that has a maximum efficiency of 33.333%, since 2/3 of the power is in the carrier which conveys no useful information and both sidebands containing identical copies of the same information. Single Side Band Suppressed Carrier (SSB-SC) is 100% efficient.

Spectrum plot of a DSB-SC signal:
==Generation==
DSB-SC is generated by a mixer. The signal produced is the product of the message signal and a carrier signal. The mathematical representation of this process is shown below, where the product-to-sum trigonometric identity is used.

:formula_1

==Demodulation==
For DSBSC, Coherent Demodulation is done by multiplying the DSB-SC signal with the carrier signal (with the same phase as in the modulation process) just like the modulation process. This resultant signal is then passed through a low pass filter to produce a scaled version of the original message signal.

:formula_2
::formula_3

The equation above shows that by multiplying the modulated signal by the carrier signal, the result is a scaled version of the original message signal plus a second term. Since formula_4, this second term is much higher in frequency than the original message. Once this signal passes through a low pass filter, the higher frequency component is removed, leaving just the original message.

===Distortion and attenuation===
For demodulation, the demodulation oscillator&#x27;s frequency and phase must be exactly the same as the modulation oscillator&#x27;s, otherwise, distortion and/or attenuation will occur.

To see this effect, take the following conditions:
*Message signal to be transmitted: formula_5
*Modulation (carrier) signal: formula_6
*Demodulation signal (with small frequency and phase deviations from the modulation signal): formula_7

The resultant signal can then be given by
:formula_8
::formula_9
::formula_10

The formula_11 terms results in distortion and attenuation of the original message signal. In particular, if the frequencies are correct, but the phase is wrong, contribution from formula_12 is a constant attenuation factor, also formula_13 represents a cyclic inversion of the recovered signal, which is a serious form of distortion.

== How it works ==
This is best shown graphically. Below is a message signal that one may wish to modulate onto a carrier, consisting of a couple of sinusoidal components with frequencies respectively 800 Hz and 1200 Hz.

The equation for this message signal is formula_14.

The carrier, in this case, is a plain 5 kHz (formula_15) sinusoid—pictured below.

The modulation is performed by multiplication in the time domain, which yields a 5 kHz carrier signal, whose amplitude varies in the same manner as the message signal.

formula_16

The name &quot;suppressed carrier&quot; comes about because the carrier signal component is suppressed—it does not appear in the output signal. This is apparent when the spectrum of the output signal is viewed. In the picture shown below we see four peaks, the two peaks below 5000 Hz are the lower sideband (LSB) and the two peaks above 5000 Hz are the upper sideband (USB), but there is no peak at the 5000 Hz mark, which is the frequency of the suppressed carrier.

<doc id="41068" wikidata="Q185789" url="?curid=41068" title="Drop (liquid)">
<text>A drop or droplet is a small column of liquid, bounded completely or almost completely by free surfaces. A drop may form when liquid accumulates at the end of a tube or other surface boundary, producing a hanging drop called a pendant drop. Drops may also be formed by the condensation of a vapor or by atomization of a larger mass of solid. Water vapor will condense into droplets depending on the temperature. The temperature at which droplets form is called the dew point.

== Surface tension ==
Liquid forms drops because it exhibits surface tension.

A simple way to form a drop is to allow liquid to flow slowly from the lower end of a vertical tube of small diameter. The surface tension of the liquid causes the liquid to hang from the tube, forming a pendant. When the drop exceeds a certain size it is no longer stable and detaches itself. The falling liquid is also a drop held together by surface tension.

=== Viscosity and pitch drop experiments===

Some substances that appear to be solid, can be shown to instead be extremely viscous liquids, because they form drops and display droplet behavior. In the famous pitch drop experiments, pitch – a substance somewhat like solid bitumen – is shown to be a liquid in this way. Pitch in a funnel slowly forms droplets, each droplet taking about 10 years to form and break off.

== Pendant drop test ==
In the pendant drop test, a drop of liquid is suspended from the end of a tube or by any surface by surface tension. The force due to surface tension is proportional to the length of the boundary between the liquid and the tube, with the proportionality constant usually denoted formula_1. Since the length of this boundary is the circumference of the tube, the force due to surface tension is given by

: formula_2

where &quot;d&quot; is the tube diameter.

The mass &quot;m&quot; of the drop hanging from the end of the tube can be found by equating the force due to gravity (formula_3) with the component of the surface tension in the vertical direction (formula_4) giving the formula

: formula_5

where α is the angle of contact with the tube&#x27;s front surface, and &quot;g&quot; is the acceleration due to gravity.

The limit of this formula, as α goes to 90°, gives the maximum weight of a pendant drop for a liquid with a given surface tension, formula_1.

: formula_7

This relationship is the basis of a convenient method of measuring surface tension, commonly used in the petroleum industry. More sophisticated methods are available to take account of the developing shape of the pendant as the drop grows. These methods are used if the surface tension is unknown.

== Drop adhesion to a solid ==
The drop adhesion to a solid can be divided into two categories: lateral adhesion and normal adhesion. Lateral adhesion resembles friction (though tribologically lateral adhesion is a more accurate term) and refers to the force required to slide a drop on the surface, namely the force to detach the drop from its position on the surface only to translate it to another position on the surface. Normal adhesion is the adhesion required to detach a drop from the surface in the normal direction, namely the force to cause the drop to fly off from the surface. The measurement of both adhesion forms can be done with the Centrifugal Adhesion Balance (CAB). The CAB uses a combination of centrifugal and gravitational forces to obtain any ratio of lateral and normal forces. For example, it can apply a normal force at zero lateral force for the drop to fly off away from the surface in the normal direction or it can induce a lateral force at zero normal force (simulating zero gravity).

== Droplet ==
The term droplet is a diminutive form of &#x27;drop&#x27; – and as a guide is typically used for liquid particles of less than 500 μm diameter. In spray application, droplets are usually described by their perceived size (i.e., diameter) whereas the dose (or number of infective particles in the case of biopesticides) is a function of their volume. This increases by a cubic function relative to diameter; thus, a 50 μm droplet represents a dose in 65 pl and a 500 μm drop represents a dose in 65 nanolitres.

== Speed ==
A droplet with a diameter of 3 mm has a terminal velocity of approximately 8 m/s.
Drops smaller than in diameter will attain 95% of their terminal velocity within . But above this size the distance to get to terminal velocity increases sharply. An example is a drop with a diameter of that may achieve this at .

== Optics ==
Due to the different refractive index of water and air, refraction and reflection occur on the surfaces of raindrops, leading to rainbow formation.

== Sound ==

The major source of sound when a droplet hits a liquid surface is the resonance of excited bubbles trapped underwater. These oscillating bubbles are responsible for most liquid sounds, such as running water or splashes, as they actually consist of many drop-liquid collisions.

=== &quot;Dripping tap&quot; noise prevention ===
Reducing the surface tension of a body of liquid makes possible to reduce or prevent noise due to droplets falling into it. This would involve adding soap, detergent or a similar substance to water. The reduced surface tension reduces the noise from dripping.

== Shape ==

The classic shape associated with a drop (with a pointy end in its upper side) comes from the observation of a droplet clinging to a surface. The shape of a drop falling through a gas is actually more or less spherical for drops less than 2 mm in diameter. Larger drops tend to be flatter on the bottom part due to the pressure of the gas they move through. As a result, as drops get larger, a concave depression forms which leads to the eventual breakup of the drop.

=== Capillary length ===
The capillary length is a length scaling factor that relates gravity, density, and surface tension, and is directly responsible for the shape a droplet for a specific fluid will take. The capillary length stems from the Laplace pressure, using the radius of the droplet.

Using the capillary length we can define microdrops and macrodrops. Microdrops are droplets with radius smaller than the capillary length, where the shape of the droplet is governed by surface tension and they form a more or less spherical cap shape. If a droplet has a radius larger than the capillary length, they are known as macrodrops and the gravitational forces will dominate. Macrodrops will be &#x27;flattened&#x27; by gravity and the height of the droplet will be reduced.
== Size ==
Raindrop sizes typically range from 0.5 mm to 4 mm, with size distributions quickly decreasing past diameters larger than 2–2.5 mm.

Scientists traditionally thought that the variation in the size of raindrops was due to collisions on the way down to the ground. In 2009, French researchers succeeded in showing that the distribution of sizes is due to the drops&#x27; interaction with air, which deforms larger drops and causes them to fragment into smaller drops, effectively limiting the largest raindrops to about 6 mm diameter. However, drops up to 10 mm (equivalent in volume to a sphere of radius 4.5 mm) are theoretically stable and could be levitated in a wind tunnel.
The largest recorded raindrop was 8.8 mm in diameter, located at the base of a cumulus congestus cloud in the vicinity of Kwajalein Atoll in July 1999. A raindrop of identical size was detected over northern Brazil in September 1995.

=== Standardized droplet sizes in medicine===

In medicine, this property is used to create droppers and IV infusion sets which have a standardized diameter, in such a way that 1 millilitre is equivalent to 20 drops. When smaller amounts are necessary (such as paediatrics), microdroppers or paediatric infusion sets are used, in which 1 millilitre = 60 microdrops.

<text>In a multichannel transmission system, drop and insert is a process that diverts (&quot;drop&quot;) a portion of the multiplexed aggregate signal at an intermediate point, and introduces (&quot;insert&quot;) a different signal for subsequent transmission in the same position.

Drop and insert is practiced, for example, in time-division multiplexing (TDM) when a time slot or frequency band is replaced from another source. The diverted signal may be demodulated or reinserted into another transmission system in the same or another time slot or frequency band. The time slot or frequency band vacated by the diverted signal need not necessarily be reoccupied by another signal. Likewise, a previously unoccupied time slot or frequency band may be occupied by a signal inserted at the drop-and-insert point.

Signals not of interest at the drop-and-insert point are not diverted.

<doc id="41073" wikidata="Q1141665" url="?curid=41073" title="Dual in-line package">
<text>In microelectronics, a dual in-line package (DIP or DIL) is an electronic component package with a rectangular housing and two parallel rows of electrical connecting pins. The package may be through-hole mounted to a printed circuit board (PCB) or inserted in a socket. The dual-inline format was invented by Don Forbes, Rex Rice and Bryant Rogers at Fairchild R&amp;D in 1964, when the restricted number of leads available on circular transistor-style packages became a limitation in the use of integrated circuits. Increasingly complex circuits required more signal and power supply leads (as observed in Rent&#x27;s rule); eventually microprocessors and similar complex devices required more leads than could be put on a DIP package, leading to development of higher-density chip carriers. Furthermore, square and rectangular packages made it easier to route printed-circuit traces beneath the packages.

A DIP is usually referred to as a DIP&quot;n&quot;, where &quot;n&quot; is the total number of pins, and sometimes appended with the row-to-row package width &quot;N&quot; for narrow (0.3&quot;) or &quot;W&quot; for wide (0.6&quot;). For example, a microcircuit package with two rows of seven vertical leads would be a DIP14 or DIP14N. The photograph at the upper right shows three DIP14 ICs. Common packages have as few as three and as many as 64 leads. Many analog and digital integrated circuit types are available in DIP packages, as are arrays of transistors, switches, light emitting diodes, and resistors. DIP plugs for ribbon cables can be used with standard IC sockets.

DIP packages are usually made from an opaque molded epoxy plastic pressed around a tin-, silver-, or gold-plated lead frame that supports the device die and provides connection pins. Some types of IC are made in ceramic DIP packages, where high temperature or high reliability is required, or where the device has an optical window to the interior of the package. Most DIP packages are secured to a PCB by inserting the pins through holes in the board and soldering them in place. Where replacement of the parts is necessary, such as in test fixtures or where programmable devices must be removed for changes, a DIP socket is used. Some sockets include a zero insertion force (ZIF) mechanism.

Variations of the DIP package include those with only a single row of pins, e.g. a resistor array, possibly including a heat sink tab in place of the second row of pins, and types with four rows of pins, two rows, staggered, on each side of the package. DIP packages have been mostly displaced by surface-mount package types, which avoid the expense of drilling holes in a PCB and which allow higher density of interconnections.

==Applications==

===Types of devices===
DIPs are commonly used for integrated circuits (ICs). Other devices in DIP packages include resistor networks, DIP switches, LED segmented and bar graph displays, and electromechanical relays.

DIP connector plugs for ribbon cables are common in computers and other electronic equipment.

Dallas Semiconductor manufactured integrated DIP real-time clock (RTC) modules which contained an IC chip and a non-replaceable 10-year lithium battery.

DIP header blocks on to which discrete components could be soldered were used where groups of components needed to be easily removed, for configuration changes, optional features or calibration.

===Uses===

The original dual-in-line package was invented by Bryant &quot;Buck&quot; Rogers in 1964 while working for Fairchild Semiconductor. The first devices had 14 pins and looked much like they do today. The rectangular shape allowed integrated circuits to be packaged more densely than previous round packages. The package was well-suited to automated assembly equipment; a PCB could be populated with scores or hundreds of ICs, then all the components on the circuit board could be soldered at one time on a wave soldering machine and passed on to automated testing machines, with very little human labor required. DIP packages were still large with respect to the integrated circuits within them. By the end of the 20th century, surface-mount packages allowed further reduction in the size and weight of systems. DIP chips are still popular for circuit prototyping on a breadboard because of how easily they can be inserted and used there.

DIPs were the mainstream of the microelectronics industry in the 1970s and 1980s. Their use has declined in the first decade of the 21st century due to the emerging new surface-mount technology (SMT) packages such as plastic leaded chip carrier (PLCC) and small-outline integrated circuit (SOIC), though DIPs continued in extensive use through the 1990s, and still continue to be used today. Because some modern chips are available only in surface-mount package types, a number of companies sell various prototyping adapters to allow those surface-mount devices (SMD) to be used like DIP devices with through-hole breadboards and soldered prototyping boards (such as stripboard and perfboard). (SMT can pose quite a problem, at least an inconvenience, for prototyping in general; most of the characteristics of SMT that are advantages for mass production are difficulties for prototyping.)

For programmable devices like EPROMs and GALs, DIPs remained popular for many years due to their easy handling with external programming circuitry (i.e., the DIP devices could be simply plugged into a socket on the programming device.) However, with In-System Programming (ISP) technology now state of the art, this advantage of DIPs is rapidly losing importance as well.

Through the 1990s, devices with fewer than 20 leads were manufactured in a DIP format in addition to the newer formats. Since about 2000, newer devices are often unavailable in the DIP format.

===Mounting===
DIPs can be mounted either by through-hole soldering or in sockets. Sockets allow easy replacement of a device and eliminates the risk of damage from overheating during soldering. Generally sockets were used for high-value or large ICs, which cost much more than the socket. Where devices would be frequently inserted and removed, such as in test equipment or EPROM programmers, a zero insertion force socket would be used.

DIPs are also used with breadboards, a temporary mounting arrangement for education, design development or device testing. Some hobbyists, for one-off construction or permanent prototyping, use point-to-point wiring with DIPs, and their appearance when physically inverted as part of this method inspires the informal term &quot;dead bug style&quot; for the method.

==Construction==
The body (housing) of a DIP containing an IC chip is usually made from molded plastic or ceramic. The hermetic nature of a ceramic housing is preferred for extremely high reliability devices. However, the vast majority of DIPs are manufactured via a thermoset molding process in which an epoxy mold compound is heated and transferred under pressure to encapsulate the device. Typical cure cycles for the resins are less than 2 minutes and a single cycle may produce hundreds of devices.

The leads emerge from the longer sides of the package along the seam, parallel to the top and bottom planes of the package, and are bent downward approximately 90 degrees (or slightly less, leaving them angled slightly outward from the centerline of the package body). (The SOIC, the SMT package that most resembles a typical DIP, appears essentially the same, notwithstanding size scale, except that after being bent down the leads are bent upward again by an equal angle to become parallel with the bottom plane of the package.) In ceramic (CERDIP) packages, an epoxy or grout is used to hermetically seal the two halves together, providing an air and moisture tight seal to protect the IC die inside. Plastic DIP (PDIP) packages are usually sealed by fusing or cementing the plastic halves around the leads, but a high degree of hermeticity is not achieved because the plastic itself is usually somewhat porous to moisture and the process cannot ensure a good microscopic seal between the leads and the plastic at all points around the perimeter. However, contaminants are usually still kept out well enough that the device can operate reliably for decades with reasonable care in a controlled environment.

Inside the package, the lower half has the leads embedded, and at the center of the package is a rectangular space, chamber, or void into which the IC die is cemented. The leads of the package extend diagonally inside the package from their positions of emergence along the periphery to points along a rectangular perimeter surrounding the die, tapering as they go to become fine contacts at the die. Ultra-fine bond wires (barely visible to the naked human eye) are welded between these die periphery contacts and bond pads on the die itself, connecting one lead to each bond pad, and making the final connection between the microcircuits and the external DIP leads. The bond wires are not usually taut but loop upward slightly to allow slack for thermal expansion and contraction of the materials; if a single bond wire breaks or detaches, the entire IC may become useless. The top of the package covers all of this delicate assemblage without crushing the bond wires, protecting it from contamination by foreign materials.

Usually, a company logo, alphanumeric codes and sometimes words are printed on top of the package to identify its manufacturer and type, when it was made (usually as a year and a week number), sometimes where it was made, and other proprietary information (perhaps revision numbers, manufacturing plant codes, or stepping ID codes.)

The necessity of laying out all of the leads in a basically radial pattern in a single plane from the die perimeter to two rows on the periphery of the package is the main reason that DIP packages with higher lead counts must have wider spacing between the lead rows, and it effectively limits the number of leads which a practical DIP package may have. Even for a very small die with many bond pads (e.g. a chip with 15 inverters, requiring 32 leads), a wider DIP would still be required to accommodate the radiating leads internally. This is one of the reasons that four-sided and multiple rowed packages, such as PGAs, were introduced (around the early 1980s).

A large DIP package (such as the DIP64 used for the Motorola 68000 CPU) has long leads inside the package between pins and the die, making such a package unsuitable for high speed devices.

Some other types of DIP devices are built very differently. Most of these have molded plastic housings and straight leads or leads that extend directly out of the bottom of the package. For some, LED displays particularly, the housing is usually a hollow plastic box with the bottom/back open, filled (around the contained electronic components) with a hard translucent epoxy material from which the leads emerge. Others, such as DIP switches, are composed of two (or more) plastic housing parts snapped, welded, or glued together around a set of contacts and tiny mechanical parts, with the leads emerging through molded-in holes or notches in the plastic.

===Variants===
Several DIP variants for ICs exist, mostly distinguished by packaging material:
* Ceramic dual in-line package (CERDIP or CDIP)
* Plastic dual in-line package (PDIP)
* Shrink plastic dual in-line package (SPDIP) – A denser version of the PDIP with a 0.07 in (1.778 mm) lead pitch.
* Skinny dual in-line package (SDIP or SPDIP) – Sometimes used to refer to a &quot;narrow&quot; 0.300 in. (or 300 mil) wide DIP, normally when clarification is needed e.g. for DIP with 24 pins or more, which usually come in &quot;wide&quot; 0.600 in wide DIP package. An example of a typical proper full spec for a &quot;narrow&quot; DIP package would be 300 mil body width, pin pitch.

EPROMs were sold in ceramic DIPs manufactured with a circular window of clear quartz over the chip die to allow the part to be erased by ultraviolet light. Often, the same chips were also sold in less expensive windowless PDIP or CERDIP packages as one-time programmable (OTP) versions. Windowed and windowless packages were also used for microcontrollers, and other devices, containing EPROM memory. Windowed CERDIP-packaged EPROMs were used for the BIOS ROM of many early IBM PC clones with an adhesive label covering the window to prevent inadvertent erasure through exposure to ambient light.

Molded plastic DIPs are much lower in cost than ceramic packages; one 1979 study showed that a plastic 14 pin DIP cost around US$0.063 and a ceramic package cost US$0.82.

===Single in-line===

A single in-line package (SIP or SIL package) has one row of connecting pins. It is not as popular as the DIP, but has been used for packaging RAM chips and multiple resistors with a common pin. As compared to DIPs with a typical maximum pin count of 64, SIPs have a typical maximum pin count of 24 with lower package costs.

One variant of the single in-line package uses part of the lead frame for a heat sink tab. This multi-leaded power package is useful for such applications as audio power amplifiers, for example.

===Quad in-line===

The QIP, sometimes called a &quot;QIL package&quot;, has the same dimensions as a DIL package, but the leads on each side are bent into an alternating zigzag configuration so as to fit four lines of solder pads (instead of two with a DIL). The QIL design increased the spacing between solder pads without increasing package size, for two reasons: 
# It allowed more reliable soldering. This may seem odd today, given the far closer solder pad spacing in use now, but in the 1970s, the heyday of the QIL, bridging of neighbouring solder pads on DIL chips was an issue at times,
# QIL also increased the possibility of running a copper track between 2 solder pads. This was very handy on the then standard single sided single layer PCBs.

===Lead count and spacing===
Commonly found DIP packages that conform to JEDEC standards use an inter-lead spacing (lead pitch) of (JEDEC MS-001BA). Row spacing varies depending on lead counts, with 0.3 in. (7.62 mm) (JEDEC MS-001) or 0.6 inch (15.24 mm) (JEDEC MS-011) the most common. Less common standardized row spacings include 0.4 inch (10.16 mm) (JEDEC MS-010) and 0.9 inch (22.86 mm), as well as a row spacing of 0.3 inch, 0.6 inch or 0.75 inch with a 0.07 inch (1.778 mm) lead pitch.

The former Soviet Union and Eastern bloc countries used similar packages, but with a metric pin-to-pin spacing of 2.5 mm rather than .

The number of leads is always even. For 0.3 inch spacing, typical lead counts are 8, 14, 16, and 20; less common are 4, 6, 18, 24, and 28 lead counts. To have an even number of leads some DIPs have unused not connected (NC) leads to the internal chip, or are duplicated, e.g. two ground pins. For 0.6 inch spacing, typical lead counts are 24, 28, 32, and 40; less common are 36, 42, 48, 52, and 64 lead counts. Some microprocessors, such as the Motorola 68000 and Zilog Z180, used lead counts as high as 64; this is typically the maximum number of leads for a DIP package.

==Orientation and lead numbering==
As shown in the diagram, leads are numbered consecutively from Pin 1. When the identifying notch in the package is at the top, Pin 1 is the top left corner of the device. Sometimes Pin 1 is identified with an indent or paint dot mark.

For example, for a 14-lead DIP, with the notch at the top, the left leads are numbered from 1 to 7 (top to bottom) and the right row of leads are numbered 8 to 14 (bottom to top).

Leads are skipped on some DIP devices (e.g. segmented LED displays, relays, or devices that replace leads with a heat sink fin). The remaining leads are numbered as if all positions had leads.

In addition to providing for human visual identification of the orientation of the package, the notch allows automated chip-insertion machinery to confirm correct orientation of the chip by mechanical sensing.

==Descendants==
The SOIC (Small Outline IC), a surface-mount package which is currently very popular, particularly in consumer electronics and personal computers, is essentially a shrunk version of the standard IC PDIP, the fundamental difference which makes it an SMT device being a second bend in the leads to flatten them parallel to the bottom plane of the plastic housing. The SOJ (Small Outline J-lead) and other SMT packages with &quot;SOP&quot; (for &quot;Small Outline Package&quot;) in their names can be considered further relatives of the DIP, their original ancestor. SOIC packages tend to have half the pitch of DIP, and SOP are half that, a fourth of DIP. (0.1&quot;/2.54 mm, 0.05&quot;/1.27 mm, and 0.025&quot;/0.635 mm, respectively)

Pin grid array (PGA) packages may be considered to have evolved from the DIP. PGAs with the same pin centers as most DIPs were popular for microprocessors from the early to mid-1980s through the 1990s. Owners of personal computers containing Intel 80286 through P5 Pentium processors may be most familiar with these PGA packages, which were often inserted into ZIF sockets on motherboards. The similarity is such that a PGA socket may be physically compatible with some DIP devices, though the converse is rarely true.

<text>A duplexer is an electronic device that allows bi-directional (duplex) communication over a single path. In radar and radio communications systems, it isolates the receiver from the transmitter while permitting them to share a common antenna. Most radio repeater systems include a duplexer. Duplexers can be based on frequency (often a waveguide filter), polarization (such as an orthomode transducer), or timing (as is typical in radar).

==Types==

===Transmit-receive switch===

In radar, a transmit/receive (TR) switch alternately connects the transmitter and receiver to a shared antenna. In the simplest arrangement, the switch consists of a gas-discharge tube across the input terminals of the receiver. When the transmitter is active, the resulting high voltage causes the tube to conduct, shorting together the receiver terminals to protect it, while its complementary, the anti-transmit/receive (ATR) switch, is a similar discharge tube which decouples the transmitter from the antenna while not operating, to prevent it from wasting received energy.

===Circulator===
===Hybrid===
A hybrid, such as a magic T, may be used as a duplexer by terminating the fourth port in a matched load.
This arrangement suffers from the disadvantage that half of the transmitter power is lost in the matched load, while thermal noise in the load is delivered to the receiver.

===Orthomode transducer===
===Frequency domain===
In radio communications (as opposed to radar), the transmitted and received signals can occupy different frequency bands, and so may be separated by frequency-selective filters. These are effectively a higher-performance version of a diplexer, typically with a narrow split between the two frequencies in question (typically around 2%-5% for a commercial two-way radio system).

With a duplexer the high- and low-frequency signals are traveling in opposite directions at the shared port of the duplexer.

Modern duplexers often use nearby frequency bands, so the frequency separation between the two ports is also much less. For example, the transition between the uplink and downlink bands in the GSM frequency bands may be about one percent (915 MHz to 925 MHz). Significant attenuation (isolation) is needed to prevent the transmitter&#x27;s output from overloading the receiver&#x27;s input, so such duplexers employ multi-pole filters. Duplexers are commonly made for use on the 30-50 MHz (&quot;low band&quot;), 136-174 MHz (&quot;high band&quot;), 380-520 MHz (&quot;UHF&quot;), plus the 790–862 MHz (&quot;800&quot;), 896-960 MHz (&quot;900&quot;) and 1215-1300 MHz (&quot;1200&quot;) bands.

There are two predominant types of duplexer in use - &quot;notch duplexers&quot;, which exhibit sharp notches at the &quot;unwanted&quot; frequencies and only pass through a narrow band of wanted frequencies and &quot;bandpass duplexers&quot;, which have wide-pass frequency ranges and high out-of-band attenuation.

On shared-antenna sites, the bandpass duplexer variety is greatly preferred because this virtually eliminates interference between transmitters and receivers by removing out-of-band transmit emissions and considerably improving the selectivity of receivers. Most professionally engineered sites ban the use of notch duplexers and insist on bandpass duplexers for this reason.

&quot;Note 1:&quot; A duplexer must be designed for operation in the frequency band used by the receiver and transmitter, and must be capable of handling the output power of the transmitter.

&quot;Note 2:&quot; A duplexer must provide adequate rejection of transmitter noise occurring at the receive frequency, and must be designed to operate at, or less than, the frequency separation between the transmitter and receiver.

&quot;Note 3:&quot; A duplexer must provide sufficient isolation to prevent receiver desensitization.

==History==
The first duplexers were invented for use on the electric telegraph and were known as &quot;duplex&quot; rather than &quot;duplexer&quot;. They were an early form of the hybrid coil. The telegraph companies were keen to have such a device since the ability to have simultaneous traffic in both directions had the potential to save the cost of thousands of miles of telegraph wire. The first of these devices was designed in 1853 by Julius Wilhelm Gintl of the Austrian State Telegraph. Gintl&#x27;s design was not very successful. Further attempts were made by Carl Frischen of Hanover with an artificial line to balance the real line as well as by Siemens &amp; Halske, who bought and modified Frischen&#x27;s design. The first truly successful duplex was designed by Joseph Barker Stearns of Boston in 1872. This was further developed into the quadruplex telegraph by Thomas Edison. The device is estimated to have saved Western Union $500,000 per year in construction of new telegraph lines.

The first duplexers for radar, sometimes referred to as Transmit/Receive Switches, were invented by Robert Morris Page and Leo C. Young of the United States Naval Research Laboratory in July 1936.

<text>A duty cycle or power cycle is the fraction of one period in which a signal or system is active. Duty cycle is commonly expressed as a percentage or a ratio. A period is the time it takes for a signal to complete an on-and-off cycle. As a formula, a duty cycle (%) may be expressed as:

:formula_1
Equally, a duty cycle (ratio) may be expressed as:

:formula_2

where formula_3 is the duty cycle, formula_4 is the pulse width (pulse active time), and formula_5 is the total period of the signal. Thus, a 60% duty cycle means the signal is on 60% of the time but off 40% of the time. The &quot;on time&quot; for a 60% duty cycle could be a fraction of a second, a day, or even a week, depending on the length of the period.

Duty cycles can be used to describe the percent time of an active signal in an electrical device such as the power switch in a switching power supply or the firing of action potentials by a living system such as a neuron.

Some publications use formula_6 as the symbol for duty cycle.

As a ratio, duty cycle is unitless and may be given as decimal fraction and percentage alike.

An alternative term in use is duty factor.

== Applications ==

=== Electrical and electronics ===
In electronics, duty cycle is the percentage of the ratio of pulse duration, or pulse width (PW) to the total period (T) of the waveform. It is generally used to represent time duration of a pulse when it is high (1). In digital electronics, signals are used in rectangular waveform which are represented by logic 1 and logic 0. Logic 1 stands for presence of an electric pulse and 0 for absence of an electric pulse. For example, a signal (10101010) has 50% duty cycle, because the pulse remains high for 1/2 of the period or low for 1/2 of the period. Similarly, for pulse (10001000) the duty cycle will be 25% because the pulse remains high only for 1/4 of the period and remains low for 3/4 of the period.
Electrical motors typically use less than a 100% duty cycle. For example, if a motor runs for one out of 100 seconds, or 1/100 of the time, then, its duty cycle is 1/100, or 1 percent.

Pulse-width modulation (PWM) is used in a variety of electronic situations, such as power delivery and voltage regulation.

In electronic music, music synthesizers vary the duty cycle of their audio-frequency oscillators to obtain a subtle effect on the tone colors. This technique is known as pulse-width modulation.

In the printer / copier industry, the duty cycle specification refers to the rated throughput (that is, printed pages) of a device per month.

In a welding power supply, the maximum duty cycle is defined as the percentage of time in a 10-minute period that it can be operated continuously before overheating.

=== Biological systems ===
The concept of duty cycles is also used to describe the activity of neurons and muscle fibers. In neural circuits for example, a duty cycle specifically refers to the proportion of a cycle period in which a neuron remains active.

=== Generation ===
One way to generate fairly accurate square wave signals with 1/&quot;n&quot; duty factor, where &quot;n&quot; is an integer, is to vary the duty cycle until the &quot;n&quot;th-harmonic is significantly suppressed. For audio-band signals, this can even be done &quot;by ear&quot;; for example, a -40 dB reduction in the 3rd harmonic corresponds to setting the duty factor to 1/3 with a precision of 1% and -60 dB reduction corresponds to a precision of 0.1%.

=== Mark-space ratio ===
 Mark-space ratio, or mark-to-space ratio, is another term for the same concept, to describe the temporal relationship between two alternating periods of a waveform. However, whereas the duty cycle relates the duration of one period to the duration of the entire cycle, the mark-space ratio relates the durations of the two individual periods:

:formula_7

where formula_8 and formula_9 are the durations of the two alternating periods.

<doc id="41079" wikidata="Q1161699" url="?curid=41079" title="Dynamic range">
<text>Dynamic range (abbreviated DR, DNR, or DYR) is the ratio between the largest and smallest measurable values of a specific quantity. It is often used in the context of signals, like sound and light. It is measured either as a ratio or as a base-10 (decibel) or base-2 (doublings, bits or stops) logarithmic value of the ratio between the largest and smallest signal values.

Electronically reproduced audio and video is often processed to fit the original material with a wide dynamic range into a narrower recorded dynamic range for easier storage and reproduction. This process is called dynamic range compression.

==Human perception==

The human senses of sight and hearing have a relatively high dynamic range. However, a human cannot perform these feats of perception at both extremes of the scale at the same time. The human eye takes time to adjust to different light levels, and its dynamic range in a given scene is actually quite limited due to optical glare. The instantaneous dynamic range of human audio perception is similarly subject to masking so that, for example, a whisper cannot be heard in loud surroundings.

A human is capable of hearing (and usefully discerning) anything from a quiet murmur in a soundproofed room to the loudest heavy metal concert. Such a difference can exceed 100 dB which represents a factor of 100,000 in amplitude and a factor 10,000,000,000 in power. The dynamic range of human hearing is roughly 140 dB, varying with frequency, from the threshold of hearing (around −9 dB SPL at 3 kHz) to the threshold of pain (from 120 to 140 dB SPL). This wide dynamic range cannot be perceived all at once, however; the tensor tympani, stapedius muscle, and outer hair cells all act as mechanical dynamic range compressors to adjust the sensitivity of the ear to different ambient levels.

A human can see objects in starlight or in bright sunlight, even though on a moonless night objects receive one billionth (10−9) of the illumination they would on a bright sunny day; a dynamic range of 90 dB. Change of sensitivity is achieved in part through adjustments of the iris and slow chemical changes, which take some time.

In practice, it is difficult for humans to achieve the full dynamic experience using electronic equipment. For example, a good quality liquid-crystal display (LCD) has a dynamic range limited to around 1000:1, and some of the latest CMOS image sensors now have measured dynamic ranges of about 23,000:1. Paper reflectance can produce a dynamic range of about 100:1. A professional video camera such as the Sony Digital Betacam achieves a dynamic range of greater than 90 dB in audio recording.

== Audio ==
Audio engineers use &quot;dynamic range&quot; to describe the ratio of the amplitude of the loudest possible undistorted signal to the noise floor, say of a microphone or loudspeaker. Dynamic range is therefore the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the case where the signal is the loudest possible for the system. For example, if the ceiling of a device is 5 V (rms) and the noise floor is 10 μV (rms) then the dynamic range is 500000:1, or 114 dB:

formula_1

In digital audio theory the dynamic range is limited by quantization error. The maximum achievable dynamic range for a digital audio system with &quot;Q&quot;-bit uniform quantization is calculated as the ratio of the largest sine-wave rms to rms noise is:

formula_2

However, the usable dynamic range may be greater, as a properly dithered recording device can record signals well below the noise floor.

The 16-bit compact disc has a theoretical undithered dynamic range of about 96 dB; however, the &quot;perceived&quot; dynamic range of 16-bit audio can be 120 dB or more with noise-shaped dither, taking advantage of the frequency response of the human ear.

Digital audio with undithered 20-bit quantization is theoretically capable of 120 dB dynamic range, while 24-bit digital audio affords 144 dB dynamic range. Most Digital audio workstations process audio with 32-bit floating-point representation which affords even higher dynamic range and so loss of dynamic range is no longer a concern in terms of digital audio processing. Dynamic range limitations typically result from improper gain staging, recording technique including ambient noise and intentional application of dynamic range compression.

Dynamic range in analog audio is the difference between low-level thermal noise in the electronic circuitry and high-level signal saturation resulting in increased distortion and, if pushed higher, clipping. Multiple noise processes determine the noise floor of a system. Noise can be picked up from microphone self-noise, preamp noise, wiring and interconnection noise, media noise, etc.

Early 78 rpm phonograph discs had a dynamic range of up to 40 dB, soon reduced to 30 dB and worse due to wear from repeated play. Vinyl microgroove phonograph records typically yield 55-65 dB, though the first play of the higher-fidelity outer rings can achieve a dynamic range of 70 dB.

German magnetic tape in 1941 was reported to have had a dynamic range of 60 dB, though modern-day restoration experts of such tapes note 45-50 dB as the observed dynamic range. Ampex tape recorders in the 1950s achieved 60 dB in practical usage, In the 1960s, improvements in tape formulation processes resulted in 7 dB greater range, and Ray Dolby developed the Dolby A-Type noise reduction system that increased low- and mid-frequency dynamic range on magnetic tape by 10 dB, and high-frequency by 15 dB, using companding (compression and expansion) of four frequency bands. The peak of professional analog magnetic recording tape technology reached 90 dB dynamic range in the midband frequencies at 3% distortion, or about 80 dB in practical broadband applications. The Dolby SR noise reduction system gave a 20 dB further increased range resulting in 110 dB in the midband frequencies at 3% distortion.

Compact Cassette tape performance ranges from 50 to 56 dB depending on tape formulation, with type IV tape tapes giving the greatest dynamic range, and systems such as XDR, dbx and Dolby noise reduction system increasing it further. Specialized bias and record head improvements by Nakamichi and Tandberg combined with Dolby C noise reduction yielded 72 dB dynamic range for the cassette.

A dynamic microphone is able to withstand high sound intensity and can have a dynamic range of up to 140 dB. Condenser microphones are also rugged but their dynamic range may be limited by the overloading of their associated electronic circuitry. Practical considerations of acceptable distortion levels in microphones combined with typical practices in a recording studio result in a useful dynamic range of 125 dB.

In 1981, researchers at Ampex determined that a dynamic range of 118 dB on a dithered digital audio stream was necessary for subjective noise-free playback of music in quiet listening environments.

Since the early 1990s, it has been recommended by several authorities, including the Audio Engineering Society, that measurements of dynamic range be made with an audio signal present, which is then filtered out in the noise floor measurement used in determining dynamic range. This avoids questionable measurements based on the use of blank media, or muting circuits.

The term &quot;dynamic range&quot; may be confusing in audio production because it has two conflicting definitions, particularly in the understanding of the loudness war phenomenon. &quot;Dynamic range&quot; may refer to micro-dynamics, related to crest factor, whereas the European Broadcasting Union, in EBU3342 Loudness Range, defines &quot;dynamic range&quot; as the difference between the quietest and loudest volume, a matter of macro-dynamics.

== Electronics ==
In electronics dynamic range is used in the following contexts: 
* Specifies the ratio of a maximum level of a parameter, such as power, current, voltage or frequency, to the minimum detectable value of that parameter. (See Audio system measurements.)
* In a transmission system, the ratio of the overload level (the maximum signal power that the system can tolerate without distortion of the signal) to the noise level of the system. 
* In digital systems or devices, the ratio of maximum and minimum signal levels required to maintain a specified bit error ratio.
* Optimization of bit width of digital data path (according to the dynamic ranges of signal) can reduce the area, cost, and power consumption of digital circuits and systems while improving their performance. Optimal bit width for a digital data path is the smallest bit width that can satisfy the required signal-to-noise ratio and also avoid overflow.

In audio and electronics applications, the ratio involved is often large enough that it is converted to a logarithm and specified in decibels.

== Metrology ==

In metrology, such as when performed in support of science, engineering or manufacturing objectives, dynamic range refers to the range of values that can be measured by a sensor or metrology instrument. Often this dynamic range of measurement is limited at one end of the range by saturation of a sensing signal sensor or by physical limits that exist on the motion or other response capability of a mechanical indicator. The other end of the dynamic range of measurement is often limited by one or more sources of random noise or uncertainty in signal levels that may be described as defining the sensitivity of the sensor or metrology device. When digital sensors or sensor signal converters are a component of the sensor or metrology device, the dynamic range of measurement will be also related to the number of binary digits (bits) used in a digital numeric representation in which the measured value is linearly related to the digital number. For example, a 12-bit digital sensor or converter can provide a dynamic range in which the ratio of the maximum measured value to the minimum measured value is up to 212 = 4096.

Metrology systems and devices may use several basic methods to increase their basic dynamic range. These methods include averaging and other forms of filtering, correction of receivers characteristics, repetition of measurements, nonlinear transformations to avoid saturation, etc. In more advance forms of metrology, such as multiwavelength digital holography, interferometry measurements made at different scales (different wavelengths) can be combined to retain the same low-end resolution while extending the upper end of the dynamic range of measurement by orders of magnitude.

== Music ==
In music, dynamic range describes the difference between the quietest and loudest volume of an instrument, part or piece of music. In modern recording, this range is often limited through dynamic range compression, which allows for louder volume, but can make the recording sound less exciting or live.

The dynamic range of music as normally perceived in a concert hall does not exceed 80 dB, and human speech is normally perceived over a range of about 40 dB.

== Photography ==
Photographers use &quot;dynamic range&quot; to describe the luminance range of a scene being photographed, or the limits of luminance range that a given digital camera or film can capture, or the opacity range of developed film images, or the reflectance range of images on photographic papers.

The dynamic range of digital photography is comparable to the capabilities of photographic film and both are comparable to the capabilities of the human eye.

There are photographic techniques that support even higher dynamic range. 
*Graduated neutral density filters are used to decrease the dynamic range of scene luminance that can be captured on photographic film (or on the image sensor of a digital camera): The filter is positioned in front of the lens at the time the exposure is made; the top half is dark and the bottom half is clear. The dark area is placed over a scene&#x27;s high-intensity region, such as the sky. The result is more even exposure in the focal plane, with increased detail in the shadows and low-light areas. Though this does not increase the fixed dynamic range available at the film or sensor, it stretches usable dynamic range in practice.
*High-dynamic-range imaging overcomes the limited dynamic range of the sensor by selectively combining multiple exposures of the same scene in order to retain detail in light and dark areas. Tone mapping maps the image differently in shadow and highlights in order to better distribute the lighting range across the image. The same approach has been used in chemical photography to capture an extremely wide dynamic range: A three-layer film with each underlying layer at one hundredth (10−2) the sensitivity of the next higher one has, for example, been used to record nuclear-weapons tests.

Consumer-grade image file formats sometimes restrict dynamic range. The most severe dynamic-range limitation in photography may not involve encoding, but rather reproduction to, say, a paper print or computer screen. In that case, not only local tone mapping but also &quot;dynamic range adjustment&quot; can be effective in revealing detail throughout light and dark areas: The principle is the same as that of dodging and burning (using different lengths of exposures in different areas when making a photographic print) in the chemical darkroom. The principle is also similar to gain riding or automatic level control in audio work, which serves to keep a signal audible in a noisy listening environment and to avoid peak levels that overload the reproducing equipment, or which are unnaturally or uncomfortably loud.

If a camera sensor is incapable of recording the full dynamic range of a scene, high-dynamic-range (HDR) techniques may be used in postprocessing, which generally involve combining multiple exposures using software.

<text>In Greek mythology, Echo (; , &quot;Ēkhō&quot;, &quot;echo&quot;, from ἦχος (&quot;ēchos&quot;), &quot;sound&quot;) was an Oread who resided on Mount Cithaeron. Zeus loved consorting with beautiful nymphs and often visited them on Earth. Eventually, Zeus&#x27;s wife, Hera, became suspicious, and came from Mount Olympus in an attempt to catch Zeus with the nymphs. Echo, by trying to protect Zeus (as he had ordered her to do), endured Hera&#x27;s wrath, and Hera made her only able to speak the last words spoken to her. So when Echo met Narcissus and fell in love with him, she was unable to tell him how she felt and was forced to watch him as he fell in love with himself.

==Classical depiction==
===&quot;Metamorphoses&quot;===
In &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; (8 AD), the poet Ovid tells of Juno (Hera in Greek mythology) and the jealousy she felt over her husband Jupiter&#x27;s (Zeus in Greek mythology) many affairs. Though vigilant, whenever she was about to catch him, Echo distracted her with lengthy conversations. When at last Juno realized the truth, she cursed Echo. From that moment on, the once loquacious nymph could only repeat the most recently spoken words of another person.

Sometime after being cursed, Echo spied a young man, Narcissus, while he was out hunting deer with his companions. She immediately fell in love with him and, infatuated, followed quietly. The more she looked at the young man, the more she longed for him. Though she wished with all her heart to call out to Narcissus, Juno&#x27;s curse prevented her.

During the hunt, Narcissus became separated from his companions and called out, &quot;is anyone there&quot; and heard the nymph repeat his words. Startled, Narcissus answered the voice, ‘come here,’ only to be told the same. When Narcissus saw that nobody had emerged from the glade, he concluded that the owner of the voice must be running away from him and called out again. Finally, he shouted, &quot;This way, we must come together.&quot; Taking this to be a reciprocation of her love, Echo concurred ecstatically, &quot;We must come together!&quot;

In her delight, Echo rushed to Narcissus ready to throw her arms around her beloved. Narcissus, however, was appalled and, spurning her, exclaimed, ‘Hands off! May I die before you enjoy my body.’ All Echo could whisper in reply was, ‘enjoy my body’ and having done so she fled, scorned, humiliated, and shamed.

Despite the harshness of his rejection, Echo&#x27;s love for Narcissus only grew. When Narcissus died, wasting away before his own reflection, consumed by a love that could not be, Echo mourned over his body. When Narcissus, looking one last time into the pool uttered, &quot;Oh marvellous boy, I loved you in vain, farewell&quot;, Echo too chorused, &quot;Farewell.&quot;

Eventually, Echo, too, began to waste away. Her beauty faded, her skin shrivelled, and her bones turned to stone. Today, all that remains of Echo is the sound of her voice.

===&quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot;===
The tale of &quot;Daphnis and Chloe&quot; is a 2nd-century romance by Greek author Longus. At one point in the novel, Daphnis and Chloe are staring out at the boats gliding across the sea. Chloe, having never heard an echo before, is confused on hearing the fisherman&#x27;s song repeated in a nearby valley. Daphnis promises to tell her the story of Echo in exchange for ten more kisses.

Daphnis’ rendition differs radically from Ovid&#x27;s account. According to Daphnis, Echo was raised among the Nymphæ because her mother was a nymph. Her father, however, was merely a man and hence Echo was not herself a nymph but mortal. Echo spent her days dancing with the Nymphae and singing with the Muses who taught her all manner of musical instruments. Pan then grew angry with her, envious of her musical virtuosity and covetous of her virginity, which she would yield neither to men nor gods. Pan drove the men of the fields mad, and, like wild animals, they tore Echo apart and scattered the still singing fragments of her body across the earth.

Showing favour to the Nymphae, Gaia hid the shreds of Echo within herself providing shelter for her music and at the Muses’ command, Echo&#x27;s body will still sing, imitating with perfect likeness the sound of any earthly thing. Daphnis recounts that Pan himself often hears his very own pipes and, giving chase across the mountains, looks in vain for the secret student he can never find.

===Other===
Both the &quot;Homeric Hymn&quot; and &quot;Orphic Hymn&quot; to Pan reiterate Longus&#x27; tale of Pan chasing Echo&#x27;s secret voice across the mountains.

Codex 190 of Photius&#x27; &quot;Bibliotheca&quot; states that Pan&#x27;s unrequited love for Echo was placed there by Aphrodite, angry at his verdict in a beauty contest.

Nonnus&#x27; &quot;Dionysiaca&quot; contains a number of references to Echo. In Nonnus&#x27; account, though Pan frequently chased Echo, he never won her affection. Book VI also makes reference to Echo in the context of the Great Deluge. Nonnus states that the waters rose so far that even high on the hills Echo was forced to swim. Having escaped the advances of Pan, she feared now the lust of Poseidon.

Whereas Nonnus is adamant that Pan never wins Echo, in Apuleius&#x27; &quot;The Golden Ass&quot; Pan is described with Echo in his arms, teaching the nymph to repeat all manner of songs. Similarly in the &quot;Suda&quot;, Echo is described as bearing Pan a child, &quot;Iynx&quot;. Other fragments mention a second daughter, &quot;Iambe&quot;.

==Medieval depiction==

===&quot;The Lay of Narcissus&quot;===
&quot;The Lay of Narcissus&quot;, one of many titles by which the work is known, is a Norman-French verse narrative written towards the end of the 12th century. In the four manuscripts that remain, an unknown author borrows from the Echo and Narcissus of Ovid to create a story better suited to the needs of his time.

This medieval account alters the characters of both Echo and Narcissus. In Ovid&#x27;s account Echo is a beautiful nymph residing with the Muses, and Narcissus is a haughty prince. In &quot;The Lay of Narcissus&quot;, Echo is replaced by the princess Dané. Conversely, Narcissus loses the royal status he bore in Ovid&#x27;s account: in this rendition he is no more than a commoner, a vassal of Dané&#x27;s father, the King.

In the &quot;Lay&quot;, Dané is pierced by the arrows of Amor and falls madly in love with Narcissus. Though aware that she should first consult her father, she nonetheless shares her feelings with Narcissus. Despite her emphasising her royal lineage, Narcissus spurns her just as he spurns and flees from all women.

Humiliated, Dané calls out to Amor, and, in response, the god curses Narcissus. In a classic example of poetic justice, Narcissus is forced to suffer the same pain he inflicted on others, namely the pain of unrequited love. The vehicle of this justice is a pool of water in which Narcissus falls in love with his own reflection, which he at first mistakes for a woman. Deranged by lust, Dané searches for Narcissus, naked but for a cloak, and finds him at the point of death. Devastated, Dané repents ever calling to Amor. Dané expresses her love for the last time, pulls close to her beloved and dies in his arms. The poet warns men and women alike not to disdain suitors lest they suffer a similar fate.

While Ovid&#x27;s story is still recognisable, many of the details have changed considerably. Almost all references to pagan deities are gone, save Amor who is little more than a personification of love. Narcissus is demoted to the status of a commoner while Echo is elevated to the status of princess. Allusions to Narcissus’ homosexuality are expunged. While Ovid talks of Narcissus&#x27; disdain for both male and female suitors, the &quot;Lay&quot; only mentions his hatred of women. Similarly, in the &quot;Lay&quot;, Narcissus mistakes his reflection for that of a woman, whereas no mention is made of this in Ovid&#x27;s account. Finally, the tale is overtly moralized with messages about courtly love. Such exhortations were entirely absent from the &quot;Metamorphoses&quot; rendition.

===&quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot;===
&quot;The Romance of the Rose&quot; is a medieval French poem, the first section of which was written by Guillaume de Lorris in around 1230. The poem was completed by Jean de Meun in around 1275. Part of a much larger narrative, the tale of Echo and Narcissus is relayed when the central figure stumbles across the pool wherein Narcissus first glimpsed his own reflection.

In this rendition, Echo is not a nymph, or a princess, but a noble lady. She fell madly in love with Narcissus, so much so that she declared that she would die should he fail to love her in turn. Narcissus refuses, not because he despises all women, but merely because he is haughty and excessively proud of his own beauty.

Guillaume relays that on hearing Narcissus’ rejection, Echo&#x27;s grief and anger were so great that she died at once. However, in a similar vein to the &quot;Lay of Narcissus&quot;, just before she dies, Echo calls out to Deus. She asks that Narcissus might one day be tormented by unrequited love as she had been, and, in so doing, understand how the spurned suffer.

As in the classical myth, Narcissus comes across a pool following a hunt. Though Echo prayed to Deus, and the tale notes that he answered her prayer, it is Amor who waits for Narcissus by the water. Amor causes Narcissus to fall for his own reflection, leading quickly to his death. The tale makes clear that this is not merely justice for Echo, but also punishment for Narcissus’ slight against love itself.

The tale concludes with an exhortation to all men warning them that, should they scorn their lovers, God will repay the offence.

Guillaume&#x27;s rendition builds on the themes of courtly love emphasised in the &quot;Lay&quot; and moves further away from Ovid&#x27;s initial account. The curse of Hera is absent entirely, and the tale is overtly moralised. Unlike in the &quot;Lay&quot;, however, this moral message is aimed solely at women; this despite the fact that the offending behaviour is perpetrated by Narcissus not Echo.

<text>In telecommunications, the effective height of an antenna is the height of the antenna&#x27;s center of radiation above the ground.

In low-frequency applications involving loaded or nonloaded vertical antennas, the effective height is the moment of the current distribution in the vertical section, divided by the input current. For an antenna with a symmetrical current distribution, the center of radiation is the center of the distribution. For an antenna with asymmetrical current distribution, the center of radiation is the center of current moments when viewed from points near the direction of maximum radiation.

In antenna theory, it is often used interchangeably with antenna effective length, where it is defined as the ratio of the open circuit voltage across the antenna&#x27;s terminals to the incident electric field of a radio signal.

<text>Efficiency factor is a ratio of some measure of performance to an expected value.

==Data communication==
In data communications, the factor is the ratio of the time to transmit a text automatically at a specified modulation rate to the time actually required to receive the same text at a specified maximum error rate. All of the communication facilities are assumed to be in the normal condition of adjustment and operation. The practical conditions of measurement should be specified, especially the duration of the measurement.

Telegraph communications may have different temporal efficiency factors for the two directions of transmission.

==Industrial engineering==
In industrial engineering, the efficiency factor is the relationship between the allowance time and the time taken, in the form of percentage.

Efficiency factors are used in performance rating and remuneration calculation exercises. The efficiency factor is an extremely simple to use and readily comprehensible index, the prerequisite being exact time management for maintaining the allowed times.

<text>In electrical engineering, electrical length is a dimensionless parameter equal to the physical length of an electrical conductor such as a cable or wire, divided by the wavelength of alternating current at a given frequency traveling through the conductor. In other words, it is the length of the conductor measured in wavelengths. It can alternately be expressed as an angle, in radians or degrees, equal to the phase shift the alternating current experiences traveling through the conductor.

Electrical length is defined for a conductor operating at a specific frequency or narrow band of frequencies. It is determined by the construction of the cable, so different cables of the same length operating at the same frequency can have different electrical lengths. A conductor is called &quot;electrically long&quot; if it has an electrical length much greater than one; that is it is much longer than the wavelength of the alternating current passing through it, and &quot;electrically short&quot; if it is much shorter than a wavelength. Electrical lengthening and electrical shortening means adding reactance (capacitance or inductance) to an antenna or conductor to increase or decrease the electrical length, usually for the purpose of making it resonant at a different resonant frequency.

This concept is used throughout electronics, and particularly in radio frequency circuit design, transmission line and antenna theory and design. Electrical length determines when wave effects (phase shift along conductors) become important in a circuit. Ordinary lumped element electric circuits only work well for alternating currents at frequencies for which the circuit is electrically small (electrical length much less than one). For frequencies high enough that the wavelength approaches the size of the circuit (the electrical length approaches one) the lumped element model on which circuit theory is based becomes inaccurate, and transmission line techniques must be used.

== Definition ==

Electrical length is defined for conductors carrying alternating current (AC) at a single frequency or narrow band of frequencies. An alternating electric current of a single frequency formula_1 is an oscillating sine wave which repeats with a period of formula_2. This current flows through a given conductor such as a wire or cable at a particular phase velocity formula_3. It takes time for later portions of the wave to reach a given point on the conductor so the spatial distribution of current and voltage along the conductor at any time is a moving sine wave. After a time equal to the period formula_4 a complete cycle of the wave has passed a given point and the wave repeats; during this time a point of constant phase on the wave has traveled a distance of 
:formula_5 
so formula_6 (Greek lambda) is the wavelength of the wave along the conductor, the distance between successive crests of the wave.

The &quot;electrical length&quot; formula_7 of a conductor with a physical length of formula_8 at a given frequency formula_1 is the number of wavelengths or fractions of a wavelength of the wave along the conductor; in other words the conductor&#x27;s length measured in wavelengths
 \quad&lt;/math&gt;
The phase velocity formula_3 at which electrical signals travel along a transmission line or other cable depends on the construction of the line. Therefore, the wavelength formula_6 corresponding to a given frequency varies in different types of lines, thus at a given frequency different conductors of the same physical length can have different electrical lengths.

=== Phase shift definition ===
In radio frequency applications, when a delay is introduced due to a conductor, it is often the phase shift formula_12, the difference in phase of the sinusoidal wave between the two ends of the conductor, that is of importance. The length of a sinusoidal wave is commonly expressed as an angle, in units of degrees (with 360° in a wavelength) or radians (with 2π radians in a wavelength). So alternately the electrical length can be expressed as an angle which is the phase shift of the wave between the ends of the conductor
:formula_13
:formula_14

=== Significance ===
The electrical length of a conductor determines when wave effects (phase shift along the conductor) are important. If the electrical length formula_7 is much less than one, that is the physical length of a conductor is much shorter than the wavelength, say less than one tenth of the wavelength (formula_16) it is called &quot;electrically short&quot;. In this case the voltage and current are approximately constant along the conductor, so it acts as a simple connector which transfers alternating current with negligible phase shift. In circuit theory the connecting wires between components are usually assumed to be electrically short, so the lumped element circuit model is only valid for alternating current when the circuit is &quot;electrically small&quot;, much smaller than a wavelength. When the electrical length approaches or is greater than one, a conductor will have significant reactance, inductance or capacitance, depending on its length. So simple circuit theory is inadequate and transmission line techniques (the distributed-element model) must be used.

=== Velocity factor ===
In a vacuum an electromagnetic wave (radio wave) travels at the speed of light formula_17 2.9979×108 meters per second, and very close to this speed in air, so the &quot;free space wavelength&quot; of the wave is formula_18. (in this article free space variables are distinguished by a subscript 0) Thus a physical length formula_8 of a radio wave in space or air has an electrical length of 
:formula_20 wavelengths. 
In the SI system of units, empty space has a permittivity of formula_21 8.854×10−12 F/m (farads per metre) and a magnetic permeability of formula_22 1.257×10−6 H/m (henries per meter). These universal constants determine the speed of light
:formula_23
In most transmission lines, the series resistance of the wires and shunt conductance of the insulation is low enough that the line can be approximated as lossless (see diagram). This means the inductance and capacitance per unit length of the line determine the phase velocity.
In an electrical cable, for a cycle of the alternating current to move a given distance along the line, it takes time to charge the capacitance between the conductors, and the rate of change of the current is slowed by the series inductance of the wires. This determines the phase velocity formula_3 at which the wave moves along the line. In cables and transmission lines an electrical signal travels at a rate determined by the effective shunt capacitance formula_25 and series inductance formula_26 per unit length of the transmission line
:formula_27
Some transmission lines consist only of bare metal conductors, if they are far away from other high permittivity materials their signals propagate at very close to the speed of light, formula_28. In most transmission lines the material construction of the line slows the velocity of the signal so it travels at a reduced phase velocity 
:formula_29 
where formula_30 is a dimensionless number between 0 and 1 called the &quot;velocity factor&quot;, characteristic of the type of line, equal to the ratio of signal velocity in the line to the speed of light.

Most transmission lines contain a dielectric material (insulator) filling some or all of the space in between the conductors. The permittivity formula_31 or &quot;dielectric constant&quot; of that material increases the distributed capacitance formula_25 in the cable, which reduces the velocity factor below unity. If there is a material with high magnetic permeability (formula_33) in the line such as steel or ferrite which increases the distributed inductance formula_26, it can also reduce formula_30, but this is almost never the case. If all the space around the transmission line conductors containing the near fields was filled with a material of permittivity formula_31 and permeability formula_33, the phase velocity on the line would be
\;&lt;/math&gt;   
The effective permittivity formula_31 and permeability formula_33 per unit length of the line are frequently given as dimensionless constants; relative permittivity: formula_40 and relative permeability: formula_41 equal to the ratio of these parameters compared to the universal constants formula_42 and formula_43
:formula_44
so the phase velocity is
:formula_45
So the velocity factor of the line is
:formula_46

In many lines, for example twin lead, only a fraction of the space surrounding the line containing the fields is occupied by a solid dielectric. With only part of the electromagnetic field effected by the dielectric, there is less reduction of the wave velocity. In this case an &quot;effective permittivity&quot; formula_47 can be calculated which if it filled all the space around the line would give the same phase velocity. This is computed as a weighted average of the relative permittivity of free space, unity, and that of the dielectric:
formula_48
where the &quot;fill factor&quot; expresses the effective proportion of space around the line occupied by dielectric.

In most transmission lines there are no materials with high magnetic permeability, so formula_49 and formula_50 and so 
}\;&lt;/math&gt; (no magnetic materials)     
Since the electromagnetic waves travel slower in the line than in free space, the wavelength of the wave in the transmission line formula_6 is shorter than the free space wavelength by the factor VF: formula_52. Therefore, more wavelengths fit in a transmission line of a given length formula_8 than in the same length of wave in free space, so the electrical length of a transmission line is longer than the electrical length of a wave of the same frequency in free space
 = {lf \over c\mathit{VF}}\;&lt;/math&gt;

== Transmission lines ==

Ordinary electrical cable suffices to carry alternating current when the cable is &quot;electrically short&quot;; the electrical length of the cable is small compared to one, that is when the physical length of the cable is small compared to a wavelength, say formula_16.

As frequency gets high enough that the length of the cable becomes a significant fraction of a wavelength, formula_55, ordinary wires and cables become poor conductors of AC. Impedance discontinuities at the source, load, connectors and switches begin to reflect the electromagnetic current waves back toward the source, creating bottlenecks so not all the power reaches the load. Ordinary wires act as antennas, radiating the power into space as radio waves, and in radio receivers can also pick up radio frequency interference (RFI).

To mitigate these problems, at these frequencies transmission line is used instead. A transmission line is a specialized cable designed for carrying electric current of radio frequency. The distinguishing feature of a transmission line is that it is constructed to have a constant characteristic impedance along its length and through connectors and switches, to prevent reflections. This also means AC current travels at a constant phase velocity along its length, while in ordinary cable phase velocity may vary. The velocity factor formula_30 depends on the details of construction, and is different for each type of transmission line. However the approximate velocity factor for the major types of transmission lines is given in the table.

Electrical length is widely used with a graphical aid called the Smith chart to solve transmission line calculations. A Smith chart has a scale around the circumference of the circular chart graduated in wavelengths and degrees, which represents the electrical length of the transmission line from the point of measurement to the source or load.

The equation for the voltage as a function of time along a transmission line with a matched load, so there is no reflected power, is
:formula_57
where
:formula_58 is the peak voltage along the line
:formula_59 is the angular frequency of the alternating current in radians per second 
:formula_60 is the wavenumber, equal to the number of radians of the wave in one meter
:formula_61 is the distance along the line
:formula_62 is time
In a matched transmission line, the current is in phase with the voltage, and their ratio is the characteristic impedance formula_63 of the line
:formula_64

== Antennas ==
An important class of radio antenna is the &quot;thin element antenna&quot; in which the radiating elements are conductive wires or rods. These include monopole antennas and dipole antennas, as well as antennas based on them such as the whip antenna, T antenna, mast radiator, Yagi, log periodic, and turnstile antennas. These are resonant antennas, in which the radio frequency electric currents travel back and forth in the antenna conductors, reflecting from the ends.

If the antenna rods are not too thick (have a large enough length to diameter ratio), the current along them is close to a sine wave, so the concept of electrical length also applies to these. The current is in the form of two oppositely directed sinusoidal traveling waves which reflect from the ends, which interfere to form standing waves. The electrical length of an antenna, like a transmission line, is its length in wavelengths of the current on the antenna at the operating frequency. An antenna&#x27;s resonant frequency, radiation pattern, and driving point impedance depend not on its physical length but on its electrical length. A thin antenna element is resonant at frequencies at which the standing current wave has a node (zero) at the ends (and in monopoles an antinode (maximum) at the ground plane). A dipole antenna is resonant at frequencies at which its electrical length is a half wavelength (formula_65) or a multiple of it. A monopole antenna is resonant at frequencies at which its electrical length is a quarter wavelength (formula_66) or a multiple of it.

Resonant frequency is important because at frequencies at which the antenna is resonant the input impedance it presents to its feedline is purely resistive. If the resistance of the antenna is matched to the characteristic resistance of the feedline, it absorbs all the power supplied to it, while at other frequencies it has reactance and reflects some power back down the line toward the transmitter, causing standing waves (high SWR) on the feedline. Since only a portion of the power is radiated this causes inefficiency, and can possibly overheat the line or transmitter. Therefore, transmitting antennas are usually designed to be resonant at the transmitting frequency; and if they cannot be made the right length they are &quot;electrically lengthened&quot; or &quot;shortened&quot; to be resonant (see below).

=== End effects ===
A thin-element antenna can be thought of as a transmission line with the conductors separated, so the near-field electric and magnetic fields extend further into space than in a transmission line, in which the fields are mainly confined to the vicinity of the conductors. Near the ends of the antenna elements the electric field is not perpendicular to the conductor axis as in a transmission line but spreads out in a fan shape (fringing field). As a result, the end sections of the antenna have increased capacitance, storing more charge, so the current waveform departs from a sine wave there, decreasing faster toward the ends. When approximated as a sine wave, the current does not quite go to zero at the ends; the nodes of the current standing wave, instead of being at the ends of the element, occur somewhat beyond the ends. Thus the electrical length of the antenna is longer than its physical length.

The electrical length of an antenna element also depends on the length-to-diameter ratio of the conductor. As the ratio of the diameter to wavelength increases, the capacitance increases, so the node occurs farther beyond the end, and the electrical length of the element increases. When the elements get too thick, the current waveform becomes significantly different from a sine wave, so the entire concept of electrical length is no longer applicable, and the behavior of the antenna must be calculated by electromagnetic simulation computer programs like NEC.

As with a transmission line, an antenna&#x27;s electrical length is increased by anything that adds shunt capacitance or series inductance to it, such as the presence of high permittivity dielectric material around it. In microstrip antennas which are fabricated as metal strips on printed circuit boards, the dielectric constant of the substrate board increases the electrical length of the antenna. Proximity to the Earth or a ground plane, a dielectric coating on the conductor, nearby grounded towers, metal structural members, guy lines and the capacitance of insulators supporting the antenna also increase the electrical length.

These factors, called &quot;end effects&quot;, cause the electrical length of an antenna element to be somewhat longer than the length of the same wave in free space. In other words, the physical length of the antenna at resonance will be somewhat shorter than the resonant length in free space (one-half wavelength for a dipole, one-quarter wavelength for a monopole). As a rough generalization, for a typical dipole antenna, the physical resonant length is about 5% shorter than the free space resonant length.

=== Electrical lengthening and shortening ===
In many circumstances for practical reasons it is inconvenient or impossible to use an antenna of resonant length. An antenna of nonresonant length at the operating frequency can be made resonant by adding a reactance, a capacitance or inductance, either in the antenna itself or in a matching network between the antenna and its feedline. A nonresonant antenna appears at its feedpoint electrically equivalent to a resistance in series with a reactance. Adding an equal but opposite type of reactance in series with the feedline will cancel the antenna&#x27;s reactance; the combination of the antenna and reactance will act as a series resonant circuit, so at its operating frequency its input impedance will be purely resistive, allowing it to be fed power efficiently at a low SWR without reflections.

In a common application, an antenna which is &quot;electrically short&quot;, shorter than its fundamental resonant length, a monopole antenna with an electrical length shorter than a quarter-wavelength (formula_67), or a dipole antenna shorter than a half-wavelength (formula_68) will have capacitive reactance. Adding an inductor (coil of wire), called a loading coil, at the feedpoint in series with the antenna, with inductive reactance equal to the antenna&#x27;s capacitive reactance at the operating frequency, will cancel the capacitance of the antenna, so the combination of the antenna and coil will be resonant at the operating frequency. Since adding inductance is equivalent to increasing the electrical length, this technique is called electrically lengthening the antenna. This is the usual technique for matching an electrically short transmitting antenna to its feedline, so it can be fed power efficiently. However, an electrically short antenna that has been loaded in this way still has the same radiation pattern; it does not radiate as much power, and therefore has lower gain than a full-sized antenna.

Conversely, an antenna longer than resonant length at its operating frequency, such as a monopole longer than a quarter wavelength but shorter than a half wavelength, will have inductive reactance. This can be cancelled by adding a capacitor of equal but opposite reactance at the feed point to make the antenna resonant. This is called electrically shortening the antenna.

=== Scaling properties of antennas ===
Two antennas that are similar (scaled copies of each other), fed with different frequencies, will have the same radiation resistance and radiation pattern and fed with equal power will radiate the same power density in any direction if they have the same electrical length at the operating frequency; that is, if their lengths are in the same proportion as the wavelengths.
:formula_69
This means the length of antenna required for a given antenna gain scales with the wavelength (inversely with the frequency), or equivalently the aperture scales with the square of the wavelength.

=== Electrically short antennas ===
An electrically short conductor, much shorter than one wavelength, makes an inefficient radiator of electromagnetic waves. As the length of an antenna is made shorter than its fundamental resonant length (a half-wavelength for a dipole antenna and a quarter-wavelength for a monopole), the radiation resistance the antenna presents to the feedline decreases with the square of the electrical length, that is the ratio of physical length to wavelength, formula_70. As a result, other resistances in the antenna, the ohmic resistance of metal antenna elements, the ground system if present, and the loading coil, dissipate an increasing fraction of transmitter power as heat. A monopole antenna with an electrical length below .05formula_6 or 18° has a radiation resistance of less than one ohm, making it very hard to drive.

A second disadvantage is that since the capacitive reactance of the antenna and inductive reactance of the required loading coil do not decrease, the Q factor of the antenna increases; it acts electrically like a high Q tuned circuit. As a result, the bandwidth of the antenna decreases with the square of electrical length, reducing the data rate that can be transmitted. At VLF frequencies even the huge toploaded wire antennas that must be used have bandwidths of only ~10 hertz, limiting the data rate that can be transmitted.

== Regimes of electromagnetics ==
The field of electromagnetics is the study of electric fields, magnetic fields, electric charge, electric currents and electromagnetic waves. Classic electromagnetism is based on the solution of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. These equations are mathematically difficult to solve in all generality, so approximate methods have been developed that apply to situations in which the electrical length of the apparatus is very short (formula_72) or very long (formula_73). Electromagnetics is divided into three regimes or fields of study depending on the electrical length of the apparatus, that is the physical length formula_8 of the apparatus compared to the wavelength formula_75 of the waves: Completely different apparatus is used to conduct and process electromagnetic waves in these different wavelength ranges
*formula_76 &quot;Circuit theory&quot;: When the wavelength of the electrical oscillations is much larger than the physical size of the circuit (formula_77), say formula_78, the action occurs in the near field. The phase of the oscillations and therefore the current and voltage can be approximated as constant along the length of connecting wires. Also little energy is radiated in the form of electromagnetic waves, the power radiated by a conductor as an antenna is proportional to the electrical length squared formula_79. So the electrical energy remains in the wires and components as quasistatic near-field electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, the approximation of the lumped element model can be used, and electric currents oscillating at these frequencies can be processed by electric circuits consisting of lumped circuit elements such as resistors, capacitors, inductors, transformers, transistors, and integrated circuits linked by ordinary wires. Mathematically Maxwell&#x27;s equations reduce to circuit theory (Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws). 
*formula_80, &quot;Distributed-element model (microwave theory)&quot;: When the wavelength of the waves is of the same order of magnitude as the size of the equipment (formula_81), as it is in the microwave part of the spectrum, full solutions of Maxwell&#x27;s equations must be used. At these frequencies, wires are replaced by transmission lines and waveguide and lumped elements are replaced by resonant stubs, irises, and cavity resonators. Often only a single mode (wave pattern) is propagating through the apparatus, which simplifies the mathematics. A modification of circuit theory called the distributed-element model can often be used, in which extended objects are regarded as electrical circuits with capacitance, inductance and resistance distributed along their length. A graphical aid called the Smith chart is often used to analyze transmission lines. 
*formula_82, &quot;Optics&quot;: When the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave is much smaller than the physical size of the equipment that manipulates it (formula_83), say formula_84, most of the path of the waves is in the far field. In the far field, the electric and magnetic fields cannot be separated but propagate together as an electromagnetic wave. Unlike in the case of microwaves, unless coherent light sources like lasers are used, the number of modes propagating is usually large. Since little of the energy is stored in the quasistatic (induction) electric or magnetic fields at the surface boundaries between media (called evanescent fields in optics), the concepts of voltage, current, capacitance, and inductance have little meaning and are not used, and the medium is characterized by its index of refraction formula_85, absorption, permittivity formula_31, permeability formula_33, and dispersion. At these frequencies electromagnetic waves are manipulated by optical elements such as lenses, mirrors, prisms, optical filters and diffraction gratings. Maxwell&#x27;s equations can be approximated by the equations of geometrical optics or physical optics.
Historically, electric circuit theory and optics developed as separate branches of physics until at the end of the 19th century James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic theory and Heinrich Hertz&#x27;s discovery that light was electromagnetic waves unified these fields as branches of electromagnetism.

<text>An electric field (sometimes called E-field) is a physical field that surrounds electrically charged particles. In classical electromagnetism, the electric field of a single charge (or group of charges) describes their capacity to exert attractive or repulsive forces on another charged object. Charged particles exert attractive forces on each other when the sign of their charges are opposite, one being positive while the other is negative, and repel each other when the signs of the charges are the same. Because these forces are exerted mutually, two charges must be present for the forces to take place. These forces are described by Coulomb&#x27;s law, which says that the greater the magnitude of the charges, the greater the force, and the greater the distance between them, the weaker the force. Informally, the greater the charge of an object, the stronger its electric field. Similarly, an electric field is stronger nearer charged objects and weaker further away. Electric fields originate from electric charges and time-varying electric currents. Electric fields and magnetic fields are both manifestations of the electromagnetic field. Electromagnetism is one of the four fundamental interactions of nature.

Electric fields are important in many areas of physics, and are exploited in electrical technology. For example, in atomic physics and chemistry, the interaction in the electric field between the atomic nucleus and electrons is the force that holds these particles together in atoms. Similarly, the interaction in the electric field between atoms is the force responsible for chemical bonding that result in molecules.

The electric field is defined as a vector field that associates to each point in space the force per unit of charge exerted on an infinitesimal test charge at rest at that point. The SI unit for the electric field is the volt per meter (V/m), which is equal to the newton per coulomb (N/C).

== Description ==

The electric field is defined at each point in space as the force that would be experienced by an infinitesimally small stationary test charge at that point divided by the charge. The electric field is defined in terms of force, and force is a vector (i.e. having both magnitude and direction), so it follows that an electric field may be described by a vector field. The electric field acts between two charges similarly to the way that the gravitational field acts between two masses, as they both obey an inverse-square law with distance. This is the basis for Coulomb&#x27;s law, which states that, for stationary charges, the electric field varies with the source charge and varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source. This means that if the source charge were doubled, the electric field would double, and if you move twice as far away from the source, the field at that point would be only one-quarter its original strength.

The electric field can be visualized with a set of lines whose direction at each point is the same as those of the field, a concept introduced by Michael Faraday, whose term &#x27;lines of force&#x27; is still sometimes used. This illustration has the useful property that, when drawn so that each line represents the same amount of flux, the strength of the field is proportional to the density of the lines. Field lines due to stationary charges have several important properties, including that they always originate from positive charges and terminate at negative charges, they enter all good conductors at right angles, and they never cross or close in on themselves. The field lines are a representative concept; the field actually permeates all the intervening space between the lines. More or fewer lines may be drawn depending on the precision to which it is desired to represent the field. The study of electric fields created by stationary charges is called electrostatics.

Faraday&#x27;s law describes the relationship between a time-varying magnetic field and the electric field. One way of stating Faraday&#x27;s law is that the curl of the electric field is equal to the negative time derivative of the magnetic field. In the absence of time-varying magnetic field, the electric field is therefore called conservative (i.e. curl-free). This implies there are two kinds of electric fields: electrostatic fields and fields arising from time-varying magnetic fields. While the curl-free nature of the static electric field allows for a simpler treatment using electrostatics, time-varying magnetic fields are generally treated as a component of a unified electromagnetic field. The study of magnetic and electric fields that change over time is called electrodynamics.

== Mathematical formulation ==
Electric fields are caused by electric charges, described by Gauss&#x27;s law, and time varying magnetic fields, described by Faraday&#x27;s law of induction. Together, these laws are enough to define the behavior of the electric field. However, since the magnetic field is described as a function of electric field, the equations of both fields are coupled and together form Maxwell&#x27;s equations that describe both fields as a function of charges and currents.

=== Electrostatics ===

In the special case of a steady state (stationary charges and currents), the Maxwell-Faraday inductive effect disappears. The resulting two equations (Gauss&#x27;s law formula_1 and Faraday&#x27;s law with no induction term formula_2), taken together, are equivalent to Coulomb&#x27;s law, which states that a particle with electric charge formula_3 at position formula_4 exerts a force on a particle with charge formula_5 at position formula_6 of:
formula_7
where
* formula_8 is the force on charged particle formula_9 caused by charged particle formula_10.
* is the permittivity of free space.
* formula_11 is a unit vector directed from formula_12 to formula_13.
* formula_14 is the displacement vector from formula_12 to formula_13.

Note that formula_17 must be replaced with formula_18, permittivity, when charges are in non-empty media.
When the charges formula_5 and formula_3 have the same sign this force is positive, directed away from the other charge, indicating the particles repel each other. When the charges have unlike signs the force is negative, indicating the particles attract.
To make it easy to calculate the Coulomb force on any charge at position formula_6 this expression can be divided by formula_5 leaving an expression that only depends on the other charge (the &quot;source&quot; charge)
formula_23
where 
* formula_24 is the component of the electric field at formula_9 due to formula_10.

This is the &quot;electric field&quot; at point formula_6 due to the point charge formula_3; it is a vector-valued function equal to the Coulomb force per unit charge that a positive point charge would experience at the position formula_6.
Since this formula gives the electric field magnitude and direction at any point formula_6 in space (except at the location of the charge itself, formula_4, where it becomes infinite) it defines a vector field.
From the above formula it can be seen that the electric field due to a point charge is everywhere directed away from the charge if it is positive, and toward the charge if it is negative, and its magnitude decreases with the inverse square of the distance from the charge.

The Coulomb force on a charge of magnitude formula_32 at any point in space is equal to the product of the charge and the electric field at that point
formula_33
The SI unit of the electric field is the newton per coulomb (N/C), or volt per meter (V/m); in terms of the SI base units it is kg⋅m⋅s−3⋅A−1.

=== Superposition principle ===
Due to the linearity of Maxwell&#x27;s equations, electric fields satisfy the superposition principle, which states that the total electric field, at a point, due to a collection of charges is equal to the vector sum of the electric fields at that point due to the individual charges. This principle is useful in calculating the field created by multiple point charges. If charges formula_34 are stationary in space at points formula_35, in the absence of currents, the superposition principle says that the resulting field is the sum of fields generated by each particle as described by Coulomb&#x27;s law:
formula_36
where 
* formula_37 is the unit vector in the direction from point formula_38 to point formula_39
* formula_38 is the displacement vector from point formula_38 to point formula_39.

=== Continuous charge distributions ===
The superposition principle allows for the calculation of the electric field due to a distribution of charge density formula_43. By considering the charge formula_44 in each small volume of space formula_45 at point formula_46 as a point charge, the resulting electric field, formula_47, at point formula_39 can be calculated as 
formula_49
where 
* formula_50 is the unit vector pointing from formula_46 to formula_39. 
* formula_46 is the displacement vector from formula_46 to formula_39. 
The total field is found by summing the contributions from all the increments of volume by integrating the charge density over the volume formula_56:
formula_57

Similar equations follow for a surface charge with surface charge density formula_58 on surface formula_59
formula_60
and for line charges with linear charge density formula_61 on line formula_62
formula_63

=== Electric potential ===

If a system is static, such that magnetic fields are not time-varying, then by Faraday&#x27;s law, the electric field is curl-free. In this case, one can define an electric potential, that is, a function formula_64 such that This is analogous to the gravitational potential. The difference between the electric potential at two points in space is called the potential difference (or voltage) between the two points.

In general, however, the electric field cannot be described independently of the magnetic field. Given the magnetic vector potential, , defined so that , one can still define an electric potential formula_65 such that:
formula_66
where formula_67 is the gradient of the electric potential and formula_68 is the partial derivative of with respect to time.

Faraday&#x27;s law of induction can be recovered by taking the curl of that equation 
formula_69
which justifies, a posteriori, the previous form for .

=== Continuous vs. discrete charge representation ===

The equations of electromagnetism are best described in a continuous description. However, charges are sometimes best described as discrete points; for example, some models may describe electrons as point sources where charge density is infinite on an infinitesimal section of space.

A charge formula_32 located at formula_71 can be described mathematically as a charge density , where the Dirac delta function (in three dimensions) is used. Conversely, a charge distribution can be approximated by many small point charges.

== Electrostatic fields ==

Electrostatic fields are electric fields that do not change with time. Such fields are present when systems of charged matter are stationary, or when electric currents are unchanging. In that case, Coulomb&#x27;s law fully describes the field.

=== Parallels between electrostatic and gravitational fields ===

Coulomb&#x27;s law, which describes the interaction of electric charges:
formula_72 at that point is formula_73 since charges are only formed on the surface and the surface at the infinitesimal scale resembles an infinite 2D plane. In the absence of external fields, spherical conductors exhibit a uniform charge distribution on the surface and hence have the same electric field as that of uniform spherical surface distribution.

<text>Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is the ability of electrical equipment and systems to function acceptably in their electromagnetic environment, by limiting the unintentional generation, propagation and reception of electromagnetic energy which may cause unwanted effects such as electromagnetic interference (EMI) or even physical damage to operational equipment. The goal of EMC is the correct operation of different equipment in a common electromagnetic environment. It is also the name given to the associated branch of electrical engineering.

EMC pursues three main classes of issue. &quot;Emission&quot; is the generation of electromagnetic energy, whether deliberate or accidental, by some source and its release into the environment. EMC studies the unwanted emissions and the countermeasures which may be taken in order to reduce unwanted emissions. The second class, &quot;susceptibility&quot;, is the tendency of electrical equipment, referred to as the victim, to malfunction or break down in the presence of unwanted emissions, which are known as Radio frequency interference (RFI). &quot;Immunity&quot; is the opposite of susceptibility, being the ability of equipment to function correctly in the presence of RFI, with the discipline of &quot;hardening&quot; equipment being known equally as susceptibility or immunity. A third class studied is &quot;coupling&quot;, which is the mechanism by which emitted interference reaches the victim.

Interference mitigation and hence electromagnetic compatibility may be achieved by addressing any or all of these issues, i.e., quieting the sources of interference, inhibiting coupling paths and/or hardening the potential victims. In practice, many of the engineering techniques used, such as grounding and shielding, apply to all three issues.

== History ==

=== Origins ===

The earliest EMC issue was lightning strike (lightning electromagnetic pulse, or LEMP) on ships and buildings. Lightning rods or lightning conductors began to appear in the mid-18th century. With the advent of widespread electricity generation and power supply lines from the late 19th century on, problems also arose with equipment short-circuit failure affecting the power supply, and with local fire and shock hazard when the power line was struck by lightning. Power stations were provided with output circuit breakers. Buildings and appliances would soon be provided with input fuses, and later in the 20th century miniature circuit breakers (MCB) would come into use.

=== Early twentieth century ===

It may be said that radio interference and its correction arose with the first spark-gap experiment of Marconi in the late 1800s. As radio communications developed in the first half of the 20th century, interference between broadcast radio signals began to occur and an international regulatory framework was set up to ensure interference-free communications.

Switching devices became commonplace through the middle of the 20th century, typically in petrol powered cars and motorcycles but also in domestic appliances such as thermostats and refrigerators. This caused transient interference with domestic radio and (after World War II) TV reception, and in due course laws were passed requiring the suppression of such interference sources.

ESD problems first arose with accidental electric spark discharges in hazardous environments such as coal mines and when refuelling aircraft or motor cars. Safe working practices had to be developed.

=== Postwar period ===

After World War II the military became increasingly concerned with the effects of nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP), lightning strike, and even high-powered radar beams, on vehicle and mobile equipment of all kinds, and especially aircraft electrical systems.

When high RF emission levels from other sources became a potential problem (such as with the advent of microwave ovens), certain frequency bands were designated for Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) use, allowing emission levels limited only by thermal safety standards. Later, the International Telecommunication Union adopted a Recommendation providing limits of radiation from ISM devices in order to protect radiocommunications. A variety of issues such as sideband and harmonic emissions, broadband sources, and the ever-increasing popularity of electrical switching devices and their victims, resulted in a steady development of standards and laws.

From the late 1970s, the popularity of modern digital circuitry rapidly grew. As the technology developed, with ever-faster switching speeds (increasing emissions) and lower circuit voltages (increasing susceptibility), EMC increasingly became a source of concern. Many more nations became aware of EMC as a growing problem and issued directives to the manufacturers of digital electronic equipment, which set out the essential manufacturer requirements before their equipment could be marketed or sold. Organizations in individual nations, across Europe and worldwide, were set up to maintain these directives and associated standards. In 1979, the American FCC published a regulation that required the electromagnetic emissions of all &quot;digital devices&quot; to be below certain limits. This regulatory environment led to a sharp growth in the EMC industry supplying specialist devices and equipment, analysis and design software, and testing and certification services. Low-voltage digital circuits, especially CMOS transistors, became more susceptible to ESD damage as they were miniaturised and, despite the development of on-chip hardening techniques, a new ESD regulatory regime had to be developed.

=== Modern era ===

From the 1980s on the explosive growth in mobile communications and broadcast media channels put huge pressure on the available airspace. Regulatory authorities began squeezing band allocations closer and closer together, relying on increasingly sophisticated EMC control methods, especially in the digital communications domain, to keep cross-channel interference to acceptable levels. Digital systems are inherently less susceptible than analogue systems, and also offer far easier ways (such as software) to implement highly sophisticated protection and error-correction measures.

In 1985, the USA released the ISM bands for low-power mobile digital communications, leading to the development of Wi-Fi and remotely-operated car door keys. This approach relies on the intermittent nature of ISM interference and use of sophisticated error-correction methods to ensure lossless reception during the quiet gaps between any bursts of interference.

== Concepts ==

&quot;Electromagnetic interference&quot; (EMI) is defined as the &quot;degradation in the performance of equipment or transmission channel or a system caused by an electromagnetic disturbance&quot; ( 161-01-06) while &quot;electromagnetic disturbance&quot; is defined as &quot;&quot;an electromagnetic phenomenon that can degrade the performance of a device, equipment or system, or adversely affect living or inert matter&quot; (IEV 161-01-05). The terms &quot;electromagnetic disturbance&quot; and &quot;electromagnetic interference&quot; designate respectively the cause and the effect,

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is an equipment &quot;characteristic&quot; or &quot;property&quot; and is defined as &quot; &quot;the ability of equipment or a system to function satisfactorily in its electromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to anything in that environment&quot; &quot; (IEV 161-01-07).

EMC ensures the correct operation, in the same electromagnetic environment, of different equipment items which use or respond to electromagnetic phenomena, and the avoidance of any interference. Another way of saying this is that EMC is the control of EMI so that unwanted effects are prevented.

Besides understanding the phenomena in themselves, EMC also addresses the countermeasures, such as control regimes, design and measurement, which should be taken in order to prevent emissions from causing any adverse effect.

==Technical characteristics of interference==
===Types of interference===
EMC is often understood as the control of electromagnetic interference (EMI). Electromagnetic interference divides into several categories according to the source and signal characteristics.

The origin of interference, often called &quot;noise&quot; in this context, can be man-made (artificial) or natural.

Continuous, or continuous wave (CW), interference comprises a given range of frequencies. This type is naturally divided into sub-categories according to frequency range, and as a whole is sometimes referred to as &quot;DC to daylight&quot;. One common classification is into narrowband and broadband, according to the spread of the frequency range.

An electromagnetic pulse (EMP), sometimes called a transient disturbance, is a short-duration pulse of energy. This energy is usually broadband by nature, although it often excites a relatively narrow-band &quot;damped sine wave&quot; response in the victim. Pulse signals divide broadly into isolated and repetitive events.

=== Coupling mechanisms ===

When a source emits interference, it follows a route to the victim known as the coupling path. There are four basic coupling mechanisms: conductive, capacitive, magnetic or inductive, and radiative. Any coupling path can be broken down into one or more of these coupling mechanisms working together.

Conductive coupling occurs when the coupling path between the source and victim is formed by direct electrical contact with a conducting body.

Capacitive coupling occurs when a varying electrical field exists between two adjacent conductors, inducing a change in voltage on the receiving conductor.

Inductive coupling or magnetic coupling occurs when a varying magnetic field exists between two parallel conductors, inducing a change in voltage along the receiving conductor.

Radiative coupling or electromagnetic coupling occurs when source and victim are separated by a large distance. Source and victim act as radio antennas: the source emits or radiates an electromagnetic wave which propagates across the space in between and is picked up or received by the victim.

The damaging effects of electromagnetic interference pose unacceptable risks in many areas of technology, and it is necessary to control such interference and reduce the risks to acceptable levels.

The control of electromagnetic interference (EMI) and assurance of EMC comprises a series of related disciplines:
* Characterising the threat.
* Setting standards for emission and susceptibility levels.
* Design for standards compliance.
* Testing for standards compliance.

The risk posed by the threat is usually statistical in nature, so much of the work in threat characterisation and standards setting is based on reducing the probability of disruptive EMI to an acceptable level, rather than its assured elimination.

For a complex or novel piece of equipment, this may require the production of a dedicated &quot;EMC control plan&quot; summarizing the application of the above and specifying additional documents required.

Characterisation of the problem requires understanding of:

* The interference source and signal.
* The coupling path to the victim.
* The nature of the victim both electrically and in terms of the significance of malfunction.

== Design ==

Breaking a coupling path is equally effective at either the start or the end of the path, therefore many aspects of good EMC design practice apply equally to potential sources and to potential victims. A design which easily couples energy to the outside world will equally easily couple energy in and will be susceptible. A single improvement will often reduce both emissions and susceptibility. Grounding and shielding aim to reduce emissions or divert EMI away from the victim by providing an alternative, low-impedance path. Techniques include:

* Grounding or earthing schemes such as &quot;star earthing&quot; for audio equipment or &quot;ground planes&quot; for RF. The scheme must also satisfy safety regulations.
* Shielded cables, where the signal wires are surrounded by an outer conductive layer that is grounded at one or both ends.
* Shielded housings. A conductive metal housing will act as an interference shield. In order to access the interior, such a housing is typically made in sections (such as a box and lid); an RF gasket may be used at the joints to reduce the amount of interference that leaks through. RF gaskets come in various types. A plain metal gasket may be either braided wire or a flat strip slotted to create many springy &quot;fingers&quot;. Where a waterproof seal is required, a flexible elastomeric base may be impregnated with chopped metal fibers dispersed into the interior or long metal fibers covering the surface or both.

Other general measures include:

* Decoupling or filtering at critical points such as cable entries and high-speed switches, using RF chokes and/or RC elements. A line filter implements these measures between a device and a line.
* Transmission line techniques for cables and wiring, such as balanced differential signal and return paths, and impedance matching.
* Avoidance of antenna structures such as loops of circulating current, resonant mechanical structures, unbalanced cable impedances or poorly grounded shielding.
* Eliminating spurious rectifying junctions that can form between metal structures around and near transmitter installations. Such junctions in combination with unintentional antenna structures can radiate harmonics of the transmitter frequency.

Additional measures to reduce emissions include:

* Avoid unnecessary switching operations. Necessary switching should be done as slowly as is technically possible.
* Noisy circuits (e. g. with a lot of switching activity) should be physically separated from the rest of the design.
* High peaks at single frequencies can be avoided by using the spread spectrum method, in which different parts of the circuit emit at different frequencies.
* Harmonic wave filters.
* Design for operation at lower signal levels, reducing the energy available for emission.

Additional measures to reduce susceptibility include:

* Fuses, trip switches and circuit breakers.
* Transient absorbers.
* Design for operation at higher signal levels, reducing the relative noise level in comparison.
* Error-correction techniques in digital circuitry. These may be implemented in hardware, software or a combination of both.
* Differential signaling or other common-mode noise techniques for signal routing

== Testing ==

Testing is required to confirm that a particular device meets the required standards. It is divided broadly into emissions testing and susceptibility testing. Open-area test sites, or OATS, are the reference sites in most standards. They are especially useful for emissions testing of large equipment systems. However, RF testing of a physical prototype is most often carried out indoors, in a specialized EMC test chamber. Types of the chamber include anechoic, reverberation and the gigahertz transverse electromagnetic cell (GTEM cell). Sometimes computational electromagnetics simulations are used to test virtual models. Like all compliance testing, it is important that the test equipment, including the test chamber or site and any software used, be properly calibrated and maintained. Typically, a given run of tests for a particular piece of equipment will require an &quot;EMC test plan&quot; and a follow-up &quot;test report&quot;. The full test program may require the production of several such documents.

Emissions are typically measured for radiated field strength and where appropriate for conducted emissions along cables and wiring. Inductive (magnetic) and capacitive (electric) field strengths are near-field effects and are only important if the device under test (DUT) is designed for a location close to other electrical equipment. For conducted emissions, typical transducers include the LISN (line impedance stabilization network) or AMN (artificial mains network) and the RF current clamp. For radiated emission measurement, antennas are used as transducers. Typical antennas specified include dipole, biconical, log-periodic, double ridged guide and conical log-spiral designs. Radiated emissions must be measured in all directions around the DUT. Specialized EMI test receivers or EMI analyzers are used for EMC compliance testing. These incorporate bandwidths and detectors as specified by international EMC standards. An EMI receiver may be based on a spectrum analyser to measure the emission levels of the DUT across a wide band of frequencies (frequency domain), or on a tunable narrower-band device which is swept through the desired frequency range. EMI receivers along with specified transducers can often be used for both conducted and radiated emissions. Pre-selector filters may also be used to reduce the effect of strong out-of-band signals on the front-end of the receiver. Some pulse emissions are more usefully characterized using an oscilloscope to capture the pulse waveform in the time domain.

Radiated field susceptibility testing typically involves a high-powered source of RF or EM energy and a radiating antenna to direct the energy at the potential victim or device under test (DUT). Conducted voltage and current susceptibility testing typically involves a high-powered signal generator, and a current clamp or other type of transformer to inject the test signal. Transient or EMP signals are used to test the immunity of the DUT against powerline disturbances including surges, lightning strikes and switching noise. In motor vehicles, similar tests are performed on battery and signal lines. The transient pulse may be generated digitally and passed through a broadband pulse amplifier, or applied directly to the transducer from a specialized pulse generator. Electrostatic discharge testing is typically performed with a piezo spark generator called an &quot;ESD pistol&quot;. Higher energy pulses, such as lightning or nuclear EMP simulations, can require a large current clamp or a large antenna which completely surrounds the DUT. Some antennas are so large that they are located outdoors, and care must be taken not to cause an EMP hazard to the surrounding environment.

== Legislation ==
Several organizations, both national and international, work to promote international co-operation on standardization (harmonization), including publishing various EMC standards. Where possible, a standard developed by one organization may be adopted with little or no change by others. This helps for example to harmonize national standards across Europe.

International standards organizations include:

* International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), which has several committees working full-time on EMC issues. These are:
** Technical Committee 77 (TC77), working on electromagnetic compatibility between equipment including networks.
** Comité International Spécial des Perturbations Radioélectriques (CISPR), or International Special Committee on Radio Interference.
** The Advisory Committee on Electromagnetic Compatibility (ACEC) co-ordinates the IEC&#x27;s work on EMC between these committees.
* International Organization for Standardization (ISO), which publishes standards for the automotive industry.

Among the main national organizations are:

* Europe:
** Comité Européen de Normalisation (CEN) or European Committee for Standardization).
** Comité Européen de Normalisation Electrotechniques (CENELEC) or European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardisation.
** European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI).
* United States:
** The Federal Communications Commission (FCC).
** The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE).
** The Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics (RTCA); see DO-160
* Britain: The British Standards Institution (BSI).
* Germany: The Verband der Elektrotechnik, Elektronik und Informationstechnik (VDE) or Association for Electrical, Electronic and Information Technologies.

Compliance with national or international standards is usually laid down by laws passed by individual nations. Different nations can require compliance with different standards.

In European law, EU directive 2014/30/EU (previously 2004/108/EC) on EMC defines the rules for the placing on the market/putting into service of electric/electronic equipment within the European Union. The Directive applies to a vast range of equipment including electrical and electronic appliances, systems and installations. Manufacturers of electric and electronic devices are advised to run EMC tests in order to comply with compulsory CE-labeling. More are given in the list of EMC directives. Compliance with the applicable harmonised standards whose reference is listed in the OJEU under the EMC Directive gives presumption of conformity with the corresponding essential requirements of the EMC Directive.

In 2019, the USA adopted a program for the protection of critical infrastructure against an electromagnetic pulse, whether caused by a geomagnetic storm or a high-altitude nuclear weapon.

<text>A nuclear electromagnetic pulse (nuclear EMP or NEMP) is a burst of electromagnetic radiation created by a nuclear explosion. The resulting rapidly varying electric and magnetic fields may couple with electrical and electronic systems to produce damaging current and voltage surges. The specific characteristics of a particular nuclear EMP event vary according to a number of factors, the most important of which is the altitude of the detonation.

The term &quot;electromagnetic pulse&quot; generally excludes optical (infrared, visible, ultraviolet) and ionizing (such as X-ray and gamma radiation) ranges. In military terminology, a nuclear warhead detonated tens to hundreds of miles above the Earth&#x27;s surface is known as a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse (HEMP) device. Effects of a HEMP device depend on factors including the altitude of the detonation, energy yield, gamma ray output, interactions with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field and electromagnetic shielding of targets.

==History==
The fact that an electromagnetic pulse is produced by a nuclear explosion was known in the earliest days of nuclear weapons testing. The magnitude of the EMP and the significance of its effects were not immediately realized.

During the first United States nuclear test on 16 July 1945, electronic equipment was shielded because Enrico Fermi expected the electromagnetic pulse. The official technical history for that first nuclear test states, &quot;All signal lines were completely shielded, in many cases doubly shielded. In spite of this many records were lost because of spurious pickup at the time of the explosion that paralyzed the recording equipment.&quot; During British nuclear testing in 1952–53, instrumentation failures were attributed to &quot;radioflash&quot;, which was their term for EMP.

The first openly reported observation of the unique aspects of high-altitude nuclear EMP occurred during the helium balloon-lofted Yucca nuclear test of the Hardtack I series on 28 April 1958. In that test, the electric field measurements from the 1.7 kiloton weapon exceeded the range to which the test instruments were adjusted and was estimated to be about five times the limits to which the oscilloscopes were set.
The Yucca EMP was initially positive-going, whereas low-altitude bursts were negative-going pulses. Also, the polarization of the Yucca EMP signal was horizontal, whereas low-altitude nuclear EMP was vertically polarized. In spite of these many differences, the unique EMP results were dismissed as a possible wave propagation anomaly.

The high-altitude nuclear tests of 1962, as discussed below, confirmed the unique results of the Yucca high-altitude test and increased the awareness of high-altitude nuclear EMP beyond the original group of defense scientists. The larger scientific community became aware of the significance of the EMP problem after a three-article series on nuclear EMP was published in 1981 by William J. Broad in &quot;Science&quot;.

===Starfish Prime===

In July 1962, the US carried out the Starfish Prime test, exploding a bomb above the mid-Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated that the effects of a high-altitude nuclear explosion were much larger than had been previously calculated. Starfish Prime made those effects known to the public by causing electrical damage in Hawaii, about away from the detonation point, disabling approximately 300 streetlights, triggering numerous burglar alarms and damaging a microwave link.

Starfish Prime was the first success in the series of United States high-altitude nuclear tests in 1962 known as Operation Fishbowl. Subsequent tests gathered more data on the high-altitude EMP phenomenon.

The Bluegill Triple Prime and Kingfish high-altitude nuclear tests of October and November 1962 in Operation Fishbowl provided data that was clear enough to enable physicists to accurately identify the physical mechanisms behind the electromagnetic pulses.

The EMP damage of the Starfish Prime test was quickly repaired due, in part, to the fact that the EMP over Hawaii was relatively weak compared to what could be produced with a more intense pulse, and in part due to the relative ruggedness (compared to today) of Hawaii&#x27;s electrical and electronic infrastructure in 1962.

The relatively small magnitude of the Starfish Prime EMP in Hawaii (about 5.6 kilovolts/metre) and the relatively small amount of damage (for example, only 1% to 3% of streetlights extinguished) led some scientists to believe, in the early days of EMP research, that the problem might not be significant. Later calculations showed that if the Starfish Prime warhead had been detonated over the northern continental United States, the magnitude of the EMP would have been much larger (22 to 30 kV/m) because of the greater strength of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field over the United States, as well as its different orientation at high latitudes. These calculations, combined with the accelerating reliance on EMP-sensitive microelectronics, heightened awareness that EMP could be a significant problem.

===Soviet Test 184===

In 1962, the Soviet Union performed three EMP-producing nuclear tests in space over Kazakhstan, the last in the &quot;Soviet Project K nuclear tests&quot;. Although these weapons were much smaller (300 kiloton) than the Starfish Prime test, they were over a populated, large landmass and at a location where the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field was greater. The damage caused by the resulting EMP was reportedly much greater than in Starfish Prime. The geomagnetic storm–like E3 pulse from Test 184 induced a current surge in a long underground power line that caused a fire in the power plant in the city of Karaganda.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the level of this damage was communicated informally to US scientists. For a few years US and Russian scientists collaborated on the HEMP phenomenon. Funding was secured to enable Russian scientists to report on some of the Soviet EMP results in international scientific journals. As a result, formal documentation of some of the EMP damage in Kazakhstan exists, although it is still sparse in the open-scientific literature.

For one of the K Project tests, Soviet scientists instrumented a section of telephone line in the area that they expected to be affected by the pulse. The monitored telephone line was divided into sub-lines of in length, separated by repeaters. Each sub-line was protected by fuses and by gas-filled overvoltage protectors. The EMP from the 22 October (K-3) nuclear test (also known as Test 184) blew all of the fuses and destroyed all of the overvoltage protectors in all of the sub-lines.
Published reports, including a 1998 IEEE article, have stated that there were significant problems with ceramic insulators on overhead electrical power lines during the tests. A 2010 technical report written for Oak Ridge National Laboratory stated that &quot;Power line insulators were damaged, resulting in a short circuit on the line and some lines detaching from the poles and falling to the ground&quot;.

==Characteristics==
Nuclear EMP is a complex multi-pulse, usually described in terms of three components, as defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).

The three components of nuclear EMP, as defined by the IEC, are called &quot;E1&quot;, &quot;E2&quot;, and &quot;E3&quot;.

The three categories of high-altitude EMP are divided according to the time duration and occurrence of each pulse. E1 is the fastest or &quot;early time&quot; high-altitude EMP. Traditionally, the term &quot;EMP&quot; often refers specifically to this E1 component of high-altitude electromagnetic pulse.

The E2 and E3 pulses are often further subdivided into additional divisions according to causation. E2 is a much lower intensity &quot;intermediate time&quot; EMP, which is further divided into E2A (scattered gamma EMP) and E2B (neutron gamma EMP).

E3 is a very long-duration &quot;late time&quot; pulse, which is extremely slow in rise and fall times compared to the other components of EMP. E3 is further divided into E3A (blast wave) and E3B (heave). E3 is also called magnetohydrodynamic EMP.

===E1===
The E1 pulse is a very fast component of nuclear EMP. E1 is a brief but intense electromagnetic field that induces high voltages in electrical conductors. E1 causes most of its damage by causing electrical breakdown voltages to be exceeded. E1 can destroy computers and communications equipment and it changes too quickly (nanoseconds) for ordinary surge protectors to provide effective protection from it. Fast-acting surge protectors (such as those using TVS diodes) will block the E1 pulse.

E1 is produced when gamma radiation from the nuclear detonation ionizes (strips electrons from) atoms in the upper atmosphere. This is known as the Compton effect and the resulting current is called the &quot;Compton current&quot;. The electrons travel in a generally downward direction at relativistic speeds (more than 90 percent of the speed of light). In the absence of a magnetic field, this would produce a large, radial pulse of electric current propagating outward from the burst location confined to the source region (the region over which the gamma photons are attenuated). The Earth&#x27;s magnetic field exerts a force on the electron flow at a right angle to both the field and the particles&#x27; original vector, which deflects the electrons and leads to synchrotron radiation. Because the outward traveling gamma pulse is propagating at the speed of light, the synchrotron radiation of the Compton electrons adds coherently, leading to a radiated electromagnetic signal. This interaction produces a large, brief, pulse.

Several physicists worked on the problem of identifying the mechanism of the HEMP E1 pulse. The mechanism was finally identified by Conrad Longmire of Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1963.

Longmire gives numerical values for a typical case of E1 pulse produced by a second-generation nuclear weapon such as those of Operation Fishbowl. The typical gamma rays given off by the weapon have an energy of about 2MeV (mega electron-volts). The gamma rays transfer about half of their energy to the ejected free electrons, giving an energy of about 1MeV.

In a vacuum and absent a magnetic field, the electrons would travel with a current density of tens of amperes per square metre. Because of the downward tilt of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at high latitudes, the area of peak field strength is a U-shaped region to the equatorial side of the detonation. As shown in the diagram, for nuclear detonations in the Northern Hemisphere, this U-shaped region is south of the detonation point. Near the equator, where the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field is more nearly horizontal, the E1 field strength is more nearly symmetrical around the burst location.

At geomagnetic field strengths typical of the mid-latitudes, these initial electrons spiral around the magnetic field lines with a typical radius of about . These initial electrons are stopped by collisions with air molecules at an average distance of about . This means that most of the electrons are stopped by collisions with air molecules before completing a full spiral around the field lines.

This interaction of the negatively charged electrons with the magnetic field radiates a pulse of electromagnetic energy. The pulse typically rises to its peak value in some five nanoseconds. Its magnitude typically decays by half within 200 nanoseconds. (By the IEC definition, this E1 pulse ends 1000 nanoseconds after it begins.) This process occurs simultaneously on about 1025 electrons.  The simultaneous action of the electrons causes the resulting pulse from each electron to radiate coherently, adding to produce a single large-amplitude, short-duration, radiated pulse.

Secondary collisions cause subsequent electrons to lose energy before they reach ground level. The electrons generated by these subsequent collisions have so little energy that they do not contribute significantly to the E1 pulse.

These 2 MeV gamma rays typically produce an E1 pulse near ground level at moderately high latitudes that peaks at about 50,000 volts per metre. The ionization process in the mid-stratosphere causes this region to become an electrical conductor, a process that blocks the production of further electromagnetic signals and causes the field strength to saturate at about 50,000 volts per metre. The strength of the E1 pulse depends upon the number and intensity of the gamma rays and upon the rapidity of the gamma-ray burst. Strength is also somewhat dependent upon altitude.

There are reports of &quot;super-EMP&quot; nuclear weapons that are able to exceed the 50,000 volts per metre limit by unspecified mechanisms. The reality and possible construction details of these weapons are classified and are, therefore, unconfirmed in the open scientific literature

===E2===
The E2 component is generated by scattered gamma rays and inelastic gammas produced by neutrons. This E2 component is an &quot;intermediate time&quot; pulse that, by IEC definition, lasts from about one microsecond to one second after the explosion. E2 has many similarities to lightning, although lightning-induced E2 may be considerably larger than a nuclear E2. Because of the similarities and the widespread use of lightning protection technology, E2 is generally considered to be the easiest to protect against.

According to the United States EMP Commission, the main problem with E2 is that it immediately follows E1, which may have damaged the devices that would normally protect against E2.

The EMP Commission Executive Report of 2004 states, &quot;In general, it would not be an issue for critical infrastructure systems since they have existing protective measures for defense against occasional lightning strikes. The most significant risk is synergistic because the E2 component follows a small fraction of a second after the first component&#x27;s insult, which has the ability to impair or destroy many protective and control features. The energy associated with the second component thus may be allowed to pass into and damage systems.&quot;

===E3===

The E3 component is different from E1 and E2. E3 is a much slower pulse, lasting tens to hundreds of seconds. It is caused by the nuclear detonation&#x27;s temporary distortion of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The E3 component has similarities to a geomagnetic storm. Like a geomagnetic storm, E3 can produce geomagnetically induced currents in long electrical conductors, damaging components such as power line transformers.

Because of the similarity between solar-induced geomagnetic storms and nuclear E3, it has become common to refer to solar-induced geomagnetic storms as &quot;Solar EMP&quot;. &quot;Solar EMP&quot; does not include E1 or E2 components.

==Generation==
Factors that control weapon effectiveness include altitude, yield, construction details, target distance, intervening geographical features, and local strength of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

===Weapon altitude===
According to an internet primer published by the Federation of American Scientists:

: A high-altitude nuclear detonation produces an immediate flux of gamma rays from the nuclear reactions within the device. These photons in turn produce high energy free electrons by Compton scattering at altitudes between (roughly) 20 and 40 km. These electrons are then trapped in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, giving rise to an oscillating electric current. This current is asymmetric in general and gives rise to a rapidly rising radiated electromagnetic field called an electromagnetic pulse (EMP). Because the electrons are trapped essentially simultaneously, a very large electromagnetic source radiates coherently.

: The pulse can easily span continent-sized areas, and this radiation can affect systems on land, sea, and air. ... A large device detonated at 400–500 km (250 to 312 miles) over Kansas would affect all of the continental U.S. The signal from such an event extends to the visual horizon as seen from the burst point.

Thus, for equipment to be affected, the weapon needs to be above the visual horizon.

The altitude indicated above is greater than that of the International Space Station and many low Earth orbit satellites. Large weapons could have a dramatic impact on satellite operations and communications such as occurred during Operation Fishbowl. The damaging effects on orbiting satellites are usually due to factors other than EMP. In the Starfish Prime nuclear test, most damage was to the satellites&#x27; solar panels while passing through radiation belts created by the explosion.

For detonations within the atmosphere, the situation is more complex. Within the range of gamma ray deposition, simple laws no longer hold as the air is ionized and there are other EMP effects, such as a radial electric field due to the separation of Compton electrons from air molecules, together with other complex phenomena. For a surface burst, absorption of gamma rays by air would limit the range of gamma-ray deposition to approximately , while for a burst in the lower-density air at high altitudes, the range of deposition would be far greater.

===Weapon yield===
Typical nuclear weapon yields used during Cold War planning for EMP attacks were in the range of . This is roughly 50 to 500 times the size of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs. Physicists have testified at United States Congressional hearings that weapons with yields of or less can produce a large EMP.

The EMP at a fixed distance from an explosion increases at most as the square root of the yield (see the illustration to the right). This means that although a weapon has only of the energy release of the Starfish Prime test, the EMP will be at least as powerful. Since the E1 component of nuclear EMP depends on the prompt gamma-ray output, which was only 0.1% of yield in Starfish Prime but can be of yield in low-yield pure nuclear fission weapons, a bomb can easily be as powerful as the Starfish Prime at producing EMP.

The total prompt gamma-ray energy in a fission explosion is of the yield, but in a detonation the triggering explosive around the bomb core absorbs about of the prompt gamma rays, so the output is only about of the yield. In the thermonuclear Starfish Prime the fission yield was less than 100% and the thicker outer casing absorbed about 95% of the prompt gamma rays from the pusher around the fusion stage. Thermonuclear weapons are also less efficient at producing EMP because the first stage can pre-ionize the air which becomes conductive and hence rapidly shorts out the Compton currents generated by the fusion stage. Hence, small pure fission weapons with thin cases are far more efficient at causing EMP than most megaton bombs.

This analysis, however, only applies to the fast E1 and E2 components of nuclear EMP. The geomagnetic storm-like E3 component of nuclear EMP is more closely proportional to the total energy yield of the weapon.

===Target distance===
In nuclear EMP all of the components of the electromagnetic pulse are generated outside of the weapon.

For high-altitude nuclear explosions, much of the EMP is generated far from the detonation (where the gamma radiation from the explosion hits the upper atmosphere). This electric field from the EMP is remarkably uniform over the large area affected.

According to the standard reference text on nuclear weapons effects published by the U.S. Department of Defense, &quot;The peak electric field (and its amplitude) at the Earth&#x27;s surface from a high-altitude burst will depend upon the explosion yield, the height of the burst, the location of the observer, and the orientation with respect to the geomagnetic field. As a general rule, however, the field strength may be expected to be tens of kilovolts per metre over most of the area receiving the EMP radiation.&quot;

The text also states that, &quot;...over most of the area affected by the EMP the electric field strength on the ground would exceed 0.5&quot;E&quot;max. For yields of less than a few hundred kilotons, this would not necessarily be true because the field strength at the Earth&#x27;s tangent could be substantially less than 0.5&quot;E&quot;max.&quot;

(&quot;E&quot;max refers to the maximum electric field strength in the affected area.)

In other words, the electric field strength in the entire area that is affected by the EMP will be fairly uniform for weapons with a large gamma-ray output. For smaller weapons, the electric field may fall at a faster rate as distance increases.

==Super-EMP==
Also known as an &quot;Enhanced-EMP&quot;, a super-electromagnetic pulse is a relatively new type of warfare in which a nuclear weapon is designed to create a far greater electromagnetic pulse in comparison to standard nuclear weapons of mass destruction. These weapons capitalize on the E1 pulse component of a detonation involving gamma rays, creating an EMP yield of potentially up to 200,000 volts per meter. For decades, numerous countries have experimented with the creation of such weapons, most notably China and Russia.

===China===
According to a statement made in writing by the Chinese military, the country has super-EMPs and has discussed their use in attacking Taiwan. Such an attack would debilitate information systems in the nation, allowing China to move in and attack it directly using soldiers. The Taiwanese military has subsequently confirmed Chinese possession of super-EMPs and their possible destruction to power grids.

In addition to Taiwan, the possible implications of attacking the United States with these weapons was examined by China. While the United States also possesses nuclear weapons, the country has not experimented with super-EMPs and is hypothetically highly vulnerable to any future attacks by nations. This is due to the country&#x27;s reliance on computers to control much of the government and economy. Abroad, U.S. aircraft carriers stationed within a reasonable range of an exploding bomb could potentially be subject to complete destruction of missiles on board, as well as telecommunication systems that would allow them to communicate with nearby vessels and controllers on land.

===Russia===
Since the Cold War, Russia has experimented with the design and effects of EMP bombs.

The Soviet Union designed a system to deliver nuclear weapons from the low Earth orbit. and proposals have been made by Russia to develop satellites supplied with EMP capabilities. This would call for detonations up to above the Earth&#x27;s surface, with the potential to disrupt the electronic systems of U.S. satellites suspended in orbit around the planet, many of which are vital for deterrence and alerting the country of possible incoming missiles.

==Effects==
An energetic EMP can temporarily upset or permanently damage electronic equipment by generating high voltage and high current surges; semiconductor components are particularly at risk. The effects of damage can range from imperceptible to the eye, to devices blowing apart. Cables, even if short, can act as antennas to transmit pulse energy to the equipment.

===Vacuum tube vs. solid-state electronics===
Older, vacuum tube (valve)-based equipment is generally much less vulnerable to nuclear EMP than solid-state equipment, which is much more susceptible to damage by large, brief voltage and current surges. Soviet Cold War-era military aircraft often had avionics based on vacuum tubes because solid-state capabilities were limited and vacuum-tube gear was believed to be more likely to survive.

Other components in vacuum tube circuitry can be damaged by EMP. Vacuum tube equipment was damaged in the 1962 testing. The solid-state PRC-77 VHF manpackable two-way radio survived extensive EMP testing. The earlier PRC-25, nearly identical except for a vacuum tube final amplification stage, was tested in EMP simulators, but was not certified to remain fully functional.

===Electronics in operation vs. inactive===
Equipment that is running at the time of an EMP is more vulnerable. Even a low-energy pulse has access to the power source, and all parts of the system are illuminated by the pulse. For example, a high-current arcing path may be created across the power supply, burning out some device along that path. Such effects are hard to predict and require testing to assess potential vulnerabilities.

===On aircraft===
Many nuclear detonations have taken place using aerial bombs. The B-29 aircraft that delivered the nuclear weapons at Hiroshima and Nagasaki did not lose power from electrical damage, because electrons (ejected from the air by gamma rays) are stopped quickly in normal air for bursts below roughly , so they are not significantly deflected by the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field.

If the aircraft carrying the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombs had been within the intense nuclear radiation zone when the bombs exploded over those cities, then they would have suffered effects from the charge separation (radial) EMP. But this only occurs within the severe blast radius for detonations below about altitude.

During Operation Fishbowl, EMP disruptions were suffered aboard a KC-135 photographic aircraft flying from the detonations at burst altitudes. The vital electronics were less sophisticated than today&#x27;s and the aircraft was able to land safely.

Modern aircraft are heavily reliant on solid-state electronics which are very susceptible to EMP blasts. Therefore, airline authorities are creating high intensity radiated fields (HIRF) requirements for new airplanes to help prevent the chance of crashes caused by EMPs or electromagnetic interference (EMI). To do this all parts of the airplane must be conductive. This is the main shield from EMP blasts as long as there are no holes for the waves to penetrate into the interior of the airplane. Also, insulating some of the main computers inside the plane adds an extra layer of protection from EMP blasts.

===On cars===
An EMP would probably not affect most cars, despite modern cars&#x27; heavy use of electronics, because cars&#x27; electronic circuits and cabling are likely too short to be affected. In addition, cars&#x27; metallic frames provide some protection. However, even a small percentage of cars breaking down due to an electronic malfunction would cause traffic jams.

===On small electronics===
An EMP has a smaller effect on shorter lengths of an electrical conductor. Other factors affect the vulnerability of electronics as well, so no hard cutoff length determines whether some piece of equipment will survive. However, small electronic devices, such as wristwatches and cell phones, would most likely withstand an EMP.

===On humans and animals===
Though electric potential difference can accumulate in electrical conductors after an EMP, it will generally not flow out into human or animal bodies, and thus contact is safe.

EMPs of sufficient magnitude and length have the potential to affect the human body. Possible side effects include cellular mutations, nervous system damages, internal burns, brain damage, and temporary problems with thinking and memory. However, this would be in extreme cases like being near the center of the blast and being exposed to a large amount of radiation and EMP waves.

A study found that exposure to 200–400 pulses of EMP caused the leaking of vessels in the brain, leakage that has been linked to small problems with thinking and memory recollection. These effects could last up to 12 hours after the exposure. Due to the long exposure time needed to see any of these effects it is unlikely that anyone would see these effects even if exposed for a small period of time. Also, the human body will see little effect as signals are passed chemically and not electrically making it hard to be affected by EMP waves.

=== Indirect effects on agriculture ===
In addition to these direct effects, it has also been estimated that the disruption caused by the NEMP would have large negative effects on agriculture, due to the disruption of supply chains for agricultural inputs like fertilizers and pesticides. This could reduce yields in highly industrialized agricultural regions like Central Europe by up to 75 %.

==Post–Cold War attack scenarios==
The United States EMP Commission was created by the United States Congress in 2001. The commission is formally known as the commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack.

The Commission brought together notable scientists and technologists to compile several reports. In 2008, the Commission released the &quot;Critical National Infrastructures Report&quot;. This report describes the likely consequences of a nuclear EMP on civilian infrastructure. Although this report covered the United States, most of the information is applicable to other industrialized countries. The 2008 report was a follow-up to a more generalized report issued by the commission in 2004.

In written testimony delivered to the United States Senate in 2005, an EMP Commission staff member reported:

The United States EMP Commission determined that long-known protections are almost completely absent in the civilian infrastructure of the United States and that large parts of US military services were less-protected against EMP than during the Cold War. In public statements, the Commission recommended making electronic equipment and electrical components resistant to EMP – and maintaining spare parts inventories that would enable prompt repairs. The United States EMP Commission did not look at other nations.

In 2011, the Defense Science Board published a report about the ongoing efforts to defend critical military and civilian systems against EMP and other nuclear weapons effects.

The United States military services developed, and in some cases published, hypothetical EMP attack scenarios.

In 2016, the Los Alamos Laboratory started phase 0 of a multi-year study (through to phase 3) to investigate EMPs which prepared the strategy to be followed for the rest of the study.

In 2017, the US Department of Energy published the &quot;DOE Electromagnetic Pulse Resilience Action Plan&quot;, Edwin Boston published a dissertation on the topic and the EMP Commission published &quot;Assessing the threat from electromagnetic pulse (EMP)&quot;. The EMP commission was closed in summer 2017. They found that earlier reports had underestimated the effects of an EMP attack on the national infrastructure, highlighted issues with communications from the DoD due to the classified nature of the material, and recommended that the DHS instead of going to the DOE for guidance and direction should directly cooperate with the more knowledgeable parts of the DOE. Several reports are in process of being released to the general public.

==Protecting infrastructure==
The problem of protecting civilian infrastructure from electromagnetic pulse has been intensively studied throughout the European Union, and in particular by the United Kingdom.

As of 2017, several electric utilities in the United States had been involved in a three-year research program on the impact of HEMP to the United States power grid led by an industry non-profit organization, Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI).

In 2018, the US Department of Homeland Security released the Strategy for Protecting and Preparing the Homeland against Threats from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) and Geomagnetic Disturbance (GMD), which was the department&#x27;s first articulation of a holistic, long-term, partnership-based approach to protecting critical infrastructure and preparing to respond and recover from potentially catastrophic electromagnetic incidents. Progress on that front is described in the EMP Program Status Report.

NuScale, the small modular nuclear reactor company from Oregon, US, has made their reactor resistant to EMP.

==In fiction and popular culture==

By 1981, a number of articles on nuclear electromagnetic pulse in the popular press spread knowledge of the nuclear EMP phenomenon into the popular culture. EMP has been subsequently used in a wide variety of fiction and other aspects of popular culture.

The popular media often depict EMP effects incorrectly, causing misunderstandings among the public and even professionals, and official efforts have been made in the United States to set the record straight. The United States Space Command commissioned science educator Bill Nye to narrate and produce a video called &quot;Hollywood vs. EMP&quot;, so that inaccurate Hollywood fiction would not confuse those who must deal with real EMP events. The video is not available to the general public.

<text>Electromagnetic radiation can be classified into two types: ionizing radiation and non-ionizing radiation, based on the capability of a single photon with more than 10 eV energy to ionize atoms or break chemical bonds. Extreme ultraviolet and higher frequencies, such as X-rays or gamma rays are ionizing, and these pose their own special hazards: see &quot;radiation poisoning&quot;. The field strength of electromagnetic radiation is measured in volts per meter (V/m).

The most common health hazard of radiation is sunburn, which causes between approximately 100,000 and 1 million new skin cancers annually in the United States.

In 2011, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) have classified radiofrequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B).

==Hazards==
Dielectric heating from electromagnetic radiation can create a biological hazard. For example, touching or standing around an antenna while a high-power transmitter is in operation can cause burns. The mechanism is the same as that used in a microwave oven.

The heating effect varies with the power and the frequency of the electromagnetic energy, as well as the inverse square of distance to the source. The eyes and testes are particularly susceptible to radio frequency heating due to the paucity of blood flow in these areas that could otherwise dissipate the heat buildup.

=== Workplace exposure ===
Radio frequency (RF) energy at power density levels of 1–10 mW/cm2 or higher can cause measurable heating of tissues. Typical RF energy levels encountered by the general public are well below the level needed to cause significant heating, but certain workplace environments near high power RF sources may exceed safe exposure limits. A measure of the heating effect is the specific absorption rate or SAR, which has units of watts per kilogram (W/kg). The IEEE and many national governments have established safety limits for exposure to various frequencies of electromagnetic energy based on SAR, mainly based on ICNIRP Guidelines, which guard against thermal damage.

Industrial installations for induction hardening and melting or on welding equipment may produce considerably higher field strengths and require further examination. If the exposure cannot be determined upon manufacturers&#x27; information, comparisons with similar systems or analytical calculations, measurements have to be accomplished. The results of the evaluation help to assess possible hazards to the safety and health of workers and to define protective measures. Since electromagnetic fields may influence passive or active implants of workers, it is essential to consider the exposure at their workplaces separately in the risk assessment.

=== Low-level exposure ===
The World Health Organization (WHO) began a research effort in 1996 to study the health effects from the ever-increasing exposure of people to a diverse range of EMR sources. In 2011, the WHO/International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified radio frequency electromagnetic fields as possibly carcinogenic to humans (Group 2B), based on an increased risk for glioma and acoustic neuroma associated with wireless phone use. The group responsible for the classification did not quantify the risk. Furthermore, group 2B only indicates a credible association between disease and exposure but does not rule out confounding effects with reasonable confidence. A causal relationship has yet to be established.

Epidemiological studies look for statistical correlations between EM exposure in the field and specific health effects. As of 2019, much of the current work is focused on the study of EM fields in relation to cancer. There are publications which support the existence of complex biological and neurological effects of weaker &quot;non-thermal&quot; electromagnetic fields (see Bioelectromagnetics), including weak ELF electromagnetic fields and modulated RF and microwave fields.

==Effects by frequency==
While the most acute exposures to harmful levels of electromagnetic radiation are immediately realized as burns, the health effects due to chronic or occupational exposure may not manifest effects for months or years.

===Extremely low frequency===

Extremely low frequency EM waves can span from 0 Hz to 3 kHz, though definitions vary across disciplines. The maximum recommended exposure for the general public is 5 kV/m.

ELF waves around 50 Hz to 60 Hz are emitted by power generators, transmission lines and distribution lines, power cables, and electric appliances. Typical household exposure to ELF waves ranges in intensity from 5 V/m for a light bulb to 180 V/m for a stereo, measured at and using 240V power. (120V power systems would be unable to reach this intensity unless an appliance has an internal voltage transformer.) 

Overhead power lines range from 1kV for local distribution to 1,150 kV for ultra high voltage lines. These can produce electric fields up to 10kV/m on the ground directly underneath, but 50 m to 100 m away these levels return to approximately ambient. Metal equipment must be maintained at a safe distance from energized high-voltage lines.

Exposure to ELF waves can induce an electric current. Because the human body is conductive, electric currents and resulting voltages differences typically accumulate on the skin but do not reach interior tissues. People can start to perceive high-voltage charges as tingling when hair or clothing in contact with the skin stands up or vibrates. In scientific tests, only about 10% of people could detect a field intensity in the range of 2-5 kV/m. Such voltage differences can also create electric sparks, similar to a discharge of static electricity when nearly touching a grounded object. When receiving such a shock at 5 kV/m, it was reported as painful by only 7% of test participants and by 50% of participants at 10 kV/m.

Associations between exposure to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF MF) and various health outcomes have been investigated through a variety of epidemiological studies. A pooled analysis found consistent evidence of an effect of ELF-MF on childhood leukaemia. An assessment of the burden of disease potentially resulting from ELF MF exposure in Europe found that 1.5–2% of childhood leukaemia cases might be attributable to ELF MF, but uncertainties around causal mechanisms and models of dose-response were found to be considerable. 

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) finds &quot;inadequate evidence&quot; for human carcinogenicity.

===Shortwave===
Shortwave (1.6 to 30 MHz) diathermy (where EM waves are used to produce heat) can be used as a therapeutic technique for its analgesic effect and deep muscle relaxation, but has largely been replaced by ultrasound. Temperatures in muscles can increase by 4–6 °C, and subcutaneous fat by 15 °C. The FCC has restricted the frequencies allowed for medical treatment, and most machines in the US use 27.12 MHz. Shortwave diathermy can be applied in either continuous or pulsed mode. The latter came to prominence because the continuous mode produced too much heating too rapidly, making patients uncomfortable. The technique only heats tissues that are good electrical conductors, such as blood vessels and muscle. Adipose tissue (fat) receives little heating by induction fields because an electrical current is not actually going through the tissues.

Studies have been performed on the use of shortwave radiation for cancer therapy and promoting wound healing, with some success. However, at a sufficiently high energy level, shortwave energy can be harmful to human health, potentially causing damage to biological tissues, for example by overheating or inducing electrical currents. The FCC limits for maximum permissible workplace exposure to shortwave radio frequency energy in the range of 3–30 MHz has a plane-wave equivalent power density of where is the frequency in MHz, and 100 mW/cm2 from 0.3 to 3.0 MHz. For uncontrolled exposure to the general public, the limit is between 1.34 and 30 MHz.

===Radio and microwave frequencies===
The classification of mobile phone signals as &quot;possibly carcinogenic to humans&quot; by the World Health Organization (WHO)&quot;a positive association has been observed between exposure to the agent and cancer for which a causal interpretation is considered by the Working Group to be credible, but chance, bias or confounding could not be ruled out with reasonable confidence&quot;has been interpreted to mean that there is very little scientific evidence as to phone signal carcinogenesis.

In 2011, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified mobile phone radiation as group 2B, &quot;possibly carcinogenic,&quot; rather than group 2A (&quot;probably carcinogenic&quot;) or group 1 (&quot;is carcinogenic&quot;). That means that there &quot;could be some risk&quot; of carcinogenicity, so additional research into the long-term, heavy use of mobile phones needs to be conducted. The WHO concluded in 2014 that &quot;A large number of studies have been performed over the last two decades to assess whether mobile phones pose a potential health risk. To date, no adverse health effects have been established as being caused by mobile phone use.&quot;

Since 1962, the microwave auditory effect or tinnitus has been shown from radio frequency exposure at levels below significant heating. Studies during the 1960s in Europe and Russia claimed to show effects on humans, especially the nervous system, from low energy RF radiation; the studies were disputed at the time.

In 2019, reporters from the Chicago Tribune tested the level of radiation from smartphones and found that certain models emitted more than reported by the manufacturers and in some cases more than the U.S. Federal Communications Commission exposure limit. It is unclear if this resulted in any harm to consumers. Some problems apparently involved the phone&#x27;s ability to detect proximity to a human body and lower the radio power. In response, the FCC began testing some phones itself rather than relying solely on manufacturer certifications.

Microwave and other radio frequencies cause heating, and this can cause burns or eye damage if delivered in high intensity, or hyperthermia as with any powerful heat source. Microwave ovens use this form of radiation, and have shielding to prevent it from leaking out and unintentionally heating nearby objects or people.

===Millimeter waves===
In 2009, the US TSA introduced full-body scanners as a primary screening modality in airport security, first as backscatter X-ray scanners, which use ionizing radiation and which the European Union banned in 2011 due to health and safety concerns. These were followed by non-ionizing millimeter wave scanners. Likewise WiGig for personal area networks have opened the 60 GHz and above microwave band to SAR exposure regulations. Previously, microwave applications in these bands were for point-to-point satellite communication with minimal human exposure.

===Infrared===
Infrared wavelengths longer than 750 nm can produce changes in the lens of the eye. Glassblower&#x27;s cataract is an example of a heat injury that damages the anterior lens capsule among unprotected glass and iron workers. Cataract-like changes can occur in workers who observe glowing masses of glass or iron without protective eyewear for prolonged periods over many years.

Exposing skin to infrared radiation near visible light (IR-A) leads to increased production of free radicals. Short-term exposure can be beneficial (activating protective responses), while prolonged exposure can lead to photoaging.

Another important factor is the distance between the worker and the source of radiation. In the case of arc welding, infrared radiation decreases rapidly as a function of distance, so that farther than three feet away from where welding takes place, it does not pose an ocular hazard anymore but, ultraviolet radiation still does. This is why welders wear tinted glasses and surrounding workers only have to wear clear ones that filter UV.

===Visible light===
Photic retinopathy is damage to the macular area of the eye&#x27;s retina that results from prolonged exposure to sunlight, particularly with dilated pupils. This can happen, for example, while observing a solar eclipse without suitable eye protection. The Sun&#x27;s radiation creates a photochemical reaction that can result in visual dazzling and a scotoma. The initial lesions and edema will disappear after several weeks, but may leave behind a permanent reduction in visual acuity.

Moderate and high-power lasers are potentially hazardous because they can burn the retina of the eye, or even the skin. To control the risk of injury, various specifications – for example ANSI Z136 in the US, EN 60825-1/A2 in Europe, and IEC 60825 internationally – define &quot;classes&quot; of lasers depending on their power and wavelength. Regulations prescribe required safety measures, such as labeling lasers with specific warnings, and wearing laser safety goggles during operation (see laser safety).

As with its infrared and ultraviolet radiation dangers, welding creates an intense brightness in the visible light spectrum, which may cause temporary flash blindness. Some sources state that there is no minimum safe distance for exposure to these radiation emissions without adequate eye protection.

===Ultraviolet===
Sunlight includes sufficient ultraviolet power to cause sunburn within hours of exposure, and the burn severity increases with the duration of exposure. This effect is a response of the skin called erythema, which is caused by a sufficient strong dose of UV-B. The Sun&#x27;s UV output is divided into UV-A and UV-B: solar UV-A flux is 100 times that of UV-B, but the erythema response is 1,000 times higher for UV-B. This exposure can increase at higher altitudes and when reflected by snow, ice, or sand. The UV-B flux is 2–4 times greater during the middle 4–6 hours of the day, and is not significantly absorbed by cloud cover or up to a meter of water.

Ultraviolet light, specifically UV-B, has been shown to cause cataracts and there is some evidence that sunglasses worn at an early age can slow its development in later life. Most UV light from the sun is filtered out by the atmosphere and consequently airline pilots often have high rates of cataracts because of the increased levels of UV radiation in the upper atmosphere. It is hypothesized that depletion of the ozone layer and a consequent increase in levels of UV light on the ground may increase future rates of cataracts. Note that the lens filters UV light, so if it is removed via surgery, one may be able to see UV light.

Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the sun can lead to melanoma and other skin malignancies. Clear evidence establishes ultraviolet radiation, especially the non-ionizing medium wave UVB, as the cause of most non-melanoma skin cancers, which are the most common forms of cancer in the world. UV rays can also cause wrinkles, liver spots, moles, and freckles. In addition to sunlight, other sources include tanning beds, and bright desk lights. Damage is cumulative over one&#x27;s lifetime, so that permanent effects may not be evident for some time after exposure.

Ultraviolet radiation of wavelengths shorter than 300 nm (actinic rays) can damage the corneal epithelium. This is most commonly the result of exposure to the sun at high altitude, and in areas where shorter wavelengths are readily reflected from bright surfaces, such as snow, water, and sand. UV generated by a welding arc can similarly cause damage to the cornea, known as &quot;arc eye&quot; or welding flash burn, a form of photokeratitis.

Fluorescent light bulbs and tubes internally produce ultraviolet light. Normally this is converted to visible light by the phosphor film inside a protective coating. When the film is cracked by mishandling or faulty manufacturing then UV may escape at levels that could cause sunburn or even skin cancer.

==Regulation==
In the United States, non-ionizing radiation is regulated in the Radiation Control for Health and Safety Act of 1968 and the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. In Canada, various federal acts govern non-ionizing radiation by originating source, such as the Radiation Emitting Devices Act, the Canada Consumer Product Safety Act, and the Radiocommunication Act. For situations not under federal jurisdiction, Canadian provinces individually set regulations around use of non-ionizing radiation.

<text>In telecommunications, an electronic switching system (ESS) is a telephone switch that uses solid-state electronics, such as digital electronics and computerized common control, to interconnect telephone circuits for the purpose of establishing telephone calls.

The generations of telephone switches before the advent of electronic switching in the 1950s used purely electro-mechanical relay systems and analog voice paths. These early machines typically utilized the step-by-step technique. The first generation of electronic switching systems in the 1960s were not entirely digital in nature, but used reed relay-operated metallic paths or crossbar switches operated by stored program control (SPC) systems.

First announced in 1955, the first customer trial installation of an all-electronic central office commenced in Morris, Illinois in November 1960 by Bell Laboratories. The first large-scale electronic switching system was the Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS) of the Bell System, cut over in Succasunna, New Jersey, in May 1965.

Just three years later, in September 1968, Britain&#x27;s Post Office opened the world&#x27;s first all-digital pulse-code modulation (PCM) exchange named &quot;Empress&quot; (three decades after British scientist Alec Reeves had invented the PCM encoding system without the digital components to take full advantage). Other nations vying to reach the forefront of technical innovation would adopt metal–oxide–semiconductor (MOS) and PCM technologies to make their own transitions from analog to digital telephony throughout the &#x27;70s. Later electronic switching systems implemented the digital representation of the electrical audio signals on subscriber loops by digitizing the analog signals and processing the resulting data for transmission between central offices. Time-division multiplexing (TDM) technology permitted the simultaneous transmission of multiple telephone calls on a single wire connection between central offices or other electronic switches, resulting in dramatic capacity improvements of the telephone network.

With the advances of digital electronics starting in the 1960s telephone switches employed semiconductor device components in increasing measure.

In the late 20th century most telephone exchanges without TDM processing were eliminated and the term &quot;electronic switching system&quot; became largely a historical distinction for the older SPC systems.

<text>In military telecommunications, electronic support (ES) or electronic support measures (ESM) gather intelligence through passive &quot;listening&quot; to electromagnetic radiations of military interest. They are an aspect of electronic warfare involving actions taken under direct control of an operational commander to detect, intercept, identify, locate, record, and/or analyze sources of radiated electromagnetic energy for the purposes of immediate threat recognition (such as warning that fire control radar has locked on a combat vehicle, ship, or aircraft) or longer-term operational planning. Thus, electronic support provides a source of information required for decisions involving electronic protection (EP), electronic attack (EA), avoidance, targeting, and other tactical employment of forces. Electronic support data can be used to produce signals intelligence (SIGINT), communications intelligence (COMINT) and electronics intelligence (ELINT).

Electronic support measures can provide (1) initial detection or knowledge of foreign systems, (2) a library of technical and operational data on foreign systems, and (3) tactical combat information utilizing that library. ESM collection platforms can remain electronically silent and detect and analyze RADAR transmissions beyond the RADAR detection range because of the greater power of the transmitted electromagnetic pulse with respect to a reflected echo of that pulse. United States airborne ESM receivers are designated in the AN/ALR series.

Desirable characteristics for electromagnetic surveillance and collection equipment include (1) wide-spectrum or bandwidth capability because foreign frequencies are initially unknown, (2) wide dynamic range because the signal strength is initially unknown, (3) narrow bandpass to discriminate the signal of interest from other electromagnetic radiation on nearby frequencies, and (4) good angle-of arrival measurement for bearings to locate the transmitter. The frequency spectrum of interest ranges from 30 MHz to 50 GHz. Multiple receivers are typically required for surveillance of the entire spectrum, but tactical receivers may be functional within a specific signal strength threshold of a smaller frequency range.

<text>An electro–optic effect is a change in the optical properties of a material in response to an electric field that varies slowly compared with the frequency of light. The term encompasses a number of distinct phenomena, which can be subdivided into

* a) change of the absorption
** Electroabsorption: general change of the absorption constants
** Franz–Keldysh effect: change in the absorption shown in some bulk semiconductors
** Quantum-confined Stark effect: change in the absorption in some semiconductor quantum wells
** Electrochromic effect: creation of an absorption band at some wavelengths, which gives rise to a change in colour
* b) change of the refractive index and permittivity
** Pockels effect (or linear electro-optic effect): change in the refractive index linearly proportional to the electric field. Only certain crystalline solids show the Pockels effect, as it requires lack of inversion symmetry
** Kerr effect (or quadratic electro-optic effect, QEO effect): change in the refractive index proportional to the square of the electric field. All materials display the Kerr effect, with varying magnitudes, but it is generally much weaker than the Pockels effect
** electro-gyration: change in the optical activity.
** Electron-refractive effect or EIPM

In December 2015, two further electro-optic effects of type (b) were theoretically predicted to exist but have not, as yet, been experimentally observed.

Changes in absorption can have a strong effect on refractive index for wavelengths near the absorption edge, due to the Kramers–Kronig relation.

Using a less strict definition of the electro-optic effect allowing also electric fields oscillating at optical frequencies, one could also include nonlinear absorption (absorption depends on the light intensity) to category a) and the optical Kerr effect (refractive index depends on the light intensity) to category b). Combined with the photoeffect and photoconductivity, the electro-optic effect gives rise to the photorefractive effect.

The term &quot;electro-optic&quot; is often erroneously used as a synonym for &quot;optoelectronic&quot;.

==Applications==

===Electro-optic modulators===

Electro-optic modulators are usually built with electro-optic crystals exhibiting the Pockels effect. The transmitted beam is phase modulated with the electric signal applied to the crystal. Amplitude modulators can be built by putting the electro-optic crystal between two linear polarizers or in one path of a Mach–Zehnder interferometer.
Additionally, Amplitude modulators can be constructed by deflecting the beam into and out of a small aperture such as a fiber. This design can be low loss (&lt;3 dB) and polarization independent depending on the crystal configuration.

===Electro-optic deflectors===
Electro-optic deflectors utilize prisms of electro-optic crystals. The index of refraction is changed by the Pockels effect, thus changing the direction of propagation of the beam inside the prism. Electro-optic deflectors have only a small number of resolvable spots, but possess a fast response time. There are few commercial models available at this time. This is because of competing acousto-optic deflectors, the small number of resolvable spots and the relatively high price of electro-optic crystals.

===Electro-optic field sensors===
The electro-optic Pockels effect in nonlinear crystals (e.g. KDP, BSO, K*DP) can be used for electric field sensing via polarisation state modulation techniques. In this scenario, an unknown electric field results in polarisation rotation of a laser beam propagating through the electro-optic crystal; through inclusion of polarisers to modulate the light intensity incident on a photodiode, a time-resolved electric field measurement can be reconstructed from the obtained voltage trace. As the signals obtained from vgcc the crystalline probes are optical, they are inherently resistant to electrical noise pickup, hence can be used for low-noise field measurement even in areas with high levels of electromagnetic noise in the vicinity of the probe. Furthermore, as the polarisation rotation due to the Pockels effect scales linearly with electric field, &quot;absolute&quot; field measurements are obtained, with no need for numerical integration to reconstruct electric fields, as is the case with conventional probes sensitive to the time-derivative of the electric field. 

Electro-optic measurements of strong electromagnetic pulses from intense laser-matter interactions have been demonstrated in both the nanosecond and picosecond (sub-petawatt) laser pulse driver regimes.

<text>An electro-optic modulator (EOM) is an optical device in which a signal-controlled element exhibiting an electro-optic effect is used to modulate a beam of light. The modulation may be imposed on the phase, frequency, amplitude, or polarization of the beam. Modulation bandwidths extending into the gigahertz range are possible with the use of laser-controlled modulators.

The electro-optic effect describes two phenomena, the change of absorption and the change in the refractive index of a material, resulting from the application of a DC or an electric field with much lower frequency than the optical carrier. This is caused by forces that distort the position, orientation, or shape of the molecules constituting the material. Generally, a nonlinear optical material, such as ferroelectrics like lithium niobate (LiNbO3) or barium titanate (BaTiO3), polymers, or organic electro-optic materials, with an incident static or low frequency optical field will see a modulation of its refractive index.

The simplest kind of EOM consists of a crystal, such as lithium niobate, whose refractive index is a function of the strength of the local electric field. That means that if lithium niobate is exposed to an electric field, light will travel more slowly through it. But the phase of the light leaving the crystal is directly proportional to the length of time it takes that light to pass through it. Therefore, the phase of the laser light exiting an EOM can be controlled by changing the electric field in the crystal.

Note that the electric field can be created by placing a parallel plate capacitor across the crystal. Since the field inside a parallel plate capacitor depends linearly on the potential, the index of refraction depends linearly on the field (for crystals where Pockels effect dominates), and the phase depends linearly on the index of refraction, the phase modulation must depend linearly on the potential applied to the EOM.

The voltage required for inducing a phase change of formula_1 is called the half-wave voltage (formula_2). For a Pockels cell, it is usually hundreds or even thousands of volts, so that a high-voltage amplifier is required. Suitable electronic circuits can switch such large voltages within a few nanoseconds, allowing the use of EOMs as fast optical switches.

Liquid crystal devices are electro-optical phase modulators if no polarizers are used.

==Phase modulation==

Phase modulation (PM) is a modulation pattern that encodes information as variations in the instantaneous phase of a carrier wave.

The phase of a carrier signal is modulated to follow the changing voltage level (amplitude) of modulation signal. The peak amplitude and frequency of the carrier signal remain constant, but as the amplitude of the information signal changes, the phase of the carrier changes correspondingly. The analysis and the final result (modulated signal) are similar to those of frequency modulation.

A very common application of EOMs is for creating sidebands in a monochromatic laser beam. To see how this works, first imagine that the strength of a laser beam with frequency formula_3 entering the EOM is given by

:formula_4

Now suppose we apply a sinusoidally varying potential voltage to the EOM with frequency formula_5 and small amplitude formula_6. This adds a time dependent phase to the above expression,

:formula_7

Since formula_6 is small, we can use the Taylor expansion for the exponential

:formula_9

to which we apply a simple identity for sine,

:formula_10

This expression we interpret to mean that we have the original carrier signal plus two small sidebands, one at formula_11 and another at formula_12. Notice however that we only used the first term in the Taylor expansion – in truth there are an infinite number of sidebands. There is a useful identity involving Bessel functions called the Jacobi–Anger expansion which can be used to derive

:formula_13

which gives the amplitudes of all the sidebands. Notice that if one modulates the amplitude instead of the phase, one gets only the first set of sidebands,

:formula_14

==Amplitude modulation==

A phase modulating EOM can also be used as an amplitude modulator by using a Mach–Zehnder interferometer. This alternative technique is often used in integrated optics where the requirements of phase stability is more easily achieved. The beam splitter divides the laser light into two paths, one of which has a phase modulator as described above. The beams are then recombined. Changing the electric field on the phase modulating path will then determine whether the two beams interfere constructively or destructively at the output, and thereby control the amplitude or intensity of the exiting light. This device is called a Mach–Zehnder modulator (MZM) and it is widely used as intensity modulator (IM) in fiber-optic communications.

==Polarization modulation==

Depending on the type and orientation of the nonlinear crystal, and on the direction of the applied electric field, the phase delay can depend on the polarization direction. A Pockels cell can thus be seen as a voltage-controlled waveplate, and it can be used for modulating the polarization state. For a linear input polarization (often oriented at 45° to the crystal axis), the output polarization will in general be elliptical, rather than simply a linear polarization state with a rotated direction.

Polarization modulation in electro-optic crystals can also be used as a technique for time-resolved measurement of unknown electric fields.
Compared to conventional techniques using conductive field probes and cabling for signal transport to read-out systems, electro-optical measurement is inherently noise resistant as signals are carried by fiber-optics, preventing distortion of the signal by electrical noise sources. The polarization change measured by such techniques is linearly dependent on the electric field applied to the crystal, hence providing absolute measurements of the field, without the need for numerical integration of voltage traces, as is the case for conductive probes sensitive to the time-derivative of the electric field.

== EOM technologies ==
EOMs can be based on many operating principles and platforms. One can divide the EOMs in two categories – phase and amplitude modulation. In the following some prominent approaches in SiPh are presented. Operating principles for phase modulation are the plasma dispersion effect, pockels effect, interband transitions, and carrier accumulation/depletion+Franz-Keldysh effect. For the amplitude modulation some operating principles are the Franz-Keldysh effect, quantum confined Stark effect, and electrical gating.

The plasma dispersion effect can be based on carrier injection, depletion, or accumulation. The most established Pockels type modulators are based on the lithium niobate on silicon platform. In recent years, other platforms were introduced, such as BTO on silicon, silicon polymer hybrid, silicon organic hybrids, plasmonics and thin-film lithium niobate. Interband transition rely on 2D materials and the carrier accumulation/depletion+Franz-Keldysh is based on a III-V platform.

The Franz-Keldysh effect is used in electro-absorption modulators which are semiconductor devices. It describes a change in the absorption spectrum due to a shift in the band gap edge when an electric field is present. They are often built on a silicon-germanium platform. Modulators running on the quantum confined stark effect can rely on a III-V platform or on Ge-Si-Ge quantum wells. Electrical gating is built on a 2D material platform.

<text>Electro–optics is a branch of electrical engineering, electronic engineering, materials science, and material physics involving components, electronic devices such as lasers, laser diodes, LEDs, waveguides, etc. which operate by the propagation and interaction of light with various tailored materials. It is closely related to photonics, the branch of optics that involves the application of the generation of photons. It is not only concerned with the &quot;electro–optic effect&quot;, since it deals with the interaction between the electromagnetic () and the () states of materials.

== Electro-optical devices ==
The electro-optic effect is a change in the optical properties of an optically active material in response to changes in an electric field. This interaction usually results in a change in the birefringence, and not simply the refractive index of the medium. In a Kerr cell, the change in birefringence is proportional to the square of the electric field, and the material is usually a liquid. In a Pockels cell, the change in birefringence varies linearly with the electric field, and the material is usually a crystal. Non-crystalline, solid electro-optical materials have generated interest because of their low cost of production. These organic, polymer-based materials are also known as organic EO material, plastic EO material, or polymer EO material. They consist of nonlinear optical chromophores in a polymer lattice. The nonlinear optical chromophores can produce Pockels effect.

<text>In electrodynamics, elliptical polarization is the polarization of electromagnetic radiation such that the tip of the electric field vector describes an ellipse in any fixed plane intersecting, and normal to, the direction of propagation. An elliptically polarized wave may be resolved into two linearly polarized waves in phase quadrature, with their polarization planes at right angles to each other. Since the electric field can rotate clockwise or counterclockwise as it propagates, elliptically polarized waves exhibit chirality.

&quot;Circular polarization&quot; and &quot;linear polarization&quot; can be considered to be special cases of &quot;elliptical polarization&quot;. This terminology was introduced by Augustin-Jean Fresnel in 1822, before the electromagnetic nature of light waves was known.

==Mathematical description==
The classical sinusoidal plane wave solution of the electromagnetic wave equation for the electric and magnetic fields is (Gaussian units)

:formula_1

:formula_2

for the magnetic field, where k is the wavenumber,

:formula_3

is the angular frequency of the wave propagating in the +z direction, and formula_4 is the speed of light.

Here formula_5 is the amplitude of the field and

:formula_6

is the normalized Jones vector. This is the most complete representation of polarized electromagnetic radiation and corresponds in general to elliptical polarization.

==Polarization ellipse==
At a fixed point in space (or for fixed z), the electric vector formula_7 traces out an ellipse in the x-y plane. The semi-major and semi-minor axes of the ellipse have lengths A and B, respectively, that are given by
:formula_8 
and 
:formula_9,
where formula_10 with the phases formula_11 and formula_12.
The orientation of the ellipse is given by the angle formula_13 the semi-major axis makes with the x-axis. This angle can be calculated from
:formula_14.
If formula_15, the wave is linearly polarized. The ellipse collapses to a straight line formula_16) oriented at an angle formula_17. This is the case of superposition of two simple harmonic motions (in phase), one in the x direction with an amplitude formula_18, and the other in the y direction with an amplitude formula_19. When formula_20 increases from zero, i.e., assumes positive values, the line evolves into an ellipse that is being traced out in the counterclockwise direction (looking in the direction of the propagating wave); this then corresponds to &quot;left-handed elliptical polarization&quot;; the semi-major axis is now oriented at an angle formula_21. Similarly, if formula_20 becomes negative from zero, the line evolves into an ellipse that is being traced out in the clockwise direction; this corresponds to &quot;right-handed elliptical polarization&quot;.

If formula_23 and formula_24, formula_25, i.e., the wave is circularly polarized. When formula_26, the wave is left-circularly polarized, and when formula_27, the wave is right-circularly polarized.

===Parameterization===
 Any fixed polarization can be described in terms of the shape and orientation of the polarization ellipse, which is defined by two parameters: axial ratio AR and tilt angle formula_28. The axial ratio is the ratio of the lengths of the major and minor axes of the ellipse, and is always greater than or equal to one.

Alternatively, polarization can be represented as a point on the surface of the Poincaré sphere, with formula_29 as the longitude and formula_30 as the latitude, where formula_31. The sign used in the argument of the formula_32 depends on the handedness of the polarization. Positive indicates left hand polarization, while negative indicates right hand polarization, as defined by IEEE.

For the special case of circular polarization, the axial ratio equals 1 (or 0 dB) and the tilt angle is undefined. For the special case of linear polarization, the axial ratio is infinite.

==In nature==
The reflected light from some beetles (e.g. &quot;Cetonia aurata&quot;) is elliptical polarized.

<text>In signal processing, pre-emphasis is a technique to protect against anticipated noise and loss. The idea is to boost (and hence distort) the frequency range that is most susceptible to noise and loss beforehand, so that after a noisy and lossy process (transmission over cable, tape recording...) more information can be recovered from that frequency range. Removal of the distortion caused by pre-emphasis is called de-emphasis, making the output accurately reproduce the original input.

Emphasis is commonly used in many places ranging from FM broadcasting (preemphasis improvement) and vinyl (e.g. LP) records to PCI Express. For example, high-frequency signal components may be emphasized to produce a more equal modulation index for a transmitted frequency spectrum, and therefore a better signal-to-noise ratio for the entire frequency range.

== In audio signals ==
In processing electronic audio signals, pre-emphasis refers to a system process designed to increase (within a frequency band) the magnitude of some (usually higher) frequencies with respect to the magnitude of other (usually lower) frequencies in order to improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio by minimizing the adverse effects of such phenomena as attenuation distortion or saturation of recording media in subsequent parts of the system. The mirror operation is called de-emphasis, and the system as a whole is called emphasis.

Pre-emphasis is achieved with a pre-emphasis network which is essentially a calibrated filter. The frequency response is decided by special time constants. The cutoff frequency can be calculated from that value.

Pre-emphasis is commonly used in telecommunications, digital audio recording, record cutting, in FM broadcasting transmissions, and in displaying the spectrograms of speech signals. One example of this is the RIAA equalization curve on 33 rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records. Another is the Dolby noise-reduction system as used with magnetic tape.

Pre-emphasis is employed in frequency modulation or phase modulation transmitters to equalize the modulating signal drive power in terms of deviation ratio. The receiver demodulation process includes a reciprocal network, called a de-emphasis network, to restore the original signal power distribution.

=== De-emphasis ===
In telecommunications, de-emphasis is the complement of pre-emphasis, in the antinoise system called emphasis. De-emphasis is a system process designed to decrease, (within a band of frequencies), the magnitude of some (usually higher) frequencies with respect to the magnitude of other (usually lower) frequencies in order to improve the overall signal-to-noise ratio by minimizing the adverse effects of such phenomena as attenuation distortion or saturation of recording media in subsequent parts of the system.

Special time constants dictate the frequency response curve, from which one can calculate the cutoff frequency.

=== Red Book audio ===
Although rarely used, there exists the capability for standardized emphasis in Red Book CD mastering. As CD players were originally implemented with affordable 14-bit converters, a specification for pre-emphasis was included to compensate for quantization noise. After economies of scale eventually allowed full 16 bits, quantization noise became less of a concern, but emphasis remained an option. The pre-emphasis is described as a first-order filter with a gain of 10 dB (at 20 dB/decade) and time constants 50 μs and 15 μs.

== In digital transmission ==

In serial data transmission, emphasis is used to improve signal quality at the output of a communication channel. In transmitting signals at high data rates, the transmission medium may introduce distortions, so emphasis is used to distort the transmitted signal to correct for this distortion. When done properly this produces a received signal that more closely resembles the original or desired signal, allowing the use of higher data rates or producing fewer bit errors. Most real world channels have loss that increases with frequency (effectively a low pass filter), so emphasis needs to invert this effect (functioning as a high pass filter). This makes emphasis a form of equalization, implemented at the transmit side of the channel.

Emphasis can be implemented either by boosting high frequencies (pre-emphasis, increasing the amplitude of transition bits) or attenuating low frequencies (de-emphasis, reducing the amplitude of non-transition bits). Both have the same net effect of producing a flatter system frequency response; de-emphasis is typically more convenient to do in real circuits since it only requires attenuation rather than amplification. Well-known serial data standards such as PCI Express, SATA and SAS require transmitted signals to use de-emphasis.

One common implementation of emphasis in real SERDES is a 3-tap feed-forward equalizer (FFE): rather than driving the output pin with the desired output voltage directly, the actual output voltage is a weighted sum of the desired bit value (main cursor), the previous bit (post cursor), and the next bit to be transmitted (pre cursor). The main cursor coefficient controls the nominal amplitude of the bit and is always positive (as a negative coefficient would invert the bit value). The pre cursor coefficient removes ISI at the receiver caused by bits which have not yet arrived (e.g. fields coupling across meanders in a delay-matched trace) and is typically zero or a very small negative value, as this is often not a major contribution to total ISI. The post cursor coefficient removes ISI at the receiver caused by the immediately preceding bit and is typically a larger negative value, with lossier channels requiring a larger tap value. Higher numbers of taps are possible but increase circuit complexity and tend to result in diminishing returns so are not commonly used.

The effects of emphasis on a signal can be clearly seen in the eye pattern. In the following demonstration, we consider a 10.3125 Gbps PRBS-31 test pattern with NRZ modulation, typical for testing 10-Gigabit Ethernet. The channel has an insertion loss of roughly 2 dB at the fundamental, 3 dB at the 2nd harmonic, and 4 dB at the 3rd. The goal is to achieve a well-equalized channel response in which the eye is maximally open without excessive overshoot. Excessive equalization can worsen jitter, increase overshoot, and result in a less open eye than a properly equalized signal.

<text>In start-stop teletypewriter operation, end distortion refers to the shifting of the end of all marking pulses, except the stop pulse, from their proper positions in relation to the beginning of the next start pulse. 

Shifting of the end of the stop pulse is a deviation in character time and rate rather than an end distortion. 

Spacing end distortion is the termination of marking pulses before the proper time. Marking end distortion is the continuation of marking pulses past the proper time. 

The magnitude of the distortion is expressed as a percentage of an ideal pulse length.

<doc id="41110" wikidata="Q3658211" url="?curid=41110" title="End-of-Transmission character">
<text>In telecommunications, an End-of-Transmission character (EOT) is a transmission control character. Its intended use is to indicate the conclusion of a transmission that may have included one or more texts and any associated message headings.

An EOT is often used to initiate other functions, such as releasing circuits, disconnecting terminals, or placing receive terminals in a standby condition. Its most common use today is to cause a Unix terminal driver to signal end of file and thus exit programs that are awaiting input.

In ASCII and Unicode, the character is encoded at . It can be referred to as , in caret notation. Unicode provides the character for when EOT needs to be displayed graphically. In addition, can also be used as a graphic representation of EOT; it is defined in Unicode as &quot;symbol for End of Transmission&quot;.

== Meaning in Unix ==

The EOT character in Unix is different from the Control-Z in DOS. The DOS Control-Z byte is actually sent and/or placed in files to indicate where the text ends. In contrast, the Control-D causes the Unix terminal driver to signal the EOF condition, which is not a character, while the byte has no special meaning if actually read or written from a file or terminal.

In Unix, the end-of-file character (by default EOT) causes the terminal driver to make available all characters in its input buffer immediately; normally the driver would collect characters until it sees an end-of-line character. If the input buffer is empty (because no characters have been typed since the last end-of-line or end-of-file), a program reading from the terminal reads a count of zero bytes. In Unix, such a condition is understood as having reached the end of the file.

This can be demonstrated with the program on Unix-like operating systems such as Linux: Run the command with no arguments, so it accepts its input from the keyboard and prints output to the screen. Type a few characters without pressing , then type . The characters typed to that point are sent to cat, which then writes them to the screen. If is typed without typing any characters first, the input stream is terminated and the program ends. An actual EOT is obtained by typing then .

If the terminal driver is in &quot;raw&quot; mode, it no longer interprets control characters, and the EOT character is sent unchanged to the program, which is free to interpret it any way it likes. A program may then decide to handle the EOT byte as an indication that it should end the text; this would then be similar to how is handled by DOS programs.

== Usage in mainframe computer system communications protocols ==

The EOT character is used in legacy communications protocols by mainframe computer manufacturers such as IBM, Burroughs Corporation, and the BUNCH. Terminal transmission control protocols such as IBM 3270 Poll/Select, or Burroughs TD830 Contention Mode protocol use the EOT character to terminate a communications sequence between two cooperating stations (such as a host multiplexer or Input/Output terminal).

A single Poll (ask the station for data) or Select (send data to the station) operation will include two round-trip send-reply operations between the polling station and the station being polled, the final operation being transmission of a single EOT character to the initiating station.

<text>In telecommunications, endurability is the property of a system, subsystem, equipment, or process that enables it to continue to function within specified performance limits for an extended period of time, usually months, despite a severe natural or man-made disturbance, such as a nuclear attack, or a loss of external logistic or utility support. 

Endurability is not compromised by temporary failures when the local capability exists to restore and maintain the system, subsystem, equipment, or process to an acceptable performance level.

<text>In chronology and periodization, an epoch or reference epoch is an instant in time chosen as the origin of a particular calendar era. The &quot;epoch&quot; serves as a reference point from which time is measured.

The moment of epoch is usually decided by congruity, or by following conventions understood from the epoch in question. The epoch moment or date is usually defined from a specific, clear event of change, an &quot;epoch event&quot;. In a more gradual change, a deciding moment is chosen when the &quot;epoch criterion&quot; was reached.

== Calendar eras ==
=== Pre-modern eras ===
* The Yoruba calendar (&quot;Kọ́jọ́dá&quot;) uses 8042 BC as the epoch, regarded as the year of the creation of Ile-Ife by the god Obatala, also regarded as the creation of the earth.
* &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; (years since the creation of the world) is used in the Byzantine calendar (5509 BC).
* &quot;Anno Mundi&quot; (years since the creation of the world) as used in the Hebrew calendar (3761 BC).
* The Mesoamerican Long Count Calendar uses the creation of the fourth world in 3114 BC.
* Olympiads, the ancient Greek era of four-year periods between Olympic Games, beginning in 776 BC.
* &quot;Ab urbe condita&quot; (&quot;from the foundation of the city&quot;), used to some extent by Roman calendars of the Roman imperial period (753 BC).
* Buddhist calendars tend to use the epoch of 544 BC (date of Buddha&#x27;s &quot;parinirvana&quot;).
* The term Hindu calendar may refer to a number of traditional Indian calendars. A notable example of a Hindu epoch is the &quot;Vikram Samvat&quot; (58 BC), also used in modern times as the national calendars of Nepal and Bangladesh.
* The Julian and Gregorian calendars use as epoch the Incarnation of Jesus as calculated in the 6th century by Dionysius Exiguus. (Subsequent research has shown that this moment is about four years after the best estimate for the date of birth of Jesus.) This epoch was applied retrospectively to the Julian calendar, long after its original creation by Julius Caesar. 
* The epoch of the Islamic calendar is the &quot;Hijra&quot; (AD 622). The year count in this calendar shifts relative to the solar year count, as the calendar is purely lunar: its year consists of 12 lunations and is thus ten or eleven days shorter than a solar year. This calendar denotes &quot;lunar years&quot; as &quot;Anno Hegiræ&quot; ([since] the year of the &quot;Hijra&quot;) or &quot;AH&quot;. This calendar is used in Sunni Islam and related sects.
* The epoch of the official Iranian calendar is also the &quot;Hijra&quot;, but it is a solar calendar; each year begins at the Northern spring equinox. This calendar is used in Shia Islam and related sects.

=== Modern eras ===
* The Bahá&#x27;í calendar is dated from the vernal equinox of the year the Báb proclaimed his religion (AD 1844). Years are grouped in &quot;Váḥids&quot; of 19 years, and &quot;Kull-i-Shay&quot; of 361 (19×19) years.
* In Thailand in 1888 King Chulalongkorn decreed a National Thai Era dating from the founding of Bangkok on April 6, 1782. In 1912, New Year&#x27;s Day was shifted to April 1. In 1941, Prime Minister Phibunsongkhram decided to count the years since 543 BC. This is the Thai solar calendar using the Thai Buddhist Era. Except for this era, it is the Gregorian calendar.
* In the French Republican Calendar, a calendar used by the French government for about twelve years from late 1793, the epoch was the beginning of the &quot;Republican Era&quot;, September 22, 1792 (the day the French First Republic was proclaimed, one day after the Convention abolished the &quot;Ancien Regime&quot;).
* The Indian national calendar, introduced in 1957, follows the Saka era (AD 78).
* The Minguo calendar used by officials of Taiwan and its predecessor dates from January 1, 1912, the first year after the Xinhai Revolution, which overthrew the Qing Empire.
* North Korea uses a system that starts in 1912 (= Juche 1), the year of the birth of its founder Kim Il-Sung.
* The Fascist Era dates to Mussolini&#x27;s March on Rome in 1922, and was in use only in countries under hegemony of the Fascist regime of Benito Mussolini. It has been defunct since the fall of the Italian Social Republic in 1945. 
* In the scientific Before Present system of numbering years for purposes of radiocarbon dating, the reference date is January 1, 1950 (though the specific date January 1 is quite unnecessary, as radiocarbon dating has limited precision).
* Different branches of Freemasonry have selected different years to date their documents according to a Masonic era, such as the &quot;Anno Lucis&quot; (A.L.).
* The Holocene calendar uses 10,000 BC as the epoch, the beginning of the Holocene epoch on the geological time scale.

=== Regnal eras ===

The official Japanese system numbers years from the accession of the current emperor, regarding the calendar year during which the accession occurred as the first year. A similar system existed in China before 1912, being based on the accession year of the emperor (1911 was thus the third year of the Xuantong period). With the establishment of the Republic of China in 1912, the republican era was introduced. It is still very common in Taiwan to date events via the republican era. The People&#x27;s Republic of China adopted the common era calendar in 1949 (the 38th year of the Chinese Republic).

=== Fictional Eras ===
* Events in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe are conventionally dated using an epoch of the Battle of Yavin.

== Other applications ==

An epoch in computing is the time at which the representation is zero. For example, Unix time is represented as the number of seconds since 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970, not counting leap seconds. 

An epoch in astronomy is a reference time used for consistency in calculation of positions and orbits. A common astronomical epoch is J2000, which is noon on January 1, 2000, Terrestrial Time.

An epoch in Geochronology is a time period, typically in the order of tens of millions of years. The current epoch is the Holocene.

<text>In telecommunications, equivalent pulse code modulation (PCM) noise is the amount of noise power on a frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) or wire communication channel necessary to approximate the same judgment of speech quality created by quantization noise in a PCM channel. 

:&quot;Note 1: The speech quality judgment is based on comparative tests.&quot;

:&quot;Note 2: Generally, 33.5 dBrnC ±2.5 dB is considered the approximate equivalent PCM noise of a 7-bit PCM system.&quot;
