<text>Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR ) is a method for allocating IP addresses for IP routing. The Internet Engineering Task Force introduced CIDR in 1993 to replace the previous classful network addressing architecture on the Internet. Its goal was to slow the growth of routing tables on routers across the Internet, and to help slow the rapid exhaustion of IPv4 addresses.

IP addresses are described as consisting of two groups of bits in the address: the most significant bits are the network prefix, which identifies a whole network or subnet, and the least significant set forms the &quot;host identifier&quot;, which specifies a particular interface of a host on that network. This division is used as the basis of traffic routing between IP networks and for address allocation policies.

Whereas classful network design for IPv4 sized the network prefix as one or more 8-bit groups, resulting in the blocks of Class A, B, or C addresses, under CIDR address space is allocated to Internet service providers and end users on any address-bit boundary. In IPv6, however, the interface identifier has a fixed size of 64 bits by convention, and smaller subnets are never allocated to end users.

CIDR is based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM), in which network prefixes have variable length (as opposed to the fixed-length prefixing of the previous classful network design). The main benefit of this is that it grants finer control of the sizes of subnets allocated to organizations, hence slowing the exhaustion of IPv4 addresses from allocating larger subnets than needed. CIDR gave rise to a new way of writing IP addresses known as CIDR notation, in which an IP address is followed by a suffix indicating the number of bits of the prefix. Some examples of CIDR notation are the addresses for IPv4 and for IPv6. Blocks of addresses having contiguous prefixes may be aggregated as supernets, reducing the number of entries in the global routing table.

==Background==
Each IP address consists of a network prefix followed by a host identifier. In the classful network architecture of IPv4, the three most significant bits of the 32-bit IP address defined the size of the network prefix for unicast networking, and determined the network class A, B, or C.

The advantage of this system is that the network prefix could be determined for any IP address without any further information. The disadvantage is that networks were usually too big or too small for most organizations to use, because only three sizes were available. The smallest allocation and routing block contained 28 = 256 addresses, larger than necessary for personal or department networks, but too small for most enterprises. The next larger block contained 216 = addresses, too large to be used efficiently even by large organizations. But for network users who needed more than addresses, the only other size (224) provided far too many, more than 16 million. This led to inefficiencies in address use as well as inefficiencies in routing, because it required a large number of allocated class-C networks with individual route announcements, being geographically dispersed with little opportunity for route aggregation.

Within a decade after the invention of the Domain Name System (DNS), the classful network method was found not scalable. This led to the development of subnetting and CIDR. The formerly meaningful class distinctions based on the most-significant address bits were abandoned and the new system was described as &quot;classless&quot;, in contrast to the old system, which became known as &quot;classful&quot;. Routing protocols were revised to carry not just IP addresses, but also their subnet masks. Implementing CIDR required every host and router on the Internet to be reprogrammed in small ways—no small feat at a time when the Internet was entering a period of rapid growth. In 1993, the Internet Engineering Task Force published a new set of standards, and , to define this new principle for allocating IP address blocks and routing IPv4 packets. An updated version, , was published in 2006.

After a period of experimentation with various alternatives, Classless Inter-Domain Routing was based on variable-length subnet masking (VLSM), which allows each network to be divided into subnetworks of various power-of-two sizes, so that each subnetwork can be sized appropriately for local needs. Variable-length subnet masks were mentioned as one alternative in . Techniques for grouping addresses for common operations were based on the concept of cluster addressing, first proposed by Carl-Herbert Rokitansky.

==CIDR notation==
CIDR notation is a compact representation of an IP address and its associated network mask. The notation was invented by Phil Karn in the 1980s. CIDR notation specifies an IP address, a slash (&#x27;/&#x27;) character, and a decimal number. The decimal number is the count of consecutive leading &quot;1&quot;-bits (from left to right) in the network mask. Each 1-bit denotes a bit of the address range which must remain identical to the given IP address. The IP address in CIDR notation is always represented according to the standards for IPv4 or IPv6.

The address may denote a specific interface address (including a host identifier, such as ), or it may be the beginning address of an entire network (using a host identifier of 0, as in or its equivalent ). CIDR notation can even be used with no IP address at all, e.g. when referring to a as a generic description of an IPv4 network that has a 24-bit prefix and 8-bit host numbers.

For example:
* represents the IPv4 address and its associated network prefix , or equivalently, its subnet mask , which has 24 leading &quot;1&quot;-bits.
* the IPv4 block represents the 1024 IPv4 addresses from to .
* the IPv6 block represents the block of IPv6 addresses from to .
* represents the IPv6 loopback address. Its prefix length is 128 which is the number of bits in the address.

In IPv4, CIDR notation came into wide use only after the implementation of the method, which was documented using dotted-decimal subnet mask specification after the slash, for example, . Describing the network prefix width as a single number () was easier for network administrators to conceptualize and to calculate. It became gradually incorporated into later standards documents and into network configuration interfaces.

The number of addresses of a network may be calculated as 2address length − prefix length, where &quot;address length&quot; is 128 for IPv6 and 32 for IPv4. For example, in IPv4, the prefix length gives: 232−29 = 23 = 8 addresses.

==Subnet masks==
A subnet mask is a bitmask that encodes the prefix length associated with an IPv4 address or network in quad-dotted notation: 32 bits, starting with a number of &quot;1&quot;-bits equal to the prefix length, ending with &quot;0&quot;-bits, and encoded in four-part dotted-decimal format: . A subnet mask encodes the same information as a prefix length but predates the advent of CIDR. In CIDR notation, the prefix bits are always contiguous. Subnet masks were allowed by to specify non-contiguous bits until stated that the mask must be left contiguous. Given this constraint, a subnet mask and CIDR notation serve exactly the same function.

==CIDR blocks==
CIDR is principally a bitwise, prefix-based standard for the representation of IP addresses and their routing properties. It facilitates routing by allowing blocks of addresses to be grouped into single routing table entries. These groups, commonly called CIDR blocks, share an initial sequence of bits in the binary representation of their IP addresses. IPv4 CIDR blocks are identified using a syntax similar to that of IPv4 addresses: a dotted-decimal address, followed by a slash, then a number from 0 to 32, i.e., . The dotted decimal portion is the IPv4 address. The number following the slash is the prefix length, the number of shared initial bits, counting from the most-significant bit of the address. When emphasizing only the size of a network, the address portion of the notation is usually omitted. Thus, a /20 block is a CIDR block with an unspecified 20-bit prefix.

An IP address is part of a CIDR block and is said to match the CIDR prefix if the initial &quot;n&quot; bits of the address and the CIDR prefix are the same. An IPv4 address is 32 bits so an &quot;n&quot;-bit CIDR prefix leaves 32 − &quot;n&quot; bits unmatched, meaning that 232−&quot;n&quot; IPv4 addresses match a given &quot;n&quot;-bit CIDR prefix. Shorter CIDR prefixes match more addresses, while longer prefixes match fewer. In the case of overlaid CIDR blocks, an address can match multiple CIDR prefixes of different lengths.

CIDR is also used for IPv6 addresses and the syntax semantic is identical. The prefix length can range from 0 to 128, due to the larger number of bits in the address. However, by convention, a subnet on broadcast MAC layer networks always has 64-bit host identifiers. Larger prefixes (/127) are only used on some point-to-point links between routers, for security and policy reasons.

===Assignment of CIDR blocks===
The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) issues to regional Internet registries (RIRs) large, short-prefix CIDR blocks. However, a (with over sixteen million addresses) is the largest block IANA will allocate. For example, is administered by RIPE NCC, the European RIR. The RIRs, each responsible for a single, large, geographic area, such as Europe or North America, subdivide these blocks and allocate subnets to local Internet registries (LIRs). Similar subdividing may be repeated several times at lower levels of delegation. End-user networks receive subnets sized according to their projected short-term need. Networks served by a single ISP are encouraged by IETF recommendations to obtain IP address space directly from their ISP. Networks served by multiple ISPs, on the other hand, may obtain provider-independent address space directly from the appropriate RIR.
For example, in the late 1990s, the IP address (since reassigned) was used by www.freesoft.org. An analysis of this address identified three CIDR prefixes. , a large CIDR block containing over 2 million addresses, had been assigned by ARIN (the North American RIR) to MCI. Automation Research Systems (ARS), a Virginia VAR, leased an Internet connection from MCI and was assigned the block, capable of addressing just over 1000 devices. ARS used a block for its publicly accessible servers, of which was one. All of these CIDR prefixes would be used, at different locations in the network. Outside MCI&#x27;s network, the prefix would be used to direct to MCI traffic bound not only for , but also for any of the roughly two million IP addresses with the same initial 11 bits. Within MCI&#x27;s network, would become visible, directing traffic to the leased line serving ARS. Only within the ARS corporate network would the prefix have been used.

===IPv4 CIDR blocks===
In common usage, the first address in a subnet, all binary zero in the host identifier, is reserved for referring to the network itself, while the last address, all binary one in the host identifier, is used as a broadcast address for the network; this reduces the number of addresses available for hosts by 2. As a result, a network, with one binary digit in the host identifier, would be unusable, as such a subnet would provide no available host addresses after this reduction. creates an exception to the &quot;host all ones&quot; and &quot;host all zeros&quot; rules to make networks usable for point-to-point links. addresses (single-host network) must be accessed by explicit routing rules, as there is no room in such a network for a gateway.

In routed subnets larger than or , the number of available host addresses is usually reduced by two, namely the largest address, which is reserved as the broadcast address, and the smallest address, which identifies the network itself.

===IPv6 CIDR blocks===

The large address size of IPv6 permitted worldwide route summarization and guaranteed sufficient address pools at each site. The standard subnet size for IPv6 networks is a block, which is required for the operation of stateless address autoconfiguration. At first, the IETF recommended in as a best practice that all end sites receive a address allocation, but criticism and reevaluation of actual needs and practices has led to more flexible allocation recommendations in suggesting a significantly smaller allocation for some sites, such as a block for residential networks.

This IPv6 subnetting reference lists the sizes for IPv6 subnetworks. Different types of network links may require different subnet sizes. The subnet mask separates the bits of the network identifier prefix from the bits of the interface identifier. Selecting a smaller prefix size results in fewer number of networks covered, but with more addresses within each network.

==Numerical interpretation==
Topologically, the set of subnets described by CIDR represent a cover of the corresponding address space. The interval described by the notation formula_1 numerically corresponds to addresses of the form (for IPv4) formula_2, where formula_3 has the lower formula_4 bits set to 0. (For IPv6, substitute 128.) For a fixed formula_4, the set of all formula_1 subnets constitute a partition, that is a cover of non-overlapping sets. Increasing formula_4 yields finer and finer subpartitions. Thus two subnets formula_1 and formula_9 are either disjoint or one is a subnet of the other.

==Prefix aggregation==
CIDR provides fine-grained routing prefix aggregation. For example, if the first 20 bits of their network prefixes match, sixteen contiguous networks can be aggregated and advertised to a larger network as a single routing table entry. This reduces the number of routes that have to be advertised.

<text>Humour (Commonwealth English) or humor (American English) is the tendency of experiences to provoke laughter and provide amusement. The term derives from the humoral medicine of the ancient Greeks, which taught that the balance of fluids in the human body, known as humours (Latin: &quot;&quot;, &quot;body fluid&quot;), controlled human health and emotion.

People of all ages and cultures respond to humour. Most people are able to experience humour—be amused, smile or laugh at something funny (such as a pun or joke)—and thus are considered to have a &quot;sense of humour&quot;. The hypothetical person lacking a sense of humour would likely find the behaviour to be inexplicable, strange, or even irrational. Though ultimately decided by subjective personal taste, the extent to which a person finds something humorous depends on a host of variables, including geographical location, culture, maturity, level of education, intelligence and . For example, young children may favour slapstick such as Punch and Judy puppet shows or cartoons such as &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot; or &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, whose physical nature makes it accessible to them. By contrast, more sophisticated forms of humour such as satire require an understanding of its social meaning and context, and thus tend to appeal to a more mature audience.

==Theories==

Many theories exist about what humour is and what social function it serves. The prevailing types of theories attempting to account for the existence of humour include psychological theories, the vast majority of which consider humour-induced behaviour to be very healthy; spiritual theories, which may, for instance, consider humour to be a &quot;gift from God&quot;; and theories which consider humour to be an unexplainable mystery, very much like a mystical experience.

The benign-violation theory, endorsed by Peter McGraw, attempts to explain humour&#x27;s existence. The theory says &quot;humour only occurs when something seems wrong, unsettling, or threatening, but simultaneously seems okay, acceptable or safe.&quot; Humour can be used as a method to easily engage in social interaction by taking away that awkward, uncomfortable, or uneasy feeling of social interactions.

Others believe that &quot;the appropriate use of humour can facilitate social interactions&quot;.

==Views==
Some claim that humour should not be explained. Author E. B. White once said, &quot;Humor can be dissected as a frog can, but the thing dies in the process and the innards are discouraging to any but the pure scientific mind.&quot; Counter to this argument, protests against &quot;offensive&quot; cartoons invite the dissection of humour or its lack by aggrieved individuals and communities. This process of dissecting humour does not necessarily banish a sense of humour but directs attention towards its politics and assumed universality.

Arthur Schopenhauer lamented the misuse of &quot;humour&quot; (a German loanword from English) to mean any type of comedy. However, both &quot;humour&quot; and &quot;comic&quot; are often used when theorising about the subject. The connotations of &quot;humour&quot; as opposed to &quot;comic&quot; are said to be that of response versus stimulus. Additionally, &quot;humour&quot; was thought to include a combination of ridiculousness and wit in an individual; the paradigmatic case being Shakespeare&#x27;s Sir John Falstaff. The French were slow to adopt the term &quot;humour&quot;; in French, &quot;humeur&quot; and &quot;humour&quot; are still two different words, the former referring to a person&#x27;s mood or to the archaic concept of the four humours.

Non-satirical humour can be specifically termed &quot;droll humour&quot; or &quot;recreational drollery&quot;.

==Sociological factors==

As with any art form, the acceptance of a particular style or incidence of humour depends on sociological factors and varies from person to person. Throughout history, comedy has been used as a form of entertainment all over the world, whether in the courts of the Western kings or the villages of the Far East. Both a social etiquette and a certain intelligence can be displayed through forms of wit and sarcasm. Eighteenth-century German author Georg Lichtenberg said that &quot;the more you know humour, the more you become demanding in fineness.&quot;

===Ancient Greece===
Western humour theory begins with Plato, who attributed to Socrates (as a semi-historical dialogue character) in the &quot;Philebus&quot; (p. 49b) the view that the essence of the ridiculous is an ignorance in the weak, who are thus unable to retaliate when ridiculed. Later, in Greek philosophy, Aristotle, in the &quot;Poetics&quot; (1449a, pp. 34–35), suggested that an ugliness that does not disgust is fundamental to humour.

===India===
In ancient Sanskrit drama, Bharata Muni&#x27;s &quot;Natya Shastra&quot; defined humour (&quot;hāsyam&quot;) as one of the nine &quot;nava rasas&quot;, or principle &quot;rasas&quot; (emotional responses), which can be inspired in the audience by &quot;bhavas&quot;, the imitations of emotions that the actors perform. Each &quot;rasa&quot; was associated with a specific &quot;bhavas&quot; portrayed on stage.

===In Arabic and Persian culture===

The terms comedy and satire became synonymous after Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Poetics&quot; was translated into Arabic in the medieval Islamic world, where it was elaborated upon by Arabic writers and Islamic philosophers such as Abu Bischr, his pupil Al-Farabi, Persian Avicenna, and Averroes. Due to cultural differences, they disassociated comedy from Greek dramatic representation, and instead identified it with Arabic poetic themes and forms, such as &quot;hija&quot; (satirical poetry). They viewed comedy as simply the &quot;art of reprehension&quot; and made no reference to light and cheerful events or troublesome beginnings and happy endings associated with classical Greek comedy. After the Latin translations of the 12th century, the term &quot;comedy&quot; thus gained a new meaning in Medieval literature.

===Caribbean===
Mento star Lord Flea, stated in a 1957 interview that he thought that: &quot;West Indians have the best sense of humour in the world. Even in the most solemn song, like &quot;Las Kean Fine&quot; [&quot;Lost and Can Not Be Found&quot;], which tells of a boiler explosion on a sugar plantation that killed several of the workers, their natural wit and humour shine though.&quot;

===China===
Confucianist &amp; Neo-Confucian orthodoxy, with its emphasis on ritual and propriety, have traditionally looked down upon humour as subversive or unseemly. Humour was perceived as irony and sarcasm. The Confucian &quot;Analects&quot; itself, however, depicts the Master as fond of humorous self-deprecation, once comparing his wanderings to the existence of a homeless dog. Early Daoist philosophical texts such as &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; pointedly make fun of Confucian seriousness and make Confucius himself a slow-witted figure of fun. Joke books containing a mix of wordplay, puns, situational humour, and play with taboo subjects like sex and scatology, remained popular over the centuries. Local performing arts, storytelling, vernacular fiction, and poetry offer a wide variety of humorous styles and sensibilities.

Famous Chinese humourists include the ancient jesters Chunyu Kun and Dongfang Shuo; writers of the Ming and Qing dynasties such as Feng Menglong, Li Yu, and Wu Jingzi; and modern comic writers such as Lu Xun, Lin Yutang, Lao She, Qian Zhongshu, Wang Xiaobo, and Wang Shuo, and performers such as Ge You, Guo Degang, and Zhou Libo.

Modern Chinese humour has been heavily influenced not only by indigenous traditions, but also by foreign humour, circulated via print culture, cinema, television, and the internet. During the 1930s, Lin Yutang&#x27;s phono-semantic transliteration &quot;yōumò&quot; (; humour) caught on as a new term for humour, sparking a fad for humour literature, as well as impassioned debate about what type of humorous sensibility best suited China, a poor, weak country under partial foreign occupation. While some types of comedy were officially sanctioned during the rule of Mao Zedong, the Party-state&#x27;s approach towards humour was generally repressive. Social liberalisation in the 1980s, commercialisation of the cultural market in the 1990s, and the advent of the internet have each—despite an invasive state-sponsored censorship apparatus—enabled new forms of humour to flourish in China in recent decades.

=== Social transformation model ===
The social transformation model of humour predicts that specific characteristics, such as physical attractiveness, interact with humour. This model involves linkages between the humorist, an audience, and the subject matter of the humour. The two transformations associated with this particular model involves the subject matter of the humour, and the change in the audience&#x27;s perception of the humorous person, therefore establishing a relationship between the humorous speaker and the audience. The social transformation model views humour as adaptive because it communicates the present desire to be humorous as well as future intentions of being humorous. This model is used with deliberate self-deprecating humour where one is communicating with desires to be accepted into someone else&#x27;s specific social group. Although self-deprecating humour communicates weakness and fallibility in the bid to gain another&#x27;s affection, it can be concluded from the model that this type of humour can increase romantic attraction towards the humorist when other variables are also favourable.

=== Physical attractiveness ===
Humour is considered attractive for males in Western cultures. In the mid-20th century, a majority of American college students report that having a sense of humour is a crucial characteristic looked for in a romantic partner. In the late-20th century, British college students report humour and honesty as the two most important attributes in a significant other. Humour becomes more evident and significantly more important as the level of commitment in a romantic relationship increases. Recent research suggests expressions of humour in relation to physical attractiveness are two major factors in the desire for future interaction. Self-deprecating humour has been found to increase one&#x27;s desirability and physical attractiveness to others for committed relationships. Women regard physical attractiveness less highly compared to men when it came to dating, a serious relationship, and sexual intercourse. However, women rate humorous men more desirable than nonhumorous individuals for a serious relationship or marriage, but only when these men were physically attractive. 

While humorous people may be considered attractive, humorous people are also perceived by others to be less intellectual than nonhumorous people. When women were given the forced-choice design in the study, they chose funny men as potential relationship partners even though they rated them as being less honest and intelligent. Post-Hoc analysis showed no relationship between humour quality and favourable judgments.

For females, the results of a study conducted by McMaster University suggest humour can positively affect one&#x27;s desirability for a specific relationship partner, but this effect is only most likely to occur when men use humour and are evaluated by women. There is inconsistent evidence whether men prefer women with a sense of humour as partners, or women preferring other women with a sense of humour as potential partners. 

Outside of Western cultures, however, humour is not always valued as much in mate selection. Studies conducted in East Asia find humour ranked lower among other traits than in western cultures, especially by men evaluating women. In some studies of mate selection criteria, humour does not even make the list.

== Psychological well-being ==

It is generally known that humour contributes to higher subjective wellbeing (both physical and psychological). Previous research on humour and psychological well-being show that humour is in fact a major factor in achieving, and sustaining, higher psychological wellbeing. This hypothesis is known as general facilitative hypothesis for humour. That is, positive humour leads to positive health. Not all contemporary research, however, supports the previous assertion that humour is in fact a cause for healthier psychological wellbeing. Some of the previous researches&#x27; limitations is that they tend to use a unidimensional approach to humour because it was always inferred that humour was deemed positive. They did not consider other types of humour, or humour styles. For example, self-defeating or aggressive humour. Research has proposed 2 types of humour that each consist of 2 styles, making 4 styles in total. The two types are adaptive versus maladaptive humour. Adaptive humour consist of facilitative and self-enhancing humour, and maladaptive is self-defeating and aggressive humour. Each of these styles can have a different impact on psychological and individuals&#x27; overall subjective wellbeing.

# Affiliative style humour. Individuals with this dimension of humour tend to use jokes as a means of affiliating relationships, amusing others, and reducing tensions.
# Self-enhancing style humour. People that fall under this dimension of humour tend to take a humorous perspective of life. Individuals with self-enhancing humour tend to use it as a mechanism to cope with stress.
# Aggressive humour. Racist jokes, sarcasm and disparagement of individuals for the purpose of amusement. This type of humour is used by people who do not consider the consequences of their jokes, and mainly focus on the entertainment of the listeners.
# Self-defeating humour. People with this style of humour tend to amuse others by using self-disparaging jokes, and also tend to laugh along with others when being taunted. It is hypothesised that people attempt to use this style of humour as a means of social acceptance – which is often unsuccessful. It is also mentioned that these people may have an implicit feeling of negativity. So they use this humour as a means of hiding that inner negative feeling.

In the study on humour and psychological well-being, research has concluded that high levels of adaptive type humour (affiliative and self-enhancing) is associated with better self-esteem, positive affect, greater self-competency, as well as anxiety control and social interactions. All of which are constituents of psychological wellbeing. Additionally, adaptive humour styles may enable people to preserve their sense of wellbeing despite psychological problems. In contrast, maladaptive humour types (aggressive and self-defeating) are associated with poorer overall psychological wellbeing, emphasis on higher levels of anxiety and depression. Therefore, humour may have detrimental effects on psychological wellbeing, only if that humour is of negative characteristics.

== Physiological effects ==

Humour is often used to make light of difficult or stressful situations and to brighten up a social atmosphere in general. It is regarded by many as an enjoyable and positive experience, so it would be reasonable to assume that it might have some positive physiological effects on the body.

A study designed to test the positive physiological effects of humour, the relationship between being exposed to humour and pain tolerance in particular, was conducted in 1994 by Karen Zwyer, Barbara Velker, and Willibald Ruch. To test the effects of humour on pain tolerance the test subjects were first exposed to a short humorous video clip and then exposed to the cold pressor test. To identify the aspects of humour which might contribute to an increase in pain tolerance the study separated its fifty-six female participants into three groups, cheerfulness, exhilaration and humour production. The subjects were further separated into two groups, high Trait-Cheerfulness and high Trait-Seriousness according to the State-Trait-Cheerfulness-Inventory. The instructions for the three groups were as follows: the cheerfulness group were told to get excited about the movie without laughing or smiling, the exhilaration group was told to laugh and smile excessively, exaggerating their natural reactions, the humour production group was told to make humorous comments about the video clip as they watched. To ensure that the participants actually found the movie humorous and that it produced the desired effects the participants took a survey on the topic which resulted in a mean score of 3.64 out of 5. The results of the Cold Press Test showed that the participants in all three groups experienced a higher pain threshold and a higher pain tolerance than previous to the film. The results did not show a significant difference between the three groups.

There are also potential relationships between humour and having a healthy immune system. SIgA is a type of antibody that protects the body from infections. In a method similar to the previous experiment, the participants were shown a short humorous video clip and then tested for the effects. The participants showed a significant increase in SIgA levels.

There have been claims that laughter can be a supplement for cardiovascular exercise and might increase muscle tone. However an early study by Paskind J. showed that laughter can lead to a decrease in skeletal muscle tone because the short intense muscle contractions caused by laughter are followed by longer periods of muscle relaxation. The cardiovascular benefits of laughter also seem to be just a figment of imagination as a study that was designed to test oxygen saturation levels produced by laughter, showed that even though laughter creates sporadic episodes of deep breathing, oxygen saturation levels are not affected.

As humour is often used to ease tension, it might make sense that the same would be true for anxiety. A study by Yovetich N, Dale A, Hudak M. was designed to test the effects humour might have on relieving anxiety. The study subject were told that they would be given to an electric shock after a certain period of time. One group was exposed to humorous content, while the other was not. The anxiety levels were measured through self-report measures as well as the heart rate. Subjects which rated high on sense of humour reported less anxiety in both groups, while subjects which rated lower on sense of humour reported less anxiety in the group which was exposed to the humorous material. However, there was not a significant difference in the heart rate between the subjects.

== In the workplace ==

Humour is a ubiquitous, highly ingrained, and largely meaningful aspect of human experience and is therefore decidedly relevant in organisational contexts, such as the workplace.

The significant role that laughter and fun play in organisational life has been seen as a sociological phenomenon and has increasingly been recognised as also creating a sense of involvement and possible comradery among workers.
Sharing humour at work not only offers a relief from boredom, but can
also build relationships, improve camaraderie between colleagues and
create positive affect. Humour in the workplace may also relieve tension and can be used as a coping strategy.
In fact, one of the most agreed upon key impacts that workplace humour
has on people&#x27;s well-being, is the use of humour as a coping strategy to
aid in dealing with daily stresses, adversity or other difficult
situations.
Sharing a laugh with a few colleagues may improve moods, which is
pleasurable, and people perceive this as positively affecting their
ability to cope.
Fun and enjoyment are critical in people&#x27;s lives and the ability for
colleagues to be able to laugh during work, through banter or other,
promotes harmony and a sense of cohesiveness.

Humour may also be used to offset negative feelings about a
workplace task or to mitigate the use of profanity, or other coping
strategies, that may not be otherwise tolerated.
Not only can humour in the workplace assist with defusing negative
emotions, but it may also be used as an outlet to discuss personal
painful events, in a lighter context, thus ultimately reducing anxiety and allowing more happy, positive emotions to surface.
Additionally, humour may be used as a tool to mitigate the
authoritative tone by managers when giving directives to subordinates.
Managers may use self-deprecating humour as a way to be perceived as
more human and &quot;real&quot; by their employees.
The attachment to the notion of fun by contemporary companies has
resulted in workplace management coming to recognise the potentially
positive effects of &quot;workplay&quot; and realise that it does not necessarily
undermine workers&#x27; performance.

Laughter and play can unleash creativity, thus raising morale,
so in the interest of encouraging employee consent to the rigours of
the labour process, management often ignore, tolerate and even actively
encourage playful practices, with the purpose of furthering
organisational goals. Essentially, fun in the workplace is no longer being seen as frivolous.
The most current approach of managed fun and laughter in the workplace
originated in North America, where it has taken off to such a degree,
that it has humour consultants flourishing, as some states have
introduced an official &quot;fun at work&quot; day. The results have carried claims of well-being benefits to workers, improved customer experiences and an increase in productivity that organisations can enjoy, as a result. Others examined results of this movement while focusing around the science of happiness—concerned with mental health, motivation,
community building and national well-being—and drew attention to the
ability to achieve &quot;flow&quot; through playfulness and stimulate &quot;outside the
box&quot; thinking. Parallel to this movement is the &quot;positive&quot; scholarship that has emerged in psychology which seeks to empirically theorise the optimisation of human potential.
This happiness movement suggests that investing in fun at the
workplace, by allowing for laughter and play, will not only create enjoyment and a greater sense of well-being, but it will also enhance energy, performance and commitment in workers.

== At school ==
The use of humour plays an important role in youth development. Studies have shown that humour is especially important in social interactions with peers. School entry is the time when the importance of parents fades into the background and social interaction with peers becomes increasingly important. Conflict is inherent in these interactions. The use of humour plays an important role in conflict resolution and ultimately in school success and psychological adjustment. The use of humour that is socially acceptable leads to a lower likelihood of being a victim of bullying, whereas the use of self-disparaging humour leads to a higher likelihood of being bullied. When students are bullied, the use of self-disparaging humour can lead to an exacerbation of the negative effects on the student&#x27;s psychological adjustment to school.

== Studies ==
=== Laughter ===
One of the main focuses of modern psychological humour theory and research is to establish and clarify the correlation between humour and laughter. The major empirical findings here are that laughter and humour do not always have a one-to-one association. While most previous theories assumed the connection between the two almost to the point of them being synonymous, psychology has been able to scientifically and empirically investigate the supposed connection, its implications, and significance.

In 2009, Diana Szameitat conducted a study to examine the differentiation of emotions in laughter. They hired actors and told them to laugh with one of four different emotional associations by using auto-induction, where they would focus exclusively on the internal emotion and not on the expression of laughter itself. They found an overall recognition rate of 44%, with joy correctly classified at 44%, tickle 45%, schadenfreude 37%, and taunt 50%. Their second experiment tested the behavioural recognition of laughter during an induced emotional state and they found that different laughter types did differ with respect to emotional dimensions. In addition, the four emotional states displayed a full range of high and low sender arousal and valence. This study showed that laughter can be correlated with both positive (joy and tickle) and negative (schadenfreude and taunt) emotions with varying degrees of arousal in the subject.

This brings into question the definition of humour, then. If it is to be defined by the cognitive processes which display laughter, then humour itself can encompass a variety of negative as well as positive emotions. However, if humour is limited to positive emotions and things which cause positive affect, it must be delimited from laughter and their relationship should be further defined.

=== Health ===

Adaptive Humour use has shown to be effective for increasing resilience in dealing with distress and also effective in buffering against or undoing negative affects. In contrast, maladaptive humour use can magnify potential negative effects.

Madelijn Strick, Rob Holland, Rick van Baaren, and Ad van Knippenberg (2009) of Radboud University conducted a study that showed the distracting nature of a joke on bereaved individuals. Subjects were presented with a wide range of negative pictures and sentences. Their findings showed that humorous therapy attenuated the negative emotions elicited after negative pictures and sentences were presented. In addition, the humour therapy was more effective in reducing negative affect as the degree of affect increased in intensity. Humour was immediately effective in helping to deal with distress. The escapist nature of humour as a coping mechanism suggests that it is most useful in dealing with momentary stresses. Stronger negative stimuli requires a different therapeutic approach. 

Humour is an underlying character trait associated with the positive emotions used in the broaden-and-build theory of cognitive development.

Studies, such as those testing the undoing hypothesis, have shown several positive outcomes of humour as an underlying positive trait in amusement and playfulness. Several studies have shown that positive emotions can restore autonomic quiescence after negative affect. For example, Frederickson and Levinson showed that individuals who expressed Duchenne smiles during the negative arousal of a sad and troubling event recovered from the negative affect approximately 20% faster than individuals who did not smile.

Using humour judiciously can have a positive influence on cancer treatment. The effectiveness for humour‐based interventions in patients with schizophrenia is uncertain in a Cochrane review.

Humour can serve as a strong distancing mechanism in coping with adversity. In 1997, Kelter and Bonanno found that Duchenne laughter correlated with reduced awareness of distress. Positive emotion is able to loosen the grip of negative emotions on people&#x27;s thinking. A distancing of thought leads to a distancing of the unilateral responses people often have to negative arousal. In parallel with the distancing role plays in coping with distress, it supports the broaden and build theory that positive emotions lead to increased multilateral cognitive pathway and social resource building.

=== Ageing ===

Humour has been shown to improve and help the ageing process in three areas. The areas are improving physical health, improving social communications, and helping to achieve a sense of satisfaction in life.

Studies have shown that constant humour in the ageing process gives health benefits to individuals. Such benefits as higher self-esteem, lower levels of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress, and a more positive self-concept as well as other health benefits which have been recorded and acknowledged through various studies. Even patients with specific diseases have shown improvement with ageing using humour. Overall there is a strong correlation through constant humour in ageing and better health in the individuals.

Another way that research indicates that humour helps with the ageing process, is through helping the individual to create and maintain strong social relationship during transitory periods in their lives. One such example is when people are moved into nursing homes or other facilities of care. With this transition certain social interactions with friend and family may be limited forcing the individual to look elsewhere for these social interactions. Humour has been shown to make transitions easier, as humour is shown reduce stress and facilitate socialisation and serves as a social bonding function. Humour may also help the transition in helping the individual to maintain positive feelings towards those who are enforcing the changes in their lives. These new social interactions can be critical for these transitions in their lives and humour will help these new social interactions to take place making these transitions easier.

Humour can also help ageing individuals maintain a sense of satisfaction in their lives. Through the ageing process many changes will occur, such as losing the right to drive a car. This can cause a decrease in satisfaction in the lives of the individual. Humour helps to alleviate this decrease of satisfaction by allowing the humour to release stress and anxiety caused by changes in the individuals life. Laughing and humour can be a substitute for the decrease in satisfaction by allowing individuals to feel better about their situations by alleviating the stress. This, in turn, can help them to maintain a sense of satisfaction towards their new and changing life style.

=== Physiology ===

In an article published in &quot;Nature Reviews Neuroscience&quot;, it is reported that a study&#x27;s results indicate that humour is rooted in the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex. The study states, in part:&quot;Humour seems to engage a core network of cortical and subcortical structures, including temporo-occipito-parietal areas involved in detecting and resolving incongruity (mismatch between expected and presented stimuli); and the mesocorticolimbic dopaminergic system and the amygdala, key structures for reward and salience processing.&quot;

==Formula==

Humour can be verbal, visual, or physical. Non-verbal forms of communication–for example, music or visual art–can also be humorous.

===Root components===
* Being reflective of or imitative of reality
* Surprise/misdirection, contradiction/paradox, ambiguity.

===Methods===
* Farce
* Hyperbole
* Metaphor
* Pun
* Reframing
* Self-deprecation
* Timing

===Behaviour, place and size===

Rowan Atkinson explains in his lecture in the documentary &quot;Funny Business&quot; that an object or a person can become funny in three ways:
* by behaving in an unusual way,
* by being in an unusual place,
* by being the wrong size.

Most sight gags fit into one or more of these categories.

===Exaggeration===
Some theoreticians of the comic consider exaggeration to be a universal comic device. It may take different forms in different genres, but all rely on the fact that the easiest way to make things laughable is to exaggerate to the point of absurdity their salient traits,

== Taxonomy ==
There are many taxonomies of humour; the following is used to classify humorous tweets in (Rayz 2012).
# Anecdotes
# Fantasy
# Insult
# Irony
# Jokes
# Observational
# Quote
# Role play
# Self-deprecation
# Vulgarity
# Word play
# Other

==Culture==

Different cultures have different typical expectations of humour so comedy shows are not always successful when transplanted into another culture. For example, a 2004 BBC News article discusses a stereotype among British comedians that Americans and Germans do not understand irony, and therefore UK sitcoms are not appreciated by them.

<doc id="38410" wikidata="Q7675376" url="?curid=38410" title="Group sex">
<text>Group sex is sexual activity involving more than two people. Participants in group sex can be of any sexual orientation or gender. Any form of sexual activity can be adopted to involve more than two participants, but some forms have their own names.

Group sex most commonly takes place in a private sex party or semi-public swinger gathering, but may also take place at massage parlors or brothels or, in some jurisdictions, at purpose-built locations such as sex clubs. In places where non-monogamous sex is taboo or illegal, group sex may take place in private or clandestine locations including homes, hotel rooms, or private clubs.

Fantasies of group sex are extremely common among both men and women. Many forms of sexual behavior were reported by Kinsey&#x27;s subjects, but the official Kinsey Reports website does not mention threesomes or group sex in the summary of Kinsey&#x27;s findings.

Group sex is a popular subgenre in pornographic films.

==Terms==

In principle, any sexual behavior performed by more than two people can be referred to as group sex, but various terms are used to describe particular acts or combinations of people. Many swingers argue that non-swingers have conflated the terms because of lack of understanding and that there are distinct differences among the terms with specific meanings as to number, intent, sexual orientation, and familiarity of the persons involved.

*Circle jerk: Group masturbation among men, usually sitting in somewhat of a circle formation.
*Daisy chain: Group of participants perform cunnilingus or fellatio on each other in a circular formation, permitting each participant to both give and receive oral sex simultaneously.
*Gang bang: A number of people performing sex acts on one person, either in turn or at the same time. Sexual intercourse involving multiple women in which one man is the central focus is called reverse gang bang.
*Threesome or three-way: Three people all having sexual relations, not necessarily simultaneously. Not to be confused with ménage à trois (literally, &quot;household of three&quot;).
*Foursome or four-way: Sex between four people. Not to be confused with ménage à quatre (literally, &quot;household of four&quot;).
*Double penetration: When a person is entered or penetrated in the vagina and/or anus by two people at the same time. This is usually when one person enters the anus while another enters the vagina; however, it also refers to two simultaneous penetrations in the same orifice.
*Monogamous group sex or same room sex (a.k.a. soft swapping): Couples engaging in sexual activity in the same room but in separate pairs, without any swapping of partners or other major sexual activity between couples.
*Spintrian: A term used by Suetonius to describe sexual group practices indulged in by the emperor Tiberius on Capri.

==Types of sex party==
A sex party is a gathering at which sexual activity takes place. Sex parties may be organized to enable people to engage in casual sexual activity or people interested in group sex to meet, but any gathering where sexual activity is anticipated can be called a sex party.

There are a number of types of sex parties:

=== Orgy ===
An orgy is a gathering where guests freely engage in open and unrestrained sexual activity or group sex; and a bunga bunga orgy is an orgy in which participants have sex underwater, such as in a swimming pool or a hot tub.

===Swinger party===
A swinger party or partner-swapping party is a gathering at which individuals or couples in a committed relationship can engage in sexual activities with others as a recreational or social activity.

Swinger parties may involve various group sex activities. Partners can engage in penetrative sex, known as &quot;full swap&quot;, or choose to &quot;soft swap&quot; in which they engage only in non-penetrative sex. New swinging couples often choose a soft swap before they are comfortable with a full swap, although many couples stay soft swap for personal reasons. &quot;Soft swinging&quot; is when a couple engages in sexual activities with only each other while other couples perform sex acts in the immediate vicinity. Technically this is a form of exhibitionism rather than &quot;group sex&quot; per se.

==Health==
As with all sexual activity, the relative risks of group sex depend on the specific activities engaged in, although having a large number of sexual partners increases one&#x27;s risk of exposure to sexually transmitted infections (STIs).

From the mid-1980s there was active lobbying against gay bathhouses, blaming them for the spread of STIs, in particular HIV, and this forced closures in some jurisdictions, particularly in the United States. Sociologist Stephen O. Murray writes that, &quot;there was never any evidence presented that going to bathhouses was a risk-factor for contracting AIDS.&quot; This statement ignored the fact that few studies had been done. Later studies have confirmed a higher risk off STI from bathhouses. In other countries, fears about the spread of STIs have prompted the closing of bathhouses—with their private rooms—in favour of sex clubs, in which all sexual activity takes place in the open, and can be observed by monitors whose job it is to enforce safer sex practices.

Proponents claim that venues where group sex takes place often provide condoms, dental dams, latex gloves, lubricants and other items for safer sex, although they cannot prove that those items are used and use is typically not mandated. Bathhouses in particular are a major source of safer sex information—they provide pamphlets and post safer sex posters prominently (often on the walls of each room as well as in the common areas), provide free condoms and lubricants, and often require patrons to affirm that they will only have safer sex on the premises.

==Prevalence==
In a 2015 US survey, a significantly larger percentage of men than women responded that they had any lifetime experience of a threesome (17.8 vs 10.3) or group sex (11.5 vs 6.3).

==Law==
The Sexual Offences Act 1967 decriminalized homosexual acts between two men over 21 years of age &quot;in private&quot; in England and Wales; however, the privacy restrictions of the Act meant a third person could not participate in the sex or even be present, as well as that the two men could not have sex in a hotel. These restrictions were overturned in the European Court of Human Rights in 2000.

Section 20A of the Immorality Act, 1957, commonly known as the &quot;men at a party&quot; clause, was a South African law that criminalized all sexual acts between men that occurred in the presence of a third person. The section was enacted by the Immorality Amendment Act, 1969 and remained in force until it was found to be unconstitutional in 1998 by the Constitutional Court in the case of &quot;National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Justice&quot;.

A 1996 sexual harassment case filed against Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing of America by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) highlighted corporate involvement by Mitsubishi in sex parties arranged by managers and other employees.
Group sex is illegal in China, due to Article 301 of China&#x27;s 1997 Criminal Law which bans “group licentiousness”.

In Canada, in a 2002 decision regarding a case in which three people were engaged in sexual intercourse, the Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench of Alberta declared section 159 of the &quot;Criminal Code&quot; in its entirety to be null, including the provisions criminalizing anal sex when more than two persons are taking part or present. In June 2019, C-75 passed both houses of the Parliament of Canada and received royal assent, repealing section 159 effective immediately.

==Media portrayals==
Sex parties, under various names, have been a common focus of moral panics fed by media reports claiming that such parties are prevalent, or growing in prevalence, especially among teenagers.

Sensational media reports about the prevalence of sex parties, especially among young people, appear with some regularity. In the early 1950s, for example, it was alleged that teenage girls, mainly throughout the Southern and Midwestern United States were forming &quot;non-virgin clubs&quot;, in which they organized and held sex orgies with reports of couples being paired off by drawing numbers from a hat. These claims were investigated and debunked.

Several stories of this type arose in the US in 2003. In New York, rumors began that teens had been taking days off from school to attend &quot;hooky parties&quot; while their parents were at work. One school even suspended a group of girls for allegedly skipping school to attend such a party, refusing to let them return to school until each had submitted to a medical examination for sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy, and school officials were allowed to examine the results. The New York Civil Liberties Union filed a federal lawsuit against the school on behalf of the girls and won a settlement which included monetary damages and a change in the school district&#x27;s policy.

A rainbow party is a baseless urban legend spread from the early 2000s. At these events, females wearing various shades of lipstick reportedly took turns fellating males in sequence, leaving multiple colours on their penises, ignoring the fact that in such a situation the colors would blend. Rainbow parties were covered on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; in 2003, and became the subject of a juvenile novel called &quot;Rainbow Party&quot;. On May 27, 2010, the television program &quot;The Doctors&quot; discussed the topic with dozens of teens, parents, and professionals. However, sex researchers and adolescent health care professionals have found no evidence for the existence of rainbow parties, and as such attribute the spread of the stories to a moral panic.

Similar stories concerning teenagers using gel bracelets as coupons or signals for sex also arose at the time, with a similar lack of corroborating evidence.

<text>Regression testing (rarely, &quot;non-regression testing&quot;) is re-running functional and non-functional tests to ensure that previously developed and tested software still performs as expected after a change. If not, that would be called a &quot;regression&quot;.

Changes that may require regression testing include bug fixes, software enhancements, configuration changes, and even substitution of electronic components (hardware). As regression test suites tend to grow with each found defect, test automation is frequently involved. The evident exception is the GUIs regression testing, which normally must be executed manually. Sometimes a change impact analysis is performed to determine an appropriate subset of tests (&quot;non-regression analysis&quot;).

==Background==
As software is updated or changed, or reused on a modified target, emergence of new faults and/or re-emergence of old faults is quite common.

Sometimes re-emergence occurs because a fix gets lost through poor revision control practices (or simple human error in revision control). Often, a fix for a problem will be &quot;fragile&quot; in that it fixes the problem in the narrow case where it was first observed but not in more general cases which may arise over the lifetime of the software. Frequently, a fix for a problem in one area inadvertently causes a software bug in another area.

It may happen that when a feature is redesigned some of the same mistakes that were made in the original implementation of the feature also occur in the redesign. In most software development situations, it is considered good coding practice, when a bug is located and fixed, to record a test that exposes the bug and re-run that test regularly after subsequent changes to the program.

Although this may be done through manual testing procedures using programming techniques, it is often done using automated testing tools. Such a test suite contains software tools that allow the testing environment to execute all the regression test cases automatically; many projects have automated Continuous integration systems to re-run all regression tests at specified intervals and report any failures (which could imply a regression or an out-of-date test).

Common strategies are to run such a system after every successful compile (for small projects), every night, or once a week. Those strategies can be automated by an external tool.

Regression testing is an integral part of the extreme programming software development method. In this method, design documents are replaced by extensive, repeatable, and automated testing of the entire software package throughout each stage of the software development process. Regression testing is done after functional testing has concluded, to verify that the other functionalities are working.

In the corporate world, regression testing has traditionally been performed by a software quality assurance team after the development team has completed work. However, defects found at this stage are the most costly to fix. This problem is being addressed by the rise of unit testing. Although developers have always written test cases as part of the development cycle, these test cases have generally been either functional tests or unit tests that verify only intended outcomes. Developer testing compels a developer to focus on unit testing and to include both positive and negative test cases.

== Techniques ==
The various regression testing techniques are:

=== Retest all ===
This technique checks all the test cases on the current program to check its integrity. Though it is expensive as it needs to re-run all the cases, it ensures that there are no errors because of the modified code.

=== Regression test selection ===
Unlike Retest all, this technique runs a part of the test suite (owing to the cost of retest all) if the cost of selecting the part of the test suite is less than the Retest all technique.

=== Test case prioritization ===
Prioritize the test cases so as to increase a test suite&#x27;s rate of fault detection. Test case prioritization techniques schedule test cases so that the test cases that are higher in priority are executed before the test cases that have a lower priority.

==== Types of test case prioritization ====
* General prioritization – Prioritize test cases that will be beneficial on subsequent versions
* Version-specific prioritization – Prioritize test cases with respect to a particular version of the software.

=== Hybrid ===
This technique is a hybrid of regression test selection and test case prioritization.

== Benefits and drawbacks ==
Regression testing is performed when changes are made to the existing functionality of the software or if there is a bug fix in the software. Regression testing can be achieved through multiple approaches; if a &quot;test all&quot; approach is followed, it provides certainty that the changes made to the software have not affected the existing functionalities, which are unaltered.

In agile software development—where the software development life cycles are very short, resources are scarce, and changes to the software are very frequent—regression testing might introduce a lot of unnecessary overhead.

In a software development environment which tends to use black box components from a third party, performing regression testing can be tricky, as any change in the third-party component may interfere with the rest of the system (and performing regression testing on a third-party component is difficult, because it is an unknown entity).

==Uses==
Regression testing can be used not only for testing the &quot;correctness&quot; of a program but often also for tracking the quality of its output. For instance, in the design of a compiler, regression testing could track the code size and the time it takes to compile and execute the test suite cases.

Regression tests can be broadly categorized as functional tests or unit tests. Functional tests exercise the complete program with various inputs. Unit tests exercise individual functions, subroutines, or object methods. Both functional testing tools and unit-testing tools tend to be automated and are often third-party products that are not part of the compiler suite. A functional test may be a scripted series of program inputs, possibly even involving an automated mechanism for controlling mouse movements and clicks. A unit test may be a set of separate functions within the code itself or a driver layer that links to the code without altering the code being tested.

<text>Hesse or Hessen ( ), officially the State of Hesse (), is a state in Germany. Its capital city is Wiesbaden, and the largest urban area is Frankfurt, which is also the country&#x27;s principal financial centre. Two other major historic cities are Darmstadt and Kassel. With an area of 21,114.73 square kilometers and a population of over six million, it ranks seventh and fifth, respectively, among the sixteen German states. Frankfurt Rhine-Main, Germany&#x27;s second-largest metropolitan area (after Rhine-Ruhr), is mainly located in Hesse.

As a cultural region, Hesse also includes the area known as Rhenish Hesse (Rheinhessen) in the neighboring state of Rhineland-Palatinate.

== Etymology ==
The German name , like the names of other German regions ( &quot;Swabia&quot;, &quot;Franconia&quot;, &quot;Bavaria&quot;, &quot;Saxony&quot;), derives from the dative plural form of the name of the inhabitants or eponymous tribe, the Hessians (, singular ). The geographical name represents a short equivalent of the older compound name (&quot;land of the Hessians&quot;). The Old High German form of the name is recorded as (dative plural of ); in Middle Latin it appears as , , . The name of the Hessians ultimately continues the tribal name of the &quot;Chatti&quot;. The ancient name &quot;Chatti&quot; by the 7th century is recorded as &quot;Chassi&quot;, and from the 8th century as &quot;Hassi&quot; or &quot;Hessi&quot;.

An inhabitant of Hesse is called a &quot;Hessian&quot; (German: (masculine), plural , or (feminine), plural ). The American English term &quot;Hessian&quot; for 18th-century British auxiliary troops originates with Landgrave Frederick II of Hesse-Kassel hiring out regular army units to the government of Great Britain to fight in the American Revolutionary War.

The English form &quot;Hesse&quot; was in common use by the 18th century, first in the hyphenated names of the states of &quot;Hesse-Cassel&quot; and &quot;Hesse-Darmstadt&quot;, but the latinate form &quot;Hessia&quot; remained in common English usage well into the 19th century.

The European Commission uses the German form , even in English-language contexts, due to the policy of leaving regional names untranslated.

The synthetic element hassium, number 108 on the periodic table, was named after the state of Hesse in 1997, following a proposal of 1992.

== History ==

The territory of Hesse was delineated only in 1945, as Greater Hesse, under American occupation. It corresponds loosely to the medieval Landgraviate of Hesse.
In the 19th century, prior to the unification of Germany, the territory of what is now Hesse comprised the territories of Grand Duchy of Hesse (also known as Hesse-Darmstadt), the Duchy of Nassau, the free city of Frankfurt, the Electorate of Hesse (also known as Hesse-Kassel), the Principality of Waldeck and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Homburg.

=== Early history ===

The Central Hessian region was inhabited in the Upper Paleolithic. Finds of tools in southern Hesse in Rüsselsheim suggest the presence of Pleistocene hunters about 13,000 years ago. A fossil hominid skull that was found in northern Hesse, just outside the village of Rhünda, has been dated at 12,000 years ago. The Züschen tomb (German: Steinkammergrab von Züschen, sometimes also Lohne-Züschen) is a prehistoric burial monument, located between Lohne and Züschen, near Fritzlar, Hesse, Germany. Classified as a gallery grave or a Hessian-Westphalian stone cist (&quot;hessisch-westfälische Steinkiste&quot;), it is one of the most important megalithic monuments in Central Europe. Dating to , it belongs to the Late Neolithic Wartberg culture.

An early Celtic presence in what is now Hesse is indicated by a mid-5th-century BC La Tène-style burial uncovered at Glauberg. The region was later settled by the Germanic Chatti tribe around the 1st century BC, and the name &quot;Hesse&quot; is a continuation of that tribal name.

The ancient Romans had a military camp in Dorlar, and in Waldgirmes directly on the eastern outskirts of Wetzlar was a civil settlement under construction. Presumably, the provincial government for the occupied territories of the right bank of Germania was planned at this location. The governor of Germania, at least temporarily, likely had resided here. The settlement appears to have been abandoned by the Romans after the devastating Battle of the Teutoburg Forest failed in the year AD 9. The Chatti were also involved in the Revolt of the Batavi in AD 69.

Hessia, from the early 7th century on, served as a buffer between areas dominated by the Saxons (to the north) and the Franks, who brought the area to the south under their control in the early sixth century and occupied Thuringia (to the east) in 531. Hessia occupies the northwestern part of the modern German state of Hesse; its borders were not clearly delineated. Its geographic center is Fritzlar; it extends in the southeast to Hersfeld on the river Fulda, in the north to past Kassel and up to the rivers Diemel and Weser. To the west, it occupies the valleys of the rivers Eder and Lahn (the latter until it turns south). It measured roughly 90 kilometers north–south, and 80 north-west.

The area around Fritzlar shows evidence of significant pagan belief from the 1st century on. Geismar was a particular focus of such activity; it was continuously occupied from the Roman period on, with a settlement from the Roman period, which itself had a predecessor from the 5th century BC. Excavations have produced a horse burial and bronze artifacts. A possible religious cult may have centered on a natural spring in Geismar, called &quot;Heilgenbron&quot;; the name &quot;Geismar&quot; (possibly &quot;energetic pool&quot;) itself may be derived from that spring. The village of , now a part of Gudensberg near Fritzlar and less than ten miles from Geismar, was likely an ancient religious center; the basaltic outcrop of Gudensberg is named after Wodan, and a two-meter tall quartzite megalith called the &quot;Wotanstein&quot; is at the center of the village.

By the mid-7th century, the Franks had established themselves as overlords, which is suggested by archeological evidence of burials, and they built fortifications in various places, including Christenberg. By 690, they took direct control over Hessia, apparently to counteract expansion by the Saxons, who built fortifications in Gaulskopf and Eresburg across the river Diemel, the northern boundary of Hessia. The Büraburg (which already had a Frankish settlement in the sixth century) was one of the places the Franks fortified to resist the Saxon pressure, and according to John-Henry Clay, the Büraburg was &quot;probably the largest man-made construction seen in Hessia for at least seven hundred years&quot;. Walls and trenches totaling one kilometer in length were made, and they enclosed &quot;8 hectares of a spur that offered a commanding view over Fritzlar and the densely-populated heart of Hessia&quot;.

Following Saxon incursions into Chattish territory in the 7th century, two &quot;gaue&quot; had been established; a Frankish one, comprising an area around Fritzlar and Kassel, and a Saxonian one. In the 9th century, the Saxon Hessengau also came under the rule of the Franconians.

=== Holy Roman Empire ===

From 962 the land which would become Hesse was part of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 10th and 11th centuries it was mostly encompassed by the Western or Rhenish part of the stem duchy of Franconia.

In the 12th century, Hessengau passed to the Landgraviate of Thuringia. As a result of the War of the Thuringian Succession (1247–1264) the former Thuringian lands were partitioned between the Wettin Margraviate of Meissen, which gained Thuringia proper, and the new Landgraviate of Hesse, which remained with the Ludovingians. From that point on the Ludovingian coat of arms came to represent both Thuringia and Hesse.

It rose to prominence under Landgrave Philip the Magnanimous, who was one of the leaders of German Protestantism. After Philip&#x27;s death in 1567, the territory was divided among his four sons from his first marriage (Philip was a bigamist) into four lines: Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), Hesse-Darmstadt, Hesse-Rheinfels, and the also previously existing Hesse-Marburg. As the latter two lines died out quite quickly (1583 and 1605, respectively), Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt were the two core states within the Hessian lands. Several collateral lines split off during the centuries, such as in 1622, when Hesse-Homburg split off from Hesse-Darmstadt, and in 1760 when Hesse-Hanau split off from Hesse-Kassel. In the late 16th century, Kassel adopted Calvinism, while Darmstadt remained Lutheran and consequently the two lines often found themselves on opposing sides of conflicts, most notably in the disputes over Hesse-Marburg and in the Thirty Years&#x27; War, when Darmstadt fought on the side of the Emperor, while Kassel sided with Sweden and France.
The Landgrave Frederick II (1720–1785) ruled Hesse-Kassel as a benevolent despot, from 1760 to 1785. He combined Enlightenment ideas with Christian values, cameralist plans for central control of the economy, and a militaristic approach toward diplomacy. He funded the depleted treasury of the poor government by loaning 19,000 soldiers in complete military formations to Great Britain to fight in North America during the American Revolutionary War, 1776–1783. These soldiers, commonly known as Hessians, fought under the British flag. The British used the Hessians in several conflicts, including in the Irish Rebellion of 1798. For further revenue, the soldiers were loaned to other places as well. Most were conscripted, with their pay going to the Landgrave.

=== Modern history ===

==== French Revolution and Napoleonic Wars ====
In 1789 the French Revolution began and in 1794, during the War of the First Coalition, the French Republic occupied the Left Bank of the Rhine, including part of Lower Katzenelnbogen (, Hesse-Kassel&#x27;s part of the former County of Katzenelnbogen which was held by the appanage Hesse-Rotenburg). Emperor Francis II formally recognised the annexation of the Left Bank in the 1801 Treaty of Lunéville. This led in 1803 to the , a substantial reorganisation (mediatisation) of the states and territories of the Empire. Several exclaves of Mainz were mediatised to Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Darmstadt, and Hesse-Darmstadt also gained the Duchy of Westphalia from Cologne, the parts of Worms on the right-bank of the Rhine, and the former Free City of Friedberg. Nassau-Weilburg gained the right-bank territories of Trier among other territories. Orange-Nassau gained the Prince-Bishopric of Fulda (as the Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda). The Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel was also elevated to the status of Prince-Elector (), with his state thereby becoming the Electorate of Hesse or Electoral Hesse (, being the German-language term for the Empire&#x27;s College of Electors).

In July 1806 Hesse-Darmstadt, Nassau-Weilburg, Nassau-Usingen, and the newly merged Principality of Isenburg became founding members of Napoleon&#x27;s Confederation of the Rhine. Hesse-Darmstadt expanded further in the resulting mediatisation, absorbing numerous small states (including Hesse-Homburg and much of the territory of the Houses of , and Sayn-Wittgenstein). It was also elevated by Napoleon to the status of Grand Duchy, becoming the Grand Duchy of Hesse. Orange-Nassau, which refused to join the Confederation, lost Siegen, Dillenburg, Hadamar and Beilstein to Berg and Fulda to the Prince-Primate of the Confederation (and former Elector of Mainz) Karl Theodor von Dalberg; the remainder of its territory was merged with that of Nassau-Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg in August 1806 to form the Duchy of Nassau. Waldeck also joined the Confederation in 1807.

The Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in August 1806, rendering Hesse-Kassel&#x27;s electoral privilege meaningless. Hesse-Kassel was occupied by the French in October 1806 and the remainder of Lower Katzenelnbogen was annexed to the French Empire as . The rest of its territory was annexed to the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807; Hesse-Hanau (a secundogeniture of Hesse-Kassel) was annexed to the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt in 1810 along with the other territories held by the Prince-primate: Frankfurt, Fulda, Aschaffenburg and Wetzlar.

As a result of the German campaign of 1813 the Kingdom of Westphalia and the Grand Duchy of Frankfurt were dissolved and Hesse-Kassel and Hesse-Hanau were restored; Orange-Nassau was also restored in its territories previously lost to Berg.

As a result of the 1815 Congress of Vienna Hesse-Kassel gained Fulda (roughly the western third of the former Prince-Bishopric, the rest of which went to Bavaria and Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach) from Frankfurt and part of Isenburg, while several of its small northern exclaves were absorbed into Hanover, some small eastern areas were ceded to Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach and Lower Katzenelnbogen was ceded to Nassau. Hesse-Darmstadt lost the Duchy of Westphalia and the Sayn-Wittgensteiner lands to the Prussian Province of Westphalia but gained territory on the left bank of the Rhine centred on Mainz, which became known as Rhenish Hesse (), and the remainder of Isenburg. Orange-Nassau, whose ruler was now also King William I of the Netherlands and Grand Duke of Luxembourg, was ceded to Prussia but most of its territory aside from Siegen was then ceded on to Nassau. Hesse-Homburg and the Free City of Frankfurt were also restored.

While the other former Electors had gained other titles, becoming either Kings or Grand Dukes, the Elector of Hesse-Kassel alone retained the anachronistic title of Prince-Elector; a request to be recognised as &quot;King of the Chatti&quot; () was rejected by the Congress.

Following mediation, the Congress of Vienna had significantly fewer states remained in the region that is now Hesse: the Hessian states, Nassau, Waldeck and Frankfurt. The Kingdoms of Prussia and Bavaria also held some territory in the region. The Congress established the German Confederation, of which they all became members. Hesse-Hanau was (re-)absorbed into Hesse-Kassel in 1821.

==== German Empire ====

In the 1866 Austro-Prussian War the states of the region allied with Austria were defeated during the Campaign of the Main. Following Prussia&#x27;s victory and dissolution of the German Confederation, Prussia annexed Electoral Hesse, Frankfurt, Hesse-Homburg, Nassau and small parts of Bavaria and the Grand Duchy of Hesse, which were then combined into the Province of Hesse-Nassau. The name survived, denoting the region around Kassel. The Grand Duchy of Hesse retained its autonomy in defeat because a greater part of the country was situated south of the river Main and it was feared that Prussian expansion beyond the Main might provoke France. However, Upper Hesse (: the parts of Hesse-Darmstadt north of the Main around the town of Gießen) was incorporated into the North German Confederation (), a tight federation of German states established by Prussia in 1867, while also remaining part of the Grand Duchy. In 1871, after France&#x27;s defeat in the Franco-Prussian War, the whole of the Grand Duchy joined the German Empire.

Around the turn of the 20th century, Darmstadt was one of the centres of the Jugendstil. Until 1907, the Grand Duchy of Hesse used the Hessian red and white lion &quot;barry&quot; as its coat-of-arms.

==== Weimar and Nazi periods ====
The revolution of 1918 following the German defeat in WWI transformed Hesse-Darmstadt from a monarchy to a republic, which officially renamed itself the People&#x27;s State of Hesse (). The state parliament, or &quot;Landtag&quot; consisted of 70 deputies elected on the basis of proportional representation. There were six Landtag elections between 1919 and 1932. Following the Nazi seizure of power in Berlin, the &quot;Landtag&quot; was formally abolished as a result of the &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot; of 30 January 1934, which replaced the German federal system with a unitary state.

The parts of Hesse-Darmstadt on the left bank of the Rhine (Rhenish Hesse), as well as those right-bank areas of Hesse-Darmstadt and Hesse-Nassau within of Koblenz or Mainz were occupied by French troops until 1930 under the terms of the Versailles peace treaty that officially ended World War I in 1919. The Kingdom of Prussia became the Free State of Prussia, of which Hesse-Nassau remained a province.

In 1929 the Free State of Waldeck was dissolved and incorporated into Hesse-Nassau. In 1932 Wetzlar (), formerly an exclave of the Prussian Rhine Province situated between Hesse-Nassau and the Grand Duchy&#x27;s Upper Hesse, was transferred to Hesse-Nassau. The former Hessian exclave of Rinteln (, the Hessian part of the former County of Schaumburg) was also detached and transferred to the Province of Hanover.

On 1 July 1944 the Prussian Province of Hesse-Nassau was formally divided into the provinces of Kurhessen and Nassau. At the same time the former Hessian Schmalkalden exclaves (), together with the of the Province of Saxony, were transferred to Thuringia. The territories of the new provinces did not directly correspond with their pre-1866 namesakes but rather with the associated NSDAP : Gau Electoral Hesse and Gau Hesse-Nassau (excluding the areas which were part of the People&#x27;s State of Hesse).

==== Post-World War II ====
After World War II, the Hessian territory west of the Rhine was again occupied by France, while the rest of the region was part of the US occupation zone. On 17 September 1945 the Wanfried agreement adjusted the border between American-occupied Kurhessen and Soviet-occupied Thuringia. The United States proclaimed the state of Greater Hesse () on 19 September 1945, out of the People&#x27;s State of Hesse and most of what had been the Prussian Provinces of Kurhessen and Nassau. The French incorporated their parts of Hesse (Rhenish Hesse) and Nassau (as ) into the newly founded state of Rhineland-Palatinate () on 30 August 1946.

On 4 December 1946, Greater Hesse was officially renamed .
Hesse in the 1940s received more than a million displaced ethnic Germans.

Due to its proximity to the Inner German border, Hesse became an important location of NATO installations in the 1950s, especially military bases of the US V Corps and United States Army Europe.

The first elected minister president of Hesse was Christian Stock, followed by Georg-August Zinn (both Social Democrats). The German Social Democrats gained an absolute majority in 1962 and pursued progressive policies with the so-called . The CDU gained a relative majority in the 1974 elections, but the Social Democrats continued to govern in a coalition with the FDP. Hesse was first governed by the CDU under Walter Wallmann during 1987–1991, replaced by a SPD-Greens coalition under Hans Eichel during 1991–1999. From 1999, Hesse was governed by the CDU under Roland Koch (retired 2010) and Volker Bouffier (incumbent as of 2020).
Frankfurt during the 1960s to 1990s developed into one of the major cities of West Germany. As of 2016, 12% of the total population of Hesse lived in the city of Frankfurt.

== Geography ==

The only state to straddle west and central portions of Germany where the eight ordinal directions (compass points) and the centre is considered, Hesse borders six other states. These are, from north, clockwise: Lower Saxony, Thuringia, Bavaria, Baden-Württemberg, Rhineland-Palatinate, and North Rhine-Westphalia.

The most populous towns and cities of Hesse are in the southwest, the Frankfurt Rhein-Main Region namely Frankfurt am Main, Wiesbaden, Darmstadt, Offenbach, Hanau, Giessen, Wetzlar, and Rüsselsheim am Main. Outside, but very near the south-west corner of Hesse are four populous, highly technologised, places: Worms, Ludwigshafen, Mannheim, and Heidelberg.

Other large Hessian towns are Fulda in the east, Kassel and Marburg an der Lahn in the north and Limburg an der Lahn in the west. All of the &quot;on the river&quot; suffixes are locally and, informally far beyond, omitted of these cities. The plain between the rivers Main, Rhine, and lower Neckar, and the Odenwald ridge of low mountains or very high hills is called the Ried which continues to north, across the Main, as the Wetterau. Both plains which are quite densely populated also have a substantial built environment such as the country&#x27;s largest airport, contrasting with the more forested, hillier middle and northern thirds of Hesse.

The longest rivers in Hesse are the Eder and moreover its distributary the Fulda draining most of the north, the Lahn in the centre-west and, as to those navigable by large vessels, the Main and very broad Rhine in the south. The countryside is hilly and the topographical map, inset, names 14 short, low to medium-height mountain ranges including the Rhön, the Westerwald, the Taunus, the Vogelsberg, the Knüll and the Spessart. The notable range forming the southern taper of Hesse (shared with a narrowing of the Ried, the Rhine&#x27;s eastern plain) and briefly spanning the middle Neckar valley which begins directly east of Heidelberg (thus also in Baden-Württemberg) is the Odenwald. Forming a mid-eastern tiny projection into mostly Thuringia is the uppermost part of the Ulster, commanding the west valley side of which is the Hessian highest point, Wasserkuppe at 950m above sea level – in the Rhön.

The Rhine forms the long southwest border of Hesse. Two notables oxbow lakes, the Stockstadt-Erfelder Altrhein and Lampertheimer Altrhein are in the south-west fringe.

Hesse, 42% forest, is by that measure the greenest state in Germany.

== Administration ==
Hesse is a unitary state governed directly by the Hessian government in the capital city Wiesbaden, partially through regional vicarious authorities called &quot;Regierungspräsidien&quot;. Municipal parliaments are, however, elected independently from the state government by the Hessian people. Local municipalities enjoy a considerable degree of home rule.

=== Districts ===

The state is divided into three administrative provinces (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;): Kassel in the north and east, Gießen in the centre, and Darmstadt in the south, the latter being the most populous region with the Frankfurt Rhine-Main agglomeration in its central area. The administrative regions have no legislature of their own, but are executive agencies of the state government.



Hesse is divided into 21 districts (Kreise) and five independent cities, each with their own local governments. They are, shown with abbreviations as used on vehicle number plates:

# Bergstraße (HP)
# Darmstadt-Dieburg (DA, DI)
# Groß-Gerau (GG)

=== Rhenish Hesse ===

The term &quot;Rhenish Hesse&quot; () refers to the part of the former Grand Duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt located west of the Rhine. It has not been part of the State of Hesse since 1946 due to divisions in the aftermath of World War II. This province is now part of the State of Rhineland-Palatinate. It is a hilly countryside largely devoted to vineyards; therefore, it is also called the &quot;land of the thousand hills&quot;. Its larger towns include Mainz, Worms, Bingen, Alzey, Nieder-Olm, and Ingelheim. Many inhabitants commute to work in Mainz, Wiesbaden, or Frankfurt.

== State symbols and politics ==
Hesse has been a parliamentary republic since 1918, except during Nazi rule (1933–1945). The German federal system has elements of exclusive federal competences, shared competences, and exclusive competences of the states. Hesse is famous for having a rather brisk style in its politics with the ruling parties being either the center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) or the center-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). Due to the Hessian electoral laws, the biggest party normally needs a smaller coalition partner.

=== Head of state ===
As Hesse is a partly sovereign federated state, its constitution combines the offices of the head of state and head of government in one office called the Minister-President (German: &quot;Ministerpräsident&quot;) which is comparable to the office of a prime minister.

=== 2023 Election ===
After the 2023 election, the coalition government in Hesse changed from a Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and Alliance 90/The Greens coalition to an agreement between the CDU and Social Democratic Party.

===2018 Election===

In the 2018 state elections the two leading parties, CDU and SPD, lost 11.3% (7 seats) and 10.9% (8 seats) of the vote respectively. The Green party, a member of Hesse&#x27;s previous governing coalition with CDU, gained 8.7% (16 seats). The largest gains during the election were made by Alternative for Germany (AfD) at 13.1%. As AfD had not passed the 5% threshold in the 2013 state election, this marked its first entry into the Hessian parliament (&quot;Hessischer Landtag&quot;). The two other parties also made gains. The major losses of the two leading parties (whose coalition made up the federal cabinet during the election) closely mirrors the results of the 2018 state elections in Bavaria. In the 2018-2023 parliament, the conservative CDU held 40 seats, the centre-left SPD and the leftist Green party each held 29 seats, the right-wing AfD held 19 seats, the liberal FDP party held 11 seats and the socialist party The Left held 9 seats.

=== Foreign affairs ===
As a member state of the German federation, Hesse does not have a diplomatic service of its own. However, Hesse operates representation offices in such foreign countries as the United States, China, Hungary, Cuba, Russia, Poland, and Iran. These offices are mostly used to represent Hessian interests in cultural and economic affairs. Hesse has also permanent representation offices in Berlin at the federal government of Germany and in Brussels at the institutions of the European Union.

=== Flag and anthem ===
The flag colors of Hesse are red and white, which are printed on a Hessian sack. The civil flag of Hesse resembles that of Monaco&#x27;s and, particularly, Indonesia&#x27;s. The Hessian coat of arms shows a lion rampant striped with red and white (silver), on a blue field. The official anthem of Hesse is called &quot;Hessenlied&quot; (&quot;Song of Hesse&quot;) and was written by Albrecht Brede (music) and Carl Preser (lyrics).

== Demographics ==


Hesse has a population of over 6 million, nearly 4 million of which is concentrated in the Rhein-Main region (German: &quot;Rhein-Main Gebiet&quot;) in the south of the state, an area that includes the most populous city, Frankfurt am Main, the capital Wiesbaden, and Darmstadt and Offenbach. The population of Hesse is predicted to shrink by 4.3% by 2030, with the biggest falls in the north of the state, especially in the area around the city of Kassel. Frankfurt is the fastest growing city with a predicted rise in population of 4.8% by 2030. Frankfurt&#x27;s growth is driven by its importance as a financial centre and it receives immigrants from all over the world: in 2015 over half of the city&#x27;s population had an immigrant background.

=== Language ===

Three different languages or dialect groups are spoken in Hesse: The Far North is part of the Low Saxon language area, divided into a tiny Eastphalian and a larger Westphalian dialect area. Most of Hesse belongs to the West Middle German dialect zone. There is some disagreement as to whether all Hessian dialects south of the Benrath line may be subsumed under one dialect group: Rhine Franconian, or whether most dialects should be regarded as a dialect group of its own: Hessian, whereas only South Hessian is part of Rhine Franconian. Hessian proper can be split into Lower Hessian in the north, East Hessian in the East around Fulda and Central Hessian, which covers the largest area of all dialects in Hesse. In the extreme Northeast, the Thuringian dialect zone extends into Hesse, whereas in the Southeast, the state border to Bavaria is not fully identical to the dialect border between East Franconian and East Hessian.

Since approximately World War II, a spoken variety of Standard German with dialect substrate has been superseding the traditional dialects mentioned so far. This development knows a north-to-south movement, the north being early to supplant the traditional language, whereas in the south, there is still a considerable part of the population that communicates in South Hessian. In most of the areas, however, the traditional language is close to extinction, whereas until the first half of the 20th century, almost the entire population spoke dialect in almost all situations. The Upper Class started to speak Standard German beginning in the late 19th century, so for decades, the traditional language served as a sociolect.

The prominent written language in Hesse has been Standard German since the 16th century. Before, the Low Saxon part used Middle Low German, the rest of the Land Early Modern German as prominent written languages. These had supplanted Latin in the High Middle Ages.

=== Religion ===

In 2016 Christianity was the most widespread religion in the state (63%). In 2011, 40% of Hessians belonged to the Protestant Church in Hesse and Nassau or Evangelical Church of Hesse Electorate-Waldeck (members of the Protestant Church in Germany), 25% adhered to the Roman Catholic Church, while other Christians constituted some 3%; the next most common religion of the Hessian population was Islam, adhered to by 7%.

=== Road transport ===
Hesse has a dense highway network with a total of 24 motorways. The internationally important motorway routes through Hesse are the A3, A5, and A7. Close to Frankfurt Airport is the Frankfurter Kreuz, Germany&#x27;s busiest and one of Europe&#x27;s busiest motorway junctions, where the motorways A3 (Arnhem-Cologne-Frankfurt-Nuremberg-Passau) and A5 (Hattenbach-Frankfurt-Karlsruhe-Basel) intersect. The A5 becomes as wide as four lanes in each direction near the city of Frankfurt am Main, and during the rush-hour, it is possible to use the emergency lanes on the A3 and A5 motorway in the Rhine-Main Region, adding additional lanes. Other major leading Hesse highways are the A4, the A44, the A45, the Federal Highway A66 and the A67. There are also a number of smaller motorways and major trunk roads, some of which are dual carriageways.

=== Railway transport ===
Hesse is accessed by many major rail lines, including the high-speed lines Cologne–Frankfurt(op.speed 300 km/h) and Hanover–Würzburg. Other north-south connections traverse major east–west routes from Wiesbaden and Mainz to Frankfurt and from Hanau and Aschaffenburg to Fulda and Kassel. The Frankfurt Central Station is the most important hub for German trains, with over 1,100 trains per day.

The region around Frankfurt has an extensive S-Bahn network, the S-Bahn Rhein-Main, which is complemented by many regional train connections. In the rest of the country, the rail network is less extensive. Since 2007, the region around Kassel has been served by the RegioTram, a tram-train-concept similar to the Karlsruhe model.

=== Air transport ===
Frankfurt Airport is by far the largest airport in Germany with more than 57 million passengers each year, is and among the world&#x27;s ten largest. Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport lies to the south, and is frequented by general aviation and private planes. Kassel Airport offers a few flights to holiday destinations, but has struggled to compete. There are also a number of sports airfields. Low-cost airlines, especially Ryanair, use Frankfurt-Hahn Airport as a major base, although the airport is actually located about 100 km from Frankfurt in the neighbouring state of Rhineland-Palatinate. The DFS (German air traffic control) has its headquarters in Langen. A Boeing 747 owned by Lufthansa was named after Hesse, on 20 November 1974, the aircraft crashed in Kenya killing 59 of the 157 passengers and crew on board.

<doc id="38413" wikidata="Q190474" url="?curid=38413" title="Activation energy">
<text>In the Arrhenius model of reaction rates, activation energy is the minimum amount of energy that must be available to reactants for a chemical reaction to occur. The activation energy (&quot;E&quot;a) of a reaction is measured in kilojoules per mole (kJ/mol) or kilocalories per mole (kcal/mol). Activation energy can be thought of as the magnitude of the potential barrier (sometimes called the energy barrier) separating minima of the potential energy surface pertaining to the initial and final thermodynamic state. For a chemical reaction to proceed at a reasonable rate, the temperature of the system should be high enough such that there exists an appreciable number of molecules with translational energy equal to or greater than the activation energy. The term &quot;activation energy&quot; was introduced in 1889 by the Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius.

==Other uses==
Although less commonly used, activation energy also applies to nuclear reactions and various other physical phenomena.

== Temperature dependence and the relation to the Arrhenius equation ==

The Arrhenius equation gives the quantitative basis of the relationship between the activation energy and the rate at which a reaction proceeds. From the equation, the activation energy can be found through the relation
formula_1

where &quot;A&quot; is the pre-exponential factor for the reaction, &quot;R&quot; is the universal gas constant, &quot;T&quot; is the absolute temperature (usually in kelvins), and &quot;k&quot; is the reaction rate coefficient. Even without knowing &quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;a can be evaluated from the variation in reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature (within the validity of the Arrhenius equation).

At a more advanced level, the net Arrhenius activation energy term from the Arrhenius equation is best regarded as an experimentally determined parameter that indicates the sensitivity of the reaction rate to temperature. There are two objections to associating this activation energy with the threshold barrier for an elementary reaction. First, it is often unclear as to whether or not reaction does proceed in one step; threshold barriers that are averaged out over all elementary steps have little theoretical value. Second, even if the reaction being studied is elementary, a spectrum of individual collisions contributes to rate constants obtained from bulk (&#x27;bulb&#x27;) experiments involving billions of molecules, with many different reactant collision geometries and angles, different translational and (possibly) vibrational energies—all of which may lead to different microscopic reaction rates.

== Catalysts ==
A substance that modifies the transition state to lower the activation energy is termed a catalyst; a catalyst composed only of protein and (if applicable) small molecule cofactors is termed an enzyme. A catalyst increases the rate of reaction without being consumed in the reaction. In addition, the catalyst lowers the activation energy, but it does not change the energies of the original reactants or products, and so does not change equilibrium. Rather, the reactant energy and the product energy remain the same and only the &quot;activation energy&quot; is altered (lowered).

A catalyst is able to reduce the activation energy by forming a transition state in a more favorable manner. Catalysts, by nature, create a more &quot;comfortable&quot; fit for the substrate of a reaction to progress to a transition state. This is possible due to a release of energy that occurs when the substrate binds to the active site of a catalyst. This energy is known as Binding Energy. Upon binding to a catalyst, substrates partake in numerous stabilizing forces while within the active site (e.g. hydrogen bonding or van der Waals forces). Specific and favorable bonding occurs within the active site until the substrate forms to become the high-energy transition state. Forming the transition state is more favorable with the catalyst because the favorable stabilizing interactions within the active site &quot;release&quot; energy. A chemical reaction is able to manufacture a high-energy transition state molecule more readily when there is a stabilizing fit within the active site of a catalyst. The binding energy of a reaction is this energy released when favorable interactions between substrate and catalyst occur. The binding energy released assists in achieving the unstable transition state. Reactions without catalysts need a higher input of energy to achieve the transition state. Non-catalyzed reactions do not have free energy available from active site stabilizing interactions, such as catalytic enzyme reactions.

== Relationship with Gibbs energy of activation ==
In the Arrhenius equation, the term activation energy (&quot;E&quot;a) is used to describe the energy required to reach the transition state, and the exponential relationship holds. In transition state theory, a more sophisticated model of the relationship between reaction rates and the transition state, a superficially similar mathematical relationship, the Eyring equation, is used to describe the rate constant of a reaction: . However, instead of modeling the temperature dependence of reaction rate phenomenologically, the Eyring equation models individual elementary steps of a reaction. Thus, for a multistep process, there is no straightforward relationship between the two models. Nevertheless, the functional forms of the Arrhenius and Eyring equations are similar, and for a one-step process, simple and chemically meaningful correspondences can be drawn between Arrhenius and Eyring parameters.

Instead of also using &quot;E&quot;a, the Eyring equation uses the concept of Gibbs energy and the symbol Δ&quot;G&quot;‡ to denote the Gibbs energy of activation to achieve the transition state. In the equation, &quot;k&quot;B and &quot;h&quot; are the Boltzmann and Planck constants, respectively. Although the equations look similar, it is important to note that the Gibbs energy contains an entropic term in addition to the enthalpic one. In the Arrhenius equation, this entropic term is accounted for by the pre-exponential factor &quot;A&quot;. More specifically, we can write the Gibbs free energy of activation in terms of enthalpy and entropy of activation: . Then, for a unimolecular, one-step reaction, the &quot;approximate&quot; relationships and hold. Note, however, that in Arrhenius theory proper, &quot;A&quot; is temperature independent, while here, there is a linear dependence on &quot;T&quot;. For a one-step unimolecular process whose half-life at room temperature is about 2 hours, Δ&quot;G&quot;‡ is approximately 23 kcal/mol. This is also the roughly the magnitude of &quot;E&quot;a for a reaction that proceeds over several hours at room temperature. Due to the relatively small magnitude of &quot;T&quot;Δ&quot;S&quot;‡ and &quot;RT&quot; at ordinary temperatures for most reactions, in sloppy discourse, &quot;E&quot;a, Δ&quot;G&quot;‡, and Δ&quot;H&quot;‡ are often conflated and all referred to as the &quot;activation energy&quot;.

The enthalpy, entropy and Gibbs energy of activation are more correctly written as Δ‡&quot;H&quot;o, Δ‡&quot;S&quot;o and Δ‡&quot;G&quot;o respectively, where the o indicates a quantity evaluated between standard states. However, some authors omit the o in order to simplify the notation.

The total free energy change of a reaction is independent of the activation energy however. Physical and chemical reactions can be either exergonic or endergonic, but the activation energy is not related to the spontaneity of a reaction. The overall reaction energy change is not altered by the activation energy.

== Negative activation energy ==
In some cases, rates of reaction &quot;decrease&quot; with increasing temperature. When following an approximately exponential relationship so the rate constant can still be fit to an Arrhenius expression, this results in a negative value of &quot;E&quot;a.

Elementary reactions exhibiting negative activation energies are typically barrierless reactions, in which the reaction proceeding relies on the capture of the molecules in a potential well. Increasing the temperature leads to a reduced probability of the colliding molecules capturing one another (with more glancing collisions not leading to reaction as the higher momentum carries the colliding particles out of the potential well), expressed as a reaction cross section that decreases with increasing temperature. Such a situation no longer leads itself to direct interpretations as the height of a potential barrier.

Some multistep reactions can also have apparent negative activation energies. For example, the overall rate constant k for a two-step reaction A B, B → C is given by k = k2K1, where k2 is the rate constant of the rate-limiting slow second step and K1 is the equilibrium constant of the rapid first step. In some reactions, K1 decreases with temperature more rapidly than k2 increases, so that k actually decreases with temperature corresponding to a negative observed activation energy.

An example is the oxidation of nitric oxide which is a termolecular reaction &lt;chem&gt;2 NO + O2 -&gt; 2 NO2&lt;/chem&gt;. The rate law is formula_2 with a negative activation energy. This is explained by the two-step mechanism: &lt;chem&gt;2 NO &lt;=&gt; N2O2&lt;/chem&gt; and &lt;chem&gt;N2O2 + O2 -&gt; 2 NO2&lt;/chem&gt;.

Certain cationic polymerization reactions have negative activation energies so that the rate decreases with temperature. For chain-growth polymerization, the overall activation energy is formula_3, where i, p and t refer respectively to initiation, propagation and termination steps. The propagation step normally has a very small activation energy, so that the overall value is negative if the activation energy for termination is larger than that for initiation. The normal range of overall activation energies for cationic polymerization varies from .

<text>North Rhine-Westphalia or North-Rhine/Westphalia, commonly shortened to NRW, is a state (&quot;Bundesland&quot;) in Western Germany. With more than 18 million inhabitants, it is the most populous state in Germany. Apart from the city-states (Berlin, Hamburg and Bremen), it is also the most densely populated state in Germany. Covering an area of , it is the fourth-largest German state by size.

North Rhine-Westphalia features 30 of the 81 German municipalities with over 100,000 inhabitants, including Cologne (over 1 million), the state capital Düsseldorf (630,000), Dortmund and Essen (about 590,000 inhabitants each) and other cities predominantly located in the Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan area, the largest urban area in Germany and the fourth-largest on the European continent. The location of the Rhine-Ruhr at the heart of the European Blue Banana makes it well connected to other major European cities and metropolitan areas like the Randstad, the Flemish Diamond and the Frankfurt Rhine-Main Region.

North Rhine-Westphalia was established in 1946 after World War II from the Prussian provinces of Westphalia and the northern part of Rhine Province (North Rhine), and the Free State of Lippe by the British military administration in Allied-occupied Germany and became a state of the Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. The city of Bonn served as the federal capital until the reunification of Germany in 1990 and as the seat of government until 1999.

Culturally, North Rhine-Westphalia is not a uniform area; there are significant differences, especially in traditional customs, between the Rhineland region on the one hand and the regions of Westphalia and Lippe on the other. Its economy is the largest among German states by GRDP but is below the national average in GRDP per capita.

==History==
===Creation===

The state of North Rhine-Westphalia was established by the British military administration&#x27;s &quot;Operation Marriage&quot; on 23 August 1946 by merging the province of Westphalia and the northern parts of the Rhine Province, both being political divisions of the former state of Prussia within the German Reich. On 21 January 1947, the former state of Lippe was merged with North Rhine-Westphalia. The constitution of North Rhine-Westphalia was then ratified through a referendum.

===Rhineland===

The first written account of the area was by its conqueror, Julius Caesar, the territories west of the Rhine were occupied by the Eburones and east of the Rhine he reported the Ubii (across from Cologne) and the Sugambri to their north. The Ubii and some other Germanic tribes such as the Cugerni were later settled on the west side of the Rhine in the Roman province of Germania Inferior. Julius Caesar conquered the tribes on the left bank, and Augustus established numerous fortified posts on the Rhine, but the Romans never succeeded in gaining a firm footing on the right bank, where the Sugambri neighboured several other tribes including the Tencteri and Usipetes. North of the Sigambri and the Rhine region were the Bructeri.

As the power of the Roman empire declined, many of these tribes came to be seen collectively as Ripuarian Franks and they pushed forward along both banks of the Rhine, and by the end of the fifth century had conquered all the lands that had formerly been under Roman influence. By the eighth century, the Frankish dominion was firmly established in western Germany and northern Gaul, but at the same time, to the north, Westphalia was being taken over by Saxons pushing south.

The Merovingian and Carolingian Franks eventually built an empire which controlled first their Ripuarian kin, and then the Saxons. On the division of the Carolingian Empire at the Treaty of Verdun, the part of the province to the east of the river fell to East Francia, while that to the west remained with the kingdom of Lotharingia.

By the time of Otto I (d. 973), both banks of the Rhine had become part of the Holy Roman Empire, and the Rhenish territory was divided between the duchies of Upper Lorraine on the Moselle and Lower Lorraine on the Meuse. The Ottonian dynasty had both Saxon and Frankish ancestry.
As the central power of the Holy Roman Emperor weakened, the Rhineland split into numerous small, independent, separate vicissitudes and special chronicles. The old Lotharingian divisions became obsolete, although the name survives for example in Lorraine in France, and throughout the Middle Ages and even into modern times, the nobility of these areas often sought to preserve the idea of a preeminent duke within Lotharingia, something claimed by the Dukes of Limburg, and the Dukes of Brabant. Such struggles as the War of the Limburg Succession therefore continued to create military and political links between what is now Rhineland-Westphalia and neighbouring Belgium and the Netherlands.

In spite of its dismembered condition and the sufferings it underwent at the hands of its French neighbours in various periods of warfare, the Rhenish territory prospered greatly and stood in the foremost rank of German culture and progress. Aachen was the place of coronation of the German emperors, and the ecclesiastical principalities of the Rhine bulked largely in German history.

Prussia first set foot on the Rhine in 1609 by the occupation of the Duchy of Cleves and about a century later Upper Guelders and Moers also became Prussian. At the peace of Basel in 1795, the whole of the left bank of the Rhine was resigned to France, and in 1806, the Rhenish princes all joined the Confederation of the Rhine.

After the Congress of Vienna, Prussia was awarded the entire Rhineland, which included the Grand Duchy of Berg, the ecclesiastic electorates of Trier and Cologne, the free cities of Aachen and Cologne, and nearly a hundred small lordships and abbeys. The Prussian Rhine province was formed in 1822 and Prussia had the tact to leave the lower Rhenish districts in undisturbed possession of the liberal institutions to which they had become accustomed under the republican rule of the French. In 1920, the districts of Eupen and Malmedy were transferred to Belgium (see German-speaking Community of Belgium).

===Westphalia===

Around AD 1, numerous incursions occurred through Westphalia and perhaps even some permanent Roman or Romanized settlements. The Battle of Teutoburg Forest took place near Osnabrück and some of the Germanic tribes who fought at this battle came from the area of Westphalia. Charlemagne is thought to have spent considerable time in Paderborn and nearby parts. His Saxon Wars also partly took place in what is thought of as Westphalia today. Popular legends link his adversary Widukind to places near Detmold, Bielefeld, Lemgo, Osnabrück, and other places in Westphalia. Widukind was buried in Enger, which is also a subject of a legend.

Along with Angria, Eastphalia, and Nordalbingia, Westphalia (&quot;Westfalahi&quot;) was originally a district of the Duchy of Saxony. In 1180, Westphalia was elevated to the rank of a duchy by Emperor Barbarossa. The Duchy of Westphalia comprised only a small area south of the Lippe River.
Parts of Westphalia came under Brandenburg-Prussian control during the 17th and 18th centuries, but most of it remained divided duchies and other feudal areas of power. The Peace of Westphalia of 1648, signed in Münster and Osnabrück, ended the Thirty Years&#x27; War. The concept of nation-state sovereignty resulting from the treaty became known as &quot;Westphalian sovereignty&quot;.

As a result of the Protestant Reformation, there is no dominant religion in Westphalia. Catholicism and Lutheranism are on relatively equal footing. Lutheranism is strong in the eastern and northern parts with numerous free churches. Münster and especially Paderborn are thought of as Catholic. Osnabrück is divided almost equally between Catholicism and Protestantism.

After the defeat of the Prussian Army at the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807 made the Westphalian territories part of the Kingdom of Westphalia from 1807 to 1813. It was founded by Napoleon and was a French vassal state. This state only shared the name with the historical region; it contained only a relatively small part of Westphalia, consisting instead mostly of Hessian and Eastphalian regions.

After the Congress of Vienna, the Kingdom of Prussia received a large amount of territory in the Westphalian region and created the province of Westphalia in 1815. The northernmost portions of the former kingdom, including the town of Osnabrück, had become part of the states of Hanover and Oldenburg.

==Flags and coat of arms==
The flag of North Rhine-Westphalia is green-white-red with the combined coats of arms of the Rhineland (white line before green background, symbolizing the river Rhine), Westfalen (the white horse) and Lippe (the red rose). After the establishment of North Rhine-Westphalia in 1946, the tricolor was first introduced in 1948, but was not formally adopted until 1953. The plain variant of the tricolor is considered the civil flag and state ensign, while government authorities use the state flag (&quot;Landesdienstflagge&quot;) which is defaced with the state&#x27;s coat of arms. The state ensign can easily be mistaken for a distressed flag of Hungary, as well as the former national flag of Iran (1964–1980). The same flag was used by the Rhenish Republic (1923–1924) as a symbol of independence and freedom.

The horse on the coat of arms is a reference to the Saxon Steed, a heraldic motif associated with both Westphalia and Lower Saxony. The horse first featured in the 15th century coat of arms of the Duchy of Westphalia, before being inherited by the Prussian province of Westphalia and finally the modern state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

==Geography==
North Rhine-Westphalia encompasses the plains of the Lower Rhine region and parts of the Central Uplands (&quot;die Mittelgebirge&quot;) up to the gorge of Porta Westfalica. The state covers an area of and shares borders with Belgium (Wallonia) in the southwest and the Netherlands (Limburg, Gelderland and Overijssel) in the west and northwest. It has borders with the German states of Lower Saxony to the north and northeast, Rhineland-Palatinate to the south and Hesse to the southeast.

Approximately half of the state is located in the relative low-lying terrain of the Westphalian Lowland and the Rhineland, both extending broadly into the North German Plain. A few isolated hill ranges are located within these lowlands, among them the Hohe Mark, the Beckum Hills, the Baumberge and the Stemmer Berge. &lt;br&gt;
The terrain rises towards the south and in the east of the state into parts of Germany&#x27;s Central Uplands. These hill ranges are the Weser Uplands – including the Egge Hills, the Wiehen Hills, the Wesergebirge and the Teutoburg Forest in the east, the Sauerland, the Bergisches Land, the Siegerland and the Siebengebirge in the south, as well as the left-Rhenish Eifel in the southwest of the state. The Rothaargebirge in the border region with Hesse rises to height of about 800 m above sea level. The highest of these mountains are the Langenberg, at 843.2 m above sea level, the Kahler Asten (840.7 m) and the Clemensberg (839.2 m).

The planimetrically determined centre of North Rhine-Westphalia is located in the south of Dortmund-Aplerbeck in the Aplerbecker Mark (51° 28&#x27; N, 7° 33&#x27; Ö). Its westernmost point is situated near Selfkant close to the Dutch border, the easternmost near Höxter on the Weser. The southernmost point lies near Hellenthal in the Eifel region. The northernmost point is the NRW-Nordpunkt near Rahden in the northeast of the state. The Nordpunkt has located the only 100 km to the south of the North Sea coast. The deepest natural dip is arranged in the district Zyfflich in the city of Kranenburg with 9.2 m above sea level in the northwest of the state. Though, the deepest point overground results from mining. The open-pit Hambach reaches at Niederzier a deep of 293 m below sea level. At the same time, this is the deepest human-made dip in Germany.

The most important rivers flowing at least partially through North Rhine-Westphalia include: the Rhine, the Ruhr, the Ems, the Lippe, and the Weser. The Rhine is by far the most important river in North Rhine-Westphalia: it enters the state as Middle Rhine near Bad Honnef, where still being part of the Mittelrhein wine region. It changes into the Lower Rhine near Bad Godesberg and leaves North Rhine-Westphalia near Emmerich at a width of 730 metres. Almost immediately after entering the Netherlands, the Rhine splits into many branches.

The Pader, which flows entirely within the city of Paderborn, is considered Germany&#x27;s shortest river.

For many, North Rhine-Westphalia is synonymous with industrial areas and urban agglomerations. However, the largest part of the state is used for agriculture (almost 52%) and forests (25%).

=== Subdivisions ===

The state consists of five government regions (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;), divided into 31 districts (&quot;Kreise&quot;) and 23 urban districts (&quot;kreisfreie Städte&quot;). In total, North Rhine-Westphalia has 396 municipalities (1997), including the urban districts, which are municipalities by themselves. The government regions have an assembly elected by the districts and municipalities, while the &quot;Landschaftsverband&quot; has a directly elected assembly.

The five government regions of North Rhine-Westphalia each belong to one of the two &quot;Landschaftsverbände&quot;:

=== Borders ===
The state&#x27;s area covers a maximum distance of 291 km from north to south, and 266 km from east to west. The total length of the state&#x27;s borders is 1,645 km. The following countries and states have a border with North Rhine-Westphalia:
* Belgium (99 km)
* Netherlands (387 km)
* Lower Saxony (583 km)
* Hesse (269 km)
* Rhineland-Palatinate (307 km)

==Demographics==

North Rhine-Westphalia has a population of approximately 18.1 million inhabitants (more than the entire former East Germany, and slightly more than the Netherlands) and is centred around the polycentric Rhine-Ruhr metropolitan region, which includes the industrial Ruhr region with the largest city of Dortmund and the Rhenish cities of Bonn, Cologne and Düsseldorf. 30 of the 80 largest cities in Germany are located within North Rhine-Westphalia. The state&#x27;s capital is Düsseldorf; the state&#x27;s largest city is Cologne. In 2022, there were 164,496 births and 234,176 deaths. 

The following table shows the ten largest cities of North Rhine-Westphalia:

===Religion===
, 50% of the population of the state adhered to the Roman Catholic Church, 22% to the Protestant Church in Germany, and 28% of the population is irreligious or adheres to other denominations or religions. North Rhine-Westphalia ranks first in population among German states for both Roman Catholics and Protestants.

In 2016, the interior ministry of North Rhine-Westphalia reported that the number of mosques with a Salafist influence had risen from 3 to 9, which indicated both an actual increase and improved reporting. According to German authorities, Salafism is incompatible with the principles codified in the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Germany, in particular: democracy, the rule of law, and political order based on human rights.

==Politics==

The politics of North Rhine-Westphalia takes place within a framework of a federal parliamentary representative democratic republic. The two main parties are, as on the federal level, the centre-right Christian Democratic Union and the centre-left Social Democratic Party. From 1966 to 2005, North Rhine-Westphalia was continuously governed by the Social Democrats or SPD-led governments.

The state&#x27;s legislative body is the Landtag (&quot;state parliament house&quot;). It may pass laws within the competency of the state, e.g. cultural matters, the education system, matters of internal security, i.e. the police, building supervision, health supervision and the media; as opposed to matters that are reserved to Federal law.

North Rhine-Westphalia uses the same electoral system as the Federal level in Germany: &quot;Personalized proportional representation&quot;. Every five years the citizens of North Rhine-Westphalia vote in a general election to elect at least 181 members of the Landtag. Only parties who win at least 5% of the votes cast may be represented in parliament.

The Landtag, the parliamentary parties and groups consisting of at least 7 members of parliament have the right to table legal proposals to the Landtag for deliberation. The law that is passed by the Landtag is delivered to the Minister-President, who, together with the ministers involved, is required to sign it and announce it in the Law and Ordinance Gazette.

===Landtag after 2022 Election===

The vote was held on 15 May, 2022. In the aftermath of the 2022 election, the Christian Democrats (CDU) and the Social Democratic Party (SPD) both had talks with the Greens. An alliance between the Greens and the SPD would have required the help of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) to gain a majority, but the FDP did not take part in these conversations. Rather, its top candidate believed that a Green/CDU alliance was the most likely outcome. All mainstream parties tend to refuse to cooperate with the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD). Ultimately, the CDU/Green alliance was the one that prevailed. The new coalition reelected Hendrik Wüst, who had been the Minister President of North Rhine-Westphalia during the last portion of the previous CDU/FDP coalition on 28 June, 2022.

==Economy==
North Rhine-Westphalia has always been Germany&#x27;s powerhouse with the largest economy among the German states by GDP figures.

In the 1950s and 1960s, Westphalia was known as &quot;Land von Kohle und Stahl&quot; (&quot;Land of Coal and Steel&quot;). In the post-World War II recovery, the Ruhr was one of the most important industrial regions in Europe, and contributed to the German Wirtschaftswunder. As of the late 1960s, repeated crises led to contractions of these industrial branches. On the other hand, producing sectors, particularly in mechanical engineering and metal and iron working industry, experienced substantial growth. Despite this structural change and an economic growth which was under national average, the 2018 GDP of 705 billion euro (1/4 of the total German GDP) made NRW the economically strongest state of Germany by GRP figures, as well as one of the most important economical areas in the world. Of Germany&#x27;s top 100 corporations, 37 are based in North Rhine-Westphalia. On a per capita base, however, North Rhine-Westphalia remains one of the weaker among the Western German states.

North Rhine-Westphalia attracts companies from both Germany and abroad. In 2009, the state had the most foreign direct investments (FDI) anywhere in Germany. Around 13,100 foreign companies from the most important investment countries control their German or European operations from bases in North Rhine-Westphalia.

There have been many changes in the state&#x27;s economy in recent times. Among the many changes in the economy, employment in the creative industries is up while the mining sector is employing fewer people. Industrial heritage sites are now workplaces for designers, artists and the advertising industry. The Ruhr region has – since the 1960s – undergone a significant structural change away from coal mining and steel industry. Many rural parts of Eastern Westphalia, Bergisches Land and the Lower Rhine ground their economy on &quot;Hidden Champions&quot; in various sectors.

As of June 2014, the unemployment rate is 8.2%, second highest among all western German states. In October 2018 the unemployment rate stood at 6.4% and was higher than the national average.
== Transport ==

With its central location in the most important European economic area, high population density, strong urbanization and numerous business locations, North Rhine-Westphalia has one of the densest transport networks in the world.

=== Regional rail network ===
The regional rail network is organised around the big cities on the Rhine and Ruhr such as Cologne, Düsseldorf and Dortmund. The public transport companies in the Ruhr area and Düsseldorf are run under the umbrella of the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr, which provides a uniform ticket system valid for the area. The region of Cologne and Bonn is run under the Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg. There is also a ticketing system called &quot;NRW-Tarif&quot; which offers tickets between all the regions of North Rhine-Westphalia. The state is well-integrated into the national rail system, the , for both passenger and goods services, each city in the region has at least one or more train stations. The bigger central stations have frequent direct connections to most bigger German cities and European cities such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Paris and Basel. Some direct trains run to Vienna and Zürich.

The Rhein-Ruhr area also contains some of the longest tram system in the world, with tram and Stadtbahn services from Witten to Krefeld in the VRR zone and Cologne to Bad Honnef and Siegburg via Bonn within the VRS zone. Besides the local public transportation there is an interconnected commuter rail network, with the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn network serving the Ruhr area as well as Düsseldorf and the S-Bahn Köln serving the area around Cologne.

, the VRR network alone consists of 978 lines, of which there are: 
* in regional rail transit
** 11 S-Bahn lines (&quot;see:&quot; Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn)
** 15 RegionalExpress lines (&quot;see:&quot; List of regional railway lines in North Rhine-Westphalia)
** 24 RegionalBahn lines (&quot;see:&quot; List of regional railway lines in North Rhine-Westphalia)
* in local rail transit 
** 19 Stadtbahn light rail lines (&quot;see:&quot; Rhine-Ruhr Stadtbahn)
** 45 tram (Straßenbahn) lines
** 1 Schwebebahn line (in Wuppertal)
** 2 H-Bahn peoplemover systems made up of three lines (two H-Bahn lines in Dortmund, and the Düsseldorf SkyTrain at Düsseldorf airport)
* in bus transit
** 906 bus lines, including
*** 33 express bus lines (Schnellbus, SB)
*** 18 semi-fast bus lines (CityExpress, CE)
** 6 trolleybus lines (in Solingen)
* 15,300 km of route network (bus, light rail, and train)
* 11,500 transit stops

In 2022 the VRS and AVV area contains 
* in regional rail transit
** 7 S-Bahn lines (with 4 being part of the Rhein-Ruhr S-Bahn)
** 11 RegionalExpress lines (6 conntected to VRR)
** 18 RegionalBahn services
* in local rail transit 
** 16 Stadtbahn lines (&quot;see:&quot; Cologne Stadtbahn and Bonn Stadtbahn)
** 3 streetcar (Straßenbahn) lines within the city of Bonn

===Road===

North Rhine-Westphalia has the densest network of Autobahns in Germany and similar Schnellstraßen (expressways). The Autobahn network is built in a grid network, with five east–west (A2, A4, A40, A42, A44) and eight north–south (A1, A3, A43, A45, A52, A57, A59, A61) routes. The A1, A2, A3, A4 and A61 are mostly used by through traffic, while the other autobahns have a more regional function.

Both the A44 and the A52 have several missing links, in various stages of planning. Some missing sections are currently in construction or planned to be constructed in the near future.

Additional expressways serve as bypasses and local routes, especially around Dortmund and Bochum. Due to the density of the autobahns and expressways, Bundesstraßen are less important for intercity traffic. The first Autobahns in the Region opened during the mid-1930s. Due to the density of the network, and the number of alternative routes, traffic volumes are generally lower than other major metropolitan areas in Europe. Traffic congestion is an everyday occurrence, but far less so than in the Randstad in the Netherlands, another polycentric urban area. Most important Autobahns have six lanes.

=== Airports ===
The region benefits from the presence of several airport infrastructure. The main airport is Düsseldorf Airport, world class, which hosted 25.5 million passengers in 2019 and offers flights to various international destinations. Düsseldorf is the fourth-largest airport in Germany after Frankfurt, Munich and Berlin and serves as a hub for Eurowings and as focus city for several more airlines. The airport has three passenger terminals and two runways and can handle wide-body aircraft up to the Airbus A380.

The second airport is the international airport of Germany&#x27;s fourth-largest city Cologne, and also serves Bonn, former capital of West Germany. With around 10 million passengers passing through it in 2023, it is the sixth-largest passenger airport in Germany and the third-largest in terms of cargo operations. It is also a hub for Eurowings, but also for some cargo airlines. By traffic units, which combines cargo and passengers, the airport is in fifth position in Germany. As of March 2015, Cologne Bonn Airport had services to 115 passenger destinations in 35 countries. It is named after Konrad Adenauer, a Cologne native and the first post-war Chancellor of West Germany.

Third airport in the region, Dortmund Airport is a minor international airport located east of Dortmund. It serves the eastern Rhine-Ruhr area, the largest urban agglomeration in Germany, and is mainly used for low-cost and leisure charter flights. In 2019 the airport served 2,719,563 passengers.

There are three more minor airports within the state: Münster Osnabrück Airport, Airport Weeze and Paderborn Lippstadt Airport.

===Waterways===
The Rhine flows through North Rhine-Westphalia. Its banks are usually heavily populated and industrialized, in particular the agglomerations Cologne, Düsseldorf and Ruhr area. Here the Rhine flows through the largest conurbation in Germany, the Rhine-Ruhr region. Duisburg Inner Harbour (Duisport) and Dortmund Port are large industrial inland ports and serve as hubs along the Rhine and the German inland water transport system. The country is crossed by many canals like Rhine–Herne Canal (RHK), der Wesel-Datteln-Kanal (WDK), der Datteln-Hamm-Kanal (DHK) and Dortmund-Ems-Kanal (DEK) an important role for inland navigation.

==Education==

 RWTH Aachen is one of Germany&#x27;s leading universities of technology and was chosen by DFG as one of the German Universities of Excellence in 2007, 2012 and again in 2019. North Rhine-Westphalia is home to 14 universities and over 50 partly postgraduate colleges, with a total of over 742,000 students. Largest and oldest university is the University of Cologne &quot;(Universität zu Köln)&quot;, founded in 1388 AD, since 2012 also one of Germany&#x27;s eleven Universities of Excellence. University of Duisburg-Essen (Universität Duisburg-Essen), is also well known and is one of the largest universities in Germany.

FC Köln won two titles, including the first in 1963. Before the league&#x27;s establishment, North Rhine-Westfalian teams competed for the title of Deutscher Fußballmeister (German Football Champion). Here, FC Schalke 04 brought home seven titles, while Dortmund and Köln won an additional three and one title(s), respectively. Fortuna Düsseldorf and Rot-Weiß Essen have each been German Champion once. North Rhine-Westphalia has been a very successful footballing state having a combined total of 25 championships, fewer only than Bavaria.

<doc id="38415" wikidata="Q11025104" url="?curid=38415" title="Electrode potential">
<text>In electrochemistry, electrode potential is the voltage of a galvanic cell built from a standard reference electrode and another electrode to be characterized. By convention, the reference electrode is the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE). It is defined to have a potential of zero volts. It may also be defined as the potential difference between the charged metallic rods and salt solution.

The electrode potential has its origin in the potential difference developed at the interface between the electrode and the electrolyte. It is common, for instance, to speak of the electrode potential of the redox couple.

== Origin and interpretation==
Electrode potential appears at the interface between an electrode and electrolyte due to the transfer of charged species across the interface, specific adsorption of ions at the interface, and specific adsorption/orientation of polar molecules, including those of the solvent.

In an electrochemical cell, the cathode and the anode have certain electrode potentials independently and the difference between them is the cell potential:

:formula_1

The electrode potential may be either that at equilibrium at the working electrode (&quot;reversible potential&quot;), or a potential with a non-zero net reaction on the working electrode but zero net current (&quot;corrosion potential&quot;, &quot;mixed potential&quot;), or a potential with a non-zero net current on the working electrode (like in galvanic corrosion or voltammetry). Reversible potentials can be sometimes converted to the standard electrode potential for a given electroactive species by extrapolation of the measured values to the standard state.

The value of the electrode potential under non-equilibrium depends on the nature and composition of the contacting phases, and on the kinetics of electrode reactions at the interface (see Butler–Volmer equation).

An operational assumption for determinations of the electrode potentials with the standard hydrogen electrode involves this reference electrode with hydrogen ion in an ideal solution having is &quot;zero potential at all temperatures&quot; equivalently to standard enthalpy of formation of hydrogen ion is also &quot;zero at all temperatures&quot;.

==Measurement==

The measurement is generally conducted using a three-electrode setup (see the drawing):
# working electrode,
# counter electrode,
# reference electrode (standard hydrogen electrode or an equivalent).

In case of non-zero net current on the electrode, it is essential to minimize the ohmic IR-drop in the electrolyte, e.g., by positioning the reference electrode near the surface of the working electrode (e.g., see Luggin capillary), or by using a supporting electrolyte of sufficiently high conductivity. The potential measurements are performed with the positive terminal of the electrometer connected to the working electrode and the negative terminal to the reference electrode.

==Sign conventions==
Historically, two conventions for sign for the electrode potential have formed:
# convention &quot;Nernst–Lewis–Latimer&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;American&quot;),
# convention &quot;Gibbs–Ostwald–Stockholm&quot; (sometimes referred to as &quot;European&quot;).

In 1953 in Stockholm IUPAC recognized that either of the conventions is permissible; however, it unanimously recommended that only the magnitude expressed according to the convention (2) be called &quot;the electrode potential&quot;. To avoid possible ambiguities, the electrode potential thus defined can also be referred to as &quot;Gibbs–Stockholm electrode potential&quot;. In both conventions, the standard hydrogen electrode is defined to have a potential of 0 V. Both conventions also agree on the sign of for a half-cell reaction when it is written as a reduction.

The main difference between the two conventions is that upon reversing the direction of a half-cell reaction &quot;as written&quot;, according to the convention (1) the sign of also switches, whereas in the convention (2) it does not. The logic behind switching the sign of is to maintain the correct sign relationship with the Gibbs free energy change, given by where is the number of electrons involved and is the Faraday constant. It is assumed that the half-reaction is balanced by the appropriate SHE half-reaction. Since switches sign when a reaction is written in reverse, so too, proponents of the convention (1) argue, should the sign of . Proponents of the convention (2) argue that all reported electrode potentials should be consistent with the electrostatic sign of the relative potential difference. 

== Potential difference of a cell assembled of two electrodes ==
Potential of a cell assembled of two electrodes can be determined from the two individual electrode potentials using

:formula_2 however , it depends.

or, equivalently,

:formula_3

This follows from the IUPAC definition of the electric potential difference of a galvanic cell, according to which the electric potential difference of a cell is the difference of the potentials of the electrodes on the right and the left of the galvanic cell. When is positive, then positive electrical charge flows through the cell from the left electrode (anode) to the right electrode (cathode).

<doc id="38418" wikidata="Q61314" url="?curid=38418" title="Erich Hückel">
<text>Erich Armand Arthur Joseph Hückel (August 9, 1896, Berlin – February 16, 1980, Marburg) was a German physicist and physical chemist. He is mainly known for the Debye–Hückel theory of electrolytic solutions and the Hückel method of approximate molecular orbital (MO) calculations on π electron systems.

Hückel was born in the Charlottenburg suburb of Berlin. He studied physics and mathematics from 1914 to 1921 at the University of Göttingen.

On receiving his doctorate, he became an assistant at Göttingen, but soon became an assistant to Peter Debye at Zürich. It was there that he and Debye developed their theory (the Debye–Hückel theory, in 1923) of electrolytic solutions, elucidating the behavior of strong electrolytes by considering interionic forces, in order to account for their electrical conductivity and their thermodynamic activity coefficients.

After spending 1928 and 1929 in England and Denmark, working briefly with Niels Bohr, Hückel joined the faculty of the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. In 1935, he moved to Phillips University in Marburg, where he finally was named Full Professor a year before his retirement 1961. He was a member of the International Academy of Quantum Molecular Science.

==Theories of unsaturated organic molecules==
Hückel is most famous for developing the Hückel method of approximate molecular orbital (MO) calculations on π electron systems, a simplified quantum-mechanical method to deal with planar unsaturated organic molecules. In 1930 he proposed a σ/π separation theory to explain the restricted rotation of alkenes (compounds containing a C=C double bond). This model extended a 1929 interpretation of the bonding in triplet oxygen by Lennard-Jones. According to Hückel, only the ethene σ bond is axially symmetric about the C-C axis, but the π bond is not; this restricts rotation. In 1931 he generalized his analysis by formulating both valence bond (VB) and molecular orbital (MO) descriptions of benzene and other cycloconjugated hydrocarbons.

Although undeniably a cornerstone of organic chemistry, Hückel&#x27;s concepts were undeservedly unrecognized for two decades. Pauling and Wheland characterized his approach as &quot;cumbersome&quot; at the time, and their competing resonance theory was relatively easier to understand for chemists without fundamental physics background, even if they couldn&#x27;t grasp the concept of quantum superposition and confused it with tautomerism. His lack of communication skills contributed: when Robert Robinson sent him a friendly request, he responded arrogantly that he is not interested in organic chemistry.

The famous Hückel 4n+2 rule for determining whether ring molecules composed of C=C bonds would show aromatic properties was first stated clearly by Doering in a 1951 article on tropolone. Tropolone had been recognised as an aromatic molecule by Dewar in 1945.

In 1936, Hückel developed the theory of π-conjugated biradicals (non-Kekulé molecules). The first example, known as the Schlenk–Brauns hydrocarbon, had been discovered in the same year. The credit for explaining such biradicals is usually given to Christopher Longuet-Higgins in 1950.

In 1937, Hückel refined his MO theory of pi electrons in unsaturated organic molecules. This is still used occasionally as an approximation, though the more precise PPP Pariser–Parr–Pople method succeeded it in 1953. &quot;Extended Hückel MO theory&quot; (EHT) applies to both sigma and pi electrons, and has its origins in work by William Lipscomb and Roald Hoffmann for nonplanar molecules in 1962.

==Poem about Schrödinger==
According to Felix Bloch, Erich Hückel &quot;incited and helped&quot; the students at the University of Zurich to write poems about their great professors. The poem about Erwin Schrödinger went like this:

Gar Manches rechnet Erwin schon
Mit seiner Wellenfunktion.
Nur wissen möcht&#x27; man gerne wohl
Was man sich dabei vorstell&#x27;n soll.

It was freely translated by Felix Bloch:

Erwin with his psi can do
Calculations quite a few.
But one thing has not been seen:
Just what does psi really mean?

<text>In Greek mythology, Peleus (; Ancient Greek: Πηλεύς &quot;Pēleus&quot;) was a hero, king of Phthia, husband of Thetis and the father of their son Achilles. This myth was already known to the hearers of Homer in the late 8th century BC.

== Biography ==
Peleus was the son of Aeacus, king of the island of Aegina, and Endeïs, the oread of Mount Pelion in Thessaly. He married the sea-nymph Thetis with whom he fathered Achilles.

Polymele, a daughter of Peleus, was one of the possible mothers of Patroclus by Menoetius.

Peleus and his brother Telamon were friends of Jason and both were counted as Argonauts. Though there were no further kings in Aegina, the kings of Epirus claimed descent from Peleus in the historic period.

==Mythology==
Peleus and his brother Telamon killed their half-brother Phocus, perhaps in a hunting accident and certainly in an unthinking moment, and fled Aegina to escape punishment. In Phthia, Peleus was purified by the city&#x27;s ruler, Eurytion, and then married the latter&#x27;s daughter, Antigone, by whom he had a daughter, Polydora. Eurytion received the barest mention among the Argonauts (both Peleus and Telamon were Argonauts themselves) &quot;yet not together, nor from one place, for they dwelt far apart and distant from Aigina&quot;; but Peleus accidentally killed Eurytion during the hunt for the Calydonian boar and fled from Phthia.

Peleus was purified of the murder of Eurytion in Iolcus by Acastus. Acastus&#x27; wife, Astydamia, fell in love with Peleus and after he scorned her, she sent a messenger to Antigone to tell her that Peleus was to marry Acastus&#x27; daughter. As a result, Antigone hanged herself.

Astydamia then told Acastus that Peleus had tried to rape her. Acastus took Peleus on a hunting trip atop Mount Pelion and once Peleus fell asleep, Acastus hid his sword away and abandoned him on the mountainside. Peleus woke up and as a group of centaurs was about to attack him, the wise centaur Chiron, or, according to another source, Hermes, returned his sword to him and Peleus managed to escape. He pillaged Iolcus and dismembered Astydamia, then marched his army between the rended limbs. Acastus and Astydamia were dead and the kingdom fell to Jason&#x27;s son, Thessalus.

===Marriage to Thetis===

After Antigone&#x27;s death, Peleus married the sea-nymph Thetis. He was able to win her over with the aid of Proteus, who instructed Peleus to hold onto her tightly through all of her physical transformations she used to try to escape. Their wedding feast was attended by many of the Olympian gods. As wedding presents, Poseidon gave Peleus two immortal horses: Balius and Xanthus, Hephaestus gave him a knife, Aphrodite a bowl with an embossed Eros, Hera a chlamys, Athena a flute, Nereus a basket of the divine salt which has an irresistible virtue for overeating, appetite and digestion and Zeus gave Thetis, as present, the wings of Arke.

During the feast, Eris, in revenge for not being invited, produced the Apple of Discord, which started the quarrel that led to the Judgement of Paris and eventually the Trojan War. The marriage of Peleus and Thetis produced seven sons, six of whom died in infancy. The only surviving son was Achilles.

===Rescue of Achilles===
Thetis attempted to render her son Achilles invulnerable. In the well-known version, she dipped him in the River Styx, holding him by one heel, which remained vulnerable. In an early and less popular version of the story, Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and she abandoned both father and son in a rage, leaving his heel vulnerable.

A nearly identical story is told by Plutarch, in his &quot;On Isis and Osiris&quot;, of the goddess Isis burning away the mortality of Prince Maneros of Byblos, son of Queen Astarte, and being likewise interrupted before completing the process. Later on in life, Achilles is killed by Paris when he is shot in his vulnerable spot, the heel. This is where the term &quot;Achilles&#x27; heel&quot; is derived from.

Peleus gave Achilles to the centaur Chiron, to raise on Mt. Pelion, which took its name from Peleus. In the &quot;Iliad&quot;, Achilles uses Peleus&#x27; immortal horses and also wields his father&#x27;s spear.

==In hero-cult==
Though the tomb of Aeacus remained in a shrine enclosure in the most conspicuous part of the port city, a quadrangular enclosure of white marble sculpted with bas-reliefs, in the form in which Pausanias saw it, with the tumulus of Phocus nearby, there was no &quot;temenos&quot; of Peleus at Aegina. Two versions of Peleus&#x27; fate account for this; in Euripides&#x27; &quot;Troades&quot;, Acastus, son of Pelias, has exiled him from Phthia; and subsequently he dies in exile; in another, he is reunited with Thetis and made immortal.

In antiquity, according to a fragment of Callimachus&#x27; lost &quot;Aitia&quot;, there was a tomb of Peleus in Ikos (modern Alonissos), an island of the northern Sporades; there Peleus was venerated as &quot;king of the Myrmidons&quot; and the &quot;return of the hero&quot; was celebrated annually. And there was his tomb, according to a poem in the Greek Anthology.

The only other reference to veneration of Peleus comes from the Christian Clement of Alexandria, in his polemical &quot;Exhortation to the Greeks&quot;. Clement attributes his source to a &quot;collection of marvels&quot; by a certain &quot;Monimos&quot; of whom nothing is known, and claims, in pursuit of his thesis that &quot;daimon&quot;-worshipers become as cruel as their gods, that in &quot;Pella of Thessaly human sacrifice is offered to Peleus and Cheiron, the victim being an Achaean&quot;. Of this, the continuing association of Peleus and Chiron is the most dependable detail.

==In Athenian tragedy==
A &quot;Peleus&quot; by Sophocles is lost. He appears as a character in Euripides&#x27; tragedy &quot;Andromache&quot; (c. 425 BC).

<text>Johns Hopkins University (often abbreviated as Johns Hopkins, Hopkins, or JHU) is a private research university in Baltimore, Maryland, United States. Founded in 1876, Johns Hopkins was the first American university based on the European research institution model. The university also has graduate campuses in Italy, China, and Washington, D.C. It is considered to be the first research university in the U.S. and has been the national leader in annual research and development spending since the late 20th century.

The university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur and Quaker philanthropist Johns Hopkins. Hopkins&#x27;s $7 million bequest (equivalent to $ in ) to establish the university was the largest philanthropic gift in U.S. history up to that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as Johns Hopkins&#x27;s first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. In 1900, Johns Hopkins became a founding member of the Association of American Universities. The university has led all U.S. universities in annual research and development expenditures for over four consecutive decades ($3.18 billion as of fiscal year 2021).

While its primary campus is in Baltimore, Johns Hopkins also maintains ten divisions on campuses in other Maryland locations, including Laurel, Rockville, Columbia, Aberdeen, California, Elkridge, and Owings Mills. The two undergraduate divisions, the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences and the Whiting School of Engineering are located on the Homewood campus in Baltimore&#x27;s Charles Village neighborhood. The medical school, nursing school, Bloomberg School of Public Health, and Johns Hopkins Children&#x27;s Center are located on the Medical Institutions campus in East Baltimore. The university also consists of the Peabody Institute, Applied Physics Laboratory, School of Advanced International Studies, School of Education, Carey Business School, and various other facilities.

Founded in 1883, the Blue Jays men&#x27;s lacrosse team, which is an affiliate member in the Big Ten Conference, has won 44 national titles. The university&#x27;s other sports teams compete in Division III of the NCAA, where they are members of the Centennial Conference.

==History==
===Philanthropic beginnings and foundation===

On his death in 1873, Johns Hopkins, a Quaker entrepreneur and childless bachelor, bequeathed $7 million (equivalent to $ in ) to fund a hospital and university in Baltimore.

At the time, this donation, generated primarily from the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States, and endowment was then the largest in America. Until 2020, Hopkins was assumed to be a fervent abolitionist, until research done by the school into his United States Census records revealed he claimed to own at least five household slaves in the 1840 and 1850 decennial censuses.

The first name of philanthropist Johns Hopkins comes from the surname of his great-grandmother, Margaret Johns, who married Gerard Hopkins. They named their son Johns Hopkins, who named his own son Samuel Hopkins. Samuel named one of his sons for his father, and that son became the university&#x27;s benefactor. Milton Eisenhower, a former university president, once spoke at a convention in Pittsburgh where the master of ceremonies introduced him as &quot;President of &quot;John&quot; Hopkins&quot;. Eisenhower retorted that he was &quot;glad to be here in &quot;Pitt&quot;burgh&quot;.

The original board opted for an entirely novel university model dedicated to the discovery of knowledge at an advanced level, extending that of contemporary Germany. Building on the Humboldtian model of higher education, the German education model of Wilhelm von Humboldt, it became dedicated to research. It was especially Heidelberg University and its long academic research history on which the new institution tried to model itself. Johns Hopkins thereby became the model of the modern research university in the United States. Its success eventually shifted higher education in the United States from a focus on teaching revealed and/or applied knowledge to the scientific discovery of new knowledge. 

===19th century===


The trustees worked alongside four notable university presidents, Charles William Eliot of Harvard University, Andrew D. White of Cornell University, Noah Porter of Yale College, and James B. Angell of University of Michigan. They each supported Daniel Coit Gilman to lead the new university and he became the university&#x27;s first president. Gilman, a Yale-educated scholar, had been serving as president of the University of California, Berkeley prior to this appointment. In preparation for the university&#x27;s founding, Daniel Coit Gilman visited University of Freiburg and other German universities.

Gilman launched what many at the time considered an audacious and unprecedented academic experiment to merge teaching and research. He dismissed the idea that the two were mutually exclusive: &quot;The best teachers are usually those who are free, competent and willing to make original researches in the library and the laboratory,&quot; he stated. To implement his plan, Gilman recruited internationally known researchers including the mathematician James Joseph Sylvester; the biologist H. Newell Martin; the physicist Henry Augustus Rowland, the first president of the American Physical Society, the classical scholars Basil Gildersleeve, and Charles D. Morris; the economist Richard T. Ely; and the chemist Ira Remsen, who became the second president of the university in 1901.

Gilman focused on the expansion of graduate education and support of faculty research. The new university fused advanced scholarship with such professional schools as medicine and engineering. Hopkins became the national trendsetter in doctoral programs and the host for numerous scholarly journals and associations. The Johns Hopkins University Press, founded in 1878, is the oldest American university press in continuous operation.

With the completion of Johns Hopkins Hospital in 1889 and the medical school in 1893, the university&#x27;s research-focused mode of instruction soon began attracting world-renowned faculty members who would become major figures in the emerging field of academic medicine, including William Osler, William Halsted, Howard Kelly, and William Welch. During this period the university further made history by becoming the first medical school to admit women on an equal basis with men and to require a Bachelor&#x27;s degree, based on the efforts of Mary E. Garrett, who had endowed the school at Gilman&#x27;s request. The school of medicine was America&#x27;s first coeducational, graduate-level medical school, and became a prototype for academic medicine that emphasized bedside learning, research projects, and laboratory training.

In his will and in his instructions to the trustees of the university and the hospital, Hopkins requested that both institutions be built upon the vast grounds of his Baltimore estate, Clifton. When Gilman assumed the presidency, he decided that it would be best to use the university&#x27;s endowment for recruiting faculty and students, deciding to, as it has been paraphrased, &quot;build men, not buildings.&quot; In his will Hopkins stipulated that none of his endowment should be used for construction; only interest on the principal could be used for this purpose. Unfortunately, stocks in The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, which would have generated most of the interest, became virtually worthless soon after Hopkins&#x27;s death. The university&#x27;s first home was thus in Downtown Baltimore, delaying plans to site the university in Clifton.

===20th century===

In the early 20th century, the university outgrew its buildings and the trustees began to search for a new home. Developing Clifton for the university was too costly, and of the estate had to be sold to the city as public park. A solution was achieved by a team of prominent locals who acquired the estate in north Baltimore known as the Homewood Estate. On February 22, 1902, this land was formally transferred to the university. The flagship building, Gilman Hall, was completed in 1915. The School of Engineering relocated in Fall of 1914 and the Zanvyl Krieger School of Arts and Sciences followed in 1916. These decades saw the ceding of lands by the university for the public Wyman Park and Wyman Park Dell and the Baltimore Museum of Art, coalescing in the contemporary area of .

Prior to becoming the main Johns Hopkins campus, the Homewood estate had initially been the gift of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, Maryland, a planter and signer of the Declaration of Independence, to his son Charles Carroll Jr. The original structure, the 1801 Homewood House, still stands and serves as an on-campus museum. The brick and marble Federal style of Homewood House became the architectural inspiration for much of the university campus versus the Collegiate Gothic style of other historic American universities.

In 1909, the university was among the first to start adult continuing education programs and in 1916 it founded the nation&#x27;s first school of public health.

Since the 1910s, Johns Hopkins University has famously been a &quot;fertile cradle&quot; to Arthur Lovejoy&#x27;s history of ideas.

Since 1942, the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) has served as a major governmental defense contractor. In tandem with on-campus research, Johns Hopkins has every year since 1979 had the highest federal research funding of any American university.

Professional schools of international affairs and music were established in 1950 and 1977, respectively, when the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington, D.C., and the Peabody Institute in Baltimore were incorporated into the university.

===21st century===

The early decades of the 21st century saw expansion across the university&#x27;s institutions in both physical and population sizes. Notably, a planned 88-acre expansion to the medical campus began in 2013. Completed construction on the Homewood campus has included a new biomedical engineering building in the Johns Hopkins University Department of Biomedical Engineering, a new library, a new biology wing, an extensive renovation of the flagship Gilman Hall, and the reconstruction of the main university entrance.

These years also brought about the rapid development of the university&#x27;s professional schools of education and business. From 1999 until 2007, these disciplines had been joined within the School of Professional Studies in Business and Education (SPSBE), itself a reshuffling of several earlier ventures. The 2007 split, combined with new funding and leadership initiatives, has led to the simultaneous emergence of the Johns Hopkins School of Education and the Carey Business School.On November 18, 2018, it was announced that Michael Bloomberg would make a donation to his alma mater of $1.8 billion, marking the largest private donation in modern history to an institution of higher education and bringing Bloomberg&#x27;s total contribution to the school in excess of $3.3 billion. Bloomberg&#x27;s $1.8 billion gift allows the school to practice need-blind admission and meet the full financial need of admitted students.

In January 2019, the university announced an agreement to purchase the Newseum, located at 555 Pennsylvania Ave. NW, in the heart of Washington, D.C., with plans to locate all of its Washington, D.C.–based graduate programs there. In an interview with &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, the president of Johns Hopkins stated that, &quot;the purchase is an opportunity to position the university, literally, to better contribute its expertise to national- and international-policy discussions.&quot;

In late 2019, the university&#x27;s Coronavirus Research Center began tracking worldwide cases of the COVID-19 pandemic by compiling data from hundreds of sources around the world. This led to the university becoming one of the most cited sources for data about the pandemic.

==== Establishment of the Johns Hopkins Police Department ====
In February 2019, Johns Hopkins University requested permission from the Maryland General Assembly to create a private police force to patrol in and around the three Baltimore campuses, a move that was immediately opposed by several neighboring communities, 75% of Johns Hopkins undergraduate students, and at least 90 professors who signed on to an open letter opposing the plan. In early March, it was revealed that &quot;on January 9, 2019, nine senior administrators and one retired hospital CEO...contributed a total of $16,000&quot; to then Baltimore Mayor Catherine Pugh&#x27;s re-election campaign, shortly after which a bill to institute a Johns Hopkins private police force was introduced into the Maryland General Assembly at &quot;request [of] Baltimore City Administration.&quot; On April 8, 2019, the Homewood Faculty Assembly unanimously passed a resolution requesting that the administration refrain from taking any further steps &quot;toward the establishment of a private police force&quot; until it could provide responses to several questions concerning accountability and oversight of the proposed police department, fears of Black faculty that the police department would target people of color, and alleged corruption involving Mayor Pugh. The Community Safety and Strengthening Act passed the Maryland General Assembly and was signed into law in April 2019, granting Johns Hopkins University permission to establish a private police department. In response to perceived corruption, a group of protestors staged a sit-in of Garland Hall, the building housing the office of university president Ronald J. Daniels. After a month-long sit-in, the protestors &quot;took over the building – locking its doors with chains.&quot; They held the building for a week until May 8, 2019, when &quot;[a]t 5:50 a.m., at the request of Johns Hopkins University,&quot; Baltimore police surrounded the building and arrested &quot;three community members, one undergraduate and one graduate student&quot; who were occupying the building.

In the wake of the May 2020 killing of George Floyd and the subsequent protests, a group of Hopkins faculty along with 2,500 Hopkins staff, students, and community members signed a petition calling on president Daniels to reconsider the planned police department. The office of public safety issued a statement on June 10 saying &quot;the JHPD does not yet exist. We committed to establishing this department through a slow, careful and fully open process. No other steps are planned at this time, and we will be in close communication with the city and our university community before any further steps are taken&quot;. Two days later, president Daniels announced the decision to &quot;pause for at least the next two years the implementation of the JHPD.&quot; Despite this announcement, the next summer Johns Hopkins announced the appointment of Dr. Branville Bard Jr. to the newly created position of vice president for public safety.

The Community Safety and Strengthening Act requires the university to establish a civilian accountability board as well as a Memorandum Of Understanding (MOU) with the Baltimore Police Department. A draft MOU was made public on September 19, 2022 in advance of three scheduled town halls and a 30-day period to solicit feedback from the community. A message posted the same day as the draft MOU said that the document &quot;will be modified to reflect what we hear and learn from our community.&quot; However, community members remained skeptical that the university is operating in good faith. A September 2022 article from Inside Higher Ed portrays the sentiment from the community, quoting a Johns Hopkins physician and professor who said &quot;Hopkins engineers very closed and stage-managed town halls and does not execute any changes based on these town halls.&quot; The Baltimore Sun reported that the Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins planned to continue to obstruct the formation of JHPD, but that it must resort to &quot;shutting down more university events,&quot; referring to the 2019 Garland Hall sit-in. The group proceeded to shut down the first town hall. According to reporting by the Baltimore Sun, the event &quot;was moved to an online-only format after a crowd of chanting protesters took over the meeting stage.&quot; The MOU finalized on December 2, 2022, grants the JHPD primary jurisdiction over areas &quot;owned, leased, or operated by, or under the control of&quot; JHU as well as adjacent public property. Despite continued protest from university faculty calling for more oversight and clearly defined jurisdictional boundaries in accordance with the law, officer recruitment and training began in spring of 2024, with officers starting active duty in the summer of 2024.

===Civil rights===

====African-Americans====
Hopkins was a prominent abolitionist who supported Abraham Lincoln during the American Civil War. After his death, reports said his conviction was a decisive factor in enrolling Hopkins&#x27;s first African-American student, Kelly Miller, a graduate student in physics, astronomy and mathematics. As time passed, the university adopted a &quot;separate but equal&quot; stance more like other Baltimore institutions.

The first black undergraduate entered the school in 1945 and graduate students followed in 1967. James Nabwangu, a British-trained Kenyan, was the first black graduate of the medical school. African-American instructor and laboratory supervisor Vivien Thomas was instrumental in developing and conducting the first successful blue baby operation in 1944. Despite such cases, racial diversity did not become commonplace at Johns Hopkins institutions until the 1960s and 1970s.

====Women====
Hopkins&#x27;s most well-known battle for women&#x27;s rights was the one led by daughters of trustees of the university; Mary E. Garrett, M. Carey Thomas, Mamie Gwinn, Elizabeth King, and Julia Rogers. They donated and raised the funds needed to open the medical school, and required Hopkins&#x27;s officials to agree to their stipulation that women would be admitted. The nursing school opened in 1889 and accepted women and men as students. Other graduate schools were later opened to women by president Ira Remsen in 1907. Christine Ladd-Franklin was the first woman to earn a PhD at Hopkins, in mathematics in 1882. The trustees denied her the degree for decades and refused to change the policy about admitting women. In 1893, Florence Bascomb became the university&#x27;s first female PhD. The decision to admit women at undergraduate level was not considered until the late 1960s and was eventually adopted in October 1969. As of 2009–2010, the undergraduate population was 47% female and 53% male. In 2020, the undergraduate population of Hopkins was 53% female.

====Freedom of speech====
On September 5, 2013, cryptographer and Johns Hopkins university professor Matthew Green posted a blog entitled, &quot;On the NSA&quot;, in which he contributed to the ongoing debate regarding the role of NIST and NSA in formulating U.S. cryptography standards. On September 9, 2013, Green received a take-down request for the &quot;On the NSA&quot; blog from interim Dean Andrew Douglas from the Johns Hopkins University Whiting School of Engineering. The request cited concerns that the blog had links to sensitive material. The blog linked to already published news articles from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and ProPublica.org. Douglas subsequently issued a personal on-line apology to Green. The event raised concern over the future of academic freedom of speech within the cryptologic research community.

==Campuses==
===Homewood===
* School of Education: Originally established in 1909 as The School of Professional Studies in Business and Education, the divisions of Education and Business became separate schools in 2007.

The first campus was located on Howard Street. Eventually, they relocated to Homewood, in northern Baltimore, the estate of Charles Carroll, son of the oldest surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. Carroll&#x27;s Homewood House is considered one of the finest examples of Federal residential architecture. The estate then came to the Wyman family, which participated in making it the park-like main campus of the schools of arts and sciences and engineering at the start of the 20th century. Most of its architecture was modeled after the Federal style of Homewood House. Homewood House is preserved as a museum. Most undergraduate programs are on this campus.

===East Baltimore===

Collectively known as Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions (JHMI) campus, the East Baltimore facility occupies several city blocks spreading from the Johns Hopkins Hospital trademark dome.
* Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health: The Bloomberg School was founded in 1916 and is the world&#x27;s oldest and largest school of public health. It has consistently been ranked first in its field by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

==Organization==
The Johns Hopkins entity is structured as two corporations, the university and The Johns Hopkins Health System, formed in 1986. The president is JHU&#x27;s chief executive officer and the university is organized into nine academic divisions.

JHU&#x27;s bylaws specify a board of trustees of between 18 and 65 voting members. Trustees serve six-year terms subject to a two-term limit. The alumni select 12 trustees. Four recent alumni serve 4-year terms, one per year, typically from the graduating class. The bylaws prohibit students, faculty or administrative staff from serving on the board, except the president as an ex-officio trustee. The Johns Hopkins Health System has a separate board of trustees, many of whom are doctors or health care executives.

==Presidents==
==Academics==
The full-time, four-year undergraduate program is &quot;most selective&quot; with low transfer-in and a high graduate co-existence. The Princeton Review rates the selectivity of Johns Hopkins as 99/99. The cost of attendance per year is approximately $77,400. However, 51% of full-time undergraduates receive financial aid covering 100% of their need. The admit rate of Hopkins undergraduates to medical school is 80% and to law school is 97%, some of the highest rates in the US. The university is one of fourteen founding members of the Association of American Universities (AAU); it is also a member of the Consortium on Financing Higher Education (COFHE) and the Universities Research Association (URA).

===Rankings===
As of 2024–25, Johns Hopkins University is ranked the 6th best university in the nation (tied) and 13th best globally by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.
===Undergraduate admissions===

The university&#x27;s undergraduate programs are highly selective: in 2021, the Office of Admissions accepted about 4.9% of its 33,236 Regular Decision applicants and about 6.4% of its total 38,725 applicants. In 2022, 99% of admitted students graduated in the top 10% of their high school class. Over time, applications to Johns Hopkins University have risen steadily; as a result, the selectivity of Johns Hopkins University has also increased. Early Decision I is an option at Johns Hopkins University for students who wish to demonstrate that the university is their first choice. These students, if admitted, are required to enroll. This application is due November 1. There is also another binding Early Decision II application due January 3. Many students, however, apply Regular Decision, which is a traditional non-binding round. These applications are due January 3 and students are notified in mid-March. The cost to apply to Hopkins is $70, though fee waivers are available. In 2014, Johns Hopkins ended legacy preference in admissions. Johns Hopkins practices need-blind admission and meets the full financial need of all admitted students.

===Libraries===
The Johns Hopkins University Library system houses more than 3.6 million volumes and includes ten main divisions across the university&#x27;s campuses. The largest segment of this system is the Sheridan Libraries, encompassing the Milton S. Eisenhower Library (the main library of the Homewood campus), the Brody Learning Commons, the Hutzler Reading Room (&quot;The Hut&quot;) in Gilman Hall, the John Work Garrett Library at Evergreen House, and the George Peabody Library at the Peabody Institute campus.

The main library, constructed in the 1960s, was named for Milton S. Eisenhower, former president of the university and brother of former U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower. The university&#x27;s stacks had previously been housed in Gilman Hall and departmental libraries. Only two of the Eisenhower library&#x27;s six stories are above ground, though the building was designed so that every level receives natural light. The design accords with campus lore that no structure can be taller than Gilman Hall, the flagship academic building. A four-story expansion to the library, known as the Brody Learning Commons, opened in August 2012. The expansion features an energy-efficient, state-of-the-art technology infrastructure and includes study spaces, seminar rooms, and a rare books collection.

===Johns Hopkins University Press===

The Johns Hopkins University Press is the publishing division of the Johns Hopkins University. It was founded in 1878 and holds the distinction of being the oldest continuously running university press in the United States. To date the Press has published more than 6,000 titles and currently publishes 65 scholarly periodicals and over 200 new books each year. Since 1993, the Johns Hopkins University Press has run Project MUSE, an online collection of over 250 full-text, peer-reviewed journals in the humanities and social sciences. The Press also houses the Hopkins Fulfilment Services (HFS), which handles distribution for a number of university presses and publishers. Taken together, the three divisions of the Press—Books, Journals (including MUSE) and HFS—make it one of the largest of America&#x27;s university presses.

=== Center for Talented Youth ===

The Johns Hopkins University also offers the Center for Talented Youth program, a nonprofit organization dedicated to identifying and developing the talents of the most promising K-12 grade students worldwide. As part of the Johns Hopkins University, the &quot;Center for Talented Youth&quot; or CTY helps fulfill the university&#x27;s mission of preparing students to make significant future contributions to the world. The Johns Hopkins Digital Media Center (DMC) is a multimedia lab space as well as an equipment, technology and knowledge resource for students interested in exploring creative uses of emerging media and use of technology.

=== Degrees offered ===
Johns Hopkins offers a number of degrees in various undergraduate majors leading to the BA and BS and various majors leading to the MA, MS and PhD for graduate students. Because Hopkins offers both undergraduate and graduate areas of study, many disciplines have multiple degrees available. Biomedical engineering, perhaps one of Hopkins&#x27;s best-known programs, offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees.

==Research==
The opportunity to participate in important research is one of the distinguishing characteristics of Hopkins&#x27;s undergraduate education. About 80 percent of undergraduates perform independent research, often alongside top researchers. In fiscal year 2020, Johns Hopkins spent nearly $3.1 billion on research, more than any other U.S. university for over 40 consecutive years. Johns Hopkins has had seventy-seven members of the Institute of Medicine, forty-three Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigators, seventeen members of the National Academy of Engineering, and sixty-two members of the National Academy of Sciences. As of October 2019, 39 Nobel Prize winners have been affiliated with the university as alumni, faculty members or researchers, with the most recent winners being Gregg Semenza and William G. Kaelin.

Between 1999 and 2009, Johns Hopkins was among the most cited institutions in the world. It attracted nearly 1,222,166 citations and produced 54,022 papers under its name, ranking third globally after Harvard University and the Max Planck Society in the number of &quot;total&quot; citations published in Thomson Reuters-indexed journals over 22 fields in America. In 2020, Johns Hopkins University ranked 5 in number of utility patents granted out of all institutions in the world.

In 2000, Johns Hopkins received $95.4 million in research grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), making it the leading recipient of NASA research and development funding. In FY 2002, Hopkins became the first university to cross the $1 billion threshold on either list, recording $1.14 billion in total research and $1.023 billion in federally sponsored research. In FY 2008, Johns Hopkins University performed $1.68 billion in science, medical and engineering research, making it the leading U.S. academic institution in total R&amp;D spending for the 30th year in a row, according to a National Science Foundation (NSF) ranking. These totals include grants and expenditures of JHU&#x27;s Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland.

In 2013, the Bloomberg Distinguished Professorships program was established by a $250 million gift from Michael Bloomberg. This program enables the university to recruit fifty researchers from around the world to joint appointments throughout the nine divisions and research centers. Each professor must be a leader in interdisciplinary research and be active in undergraduate education. Directed by Vice Provost for Research Denis Wirtz, there are currently thirty two Bloomberg Distinguished Professors at the university, including three Nobel Laureates, eight fellows of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, ten members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and thirteen members of the National Academies.

==Student life==
Charles Village, the region of North Baltimore surrounding the university, has undergone several restoration projects, and the university has gradually bought the property around the school for additional student housing and dormitories. &quot;The Charles Village Project&quot;, completed in 2008, brought new commercial spaces to the neighborhood. The project included Charles (now Scott-Bates) Commons, a new, modern residence hall that includes popular retail franchises. In 2015, the university began development of new commercial properties, including a modern upperclassmen apartment complex, restaurants and eateries, and a CVS retail store.

Hopkins invested in improving campus life with an arts complex in 2001, the Mattin Center, and a three-story sports facility, the O&#x27;Connor Recreation Center. The large on-campus dining facilities at Homewood were renovated in the summer of 2006. The Mattin Center was demolished in 2021 to make room for the new Student Center scheduled to open in the fall of 2024.

Quality of life is enriched by the proximity of neighboring academic institutions, including Loyola College, Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA), UMBC, Goucher College, and Towson University, as well as the nearby neighborhoods of Hampden, the Inner Harbor, Fells Point, and Mount Vernon.

Students and alumni are active on and off campus. Johns Hopkins has been home to several secret societies, many of which are now defunct. Blue Jay Supper Society is the only active secret society with open applications. Membership is open to undergraduate and graduate students as well as alumni.

===Student organizations===

=== Fraternity and sorority life ===
Fraternity and sorority life came to Hopkins in 1876 with the chartering of Beta Theta Pi fraternity, which still exists on campus today. Since, Johns Hopkins has become home to nine sororities and 11 fraternities. Of the nine sororities, five belong to the National Panhellenic Conference and four to the Multicultural Greek Council Sororities. Of the fraternities, all 11 belong to the Inter-Fraternity Council. Over 1,000 students participate in Fraternity and Sorority Life, with 23% of women and 20% of men taking part. Fraternity and Sorority Life has expanded its reach at Hopkins in recent decades, as only 15% of the student body participated in 1989. Alpha Phi Alpha, a historically black fraternity, was founded in 1991, Lambda Phi Epsilon, an Asian-interest fraternity, was founded in 1994, and Lambda Upsilon Lambda, a Latino-interest fraternity, was founded in 1995. Rush for all students occurs in the spring. Most fraternities keep houses in Charles Village while sororities do not.

=== Spring Fair ===
The Spring Fair has been a Johns Hopkins tradition since 1972 and has since grown to be the largest student-run festival in the country. Popular among Hopkins students and Baltimore inhabitants alike, the Spring Fair features carnival rides, vendors, food and a beer garden. Since its beginning, Spring the fair has decreased in size, both in regard to attendance and utilization of space. While one point, the fair attracted upwards of 100,000 people, it became unruly and, for a variety of reasons including safety concerns and a campus beautification project in the early 2000s, had to be scaled back.

=== Traditions ===
While it has been speculated that Johns Hopkins has relatively few traditions for a school of its age and that many past traditions have been forgotten, a handful of myths and customs are ubiquitous knowledge among the community. One such long-standing myth surrounds the university seal that is embedded into the floor of the Gilman Hall foyer. The myth holds that any current student to step on the seal will never graduate. In reverence for this tradition, the seal has been fenced off from the rest of the room.

An annual event is the &quot;Lighting of the Quads&quot;, a ceremony each winter during which the campus is lit up in holiday lights. Recent years have included singing and fireworks.

===Housing===

Living on campus is typically required for first- and second-year undergraduates. Freshman housing is centered around Freshman Quad, which consists of three residence hall complexes: The two Alumni Memorial Residences (AMR I and AMR II) plus Buildings A and B. The AMR dormitories are each divided into &quot;houses&quot;, subunits named for figures from the university&#x27;s early history. Freshmen are also housed in Wolman Hall and in certain wings of McCoy Hall, both located slightly outside the campus. Dorms at Hopkins are generally co-ed with same-gender rooms, though a new policy has allowed students to live in mixed-gender rooms since Fall 2014.

Students determine where they will live during sophomore year through a housing lottery. Most juniors and seniors move into nearby apartments or row-houses. Non-freshmen in university housing occupy one of four buildings: McCoy Hall, the Bradford Apartments, the Homewood Apartments, and Scott-Bates Commons. All are located in Charles Village within a block from the Homewood campus. Forty-five percent of the student body lives off-campus while 55% lives on campus.

==Athletics==

The university&#x27;s athletic teams are the Johns Hopkins Blue Jays. Even though sable and gold are used for academic robes, the university&#x27;s athletic colors are spirit blue (PMS 284) and black. Hopkins celebrates Homecoming in the spring to coincide with the height of the lacrosse season. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lacrosse teams are in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I and are affiliate members of the Big Ten Conference. Other teams are in Division III and participate in the Centennial Conference. JHU is also home to the Lacrosse Museum and National Hall of Fame, maintained by US Lacrosse.

<text>Plotinus (; , &quot;Plōtînos&quot;;  – 270 CE) was a Greek Platonist philosopher, born and raised in Roman Egypt. Plotinus is regarded by modern scholarship as the founder of Neoplatonism. His teacher was the self-taught philosopher Ammonius Saccas, who belonged to the Platonic tradition. Historians of the 19th century invented the term &quot;neoplatonism&quot; and applied it to refer to Plotinus and his philosophy, which was vastly influential during late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance. Much of the biographical information about Plotinus comes from Porphyry&#x27;s preface to his edition of Plotinus&#x27; most notable literary work, &quot;The Enneads&quot;. In his metaphysical writings, Plotinus described three fundamental principles: the One, the Intellect, and the . His works have inspired centuries of pagan, Jewish, Christian, Gnostic, and early Islamic metaphysicians and mystics, including developing precepts that influence mainstream theological concepts within religions, such as his work on duality of the One in two metaphysical states.

== Biography ==
Porphyry reported that Plotinus was sixty-six years old when he died in 270 CE, the second year of the reign of the Roman Emperor Claudius II, thus giving us the year of his birth as around 204. Eunapius reported that Plotinus was born in Lyco, which could either refer to the modern Asyut in Upper Egypt or Deltaic Lycopolis, in Lower Egypt. This has led to speculations that his family was either (Hellenized) Egyptian, Greek, or Roman. Historian Lloyd P. Gerson states that Plotinus was &quot;almost certainly&quot; a Greek. A.H. Armstrong, one of the foremost authorities on the philosophical teachings of Plotinus, writes that: &quot;All that can be said with reasonable certainty is that Greek was his normal language and that he had a Greek education&quot;. Plotinus himself was said to have had little interest in his ancestry, birthplace, or that of anyone else for that matter. His native language was Greek.

Plotinus had an inherent distrust of materiality (an attitude common to Platonism), holding to the view that phenomena were a poor image or mimicry (&quot;mimesis&quot;) of something &quot;higher and intelligible&quot; (VI.I) which was the &quot;truer part of genuine Being&quot;. This distrust extended to the body, including his own; it is reported by Porphyry that at one point he refused to have his portrait painted, presumably for much the same reasons of dislike. Likewise, Plotinus never discussed his ancestry, childhood, or his place or date of birth. From all accounts his personal and social life exhibited the highest moral and spiritual standards.

Plotinus took up the study of philosophy at the age of twenty-eight, around the year 232 and travelled to Alexandria to study. There he was dissatisfied with every teacher he encountered, until an acquaintance suggested he listen to the ideas of the self-taught Platonist philosopher Ammonius Saccas. Upon hearing Ammonius&#x27; lecture, Plotinus declared to his friend: &quot;this is the man I was looking for&quot;, began to study intently under his new instructor, and remained with him as his student for eleven years. Besides Ammonius, Plotinus was also influenced by the philosophical works of Aristotle, the pre-Socratic philosophers Empedocles and Heraclitus, the Middle Platonist philosophers Alexander of Aphrodisias and Numenius of Apamea, along with various Stoics and Neopythagoreans.

=== Expedition to Persia and return to Rome ===
After having spent eleven years in Alexandria, he then decided, at the age of around thirty-eight, to investigate the philosophical teachings of the Persian and Indian philosophers. In the pursuit of this endeavor he left Alexandria and joined the army of the Roman emperor Gordian III as it marched on Persia (242–243). However, the campaign was a failure, and on Gordian&#x27;s eventual death Plotinus found himself abandoned in a hostile land, and only with difficulty found his way back to safety in Antioch.

At the age of forty, during the reign of Emperor Philip the Arab, he came to Rome, where he stayed for most of the remainder of his life. There he attracted a number of students. His innermost circle included Porphyry, Amelius Gentilianus of Tuscany, the Senator Castricius Firmus, and Eustochius of Alexandria, a doctor who devoted himself to learning from Plotinus and attending to him until his death. Other students included: Zethos, an Arab by ancestry who died before Plotinus, leaving him a legacy and some land; Zoticus, a critic and poet; Paulinus, a doctor of Scythopolis; and Serapion from Alexandria. He had students amongst the Roman Senate beside Castricius, such as Marcellus Orontius, Sabinillus, and Rogantianus. Women were also numbered amongst his students, including Gemina, in whose house he lived during his residence in Rome, and her daughter, also Gemina; and Amphiclea, the wife of Ariston, the son of Iamblichus. Finally, Plotinus was a correspondent of the philosopher Cassius Longinus.

=== Later life ===
While in Rome, Plotinus also gained the respect of the Emperor Gallienus and his wife Salonina. At one point Plotinus attempted to interest Gallienus in rebuilding an abandoned settlement in Campania, known as the &#x27;City of Philosophers&#x27;, where the inhabitants would live under the constitution set out in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws&quot;. An Imperial subsidy was never granted, for reasons unknown to Porphyry, who reports the incident.

Plotinus subsequently went to live in Sicily. He spent his final days in seclusion on an estate in Campania which his friend Zethos had bequeathed him. According to the account of Eustochius, who attended him at the end, Plotinus&#x27; final words were: &quot;Try to raise the divine in yourselves to the divine in the all.&quot; Eustochius records that a snake crept under the bed where Plotinus lay, and slipped away through a hole in the wall; at the same moment the philosopher died.

Plotinus wrote the essays that became the &quot;Enneads&quot; (from Greek ἐννέα (&quot;ennéa&quot;), or group of nine) over a period of several years from c. 253 until a few months before his death seventeen years later. Porphyry makes note that the &quot;Enneads&quot;, before being compiled and arranged by himself, were merely the enormous collection of notes and essays which Plotinus used in his lectures and debates, rather than a formal book. Plotinus was unable to revise his own work due to his poor eyesight, yet his writings required extensive editing, according to Porphyry: his master&#x27;s handwriting was atrocious, he did not properly separate his words, and he cared little for niceties of spelling. Plotinus intensely disliked the editorial process, and turned the task to Porphyry, who polished and edited them into their modern form.

== Major ideas ==

=== The One ===

Plotinus taught that there is a supreme, totally transcendent &quot;One&quot;, containing no division, multiplicity, or distinction; beyond all categories of being and non-being. His &quot;One&quot; &quot;cannot be any existing thing&quot;, nor is it merely the sum of all things (compare the Stoic doctrine of disbelief in non-material existence), but &quot;is prior to all existents&quot;. Plotinus identified his &quot;One&quot; with the concept of &#x27;Good&#x27; and the principle of &#x27;Beauty&#x27;. (I.6.9)

His &quot;One&quot; concept encompassed thinker and object. Even the self-contemplating intelligence (the of the nous) must contain duality. &quot;Once you have uttered &#x27;The Good,&#x27; add no further thought: by any addition, and in proportion to that addition, you introduce a deficiency.&quot; (III.8.11) Plotinus denies sentience, self-awareness or any other action (&quot;ergon&quot;) to the One (τὸ Ἕν, &quot;to hen&quot;; V.6.6). Rather, if we insist on describing it further, we must call the One a sheer potentiality (&quot;dynamis&quot;) without which nothing could exist. (III.8.10) As Plotinus explains in both places and elsewhere (e.g. V.6.3), it is impossible for the One to be Being or a self-aware Creator God. At (V.6.4), Plotinus compared the One to &quot;light&quot;, the Divine Intellect/Nous (Νοῦς, &quot;Nous&quot;; first will towards Good) to the &quot;Sun&quot;, and lastly the Soul (Ψυχή, &quot;Psyche&quot;) to the &quot;Moon&quot; whose light is merely a &quot;derivative conglomeration of light from the &#x27;Sun&#x27;&quot;. The first light could exist without any celestial body.

The One, being beyond all attributes including being and non-being, is the source of the world—but not through any act of creation, since activity cannot be ascribed to the unchangeable, immutable One. Plotinus argues instead that the multiple cannot exist without the simple. The &quot;less perfect&quot; must, of necessity, &quot;emanate&quot;, or issue forth, from the &quot;perfect&quot; or &quot;more perfect&quot;. Thus, all of &quot;creation&quot; emanates from the One in succeeding stages of lesser and lesser perfection. These stages are not temporally isolated, but occur throughout time as a constant process.

The One is not just an intellectual concept but something that can be experienced, an experience where one goes beyond all multiplicity. Plotinus writes, &quot;We ought not even to say that he will &quot;see&quot;, but he will &quot;be&quot; that which he sees, if indeed it is possible any longer to distinguish between seer and seen, and not boldly to affirm that the two are one.&quot;

=== Emanation by the One ===
Although Plotinus never mentions Christianity in any of his works, he seems to offer an alternative to the orthodox Christian notion of creation &quot;ex nihilo&quot; (out of nothing), though this is disputed. The metaphysics of emanation (ἀπορροή &quot;aporrhoe&quot; (ΙΙ.3.2) or ἀπόρροια &quot;aporrhoia&quot; (II.3.11)) (literally a flowing, ροη, out, απο), similar to the metaphysics of Creation, describes the absolute transcendence of the One or of the Divine, as the source of the Being of all things, but which remains transcendent of them in its own nature. The One is in no way affected or diminished by these emanations, just as the Christian God in no way is augmented or diminished by the act of Creation. Plotinus, using a venerable analogy that would become crucial for the (largely neoplatonic) metaphysics of developed Christian thought, likens the One to the Sun which emanates light indiscriminately without thereby diminishing itself, or reflection in a mirror which in no way diminishes or otherwise alters the object being reflected.

The first emanation is &quot;Nous&quot; (Divine Mind, &quot;Logos&quot;, Order, Thought, Reason), identified metaphorically with the Demiurge in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Timaeus&quot;. It is the first Will toward Good. From &quot;Nous&quot; proceeds the World Soul, which Plotinus subdivides into upper and lower, identifying the lower aspect of Soul with nature. From the world soul proceeds individual human souls, and finally, matter, at the lowest level of being and thus the least perfected level of the cosmos. Plotinus asserted the ultimately divine nature of material creation since it ultimately derives from the One, through the mediums of &quot;Nous&quot; and the world soul. It is by the Good or through beauty that we recognize the One, in material things and then in the Forms. (I.6.6 and I.6.9)

The essentially devotional nature of Plotinus&#x27; philosophy may be further illustrated by his concept of attaining ecstatic union with the One (&quot;henosis&quot;). Porphyry relates that Plotinus attained such a union four times during the years he knew him. This may be related to enlightenment, liberation, and other concepts of mysticism common to many Eastern traditions.

=== The true human and happiness ===
Authentic human happiness for Plotinus consists of the true human identifying with that which is the best in the universe. Because happiness is beyond anything physical, Plotinus stresses the point that worldly fortune does not control true human happiness, and thus “… there exists no single human being that does not either potentially or effectively possess this thing we hold to constitute happiness.” (Enneads I.4.4) The issue of happiness is one of Plotinus’ greatest imprints on Western thought, as he is one of the first to introduce the idea that eudaimonia (happiness) is attainable only within consciousness.

The true human is an incorporeal contemplative capacity of the soul, and superior to all things corporeal. It then follows that real human happiness is independent of the physical world. Real happiness is, instead, dependent on the metaphysical and authentic human being found in this highest capacity of Reason. “For man, and especially the Proficient, is not the Couplement of Soul and body: the proof is that man can be disengaged from the body and disdain its nominal goods.” (Enneads I.4.14) The human who has achieved happiness will not be bothered by sickness, discomfort, etc., as his focus is on the greatest things. Authentic human happiness is the utilization of the most authentically human capacity of contemplation. Even in daily, physical action, the flourishing human’s “… Act is determined by the higher phase of the Soul.” (Enneads III.4.6) Even in the most dramatic arguments Plotinus considers (if the Proficient is subject to extreme physical torture, for example), he concludes this only strengthens his claim of true happiness being metaphysical, as the truly happy human being would understand that which is being tortured is merely a body, not the conscious self, and happiness could persist.

Plotinus offers a comprehensive description of his conception of a person who has achieved eudaimonia. “The perfect life” involves a man who commands reason and contemplation. (Enneads I.4.4) A happy person will not sway between happy and sad, as many of Plotinus&#x27; contemporaries believed. Stoics, for example, question the ability of someone to be happy (presupposing happiness is contemplation) if they are mentally incapacitated or even asleep. Plotinus disregards this claim, as the soul and true human do not sleep or even exist in time, nor will a living human who has achieved eudaimonia suddenly stop using its greatest, most authentic capacity just because of the body’s discomfort in the physical realm. “… The Proficient’s will is set always and only inward.” (Enneads I.4.11)

Overall, happiness for Plotinus is &quot;... a flight from this world&#x27;s ways and things.&quot; (Theaet. 176) and a focus on the highest, i.e. Forms and the One.

Plotinus regarded happiness as living in an interior way (interiority or self-sufficiency), and this being the obverse of attachment to the objects of embodied desires.

===Henosis===
Henosis is the word for mystical &quot;oneness&quot;, &quot;union&quot;, or &quot;unity&quot; in classical Greek. In Platonism, and especially neoplatonism, the goal of henosis is union with what is fundamental in reality: the One (), the Source, or Monad.

As is specified in the writings of Plotinus on henology, one can reach a state of tabula rasa, blank state where the individual may grasp or merge with The One. This absolute simplicity means that the nous or the person is then dissolved, completely absorbed back into the Monad. Here within the &quot;Enneads&quot; of Plotinus the Monad can be referred to as the Good above the demiurge. The Monad or dunamis (force) is of one singular expression (the will or the one which is the good); all is contained in the Monad and the Monad is all (pantheism). All division is reconciled in the one; the final stage before reaching singularity, called duality (dyad), is completely reconciled in the Monad, Source or One (see monism). As the one source or substance of all things, the Monad is all encompassing. As infinite and indeterminate all is reconciled in the dunamis or one. It is the demiurge or second emanation that is the nous in Plotinus. It is the demiurge (creator, action, energy) or nous that &quot;perceives&quot; and therefore causes the force (potential or One) to manifest as energy, or the dyad called the material world. Nous as being; being and perception (intellect) manifest what is called soul (World Soul).

Henosis for Plotinus was defined in his works as a reversing of the ontological process of consciousness via meditation (in the Western mind to uncontemplate) toward no thought (Nous or demiurge) and no division (dyad) within the individual (being). Plotinus words his teachings to reconcile not only Plato with Aristotle but also various World religions that he had personal contact with during his various travels. Plotinus&#x27; works have an ascetic character in that they reject matter as an illusion (non-existent). Matter was strictly treated as immanent, with matter as essential to its being, having no true or transcendential character or essence, substance or ousia (οὐσία). This approach is called philosophical Idealism.

==Relation with contemporary philosophy and religion==

=== Plotinus&#x27;s Relation to Plato ===
For several centuries after the Protestant Reformation, neoplatonism was condemned as a decadent and &#x27;oriental&#x27; distortion of Platonism. In a 1929 essay, E. R. Dodds showed that key conceptions of neoplatonism could be traced from their origin in Plato&#x27;s dialogues, through his immediate followers (e.g., Speusippus) and the neopythagoreans, to Plotinus and the neoplatonists. Thus Plotinus&#x27; philosophy was, he argued, &#x27;not the starting-point of neoplatonism but its intellectual culmination.&#x27; Further research reinforced this view and by 1954 Merlan could say &#x27;The present tendency is toward bridging rather than widening the gap separating Platonism from neoplatonism.&#x27;

Since the 1950s, the Tübingen School of Plato interpretation has argued that the so-called &#x27;unwritten doctrines&#x27; of Plato debated by Aristotle and the Old Academy strongly resemble Plotinus&#x27;s metaphysics. In this case, the neoplatonic reading of Plato would be, at least in this central area, historically justified. This implies that neoplatonism is less of an innovation than it appears without the recognition of Plato&#x27;s unwritten doctrines. Advocates of the Tübingen School emphasize this advantage of their interpretation. They see Plotinus as advancing a tradition of thought begun by Plato himself. Plotinus&#x27;s metaphysics, at least in broad outline, was therefore already familiar to the first generation of Plato&#x27;s students. This confirms Plotinus&#x27; own view, for he considered himself not the inventor of a system but the faithful interpreter of Plato&#x27;s doctrines.

=== Plotinus and the Gnostics ===

At least two modern conferences within Hellenic philosophy fields of study have been held in order to address what Plotinus stated in his tract &quot;Against the Gnostics&quot; and to whom he was addressing it, in order to separate and clarify the events and persons involved in the origin of the term &quot;Gnostic&quot;. From the dialogue, it appears that the word had an origin in the Platonic and Hellenistic tradition long before the group calling themselves &quot;Gnostics&quot;—or the group covered under the modern term &quot;Gnosticism&quot;—ever appeared. It would seem that this shift from Platonic to Gnostic usage has led many people to confusion. The strategy of sectarians taking Greek terms from philosophical contexts and re-applying them to religious contexts was popular in Christianity, the Cult of Isis and other ancient religious contexts including Hermetic ones (see Alexander of Abonutichus for an example).

According to A. H. Armstrong, Plotinus and the neoplatonists viewed Gnosticism as a form of heresy or sectarianism to the Pythagorean and Platonic philosophy of the Mediterranean and Middle East. Also according to Armstrong, Plotinus accused them of using senseless jargon and being overly dramatic and insolent in their distortion of Plato&#x27;s ontology.&quot;
Armstrong argues that Plotinus attacks his opponents as untraditional, irrational and immoral and arrogant. Armstrong believed that Plotinus also attacks them as elitist and blasphemous to Plato for the Gnostics despising the material world and its maker.

For decades, Armstrong&#x27;s was the only translation available of Plotinus. For this reason, his claims were authoritative. However, a modern translation by Lloyd P. Gerson doesn&#x27;t necessarily support all of Armstrong&#x27;s views. Unlike Armstrong, Gerson didn&#x27;t find Plotinus to be so vitriolic against the Gnostics. According to Gerson:
Plotinus seems to direct his attacks at a very specific sect of Gnostics, most notably a sect of Gnostics that held anti-polytheistic and anti-daemon views, and that preached salvation was possible without struggle. At one point, Plotinus makes clear that his major grudge is the way Gnostics &#x27;misused&#x27; Plato&#x27;s teachings, and not their own teachings themselves:
The neoplatonic movement (though Plotinus would have simply referred to himself as a philosopher of Plato) seems to be motivated by the desire of Plotinus to revive the pagan philosophical tradition. Plotinus was not claiming to innovate with the &quot;Enneads&quot;, but to clarify aspects of the works of Plato that he considered misrepresented or misunderstood. Plotinus does not claim to be an innovator, but rather a communicator of a tradition. Plotinus referred to tradition as a way to interpret Plato&#x27;s intentions. Because the teachings of Plato were for members of the academy rather than the general public, it was easy for outsiders to misunderstand Plato&#x27;s meaning. However, Plotinus attempted to clarify how the philosophers of the academy had not arrived at the same conclusions (such as misotheism or dystheism of the creator God as an answer to the problem of evil) as the targets of his criticism.

=== Against causal astrology ===

Plotinus seems to be one of the first to have argued against the then popular notion of causal astrology. In the late tractate 2.3, &quot;Are the stars causes?&quot;, Plotinus makes the argument that specific stars influencing one&#x27;s fortune (a common Hellenistic theme) attributes irrationality to a perfect universe, and invites moral depravity. He does, however, claim the stars and planets are ensouled, as witnessed by their movement.

== Film studies ==

Plotinian concepts have been discussed in a cinematic context and relate Plotinus&#x27; theory of time as a transitory intelligible movement of the soul to Bergson’s and Deleuze’s time-image. 

== Influence ==

=== Ancient world ===
The emperor Julian the Apostate was deeply influenced by neoplatonism, as was Hypatia of Alexandria. Neoplatonism influenced many Christians as well, including Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite. St. Augustine, though often referred to as a &quot;Platonist&quot;, acquired his Platonist philosophy through the mediation of the Neoplatonist teachings of Plotinus.

=== Christianity ===
Plotinus&#x27; philosophy had an influence on the development of Christian theology. In &quot;A History of Western Philosophy&quot;, philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote that:
The Eastern Orthodox position on &quot;energy,&quot; for example, is often contrasted with the position of the Roman Catholic Church, and in part this is attributed to varying interpretations of Aristotle and Plotinus, either through Thomas Aquinas for the Roman Catholics or Gregory Palamas for the Orthodox Christians.

=== Islam ===
Neoplatonism and the ideas of Plotinus influenced medieval Islam as well, since the Mutazilite Abbasids fused Greek concepts into sponsored state texts, and found great influence amongst the Ismaili Shia and Persian philosophers as well, such as Muhammad al-Nasafi and Abu Yaqub Sijistani. By the 11th century, neoplatonism was adopted by the Fatimid state of Egypt, and taught by their da&#x27;i. Neoplatonism was brought to the Fatimid court by Hamid al-Din al-Kirmani, although his teachings differed from Nasafi and Sijistani, who were more aligned with the original teachings of Plotinus. The teachings of Kirmani in turn influenced philosophers such as Nasir Khusraw of Persia.

=== Judaism ===

As with Islam and Christianity, neoplatonism in general and Plotinus in particular influenced speculative thought. Notable thinkers expressing neoplatonist themes are Solomon ibn Gabirol (Latin: Avicebron) and Moses ben Maimon (Latin: Maimonides). As with Islam and Christianity, apophatic theology and the privative nature of evil are two prominent themes that such thinkers picked up from either Plotinus or his successors.

=== Renaissance ===

In the Renaissance the philosopher Marsilio Ficino set up an Academy under the patronage of Cosimo de Medici in Florence, mirroring that of Plato. His work was of great importance in reconciling the philosophy of Plato directly with Christianity. One of his most distinguished pupils was Pico della Mirandola, author of &quot;An Oration on the Dignity of Man&quot;.

=== Great Britain ===
In Great Britain, Plotinus was the cardinal influence on the 17th-century school of the Cambridge Platonists, and on numerous writers from Samuel Taylor Coleridge to W. B. Yeats and Kathleen Raine.

=== India ===
Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan and Ananda Coomaraswamy used the writing of Plotinus in their own texts as a superlative elaboration upon Indian monism, specifically Upanishadic and Advaita Vedantic thought. Coomaraswamy has compared Plotinus&#x27; teachings to the Hindu school of Advaita Vedanta (&quot;advaita&quot; meaning &quot;not two&quot; or &quot;non-dual&quot;). M. Vasudevacharya says, &quot;Though Plotinus never managed to reach India, his method shows an affinity to the &#x27;method of negation&#x27; as taught in some of the Upanishads, such as the Brhadaranyaka Upanishad, and also to the practice of yoga.&quot;

Advaita Vedanta and neoplatonism have been compared by J. F. Staal, Frederick Copleston, Aldo Magris and Mario Piantelli, Radhakrishnan, Gwen Griffith-Dickson, and John Y. Fenton.

The joint influence of Advaitin and neoplatonic ideas on Ralph Waldo Emerson was considered by Dale Riepe in 1967.

<text>Bikram Yoga is a system of hot yoga, a type of yoga as exercise, spread by Bikram Choudhury and based on the teachings of B. C. Ghosh, that became popular in the early 1970s. Classes consist of a fixed sequence of 26 postures, practised in a room heated to with a humidity of 40%, intended to replicate the climate of India. The room is fitted with carpets and the walls are covered in mirrors. The instructor may adjust the students&#x27; yoga postures. Choudhury&#x27;s teaching style was abrasive.

Bikram Yoga spread rapidly across America and the Western world, reaching a peak of some 1,650 studios in at least 40 countries in 2006. Choudhury attempted to copyright the Bikram Yoga sequence from 2011, but was ultimately unsuccessful. In 2016, facing lawsuits and accusations of sexual assault, Choudhury fled to India, leaving Bikram Yoga, Inc. to be run by others.

==Origins==
Bikram Choudhury was born in Calcutta in 1944. He began studying yoga in 1969. He arrived in America in 1971, and soon began to teach yoga in health resorts in California. In 1974, two pupils, Shirley MacLaine and Anne Marie Bennstrom, helped him to open his own school at 9441 Wilshire Boulevard in Los Angeles. He attracted celebrity pupils including the Hollywood dancer Marge Champion and the actors Keir Dullea, Martin Sheen, Susan Sarandon, and Raquel Welch. Yoga classes were initially free, with a donation box. Maclaine told Choudhury he could not run an American yoga school like one in India, and he began to charge $5 for classes; attendance started to grow at once.

Choudhury later devised the 26-posture sequence of Bikram Yoga, based on the teachings of B. C. Ghosh.

==Style==

Bikram Yoga Beginning Series classes run for 90 minutes and always consist of 26 postures, namely a fixed sequence of 24 asanas and two pranayama (breathing exercise). It starts with a standing pranayama, followed by a standing sequence of asanas, a first savasana, floor asanas, the last pranayama named Kapalabhati which is a shatkarma (a purification), and a final savasana that ends the sequence. The room is fitted with mirrors and carpets, and the yoga postures of students may be adjusted by the teacher, who can also adjust themselves using the mirrors.

The hot yoga style is practised in a room heated to with a humidity of 40%, intended to replicate the climate of India where it was created. Bikram Yoga trains its own teachers. They are taught a standardized dialogue to run the class, but are encouraged to develop their own delivery style.

The author Brigid Delaney described seeing Choudhury in his first yoga studio in Australia, and was &quot;shocked&quot; by the environment and by Choudhury&#x27;s bragging and abrasive manner; she noted also the docility of his students and the &quot;fawning&quot; atmosphere, writing:

==Growth==
Choudhury was extremely charismatic and persuasive, and this contributed to his success according to principal Bikram teacher Emmy Cleaves. He also had a philosophy of making pupils work through pain, and a &quot;highly entertaining in-class patter,&quot; being happy to tell pupils &quot;I am a butcher and I try to kill you ... but don&#x27;t worry, yoga is the best death.&quot; By 1984, classes were priced at $20 (about $50 in 2019 terms). That year, sports journalist Jack McCallum watched a class respond to Choudhury&#x27;s verbal abuse &quot;like eager cadets.&quot; Practice was so intense that it demanded &quot;an entire identity&quot; based on commitment to hard work, a regular yoga schedule, and verbal castigation. In short, &quot;a complete religion of bodily purification&quot; rewarded by &quot;a feeling of pure energy.&quot; The franchise grew rapidly and spread to other countries. By 2006, there were 1,650 Bikram Yoga studios around the world. The franchise then declined somewhat, and by 2012, there were 330 studios in the United States and 600 worldwide. In Africa, there were studios in Morocco and South Africa; in America, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, 39 U.S. states, and Canada; in Asia, China, India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, South Korea, Thailand, and the UAE; in Europe, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Netherlands, Norway, Russia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, and the United Kingdom; and Australia and New Zealand.

==Health effects==
A 2013 review of 76 yoga-related adverse events included 3 in Bikram Yoga. The three case reports consisted of one case of rosacea, one psychotic episode, and one of hyponatremia (low salt level).

A systematic review in 2015 found that Bikram Yoga improved lower body strength, range of joint motion in both upper and lower body, and balance. It noted that unsystematic trials (without randomized controls) had found possible improvements in glucose tolerance, bone density, blood lipids, artery stiffness, mindfulness, and &quot;perceived stress&quot;. It recommended that future research should follow guidelines to provide reliable results.

==Copyright Claims==
Choudhury claimed, starting in 2011, that Bikram Yoga was under copyright and that it could not be taught or presented by anyone whom he had not authorized. In that year, Choudhury started a lawsuit against Yoga to the People, a competing yoga studio founded by a former student of Choudhury&#x27;s and with a location near one of the Bikram Yoga studios in New York, and later started another against the Florida-based Evolation Yoga. Choudhury lost at first instance in both cases and appealed the decision, but the Court of Appeal ultimately dismissed his copyright claim over yoga poses in Bikram Yoga.

As a result of that lawsuit, the United States Copyright Office issued a clarification that yoga postures (&quot;asanas&quot;) could not be copyrighted in the way claimed by Choudhury, and that Yoga to the People and others could continue to freely teach these exercises.

==Sexual Abuse by Choudhury==
Choudhury has faced multiple lawsuits alleging sexual harassment, assault, racism and homophobia. In 2016 he fled to India, where he continued to teach yoga. His former lawyer, Minakshi Jafa-Bodden, took over the running of Bikram, Inc. in America, after she successfully sued Choudhury for $7M in damages and he fled the country to avoid payment.

The accusations against Choudhury were the subject of a 2019 Netflix true crime documentary, &quot;&quot;. The documentary also gave an exploration of Choudhury&#x27;s early life in India, mostly told by Choudhury himself, in juxtaposition with the allegations and testimonies of various women who claim to have been assaulted and bullied by him. They argue that Choudhury was a charismatic but abusive and rude narcissist who took pleasure in mocking the physical appearances of his students, while holding financial and emotional power over many of them. &quot;Bikram: Yogi, Guru, Predator&quot; has since been challenged by Choudhury&#x27;s lawyer.

<text>A deer (: deer) or true deer is a hoofed ruminant ungulate of the family Cervidae (informally the deer family). Cervidae is divided into subfamilies Cervinae (which includes, among others, muntjac, elk (wapiti), red deer, and fallow deer) and Capreolinae (which includes, among others reindeer (caribou), white-tailed deer, roe deer, and moose). Male deer of almost all species (except the water deer), as well as female reindeer, grow and shed new antlers each year. These antlers are bony extensions of the skull and are often used for combat between males.

The musk deer (Moschidae) of Asia and chevrotains (Tragulidae) of tropical African and Asian forests are separate families that are also in the ruminant clade Ruminantia; they are not especially closely related to Cervidae.

Deer appear in art from Paleolithic cave paintings onwards, and they have played a role in mythology, religion, and literature throughout history, as well as in heraldry, such as red deer that appear in the coat of arms of Åland. Their economic importance includes the use of their meat as venison, their skins as soft, strong buckskin, and their antlers as handles for knives. Deer hunting has been a popular activity since the Middle Ages and remains a resource for many families today.

==Etymology and terminology==
The word &quot;deer&quot; was originally broad in meaning, becoming more specific with time. Old English and Middle English meant a wild animal of any kind. Cognates of Old English in other dead Germanic languages have the general sense of &quot;animal&quot;, such as Old High German &quot;tior&quot;, Old Norse or , Gothic &quot;dius&quot;, Old Saxon &quot;dier&quot;, and Old Frisian &quot;diar&quot;. This general sense gave way to the modern English sense by the end of the Middle English period, around 1500. All modern Germanic languages save English and Scots retain the more general sense: for example, Dutch/Frisian , German , and Norwegian &quot;dyr&quot; mean .

For many types of deer in modern English usage, the male is a &quot;buck&quot; and the female a &quot;doe&quot;, but the terms vary with dialect, and according to the size of the species. The male red deer is a &quot;stag&quot;, while for other large species the male is a &quot;bull&quot;, the female a &quot;cow&quot;, as in cattle. In older usage, the male of any species is a &quot;hart&quot;, especially if over five years old, and the female is a &quot;hind&quot;, especially if three or more years old. The young of small species is a &quot;fawn&quot; and of large species a &quot;calf&quot;; a very small young may be a &quot;kid&quot;. A castrated male is a &quot;havier&quot;. A group of any species is a &quot;herd&quot;. The adjective of relation is &quot;&quot;; like the family name &quot;Cervidae&quot;, this is from , meaning or .

==Distribution==

Deer live in a variety of biomes, ranging from tundra to the tropical rainforest. While often associated with forests, many deer are ecotone species that live in transitional areas between forests and thickets (for cover) and prairie and savanna (open space). The majority of large deer species inhabit temperate mixed deciduous forest, mountain mixed coniferous forest, tropical seasonal/dry forest, and savanna habitats around the world. Clearing open areas within forests to some extent may actually benefit deer populations by exposing the understory and allowing the types of grasses, weeds, and herbs to grow that deer like to eat. Access to adjacent croplands may also benefit deer. Adequate forest or brush cover must still be provided for populations to grow and thrive.

Deer are widely distributed, with indigenous representatives in all continents except Antarctica and Australia, though Africa has only one native deer, the Barbary stag, a subspecies of red deer that is confined to the Atlas Mountains in the northwest of the continent. Another extinct species of deer, &quot;Megaceroides algericus,&quot; was present in North Africa until 6000 years ago. Fallow deer have been introduced to South Africa. Small species of brocket deer and pudús of Central and South America, and muntjacs of Asia generally occupy dense forests and are less often seen in open spaces, with the possible exception of the Indian muntjac. There are also several species of deer that are highly specialized and live almost exclusively in mountains, grasslands, swamps, and &quot;wet&quot; savannas, or riparian corridors surrounded by deserts. Some deer have a circumpolar distribution in both North America and Eurasia. Examples include the caribou that live in Arctic tundra and taiga (boreal forests) and moose that inhabit taiga and adjacent areas. Huemul deer (taruca and Chilean huemul) of South America&#x27;s Andes fill the ecological niches of the ibex and wild goat, with the fawns behaving more like goat kids.

The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate North America lies in the Canadian Rocky Mountain and Columbia Mountain regions between Alberta and British Columbia where all five North American deer species (white-tailed deer, mule deer, caribou, elk, and moose) can be found. This region has several clusters of national parks including Mount Revelstoke National Park, Glacier National Park (Canada), Yoho National Park, and Kootenay National Park on the British Columbia side, and Banff National Park, Jasper National Park, and Glacier National Park (U.S.) on the Alberta and Montana sides. Mountain slope habitats vary from moist coniferous/mixed forested habitats to dry subalpine/pine forests with alpine meadows higher up. The foothills and river valleys between the mountain ranges provide a mosaic of cropland and deciduous parklands. The rare woodland caribou have the most restricted range living at higher altitudes in the subalpine meadows and alpine tundra areas of some of the mountain ranges. Elk and mule deer both migrate between the alpine meadows and lower coniferous forests and tend to be most common in this region. Elk also inhabit river valley bottomlands, which they share with White-tailed deer. The White-tailed deer have recently expanded their range within the foothills and river valley bottoms of the Canadian Rockies owing to conversion of land to cropland and the clearing of coniferous forests allowing more deciduous vegetation to grow up the mountain slopes. They also live in the aspen parklands north of Calgary and Edmonton, where they share habitat with the moose. The adjacent Great Plains grassland habitats are left to herds of elk, American bison, and pronghorn.
The Eurasian Continent (including the Indian Subcontinent) boasts the most species of deer in the world, with most species being found in Asia. Europe, in comparison, has lower diversity in plant and animal species. Many national parks and protected reserves in Europe have populations of red deer, roe deer, and fallow deer. These species have long been associated with the continent of Europe, but also inhabit Asia Minor, the Caucasus Mountains, and Northwestern Iran. &quot;European&quot; fallow deer historically lived over much of Europe during the Ice Ages, but afterwards became restricted primarily to the Anatolian Peninsula, in present-day Turkey.

Present-day fallow deer populations in Europe are a result of historic man-made introductions of this species, first to the Mediterranean regions of Europe, then eventually to the rest of Europe. They were initially park animals that later escaped and reestablished themselves in the wild. Historically, Europe&#x27;s deer species shared their deciduous forest habitat with other herbivores, such as the extinct tarpan (forest horse), extinct aurochs (forest ox), and the endangered wisent (European bison). Good places to see deer in Europe include the Scottish Highlands, the Austrian Alps, the wetlands between Austria, Hungary, and the Czech Republic, and some National Parks, including Doñana National Park in Spain, the Veluwe in the Netherlands, the Ardennes in Belgium, and Białowieża National Park in Poland. Spain, Eastern Europe, and the Caucasus Mountains have forest areas that are not only home to sizable deer populations but also other animals that were once abundant such as the wisent, Eurasian lynx, Iberian lynx, wolves, and brown bears.
The highest concentration of large deer species in temperate Asia occurs in the mixed deciduous forests, mountain coniferous forests, and taiga bordering North Korea, Manchuria (Northeastern China), and the Ussuri Region (Russia). These are among some of the richest deciduous and coniferous forests in the world where one can find Siberian roe deer, sika deer, elk, and moose. Asian caribou occupy the northern fringes of this region along the Sino-Russian border.

Deer such as the sika deer, Thorold&#x27;s deer, Central Asian red deer, and elk have historically been farmed for their antlers by Han Chinese, Turkic peoples, Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Koreans. Like the Sami people of Finland and Scandinavia, the Tungusic peoples, Mongolians, and Turkic peoples of Southern Siberia, Northern Mongolia, and the Ussuri Region have also taken to raising semi-domesticated herds of Asian caribou.

The highest concentration of large deer species in the tropics occurs in Southern Asia in India&#x27;s Indo-Gangetic Plain Region and Nepal&#x27;s Terai Region. These fertile plains consist of tropical seasonal moist deciduous, dry deciduous forests, and both dry and wet savannas that are home to chital, hog deer, barasingha, Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Grazing species such as the endangered barasingha and very common chital are gregarious and live in large herds. Indian sambar can be gregarious but are usually solitary or live in smaller herds. Hog deer are solitary and have lower densities than Indian muntjac. Deer can be seen in several national parks in India, Nepal, and Sri Lanka of which Kanha National Park, Dudhwa National Park, and Chitwan National Park are most famous. Sri Lanka&#x27;s Wilpattu National Park and Yala National Park have large herds of Indian sambar and chital. The Indian sambar are more gregarious in Sri Lanka than other parts of their range and tend to form larger herds than elsewhere.
The Chao Praya River Valley of Thailand was once primarily tropical seasonal moist deciduous forest and wet savanna that hosted populations of hog deer, the now-extinct Schomburgk&#x27;s deer, Eld&#x27;s deer, Indian sambar, and Indian muntjac. Both the hog deer and Eld&#x27;s deer are rare, whereas Indian sambar and Indian muntjac thrive in protected national parks, such as Khao Yai. Many of these South Asian and Southeast Asian deer species also share their habitat with other herbivores, such as Asian elephants, the various Asian rhinoceros species, various antelope species (such as nilgai, four-horned antelope, blackbuck, and Indian gazelle in India), and wild oxen (such as wild Asian water buffalo, gaur, banteng, and kouprey). One way that different herbivores can survive together in a given area is for each species to have different food preferences, although there may be some overlap.

As a result of acclimatisation society releases in the 19th century, Australia has six introduced species of deer that have established sustainable wild populations. They are fallow deer, red deer, sambar, hog deer, rusa, and chital. Red deer were introduced into New Zealand in 1851 from English and Scottish stock. Many have been domesticated in deer farms since the late 1960s and are common farm animals there now. Seven other species of deer were introduced into New Zealand but none are as widespread as red deer.

==Description==
Deer constitute the second most diverse family of artiodactyla after bovids. Though of a similar build, deer are strongly distinguished from antelopes by their antlers, which are temporary and regularly regrown unlike the permanent horns of bovids. Characteristics typical of deer include long, powerful legs, a diminutive tail and long ears. Deer exhibit a broad variation in physical proportions. The largest extant deer is the moose, which is nearly tall and weighs up to . The elk stands at the shoulder and weighs . The northern pudu is the smallest deer in the world; it reaches merely at the shoulder and weighs . The southern pudu is only slightly taller and heavier. Sexual dimorphism is quite pronounced – in most species males tend to be larger than females, and, except for the reindeer, only males have antlers.

Coat colour generally varies between red and brown, though it can be as dark as chocolate brown in the tufted deer or have a grayish tinge as in elk. Different species of brocket deer vary from gray to reddish brown in coat colour. Several species such as the chital, the fallow deer and the sika deer feature white spots on a brown coat. Coat of reindeer shows notable geographical variation. Deer undergo two moults in a year; for instance, in red deer the red, thin-haired summer coat is gradually replaced by the dense, greyish brown winter coat in autumn, which in turn gives way to the summer coat in the following spring. Moulting is affected by the photoperiod.

Deer are also excellent jumpers and swimmers. Deer are ruminants, or cud-chewers, and have a four-chambered stomach. Some deer, such as those on the island of Rùm, do consume meat when it is available.

Nearly all deer have a facial gland in front of each eye. The gland contains a strongly scented pheromone, used to mark its home range. Bucks of a wide range of species open these glands wide when angry or excited. All deer have a liver without a gallbladder. Deer also have a tapetum lucidum, which gives them sufficiently good night vision.

===Antlers===

All male deer have antlers, with the exception of the water deer, in which males have long tusk-like canines that reach below the lower jaw. Females generally lack antlers, though female reindeer bear antlers smaller and less branched than those of the males. Occasionally females in other species may develop antlers, especially in telemetacarpal deer such as European roe deer, red deer, white-tailed deer and mule deer and less often in plesiometacarpal deer. A study of antlered female white-tailed deer noted that antlers tend to be small and malformed, and are shed frequently around the time of parturition.
The fallow deer and the various subspecies of the reindeer have the largest as well as the heaviest antlers, both in absolute terms as well as in proportion to body mass (an average of eight grams per kilogram of body mass); the tufted deer, on the other hand, has the smallest antlers of all deer, while the pudú has the lightest antlers with respect to body mass (0.6 g per kilogram of body mass). The structure of antlers show considerable variation; while fallow deer and elk antlers are palmate (with a broad central portion), white-tailed deer antlers include a series of tines sprouting upward from a forward-curving main beam, and those of the pudú are mere spikes. Antler development begins from the pedicel, a bony structure that appears on the top of the skull by the time the animal is a year old. The pedicel gives rise to a spiky antler the following year, that is replaced by a branched antler in the third year. This process of losing a set of antlers to develop a larger and more branched set continues for the rest of the life. The antlers emerge as soft tissues (known as velvet antlers) and progressively harden into bony structures (known as hard antlers), following mineralisation and blockage of blood vessels in the tissue, from the tip to the base.
Antlers might be one of the most exaggerated male secondary sexual characteristics, and are intended primarily for reproductive success through sexual selection and for combat. The tines (forks) on the antlers create grooves that allow another male&#x27;s antlers to lock into place. This allows the males to wrestle without risking injury to the face. Antlers are correlated to an individual&#x27;s position in the social hierarchy and its behaviour. For instance, the heavier the antlers, the higher the individual&#x27;s status in the social hierarchy, and the greater the delay in shedding the antlers; males with larger antlers tend to be more aggressive and dominant over others. Antlers can be an honest signal of genetic quality; males with larger antlers relative to body size tend to have increased resistance to pathogens and higher reproductive capacity.

In elk in Yellowstone National Park, antlers also provide protection against predation by wolves.

Homology of tines, that is, the branching structure of antlers among species, have been discussed before the 1900s. Recently, a new method to describe the branching structure of antlers and determining homology of tines was developed.

===Teeth===
Most deer bear 32 teeth; the corresponding dental formula is: . The elk and the reindeer may be exceptions, as they may retain their upper canines and thus have 34 teeth (dental formula: ). The Chinese water deer, tufted deer, and muntjac have enlarged upper canine teeth forming sharp tusks, while other species often lack upper canines altogether. The cheek teeth of deer have crescent ridges of enamel, which enable them to grind a wide variety of vegetation. The teeth of deer are adapted to feeding on vegetation, and like other ruminants, they lack upper incisors, instead having a tough pad at the front of their upper jaw.

==Biology==

===Diet===

Deer are browsers, and feed primarily on foliage of grasses, sedges, forbs, shrubs and trees, secondarily on lichens in northern latitudes during winter. They have small, unspecialized stomachs by ruminant standards, and high nutrition requirements. Rather than eating and digesting vast quantities of low-grade fibrous food as, for example, sheep and cattle do, deer select easily digestible shoots, young leaves, fresh grasses, soft twigs, fruit, fungi, and lichens. The low-fibered food, after minimal fermentation and shredding, passes rapidly through the alimentary canal. The deer require a large amount of minerals such as calcium and phosphate in order to support antler growth, and this further necessitates a nutrient-rich diet. There are some reports of deer engaging in carnivorous activity, such as eating dead alewives along lakeshores or depredating the nests of northern bobwhites.

===Reproduction===

Nearly all cervids are so-called species: the young, known in most species as fawns, are only cared for by the mother, most often called a doe. A doe generally has one or two fawns at a time (triplets, while not unknown, are uncommon). Mating season typically begins in later August and lasts until December. Some species mate until early March. The gestation period is anywhere up to ten months for the European roe deer. Most fawns are born with their fur covered with white spots, though in many species they lose these spots by the end of their first winter. In the first twenty minutes of a fawn&#x27;s life, the fawn begins to take its first steps. Its mother licks it clean until it is almost free of scent, so predators will not find it. Its mother leaves often to graze, and the fawn does not like to be left behind. Sometimes its mother must gently push it down with her foot. The fawn stays hidden in the grass for one week until it is strong enough to walk with its mother. The fawn and its mother stay together for about one year. A male usually leaves and never sees his mother again, but females sometimes come back with their own fawns and form small herds.

===Disease===

In some areas of the UK, deer (especially fallow deer due to their gregarious behaviour) have been implicated as a possible reservoir for transmission of bovine tuberculosis, a disease which in the UK in 2005 cost £90 million in attempts to eradicate. In New Zealand, deer are thought to be important as vectors picking up &quot;M. bovis&quot; in areas where brushtail possums &quot;Trichosurus vulpecula&quot; are infected, and transferring it to previously uninfected possums when their carcasses are scavenged elsewhere. The white-tailed deer &quot;Odocoileus virginianus&quot; has been confirmed as the sole maintenance host in the Michigan outbreak of bovine tuberculosis which remains a significant barrier to the US nationwide eradication of the disease in livestock. Moose and deer can carry rabies.

Docile moose may suffer from brain worm, a helminth which drills holes through the brain in its search for a suitable place to lay its eggs. A government biologist states that &quot;They move around looking for the right spot and never really find it.&quot; Deer appear to be immune to this parasite; it passes through the digestive system and is excreted in the feces. The parasite is not screened by the moose intestine, and passes into the brain where damage is done that is externally apparent, both in behaviour and in gait.

Deer, elk and moose in North America may suffer from chronic wasting disease, which was identified at a Colorado laboratory in the 1960s and is believed to be a prion disease. Out of an abundance of caution hunters are advised to avoid contact with specified risk material (SRM) such as the brain, spinal column or lymph nodes. Deboning the meat when butchering and sanitizing the knives and other tools used to butcher are amongst other government recommendations.

==Evolution==

Deer are believed to have evolved from antlerless, tusked ancestors that resembled modern duikers and diminutive deer in the early Eocene, and gradually developed into the first antlered cervoids (the superfamily of cervids and related extinct families) in the Miocene. Eventually, with the development of antlers, the tusks as well as the upper incisors disappeared. Thus, evolution of deer took nearly 30 million years. Biologist Valerius Geist suggests evolution to have occurred in stages. There are not many prominent fossils to trace this evolution, but only fragments of skeletons and antlers that might be easily confused with false antlers of non-cervid species.

===Eocene===

The ruminants, ancestors of the Cervidae, are believed to have evolved from &quot;Diacodexis&quot;, the earliest known artiodactyl (even-toed ungulate), 50–55 Mya in the Eocene. &quot;Diacodexis&quot;, nearly the size of a rabbit, featured the talus bone characteristic of all modern even-toed ungulates. This ancestor and its relatives occurred throughout North America and Eurasia, but were on the decline by at least 46 Mya. Analysis of a nearly complete skeleton of &quot;Diacodexis&quot; discovered in 1982 gave rise to speculation that this ancestor could be closer to the non-ruminants than the ruminants. &quot;Andromeryx&quot; is another prominent prehistoric ruminant, but appears to be closer to the tragulids.

===Oligocene===
The formation of the Himalayas and the Alps brought about significant geographic changes. This was the chief reason behind the extensive diversification of deer-like forms and the emergence of cervids from the Oligocene to the early Pliocene. The latter half of the Oligocene (28–34 Mya) saw the appearance of the European &quot;Eumeryx&quot; and the North American &quot;Leptomeryx&quot;. The latter resembled modern-day bovids and cervids in dental morphology (for instance, it had brachyodont molars), while the former was more advanced. Other deer-like forms included the North American &quot;Blastomeryx&quot; and the European &quot;Dremotherium&quot;; these sabre-toothed animals are believed to have been the direct ancestors of all modern antlered deer, though they themselves lacked antlers. Another contemporaneous form was the four-horned protoceratid &quot;Protoceras&quot;, that was replaced by &quot;Syndyoceras&quot; in the Miocene; these animals were unique in having a horn on the nose. Late Eocene fossils dated approximately 35 million years ago, which were found in North America, show that &quot;Syndyoceras&quot; had bony skull outgrowths that resembled non-deciduous antlers.

===Miocene===

Fossil evidence suggests that the earliest members of the superfamily Cervoidea appeared in Eurasia in the Miocene. &quot;Dicrocerus&quot;, &quot;Euprox&quot; and &quot;Heteroprox&quot; were probably the first antlered cervids. &quot;Dicrocerus&quot; featured single-forked antlers that were shed regularly. &quot;Stephanocemas&quot; had more developed and diffuse (&quot;crowned&quot;) antlers. &quot;Procervulus&quot; (Palaeomerycidae) also had antlers that were not shed. Contemporary forms such as the merycodontines eventually gave rise to the modern pronghorn.

The Cervinae emerged as the first group of extant cervids around 7–9 Mya, during the late Miocene in central Asia. The tribe Muntiacini made its appearance as † &quot;Muntiacus leilaoensis&quot; around 7–8 Mya; The early muntjacs varied in size–as small as hares or as large as fallow deer. They had tusks for fighting and antlers for defence. Capreolinae followed soon after; Alceini appeared 6.4–8.4 Mya. Around this period, the Tethys Ocean disappeared to give way to vast stretches of grassland; these provided the deer with abundant protein-rich vegetation that led to the development of ornamental antlers and allowed populations to flourish and colonise areas. As antlers had become pronounced, the canines were either lost or became poorly represented (as in elk), probably because diet was no longer browse-dominated and antlers were better display organs. In muntjac and tufted deer, the antlers as well as the canines are small. The tragulids have long canines to this day.

===Pliocene===
With the onset of the Pliocene, the global climate became cooler. A fall in the sea-level led to massive glaciation; consequently, grasslands abounded in nutritious forage. Thus a new spurt in deer populations ensued. The oldest member of Cervini, † &quot;Cervocerus novorossiae&quot;, appeared around the transition from Miocene to Pliocene (4.2–6 Mya) in Eurasia; cervine fossils from early Pliocene to as late as the Pleistocene have been excavated in China and the Himalayas. While &quot;Cervus&quot; and &quot;Dama&quot; appeared nearly 3 Mya, &quot;Axis&quot; emerged during the late Pliocene–Pleistocene. The tribes Capreolini and Rangiferini appeared around 4–7 Mya.

Around 5 Mya, the rangiferina † &quot;Bretzia&quot; and † &quot;Eocoileus&quot; were the first cervids to reach North America. This implies the Bering Strait could be crossed during the late Miocene–Pliocene; this appears highly probable as the camelids migrated into Asia from North America around the same time. Deer invaded South America in the late Pliocene (2.5–3 Mya) as part of the Great American Interchange, thanks to the recently formed Isthmus of Panama, and emerged successful due to the small number of competing ruminants in the continent.

===Pleistocene===

Large deer with impressive antlers evolved during the early Pleistocene, probably as a result of abundant resources to drive evolution. The early Pleistocene cervid † &quot;Eucladoceros&quot; was comparable in size to the modern elk. † &quot;Megaloceros&quot; (Pliocene–Pleistocene) featured the Irish elk (&quot;M. giganteus&quot;), one of the largest known cervids. The Irish elk reached at the shoulder and had heavy antlers that spanned from tip to tip. These large animals were traditionally thought to have faced extinction due to conflict between sexual selection for large antlers and body and natural selection for a smaller form, but a combination of anthropogenic and climatic pressures is now thought to be the most likely culprit. Meanwhile, the moose and reindeer radiated into North America from Siberia.

==Taxonomy and classification==

Deer constitute the artiodactyl family Cervidae. This family was first described by German zoologist Georg August Goldfuss in &quot;Handbuch der Zoologie&quot; (1820). Three subfamilies were recognised: Capreolinae (first described by the English zoologist Joshua Brookes in 1828), Cervinae (described by Goldfuss) and Hydropotinae (first described by French zoologist Édouard Louis Trouessart in 1898).

Other attempts at the classification of deer have been based on morphological and genetic differences. The Anglo-Irish naturalist Victor Brooke suggested in 1878 that deer could be bifurcated into two classes on the according to the features of the second and fifth metacarpal bones of their forelimbs: Plesiometacarpalia (most Old World deer) and Telemetacarpalia (most New World deer). He treated the musk deer as a cervid, placing it under Telemetacarpalia. While the telemetacarpal deer showed only those elements located far from the joint, the plesiometacarpal deer retained the elements closer to the joint as well. Differentiation on the basis of diploid number of chromosomes in the late 20th century has been flawed by several inconsistencies.

In 1987, the zoologists Colin Groves and Peter Grubb identified three subfamilies: Cervinae, Hydropotinae and Odocoileinae; they noted that the hydropotines lack antlers, and the other two subfamilies differ in their skeletal morphology. They reverted from this classification in 2000.

Molecular phylogenetic analyses since the latter half of the 2000s all show that &quot;hydropotes&quot; is a sister taxon of &quot;Capreolus&quot;, and “Hydropotinae” became outdated subfamily.

===External relationships===

Until 2003, it was understood that the family Moschidae (musk deer) was sister to Cervidae. Then a phylogenetic study by Alexandre Hassanin (of National Museum of Natural History, France) and colleagues, based on mitochondrial and nuclear analyses, revealed that Moschidae and Bovidae form a clade sister to Cervidae. According to the study, Cervidae diverged from the Bovidae-Moschidae clade 27 to 28 million years ago. The following cladogram is based on the 2003 study.

===Internal relationships===

A 2006 phylogenetic study of the internal relationships in Cervidae by Clément Gilbert and colleagues divided the family into two major clades: Capreolinae (telemetacarpal or New World deer) and Cervinae (plesiometacarpal or Old World deer). Studies in the late 20th century suggested a similar bifurcation in the family. This as well as previous studies support monophyly in Cervinae, while Capreolinae appears paraphyletic. The 2006 study identified two lineages in Cervinae, Cervini (comprising the genera &quot;Axis&quot;, &quot;Cervus&quot;, &quot;Dama&quot; and &quot;Rucervus&quot;) and Muntiacini (&quot;Muntiacus&quot; and &quot;Elaphodus&quot;). Capreolinae featured three lineages, Alceini (&quot;Alces&quot; species), Capreolini (&quot;Capreolus&quot; and the subfamily Hydropotinae) and Rangiferini (&quot;Blastocerus&quot;, &quot;Hippocamelus&quot;, &quot;Mazama&quot;, &quot;Odocoileus&quot;, &quot;Pudu&quot; and &quot;Rangifer&quot; species). The following cladogram is based on the 2006 study.


==Human interaction==


===Prehistoric===

Deer were an important source of food for early hominids. In China, &quot;Homo erectus&quot; fed upon the sika deer, while the red deer was hunted in Germany. In the Upper Palaeolithic, the reindeer was the staple food for Cro-Magnon people, while the cave paintings at Lascaux in southwestern France include some 90 images of stags. In China, deer continued to be a main source of food for millennia even after people began farming, and it is possible that sika and other deer benefited from the frequently abandoned field sites. 

===Historic===
Deer had a central role in the ancient art, culture and mythology of various peoples including the Hittites, the ancient Egyptians, the Celts, the ancient Greeks, and certain East Asian cultures. For instance, the Stag Hunt Mosaic of ancient Pella, under the Kingdom of Macedonia (4th century BC), possibly depicts Alexander the Great hunting a deer with Hephaestion. In Japanese Shintoism, the sika deer is believed to be a messenger to the gods. In China, deer are associated with great medicinal significance; deer penis is thought by some in China to have aphrodisiac properties. Spotted deer are believed in China to accompany the god of longevity. Deer was the principal sacrificial animal for the Huichal Indians of Mexico. In medieval Europe, deer appeared in hunting scenes and coats-of-arms. Deer are depicted in many materials by various pre-Hispanic civilizations in the Andes.

The common male given name &quot;Oscar&quot; is taken from the Irish Language, where it is derived from two elements: the first, &quot;os&quot;, means &quot;deer&quot;; the second element, &quot;cara&quot;, means &quot;friend&quot;. The name is borne by a famous hero of Irish mythology—Oscar, grandson of Fionn Mac Cumhail. The name was popularised in the 18th century by James Macpherson, creator of &#x27;Ossianic poetry&#x27;.

===Literary===
Deer have been an integral part of fables and other literary works since the inception of writing. Stags were used as symbols in the latter Sumerian writings. For instance, the boat of Sumerian god Enki is named the &quot;Stag of Azbu&quot;. There are several mentions of the animal in the Rigveda as well as the Bible. In the Indian epic Ramayana, Sita is lured by a golden deer which Rama tries to catch. In the absence of both Rama and Lakshman, Ravana kidnaps Sita. Many of the allegorical Aesop&#x27;s fables, such as &quot;The Stag at the Pool&quot;, &quot;The One-Eyed Doe&quot; and &quot;The Stag and a Lion&quot;, personify deer to give moral lessons. For instance, &quot;The Sick Stag&quot; gives the message that uncaring friends can do more harm than good. The Yaqui deer song accompanies the deer dance which is performed by a pascola [from the Spanish &#x27;pascua&#x27;, Easter] dancer (also known as a deer dancer). Pascolas would perform at religious and social functions many times of the year, especially during Lent and Easter.

In one of Rudolf Erich Raspe&#x27;s 1785 stories of &quot;Baron Munchausen&#x27;s Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia&quot;, the baron encounters a stag while eating cherries and, without ammunition, fires the cherry-pits at the stag with his musket, but it escapes. The next year, the baron encounters a stag with a cherry tree growing from its head; presumably this is the animal he had shot at the previous year. In Christmas lore (such as in the narrative poem &quot;A Visit from St. Nicholas&quot;), reindeer are often depicted pulling the sleigh of Santa Claus. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning 1938 novel &quot;The Yearling&quot; was about a boy&#x27;s relationship with a baby deer. The fiction book &quot;Fire Bringer&quot; is about a young fawn who goes on a quest to save the Herla, the deer kind. In the 1942 Walt Disney Pictures film, &quot;Bambi&quot; is a white-tailed deer, while in Felix Salten&#x27;s original 1923 book &quot;Bambi, a Life in the Woods&quot;, he is a roe deer. In C. S. Lewis&#x27;s 1950 fantasy novel &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; the adult Pevensies, now kings and queens of Narnia, chase the White Stag on a hunt, as the Stag is said to grant its captor a wish. The hunt is key in returning the Pevensies to their home in England. In the 1979 book &quot;The Animals of Farthing Wood&quot;, The Great White Stag is the leader of all the animals.

===Heraldic===

Deer of various types appear frequently in European heraldry. In the British armory, the term &quot;stag&quot; is typically used to refer to antlered male red deer, while &quot;buck&quot; indicates an antlered male fallow deer. Stags and bucks appear in a number of attitudes, referred to as &quot;lodged&quot; when the deer is lying down, &quot;trippant&quot; when it has one leg raised, &quot;courant&quot; when it is running, &quot;springing&quot; when in the act of leaping, &quot;statant&quot; when it is standing with all hooves on the ground and looking ahead, and &quot;at gaze&quot; when otherwise statant but looking at the viewer. Stags&#x27; heads are also frequently used; these are typically portrayed without an attached neck and as facing the viewer, in which case they are termed &quot;caboshed&quot;.

Examples of deer in coats of arms can be found in the arms of Hertfordshire, England, and its county town of Hertford; both are examples of canting arms. A deer appears on the arms of the Israeli Postal Authority. Coats of arms featuring deer include those of Baden-Württemberg, Dotternhausen, Thierachern, Friolzheim, Bauen, Albstadt, and Dassel in Germany; of the Earls Bathurst in England; of Balakhna, Gusev, Nizhny Novgorod, Odintsovo, Slavsk and Yamalo-Nenets in Russia; of Berezhany, Sambir in Ukraine; of Åland, Finland; of Gjemnes, Hitra, Hjartdal and Rendalen in Norway; of Jelenia Góra, Poland; of Umeå, Sweden; of Queensland, Australia; of Cervera, Catalonia; of Selonia and Semigallia in Latvia; and of Chile.

Other types of deer used in heraldry include the hind, portrayed much like the stag or buck but without antlers, as well as the reindeer and winged stags. Winged stags are used as supporters in the arms of the de Carteret family. The sea-stag, having the antlers, head, forelegs and upper body of a stag and the tail of a mermaid, is often found in German heraldry.

===Economic===
Deer have long had economic significance to humans. Deer meat, known as venison, is highly nutritious. Due to the inherently wild nature and diet of deer, venison is most often obtained through deer hunting. In the United States, it is produced in small amounts compared to beef, but still represents a significant trade. Deer hunting is a popular activity in the U.S. that can provide the hunter&#x27;s family with high quality meat and generates revenue for states and the federal government from the sales of licenses, permits and tags. The 2006 survey by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that license sales generate approximately $700 million annually. This revenue generally goes to support conservation efforts in the states where the licenses are purchased. Overall, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that big game hunting for deer and elk generates approximately $11.8 billion annually in hunting-related travel, equipment and related expenditures. Conservation laws prevent the sale of unlicensed wild game meat, although it may be donated.
Deer have often been bred in captivity as ornaments for parks, but only in the case of reindeer has thorough domestication succeeded. By 2012, some 25,000 tons of red deer were raised on farms in North America. The Sami of Scandinavia and the Kola Peninsula of Russia and other nomadic peoples of northern Asia use reindeer for food, clothing, and transport. Others are bred for hunting are selected based on the size of the antlers. The major deer-producing countries are New Zealand, the market leader, with Ireland, Great Britain and Germany. The trade earns over $100 million annually for these countries.

Automobile collisions with deer can impose a significant cost on the economy. In the U.S., about 1.5 million deer-vehicle collisions occur each year, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Those accidents cause about 150 human deaths and $1.1 billion in property damage annually. In Scotland, several roads including the A82, the A87 and the A835 have had significant enough problems with &quot;deer vehicle collisions&quot; (DVCs) that sets of vehicle activated automatic warning signs have been installed along these roads.
The skins make a peculiarly strong, soft leather, known as buckskin. There is nothing special about skins with the fur still on since the hair is brittle and soon falls off. The hooves and antlers are used for ornamental purposes, especially the antlers of the roe deer, which are utilized for making umbrella handles, and for similar purposes; elk antlers is often employed in making knife handles. Among the Inuit, the traditional &quot;ulu&quot; women&#x27;s knife was made with an antler or ivory handle. In China, a traditional chinese medicine is made from stag antler, and the antlers of certain species are eaten when &quot;in the velvet&quot;. Antlers can also be boiled down to release the protein gelatin, which is used as a topical treatment for skin irritation and is also used in cooking.

Since the early 20th century, deer have become commonly thought of as pests in New Zealand due to a lack of predators on the island causing population numbers to increase and begin encroaching on more populated areas. They compete with livestock for resources, as well as cause excess erosion and wreak havoc on wild plant species and agriculture alike. They can also have an effect on the conservation efforts of other plant and animal species, as they can critically offset the balance within an environment by drastically depleting diversity within forests.

<text>Wool is the textile fiber obtained from sheep and other mammals, especially goats, rabbits, and camelids. The term may also refer to inorganic materials, such as mineral wool and glass wool, that have some properties similar to animal wool.

As an animal fiber, wool consists of protein together with a small percentage of lipids. This makes it chemically quite distinct from cotton and other plant fibers, which are mainly cellulose.

==Characteristics==
Wool is produced by follicles which are small cells located in the skin. These follicles are located in the upper layer of the skin called the epidermis and push down into the second skin layer called the dermis as the wool fibers grow. Follicles can be classed as either primary or secondary follicles. Primary follicles produce three types of fiber: kemp, medullated fibers, and true wool fibers. Secondary follicles only produce true wool fibers. Medullated fibers share nearly identical characteristics to hair and are long but lack crimp and elasticity. Kemp fibers are very coarse and shed out. 
Wool&#x27;s crimp refers to the strong natural wave present in each wool fiber as it is presented on the animal. Wool&#x27;s crimp, and to a lesser degree scales, make it easier to spin the fleece by helping the individual fibers attach, so they stay together. Because of the crimp, wool fabrics have greater bulk than other textiles, and they hold air, which causes the fabric to retain heat. Wool has a high specific thermal resistance, so it impedes heat transfer in general. This effect has benefited desert peoples, as Bedouins and Tuaregs use wool clothes for insulation.

The felting of wool occurs upon hammering or other mechanical agitation as the microscopic barbs on the surface of wool fibers hook together. Felting generally comes under two main areas, dry felting and wet felting. Wet felting occurs when water and a lubricant (especially an alkali such as soap) are applied to the wool which is then agitated until the fibers mix and bond together. Temperature shock while damp or wet accentuates the felting process. Some natural felting can occur on the animal&#x27;s back.

Wool has several qualities that distinguish it from hair or fur: it is crimped and elastic. 

The amount of crimp corresponds to the fineness of the wool fibers. A fine wool like Merino may have up to 40 crimps per centimetre (100 crimps per inch), while coarser wool like karakul may have less than one (one or two crimps per inch). In contrast, hair has little if any scale and no crimp, and little ability to bind into yarn. On sheep, the hair part of the fleece is called kemp. The relative amounts of kemp to wool vary from breed to breed and make some fleeces more desirable for spinning, felting, or carding into batts for quilts or other insulating products, including the famous tweed cloth of Scotland.

Wool fibers readily absorb moisture, but are not hollow. Wool can absorb almost one-third of its own weight in water.
Wool absorbs sound like many other fabrics. It is generally a creamy white color, although some breeds of sheep produce natural colors, such as black, brown, silver, and random mixes.

Wool ignites at a higher temperature than cotton and some synthetic fibers. It has a lower rate of flame spread, a lower rate of heat release, a lower heat of combustion, and does not melt or drip; it forms a char that is insulating and self-extinguishing, and it contributes less to toxic gases and smoke than other flooring products when used in carpets. Wool carpets are specified for high safety environments, such as trains and aircraft. Wool is usually specified for garments for firefighters, soldiers, and others in occupations where they are exposed to the likelihood of fire.

Wool causes an allergic reaction in some people.

==Processing==

===Shearing===

Sheep shearing is the process in which a worker (a shearer) cuts off the woollen fleece of a sheep. After shearing, wool-classers separate the wool into four main categories:

* fleece (which makes up the vast bulk)
* broken
* bellies
* locks

The quality of fleeces is determined by a technique known as wool classing, whereby a qualified person, called a wool classer, groups wools of similar grading together to maximize the return for the farmer or sheep owner. In Australia, before being auctioned, all Merino fleece wool is objectively measured for average diameter (micron), yield (including the amount of vegetable matter), staple length, staple strength, and sometimes color and comfort factor.

===Scouring===
Wool straight off a sheep is known as &quot;raw wool&quot;, &quot;greasy wool&quot; or &quot;wool in the grease&quot;. This wool contains a high level of valuable lanolin, as well as the sheep&#x27;s dead skin and sweat residue, and generally also contains pesticides and vegetable matter from the animal&#x27;s environment. Before the wool can be used for commercial purposes, it must be scoured, a process of cleaning the greasy wool. Scouring may be as simple as a bath in warm water or as complicated as an industrial process using detergent and alkali in specialized equipment.
In north west England, special potash pits were constructed to produce potash used in the manufacture of a soft soap for scouring locally produced white wool.

Vegetable matter in commercial wool is often removed by chemical carbonization.
In less-processed wools, vegetable matter may be removed by hand and some of the lanolin left intact through the use of gentler detergents. This semigrease wool can be worked into yarn and knitted into particularly water-resistant mittens or sweaters, such as those of the Aran Island fishermen. Lanolin removed from wool is widely used in cosmetic products such as hand creams.

==Fineness and yield==
Raw wool has many impurities; vegetable matter, sand, dirt and yolk which is a mixture of suint (sweat), grease, urine stains and dung locks. The sheep&#x27;s body yields many types of wool with differing strengths, thicknesses, length of staple and impurities. The raw wool (greasy) is processed into &#x27;top&#x27;. &#x27;Worsted top&#x27; requires strong straight and parallel fibres.


The quality of wool is determined by its fiber diameter, crimp, yield, color, and staple strength. Fiber diameter is the single most important wool characteristic determining quality and price.

Merino wool is typically in length and is very fine (between 12 and 24 microns). The finest and most valuable wool comes from Merino hoggets. Wool taken from sheep produced for meat is typically coarser, and has fibers in length. Damage or breaks in the wool can occur if the sheep is stressed while it is growing its fleece, resulting in a thin spot where the fleece is likely to break.

Wool is also separated into grades based on the measurement of the wool&#x27;s diameter in microns and also its style. These grades may vary depending on the breed or purpose of the wool. For example:


Any wool finer than 25 microns can be used for garments, while coarser grades are used for outerwear or rugs. The finer the wool, the softer it is, while coarser grades are more durable and less prone to pilling.

The finest Australian and New Zealand Merino wools are known as 1PP, which is the industry benchmark of excellence for Merino wool 16.9 microns and finer. This style represents the top level of fineness, character, color, and style as determined on the basis of a series of parameters in accordance with the original dictates of British wool as applied by the Australian Wool Exchange (AWEX) Council. Only a few dozen of the millions of bales auctioned every year can be classified and marked 1PP.

In the United States, three classifications of wool are named in the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939. Wool is &quot;the fiber from the fleece of the sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may include the so-called specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has never been reclaimed from any woven or felted wool product&quot;. &quot;Virgin wool&quot; and &quot;new wool&quot; are also used to refer to such never used wool. There are two categories of recycled wool (also called reclaimed or shoddy wool). &quot;Reprocessed wool&quot; identifies &quot;wool which has been woven or felted into a wool product and subsequently reduced to a fibrous state without having been used by the ultimate consumer&quot;. &quot;Reused wool&quot; refers to such wool that &quot;has&quot; been used by the ultimate consumer.

==History==
Wild sheep were more hairy than woolly. Although sheep were domesticated some 9,000 to 11,000 years ago, archaeological evidence from statuary found at sites in Iran suggests selection for woolly sheep may have begun around 6000 BC, with the earliest known woven wool garments having only been dated to two to three thousand years later. Woolly sheep were introduced into Europe from the Near East in the early part of the 4th millennium BC. The oldest known European wool textile, , was preserved in a Danish bog. Prior to the invention of shears—probably in the Iron Age — wool was plucked out by hand or with bronze combs. In Roman times, wool, linen, and leather clothed the European population; cotton from India was a curiosity of which only naturalists had heard, and silks, imported along the Silk Road from China, were extravagant luxury-goods. Pliny the Elder records in his &quot;Natural History&quot; that the reputation for producing the finest wool was enjoyed by Tarentum, where selective breeding had produced sheep with superior fleeces, but which required special care.

In medieval times, as trade connections expanded, the Champagne fairs revolved around the production of wool cloth in small centers such as Provins. The network developed by the annual fairs meant that the woolens of Provins might find their way to Naples, Sicily, Cyprus, Majorca, Spain, and even Constantinople. The wool trade developed into serious undertaking, a generator of capital. In the 13th century, the wool trade became the economic engine of the Low Countries and central Italy. By the end of the 14th century, Italy predominated. The Florentine wool guild, Arte della Lana, sent imported English wool to the San Martino convent for processing. Italian wool from Abruzzo and Spanish merino wools were processed at Garbo workshops. Abruzzo wool had once been the most accessible for the Florentine guild, until improved relations with merchants in Iberia made merino wool more available. In the 15th century Pisa established a factory &quot;which would export its cloths to the Crimea in exchange for Russian furs&quot;.
By the 16th century Italian wool exports to the Levant had declined, eventually replaced by silk production.

The value of exports of English raw wool were rivaled only by the 15th-century sheepwalks of Castile and were a significant source of income to the English crown, which in 1275 had imposed an export tax on wool called the &quot;Great Custom&quot;. The importance of wool to the English economy can be seen in the fact that since the 14th century, the presiding officer of the House of Lords has sat on the &quot;Woolsack&quot;, a chair stuffed with wool.

Economies of scale were instituted in the Cistercian houses, which had accumulated great tracts of land during the 12th and early 13th centuries, when land prices were low and labor still scarce. Raw wool was baled and shipped from North Sea ports to the textile cities of Flanders, notably Ypres and Ghent, where it was dyed and worked up as cloth. At the time of the Black Death (1346-1353), English textile industries consumed about 10% of English wool production. The English textile trade grew during the 15th century, to the point where the export of wool was discouraged. Over the centuries, various British laws controlled the wool trade or required the use of wool even in burials. The smuggling of wool out of the country, known as owling, was at one time punishable by the cutting off of a hand. After the Restoration of 1660, fine English woolens began to compete with silks in the international market, partly aided by the Navigation Acts; in 1699, the English Crown forbade its American colonies to trade wool with anyone but England herself.

A great deal of the value of woollen textiles was in the dyeing and finishing of the woven product. In each of the centers of the textile trade, the manufacturing process came to be subdivided into a collection of trades, overseen by an entrepreneur in a system called by the English the &quot;putting-out&quot; system, or &quot;cottage industry&quot;, and the by the Germans. In this system of producing wool cloth, once perpetuated in the production of Harris tweeds, the entrepreneur provides the raw materials and an advance, the remainder being paid upon delivery of the product. Written contracts bound the artisans to specified terms. Fernand Braudel traces the appearance of the system in the 13th-century economic boom, quoting a document of 1275. The system effectively bypassed the guilds&#x27; restrictions.

Before the flowering of the Renaissance, the Medici and other great banking houses of Florence had built their wealth and banking system on their textile industry based on wool, overseen by the Arte della Lana, the wool guild: wool-textile interests guided Florentine policies. Francesco Datini, the &quot;merchant of Prato&quot;, established in 1383 an &quot;Arte della Lana&quot; for that small Tuscan city. The sheepwalks of Castile were controlled by the Mesta union of sheep-owners.
They shaped the landscape and the fortunes of the that lies in the heart of the Iberian peninsula; in the 16th century, a unified Spain allowed export of merino lambs only with royal permission. The German wool-market – based on sheep of Spanish origin – did not overtake British wool until comparatively late. Later, the Industrial Revolution introduced mass-production technology into wool- and wool-cloth-manufacturing. Australia&#x27;s colonial economy came to depend on sheep-raising, and the Australian wool trade eventually overtook that of the Germans by 1845, furnishing wool for Bradford, which developed as the heart of industrialized woolens production.
Due to decreasing demand for wool with increased use of synthetic fibers, wool production is much less than what it was in the past. The collapse in the price of wool began in late 1966 with a 40% drop; with occasional interruptions, the price has tended down. The result has been sharply reduced production and the movement of resources into production of other commodities, in the case of sheep growers, to production of meat.

Superwash wool (or washable wool) technology first appeared in the early 1970s, producing wool that has been specially treated so it is machine washable and may be tumble-dried. This wool is produced using an acid bath that removes the &quot;scales&quot; from the fiber, or by coating the fiber with a polymer that prevents the scales from attaching to each other and causing shrinkage. This process results in a fiber that holds longevity and durability better than synthetic materials, while retaining garment shape.

In December 2004, a bale of the then world&#x27;s finest wool, averaging 11.8 microns, sold for AU$3,000 per kilogram at auction in Melbourne. This fleece wool tested with an average yield of 74.5%, long, and had 40 newtons per kilotex strength. The result was A$279,000 for the bale.
The finest bale of wool ever auctioned was sold for a seasonal record of AU$2690 per kilo during June 2008. This bale was produced by the Hillcreston Pinehill Partnership and measured 11.6 microns, 72.1% yield, and had a 43 newtons per kilotex strength measurement. The bale realized $247,480 and was exported to India.

In 2007, a new wool suit was developed and sold in Japan which can be washed in the shower, and which dries off ready to wear within hours with no ironing required. The suit, developed using Australian merino wool, enables woven products made from wool, such as suits, trousers, and skirts, to be cleaned using a domestic shower.

In December 2006, the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed 2009 to be the International Year of Natural Fibres, so as to raise the profile of wool and of other natural fibers.

==Production==
Global wool production is about per year, of which 60% goes into apparel. Wool comprises ca 3% of the global textile market, but its value is higher owing to dyeing and other modifications of the material. Australia is a leading producer of wool which is mostly from Merino sheep but has been eclipsed by China in terms of total weight. New Zealand (2016) is the third-largest producer of wool, and the largest producer of crossbred wool. Breeds such as Lincoln, Romney, Drysdale, and Elliotdale produce coarser fibers, and wool from these sheep is usually used for making carpets.

In the United States, Texas, New Mexico, and Colorado have large commercial sheep flocks and their mainstay is the Rambouillet (or French Merino). Also, a thriving home-flock contingent of small-scale farmers raise small hobby flocks of specialty sheep for the hand-spinning market. These small-scale farmers offer a wide selection of fleece.

Organic wool has gained in popularity. This wool is limited in supply and much of it comes from New Zealand and Australia. Organic wool has become easier to find in clothing and other products, but these products often carry a higher price.

Wool is environmentally preferable (as compared to petroleum-based nylon or polypropylene) as a material for carpets, as well, in particular when combined with a natural binding and the use of formaldehyde-free glues.

Animal rights groups have noted issues with the production of wool, such as mulesing.

==Marketing==
===Australia===
About 85% of wool sold in Australia is sold by open cry auction. 


===Other countries===

The British Wool Marketing Board operates a central marketing system for UK fleece wool with the aim of achieving the best possible net returns for farmers.

Less than half of New Zealand&#x27;s wool is sold at auction, while around 45% of farmers sell wool directly to private buyers and end-users.

United States sheep producers market wool with private or cooperative wool warehouses, but wool pools are common in many states. In some cases, wool is pooled in a local market area, but sold through a wool warehouse. Wool offered with objective measurement test results is preferred. Imported apparel wool and carpet wool goes directly to central markets, where it is handled by the large merchants and manufacturers.

==Yarn==
Shoddy or recycled wool is made by cutting or tearing apart existing wool fabric and respinning the resulting fibers. As this process makes the wool fibers shorter, the remanufactured fabric is inferior to the original. The recycled wool may be mixed with raw wool, wool noil, or another fiber such as cotton to increase the average fiber length. Such yarns are typically used as weft yarns with a cotton warp. This process was invented in the Heavy Woollen District of West Yorkshire and created a microeconomy in this area for many years.

Worsted is a strong, long-staple, combed wool yarn with a hard surface.

Woolen is a soft, short-staple, carded wool yarn typically used for knitting. In traditional weaving, woolen weft yarn (for softness and warmth) is frequently combined with a worsted warp yarn for strength on the loom.

==Uses==
In addition to clothing, wool has been used for blankets, suits, horse rugs, saddle cloths, carpeting, insulation and upholstery. Dyed wool can be used to create other forms of art such as wet and needle felting. Wool felt covers piano hammers, and it is used to absorb odors and noise in heavy machinery and stereo speakers. Ancient Greeks lined their helmets with felt, and Roman legionnaires used breastplates made of wool felt.

Wool as well as cotton has also been traditionally used for cloth diapers. Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and the interior of the wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry. Wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor. Some modern cloth diapers use felted wool fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.

Initial studies of woollen underwear have found it prevented heat and sweat rashes because it more readily absorbs the moisture than other fibers.

As an animal protein, wool can be used as a soil fertilizer, being a slow-release source of nitrogen.

Researchers at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology school of fashion and textiles have discovered a blend of wool and Kevlar, the synthetic fiber widely used in body armor, was lighter, cheaper and worked better in damp conditions than Kevlar alone. Kevlar, when used alone, loses about 20% of its effectiveness when wet, so required an expensive waterproofing process. Wool increased friction in a vest with 28–30 layers of fabric, to provide the same level of bullet resistance as 36 layers of Kevlar alone.

==Events==

A buyer of Merino wool, Ermenegildo Zegna, has offered awards for Australian wool producers. In 1963, the first Ermenegildo Zegna Perpetual Trophy was presented in Tasmania for growers of &quot;Superfine skirted Merino fleece&quot;. In 1980, a national award, the Ermenegildo Zegna Trophy for Extrafine Wool Production, was launched. In 2004, this award became known as the Ermenegildo Zegna Unprotected Wool Trophy. In 1998, an Ermenegildo Zegna Protected Wool Trophy was launched for fleece from sheep coated for around nine months of the year.

In 2002, the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy was launched for wool that is 13.9 microns or finer. Wool from Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, and South Africa may enter, and a winner is named from each country. In April 2008, New Zealand won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum Trophy for the first time with a fleece that measured 10.8 microns. This contest awards the winning fleece weight with the same weight in gold as a prize, hence the name.

In 2010, an ultrafine, 10-micron fleece, from Windradeen, near Pyramul, New South Wales, won the Ermenegildo Zegna Vellus Aureum International Trophy.

Since 2000, Loro Piana has awarded a cup for the world&#x27;s finest bale of wool that produces just enough fabric for 50 tailor-made suits. The prize is awarded to an Australian or New Zealand wool grower who produces the year&#x27;s finest bale.

The New England Merino Field days which display local studs, wool, and sheep are held during January, in even numbered years around the Walcha, New South Wales district. The Annual Wool Fashion Awards, which showcase the use of Merino wool by fashion designers, are hosted by the city of Armidale, New South Wales, in March each year. This event encourages young and established fashion designers to display their talents. During each May, Armidale hosts the annual New England Wool Expo to display wool fashions, handicrafts, demonstrations, shearing competitions, yard dog trials, and more.

In July, the annual Australian Sheep and Wool Show is held in Bendigo, Victoria. This is the largest sheep and wool show in the world, with goats and alpacas, as well as woolcraft competitions and displays, fleece competitions, sheepdog trials, shearing, and wool handling. The largest competition in the world for objectively measured fleeces is the Australian Fleece Competition, which is held annually at Bendigo. In 2008, 475 entries came from all states of Australia, with first and second prizes going to the Northern Tablelands fleeces.

* Spring – Bohemond I, Norman prince of Antioch, is released from Seljuk imprisonment at Niksar, after a ransom is paid of 100,000 gold pieces. During his absence, Tancred (Bohemond&#x27;s nephew) attacks the Byzantines, and re-captures the cities of Tarsus, Adana and Mamistra in Cilicia. Tancred is deprived of his lordship by Bohemond&#x27;s return, and is rewarded with a small fief within the Principality of Antioch.
* The Crusaders under Raymond IV invade the Beqaa Valley and capture Tortosa to isolate Tripoli. Raymond expands towards the Orontes River, and begins to build a castle on the Mons Peregrinus which helps in the Siege of Tripoli (see 1102). Emperor Alexios I supports the Crusaders by sending a Byzantine fleet (ten ships) to blockade the port of Tripoli.
* Summer – The Crusaders led by Bohemond I and Joscelin of Courtenay raid the territory of Aleppo to gain supplies. They capture the town of Muslimiyah, and extract a large tribute. Sultan Fakhr al-Mulk Radwan, the Seljuk ruler of Aleppo, agrees to pay 7,000 gold pieces and ten horses to the Crusaders while Bohemond agrees to release all Seljuk prisoners captured at Muslimiyah.

==Events of Toba&#x27;s life==
When his mother died, his grandfather, former-Emperor Shirakawa, took him under his care and raised him.

* August 9, 1107 (&quot;Kajō 2, 19th day of the 7th month&quot;): In the 21st year of Emperor Horikawa&#x27;s reign (堀河天皇21年), the emperor (&quot;tennō&quot;) died at the age of 29; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his only son. Shortly thereafter, Emperor Toba is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).

During the initial years of Toba&#x27;s reign, the actual power was held by his grandfather, the &quot;retired&quot; Emperor Shirakawa, in a process known as cloistered rule.

* 1110 (&quot;Ten&#x27;ei 3, 6th month&quot;): The Miidera-ji burned down. This was the second time the temple was destroyed by fire, the first time being in 1081.
* February 25, 1123 (&quot;Hōan 4, 28th day of the 1st month&quot;): In the 17th year of Emperor Toba&#x27;s reign (鳥羽天皇17年), Toba was forced to abdicate by his grandfather, retired-Emperor Shirakawa. Toba gave up the throne in favor of his son Akihito, who would become Emperor Sutoku. Toba was only 20 years old when he renounced his title; and he had already reigned for 16 years: two in the &quot;nengō&quot; &quot;Tennin&quot;, three in &quot;Ten&#x27;ei&quot;, five in the &quot;nengō&quot; &quot;Eikyū&quot;, two in &quot;Gen&#x27;ei&quot;, and four in the &quot;nengō&quot; &quot;Hōan.&quot; At this time, Toba took the title &quot;Daijō-tennō.&quot; The succession (&quot;senso&quot;) was received by his son.
* 1123 (&quot;Hōan 4, 2nd month&quot;): Emperor Sutoku is said to have acceded to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 1129 (&quot;Daiji 4&quot;): &quot;retired&quot; Emperor Shirakawa died; and Toba himself began to rule as cloistered emperor. Toba continued to hold power through the reigns of three emperors, Emperor Sutoku, Emperor Konoe, and Emperor Go-Shirakawa.
* 1134 (&quot;Chōshō 3&quot;): The former-Emperor Toba made a pilgrimage to the Kumano Shrines. He was accompanied by &quot;sadaijin&quot; Hanazono no Arahito and &quot;udaijin&quot; Naka-no-in Munetada. The excursion was enjoyed by all, and great quantities of sake were consumed.

===Kugyō===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras. Even during those years in which the court&#x27;s actual influence outside the palace walls was minimal, the hierarchic organization persisted.

In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Toba&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included:
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Fujiwara Tadazane, 1078–1162.
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara Tadazane.
* &quot;Kampaku&quot;, Fujiwara Tadamichi, 1097–1164.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara Tadazane.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara Tadamichi.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;, Hanazono no Arahito.
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;, Naka-no-in Munetada.
* &quot;Naidaijin&quot;
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Toba&#x27;s reign==
The years of Toba&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.
* &quot;Kajō&quot; (1106–1108)
* &quot;Tennin&quot; (1108–1110)
* &quot;Ten-ei&quot; (1110–1113)
* &quot;Eikyū&quot; (1113–1118)
* &quot;Gen&#x27;ei&quot; (1118–1120)
* &quot;Hōan&quot; (1120–1124)

<text>was the 75th emperor of Japan, according to the traditional order of succession.

Sutoku&#x27;s reign spanned the years from 1123 through 1142.

==Genealogy==
Before his ascension to the Chrysanthemum Throne, his personal name (his &quot;imina&quot;) was Akihito (顕仁). Sutoku was the eldest son of Emperor Toba. Some old texts say he was instead the son of Toba&#x27;s grandfather, Emperor Shirakawa.

*Chūgū: Fujiwara no Kiyoko (藤原 聖子) later Kōkamon&#x27;in (皇嘉門院), Fujiwara no Tadamichi&#x27;s daughter
* Hyounosuke-no-Tsubone (兵衛佐局), Minamoto no Masamune&#x27;s adopted daughter
** First son: Imperial (1140–1162).
* Mikawa-dono (三河), Minamoto no Morotsune&#x27;s daughter
** Fifth Son: Kakue (覚恵; 1151–1184)
* Karasuma-no-Tsubone (烏丸局)

==Events of Sutoku&#x27;s life==

* February 25, 1123 (&quot;Hōan 4, 28th day of the 1st month&quot;): In the 16th year of Emperor Toba&#x27;s reign (鳥羽天皇二十五年), he abdicated; and the succession (‘‘senso’’) was received by his son, aged 3.
* Hōan 4, in the 2nd month (1123): Emperor Sutoku is said to have acceded to the throne (‘‘sokui’’).
* 1124 (&quot;Tenji 1, 2nd month&quot;): Former-Emperor Shirakawa and former-Emperor Toba went in carriages to outside the city where they could all together enjoy contemplating the flowers. Taiken-mon&#x27;in (? – August 26, 1145) (formerly Fujiwara no Shōshi), who was Toba&#x27;s empress and Sutoku&#x27;s mother, joined the procession along with many other women of the court. Their cortege was brilliant and colorful. A great many men of the court in hunting clothes followed the ladies in this parade. Fujiwara no Tadamichi then followed in a carriage, accompanied by bands of musicians and women who were to sing for the emperors.
* 1124 (&quot;Tenji 1, 10th month&quot;): Shirakawa visited Mount Kōya.
* 1125 (&quot;Tenji 2, 10th month&quot;): The emperor visited Iwashimizu Shrine and the Kamo Shrines; and afterwards, he also visited the shrines Hirano, Ōharano, Mutsunoo, Kitano, Gion and several others.
* 1128 (&quot;Daiji 3, 3rd month&quot;): Taiken-mon&#x27;in ordered the construction of Enshō-ji in fulfillment of a sacred vow. This was one in a series of &quot;sacred vow temples&quot; (&quot;gogan-ji&quot;) built by imperial command following a precedent established by Emperor Shirakawa&#x27;s Hosshō-ji.
* 1128 (&quot;Daiji 3, 6th month&quot;): Fujiwara no Tadamichi is relieved of his responsibilities and duties as &quot;sesshō&quot; (regent); and simultaneously, Tadamichi is named &quot;kampaku.&quot;
* August 17, 1135 (&quot;Hōen 1, 7th day of the 7th month&quot;): Former-Emperor Shirakawa died at the age of 77.
* 1141 (&quot;Eiji 1, 3rd month&quot;): The former emperor Toba accepted the tonsure in becoming a monk at the age of 39.

In 1151, Sutoku ordered Waka imperial anthology &quot;Shika Wakashū&quot;.

In 1156, after being defeated by forces loyal to Emperor Go-Shirakawa in the Hōgen Rebellion, he was exiled to Sanuki Province (modern-day Kagawa prefecture on the island of Shikoku).
Emperor Sutoku&#x27;s reign lasted for 19 years: 2 years in the &quot;nengō&quot; &quot;Tenji&quot;, 5 years in &quot;Daiji&quot;, 1 year in &quot;&#x27;Tenshō&quot;, 3 years in &quot;Chōshō&quot;, 6 years in Hōen, and 1 year in &quot;Eiji&quot;.
The site of Sutoku&#x27;s grave is settled. This emperor is traditionally venerated at a memorial Shinto shrine (&quot;misasagi&quot;) in Sakaide, Kagawa. He was also enshrined (or sealed away ... ) in Shiramine Shrine in Kyoto and Kotohira-gū in Kagawa Prefecture. The former is also associated with the god of football, worshipped by Kuge clan Asukai in times of yore, while the latter enshrined Ō-mono-nushi-no-mikoto, a god known to have restored harmony in Yamato (or blackmailed Emperor Sujin ... ) in exchange for worship and nepotism.

The Imperial Household Agency designates this location as Sutoku&#x27;s mausoleum. It is formally named &quot;Shiramine no misasagi&quot;.

===&quot;Kugyō&quot;===
&quot;Kugyō&quot; (公卿) is a collective term for the very few most powerful men attached to the court of the Emperor of Japan in pre-Meiji eras.
In general, this elite group included only three to four men at a time. These were hereditary courtiers whose experience and background would have brought them to the pinnacle of a life&#x27;s career. During Sutoku&#x27;s reign, this apex of the &quot;Daijō-kan&quot; included: 
* &quot;Sesshō&quot;, Fujiwara no Tadamichi, 1097–1164.
* &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Tadamichi.
* &quot;Sadaijin&quot;
* &quot;Udaijin&quot;
* &quot;Nadaijin&quot;, Fujiwara no Yorinaga, 1120–1156.
* &quot;Dainagon&quot;

==Eras of Sutoku&#x27;s reign==
The years of Sutoku&#x27;s reign are more specifically identified by more than one era name or &quot;nengō&quot;.

* &quot;Hōen&quot; (1135–1141)
* &quot;Eiji&quot; (1141–1142)

==Legends==

After Sutoku&#x27;s abdication and exile, he devoted himself to monastic life. He copied numerous scriptures and offered them to the court. Fearing that the scriptures were cursed, the court refused to accept them. Snubbed, Sutoku was said to have resented the court and, upon his death, became an . Everything from the subsequent fall in fortune of the Imperial court, the rise of the samurai powers, droughts and internal unrests were blamed on his haunting.

Along with Sugawara no Michizane and Taira no Masakado, he is often called one of the “”.

<doc id="38436" wikidata="Q2272343" url="?curid=38436" title="Half-reaction">
<text>In chemistry, a half reaction (or half-cell reaction) is either the oxidation or reduction reaction component of a redox reaction. A half reaction is obtained by considering the change in oxidation states of individual substances involved in the redox reaction.
Often, the concept of half reactions is used to describe what occurs in an electrochemical cell, such as a Galvanic cell battery. Half reactions can be written to describe both the metal undergoing oxidation (known as the anode) and the metal undergoing reduction (known as the cathode).

Half reactions are often used as a method of balancing redox reactions. For oxidation-reduction reactions in acidic conditions, after balancing the atoms and oxidation numbers, one will need to add ions to balance the hydrogen ions in the half reaction. For oxidation-reduction reactions in basic conditions, after balancing the atoms and oxidation numbers, first treat it as an acidic solution and then add ions to balance the ions in the half reactions (which would give ).

==Example: Zn and Cu Galvanic cell==
Consider the Galvanic cell shown in the adjacent image: it is constructed with a piece of zinc (Zn) submerged in a solution of zinc sulfate () and a piece of copper (Cu) submerged in a solution of copper(II) sulfate (). The overall reaction is:

:&lt;chem&gt;Zn_{(s)}{} + CuSO4_{(aq)} -&gt; ZnSO4_{(aq)}{} + Cu_{(s)}&lt;/chem&gt;

At the Zn anode, oxidation takes place (the metal loses electrons). This is represented in the following oxidation half reaction (note that the electrons are on the products side):

:&lt;chem&gt;Zn_{(s)} -&gt; Zn^2+ + 2e-&lt;/chem&gt;

At the Cu cathode, reduction takes place (electrons are accepted). This is represented in the following reduction half reaction (note that the electrons are on the reactants side):

:&lt;chem&gt;Cu^2+ + 2e- -&gt; Cu_{(s)}&lt;/chem&gt;

==Example: oxidation of magnesium==
Consider the example burning of magnesium ribbon (Mg). When magnesium burns, it combines with oxygen () from the air to form magnesium oxide (MgO) according to the following equation:

:&lt;chem&gt;2Mg_{(s)}{} + O2_{(g)} -&gt; 2MgO_{(s)}&lt;/chem&gt;

Magnesium oxide is an ionic compound containing and ions whereas and are elements with no charges. 
The with zero charge gains a +2 charge going from the reactant side to product side, and the with zero charge gains a –2 charge. This is because when becomes , it loses 2 electrons. Since there are 2 Mg on left side, a total of 4 electrons are lost according to the following oxidation half reaction:

:&lt;chem&gt;2Mg_{(s)} -&gt; 2Mg^2+ + 4e-&lt;/chem&gt;

On the other hand, was reduced: its oxidation state goes from 0 to -2. Thus, a reduction half reaction can be written for the O2 as it gains 4 electrons:

:&lt;chem&gt;O2_{(g)}{} + 4e- -&gt; 2O^2-&lt;/chem&gt;

The overall reaction is the sum of both half reactions:

:&lt;chem&gt;2Mg_{(s)}{} + O2_{(g)}{} + 4e- -&gt; 2Mg^2+ + 2O^2- + 4e-&lt;/chem&gt;

When chemical reaction, especially, redox reaction takes place, we do not see the electrons as they appear and disappear during the course of the reaction. What we see is the reactants (starting material) and end products. Due to this, electrons appearing on both sides of the equation are canceled. After canceling, the equation is re-written as

:&lt;chem&gt;2Mg_{(s)}{} + O2_{(g)} -&gt; 2Mg^2+ + 2O^2-&lt;/chem&gt;

Two ions, positive () and negative () exist on product side and they combine immediately to form a compound magnesium oxide (MgO) due to their opposite charges (electrostatic attraction). In any given oxidation-reduction reaction, there are two half reactions—oxidation half reaction and reduction half reaction. The sum of these two half reactions is the oxidation–reduction reaction.

==Half-reaction balancing method==
Consider the reaction below:

:&lt;chem&gt;Cl2 + 2Fe^2+ -&gt; 2Cl- + 2Fe^3+&lt;/chem&gt;

The two elements involved, iron and chlorine, each change oxidation state; iron from +2 to +3, chlorine from 0 to −1. There are then effectively two &quot;half&quot; reactions occurring. These changes can be represented in formulas by inserting appropriate electrons into each half reaction:

:formula_1

Given two half reactions it is possible, with knowledge of appropriate electrode potentials, to arrive at the complete (original) reaction the same way. The decomposition of a reaction into half reactions is key to understanding a variety of chemical processes. For example, in the above reaction, it can be shown that this is a redox reaction in which Fe is oxidised, and Cl is reduced. Note the transfer of electrons from Fe to Cl. Decomposition is also a way to simplify the balancing of a chemical equation. A chemist can atom balance and charge balance one piece of an equation at a time.

For example:
* becomes 
* is added to 
* and finally becomes 

It is also possible and sometimes necessary to consider a half reaction in either basic or acidic conditions, as there may be an acidic or basic electrolyte in the redox reaction. Due to this electrolyte it may be more difficult to satisfy the balance of both the atoms and charges. This is done by adding , and/or to either side of the reaction until both atoms and charges are balanced.

Consider the half reaction below:

: &lt;chem&gt;PbO2 -&gt; PbO&lt;/chem&gt;

, and can be used to balance the charges and atoms in basic conditions, as long as it is assumed that the reaction is in water.

: &lt;chem&gt;2e- + H2O + PbO2 -&gt; PbO + 2OH-&lt;/chem&gt;

Again consider the half reaction below:

: &lt;chem&gt;PbO2 -&gt; PbO&lt;/chem&gt;

, and can be used to balance the charges and atoms in acidic conditions, as long as it is assumed that the reaction is in water.

: &lt;chem&gt;2e- + 2H+ + PbO2 -&gt; PbO + H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

Notice that both sides are both charge balanced and atom balanced.

Often there will be both and present in acidic and basic conditions but that the resulting reaction of the two ions will yield water, (shown below):

: &lt;chem&gt;H+ + OH- -&gt; H2O&lt;/chem&gt;

<text>Type XXI submarines were a class of German diesel–electric &quot;Elektroboot&quot; (German: &quot;electric boat&quot;) submarines designed during the Second World War. One hundred and eighteen were completed, with four being combat-ready. During the war only two were put into active service and went on patrols, but these were not used in combat.

They were the first submarines designed to operate primarily submerged, rather than spending most of their time as surface ships that could submerge for brief periods as a means of escaping detection. They incorporated many batteries to increase the time they could spend submerged, to as much as several days, and they only needed to surface to periscope depth for recharging via a snorkel. The design included many general improvements as well: much greater underwater speed by an improved hull design, greatly improved diving times, power-assisted torpedo reloading and greatly improved crew accommodations. However, the design was also flawed in many ways, with the submarines being mechanically unreliable and, according to post-war analysis, vulnerable to combat damage. The Type XXI submarines were also rushed into production before design work was complete, and the inexperienced facilities which constructed the boats were unable to meet necessary quality standards.

After the war, several navies obtained Type XXIs and operated them for decades in various roles, while large navies introduced new submarine designs based on them. These include the Soviet , American , British &quot;Porpoise&quot;, and Swedish classes, all based on the Type XXI design to some extent.

==Description==
The main features of the Type XXI were the hydrodynamically streamlined hull and conning tower and the large number of battery cells, roughly triple that of the Type VII submarine. This gave these boats great underwater range and dramatically reduced the time spent on or near the surface. They could travel submerged at about for about 75 hours before recharging batteries, which took less than five hours using the snorkel due to the new super-charged diesel engines. Being designed primarily for submerged use, the Type XXI&#x27;s maximum surface speed (15.6 knots) was lower than that of the Type IX (18.2 knots) but its submerged speed was more than twice that of the Type IX (17.2 knots versus 7.7 knots) because they were equipped with much more powerful electric drive motors and had less drag.

The Type XXI was also much quieter than the VIIC, making it more difficult to detect when submerged, and the design eliminated protruding components that had created drag in earlier models. The new, streamlined hull design allowed submerged speed of , versus for the Type VIIC. The ability to outrun many surface ships while submerged, combined with improved dive times (also a product of the new hull form), made the Type XXI much more difficult to pursue and destroy. It also provided a sprint ability when positioning itself for an attack. Older boats had to surface to sprint into position. This often revealed a boat&#x27;s location, especially after aircraft became available for convoy escort. The Type XXI was also equipped with a pair of electric &quot;creep motors&quot; for silent running.

The Type XXI was equipped with six bow torpedo tubes (instead of the more common four in German submarines) and carried 23 torpedoes. 
It featured an electric torpedo-reloading system that allowed all six bow torpedo tubes to be reloaded faster than a Type VIIC could reload one tube. The Type XXI could fire 18 torpedoes in less than 20 minutes. The class also featured a very sensitive passive sonar for the time, housed in the &quot;chin&quot; of the hull.

The Type XXIs also had better facilities than previous U-boat classes, with much roomier crew berths, and a freezer to prevent food spoilage. The increased capacity allowed for a crew of 57.

A post-war assessment of the Type XXI by the United States Navy concluded that while the design had some admirable features, it was seriously flawed. The submarines&#x27; engines were underpowered, which limited the surface speed and increased the time required to charge the batteries. The hydraulic system was unduly complex, and its main elements were located outside the pressure hull. This made the system highly vulnerable to corrosion and damage. The snorkel was also badly designed, and difficult to use in practice.

==Construction==

This was the first U-boat to be constructed of modular components to allow for the manufacture of the various components in different factories and subsequent assembly at the shipyard.

Between 1943 and 1945, 118 boats were assembled by Blohm &amp; Voss of Hamburg, AG Weser of Bremen and Schichau-Werke of Danzig. Each hull was constructed from nine prefabricated sections with final assembly at the shipyards. This new method allowed for a hypothetical construction time of less than six months per vessel, but in practice all the assembled U-boats were plagued with severe quality problems that required extensive post-production work and time to rectify. One of the reasons for these shortcomings was that sections were made by companies having little experience with shipbuilding, after a decision by Albert Speer. As a result, of 118 Type XXIs constructed, only four were fit for combat before the Second World War ended in Europe. Of these, only two conducted combat patrols and neither sank any Allied ships. Post-war assessments by the US Navy and British Royal Navy also found that the completed submarines had poor structural integrity due to the manufacturing problems. This rendered the submarines highly vulnerable to depth charges, and gave them a lesser maximum diving depth than earlier U-boat designs.

It was planned that final assembly of Type XXI boats would eventually be carried out in the Valentin submarine pens, a massive, bomb–hardened concrete bunker built at the small port of Farge, near Bremen. The pens were constructed between 1943 and 1945, using about 10,000 concentration camp prisoners and prisoners of war as forced labour. The facility was 90% completed when, during March 1945, it was heavily damaged by Allied bombing with Grand Slam &quot;earthquake&quot; bombs and abandoned. A few weeks later the area was captured by the British Army.

Due to the combination of design and construction problems, historian Clay Blair judged that &quot;the XXI could not have made a big difference in the Battle of the Atlantic.

==Sensors==

===Radar detector===
The FuMB Ant 3 &quot;Bali&quot; radar detector and antenna was located on top of the snorkel head.

===Radar transmitter===
The Type XXI boats were fitted with the FuMO 65 &quot;Hohentwiel&quot; U1 with the Type F432 D2 radar transmitter.
==Wartime and post-war service==

===Germany===
 and were the only Type XXIs used for war patrols, and neither sank any ships. The commander of &quot;U-2511&quot; claimed the U-boat had a British cruiser in his sights on 4 May when news of the German cease-fire was received. He further claimed he made a practice attack before leaving the scene undetected.

During 1957, , which had been scuttled at the end of the war, was raised and refitted as research vessel &quot;Wilhelm Bauer&quot; of the &quot;Bundesmarine&quot;. It was operated by both military and civilian crews for research purposes until 1982. During 1984, it was made available for display to the public by the &quot;Deutsches Schiffahrtsmuseum&quot; (German Maritime Museum) in Bremerhaven, Germany.

===France===
 became . It was used for active service during the Suez Crisis in 1956, and remained in commission until 1967. It was scrapped in 1969.

===Soviet Union===
Four Type XXI boats were assigned to the USSR by the Potsdam Agreement; these were , , , and , which were commissioned into the Soviet Navy as , , &quot;B-29&quot;, and (later &quot;B-100&quot;) respectively. However, Western intelligence believed the Soviets had acquired several more Type XXI boats; a review by the U.S. Joint Intelligence Committee for the Joint Chiefs of Staff during January 1948 estimated the Soviet Navy then had 15 Type XXIs operational, could complete construction of 6 more within 2 months, and could build another 39 within a year and a half from prefabricated sections, since several factories producing Type XXI components and the assembly yard at Danzig had been captured by the Soviets at the end of World War II. &quot;U-3538&quot; — &quot;U-3557&quot; (respectively &quot;TS-5&quot; – &quot;TS-19&quot; and &quot;TS-32&quot; – &quot;TS-38&quot;) remained incomplete at Danzig and were scrapped or sunk during 1947. The four boats assigned by Potsdam were used in trials and tests until 1955, then scuttled or used for weapon testing between 1958 and 1973. The Type XXI design formed the basis for several Soviet design projects, Projects 611, 613, 614, 633, and 644. These became the submarine classes known by their NATO codes as , and submarine classes.

===United Kingdom===
 was commissioned into the Royal Navy as . It was used for tests until being scrapped during November 1949.

===United States===

The United States Navy acquired and , operating them both in the Atlantic Ocean. During November 1946 President Harry S. Truman visited &quot;U-2513&quot;; the submarine dived to with the President aboard. &quot;U-2513&quot; was sunk as a target on 7 October 1951; &quot;U-3008&quot; was sold for scrap on 15 September 1955.

==Survivor==
The only boat to survive intact is (ex-&quot;U-2540&quot;), at the German Maritime Museum in Bremerhaven. Records indicate that this sub was scuttled by her crew in 1945, salvaged in 1957 and refurbished for use by the West German &quot;Bundesmarine&quot; until retirement in 1982. She was then modified to appear in wartime configuration for exhibition purposes.

==Notable wrecks==
The wrecks of several Type XXI boats are known to exist. During 1985, it was discovered that the partially scrapped remains of , , and were still in the partially demolished &quot;Elbe II&quot; U-boat bunker in Hamburg. The bunker has since been filled in with gravel, although even that did not initially deter many souvenir hunters who measured the position of open hatches and dug down to them to allow the removal of artifacts. The wrecks now lie beneath a car park (parking lot), making them inaccessible.

 lies in of water west of Key West, Florida. The boat has been visited by divers, but the depth makes this very difficult and the site is considered suitable for only advanced divers. Four other boats lie off the coast of Northern Ireland, where they were sunk during 1946 as part of Operation Deadlight. Both and were found by nautical archaeologist Innes McCartney during his &quot;Operation Deadlight&quot; expeditions between 2001 and 2003. Both were found to be in good condition. In April 2018 the wreck of was found north of Skagen in Denmark.

==Influences==
The Type XXI design directly influenced advanced post-war submarines, the Greater Underwater Propulsion Power Program (GUPPY) improvements to the United States , , and -class submarines, and the Soviet submarine projects designated , , and by NATO. The Chinese-built Romeo-class submarines, and the subsequent , were based on Soviet blueprints.

<text>Albert I of Habsburg () (July 12551 May 1308) was a Duke of Austria and Styria from 1282 and King of Germany from 1298 until his assassination. He was the eldest son of King Rudolf I of Germany and his first wife Gertrude of Hohenberg. Sometimes referred to as &#x27;Albert the One-eyed&#x27; because of a battle injury that left him with a hollow eye socket and a permanent snarl.

==Biography==

From 1273 Albert ruled as a landgrave over his father&#x27;s Swabian (Further Austrian) possessions in Alsace. In 1282 his father, the first German monarch from the House of Habsburg, invested him and his younger brother Rudolf II with the duchies of Austria and Styria, which he had seized from late King Ottokar II of Bohemia and defended in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld. By the 1283 Treaty of Rheinfelden his father entrusted Albert with their sole government, while Rudolf II ought to be compensated by the Further Austrian Habsburg home territories – which, however, never happened until his death in 1290. Albert and his Swabian &quot;ministeriales&quot; appear to have ruled the Austrian and Styrian duchies with conspicuous success, overcoming the resistance by local nobles.

King Rudolf I was unable to secure the succession to the German throne for his son, especially due to the objections raised by Ottokar&#x27;s son King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia, and the plans to install Albert as successor of the assassinated King Ladislaus IV of Hungary in 1290 also failed. Upon Rudolf&#x27;s death in 1291, the Prince-electors, fearing Albert&#x27;s power and the implementation of a hereditary monarchy, chose Count Adolf of Nassau-Weilburg as King of the Romans. An uprising among his Styrian dependents compelled Albert to recognize the sovereignty of his rival and to confine himself for a time to the government of the Habsburg lands at Vienna.
He did not abandon his hopes of the throne, however, which were eventually realised: In 1298, he was chosen German king by some of the princes, who were bothered about Adolf&#x27;s attempts to gain his own power bases in the lands of Thuringia and Meissen, again led by the Bohemian king Wenceslaus II. The armies of the rival kings met at the Battle of Göllheim near Worms, where Adolf was defeated and slain.

Submitting to a new election but securing the support of several influential princes by making extensive promises, he was chosen at the Imperial City of Frankfurt on 27 July 1298, and crowned at Aachen Cathedral on 24 August.

Although a hard, stern man, Albert had a keen sense of justice when his own interests were not involved, and few of the German kings possessed so practical an intelligence. He encouraged the cities, and not content with issuing proclamations against private war, formed alliances with the princes in order to enforce his decrees. The serfs, whose wrongs seldom attracted notice in an age indifferent to the claims of common humanity, found a friend in this severe monarch, and he protected even the despised and persecuted Jews. Stories of his cruelty and oppression in the Swiss cantons (cf. William Tell) did not appear until the 16th century, and are now regarded as legendary. 

Albert sought to play an important part in European affairs. He seemed at first inclined to press a quarrel with the Kingdom of France over the Burgundian frontier, but the refusal of Pope Boniface VIII to recognize his election led him to change his policy, and, in 1299, he made a treaty with King Philip IV, by which his son Rudolph was to marry Blanche, the King&#x27;s half-sister. He afterwards became estranged from Philip, but in 1303, Boniface recognized him as German king and future emperor; in return, Albert recognized the authority of the pope alone to bestow the Imperial crown, and promised that none of his sons should be elected German king without papal consent.

Albert had failed in his attempt to seize the counties of Holland and Zeeland, as vacant fiefs of the Holy Roman Empire, on the death of Count John I in 1299, but in 1306 he secured the crown of Bohemia for his son Rudolph III on the death of King Wenceslaus III. He also renewed the claim made by his predecessor, Adolf, on Thuringia, and interfered in a quarrel over the succession to the Hungarian throne. The Thuringian attack ended in Albert&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Lucka in 1307 and, in the same year, the death of his son Rudolph weakened his position in eastern Europe. His action in abolishing all tolls established on the Rhine since 1250 led the Rhenish prince-archbishops and the Elector of the Palatinate to form a league against him. Aided by the Imperial cities, however, he soon crushed the rising.

== Death ==
Albert was on the way to suppress a revolt in Swabia when he was murdered on 1 May 1308, at Windisch on the Reuss, by his nephew Duke John, afterwards called &quot;the Parricide&quot; or &quot;John Parricida&quot;.

== Titles ==
His full name and titles were: &quot;Albert, by the grace of God, King of the Romans, Duke of Austria and Styria, Lord of Carniola, over the Wendish Mark and of Port Naon, Count of Habsburg and Kyburg, Landgrave of Alsace&quot;.

== Marriage and children ==
In 1274, Albert had married Elizabeth, daughter of Count Meinhard II of Tyrol, who was a descendant of the Babenberg margraves of Austria who predated the Habsburgs&#x27; rule. The baptismal name Leopold, patron saint margrave of Austria, was given to one of their sons. Queen Elizabeth was in fact better connected to mighty German rulers than her husband: she was a descendant of earlier German kings, including Emperor Henry IV; she was also a niece of the Wittelsbach dukes of Bavaria, Austria&#x27;s important neighbor.

Albert and Elizabeth had twelve children:
# Anna (1275, Vienna19 March 1327, Breslau), married:
## in Graz to Herman, Margrave of Brandenburg-Salzwedel;
## in Breslau 1310 to Henry VI the Good, Duke of Wrocław.

<text>Albert the Magnanimous , elected King of the Romans as Albert II (10 August 139727 October 1439), was a member of the House of Habsburg. By inheritance he became Albert V, Duke of Austria. Through his wife (&quot;jure uxoris&quot;) he also became King of Hungary, Croatia, Bohemia, and inherited a claim to the Duchy of Luxembourg.

==Biography==

Albert was born in Vienna as the son of Albert IV, Duke of Austria, and Joanna Sophia of Bavaria.

He succeeded to the Duchy of Austria at the age of seven on his father&#x27;s death in 1404. His uncle Duke William of Inner Austria, then head of the rivaling Leopoldinian line, served as regent for his nephew, followed by his brothers Leopold IV and Ernest the Iron in 1406. The quarrels between the brothers and their continued attempts to gain control over the Albertinian territories led to civil war-like conditions. Nevertheless, Albert, having received a good education, undertook the government of Austria proper on the occasion of Leopold&#x27;s death in 1411 and succeeded, with the aid of his advisers, in ridding the duchy of the evils which had arisen during his minority.

In 1422 Albert married Elisabeth of Luxemburg, the daughter and heiress of the King Sigismund of Hungary (later also Holy Roman Emperor and King of Bohemia), and his second wife, the Slovenian noblewoman Barbara of Celje. Besides Hungary, Albert&#x27;s marriage brought him claims to several Slavic kingdoms and principalities as well.
Albert assisted his father-in-law Sigismund in his campaigns against the Hussites, involving the Austrian duchy in the Hussite Wars. In return Sigismund designated him as his successor and granted him the title of a Margrave of Moravia in 1423. The Austrian lands were devastated several times and Albert also participated in the 1431 Battle of Domažlice where the Imperial troops suffered an embarrassing defeat. While his lands were harmed it was a showing of loyalty to the church as the church was trying to consolidate its influence and power.

When Sigismund died in 1437, Albert was crowned king of Hungary on 1 January 1438, and just as his predecessor did, he moved his court to the Hungarian Kingdom from where he later oversaw his other domains. Although crowned king of Bohemia six months after ascending to the Hungarian throne, he was unable to obtain possession of the country. He was engaged in warfare with the Bohemians and their Polish allies, when on 17 March 1438, he was elected as &quot;King of the Romans&quot; at Frankfurt. Albert was never crowned as Holy Roman Emperor.

Afterwards engaged in defending Hungary against the attacks of the Turks, he died on 27 October 1439 at Neszmély and was buried at Székesfehérvár. Albert was an energetic and warlike prince, whose short reign as a triple king gave great promise of usefulness for the Holy Roman Empire.

== The Hussite Wars and Widespread Persecution ==
Beginning with the First Crusade in the year 1095, those who were not adherents to the Catholic faith were deemed by the religious authorities to be heretics, and were to be persecuted, destroyed or converted. While the papal call for an end to heresy applied to Muslims traditionally, there was widespread violence against other religious and social groups. Jews and lepers were the main targets along with Muslims in the crusade to destroy &quot;devilry.&quot; The persecution of Jews came as no surprise in connection with the Hussite Wars. The call to arms against heretics meant the call to arms against all who are not Christian, with the hopes of their destruction or conversion. However, the crusaders saw that as an opportunity to convert all who were not Christian, the Jews and lepers included not just the intended Muslims. If the heretics did not convert to Christianity they were massacred, usually burned. This would apply later in the Hussite Wars, which was a continuation of the crusades, as Albert II came to power as Duke of Austria, who was a willing participant in the fight against heresy. The Hussite Wars is a series of crusades against heresy in the Middle Ages spanning from 1418-1437 and through his loyalty to the church and the persecutive works of his contemporaries, he would embark on his own persecutive journey against the Jews.

==Jewish persecution==
Beginning in the 11th century, Jews started to define themselves as a people, garnering a foothold as moneylenders within their communities. By the 13th century, Jews in Austria and elsewhere in Europe had established themselves as a group with their own social identity. However, with this newfound identity, persecution followed. It was during this period that Jewish people began to suffer from plundering and the theft of their lands, as they came to be regarded as outsiders. However, the first major instance of Jewish persecution began with the First Crusade in the fall of 1095, which is thought by historians to have been the first major incident in what became a long list of anti-Jewish persecutions involving violence during the High Middle Ages in Europe. Summoned by Pope Urban II with the aim of conquering the Holy Land, violence against the Jewish population was inspired by rumours of a papal encouragement to use violence against non-Christians, although if true this was likely meant to refer to Muslims. Pogroms were also organized to destroy Jewish communities, which were highly effective. Over time, historiographical works have tended to focus on the German-Austrian massacres due to how much documentary evidence has survived. These German-Austrian massacres were arguably a great influence on Albert V and his Jewish persecutions and expulsions. The persecution of Jews would grow to encompass all of Europe for many centuries, which Albert V as Duke of Austria also took part in when he came to power.

Though the Jews in the Austrian duchy had been subject to local persecutions during the 13th and 14th century, their position remained relatively safe. Jewish communities prospered in several towns like Krems or the area around the &quot;Judenplatz&quot; at Vienna. During the confusion after the death of Duke Albert IV in 1404 their situation worsened sharply, culminating in the blaze of the Vienna synagogue on 5 November 1406, followed by riots and lootings.

With the ordering of campaign preparations against the Hussites by King Sigismund in the beginning of the 15th century taxes would be used to fund a crusade army. Albert V of Austria would follow suit, keeping his good standing with the Catholic Church while he was in power. When Albert V came of age in 1411 and interfered in the Hussite Wars, he repeatedly established new taxes imposed on the Jewish community to finance his campaigns. Taxes would be established to destroy &quot;devilry&quot; and &quot;imprudence&quot;. Like the Hussites, Jews were seen at this point as an enemy to Christendom. After the Hussites had devastated the duchy, the Austrian Jews were accused of collaboration and arms trade in favor of the enemies. The accusations of a host desecration at Enns in 1420 gave Albert pretext for the destruction of the Jewish community.

According to the 1463 &quot;Chronica Austriae&quot; by chronicler Thomas Ebendorfer, the duke on 23 May 1420, at the behest of the Church, ordered the imprisonment and forcible conversion of the Jews. Those that had not converted or escaped were sent off in boats down the Danube, while wealthy Jews remained under arrest, several of them tortured and stripped of their property. The forced baptism of Jewish children was stopped on intervention by Pope Martin V. On 12 March 1421 Albert sentenced the remaining Jews to death. Ninety-two men and 120 women were burned at the stake south of the Vienna city walls on 12 March 1421. The Jews were placed under an &quot;eternal ban&quot; and their synagogue was demolished. The persecutions in several Austrian towns are explicitly described in a 16th-century script called &quot;Vienna Gesera&quot;.
==Full title==

Full titulature Albert possessed went as follows: &quot;Albert, by the grace of God elected King of the Romans, always August, King of Hungary, Dalmatia, Croatia, Rama, Serbia, Galicia, Lodomeria, Cumania and Bulgaria, elected King of Bohemia, duke of Austria, Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, margrave of Moravia, Lord of the Wendish March and Port Naon, Count of Habsburg, Tyrol, Ferrete and Kyburg, etc. Margrave of Burgau and landgrave of Alsace.&quot;

In practise he often used a shorter version: &quot;Albert, by the grace of God elected King of the Romans, always August, King of Hungary, Dalmatia and Croatia, etc. elected King of Bohemia, duke of Austria, Styria, Carinthia and Carniola, Margrave of Moravia and Count of Tyrol, etc.&quot;

==Family==

His children with Elizabeth of Luxembourg were:
* Anne of Austria (1432–1462), who married William III, Duke of Saxony. William became (1457–69) Duke of Luxembourg, in right of his wife
* Elisabeth (c. 1436–1439 to 1505), who married Casimir IV of Poland, and whose son Vladislaus II of Bohemia later became king of Bohemia and Hungary
* George (born and died at Vienna on 16 February 1435)
* Ladislas V Posthumus of Bohemia, King of Hungary and Bohemia

<doc id="38449" wikidata="Q382497" url="?curid=38449" title="Affine transformation">
<text>In Euclidean geometry, an affine transformation or affinity (from the Latin, &quot;affinis&quot;, &quot;connected with&quot;) is a geometric transformation that preserves lines and parallelism, but not necessarily Euclidean distances and angles.

More generally, an affine transformation is an automorphism of an affine space (Euclidean spaces are specific affine spaces), that is, a function which maps an affine space onto itself while preserving both the dimension of any affine subspaces (meaning that it sends points to points, lines to lines, planes to planes, and so on) and the ratios of the lengths of parallel line segments. Consequently, sets of parallel affine subspaces remain parallel after an affine transformation. An affine transformation does not necessarily preserve angles between lines or distances between points, though it does preserve ratios of distances between points lying on a straight line.

If is the point set of an affine space, then every affine transformation on can be represented as the composition of a linear transformation on and a translation of . Unlike a purely linear transformation, an affine transformation need not preserve the origin of the affine space. Thus, every linear transformation is affine, but not every affine transformation is linear.

Examples of affine transformations include translation, scaling, homothety, similarity, reflection, rotation, hyperbolic rotation, shear mapping, and compositions of them in any combination and sequence.

Viewing an affine space as the complement of a hyperplane at infinity of a projective space, the affine transformations are the projective transformations of that projective space that leave the hyperplane at infinity invariant, restricted to the complement of that hyperplane.

A generalization of an affine transformation is an affine map (or affine homomorphism or affine mapping) between two (potentially different) affine spaces over the same field . Let and be two affine spaces with and the point sets and and the respective associated vector spaces over the field . A map is an affine map if there exists a linear map such that for all in .

==Definition==
Let be an affine space over a field , and be its associated vector space. An affine transformation is a bijection from onto itself that is an affine map; this means that a linear map from to is well defined by the equation formula_1 here, as usual, the subtraction of two points denotes the free vector from the second point to the first one, and &quot;well-defined&quot; means that formula_2 implies that formula_3

If the dimension of is at least two, a &quot;semiaffine transformation&quot; of is a bijection from onto itself satisfying:
#For every -dimensional affine subspace of , then is also a -dimensional affine subspace of .
#If and are parallel affine subspaces of , then and are parallel.
These two conditions are satisfied by affine transformations, and express what is precisely meant by the expression that &quot; preserves parallelism&quot;.

These conditions are not independent as the second follows from the first. Furthermore, if the field has at least three elements, the first condition can be simplified to: is a collineation, that is, it maps lines to lines.

==Structure==
By the definition of an affine space, acts on , so that, for every pair formula_4 in there is associated a point in . We can denote this action by formula_5. Here we use the convention that formula_6 are two interchangeable notations for an element of . By fixing a point in one can define a function by . For any , this function is one-to-one, and so, has an inverse function given by formula_7. These functions can be used to turn into a vector space (with respect to the point ) by defining:
:* formula_8 and
:* formula_9
This vector space has origin and formally needs to be distinguished from the affine space , but common practice is to denote it by the same symbol and mention that it is a vector space &quot;after&quot; an origin has been specified. This identification permits points to be viewed as vectors and vice versa.

For any linear transformation of , we can define the function by
:formula_10

Then is an affine transformation of which leaves the point fixed. It is a linear transformation of , viewed as a vector space with origin .

Let be any affine transformation of . Pick a point in and consider the translation of by the vector formula_11, denoted by . Translations are affine transformations and the composition of affine transformations is an affine transformation. For this choice of , there exists a unique linear transformation of such that 
:formula_12
That is, an arbitrary affine transformation of is the composition of a linear transformation of (viewed as a vector space) and a translation of .

This representation of affine transformations is often taken as the definition of an affine transformation (with the choice of origin being implicit).

==Representation==
As shown above, an affine map is the composition of two functions: a translation and a linear map. Ordinary vector algebra uses matrix multiplication to represent linear maps, and vector addition to represent translations. Formally, in the finite-dimensional case, if the linear map is represented as a multiplication by an invertible matrix formula_13 and the translation as the addition of a vector formula_14, an affine map formula_15 acting on a vector formula_16 can be represented as

:formula_17

===Augmented matrix===
Using an augmented matrix and an augmented vector, it is possible to represent both the translation and the linear map using a single matrix multiplication. The technique requires that all vectors be augmented with a &quot;1&quot; at the end, and all matrices be augmented with an extra row of zeros at the bottom, an extra column—the translation vector—to the right, and a &quot;1&quot; in the lower right corner. If formula_13 is a matrix,

:formula_19

is equivalent to the following

:formula_20

The above-mentioned augmented matrix is called an &quot;affine transformation matrix&quot;. In the general case, when the last row vector is not restricted to be formula_21, the matrix becomes a &quot;projective transformation matrix&quot; (as it can also be used to perform projective transformations).

This representation exhibits the set of all invertible affine transformations as the semidirect product of formula_22 and formula_23. This is a group under the operation of composition of functions, called the affine group.

Ordinary matrix-vector multiplication always maps the origin to the origin, and could therefore never represent a translation, in which the origin must necessarily be mapped to some other point. By appending the additional coordinate &quot;1&quot; to every vector, one essentially considers the space to be mapped as a subset of a space with an additional dimension. In that space, the original space occupies the subset in which the additional coordinate is 1. Thus the origin of the original space can be found at formula_24. A translation within the original space by means of a linear transformation of the higher-dimensional space is then possible (specifically, a shear transformation). The coordinates in the higher-dimensional space are an example of homogeneous coordinates. If the original space is Euclidean, the higher dimensional space is a real projective space.

The advantage of using homogeneous coordinates is that one can combine any number of affine transformations into one by multiplying the respective matrices. This property is used extensively in computer graphics, computer vision and robotics.

====Example augmented matrix====
Suppose you have three points that define a non-degenerate triangle in a plane, or four points that define a non-degenerate tetrahedron in 3-dimensional space, or generally points , ..., that define a non-degenerate simplex in -dimensional space. Suppose you have corresponding destination points , ..., , where these new points can lie in a space with any number of dimensions. (Furthermore, the new points need not be distinct from each other and need not form a non-degenerate simplex.) The unique augmented matrix that achieves the affine transformation
formula_25
for every is
formula_26

==Properties==
=== Properties preserved ===
An affine transformation preserves:
# collinearity between points: three or more points which lie on the same line (called collinear points) continue to be collinear after the transformation.
# parallelism: two or more lines which are parallel, continue to be parallel after the transformation.
# convexity of sets: a convex set continues to be convex after the transformation. Moreover, the extreme points of the original set are mapped to the extreme points of the transformed set.
# ratios of lengths of parallel line segments: for distinct parallel segments defined by points formula_27 and formula_28, formula_29 and formula_30, the ratio of formula_31 and formula_32 is the same as that of formula_33 and formula_34.
# barycenters of weighted collections of points.

=== Groups ===
As an affine transformation is invertible, the square matrix formula_13 appearing in its matrix representation is invertible. The matrix representation of the inverse transformation is thus
:formula_36

The invertible affine transformations (of an affine space onto itself) form the affine group, which has the general linear group of degree formula_37 as subgroup and is itself a subgroup of the general linear group of degree formula_38.

The similarity transformations form the subgroup where formula_13 is a scalar times an orthogonal matrix. For example, if the affine transformation acts on the plane and if the determinant of formula_13 is 1 or −1 then the transformation is an equiareal mapping. Such transformations form a subgroup called the &quot;equi-affine group&quot;. A transformation that is both equi-affine and a similarity is an isometry of the plane taken with Euclidean distance.

Each of these groups has a subgroup of &quot;orientation-preserving&quot; or &quot;positive&quot; affine transformations: those where the determinant of formula_13 is positive. In the last case this is in 3D the group of rigid transformations (proper rotations and pure translations).

If there is a fixed point, we can take that as the origin, and the affine transformation reduces to a linear transformation. This may make it easier to classify and understand the transformation. For example, describing a transformation as a rotation by a certain angle with respect to a certain axis may give a clearer idea of the overall behavior of the transformation than describing it as a combination of a translation and a rotation. However, this depends on application and context.

==Affine maps==
An affine map formula_42 between two affine spaces is a map on the points that acts linearly on the vectors (that is, the vectors between points of the space). In symbols, &quot;formula_15&quot; determines a linear transformation &quot;formula_44&quot; such that, for any pair of points formula_45:

:formula_46
or
:formula_47.

We can interpret this definition in a few other ways, as follows.

If an origin formula_48 is chosen, and formula_49 denotes its image formula_50, then this means that for any vector formula_51:

:formula_52.

If an origin formula_53 is also chosen, this can be decomposed as an affine transformation formula_54 that sends formula_55, namely

:formula_56,

followed by the translation by a vector formula_57.

The conclusion is that, intuitively, formula_15 consists of a translation and a linear map.

===Alternative definition===
Given two affine spaces formula_59 and formula_60, over the same field, a function formula_61 is an affine map if and only if for every family formula_62 of weighted points in formula_59 such that 
: formula_64,

we have

: formula_65.

In other words, formula_15 preserves barycenters.

==History==
The word &quot;affine&quot; as a mathematical term is defined in connection with tangents to curves in Euler&#x27;s 1748 Introductio in analysin infinitorum. Felix Klein attributes the term &quot;affine transformation&quot; to Möbius and Gauss.

== Image transformation ==
In their applications to digital image processing, the affine transformations are analogous to printing on a sheet of rubber and stretching the sheet&#x27;s edges parallel to the plane. This transform relocates pixels requiring intensity interpolation to approximate the value of moved pixels, bicubic interpolation is the standard for image transformations in image processing applications. Affine transformations scale, rotate, translate, mirror and shear images as shown in the following examples:

The affine transforms are applicable to the registration process where two or more images are aligned (registered). An example of image registration is the generation of panoramic images that are the product of multiple images stitched together.

=== Affine warping ===

The affine transform preserves parallel lines. However, the stretching and shearing transformations warp shapes, as the following example shows:

This is an example of image warping. However, the affine transformations do not facilitate projection onto a curved surface or radial distortions.

==In the plane==
Affine transformations in two real dimensions include:
* pure translations,
* scaling in a given direction, with respect to a line in another direction (not necessarily perpendicular), combined with translation that is not purely in the direction of scaling; taking &quot;scaling&quot; in a generalized sense it includes the cases that the scale factor is zero (projection) or negative; the latter includes reflection, and combined with translation it includes glide reflection,
* rotation combined with a homothety and a translation,
* shear mapping combined with a homothety and a translation, or 
* squeeze mapping combined with a homothety and a translation.

To visualise the general affine transformation of the Euclidean plane, take labelled parallelograms &quot;ABCD&quot; and &quot;A′B′C′D′&quot;. Whatever the choices of points, there is an affine transformation &quot;T&quot; of the plane taking &quot;A&quot; to &quot;A′&quot;, and each vertex similarly. Supposing we exclude the degenerate case where &quot;ABCD&quot; has zero area, there is a unique such affine transformation &quot;T&quot;. Drawing out a whole grid of parallelograms based on &quot;ABCD&quot;, the image &quot;T&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) of any point &quot;P&quot; is determined by noting that &quot;T&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) = &quot;A′&quot;, &quot;T&quot; applied to the line segment &quot;AB&quot; is &quot;A′B′&quot;, &quot;T&quot; applied to the line segment &quot;AC&quot; is &quot;A′C′&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; respects scalar multiples of vectors based at &quot;A&quot;. [If &quot;A&quot;, &quot;E&quot;, &quot;F&quot; are collinear then the ratio length(&quot;AF&quot;)/length(&quot;AE&quot;) is equal to length(&quot;A&quot;′&quot;F&quot;′)/length(&quot;A&quot;′&quot;E&quot;′).] Geometrically &quot;T&quot; transforms the grid based on &quot;ABCD&quot; to that based in &quot;A′B′C′D′&quot;.

Affine transformations do not respect lengths or angles; they multiply area by a constant factor

:area of &quot;A′B′C′D′&quot; / area of &quot;ABCD&quot;.

A given &quot;T&quot; may either be &quot;direct&quot; (respect orientation), or &quot;indirect&quot; (reverse orientation), and this may be determined by its effect on &quot;signed&quot; areas (as defined, for example, by the cross product of vectors).

==Examples==
===Over the real numbers===
The functions formula_67 with formula_68 and formula_69 in formula_70 and formula_71, are precisely the affine transformations of the real line.

===In plane geometry===
In formula_72, the transformation shown at left is accomplished using the map given by:

:formula_73

Transforming the three corner points of the original triangle (in red) gives three new points which form the new triangle (in blue). This transformation skews and translates the original triangle.

In fact, all triangles are related to one another by affine transformations. This is also true for all parallelograms, but not for all quadrilaterals.

<text>In chemistry, the oxidation state, or oxidation number, is the hypothetical charge of an atom if all of its bonds to other atoms are fully ionic. It describes the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state may be positive, negative or zero. Beside nearly-pure ionic bonding, many covalent bonds exhibit a strong ionicity, making oxidation state a useful predictor of charge.

The oxidation state of an atom does not represent the &quot;real&quot; charge on that atom, or any other actual atomic property. This is particularly true of high oxidation states, where the ionization energy required to produce a multiply positive ion is far greater than the energies available in chemical reactions. Additionally, the oxidation states of atoms in a given compound may vary depending on the choice of electronegativity scale used in their calculation. Thus, the oxidation state of an atom in a compound is purely a formalism. It is nevertheless important in understanding the nomenclature conventions of inorganic compounds. Also, several observations regarding chemical reactions may be explained at a basic level in terms of oxidation states.

Oxidation states are typically represented by integers which may be positive, zero, or negative. In some cases, the average oxidation state of an element is a fraction, such as for iron in magnetite (see below). The highest known oxidation state is reported to be +9, displayed by iridium in the tetroxoiridium(IX) cation (). It is predicted that even a +10 oxidation state may be achieved by platinum in tetroxoplatinum(X), . The lowest oxidation state is −5, as for boron in and gallium in pentamagnesium digallide ().

In Stock nomenclature, which is commonly used for inorganic compounds, the oxidation state is represented by a Roman numeral placed after the element name inside parentheses or as a superscript after the element symbol, e.g. Iron(III) oxide.

The term &quot;oxidation&quot; was first used by Antoine Lavoisier to signify the reaction of a substance with oxygen. Much later, it was realized that the substance, upon being oxidized, loses electrons, and the meaning was extended to include other reactions in which electrons are lost, regardless of whether oxygen was involved.
The increase in the oxidation state of an atom, through a chemical reaction, is known as oxidation; a decrease in oxidation state is known as a reduction. Such reactions involve the formal transfer of electrons: a net gain in electrons being a reduction, and a net loss of electrons being oxidation. For pure elements, the oxidation state is zero.

== Overview ==
Oxidation numbers are assigned to elements in a molecule such that the overall sum is zero in a neutral molecule. The number indicates the degree of oxidation of each element caused by molecular bonding. In ionic compounds, the oxidation numbers are the same as the element&#x27;s ionic charge. Thus for KCl, potassium is assigned +1 and chlorine is assigned -1. The complete set of rules for assigning oxidation numbers are discussed in the following sections.

Oxidation numbers are fundamental to the chemical nomenclature of ionic compounds. For example, Cu compounds with Cu oxidation state +2 are called &quot;cupric&quot; and those with state +1 are &quot;cuprous&quot;. 
The oxidation numbers of elements allow predictions of chemical formula and reactions, especially oxidation-reduction reactions.
The oxidation numbers of the most stable chemical compounds follow trends in the periodic table.

== IUPAC definition ==

International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) has published a &quot;Comprehensive definition of oxidation state (IUPAC Recommendations 2016)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1515/pac-2015-1204&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is a distillation of an IUPAC technical report: &quot;Toward a comprehensive definition of oxidation state&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1515/pac-2013-0505&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the IUPAC &quot;Gold Book&quot;: &quot;The oxidation state of an atom is the charge of this atom after ionic approximation of its heteronuclear bonds.&quot; The term &quot;oxidation number&quot; is nearly synonymous.

The ionic approximation means extrapolating bonds to ionic. Several criteria&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1002/anie.201407561&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; were considered for the ionic approximation:

# Extrapolation of the bond&#x27;s polarity; 
# Assignment of electrons according to the atom&#x27;s contribution to the bonding Molecular orbital (MO) or the electron&#x27;s allegiance in a LCAO–MO model.

In a bond between two different elements, the bond&#x27;s electrons are assigned to its main atomic contributor typically of higher electronegativity; in a bond between two atoms of the same element, the electrons are divided equally. Most electronegativity scales depend on the atom&#x27;s bonding state, which makes the assignment of the oxidation state a somewhat circular argument. For example, some scales may turn out unusual oxidation states, such as −6 for platinum in , for Pauling and Mulliken scales. The dipole moments would, sometimes, also turn out abnormal oxidation numbers, such as in CO and NO, which
are oriented with their positive end towards oxygen. Therefore, this leaves the atom&#x27;s contribution to the
bonding MO, the atomic-orbital energy, and from quantum-chemical calculations of charges, as the only viable criteria with cogent values for ionic approximation. However, for a simple estimate for the ionic approximation, we can use Allen electronegativities, as only that electronegativity scale is truly independent of the oxidation state, as it relates to the average valence‐electron energy of the free atom:

== Determination ==
While introductory levels of chemistry teaching use postulated oxidation states, the IUPAC recommendation and the &quot;Gold Book&quot; entry list two entirely general algorithms for the calculation of the oxidation states of elements in chemical compounds.

=== Simple approach without bonding considerations ===
Introductory chemistry uses postulates: the oxidation state for an element in a chemical formula is calculated from the overall charge and postulated oxidation states for all the other atoms.

A simple example is based on two postulates,

# OS = +1 for hydrogen
# OS = −2 for oxygen

where OS stands for oxidation state. This approach yields correct oxidation states in oxides and hydroxides of any single element, and in acids such as sulfuric acid () or dichromic acid (). Its coverage can be extended either by a list of exceptions or by assigning priority to the postulates. The latter works for hydrogen peroxide () where the priority of rule 1 leaves both oxygens with oxidation state −1.

Additional postulates and their ranking may expand the range of compounds to fit a textbook&#x27;s scope. As an example, one postulatory algorithm from many possible; in a sequence of decreasing priority:

# An element in a free form has OS = 0.
# In a compound or ion, the sum of the oxidation states equals the total charge of the compound or ion.
# Fluorine in compounds has OS = −1; this extends to chlorine and bromine only when not bonded to a lighter halogen, oxygen or nitrogen.
# Group 1 and group 2 metals in compounds have OS = +1 and +2, respectively.
# Hydrogen has OS = +1 but adopts −1 when bonded as a hydride to metals or metalloids.
# Oxygen in compounds has OS = −2 but only when not bonded to oxygen (e.g. in peroxides) or fluorine.

This set of postulates covers oxidation states of fluorides, chlorides, bromides, oxides, hydroxides, and hydrides of any single element. It covers all oxoacids of any central atom (and all their fluoro-, chloro-, and bromo-relatives), as well as salts of such acids with group 1 and 2 metals. It also covers iodides, sulfides, and similar simple salts of these metals.

=== Algorithm of assigning bonds ===
This algorithm is performed on a Lewis structure (a diagram that shows all valence electrons). Oxidation state equals the charge of an atom after each of its heteronuclear bonds has been assigned to the more electronegative partner of the bond (except when that partner is a reversibly bonded Lewis-acid ligand) and homonuclear bonds have been divided equally:

where each &quot;—&quot; represents an electron pair (either shared between two atoms or solely on one atom), and &quot;OS&quot; is the oxidation state as a numerical variable.

After the electrons have been assigned according to the vertical red lines on the formula, the total number of valence electrons that now &quot;belong&quot; to each atom is subtracted from the number of valence electrons of the neutral atom (such as 5 for nitrogen in group 15) to yield that atom&#x27;s oxidation state.

This example shows the importance of describing the bonding. Its summary formula, , corresponds to two structural isomers; the peroxynitrous acid in the above figure and the more stable nitric acid. With the formula , the simple approach without bonding considerations yields −2 for all three oxygens and +5 for nitrogen, which is correct for nitric acid. For the peroxynitrous acid, however, both oxygens in the O–O bond have OS = −1, and the nitrogen has OS = +3, which requires a structure to understand.

Organic compounds are treated in a similar manner; exemplified here on functional groups occurring in between methane () and carbon dioxide ():

Analogously for transition-metal compounds; on the left has a total of 36 valence electrons (18 pairs to be distributed), and hexacarbonylchromium () on the right has 66 valence electrons (33 pairs):

A key step is drawing the Lewis structure of the molecule (neutral, cationic, anionic): Atom symbols are arranged so that pairs of atoms can be joined by single two-electron bonds as in the molecule (a sort of &quot;skeletal&quot; structure), and the remaining valence electrons are distributed such that sp atoms obtain an octet (duet for hydrogen) with a priority that increases in proportion with electronegativity. In some cases, this leads to alternative formulae that differ in bond orders (the full set of which is called the resonance formulas). Consider the sulfate anion () with 32 valence electrons; 24 from oxygens, 6 from sulfur, 2 of the anion charge obtained from the implied cation. The bond orders to the terminal oxygens do not affect the oxidation state so long as the oxygens have octets. Already the skeletal structure, top left, yields the correct oxidation states, as does the Lewis structure, top right (one of the resonance formulas):

The bond-order formula at the bottom is closest to the reality of four equivalent oxygens each having a total bond order of 2. That total includes the bond of order to the implied cation and follows the 8 − &quot;N&quot; rule requiring that the main-group atom&#x27;s bond-order total equals 8 − &quot;N&quot; valence electrons of the neutral atom, enforced with a priority that proportionately increases with electronegativity.

This algorithm works equally for molecular cations composed of several atoms. An example is the ammonium cation of 8 valence electrons (5 from nitrogen, 4 from hydrogens, minus 1 electron for the cation&#x27;s positive charge):

Drawing Lewis structures with electron pairs as dashes emphasizes the essential equivalence of bond pairs and lone pairs when counting electrons and moving bonds onto atoms. Structures drawn with electron dot pairs are of course identical in every way:

==== The algorithm&#x27;s caveat ====
The algorithm contains a caveat, which concerns rare cases of transition-metal complexes with a type of ligand that is reversibly bonded as a Lewis acid (as an acceptor of the electron pair from the transition metal); termed a &quot;Z-type&quot; ligand in Green&#x27;s covalent bond classification method. The caveat originates from the simplifying use of electronegativity instead of the MO-based electron allegiance to decide the ionic sign. One early example is the complex with sulfur dioxide () as the reversibly-bonded acceptor ligand (released upon heating). The Rh−S bond is therefore extrapolated ionic against Allen electronegativities of rhodium and sulfur, yielding oxidation state +1 for rhodium:

=== Algorithm of summing bond orders ===
This algorithm works on Lewis structures and bond graphs of extended (non-molecular) solids:
==== Applied to a Lewis structure ====
An example of a Lewis structure with no formal charge,
illustrates that, in this algorithm, homonuclear bonds are simply ignored (the bond orders are in blue).

Carbon monoxide exemplifies a Lewis structure with formal charges:

To obtain the oxidation states, the formal charges are summed with the bond-order value taken positively at the carbon and negatively at the oxygen.

Applied to molecular ions, this algorithm considers the actual location of the formal (ionic) charge, as drawn in the Lewis structure. As an example, summing bond orders in the ammonium cation yields −4 at the nitrogen of formal charge +1, with the two numbers adding to the oxidation state of −3:

The sum of oxidation states in the ion equals its charge (as it equals zero for a neutral molecule).

Also in anions, the formal (ionic) charges have to be considered when nonzero. For sulfate this is exemplified with the skeletal or Lewis structures (top), compared with the bond-order formula of all oxygens equivalent and fulfilling the octet and 8 − &quot;N&quot; rules (bottom):

==== Applied to bond graph ====
A bond graph in solid-state chemistry is a chemical formula of an extended structure, in which direct bonding connectivities are shown. An example is the perovskite, the unit cell of which is drawn on the left and the bond graph (with added numerical values) on the right:

We see that the oxygen atom bonds to the six nearest rubidium cations, each of which has 4 bonds to the auride anion. The bond graph summarizes these connectivities. The bond orders (also called bond valences) sum up to oxidation states according to the attached sign of the bond&#x27;s ionic approximation (there are no formal charges in bond graphs).

Determination of oxidation states from a bond graph can be illustrated on ilmenite, . We may ask whether the mineral contains and , or and . Its crystal structure has each metal atom bonded to six oxygens and each of the equivalent oxygens to two irons and two titaniums, as in the bond graph below. Experimental data show that three metal-oxygen bonds in the octahedron are short and three are long (the metals are off-center). The bond orders (valences), obtained from the bond lengths by the bond valence method, sum up to 2.01 at Fe and 3.99 at Ti; which can be rounded off to oxidation states +2 and +4, respectively:

=== Balancing redox ===
Oxidation states can be useful for balancing chemical equations for oxidation-reduction (or redox) reactions, because the changes in the oxidized atoms have to be balanced by the changes in the reduced atoms. For example, in the reaction of acetaldehyde with Tollens&#x27; reagent to form acetic acid (shown below), the carbonyl carbon atom changes its oxidation state from +1 to +3 (loses two electrons). This oxidation is balanced by reducing two cations to (gaining two electrons in total).

An inorganic example is the Bettendorf reaction using tin dichloride () to prove the presence of arsenite ions in a concentrated HCl extract. When arsenic(III) is present, a brown coloration appears forming a dark precipitate of arsenic, according to the following simplified reaction:
Here three tin atoms are oxidized from oxidation state +2 to +4, yielding six electrons that reduce two arsenic atoms from oxidation state +3 to 0. The simple one-line balancing goes as follows: the two redox couples are written down as they react;
One tin is oxidized from oxidation state +2 to +4, a two-electron step, hence 2 is written in front of the two arsenic partners. One arsenic is reduced from +3 to 0, a three-electron step, hence 3 goes in front of the two tin partners. An alternative three-line procedure is to write separately the half-reactions for oxidation and reduction, each balanced with electrons, and then to sum them up such that the electrons cross out. In general, these redox balances (the one-line balance or each half-reaction) need to be checked for the ionic and electron charge sums on both sides of the equation being indeed equal. If they are not equal, suitable ions are added to balance the charges and the non-redox elemental balance.

== Appearances ==
=== Nominal oxidation states ===
A nominal oxidation state is a general term with two different definitions:
* Electrochemical oxidation state represents a molecule or ion in the Latimer diagram or Frost diagram for its redox-active element. An example is the Latimer diagram for sulfur at pH 0 where the electrochemical oxidation state +2 for sulfur puts  between S and H2SO3:
* Systematic oxidation state is chosen from close alternatives as a pedagogical description. An example is the oxidation state of phosphorus in H3PO3 (structurally diprotic HPO(OH)2) taken nominally as +3, while Allen electronegativities of phosphorus and hydrogen suggest +5 by a narrow margin that makes the two alternatives almost equivalent:
:Both alternative oxidation numbers for phosphorus make chemical sense, depending on which chemical property or reaction is emphasized. By contrast, a calculated alternative, such as the average (+4) does not.

=== Ambiguous oxidation states ===
Lewis formulae are rule-based approximations of chemical reality, as are Allen electronegativities. Still, oxidation states may seem ambiguous when their determination is not straightforward. If only an experiment can determine the oxidation state, the rule-based determination is ambiguous (insufficient). There are also truly dichotomous values that are decided arbitrarily.

==== Oxidation-state determination from resonance formulas ====
Seemingly ambiguous oxidation states are derived from a set of resonance formulas of equal weights for a molecule having heteronuclear bonds where the atom connectivity does not correspond to the number of two-electron bonds dictated by the 8 − &quot;N&quot; rule. An example is S2N2 where four resonance formulas featuring one S=N double bond have oxidation states +2 and +4 for the two sulfur atoms, which average to +3 because the two sulfur atoms are equivalent in this square-shaped molecule.

==== A physical measurement is needed to determine oxidation state ====
* when a non-innocent ligand is present, of hidden or unexpected redox properties that could otherwise be assigned to the central atom. An example is the nickel dithiolate complex, .
* when the redox ambiguity of a central atom and ligand yields dichotomous oxidation states of close stability, thermally induced tautomerism may result, as exemplified by manganese catecholate, . Assignment of such oxidation states requires spectroscopic, magnetic or structural data.
* when the bond order has to be ascertained along with an isolated tandem of a heteronuclear and a homonuclear bond. An example is thiosulfate having two possible oxidation states (bond orders are in blue and formal charges in green):

:The S–S distance measurement in thiosulfate is needed to reveal that this bond order is very close to 1, as in the formula on the left.

==== Ambiguous/arbitrary oxidation states ====
* when the electronegativity difference between two bonded atoms is very small (as in H3PO3). Two almost equivalent pairs of oxidation states, arbitrarily chosen, are obtained for these atoms.
* when an electronegative p-block atom forms solely homonuclear bonds, the number of which differs from the number of two-electron bonds suggested by rules. Examples are homonuclear finite chains like  (the central nitrogen connects two atoms with four two-electron bonds while only three two-electron bonds are required by the 8 − &quot;N&quot; rule) or  (the central iodine connects two atoms with two two-electron bonds while only one two-electron bond fulfills the 8 − &quot;N&quot; rule). A sensible approach is to distribute the ionic charge over the two outer atoms. Such a placement of charges in a polysulfide (where all inner sulfurs form two bonds, fulfilling the 8 − &quot;N&quot; rule) follows already from its Lewis structure.
* when the isolated tandem of a heteronuclear and a homonuclear bond leads to a bonding compromise in between two Lewis structures of limiting bond orders. An example is N2O:

:The typical oxidation state of nitrogen in N2O is +1, which also obtains for both nitrogens by a molecular orbital approach. The formal charges on the right comply with electronegativities, which implies an added ionic bonding contribution. Indeed, the estimated N−N and N−O bond orders are 2.76 and 1.9, respectively, approaching the formula of integer bond orders that would include the ionic contribution explicitly as a bond (in green):

:Conversely, formal charges against electronegativities in a Lewis structure decrease the bond order of the corresponding bond. An example is carbon monoxide with a bond-order estimate of 2.6.

=== Fractional oxidation states ===
Fractional oxidation states are often used to represent the average oxidation state of several atoms of the same element in a structure. For example, the formula of magnetite is , implying an average oxidation state for iron of +. However, this average value may not be representative if the atoms are not equivalent. In a crystal below , two-thirds of the cations are and one-third are , and the formula may be more clearly represented as FeO·.

Likewise, propane, , has been described as having a carbon oxidation state of −. Again, this is an average value since the structure of the molecule is , with the first and third carbon atoms each having an oxidation state of −3 and the central one −2.

An example with true fractional oxidation states for equivalent atoms is potassium superoxide, . The diatomic superoxide ion has an overall charge of −1, so each of its two equivalent oxygen atoms is assigned an oxidation state of −. This ion can be described as a resonance hybrid of two Lewis structures, where each oxygen has an oxidation state of 0 in one structure and −1 in the other.

For the cyclopentadienyl anion , the oxidation state of C is −1 + − = −. The −1 occurs because each carbon is bonded to one hydrogen atom (a less electronegative element), and the − because the total ionic charge of −1 is divided among five equivalent carbons. Again this can be described as a resonance hybrid of five equivalent structures, each having four carbons with oxidation state −1 and one with −2.

Finally, fractional oxidation numbers are not used in the chemical nomenclature. For example the red lead  is represented as lead(II,IV) oxide, showing the oxidation states of the two nonequivalent lead atoms.

=== Elements with multiple oxidation states ===

Most elements have more than one possible oxidation state. For example, carbon has nine possible integer oxidation states from −4 to +4:

=== Oxidation state in metals ===
Many compounds with luster and electrical conductivity maintain a simple stoichiometric formula, such as the golden TiO, blue-black RuO2 or coppery ReO3, all of obvious oxidation state. Ultimately, assigning the free metallic electrons to one of the bonded atoms is not comprehensive and can yield unusual oxidation states. Examples are the LiPb and ordered alloys, the composition and structure of which are largely determined by atomic size and packing factors. Should oxidation state be needed for redox balancing, it is best set to 0 for all atoms of such an alloy.

== List of oxidation states of the elements ==
This is a list of known oxidation states of the chemical elements, excluding nonintegral values. The most common states appear in bold. The table is based on that of Greenwood and Earnshaw, with additions noted. Every element exists in oxidation state 0 when it is the pure non-ionized element in any phase, whether monatomic or polyatomic allotrope. The column for oxidation state 0 only shows elements known to exist in oxidation state 0 in compounds.
=== Early forms (octet rule) ===
A figure with a similar format was used by Irving Langmuir in 1919 in one of the early papers about the octet rule. The periodicity of the oxidation states was one of the pieces of evidence that led Langmuir to adopt the rule.

== Use in nomenclature ==
The oxidation state in compound naming for transition metals and lanthanides and actinides is placed either as a right superscript to the element symbol in a chemical formula, such as FeIII or in parentheses after the name of the element in chemical names, such as iron(III). For example, is named iron(III) sulfate and its formula can be shown as Fe. This is because a sulfate ion has a charge of −2, so each iron atom takes a charge of +3.

== History of the oxidation state concept ==
=== Early days ===
Oxidation itself was first studied by Antoine Lavoisier, who defined it as the result of reactions with oxygen (hence the name). The term has since been generalized to imply a &quot;formal&quot; loss of electrons. Oxidation states, called &quot;oxidation grades&quot; by Friedrich Wöhler in 1835, were one of the intellectual stepping stones that Dmitri Mendeleev used to derive the periodic table. William B. Jensen gives an overview of the history up to 1938.

=== Use in nomenclature ===
When it was realized that some metals form two different binary compounds with the same nonmetal, the two compounds were often distinguished by using the ending &quot;-ic&quot; for the higher metal oxidation state and the ending &quot;-ous&quot; for the lower. For example, FeCl3 is ferric chloride and FeCl2 is ferrous chloride. This system is not very satisfactory (although sometimes still used) because different metals have different oxidation states which have to be learned: ferric and ferrous are +3 and +2 respectively, but cupric and cuprous are +2 and +1, and stannic and stannous are +4 and +2. Also, there was no allowance for metals with more than two oxidation states, such as vanadium with oxidation states +2, +3, +4, and +5.

This system has been largely replaced by one suggested by Alfred Stock in 1919 and adopted by IUPAC in 1940. Thus, FeCl2 was written as iron(II) chloride rather than ferrous chloride. The Roman numeral II at the central atom came to be called the &quot;Stock number&quot; (now an obsolete term), and its value was obtained as a charge at the central atom after removing its ligands along with the electron pairs they shared with it.

=== Development towards the current concept ===
The term &quot;oxidation state&quot; in English chemical literature was popularized by Wendell Mitchell Latimer in his 1938 book about electrochemical potentials. He used it for the value (synonymous with the German term &quot;Wertigkeit&quot;) previously termed &quot;valence&quot;, &quot;polar valence&quot; or &quot;polar number&quot; in English, or &quot;oxidation stage&quot; or indeed the &quot;state of oxidation&quot;. Since 1938, the term &quot;oxidation state&quot; has been connected with electrochemical potentials and electrons exchanged in redox couples participating in redox reactions. By 1948, IUPAC used the 1940 nomenclature rules with the term &quot;oxidation state&quot;, instead of the original &quot;valency&quot;. In 1948 Linus Pauling proposed that oxidation number could be determined by extrapolating bonds to being completely ionic in the direction of electronegativity. A full acceptance of this suggestion was complicated by the fact that the Pauling electronegativities as such depend on the oxidation state and that they may lead to unusual values of oxidation states for some transition metals. In 1990 IUPAC resorted to a postulatory (rule-based) method to determine the oxidation state. This was complemented by the synonymous term oxidation number as a descendant of the Stock number introduced in 1940 into the nomenclature. However, the terminology using &quot;ligands&quot; gave the impression that oxidation number might be something specific to coordination complexes. This situation and the lack of a real single definition generated numerous debates about the meaning of oxidation state, suggestions about methods to obtain it and definitions of it. To resolve the issue, an IUPAC project (2008-040-1-200) was started in 2008 on the &quot;Comprehensive Definition of Oxidation State&quot;, and was concluded by two reports and by the revised entries &quot;Oxidation State&quot; and &quot;Oxidation Number&quot; in the IUPAC Gold Book. The outcomes were a single definition of oxidation state and two algorithms to calculate it in molecular and extended-solid compounds, guided by Allen electronegativities that are independent of oxidation state.

<text>The gravitational constant is an empirical physical constant involved in the calculation of gravitational effects in Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation and in Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity. It is also known as the universal gravitational constant, the Newtonian constant of gravitation, or the Cavendish gravitational constant, denoted by the capital letter .

In Newton&#x27;s law, it is the proportionality constant connecting the gravitational force between two bodies with the product of their masses and the inverse square of their distance. In the Einstein field equations, it quantifies the relation between the geometry of spacetime and the energy–momentum tensor (also referred to as the stress–energy tensor).

The measured value of the constant is known with some certainty to four significant digits. In SI units, its value is approximately 

The modern notation of Newton&#x27;s law involving was introduced in the 1890s by C. V. Boys. The first implicit measurement with an accuracy within about 1% is attributed to Henry Cavendish in a 1798 experiment.

== Definition ==
According to Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, the magnitude of the attractive force () between two bodies each with a spherically symmetric density distribution is directly proportional to the product of their masses, and , and inversely proportional to the square of the distance, , directed along the line connecting their centres of mass:
formula_1
The constant of proportionality, , in this non-relativistic formulation is the gravitational constant. Colloquially, the gravitational constant is also called &quot;Big G&quot;, distinct from &quot;small g&quot; (), which is the local gravitational field of Earth (also referred to as free-fall acceleration). Where formula_2 is the mass of the Earth and formula_3 is the radius of the Earth, the two quantities are related by:
formula_4

The gravitational constant appears in the Einstein field equations of general relativity,
formula_5
where is the Einstein tensor (not the gravitational constant despite the use of ), is the cosmological constant, is the metric tensor, is the stress–energy tensor, and is the Einstein gravitational constant, a constant originally introduced by Einstein that is directly related to the Newtonian constant of gravitation:
formula_6

== Value and uncertainty ==
The gravitational constant is a physical constant that is difficult to measure with high accuracy. This is because the gravitational force is an extremely weak force as compared to other fundamental forces at the laboratory scale.

In SI units, the CODATA-recommended value of the gravitational constant is:
: formula_7 = 

The relative standard uncertainty is .

=== Natural units ===
Due to its use as a defining constant in some systems of natural units, particularly geometrized unit systems such as Planck units and Stoney units, the value of the gravitational constant will generally have a numeric value of 1 or a value close to it when expressed in terms of those units. Due to the significant uncertainty in the measured value of &quot;G&quot; in terms of other known fundamental constants, a similar level of uncertainty will show up in the value of many quantities when expressed in such a unit system.

=== Orbital mechanics ===

In astrophysics, it is convenient to measure distances in parsecs (pc), velocities in kilometres per second (km/s) and masses in solar units . In these units, the gravitational constant is:
formula_8
For situations where tides are important, the relevant length scales are solar radii rather than parsecs. In these units, the gravitational constant is:
formula_9
In orbital mechanics, the period of an object in circular orbit around a spherical object obeys
formula_10
where is the volume inside the radius of the orbit, and is the total mass of the two objects. It follows that
: formula_11
This way of expressing shows the relationship between the average density of a planet and the period of a satellite orbiting just above its surface.

For elliptical orbits, applying Kepler&#x27;s 3rd law, expressed in units characteristic of Earth&#x27;s orbit:
: formula_12
where distance is measured in terms of the semi-major axis of Earth&#x27;s orbit (the astronomical unit, AU), time in years, and mass in the total mass of the orbiting system ().

The above equation is exact only within the approximation of the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun as a two-body problem in Newtonian mechanics, the measured quantities contain corrections from the perturbations from other bodies in the solar system and from general relativity.

From 1964 until 2012, however, it was used as the definition of the astronomical unit and thus held by definition:
formula_13 
Since 2012, the AU is defined as exactly, and the equation can no longer be taken as holding precisely.

The quantity —the product of the gravitational constant and the mass of a given astronomical body such as the Sun or Earth—is known as the standard gravitational parameter (also denoted ). The standard gravitational parameter appears as above in Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation, as well as in formulas for the deflection of light caused by gravitational lensing, in Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion, and in the formula for escape velocity.

This quantity gives a convenient simplification of various gravity-related formulas. The product is known much more accurately than either factor is.
Calculations in celestial mechanics can also be carried out using the units of solar masses, mean solar days and astronomical units rather than standard SI units. For this purpose, the Gaussian gravitational constant was historically in widespread use, , expressing the mean angular velocity of the Sun–Earth system. The use of this constant, and the implied definition of the astronomical unit discussed above, has been deprecated by the IAU since 2012.

== History of measurement ==
=== Early history ===

The existence of the constant is implied in Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation as published in the 1680s (although its notation as dates to the 1890s), but is not calculated in his &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; where it postulates the inverse-square law of gravitation. In the &quot;Principia&quot;, Newton considered the possibility of measuring gravity&#x27;s strength by measuring the deflection of a pendulum in the vicinity of a large hill, but thought that the effect would be too small to be measurable. Nevertheless, he had the opportunity to estimate the order of magnitude of the constant when he surmised that &quot;the mean density of the earth might be five or six times as great as the density of water&quot;, which is equivalent to a gravitational constant of the order:

A measurement was attempted in 1738 by Pierre Bouguer and Charles Marie de La Condamine in their &quot;Peruvian expedition&quot;. Bouguer downplayed the significance of their results in 1740, suggesting that the experiment had at least proved that the Earth could not be a hollow shell, as some thinkers of the day, including Edmond Halley, had suggested.

The Schiehallion experiment, proposed in 1772 and completed in 1776, was the first successful measurement of the mean density of the Earth, and thus indirectly of the gravitational constant. The result reported by Charles Hutton (1778) suggested a density of ( times the density of water), about 20% below the modern value. This immediately led to estimates on the densities and masses of the Sun, Moon and planets, sent by Hutton to Jérôme Lalande for inclusion in his planetary tables. As discussed above, establishing the average density of Earth is equivalent to measuring the gravitational constant, given Earth&#x27;s mean radius and the mean gravitational acceleration at Earth&#x27;s surface, by setting

formula_14
Based on this, Hutton&#x27;s 1778 result is equivalent to .
The first direct measurement of gravitational attraction between two bodies in the laboratory was performed in 1798, seventy-one years after Newton&#x27;s death, by Henry Cavendish. He determined a value for implicitly, using a torsion balance invented by the geologist Rev. John Michell (1753). He used a horizontal torsion beam with lead balls whose inertia (in relation to the torsion constant) he could tell by timing the beam&#x27;s oscillation. Their faint attraction to other balls placed alongside the beam was detectable by the deflection it caused. In spite of the experimental design being due to Michell, the experiment is now known as the Cavendish experiment for its first successful execution by Cavendish.

Cavendish&#x27;s stated aim was the &quot;weighing of Earth&quot;, that is, determining the average density of Earth and the Earth&#x27;s mass. His result, , corresponds to value of . It is surprisingly accurate, about 1% above the modern value (comparable to the claimed relative standard uncertainty of 0.6%).

=== 19th century ===
The accuracy of the measured value of has increased only modestly since the original Cavendish experiment. is quite difficult to measure because gravity is much weaker than other fundamental forces, and an experimental apparatus cannot be separated from the gravitational influence of other bodies.

Measurements with pendulums were made by Francesco Carlini (1821, ), Edward Sabine (1827, ), Carlo Ignazio Giulio (1841, ) and George Biddell Airy (1854, ).

Cavendish&#x27;s experiment was first repeated by Ferdinand Reich (1838, 1842, 1853), who found a value of , which is actually worse than Cavendish&#x27;s result, differing from the modern value by 1.5%. Cornu and Baille (1873), found .

Cavendish&#x27;s experiment proved to result in more reliable measurements than pendulum experiments of the &quot;Schiehallion&quot; (deflection) type or &quot;Peruvian&quot; (period as a function of altitude) type. Pendulum experiments still continued to be performed, by Robert von Sterneck (1883, results between 5.0 and ) and Thomas Corwin Mendenhall (1880, ).

Cavendish&#x27;s result was first improved upon by John Henry Poynting (1891), who published a value of , differing from the modern value by 0.2%, but compatible with the modern value within the cited relative standard uncertainty of 0.55%. In addition to Poynting, measurements were made by C. V. Boys (1895) and Carl Braun (1897), with compatible results suggesting = . The modern notation involving the constant was introduced by Boys in 1894 and becomes standard by the end of the 1890s, with values usually cited in the cgs system. Richarz and Krigar-Menzel (1898) attempted a repetition of the Cavendish experiment using 100,000 kg of lead for the attracting mass. The precision of their result of was, however, of the same order of magnitude as the other results at the time.

Arthur Stanley Mackenzie in &quot;The Laws of Gravitation&quot; (1899) reviews the work done in the 19th century. Poynting is the author of the article &quot;Gravitation&quot; in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition (1911). Here, he cites a value of = with a relative uncertainty of 0.2%.

=== Modern value ===
Paul R. Heyl (1930) published the value of (relative uncertainty 0.1%), improved to (relative uncertainty 0.045% = 450 ppm) in 1942.

However, Heyl used the statistical spread as his standard deviation, and he admitted himself that measurements using the same material yielded very similar results while measurements using different materials yielded vastly different results. He spent the next 12 years after his 1930 paper to do more precise measurements, hoping that the composition-dependent effect would go away, but it did not, as he noted in his final paper from the year 1942.

Published values of derived from high-precision measurements since the 1950s have remained compatible with Heyl (1930), but within the relative uncertainty of about 0.1% (or 1000 ppm) have varied rather broadly, and it is not entirely clear if the uncertainty has been reduced at all since the 1942 measurement. Some measurements published in the 1980s to 2000s were, in fact, mutually exclusive. Establishing a standard value for with a relative standard uncertainty better than 0.1% has therefore remained rather speculative.

By 1969, the value recommended by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was cited with a relative standard uncertainty of 0.046% (460 ppm), lowered to 0.012% (120 ppm) by 1986. But the continued publication of conflicting measurements led NIST to considerably increase the standard uncertainty in the 1998 recommended value, by a factor of 12, to a standard uncertainty of 0.15%, larger than the one given by Heyl (1930).

The uncertainty was again lowered in 2002 and 2006, but once again raised, by a more conservative 20%, in 2010, matching the relative standard uncertainty of 120 ppm published in 1986. For the 2014 update, CODATA reduced the uncertainty to 46 ppm, less than half the 2010 value, and one order of magnitude below the 1969 recommendation.

The following table shows the NIST recommended values published since 1969:
In the January 2007 issue of &quot;Science&quot;, Fixler et al. described a measurement of the gravitational constant by a new technique, atom interferometry, reporting a value of , 0.28% (2800 ppm) higher than the 2006 CODATA value. An improved cold atom measurement by Rosi et al. was published in 2014 of . Although much closer to the accepted value (suggesting that the Fixler &quot;et al.&quot; measurement was erroneous), this result was 325 ppm below the recommended 2014 CODATA value, with non-overlapping standard uncertainty intervals.
As of 2018, efforts to re-evaluate the conflicting results of measurements are underway, coordinated by NIST, notably a repetition of the experiments reported by Quinn et al. (2013).

In August 2018, a Chinese research group announced new measurements based on torsion balances, and based on two different methods. These are claimed as the most accurate measurements ever made, with standard uncertainties cited as low as 12 ppm. The difference of 2.7&quot;σ&quot; between the two results suggests there could be sources of error unaccounted for.

Analysis of observations of 580 type Ia supernovae shows that the gravitational constant has varied by less than one part in ten billion per year over the last nine billion years.

<text>Imre Lakatos (, ; ; 9 November 1922 – 2 February 1974) was a Hungarian philosopher of mathematics and science, known for his thesis of the fallibility of mathematics and its &quot;methodology of proofs and refutations&quot; in its pre-axiomatic stages of development, and also for introducing the concept of the &quot;research programme&quot; in his methodology of scientific research programmes.

==Life==
Lakatos was born Imre (Avrum) Lipsitz to a Jewish family in Debrecen, Hungary, in 1922. He received a degree in mathematics, physics, and philosophy from the University of Debrecen in 1944. In March 1944 the Germans invaded Hungary, and Lakatos along with Éva Révész, his then-girlfriend and subsequent wife, formed soon after that event a Marxist resistance group. In May of that year, the group was joined by Éva Izsák, a 19-year-old Jewish antifascist activist. Lakatos, considering that there was a risk that she would be captured and forced to betray them, decided that her duty to the group was to commit suicide. Subsequently, a member of the group took her to Debrecen and gave her cyanide.

During the occupation, Lakatos avoided Nazi persecution of Jews by changing his surname to Molnár. His mother and grandmother were murdered in Auschwitz. He changed his surname once again to &quot;Lakatos&quot; (Locksmith) in honor of Géza Lakatos.

After the war, from 1947, he worked as a senior official in the Hungarian ministry of education. He also continued his education with a PhD at Debrecen University awarded in 1948 and also attended György Lukács&#x27;s weekly Wednesday afternoon private seminars. He also studied at the Moscow State University under the supervision of Sofya Yanovskaya in 1949. When he returned, however, he found himself on the losing side of internal arguments within the Hungarian communist party and was imprisoned on charges of revisionism from 1950 to 1953. More of Lakatos&#x27;s activities in Hungary after World War II have recently become known. In fact, Lakatos was a hardline Stalinist and, despite his young age, had an important role between 1945 and 1950 (his own arrest and jailing) in building up the Communist rule, especially in cultural life and the academia, in Hungary.

After his release, Lakatos returned to academic life, doing mathematical research and translating George Pólya&#x27;s &quot;How to Solve It&quot; into Hungarian. Still nominally a communist, his political views had shifted markedly, and he was involved with at least one dissident student group in the lead-up to the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.

After the Soviet Union invaded Hungary in November 1956, Lakatos fled to Vienna and later reached England. He lived there for the rest of his life however he never achieved a British citizenship. He received a PhD in philosophy in 1961 from the University of Cambridge; his doctoral thesis was entitled &quot;Essays in the Logic of Mathematical Discovery&quot;, and his doctoral advisor was R. B. Braithwaite. The book &quot;Proofs and Refutations: The Logic of Mathematical Discovery&quot;, published after his death, is based on this work.

In 1960, he was appointed to a position in the London School of Economics (LSE), where he wrote on the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of science. The LSE philosophy of science department at that time included Karl Popper, Joseph Agassi and J. O. Wisdom. It was Agassi who first introduced Lakatos to Popper under the rubric of his applying a fallibilist methodology of conjectures and refutations to mathematics in his Cambridge PhD thesis.

With co-editor Alan Musgrave, he edited the often cited &quot;Criticism and the Growth of Knowledge&quot;, the &quot;Proceedings&quot; of the International Colloquium in the Philosophy of Science, London, 1965. Published in 1970, the 1965 Colloquium included well-known speakers delivering papers in response to Thomas Kuhn&#x27;s &quot;The Structure of Scientific Revolutions&quot;.

In January 1971, he became editor of the &quot;British Journal for the Philosophy of Science&quot;, which J. O. Wisdom had built up before departing in 1965, and he continued as editor until his death in 1974, after which it was then edited jointly for many years by his LSE colleagues John W. N. Watkins and John Worrall, Lakatos&#x27;s ex-research assistant. 

Lakatos and his colleague Spiro Latsis organized an international conference in Greece in 1975, and went ahead despite his death. It was devoted entirely to historical case studies in Lakatos&#x27;s methodology of research programmes in physical sciences and economics. These case studies in such as Einstein&#x27;s relativity programme, Fresnel&#x27;s wave theory of light and neoclassical economics, were published by Cambridge University Press in two separate volumes in 1976, one devoted to physical sciences and Lakatos&#x27;s general programme for rewriting the history of science, with a concluding critique by his great friend Paul Feyerabend, and the other devoted to economics.

He remained at LSE until his sudden death in 1974 of a heart attack at the age of 51. The Lakatos Award was set up by the school in his memory. His last lectures along with some correspondance were published in Against Method. His last lectures along with parts of his correspondence with Paul Feyerabend have been published in &quot;For and Against Method&quot;.

==Philosophical work==
=== Philosophy of mathematics ===
Lakatos&#x27;s philosophy of mathematics was inspired by both Hegel&#x27;s and Marx&#x27;s dialectic, by Karl Popper&#x27;s theory of knowledge, and by the work of mathematician George Pólya.

The 1976 book &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot; is based on the first three chapters of his 1961 four-chapter doctoral thesis &quot;Essays in the Logic of Mathematical Discovery&quot;. But its first chapter is Lakatos&#x27;s own revision of its chapter 1 that was first published as &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot; in four parts in 1963–64 in the &quot;British Journal for the Philosophy of Science&quot;. It is largely taken up by a fictional dialogue set in a mathematics class. The students are attempting to prove the formula for the Euler characteristic in algebraic topology, which is a theorem about the properties of polyhedra, namely that for all polyhedra the number of their vertices &quot;V&quot; minus the number of their edges &quot;E&quot; plus the number of their faces &quot;F&quot; is 2 (). The dialogue is meant to represent the actual series of attempted proofs that mathematicians historically offered for the conjecture, only to be repeatedly refuted by counterexamples. Often the students paraphrase famous mathematicians such as Cauchy, as noted in Lakatos&#x27;s extensive footnotes.

Lakatos termed the polyhedral counterexamples to Euler&#x27;s formula &quot;monsters&quot; and distinguished three ways of handling these objects: Firstly, &quot;monster-barring&quot;, by which means the theorem in question could not be applied to such objects. Secondly, &quot;monster-adjustment&quot;, whereby by making a re-appraisal of the &quot;monster&quot; it could be &quot;made&quot; to obey the proposed theorem. Thirdly, &quot;exception handling&quot;, a further distinct process. These distinct strategies have been taken up in qualitative physics, where the terminology of &quot;monsters&quot; has been applied to apparent counterexamples, and the techniques of &quot;monster-barring&quot; and &quot;monster-adjustment&quot; recognized as approaches to the refinement of the analysis of a physical issue.

What Lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of informal mathematics is final or perfect. This means that we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true, only that no counterexample has yet been found. Once a counterexample is found, we adjust the theorem, possibly extending the domain of its validity. This is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates, through the logic and process of proofs and refutations. (If axioms are given for a branch of mathematics, however, Lakatos claimed that proofs from those axioms were tautological, i.e. logically true.)

Lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on the idea of heuristics. In &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot; the concept of &quot;heuristic&quot; was not well developed, although Lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures. He thought that mathematical &quot;thought experiments&quot; are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs, and sometimes called his philosophy &quot;quasi-empiricism&quot;.

However, he also conceived of the mathematical community as carrying on a kind of dialectic to decide which mathematical proofs are valid and which are not. Therefore, he fundamentally disagreed with the &quot;formalist&quot; conception of proof that prevailed in Frege&#x27;s and Russell&#x27;s logicism, which defines proof simply in terms of &quot;formal&quot; validity.

On its first publication as an article in the &quot;British Journal for the Philosophy of Science&quot; in 1963–64, &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot; became highly influential on new work in the philosophy of mathematics, although few agreed with Lakatos&#x27;s strong disapproval of formal proof. Before his death he had been planning to return to the philosophy of mathematics and apply his theory of research programmes to it. Lakatos, Worrall and Zahar use Poincaré (1893) to answer one of the major problems perceived by critics, namely that the pattern of mathematical research depicted in &quot;Proofs and Refutations&quot; does not faithfully represent most of the actual activity of contemporary mathematicians.

==== Cauchy and uniform convergence ====
In a 1966 text &quot;Cauchy and the continuum&quot;, Lakatos re-examines the history of the calculus, with special regard to Augustin-Louis Cauchy and the concept of uniform convergence, in the light of non-standard analysis. Lakatos is concerned that historians of mathematics should not judge the evolution of mathematics in terms of currently fashionable theories. As an illustration, he examines Cauchy&#x27;s proof that the sum of a series of continuous functions is itself continuous. Lakatos is critical of those who would see Cauchy&#x27;s proof, with its failure to make explicit a suitable convergence hypothesis, merely as an inadequate approach to Weierstrassian analysis. Lakatos sees in such an approach a failure to realize that Cauchy&#x27;s concept of the continuum differed from currently dominant views.

===Research programmes===
Lakatos&#x27;s second major contribution to the philosophy of science was his model of the &quot;research programme&quot;, which he formulated in an attempt to resolve the perceived conflict between Popper&#x27;s falsificationism and the revolutionary structure of science described by Kuhn. Popper&#x27;s standard of falsificationism was widely taken to imply that a theory should be abandoned as soon as any evidence appears to challenge it, while Kuhn&#x27;s descriptions of scientific activity were taken to imply that science is most fruitful during periods in which popular, or &quot;normal&quot;, theories are supported despite known anomalies. Lakatos&#x27;s model of the research programme aims to combine Popper&#x27;s adherence to empirical validity with Kuhn&#x27;s appreciation for conventional consistency.

A Lakatosian research programme is based on a &quot;hard core&quot; of theoretical assumptions that cannot be abandoned or altered without abandoning the programme altogether. More modest and specific theories that are formulated in order to explain evidence that threatens the &quot;hard core&quot; are termed &quot;auxiliary hypotheses&quot;. Auxiliary hypotheses are considered expendable by the adherents of the research programme—they may be altered or abandoned as empirical discoveries require in order to &quot;protect&quot; the &quot;hard core&quot;. Whereas Popper was generally read as hostile toward such theoretical amendments, Lakatos argued that they can be &quot;progressive&quot;, i.e. productive, when they enhance the programme&#x27;s explanatory and/or predictive power, and that they are at least permissible until some better system of theories is devised and the research programme is replaced entirely. The difference between a &quot;progressive&quot; and a &quot;degenerative&quot; research programme lies, for Lakatos, in whether the recent changes to its auxiliary hypotheses have achieved this greater explanatory/predictive power or whether they have been made simply out of the necessity of offering some response in the face of new and troublesome evidence. A degenerative research programme indicates that a new and more progressive system of theories should be sought to replace the currently prevailing one, but until such a system of theories can be conceived of and agreed upon, abandonment of the current one would only further weaken our explanatory power and was therefore unacceptable for Lakatos. Lakatos&#x27;s primary example of a research programme that had been successful in its time and then progressively replaced is that founded by Isaac Newton, with his three laws of motion forming the &quot;hard core&quot;.

The Lakatosian research programme deliberately provides a framework within which research can be conducted on the basis of &quot;first principles&quot; (the &quot;hard core&quot;), which are shared by those involved in the research programme and accepted for the purpose of that research without further proof or debate. In this regard, it is similar to Kuhn&#x27;s notion of a paradigm. Lakatos sought to replace Kuhn&#x27;s paradigm, guided by an irrational &quot;psychology of discovery&quot;, with a research programme no less coherent or consistent, yet guided by Popper&#x27;s objectively valid logic of discovery.

Lakatos was following Pierre Duhem&#x27;s idea that one can always protect a cherished theory (or part of one) from hostile evidence by redirecting the criticism toward other theories or parts thereof. (See &quot;Confirmation holism&quot; and Duhem–Quine thesis). This aspect of falsification had been acknowledged by Popper.

Popper&#x27;s theory, falsificationism, proposed that scientists put forward theories and that nature &quot;shouts NO&quot; in the form of an inconsistent observation. According to Popper, it is irrational for scientists to maintain their theories in the face of nature&#x27;s rejection, as Kuhn had described them doing. For Lakatos, however, &quot;It is not that we propose a theory and Nature may shout NO; rather, we propose a maze of theories, and nature may shout INCONSISTENT&quot;. The continued adherence to a programme&#x27;s &quot;hard core&quot;, augmented with adaptable auxiliary hypotheses, reflects Lakatos&#x27;s less strict standard of falsificationism.

Lakatos saw himself as merely extending Popper&#x27;s ideas, which changed over time and were interpreted by many in conflicting ways. In his 1968 article &quot;Criticism and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes&quot;, Lakatos contrasted &quot;Popper0&quot;, the &quot;naive falsificationist&quot; who demanded unconditional rejection of any theory in the face of any anomaly (an interpretation Lakatos saw as erroneous but that he nevertheless referred to often); &quot;Popper1&quot;, the more nuanced and conservatively interpreted philosopher; and &quot;Popper2&quot;, the &quot;sophisticated methodological falsificationist&quot; that Lakatos claims is the logical extension of the correctly interpreted ideas of &quot;Popper1&quot; (and who is therefore essentially Lakatos himself). It is, therefore, very difficult to determine which ideas and arguments concerning the research programme should be credited to whom.

While Lakatos dubbed his theory &quot;sophisticated methodological falsificationism&quot;, it is not &quot;methodological&quot; in the strict sense of asserting universal methodological rules by which all scientific research must abide. Rather, it is methodological only in that theories are only abandoned according to a methodical progression from worse theories to better theories—a stipulation overlooked by what Lakatos terms &quot;dogmatic falsificationism&quot;. Methodological assertions in the strict sense, pertaining to which methods are valid and which are invalid, are, themselves, contained within the research programmes that choose to adhere to them, and should be judged according to whether the research programmes that adhere to them prove progressive or degenerative. Lakatos divided these &quot;methodological rules&quot; within a research programme into its &quot;negative heuristics&quot;, i.e., what research methods and approaches to avoid, and its &quot;positive heuristics&quot;, i.e., what research methods and approaches to prefer. While the &quot;negative heuristic&quot; protects the hard core, the &quot;positive heuristic&quot; directs the modification of the hard core and auxiliary hypotheses in a general direction.

Lakatos claimed that not all changes of the auxiliary hypotheses of a research programme (which he calls &quot;problem shifts&quot;) are equally productive or acceptable. He took the view that these &quot;problem shifts&quot; should be evaluated not just by their ability to defend the &quot;hard core&quot; by explaining apparent anomalies, but also by their ability to produce new facts, in the form of predictions or additional explanations. Adjustments that accomplish nothing more than the maintenance of the &quot;hard core&quot; mark the research programme as degenerative.

Lakatos&#x27;s model provides for the possibility of a research programme that is not only continued in the presence of troublesome anomalies but that remains progressive despite them. For Lakatos, it is essentially necessary to continue on with a theory that we basically know cannot be completely true, and it is even possible to make scientific progress in doing so, as long as we remain receptive to a better research programme that may eventually be conceived of. In this sense, it is, for Lakatos, an acknowledged misnomer to refer to &quot;falsification&quot; or &quot;refutation&quot;, when it is not the truth or falsity of a theory that is solely determining whether we consider it &quot;falsified&quot;, but also the availability of a &quot;less false&quot; theory. A theory cannot be rightfully &quot;falsified&quot;, according to Lakatos, until it is superseded by a better (i.e. more progressive) research programme. This is what he says is happening in the historical periods Kuhn describes as revolutions and what makes them rational as opposed to mere leaps of faith or periods of deranged social psychology, as Kuhn argued.

===Pseudoscience===
According to the demarcation criterion of pseudoscience proposed by Lakatos, a theory is pseudoscientific if it fails to make any novel predictions of previously unknown phenomena or its predictions were mostly falsified, in contrast with scientific theories, which predict novel fact(s). Progressive scientific theories are those that have their novel facts confirmed, and degenerate scientific theories, which can degenerate so much that they become pseudo-science, are those whose predictions of novel facts are refuted. As he put it:
: &quot;A given fact is explained scientifically only if a new fact is predicted with it ... The idea of growth and the concept of empirical character are soldered into one.&quot; See pages 34–35 of &quot;The Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes&quot;, 1978.

Lakatos&#x27;s own key examples of pseudoscience were Ptolemaic astronomy, Immanuel Velikovsky&#x27;s planetary cosmogony, Freudian psychoanalysis, 20th-century &quot;Soviet&quot; Marxism, Lysenko&#x27;s biology, Niels Bohr&#x27;s quantum mechanics post-1924, astrology, psychiatry, and neoclassical economics.

====Darwin&#x27;s theory====
In his 1973 Scientific Method Lecture 1 at the London School of Economics, he also claimed that &quot;nobody to date has yet found a demarcation criterion according to which Darwin can be described as scientific&quot;.

Almost 20 years after Lakatos&#x27;s 1973 challenge to the scientificity of Darwin, in her 1991 &quot;The Ant and the Peacock&quot;, LSE lecturer and ex-colleague of Lakatos, Helena Cronin, attempted to establish that Darwinian theory was empirically scientific in respect of at least being supported by evidence of likeness in the diversity of life forms in the world, explained by descent with modification. She wrote that

our usual idea of corroboration as requiring the successful prediction of novel facts ... Darwinian theory was not strong on temporally novel predictions. ... however familiar the evidence and whatever role it played in the construction of the theory, it still confirms the theory.
===Rational reconstructions of the history of science===
In his 1970 article &quot;History of Science and Its Rational Reconstructions&quot; Lakatos proposed a dialectical historiographical meta-method for evaluating different theories of scientific method, namely by means of their comparative success in explaining the actual history of science and scientific revolutions on the one hand, whilst on the other providing a historiographical framework for rationally reconstructing the history of science as anything more than merely inconsequential rambling. The article started with his now renowned dictum &quot;Philosophy of science without history of science is empty; history of science without philosophy of science is blind&quot;.

However, neither Lakatos himself nor his collaborators ever completed the first part of this dictum by showing that in any scientific revolution the great majority of the relevant scientific community converted just when Lakatos&#x27;s criterion – one programme successfully predicting some novel facts whilst its competitor degenerated – was satisfied. Indeed, for the historical case studies in his 1968 article &quot;Criticism and the Methodology of Scientific Research Programmes&quot; he had openly admitted as much, commenting: &quot;In this paper it is not my purpose to go on seriously to the second stage of comparing rational reconstructions with actual history for any lack of historicity.&quot;

==Criticism==

===Feyerabend===
Paul Feyerabend argued that Lakatos&#x27;s methodology was not a methodology at all, but merely &quot;words that &quot;sound&quot; like the elements of a methodology&quot;. He argued that Lakatos&#x27;s methodology was no different in practice from epistemological anarchism, Feyerabend&#x27;s own position. He wrote in &quot;Science in a Free Society&quot; (after Lakatos&#x27;s death) that:

Lakatos realized and admitted that the existing standards of rationality, standards of logic included, were too restrictive and would have hindered science had they been applied with determination. He therefore permitted the scientist to violate them (he admits that science is not &quot;rational&quot; in the sense of &quot;these&quot; standards). However, he demanded that research programmes show certain features &quot;in the long run&quot; — they must be progressive... I have argued that this demand no longer restricts scientific practice. Any development agrees with it.

Lakatos and Feyerabend planned to produce a joint work in which Lakatos would develop a rationalist description of science, and Feyerabend would attack it. The correspondence between Lakatos and Feyerabend, where the two discussed the project, has since been reproduced, with commentary, by Matteo Motterlini.

<text>The Space Shuttle program was the fourth human spaceflight program carried out by the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), which accomplished routine transportation for Earth-to-orbit crew and cargo from 1981 to 2011. Its official program name was Space Transportation System (STS), taken from a 1969 plan for a system of reusable spacecraft where it was the only item funded for development, as a proposed nuclear shuttle in the plan was cancelled in 1972. It flew 135 missions and carried 355 astronauts from 16 countries, many on multiple trips. 

The Space Shuttle, composed of an orbiter launched with two reusable solid rocket boosters and a disposable external fuel tank, carried up to eight astronauts and up to of payload into low Earth orbit (LEO). When its mission was complete, the orbiter would reenter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and land like a glider at either the Kennedy Space Center or Edwards Air Force Base.

The Shuttle is the only winged crewed spacecraft to have achieved orbit and landing, and the first reusable crewed space vehicle that made multiple flights into orbit. Its missions involved carrying large payloads to various orbits including the International Space Station (ISS), providing crew rotation for the space station, and performing service missions on the Hubble Space Telescope. The orbiter also recovered satellites and other payloads (e.g., from the ISS) from orbit and returned them to Earth, though its use in this capacity was rare. Each vehicle was designed with a projected lifespan of 100 launches, or 10 years&#x27; operational life. Original selling points on the shuttles were over 150 launches over a 15-year operational span with a &#x27;launch per month&#x27; expected at the peak of the program, but extensive delays in the development of the International Space Station never created such a peak demand for frequent flights.

==Background==
Various shuttle concepts had been explored since the late 1960s. The program formally commenced in 1972, becoming the sole focus of NASA&#x27;s human spaceflight operations after the Apollo, Skylab, and Apollo–Soyuz programs in 1975. The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public in 1972 as a &#x27;Space Truck&#x27; which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in low Earth orbit during the 1980s and then be replaced by a new vehicle by the early 1990s. The stalled plans for a U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station and were formally initiated in 1983 by President Ronald Reagan, but the ISS suffered from long delays, design changes and cost over-runs and forced the service life of the Space Shuttle to be extended several times until 2011 when it was finally retired—serving twice as long as it was originally designed to do. In 2004, according to President George W. Bush&#x27;s Vision for Space Exploration, use of the Space Shuttle was to be focused almost exclusively on completing assembly of the ISS, which was far behind schedule at that point.

The first experimental orbiter, &quot;Enterprise&quot;, was a high-altitude glider, launched from the back of a specially modified Boeing 747, only for initial atmospheric landing tests (ALT). &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s first test flight was on February 18, 1977, only five years after the Shuttle program was formally initiated; leading to the launch of the first space-worthy shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; on April 12, 1981, on STS-1. The Space Shuttle program finished with its last mission, STS-135 flown by &quot;Atlantis&quot;, in July 2011, retiring the final Shuttle in the fleet. The Space Shuttle program formally ended on August 31, 2011.

==Conception and development==
==Program history==

All Space Shuttle missions were launched from the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida. Some civilian and military circumpolar space shuttle missions were planned for Vandenberg AFB in California. However, the use of Vandenberg AFB for space shuttle missions was canceled after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986. The weather criteria used for launch included, but were not limited to: precipitation, temperatures, cloud cover, lightning forecast, wind, and humidity. The Shuttle was not launched under conditions where it could have been struck by lightning.

The first fully functional orbiter was &quot;Columbia&quot; (designated OV-102), built in Palmdale, California. It was delivered to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979, and was first launched on April 12, 1981—the 20th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s space flight—with a crew of two.

&quot;Challenger&quot; (OV-099) was delivered to KSC in July 1982, &quot;Discovery&quot; (OV-103) in November 1983, &quot;Atlantis&quot; (OV-104) in April 1985 and &quot;Endeavour&quot; (OV-105) in May 1991. &quot;Challenger&quot; was originally built and used as a Structural Test Article (STA-099), but was converted to a complete orbiter when this was found to be less expensive than converting &quot;Enterprise&quot; from its Approach and Landing Test configuration into a spaceworthy vehicle.

On April 24, 1990, &quot;Discovery&quot; carried the Hubble Space Telescope into space during STS-31.

In the course of 135 missions flown, two orbiters (&quot;Columbia&quot; and &quot;Challenger&quot;) suffered catastrophic accidents, with the loss of all crew members, totaling 14 astronauts.

The accidents led to national level inquiries, detailed analysis of why the accidents occurred, and significant pauses where changes were made before the Shuttles returned to flight. After the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in January 1986, there was a delay of 32 months before the next Shuttle launch. A similar delay of 29 months occurred after the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster in February 2003.

The longest Shuttle mission was STS-80 lasting 17 days, 15 hours. The final flight of the Space Shuttle program was STS-135 on July 8, 2011.

Since the Shuttle&#x27;s retirement in 2011, many of its original duties are performed by an assortment of government and private vessels. The European ATV Automated Transfer Vehicle supplied the ISS between 2008 and 2015. Classified military missions are being flown by the US Air Force&#x27;s uncrewed spaceplane, the X-37B. By 2012, cargo to the International Space Station was already being delivered commercially under NASA&#x27;s Commercial Resupply Services by SpaceX&#x27;s partially reusable Dragon spacecraft, followed by Orbital Sciences&#x27; Cygnus spacecraft in late 2013. Crew service to the ISS is currently provided by the Russian Soyuz and, since 2020, the SpaceX Dragon 2 crew capsule, launched on the company&#x27;s reusable Falcon 9 rocket as part of NASA&#x27;s Commercial Crew Development program. Boeing&#x27;s Starliner capsule is scheduled to start ISS crew service from 2025. For missions beyond low Earth orbit, NASA is building the Space Launch System and the Orion spacecraft, part of the Artemis program.

==Budget==

Early during development of the Space Shuttle, NASA had estimated that the program would cost $7.45 billion ($43 billion in 2011 dollars, adjusting for inflation) in development/non-recurring costs, and $9.3M ($54M in 2011 dollars) per flight. Early estimates for the cost to deliver payload to low-Earth orbit were as low as $118 per pound ($260/kg) of payload ($635/lb or $1,400/kg in 2011 dollars), based on marginal or incremental launch costs, and assuming a 65,000 pound (30 000 kg) payload capacity and 50 launches per year. A more realistic projection of 12 flights per year for the 15-year service life combined with the initial development costs would have resulted in a total cost projection for the program of roughly $54 billion (in 2011 dollars).

The total cost of the actual 30-year service life of the Shuttle program through 2011, adjusted for inflation, was $196 billion. In 2010, the incremental cost per flight of the Space Shuttle was $409 million, or to low Earth orbit (LEO). In contrast, the comparable Proton launch vehicle cost was $141 million, or to LEO and the  Soyuz 2.1 was $55 million, or , despite these launch vehicles not being reusable.

NASA&#x27;s budget for 2005 allocated 30%, or $5 billion, to space shuttle operations; this was decreased in 2006 to a request of $4.3 billion. Non-launch costs account for a significant part of the program budget: for example, during fiscal years 2004 to 2006, NASA spent around $13 billion on the Space Shuttle program, even though the fleet was grounded in the aftermath of the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster and there were a total of three launches during this period of time. In fiscal year 2009, NASA budget allocated $2.98 billion for 5 launches to the program, including $490 million for &quot;program integration&quot;, $1.03 billion for &quot;flight and ground operations&quot;, and $1.46 billion for &quot;flight hardware&quot; (which includes maintenance of orbiters, engines, and the external tank between flights.)

Per-launch costs can be measured by dividing the total cost over the life of the program (including buildings, facilities, training, salaries, etc.) by the number of launches. With 135 missions, and the total cost of US$192 billion (in 2010 dollars), this gives approximately $1.5 billion per launch over the life of the Shuttle program. A 2017 study found that carrying one kilogram of cargo to the ISS on the Shuttle cost $272,000 in 2017 dollars, twice the cost of Cygnus and three times that of Dragon.

NASA used a management philosophy known as success-oriented management during the Space Shuttle program which was described by historian Alex Roland in the aftermath of the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster as &quot;hoping for the best&quot;. Success-oriented management has since been studied by several analysts in the area.

==Accidents==
In the course of 135 missions flown, two orbiters were destroyed, with loss of crew totalling 14 astronauts:
* &quot;Challenger&quot; – lost 73 seconds after liftoff, STS-51-L, January 28, 1986
* &quot;Columbia&quot; – lost approximately 16 minutes before its expected landing, STS-107, February 1, 2003

There was also one abort-to-orbit and some fatal accidents on the ground during launch preparations.

===STS-51-L (&quot;Challenger&quot;, 1986)===
Close-up video footage of &quot;Challenger&quot; during its final launch on January 28, 1986, clearly shows that the problems began due to an O-ring failure on the right solid rocket booster (SRB). The hot plume of gas leaking from the failed joint caused the collapse of the external tank, which then resulted in the orbiter&#x27;s disintegration due to high aerodynamic stress. The accident resulted in the loss of all seven astronauts on board. &quot;Endeavour&quot; (OV-105) was built to replace &quot;Challenger&quot; (using structural spare parts originally intended for the other orbiters) and delivered in May 1991; it was first launched a year later.

After the loss of &quot;Challenger&quot;, NASA grounded the Space Shuttle program for over two years, making numerous safety changes recommended by the Rogers Commission Report, which included a redesign of the SRB joint that failed in the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident. Other safety changes included a new escape system for use when the orbiter was in controlled flight, improved landing gear tires and brakes, and the reintroduction of pressure suits for Shuttle astronauts (these had been discontinued after STS-4; astronauts wore only coveralls and oxygen helmets from that point on until the &quot;Challenger&quot; accident). The Shuttle program continued in September 1988 with the launch of &quot;Discovery&quot; on STS-26.

The accidents did not just affect the technical design of the orbiter, but also NASA.
Quoting some recommendations made by the post-&quot;Challenger&quot; Rogers commission:
=== STS-107 (&quot;Columbia&quot;, 2003) ===

The Shuttle program operated accident-free for seventeen years and 88 missions after the &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster, until &quot;Columbia&quot; broke up on reentry, killing all seven crew members, on February 1, 2003. The ultimate cause of the accident was a piece of foam separating from the external tank moments after liftoff and striking the leading edge of the orbiter&#x27;s left wing, puncturing one of the reinforced carbon-carbon (RCC) panels that covered the wing edge and protected it during reentry. As &quot;Columbia&quot; reentered the atmosphere at the end of an otherwise normal mission, hot gas penetrated the wing and destroyed it from the inside out, causing the orbiter to lose control and disintegrate.

After the &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster, the International Space Station operated on a skeleton crew of two for more than two years and was serviced primarily by Russian spacecraft. While the &quot;Return to Flight&quot; mission STS-114 in 2005 was successful, a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed. Although the debris did not strike &quot;Discovery&quot;, the program was grounded once again for this reason.

The second &quot;Return to Flight&quot; mission, STS-121 launched on July 4, 2006, at 14:37 (EDT). Two previous launches were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds around the launch pad, and the launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head. A five-inch (13 cm) crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern; however, the Mission Management Team gave the go for launch. This mission increased the ISS crew to three. &quot;Discovery&quot; touched down successfully on July 17, 2006, at 09:14 (EDT) on Runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center.

Following the success of STS-121, all subsequent missions were completed without major foam problems, and the construction of the ISS was completed (during the STS-118 mission in August 2007, the orbiter was again struck by a foam fragment on liftoff, but this damage was minimal compared to the damage sustained by &quot;Columbia&quot;).

The &quot;Columbia&quot; Accident Investigation Board, in its report, noted the reduced risk to the crew when a Shuttle flew to the International Space Station (ISS), as the station could be used as a safe haven for the crew awaiting rescue in the event that damage to the orbiter on ascent made it unsafe for reentry. The board recommended that for the remaining flights, the Shuttle always orbit with the station. Prior to STS-114, NASA Administrator Sean O&#x27;Keefe declared that all future flights of the Space Shuttle would go to the ISS, precluding the possibility of executing the final Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission which had been scheduled before the &quot;Columbia&quot; accident, despite the fact that millions of dollars worth of upgrade equipment for Hubble were ready and waiting in NASA warehouses. Many dissenters, including astronauts , asked NASA management to reconsider allowing the mission, but initially the director stood firm. On October 31, 2006, NASA announced approval of the launch of &quot;Atlantis&quot; for the fifth and final shuttle servicing mission to the Hubble Space Telescope, scheduled for August 28, 2008. However SM4/STS-125 eventually launched in May 2009.

One impact of &quot;Columbia&quot; was that future crewed launch vehicles, namely the Ares I, had a special emphasis on crew safety compared to other considerations.

==Retirement==
==Preservation==

Out of the five fully functional shuttle orbiters built, three remain. &quot;Enterprise&quot;, which was used for atmospheric test flights but not for orbital flight, had many parts taken out for use on the other orbiters. It was later visually restored and was on display at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center until April 19, 2012. &quot;Enterprise&quot; was moved to New York City in April 2012 to be displayed at the &quot;Intrepid&quot; Museum, whose Space Shuttle Pavilion opened on July 19, 2012. &quot;Discovery&quot; replaced &quot;Enterprise&quot; at the National Air and Space Museum&#x27;s Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center. &quot;Atlantis&quot; formed part of the Space Shuttle Exhibit at the Kennedy Space Center visitor complex and has been on display there since June 29, 2013, following its refurbishment.

On October 14, 2012, &quot;Endeavour&quot; completed an unprecedented drive on city streets from Los Angeles International Airport to the California Science Center, where it has been on display in a temporary hangar since late 2012. The transport from the airport took two days and required major street closures, the removal of over 400 city trees, and extensive work to raise power lines, level the street, and temporarily remove street signs, lamp posts, and other obstacles. Hundreds of volunteers, and fire and police personnel, helped with the transport. Large crowds of spectators waited on the streets to see the shuttle as it passed through the city. &quot;Endeavour&quot;, along with the last flight-qualified external tank (ET-94), is currently on display at the Science Center&#x27;s Samuel Oschin Pavilion (in a horizontal orientation) until the completion of the &quot;Samuel Oschin Air and Space Center&quot; (a planned addition to the California Science Center). Once moved, it will be permanently displayed in launch configuration, complete with genuine solid rocket boosters and external tank.

==Crew modules==
 
One area of Space Shuttle applications is an expanded crew. Crews of up to eight have been flown in the Orbiter, but it could have held at least a crew of ten. Various proposals for filling the payload bay with additional passengers were also made as early as 1979. One proposal by Rockwell provided seating for 74 passengers in the Orbiter payload bay, with support for three days in Earth orbit. With a smaller 64 seat orbiter, costs for the late 1980s would be around US$1.5 million per seat per launch. The Rockwell passenger module had two decks, four seats across on top and two on the bottom, including a 25-inch (63.5 cm) wide aisle and extra storage space.

Another design was Space Habitation Design Associates 1983 proposal for 72 passengers in the Space Shuttle Payload bay. Passengers were located in 6 sections, each with windows and its own loading ramp at launch, and with seats in different configurations for launch and landing. Another proposal was based on the Spacelab habitation modules, which provided 32 seats in the payload bay in addition to those in the cockpit area.

There were some efforts to analyze commercial operation of STS. Using the NASA figure for average cost to launch a Space Shuttle as of 2011 at about $450 million per mission, a cost per seat for a 74 seat module envisioned by Rockwell came to less than $6 million, not including the regular crew. Some passenger modules used hardware similar to existing equipment, such as the tunnel, which was also needed for Spacehab and Spacelab

==Successors==
During the three decades of operation, various follow-on and replacements for the STS Space Shuttle were partially developed but not finished.

Examples of possible future space vehicles to supplement or supplant STS:
*Advanced Crewed Earth-to-Orbit Vehicle
*Shuttle II, Johnson Space Center concept for a follow-on, with 2 boosters and 2 tanks mounted on its wings.
*National Aero-Space Plane (NASP)
**Rockwell X-30 (not funded)
*VentureStar, SSTO spacelane concept using an aerospike engine.
**Lockheed Martin X-33 (cancelled 2001)
*Ares I (ended with Constellation cancellation)
*Orbital Space Plane Program

One effort in the direction of space transportation was the Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) program, initiated in 1994 by NASA. This led to work on the X-33 and X-34 vehicles. NASA spent about US$1 billion on developing the X-33 hoping for it be in operation by 2005. Another program around the turn of the millennium was the Space Launch Initiative, which was a next generation launch initiative.

The Space Launch Initiative program was started in 2001, and in late 2002 it was evolved into two programs, the Orbital Space Plane Program and the Next Generation Launch Technology program. OSP was oriented towards provided access to the International Space Station.

Other vehicles that would have taken over some of the Shuttles responsibilities were the HL-20 Personnel Launch System or the NASA X-38 of the Crew Return Vehicle program, which were primarily for getting people down from ISS. The X-38 was cancelled in 2002, and the HL-20 was cancelled in 1993. Several other programs in this existed such as the Station Crew Return Alternative Module (SCRAM) and Assured Crew Return Vehicle (ACRV)

According to the 2004 Vision for Space Exploration, the next human NASA program was to be Constellation program with its Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles and the Orion spacecraft; however, the Constellation program was never fully funded, and in early 2010 the Obama administration asked Congress to instead endorse a plan with heavy reliance on the private sector for delivering cargo and crew to LEO.

The Commercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program began in 2006 with the purpose of creating commercially operated uncrewed cargo vehicles to service the ISS. The first of these vehicles, SpaceX Dragon 1, became operational in 2012, and the second, Orbital Sciences&#x27;s Cygnus did so in 2014.

The Commercial Crew Development (CCDev) program was initiated in 2010 with the purpose of creating commercially operated crewed spacecraft capable of delivering at least four crew members to the ISS, staying docked for 180 days and then returning them back to Earth. These spacecraft, like SpaceX&#x27;s Dragon 2 and Boeing CST-100 Starliner were expected to become operational around 2020. On the Crew Dragon Demo-2 mission, SpaceX&#x27;s Dragon 2 sent astronauts to the ISS, restoring America&#x27;s human launch capability. The first operational SpaceX mission launched on November 15, 2020, at 7:27:17 p.m. ET, carrying four astronauts to the ISS.

Although the Constellation program was canceled, it has been replaced with a very similar Artemis program. The Orion spacecraft has been left virtually unchanged from its previous design. The planned Ares V rocket has been replaced with the smaller Space Launch System (SLS), which is planned to launch both Orion and other necessary hardware. Exploration Flight Test-1 (EFT-1), an uncrewed test flight of the Orion spacecraft, launched on December 5, 2014, on a Delta IV Heavy rocket.

Artemis 1 is the first flight of the SLS and was launched as a test of the completed Orion and SLS system. During the mission, an uncrewed Orion capsule spent 10 days in a distant retrograde orbit around the Moon before returning to Earth. Artemis 2, the first crewed mission of the program, will launch four astronauts in 2024 on a free-return flyby of the Moon at a distance of . After Artemis 2, the Power and Propulsion Element of the Lunar Gateway and three components of an expendable lunar lander are planned to be delivered on multiple launches from commercial launch service providers. Artemis 3 is planned to launch in 2025 aboard a SLS Block 1 rocket and will use the minimalist Gateway and expendable lander to achieve the first crewed lunar landing of the program. The flight is planned to touch down on the lunar south pole region, with two astronauts staying there for about one week.

==Assets and transition plan==

The Space Shuttle program occupied over 654 facilities, used over 1.2 million line items of equipment, and employed over 5,000 people. The total value of equipment was over $12 billion. Shuttle-related facilities represented over a quarter of NASA&#x27;s inventory. There were over 1,200 active suppliers to the program throughout the United States. NASA&#x27;s transition plan had the program operating through 2010 with a transition and retirement phase lasting through 2015. During this time, the Ares I and Orion as well as the Altair Lunar Lander were to be under development, although these programs have since been canceled.

In the 2010s, two major programs for human spaceflight are Commercial Crew Program and the Artemis program. Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39A is, for example, used to launch Falcon Heavy and Falcon 9.

==Criticism==

==Support vehicles==

Many other vehicles were used in support of the Space Shuttle program, mainly terrestrial transportation vehicles.

* The crawler-transporter carried the mobile launcher platform and the Space Shuttle from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to Launch Complex 39, originally built for Project Apollo.
* The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (SCA) were two modified Boeing 747s. Either could fly an orbiter from alternative landing sites back to the Kennedy Space Center. These aircraft were retired to the Joe Davies Heritage Airpark at the Armstrong Flight Research Center and Space Center Houston.
* A 36-wheeled transport trailer, the Orbiter Transfer System, originally built for the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s launch facility at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California (since then converted for Delta IV rockets) would transport the orbiter from the landing facility to the launch pad, which allowed both &quot;stacking&quot; and launch without utilizing a separate VAB-style building and crawler-transporter roadway. Prior to the closing of the Vandenberg facility, orbiters were transported from the OPF to the VAB on their undercarriages, only to be raised when the orbiter was being lifted for attachment to the SRB/ET stack. The trailer allowed the transportation of the orbiter from the OPF to either the SCA &quot;Mate-Demate&quot; stand or the VAB without placing any additional stress on the undercarriage.
* The Crew Transport Vehicle (CTV), a modified airport jet bridge, was used to assist astronauts to egress from the orbiter after landing. Upon entering the CTV, astronauts could take off their launch and reentry suits then proceed to chairs and beds for medical checks before being transported back to the crew quarters in the Operations and Checkout Building. Originally built for Project Apollo.
* The Astrovan was used to transport astronauts from the crew quarters in the Operations and Checkout Building to the launch pad on launch day. It was also used to transport astronauts back again from the Crew Transport Vehicle at the Shuttle Landing Facility.
* The three locomotives serving the NASA Railroad, used to transport segments of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters, were determined to be no longer needed for day-to-day operation at the Kennedy Space Center. In April 2015, locomotive No. 1 was sent to Natchitoches Parish Port and No. 3 sent to the Madison Railroad. Locomotive No. 2 was sent to the Gold Coast Railroad Museum in 2014.
