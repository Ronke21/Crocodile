<text>Year 244 ([[Roman numerals|CCXLIV]]) was a leap year starting on Monday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of [[Tiberius Pollenius Armenius Peregrinus|Armenius]] and Aemilianus (or, less frequently, year 997 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 244 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>In grammar, the inessive case (abbreviated ; from &quot;to be in or at&quot;) is a locative grammatical case. This case carries the basic meaning of &quot;in&quot;: for example, &quot;in the house&quot; is in Finnish, in Estonian, () in Moksha, in Basque, in Lithuanian, in Latgalian and in Hungarian.

In Finnish the inessive case is typically formed by adding . Estonian adds to the genitive stem. In Moksha () is added (in Erzya ()). In Hungarian, the suffix is most commonly used for inessive case, although many others, such as and others are also used, especially with cities.

In the Finnish language, the inessive case is considered the first (in Estonian the second) of the six locative cases, which correspond to prepositions in English. The remaining five cases are:

* Elative case (&quot;out of&quot;)
* Illative case (&quot;into&quot;)
* Allative case (&quot;onto&quot;)
* Adessive case (&quot;on&quot;)
* Ablative case (&quot;from&quot;)

==Finnish==

The Finnish language inessive uses the suffix or (depending on vowel harmony). It is usually added to nouns and associated adjectives.

It is used in the following ways:

* Expressing the static state of being in something.
:: = &quot;we live in Finland&quot;

* (with time expressions) stating how long something took to be accomplished or done
:possible English translations include &quot;in, within&quot;
:: = &quot;within 2 years, during 2 years&quot;

* when two things are closely connected
:English translations can include &quot;on&quot; in phrases of this type
:: = &quot;N.N. on the phone&quot; 
:: = &quot;the ring is on my finger&quot;

*as an existensial clause with the verb (to be), to express possession of objects
:: = &quot;the newspaper has 68 pages&quot;

*with the verb , 
:: = &quot;I visit the bar&quot;

*There are both singular and plural forms
:: = &quot;I visit the bars&quot;

=== Dialectal variants ===
In a large part of the southwestern, south Ostrobothnian, southeastern as well as in some Tavastian dialects, the suffix is simply &quot;-s&quot; (e.g. &quot;maas&quot;, &quot;talos&quot;), similarly to Estonian. This is an example of apocope. When coupled with a possessive suffix, the result can be like in standard Finnish &quot;&quot;maassani, talossani&quot; or a shorter &quot;maasani, talosani&quot;&quot; depending on the dialect: the former is more common in Tavastian and southeastern dialects while the latter is more common in southwestern dialects.

Most central and northern Ostrobothnian dialects as well as some southwestern and Peräpohjola dialects use a shorter suffix &quot;-sa/-sä&quot;, e.g. &quot;maasa, talosa&quot;.

<text>In grammar, the elative case (abbreviated ; from &quot;to bring or carry out&quot;) is a locative grammatical case signifying that something comes from something, somewhere or someone.

==Usage==
===Uralic languages===
In Finnish, the elative is typically formed by adding , in Estonian by adding to the genitive stem, in Livonian and in Erzya. In Hungarian, the suffix expresses the elative:

: - &quot;out of the house, from the house&quot; (Finnish = &quot;house&quot;) - &quot;out of the houses, from the houses&quot; (Finnish = &quot;houses&quot;)
: - &quot;out of the house, from the house&quot; (Estonian = &quot;house&quot;)
:Erzya: - &quot;out of the house, from the house&quot; (Erzya = &quot;house&quot;)
: - &quot;out of the house&quot; (Hungarian = &quot;house&quot;)

In some dialects of Finnish it is common to drop the final vowel of the elative ending, which then becomes identical to the elative morpheme of Estonian; for example: . This pronunciation is common in southern Finland, appearing in the southwestern dialects and in some Tavastian dialects. Most other dialects use the standard form &quot;-sta&quot;.

===Russian===
In some rare cases the elative still exists in contemporary Russian, though it was used more widely in 17-18th cc. texts: (out of the forest), (blood from the nose), (from Yaroslavl).

==See also==

Other locative cases are:
*Inessive case (&quot;in&quot;)
*Illative case (&quot;into&quot;)
*Adessive case (&quot;on&quot;)
*Allative case (&quot;onto&quot;)
*Ablative case (&quot;off&quot;)
*Delative case (&quot;off of a surface&quot;)

<text>Year 239 ([[Roman numerals|CCXXXIX]]) was a common year starting on Tuesday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Gordianus and Aviola (or, less frequently, year 992 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 239 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

<text>In grammar, the illative case (; abbreviated ; from &quot;brought in&quot;) is a grammatical case used in the Finnish, Estonian, Lithuanian, Latvian and Hungarian languages. It is one of the locative cases, and has the basic meaning of &quot;into (the inside of)&quot;. An example from Hungarian is (&#x27;into the house&#x27;, with meaning &#x27;the house&#x27;). An example from Estonian is and (&#x27;into the house&#x27;), formed from (&#x27;house&#x27;). An example from Finnish is (&#x27;into the house&#x27;), formed from (&#x27;a house&#x27;), another from Lithuanian is (&#x27;into the boat&#x27;) formed from (&#x27;boat&#x27;), and from Latvian (&#x27;into the boat&#x27;) formed from (&#x27;boat&#x27;).

==In Finnish==
The case is formed by adding &quot;-hVn&quot;, where &#x27;V&#x27; represents the last vowel, and then removing the &#x27;h&#x27; if a simple long vowel would result. For example, + &quot;Vn&quot; becomes with a simple long &#x27;oo&#x27;; cf. + &quot;hVn&quot; becomes , without the elision of &#x27;h&#x27;. This unusually complex way of adding a suffix can be explained by its reconstructed origin: a voiced palatal fricative. (Modern Finnish has lost palatalization and fricatives other than &#x27;h&#x27; or &#x27;s&#x27;.) In some dialects spoken in Ostrobothnia, notably South Ostrobothnia, the &#x27;h&#x27; is not removed; one says . Some dialects of Finland Proper and Kymenlaakso also have a similar feature. In some instances is added, e.g. (room) and (London) thus and respectively.

The other locative cases in Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian are:
*Inessive case (&quot;(to be) in&quot;)
*Elative case (&quot;out of&quot;)
*Adessive case (&quot;(to be) on&quot;)
*Allative case (&quot;onto&quot;)
*Ablative case (&quot;from, off&quot;)

==In Lithuanian==
The illative case, denoting direction of movement, is now less common in the standard language but is common in the spoken language, especially in certain dialects. Its singular form, heard more often than the plural, appears in books, newspapers, etc. Most Lithuanian nouns can take the illative ending, indicating that from the descriptive point of view the illative still can be treated as a case in Lithuanian. Since the beginning of the 20th century it isn&#x27;t included in the lists of standard Lithuanian cases in most grammar books and textbooks, and the prepositional construction į+accusative is more frequently used today to denote direction. The illative case was used extensively in older Lithuanian; the first Lithuanian grammar book, by Daniel Klein, mentions both illative and į+accusative but calls the usage of the illative &quot;more elegant&quot;. Later, it has often appeared in the written texts of the authors who grew up in Dzūkija or Eastern Aukštaitija, such as Vincas Krėvė-Mickevičius.

The illative case in Lithuanian has its own endings, which are different for each declension paradigm, although quite regular, compared with some other Lithuanian cases. An ending of the illative always ends with in the singular, and is the final part of an ending of the illative in the plural.

Certain fixed phrases in the standard language are illatives, such as (&quot;to arraign&quot;), (&quot;turn right&quot;), (&quot;for the sake of&quot; or &quot;in the name of&quot;, e.g., in the name of the political party &quot;Vardan Lietuvos&quot;, &quot;For Lithuania&quot;).

<text>An adessive case (abbreviated ; from Latin &quot;&quot; &quot;to be present (at)&quot;: &quot;ad&quot; &quot;at&quot; + &quot;esse&quot; &quot;to be&quot;) is a grammatical case generally denoting location at, upon, or adjacent to the referent of the noun; the term is used most frequently for Uralic studies. For Uralic languages, such as Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian, it is the fourth of the locative cases, with the basic meaning of &quot;on&quot;—for example, Estonian &#x27; (table) and&#x27; (on the table), Hungarian &#x27; and&#x27; (at the table). It is also used as an instrumental case in Finnish.

For Finnish, the suffix is &quot;/&quot;, e.g. &#x27; (table) and&#x27; (on the table). In addition, it can specify &quot;being around the place&quot;, as in &#x27; (at the school including the schoolyard), as contrasted with the inessive&#x27; (in the school, inside the building).

In Estonian, the ending &quot;-l&quot; is added to the genitive case, e.g. &#x27; (table) -&#x27; (on the table). Besides the meaning &quot;on&quot;, this case is also used to indicate ownership. For example, &quot;mehel on auto&quot; means &quot;the man owns a car&quot;.

As the Uralic languages don&#x27;t possess the verb &quot;to have&quot;, the concept is expressed as a subject in the adessive case + &quot;on&quot; (for example, &quot;&quot;, &quot;I have&quot;, literally &quot;at me is&quot;).
The other locative cases in Finnish, Estonian, and Hungarian are:
*Inessive case (&quot;in&quot;)
*Elative case (&quot;out of&quot;)
*Illative case (&quot;into&quot;)
*Allative case (&quot;onto&quot;)
*Ablative case (&quot;off&quot;)
*Superessive case (&quot;on top of, or on the surface of&quot;)

==Finnish==

The Finnish adessive case has the word ending or (according to the rules of vowel harmony). It is usually added to nouns and associated adjectives.

It is used in the following ways.

* Expressing the static state of being on the surface of something. 
:Possible English meanings of &quot;on&quot;, &quot;on top of&quot;, or &quot;atop&quot;
:: - &quot;The pen is on the table.&quot;

*As an existential clause with the verb &quot;olla&quot; (to be) to express possession
:This is the Finnish way to express the English verb &quot;to have&quot;
:: = &quot;We have a dog. (&#x27;on our (possession, responsibility, etc.) is dog&#x27;)&quot;

* Expressing the instrumental use of something
:Possible English meanings of &quot;with&quot;, &quot;by&quot; or &quot;using&quot;
::&quot; - He went to Helsinki by train.&quot;
::&quot; - He bought it for a Euro.&quot;

* In certain time expressions expressing the time at which events occur
:Possible English meanings of &quot;during&quot;, &quot;in&quot; or &quot;over&quot;
::&quot; - In the morning. 
::&quot;&quot; - &quot;During Spring.&quot;

* Expressing the general proximity in space or time at which something occurs (where the more specific proximity case would be the inessive)
:Possible English meaning of &quot;at&quot;
:: - &quot;My son is at school.&quot; 
:::(c.f. inessive case: - &quot;My son is inside the school.&quot;) 
:: - &quot;He is at lunch.&quot; - literally &quot;on the lunch hour&quot;.
:::(This proximity difference corresponds to adverbial forms such as - &quot;around here&quot; and - &quot;right here&quot;,
though they are not strictly a use of the adessive case).

==Non-Uralic==

Other languages which employ an adessive case or case function include archaic varieties of Lithuanian (which likely developed by the influence of Uralic), some Northeast Caucasian languages such as Lezgian and Hunzib, and the Ossetic languages, both ancient and modern.

<doc id="42839" wikidata="Q655020" url="?curid=42839" title="Allative case">
<text>The allative case ( ; abbreviated ; from Latin &quot;allāt-&quot;, &quot;afferre&quot; &quot;to bring to&quot;) is a type of locative grammatical case. The term allative is generally used for the lative case for the majority of languages that do not make finer distinctions.

==Finnish==
For the Finnish language (a Uralic language), the allative is the fifth of the locative cases, with the basic meaning of &quot;onto&quot;. Its ending is &quot;-lle&quot;, for example &quot;pöytä&quot; (table) and &quot;pöydälle&quot; (onto the top of the table). In addition, it is the logical complement of the adessive case for referring to &quot;being around the place&quot;. For example, &quot;koululle&quot; means &quot;to the vicinity of the school&quot;. With time, the use is the same: &quot;ruokatunti&quot; (lunch break) and &quot;... lähti ruokatunnille&quot; (&quot;... left to the lunch break&quot;). Some actions require the case, e.g. &quot;kävely&quot; - &quot;mennä kävelylle&quot; &quot;a walk - go for a walk&quot;. It also means &quot;to&quot; or &quot;for&quot;, for example &quot;minä&quot; (me) and &quot;minulle&quot; (to/for me).

The other locative cases in Finnish and Estonian are these:
*Inessive case (&quot;in&quot;)
*Elative case (&quot;out of&quot;)
*Illative case (&quot;into&quot;)
*Adessive case (&quot;on&quot;)
*Ablative case (&quot;from off&quot;)

==Baltic languages==
For the Lithuanian and Latvian languages, the allative had been used dialectally as an innovation since Proto-Indo-European, but it is almost out of use in modern times. Its ending in Lithuanian is &quot;-op&quot; which was shortened from &quot;-opi&quot;, whereas its ending in Latvian is &quot;-up&quot;. For the modern languages the remains of the allative can be found in certain fixed expressions that have become adverbs, such as Lithuanian &quot;išėjo Dievop&quot; (&quot;gone to God&quot;, i.e. died), &quot;velniop!&quot; (&quot;to the devil&quot; i.e. to hell), &quot;nuteisti myriop&quot; (&quot;sentence to death&quot;), &quot;rudeniop&quot; (&quot;towards autumn&quot;), &quot;vakarop&quot; (&quot;towards the evening&quot;), Latvian &quot;mājup&quot; (&quot;towards home&quot;), &quot;kalnup&quot; (&quot;uphill&quot;), &quot;lejup&quot; (&quot;downhill&quot;).

==Greek==
For Mycenaean Greek, an ending &quot;-de&quot; is used to denote an allative, when it is not being used as an enclitic, e.g. &quot;te-qa-de&quot;, *&quot;Tʰēgʷasde&quot;, &quot;to Thebes&quot; (Linear B: ). This ending survives into Ancient Greek in words such as &quot;Athḗnaze&quot;, from accusative &quot;Athḗnās&quot; + &quot;-de&quot;.

==Latin==
The Latin accusative case is used for motion towards towns and small islands in a manner that is analogous to the allative case.

== Udmurt ==
For the Udmurt language, words inflected with the allative (often termed &quot;approximative&quot; for Permic languages) case ending &quot;-лань&quot; /ɫɑɲ/ express the direction of a movement.

==Hebrew==
In Biblical Hebrew (more common in Classical Biblical Hebrew than in Late Biblical Hebrew) the &quot;directional &quot;he&quot;&quot;, &quot;locative &quot;he&quot;&quot; or &quot;he locale&quot;, in the form of /-ɔh/ suffixed to nouns (often place names) also functions as an allative marker, usually translated as &#x27;to&#x27; or &#x27;toward&#x27;. The directional &quot;he&quot; appears in later phases of the Hebrew language in expressions such as (upwards) and (homeward).

==Wanyi==
Wanyi, an endangered Australian language, has the allative suffixes &quot;-kurru/wurru&quot;.

<text>Year 238 ([[Roman numerals|CCXXXVIII]]) was a common year starting on Monday of the Julian calendar. At the time, it was known as the Year of the Consulship of Pius and Pontianus (or, less frequently, year 991 &quot;[[Ab urbe condita]]&quot;). The denomination 238 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the Anno Domini calendar era became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

== Events ==
&lt;onlyinclude&gt;

=== By place ===
==== Roman Empire ====
* Emperor Maximinus Thrax campaigns against the Carpians on the Danube in Moesia (Balkans). In spite of the payment of a tribute, the Romans fail to persuade the Goths and the Germanic tribes.
* March – Roman subjects in Africa revolt against Maximinus. The elderly Gordian yields to public demand that he succeed Maximinus and rules jointly with his 46-year-old son Gordian II.
* April – Battle of Carthage: Numidian forces loyal to Maximinus invade Africa with support of Legio III &quot;Augusta&quot;. Gordian II is killed and after a siege, Gordian I commits suicide by hanging himself with his belt.
* May – The Senate outlaws Maximinus for his bloodthirsty proscriptions in Ancient Rome and nominates two of its members, Pupienus and Balbinus, to the throne.
* Maximinus advances to the town Aquileia in northern Italy; his army suffers from famine and disease, while the city is besieged. Soldiers of Legio II &quot;Parthica&quot; kill him in his tent, along with his son Maximinus (who is appointed co-emperor). Their corpses are decapitated and their heads carried to Rome.
* August – The Praetorian Guard storms the palace and captures Pupienus and Balbinus. They are dragged naked through the streets of Rome and executed. On the same day Gordian III, age 13, is proclaimed the new emperor. Timesitheus becomes his tutor and advisor.
* Future Emperor Valerian becomes &quot;princeps senatus&quot;.
* The Colosseum is restored after being damaged.
* The Goths, coming from Ukraine, cross the Danube and devastate the Roman Empire up to the border with Anatolia.

<text>In grammar, the essive case, or similaris case, (abbreviated ) is a grammatical case. The essive case on a noun can express it as a definite period of time during which something happens or during which a continuous action was completed. It can also denote a form as a temporary location, state of being, or character in which the subject was at a given time. The latter meaning is often described as the equivalent of the English phrase &quot;as a __&quot;.

==Finnish==
In Finnish, it is marked by adding &quot;/&quot; (depending on the vowel harmony) to the stem of the noun.
:Examples:
:&quot;&quot; &quot;child&quot; → &quot;lapsena&quot; &quot;as a child&quot;, &quot;when (I) was a child&quot;.

: &quot;My brother is a composer (at somewhere or a certain kind of).&quot;
:cf: (Nom) (My brother is a composer) vs. (Ess) (My brother works/acts as a composer (somewhere))
:&#x27; &quot;composer&quot; → &#x27; &quot;state of being a composer (the given time is the present)&quot;
:Example: &quot;&quot;&#x27; &quot;My brother is a composer in an orchestra&quot;.
:Example: &quot;&quot;&#x27; &quot;As a composer my brother is unique&quot;.

In Finnish, the essive case is technically categorized as an old locative case, a case that, in some way, indicates spatial location. However, in the present language, the case has lost the majority of its spatial meaning. The case instead typically denotes a state that is temporary or inclined to change.

Some fixed expressions retain the essive in its ancient locative meaning, however: &quot;at home&quot; is . 
:Example: &quot;&quot; &quot;I read newspapers at home.&quot;

If the inessive were used, , it would distinguish the activity from reading the papers, such as in the garage or in the garden (of the home).
* &quot;&quot; &quot;I have a bathroom in my home&quot; (not in the garage or garden).

The essive case is also used in a temporal sense with certain nouns, notably the names of weekdays, and (year), (morning), (evening), and (night), as well as dates.
:&quot;&quot; &quot;(on) last Monday.&quot;
:&quot;&quot; &quot;on 6 December&quot;.
:&quot;&quot; &quot;on this day&quot;
:&quot;&quot; &quot;(during) last year&quot;

When marking something that cannot literally change states, the essive case can implicate the presence of alternative states, even two individual, differing &quot;worlds&quot;. That can be seen in the following example:

:Example: &quot;&quot; &quot;I bought the pearl thinking it was genuine [but later found out that it was not].&quot;

The example above illustrates the process by which marking of the essive case can be seen as creating two differing &quot;worlds&quot;: one real and one illusionary. The &quot;temporary&quot; component of the meaning encoded by marking of the essive case on the Finnish word for &quot;genuine&quot; () makes a distinction between the perceived state of the subject, as genuine at the time of purchase, and the actual state of subject, as not genuine as it is now perceived or at the time of the moment of speech.

==Estonian==
In Estonian, it is marked by adding &quot;-na&quot; to the genitive stem. Marking of the case in Estonian denotes the capacity in which the subject acts. The essive case is used for indicating &quot;states of being&quot; but not of &quot;becoming&quot;, which is instead marked by the translative case, the elative case, or the nominative case.

:Examples:

:&quot; &quot;He works as an engineer.&quot;

In Finnish, it is the counterpart of the essive case, with the basic meaning of a change of state. It is also used for expressing &quot;in (a language)&quot;, &quot;considering it is a (status)&quot; and &quot;by (a time)&quot;. Its ending is &quot;-ksi&quot;:
* &quot;pitkä&quot; &quot;long&quot;, &quot;venyi pitkäksi&quot; &quot;(it) stretched long&quot;
* &quot;englanti&quot; &quot;English&quot;, &quot;En osaa sanoa tätä englanniksi&quot; &quot;I can&#x27;t say this in English&quot;
* &quot;pentu&quot; &quot;cub&quot;, &quot;Se on pennuksi iso&quot; &quot;For a cub, it is big&quot;
* &quot;musta aukko&quot; &quot;black hole&quot;, &quot;(muuttui) mustaksi aukoksi&quot; &quot;(turned into) a black hole&quot;
* &quot;kello kuusi&quot; &quot;(at) six o&#x27; clock&quot;, &quot;kello kuudeksi&quot; &quot;by six o&#x27; clock&quot;

Examples in Estonian, where the ending is &quot;-ks&quot;:
* &quot;pikk&quot; &quot;long&quot;, &quot;venis pikaks&quot; &quot;(it) stretched long&quot;
* &quot;must auk&quot; &quot;black hole&quot;, &quot;(muutus/muundus) mustaks auguks&quot; &quot;(turned into) a black hole&quot;
* &quot;kell kuus&quot; &quot;(at) six o&#x27; clock&quot;, &quot;kella kuueks&quot; &quot;by six o&#x27; clock&quot;
In Estonian, translative can also express a temporary or random state. E.g. while a nominative construction would indicate working in a job or profession, as &quot;olen koolis õpetaja&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m a teacher in a school&quot;, a similar sentence using translative &quot;olen koolis õpetajaks&quot; &quot;I work as a teacher in a school&quot; hints at it either being a temporary position, the speaker not being fully qualified, or some other factor of impermanency.

In Hungarian, the ending is -vá / -vé after a vowel; it assimilates to the final consonant otherwise:

* &quot;só&quot; &quot;salt&quot;, &quot;Lót felesége sóvá változott&quot; &quot;Lot&#x27;s wife turned into salt&quot;
* &quot;fiú&quot; &quot;boy; son&quot; &quot;fiává fogad&quot; &quot;adopt as one&#x27;s son&quot;
* &quot;bolond&quot; &quot;fool&quot; &quot;bolonddá tett engem&quot; &quot;He made a fool out of me.&quot;

<text>In grammar, the instructive case is a grammatical case used in Finnish, Estonian, and the Turkic languages.

== Uralic languages ==
In Finnish, the instructive case is used to indicate means, manner, instrument, location, or time. It is almost exclusively used in fixed expressions, such as in &#x27;with one&#x27;s own eyes&#x27;. However, the instructive is productive for infinitive verbal constructions to indicate manner, as in &#x27;laughing&#x27;: &#x27;They stepped in through the door laughing&#x27;.

In modern Finnish, many of its instrumental uses are being superseded by the adessive case, as in &quot;minä matkustin junalla&quot; &#x27;I travelled by train&#x27;.

The instructive case is only marginally present in Estonian in lexicalized expressions. Language reformers of the 20th century did try to revive it, but with little success.

== Turkish ==
In Turkish, the suffix &quot;-le&quot; is used for this purpose; for example, &quot;Trenle geldim&quot; &#x27;I came via train&#x27;.

<text>In linguistics, abessive (abbreviated or ), caritive (abbreviated ) and privative (abbreviated ) is the grammatical case expressing the lack or absence of the marked noun. In English, the corresponding function is expressed by the preposition &quot;&quot; or by the suffix &quot;.&quot;

The name &quot;abessive&quot; is derived from &quot;to be away/absent&quot;, and is especially used in reference to Uralic languages. The name &quot;caritive&quot; is derived from &quot;to lack&quot;, and is especially used in reference to Caucasian languages. The name &quot;privative&quot; is derived from &quot;to deprive&quot;.

==In Afro-Asiatic languages==

===Somali===
In the Somali language, the abessive case is marked by . For example:
: &quot;name&quot;
: &quot;nameless&quot;
: &quot;clothes&quot;
: &quot;clothesless,&quot; i.e., naked

==In Australian languages==

===Martuthunira===
In Martuthunira, the privative case is formed with either or .

==In Uralic languages==

===Finnish===
In the Finnish language, the abessive case is marked by for back vowels and for front vowels according to vowel harmony. For example:
: &quot;money&quot;
: &quot;without money&quot;
An equivalent construction exists using the word and the partitive:
: &quot;without money&quot;
or, less commonly:
: &quot;without money&quot;
The abessive case of nouns is rarely used in writing and even less in speech, although some abessive forms are more common than their equivalent forms:
: &quot;unsuccessfully, fruitlessly&quot;
: &quot;I cried for no reason.&quot;
The abessive is, however, commonly used in nominal forms of verbs (formed with the affix / ):
: &quot;without speaking&quot;
: &quot;without buying&quot;
: &quot;without caring&quot;
: &quot;The train didn&#x27;t show up.&quot;
This form can often be replaced by using the negative form of the verb:
: &quot;The train didn&#x27;t show up.&quot;

It is possible to occasionally hear what is considered wrong usage of the abessive in Finnish, where the abessive and forms are combined:
There is debate as to whether this is interference from Estonian.

===Estonian===

Estonian also uses the abessive, which is marked by in both the singular and the plural:
: &quot;without a car&quot; (the preposition &quot;without&quot; is optional)
Unlike in Finnish, the abessive is commonly used in both written and spoken Estonian.

The nominal forms of verbs are marked with the affix and the abessive marker :
: &quot;The train didn&#x27;t show up.&quot;

Tallinn has a pair of bars that play on the use of the comitative and abessive, the (the nameless bar) and the (the bar with a name).

===Skolt Sami===

The abessive marker for nouns in Skolt Sámi is or in both the singular and the plural:
: &quot;I cried for no reason.&quot;
The abessive-like non-finite verb form (converb) is or :
: &quot;He/she went home without saying why he/she had come.&quot;
Unlike Finnish, the Skolt Sámi abessive has no competing expression for lack of an item.

===Inari Sami===

The abessive marker for nouns in Inari Sámi is . The corresponding non-finite verb form is , or .

===Other Sami languages===
The abessive is not used productively in the Western Sámi languages, although it may occur as a cranberry morpheme.

===Hungarian===
In Hungarian, the abessive case is marked by for back vowels and for front vowels according to vowel harmony. Sometimes, with certain roots, the suffix becomes or . For example:
: &quot;money&quot;
: &quot;without money&quot;
: &quot;home(land)&quot;
: &quot;(one) without a homeland&quot;
There is also the postposition , which also means without, but is not meant for physical locations.
: &quot;I drink tea without sugar.&quot;
: &quot;I lived without siblings.&quot;
: &quot;Did you come to Hungary without your sibling?&quot;

==In Mongolic languages==

===Mongolian===

In Mongolian, the privative suffix is (). It is not universally considered to be a case, because the suffix does not conform to vowel harmony or undergo any stem-dependent orthographical variation. However, its grammatical function is the precise inverse of the comitative case, and the two form a pair of complementary case forms.

<doc id="42847" wikidata="Q838581" url="?curid=42847" title="Comitative case">
<text>In grammar, the comitative case (abbreviated ) is a grammatical case that denotes accompaniment. In English, the preposition &quot;with&quot;, in the sense of &quot;in company with&quot; or &quot;together with&quot;, plays a substantially similar role. Other uses of &quot;with&quot;, like in the meaning of &quot;using&quot; or &quot;by means of&quot; (I cut bread with a knife), correspond to the instrumental case or related cases.

==Core meaning==
The comitative case encodes a relationship of &quot;accompaniment&quot; between two participants in an event, called the &quot;accompanier&quot; and the &quot;companion&quot;. In addition, there is a &quot;relator&quot; (which can be of multiple lexical categories, but is most commonly an affix or adposition). Use of the comitative case gives prominence to the accompanier. This Italian sentence is an example:

:[&quot;il professore&quot;]accompanier &quot;entra nell&#x27;aula&quot; [&quot;con&quot;]relator [&quot;i suoi studenti&quot;]companion
:&#x27;the professor enters the lecture-hall (together) with his students&#x27;.

In this case, is the accompanier, is the companion, and is the relator. As the accompanier, is the most prominent.

Animacy also plays a major role in most languages with a comitative case. One group of languages requires both the accompanier and the companion to be either human or animate. Another group requires both to be in the same category: both human or both animate. A third group requires an animate accompanier and an inanimate companion. Other languages have no restrictions based on animacy.

==Comparison to similar cases==

The comitative case is often conflated or confused with other similar cases, especially the instrumental case and the associative case.

The comitative relates to an accompanier and a companion, and the instrumental relates to an agent, an object, and a patient. Enrique Palancar defines the role of Instrumental case as &#x27;the role played by the object the Agent manipulates to achieve a change of state of the Patient.&#x27; Even though the difference is straightforward, because the instrumental and the comitative are expressed the same way in many languages, including English, it is often difficult to separate them.

Russian is one of many languages that differentiate morphologically between instrumental and comitative:

In Russian, the comitative is marked by adding a preposition and by declining the companion in the instrumental case; the design as a whole becomes comitative. In the instrumental case, the object is declined, but no preposition is added.

The comitative case is often confused with the associative case. Before the term comitative was applied to the accompanier-companion relationship, the relationship was often called associative case, a term still used by some linguists.

It is important to distinguish between the comitative and the associative because the associative also refers to a specific variety of the comitative case that is used in Hungarian.

==Expressions of comitative semantic relation==

Grammatical case is a category of inflectional morphology. The comitative case is an expression of the comitative semantic relation through inflectional affixation, by prefixes, suffixes and circumfixes. Although all three major types of affixes are used in at least a few languages, suffixes are the most common expression. Languages which use affixation to express the comitative include Hungarian, which uses suffixes; Totonac, which uses prefixes; and Chukchi, which uses circumfixes.

Comitative relations are also commonly expressed by using adpositions: prepositions, postpositions and circumpositions. Examples of languages that use adpositional constructions to express comitative relations are French, which uses prepositions; Wayãpi, which uses postpositions; and Bambara, which uses circumpositions.

Adverbial constructions can also mark comitative relations, but they act very similarly to adpositions. One language that uses adverbs to mark the comitative case is Latvian.

The final way in which comitative relations can be expressed is by serial-verb constructions. In these languages, the comitative marker is usually a verb whose basic meaning is &quot;to follow&quot;. A language which marks comitative relations with serial-verb constructions is Chinese.

==Examples==

===Indo-European languages===
====Latvian====
In Latvian, both instrumental and comitative are expressed with the preposition However, it is used only when the companion is in accusative and singular or when it is in dative and plural. Otherwise the co-ordinating conjunction is used.

In the example above, is used because Rudolf, the companion, is in accusative and singular. Below, it is used in the other case that it is allowed, with a dative plural companion.

===Uralic languages===

====Estonian====

In Estonian, the comitative () marker is the suffix .

====Finnish====
In Finnish, the comitative case () consists of the suffix with adjectives and + a mandatory possessive suffix with the main noun. There is no singular-plural distinction; only the plural of the comitative exists and is used in both singular and plural senses, and thus it always appears as . For instance, &quot;with their big ships&quot; is
while &quot;with his/her big ships&quot; is
It is rarely used and is mainly a feature of formal literary language, appearing very rarely in everyday speech.

The much more common, less formal way of expressing &quot;with&quot; is with the postposition , e.g., . The two forms may contrast, however, since the comitative always comes with the possessive suffix and thus can only be used when the agent has some sort of possession of the thing expressed by the main noun. For instance, , , has contrasted with , the former &quot;possessed&quot;, the latter not.

Colloquial Finnish also has the postposition , derived from and cognate with the Estonian . With pronouns it is written as a suffix, . Compare also Ingrian , e.g., .

====Sami languages====
As there are many Sami languages there are variations between them. In the largest Sami language, Northern Sami, the comitative case means either communion, fellowship, connection - or instrument, tool. It can be used either as an object or as an adverbial.

It is expressed through the suffix in the singular and in the plural.

An example of the object use in Northern Sami is . An example of the adverbial use is .

====Hungarian====
In Hungarian, comitative case is marked by the suffix , as shown in the example below.

However, the comitative case marker cannot be used if the companion has a plural marker. So when the comitative marker is added to a noun, it obscures whether that noun is singular or plural.

===Chukchi===

Chukchi uses a circumfix to express comitative case.

In the example, the circumfix гама is attached to the root to express comitative.

===Drehu===

In Drehu, there are two prepositions which can be used to mark comitative. Which of the prepositions is used is determined by the classes of the accompanier and companion.

===Hausa===

The comitative marker in Hausa is the preposition . In Hausa, a prepositional phrase marked for comitative can be moved to the front of the sentence for emphasis, as shown in the examples below.

In Hausa it is ungrammatical to do the same with coordinating conjunctions. For example, if the companions were &quot;dog and cat&quot;, it would be ungrammatical to move either &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;cat&quot; to the front of the sentence for emphasis, while it is grammatical to do so when there is a comitative marker rather than a conjunction.

<text>In grammar, the prolative case (abbreviated ), also called the vialis case (abbreviated ), prosecutive case (abbreviated ), traversal case, mediative case, or translative case, is a grammatical case of a noun or pronoun that has the basic meaning of &quot;by way of&quot; or &quot;via&quot;.

In Finnish, the prolative case follows an established application in a number of fossilized expressions to indicate &quot;by (medium of transaction)&quot;. It can be used in other constructions, but then it does not sound &quot;natural&quot;. Examples would be &quot;postitse&quot; (&quot;by post&quot;), &quot;puhelimitse&quot; (&quot;by telephone&quot;), &quot;meritse&quot; (&quot;by sea&quot;), &quot;netitse&quot; (&quot;over the Internet&quot;). A number of Finnish grammarians classify the prolative form as an adverb because it does not require agreement with adjectives like other Finnish cases. This claim is not true, however, because an adjective will agree with the prolative: &quot;Hän hoiti asian pitkitse kirjeitse&quot; (&quot;He/she dealt with the matter by way of a long letter&quot;).

The prolative exists in a similar state in the Estonian language.

The vialis case in Eskimo–Aleut languages has a similar interpretation, used to express movement using a surface or way. For example, in the Greenlandic language &#x27;by ship&#x27; or in Central Alaskan Yup&#x27;ik &#x27;by river&#x27; or &#x27;by sled&#x27;.

Basque grammars frequently list the &quot;nortzat / nortako&quot; case (suffix &quot;-tzat&quot; or &quot;-tako&quot;) as &quot;prolative&quot; (&quot;prolatiboa&quot;). However, the meaning of this case is unrelated to the one just described above for other languages and alternatively has been called &quot;essive / translative&quot;, as it means &quot;for [something else], as (being) [something else]&quot;; e.g., &quot;hiltzat eman&quot; &quot;to give up for dead&quot;, &quot;lelotzat hartu zuten&quot; &quot;they took him for a fool&quot;. The meaning &quot;by way of&quot; of the case labelled prolative in the above languages is expressed in Basque by means of the instrumental (suffix &quot;-[e]z&quot;).

This case is also called the prosecutive case in some languages. It is found under this name in Tundra Nenets, in Old Basque and, with spatial nouns, in Mongolian.

<text>Radio frequency (RF) is the oscillation rate of an alternating electric current or voltage or of a magnetic, electric or electromagnetic field or mechanical system in the frequency range from around to around . This is roughly between the upper limit of audio frequencies and the lower limit of infrared frequencies, and also encompasses the microwave range. These are the frequencies at which energy from an oscillating current can radiate off a conductor into space as radio waves, so they are used in radio technology, among other uses. Different sources specify different upper and lower bounds for the frequency range.

== Electric current ==
Electric currents that oscillate at radio frequencies (RF currents) have special properties not shared by direct current or lower audio frequency alternating current, such as the 50 or 60 Hz current used in electrical power distribution.
* Energy from RF currents in conductors can radiate into space as electromagnetic waves (radio waves). This is the basis of radio technology.
* RF current does not penetrate deeply into electrical conductors but tends to flow along their surfaces; this is known as the skin effect.
* RF currents applied to the body often do not cause the painful sensation and muscular contraction of electric shock that lower frequency currents produce. This is because the current changes direction too quickly to trigger depolarization of nerve membranes. However, this does not mean RF currents are harmless; they can cause internal injury as well as serious superficial burns called RF burns.
* RF current can ionize air, creating a conductive path through it. This property is exploited by &quot;high frequency&quot; units used in electric arc welding, which use currents at higher frequencies than power distribution uses.
* Another property is the ability to appear to flow through paths that contain insulating material, like the dielectric insulator of a capacitor. This is because capacitive reactance in a circuit decreases with increasing frequency.
* In contrast, RF current can be blocked by a coil of wire, or even a single turn or bend in a wire. This is because the inductive reactance of a circuit increases with increasing frequency.
* When conducted by an ordinary electric cable, RF current has a tendency to reflect from discontinuities in the cable, such as connectors, and travel back down the cable toward the source, causing a condition called standing waves. RF current may be carried efficiently over transmission lines such as coaxial cables.

==Frequency bands==
The radio spectrum of frequencies is divided into bands with conventional names designated by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU):

Frequencies of 1 GHz and above are conventionally called microwave, while frequencies of 30 GHz and above are designated millimeter wave.
More detailed band designations are given by the standard IEEE letter- band frequency designations and the EU/NATO frequency designations.

==Applications==
===Communications===
Radio frequencies are used in communication devices such as transmitters, receivers, computers, televisions, and mobile phones, to name a few. Radio frequencies are also applied in carrier current systems including telephony and control circuits. The MOS integrated circuit is the technology behind the current proliferation of radio frequency wireless telecommunications devices such as cellphones.

=== Medicine ===

Medical applications of radio frequency (RF) energy, in the form of electromagnetic waves (radio waves) or electrical currents, have existed for over 125 years, and now include diathermy, hyperthermy treatment of cancer, electrosurgery scalpels used to cut and cauterize in operations, and radiofrequency ablation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) uses radio frequency fields to generate images of the human body.

=== Non-surgical weight loss equipment ===
Radio Frequency or RF energy is also being used in devices that are being advertised for weight loss and fat removal. The possible effects RF might have on the body and whether RF can lead to fat reduction needs further study. Currently, there are devices such as trusculpt ID, Venus Bliss and many others utilizing this type of energy alongside heat to target fat pockets in certain areas of the body. That being said, there is limited studies on how effective these devices are.

==Measurement==
Test apparatus for radio frequencies can include standard instruments at the lower end of the range, but at higher frequencies, the test equipment becomes more specialized.
==Mechanical oscillations==
While RF usually refers to electrical oscillations, mechanical RF systems are not uncommon: see mechanical filter and RF MEMS.

<doc id="42853" wikidata="Q857325" url="?curid=42853" title="Partitive case">
<text>The partitive case (abbreviated , , or more ambiguously ) is a grammatical case which denotes &quot;partialness&quot;, &quot;without result&quot;, or &quot;without specific identity&quot;. It is also used in contexts where a subgroup is selected from a larger group, or with numbers.

== Finnic languages ==

In Finnic languages, such as Finnish and Estonian, this case is often used to express unknown identities and irresultative actions. For example, in Finnish, it is found in the following circumstances, with the characteristic ending of &quot;-a&quot; or &quot;-ta&quot;:

* After numbers, in singular: &quot;kolme taloa&quot; → &quot;three houses&quot; (cf. plural, where both are used, e.g. &quot;sadat kirjat&quot; &quot;the hundreds of books&quot;, &quot;sata kirjaa&quot; &quot;hundred books&quot; as an irresultative object.)
* For atelic actions (possibly incomplete) and ongoing processes: &quot;luen kirjaa&quot; → &quot;I&#x27;m reading a book&quot;
** Compare with telic actions in accusative case: &quot;luen kirjan&quot; → &quot;I will read the (entire) book&quot;
* With atelic verbs, particularly those indicating emotions: &quot;rakastan tätä taloa&quot; → &quot;I love this house&quot;
* For tentative inquiries: &quot;saanko lainata kirjaa?&quot; → &quot;can I borrow the book?&quot;
* For uncountables: &quot;lasissa on maitoa&quot; → &quot;there is (some) milk in the glass&quot;
* Compositions: &quot;pala juustoa&quot; → &quot;a piece of cheese&quot;
* In places where English would use &quot;some&quot; or &quot;any&quot;: &quot;onko teillä kirjoja?&quot; → &quot;do you have any books?&quot;
** Compare with nominative case: &quot;onko teillä kirjat?&quot; → &quot;do you have the (specific) books?&quot;
* For negative statements: &quot;talossa ei ole kirjaa&quot; → &quot;in the house, [there] is not [a] book&quot;
* Comparisons
** Without &quot;kuin&quot; (&quot;than&quot;): &quot;saamista parempaa on antaminen&quot; → &quot;what is better than receiving is giving&quot;
** The more common form &quot;antaminen on parempaa kuin saaminen&quot; &quot;giving is better than receiving&quot; places only the comparative adverb in the partitive.

Where not mentioned, the accusative case would be ungrammatical. For example, the partitive must always be used after singular numerals.

As an example of the irresultative meaning of the partitive, &quot;ammuin karhun&quot; (accusative) means &quot;I shot the bear (dead)&quot;, whereas &quot;ammuin karhua&quot; (partitive) means &quot;I shot (at) the bear&quot; without specifying if it was even hit. Notice that Finnish has no native future tense, so that the partitive provides an important reference to the present as opposed to the future. Thus &quot;luen kirjaa&quot; means &quot;I am reading a/the book&quot; whereas &quot;luen kirjan&quot; means &quot;I will read a/the book&quot;. Thus &quot;luen&quot; can mean &quot;I read&quot;, &quot;I am reading&quot; or &quot;I will read&quot; depending on the case form of the word that follows. The partitive form &quot;kirjaa&quot; indicates incompleted action and hence the meaning of the verb form is present tense. The accusative form &quot;kirjan&quot; indicates completed action when used with the past tense verb but indicates planned future action when used with a verb in the present tense. Hence &quot;luen kirjan&quot; means &quot;I will read the book&quot;.
The case with an unspecified identity is &quot;onko teillä kirjoja&quot;, which uses the partitive, because it refers to unspecified books, as contrasted to nominative &quot;onko teillä (ne) kirjat?&quot;, which means &quot;do you have (those) books?&quot;

The partitive case comes from the older ablative case. This meaning is preserved e.g. in &quot;kotoa&quot; (from home), &quot;takaa&quot; (from behind), where it means &quot;from&quot;.

A Western Finnish dialectal phenomenon seen in some dialects is the assimilation of the final &quot;-a&quot; into a preceding vowel, thus making the chroneme the partitive marker. For example, &quot;suurii&quot; → &quot;suuria&quot; &quot;some big --&quot;.

In Estonian, the system is generally similar. In Estonian grammatical tradition, the term &quot;accusative&quot; is not used, since like in Finnish, the total object form coincides with the genitive in the singular, and the nominative in the plural.

In many Estonian words, the difference between the full and partial object cases is only in vowel or consonant quantity (long vs overlong), which is not marked in writing, except for stop consonants. Thus, the distinction between a total and partial object may be apparent in speech but not in writing. For example, the sentence &quot;Linn ehitab kooli&quot; would mean &quot;The city will build a/the school&quot; when pronounced with a long vowel &quot;o&quot; in &quot;kooli&quot; &quot;school (genitive case)&quot;, and &quot;The city is building a/the school&quot; with an overlong &quot;o&quot; (partitive case).

For many verbs in Estonian, an additional adverb is almost always added when a completed action is meant - for example, &quot;ma söön leiba&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m eating bread&quot;, vs &quot;ma söön leiva ära&quot; &quot;I will eat the (whole) bread&quot;. Since Estonian, unlike Finnish, has words where the genitive and partitive singular are identical even in pronunciation, this can provide disambiguation in those cases - e.g &quot;ma söön kala&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m eating fish&quot;, vs &quot;ma söön kala ära&quot; &quot;I will eat (all of) the fish&quot;.

== Sámi ==

Of the Sámi languages, Inari and Skolt Sámi still have a partitive, although it is slowly disappearing and its function is being taken over by other cases.

===Skolt Sámi===

The partitive is used only in the singular and can always be replaced by the genitive. The partitive marker is &quot;-d&quot;.

# It appears after numbers larger than 6:
#: &quot;kääuʹc čâustõkkâd&quot;: eight lassos
#: This can be replaced with &quot;kääʹuc čâustõõǥǥ&quot;.
# It is also used with certain postpositions:
#: &quot;kuäʹtted vuâstta&quot;: against a &quot;kota&quot;
#: This can be replaced with &quot;kuäʹđ vuâstta&quot;.
# It can be used with the comparative to express that which is being compared:
#: &quot;Kåʹlled pueʹrab&quot; : better than gold
#: This would nowadays more than likely be replaced by &quot;pueʹrab ko kåʹll&quot;

== Dutch ==
In Dutch there are many adjectives ending in &quot;-s&quot;, which is called the partitive case. This case is derived from the genitive case in the older declension system and is used after words that signify quantity, such as the Dutch &quot;veel&quot;, &quot;weinig&quot; or &quot;niets&quot; (respectively meaning many/much/a lot, few/little or nothing):

: &quot;Dat is niets nieuws.&quot; 
: That&#x27;s nothing new.
: &quot;Men verwacht er veel goeds van.&quot; 
: People expect a lot from it.

The partitive case can also be used as a comparative:

: &quot;Heb je niets beters?&quot; 
: Don&#x27;t you have anything better?

If an adjective already ends in an alveolar fricative (like s in &quot;suit&quot;), the &quot;-s&quot; drops:

: &quot;Geef mij maar iets fris.&quot; 
: Give me something fresh.
: &quot;Dat is iets fantastisch!&quot; 
: That is something fantastic!

==Russian==

The Russian language usually uses the genitive case to express partialness. However, some Russian mass nouns have developed a distinct partitive case, also referred to as the &quot;second genitive case&quot;. The partitive arose from the merger of the declensions of &quot;*-ŏ&quot; and &quot;*-ŭ&quot; stem nouns in Old East Slavic, which left the former &quot;*-ŭ&quot; stem genitive suffix available for a specialized use.

In modern Russian, use of the partitive case is often facultative. In many situations, the partitive and the genitive can be used almost synonymously: , &#x27; (partitive) and &#x27; (genitive) both mean &quot;a cup of tea&quot;; , &#x27; (partitive) and &#x27; (genitive) both mean &quot;lots of smoke&quot;. The partitive variant is preferred with verbs: , &#x27;, &quot;to have a drink of tea&quot;. The genitive variant is used more frequently when the mass noun is modified by an adjective: &#x27;, &quot;a cup of hot tea&quot;.

<text>In grammar, the absolutive case (abbreviated ) is the case of nouns in ergative–absolutive languages that would generally be the subjects of intransitive verbs or the objects of transitive verbs in the translational equivalents of nominative–accusative languages such as English.

==In ergative–absolutive languages==
In languages with ergative–absolutive alignment, the absolutive is the case used to mark both the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb in addition to being used for the citation form of a noun. It contrasts with the marked ergative case, which marks the subject of a transitive verb.

For example, in Basque the noun takes the bare singular article both as the subject of the intransitive clause () and as the object of the transitive clause () in which the agent bears the ergative ending .

In a very few cases, a marked absolutive has been reported, including in Nias and Sochiapam Chinantec.

==Other uses==
Occasionally, the term &#x27;absolutive case&#x27; (or also: &#x27;absolute case&#x27;) is used for the unmarked case form in languages with other alignment types. This is especially common in the tradition of descriptive linguistics of African languages. In marked nominative languages, where the nominative has case inflection, the accusative is unmarked and also serves as citation form. In these languages, the unmarked accusative/citation form is thus often called &#x27;absolutive&#x27;. On the other hand, in certain nominative–accusative languages, it is the accusative which is explicitly marked for case, whereas the nominative is unmarked and serves as citation form. In such situations, the term &#x27;absolutive&#x27; is occasionally used to describe the unmarked nominative/citation form.

===In tripartite languages===
In tripartite languages, both the agent and object of a transitive clause have case forms, ergative and accusative, and the agent of an intransitive clause is the unmarked citation form. It is occasionally called the intransitive case, but &quot;absolutive&quot; is also used and is perhaps more accurate since it is not limited to core agents of intransitive verbs.

<doc id="42856" wikidata="Q188718" url="?curid=42856" title="The Bridge on the River Kwai">
<text>The Bridge on the River Kwai is a 1957 epic war film directed by David Lean and based on the novel &quot;The Bridge over the River Kwai&quot;, written by Pierre Boulle. Boulle&#x27;s novel and the film&#x27;s screenplay are almost entirely fictional, but use the construction of the Burma Railway, in 1942–1943, as their historical setting. The cast includes William Holden, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, and Sessue Hayakawa.

It was initially scripted by screenwriter Carl Foreman, who was later replaced by Michael Wilson. Both writers had to work in secret, as they were on the Hollywood blacklist and had fled to the UK in order to continue working. As a result, Boulle, who did not speak English, was credited and received the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay; many years later, Foreman and Wilson posthumously received the Academy Award.

&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; is now widely recognized as one of the greatest films ever made. It was the highest-grossing film of 1957 and received overwhelmingly positive reviews from critics. The film won seven Academy Awards (including Best Picture) at the 30th Academy Awards. In 1997, the film was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the United States Library of Congress. It has been included on the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of best American films ever made. In 1999, the British Film Institute voted &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; the 11th greatest British film of the 20th century.

==Plot==
In 1943, a contingent of British prisoners of war, led by Colonel Nicholson, arrive at a Japanese prison camp in Thailand. United States Navy Commander Shears tells Nicholson that the camp conditions are horrific. Nicholson forbids any escape attempts because headquarters ordered them to surrender. Also, the dense surrounding jungle renders escape virtually impossible.

Colonel Saito, the camp commandant, informs the prisoners they will construct a railway bridge over the River Kwai connecting Thailand and Burma. Nicholson objects, citing the Geneva Convention exempting officers from manual labour. Saito threatens to have the officers shot, but Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns him there are too many witnesses. The officers are left standing in the intense heat until evening when Saito then confines them to a punishment hut. Nicholson is beaten and locked in an iron box.

Shears and three other prisoners try to escape, though only Shears survives. Wounded, he wanders into a Thai village, where he is nursed back to health. He eventually recuperates in the British colony of Ceylon.

The bridge construction proceeds badly due to incompetent Japanese engineering and the prisoners&#x27; slow pace and sabotage. Saito informs Nicholson he is expected to commit ritual suicide if the construction is not completed by the deadline. Nicholson, shocked by the poor job his men have done, orders the design and building of a proper bridge. He considers it a lasting tribute to the British Army&#x27;s superiority, but Clipton argues it is collaboration with the enemy. Nicholson&#x27;s obsession drives him to volunteer his officers to work on the project.

Major Warden tries to recruit Shears for a commando mission to destroy the bridge. Shears refuses, revealing he impersonated an officer in hopes of better treatment as a prisoner. He is informed that they already knew of his deception, and that he has been temporarily transferred to the British military and therefore has no choice. Warden, Shears, and two others—Chapman and Joyce—parachute into Thailand. Chapman dies on landing, and Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol. Khun Yai, a village chief, and a group of Thai women guide the trio to the river. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives at the base of the bridge towers. The first train to cross the bridge is scheduled for the following day, and Warden wants to destroy both the train and the bridge. By daybreak, however, the river level has dropped, exposing the wire leading to the detonator.

Nicholson spots the wire, and he and Saito investigate as the train approaches. Nicholson pulls up the wire on the riverbank, leading them toward Joyce, who is manning the detonator. Joyce breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson calls for help and attempts to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. After Joyce is shot, Shears swims across the river to detonate the explosives, but is fatally wounded. Recognizing Shears, Nicholson exclaims, &quot;What have I done?&quot; Warden fires a mortar, wounding Nicholson. Dazed, Nicholson stumbles towards the detonator and falls on the plunger, blowing up the bridge; the train tumbles into the river. Warden, turning toward the group’s horrified guides, pleads, &quot;I had to do it! They might have been taken alive!&quot;. Witnessing the carnage, Clipton exclaims, &quot;Madness! ... Madness!&quot;

==Cast==


==Production==
===Screenplay===
The screenwriters, Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson, were on the Hollywood blacklist and, even though living in exile in England, could only work on the film in secret. The two did not collaborate on the script; Wilson took over after Lean was dissatisfied with Foreman&#x27;s work. The official credit was given to Pierre Boulle (who did not speak English), and the resulting Oscar for Best Screenplay (Adaptation) was awarded to him. Only in 1984 did the Academy rectify the situation by retroactively awarding the Oscar to Foreman and Wilson, posthumously in both cases. Subsequent releases of the film finally gave them proper screen credit. David Lean himself also claimed that producer Sam Spiegel cheated him out of his rightful part in the credits since he had had a major hand in the script.

The film was relatively faithful to the novel, with two major exceptions. Shears, who is a British commando officer like Warden in the novel, becomes an American sailor who escapes from the POW camp. Also, in the novel, the bridge is not destroyed: the train plummets into the river from a secondary charge placed by Warden, but Nicholson (never realising &quot;what have I done?&quot;) does not fall onto the plunger, and the bridge suffers only minor damage. Boulle nonetheless enjoyed the film version, though he disagreed with its climax.

===Casting===
Although Lean later denied it, Charles Laughton was his first choice for the role of Nicholson. Laughton was in his habitually overweight state, and was either denied insurance coverage or was simply not keen on filming in a tropical location. Guinness admitted that Lean &quot;didn&#x27;t particularly want me&quot; for the role, and thought about immediately returning to England when he arrived in Ceylon and Lean reminded him that he wasn&#x27;t the first choice.

William Holden&#x27;s deal was considered one of the best ever for an actor at the time, with him receiving $300,000 plus 10% of the film&#x27;s gross receipts.

===Filming===
Many directors were considered for the project, among them John Ford, William Wyler, Howard Hawks, Fred Zinnemann, and Orson Welles (who was also offered a starring role).

The film was an international co-production between companies in Britain and the United States.

Director David Lean clashed repeatedly with his cast members, particularly Guinness and James Donald, who thought the novel was anti-British. Lean had a lengthy row with Guinness over how to play the role of Nicholson; the actor wanted to play the part with a sense of humour and sympathy, while Lean thought Nicholson should be &quot;a bore.&quot; On another occasion, they argued over the scene where Nicholson reflects on his career in the army. Lean filmed the scene from behind Guinness and angrily exploded when Guinness asked him why he was doing this. After Guinness was done with the scene, Lean said, &quot;Now you can all fuck off and go home, you English actors. Thank God that I&#x27;m starting work tomorrow with an American actor (William Holden).&quot;

The film was made in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The bridge in the film was near Kitulgala. The Mount Lavinia Hotel was used as a location for the hospital.

Guinness later said that he subconsciously based his walk while emerging from &quot;the Oven&quot; on that of his eleven-year-old son Matthew, who was recovering from polio at the time, a disease that left him temporarily paralyzed from the waist down. Guinness later reflected on the scene, calling it the &quot;finest piece of work&quot; he had ever done.

Lean nearly drowned when he was swept away by the river current during a break from filming.

In a 1988 interview with Barry Norman, Lean confirmed that Columbia almost stopped filming after three weeks because there was no white woman in the film, forcing him to add what he called &quot;a very terrible scene&quot; between Holden and a nurse on the beach.

The filming of the bridge explosion was to be done on 10 March 1957, in the presence of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, then Prime Minister of Ceylon, and a team of government dignitaries. However, cameraman Freddy Ford was unable to get out of the way of the explosion in time, and Lean had to stop filming. The train crashed into a generator on the other side of the bridge and was wrecked. It was repaired in time to be blown up the next morning, with Bandaranaike and his entourage present.
===Music and soundtrack===
British composer Malcolm Arnold recalled that he had &quot;ten days to write around forty-five minutes worth of music&quot;—much less time than he was used to. He described the music for &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; as the &quot;worst job I ever had in my life&quot; because of the time constraint. Despite this, he won an Oscar and a Grammy.
 The film&#x27;s soundtrack was released on LP soon after the film (Columbia CL 1100). In 1990, Christopher Palmer arranged a concert suite for large orchestra for Arnold&#x27;s 70th birthday.

A memorable feature of the film is the tune that is whistled by the POWs—the first strain of the &quot;Colonel Bogey March&quot;—when they enter the camp. Gavin Young recounts meeting Donald Wise, a former prisoner of the Japanese who had worked on the Burma Railway. Young: &quot;Donald, did anyone whistle &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot; ... as they did in the film?&quot; Wise: &quot;I never heard it in Thailand. We hadn&#x27;t much breath left for whistling. But in Bangkok I was told that David Lean, the film&#x27;s director, became mad at the extras who played the prisoners—us—because they couldn&#x27;t march in time. Lean shouted at them, &#x27;For God&#x27;s sake, whistle a march to keep time to.&#x27; And a bloke called George Siegatz ... —an expert whistler—began to whistle &quot;Colonel Bogey&quot;, and a hit was born.&quot;

The march was written in 1914 by Kenneth J. Alford, a pseudonym of British Bandmaster Frederick J. Ricketts. For the film, Arnold wrote an accompanying counter-melody to the Colonel Bogey strain using the same chord progressions, then continued with his own &quot;The River Kwai March,&quot; played by the off-screen orchestra taking over from the whistlers, though Arnold&#x27;s march was not heard in completion on the soundtrack (apparently for copyright reasons). Mitch Miller had a hit with a recording of both marches.

In many tense, dramatic scenes, only the sounds of nature are used. An example of this is when commandos Warden and Joyce hunt a fleeing Japanese soldier through the jungle, desperate to prevent him from alerting other troops.

==Historical accuracy==
The plot and characters of Boulle&#x27;s novel and the screenplay were almost entirely fictional. There are many historical inaccuracies in the film, as noted by eyewitnesses to the building of the real Burma Railway by historians.

The conditions to which POW and civilian labourers were subjected were far worse than the film depicted. According to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission:

Lieutenant Colonel Philip Toosey of the British Army was the real senior Allied officer at the bridge in question. Toosey was very different from Nicholson and was certainly not a collaborator who felt obliged to work with the Japanese. In fact, Toosey strove to delay construction. While Nicholson disapproves of acts of sabotage and other deliberate attempts to delay progress, Toosey encouraged this: termites were collected in large numbers to eat the wooden structures, and the concrete was badly mixed. Some consider the film to be an insulting parody of the then Lt. Col. Toosey.

On a BBC &quot;Timewatch&quot; programme, a former prisoner at the camp states that it is unlikely that a man like the fictional Nicholson could have risen to the rank of lieutenant colonel, and, if he had, due to his collaboration he would have been &quot;quietly eliminated&quot; by the other prisoners.

Julie Summers, in her book &quot;The Colonel of Tamarkan&quot;, writes that Boulle, who had been a prisoner of war in Thailand, created the fictional Nicholson character as an amalgam of his memories of collaborating French officers. He strongly denied the claim that the book was anti-British, although many involved in the film itself (including Alec Guinness) felt otherwise.

Ernest Gordon, a survivor of the railway construction and POW camps described in the novel/film, stated in his 1962 book, &quot;Through the Valley of the Kwai&quot;: 
A 1969 BBC television documentary, &quot;Return to the River Kwai&quot;, made by former POW John Coast, sought to highlight the real history behind the film (partly through getting ex-POWs to question its factual basis, for example Dr Hugh de Wardener and Lt-Col Alfred Knights), which angered many former POWs. The documentary itself was described by one newspaper reviewer when it was shown on Boxing Day 1974 (&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; had been shown on BBC1 on Christmas Day 1974) as &quot;Following the movie, this is a rerun of the antidote.&quot;

Some of the characters in the film use the names of real people who were involved in the Burma Railway. Their roles and characters, however, are fictionalised. For example, a Sergeant-Major Risaburo Saito was in real life second in command at the camp. In the film, a Colonel Saito is camp commandant. In reality, Risaburo Saito was respected by his prisoners for being comparatively merciful and fair towards them. Toosey later defended him in his war crimes trial after the war, and the two became friends.

Some Japanese viewers resented the movie&#x27;s depiction of their engineers&#x27; capabilities as inferior and less advanced than they were in reality. Japanese engineers had been surveying and planning the route of the railway since 1937, and they had demonstrated considerable skill during their construction efforts across South-East Asia. Some Japanese viewers also disliked the film for portraying the Allied prisoners of war as more capable of constructing the bridge than the Japanese engineers themselves were, accusing the filmmakers of being unfairly biased and unfamiliar with the realities of the bridge construction, a sentiment echoed by surviving prisoners of war who saw the film in cinemas.

The major railway bridge described in the novel and film did not actually cross the river known at the time as the Kwai. However, in 1943 a railway bridge was built by Allied POWs over the Mae Klong river—renamed Khwae Yai in the 1960s as a result of the film—at Tha Ma Kham, five kilometres from Kanchanaburi, Thailand. Boulle had never been to the bridge. He knew that the railway ran parallel to the Kwae for many miles, and he therefore assumed that it was the Kwae which it crossed just north of Kanchanaburi. This was an incorrect assumption. The destruction of the bridge as depicted in the film is also entirely fictional. In fact, two bridges were built: a temporary wooden bridge and a permanent steel/concrete bridge a few months later. Both bridges were used for two years, until they were destroyed by Allied bombing. The steel bridge was repaired and is still in use today.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; was a massive commercial success. It was the highest-grossing film of 1957 in the United States and Canada and was also the most popular film at the British box office that year. According to &quot;Variety&quot;, the film earned estimated domestic box office revenues of $18,000,000 although this was revised downwards the following year to $15,000,000, which was still the biggest for 1958 and Columbia&#x27;s highest-grossing film at the time. By October 1960, the film had earned worldwide box office revenues of $30 million.

The film was re-released in 1964 and earned a further estimated $2.6 million at the box office in the United States and Canada but the following year its revised total US and Canadian revenues were reported by &quot;Variety&quot; as $17,195,000.

===Critical response ===
On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film received an approval rating of 96% based on 105 reviews, with an average rating of 9.4/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;This complex war epic asks hard questions, resists easy answers, and boasts career-defining work from star Alec Guinness and director David Lean.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 88 out of 100 based on 15 critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;.

Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; praised the film as &quot;a towering entertainment of rich variety and revelation of the ways of men&quot;. Mike Kaplan, reviewing for &quot;Variety&quot;, described it as &quot;a gripping drama, expertly put together and handled with skill in all departments.&quot; Kaplan further praised the actors, especially Alec Guinness, later writing &quot;the film is unquestionably&quot; his. William Holden was also credited for his acting for giving a solid characterization that was &quot;easy, credible and always likeable in a role that is the pivot point of the story&quot;. Edwin Schallert of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; claimed the film&#x27;s strongest points were for being &quot;excellently produced in virtually all respects and that it also offers an especially outstanding and different performance by Alec Guinness. Highly competent work is also done by William Holden, Jack Hawkins and Sessue Hayakawa&quot;. &quot;Time&quot; magazine praised Lean&#x27;s directing, noting he demonstrates &quot;a dazzlingly musical sense and control of the many and involving rhythms of a vast composition. He shows a rare sense of humor and a feeling for the poetry of situation; and he shows the even rarer ability to express these things, not in lines but in lives.&quot; &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; described the film as an &quot;excellent World War II adventure melodrama&quot; in which the &quot;production values are first-rate and so is the photography.&quot;

Among retrospective reviews, Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars, noting that it is one of the few war movies that &quot;focuses not on larger rights and wrongs but on individuals&quot;, but commented that the viewer is not certain what is intended by the final dialogue due to the film&#x27;s shifting points of view. &quot;Slant&quot; magazine gave the film four out of five stars. &quot;Slant&quot; stated that &quot;the 1957 epic subtly develops its themes about the irrationality of honor and the hypocrisy of Britain&#x27;s class system without ever compromising its thrilling war narrative&quot;, and in comparing to other films of the time said that &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; &quot;carefully builds its psychological tension until it erupts in a blinding flash of sulfur and flame.&quot;

Balu Mahendra, the Tamil film director, observed the shooting of this film at Kitulgala, Sri Lanka during his school trip and was inspired to become a film director. Warren Buffett said it was his favorite movie. In an interview, he said that &quot;[t]here were a lot of lessons in that... The ending of that was sort of the story of life. He created the railroad. Did he really want the enemy to come in across it?&quot;

The film has been selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

The British Film Institute placed &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; as the 11th greatest British film.

==First TV broadcast==
ABC, sponsored by Ford, paid a record $1.8 million for the television rights for two screenings in the United States. The 167-minute film was first telecast, uncut, in colour, on the evening of 25 September 1966, as a three hours-plus ABC Movie Special. The telecast of the film lasted more than three hours because of the commercial breaks. It was still highly unusual at that time for a television network to show such a long film in one evening; most films of that length were still generally split into two parts and shown over two evenings. But the unusual move paid off for ABC—the telecast drew huge ratings with a record audience of 72 million and a Nielsen rating of 38.3 and an audience share of 61%.

==Restorations and home video releases==
In 1972, the movie was among the first selection of films released on the early Cartrivision video format, alongside classics such as &quot;The Jazz Singer&quot; and &quot;Sands of Iwo Jima&quot;.

The film was restored in 1985 by Columbia Pictures. The separate dialogue, music and effects were located and remixed with newly recorded &quot;atmospheric&quot; sound effects. The image was restored by OCS, Freeze Frame, and Pixel Magic with George Hively editing.

On 2 November 2010 Columbia Pictures released a newly restored &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; for the first time on Blu-ray. According to Columbia Pictures, they followed an all-new 4K digital restoration from the original negative with newly restored 5.1 audio. The original negative for the feature was scanned at 4K (four times the resolution in High Definition), and the colour correction and digital restoration were also completed at 4K. The negative itself manifested many of the kinds of issues one would expect from a film of this vintage: torn frames, embedded emulsion dirt, scratches through every reel, colour fading. Unique to this film, in some ways, were other issues related to poorly made optical dissolves, the original camera lens and a malfunctioning camera. These problems resulted in a number of anomalies that were very difficult to correct, like a ghosting effect in many scenes that resembles colour mis-registration, and a tick-like effect with the image jumping or jerking side-to-side. These issues, running throughout the film, were addressed to a lesser extent on various previous DVD releases of the film and might not have been so obvious in standard definition.

==In popular culture==
* In 1962, Spike Milligan and Peter Sellers, with Peter Cook and Jonathan Miller, released the LP record &quot;Bridge on the River Wye&quot; (Parlophone LP PMC 1190, PCS 3036 (November 1962)). This spoof of the film was based on the script for the 1957 &quot;Goon Show&quot; episode &quot;An African Incident&quot;. Shortly before its release, for legal reasons, producer George Martin edited out the &#x27;K&#x27; every time the word &#x27;Kwai&#x27; was spoken.
* The comedy team of Wayne and Shuster performed a sketch titled &quot;Kwai Me a River&quot; on their 27 March 1967 TV show, in which an officer in the British Dental Corps (Wayne) is captured by the Japanese and, despite being comically unintimidated by any abuse the commander of the POW camp (Shuster) inflicts on him, is forced to build a (dental) &quot;bridge on the river Kwai&quot; for the commander and plans to include an explosive in the appliance to detonate in his mouth. The commander survives the explosion, attributed to a toothpaste commercial punchline in 1960s commercials.
* In season 1, episode 1 of &quot;The Wire&quot;, Detective Jimmy McNulty laments, &quot;I feel like that motherfucker at the end of Bridge over the River Kwai, like what the fuck did I do?&quot;

<text>The Sudetenland ( , ; Czech and ) is a German name for the northern, southern, and western areas of former Czechoslovakia which were inhabited primarily by Sudeten Germans. These German speakers had predominated in the border districts of Bohemia, Moravia, and Czech Silesia since the Middle Ages. Since the 9th century these districts had been an integral part of the Czech state (first within the Duchy of Bohemia and later the Kingdom of Bohemia) both geographically and politically.

The word &quot;Sudetenland&quot; did not come into being until the early part of the 20th century and did not come to prominence until almost two decades into the century, after World War I, when Austria-Hungary was dismembered and the Sudeten Germans found themselves living in the new country of Czechoslovakia. The &quot;Sudeten crisis&quot; of 1938 was provoked by the Pan-Germanist demands of Nazi Germany that the Sudetenland be annexed to Germany, which happened after the later Munich Agreement. Part of the borderland was invaded and annexed by Poland. Afterwards, the formerly unrecognized Sudetenland became an administrative division of Germany. When Czechoslovakia was reconstituted after World War II, the Sudeten Germans were expelled and the region today is inhabited almost exclusively by Czech speakers.

The word &quot;Sudetenland&quot; is a German compound of &quot;Land&quot;, meaning &quot;country&quot;, and &quot;Sudeten&quot;, the name of the Sudeten Mountains, which run along the northern Czech border and Lower Silesia (now in Poland). The Sudetenland encompassed areas well beyond those mountains, however.

Parts of the now-Czech regions of Karlovy Vary, Liberec, Olomouc, Moravia-Silesia, South Moravia and Ústí nad Labem are within the former Sudetenland.

==History==
The areas later known as the Sudetenland never formed a single historical region, which makes it difficult to distinguish the history of the Sudetenland separately from that of Bohemia until the advent of nationalism in the 19th century.

===Early origins===

The Celtic Boii settled there and the region was first mentioned on the map of Ptolemaios in the 2nd century AD. The Germanic tribe of the Marcomanni dominated the entire core of the region in later centuries. Those tribes already built cities like Brno, but moved west during the Migration Period. In the 7th century AD Slavic people moved in and were united under Samo&#x27;s realm. Later in the High Middle Ages Germans settled into the less populated border region.
In the Middle Ages the regions situated on the mountainous border of the Duchy and the Kingdom of Bohemia (Crown of Saint Václav) had since the Migration Period been settled mainly by western Slavic Czechs. Along the Bohemian Forest in the west, the Czech lands bordered on the German Slavic tribes (German Sorbs) stem duchies of Bavaria and Franconia; marches of the medieval German kingdom had also been established in the adjacent Austrian lands south of the Bohemian-Moravian Highlands and the northern Meissen region beyond the Ore Mountains. In the course of the &quot;Ostsiedlung&quot; (settlement of the east) German settlement from the 13th century onwards continued to move into the Upper Lusatia region and the duchies of Silesia north of the Sudetes mountain range.

From as early as the second half of the 13th century onwards these Bohemian border regions were settled by ethnic Germans, who were invited by the Přemyslid Bohemian kings—especially by Ottokar II (1253–1278) and Wenceslaus II (1278–1305). After the extinction of the Přemyslid dynasty in 1306, the Bohemian nobility backed John of Luxembourg as king against his rival Duke Henry of Carinthia. In 1322 King John of Bohemia acquired (for the third time) the formerly Imperial Egerland region in the west and vassalized most of the Piast Silesian duchies, as acknowledged by King Casimir III of Poland by the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin. His son, Bohemian King Charles IV, was elected King of the Romans in 1346 and crowned Holy Roman Emperor in 1355. He added the Lusatias to the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, which then comprised large territories with a significant German population.

In the hilly border regions German settlers established major manufactures of forest glass. The situation of the German population was aggravated by the Hussite Wars (1419–1434), though there were also some Germans among the Hussite insurgents.

By then Germans largely settled the hilly Bohemian border regions as well as the cities of the lowlands; mainly people of Bavarian descent in the South Bohemian and South Moravian Region, in Brno, Jihlava, České Budějovice and the West Bohemian Plzeň Region; Franconian people in Žatec; Upper Saxons in adjacent North Bohemia, where the border with the Saxon Electorate was fixed by the 1459 Peace of Eger; Germanic Silesians in the adjacent Sudetes region with the County of Kladsko, in the Moravian–Silesian Region, in Svitavy and Olomouc. The city of Prague had a German-speaking majority from the last third of the 17th century until 1860, but after 1910 the proportion of German speakers had decreased to 6.7% of the population.

From the Luxembourgs, rule over Bohemia passed through George of Podiebrad to the Jagiellon dynasty and finally to the House of Habsburg in 1526. Both Czech and German Bohemians suffered heavily in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Bohemia lost 70% of its population. From the defeat of the Bohemian Revolt that collapsed at the 1620 Battle of White Mountain, the Habsburgs gradually integrated the Kingdom of Bohemia into their monarchy. During the subsequent Counter-Reformation, less populated areas were resettled with Catholic Germans from the Austrian lands. From 1627, the Habsburgs enforced the so-called &quot;Verneuerte Landesordnung&quot; (&quot;Renewed Land&#x27;s Constitution&quot;), and one of its consequences was that German, according to mother tongue, gradually became the primary and official language, while Czech declined to a secondary role in the Empire. In 1749, the Austrian Empire enforced German as the official language again. Emperor Joseph II in 1780 renounced the coronation ceremony as Bohemian king and unsuccessfully tried to push German through as sole official language in all Habsburg lands (including Hungary). Nevertheless, German cultural influence grew stronger during the Age of Enlightenment and Weimar Classicism.

Contrastingly, in the course of the Romanticism movement national tensions arose, both in the form of the Austroslavism ideology developed by Czech politicians like František Palacký and Pan-Germanist activist raising the German question. Conflicts between Czech and German nationalists emerged in the 19th century, for instance in the Revolutions of 1848: while the German-speaking population of Bohemia and Moravia wanted to participate in the building of a German nation state, the Czech-speaking population insisted on keeping Bohemia out of such plans. The Bohemian Kingdom remained a part of the Austrian Empire and Austria-Hungary until its dismemberment after the World War I.

===Emergence of the term===
In the wake of growing nationalism, the name &quot;&quot;Sudetendeutsche&quot; (Sudeten Germans) emerged by the early 20th century. It originally constituted part of a larger classification of three groupings of Germans within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which also included &quot;&quot;Alpine Deutschen&quot; (&quot;Alpine Germans&quot;) in what later became the Republic of Austria and &quot;&quot;Balkandeutsche&quot; (&quot;Balkan Germans&quot;) in Hungary and the regions east of it. Of these three terms, only the term &quot;&quot;Sudetendeutsche&quot; survived, because of the ethnic and cultural conflicts within Bohemia.

===World War I and aftermath===
During World War I, what later became known as the Sudetenland experienced a rate of war deaths that was higher than most other German-speaking areas of Austria-Hungary and exceeded only by German South Moravia and Carinthia. Thirty-four of each 1,000 inhabitants were killed.

Austria-Hungary broke apart at the end of World War I. In late October 1918, an independent Czechoslovak state, consisting of the lands of the Bohemian kingdom and areas belonging to the Kingdom of Hungary, was proclaimed. The German deputies of Bohemia, Moravia, and Silesia in the Imperial Council (&quot;Reichsrat&quot;) referred to the Fourteen Points of US President Woodrow Wilson and the right proposed therein to self-determination and attempted to negotiate the union of the German-speaking territories with the new Republic of German Austria, which itself aimed at joining Weimar Germany.

The German-speaking parts of the former Lands of the Bohemian Crown were to be part of a newly created Czechoslovakia, a multi-ethnic state of several nations: Czechs, Germans, Slovaks, Hungarians, Poles and Ruthenians. On 20 September 1918, the Prague government asked for the opinion of the United States on the Sudetenland. Wilson sent Ambassador Archibald Coolidge into Czechoslovakia. Coolidge insisted on respecting the Germans&#x27; right to self-determination and uniting all German-speaking areas with either Germany or Austria, with the exception of northern Bohemia. However, the American delegation at the Paris talks decided not to follow Coolidge&#x27;s proposal. Allen Dulles was the American&#x27;s chief diplomat in the Czechoslovak Commission and emphasized preserving the unity of the Czech lands.

Four regional governmental units were established:

* Province of German Bohemia (&quot;Provinz Deutschböhmen&quot;), the regions of northern and western Bohemia; proclaimed a constitutive state (&quot;Land&quot;) of the German-Austrian Republic with Reichenberg (Liberec) as capital, administered by a &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot; (state captain), consecutively: Rafael Pacher (1857–1936), 29 October6 November 1918, and Rudolf Ritter von Lodgman von Auen (1877–1962), 6 November16 December 1918 (the last principal city was conquered by the Czech army but he continued in exile, first at Zittau in Saxony and then in Vienna, until 24 September 1919).
* Province of the Sudetenland (&quot;Provinz Sudetenland&quot;), the regions of northern Moravia and Austrian Silesia; proclaimed a constituent state of the German-Austrian Republic with Troppau (Opava) as capital, governed by a &quot;Landeshauptmann&quot;: Robert Freissler (1877–1950), 30 October – 18 December 1918. This province&#x27;s boundaries do not correspond to what would later be called the Sudetenland, which contained all the German-speaking parts of the Czech lands.
* Bohemian Forest Region (&quot;Böhmerwaldgau&quot;), the region of Bohemian Forest/South Bohemia; proclaimed a district (&quot;Kreis&quot;) of the existing Austrian Land of Upper Austria; administered by &quot;Kreishauptmann&quot; (district captain): Friedrich Wichtl (1872–1922) from 30 October 1918.
* German South Moravia (&quot;Deutschsüdmähren&quot;), proclaimed a District (&quot;Kreis&quot;) of the existing Austrian land Lower Austria, administered by a &quot;Kreishauptmann&quot;: Oskar Teufel (1880–1946) from 30 October 1918.

The U.S. commission to the Paris Peace Conference issued a declaration, which gave unanimous support for &quot;unity of Czech lands&quot;. In particular the declaration stated:

Several German minorities according to their mother tongue in Moravia, including German-speaking populations in Brno, Jihlava and Olomouc, also attempted to proclaim their union with German Austria.

In sum, the Czechs rejected the aspirations of the German Bohemians and demanded the inclusion of the lands inhabited by ethnic Germans in their state, on the grounds that they had always been part of the lands of the Bohemian Crown. These lands were in some instances more than 90% (as of 1921) ethnically German, which made the whole of Czechoslovakia 23.4% German.

The Treaty of Saint-Germain in 1919 affirmed the inclusion of the German-speaking territories within Czechoslovakia. Over the next two decades, some Germans in the Sudetenland continued to strive for a separation of the regions from Czechoslovakia.

According to Elizabeth Wiskemann, despite the initial resistance to the Czechoslovak rule, the Sudeten German population was not entirely opposed to annexation by Czechoslovakia. Sudeten economy and industry relied on the rest of Bohemia, and local industrialists were afraid of &quot;Reich German competition and therefore of the talk of handing them over&quot;. Many Sudeten Germans also opposed joining Austria, arguing that being incorporated into Austria would turn Sudeten lands into &quot;economically helpless Austrian enclaves&quot;. Because of this, Sudetenland becoming part of Czechoslovakia was the preferable choice of &quot;a good deal of cautious middle-class&quot; amongst Sudeten Germans. Silesian-Sudeten Germans were particularly pro-Czechoslovak, as they strongly preferred Czechoslovak rule to the prospect of becoming a part of Poland.

===Within the Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)===
According to the February 1921 census, 3,123,000 native German speakers lived in Czechoslovakia, 23.4% of the total population. The controversies between the Czechs and the German-speaking minority lingered on throughout the 1920s and intensified in the 1930s.

During the Great Depression, the mostly-mountainous regions populated by the German minority, together with other peripheral regions of Czechoslovakia, were hurt by the economic depression more than the interior of the country was. Unlike the less developed regions (Carpathian Ruthenia, Moravian Wallachia), the Sudetenland had a high concentration of vulnerable export-dependent industries (such as glass works, textile industry, paper-making and toy-making industry). Sixty percent of the bijouterie and glassmaking industry were located in the Sudetenland, and 69% of employees in the sector were German-speaking according to mother tongue, and 95% of bijouterie and 78% of other glassware was produced for export. The glass-making sector was affected by decreased spending power and by protective measures in other countries, and many German workers lost their work.

The high unemployment, as well as the imposition of Czech in schools and all public spaces, made people more open to populist and extremist movements such as fascism, communism and German irredentism. In those years, parties of German nationalists and later the Sudeten German Party (SdP), with its radical demands gained immense popularity, among Germans in Czechoslovakia.

===Sudeten Crisis===

The increasing aggressiveness of Hitler prompted the Czechoslovak military to start to build extensive border fortifications in 1936 to defend the troubled border region. Immediately after the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of Austria into the German Reich in March 1938, Hitler made himself the advocate of ethnic Germans living in Czechoslovakia, which triggered the Sudeten Crisis. The following month, Sudeten Nazis, led by Konrad Henlein, agitated for autonomy. On 24 April 1938, the SdP proclaimed the Karlsbader Programm, which demanded in eight points the complete equality between the Sudeten Germans and the Czech people. The government accepted those claims on 30 June 1938.

In August, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain sent Lord Runciman on a mission to Czechoslovakia to see if he could obtain a settlement between the Czechoslovak government and the Germans in the Sudetenland. Runciman&#x27;s first day included meetings with President Beneš and Prime Minister Milan Hodža as well as a direct meeting with the Sudeten Germans from Henlein&#x27;s SdP. On the next day, he met with Dr and Mme Beneš and later met non-Nazi Germans in his hotel.

A full account of his report, including summaries of the conclusions of his meetings with the various parties, which he made in person to the Cabinet on his return to the United Kingdom, is found in the Document CC 39(38). Lord Runciman expressed sadness that he could not bring about agreement with the various parties, but he agreed with Lord Halifax that the time that had been gained was important. He reported on the situation of the Sudeten Germans and gave details of four plans that had been proposed to deal with the crisis, each of which had points that, he reported, made it unacceptable to the other parties to the negotiations.

The four plans included, first, the transfer of the Sudetenland to the Reich, second, holding a plebiscite on the transfer of the Sudetenland to the Reich, third, organising a Four-Power Conference on the matter and, fourth, creating a federal Czechoslovakia. At the meeting, he said that he was very reluctant to offer his own solution and had not seen that as his task. The most that Halifax said was that the great centres of opposition were in Eger and Asch, in the northwestern corner of Bohemia, where about 800,000 Germans and very few others lived.

Halifax said that the transfer of these areas to Germany would almost certainly be a good thing adding that the Czechoslovak army would certainly oppose that very strongly and that Beneš had said that it would fight, rather than accept it.

British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain met Adolf Hitler in Berchtesgaden on 15 September and agreed to the cession of the Sudetenland. Three days later, French Prime Minister Édouard Daladier did the same. No Czechoslovak representative was invited to the discussions. Germany was now able to walk into the Sudetenland without firing a shot.

Chamberlain met Hitler in Godesberg on 22 September 1938 to confirm the agreements. Hitler, aiming to use the crisis as a pretext for war, now demanded not only the annexation of the Sudetenland but also the immediate military occupation of Bohemia, Moravia and Slovakia, thus giving the Czechoslovak army no time to adapt its defence measures to the new borders.

Hitler, in a speech at the Sportpalast in Berlin, claimed that the Sudetenland was &quot;the last territorial demand I have to make in Europe&quot; and gave Czechoslovakia a deadline of 28 September 1938 at 2:00 p.m. to cede the Sudetenland to Germany or face war.

To achieve a solution, the Italian dictator, Benito Mussolini, suggested a conference of the major powers in Munich, and on 29 September, Hitler, Daladier and Chamberlain met and agreed to Mussolini&#x27;s proposal (actually prepared by Hermann Göring) and signed the Munich Agreement. They accepted the immediate occupation of the Sudetenland. The Czechoslovak government, though not party to the talks, submitted to compulsion and promised to abide by the agreement on 30 September.

The Sudetenland was assigned to Germany between 1 and 10 October 1938. The Czech part of Czechoslovakia was subsequently invaded by Germany in March 1939, with a portion being annexed and the remainder turned into the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. The Slovak part declared its independence from Czechoslovakia and became the Slovak Republic (Slovak State), a satellite state allied to Germany. (The Ruthenian part, Subcarpathian Rus, made also an attempt to declare its sovereignty as Carpatho-Ukraine but only with ephemeral success since the area was soon annexed by Hungary.)

Although &quot;Henlein and the SdP had become accessories in Hitler&#x27;s escalating campaign to annex the Sudetenland to the German Reich&quot; by the summer of 1938, the supporters of the SdP supported autonomy within Czechoslovakia rather than annexation into Germany. Contemporary reports of The Times found that there was a &quot;large number of Sudetenlanders who actively opposed annexation&quot;, and that the pro-German policy was challenged by the moderates within the SdP as well; according to Wickham Steed, over 50% of Henlein&#x27;s supporters favoured greater autonomy within Czechoslovakia rather than joining Germany. Sudeten German historian argues that the mainstream wing of Henlein&#x27;s party was &quot;not striving for annexation to Germany, but for genuine autonomy&quot;, and the majority of negotiators who conducted talks with Hodža and Beneš belonged to the pro-autonomy wing and were unaware of Henlein&#x27;s agreements with Hitler.

Part of the borderland had an ethnic Polish majority and was invaded and annexed by Poland in 1938.

===Sudetenland as part of Germany===
The Sudetenland was initially put under military administration, with General Wilhelm Keitel as military governor. On 14 April 1939, the annexed territories were divided, with the southern parts being incorporated into the neighbouring Reichsgaue of &quot;Niederdonau&quot;, &quot;Oberdonau&quot; and &quot;Bayerische Ostmark&quot;.
The northern and the western parts were reorganised as the &quot;Reichsgau Sudetenland&quot;, with the city of Reichenberg (present-day Liberec) established as its capital. Konrad Henlein (now openly an NSDAP member) administered the district first as &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; (until 1 May 1939) and then as &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (1 May 19394 May 1945). The Sudetenland consisted of three administrative districts (&quot;Regierungsbezirke&quot;): Eger (with Karlsbad as capital), Aussig (Aussig) and Troppau (Troppau).
Before the occupation, Jews in the area had become targeted during the Holocaust in the Sudetenland. Only a few weeks later, the Kristallnacht occurred. As elsewhere in Germany, many synagogues were set on fire and numerous leading Jews were sent to concentration camps. Jews and Czechs were not the only afflicted peoples since German socialists, communists and pacifists were widely persecuted as well. Some of the German socialists fled the Sudetenland via Prague and London to other countries. The &quot;Gleichschaltung&quot; would permanently alter the community in the Sudetenland.

However, on 4 December 1938, there were elections in Reichsgau Sudetenland in which 97.32% of the adult population voted for the NSDAP. About a half million Sudeten Germans joined the Nazi Party, 17.34% of the total German population in the Sudetenland (the average NSDAP membership participation in Germany was merely 7.85% in 1944). That means the Sudetenland was one of the most pro-Nazi regions of Nazi Germany. Because of their knowledge of the Czech language, many Sudeten Germans were employed in the administration of the ethnic Czech Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia as well as in Nazi organizations (Gestapo etc.). The most notable one was Karl Hermann Frank, the SS and police general and Secretary of State in the Protectorate.

Nazi Germany occupied Sudetenland from 1938 to 1945.


===Expulsions and resettlement after World War II===

Shortly after the liberation of Czechoslovakia in May 1945, the use of the term &quot;Sudety&quot; (Sudetenland) in official communications was banned and replaced by the term &quot;pohraniční území&quot; (border territory). The Berlin Declaration of 5 June 1945 disabled German annexation of Sudetenland legally.

In the summer of 1945, the Potsdam Conference decided that Sudeten Germans would have to leave Czechoslovakia (see flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)). As a consequence of the immense hostility against all Germans that had grown within Czechoslovakia because many of them had helped the Nazis, the overwhelming majority of Germans were expelled though the relevant Czechoslovak legislation had provided for Germans to remain if they could prove their anti-Nazi affiliation.

The number of expelled Germans in the early phase (spring-summer 1945) is estimated to be around 500,000 people. After the Beneš decrees, nearly all Germans were expelled starting in 1946 and in 1950 only 159,938 (from 3,149,820 in 1930) still lived in the Czech Republic. The remaining Germans, who were proven antifascists and skilled laborers, were allowed to stay in Czechoslovakia but were later forcefully dispersed within the country. Some German refugees from Czechoslovakia are represented by the Sudetendeutsche Landsmannschaft.

Many of the Germans who stayed in Czechoslovakia later emigrated to West Germany (more than 100,000). As the German population was transferred out of the country, the former Sudetenland was resettled mostly by Czechs but also by other nationalities of Czechoslovakia: Slovaks, Greeks (arriving in the wake of the Greek Civil War 1946–49), Carpathian Ruthenians, Romani people and Jews who had survived the Holocaust, and Hungarians (though the Hungarians were forced into that and later returned home—see Hungarians in Slovakia: Population exchanges).

Some areas, such as part of Czech Silesian-Moravian borderland, southwestern Bohemia (Šumava National Park), western and northern parts of Bohemia, remained depopulated for several strategic reasons (extensive mining and military interests) or are now protected national parks and landscapes. Moreover, before the establishment of the Iron Curtain in 1952 to 1955, the so-called &quot;forbidden zone&quot; was established by means of engineer equipment up to 2 km (1.2 mi) from the border in which no civilians could reside. A wider region, or &quot;border zone&quot;, existed up to 12 km (7 miles) from the border in which no &quot;disloyal&quot; or &quot;suspect&quot; civilians could reside or work. Thus, the entire Aš-Bulge fell within the border zone, a status that remained until the Velvet Revolution in 1989.

There remained areas with noticeable German minorities in the westernmost borderland around Cheb, where skilled ethnic German miners and workers continued in mining and industry, until 1955, as sanctioned under the Yalta Conference protocols; in the Egerland, German minority organizations continue to exist.

In the 2021 census, 24,632 people in the Czech Republic claimed German ethnicity, out of which 15,504 in combination with another ethnicity.

<text>A Streetcar Named Desire is a play written by Tennessee Williams and first performed on Broadway on December 3, 1947. The play dramatizes the experiences of Blanche DuBois, a former Southern belle who, after encountering a series of personal losses, leaves her once-prosperous situation to move into a shabby apartment in New Orleans rented by her younger sister Stella and brother-in-law Stanley.

&quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; is one of the most critically acclaimed plays of the 20th century and Williams&#x27;s most popular work. It still ranks among his most performed plays, and has inspired many adaptations in other forms, notably a critically acclaimed film that was released in 1951.

== Name ==
Blanche is mentioned in the play as arriving at Stella&#x27;s apartment by riding in a streetcar on the Desire streetcar line. Tennessee Williams was living in an apartment on Toulouse Street in New Orleans’ French Quarter when he wrote &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. The old Desire streetcar line ran only a half-block away.

In the 1951 film Blanche is shown riding the car. In the interim between writing the play and shooting the film, though, the line was converted into a bus service (1948), and the production team had to seek permission from the authorities to hire out a streetcar with the &quot;Desire&quot; name on it.

== Plot ==

After the loss of her family home to creditors, Blanche DuBois travels from Laurel, Mississippi, to the New Orleans French Quarter to live with her younger married sister, Stella, and Stella&#x27;s husband, Stanley Kowalski. She is in her thirties and, with no money, has nowhere else to go.

Blanche tells Stella that she has taken a leave of absence from her English-teaching position because of her nerves (which is later revealed to be a lie). Blanche laments the shabbiness of her sister&#x27;s two-room flat. She finds Stanley loud and rough, eventually referring to him as &quot;common.&quot; Stanley, in return, is suspicious of Blanche, does not care for her manners and resents her presence which is already interfering with his regimented but hedonistic lifestyle.

From the first scene, Blanche is nervous and jittery. She is reluctant to be seen in the glare of light and seems to have a drinking problem. She is also deceptive and is critical of her sister and brother-in-law.

Stanley later questions Blanche about her earlier marriage. Blanche had married when she was very young, but her husband died by suicide. This memory causes her obvious distress. The reader later learns she suffers from guilt due to the way she had reacted to finding out her husband&#x27;s homosexuality and his fatal reaction. Stanley, worried that he has been cheated out of an inheritance, demands to know what happened to Belle Reve, once a large plantation and the DuBois family home. He tells Stella about the Napoleonic Code, stating that with it a husband had control over his wife&#x27;s financial affairs. Blanche hands over all the documents pertaining to Belle Reve. While looking at the papers, Stanley notices a bundle of letters that Blanche emotionally proclaims are personal love letters from her dead husband. For a moment, Stanley seems caught off guard over her proclaimed feelings. Afterwards, he informs Blanche that Stella is going to have a baby.

The night after Blanche&#x27;s arrival, during one of Stanley&#x27;s poker games, Blanche meets Mitch, one of Stanley&#x27;s poker player buddies. His courteous manner sets him apart from the other men. Their chat becomes flirtatious and friendly, and Blanche easily charms him; they like each other. Suddenly becoming upset over multiple interruptions, Stanley explodes in a drunken rage and strikes Stella. Blanche and Stella take refuge with the upstairs neighbor, Eunice Hubbell. When Stanley recovers, he cries out from the courtyard below for Stella to come back by repeatedly calling her name until she comes down and allows herself to be carried off to bed. Blanche is shocked to see that her sister has returned to her husband right after he assaulted her. After Stella returns to Stanley, Blanche and Mitch sit at the bottom of the steps in the courtyard, where Mitch apologizes for Stanley&#x27;s coarse behavior.

The next morning, Blanche rushes to Stella and describes Stanley as subhuman, though Stella assures Blanche that she and Stanley are fine. Stanley overhears the conversation but keeps silent. When Stanley comes in, Stella hugs and kisses him, letting Blanche know that her low opinion of Stanley does not matter.

As the weeks pass, the friction between Blanche and Stanley continues to grow. Blanche has hope in Mitch, and tells Stella that she wants to go away with him and not be anyone&#x27;s problem. During a meeting between the two, Blanche confesses to Mitch that once she was married to a young man, Allan Grey, whom she later discovered in a sexual encounter with an older man. Grey later killed himself when Blanche told him she was disgusted with him. The story touches Mitch, who tells Blanche that they need each other. Mitch also has lost someone and seems to have empathy with Blanche&#x27;s situation.

Later, Stanley repeats gossip to Stella from a seedy salesman with contacts in Laurel that Blanche was fired from her teaching job for involvement with an under-age student and that she lived at a hotel known for prostitution. Stella erupts in anger over Stanley&#x27;s cruelty after he reveals he has already told Mitch. Later that evening, at Blanche&#x27;s birthday party, there is an empty seat at the table for Mitch. Stanley gives Blanche a birthday &quot;present&quot;, a one-way ticket back to Laurel by Greyhound bus. An argument ensues between Stella and Stanley, but is cut short as Stella goes into unexpected labor and is taken by her husband to the hospital.

As Blanche waits at home alone, Mitch arrives and confronts Blanche with the stories that Stanley has told him. She eventually confesses that the stories are true. She pleads for forgiveness. An angry and humiliated Mitch rejects her. Nevertheless, he demands sex from her, suggesting that it is his right since he has waited for so long for nothing. Blanche threatens to cry fire and tells him to get out.

Stanley returns home to find Blanche alone in the apartment. She has descended into another fantasy about an old suitor coming to provide financial support and take her away from New Orleans. She falsely claims that Mitch had asked for her forgiveness, but she had rejected him. Stanley goes along with the act before angrily scorning Blanche&#x27;s lies, hypocrisy and behavior, and calling out her lie about Mitch. He advances toward her; in response, she threatens to attack him with a broken bottle, but is overpowered. Blanche collapses on the floor and Stanley is last seen taking her unconscious into his bed.

Some time in the near future, during a poker game at the Kowalski apartment, Stella and Eunice are seen packing Blanche&#x27;s meager belongings while Blanche takes a bath in a catatonic state, having suffered a mental breakdown. Although Blanche has told Stella about Stanley raping her (which he denies), Stella cannot bring herself to believe her sister&#x27;s story. When a doctor and a matron arrive to take Blanche to the hospital, she initially resists them and the nurse painfully restrains her. Mitch, present at the poker game, breaks down in tears. The doctor is far more gentle and she goes willingly with him, saying, &quot;Whoever you are – I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.&quot; The poker game continues, uninterrupted.

== Stage productions ==

=== Original Broadway production ===

The original Broadway production was produced by Irene Mayer Selznick and directed by Elia Kazan. It opened at the Shubert Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut in early November 1947, then played the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia before moving to the Ethel Barrymore Theatre on December 3, 1947. Selznick originally wanted to cast Margaret Sullavan and John Garfield, but settled on the less well-known Jessica Tandy and a virtual unknown at the time, Marlon Brando. The opening night cast also included Kim Hunter as Stella and Karl Malden as Mitch. Tandy was cast after Williams saw her performance in a West Coast production of his one-act play &quot;Portrait of a Madonna&quot;. Williams believed that casting Brando, who was young for the part as it was originally conceived, would evolve Kowalski from being a vicious older man to someone whose unintentional cruelty can be attributed to youthful ignorance. Despite its shocking scenes and gritty dialogue, the audience applauded the debut performance. Brooks Atkinson, reviewing the opening in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described Tandy&#x27;s &quot;superb performance&quot; as &quot;almost incredibly true&quot;, concluding that Williams &quot;has spun a poignant and luminous story&quot;.

Later in the run, Uta Hagen succeeded Tandy, Carmelita Pope succeeded Hunter, and Anthony Quinn succeeded Brando. Hagen and Quinn took the show on a national tour directed by Harold Clurman, and then returned to Broadway for additional performances. Ralph Meeker also took on the part of Stanley both in the Broadway and touring companies. Tandy received a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play in 1948, sharing the honor with Judith Anderson and Katharine Cornell. The original Broadway production closed, after 855 performances, in 1949.

=== Other early productions ===
The first adaptation of &quot;Streetcar&quot; in Greece was performed in 1948 by Koun&#x27;s Art Theater, two years before its film adaptation and one year before its London premiere, directed by Karolos Koun starring Melina Mercouri as Blanche and Vasilis Diamantopoulos as Stanley, with original music by Manos Hadjidakis.

The London production, directed by Laurence Olivier, opened at the Aldwych Theatre on October 12, 1949. It starred Bonar Colleano as Stanley, Vivien Leigh as Blanche, Renée Asherson as Stella and Bernard Braden as Mitch.

An Australian production with Viola Keats as Blanche and Arthur Franz as Stanley opened at the Comedy Theatre in Melbourne in February 1950.

=== Revivals ===
The first all-black production of &quot;Streetcar&quot; was likely performed by the Summer Theatre Company at Lincoln University in Jefferson City, Missouri, in August 1953 and directed by one of Williams&#x27;s former classmates at Iowa, Thomas D. Pawley, as noted in the &quot;Streetcar&quot; edition of the &quot;Plays in Production&quot; series published by Cambridge University Press.

Tallulah Bankhead, for whom Williams originally had written the role of Blanche, starred in a 1956 New York City Center Company production directed by Herbert Machiz.

In 1972, American composer Frances Ziffer set &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; to music.

The first Broadway revival of the play was in 1973. It was produced by the Lincoln Center, at the Vivian Beaumont Theater, and starred Rosemary Harris as Blanche, James Farentino as Stanley and Patricia Conolly as Stella.

in 1976, Rip Torn enlisted director Jack Gelber to helm a revival at the once celebrated Academy Festival Theatre in Lake Forest, Illinois starring himself as Stanley and his wife Geraldine Page as Blanche. The production was threateningly realistic, projecting a
brightly lit, garbage-filled stage reflecting a hostile, predatory world and immersing the audience in a total
theatre experience. Gelber&#x27;s Streetcar was troubling for the critics because it was raw, even
dangerous. It pushed the Streetcar script to the farthest reaches of
urban violence and unabated naturalism. One review said &quot;This is not the Blanche of butterfly wings. This is gossamer with guts.&quot; Page&#x27;s performance was described as displaying little of Leigh&#x27;s hysteria or Tandy&#x27;s forlorn helplessness.

The spring 1988 revival at the Circle in the Square Theatre starred Aidan Quinn opposite Blythe Danner as Blanche and Frances McDormand as Stella.

A highly publicized and acclaimed revival in 1992 starred Alec Baldwin as Stanley and Jessica Lange as Blanche. It was staged at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre, where the original production was staged. This production proved so successful that it was filmed for television. It featured Timothy Carhart as Mitch and Amy Madigan as Stella, as well as future &quot;Sopranos&quot; stars James Gandolfini and Aida Turturro. Gandolfini was Carhart&#x27;s understudy.

In 1997, Le Petit Theatre du Vieux Carré in New Orleans mounted a 50th Anniversary production, with music by the Marsalis family, starring Michael Arata and Shelly Poncy. In 2009, the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia, where the original pre-Broadway tryout was held, staged a production of the play.

In 1997, at Steppenwolf Theatre, Chicago IL, Gary Sinise as Stanley, John C Reilly as Mitch, Kathryn Erbe as Stella, and Laila Robins as Blanche.

Glenn Close starred in Trevor Nunn&#x27;s 2002 production for the National Theatre at the Lyttleton Theatre, London.

The 2005 Broadway revival was directed by Edward Hall and produced by The Roundabout Theater Company. It starred John C. Reilly as Stanley, Amy Ryan as Stella, and Natasha Richardson as Blanche. The production was Richardson&#x27;s final appearance on Broadway; she died in 2009 following a skiing accident.

Bette Bourne and Paul Shaw of the British gay theater company Bloolips, and Peggy Shaw and Lois Weaver of the American lesbian theater company Split Britches, collaborated and performed a gender-bent adaptation titled &quot;Belle Reprieve&quot;. Blanche was played as &quot;man in a dress&quot;, Stanley as a &quot;butch lesbian&quot;, Mitch as a &quot;fairy disguised as a man&quot;, and Stella as a &quot;woman disguised as a woman&quot;.

The Sydney Theatre Company production of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; premiered on September 5 and ran until October 17, 2009. This production, directed by Liv Ullmann, starred Cate Blanchett as Blanche, Joel Edgerton as Stanley, Robin McLeavy as Stella and Tim Richards as Mitch.

From July 2009 until October 2009, Rachel Weisz and Ruth Wilson starred in a highly acclaimed revival of the play in London&#x27;s West End at the Donmar Warehouse directed by Rob Ashford.

In April 2012, Blair Underwood, Nicole Ari Parker, Daphne Rubin-Vega and Wood Harris starred in a multiracial adaptation at the Broadhurst Theatre. Theatre review aggregator &quot;Curtain Critic&quot; gave the production a score of 61 out of 100 based on the opinions of 17 critics.

A production at the Young Vic, London, opened on July 23, 2014, and closed on September 19, 2014. Directed by Benedict Andrews and starring Gillian Anderson, Ben Foster, Vanessa Kirby and Corey Johnson; this production garnered critical acclaim and is the fastest-selling show produced by the Young Vic. On September 16, 2014, the performance was relayed live to over one thousand cinemas in the UK as part of the National Theatre Live project. Thus far, the production has been screened in over 2000 venues. From April 23, 2016, until June 4, 2016, the production was reprised at the new St. Ann&#x27;s Warehouse in Brooklyn, New York City. In 2020 during the COVID-19 lockdowns, it was released for free on YouTube as part of the National Theatre At Home series.

In 2016 Sarah Frankcom directed a production at the Royal Exchange in Manchester starring Maxine Peake, Ben Batt, Sharon Duncan Brewster and Youssef Kerkour. It opened on 8 September and closed on 15 October. It was well-received, and Peake&#x27;s performance in particular received praise.

In 2018, it headlined the third annual Tennessee Williams Festival St. Louis at the Grandel Theatre. Carrie Houk, the Festival&#x27;s Executive Artistic Director, and Tim Ocel, the director of the play, chose to cast the play with actors whose ages were close to Tennessee Williams&#x27; original intentions. (The birthday party is for Blanche&#x27;s 30th birthday.) Sophia Brown starred as Blanche, with Nick Narcisi as Stanley, Lana Dvorak as Stella, and Spencer Sickmann as Mitch. Henry Polkes composed the original score, and James Wolk designed the set. The critics were unanimous in their praise.

The play was revived again in 2022 at London&#x27;s Almeida Theatre under the direction of Rebecca Frecknall, with Patsy Ferran taking the role of Blanche opposite Paul Mescal as Stanley, and Anjana Vasan as Stella. The play received widespread critical acclaim and its West End transfer became the fastest-selling production to date in any Ambassador Theatre Group venue. The revival received 6 Laurence Olivier Awards nominations, winning 3; Best Revival, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actress for Mescal and Vasan respectively.

In February 2024, , a liberal arts school that received much of Tennessee Williams&#x27; estate, revived the play, under the direction of James Crawford. The Tennessee Williams Center in Sewanee houses the university&#x27;s theatre departments while the school owns the rights to Williams&#x27; works. With the show being sold out within days, the production received local acclaim from residents and the student body.

A Pitlochry Festival Theatre production of the play, directed by Elizabeth Newman and with Kirsty Stuart in the role of Blanche DuBois, was staged at the Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh in October and November 2024.

The 2022 Almeida Theatre production is scheduled to return to the West End for a limited three week run at the Noël Coward Theatre from 3 February 2025. The show is then scheduled to transfer to New York City at the Brooklyn Academy of Music from 28 February 2025. The entire 2022 revival cast is expected to reprise their roles.

In March 2025 a Sheffield Theatres production is running at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Directed by Josh Seymour. The cast includes Joanna Vanderham as Blanche. With Amara Okereke as Stella, Jake Dunn as Stanley and Taylor Kovacevic-Ebong as Mitch.

== Adaptations ==
=== Film ===
In 1951, Warner Bros. released a film adaptation of the play, directed by Elia Kazan. Malden, Brando, Dennis, and Hunter reprised their Broadway roles. They were joined by Vivien Leigh from the London production in the part of Blanche. The movie won four Academy Awards, including three acting awards (Leigh for Best Actress, Malden for Best Supporting Actor and Hunter for Best Supporting Actress), the first time a film won three out of four acting awards (Brando was nominated for Best Actor but lost). Composer Alex North received an Academy Award nomination for this, his first film score. Jessica Tandy was the only lead actor from the original Broadway production not to appear in the 1951 film. The ending was slightly altered. Stella does not remain with Stanley as she does in the play.

Pedro Almodóvar&#x27;s 1999 Academy Award-winning film &quot;All About My Mother&quot; features a Spanish-language version of the play being performed by some of the supporting characters and the play plays an important role in the film. However, some of the film&#x27;s dialogue is taken from the 1951 film version, not the original stage version.

The 1973 Woody Allen film &quot;Sleeper&quot; includes a late scene in which Miles (Woody) and Luna (Diane Keaton) briefly take on the roles of Stanley (Luna) and Blanche (Miles).

It was noted by many critics that the 2013 Academy Award-winning Woody Allen film &quot;Blue Jasmine&quot; had much in common with &quot;Streetcar&quot; and is most likely a loose adaptation. It shares a very similar plot and characters, although it has been suitably updated for modern film audiences.

In 2014, Gillian Anderson directed and starred in a short prequel to &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, titled &quot;The Departure&quot;. The short film was written by the novelist Andrew O&#x27;Hagan and is part of Young Vic&#x27;s short film series, which was produced in collaboration with &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

=== Opera ===
In 1995, an opera was adapted and composed by André Previn with a libretto by Philip Littell. It had its premiere at the San Francisco Opera during the 1998–1999 season, and featured Renée Fleming as Blanche.

=== Ballet ===
A 1952 ballet production with choreography by Valerie Bettis, which Mia Slavenska and Frederic Franklin&#x27;s Slavenska-Franklin Ballet debuted at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in Montreal, featured the music of Alex North, who had composed the music for the 1951 film.

Another ballet production was staged by John Neumeier in Frankfurt in 1983. Music included &quot;Visions fugitives&quot; by Prokofiev and Alfred Schnittke&#x27;s First Symphony.

In the mid-2000s, another production was staged by Winthrop Corey, then artistic director of Mobile Ballet.

In 2006, a production was staged by John Alleyne, then artistic director of Ballet BC.

In 2012, Scottish Ballet collaborated with theatre and film director Nancy Meckler and international choreographer Annabelle Lopez Ochoa to create a staging of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.

In 2018, the Erkel Theatre in Budapest revisited the production with Marianna Venekei choreographing, Iurii Kekalo dancing as Stanley Kowalski, Lea Földi as Blanche DuBois, and Anna Krupp as Stella.

=== Television ===

In 1955, the television program &quot;Omnibus&quot; featured Jessica Tandy reviving her original Broadway performance as Blanche, with her husband, Hume Cronyn, as Mitch. It aired only portions of the play that featured the Blanche and Mitch characters.

The 1984 television version featured Ann-Margret as Blanche, Treat Williams as Stanley, Beverly D&#x27;Angelo as Stella and Randy Quaid as Mitch. It was directed by John Erman and the teleplay was adapted by Oscar Saul. The music score by composed by Marvin Hamlisch. Ann-Margret, D&#x27;Angelo and Quaid were all nominated for Emmy Awards, but none won. However, it did win four Emmys, including one for cinematographer Bill Butler. Ann-Margret won a Golden Globe award for her performance, and Treat Williams was nominated for Best Actor in a Miniseries or TV Movie.

A 1995 television version was based on the highly successful Broadway revival that starred Alec Baldwin and Jessica Lange. However, only Baldwin and Lange were from the stage production. The TV version added John Goodman as Mitch and Diane Lane as Stella. This production was directed by Glenn Jordan. Baldwin, Lange and Goodman all received Emmy Award nominations. Lange won a Golden Globe award (for Best Actress in a Miniseries or TV Movie), and Baldwin was nominated for Best Actor.

In 1998, PBS aired a taped version of the opera adaptation that featured the original San Francisco Opera cast. The program received an Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Classical Music/Dance Program.

In a 1992 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;A Streetcar Named Marge&quot;, a musical version of the play, titled &quot;Oh, Streetcar!&quot;, was featured. Ned Flanders and Marge Simpson took the leading roles as Stanley and Blanche, respectively.

In a 2016 episode of &quot;The Originals&quot;, titled &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, Klaus Mikaelson and Elijah Mikaelson are forced to face two siblings, Tristan and Aurora de Martel, once friends but now foes.

== Inspirations ==

The Desire Line ran from 1920 to 1948, at the height of streetcar use in New Orleans. The route ran down Royal, through the Quarter, to Desire Street in the Bywater district, and back up to Canal. Blanche&#x27;s route in the play—&quot;They told me to take a streetcar named Desire, transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at—Elysian Fields!&quot;—is allegorical, taking advantage of New Orleans&#x27;s colorful street names: the Desire line crossed Elysian Fields Avenue on its way to Canal Street. There, one could transfer to the Cemeteries line, which ran along Canal, blocks away from Elysian Fields.

The character of Blanche is thought to be based on Williams&#x27; sister, Rose Williams, who struggled with mental health problems and became incapacitated after a lobotomy. The success of the play enabled Williams to finance his sister&#x27;s care. Other biographical elements include Williams&#x27; mother being a Southern lady reflected in the Southern background of Stella and Blanche, and his father being a travelling salesman (as reflected in Stanley&#x27;s character) who enjoyed drinking and playing poker with his friends. Williams was born in Columbus, Mississippi and had a family home in St. Louis. The common motifs of homosexuality and mental illness in the play come from his struggle with his sexual orientation and his experience with his sister&#x27;s mental illness. Stanley&#x27;s loathing for Blanche&#x27;s prim and proper attitude probably was inspired by Williams&#x27;s father&#x27;s aversion to his mother&#x27;s Southern airs.

The theatre critic and former actress Blanche Marvin, a friend of Williams, says the playwright used her name for the character Blanche DuBois, named the character&#x27;s sister Stella after Marvin&#x27;s former surname Zohar (which means Star), and took the play&#x27;s line &quot;I&#x27;ve always depended on the kindness of strangers&quot; from something she said to him.

== &quot;A Streetcar Named Success&quot; ==
&quot;A Streetcar Named Success&quot; is an essay by Tennessee Williams about art and the artist&#x27;s role in society. It often is included in paper editions of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. A version of this essay first appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on November 30, 1947, four days before the opening of &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Another version of this essay, titled &quot;The Catastrophe of Success&quot;, is sometimes used as an introduction to &quot;The Glass Menagerie&quot;.

It provides generic messaging models, able to handle the producer–consumer problem, that can be used to facilitate the sending and receiving of messages between software systems. Jakarta Messaging is a part of Jakarta EE and was originally defined by a specification developed at Sun Microsystems before being guided by the Java Community Process.

== General idea of messaging ==
Messaging is a form of &quot;loosely coupled&quot; distributed communication, where in this context the term &#x27;communication&#x27; can be understood as an exchange of messages between software components. Message-oriented technologies attempt to relax &quot;tightly coupled&quot; communication (such as TCP network sockets, CORBA or RMI) by the introduction of an intermediary component. This approach allows software components to communicate with each other indirectly. Benefits of this include message senders not needing to have precise knowledge of their receivers.

The advantages of messaging include the ability to integrate heterogeneous platforms, reduce system bottlenecks, increase scalability, and respond more quickly to change.

=== Version history ===

* JMS 1.0
* JMS 1.0.1 (October 5, 1998)
* JMS 1.0.1a (October 30, 1998)
* JMS 1.0.2 (December 17, 1999)
* JMS 1.0.2a (December 23, 1999)
* JMS 1.0.2b (August 27, 2001)
* JMS 1.1 (April 12, 2002)
* JMS 2.0 (May 21, 2013)
* JMS 2.0a (March 16, 2015)

JMS 2.0 is currently maintained under the Java Community Process as JSR 343.

JMS 3.0 is under early development as part of Jakarta EE.

== Elements ==

The following are JMS elements:

; JMS provider
: An implementation of the JMS interface for message-oriented middleware (MOM). Providers are implemented as either a Java JMS implementation or an adapter to a non-Java MOM.
; JMS client
: An application or process that produces and/or receives messages.
; JMS producer/publisher
: A JMS client that creates and sends messages.
; JMS consumer/subscriber
: A JMS client that receives messages.
; JMS message
: An object that contains the data being transferred between JMS clients.
; JMS queue
: A staging area that contains messages that have been sent and are waiting to be read (by only one consumer). As the name queue suggests, the messages are delivered in the order sent. A JMS queue guarantees that each message is processed only once.
; JMS topic
: A distribution mechanism for publishing messages that are delivered to multiple subscribers.

== Models ==
The JMS API supports two distinct models:
* Point-to-point
* Publish-and-subscribe

===Point-to-point model===
Under the &quot;point-to-point&quot; messaging system, messages are routed to individual consumers who maintain queues of incoming messages. This messaging type is built on the concept of message queues, senders, and receivers. Each message is addressed to a specific queue, and the receiving clients extract messages from the queues established to hold their messages. While any number of producers can send messages to the queue, each message is guaranteed to be delivered, and consumed by one consumer. Queues retain all messages sent to them until the messages are consumed or until the messages expire. If no consumers are registered to consume the messages, the queue holds them until a consumer registers to consume them.

===Publish-and-subscribe model===
The &quot;publish-and-subscribe&quot; model supports publishing messages to a particular message &quot;topic&quot;. &quot;Subscribers&quot; may register interest in receiving messages &quot;published&quot; on a particular message topic. In this model, neither the publisher nor the subscriber knows about each other. A good analogy for this is an anonymous bulletin board.

* Zero or more consumers will receive the message.
* There is a timing dependency between publishers and subscribers. The publisher has to create a message topic for clients to subscribe. The subscriber has to remain continuously active to receive messages, unless it has established a durable subscription. In that case, messages published while the subscriber is not connected will be redistributed whenever it reconnects.

JMS provides a way of separating the application from the transport layer of providing data. The same Java classes can be used to communicate with different JMS providers by using the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) information for the desired provider. The classes first use a &quot;connection factory&quot; to connect to the queue or topic, and then use populate and send or publish the messages. On the receiving side, the clients then receive or subscribe to the messages.

== URI scheme ==
RFC 6167 defines a codice_1 URI scheme for the Java Message Service.

== Provider implementations ==

To use JMS, one must have a JMS provider that can manage the sessions, queues and topics. Starting from Java EE version 1.4, a JMS provider has to be contained in &quot;all&quot; Java EE application servers. This can be implemented using the message inflow management of the Java EE Connector Architecture, which was first made available in that version.

The following is a list of common JMS providers:

* Amazon SQS&#x27;s Java Messaging Library
* Apache ActiveMQ Classic
* Apache ActiveMQ Artemis
* Apache Qpid, using AMQP
* IBM MQ (formerly MQSeries, then WebSphere MQ)
* IBM WebSphere Application Server&#x27;s Service Integration Bus (SIBus)
* JBoss Messaging and HornetQ from JBoss
* JORAM from the OW2 Consortium
* Open Message Queue from Oracle
* OpenJMS from the OpenJMS Group
* Oracle WebLogic Server and Oracle AQ
* PubSub+ from Solace
* RabbitMQ from Pivotal Software
* TIBCO Enterprise Message Service

<text>Jakarta EE, formerly Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE), is a set of specifications, extending Java SE with specifications for enterprise features such as distributed computing and web services. Jakarta EE applications are run on reference runtimes, which can be microservices or application servers, which handle transactions, security, scalability, concurrency and management of the components they are deploying.

Jakarta EE is defined by its specification. The specification defines APIs (application programming interface) and their interactions. As with other Java Community Process specifications, providers must meet certain conformance requirements in order to declare their products as &quot;Jakarta EE compliant&quot;.

Examples of contexts in which Jakarta EE referencing runtimes are used are: e-commerce, accounting, banking information systems.

== History ==
The platform was known as &quot;Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition&quot; or &quot;J2EE&quot; from version 1.2, until the name was changed to &quot;Java Platform, Enterprise Edition&quot; or &quot;Java EE&quot; in version 1.5.

Java EE was maintained by Oracle under the Java Community Process. On September 12, 2017, Oracle Corporation announced that it would submit Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation. The Eclipse top-level project has been named Eclipse Enterprise for Java (EE4J). The Eclipse Foundation could not agree with Oracle over the use of javax and Java trademarks. Oracle owns the trademark for the name &quot;Java&quot; and the platform was renamed from Java EE to Jakarta EE. The name refers to the largest city on the island of Java and also the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta. The name should not be confused with the former Jakarta Project which fostered a number of current and former Java projects at the Apache Software Foundation.

== Specifications ==
Jakarta EE includes several specifications that serve different purposes, like generating web pages, reading and writing from a database in a transactional way, managing distributed queues.

The Jakarta EE APIs include several technologies that extend the functionality of the base Java SE APIs, such as Jakarta Enterprise Beans, connectors, servlets, Jakarta Server Pages and several web service technologies.

=== Web specifications ===
* Jakarta Servlet: defines how to manage HTTP requests, in a synchronous or asynchronous way. It is low level and other Jakarta EE specifications rely on it;
* Jakarta WebSocket: API specification that defines a set of APIs to service WebSocket connections;
* Jakarta Faces: a technology for constructing user interfaces out of components;
* Jakarta Expression Language (&quot;EL&quot;) is a simple language originally designed to satisfy the specific needs of web application developers. It is used specifically in Jakarta Faces to bind components to (backing) beans and in Contexts and Dependency Injection to named beans, but can be used throughout the entire platform.

=== Web service specifications ===
* Jakarta RESTful Web Services provides support in creating web services according to the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural pattern;
* Jakarta JSON Processing is a set of specifications to manage information encoded in JSON format;
* Jakarta JSON Binding provides specifications to convert JSON information into or from Java classes;
* Jakarta XML Binding allows mapping XML into Java objects;
* Jakarta XML Web Services can be used to create SOAP web services.

=== Enterprise specifications ===
* Jakarta Activation (&quot;JAF&quot;) specifies an architecture to extend component Beans by providing data typing and bindings of such types.
* Jakarta Contexts and Dependency Injection (&quot;CDI&quot;) is a specification to provide a dependency injection container;
* Jakarta Enterprise Beans (&quot;EJB&quot;) specification defines a set of lightweight APIs that an object container (the EJB container) will support in order to provide transactions (using JTA), remote procedure calls (using RMI or RMI-IIOP), concurrency control, dependency injection and access control for business objects. This package contains the Jakarta Enterprise Beans classes and interfaces that define the contracts between the enterprise bean and its clients and between the enterprise bean and the ejb container.
* Jakarta Persistence (&quot;JPA&quot;) are specifications about object-relational mapping between relation database tables and Java classes.
* Jakarta Transactions (&quot;JTA&quot;) contains the interfaces and annotations to interact with the transaction support offered by Jakarta EE. Even though this API abstracts from the really low-level details, the interfaces are also considered somewhat low-level and the average application developer in Jakarta EE is either assumed to be relying on transparent handling of transactions by the higher level EJB abstractions, or using the annotations provided by this API in combination with CDI managed beans.
* Jakarta Messaging (&quot;JMS&quot;) provides a common way for Java programs to create, send, receive and read an enterprise messaging system&#x27;s messages.

=== Other specifications ===
* Jakarta Validation: This package contains the annotations and interfaces for the declarative validation support offered by the Jakarta Validation API. Jakarta Validation provides a unified way to provide constraints on beans (e.g. Jakarta Persistence model classes) that can be enforced cross-layer. In Jakarta EE, Jakarta Persistence honors bean validation constraints in the persistence layer, while JSF does so in the view layer.
* Jakarta Batch provides the means for batch processing in applications to run long running background tasks that possibly involve a large volume of data and which may need to be periodically executed.
* Jakarta Connectors is a Java-based tool for connecting application servers and enterprise information systems (&quot;EIS&quot;) as part of enterprise application integration (&quot;EAI&quot;). This is a low-level API aimed at vendors that the average application developer typically does not come in contact with.

== Web profile ==
In an attempt to limit the footprint of web containers, both in physical and in conceptual terms, the web profile was created, a subset of the Jakarta EE specifications. The Jakarta EE web profile comprises the following:
== Certified referencing runtimes ==

Although by definition all Jakarta EE implementations provide the same base level of technologies (namely, the Jakarta EE spec and the associated APIs), they can differ considerably with respect to extra features (like connectors, clustering, fault tolerance, high availability, security, etc.), installed size, memory footprint, startup time, etc.

=== Jakarta EE ===

=== Java EE ===

==Code sample==

The code sample shown below demonstrates how various technologies in Java EE 7 are used together to build a web form for editing a user.

In Jakarta EE a (web) UI can be built using Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Server Pages (&quot;JSP&quot;), or Jakarta Faces (&quot;JSF&quot;) with Facelets. The example below uses Faces and Facelets. Not explicitly shown is that the input components use the Jakarta EE Bean Validation API under the covers to validate constraints.
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;
 xmlns:h=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/html&quot; xmlns:f=&quot;http://xmlns.jcp.org/jsf/core&quot;&gt;

 &lt;f:metadata&gt;
 &lt;f:viewParam name=&quot;user_id&quot; value=&quot;#{userEdit.user}&quot; converter=&quot;#{userConvertor}&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/f:metadata&gt;

 &lt;h:body&gt;

 &lt;h:messages /&gt;

 &lt;h:form&gt;
 &lt;h:panelGrid columns=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
 &lt;h:outputLabel for=&quot;firstName&quot; value=&quot;First name&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;h:inputText id=&quot;firstName&quot; value=&quot;#{userEdit.user.firstName}&quot; label=&quot;First name&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;h:outputLabel for=&quot;lastName&quot; value=&quot;Last name&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;h:inputText id=&quot;lastName&quot; value=&quot;#{userEdit.user.lastName}&quot; label=&quot;Last name&quot; /&gt;

 &lt;h:commandButton action=&quot;#{userEdit.saveUser}&quot; value=&quot;Save&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/h:panelGrid&gt;
 &lt;/h:form&gt;

 &lt;/h:body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
===Example Backing Bean class ===

To assist the view, Jakarta EE uses a concept called a &quot;Backing Bean&quot;. The example below uses Contexts and Dependency Injection (CDI) and Jakarta Enterprise Beans (&quot;EJB&quot;).
@Named
@ViewScoped
public class UserEdit {

 private User user;

 @Inject
 private UserDAO userDAO;

 public String saveUser() {
 userDAO.save(this.user);
 addFlashMessage(&quot;User &quot; + this.user.getId() + &quot; saved&quot;);

 return &quot;users.xhtml?faces-redirect=true&quot;;

 public void setUser(User user) {
 this.user = user;

 public User getUser() {
 return user;
}
===Example Data Access Object class===

To implement business logic, Jakarta Enterprise Beans (&quot;EJB&quot;) is the dedicated technology in Jakarta EE. For the actual persistence, JDBC or Jakarta Persistence (JPA) can be used. The example below uses EJB and JPA. Not explicitly shown is that JTA is used under the covers by EJB to control transactional behavior.
@Stateless
public class UserDAO {

 @PersistenceContext
 private EntityManager entityManager;

 public void save(User user) {
 entityManager.persist(user);

 public void update(User user) {
 entityManager.merge(user);

 public List&lt;User&gt; getAll() {
 return entityManager.createNamedQuery(&quot;User.getAll&quot;, User.class)
 .getResultList();



===Example Entity class===

For defining entity/model classes Jakarta EE provides the Jakarta Persistence (&quot;JPA&quot;), and for expressing constraints on those entities it provides the Bean Validation API. The example below uses both these technologies.
@Entity
public class User {

 @Id
 @GeneratedValue(strategy = IDENTITY)
 private Integer id;

 @Size(min = 2, message=&quot;First name too short&quot;)
 private String firstName;

 @Size(min = 2, message=&quot;Last name too short&quot;)
 private String lastName;

 public Integer getId() {
 return id;

 public void setId(Integer id) {
 this.id = id;

 public String getFirstName() {
 return firstName;

 public void setFirstName(String firstName) {
 this.firstName = firstName;

 public String getLastName() {
 return lastName;

 public void setLastName(String lastName) {
 this.lastName = lastName;

<text>Java Platform, Micro Edition or Java ME is a computing platform for development and deployment of portable code for embedded and mobile devices (micro-controllers, sensors, gateways, mobile phones, personal digital assistants, TV set-top boxes, printers). Java ME was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Micro Edition or J2ME. 

The platform uses the object-oriented Java programming language, and is part of the Java software-platform family. It was designed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle Corporation) and replaced a similar technology, PersonalJava.

In 2013, with more than 3 billion Java ME enabled mobile phones in the market, the platform was in continued decline as smartphones have overtaken feature phones.

== History ==

The platform used to be popular in feature phones, such as Nokia&#x27;s Series 40 models. It was also supported on the Bada operating system and on Symbian OS along with native software. Users of Windows CE, Windows Mobile, Maemo, MeeGo and Android could download Java ME for their respective environments (&quot;proof-of-concept&quot; for Android).

Originally developed under the Java Community Process as JSR 68, the different flavors of Java ME have evolved in separate JSRs. Java ME devices implement a &quot;profile&quot;. The most common of these are the Mobile Information Device Profile aimed at mobile devices such as cell phones, and the Personal Profile aimed at consumer products and embedded devices like set-top boxes and PDAs. Profiles are subsets of &quot;configurations&quot;, of which there are currently two: the Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) and the Connected Device Configuration (CDC).

In 2008, Java ME platforms were restricted to JRE 1.3 features and use that version of the class file format (internally known as version 47.0).

== Implementations ==

Oracle provides a reference implementation of the specification, and some configurations and profiles for MIDP and CDC. Starting with the JavaME 3.0 SDK, a NetBeans-based IDE supported them in a single IDE.

In contrast to the numerous binary implementations of the Java Platform built by Sun for servers and workstations, Sun tended not to provide binaries for the platforms of Java ME targets, and instead relied on third parties to provide their own. 

The exception was an MIDP 1.0 JRE (JVM) for Palm OS. Sun provides no J2ME JRE for the Microsoft Windows Mobile (Pocket PC) based devices, despite an open-letter campaign to Sun to release a rumored internal implementation of PersonalJava known by the code name &quot;Captain America&quot;. Third party implementations are widely used by Windows Mobile vendors.

At some point, Sun released a now-abandoned reference implementation under the name phoneME.

Operating systems targeting Java ME have been implemented by DoCoMo in the form of DoJa, and by SavaJe as SavaJe OS. The latter company was purchased by Sun in April 2007 and now forms the basis of Sun&#x27;s JavaFX Mobile.

The open-source Mika VM aims to implement JavaME CDC/FP, but is not certified as such (certified implementations are required to charge royalties, which is impractical for an open-source project). Consequently, devices which use this implementation are not allowed to claim JavaME CDC compatibility.

The Linux-based Android operating system uses a proprietary version of Java that is similar in intent, but very different in many ways from Java ME.

=== Emulators ===
* Sun Java Wireless Toolkit (WTK, for short) — is a proprietary Java ME emulator, originally provided by Sun Microsystems, and later by Oracle.
* MicroEmulator (MicroEMU, for short) — is an open-source Java ME emulator.

There are other emulators, including emulators provided as part of development kits by phone manufacturers, such as Nokia, Sony-Ericsson, Siemens Mobile, etc.

== Connected Limited Device Configuration ==

The Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) contains a strict subset of the Java-class libraries, and is the minimum amount needed for a Java virtual machine to operate. CLDC is basically used for classifying myriad devices into a fixed configuration.

A configuration provides the most basic set of libraries and virtual-machine features that must be present in each implementation of a J2ME environment. When coupled with one or more profiles, the Connected Limited Device Configuration gives developers a solid Java platform for creating applications for consumer and embedded devices.
The configuration is designed for devices with 160KB to 512KB total memory, which has a minimum of 160KB of ROM and 32KB of RAM available for the Java platform.

=== Mobile Information Device Profile ===
Designed for mobile phones, the Mobile Information Device Profile includes a GUI, and a data storage API, and MIDP 2.0 includes a basic 2D gaming API. Applications written for this profile are called MIDlets.

&quot;JSR 271: Mobile Information Device Profile 3&quot; (Final release on Dec 9, 2009) specified the 3rd generation Mobile Information Device Profile (MIDP3), expanding upon the functionality in all areas as well as improving interoperability across devices. A key design goal of MIDP3 is backward compatibility with MIDP2 content.

==== Information Module Profile ====
The Information Module Profile (IMP) is a profile for embedded, &quot;headless&quot; devices such as vending machines, industrial embedded applications, security systems, and similar devices with either simple or no display and with some limited network connectivity.

Originally introduced by Siemens Mobile and Nokia as JSR-195, IMP 1.0 is a strict subset of MIDP 1.0 except that it does not include user interface APIs — in other words, it does not include support for the Java package codice_1. JSR-228, also known as IMP-NG, is IMP&#x27;s next generation that is based on MIDP 2.0, leveraging MIDP 2.0&#x27;s new security and networking types and APIs, and other APIs such as codice_2 and codice_3, but again it does not include UI APIs, nor the game API.

== Connected Device Configuration ==
The Connected Device Configuration is a subset of Java SE, containing almost all the libraries that are not GUI related. It is richer than CLDC.

=== Foundation Profile ===
The Foundation Profile is a Java ME Connected Device Configuration (CDC) profile. This profile is intended to be used by devices requiring a complete implementation of the Java virtual machine up to and including the entire Java Platform, Standard Edition API. Typical implementations will use some subset of that API set depending on the additional profiles supported. This specification was developed under the Java Community Process.

=== Personal Basis Profile ===
The Personal Basis Profile extends the Foundation Profile to include lightweight GUI support in the form of an AWT subset. This is the platform that BD-J is built upon.

== JSRs (Java Specification Requests) ==

=== Foundation ===
=== Main extensions ===
=== Future ===
== ESR ==
The ESR consortium is devoted to Standards for embedded Java. Especially cost effective Standards.
Typical applications domains are industrial control, machine-to-machine, medical, e-metering, home automation, consumer, human-to-machine-interface, ...

<text>Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE) is a computing platform for development and deployment of portable code for desktop and server environments. Java SE was formerly known as Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE).

The platform uses the Java programming language and is part of the Java software-platform family. Java SE defines a range of general-purpose APIs—such as Java APIs for the Java Class Library—and also includes the Java Language Specification and the Java Virtual Machine Specification. OpenJDK is the official reference implementation since version 7.

== Nomenclature, standards and specifications ==
The platform was known as &quot;Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition&quot; or &quot;J2SE&quot; from version 1.2, until the name was changed to &quot;Java Platform, Standard Edition&quot; or &quot;Java SE&quot; in version 1.5. The &quot;SE&quot; is used to distinguish the base platform from the Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Micro Edition (Java ME) platforms. The &quot;2&quot; was originally intended to emphasize the major changes introduced in version 1.2, but was removed in version 1.6. The naming convention has been changed several times over the Java version history. Starting with J2SE 1.4 (Merlin), Java SE has been developed under the Java Community Process, which produces descriptions of proposed and final specifications for the Java platform called Java Specification Requests (JSR). JSR 59 was the umbrella specification for J2SE 1.4 and JSR 176 specified J2SE 5.0 (Tiger). Java SE 6 (Mustang) was released under JSR 270.

Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) is a related specification that includes all the classes in Java SE, plus a number that are more useful to programs that run on servers as opposed to workstations.

Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) is a related specification intended to provide a certified collection of Java APIs for the development of software for small, resource-constrained devices such as cell phones, PDAs and set-top boxes.

The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and Java Development Kit (JDK) are the actual files downloaded and installed on a computer to run or develop Java programs, respectively.

== General purpose packages ==

=== java.lang ===
The Java package contains fundamental classes and interfaces closely tied to the language and runtime system. This includes the root classes that form the class hierarchy, types tied to the language definition, basic exceptions, math functions, threading, security functions, as well as some information on the underlying native system. This package contains 22 of 32 codice_1 classes provided in JDK 6.

The main classes and interfaces in codice_2 are:

* – the class that is the root of every class hierarchy.
* – the base class for enumeration classes (as of J2SE 5.0).
* – the class that is the root of the Java reflection system.
* – the class that is the base class of the exception class hierarchy.
* , , and – the base classes for each exception type.
* – the class that allows operations on threads.
* – the class for strings and string literals.
* and – classes for performing string manipulation (codice_3 as of J2SE 5.0).
* – the interface that allows generic comparison and ordering of objects (as of J2SE 1.2).
* – the interface that allows generic iteration using the enhanced codice_4 loop (as of J2SE 5.0).
* , , , , and – classes that provide &quot;system operations&quot; that manage the dynamic loading of classes, creation of external processes, host environment inquiries such as the time of day, and enforcement of security policies.
* and – classes that provide basic math functions such as sine, cosine, and square root (codice_5 as of J2SE 1.3).
* The primitive wrapper classes that encapsulate primitive types as objects.
* The basic exception classes thrown for language-level and other common exceptions.

Classes in codice_2 are automatically imported into every source file.

==== java.lang.ref ====
The package provides more flexible types of references than are otherwise available, permitting limited interaction between the application and the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) garbage collector. It is an important package, central enough to the language for the language designers to give it a name that starts with &quot;java.lang&quot;, but it is somewhat special-purpose and not used by a lot of developers. This package was added in J2SE 1.2.

Java has an expressive system of references and allows for special behavior for garbage collection. A normal reference in Java is known as a &quot;strong reference&quot;. The codice_7 package defines three other types of references—soft, weak, and phantom references. Each type of reference is designed for a specific use.

* A can be used to implement a cache. An object that is not reachable by a strong reference (that is, not strongly reachable), but is referenced by a soft reference is called &quot;softly reachable&quot;. A softly reachable object may be garbage collected at the discretion of the garbage collector. This generally means that softly reachable objects are only garbage collected when free memory is low—but again, this is at the garbage collector&#x27;s discretion. Semantically, a soft reference means, &quot;Keep this object when nothing else references it, unless the memory is needed.&quot;
* A is used to implement weak maps. An object that is not strongly or softly reachable, but is referenced by a weak reference is called &quot;weakly reachable&quot;. A weakly reachable object is garbage collected in the next collection cycle. This behavior is used in the class . A weak map allows the programmer to put key/value pairs in the map and not worry about the objects taking up memory when the key is no longer reachable anywhere else. Another possible application of weak references is the string intern pool. Semantically, a weak reference means &quot;get rid of this object when nothing else references it at the next garbage collection.&quot;
* A is used to reference objects that have been marked for garbage collection and have been finalized, but have not yet been reclaimed. An object that is not strongly, softly or weakly reachable, but is referenced by a phantom reference is called &quot;phantom reachable.&quot; This allows for more flexible cleanup than is possible with the finalization mechanism alone. Semantically, a phantom reference means &quot;this object is no longer needed and has been finalized in preparation for being collected.&quot;

Each of these reference types extends the class, which provides the method to return a strong reference to the referent object (or codice_8 if the reference has been cleared or if the reference type is phantom), and the method to clear the reference.

The codice_7 also defines the class , which can be used in each of the applications discussed above to keep track of objects that have changed reference type. When a codice_10 is created it is optionally registered with a reference queue. The application polls the reference queue to get references that have changed reachability state.

==== java.lang.reflect ====
Reflection is a constituent of the Java API that lets Java code examine and &quot;reflect&quot; on Java components at runtime and use the reflected members. Classes in the package, along with codice_11 and accommodate applications such as debuggers, interpreters, object inspectors, class browsers, and services such as object serialization and JavaBeans that need access to either the public members of a target object (based on its runtime class) or the members declared by a given class. This package was added in JDK 1.1.

Reflection is used to instantiate classes and invoke methods using their names, a concept that allows for dynamic programming. Classes, interfaces, methods, fields, and constructors can all be discovered and used at runtime. Reflection is supported by metadata that the JVM has about the program.

===== Techniques =====
There are basic techniques involved in reflection:

* Discovery – this involves taking an object or class and discovering the members, superclasses, implemented interfaces, and then possibly using the discovered elements.
* Use by name – involves starting with the symbolic name of an element and using the named element.

====== Discovery ======
Discovery typically starts with an object and calling the method to get the object&#x27;s codice_12. The codice_12 object has several methods for discovering the contents of the class, for example:

* – returns an array of objects representing all the public methods of the class or interface
* – returns an array of objects representing all the public constructors of the class
* – returns an array of objects representing all the public fields of the class or interface
* – returns an array of codice_12 objects representing all the public classes and interfaces that are members (e.g. inner classes) of the class or interface
* – returns the codice_12 object representing the superclass of the class or interface (codice_8 is returned for interfaces)
* – returns an array of codice_12 objects representing all the interfaces that are implemented by the class or interface

====== Use by name ======
The codice_12 object can be obtained either through discovery, by using the &quot;class literal&quot; (e.g. codice_19) or by using the name of the class (e.g. ). With a codice_12 object, member codice_21, codice_22, or codice_23 objects can be obtained using the symbolic name of the member. For example:
* – returns the codice_21 object representing the public method with the name &quot;methodName&quot; of the class or interface that accepts the parameters specified by the codice_25 parameters.
* – returns the codice_22 object representing the public constructor of the class that accepts the parameters specified by the codice_25 parameters.
* – returns the codice_23 object representing the public field with the name &quot;fieldName&quot; of the class or interface.

codice_21, codice_22, and codice_23 objects can be used to dynamically access the represented member of the class. For example:
* – returns an codice_32 containing the value of the field from the instance of the object passed to codice_33. (If the codice_23 object represents a static field then the codice_32 parameter is ignored and may be codice_8.)
* – returns an codice_32 containing the result of invoking the method for the instance of the first codice_32 parameter passed to codice_39. The remaining codice_40 parameters are passed to the method. (If the codice_21 object represents a static method then the first codice_32 parameter is ignored and may be codice_8.)
* – returns the new codice_32 instance from invoking the constructor. The codice_40 parameters are passed to the constructor. (Note that the parameterless constructor for a class can also be invoked by calling .)

===== Arrays and proxies =====
The codice_46 package also provides an class that contains static methods for creating and manipulating array objects, and since J2SE 1.3, a class that supports dynamic creation of proxy classes that implement specified interfaces.

The implementation of a codice_47 class is provided by a supplied object that implements the interface. The codice_48&#x27;s method is called for each method invoked on the proxy object—the first parameter is the proxy object, the second parameter is the codice_21 object representing the method from the interface implemented by the proxy, and the third parameter is the array of parameters passed to the interface method. The codice_39 method returns an codice_32 result that contains the result returned to the code that called the proxy interface method.

=== java.io ===
The package contains classes that support input and output. The classes in the package are primarily stream-oriented; however, a class for random access files is also provided. The central classes in the package are and , which are abstract base classes for reading from and writing to byte streams, respectively. The related classes and are abstract base classes for reading from and writing to character streams, respectively. The package also has a few miscellaneous classes to support interactions with the host file system.

==== Streams ====
The stream classes follow the decorator pattern by extending the base subclass to add features to the stream classes. Subclasses of the base stream classes are typically named for one of the following attributes:

* the source/destination of the stream data
* the type of data written to/read from the stream
* additional processing or filtering performed on the stream data

The stream subclasses are named using the naming pattern codice_52 where codice_53 is the name describing the feature and codice_54 is one of codice_55, codice_56, codice_57, or codice_58.

The following table shows the sources/destinations supported directly by the codice_59 package:

Other standard library packages provide stream implementations for other destinations, such as the codice_55 returned by the method or the Java EE class.

Data type handling and processing or filtering of stream data is accomplished through stream filters. The filter classes all accept another compatible stream object as a parameter to the constructor and &quot;decorate&quot; the enclosed stream with additional features. Filters are created by extending one of the base filter classes , , , or .

The codice_57 and codice_58 classes are really just byte streams with additional processing performed on the data stream to convert the bytes to characters. They use the default character encoding for the platform, which as of J2SE 5.0 is represented by the returned by the static method. The class converts an codice_55 to a codice_57 and the class converts an codice_56 to a codice_58. Both these classes have constructors that support specifying the character encoding to use. If no encoding is specified, the program uses the default encoding for the platform.

The following table shows the other processes and filters that the codice_59 package directly supports. All these classes extend the corresponding codice_68 class.

==== Random access ====
The class supports &quot;random access&quot; reading and writing of files. The class uses a &quot;file pointer&quot; that represents a byte-offset within the file for the next read or write operation. The file pointer is moved implicitly by reading or writing and explicitly by calling the or methods. The current position of the file pointer is returned by the method.

==== File system ====
The class represents a file or directory path in a file system. codice_69 objects support the creation, deletion and renaming of files and directories and the manipulation of file attributes such as &quot;read-only&quot; and &quot;last modified timestamp&quot;. codice_69 objects that represent directories can be used to get a list of all the contained files and directories.

The class is a file descriptor that represents a source or sink (destination) of bytes. Typically this is a file, but can also be a console or network socket. codice_71 objects are used to create codice_69 streams. They are obtained from codice_69 streams and codice_74 sockets and datagram sockets.

=== java.nio ===
In J2SE 1.4, the package (NIO or Non-blocking I/O) was added to support memory-mapped I/O, facilitating I/O operations closer to the underlying hardware with sometimes dramatically better performance. The codice_75 package provides support for a number of buffer types. The subpackage provides support for different character encodings for character data. The subpackage provides support for &quot;channels,&quot; which represent connections to entities that are capable of performing I/O operations, such as files and sockets. The codice_76 package also provides support for fine-grained locking of files.

=== java.math ===
The package supports multiprecision arithmetic (including modular arithmetic operations) and provides multiprecision prime number generators used for cryptographic key generation. The main classes of the package are:

* – provides arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers. codice_77 gives the user control over rounding behavior through codice_78.
* – provides arbitrary-precision integers. Operations on codice_79 do not overflow or lose precision. In addition to standard arithmetic operations, it provides modular arithmetic, GCD calculation, primality testing, prime number generation, bit manipulation, and other miscellaneous operations.
* – encapsulate the context settings that describe certain rules for numerical operators.
* – an enumeration that provides eight rounding behaviors.

=== java.net ===
The package provides special IO routines for networks, allowing HTTP requests, as well as other common transactions.

=== java.text ===
The package implements parsing routines for strings and supports various human-readable languages and locale-specific parsing.

=== java.util ===
Data structures that aggregate objects are the focus of the package. Included in the package is the Collections API, an organized data structure hierarchy influenced heavily by the design patterns considerations.

== Special purpose packages ==

=== java.applet ===
Created to support Java applet creation, the package lets applications be downloaded over a network and run within a guarded sandbox. Security restrictions are easily imposed on the sandbox. A developer, for example, may apply a digital signature to an applet, thereby labeling it as safe. Doing so allows the user to grant the applet permission to perform restricted operations (such as accessing the local hard drive), and removes some or all the sandbox restrictions. Digital certificates are issued by certificate authorities.

=== java.beans ===
Included in the package are various classes for developing and manipulating beans, reusable components defined by the JavaBeans architecture. The architecture provides mechanisms for manipulating properties of components and firing events when those properties change.

The APIs in codice_80 are intended for use by a bean editing tool, in which beans can be combined, customized, and manipulated. One type of bean editor is a GUI designer in an integrated development environment.

=== java.awt ===
The , or Abstract Window Toolkit, provides access to a basic set of GUI widgets based on the underlying native platform&#x27;s widget set, the core of the GUI event subsystem, and the interface between the native windowing system and the Java application. It also provides several basic layout managers, a datatransfer package for use with the Clipboard and Drag and Drop, the interface to input devices such as mice and keyboards, as well as access to the system tray on supporting systems. This package, along with codice_81 contains the largest number of enums (7 in all) in JDK 6.

=== java.rmi ===
The package provides Java remote method invocation to support remote procedure calls between two java applications running in different JVMs.

=== java.security ===
Support for security, including the message digest algorithm, is included in the package.

=== java.sql ===
An implementation of the JDBC API (used to access SQL databases) is grouped into the package.

=== javax.rmi ===
The codice_82 package provided support for the remote communication between applications, using the RMI over IIOP protocol. This protocol combines RMI and CORBA features.

Java SE Core Technologies - CORBA / RMI-IIOP

=== javax.swing ===
Swing is a collection of routines that build on codice_83 to provide a platform independent widget toolkit. uses the 2D drawing routines to render the user interface components instead of relying on the underlying native operating system GUI support.

This package contains the largest number of classes (133 in all) in JDK 6. This package, along with codice_83 also contains the largest number of enums (7 in all) in JDK 6. It supports pluggable looks and feels (PLAFs) so that widgets in the GUI can imitate those from the underlying native system. Design patterns permeate the system, especially a modification of the model–view–controller pattern, which loosens the coupling between function and appearance. One inconsistency is that (as of J2SE 1.3) fonts are drawn by the underlying native system, and not by Java, limiting text portability. Workarounds, such as using bitmap fonts, do exist. In general, &quot;layouts&quot; are used and keep elements within an aesthetically consistent GUI across platforms.

=== javax.swing.text.html.parser ===
The package provides the error tolerant HTML parser that is used for writing various web browsers and web bots.

=== javax.xml.bind.annotation ===
The codice_85 package contained the largest number of Annotation Types (30 in all) in JDK 6. It defines annotations for customizing Java program elements to XML Schema mapping.

== OMG packages ==

=== org.omg.CORBA ===
The codice_86 package provided support for the remote communication between applications using the General Inter-ORB Protocol and supports other features of the common object request broker architecture. Same as RMI and RMI-IIOP, this package is for calling remote methods of objects on other virtual machines (usually via network).

This package contained the largest number of codice_87 classes (45 in all) in JDK 6. From all communication possibilities CORBA is portable between various languages; however, with this comes more complexity.

These packages were deprecated in Java 9 and removed from Java 11.

=== org.omg.PortableInterceptor ===
The codice_88 package contained the largest number of interfaces (39 in all) in JDK 6. It provides a mechanism to register ORB hooks through which ORB services intercept the normal flow of execution of the ORB.

<text>Elias Kazantzoglou (, ; September 7, 1909 – September 28, 2003), known as Elia Kazan ( ), was a Greek-American film and theatre director, producer, screenwriter and actor, described by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history&quot;.

Born in Constantinople (now Istanbul) to Cappadocian Greek parents, his family came to the United States in 1913. After attending Williams College and then the Yale School of Drama, he acted professionally for eight years, later joining the Group Theatre in 1932, and co-founded the Actors Studio in 1947. With Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford, his actors&#x27; studio introduced &quot;Method Acting&quot; under the direction of Lee Strasberg. Kazan acted in a few films, including &quot;City for Conquest&quot; (1940).

His films were concerned with personal or social issues of special concern to him. Kazan writes, &quot;I don&#x27;t move unless I have some empathy with the basic theme.&quot; His first such &quot;issue&quot; film was &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947), with Gregory Peck, which dealt with antisemitism in the United States. It received eight Oscar nominations and three wins, including Kazan&#x27;s first for Best Director. It was followed by &quot;Pinky&quot; (1949), one of the first films in mainstream Hollywood to address racial prejudice against African Americans. &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1951), an adaptation of the stage play which he had also directed, received twelve Oscar nominations, winning four, and was Marlon Brando&#x27;s breakthrough role. Three years later, he directed Brando again in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, a film about union corruption on the New York harbor waterfront. It also received twelve Oscar nominations, winning eight. In 1955, he directed John Steinbeck&#x27;s &quot;East of Eden&quot;, starring James Dean.

A turning point in Kazan&#x27;s career came with his testimony as a &quot;friendly witness&quot; before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 at the height of the Hollywood blacklist. His decision to cooperate and name names brought him strong negative reactions from many friends and associates. His harshly anti-communist testimony &quot;damaged if not shattered the careers of his former colleagues, Morris Carnovsky and Art Smith, both actors, and the playwright Clifford Odets&quot;. In his memoirs, Kazan writes that he and Odets had made a pact at the time to name each other in front of the committee. Kazan later justified his actions by saying he took &quot;only the more tolerable of two alternatives that were either way painful and wrong&quot;. Nearly a half-century later, his 1952 HUAC testimony continued to cause controversy. When Kazan was awarded an honorary Oscar in 1999, dozens of actors chose not to applaud as 250 demonstrators picketed the event.

Kazan influenced the films of the 1950s and 1960s with his provocative, issue-driven subjects. Director Stanley Kubrick called him &quot;without question, the best director we have in America, [and] capable of performing miracles with the actors he uses&quot;. Film author Ian Freer concludes that even &quot;if his achievements are tainted by political controversy, the debt Hollywood—and actors everywhere—owes him is enormous&quot;. Orson Welles said &quot;Kazan is a traitor ... [but] he is a very good director&quot;. In 2010, Martin Scorsese co-directed the documentary film &quot;A Letter to Elia&quot; as a personal tribute to Kazan.

==Early life==
Kazan was born in the Kadıköy district of Constantinople (now Istanbul), to Cappadocian Greek parents, originally from Kayseri in Anatolia. He arrived in the United States with his parents, Athena () and George Kazantzoglou, on July 8, 1913. He was named after his paternal grandfather, Elia Kazantzoglou. His maternal grandfather was Isaak Shishmanoglou. Elia&#x27;s brother, Avraam, was born in Berlin and later became a psychiatrist.

Kazan was raised in the Greek Orthodox Church and attended Greek Orthodox services every Sunday, where he had to stand for several hours with his father. His mother read the Bible but did not go to church. When Kazan was about eight years old, the family moved to New Rochelle, New York, and his father sent him to a Catholic catechism school because there was no Orthodox church nearby.
As a young boy, he was remembered as being shy, and his college classmates characterized him as more of a loner. Much of his early life was portrayed in his autobiographical book, &quot;America America&quot;, which he made into a 1963 film. In it, he describes his family as &quot;alienated&quot; from both their parents&#x27; Greek Orthodox values and from those of &quot;mainstream America&quot;. His mother&#x27;s family were cotton merchants who imported cotton from England and sold it wholesale. His father had become a rug merchant after immigrating to the United States, and he expected his son would someday take over the family business.

After attending public schools through high school, Kazan enrolled at Williams College in Massachusetts, where he helped pay his way by waiting tables and washing dishes; he still graduated &quot;cum laude&quot;. He also worked as a bartender at various fraternities but never joined one. While a student at Williams, he earned the nickname &quot;Gadg&quot; (for Gadget) because, he said, &quot;I was small, compact, and handy to have around.&quot; The nickname was eventually taken up by his stage and film stars. In &quot;America America&quot;, Kazan tells how and why his family left Turkey and moved to the United States. Kazan observes that much of it came from stories that he heard as a young boy. He says during an interview that &quot;it&#x27;s all true: the wealth of the family was put on the back of a donkey, and my uncle, really still a boy, went to Istanbul ... to gradually bring the family there to escape the oppressive circumstances. ... It&#x27;s also true that he lost the money on the way, and when he got there he swept rugs in a little store.&quot;

Kazan noted some of the controversial aspects of what he put in the film: &quot;I used to say to myself when I was making the film that America was a dream of total freedom in all areas.&quot; To make his point, the character who portrays Kazan&#x27;s uncle Avraam kisses the ground when he gets through customs, while the Statue of Liberty and the American flag are in the background. Kazan had considered whether that kind of scene might be too much for American audiences:
Before undertaking &quot;America America&quot;, Kazan wanted to confirm many of the details about his family&#x27;s background. At one point, he sat his parents down and recorded their answers to his questions. He remembers eventually asking his father a &quot;deeper question: &#x27;Why America? What were you hoping for? His mother gave him the answer: &quot;A.E. brought us here.&quot; Kazan states that &quot;A.E. was my uncle Avraam Elia, the one who left the Anatolian village with the donkey. At twenty-eight, somehow—this was the wonder—he made his way to New York. He sent home money and in time brought my father over. Father sent for my mother and my baby brother and me when I was four.&quot; Kazan writes of &quot;America America&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s my favorite of all the films I&#x27;ve made; the first film that was entirely mine.&quot;

== Career ==
=== 1930s: Stage career ===
In 1932, after spending two years at the Yale University School of Drama, he moved to New York City to become a professional stage actor. He continued his professional studies at the Juilliard School where he studied singing with Lucia Dunham. His first opportunity came with a small group of actors engaged in presenting plays containing &quot;social commentary&quot;. They were called the Group Theatre, which showcased many lesser known plays with deep social or political messages. After struggling to be accepted by them, he discovered his first strong sense of self in America within the &quot;family of the Group Theatre, and more loosely in the radical social and cultural movements of the time&quot;, writes film author Joanna E. Rapf.

In his autobiography, Kazan writes of the &quot;lasting impact on him of the Group&quot;, noting in particular Lee Strasberg and Harold Clurman as &quot;father figures&quot;, along with his close friendship with playwright Clifford Odets. During an interview with Michel Ciment, Kazan described the Group:

Kazan also praised Strasberg as a vital leader of the Group:

Kazan&#x27;s first national success came as a New York theatrical director. Although initially he worked as an actor on stage, and told early in his acting career that he had no acting ability, he surprised many critics by becoming one of the Group&#x27;s most capable actors. In 1935 he played the role of a strike-leading taxi driver in a drama by Clifford Odets, &quot;Waiting for Lefty&quot;, and his performance was called &quot;dynamic&quot;, leading some to label him the &quot;proletarian thunderbolt&quot;. Among the themes that would run through all of his work were &quot;personal alienation and an outrage over social injustice&quot;, writes film critic William Baer. Other critics have likewise noted his &quot;strong commitment to the social and social psychological—rather than the purely political—implications of drama&quot;.

By the mid-1930s, when he was 26, Kazan began directing a number of the Group Theatre&#x27;s plays, including Robert Ardrey&#x27;s well-known play &quot;Thunder Rock&quot;. In 1942 he achieved his first notable success by directing a play by Thornton Wilder, &quot;The Skin of Our Teeth&quot;, starring Tallulah Bankhead and Fredric March. The play, though controversial, was a critical and commercial success and won Wilder a Pulitzer Prize. Kazan won the New York Drama Critics Award for Best Director and Bankhead for best actress. Kazan then went on to direct &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; by Arthur Miller, and then directed &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; by Tennessee Williams, both of which were also successful. Kazan&#x27;s wife, Molly Thacher, the reader for the Group, discovered Williams and awarded him a &quot;prize that launched his career&quot;.

The Group Theatre&#x27;s summer rehearsal headquarters was at Pine Brook Country Club, located in the countryside of Nichols, Connecticut, during the 1930s and early 1940s. Along with Kazan were numerous other artists, including Harry Morgan, John Garfield, Luise Rainer, Frances Farmer, Will Geer, Howard da Silva, Clifford Odets, Lee J. Cobb, and Irwin Shaw.

=== 1940s: The Actors Studio, early films ===
In 1940, Kazan had a large supporting role as a flamboyantly dressed gangster in the boxing thriller &quot;City for Conquest&quot; starring James Cagney, Ann Sheridan and Anthony Quinn. His stylishly distinctive but raffish clothing seems to have been copied by Frank Sinatra a decade and a half later and his part is both sympathetic and extremely dramatic. In 1947, he founded the Actors Studio, a non-profit workshop, with actors Robert Lewis and Cheryl Crawford. In 1951, Lee Strasberg became its director after Kazan left for Hollywood to focus on his career as a movie director. It remained a non-profit enterprise. Strasberg introduced the &quot;Method&quot; to the Actors Studio, an umbrella term for a constellation of systemizations of Konstantin Stanislavski&#x27;s teachings. The &quot;Method&quot; school of acting became the predominant system of post-World War II Hollywood.

Among Strasberg&#x27;s students were Montgomery Clift, Mildred Dunnock, Julie Harris, Karl Malden, Patricia Neal, Maureen Stapleton, Eli Wallach, and James Whitmore. Kazan directed two of the Studio&#x27;s protégés, Karl Malden and Marlon Brando, in the Tennessee Williams play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Although he was at the height of his stage success, Kazan turned to Hollywood as a director of motion pictures. He first directed two short films but his first feature film was &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1945), one of his first attempts to film dramas focused on contemporary concerns, which later became his forte. Two years later he directed &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot;, where he tackled a seldom-discussed topic in the United States, antisemitism, for which he won his first Oscar as Best Director. In 1947, he directed the courtroom drama &quot;Boomerang!&quot; In 1949, he again dealt with a controversial subject when he directed &quot;Pinky&quot;, which dealt with issues of racism in the United States, and was nominated for three Academy Awards.

=== 1950s: Rise to prominence ===
In 1950, Kazan directed &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot;, starring Richard Widmark, a thriller shot on the streets of New Orleans. In that film, Kazan experimented with a documentary style of cinematography, which succeeded in &quot;energizing&quot; the action scenes. He won the Venice Film Festival International Award as director, and the film also won two Academy Awards. Kazan had requested that Zero Mostel also act in the film, despite Mostel being &quot;blacklisted&quot; as a result of HUAC testimony a few years earlier. Kazan writes of his decision:
In 1951, after introducing and directing Marlon Brando and Karl Malden in the stage version, he went on to cast both in the film version of the play, &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, which won four Oscars and was nominated for twelve. Despite these plaudits, the film was considered a step back cinematically with the feel of filmed theater; though Kazan did at first use a more open setting, he then felt compelled to revert to the stage atmosphere to remain true to the script. He explains:

Kazan&#x27;s next film was &quot;Viva Zapata!&quot; (1952) which also starred Marlon Brando. This time the film added real atmosphere with the use of location shots and strong character accents. Kazan called this his &quot;first real film&quot; because of those factors. In 1954, he again used Brando as a star in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;. As a continuation of the socially relevant themes that he developed in New York, the film exposed corruption within New York&#x27;s longshoremen&#x27;s union. It too was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, and won eight, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Marlon Brando. &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; was also the screen debut for Eva Marie Saint, who won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her role. Saint recalls that Kazan selected her for the role after he had her do an improvisational skit with Brando playing the other character. She had no idea that he was looking to fill any particular film part, however, but remembers that Kazan set up the scenario with Brando which brought out surprising emotions:

&quot;Life&quot; magazine described &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; as the &quot;most brutal movie of the year&quot; but with &quot;the year&#x27;s tenderest love scenes&quot;, and stating that Saint was a &quot;new discovery&quot; in films. In its cover story about Saint, it speculated that it will probably be as Edie in &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; that she &quot;starts her real trip to fame&quot;.

The film made use of extensive on-location street scenes and waterfront shots, and included a notable score by noted composer Leonard Bernstein.

After the success of &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, he went on to direct another screen adaptation of a John Steinbeck novel, &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955). As director, Kazan again used another unknown actor, James Dean. Kazan had seen Dean on stage in New York and after an audition gave him the starring role along with an exclusive contract with Warner Bros. Dean flew back to Los Angeles with Kazan in 1954, the first time he had ever flown in a plane, bringing his clothes in a brown paper bag. The film&#x27;s success introduced James Dean to the world and established him as a popular actor. He went on to star in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot; (1955), directed by Kazan&#x27;s friend Nicholas Ray, and then &quot;Giant&quot; (1956), directed by George Stevens.

Author Douglas Rathgeb recounts the difficulties Kazan had in turning Dean into a new star, noting how Dean was a controversial figure at Warner Bros. from the time he arrived. There were rumors that he &quot;kept a loaded gun in his studio trailer; that he drove his motorcycle dangerously down studio streets or sound stages; that he had bizarre and unsavory friends.&quot; As a result, Kazan was forced to &quot;baby-sit the young actor in side-by-side trailers&quot;, so he would not run away during production. Co-star Julie Harris worked overtime to quell Dean&#x27;s panic attacks. In general, Dean was oblivious to Hollywood&#x27;s methods, and Rathgeb notes that &quot;his radical style did not mesh with Hollywood&#x27;s corporate gears&quot;.

Dean was amazed at his own performance on screen when he later viewed a rough cut of the film. Kazan had invited director Nicholas Ray to a private showing, with Dean, as Ray was looking for someone to play the lead in &quot;Rebel Without a Cause&quot;. Ray watched Dean&#x27;s powerful acting on the screen; but it seemed impossible that it was the same person in the room. Ray felt Dean was shy and totally withdrawn as he sat there hunched over. &quot;Dean himself did not seem to believe it&quot;, notes Rathgeb. &quot;He watched himself with an odd, almost adolescent fascination, as if he were admiring someone else.&quot; The film also made good use of on-location and outdoor scenes, along with effective use of early widescreen format, making the film one of Kazan&#x27;s most accomplished works. James Dean died the following year, at the age of 24, in an accident with his sports car about 200 miles north of Los Angeles. He had only made three films, and the only completed film he ever saw was &quot;East of Eden&quot;.

=== 1960s: Continued work ===
In 1961, Kazan introduced Warren Beatty in his first screen appearance with a starring role in &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot; (1961), with Natalie Wood; the film was nominated for two Oscars and won one. Author Peter Biskind points out that Kazan &quot;was the first in a string of major directors Beatty sought out, mentors or father figures from whom he wanted to learn.&quot; Biskind notes also that they &quot;were wildly dissimilar—mentor vs. protégé, director vs. actor, immigrant outsider vs. native son. Kazan was armed with the confidence born of age and success, while Beatty was virtually aflame with the arrogance of youth.&quot; Kazan later recorded his impressions of Beatty:

Biskind describes an episode during the first week of shooting, where Beatty was angered at something Kazan said: &quot;The star lashed out at the spot where he knew Kazan was most vulnerable, the director&#x27;s friendly testimony before the HCUA. He snapped, &#x27;Lemme ask you something—why did you name all those names?

Beatty recalled the episode: &quot;In some patricidal attempt to stand up to the great Kazan, I arrogantly and stupidly challenged him on it.&quot; Biskind relates how &quot;Kazan grabbed his arm, asking, &#x27;What did you say?&#x27; and dragged him off to a tiny dressing room... whereupon the director proceeded to justify himself for two hours.&quot; Beatty, years later, during a Kennedy Center tribute to Kazan, stated to the audience that Kazan &quot;had given him the most important break in his career&quot;.

Beatty&#x27;s costar, Natalie Wood, was in a transition period in her career, having mostly been cast in roles as a child or teenager, and she was now hoping to be cast in adult roles. Biographer Suzanne Finstad notes that a &quot;turning point&quot; in her life as an actress was upon seeing the film &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;: &quot;She was transformed, in awe of Kazan and of Vivien Leigh&#x27;s performance... [who] became a role model for Natalie.&quot; In 1961, after a &quot;series of bad films, her career was already in decline&quot;, notes Rathgeb. Kazan writes that the &quot;sages&quot; of the film community declared her as &quot;washed up&quot; as an actress, although he still wanted to interview her for his next film:

Kazan cast her as the female lead in &quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;, and her career rebounded. Finstad feels that despite Wood never receiving training in Method acting techniques, &quot;working with Kazan brought her to the greatest emotional heights of her career. The experience was exhilarating but wrenching for Natalie, who faced her demons on &quot;Splendor&quot;.&quot; She adds that a scene in the film, as a result of &quot;Kazan&#x27;s wizardry... produced a hysteria in Natalie that may be her most powerful moment as an actress.&quot;

Actor Gary Lockwood, who also acted in the film, felt that &quot;Kazan and Natalie were a terrific marriage, because you had this beautiful girl, and you had somebody that could get things out of her.&quot; Kazan&#x27;s favorite scene in the movie was the last one, when Wood goes back to see her lost first love, Bud (Beatty). Kazan recalled: &quot;It&#x27;s terribly touching to me. I still like it when I see it. And I certainly didn&#x27;t need to tell her how to play it. She understood it perfectly.&quot; 

== Collaborators ==
Kazan was noted for his close collaboration with screenwriters. On Broadway, he worked with Arthur Miller, Tennessee Williams, and William Inge; in film, he worked again with Willams (&quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; and &quot;Baby Doll&quot;), Inge (&quot;Splendor in the Grass&quot;), Budd Schulberg (&quot;On the Waterfront&quot; and &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot;), John Steinbeck (&quot;Viva Zapata!&quot;), and Harold Pinter (&quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;). As an instrumental figure in the careers of many of the best writers of his time, &quot;he always treated them and their work with the utmost respect.&quot; In 2009, a previously unproduced screenplay by Williams, &quot;The Loss of a Teardrop Diamond&quot;, was released as a film. Williams wrote the screenplay specifically for Kazan to direct during the 1950s.

Among Kazan&#x27;s other films were &quot;Panic in the Streets&quot; (1950), &quot;East of Eden&quot; (1955), &quot;Baby Doll&quot; (1956), &quot;Wild River&quot; (1960), and &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; (1976). Williams became one of Kazan&#x27;s closest and most loyal friends, and Kazan often pulled Williams out of &quot;creative slumps&quot; by redirecting his focus with new ideas. In 1959, in a letter to Kazan, he writes, &quot;Some day you will know how much I value the great things you did with my work, how you lifted it above its measure by your great gift.&quot;

==Directing style==

===Preference for unknown actors===
Kazan strove for &quot;cinematic realism&quot;, a quality he often achieved by discovering and working with unknown actors, many of whom treated him as their mentor, which gave him the flexibility to depict &quot;social reality with both accuracy and vivid intensity&quot;. He also felt that casting the right actors accounted for 90% of a movie&#x27;s ultimate success or failure. As a result of his efforts, he also gave actors such as Lee Remick, Jo Van Fleet, Warren Beatty, Andy Griffith, Eva Marie Saint,James Dean and Jack Palance their first major movie roles. He explained to director and producer George Stevens Jr. that he felt that &quot;big stars are barely trained or not very well trained. They also have bad habits... they&#x27;re not pliable anymore.&quot; Kazan also describes how and why he gets to know his actors on a personal level:

As an example, Kazan recalled during an interview how he came to understand James Dean:

===Topics of personal and social realism===
Kazan chose his subjects to express personal and social events that he was familiar with. He described his thought process before taking on a project:


Film historian Joanna E. Rapf notes that among the methods Kazan used in his work with actors, was his initial focus on &quot;reality&quot;, although his style was not defined as &quot;naturalistic&quot;. She adds: &quot;He respects his script, but casts and directs with a particular eye for expressive action and the use of emblematic objects.&quot; Kazan stated that &quot;unless the character is somewhere in the actor himself, you shouldn&#x27;t cast him.&quot; In his later years, he changed his mind about some of the philosophy behind the Group Theatre, in that he no longer felt that the theater was a &quot;collective art&quot;, as he once believed:

Film author Peter Biskind described Kazan&#x27;s career as &quot;fully committed to art and politics, with the politics feeding the work&quot;. Kazan, however, has downplayed that impression:

Nonetheless, there have been clear messages in some of his films that involved politics in various ways. In 1954, he directed &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, written by screenwriter Budd Schulberg, which was a film about union corruption in New York. Some critics consider it &quot;one of the greatest films in the history of international cinema&quot;. Another political film was &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957). His protagonist, played by Andy Griffith (in his film debut) is not a politician, yet his career suddenly becomes deeply involved in politics. According to film author Harry Keyishian, Kazan and screenwriter Budd Schulberg were using the film to warn audiences about the dangerous potential of the new medium of television. Kazan explains that he and Schulberg were trying to warn &quot;of the power TV would have in the political life of the nation&quot;. Kazan states, &quot;Listen to what the candidate says; don&#x27;t be taken in by his charm or his trust-inspiring personality. Don&#x27;t buy the advertisement; buy what&#x27;s in the package.&quot;

===Use of “method” acting===

As a product of the Group Theatre and Actors Studio, he was most noted for his use of &quot;Method&quot; actors, especially Brando and Dean. During an interview in 1988, Kazan said, &quot;I did whatever was necessary to get a good performance &quot;including&quot; so-called Method acting. I made them run around the set, I scolded them, I inspired jealousy in their girlfriends... The director is a &quot;desperate beast!&quot;... You don&#x27;t deal with actors as dolls. You deal with them as people who are poets to a certain degree.&quot; Actor Robert De Niro called him a &quot;master of a new kind of psychological and behavioral faith in acting&quot;. Kazan was aware of the limited range of his directing abilities:

Kazan explained that he tried to inspire his actors to offer ideas:

Kazan held strong ideas about the scenes and would try to merge an actor&#x27;s suggestions and inner feelings with his own. Despite the strong eroticism created in &quot;Baby Doll&quot;, for example, he set limits. Before shooting a seduction scene between Eli Wallach and Carroll Baker, he privately asked Wallach, &quot;Do you think you actually go through with seducing that girl?&quot; Wallach writes, &quot;I hadn&#x27;t thought about that question before, but I answered... &#x27;No&#x27;.&quot; Kazan replies, &quot;Good idea, play it that way.&quot; Kazan, many years later, explained his rationale for scenes in that film:

===Being an “actor&#x27;s director”===

Joanna Rapf adds that Kazan was most admired for his close work with actors, noting that director Nicholas Ray considered him &quot;the best actor&#x27;s director the United States has ever produced&quot;. Film historian Foster Hirsch explains that &quot;he created virtually a new acting style, which was the style of the Method... [that] allowed for the actors to create great depth of psychological realism&quot;.

Among the actors who described Kazan as an important influence in their career was Patricia Neal, who co-starred with Andy Griffith in &quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; (1957): &quot;He was very good. He was an actor and he knew how we acted. He would come and talk to you privately. I liked him a lot.&quot; Anthony Franciosa, a supporting actor in the film, explains how Kazan encouraged his actors:

In order to get quality acting from Andy Griffith, in his first screen appearance, and achieve what Schickel calls &quot;an astonishing movie debut&quot;, Kazan would often take surprising measures. In one important and highly emotional scene, for example, Kazan had to give Griffith fair warning: &quot;I may have to use extraordinary means to make you do this. I may have to get out of line. I don&#x27;t know any other way of getting an extraordinary performance out of an actor.&quot; Actress Terry Moore calls Kazan her &quot;best friend&quot;, and notes that &quot;he made you feel better than you thought you could be. I never had another director that ever touched him. I was spoiled for life&quot;. &quot;He would find out if your life was like the character&quot;, says Carroll Baker, star of &quot;Baby Doll&quot;; &quot;he was the best director with actors&quot;.

Kazan&#x27;s need to remain close to his actors continued up to his last film, &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot; (1976). He remembered that Robert De Niro, the star of the film, &quot;would do almost anything to succeed&quot;, and even cut his weight down from 170 to 128 pounds for the role. Kazan adds that De Niro &quot;is one of a select number of actors I&#x27;ve directed who work hard at their trade, and the only one who asked to rehearse on Sundays. Most of the others play tennis. Bobby and I would go over the scenes to be shot.&quot;

The powerful dramatic roles Kazan brought out from many of his actors was due, partly, to his ability to recognize their personal traits. Although he did not know De Niro before this film, for example, Kazan later writes, &quot;Bobby is more meticulous... he&#x27;s very imaginative. He&#x27;s very precise. He figures everything out both inside and outside. He has good emotion. He&#x27;s a character actor: everything he does he calculates. In a good way, but he calculates.&quot; Kazan developed and used those personality traits for his character in the film. Although the film did poorly at the box office, some reviewers praised De Niro&#x27;s acting. Film critic Marie Brenner writes that &quot;for De Niro, it is a role that surpasses even his brilliant and daring portrayal of Vito Corleone in &quot;The Godfather, part II&quot;... [his] performance deserves to be compared with the very finest&quot;. Marlon Brando, in his autobiography, goes into detail about the influence Kazan had on his acting:

==HUAC testimony==

Kazan testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) in 1952 during the midst of the Red Scare that journalist Michael Mills calls &quot;arguably the most controversial period in Hollywood history&quot;. When Kazan was in his mid-20s in the Depression years 1934 to 1936, he had been a member of the Communist Party USA.

In April 1952, the HUAC called on Kazan, under oath, to identify Communists from that period 16 years earlier. Kazan initially refused to provide names, but eventually named eight former Group Theatre members who he said had been Communists: Clifford Odets, J. Edward Bromberg, Lewis Leverett, Morris Carnovsky, Phoebe Brand, Tony Kraber, Ted Wellman, and Paula Miller (who later married Lee Strasberg). He testified that Odets quit the party at the same time he did. Kazan alleged that all the persons named were already known to the HUAC, although this has been contested. He later acknowledged that he received a letter detailing how his naming of Art Smith damaged the actor&#x27;s career. Kazan&#x27;s naming names cost him many friends within the film industry, including playwright Arthur Miller, although Kazan notes the two did work together again.

In his book &quot;How We Forgot the Cold War&quot; (2012), historian Jon Wiener wrote: &quot;Lots of people named names, but Kazan went further than any of them, when, two days later [after his April 1952 testimony], he took out an ad in the &quot;New York Times&quot; explaining his reasons for naming names and urging others to follow his example.&quot; In his large, defiant ad entitled &quot;A STATEMENT by Elia Kazan&quot;, the director briefly chronicled his 1934–36 experiences in the Communist Party, and then he wrote: Kazan added that his time in the Party &quot;left me with the passionate conviction that we must never let the Communists get away with the pretense that they stand for the very things which they kill in their own countries.&quot; Decades later in his memoirs, he still struck a defiant tone when describing his &quot;warrior pleasure at withstanding his &#x27;enemies,&#x27; who judged him for giving names to the HUAC&quot;. He also insisted that despite the snubs he received, he felt no lingering guilt: &quot;There&#x27;s a normal sadness about hurting people, but I&#x27;d rather hurt them a little than hurt myself a lot.&quot;

When Kazan received an Honorary Academy Award in 1999, the audience was noticeably divided in their reaction, with some, including Nick Nolte, Ed Harris, Ian McKellen, Frank Langella and Amy Madigan, refusing to applaud, and others, such as actors Kathy Bates, Meryl Streep, Karl Malden, Debbie Allen, and Warren Beatty, and producer George Stevens Jr., standing and applauding. Stevens speculates on why he, Beatty, and many others in the audience chose to stand and applaud:

In an interview for the Associated Press, actor Liam Neeson said: &quot;We &quot;are&quot; honoring an extraordinary artist. Period. That&#x27;s what this evening&#x27;s about.&quot; Director Martin Scorsese and actor Robert De Niro presented the award to Kazan, whom he thanked in his acceptance speech. He ended by saying: &quot;I want to thank you all very much. I think I can just slip away.&quot;

In 1982, Orson Welles was asked a question about Kazan at the Cinémathèque française in Paris. Welles replied, &quot;Chère mademoiselle, you have chosen the wrong metteur en scène, because Elia Kazan is a traitor. He is a man who sold to McCarthy all his companions at a time when he could continue to work in New York at high salary, and having sold all his people to McCarthy, he then made a film called &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; which was a celebration of the informer.&quot; While the audience applauded, Welles said, &quot;I have to add that he is a very good director.&quot;

&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; film critic Kenneth Turan wrote, &quot;The only criterion for an award like this is the work.&quot; Kazan was already &quot;denied accolades&quot; from the American Film Institute, and other film critics&#x27; associations. According to Mills, &quot;It&#x27;s time for the Academy to recognize this genius&quot;, adding that &quot;We applauded when the great Chaplin finally had his hour.&quot; In response, Joseph McBride, former vice president of the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, claimed that an honorary award recognizes &quot;the totality of what he represents, and Kazan&#x27;s career, post 1952, was built on the ruin of other people&#x27;s careers.&quot; In subsequent interviews, Kazan explained some of the early events that made him decide to become a friendly witness, most notably in relation to the Group Theatre, which he called his first &quot;family&quot;, and the &quot;best thing professionally&quot; that ever happened to him:

Mills observes that prior to becoming a &quot;friendly witness&quot;, Kazan discussed his decision-making process during a visit at his Connecticut home from longtime friend Arthur Miller:
Miller put his arm around Kazan and said, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about what I&#x27;ll think. Whatever you do is okay with me, because I know that your heart is in the right place.&quot; Miller had recorded in his journal his own perceptions about this visit. He recalled his sentiments as &quot;being more complex. His anger was not at Kazan, whom he loved like a brother, but at the committee. At the same time he saw a side to his friend that frightened him: &#x27;He would have sacrificed me as well.&#x27;&quot;

In his memoirs, Kazan writes that, as a result of his testimony, &quot;the big shot had become the outsider&quot;. He also says that it strengthened his friendship with another outsider, Tennessee Williams, with whom he collaborated on numerous plays and films. He called Williams &quot;the most loyal and understanding friend I had through those black months.&quot; Kazan appears as a character in &quot;Names&quot;, Mark Kemble&#x27;s play about former Group Theatre members&#x27; struggles with the House Un-American Activities Committee.

==Personal life and death==
Kazan was married three times. His first wife was playwright Molly Day Thacher. They were married from 1932 until her death in 1963; this marriage produced two daughters and two sons, including screenwriter Nicholas Kazan. Molly became an especially bitter anti-communist. Film critic Leo Braudy contends that it was Molly who was the principal author of the April 1952 &quot;New York Times&quot; ad that further estranged Kazan from the Hollywood community.

His second marriage, to the actress Barbara Loden, lasted from 1967 until her death in 1980, and produced one son. His marriage, in 1982, to Frances Rudge continued until his death in 2003. In the early 1930s, Kazan and Molly moved into an 1885 farmhouse in Sandy Hook, Connecticut, where they raised their four children. The family continued to use the property as a summer and weekend retreat until 1998 when the property was put up for sale. In 1978, the U.S. government paid for Kazan and his family to travel to his birthplace where many of his films were to be shown. During a speech in Athens, he discussed his films and his personal and business life in the U.S., along with the messages he tried to convey:

Kazan also offered his opinions about the role of the U.S. as a world model for democracy:

Kazan died from natural causes in his Manhattan apartment on September 28, 2003, aged 94. 

== Sexual assault allegation ==
In 2017, Carol Drinkwater accused Kazan of sexual harassment and attempted rape in 1975 when she was under consideration for a part in Kazan&#x27;s film &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;.

=== Directed Academy Award Performances ===
==Legacy==

Kazan became known as an &quot;actor&#x27;s director&quot; because he was able to elicit some of the best performances in the careers of many of his stars. Under his direction, his actors received 24 Academy Award nominations and won nine Oscars. He won as Best Director for &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Agreement&quot; (1947) and for &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; (1954). Both &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1951) and &quot;On the Waterfront&quot; were nominated for twelve Academy Awards, respectively winning four and eight. With his many years with the Group Theatre and Actors Studio in New York City and later triumphs on Broadway, he became famous &quot;for the power and intensity of his actors&#x27; performances&quot;. He was the pivotal figure in launching the film careers of Marlon Brando, James Dean, Julie Harris, Eli Wallach, Eva Marie Saint, Warren Beatty, Lee Remick, Karl Malden, and many others. Seven of Kazan&#x27;s films won a total of 20 Academy Awards. Dustin Hoffman commented that he &quot;doubted whether he, Robert De Niro, or Al Pacino, would have become actors without Mr. Kazan&#x27;s influence.&quot;

Upon his death, at the age of 94, &quot;The New York Times&quot; characterized him as &quot;one of the most honored and influential directors in Broadway and Hollywood history&quot;. &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot; and &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;, two plays he directed, are considered to be some of the greatest of the 20th century. Although he became a respected director on Broadway, he made an equally impressive transition into one of the major film directors of his time. Critic William Baer notes that throughout his career &quot;he constantly rose to the challenge of his own aspirations&quot;, adding that &quot;he was a pioneer and visionary who greatly affected the history of both stage and cinema&quot;. Certain of his film-related material and personal papers are contained in the Wesleyan University Cinema Archives to which scholars and media experts from around the world may have full access.

His controversial appearance before the House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952 was the low point in his career, although he remained convinced he made the right decision to give the names of Group Theatre colleagues who had been Communist Party members. He stated in an interview in 1976 that &quot;I would rather do what I did than crawl in front of a ritualistic Left and lie the way those other comrades did, and betray my own soul. I didn&#x27;t betray it. I made a difficult decision.&quot;

During his career, Kazan won both Tony and Oscar Awards for directing on stage and screen. In 1982, President Ronald Reagan presented him with the Kennedy Center honors award, a national tribute for lifetime achievement in the arts. At the ceremony, screenwriter Budd Schulberg, who wrote &quot;On the Waterfront&quot;, thanked his lifelong friend saying, &quot;Elia Kazan has touched us all with his capacity to honor not only the heroic man, but the hero in every man.&quot;

In 1999, at the 71st Academy Awards, Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro presented the Honorary Oscar to Kazan. This would be a controversial pick for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences due to Kazan&#x27;s history regarding his involvement with the Hollywood Blacklist in the 1950s. Several members of the audience including Nick Nolte and Ed Harris refused to applaud Kazan when he received the award while others such as Warren Beatty, Meryl Streep, Kathy Bates, and Kurt Russell gave him a standing ovation.

Martin Scorsese directed a film documentary, &quot;A Letter to Elia&quot; (2010), considered to be an &quot;intensely personal and deeply moving tribute&quot; to Kazan. Scorsese was &quot;captivated&quot; by Kazan&#x27;s films as a young man, and the documentary mirrors his own life story while he also credits Kazan as the inspiration for his becoming a filmmaker. It won a Peabody Award in 2010.

<doc id="42877" wikidata="Q3269245" url="?curid=42877" title="Ninety–ninety rule">
<text>In computer programming and software engineering, the ninety-ninety rule is a humorous aphorism that states:

This adds up to 180%, making a wry allusion to the notoriety of software development projects significantly over-running their schedules (see software development effort estimation). The anecdote expresses both the rough allocation of time to easy and hard portions of a programming undertaking, and the cause of the lateness of many projects in their failure to anticipate their difficult, often unpredictable, complexities. In short, it often takes both more time and more coding than expected to complete a project.

The rule is attributed to Tom Cargill of Bell Labs, and was made popular by Jon Bentley&#x27;s September 1985 &quot;Programming Pearls&quot; column in &quot;Communications of the ACM&quot;, in which it was titled the &quot;Rule of Credibility&quot;.

In some agile software projects, this rule also surfaces when a task is portrayed as &quot;relatively done.&quot; This indicates a common scenario where planned work is completed but cannot be signed off, pending a single final activity which may not occur for a substantial amount of time.

<text>Nevil Maskelyne (; 6 October 1732 – 9 February 1811) was the fifth British Astronomer Royal. He held the office from 1765 to 1811. He was the first person to scientifically measure the mass of the planet Earth. He created &quot;The Nautical Almanac&quot;, in full the &quot;British Nautical Almanac and Astronomical Ephemeris for the Meridian of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich&quot; using Tobias Mayer&#x27;s corrections for Euler&#x27;s &quot;Lunar Theory&quot; tables.

==Biography==
Maskelyne was born in London, the third son of Edmund Maskelyne of Purton in Wiltshire, and his wife, Elizabeth Booth. Maskelyne&#x27;s father died when he was 12, leaving the family in reduced circumstances. Maskelyne attended Westminster School and was still a pupil there when his mother died in 1748. His interest in astronomy had begun while at Westminster School, shortly after the eclipse of 14 July 1748.

Maskelyne entered St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1749, graduating as seventh wrangler in 1754. Ordained as a minister in 1755, he became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge in 1756 and a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1758. Maskelyne became a member of the American Philosophical Society, elected in 1771.

Originally pursuing his career as a Church of England minister, he was Rector of Shrawardine in Shropshire from 1775 to 1782 and then Rector of North Runcton in Norfolk from 1782. In 1784 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were John Playfair, John Robison and Dugald Stewart. 
On 21 August 1784 Maskelyne married Sophia Rose, then of St Andrew Holborn, Middlesex. Their only child, Margaret (25 June 1785–1858), was the mother of Mervyn Herbert Nevil Story-Maskelyne (1823–1911) professor of mineralogy at Oxford (1856–95). Maskelyne&#x27;s younger sister, Margaret, married Robert Clive.

Maskelyne is buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin, the parish church of the village of Purton, Wiltshire, England.

==Career==

===Measurement of longitude===
In 1760 the Royal Society appointed Maskelyne as an astronomer on one of their expeditions to observe the 1761 transit of Venus. He and Robert Waddington were sent to the island of Saint Helena in the South Atlantic. This was an important observation since accurate measurements would allow the accurate calculation of Earth&#x27;s distance from the Sun, which would in turn allow the actual rather than the relative scale of the Solar System to be calculated. This would allow, it was argued, the production of more accurate astronomical tables, in particular those predicting the motion of the Moon.

Bad weather prevented observation of the transit, but Maskelyne used his journey to trial a method of determining longitude using the position of the moon, which became known as the lunar distance method. He returned to England, resuming his position as curate at Chipping Barnet in 1761, and began work on a book, publishing the lunar-distance method of longitude calculation and providing tables to facilitate its use in 1763 in &quot;The British Mariner&#x27;s Guide&quot;, which included the suggestion that to facilitate the finding of longitude at sea, lunar distances should be calculated beforehand for each year and published in a form accessible to navigators.

In 1763 the Board of Longitude sent Maskelyne to Barbados in order to carry out an official trial of three contenders for a Longitude reward. He was to carry out observations on board ship and to calculate the longitude of the capital, Bridgetown by observation of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites. The three methods on trial were John Harrison&#x27;s sea watch (now known as H4), Tobias Mayer&#x27;s lunar tables and a marine chair made by Christopher Irwin, intended to help observations of Jupiter&#x27;s satellites on board ship. Both Harrison&#x27;s watch and lunar-distance observations based on Mayer&#x27;s lunar tables produced results within the terms of the Longitude Act, although the former appeared to be more accurate. Harrison&#x27;s watch had produced Bridgetown&#x27;s longitude with an error of less than ten miles, while the lunar-distance observations were accurate to within 30 nautical miles.

Maskelyne reported the results of the trial to the Board of Longitude on 9 February 1765. On 26 February 1765 he had been appointed Astronomer Royal following the unexpected death of Nathaniel Bliss in 1764; making him &quot;ex officio&quot; a Commissioner of Longitude. The Commissioners understood that the timekeeping and astronomical methods of finding longitude were complementary. The lunar-distance method could more quickly be rolled out, with Maskelyne&#x27;s proposal that tables like those in his &quot;The British Mariner&#x27;s Guide&quot; be published for each year. This proposal led to the establishment of The Nautical Almanac, the production of which, as Astronomer Royal, Maskelyne oversaw. Taking even occasional astronomical observations was also the only way to check that a timekeeper was keeping good time over the course of a long voyage. The Commissioners also needed to know that more than one sea watch could be made, and that Harrison&#x27;s methods could be communicated to other watchmakers.

The Board of Longitude therefore decided that rewards should be given to Harrison (£10,000), Mayer (£3000, posthumously) and others involved in helping to develop the lunar-distance method. Harrison was told that a further reward of £10,000 would be forthcoming if he could demonstrate the replicability of his watch. Although Harrison and his son later accused Maskelyne of bias against the timekeeping method, charges repeated by authors such as Dava Sobel and Rupert Gould, Maskelyne never submitted a method or an idea of his own for consideration by the Board of Longitude. He was to play a significant role in having marine timekeepers, as well as the lunar-distance method, developed, tested and used on board voyages of exploration.

Since the observations that fed into the &quot;Nautical Almanac&quot; were made at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, the Greenwich meridian became the reference for measurements of longitude in the Royal Navy, and on British Admiralty charts. It was subsequently chosen for adoption as the international Prime Meridian in 1884.

===Measurement of latitude===
Maskelyne took a great interest in various geodetical operations, including the measurement of the length of a degree of latitude in Maryland and Pennsylvania, executed by Mason and Dixon in 1766 – 1768, and later the determination of the relative longitude of Greenwich and Paris. On the French side the work was conducted by Count Cassini, Legendre, and Méchain; on the English side by General Roy. This triangulation was the beginning of the great trigonometrical survey which was subsequently extended all over Britain. His observations appeared in four large folio volumes from 1776 to 1811, some of them being reprinted in Samuel Vince&#x27;s &quot;Elements of Astronomy&quot;.

===Schiehallion experiment===
In 1772 Maskelyne proposed to the Royal Society what was to become known as the Schiehallion experiment (named after the Scottish mountain on which it was performed), for the determination of the Earth&#x27;s density using a plumb line. He was not the first to suggest this, Pierre Bouguer and Charles-Marie de la Condamine having attempted the same experiment in 1738 in the Andes.

Maskelyne performed his experiment in 1774 on Schiehallion in Perthshire, Scotland, the mountain being chosen due to its regular conical shape which permitted a reasonably accurate determination of its volume. The apparent difference of latitude between two stations on opposite sides of the mountain were compared with the real difference of latitude obtained by triangulation.

From Maskelyne&#x27;s observations Charles Hutton deduced a density for the earth 4.5 times that of water (the modern value is 5.515).

==Other work==
Maskelyne&#x27;s first contribution to astronomical literature was &quot;A Proposal for Discovering the Annual Parallax of Sirius&quot;, published in 1760. Subsequent contributions to the &quot;Transactions&quot; contained his observations of the transits of Venus (1761 and 1769), on the tides at Saint Helena (1762), and on various astronomical phenomena at Saint Helena (1764) and at Barbados (1764).

Maskelyne also introduced several practical improvements, such as the measurement of time to tenths of a second and prevailed upon the government to replace Bird&#x27;s mural quadrant by a repeating circle 6 feet (1.8 m) in diameter. The new instrument was constructed by Edward Troughton but Maskelyne did not live to see it completed.

==Maskelyne in literature and the arts==

* Maskelyne features prominently in Dava Sobel&#x27;s 1995 book, &quot;&quot;, as well as the television serial based on the book, where he is portrayed by Samuel West.
* Maskelyne is a supporting character in the novel &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; by Thomas Pynchon. He and Charles Mason (and briefly, Jeremiah Dixon before he returns to Cape Town) meet on Saint Helena - with the characters of the two clashing while they spend time which each other.
* Maskelyne is portrayed as &quot;Dr. Vickery&quot; in Kate Grenville&#x27;s semi-historical novel &quot;The Lieutenant&quot;.

==Honours==

* 1775 – Awarded the Royal Society&#x27;s Copley Medal
* 1776 – Elected a Member of the Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
* 1778 – Elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
* The lunar crater Maskelyne in the Sea of Tranquility is named after him.
* William Wales named the Maskelyne Islands in southern Malekule, Vanuatu after him while on James Cook&#x27;s second voyage on HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;.
*Also during Cook&#x27;s second voyage, the colony at Botany Bay had a small area next to the newly established observatory named Point Maskelyne.

<doc id="42880" wikidata="Q242388" url="?curid=42880" title="John Flamsteed">
<text>John Flamsteed (19 August 1646 – 31 December 1719) was an English astronomer and the first Astronomer Royal. His main achievements were the preparation of a 3,000-star catalogue, &quot;Catalogus Britannicus&quot;, and a star atlas called &quot;Atlas Coelestis&quot;, both published posthumously. He also made the first recorded observations of Uranus, although he mistakenly catalogued it as a star, and he laid the foundation stone for the Royal Greenwich Observatory.

== Life ==

Flamsteed was born in Denby, Derbyshire, England, the only son of Stephen Flamsteed and his first wife, Mary Spadman. He was educated at the free school of Derby and at Derby School, in St Peter&#x27;s Churchyard, Derby, near where his father carried on a malting business. At that time, most masters of the school were Puritans. Flamsteed had a solid knowledge of Latin, essential for reading the scientific literature of the day, and a love of history, leaving the school in May 1662.

His progress to Jesus College, Cambridge, recommended by the Master of Derby School, was delayed by some years of chronic ill health. During those years, Flamsteed gave his father some help in his business, and from his father learnt arithmetic and the use of fractions, developing a keen interest in mathematics and astronomy. In July 1662, he was fascinated by the thirteenth-century work of Johannes de Sacrobosco, &quot;De sphaera mundi&quot;, and on 12 September 1662 observed his first partial solar eclipse. Early in 1663, he read Thomas Fale&#x27;s &quot;Horologiographia: The Art of Dialling&quot;, which set off an interest in sundials. In the summer of 1663, he read Wingate&#x27;s &quot;Canon&quot;, William Oughtred&#x27;s &quot;Canon&quot;, and Thomas Stirrup&#x27;s &quot;Art of Dialling&quot;. At about the same time, he acquired Thomas Street&#x27;s &quot;Astronomia Carolina, or A New Theory of the Celestial Motions&quot; (&quot;Caroline Tables&quot;). He associated himself with local gentlemen interested in astronomy, including William Litchford, whose library included the work of the astrologer John Gadbury which included astronomical tables by Jeremiah Horrocks, who had died in 1641 at the age of twenty-two. Flamsteed was greatly impressed (as Isaac Newton had been) by the work of Horrocks.

In August 1665, at the age of nineteen and as a gift for his friend Litchford, Flamsteed wrote his first paper on astronomy, entitled &quot;Mathematical Essays&quot;, concerning the design, use and construction of an astronomer&#x27;s quadrant, including tables for the latitude of Derby.

In September 1670, Flamsteed visited Cambridge and entered his name as an undergraduate at Jesus College. While it seems he never took up full residence, he was there for two months in 1674, and had the opportunity to hear Isaac Newton&#x27;s &quot;Lucasian Lectures&quot;.

Ordained a deacon, he was preparing to take up a living in Derbyshire when he was invited to London by his patron Jonas Moore, Surveyor-General of the Ordnance. Moore had recently made an offer to the Royal Society to pay for the establishment of an observatory. These plans were, however, preempted when Charles II was persuaded by his mistress, Louise de Kérouaille, Duchess of Portsmouth, to hear about a proposal to find longitude by the position of the Moon from an individual known as Le Sieur de St Pierre. Charles appointed a Royal Commission to examine the proposal in December 1674, consisting of Lord Brouncker, Seth Ward, Samuel Moreland, Christopher Wren, Silius Titus, John Pell and Robert Hooke.

Having arrived in London on 2 February 1675, and staying with Jonas Moore at the Tower of London, Flamsteed had the opportunity to be taken by Titus to meet the King. He was subsequently admitted as an official Assistant to the Royal Commission and supplied observations in order to test St Pierre&#x27;s proposal and to offer his own comments. The commission&#x27;s conclusions were that, although St Pierre&#x27;s proposal was not worth further consideration, the King should consider establishing an observatory and appointing an observer in order to better map the stars and the motions of the Moon in order to underpin the successful development of the lunar-distance method of finding longitude.

On 4 March 1675 Flamsteed was appointed by royal warrant &quot;The King&#x27;s Astronomical Observator&quot; – the first English Astronomer Royal, with an allowance of £100 a year. The warrant stated his task as &quot;rectifieing the Tables of the motions of the Heavens, and the places of the fixed stars, so as to find out the so much desired Longitude of places for Perfecteing the Art of Navigation&quot;. In June 1675, another royal warrant provided for the founding of the Royal Greenwich Observatory, and Flamsteed laid the foundation stone on 10 August.

In February 1676, he was admitted a Fellow of the Royal Society, and in July, he moved into the Observatory where he lived until 1684, when he was &quot;[e]levated to the priesthood [and] appointed rector&quot; of the small village of Burstow, near Crawley in Surrey. He held that office, as well as that of Astronomer Royal, until his death. He is buried at Burstow, and the east window in the church was dedicated to him as a memorial. 
 The will of Flamsteed&#x27;s widow, Margaret, left instructions for her own remains to be deposited &quot;in the same Grave in which Mr John Flamsteed is buryed in the Chancell of Burstow Church&quot;. She also left instructions, and twenty five pounds, for the executor of her will to place &quot;in the aforesaid Chancell of Burstow … A Marble stone or Monument, with an inscription in Latin, in memory of the late Reverend Mr. John Flamsteed&quot;. It seems no such monument was created, and almost 200 years later, a plaque was placed to mark his burial in the chancel.

After his death, his papers and scientific instruments were taken by his widow. The papers were returned many years later, but the instruments disappeared.

== Scientific work ==
Flamsteed accurately calculated the solar eclipses of 1666 and 1668. He was responsible for several of the earliest recorded sightings of the planet Uranus, which he mistook for a star and catalogued as &#x27;34 Tauri&#x27;. The first of these was in December 1690, which remains the earliest known sighting of Uranus by an astronomer.

In October 1672, when Mars was in opposition, Flamsteed used eyepieces with illuminated micrometer reticle carrying double cross-hairs, to measure Mars&#x27; diurnal parallax, thus allowing Flamsteed to estimate the distance to Mars and hence the astronomical unit. To this end, Flamsteed compared the apparent shift of Mars during the night with respect to other stars, this shift being superimposed on Mars&#x27; apparent night-to-night course among the stars.

On 16 August 1680 Flamsteed catalogued a star, 3 Cassiopeiae, that later astronomers were unable to corroborate. Three hundred years later, the American astronomical historian William Ashworth suggested that what Flamsteed may have seen was the most recent supernova in the galaxy&#x27;s history, an event which would leave as its remnant the strongest radio source outside of the Solar System, known in the third Cambridge (3C) catalogue as 3C 461 and commonly called Cassiopeia A by astronomers. Because the position of &quot;3 Cassiopeiae&quot; does not precisely match that of Cassiopeia A, and because the expansion wave associated with the explosion has been worked backward to the year 1667 and not 1680, some historians feel that all Flamsteed may have done was incorrectly note the position of a star already known.

In 1681 Flamsteed proposed that the two great comets observed in November and December 1680 were not separate bodies, but rather a single comet travelling first towards the Sun and then away from it. Although Isaac Newton first disagreed with Flamsteed, he later came to agree with him and theorized that comets, like planets, moved around the Sun in large, closed elliptical orbits. Flamsteed later learned that Newton had gained access to his observations and data through Edmond Halley, his former assistant with whom he previously had a cordial relationship.

As Astronomer Royal, Flamsteed spent some forty years observing and making meticulous records for his star catalogue, which would eventually triple the number of entries in Tycho Brahe&#x27;s sky atlas. Unwilling to risk his reputation by releasing unverified data, he kept the incomplete records under seal at Greenwich. In 1712, Isaac Newton, then President of the Royal Society, and Edmond Halley again obtained Flamsteed&#x27;s data and published a pirated star catalogue. Flamsteed managed to gather three hundred of the four hundred printings and burned them. &quot;If Sir I.N. would be sensible of it, I have done both him and Dr. Halley a great kindness,&quot; he wrote to his assistant Abraham Sharp. The data from the pirated catalogue were used by the London cartographer John Senex to produce star charts in the 1720s before Flamsteed&#x27;s own charts were ready.

In 1725 Flamsteed&#x27;s own version of &quot;Historia Coelestis Britannica&quot; was published posthumously, edited by his wife, Margaret Flamsteed. This contained Flamsteed&#x27;s observations, and included a catalogue of 2,935 stars to much greater accuracy than any prior work. It was considered the first significant contribution of the Greenwich Observatory, and the numerical Flamsteed designations for stars that were added subsequently to a French edition are still in use. In 1729 his wife published his &quot;Atlas Coelestis&quot;, assisted by Joseph Crosthwait and Abraham Sharp, who were responsible for the technical side.

<doc id="42882" wikidata="Q170835" url="?curid=42882" title="Cosmogony">
<text>Cosmogony is any model concerning the origin of the cosmos or the universe.

== Overview ==

=== Scientific theories ===

In astronomy, cosmogony is the study of the origin of particular astrophysical objects or systems, and is most commonly used in reference to the origin of the universe, the Solar System, or the Earth–Moon system. The prevalent cosmological model of the early development of the universe is the Big Bang theory.

Sean M. Carroll, who specializes in theoretical cosmology and field theory, explains two competing explanations for the origins of the singularity, which is the center of a space in which a characteristic is limitless (one example is the singularity of a black hole, where gravity is the characteristic that becomes infinite).

It is generally thought that the universe began at a point of singularity, but among Modern Cosmologists and Physicists, a singularity usually represents a lack of understanding, and in the case of Cosmology/Cosmogony, requires a theory of quantum gravity to understand. When the universe started to expand, what is colloquially known as the Big Bang occurred, which evidently began the universe. The other explanation, held by proponents such as Stephen Hawking, asserts that time did not exist when it emerged along with the universe. This assertion implies that the universe does not have a beginning, as time did not exist &quot;prior&quot; to the universe. Hence, it is unclear whether properties such as space or time emerged with the singularity and the known universe.

Despite the research, there is currently no theoretical model that explains the earliest moments of the universe&#x27;s existence (during the Planck epoch) due to a lack of a testable theory of quantum gravity. Nevertheless, researchers of string theory, its extensions (such as M-theory), and of loop quantum cosmology, like Barton Zwiebach and Washington Taylor, have proposed solutions to assist in the explanation of the universe&#x27;s earliest moments. Cosmogonists have only tentative theories for the early stages of the universe and its beginning. The proposed theoretical scenarios include string theory, M-theory, the Hartle–Hawking initial state, emergent Universe, string landscape, cosmic inflation, the Big Bang, and the ekpyrotic universe. Some of these proposed scenarios, like the string theory, are compatible, whereas others are not.

=== Mythology ===

In mythology, creation or cosmogonic myths are narratives describing the beginning of the universe or cosmos.

Some methods of the creation of the universe in mythology include:

* the will or action of a supreme being or beings, 
* the process of metamorphosis, 
* the copulation of female and male deities,
* from chaos,
* or via a cosmic egg.

Creation myths may be etiological, attempting to provide explanations for the origin of the universe. For instance, Eridu Genesis, the oldest known creation myth, contains an account of the creation of the world in which the universe was created out of a primeval sea (Abzu). Creation myths vary, but they may share similar deities or symbols. For instance, the ruler of the gods in Greek mythology, Zeus, is similar to the ruler of the gods in Roman mythology, Jupiter. Another example is the ruler of the gods in Tagalog mythology, Bathala, who is similar to various rulers of certain pantheons within Philippine mythology such as the Bisaya&#x27;s Kaptan.

In the humanities, the distinction between cosmogony and cosmology is blurred. For example, in theology, the cosmological argument for the existence of God (pre-cosmic cosmogonic bearer of personhood) is an appeal to ideas concerning the origin of the universe and is thus cosmogonical. Some religious cosmogonies have an impersonal first cause (for example Taoism).

However, in astronomy, cosmogony can be distinguished from cosmology, which studies the universe and its existence, but does not necessarily inquire into its origins. There is therefore a scientific distinction between cosmological and cosmogonical ideas. Physical cosmology is the science that attempts to explain all observations relevant to the development and characteristics of the universe on its largest scale. Some questions regarding the behaviour of the universe have been described by some physicists and cosmologists as being extra-scientific or metaphysical. Attempted solutions to such questions may include the extrapolation of scientific theories to untested regimes (such as the Planck epoch), or the inclusion of philosophical or religious ideas.

<text>Gattaca is a 1997 American dystopian science fiction film written and directed by Andrew Niccol in his feature directorial debut. It stars Ethan Hawke and Uma Thurman with Jude Law, Loren Dean, Ernest Borgnine, Gore Vidal, and Alan Arkin appearing in supporting roles. The film presents a future society driven by eugenics where children are conceived through genetic selection to ensure they possess the best hereditary traits of their parents. The film centers on Vincent Freeman, played by Hawke, who was conceived outside the eugenics program and struggles to overcome genetic discrimination to realize his dream of going into space.

The film draws on concerns over reproductive technologies that facilitate eugenics, and the possible consequences of such technological developments for society. It also explores the idea of destiny and the ways in which it can and does govern lives. Characters in &quot;Gattaca&quot; continually battle both with society and with themselves to find their place in the world and who they are destined to be according to their genes.

The film&#x27;s title is based on the letters G, A, T, and C, which stand for guanine, adenine, thymine, and cytosine, the four nucleobases of DNA. It was a 1997 nominee for the Academy Award for Best Art Direction and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score. A follow-up series was in development at Showtime, but has been cancelled as of 2023.

==Plot==
In the &quot;not-too-distant&quot; future, eugenics is common. A genetic registry database uses biometrics to classify those so created as &quot;valids&quot; while those conceived naturally and more susceptible to genetic disorders are known as &quot;in-valids&quot;. Genetic discrimination is illegal, but in practice genotype profiling is used to identify valids to qualify for professional employment while in-valids are relegated to menial jobs.

Vincent Freeman was conceived naturally, and his genetic profile indicates a high probability of several disorders and an estimated lifespan of 30.2 years. His parents, regretting their decision, use genetic selection in conceiving their second child, Anton Jr. Growing up, the two brothers often play a game of &quot;chicken&quot; by swimming out to sea as far as possible, with the first one returning to shore considered the loser; Vincent always loses. Vincent dreams of a career in space travel, but is always reminded of his genetic inferiority. One day, Vincent challenges Anton to a game of chicken and beats him. Anton starts to drown and is saved by Vincent. Shortly after, Vincent leaves home.

Years later, Vincent works cleaning office spaces, including that of spaceflight conglomerate Gattaca Aerospace Corporation. He gets a chance to pose as a valid by using donated hair, skin, blood, and urine samples from former swimming star Jerome Eugene Morrow, who was paralyzed after being hit by a car. With Jerome&#x27;s genetic makeup, Vincent gains employment at Gattaca and is assigned as a navigator for an upcoming mission to Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan. To conceal his identity, Vincent must meticulously groom and scrub down daily to remove his own genetic material, pass daily DNA scanning and urine tests using Jerome&#x27;s samples, and hide his heart defect.

When a Gattaca administrator is murdered a week before a possible launch, the police find one of Vincent&#x27;s eyelashes near the crime scene, but can only identify it as from an &quot;unregistered&quot; in-valid, and thus launch an investigation to find who owns the eyelash. During this, Vincent becomes close to a co-worker, Irene Cassini, and falls in love with her. Though a valid, Irene has a higher risk of heart failure that will bar her from any deep space mission. Vincent also learns that Jerome&#x27;s paralysis is self-inflicted; after placing silver in the Olympics, Jerome threw himself in front of a car. Jerome maintains that he was designed to be the best, yet somehow wasn&#x27;t, and is suffering because of this.

Vincent repeatedly evades the grasp of the investigation. Finally, it is revealed that Gattaca&#x27;s mission director Josef killed the administrator because he threatened to cancel the mission. Vincent learns that the detective who closed the case was his brother Anton, who consequently has discovered Vincent&#x27;s presence. The brothers meet, and Anton warns Vincent about his illegal actions, but Vincent asserts that he has gotten to this position on his own merits. Anton challenges Vincent to a final game of chicken. As the two swim out at night, Vincent&#x27;s stamina surprises Anton, so Vincent reveals that he won by not saving energy for the swim back. Anton turns back and begins to drown, but Vincent rescues him and swims them back to shore.

On the day of the launch, Jerome reveals that he has stored enough DNA samples for Vincent to last two lifetimes upon his return and gives him an envelope to open once in flight. After saying goodbye to Irene, Vincent prepares to board, but discovers there is a final genetic test, and he currently lacks any of Jerome&#x27;s samples. He is surprised when Dr. Lamar, who oversees background checks, reveals that he knows Vincent has been posing as a valid. Lamar admits that his son looks up to Vincent and wonders whether his son, who is genetically selected, but &quot;not all that they promised&quot;, could exceed his potential just as Vincent has. The doctor changes the test results, allowing Vincent to pass.

As the rocket launches, Jerome dons his swimming medal and immolates himself in his home&#x27;s incinerator. Vincent opens the note to find a lock of Jerome&#x27;s hair.

==Production==
The film was shot under the working title &quot;The Eighth Day&quot;, a reference to the seven days of creation in the Bible. However, by the time its release was scheduled for the fall of 1997, the Belgian film had already been released in the US under the title &quot;The Eighth Day&quot;. As a result, the film was retitled &quot;Gattaca&quot;, which takes inspiration from the letters G, A, T, and C, derived from four of the nucleobases of DNA: guanine, adenine, thymine and cytosine.

===Filming===
The exteriors (including the roof scene) and some of the interior shots of the Gattaca complex were filmed at Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s 1960 Marin County Civic Center in San Rafael, California. The speakers in the complex broadcast announcements in both Esperanto and English; Miko Sloper from the Esperanto League of North America went to the recording studio to handle the Esperanto part.

===Design===
The movie uses a swimming treadmill in the opening minutes to punctuate the swimming and futuristic themes. The production design makes heavy use of retrofuturism; the futuristic electric cars are based on 1960s car models like Rover P6, Citroën DS19 and Studebaker Avanti.

=== Title sequence ===
The opening title sequence, created by Michael Riley, features closeups of body matter (fingernails and hair), which are later revealed to be from Vincent&#x27;s daily bodily scourings, hitting the floor accompanied by loud sounds as the objects strike the ground. According to Riley, oversized models of the fingernails and hair were created for the effect.

==Music and soundtrack==
The score for &quot;Gattaca&quot; was composed by Michael Nyman, and the original soundtrack was released on October 21, 1997.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;Gattaca&quot; was released in theaters on October 24, 1997, in the United States by Columbia Pictures and opened at number 5 at the box office; trailing &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Advocate&quot;, &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot;. Over the first weekend the film brought in $4.3 million. It ended its theatrical run with a domestic total of $12.5 million against a reported production budget of $36 million.

===Home media===
&quot;Gattaca&quot; was released on DVD on July 1, 1998, and was also released on Superbit DVD. Special Edition DVD and Blu-ray versions were released on March 11, 2008. Both editions contain a deleted scene featuring historical figures like Einstein, Lincoln, etc., who are described as having been genetically deficient.

&quot;Gattaca&quot; was released on Ultra HD Blu-ray in 2021.

==Reception==

===Critical response===
&quot;Gattaca&quot; received positive reviews from critics. The film received an approval rating of 82% on Rotten Tomatoes based on 66 reviews, with a rating average of 7.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states that &quot;Intelligent and scientifically provocative, &quot;Gattaca&quot; is an absorbing sci-fi drama that poses important interesting ethical questions about the nature of science.&quot; On Metacritic, the film received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; with a score of 64 out of 100, based on 20 reviews. Siskel and Ebert gave the film two thumbs up on the October 25, 1997 episode of their program, with Gene Siskel commenting that the film had a &quot;smart script&quot;. In his other review for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert stated, &quot;This is one of the smartest and most provocative of science fiction films, a thriller with ideas.&quot; James Berardinelli praised it for &quot;energy and tautness&quot; and its &quot;thought-provoking script and thematic richness.&quot;

Although critically acclaimed, &quot;Gattaca&quot; was not a box office success, but it is said to have crystallized the debate over the controversial topic of human genetic engineering. The film&#x27;s dystopian depiction of &quot;genoism&quot; has been cited by many bioethicists and laypeople in support of their hesitancy about, or opposition to, eugenics and the societal acceptance of the genetic-determinist ideology that may frame it. In a 1997 review of the film for the journal &quot;Nature Genetics&quot;, molecular biologist Lee M. Silver stated that &quot;&quot;Gattaca&quot; is a film that all geneticists should see if for no other reason than to understand the perception of our trade held by so many of the public-at-large&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Continuation==
On October 30, 2009, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Sony Pictures Television was developing a television adaptation of the feature film as a one-hour police procedural set in the future. The show was to be written by Gil Grant, who has written for &quot;24&quot; and &quot;NCIS&quot;. A &quot;Gattaca&quot; television series was revealed to be in development at Sony and Showtime in March 2023. It was intended to take place one generation after the events of the film. Howard Gordon and Alex Gansa were tapped as showrunners, and were also expected to serve as screenwriters alongside Craig Borten. Gordon, Gansa, Glenn Gellar, and actor Danny DeVito (who produced the film) would have served as executive producers. However, in June 2023, Showtime announced that they had abandoned plans to produce the show.

==Legacy==

===Influence on &quot;In Time&quot;===
Writer-director Andrew Niccol has called his 2011 film &quot;In Time&quot; a &quot;bastard child of &quot;Gattaca&quot;&quot;. Both films feature classic cars in a futuristic dystopia as well as a caste privilege schism which the protagonist challenges and which prejudices the authorities into neglecting a thorough investigation in favor of condemning the protagonist.

===Political references===
U.S. Senator Rand Paul used near-verbatim portions of the plot summary from the English Wikipedia entry on &quot;Gattaca&quot; in a speech at Liberty University on October 28, 2013, in support of Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli&#x27;s campaign for Governor of Virginia. Paul said that abortion rights advocates are advancing eugenics in a manner similar to the events in &quot;Gattaca&quot;.

===Transhumanism===

In the 2004 democratic transhumanist book &quot;Citizen Cyborg&quot;, bioethicist James Hughes criticized the premise and influence of the film as fear-mongering, arguing:
# Astronaut-training programs are entirely justified in attempting to screen out people with heart problems for safety reasons;
# In the United States, people are already screened by insurance companies on the basis of their propensities to disease, for actuarial purposes;
# Rather than banning genetic testing or genetic enhancement, society should develop genetic information privacy laws, such as the U.S. Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act signed into law on May 21, 2008, that allow justified forms of genetic testing and data aggregation, but forbid those that are judged to result in genetic discrimination. Citizens should then be able to make a complaint to the appropriate authority if they believe they have been discriminated against because of their genotype.

<text>The human genome is a complete set of nucleic acid sequences for humans, encoded as the DNA within each of the 23 distinct chromosomes in the cell nucleus. A small DNA molecule is found within individual mitochondria. These are usually treated separately as the nuclear genome and the mitochondrial genome. Human genomes include both protein-coding DNA sequences and various types of DNA that does not encode proteins. The latter is a diverse category that includes DNA coding for non-translated RNA, such as that for ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA, ribozymes, small nuclear RNAs, and several types of regulatory RNAs. It also includes promoters and their associated gene-regulatory elements, DNA playing structural and replicatory roles, such as scaffolding regions, telomeres, centromeres, and origins of replication, plus large numbers of transposable elements, inserted viral DNA, non-functional pseudogenes and simple, highly repetitive sequences. Introns make up a large percentage of non-coding DNA. Some of this non-coding DNA is non-functional junk DNA, such as pseudogenes, but there is no firm consensus on the total amount of junk DNA.

Although the sequence of the human genome has been completely determined by DNA sequencing in 2022 (including methylome), it is not yet fully understood. Most, but not all, genes have been identified by a combination of high throughput experimental and bioinformatics approaches, yet much work still needs to be done to further elucidate the biological functions of their protein and RNA products. 

== Size of the human genome ==

In 2000, scientists reported the sequencing of 88% of human genome, but as of 2020, at least 8% was still missing. In 2021, scientists reported sequencing a complete, female genome (i.e., without the Y chromosome). The human Y chromosome, consisting of 62,460,029 base pairs from a different cell line and found in all males, was sequenced completely in January 2022.

The current version of the standard reference genome is called GRCh38.p14 (July 2023). It consists of 22 autosomes plus one copy of the X chromosome and one copy of the Y chromosome. It contains approximately 3.1 billion base pairs (3.1 Gb or 3.1 x 109 bp). This represents the size of a composite genome based on data from multiple individuals but it is a good indication of the typical amount of DNA in a haploid set of chromosomes because the Y chromosome is quite small. Most human cells are diploid so they contain twice as much DNA (~6.2 billion base pairs). 

In 2023, a draft human pangenome reference was published. It is based on 47 genomes from persons of varied ethnicity. Plans are underway for an improved reference capturing still more biodiversity from a still wider sample.

While there are significant differences among the genomes of human individuals (on the order of 0.1% due to single-nucleotide variants and 0.6% when considering indels), these are considerably smaller than the differences between humans and their closest living relatives, the bonobos and chimpanzees (~1.1% fixed single-nucleotide variants and 4% when including indels).

== Molecular organization and gene content ==

The total length of the human reference genome does not represent the sequence of any specific individual, nor does it represent the sequence of all of the DNA found within a cell. The human reference genome only includes one copy of each of the paired, homologous autosomes plus one copy of each of the two sex chromosomes (X and Y). The total amount of DNA in this reference genome is 3.1 billion base pairs (3.1 Gb).

=== Protein-coding genes ===

Protein-coding sequences represent the most widely studied and best understood component of the human genome. These sequences ultimately lead to the production of all human proteins, although several biological processes (e.g. DNA rearrangements and alternative pre-mRNA splicing) can lead to the production of many more unique proteins than the number of protein-coding genes. 

The human reference genome contains somewhere between 19,000 and 20,000 protein-coding genes. These genes contain an average of 10 introns and the average size of an intron is about 6 kb (6,000 bp). This means that the average size of a protein-coding gene is about 62 kb and these genes take up about 40% of the genome.

Exon sequences consist of coding DNA and untranslated regions (UTRs) at either end of the mature mRNA. The total amount of coding DNA is about 1-2% of the genome.

Many people divide the genome into coding and non-coding DNA based on the idea that coding DNA is the most important functional component of the genome. About 98-99% of the human genome is non-coding DNA.

=== Non-coding genes ===
Noncoding RNA molecules play many essential roles in cells, especially in the many reactions of protein synthesis and RNA processing. Noncoding genes include those for tRNAs, ribosomal RNAs, microRNAs, snRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). The number of reported non-coding genes continues to rise slowly but the exact number in the human genome is yet to be determined. Many RNAs are thought to be non-functional.

Many ncRNAs are critical elements in gene regulation and expression. Noncoding RNA also contributes to epigenetics, transcription, RNA splicing, and the translational machinery. The role of RNA in genetic regulation and disease offers a new potential level of unexplored genomic complexity.

=== Pseudogenes ===
Pseudogenes are inactive copies of protein-coding genes, often generated by gene duplication, that have become nonfunctional through the accumulation of inactivating mutations. The number of pseudogenes in the human genome is on the order of 13,000, and in some chromosomes is nearly the same as the number of functional protein-coding genes. Gene duplication is a major mechanism through which new genetic material is generated during molecular evolution.

For example, the olfactory receptor gene family is one of the best-documented examples of pseudogenes in the human genome. More than 60 percent of the genes in this family are non-functional pseudogenes in humans. By comparison, only 20 percent of genes in the mouse olfactory receptor gene family are pseudogenes. Research suggests that this is a species-specific characteristic, as the most closely related primates all have proportionally fewer pseudogenes. This genetic discovery helps to explain the less acute sense of smell in humans relative to other mammals.

=== Regulatory DNA sequences ===
The human genome has many different regulatory sequences which are crucial to controlling gene expression. Conservative estimates indicate that these sequences make up 8% of the genome, however extrapolations from the ENCODE project give that 20 or more of the genome is gene regulatory sequence. Some types of non-coding DNA are genetic &quot;switches&quot; that do not encode proteins, but do regulate when and where genes are expressed (called enhancers).

Regulatory sequences have been known since the late 1960s. The first identification of regulatory sequences in the human genome relied on recombinant DNA technology. Later with the advent of genomic sequencing, the identification of these sequences could be inferred by evolutionary conservation. The evolutionary branch between the primates and mouse, for example, occurred 70–90 million years ago. So computer comparisons of gene sequences that identify conserved non-coding sequences will be an indication of their importance in duties such as gene regulation.

Other genomes have been sequenced with the same intention of aiding conservation-guided methods, for exampled the pufferfish genome. However, regulatory sequences disappear and re-evolve during evolution at a high rate.

As of 2012, the efforts have shifted toward finding interactions between DNA and regulatory proteins by the technique ChIP-Seq, or gaps where the DNA is not packaged by histones (DNase hypersensitive sites), both of which tell where there are active regulatory sequences in the investigated cell type.

=== Repetitive DNA sequences ===

Repetitive DNA sequences comprise approximately 50% of the human genome.

About 8% of the human genome consists of tandem DNA arrays or tandem repeats, low complexity repeat sequences that have multiple adjacent copies (e.g. &quot;CAGCAGCAG...&quot;). The tandem sequences may be of variable lengths, from two nucleotides to tens of nucleotides. These sequences are highly variable, even among closely related individuals, and so are used for genealogical DNA testing and forensic DNA analysis.

Repeated sequences of fewer than ten nucleotides (e.g. the dinucleotide repeat (AC)n) are termed microsatellite sequences. Among the microsatellite sequences, trinucleotide repeats are of particular importance, as sometimes occur within coding regions of genes for proteins and may lead to genetic disorders. For example, Huntington&#x27;s disease results from an expansion of the trinucleotide repeat (CAG)n within the &quot;Huntingtin&quot; gene on human chromosome 4. Telomeres (the ends of linear chromosomes) end with a microsatellite hexanucleotide repeat of the sequence (TTAGGG)n.

Tandem repeats of longer sequences (arrays of repeated sequences 10–60 nucleotides long) are termed minisatellites.

Transposable genetic elements, DNA sequences that can replicate and insert copies of themselves at other locations within a host genome, are an abundant component in the human genome. The most abundant transposon lineage, &quot;Alu&quot;, has about 50,000 active copies, and can be inserted into intragenic and intergenic regions. One other lineage, LINE-1, has about 100 active copies per genome (the number varies between people). Together with non-functional relics of old transposons, they account for over half of total human DNA. Sometimes called &quot;jumping genes&quot;, transposons have played a major role in sculpting the human genome. Some of these sequences represent endogenous retroviruses, DNA copies of viral sequences that have become permanently integrated into the genome and are now passed on to succeeding generations. There are also a significant number of retroviruses in human DNA, at least 3 of which have been proven to possess an important function (i.e., HIV-like functional HERV-K; envelope genes of non-functional viruses HERV-W and HERV-FRD play a role in placenta formation by inducing cell-cell fusion).

Mobile elements within the human genome can be classified into LTR retrotransposons (8.3% of total genome), SINEs (13.1% of total genome) including Alu elements, LINEs (20.4% of total genome), SVAs (SINE-VNTR-Alu) and Class II DNA transposons (2.9% of total genome).

=== Junk DNA ===
There is no consensus on what constitutes a &quot;functional&quot; element in the genome since geneticists, evolutionary biologists, and molecular biologists employ different definitions and methods. Due to the ambiguity in the terminology, different schools of thought have emerged. In evolutionary definitions, &quot;functional&quot; DNA, whether it is coding or non-coding, contributes to the fitness of the organism, and therefore is maintained by negative evolutionary pressure whereas &quot;non-functional&quot; DNA has no benefit to the organism and therefore is under neutral selective pressure. This type of DNA has been described as junk DNA. In genetic definitions, &quot;functional&quot; DNA is related to how DNA segments manifest by phenotype and &quot;nonfunctional&quot; is related to loss-of-function effects on the organism. In biochemical definitions, &quot;functional&quot; DNA relates to DNA sequences that specify molecular products (e.g. noncoding RNAs) and biochemical activities with mechanistic roles in gene or genome regulation (i.e. DNA sequences that impact cellular level activity such as cell type, condition, and molecular processes). There is no consensus in the literature on the amount of functional DNA since, depending on how &quot;function&quot; is understood, ranges have been estimated from up to 90% of the human genome is likely nonfunctional DNA (junk DNA) to up to 80% of the genome is likely functional. It is also possible that junk DNA may acquire a function in the future and therefore may play a role in evolution, but this is likely to occur only very rarely. Finally DNA that is deliterious to the organism and is under negative selective pressure is called garbage DNA.

== Sequencing ==
The first human genome sequences were published in nearly complete draft form in February 2001 by the Human Genome Project and Celera Corporation. Completion of the Human Genome Project&#x27;s sequencing effort was announced in 2004 with the publication of a draft genome sequence, leaving just 341 gaps in the sequence, representing highly repetitive and other DNA that could not be sequenced with the technology available at the time. The human genome was the first of all vertebrates to be sequenced to such near-completion, and as of 2018, the diploid genomes of over a million individual humans had been determined using next-generation sequencing.

These data are used worldwide in biomedical science, anthropology, forensics and other branches of science. Such genomic studies have led to advances in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and to new insights in many fields of biology, including human evolution.

By 2018, the total number of genes had been raised to at least 46,831, plus another 2300 micro-RNA genes. A 2018 population survey found another 300 million bases of human genome that was not in the reference sequence. Prior to the acquisition of the full genome sequence, estimates of the number of human genes ranged from 50,000 to 140,000 (with occasional vagueness about whether these estimates included non-protein coding genes). As genome sequence quality and the methods for identifying protein-coding genes improved, the count of recognized protein-coding genes dropped to 19,000–20,000.

In 2022, the Telomere-to-Telomere (T2T) consortium reported the complete sequence of a human female genome, filling all the gaps in the X chromosome (2020) and the 22 autosomes (May 2021). The previously unsequenced parts contain immune response genes that help to adapt to and survive infections, as well as genes that are important for predicting drug response. The completed human genome sequence will also provide better understanding of human formation as an individual organism and how humans vary both between each other and other species.

Although the &#x27;completion&#x27; of the human genome project was announced in 2001, there remained hundreds of gaps, with about 5–10% of the total sequence remaining undetermined. The missing genetic information was mostly in repetitive heterochromatic regions and near the centromeres and telomeres, but also some gene-encoding euchromatic regions. There remained 160 euchromatic gaps in 2015 when the sequences spanning another 50 formerly unsequenced regions were determined. Only in 2020 was the first truly complete telomere-to-telomere sequence of a human chromosome determined, namely of the X chromosome. The first complete telomere-to-telomere sequence of a human autosomal chromosome, chromosome 8, followed a year later. The complete human genome (without Y chromosome) was published in 2021, while with Y chromosome in January 2022.

In 2023, a draft human pangenome reference was published. It is based on 47 genomes from persons of varied ethnicity. Plans are underway for an improved reference capturing still more biodiversity from a still wider sample.

== Genomic variation in humans ==
=== Human reference genome ===

With the exception of identical twins, all humans show significant variation in genomic DNA sequences. The human reference genome (HRG) is used as a standard sequence reference.

There are several important points concerning the human reference genome:
* The HRG is a haploid sequence. Each chromosome is represented once.
* The HRG is a composite sequence, and does not correspond to any actual human individual.
* The HRG is periodically updated to correct errors, ambiguities, and unknown &quot;gaps&quot;.
* The HRG in no way represents an &quot;ideal&quot; or &quot;perfect&quot; human individual. It is simply a standardized representation or model that is used for comparative purposes.

The Genome Reference Consortium is responsible for updating the HRG. Version 38 was released in December 2013.

=== Measuring human genetic variation ===

Most studies of human genetic variation have focused on single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are substitutions in individual bases along a chromosome. Most analyses estimate that SNPs occur 1 in 1000 base pairs, on average, in the euchromatic human genome, although they do not occur at a uniform density. Thus follows the popular statement that &quot;we are all, regardless of race, genetically 99.9% the same&quot;, although this would be somewhat qualified by most geneticists. For example, a much larger fraction of the genome is now thought to be involved in copy number variation. A large-scale collaborative effort to catalog SNP variations in the human genome is being undertaken by the International HapMap Project.

The genomic loci and length of certain types of small repetitive sequences are highly variable from person to person, which is the basis of DNA fingerprinting and DNA paternity testing technologies. The heterochromatic portions of the human genome, which total several hundred million base pairs, are also thought to be quite variable within the human population (they are so repetitive and so long that they cannot be accurately sequenced with current technology). These regions contain few genes, and it is unclear whether any significant phenotypic effect results from typical variation in repeats or heterochromatin.

Most gross genomic mutations in gamete germ cells probably result in inviable embryos; however, a number of human diseases are related to large-scale genomic abnormalities. Down syndrome, Turner Syndrome, and a number of other diseases result from nondisjunction of entire chromosomes. Cancer cells frequently have aneuploidy of chromosomes and chromosome arms, although a cause and effect relationship between aneuploidy and cancer has not been established.

==== Mapping human genomic variation ====

Whereas a genome sequence lists the order of every DNA base in a genome, a genome map identifies the landmarks. A genome map is less detailed than a genome sequence and aids in navigating around the genome.

An example of a variation map is the HapMap being developed by the International HapMap Project. The HapMap is a haplotype map of the human genome, &quot;which will describe the common patterns of human DNA sequence variation.&quot; It catalogs the patterns of small-scale variations in the genome that involve single DNA letters, or bases.

Researchers published the first sequence-based map of large-scale structural variation across the human genome in the journal &quot;Nature&quot; in May 2008. Large-scale structural variations are differences in the genome among people that range from a few thousand to a few million DNA bases; some are gains or losses of stretches of genome sequence and others appear as re-arrangements of stretches of sequence. These variations include differences in the number of copies individuals have of a particular gene, deletions, translocations and inversions.

=== Structural variation ===
Structural variation refers to genetic variants that affect larger segments of the human genome, as opposed to point mutations. Often, structural variants (SVs) are defined as variants of 50 base pairs (bp) or greater, such as deletions, duplications, insertions, inversions and other rearrangements. About 90% of structural variants are noncoding deletions but most individuals have more than a thousand such deletions; the size of deletions ranges from dozens of base pairs to tens of thousands of bp. On average, individuals carry ~3 rare structural variants that alter coding regions, e.g. delete exons. About 2% of individuals carry ultra-rare megabase-scale structural variants, especially rearrangements. That is, millions of base pairs may be inverted within a chromosome; ultra-rare means that they are only found in individuals or their family members and thus have arisen very recently.

=== SNP frequency across the human genome ===

Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) do not occur homogeneously across the human genome. In fact, there is enormous diversity in SNP frequency between genes, reflecting different selective pressures on each gene as well as different mutation and recombination rates across the genome. However, studies on SNPs are biased towards coding regions, the data generated from them are unlikely to reflect the overall distribution of SNPs throughout the genome. Therefore, the SNP Consortium protocol was designed to identify SNPs with no bias towards coding regions and the Consortium&#x27;s 100,000 SNPs generally reflect sequence diversity across the human chromosomes. The SNP Consortium aims to expand the number of SNPs identified across the genome to 300 000 by the end of the first quarter of 2001. Changes in non-coding sequence and synonymous changes in coding sequence are generally more common than non-synonymous changes, reflecting greater selective pressure reducing diversity at positions dictating amino acid identity. Transitional changes are more common than transversions, with CpG dinucleotides showing the highest mutation rate, presumably due to deamination.

=== Personal genomes ===
A personal genome sequence is a (nearly) complete sequence of the chemical base pairs that make up the DNA of a single person. Because medical treatments have different effects on different people due to genetic variations such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), the analysis of personal genomes may lead to personalized medical treatment based on individual genotypes.

The first personal genome sequence to be determined was that of Craig Venter in 2007. Personal genomes had not been sequenced in the public Human Genome Project to protect the identity of volunteers who provided DNA samples. That sequence was derived from the DNA of several volunteers from a diverse population. However, early in the Venter-led Celera Genomics genome sequencing effort the decision was made to switch from sequencing a composite sample to using DNA from a single individual, later revealed to have been Venter himself. Thus the Celera human genome sequence released in 2000 was largely that of one man. Subsequent replacement of the early composite-derived data and determination of the diploid sequence, representing both sets of chromosomes, rather than a haploid sequence originally reported, allowed the release of the first personal genome. In April 2008, that of James Watson was also completed. In 2009, Stephen Quake published his own genome sequence derived from a sequencer of his own design, the Heliscope. A Stanford team led by Euan Ashley published a framework for the medical interpretation of human genomes implemented on Quake&#x27;s genome and made whole genome-informed medical decisions for the first time. That team further extended the approach to the West family, the first family sequenced as part of Illumina&#x27;s Personal Genome Sequencing program. Since then hundreds of personal genome sequences have been released, including those of Desmond Tutu, and of a Paleo-Eskimo. In 2012, the whole genome sequences of two family trios among 1092 genomes was made public. In November 2013, a Spanish family made four personal exome datasets (about 1% of the genome) publicly available under a Creative Commons public domain license. The Personal Genome Project (started in 2005) is among the few to make both genome sequences and corresponding medical phenotypes publicly available.

The sequencing of individual genomes further unveiled levels of genetic complexity that had not been appreciated before. Personal genomics helped reveal the significant level of diversity in the human genome attributed not only to SNPs but structural variations as well. However, the application of such knowledge to the treatment of disease and in the medical field is only in its very beginnings. Exome sequencing has become increasingly popular as a tool to aid in diagnosis of genetic disease because the exome contributes only 1% of the genomic sequence but accounts for roughly 85% of mutations that contribute significantly to disease.

=== Human knockouts ===

In humans, gene knockouts naturally occur as heterozygous or homozygous loss-of-function gene knockouts. These knockouts are often difficult to distinguish, especially within heterogeneous genetic backgrounds. They are also difficult to find as they occur in low frequencies.
Populations with high rates of consanguinity, such as countries with high rates of first-cousin marriages, display the highest frequencies of homozygous gene knockouts. Such populations include Pakistan, Iceland, and Amish populations. These populations with a high level of parental-relatedness have been subjects of human knock out research which has helped to determine the function of specific genes in humans. By distinguishing specific knockouts, researchers are able to use phenotypic analyses of these individuals to help characterize the gene that has been knocked out.

Knockouts in specific genes can cause genetic diseases, potentially have beneficial effects, or even result in no phenotypic effect at all. However, determining a knockout&#x27;s phenotypic effect and in humans can be challenging. Challenges to characterizing and clinically interpreting knockouts include difficulty calling of DNA variants, determining disruption of protein function (annotation), and considering the amount of influence mosaicism has on the phenotype.

One major study that investigated human knockouts is the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction study. It was found that individuals possessing a heterozygous loss-of-function gene knockout for the APOC3 gene had lower triglycerides in the blood after consuming a high fat meal as compared to individuals without the mutation. However, individuals possessing homozygous loss-of-function gene knockouts of the APOC3 gene displayed the lowest level of triglycerides in the blood after the fat load test, as they produce no functional APOC3 protein.

== Human genetic disorders ==
Most aspects of human biology involve both genetic (inherited) and non-genetic (environmental) factors. Some inherited variation influences aspects of our biology that are not medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc.). Moreover, some genetic disorders only cause disease in combination with the appropriate environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders may be described as clinically defined diseases caused by genomic DNA sequence variation. In the most straightforward cases, the disorder can be associated with variation in a single gene. For example, cystic fibrosis is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1,300 different mutations known.

Disease-causing mutations in specific genes are usually severe in terms of gene function and are rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they constitute a significant component of known medical conditions, especially in pediatric medicine. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified. Currently there are approximately 2,200 such disorders annotated in the OMIM database.

Studies of genetic disorders are often performed by means of family-based studies. In some instances, population based approaches are employed, particularly in the case of so-called founder populations such as those in Finland, French-Canada, Utah, Sardinia, etc. Diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders are usually performed by a geneticist-physician trained in clinical/medical genetics. The results of the Human Genome Project are likely to provide increased availability of genetic testing for gene-related disorders, and eventually improved treatment. Parents can be screened for hereditary conditions and counselled on the consequences, the probability of inheritance, and how to avoid or ameliorate it in their offspring.

There are many different kinds of DNA sequence variation, ranging from complete extra or missing chromosomes down to single nucleotide changes. It is generally presumed that much naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations is phenotypically neutral, i.e., has little or no detectable effect on the physiology of the individual (although there may be fractional differences in fitness defined over evolutionary time frames). Genetic disorders can be caused by any or all known types of sequence variation. To molecularly characterize a new genetic disorder, it is necessary to establish a causal link between a particular genomic sequence variant and the clinical disease under investigation. Such studies constitute the realm of human molecular genetics.

With the advent of the Human Genome and International HapMap Project, it has become feasible to explore subtle genetic influences on many common disease conditions such as diabetes, asthma, migraine, schizophrenia, etc. Although some causal links have been made between genomic sequence variants in particular genes and some of these diseases, often with much publicity in the general media, these are usually not considered to be genetic disorders &quot;per se&quot; as their causes are complex, involving many different genetic and environmental factors. Thus there may be disagreement in particular cases whether a specific medical condition should be termed a genetic disorder.

Additional genetic disorders of mention are Kallman syndrome and Pfeiffer syndrome (gene FGFR1), Fuchs corneal dystrophy (gene TCF4), Hirschsprung&#x27;s disease (genes RET and FECH), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 (genes CCDC28B and BBS1), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10 (gene BBS10), and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (genes D4Z4 and SMCHD1).

Genome sequencing is now able to narrow the genome down to specific locations to more accurately find mutations that will result in a genetic disorder. Copy number variants (CNVs) and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) are also able to be detected at the same time as genome sequencing with newer sequencing procedures available, called Next Generation Sequencing (NGS). This only analyzes a small portion of the genome, around 1–2%. The results of this sequencing can be used for clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition, including Usher syndrome, retinal disease, hearing impairments, diabetes, epilepsy, Leigh disease, hereditary cancers, neuromuscular diseases, primary immunodeficiencies, severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), and diseases of the mitochondria. NGS can also be used to identify carriers of diseases before conception. The diseases that can be detected in this sequencing include Tay-Sachs disease, Bloom syndrome, Gaucher disease, Canavan disease, familial dysautonomia, cystic fibrosis, spinal muscular atrophy, and fragile-X syndrome. The Next Genome Sequencing can be narrowed down to specifically look for diseases more prevalent in certain ethnic populations.

== Evolution ==
Comparative genomics studies of mammalian genomes suggest that approximately 5% of the human genome has been conserved by evolution since the divergence of extant lineages approximately 200 million years ago, containing the vast majority of genes. The published chimpanzee genome differs from that of the human genome by 1.23% in direct sequence comparisons. Around 20% of this figure is accounted for by variation within each species, leaving only ~1.06% consistent sequence divergence between humans and chimps at shared genes. This nucleotide by nucleotide difference is dwarfed, however, by the portion of each genome that is not shared, including around 6% of functional genes that are unique to either humans or chimps.

In other words, the considerable observable differences between humans and chimps may be due as much or more to genome level variation in the number, function and expression of genes rather than DNA sequence changes in shared genes. Indeed, even within humans, there has been found to be a previously unappreciated amount of copy number variation (CNV) which can make up as much as 5–15% of the human genome. In other words, between humans, there could be +/- 500,000,000 base pairs of DNA, some being active genes, others inactivated, or active at different levels. The full significance of this finding remains to be seen. On average, a typical human protein-coding gene differs from its chimpanzee ortholog by only two amino acid substitutions; nearly one third of human genes have exactly the same protein translation as their chimpanzee orthologs. A major difference between the two genomes is human chromosome 2, which is equivalent to a fusion product of chimpanzee chromosomes 12 and 13. (later renamed to chromosomes 2A and 2B, respectively).

Humans have undergone an extraordinary loss of olfactory receptor genes during our recent evolution, which explains our relatively crude sense of smell compared to most other mammals. Evolutionary evidence suggests that the emergence of color vision in humans and several other primate species has diminished the need for the sense of smell.

In September 2016, scientists reported that, based on human DNA genetic studies, all non-Africans in the world today can be traced to a single population that exited Africa between 50,000 and 80,000 years ago.

== Mitochondrial DNA ==

The human mitochondrial DNA is of tremendous interest to geneticists, since it undoubtedly plays a role in mitochondrial disease. It also sheds light on human evolution; for example, analysis of variation in the human mitochondrial genome has led to the postulation of a recent common ancestor for all humans on the maternal line of descent (see Mitochondrial Eve).

Due to the damage induced by the exposure to Reactive Oxygen Species mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has a more rapid rate of variation than nuclear DNA. This 20-fold higher mutation rate allows mtDNA to be used for more accurate tracing of maternal ancestry. Studies of mtDNA in populations have allowed ancient migration paths to be traced, such as the migration of Native Americans from Siberia or Polynesians from southeastern Asia. It has also been used to show that there is no trace of Neanderthal DNA in the European gene mixture inherited through purely maternal lineage. Due to the restrictive all or none manner of mtDNA inheritance, this result (no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA) would be likely unless there were a large percentage of Neanderthal ancestry, or there was strong positive selection for that mtDNA. For example, going back 5 generations, only 1 of a person&#x27;s 32 ancestors contributed to that person&#x27;s mtDNA, so if one of these 32 was pure Neanderthal an expected ~3% of that person&#x27;s autosomal DNA would be of Neanderthal origin, yet they would have a ~97% chance of having no trace of Neanderthal mtDNA.

== Epigenome ==
Epigenetics describes a variety of features of the human genome that transcend its primary DNA sequence, such as chromatin packaging, histone modifications and DNA methylation, and which are important in regulating gene expression, genome replication and other cellular processes. Epigenetic markers strengthen and weaken transcription of certain genes but do not affect the actual sequence of DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation is a major form of epigenetic control over gene expression and one of the most highly studied topics in epigenetics. During development, the human DNA methylation profile experiences dramatic changes. In early germ line cells, the genome has very low methylation levels. These low levels generally describe active genes. As development progresses, parental imprinting tags lead to increased methylation activity.

Epigenetic patterns can be identified between tissues within an individual as well as between individuals themselves. Identical genes that have differences only in their epigenetic state are called epialleles. Epialleles can be placed into three categories: those directly determined by an individual&#x27;s genotype, those influenced by genotype, and those entirely independent of genotype. The epigenome is also influenced significantly by environmental factors. Diet, toxins, and hormones impact the epigenetic state. Studies in dietary manipulation have demonstrated that methyl-deficient diets are associated with hypomethylation of the epigenome. Such studies establish epigenetics as an important interface between the environment and the genome.

<text>A fusor is a device that uses an electric field to heat ions to a temperature at which they undergo nuclear fusion. The machine induces a potential difference between two metal cages, inside a vacuum. Positive ions fall down this voltage drop, building up speed. If they collide in the center, they can fuse. This is one kind of an inertial electrostatic confinement device – a branch of fusion research.

A Farnsworth–Hirsch fusor is the most common type of fusor. This design came from work by Philo T. Farnsworth in 1964 and Robert L. Hirsch in 1967. A variant type of fusor had been proposed previously by William Elmore, James L. Tuck, and Ken Watson at the Los Alamos National Laboratory though they never built the machine.

Fusors have been built by various institutions. These include academic institutions such as the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and government entities, such as the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran and the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority. Fusors have also been developed commercially, as sources for neutrons by DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and as a method for generating medical isotopes. Fusors have also become very popular for hobbyists and amateurs. A growing number of amateurs have performed nuclear fusion using simple fusor machines. However, fusors are not considered a viable concept for large-scale energy production by scientists.

== Mechanism ==
===Underlying physics===
Fusion takes place when nuclei approach to a distance where the nuclear force can pull them together into a single larger nucleus. Opposing this close approach are the positive charges in the nuclei, which force them apart due to the electrostatic force. In order to produce fusion events, the nuclei must have initial energy great enough to allow them to overcome this Coulomb barrier. As the nuclear force is increased with the number of nucleons, protons and neutrons, and the electromagnetic force is increased with the number of protons only, the easiest atoms to fuse are isotopes of hydrogen, deuterium with one neutron, and tritium with two. With hydrogen fuels, about 3 to 10 keV is needed to allow the reaction to take place.

Traditional approaches to fusion power have generally attempted to heat the fuel to temperatures where the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of their resulting energies is high enough that some of the particles in the long tail have the required energy. High enough in this case is such that the rate of the fusion reactions produces enough energy to offset energy losses to the environment and thus heat the surrounding fuel to the same temperatures and produce a self-sustaining reaction known as &quot;ignition&quot;. Calculations show this takes place at about 50 million kelvin (K), although higher numbers on the order of 100 million K are desirable in practical machines. Due to the extremely high temperatures, fusion reactions are also referred to as &quot;thermo&quot;nuclear.

When atoms are heated to temperatures corresponding to thousands of degrees, the electrons become increasingly free of their nucleus. This leads to a gas-like state of matter known as a plasma, consisting of free nuclei known as ions, and their former electrons. As a plasma consists of free-moving charges, it can be controlled using magnetic and electrical fields. Fusion devices use this capability to retain the fuel at millions of degrees.

===Fusor concept===
The fusor is part of a broader class of devices that attempts to give the fuel fusion-relevant energies by directly accelerating the ions toward each other. In the case of the fusor, this is accomplished with electrostatic forces. For every volt that an ion of ±1 charge is accelerated across it gains 1 electronvolt in energy. To reach the required ~10 keV, a voltage of 10 kV is required, applied to both particles. For comparison, the electron gun in a typical television cathode-ray tube is on the order of 3 to 6 kV, so the complexity of such a device is fairly limited. For a variety of reasons, energies on the order of 15 keV are used. This corresponds to the average kinetic energy at a temperature of approximately 174 million Kelvin, a typical magnetic confinement fusion plasma temperature.

The problem with this colliding beam fusion approach, in general, is that the ions will most likely never hit each other no matter how precisely aimed. Even the most minor misalignment will cause the particles to scatter and thus fail to fuse. It is simple to demonstrate that the scattering chance is many orders of magnitude higher than the fusion rate, meaning that the vast majority of the energy supplied to the ions will go to waste and those fusion reactions that do occur cannot make up for these losses. To be energy positive, a fusion device must recycle these ions back into the fuel mass so that they have thousands or millions of such chances to fuse, and their energy must be retained as much as possible during this period.

The fusor attempts to meet this requirement through the spherical arrangement of its accelerator grid system. Ions that fail to fuse pass through the center of the device and back into the accelerator on the far side, where they are accelerated back into the center again. There is no energy lost in this action, and in theory, assuming infinitely thin grid wires, the ions can circulate forever with no additional energy needed. Even those that scatter will simply take on a new trajectory, exit the grid at some new point, and accelerate back into the center again, providing the circulation that is required for a fusion event to eventually take place.

===Losses===
It is important to consider the actual startup sequence of a fusor to understand the resulting operation. Normally the system is pumped down to a vacuum and then a small amount of gas is placed inside the vacuum chamber. This gas will spread out to fill the volume. When voltage is applied to the electrodes, the atoms between them will experience a field that will cause them to ionize and begin accelerating inward. As the atoms are randomly distributed to begin, the amount of energy they will gain differs; atoms initially near the anode will gain some large portion of the applied voltage, say 15 keV. Those initially near the cathode will gain much less energy, possibly far too low to undergo fusion with their counterparts on the far side of the central reaction area.

The fuel atoms inside the inner area during the startup period are not ionized. The accelerated ions scatter with these and lose their energy, while ionizing the formerly cold atom. This process, and the scatterings off other ions, causes the ion energies to become randomly distributed and the fuel rapidly takes on a non-thermal distribution. For this reason, the energy needed in a fusor system is higher than one where the fuel is heated by some other method, as some will be &quot;lost&quot; during startup.

Real electrodes are not infinitely thin, and the potential for scattering off the wires or even capture of the ions within the electrodes is a significant issue that causes high conduction losses. These losses can be at least five orders of magnitude higher than the energy released from the fusion reaction, even when the fusor is in star mode, which minimizes these reactions.

There are numerous other loss mechanisms as well. These include charge exchange between high-energy ions and low-energy neutral particles, which causes the ion to capture the electron, become electrically neutral, and then leave the fusor as it is no longer accelerated back into the chamber. This leaves behind a newly ionized atom of lower energy and thus cools the plasma. Scatterings may also increase the energy of an ion which allows it to move past the anode and escape, in this example anything above 15 keV.

Additionally, the scatterings of both the ions, and especially impurities left in the chamber, lead to significant Bremsstrahlung, creating X-rays that carries energy out of the fuel. This effect grows with particle energy, meaning the problem becomes more pronounced as the system approaches fusion-relevant operating conditions.

As a result of these loss mechanisms, no fusor has ever come close to break-even energy output and it appears it is unable to ever do so.

The common sources of the high voltage are ZVS flyback HV sources and neon-sign transformers. It can also be called an electrostatic particle accelerator.

==History==
The fusor was originally conceived by Philo T. Farnsworth, better known for his pioneering work in television. In the early 1930s, he investigated a number of vacuum tube designs for use in television, and found one that led to an interesting effect. In this design, which he called the &quot;multipactor&quot;, electrons moving from one electrode to another were stopped in mid-flight with the proper application of a high-frequency magnetic field. The charge would then accumulate in the center of the tube, leading to high amplification. Unfortunately it also led to high erosion on the electrodes when the electrons eventually hit them, and today the multipactor effect is generally considered a problem to be avoided.

What particularly interested Farnsworth about the device was its ability to focus electrons at a particular point. One of the biggest problems in fusion research is to keep the hot fuel from hitting the walls of the container. If this is allowed to happen, the fuel cannot be kept hot enough for the fusion reaction to occur. Farnsworth reasoned that he could build an electrostatic plasma confinement system in which the &quot;wall&quot; fields of the reactor were electrons or ions being held in place by the &quot;multipactor&quot;. Fuel could then be injected through the wall, and once inside it would be unable to escape. He called this concept a virtual electrode, and the system as a whole the &quot;fusor&quot;.

===Design===
Farnsworth&#x27;s original fusor designs were based on cylindrical arrangements of electrodes, like the original multipactors. Fuel was ionized and then fired from small accelerators through holes in the outer (physical) electrodes. Once through the hole they were accelerated towards the inner reaction area at high velocity. Electrostatic pressure from the positively charged electrodes would keep the fuel as a whole off the walls of the chamber, and impacts from new ions would keep the hottest plasma in the center. He referred to this as inertial electrostatic confinement, a term that continues to be used to this day. The voltage between the electrodes needs to be at least 25 kV for fusion to occur.

===Work at Farnsworth Television labs===
All of this work had taken place at the Farnsworth Television labs, which had been purchased in 1949 by ITT Corporation, as part of its plan to become the next RCA. However, a fusion research project was not regarded as immediately profitable. In 1965, the board of directors started asking Harold Geneen to sell off the Farnsworth division, but he had his 1966 budget approved with funding until the middle of 1967. Further funding was refused, and that ended ITT&#x27;s experiments with fusion.

Things changed dramatically with the arrival of Robert Hirsch, and the introduction of the modified Hirsch–Meeks fusor patent. New fusors based on Hirsch&#x27;s design were first constructed between 1964 and 1967. Hirsch published his design in a paper in 1967. His design included ion beams to shoot ions into the vacuum chamber.

The team then turned to the AEC, then in charge of fusion research funding, and provided them with a demonstration device mounted on a serving cart that produced more fusion than any existing &quot;classical&quot; device. The observers were startled, but the timing was bad; Hirsch himself had recently revealed the great progress being made by the Soviets using the tokamak. In response to this surprising development, the AEC decided to concentrate funding on large tokamak projects, and reduce backing for alternative concepts.

===Recent developments===
George H. Miley at the University of Illinois reexamined the fusor and re-introduced it into the field. A low but steady interest in the fusor has persisted since. An important development was the successful commercial introduction of a fusor-based neutron generator. From 2006 until his death in 2007, Robert W. Bussard gave talks on a reactor similar in design to the fusor, now called the polywell, that he stated would be capable of useful power generation. Most recently, the fusor has gained popularity among amateurs, who choose them as home projects due to their relatively low space, money, and power requirements. An online community of &quot;fusioneers&quot;, The Open Source Fusor Research Consortium, or Fusor.net, is dedicated to reporting developments in the world of fusors and aiding other amateurs in their projects. The site includes forums, articles and papers done on the fusor, including Farnsworth&#x27;s original patent, as well as Hirsch&#x27;s patent of his version of the invention.

==Fusion in fusors==

=== Basic fusion ===

Nuclear fusion refers to reactions in which lighter nuclei are combined to become heavier nuclei. This process changes mass into energy which in turn may be captured to provide fusion power. Many types of atoms can be fused. The easiest to fuse are deuterium and tritium. For fusion to occur the ions must be at a temperature of at least 4 keV (kiloelectronvolts), or about 45 million kelvins. The second easiest reaction is fusing deuterium with itself. Because this gas is cheaper, it is the fuel commonly used by amateurs. The ease of doing a fusion reaction is measured by its cross section.

=== Net power ===

At such conditions, the atoms are ionized and make a plasma. The energy generated by fusion, inside a hot plasma cloud can be found with the following equation.

: formula_1
where
: formula_2 is the fusion power density (energy per time per volume),
: &quot;n&quot; is the number density of species A or B (particles per volume),
: formula_3 is the product of the collision cross-section &quot;σ&quot; (which depends on the relative velocity) and the relative velocity &quot;v&quot; of the two species, averaged over all the particle velocities in the system,
: formula_4 is the energy released by a single fusion reaction.

This equation shows that energy varies with the temperature, density, speed of collision, and fuel used. To reach net power, fusion reactions have to occur fast enough to make up for energy losses. Any power plant using fusion will hold in this hot cloud. Plasma clouds lose energy through conduction and radiation. Conduction is when ions, electrons or neutrals touch a surface and leak out. Energy is lost with the particle. Radiation is when energy leaves the cloud as light. Radiation increases as the temperature rises. To get net power from fusion it&#x27;s necessary to overcome these losses. This leads to an equation for power output.

: formula_5
where:
: &quot;η&quot; is the efficiency,
: formula_6 is the power of conduction losses as energy-laden mass leaves,
: formula_7 is the power of radiation losses as energy leaves as light,
: formula_8 is the net power from fusion.

John Lawson used this equation to estimate some conditions for net power based on a Maxwellian cloud. This became the Lawson criterion. Fusors typically suffer from conduction losses due to the wire cage being in the path of the recirculating plasma.

=== In fusors ===
In the original fusor design, several small particle accelerators, essentially TV tubes with the ends removed, inject ions at a relatively low voltage into a vacuum chamber. In the Hirsch version of the fusor, the ions are produced by ionizing a dilute gas in the chamber. In either version there are two concentric spherical electrodes, the inner one being charged negatively with respect to the outer one (to about 80 kV). Once the ions enter the region between the electrodes, they are accelerated towards the center.

In the fusor, the ions are accelerated to several keV by the electrodes, so heating as such is not necessary (as long as the ions fuse before losing their energy by any process). Whereas 45 megakelvins is a very high temperature by any standard, the corresponding voltage is only 4 kV, a level commonly found in such devices as neon signs and CRT televisions. To the extent that the ions remain at their initial energy, the energy can be tuned to take advantage of the peak of the reaction cross section or to avoid disadvantageous (for example neutron-producing) reactions that might occur at higher energies.

Various attempts have been made at increasing deuterium ionization rate, including heaters within &quot;ion-guns&quot;, (similar to the &quot;electron gun&quot; which forms the basis for old-style television display tubes), as well as magnetron type devices, (which are the power sources for microwave ovens), which can enhance ion formation using high-voltage electromagnetic fields. Any method which increases ion density (within limits which preserve ion mean-free path), or ion energy, can be expected to enhance the fusion yield, typically measured in the number of neutrons produced per second.
The ease with which the ion energy can be increased appears to be particularly useful when &quot;high temperature&quot; fusion reactions are considered, such as proton-boron fusion, which has plentiful fuel, requires no radioactive tritium, and produces no neutrons in the primary reaction.

== Common considerations ==

===Modes of operation===
Fusors have at least two modes of operation (possibly more): star mode and halo mode. Halo mode is characterized by a broad symmetric glow, with one or two electron beams exiting the structure. There is little fusion. The halo mode occurs in higher pressure tanks, and as the vacuum improves, the device transitions to star mode. Star mode appears as bright beams of light emanating from the device center.

===Power density===
Because the electric field made by the cages is negative, it cannot simultaneously trap both positively charged ions and negative electrons. Hence, there must be some regions of charge accumulation, which will result in an upper limit on the achievable density. This could place an upper limit on the machine&#x27;s power density, which may keep it too low for power production.

===Thermalization of the ion velocities===
When they first fall into the center of the fusor, the ions will all have the same energy, but the velocity distribution will rapidly approach a Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution. This would occur through simple Coulomb collisions in a matter of milliseconds, but beam-beam instabilities will occur orders of magnitude faster still. In comparison, any given ion will require a few minutes before undergoing a fusion reaction, so that the monoenergetic picture of the fusor, at least for power production, is not appropriate. One consequence of the thermalization is that some of the ions will gain enough energy to leave the potential well, taking their energy with them, without having undergone a fusion reaction.

===Electrodes===
There are a number of unsolved challenges with the electrodes in a fusor power system. To begin with, the electrodes cannot influence the potential within themselves, so it would seem at first glance that the fusion plasma would be in more or less direct contact with the inner electrode, resulting in contamination of the plasma and destruction of the electrode. However, the majority of the fusion tends to occur in microchannels formed in areas of minimum electric potential, seen as visible &quot;rays&quot; penetrating the core. These form because the forces within the region correspond to roughly stable &quot;orbits&quot;. Approximately 40% of the high energy ions in a typical grid operating in star mode may be within these microchannels. Nonetheless, grid collisions remain the primary energy loss mechanism for Farnsworth–Hirsch fusors. Complicating issues is the challenge in cooling the central electrode; any fusor producing enough power to run a power plant seems destined to also destroy its inner electrode. As one fundamental limitation, any method which produces a neutron flux that is captured to heat a working fluid will also bombard its electrodes with that flux, heating them as well.

Attempts to resolve these problems include Bussard&#x27;s Polywell system, D. C. Barnes&#x27; modified Penning trap approach, and the University of Illinois&#x27;s fusor which retains grids but attempts to more tightly focus the ions into microchannels to attempt to avoid losses. While all three are Inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC) devices, only the last is actually a &quot;fusor&quot;.

===Radiation===
Charged particles will radiate energy as light when they change velocity. This loss rate can be estimated for nonrelativistic particles using the Larmor formula. Inside a fusor there is a cloud of ions and electrons. These particles will accelerate or decelerate as they move about. These changes in speed make the cloud lose energy as light. The radiation from a fusor can (at least) be in the visible, ultraviolet and X-ray spectrum, depending on the type of fusor used. These changes in speed can be due to electrostatic interactions between particles (ion to ion, ion to electron, electron to electron). This is referred to bremsstrahlung radiation, and is common in fusors. Changes in speed can also be due to interactions between the particle and the electric field. Since there are no magnetic fields, fusors emit no cyclotron radiation at slow speeds, or synchrotron radiation at high speeds.

In &quot;Fundamental limitations on plasma fusion systems not in thermodynamic equilibrium&quot;, Todd Rider argues that a quasineutral isotropic plasma will lose energy due to Bremsstrahlung at a rate prohibitive for any fuel other than D-T (or possibly D-D or D-He3). This paper is not applicable to IEC fusion, as a quasineutral plasma cannot be contained by an electric field, which is a fundamental part of IEC fusion. However, in an earlier paper, &quot;A general critique of inertial-electrostatic confinement fusion systems&quot;, Rider addresses the common IEC devices directly, including the fusor. In the case of the fusor the electrons are generally separated from the mass of the fuel isolated near the electrodes, which limits the loss rate. However, Rider demonstrates that practical fusors operate in a range of modes that either lead to significant electron mixing and losses, or alternately lower power densities. This appears to be a sort of catch-22 that limits the output of any fusor-like system.

===Safety===
There are several key safety considerations involved with the building and operation of a fusor. First, there is the high-voltage involved. Second, there are the x-ray and neutron emissions that are possible. Also there are the publicity / misinformation considerations with local and regulatory authorities. 

== Commercial applications ==

=== Neutron source ===

The fusor has been demonstrated as a viable neutron source. Typical fusors cannot reach fluxes as high as nuclear reactor or particle accelerator sources, but are sufficient for many uses. Importantly, the neutron generator easily sits on a benchtop, and can be turned off at the flick of a switch. A commercial fusor was developed as a non-core business within DaimlerChrysler Aerospace – Space Infrastructure, Bremen between 1996 and early 2001. After the project was effectively ended, the former project manager established a company which is called NSD-Fusion. To date, the highest neutron flux achieved by a fusor-like device has been 3 × 1011 neutrons per second with the deuterium-deuterium fusion reaction.

=== Medical isotopes ===

Commercial startups have used the neutron fluxes generated by fusors to generate Mo-99, a precursor to Technetium-99m, an isotope used for medical care.

<text>Philo Taylor Farnsworth (August 19, 1906 – March 11, 1971) was an American inventor and television pioneer. He made the critical contributions to electronic television that made possible modern electronic video. He is best known for his 1927 invention of the first fully functional all-electronic image pickup device (video camera tube), the image dissector, as well as the first fully functional and complete all-electronic television system. Farnsworth developed a television system complete with receiver and camera—which he produced commercially through the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation from 1938 to 1951, in Fort Wayne, Indiana.

In later life, Farnsworth invented a small nuclear fusion device, the Farnsworth Fusor, employing inertial electrostatic confinement (IEC). Like many fusion devices, it was not a practical device for generating nuclear power, although it provides a viable source of neutrons. The design of this device has been the inspiration for other fusion approaches, including the Polywell reactor concept. Farnsworth held 300 patents, mostly in radio and television.

==Early life==
Farnsworth was born August 19, 1906, the eldest of five children of Lewis Edwin Farnsworth and Serena Amanda Bastian, a Latter-day Saint couple living in a small log cabin built by Lewis&#x27; father in Manderfield, near Beaver, Utah. His maternal grandfather, Jacob Bastian, was a Mormon immigrant from Denmark. In 1918, the family moved to a relative&#x27;s ranch near Rigby, Idaho, where his father supplemented his farming income by hauling freight with his horse-drawn wagon. Philo was excited to find that his new home was wired for electricity, with a Delco generator providing power for lighting and farm machinery. He was a quick student in mechanical and electrical technology, repairing the troublesome generator. He found a burned-out electric motor among some items discarded by the previous tenants and rewound the armature; he converted his mother&#x27;s hand-powered washing machine into an electric-powered one. He developed an early interest in electronics after his first telephone conversation with a distant relative, and he discovered a large cache of technology magazines in the attic of their new home. He won $25 in a pulp-magazine contest for inventing a magnetized car lock. Farnsworth was a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

Farnsworth excelled in chemistry and physics at Rigby High School. He asked science teacher Justin Tolman for advice about an electronic television system that he was contemplating; he provided the teacher with sketches and diagrams covering several blackboards to show how it might be accomplished electronically, and Tolman encouraged him to develop his ideas.
One of the drawings that he did on a blackboard for his chemistry teacher was recalled and reproduced for a patent interference case between Farnsworth and RCA.

In 1923, the family moved to Provo, Utah, and Farnsworth attended Brigham Young High School that fall. His father died of pneumonia in January 1924 at age 58, and Farnsworth assumed responsibility for sustaining the family while finishing high school. After graduating BYHS in June 1924, he applied to the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, where he earned the nation&#x27;s second-highest score on academy recruiting tests. However, he was already thinking ahead to his television projects; he learned that the government would own his patents if he stayed in the military, so he obtained an honorable discharge within months of joining under a provision in which the eldest child in a fatherless family could be excused from military service to provide for his family. He returned to Provo and enrolled at Brigham Young University, but he was not allowed by the faculty to attend their advanced science classes based upon policy considerations. He attended anyway and made use of the university&#x27;s research labs, and he earned a Junior Radio-Trician certification from the National Radio Institute, and full certification in 1925. While attending college, he met Provo High School student Elma &quot;Pem&quot; Gardner (1908–2006), whom he eventually married.

Farnsworth worked while his sister Agnes took charge of the family home and the second-floor boarding house, with the help of a cousin living with the family. The Farnsworths later moved into half of a duplex, with family friends the Gardners moving into the other side when it became vacant. He developed a close friendship with Pem&#x27;s brother Cliff Gardner, who shared his interest in electronics, and the two moved to Salt Lake City to start a radio repair business. The business failed, and Gardner returned to Provo.

Farnsworth remained in Salt Lake City and became acquainted with Leslie Gorrell and George Everson, a pair of San Francisco philanthropists who were then conducting a Salt Lake City Community Chest fund-raising campaign. They agreed to fund his early television research with an initial $6,000 in backing, and set up a laboratory in Los Angeles for Farnsworth to carry out his experiments.
Farnsworth married Pem on May 27, 1926, and the two traveled to Berkeley, California, in a Pullman coach. They rented a house at 2910 Derby Street, from which he applied for his first television patent, which was granted on August 26, 1930. By that time they had moved across the bay to San Francisco, where Farnsworth set up his new lab at 202 Green Street.

==Career==

A few months after arriving in California, Farnsworth was prepared to show his models and drawings to a patent attorney who was nationally recognized as an authority on electrophysics. Everson and Gorrell agreed that Farnsworth should apply for patents for his designs, a decision that proved crucial in later disputes with RCA. Most television systems in use at the time used image scanning devices (&quot;rasterizers&quot;) employing rotating &quot;Nipkow disks&quot; comprising a spinning disk with holes arranged in spiral patterns such that they swept across an image in a succession of short arcs while focusing the light they captured on photosensitive elements, thus producing a varying electrical signal corresponding to the variations in light intensity. Farnsworth recognized the limitations of the mechanical systems, and that an all-electronic scanning system could produce a superior image for transmission to a receiving device.

On September 7, 1927, Farnsworth&#x27;s image dissector camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, to a receiver in another room of his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco. Pem Farnsworth recalled in 1985 that her husband broke the stunned silence of his lab assistants by saying, &quot;There you are – electronic television!&quot; The source of the image was a glass slide, backlit by an arc lamp. An extremely bright source was required because of the low light sensitivity of the design. By 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. His backers had demanded to know when they would see dollars from the invention; so the first image shown was, appropriately, a dollar sign. In 1929, the design was further improved by elimination of a motor-generator, which meant the television system now had no mechanical parts. During the same year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a image of his wife Elma (&quot;Pem&quot;) with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).

Many inventors had built electromechanical television systems before Farnsworth&#x27;s seminal contribution, but Farnsworth designed and built the world&#x27;s first working all-electronic television system, employing electronic scanning in both the pickup and display devices. He first demonstrated his system to the press on September 3, 1928, and to the public at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia on August 25, 1934.

In 1930, RCA recruited Vladimir K. Zworykin—who had tried, unsuccessfully, to develop his own all-electronic television system at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh since 1923—to lead its television development department. Before leaving his old employer, Zworykin visited Farnsworth&#x27;s laboratory, and was sufficiently impressed with the performance of the Image Dissector that he reportedly had his team at Westinghouse make several copies of the device for experimentation. Zworykin later abandoned research on the Image Dissector, which at the time required extremely bright illumination of its subjects, and turned his attention to what became the Iconoscope. In a 1970s series of videotaped interviews, Zworykin recalled that, &quot;Farnsworth was closer to this thing you&#x27;re using now [i.e., a video camera] than anybody, because he used the cathode-ray tube for transmission. But, Farnsworth didn&#x27;t have the mosaic [of discrete light elements], he didn&#x27;t have storage. Therefore, [picture] definition was very low... But he was very proud, and he stuck to his method.&quot; Contrary to Zworykin&#x27;s statement, Farnsworth&#x27;s patent number 2,087,683 for the Image Dissector (filed April 26, 1933) features the &quot;charge storage plate&quot; invented by Tihanyi in 1928 and a &quot;low velocity&quot; method of electron scanning, also describes &quot;discrete particles&quot; whose &quot;potential&quot; is manipulated and &quot;saturated&quot; to varying degrees depending on their velocity. Farnsworth&#x27;s patent numbers 2,140,695 and 2,233,888 are for a &quot;charge storage dissector&quot; and &quot;charge storage amplifier,&quot; respectively.

In 1931, David Sarnoff of RCA offered to buy Farnsworth&#x27;s patents for $100,000, with the stipulation that he become an employee of RCA, but Farnsworth refused. In June of that year, Farnsworth joined the Philco company and moved to Philadelphia along with his wife and two children. RCA later filed an interference suit against Farnsworth, claiming Zworykin&#x27;s 1923 patent had priority over Farnsworth&#x27;s design, despite the fact it could present no evidence that Zworykin had actually produced a functioning transmitter tube before 1931. Farnsworth had lost two interference claims to Zworykin in 1928, but this time he prevailed and the U.S. Patent Office rendered a decision in 1934 awarding priority of the invention of the image dissector to Farnsworth. RCA lost a subsequent appeal, but litigation over a variety of issues continued for several years before Sarnoff finally agreed to pay Farnsworth royalties.

In 1932, while in England to raise money for his legal battles with RCA, Farnsworth met with John Logie Baird, a Scottish inventor who had given the world&#x27;s first public demonstration of a working television system in London in 1926, using an electro-mechanical imaging system, and who was seeking to develop electronic television receivers. Baird demonstrated his mechanical system for Farnsworth.

In May 1933, Philco severed its relationship with Farnsworth because, said Everson, &quot;it [had] become apparent that Philo&#x27;s aim at establishing a broad patent structure through research [was] not identical with the production program of Philco.&quot; In Everson&#x27;s view the decision was mutual and amicable. Farnsworth set up shop at 127 East Mermaid Lane in Philadelphia, and in 1934 held the first public exhibition of his device at the Franklin Institute in that city.

After sailing to Europe in 1934, Farnsworth secured an agreement with Goerz-Bosch-Fernseh in Germany. Some image dissector cameras were used to broadcast the 1936 Olympic Games in Berlin.

Farnsworth returned to his laboratory, and by 1936 his company was regularly transmitting entertainment programs on an experimental basis. That same year, while working with University of Pennsylvania biologists, Farnsworth developed a process to sterilize milk using radio waves. He also invented a fog-penetrating beam for ships and airplanes.

In 1936, he attracted the attention of &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, which described his work in glowing terms. &quot;One of those amazing facts of modern life that just don&#x27;t seem possible—namely, electrically scanned television that seems destined to reach your home next year, was largely given to the world by a nineteen-year-old boy from Utah ... Today, barely thirty years old he is setting the specialized world of science on its ears.&quot;

In 1938, Farnsworth established the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with E. A. Nicholas as president and himself as director of research. In September 1939, after a more than decade-long legal battle, RCA finally conceded to a multi-year licensing agreement concerning Farnsworth&#x27;s 1927 patent for television totaling $1 million. RCA was then free, after showcasing electronic television at New York World&#x27;s Fair on April 20, 1939, to sell electronic television cameras to the public.

Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation was purchased by International Telephone and Telegraph (ITT) in 1951. During his time at ITT, Farnsworth worked in a basement laboratory known as &quot;the cave&quot; on Pontiac Street in Fort Wayne. From there, he introduced a number of breakthrough concepts, including a defense early warning signal, submarine detection devices, radar calibration equipment and an infrared telescope. &quot;Philo was a very deep person—tough to engage in conversation, because he was always thinking about what he could do next&quot;, said Art Resler, an ITT photographer who documented Farnsworth&#x27;s work in pictures. One of Farnsworth&#x27;s most significant contributions at ITT was the PPI Projector, an enhancement on the iconic &quot;circular sweep&quot; radar display, which allowed safe air traffic control from the ground. This system developed in the 1950s was the forerunner of today&#x27;s air traffic control systems.

In addition to his electronics research, ITT management agreed to nominally fund Farnsworth&#x27;s nuclear fusion research. He and staff members invented and refined a series of fusion reaction tubes called &quot;fusors&quot;. For scientific reasons unknown to Farnsworth and his staff, the necessary reactions lasted no longer than thirty seconds. In December 1965, ITT came under pressure from its board of directors to terminate the expensive project and sell the Farnsworth subsidiary. It was only due to the urging of president Harold Geneen that the 1966 budget was accepted, extending ITT&#x27;s fusion research for an additional year. The stress associated with this managerial ultimatum, however, caused Farnsworth to suffer a relapse. A year later he was terminated and eventually allowed medical retirement.

In 1967, Farnsworth and his family moved back to Utah to continue his fusion research at Brigham Young University, which presented him with an honorary doctorate. The university also offered him office space and an underground concrete bunker for the project. Realizing ITT would dismantle its fusion lab, Farnsworth invited staff members to accompany him to Salt Lake City, as team members in Philo T. Farnsworth Associates (PTFA). By late 1968, the associates began holding regular business meetings and PTFA was underway. They promptly secured a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and more possibilities were within reach—but financing stalled for the $24,000 a month required for salaries and equipment rental.

In a 1996 videotaped interview by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences, Farnsworth&#x27;s wife recounted his change of heart about the value of television, after seeing Neil Armstrong becoming the first person to walk on the Moon in real time on July 20, 1969, along with millions of others: &quot;We were watching it, and, when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, Phil turned to me and said, &#x27;Pem, this has made it all worthwhile.&#x27; Before then, he wasn&#x27;t too sure.&quot;

By Christmas 1970, PTFA had failed to secure the necessary financing, and the Farnsworths had sold all their own ITT stock and cashed in Philo&#x27;s life insurance policy to maintain organizational stability. The underwriter had failed to provide the financial backing that was to have supported the organization during its critical first year. The banks called in all outstanding loans, repossession notices were placed on anything not previously sold, and the Internal Revenue Service put a lock on the laboratory door until delinquent taxes were paid. In January 1971, PTFA disbanded. 

Farnsworth had begun abusing alcohol in his later years, and as a result became seriously ill with pneumonia, and died on March 11, 1971, at his home in Holladay, Utah.

Farnsworth&#x27;s wife Elma Gardner &quot;Pem&quot; Farnsworth fought for decades after his death to assure his place in history. Farnsworth always gave her equal credit for creating television, saying, &quot;my wife and I started this TV.&quot; She died on April 27, 2006, at age 98. The inventor and wife were survived by two sons, Russell (then living in New York City), and Kent (then living in Fort Wayne, Indiana).

In 1999, &quot;Time&quot; magazine included Farnsworth in the &quot;&quot;Time&quot; 100: The Most Important People of the Century&quot;.

==Inventions==
===Electronic television===
Farnsworth worked out the principle of the image dissector in the summer of 1921, not long before his 15th birthday, and demonstrated the first working version on September 7, 1927, having turned 21 the previous August. A farm boy, his inspiration for scanning an image as a series of lines came from the back-and-forth motion used to plow a field. In the course of a patent interference suit brought by the Radio Corporation of America in 1934 and decided in February 1935, his high school chemistry teacher, Justin Tolman, produced a sketch he had made of a blackboard drawing Farnsworth had shown him in spring 1922. Farnsworth won the suit; RCA appealed the decision in 1936 and lost. Farnsworth received royalties from RCA, but he never became wealthy. The video camera tube that evolved from the combined work of Farnsworth, Zworykin, and many others was used in all television cameras until the late 20th century, when alternate technologies such as charge-coupled devices began to appear.

Farnsworth also developed the &quot;image oscillite&quot;, a cathode ray tube that displayed the images captured by the image dissector.

Farnsworth called his device an image dissector because it converted individual elements of the image into electricity one at a time. He replaced the spinning disks with cesium, an element that emits electrons when exposed to light.

In 1984, Farnsworth was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame.

===Fusor===
The Farnsworth fusor is an apparatus designed by Farnsworth to create nuclear fusion. Unlike most controlled fusion systems, which slowly heat a magnetically confined plasma, the fusor injects high-temperature ions directly into a reaction chamber, thereby avoiding a considerable amount of complexity.

When the Farnsworth fusor was first introduced to the fusion research world in the late 1960s, the fusor was the first device that could clearly demonstrate it was producing fusion reactions at all. Hopes at the time were high that it could be quickly developed into a practical power source. However, as with other fusion experiments, development into a power source has proven difficult. Nevertheless, the fusor has since become a practical neutron source and is produced commercially for this role.

===Other inventions===
At the time he died, Farnsworth held 300 U.S. and foreign patents. His inventions contributed to the development of radar, infra-red night vision devices, the electron microscope, the baby incubator, the gastroscope, and the astronomical telescope.

==TV appearance==
Although he was the man responsible for its technology, Farnsworth appeared only once on a television program. On July 3, 1957, he was a mystery guest (&quot;Doctor X&quot;) on the CBS quiz show &quot;I&#x27;ve Got A Secret&quot;. He fielded questions from the panel as they unsuccessfully tried to guess his secret (&quot;I invented electronic television.&quot;). For stumping the panel, he received $80 and a carton of Winston cigarettes. Host Garry Moore then spent a few minutes discussing with Farnsworth his research on such projects as an early analog high-definition television system, flat-screen receivers, and fusion power. Farnsworth said, &quot;There had been attempts to devise a television system using mechanical disks and rotating mirrors and vibrating mirrors—all mechanical. My contribution was to take out the moving parts and make the thing entirely electronic, and that was the concept that I had when I was just a freshman in high school in the Spring of 1921 at age 14.&quot;

A letter to the editor of the &quot;Idaho Falls Post Register&quot; disputed that Farnsworth had made only one television appearance. Roy Southwick claimed &quot;... I interviewed Mr. [Philo] Farnsworth back in 1953—the first day KID-TV went on the air.&quot; KID-TV, which later became KIDK-TV, was then located near the Rigby area where Farnsworth grew up.

==Fort Wayne sites==
In 2010, the former Farnsworth factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana, was razed, eliminating the &quot;cave,&quot; where many of Farnsworth&#x27;s inventions were first created, and where its radio and television receivers and transmitters, television tubes, and radio-phonographs were mass-produced under the Farnsworth, Capehart, and Panamuse trade names. The facility was located at 3702 E. Pontiac St.

Also that year, additional Farnsworth factory artifacts were added to the Fort Wayne History Center&#x27;s collection, including a radio-phonograph and three table-top radios from the 1940s, as well as advertising and product materials from the 1930s to the 1950s.

Farnsworth&#x27;s Fort Wayne residence from 1948 to 1967, then the former Philo T. Farnsworth Television Museum, stands at 734 E. State Blvd, on the southwest corner of E. State and St. Joseph Blvds. The residence is recognized by an Indiana state historical marker and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2013.

==Marion, Indiana factory==
In addition to Fort Wayne, Farnsworth operated a factory in Marion, Indiana, that made shortwave radios used by American combat soldiers in World War II. Acquired by 
RCA after the war, the facility was located at 3301 S. Adams St.

<text>An adjustable spanner (UK and most other English-speaking countries), also called a shifting spanner (Australia and New Zealand) or adjustable wrench (US and Canada), is any of various styles of spanner (wrench) with a movable jaw, allowing it to be used with different sizes of fastener head (nut, bolt, etc.) rather than just one fastener size, as with a conventional fixed spanner.

==Forms and names==

There are many forms of adjustable spanners; many of them are screw-adjusted, whereas others use levers, and some early ones used wedges. The early taper-locking spanners needed a hammer to set the movable jaw to the size of the nut. The modern screw-adjusted spanner and lever types are easily and quickly adjusted. Some adjustable spanners automatically adjust to the size of the nut, using a motor and battery. Simpler models use a serrated edge to lock the movable jaw to size, while more sophisticated versions are digital types that use sheets or feelers to set the size.

Geesin (2015) shows that wrenches with screw adjustment of various kinds were well known in the early 19th century and that one by William Barlow in 1808 was prescient. By the 1830s, many designs with a central screw and a lower jaw moved by a nut were well known. Geesin and others document that English engineers Richard Clyburn and Edwin Beard Budding presented some influential new designs in 1842 and 1843. The one by Clyburn had the form of thumbwheel screw with worm-on-rack arrangement that would later be the most famous via subsequent adaptations. Improvements followed. In 1885 Enoch Harris received US patent 326868 for his spanner that permitted both the jaw width and the angle of the handles to be adjusted and locked. 

One of the most widely known forms of adjustable wrench in the 21st century is an improved version of the Clyburn type; it was developed in 1891–1892. The Swedish company Bahco attributes its invention to Johan Petter Johansson, who in 1892 received a Swedish patent for it. In Canada and the United States, this type is often known as a Crescent wrench owing to widespread genericization of the brand name of the company that held the original 1915 U.S. patent for this type (), the Crescent Tool Company. (The Crescent brand is now owned by the Apex Tool Group). As Geesin 2015 documents, the worm-on-rack type (regardless of which terminology is used to name it) was invented in Britain, and later popularized in Scandinavia via the Bahco/Johansson improvement, before its manufacture in the United States was patented. The Bahco/Johansson/Crescent category (regardless of which terminology is used to name it) became so dominant in the 20th century that in North America, the very term &quot;adjustable wrench&quot; usually elicits the meaning of this type in general usage today, unless another type is specified. In Australia it is sometimes referred to as a &quot;shifting spanner&quot; or its abbreviated form of &quot;shifter&quot;.

Monkey wrenches are another type of adjustable spanner with a long history; the origin of the name is not entirely clear, but Geesin reports that it originated in Britain with a fancied resemblance of the wrench&#x27;s jaws to that of a monkey&#x27;s face, and that the many convoluted folk etymologies that later developed were baseless. Before the Bahco/Johansson/Crescent type became widespread in the United States, during the industrial era of the 1860s to the 1910s, various monkey wrench types were the dominant form of adjustable wrench there. 

Another popular type of adjustable spanner has a base and jaws that form four sides of a hexagon, and is therefore particularly suited for hexagonal nuts (&quot;hex nuts&quot;) and hexagonal headed (&quot;hex head&quot;) cap screws and bolts.

In some parts of Europe, adjustable spanners are often called a Bahco, owing to genericization of the name of the Bahco/Johansson type. In Denmark, this type of spanner is commonly referred to as a &quot;svensknøgle&quot;, which basically translates to Swedish key. The Swedes themselves call the key &quot;skiftnyckel&quot;, which is translated into adjustable key (shifting key). In Australia, adjustable spanners are also referred to as &quot;shifters&quot;. In Spain, this kind of spanner is commonly called &quot;llave inglesa&quot;, which means literally English key. Remarking the difference with the pipe wrench, also adjustable, in Spain this one is called &quot;grifa&quot;, and it does not have any accurate translation. 

==Design and use==
The fixed jaw can withstand bending stress far better than can the movable jaw, because the latter is supported only by the flat surfaces on either side of the guide slot, not the full thickness of the tool. The tool is therefore usually angled so that the movable jaw&#x27;s area of contact is closer to the body of the tool, which means less bending stress. Still, one should avoid applying excessive force on tight bolts, since doing so can pry open the mounting of the movable jaw causing the wrench to no longer be able to be snugged to bolt heads, loosen too easily, or mar bolt heads. In some cases the jaws of the tool can break.

<doc id="42895" wikidata="Q220843" url="?curid=42895" title="Walvis Bay">
<text>Walvis Bay (; ; ) is a city in Namibia and the name of the bay on which it lies. It is the second largest city in Namibia and the largest coastal city in the country. The city covers an area of of land.
The bay is a safe haven for sea vessels because of its natural deep-water harbour, protected by the Pelican Point sand spit, being the only natural harbour of any size along the country&#x27;s coast. Being rich in plankton and marine life, these waters also draw large numbers of southern right whales, attracting whalers and fishing vessels.

A succession of colonists developed the location and resources of this strategic harbour settlement. The harbour&#x27;s value in relation to the sea route around the Cape of Good Hope had caught the attention of world powers since it was discovered by the outside world in 1485. The importance of the harbour, combined with its extreme isolation by land, explains the complicated political history of the town. For much of its history, Walvis Bay was governed as an exclave separate from the rest of the territory that today is Namibia.

The town is situated just north of the Tropic of Capricorn in the Kuiseb River delta and lies at the end of the TransNamib Railway to Windhoek, and on B2 road.

Walvis Bay, with its large bay and sand dunes, is an important centre of tourism activity in Namibia. Attractions include the artificial Bird Island, centre of a guano collection industry, the Dune 7 sand dune, the salt works, the abundant birdlife, and a museum. Kuisebmund Stadium, home to two clubs in the Namibia Premier League, is also located in the city. The beach resort of Langstrand lies just a few kilometres north. The Walvis Bay Export Processing Zone is an important facet of the local economy.

== Etymology ==
The Dutch referred to it as and the English as &quot;Whale Bay&quot;. In its eventual formal incorporation, it was named &quot;Walfish Bay&quot;, which was changed to &quot;Walvish Bay&quot;, and ultimately to &quot;Walvis Bay&quot;. It has also been referred to as &quot;Walwich Bay&quot; or &quot;Walwisch Bay&quot;. The Herero people of the area called it .

== History ==

Portuguese navigator Diogo Cão reached Cape Cross, north of the bay, in 1485. There followed Bartolomeu Dias, who anchored his flagship &quot;São Cristóvão&quot; in what is now Walvis Bay on 8 December 1487, on his expedition to discover a sea route to the East via the Cape of Good Hope. He named the bay &quot;O Golfo de Santa Maria da Conceição&quot;. However, the Portuguese did not formally stake a claim to Walvis Bay.

Walvis Bay was founded at the end of the 18th century as a stopover for sea travel between Cape Town and the Netherlands by the Dutch East India Company. No permanent (year round) settlement was attempted and little commercial development occurred on the site until the late 19th century. In the meantime, the Cape Colony had become British, and during the Scramble for Africa, the British claimed Walvis Bay. They permitted the Cape Colony to complete the annexation of the territory in 1884, together with the Penguin Islands, following initial steps which had been taken in 1878.

In 1910, Walvis Bay, as part of the Cape Colony, became part of the newly formed Union of South Africa. Subsequently, a dispute arose with Germany over the exclave&#x27;s boundaries, which was eventually settled in 1911, with Walvis Bay being allocated an area of .
The exclave was overrun by the Germans during the South West Africa Campaign early in the First World War, but the Union Defence Force (UDF) of South Africa eventually ousted the Germans in 1915. Subsequently, Walvis Bay was quickly integrated into the new martial law regime in South West Africa.

South Africa was later awarded control (a Class &quot;C&quot; mandate) over South West Africa by the League of Nations to administer the territory. Civilian rule was restored in South West Africa in 1921 and administration of Walvis Bay was transferred to South West Africa under the South West Africa Affairs Act of 1922.

Despite the territory never having been part of German South West Africa, the Act stated that: &quot;the port and settlement of Walvis Bay, which forms part of the Cape of Good Hope, shall for judicial and administrative purposes be regarded as if it were part of the mandated territory of South West Africa&quot;. However, South Africa had also sought to annex South West Africa itself, and had presented such a proposal to the League of Nations. Consequently, in 1949, the Act was amended to give representation in the Parliament of South Africa to whites in South West Africa.

On 14 December 1971 the Namibian general contract workers strike began in Walvis Bay, after starting the day before in Windhoek. The goal of the strike was the abolition of the contract labour system, to oppose apartheid, and promote Namibia&#x27;s independence.

In 1977, following increasing international pressure to relinquish its control over South West Africa, South Africa repealed the Act, but transferred control of Walvis Bay back to the Cape Province, thereby making it an exclave. From 1980, it was represented in both the Provincial Council and the House of Assembly as part of the Green Point constituency in Cape Town, before becoming a separate constituency in 1982.

In response, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 432 (1978), which declared that &quot;the territorial integrity and unity of Namibia must be assured through the reintegration of Walvis Bay within its territory&quot;.

In 1990, South West Africa gained independence as Namibia, but Walvis Bay remained under South African sovereignty, with South Africa increasing the number of troops. However, in 1992, the two countries agreed to establish a transitional Joint Administrative Authority for Walvis Bay and the Offshore Islands. The Authority was headed by two Chief Executive Officers, Nangolo Mbumba, then Secretary to the Namibian Cabinet, and Carl von Hirschberg, former South African Ambassador to the United Nations.

In August 1993, prior to the end of apartheid, the Multiparty Negotiating Forum in South Africa passed a resolution calling for &quot;the incorporation-reintegration of Walvis Bay and the Off-Shore Islands into Namibia.&quot;
The Transfer of Walvis Bay to Namibia Act was passed by the Parliament of South Africa that year. Following the signing of a treaty between the two countries, South Africa formally transferred sovereignty of Walvis Bay and the Penguin Islands to Namibia on 1 March 1994.

== Geography ==

=== Suburbs ===
Due to its South African administration Walvis Bay was developed as a segregated town. The suburb of Kuisebmond, located 3.2 kilometres (1.8 mi) from Walvis Bay city centre, housed Black people; Narraville, located 3.3 kilometres (2 mi) from Walvis Bay city centre, was inhabited by Coloureds; and Whites lived in the city centre.

After the incorporation of the town into Namibia, many people have settled in shacks around it. In an effort to reduce the impact of the informal settlements, the municipality formed the Tutaleni Housing Project to the northeast.

=== Climate ===
Despite its location within the tropics, Walvis Bay features the very rare mild variation of the cold desert climate (&quot;BWk&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification. It is caused by the rain shadow of the Naukluft Mountains and the cooling effect of the coastal sea temperature by the Benguela Current. Walvis Bay receives only average precipitation per year, making it one of the driest cities on earth. Despite its dry climate, the city is relatively humid. Average relative humidity throughout the year remains above 80%. The warmest month is February with average temperature , while the coolest months are August and September with average temperature . The diurnal temperature range is also low, averaging only .

A weather station operated on the Pelican Point headland from 1958 to 1984. Unusually, the highest temperatures are not recorded during the summer; autumn, spring, and even winter have all seen higher temperatures than the hottest days in summer. These record highs occur when offshore winds blow downwards from the high plateau inland and are nonetheless mild by comparison to many other cities in the tropics at the same latitude. Higher temperatures have been recorded, even just slightly inland, such as a report of at the airport on 15 April 2016.


== Demographics ==
== Economy ==

=== Tourism ===
Tourism has had an increasing influence in the town&#x27;s economy, with international tourists arriving at its airport and port facilities. Several cruise liners visit the port each year. With many tourism activities hosted by small and large tour operators the town has turned into a tourism destination.

=== Fishing ===
In Walvis Bay there are a variety of fishing companies like Hangana Seafood, Caroline Fishing, Benguella Fishing Company, Cadilu Fishing, Etosha Fisheries, Kuiseb Fishing Enterprises, Blue Ocean Products, Benguella Sea Products, Consortium Fisheries, Talanam Fish Processor. These companies catch diverse types of fish, like snoek, horse mackerel, anchovy, white steenbras, kabeljou, kingklip, hake, catfish, tuna, and sardines. Hangana Seafood are processors and exporters of fish and fish products. As such, the fishing enterprise accounts for a major part of Walvis Bay&#x27;s economy.

In May 2018, a spokesman for the National Fishing Corporation of Namibia (Fishcor), confirmed that a new N$530 million onshore processing plant would be operational by September 2018. After completion, the factory (which plans to employ 700 people of which 70% will be female), promises to be the largest pelagic processing plant in sub-Saharan Africa and will process about 80 000 tonnes of fish per annum.

=== Manufacturing ===

In March 2018, the Namibian government in association with French Groupe PSA signed an investment agreement to initiate a joint-venture to assemble Opel and Peugeot vehicles in Walvis Bay. The N$190m-project has been earmarked to commence in 2018 with a forecasted annual target volume of 5000 units by 2020, a target carried by SACU countries&#x27; market demand. However, Peugeot threatened to close the plant over disputes with South Africa over import tariffs.

&quot;Walvis Bay Salt&quot; produces approximately 1 million tons of salt per year through solar evaporation of sea water. Most of the salt is for industrial use but the company also produces table salt under the &quot;Cerebos&quot; brand.

== Transport ==

Walvis Bay is an important logistical port for the southern African region, providing port facilities for the import and export of cargo for the rest of Namibia, Zambia, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Botswana. Since the Walvis Bay Corridor Group (WBCG) was established in 2000, cargo moving through the port has increased from 30,000 containers a year to 370,000 containers in 2016. As of 2017 the port was being upgraded to increase its capacity to move 1 million containers a year by 2019. Bureaucratic and logistical problems at the city&#x27;s competitor port at Durban, South Africa have diverted traffic to the port at Walvis Bay. Ninety-five percent of all cargo hauled overland through Walvis Bay is carried by truck.

The Walvis Bay Corridor Group is gearing up to increase import/export-business opportunities in Namibia. The Namibian National Development Plan expects to complete the expansion programme of the Walvis Bay port by 2019. Because of the harbour&#x27;s geographical positioning, authorities plan to gain a footprint in providing landlocked Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries with a vital logistical hub. In addition to the importance of the port, development would strengthen trade corridors which consists of current road and rail networks.

In an attempt to strengthen and enhance trade relations between other African countries, Namport (the Namibian Port Authority) in April 2019 signed a five-year MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) with the Port Authority of Dakar, Senegal.

Walvis Bay International Airport provides commercial flight services to the city&#x27;s residents, as well as to neighbouring towns and villages. Airlink services flights between South Africa and Walvis Bay.

In August 2019, a new container terminal was opened, built on a 40-acre platform reclaimed from the sea. The terminal was built by the state-owned China Harbour Engineering Company with funds from the Namibian government and the African Development Bank, costing N$4.2b.

This increases the capacity of the port to 750,000 containers per year from 350,000. The terminal also includes a dedicated cruise liner berth.

== Education ==

Walvis Bay has a number of public (government-run), semi-public, and private schools. Among them are Duneside High School, Duinesig Primary School, International School of Walvis Bay, The Dolphin Schools, Alexanders Private School, Kuisebmond Secondary School, Walvis Bay Private School and others. A number of kindergartens cater to young children.

The Namibian Maritime and Fisheries Institute (NAMFI) is a tertiary education institution based in town. International University of Management (IUM), Welwitchia Health Training Center and Monitronics Success College both have branches in Walvis Bay.

== Politics ==

Walvis Bay is governed by a municipal council that has ten seats.

=== Election results ===

The 2015 local authority election was won by the SWAPO party which gained eight seats (5,818 votes). One seat each was won by the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA, 565 votes) and the United Democratic Front (UDF, 433 votes).

The 2020 local authority election was won by the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), an opposition party formed in August 2020. The IPC obtained 5,043 votes and gained four seats. SWAPO was the runner-up, obtaining 3,348 votes and gaining three seats. One seat each went to the Landless People&#x27;s Movement (LPM, a new party registered in 2018, 1,207 votes), the local Joint Walvis Bay Residents Association with 945 votes, and the Popular Democratic Movement (PDM, the new name of the DTA) with 658 votes.

On 28 November 2024, Trevino Forbes of IPC was re-elected as the mayor of Walvis Bay at a special council meeting.

<text>A viscometer (also called viscosimeter) is an instrument used to measure the viscosity of a fluid. For liquids with viscosities which vary with flow conditions, an instrument called a rheometer is used. Thus, a rheometer can be considered as a special type of viscometer. Viscometers can measure only constant viscosity, that is, viscosity that does not change with flow conditions.

In general, either the fluid remains stationary and an object moves through it, or the object is stationary and the fluid moves past it. The drag caused by relative motion of the fluid and a surface is a measure of the viscosity. The flow conditions must have a sufficiently small value of Reynolds number for there to be laminar flow.

At 20°C, the dynamic viscosity (kinematic viscosity × density) of water is 1.0038mPa·s and its kinematic viscosity (product of flow time × factor) is 1.0022mm2/s. These values are used for calibrating certain types of viscometers.

==Standard laboratory viscometers for liquids==
===U-tube viscometers===
These devices are also known as glass capillary viscometers or Ostwald viscometers, named after Wilhelm Ostwald. Another version is the Ubbelohde viscometer, which consists of a U-shaped glass tube held vertically in a controlled temperature bath. In one arm of the U is a vertical section of precise narrow bore (the capillary). Above there is a bulb, with it is another bulb lower down on the other arm. In use, liquid is drawn into the upper bulb by suction, then allowed to flow down through the capillary into the lower bulb. Two marks (one above and one below the upper bulb) indicate a known volume. The time taken for the level of the liquid to pass between these marks is proportional to the kinematic viscosity. The calibration can be done using a fluid of known properties. Most commercial units are provided with a conversion factor.

The time required for the test liquid to flow through a capillary of a known diameter of a certain factor between two marked points is measured. By multiplying the time taken by the factor of the viscometer, the kinematic viscosity is obtained.

Such viscometers can be classified as direct-flow or reverse-flow. Reverse-flow viscometers have the reservoir above the markings, and direct-flow are those with the reservoir below the markings. Such classifications exist so that the level can be determined even when opaque or staining liquids are measured, otherwise the liquid will cover the markings and make it impossible to gauge the time the level passes the mark. This also allows the viscometer to have more than 1 set of marks to allow , therefore yielding 2 timings and allowing subsequent calculation of determinability to ensure accurate results. The use of two timings in one viscometer in a single run is only possible if the sample being measured has Newtonian properties. Otherwise the change in driving head, which in turn changes the shear rate, will produce a different viscosity for the two bulbs.

===Falling-sphere viscometers===

Stokes&#x27; law is the basis of the falling-sphere viscometer, in which the fluid is stationary in a vertical glass tube. A sphere of known size and density is allowed to descend through the liquid. If correctly selected, it reaches terminal velocity, which can be measured by the time it takes to pass two marks on the tube. Electronic sensing can be used for opaque fluids. Knowing the terminal velocity, the size and density of the sphere, and the density of the liquid, Stokes&#x27; law can be used to calculate the viscosity of the fluid. A series of steel ball bearings of different diameter are normally used in the classic experiment to improve the accuracy of the calculation. The school experiment uses glycerol as the fluid, and the technique is used industrially to check the viscosity of fluids used in processes. It includes many different oils and polymer liquids .

In 1851, George Gabriel Stokes derived an expression for the frictional force (also called drag force) exerted on spherical objects with very small Reynolds numbers (e.g., very small particles) in a continuous viscous fluid by changing the small fluid-mass limit of the generally unsolvable Navier–Stokes equations:

: formula_1

where
: &quot;formula_2&quot; is the frictional force,
: &quot;formula_3&quot; is the radius of the spherical object,
: &quot;formula_4&quot; is the fluid viscosity,
: &quot;formula_5&quot; is the particle velocity.

If the particles are falling in the viscous fluid by their own weight, then a terminal velocity, also known as the settling velocity, is reached when this frictional force combined with the buoyant force exactly balance the gravitational force. The resulting settling velocity (or terminal velocity) is given by

: formula_6

where:
: is the particle settling velocity (m/s), vertically downwards if , upwards if ,
: is the Stokes radius of the particle (m),
: is the gravitational acceleration (m/s2),
: is the density of the particles (kg/m3),
: is the density of the fluid (kg/m3),
: is the (dynamic) fluid viscosity (Pa·s).

Note that Stokes flow is assumed, so the Reynolds number must be small.

A limiting factor on the validity of this result is the roughness of the sphere being used.

A modification of the straight falling-sphere viscometer is a rolling-ball viscometer, which times a ball rolling down a slope whilst immersed in the test fluid. This can be further improved by using a patented V plate, which increases the number of rotations to distance traveled, allowing smaller, more portable devices. The controlled rolling motion of the ball avoids turbulences in the fluid, which would otherwise occur with a falling ball. This type of device is also suitable for ship board use.

==Falling-piston viscometer==
Also known as the Norcross viscometer after its inventor, Austin Norcross. The principle of viscosity measurement in this rugged and sensitive industrial device is based on a piston and cylinder assembly. The piston is periodically raised by an air lifting mechanism, drawing the material being measured down through the clearance (gap) between the piston and the wall of the cylinder into the space formed below the piston as it is raised. The assembly is then typically held up for a few seconds, then allowed to fall by gravity, expelling the sample out through the same path that it entered, creating a shearing effect on the measured liquid, which makes this viscometer particularly sensitive and good for measuring certain thixotropic liquids. The time of fall is a measure of viscosity, with the clearance between the piston and inside of the cylinder forming the measuring orifice. The viscosity controller measures the time of fall (time-of-fall seconds being the measure of viscosity) and displays the resulting viscosity value. The controller can calibrate the time-of-fall value to cup seconds (known as efflux cup), Saybolt universal second (SUS) or centipoise.

Industrial use is popular due to simplicity, repeatability, low maintenance and longevity. This type of measurement is not affected by flow rate or external vibrations. The principle of operation can be adapted for many different conditions, making it ideal for process control environments.

==Oscillating-piston viscometer==
Sometimes referred to as electromagnetic viscometer or EMV viscometer, was invented at Cambridge Viscosity (Formally Cambridge Applied Systems) in 1986. The sensor (see figure below) comprises a measurement chamber and magnetically influenced piston. Measurements are taken whereby a sample is first introduced into the thermally controlled measurement chamber where the piston resides. Electronics drive the piston into oscillatory motion within the measurement chamber with a controlled magnetic field. A shear stress is imposed on the liquid (or gas) due to the piston travel, and the viscosity is determined by measuring the travel time of the piston. The construction parameters for the annular spacing between the piston and measurement chamber, the strength of the electromagnetic field, and the travel distance of the piston are used to calculate the viscosity according to Newton&#x27;s law of viscosity.

The oscillating-piston viscometer technology has been adapted for small-sample viscosity and micro-sample viscosity testing in laboratory applications. It has also been adapted to high-pressure viscosity and high-temperature viscosity measurements in both laboratory and process environments. The viscosity sensors have been scaled for a wide range of industrial applications, such as small-size viscometers for use in compressors and engines, flow-through viscometers for dip coating processes, in-line viscometers for use in refineries, and hundreds of other applications. Improvements in sensitivity from modern electronics, is stimulating a growth in oscillating-piston viscometer popularity with academic laboratories exploring gas viscosity.

==Vibrational viscometers==
Vibrational viscometers date back to the 1950s Bendix instrument, which is of a class that operates by measuring the damping of an oscillating electromechanical resonator immersed in a fluid whose viscosity is to be determined. The resonator generally oscillates in torsion or transversely (as a cantilever beam or tuning fork). The higher the viscosity, the larger the damping imposed on the resonator. The resonator&#x27;s damping may be measured by one of several methods:

# Measuring the power input necessary to keep the oscillator vibrating at a constant amplitude. The higher the viscosity, the more power is needed to maintain the amplitude of oscillation.
# Measuring the decay time of the oscillation once the excitation is switched off. The higher the viscosity, the faster the signal decays.
# Measuring the frequency of the resonator as a function of phase angle between excitation and response waveforms. The higher the viscosity, the larger the frequency change for a given phase change.

The vibrational instrument also suffers from a lack of a defined shear field, which makes it unsuited to measuring the viscosity of a fluid whose flow behaviour is not known beforehand.

Vibrating viscometers are rugged industrial systems used to measure viscosity in the process condition. The active part of the sensor is a vibrating rod. The vibration amplitude varies according to the viscosity of the fluid in which the rod is immersed. These viscosity meters are suitable for measuring clogging fluid and high-viscosity fluids, including those with fibers (up to 1000 Pa·s). Currently, many industries around the world consider these viscometers to be the most efficient system with which to measure the viscosities of a wide range of fluids; by contrast, rotational viscometers require more maintenance, are unable to measure clogging fluid, and require frequent calibration after intensive use. Vibrating viscometers have no moving parts, no weak parts and the sensitive part is typically small. Even very basic or acidic fluids can be measured by adding a protective coating, such as enamel, or by changing the material of the sensor to a material such as 316L stainless steel. Vibrating viscometers are the most widely used inline instrument to monitor the viscosity of the process fluid in tanks, and pipes.

===Quartz viscometer===
The quartz viscometer is a special type of vibrational viscometer. Here, an oscillating quartz crystal is immersed into a fluid and the specific influence on the oscillating behavior defines the viscosity. The principle of quartz viscosimetry is based on the idea of W. P. Mason. The basic concept is the application of a piezoelectric crystal for the determination of viscosity. The high-frequency electric field that is applied to the oscillator causes a movement of the sensor and results in the shearing of the fluid. The movement of the sensor is then influenced by the external forces (the shear stress) of the fluid, which affects the electrical response of the sensor. The calibration procedure as a pre-condition of viscosity determination by means of a quartz crystal goes back to B. Bode, who facilitated the detailed analysis of the electrical and mechanical transmission behavior of the oscillating system. On the basis of this calibration, the quartz viscosimeter was developed which allows continuous viscosity determination in resting and flowing liquids.

==== Quartz crystal microbalance ====
The quartz crystal microbalance functions as a vibrational viscometer by the piezoelectric properties inherent in quartz to perform measurements of conductance spectra of liquids and thin films exposed to the surface of the crystal. From these spectra, frequency shifts and a broadening of the peaks for the resonant and overtone frequencies of the quartz crystal are tracked and used to determine changes in mass as well as the viscosity, shear modulus, and other viscoelastic properties of the liquid or thin film. One benefit of using the quartz crystal microbalance to measure viscosity is the small amount of sample required for obtaining an accurate measurement. However, due to the dependence viscoelastic properties on the sample preparation techniques and thickness of the film or bulk liquid, there can be errors up to 10% in measurements in viscosity between samples.

An interesting technique to measure the viscosity of a liquid using a quartz crystal microbalance which improves the consistency of measurements uses a drop method. Instead of creating a thin film or submerging the quartz crystal in a liquid, a single drop of the fluid of interest is dropped on the surface of the crystal. The viscosity is extracted from the shift in the frequency data using the following equation

formula_7

where formula_8 is the resonant frequency, formula_9 is the density of the fluid, formula_10 is the shear modulus of the quartz, and formula_11 is the density of the quartz. An extension of this technique corrects the shift in the resonant frequency by the size of the drop deposited on the quartz crystal.

==Rotational viscometers==
Rotational viscometers use the idea that the torque required to rotate an object in a fluid is a function of the viscosity of that fluid. They measure the torque required to rotate a disk or bob in a fluid at a known speed.

&quot;Cup and bob&quot; viscometers work by defining the exact volume of a sample to be sheared within a test cell; the torque required to achieve a certain rotational speed is measured and plotted. There are two classical geometries in &quot;cup and bob&quot; viscometers, known as either the &quot;Couette&quot; or &quot;Searle&quot; systems, distinguished by whether the cup or bob rotates. The rotating cup is preferred in some cases because it reduces the onset of Taylor vortices at very high shear rates, but the rotating bob is more commonly used, as the instrument design can be more flexible for other geometries as well.

&quot;Cone and plate&quot; viscometers use a narrow-angled cone in close proximity to a flat plate. With this system, the shear rate between the geometries is constant at any given rotational speed. The viscosity can easily be calculated from shear stress (from the torque) and shear rate (from the angular velocity).

If a test with any geometries runs through a table of several shear rates or stresses, the data can be used to plot a flow curve, that is a graph of viscosity vs shear rate. If the above test is carried out slowly enough for the measured value (shear stress if rate is being controlled, or conversely) to reach a steady value at each step, the data is said to be at &quot;equilibrium&quot;, and the graph is then an &quot;equilibrium flow curve&quot;. This is preferable over non-equilibrium measurements, as the data can usually be replicated across multiple other instruments or with other geometries.

===Calculation of shear rate and shear stress form factors===
Rheometers and viscometers work with torque and angular velocity. Since viscosity is normally considered in terms of shear stress and shear rates, a method is needed to convert from &quot;instrument numbers&quot; to &quot;rheology numbers&quot;. Each measuring system used in an instrument has its associated &quot;form factors&quot; to convert torque to shear stress and to convert angular velocity to shear rate.

We will call the shear stress form factor and the shear rate factor .

: shear stress = torque ÷ .
: shear rate = × angular velocity.
:: For some measuring systems such as parallel plates, the user can set the gap between the measuring systems. In this case the equation used is
::: shear rate = × angular velocity / gap.
: viscosity = shear stress / shear rate.

The following sections show how the form factors are calculated for each measuring system.

====Cone and plate====
: formula_12

where
: is the radius of the cone,
: is the cone angle in radians.

====Parallel plates====
: formula_13

where is the radius of the plate.

Note: The shear stress varies across the radius for a parallel plate. The above formula refers to the 3/4 radius position if the test sample is Newtonian.

====Coaxial cylinders====
: formula_14

where:
: is the average radius,
: is the inner radius,
: is the outer radius,
: is the height of cylinder.

Note: takes the shear stress as that occurring at an average radius .

===Electromagnetically spinning-sphere viscometer (EMS viscometer)===
The EMS viscometer measures the viscosity of liquids through observation of the rotation of a sphere driven by electromagnetic interaction: Two magnets attached to a rotor create a rotating magnetic field. The sample ③ to be measured is in a small test tube ②. Inside the tube is an aluminium sphere ④. The tube is located in a temperature-controlled chamber ① and set such that the sphere is situated in the centre of the two magnets.

The rotating magnetic field induces eddy currents in the sphere. The resulting Lorentz interaction between the magnetic field and these eddy currents generate torque that rotates the sphere. The rotational speed of the sphere depends on the rotational velocity of the magnetic field, the magnitude of the magnetic field and the viscosity of the sample around the sphere. The motion of the sphere is monitored by a video camera ⑤ located below the cell. The torque applied to the sphere is proportional to the difference in the angular velocity of the magnetic field and the one of the sphere . There is thus a linear relationship between and the viscosity of the liquid.

This new measuring principle was developed by Sakai et al. at the University of Tokyo. The EMS viscometer distinguishes itself from other rotational viscometers by three main characteristics: 
* All parts of the viscometer that come in direct contact with the sample are disposable and inexpensive.
* The measurements are performed in a sealed sample vessel.
* The EMS viscometer requires only very small sample quantities (0.3 mL).

===Stabinger viscometer===
By modifying the classic Couette-type rotational viscometer, it is possible to combine the accuracy of kinematic viscosity determination with a wide measuring range.

The outer cylinder of the Stabinger viscometer is a sample-filled tube that rotates at constant speed in a temperature-controlled copper housing. The hollow internal cylinder – shaped as a conical rotor – is centered within the sample by hydrodynamic lubrication effects and centrifugal forces. In this way all bearing friction, an inevitable factor in most rotational devices, is fully avoided. The rotating fluid&#x27;s shear forces drive the rotor, while a magnet inside the rotor forms an eddy current brake with the surrounding copper housing. An equilibrium rotor speed is established between driving and retarding forces, which is an unambiguous measure of the dynamic viscosity. The speed and torque measurement is implemented without direct contact by a Hall-effect sensor counting the frequency of the rotating magnetic field. This allows a highly precise torque resolution of 50 pN·m and a wide measuring range from 0.2 to 30,000 mPa·s with a single measuring system. A built-in density measurement based on the oscillating U-tube principle allows the determination of kinematic viscosity from the measured dynamic viscosity employing the relation
: formula_15

where:
: is the kinematic viscosity (mm2/s),
: is the dynamic viscosity (mPa·s),
: is the density (g/cm3).

==Bubble viscometer==
Bubble viscometers are used to quickly determine kinematic viscosity of known liquids such as resins and varnishes. The time required for an air bubble to rise is directly proportional to the viscosity of the liquid, so the faster the bubble rises, the lower the viscosity. The alphabetical-comparison method uses 4 sets of lettered reference tubes, A5 through Z10, of known viscosity to cover a viscosity range from 0.005 to 1,000 stokes. The direct-time method uses a single 3-line times tube for determining the &quot;bubble seconds&quot;, which may then be converted to stokes.

This method is considerably accurate, but the measurements can vary due to variances in buoyancy because of the changing in shape of the bubble in the tube. However, this does not cause any sort of serious miscalculation.

==Rectangular-slit viscometer==
The basic design of a rectangular-slit viscometer/rheometer consists of a rectangular-slit channel with uniform cross-sectional area. A test liquid is pumped at a constant flow rate through this channel. Multiple pressure sensors flush-mounted at linear distances along the stream-wise direction measure pressure drop as depicted in the figure:

Measuring principle: The slit viscometer/rheometer is based on the fundamental principle that a viscous liquid resists flow, exhibiting a decreasing pressure along the length of the slit. The pressure decrease or drop () is correlated with the shear stress at the wall boundary. The apparent shear rate is directly related to the flow rate and the dimension of the slit. The apparent shear rate, the shear stress, and the apparent viscosity are calculated:

: formula_16

where
: formula_17 is the apparent shear rate (s−1),
: is the shear stress (Pa),
: is the apparent viscosity (Pa·s),
: is the pressure difference between the leading pressure sensor and the last pressure sensor (Pa),
: is the flow rate (ml/s),
: is the width of the flow channel (mm),
: is the depth of the flow channel (mm),
: is the distance between the leading pressure sensor and the last pressure sensor (mm).

To determine the viscosity of a liquid, the liquid sample is pumped through the slit channel at a constant flow rate, and the pressure drop is measured. Following these equations, the apparent viscosity is calculated for the apparent shear rate. For a Newtonian liquid, the apparent viscosity is the same as the true viscosity, and the single shear-rate measurement is sufficient. For non-Newtonian liquids, the apparent viscosity is not true viscosity. In order to obtain true viscosity, the apparent viscosities are measured at multiple apparent shear rates. Then true viscosities at various shear rates are calculated using Weissenberg–Rabinowitsch–Mooney correction factor:

: formula_18

The calculated true viscosity is the same as the cone and plate values at the same shear rate.

A modified version of the rectangular-slit viscometer/rheometer can also be used to determine apparent extensional viscosity.

==Krebs Viscometer==
The Krebs Viscometer uses a digital graph and a small sidearm spindle to measure the viscosity of a fluid. It is mostly used in the paint industry.

==Miscellaneous viscometer types==
Other viscometer types use balls or other objects. Viscometers that can characterize non-Newtonian fluids are usually called &quot;rheometers&quot; or &quot;plastometers&quot;. Some instruments like capillary or VROC® viscometers can measure both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.

In the I.C.I &quot;Oscar&quot; viscometer, a sealed can of fluid was oscillated torsionally, and by clever measurement techniques it was possible to measure both viscosity and elasticity in the sample.

The Marsh funnel viscometer measures viscosity from the time (&quot;efflux time&quot;) it takes a known volume of liquid to flow from the base of a cone through a short tube. This is similar in principle to the flow cups (efflux cups) like the Ford, Zahn and Shell cups which use different shapes to the cone and various nozzle sizes. The measurements can be done according to ISO 2431, ASTM D1200 - 10 or DIN 53411. 

The flexible-blade rheometer improves the accuracy of measurements for the lower-viscosity liquids utilizing the subtle changes in the flow field due to the flexibility of the moving or stationary blade (sometimes called wing or single-side-clamped cantilever).

A rotating disk viscometer is the standard viscometer for measuring material viscosity and scorch time for rubber before vulcanization.

<text>Alexander Dubček (; 27 November 1921 – 7 November 1992) was a Slovak statesman who served as the First Secretary of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ) (&quot;de facto&quot; leader of Czechoslovakia) from January 1968 to April 1969 and as Chairman of the Federal Assembly from 1989 to 1992 following the Velvet Revolution. He oversaw significant reforms to the communist system during a period that became known as the Prague Spring, but his reforms were reversed and he was eventually sidelined following the Warsaw Pact invasion in August 1968.

Best known by the slogan, &quot;Socialism with a human face&quot;, Dubček led a process that accelerated cultural and economic liberalization in Czechoslovakia. Reforms were opposed by conservatives inside the party who benefited from the Stalinist economy, as well as interests in the neighbouring Soviet-bloc who feared contagion, western subversion, strategic vulnerability, and loss of institutional power. For reasons of institutional interests in the Soviet Union such as those of the military and KGB, false reports, and the growing concern among the Soviet leadership that Dubček was no longer able to maintain control of the country, Czechoslovakia was invaded by half a million Soviet-led Warsaw Pact troops on the night of 20–21 August 1968. This was intended to enable a coup by conservative forces. That coup, however, could not materialize due to lack of a viable pro-Soviet replacement leadership and the unexpected extraordinary popularity of Dubček and the reformist leadership. Soviet intervention ushered in a period of maneuver between conservatives and reformers where conservatives relied on Soviet influence to shift the balance of power, reversing reforms of the Prague Spring.

Dubček was forced to resign as party head in April 1969, succeeded by Gustáv Husák, a former reformer and victim of Stalinism who was ambiguously favored by Moscow. This signaled the end of the Prague Spring and the beginning of normalization. Dubček was expelled from the Communist Party in 1970, amid a purge that eventually expelled almost two-thirds of the 1968 party membership. This mostly purged the younger generation of post-Stalin communists that he represented along with many of the most competent technical experts and managers.

During the Velvet Revolution in 1989, Dubček served as the Chairman of the federal Czechoslovak parliament and contended for the presidency with Václav Havel. The European Parliament awarded Dubček the Sakharov Prize the same year. In the interim between the Prague Spring and the Velvet Revolution, Dubček withdrew from high politics but served as a leading inspiration and symbolic leader for Eurocommunism, maintaining intermittent contact with European communist reformers, especially in Italy and the Soviet Union. Also in 1989, just before his death, Andrei Sakharov wrote, &quot;I am convinced that the &#x27;breath of freedom&#x27; which the Czechs and the Slovaks enjoyed when Dubček was their leader was a prologue to the peaceful revolutions now taking place in eastern Europe and Czechoslovakia itself.&quot; Sakharov credited Dubček and the Prague Spring as his inspiration.

At the time of his death in an automobile crash in 1992, Dubček remained an important political figure. Many saw him as the destined future president of newly-formed Slovakia. Since that time, his life and work have been significantly re-evaluated. This comes after long being over-shadowed by simplistic cold war narratives and rhetoric. According to Jan Adamec, a historical scholar based in Prague: &quot;I think there is a trend that became apparent around 2009, and became even more visible after Václav Havel&#x27;s death, which shows certain reconsideration of the period between 1968 and 1989. The picture is becoming more diverse, and is no longer as black and white as it was in the 1990s – the communist evil and the fearful, suppressed society. The picture is now gaining a variety of colours.&quot;

==Early life==
Since 1989, many historians and scholars have paraphrased Gennadi Gerasimov, a spokesman for Mikhail Gorbachev, when asked the difference between what Gorbachev and Dubček had done. He said it was 19 years. Many have questioned this since that time, better seeing nuance and particularities beyond cold war narratives. In fact, despite both future leaders profoundly questioning Stalinism at the time of Nikita Khrushchev &#x27;secret speech&#x27; in 1956, Dubček had a family, upbringing, and early education very different from the conventional communist party training that many assume him to have, as well as fundamentally different education than both Gorbachev and Velvet Revolution leader Václav Havel. As Ivan Laluha points out, his thinking was shaped by his upbringing by unconventional parents, and personal experience of, and longtime associations with, utopian and international experiments and members that emphasized a consensus-style of leadership.

Alexander Dubček was born in Uhrovec, Slovakia (then part of Czechoslovakia), on 27 November 1921. When he was three years old, the family moved to the Soviet Union. He spent most of his childhood living on what some have called a commune in Kyrgyzstan. The settlement was in Pishpek (now Bishkek), in the Kirghiz SSR of the Soviet Union, now the independent state of Kyrgyzstan. It was a utopian Esperantist and Idist industrial cooperative, Interhelpo. Pavol Dubček, Alexander&#x27;s son, described what his grandfather&#x27;s family found as, &quot;there was nothing there but an old barracks&quot;, after the family had come promised job opportunities and a good life. He said many of the first generation of immigrant children suffered typhus. Despite this, Pavol said it was &quot;impossible&quot; to go back at that time. In 1933 the family moved to the Central Russian city of Gorky, now Nizhny Novgorod. Alexander was then 12.

In 1938, due to general orders by Stalin, they would have had to renounce their Czechoslovak citizenship in order to stay. With the same loyalty to their place of birth that Alexander would show for the rest of his life, the family returned to Czechoslovakia. At 17 years old, Alexander joined the then-illegal Communist Party of Slovakia (KSS), working to organize resistance at his workplace. It was here, as a factory worker in Dubnica nad Váhom, where he learned his first trade. He worked together with his brother, Július, and with his childhood friend, Anna Borsekova.

They fought against the wartime pro-German Slovak state headed by Jozef Tiso. In August 1944 Dubček and his brother were ordered to join the partisans. They were members of the Jan Žižka partisan brigade during the Slovak National Uprising. His brother died in the uprising. The second and last time Alexander was wounded, he was sent to the Peterov family in Velčice to recover with Anna&#x27;s help. Because of his participation in the uprising, this would be a bad mark against him during the Stalinist period, after authorities began amalgamating the activities of partisans in the uprisings with members of the wartime regime and other non-communist elements.

Dubček&#x27;s father, Štefan, had been a member of the party since 1921. Upon his return he became active in it once again. Štefan was responsible for printing the party papers, forged and official documents, as well as producing other left-wing publications. During this time, the activities of Alexander and his family relied more on working through personal networks rather than party cells. The entire family was involved, shifting from one place to the next, eventually moving to Velčice. After the arrest of much of the KSS leadership in 1942, Štefan and the Dubčeks worked with another former Interhelpo member, primarily organizing communist youth. Alexander was arrested himself in July, but not before having significant impact and authority. After Štefan was arrested, Štefan was sent to prison and eventually to Mauthausen concentration camp, which he survived in part because he was there a short time.

Dubček married childhood friend, Anna Dubčeková (née Borseková), in September, 1945. They started a home in Trenčín.

Dubček began his studies at Comenius University in Bratislava, but he would return to the Soviet Union in 1955 to attend the University of Politics in Moscow, where he graduated in 1958 before he returned home. While in Moscow, Dubček&#x27;s Russian friends learned of Khrushchev&#x27;s &#x27;secret speech&#x27; denouncing Stalin in 1956. It would be a couple of months before they would tell him about it. The speech had been an answer to stories circulating of those who had begun returning from false imprisonment in the gulag. As much as Dubček was disturbed by the news of what Stalin had done, he also admired Khrushchev for making the speech over the opposition of most of the leadership, who were themselves involved.

==Education and early political career==

In 1948, the party he had joined was reorganized as the Slovak branch of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia (KSČ). Though still outside of the higher circles, Dubček&#x27;s generation represented the young idealistic rank-and-file of the party that took power in 1948, not a break from it. It was Stalinism that represented the discontinuity. It was this pre-Stalinist generation that originally seized power, allied with the younger generation of party members, who began to question the path taken by their leadership elders as they began to rise in the ranks during the 1950s and early 1960s.

The Slovak branch of the party emerged from the war with a smaller membership base and less connection with Slovak institutions than the Czech branches had. To recruit a mass party base for electoral politics, the party&#x27;s leadership, which was over 60 years old on average, appealed to a broad segment of less ideologically motivated younger people, giving the party a more pragmatic and less orthodox culture. In contrast to the Czech branch of the party, family, regional identity, religious, professional, and inter-personal relationships formed the glue of the Slovak branch of the party. A socially idealistic Dubček, with no rigid ideological destination in mind, rose amid these ranks.

In 1948, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia took power. In June, 1949, still in Trenčín, Dubček was promoted from his minor party duties at his workplace to administrative secretary of the OV KSS. He rose through the party ranks as a party functionary, first in Trenčín, then being transferred to Bratislava, and then to Banská Bystrica, while he pursued further education and training. He left for the Soviet Union in 1955, but returned in 1958 after completing his university education there. Shortly after returning from Moscow, in September 1958 he was appointed head secretary of the West Slovak Regional Committee of the KSS, and then transferred to Prague in 1960. There, as Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Czech Republic for Industry, Dubček became intensely involved in the work of rehabilitation commissions (especially Drahomir Kolder&#x27;s and Barnabit&#x27;s, 1962–1963). Learning of the mechanisms of repression, Dubček would call this a watershed in his thinking that would dedicate him to reforms.

From 1960 to 1968, he also participated in the National Assembly.

In 1963, a power struggle in the leadership of the Slovak branch unseated Karol Bacílek and Pavol David, hard-line allies of Antonín Novotný, First Secretary of the KSČ and President of Czechoslovakia. Bacílek was removed in response to the findings of the rehabilitation commissions, due to his role in crimes as Interior Minister in the 1950s. In their place, a new generation of Slovak Communists took control of party and state organs in Slovakia, led by Dubček, who became First Secretary of the Slovak branch of the party. Along with that title, Dubček became a member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the KSČ.

Shortly after Dubček took his new position as head of the Slovak party in 1963, he personally oversaw complete rehabilitation of those earlier convicted of being Slovak &quot;bourgeois nationalists&quot;. He promoted the return of historic cultural personalities to popular awareness within Slovak society. This took the form of celebrations and commemorations, such as the 150th birthdays of 19th century leaders of the Slovak National Revival Ľudovít Štúr and Jozef Miloslav Hurban, the centenary of the Matica slovenská in 1963, and the twentieth anniversary of the Slovak National Uprising Dubček himself had taken part in. Even before this reformist take-over, the political and intellectual climate in Slovakia had been freer than that in the Czech lands.

Meanwhile, cultural weeklies such as &quot;Literarni Novinv&quot;, &quot;Kultúrny život,&quot;, and &quot;Kulturni Tvorba&quot; saw greatly expanded readership. Like many of the Slovak culture institutions, these publications were, however, engaged in a mostly indirect confrontation with the center, such as obvious ironic overstating of the party line. Political conflicts were commonly negotiated. This was complicated by exceptions, such as &quot;Kultúrny život,&quot; the weekly newspaper of the Union of Slovak Writers, which authorities considered politically unreliable. Such direct confrontations were spreading. In 1967, Vaclav Havel&#x27;s play &quot;The Memorandum&quot; and Milan Kundera&#x27;s novel &quot;The Joke&quot;, were seen by many writers as the beginnings of open rebellion.

==Prague Spring==


The Czechoslovak economy began to plateau in the early 1960s. The one-size-fits-all model of economic planning, better suited to the pre-industrialized Soviet Union of the 1930s, resulted in over-investment in heavy industry at the expense of light industry and consumer goods. Quantity was maximized regardless of costs, leading to poor quality and prices that were twice that of world prices. Along with other economists, Ota Šik condemned the existing system of management as one that made further development impossible. Though production continued to grow, albeit slowly, in 1964 income began to fall. This forced then-president Antonín Novotný to begin making limited concessions to liberalize the strictly planned economy. This included allowing greater freedom to companies in setting prices and wages. Though the source of the immediate crisis was the now-pressing economic effects, Dubček&#x27;s generation had spent the early 1960s engaged in travel, research, and study heavily supported by academia, the state, and the party. Their body of research and experience convinced the reformers that their self-isolated country had not simply reached a growth impasse but had fallen behind the rest of the world due to a generation of stagnation in all spheres of life.

Reforms only touched some sectors, and reforms were slow, which the regime tried to make up with increased imports. Liberalizing the centralized economy threatened those in the party bureaucracy who administered the old system, resulting in their sabotage and slowing of what reforms were voted. The cultural sphere liberalized the most completely and rapidly, but the economy and national autonomy remained heavily centralized. Cultural intellectuals were able to achieve more, and gain greater leverage among the reformists because of a combination of a greater ability to connect with the public and a peculiarity of the system. Writers and publishers benefited from the autonomous profitability of the sectors they controlled, giving them fundamentally different interests than those tied to heavy industry or other sectors, who lacked financial independence.

The technocratic economic reformers, such as Radoslav Selucký, who denounced the &quot;cult of the plan&quot;, were only slightly less ideologically threatening. In many ways they were just as dangerous to the interests of conservatives in the party, but they lacked the political leverage of the moral economists who bridged the gap with the writers and intellectuals. Ota Šik relied on an interdisciplinary approach and method. Writers and cultural intellectuals began to see themselves as holding the balance of power between the entrenched apparatus and reformers, which for many explains their enthusiasm for joining the party in disproportionate numbers, where their growing power could be expressed.

Regardless, the economic reforms touched on both the nationalities and the political question. Reforming how the economy operated was tied to how the party operated, and thinking evolved to recognize the need for a diversity of interests to be represented. Cultural reform touched on economic reform, as the educated groups saw one of the principle resources the economy neglected was talent. Technical advance required abilities that were neither promoted nor respected among the conservatives, such as Novotný, who were mostly poorly educated and often lacked fundamental competency at their jobs. They did not call, however, for capitalism and class difference but democratic compensation for additional time and expense necessary for their education.

In May 1967, speaking before the Plenum of the Communist Party of Slovakia, Dubček represented this rising conviction among his generation that rejected the dictatorship of a single class of workers or party officials. Instead, he appealed to a universal all-inclusive human principle that had as much in common with sociology as Marxist–Leninism, in origins, practice, and aims, while still embracing both.

In September, 1967, Novotný&#x27;s conservatives began to impose strict censorship on films and other culture products, institutions, and culture workers. This did not quiet opposition but only further provoked it. What followed was an unprecedented mobilization of solidarity among culture workers in both Czech and Slovak lands.

Following his presentation of grievances the month before, in October 1967 Dubček and Ota Šik challenged First Secretary Novotný&#x27;s leadership style at a Central Committee meeting. Dubček said he acted like a dictator. Faced with lack of support at the central and local level of the party and large public demonstrations the last day of October that were badly mishandled, provoking further opposition, Novotný secretly invited Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev to visit to Prague in December 1967. He had hoped to shore up his own position.

In Prague, Brezhnev was stunned to learn of the extent of the opposition to Novotný. He decided not to interfere. Brezhnev was generally supportive of Novotny, but said he was not there to solve their problems. He was there to help restore party unity, while the KSC Presidium was deadlocked 5-5. In January, 1968, the questions of leadership and reform were turned over to the Czechoslovak Party Central Committee. They voted no confidence in Novotný by splitting the functions of the president and party leader. He remained president but was replaced by Dubček as First Secretary. Novotný resisted, attempting to mobilize elements of the army to prevent his loss of power. Ironically, investigation into this led to Novotný being completely removed from office a few months later. Investigations by officials and a newly freed media of his chief accomplice, General Jan Šejna, exposed a corruption scandal involving his own and his sons&#x27; shady business dealings, which was known as the &#x27;Clover Seed Scandal&#x27;.

Dubček, with his background and training in Russia, was seen by the USSR as a safe pair of hands. &quot;Our Sasha&quot;, as Brezhnev called him. Aside from the immediate personal and professional animosity of Bulgarian leader, Todor Zhivkov, who refused to acknowledge him directly, other Warsaw Pact leaders sent customary congratulations. Zhivkov received a protest for his snub from Soviet diplomats. Zhivkov&#x27;s behavior was not motivated by opposition to Dubček&#x27;s program of reforms but his discomfort at the manner in which his predecessor had been removed. Making no secret where he was headed, in February, with Brezhnev present, Dubček pledged: &quot;We shall have to remove everything that strangles artistic and scientific creativeness.&quot;

The period following Novotný&#x27;s downfall became known as the Prague Spring. During this time, Dubček and other reformers sought to liberalize the Communist government—creating &quot;socialism with a human face&quot;. Dubček and his allies’ aim was not a return to capitalism, nor was it an end to the Communist Party&#x27;s rule or its leading role in society. It was socialism marked by, &quot;internal democracy, unlimited and unconditioned by the party, the strengthening of the faith of the people and the working class, and its transformation into a revolutionary force and the creative power of the party.&quot; To that end, the Prague Spring sought to liberalize the existing regime. It continued a series of reforms that granted greater freedom of expression to the press and public, rehabilitated victims of Stalinist purges by Klement Gottwald, advanced economic decentralization, and supported fundamental human rights reforms that included an independent judiciary.

During the Prague Spring, he and other reform-minded Communists enhanced popular support for the Communist government by eliminating its repressive features, allowing greater freedom of expression, and tolerating political and social organizations not under Communist control. &quot;Dubček! Svoboda!&quot; became the popular refrain of student demonstrations during this period, while a poll at home gave him 78-percent public support.

Dubček declared a 10-year program to implement reforms, but as reforms gained momentum he struggled to both maintain control and move with events. Dubček had been a compromise candidate between more radical reformers and hard-line conservatives. In power, Dubček was caught between a powerful hard-line minority in Czechoslovakia and their allies in other Warsaw Pact countries who pressured Dubček to rein in the Prague Spring, and on the other hand, more radical reformers who demanded more far-reaching and immediate reforms. While still stressing the leading role of the Party and the centrality of the Warsaw Pact, Dubček also was open to redefining the duty of party members from obedience to more creative expression. According to a CIA assessment at the time, Dubček was seen as an adept politician who might pull the balancing act off at home, which if true made Soviet military intervention all the more urgently needed by the anti-reform faction. The Soviet politburo may not have shared this view of Dubček, but they interpreted events as demonstrating dishonesty as much as lack of ability. In a phone conversation between Dubček and Brezhnev on 13 August, Dubček complained that he was on the verge of quitting in frustration, having difficulty meeting his promises because he was operating in such a fluid situation that planning was difficult and any new promises could just cause Brezhnev greater distrust when those promises couldn&#x27;t be fulfilled rapidly.

The Soviet leadership tried to rein in events in Czechoslovakia through a series of negotiations. The Soviet Union agreed to bilateral talks with Czechoslovakia in July at Čierna nad Tisou railway station, near the Slovak-Soviet border. At the meeting, Dubček defended the reform program but pledged his government&#x27;s continued commitment to the Warsaw Pact and Comecon. Dubček promised to curb the media and anti-socialist tendencies and prevent the reconstitution of the Social Democratic Party. In return, the Soviets promised to withdraw troops that had been stationed in the country since exercises that June, where the Czechs had played the NATO team.

Despite Dubček&#x27;s continuing efforts to stress these commitments afterward, Brezhnev and other Warsaw Pact leaders told Dubček they remained anxious. Because so many motives were hidden behind clandestine activities, personal motives, and organizational biases, where even pro-intervention hard-liners had to make appearances so as not to be charged with treason, there was and remains confusion as to Soviet motives for the invasion that ended the Prague Spring.

Some believed that the Soviets saw even a partly free press as threatening an end to one-party rule in Czechoslovakia, and (by extension) elsewhere in Eastern Europe. This is contradicted by many eyewitnesses, such as Ken Coates. According to Coates, the charge that the party was losing control or that counter-revolutionaries were misusing reforms, including press freedom, to undermine the party position was laughable, saying: &quot;Anyone who was in Prague and lived in Czechoslovakia at that time knew that the Party&#x27;s authority, the Party&#x27;s position in the eyes of the nation had improved for the first time.&quot; Instead, he said that &quot;The Party discredited itself.&quot;

However, the telephone conversation between Brezhnev and Dubček on 13 August suggests that media coverage was given high importance. Brezhnev had instructed Dubček to remove key people responsible for the media, specifically, &quot;Pelikán, Císař, Kriegel, and other scoundrels&quot;. Dubček&#x27;s unwillingness or inability to do so created distrust around certain statements circulated in the media, which may have made the issue more significant than it actually was in itself, as it gave credence to the coup plotters.

Press freedom began as an opening to reassessment of the Stalinist purges and the nation&#x27;s historic past, but it grew into an abstract ideal as conservative criticism generalized and mounted. The question had been one more of truth-telling than of press freedom. The issues were more broad. Confusion was common. At the time of the invasion, events caught much of the world by surprise, despite widespread evidence of troop buildups and continued seeming arbitrary maneuvers on the country&#x27;s borders. In an emergency meeting of the United States National Security Council called by President Lyndon B. Johnson on 20 August, Defense Secretary Clark Clifford, along with the cabinet and president could not explain Soviet actions. The invasion also erupted alongside so many destabilizing changes that some have pointed to &#x27;press freedom&#x27; serving as a short-cut explanation.

In a letter written in 1974 to the widow of Josef Smrkovský, a close political ally who died in official political disgrace that January, Dubček said he remained unable to explain why the Soviet leadership believed &quot;distorted reports&quot; about the nature and aims of his socialist reforms. He said that these urgent warnings to the Soviet leadership were the result of party leaders and other conservatives who, &quot;saw all that was happening solely from the angle of the loss of their leading role in the party.&quot;

Anti-reformist elements were a coalition of hard-liners in the Soviet Union, such as Yuri Andropov, whose false reports of events in Hungary had also helped overcome Khrushchev&#x27;s opposition to intervention, and Warsaw Pact leaders fearing for their own positions such as East German leader, Walter Ulbricht, and Polish leader, Władysław Gomułka. Perhaps most significantly, false high-level reports included letters secretly passed directly to the Soviet Politburo by those within the Czechoslovakian regime who promoted intervention.

One such message was sent to Brezhnev at the time of the Čierna nad Tisou meeting. These letters and reports were sent by a group of anti-reformist hard-liners in the Czechoslovak Communist Party (KSC), under the leadership of Slovak Communist Party chief, Vasiľ Biľak, working with allies in the StB and Czechoslovak Army. Bil’ak later wrote in his own memoirs that what he and his colleagues feared most, right up until mid-August, was that Dubček would reach an accommodation of compromise with Moscow that would forestall or prevent an invasion. Bil’ak himself feared his own imminent departure from office with good reason. His hard deadlines were 26 August, the date of the Slovak Party Congress, and 20 August, a gathering of the reformist leadership. Both had been moved up to allow reformers to secure better positions. The warnings of Bil’ak and his supporters stoked deliberately exaggerated fears of violent &quot;anti-socialist counter-revolution&quot; as an &quot;imminent threat&quot;. This was not only to prod the Soviets to quick action but to ensure that Dubček would be removed and not even a moderate reformist government would remain to frustrate their personal prerogatives. Press freedom was only one of many reforms where no compromise at all could be tolerated.

== &quot;Fraternal Intervention&quot; ==

On the night of 20–21 August 1968, military forces from several Warsaw Pact member states (Albania, Romania and East Germany did not participate) invaded Czechoslovakia. Soviet media cited a call for help from unnamed representatives as the cause of the &quot;fraternal intervention&quot;, publishing an unidentified appeal as proof on 22 August 1968; However, as it became clear from the first day that virtually the entire responsible leadership of the Czechoslovakian government and communist parties, including Dubček, were being blamed as causes of the invasion, and even the Soviet-supported leadership fell into accusations against each other, most allied communist parties around the world rejected the Soviet pretext as a thin disguise for gross violation of national party autonomy. Even President Ludvík Svoboda had publicly issued a statement calling on occupying forces to withdraw and for reforms to continue, while Czechoslovakia&#x27;s UN representatives were calling for international support against the invasion.

The Soviets were only partly responsible for their confusion. Closely following a long telephone conversation between Bil’ak and Brezhnev on 10 August, two of Bil’ak&#x27;s most important allies met with the Soviet ambassador to Czechoslovakia on 14–15 August: Alois Indra, who along with Drahomir Kolder had previously been in direct contact with the Soviet Politburo, was accompanied by another KSC hard-liner, Oldřich Pavlovský, in their meeting with ambassador Stepan Chervonenko. They assured him that as soon as Soviet &quot;troops move into action on the night of 20 August,&quot; the &quot;healthy forces&quot; in the KSC would carry out their &quot;plan of action&quot; to oust Dubček, setting up a &quot;provisional revolutionary government of workers and peasants.&quot; Indra said he could &quot;guarantee&quot; that a majority of the KSC Presidium, the KSC Central Committee, the National Assembly, and the Czechoslovak government would join with the &quot;healthy forces.&quot; He promised six of the eleven members of the KSC Presidium and 50 members of the KSC Central Committee as his supporters.

The Soviet Politburo received many such appeals for intervention, misleading them into confidence the viability of a hard-liner government in waiting. The KGB had also buried reports that the US and the Federal Republic of Germany were not behind the Prague Spring. KGB Station Chief in Washington DC, Oleg Kalugin, only discovered years later that the KGB leadership had ordered his reports destroyed and not shown to anyone after they received what Kalugin thought was a more balanced assessment. Meanwhile, KGB reports to the Soviet leadership went to lengths to support the official narrative and the claims of anti-reform hard-liners. They blamed everything negative that happened in Czechoslovakia on the Prague Spring, including in some cases traffic crashes, fires, and burglaries. The KGB even manufactured evidence, directing agents to plant caches of American-made weapons near the German border in order to be discovered. They instructed agents to hang posters calling for the overthrow of communism. This was to prove a western-sponsored network was active in Dubček&#x27;s reform movement as part of an imminent insurrection or coup. The KGB was only further enraged when the Czechoslovakian Interior Minister revealed it all to be a deliberate Soviet provocation.

The KGB had many reasons for their actions, but most important may have been its institutional bias. The Pillar Commission set up to investigate the show trials of the 1950s recommended the disbandment of the secret police, and Czechoslovakian security services had already ceased most cooperation with the KGB, having a major impact on the KGBs operational effectiveness and influence. The Czech security services had been vital to their effective operations. Some suggest further that they may have feared eventual reprisals against their most active and loyal agents within the StB and Interior Ministry. This motive is partly supported by the guarantees against reprisals against pro-Soviet Czechoslovakians in the Moscow Protocols. The KGB was also upset when Czechoslovak Interior Minister Josef Pavel revealed the existence of six KGB liaison agents within his office, implying that they would be removed. In an atmosphere of conformity cultivated by Brezhnev, only a few in the Kremlin voiced skepticism, such as Gennady Voronov, who asked, &quot;Whom was it really so necessary for us to defend, and from whom?&quot;

Bil’ak would join Indra in reassuring the Soviets, promising that Kolder would be ready to be voted the KSC First Secretary when Soviet troops arrived. When two of their promised allies on the Presidium, Jan Piller and František Barbírek, opposed the invasion and supported Dubček, Soviet plans had to be abandoned. This forced them to retain Dubček and his government until the following year, when Dubček&#x27;s government could no longer contain growing pressure to advance reforms once again, coming both from within and without the party.

The day of the invasion, occupying armies quickly seized control of Prague and the Central Committee&#x27;s building, taking Dubček and other reformers into Soviet custody. But, before they were arrested, Dubček urged the people not to resist militarily, on the grounds that &quot;presenting a military defense would have meant exposing the Czech and Slovak peoples to a senseless bloodbath&quot;. Already the previous month, when officers under General Václav Prchlík, head of the KSC&#x27;s military department, began preparing contingency plans for a Soviet/Warsaw Pact invasion, Dubček had immediately vetoed its implementation.

In the early hours of the attack, Czechoslovakian radio broadcast an appeal to citizens not to resist. The presidium of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia asked, &quot;all citizens of the Republic to keep the peace (and remain at their posts but) not resist the advancing armies, because the defense of our state borders is now impossible&quot;. By making this official declaration before Soviet troops could preempt functioning of the official government, the Czechoslovakian leadership ensured that both the invasion and Soviet invitation would be seen as illegitimate but also established the political and strategic framework for the resistance as symbolic and moral, where their opponent would have less control.

Controversy at that time and since has arisen as to whether Dubček knew of the invasion and hid the fact for his own reasons, perhaps explaining some of the world&#x27;s surprise. Some point to the telephone conversation between Brezhnev and Dubček on 13 August where Dubček is recorded to say, &quot;If you on the Soviet Politburo believe we&#x27;re deceiving you, you should take the measure you regard as appropriate.&quot; Brezhnev is recorded to respond, &quot;Such measures would be easier for us to adopt if you and your comrades would more openly say that these are the measures you&#x27;re expecting of us.&quot; Historians have never accepted Dubček&#x27;s foreknowledge, and Dubček has always denied it, but Czech resistance was somewhat unconventional and much is shrouded in ambiguity that created an open question for some.

The non-violent resistance of the Czech and Slovak population, which helped delay pacification by Warsaw Pact forces for over eight months (in contrast to the Soviet military&#x27;s estimate of four days), became an example of civilian-based defense. A latter-day &quot;The Good Soldier Švejk&quot; (referring to an early-20th-century Czech satirical novel) wrote of &quot;the comradely pranks of changing street names and road signs, of pretending not to understand Russian, and of putting out a great variety of humorous welcoming posters&quot;. Meanwhile, for a short time government radio stations called for the invaders to return home: &quot;Long live freedom, Svoboda, Dubček&quot;.

Dubček was arrested before dawn when 3 security officers, revolvers in hand and accompanied by several soldiers with machine guns bust into his office. One of them cut the telephone wires while another began to cuff him. When Dubček protested, he was beaten. His driver attempted to intervene and was immediately shot. Dubček was told, &quot;We will kill, if necessary, a million Czechs, threatened one of the officers, to put an end to your counter-revolution.&quot;

Later on the day of the invasion, Dubček, along with Premier Oldřich Černík, Jozef Smrkovsky and Frantisek Kriegel were taken to the Soviet Union. At first, Dubček was taken to a mountain cottage in Ukraine; However, upon encountering massive popular resistance to their planned coup, and President Svoboda and other Czech representatives who were still in Prague refusing to accept any agreement made without approval of the official representatives of the party, the Soviets changed tactics and sent him to Moscow for negotiations.

On 24 August, Soviet representatives presented the Moscow Protocol. Rejecting a counter-proposal offered by Dubček&#x27;s aides, they said it was non-negotiable. The only alternative was Soviet imposition of a military dictatorship now that their illusions of being welcomed as liberators proved false. Dubček and other detainees were repeatedly beaten during their detention, and Dubček reports he was drugged with sedatives to make him more compliant. Resisting nonetheless, Dubček&#x27;s team gained minor but significant concessions, including refusing to accept Soviet justifications for the invasion or the right of the Soviet Union or any other country to decide their country&#x27;s future, as well as not agreeing to the immediate reversal of all reforms. In the end, Dubček said they were forced to sign in order to avoid bloodshed in the room and back at home, with only František Kriegel refusing to sign. This ended the Prague Spring and set the stage for a Moscow-directed reversal of reforms that Dubček was compelled to sell and implement.

Dubček and most of the reformers were returned to Prague on 27 August. At the time, the Moscow Protocol was intended to be a secret document. It was revealed to party members the subsequent week and then leaked to the New York Times. Throughout the rest of the year, Dubček and other senior leaders were called back to Moscow repeatedly to receive new demands, which they returned home to deliver to their people. This led Dubček to consider quitting under extreme duress at times, but he always recovered. The Soviets made no attempt to hide their contempt. When Dubček protested that he had already met the terms of the Moscow Protocol, he is reported to have been told to &#x27;shut up&#x27; by Soviet President Nikolai Podgorny. The Czechoslovakian team were told that the Soviets would continue to turn the screws harder, undeterred by the protests of other communist parties; They dismissed them saying, &quot;For the next 30 or 40 years, socialism has no chance in the capitalist West.&quot; Gustav Husák reported they were treated as &quot;scoundrels&quot;

In January 1969, Dubček was hospitalized in Bratislava complaining of a cold and had to cancel a speech. Rumors sprang up that his illness was radiation sickness and that it was caused by radioactive strontium being placed in his soup during his stay in Moscow in an attempt to kill him. However, a U.S. intelligence report discounted this for lack of evidence. Also that month, following the self-immolation of Jan Palach, reformers renewed their offensive against conservative hardliners. Dubček pledged to hold the line against both reformers and neo-Stalinists, but opposition was moving outside the party for tactical reasons.

Dubček was forced to resign as First Secretary in April 1969, following the Czechoslovak Hockey Riots. The Soviets were not only alarmed by Dubček&#x27;s failure to contain growing pressure to resume reforms but at their own failures to consolidate a neo-Stalinist regime under Indra or their other allies. Dubček was replaced by former reformer Gustav Husák, beginning a process of &#x27;normalization&#x27; that would eventually purge two-thirds of the party and de-politicize the country. At the time, Leonid Brezhnev is supposed to have said: &#x27;If we cannot find the puppets, then we will tie the strings to the leaders.&#x27;

Though no longer party leader, Dubček had been re-elected to the Federal Assembly (as the federal parliament was renamed in 1969); Dubček became chairman on 28 April. Following the violent suppression of protests by new domestic Czech security forces, Dubček signed the &#x27;baton law&#x27; into effect in August. Husák had sent this to the Federal Assembly to expand legal powers of suppression of dissent. Dubček would later call this the gravest mistake of his life. The baton law was widely seen as the end of hope for successful resistance. Despite his continued cooperation, Dubček was removed from parliamentary office on 15 October under Prime Minister Cernik&#x27;s new government. Though Cernik tried to placate reformists, the new government&#x27;s extreme anti-reformist faction, led by Deputy Party Chief Lubomír Štrougal, wanted to put Dubček on trial. Husák, who styled himself as a post-ideological &#x27;realist&#x27;, as well as Moscow, wanted to avoid a destabilizing return to Stalinism.

Instead, Dubček was sent into diplomatic exile to Turkey. From head of a nation of millions and leader of 1.6 million party members, he went to heading a 7-person staff; This left him conveniently out of the country while more aggressive purges began in earnest. Some suggested at the time it would be too dangerous to post him anywhere within the Soviet bloc, where he was widely regarded as a hero. Husák was also said to have feared that direct persecution of Dubček might stir more instability than it would promote. Some thought that Husák&#x27;s reluctance to trials and executions was because of his own experiences as a prisoner, though he thought his own imprisonment was wrong, he had no problem with imprisoning state enemies on general principle or personal feeling. Others suggest that it was the hard-liners themselves who wanted Dubček out of the country to isolate him from the public and to prevent him becoming a martyr, as trials had never helped the communist regime either within the country or internationally. Alan Levy, a journalist who witnessed the Prague Spring, explained Husák&#x27;s reluctance with a comparison. Hungary was able to relax its repressive grip within less than 5 years after the Soviet invasion, but Czechoslovakia and its former leaders remained in a state of limbo rather than hell that would eventually last for decades. This he explained as because unlike Hungary, Czechoslovakia had no real revolt to liquidate. Instead, he and the Soviets had to invent a counter-revolution, not prosecute it.

However, in June of that same year, Dubček was dismissed from his ambassadorial post and recalled from Turkey after being suspended from the party pending an investigation by hard-liners. This was read as a signal that Husák had lost a behind-the-scenes power struggle against the hard-line faction led by Štrougal, Indra, and Balik. They had taken control of the Presidium by a margin of 7 to 4, voting to prepare a series of trials against reformers on charges of espionage, sedition, and slander of the republic. At the time, some suggested that Dubček&#x27;s and his reformer allies&#x27; fates may have been spared by the chance drunk-driving crash that saved Husák from removal himself. The resulting investigation uncovered a conspiracy by ultra-conservatives to remove Husák who were themselves removed. Others said that this threat was part of an attempt to force Dubček to defect to the west, using his wife and children as hostages in Ankara. The only debate within ruling circles was how best to isolate Dubček from the public by some form of character assassination. They wanted him reassigned to a position as a senior officer in the Pension Insurance Research Institute to entrap him in a scandal after having failed to pressure Dubček to leave under a cloud as a defector, which would discredit him as a loyal party member.

Dubček found himself a permanent free-range prisoner, along with many others purged from the party and blacklisted from work. The purge of the party resulted in a general decline in membership from 1.6 million at the time that Dubček rose to power to 880,000 by the end of 1970. More purges would follow as loyalists replaced the able careerists. Those who otherwise cooperated to advance their careers. Even among those who remained members by the end of 1970, many either refused their cards or had not paid their dues. The reduction in numbers was accompanied by a qualitative change in the party, where the party that Dubček headed as leader of the post-Stalinist generation of idealists was gone. The majority of members were over 60 years old, and ideology had virtually disappeared, even among conservatives. Dubček and his communist reformers had proven so popular that the only way to root them out of the political fabric of the nation was to eradicate communist ideology. To do so required to virtually remove an entire generation from the party. Even Czechoslovakian universities ceased to teach Marxism for lack of &#x27;reliable&#x27; instructors. Any kind of political belief, in rapid succession, would be grounds for suspicion, leaving a disaffected population.

For Dubček and many others, this did not mean a return to private life but a different kind of political life, where in Dubček&#x27;s case, his career in high politics would be deferred at home while he served as an inspirational symbol of Eurocommunist ideals abroad. Meanwhile, he struggled to personally survive repressions at home. Outwardly, he shifted to menial work that many educated reformers were forced to take. Turning down a post at a Slovak social security agency that could be used to implicate him in the misappropriation of funds, he instead requested to work as a forester. This was refused, but he was eventually given a clerical job with the state forestry agency in Bratislava. He was still investigated at work, but wrong-doing could never be found.

== Exile in Bratislava ==

After his expulsion from the party, Dubček became a &quot;nonperson&quot; whose very mention was banned. In 1988 he told Voice of America that, &quot;what he had been through could not be described as &#x27;life&#x27; in the normal sense of the word, but rather a matter of survival.&quot;

While the first news reports during the normalization period, 1970–74, show a man who actively avoided attention and was shifting uncertainly between insecure employment, telling a West German photographer: &quot;Please, sir. Please, sir, if you like to help me come not to me.&quot; School girls giggled, saying all they were told at school was that he had done something bad. Other reports saw him as a man living securely but anonymously with his wife and children in a comfortable villa in a nice neighborhood in Bratislava. This seems to have been the official fable, as no evidence suggests this being a wholly accurate picture. When in 1975, authorities turned to prosecute his wife, Anna, she presented evidence of the insecure position of the entire family and personal friends denied proper medical care, her sons denied apartments, the armed guards posted at their home that made them fear its seizure, and her own nervous condition and health problems from constant surveillance and persecution. An entire politics arose around the false portrayal of the stability, security, and privilege of the Dubčeks&#x27; &quot;private&quot; life, in part to make plausible that Dubček was at liberty to be heavily involved in counter-revolutionary activities. Dubček was described as variously a spy-master, or when proven not to be or when misrepresented by either the regime or others, as a self-absorbed and simple-minded marionette of powerful external forces living a self-indulgent private life insulated from political participation and understanding. Complaints, such as that Dubček&#x27;s sons were given high marks and admitted to university were described by one writer as, &quot;self-righteous vengefulness of the Soviet sycophants&quot; within the regime.

Dubček would say he first broke his silence by publishing letters he smuggled out of the country after he was denied the right to bury his mother in daylight in 1974, for fear it would provoke an anti-government demonstration. Dubček&#x27;s public letters to other parties and to the National Assembly were part of a larger international &#x27;campaign&#x27; by purged members gradually being joined by many high-profile figures outside Czechoslovakia and other domestic activists. This campaign was spurred by international publication of the &quot;memoirs&quot; of Josef Smrkovský, as well as the sometimes described &#x27;hysterical&#x27; reaction of Husak to Dubček&#x27;s both real and invented transgressions and writings. This ultimately gave Dubček a greater voice through anti-regime allies and provoked Dubček further in self-preservation. When in September 1975, as Husak intensified repressions following his consolidation of leadership positions, Dubček reacted to interrogation by refusing to deny the information being leaked or protesting the false use of his name, counter-threatening to act &quot;decisively&quot; if &quot;repressive measures&quot; were taken against him.

The former leader of the Prague Spring in fact had much in common with Eurocommunist tendencies. There were common challenges in the countries of the east and west caught between the superpowers, but seeking to both heal the division of Europe and gain autonomy from the influence of great power politics. Eurocommunism sought to unify the European labor movement and participate fully in parliamentary and internal democracy, decentralize, and steer an independent course. Not only did this bring them into direct conflict with the Soviet Union during the crackdown against the Solidarity trade union, but they had been in open disagreement with Moscow over the invasion of Czechoslovakia. In 1968, the clash was less public but just as clear. In a restricted meeting of the Italian Communist Party, Enrico Berlinguer told members to prepare their base for a clash with the Soviet leadership over the invasion.

Dubček had a long history of contact with not only the Italian Communist Party but with its newspaper &quot;l&#x27;Unita&quot; and its journalists. A highly favorable article about him in &quot;L&#x27;Unità&quot;, on 29 June 1970, reporting his expulsion from the party, portrayed him as a social democratic communist seeking to change the ruling style of the party. He struck a chord with Italian audiences and remained a popular symbol of shared ideals. Under constant surveillance and separated from his domestic contacts, it was in many ways easier for him to make contact with western communist media and parties than with his own party and people. He saw this use of intermediaries as the natural course of action, stating in a letter to the Italian Communist Party:

&quot;Since the matter of the political path in the Communist Party has become international, it cannot remain internal at this time. After the expulsion of almost 600,000 communists from the party and their civil and social disenfranchisement to our laws and the Constitution of Czechoslovakia, the crisis in the party deepened even more. A gradual starting point can only come with the help of other communist parties of socialist countries and other communist parties, especially European ones...Helping other communist parties cannot be understood as interfering in the internal affairs of another communist party, because it has long since become an international matter.&quot;

Dubček&#x27;s relationship with Italian communists would lead to his first direct public interview, which prodded the University of Bologna into offering him an honorary doctorate as a man who could bridge the differences between the east and west. His trip to Italy in 1988, and the public recognition he gained from both the timing and prestige of an award he shared with Nelson Mandela, marked his return to high politics. This was at a time when perestroika was finally breaking through to the Soviet bloc nations outside the Soviet Union. This led directly to his partial rehabilitation as well as a return to public life. Immediately after receiving the award, Dubček was congratulated by Rudolf Slansky Jr., son of Rudolf Slánský, who pointed to his importance as, &quot;not only a symbol of the Prague Spring, but also a symbol of inevitable changes in Czechoslovakia and a real political alternative.&quot;

In 1989, he was awarded the annual Sakharov Prize in its second year of existence.

==Velvet Revolution==
In 1989, before the anniversary of the Warsaw Pact invasion, the Slovak members of the Movement for Civil Freedoms (HOS) decided to commemorate the event by laying flowers as the locations of those in Slovakia who had been killed. Five of the organizers signed the letter announcing it. They were promptly arrested and came to be known as the &#x27;Bratislava Five&#x27;.

On 14 November 1989, the final day of the trial of the &#x27;Bratislava Five&#x27;, a crowd gathered in front of the Bratislava Justice Palace. As Miroslav Kusý recollects, 

On 17 November, Dubček attended the students&#x27; march at Albertov, in the Prague 2 municipal district. Fearing he would give a speech, the StB arrested Dubček, releasing him the next morning. This was said to mark the last arrest of an opposition leader. Martin Bútora, one of the founders of Public Against Violence (VPN) recounted Dubček&#x27;s appearance at Slovak National Uprising Square on 23 November as, 

On 19 November, the Civic Forum, headed by Charter 77 member Václav Havel, was established to oppose the communist government. Several hundred thousand individuals demonstrated against the communist government in Prague on 20–28 November 1989.

The night after his appearance at Slovak National Uprising Square, on 24 November, Dubček appeared with Havel on a balcony overlooking Wenceslas Square, where he was greeted with tremendous applause from the throngs of protesters below and embraced as a symbol of democratic freedom. Several onlookers even chanted, &quot;Dubček na hrad!&quot; (&quot;Dubček to the Castle&quot;—i.e., Dubček for President). The crowd was divided by his calling this new revolution a chance to continue the work he had started 20 years earlier and prune out what was wrong with communism. By this time, most of the protesters wanted nothing to do with communism of any sort. Later that night, Dubček was on stage with Havel at the Laterna Magika theatre, the headquarters of Civic Forum, when the entire leadership of the Communist Party resigned. This resignation in effect ended communist rule in Czechoslovakia.

While the show of a united front was necessary for the revolution of 1989, it would later prove a political embarrassment for some who vied for power against later regime opponents. They dismissed Dubček as a symbol of the past rather than the future. This reflected a division between the youth movements (sometimes called the Jacobins) that wanted nothing to do with the past and the older generation that was seen by them as too lenient and accommodating. Many of these arguments are obscured by politics.

The political rivalry between Husák and Dubček, which also was said to have features of personal animosity stemming from Husák&#x27;s conviction that Dubček was personally to blame for the Warsaw Pact invasion, continued to have repercussions even after the fall of the regime in November 1989. By appointing the Slovak Marián Čalfa as prime minister of the federal government the day before his abdication from the office of president of the republic, which took place on 10 December 1989, some charge that Husák deliberately pre-empted Dubček by indirectly enabling the election of Václav Havel for the office of Czechoslovak president. Dubček&#x27;s popularity throughout Czechoslovakia was high, giving him a very good chance of winning direct election for president. However, he lacked support from the prominent figures in the November revolution. They supported Charter 77 member Havel and a new generation of leaders.

When Dubček himself was asked to explain this division, he said that the younger generation were unable to distinguish between his generation of reformist communists and the generation of communists who came before. He saw the consequence of this, post-Velvet Revolution, as creating a weakened democratic front against the narrow-minded and dogmatic. Dubček said this was not the first nor the last time in history when, &quot;any revolution reaches a certain stage, it starts devouring its own children.&quot; According to a member of Charter 77, Petruška Šustrová, the younger generation had not forgotten that it was Dubček who signed the &#x27;baton law&#x27; and his fellow reformers who assisted in pacification of the country. She explains that a culture of trust had been lost. It was, &quot;politically and economically impossible to continue where we had left off in 1968; the times had changed, and so had the people&quot;.
While Havel became president, on 28 December 1989, Dubček was elected chairman of the Federal Assembly, holding this position until the parliamentary elections in June 1992. True to his past dedication to Eurocommunism, prior to this on 16 December, he welcomed the delegation of the Italian Socialist Party headed by its chairman Bettino Craxi in Prague. He also met Luciano Antonetti, as a journalist and an old friend. Antonetti interviewed Dubček for the newspaper l&#x27;Unita on the eve of the presidential election. In the interview Dubček said, &quot;This time with the European left, I am thinking of the next spring.&quot; But he emphasized that &quot;I will remain outside the Communist Party, even if it is renewed&quot;. Throughout 1990–92, Dubček continued &quot;intensive contacts&quot; with Italian communists and socialists, including visits to Italy where he was awarded honorary citizenship in many Italian cities.

In 1990, Dubček gave the commencement address to the College of Arts and Sciences at the American University School of International Service in the United States. He called Czechoslovakia&#x27;s fight against the Soviet invasion a &quot;moral victory&quot;. Gorbachev would have agreed, when he said, &quot;We thought that we had strangled the Prague Spring while in reality we had strangled ourselves.&quot;

In 1992, after long serving as an independent, he became leader of the Social Democratic Party of Slovakia and represented that party in the Federal Assembly. At that time, Dubček ambiguously supported the federal union between Czechs and Slovaks against the ultimately successful push towards an independent Slovak state. However, once it was clear that an independent Slovak Republic had become inevitable, at the same time historically as the breakup of Yugoslavia and other events, many assumed Dubček would become its first president.

Its work completed, the Charter 77 Movement disbanded on 3 November 1992, four days before Dubček died of injuries from a car crash. The Federal Assembly voted for the dissolution of Czechoslovakia on 25 November 1992. Czechoslovakia was formally dissolved on 31 December 1992; With that, Slovakia became an independent republic.

==Death==
Dubček died on 7 November 1992, as a result of injuries sustained in a car crash that took place on 1 September on the Czech D1 highway, near Humpolec, 20 days short of his 71st birthday. He was buried in Slávičie údolie cemetery in Bratislava, Slovakia. His death remained an open question to some, with allegations of involvement by either then–Prime Minister of Slovakia Vladimír Mečiar or the KGB. An investigation was reopened when some members of his Social Democratic Party demanded it. A second investigation ruled that the death was due to aquaplaning at excessive speed in rainy weather. The driver was reportedly given a 12-month sentence for speeding. However, his son, Pavol Dubček, said afterward he remained skeptical, saying there were still many &quot;unclear things&quot; about his father&#x27;s death that he does not understand. In an interview, he said he still remained skeptical in 2019, as he would remain for the rest of his life.

Alexander Dubček&#x27;s wife, Anna, died in 1990. They were survived by three sons: Pavol, who became a surgeon and traumatologist; Peter, who became an economist; and Milan. Alexander and Anna&#x27;s first son was still-born.

==Legacy and cultural representations==

Without Dubček, Czechoslovakian reforms may have taken a more technocratic form that didn&#x27;t include revival of Slovak culture and the opening of arts to more fluid and interdisciplinary forms that were exported by joint ventures and the diaspora of artists after the Soviet crackdown. Politically, the Prague Spring may have been more contained to Czechoslovakia. Many Soviet reformers, such as Sakharov, would have lacked the concrete inspiration that came from the reforms Dubček guided, particularly the revolt against stagnation. &quot;The invasion of Prague started the true dissident movement in Russia. An abyss opened up between them and the system, which was a catastrophic harbinger of change. Without Prague, there would have been no perestroika.&quot;

Dubček&#x27;s style of leadership, and the ultimate frustration of his program by Soviet intervention, also had a deep impact on the development and orientation of communist and socialist parties and thinkers in the west.

Dubček also left a legacy of might-have-beens and what-ifs. Historians and the public will continue to speculate what may have happened had he not died from a car crash or had his time in leadership of the Prague Spring not been interrupted by Soviet intervention. One obituary speculates that had he become the Slovak president, his influence over the new country would have charted a more immediately inclusive course toward Europe.

Dubček himself has been remembered in artistic representations in many cultures and times.

In 1984, French singer and songwriter Alice Dona had released a song named &quot;Le Jardinier de Bratislava&quot; with the lyrics written by Claude Lemesle, as an apolitical song about love and longing for freedom. The song was inspired by a trip of a French television crew to visit Dubček in his villa near Slavín, Bratislava. They were denied the access by the ŠtB secret police. The sole footage collected of Dubček was of him attending to his garden.

In 1990, the film &quot;Invasion&quot;, a dramatization of the Soviet invasion, was edited by producers to include translated commentary by Alexander Dubček responding to their interview about the events it portrays.

The movie &quot;Dubček&quot;, released in 2018, is the first film based on the life of Alexander Dubček. It is a Slovak historical movie whose main plot revolves around events related to the Warsaw Pact invasion.

<text>Anthrax is an infection caused by the bacterium &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; or &quot;Bacillus cereus&quot; biovar &quot;anthracis&quot;. Infection typically occurs by contact with the skin, inhalation, or intestinal absorption. Symptom onset occurs between one day and more than two months after the infection is contracted. The skin form presents with a small blister with surrounding swelling that often turns into a painless ulcer with a black center. The inhalation form presents with fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath. The intestinal form presents with diarrhea (which may contain blood), abdominal pains, nausea, and vomiting.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the first clinical descriptions of cutaneous anthrax were given by Maret in 1752 and Fournier in 1769. Before that, anthrax had been described only in historical accounts. The German scientist Robert Koch was the first to identify &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; as the bacterium that causes anthrax.

Anthrax is spread by contact with the bacterium&#x27;s spores, which often appear in infectious animal products. Contact is by breathing or eating or through an area of broken skin. It does not typically spread directly between people. Risk factors include people who work with animals or animal products, and military personnel. Diagnosis can be confirmed by finding antibodies or the toxin in the blood or by culture of a sample from the infected site.

Anthrax vaccination is recommended for people at high risk of infection. Immunizing animals against anthrax is recommended in areas where previous infections have occurred. A two-month course of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and doxycycline after exposure can also prevent infection. If infection occurs, treatment is with antibiotics and possibly antitoxin. The type and number of antibiotics used depend on the type of infection. Antitoxin is recommended for those with widespread infection.

A rare disease, human anthrax is most common in Africa and central and southern Asia. It also occurs more regularly in Southern Europe than elsewhere on the continent and is uncommon in Northern Europe and North America. Globally, at least 2,000 cases occur a year, with about two cases a year in the United States. Skin infections represent more than 95% of cases. Without treatment the risk of death from skin anthrax is 23.7%. For intestinal infection the risk of death is 25 to 75%, while respiratory anthrax has a mortality of 50 to 80%, even with treatment. Until the 20th century anthrax infections killed hundreds of thousands of people and animals each year. In herbivorous animals infection occurs when they eat or breathe in the spores while grazing. Animals may become infected by killing and/or eating infected animals.

Several countries have developed anthrax as a weapon. It has been used in biowarfare and bioterrorism since 1914. In 1975, the Biological Weapons Convention prohibited the &quot;development, production and stockpiling&quot; of biological weapons. It has since been used in bioterrorism. Likely delivery methods of weaponized anthrax include aerial dispersal or dispersal through livestock; notable bioterrorism uses include the 2001 anthrax attacks and an incident in 1993 by the Aum Shinrikyo group.

== Etymology ==
The English name comes from &quot;anthrax&quot; (), the Greek word for coal, possibly having Egyptian etymology, because of the characteristic black skin lesions people with a cutaneous anthrax infection develop. The central black eschar surrounded by vivid red skin has long been recognised as typical of the disease. The first recorded use of the word &quot;anthrax&quot; in English is in a 1398 translation of Bartholomaeus Anglicus&#x27;s work &quot;&quot; (&quot;On the Properties of Things&quot;, 1240).

Anthrax was historically known by a wide variety of names, indicating its symptoms, location, and groups considered most vulnerable to infection. They include Siberian plague, Cumberland disease, charbon, splenic fever, malignant edema, woolsorter&#x27;s disease and &quot;&quot;.

== Signs and symptoms ==
=== Skin ===

Cutaneous anthrax, also known as hide-porter&#x27;s disease, is when anthrax occurs on the skin. It is the most common (&gt;90% of cases) and least dangerous form (low mortality with treatment, 23.7% mortality without). Cutaneous anthrax presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center (eschar). The black eschar often shows up as a large, painless, necrotic ulcer (beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot, somewhat resembling bread mold) at the site of infection. In general, cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration two to five days after exposure. Unlike bruises or most other lesions, cutaneous anthrax infections normally do not cause pain. Nearby lymph nodes may become infected, reddened, swollen, and painful. A scab forms over the lesion soon, and falls off in a few weeks. Complete recovery may take longer. Cutaneous anthrax is typically caused when &quot;B. anthracis&quot; spores enter through cuts on the skin. This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products.

=== Injection ===
In December 2009, an outbreak of anthrax occurred among injecting heroin users in the Glasgow and Stirling areas of Scotland, resulting in 14 deaths. It was the first documented non-occupational human anthrax outbreak in the UK since 1960. The source of the anthrax is believed to have been dilution of the heroin with bone meal in Afghanistan. Injected anthrax may have symptoms similar to cutaneous anthrax, with the exception of black areas, and may also cause infection deep into the muscle and spread faster. This can make it harder to recognise and treat.

=== Lungs ===
Inhalation anthrax usually develops within a week after exposure, but may take up to 2 months. During the first few days of illness, most people have fever, chills, and fatigue. These symptoms may be accompanied by cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, and nausea or vomiting, making inhalation anthrax difficult to distinguish from influenza and community-acquired pneumonia. This is often described as the prodromal period.

Over the next day or so, shortness of breath, cough, and chest pain become more common, and complaints not involving the chest such as nausea, vomiting, altered mental status, sweats, and headache develop in one-third or more of people. Upper respiratory tract symptoms occur in only a quarter of people, and muscle pains are rare. Altered mental status or shortness of breath generally brings people to healthcare and marks the fulminant phase of illness.

It infects the lymph nodes in the chest first, rather than the lungs themselves, a condition called hemorrhagic mediastinitis, causing bloody fluid to accumulate in the chest cavity, thereby causing shortness of breath. The second (pneumonia) stage occurs when the infection spreads from the lymph nodes to the lungs. Symptoms of the second stage develop suddenly within hours or days after the first stage. Symptoms include high fever, extreme shortness of breath, shock, and rapid death within 48 hours in fatal cases.

=== Gastrointestinal ===
Gastrointestinal (GI) infection is most often caused by consuming anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by diarrhea, potentially with blood, abdominal pains, acute inflammation of the intestinal tract, and loss of appetite. Occasional vomiting of blood can occur. Lesions have been found in the intestines and in the mouth and throat. After the bacterium invades the gastrointestinal system, it spreads to the bloodstream and throughout the body, while continuing to make toxins.

== Cause ==
=== Bacteria ===
&quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; is a rod-shaped, Gram-positive, facultative anaerobe bacterium about 1 by 9 μm in size. It was shown to cause disease by Robert Koch in 1876 when he took a blood sample from an infected cow, isolated the bacteria, and put them into a mouse. The bacterium normally rests in spore form in the soil, and can survive for decades in this state. Herbivores are often infected while grazing, especially when eating rough, irritant, or spiky vegetation; the vegetation has been hypothesized to cause wounds within the gastrointestinal tract, permitting entry of the bacterial spores into the tissues. Once ingested or placed in an open wound, the bacteria begin multiplying inside the animal or human and typically kill the host within a few days or weeks. The spores germinate at the site of entry into the tissues and then spread by the circulation to the lymphatics, where the bacteria multiply.

The production of two powerful exotoxins and lethal toxin by the bacteria causes death. Veterinarians can often tell a possible anthrax-induced death by its sudden occurrence and the dark, nonclotting blood that oozes from the body orifices. Most anthrax bacteria inside the body after death are outcompeted and destroyed by anaerobic bacteria within minutes to hours &quot;post mortem&quot;, but anthrax vegetative bacteria that escape the body via oozing blood or opening the carcass may form hardy spores. These vegetative bacteria are not contagious. One spore forms per vegetative bacterium. The triggers for spore formation are not known, but oxygen tension and lack of nutrients may play roles. Once formed, these spores are very hard to eradicate.

The infection of herbivores (and occasionally humans) by inhalation normally begins with inhaled spores being transported through the air passages into the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. The spores are then picked up by scavenger cells (macrophages) in the lungs and transported through small vessels (lymphatics) to the lymph nodes in the central chest cavity (mediastinum). Damage caused by the anthrax spores and bacilli to the central chest cavity can cause chest pain and difficulty breathing. Once in the lymph nodes, the spores germinate into active bacilli that multiply and eventually burst the macrophages, releasing many more bacilli into the bloodstream to be transferred to the entire body. Once in the bloodstream, these bacilli release three proteins: lethal factor, edema factor, and protective antigen. The three are not toxic by themselves, but their combination is incredibly lethal to humans. Protective antigen combines with these other two factors to form lethal toxin and edema toxin, respectively. These toxins are the primary agents of tissue destruction, bleeding, and death of the host. If antibiotics are administered too late, even if the antibiotics eradicate the bacteria, some hosts still die of toxemia because the toxins produced by the bacilli remain in their systems at lethal dose levels.

=== Exposure and transmission ===
Anthrax can enter the human body through the intestines (gastrointestinal), lungs (pulmonary), or skin (cutaneous), and causes distinct clinical symptoms based on its site of entry. Anthrax does not usually spread from an infected human to an uninfected human. If the disease is fatal to the person&#x27;s body, its mass of anthrax bacilli becomes a potential source of infection to others and special precautions should be used to prevent further contamination. Pulmonary anthrax, if left untreated, is almost always fatal. Historically, pulmonary anthrax was called woolsorters&#x27; disease because it was an occupational hazard for people who sorted wool. Today, this form of infection is extremely rare in industrialized nations. Cutaneous anthrax is the most common form of transmission but also the least dangerous of the three transmissions. Gastrointestinal anthrax is likely fatal if left untreated, but very rare.The spores of anthrax are able to survive in harsh conditions for decades or even centuries. Such spores can be found on all continents, including Antarctica. Disturbed grave sites of infected animals have been known to cause infection after 70 years. In one such event, a young boy died from gastrointestinal anthrax due to the thawing of reindeer corpses from 75 years before contact. Anthrax spores traveled though groundwater used for drinking and caused tens of people to be hospitalized, largely children. Occupational exposure to infected animals or their products (such as skin, wool, and meat) is the usual pathway of exposure for humans. Workers exposed to dead animals and animal products are at the highest risk, especially in countries where anthrax is more common. Anthrax in livestock grazing on open range where they mix with wild animals still occasionally occurs in the U.S. and elsewhere.

Many workers who deal with wool and animal hides are routinely exposed to low levels of anthrax spores, but most exposure levels are not sufficient to produce infection. A lethal infection is reported to result from inhalation of about 10,000–20,000 spores, though this dose varies among host species.

== Mechanism ==
The lethality of the anthrax disease is due to the bacterium&#x27;s two principal virulence factors: the poly-D-glutamic acid capsule, which protects the bacterium from phagocytosis by host neutrophils; and the tripartite protein toxin, called anthrax toxin, consisting of protective antigen (PA), edema factor (EF), and lethal factor (LF). PA plus LF produces lethal toxin, and PA plus EF produces edema toxin. These toxins cause death and tissue swelling (edema), respectively.
To enter the cells, the edema and lethal factors use another protein produced by &quot;B. anthracis&quot; called protective antigen, which binds to two surface receptors on the host cell. A cell protease then cleaves PA into two fragments: PA20 and PA63. PA20 dissociates into the extracellular medium, playing no further role in the toxic cycle. PA63 then oligomerizes with six other PA63 fragments forming a heptameric ring-shaped structure named a prepore. Once in this shape, the complex can competitively bind up to three EFs or LFs, forming a resistant complex. Receptor-mediated endocytosis occurs next, providing the newly formed toxic complex access to the interior of the host cell. The acidified environment within the endosome triggers the heptamer to release the LF and/or EF into the cytosol. It is unknown how exactly the complex results in the death of the cell.

Edema factor is a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase. Adenylate cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP into cyclic AMP (cAMP) and pyrophosphate. The complexation of adenylate cyclase with calmodulin removes calmodulin from stimulating calcium-triggered signaling, thus inhibiting the immune response. To be specific, LF inactivates neutrophils (a type of phagocytic cell) by the process just described so they cannot phagocytose bacteria. Throughout history, lethal factor was presumed to cause macrophages to make TNF-alpha and interleukin 1 beta (IL1B). TNF-alpha is a cytokine whose primary role is to regulate immune cells, as well as to induce inflammation and apoptosis or programmed cell death. Interleukin 1 beta is another cytokine that also regulates inflammation and apoptosis. The overproduction of TNF-alpha and IL1B ultimately leads to septic shock and death. However, recent evidence indicates anthrax also targets endothelial cells that line serious cavities such as the pericardial cavity, pleural cavity, and peritoneal cavity, lymph vessels, and blood vessels, causing vascular leakage of fluid and cells, and ultimately hypovolemic shock and septic shock.

== Diagnosis ==

Various techniques may be used for the direct identification of &quot;B. anthracis&quot; in clinical material. Firstly, specimens may be Gram stained. &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp. are quite large in size (3 to 4 μm long), they may grow in long chains, and they stain Gram-positive. To confirm the organism is &quot;B. anthracis&quot;, rapid diagnostic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction-based assays and immunofluorescence microscopy may be used.

All &quot;Bacillus&quot; species grow well on 5% sheep blood agar and other routine culture media. Polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate can be used to isolate &quot;B. anthracis&quot; from contaminated specimens, and bicarbonate agar is used as an identification method to induce capsule formation. &quot;Bacillus&quot; spp. usually grow within 24 hours of incubation at 35 °C, in ambient air (room temperature) or in 5% CO2. If bicarbonate agar is used for identification, then the medium must be incubated in 5% CO2. &quot;B. anthracis&quot; colonies are medium-large, gray, flat, and irregular with swirling projections, often referred to as having a &quot;medusa head&quot; appearance, and are not hemolytic on 5% sheep blood agar. The bacteria are not motile, susceptible to penicillin, and produce a wide zone of lecithinase on egg yolk agar. Confirmatory testing to identify &quot;B. anthracis&quot; includes gamma bacteriophage testing, indirect hemagglutination, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect antibodies. The best confirmatory precipitation test for anthrax is the Ascoli test.

== Prevention ==
Precautions are taken to avoid contact with the skin and any fluids exuded through natural body openings of a deceased body that is suspected of harboring anthrax. The body should be put in strict quarantine. A blood sample is collected and sealed in a container and analyzed in an approved laboratory to ascertain if anthrax is the cause of death. The body should be sealed in an airtight body bag and incinerated to prevent the transmission of anthrax spores. Microscopic visualization of the encapsulated bacilli, usually in very large numbers, in a blood smear stained with polychrome methylene blue (McFadyean stain) is fully diagnostic, though the culture of the organism is still the gold standard for diagnosis. Full isolation of the body is important to prevent possible contamination of others.

Protective, impermeable clothing and equipment such as rubber gloves, rubber apron, and rubber boots with no perforations are used when handling the body. No skin, especially if it has any wounds or scratches, should be exposed. Disposable personal protective equipment is preferable, but if not available, decontamination can be achieved by autoclaving. Used disposable equipment is burned and/or buried after use. All contaminated bedding or clothing is isolated in double plastic bags and treated as biohazard waste. Respiratory equipment capable of filtering small particles, such the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health- and Mine Safety and Health Administration-approved high-efficiency respirator, is worn. By addressing Anthrax from a One Health perspective, we can reduce the risks of transmission and better protect both human and animal populations.

The prevention of anthrax from the environmental sources like air, water, &amp; soil is disinfection used by effective microorganisms through spraying, and bokashi mudballs mixed with effective microorganisms for the contaminated waterways.

=== Vaccines ===

Vaccines against anthrax for use in livestock and humans have had a prominent place in the history of medicine. The French scientist Louis Pasteur developed the first effective vaccine in 1881. Human anthrax vaccines were developed by the Soviet Union in the late 1930s and in the US and UK in the 1950s. The current FDA-approved US vaccine was formulated in the 1960s.

Currently administered human anthrax vaccines include acellular subunit vaccine (United States) and live vaccine (Russia) varieties. All currently used anthrax vaccines show considerable local and general reactogenicity (erythema, induration, soreness, fever) and serious adverse reactions occur in about 1% of recipients. The American product, BioThrax, is licensed by the FDA and was formerly administered in a six-dose primary series at 0, 2, 4 weeks and 6, 12, 18 months, with annual boosters to maintain immunity. In 2008, the FDA approved omitting the week-2 dose, resulting in the currently recommended five-dose series. This five-dose series is available to military personnel, scientists who work with anthrax and members of the public who do jobs which cause them to be at-risk. New second-generation vaccines currently being researched include recombinant live vaccines and recombinant subunit vaccines. In the 20th century the use of a modern product (BioThrax) to protect American troops against the use of anthrax in biological warfare was controversial.

=== Antibiotics ===
Preventive antibiotics are recommended in those who have been exposed. Early detection of sources of anthrax infection can allow preventive measures to be taken. In response to the anthrax attacks of October 2001, the United States Postal Service (USPS) installed biodetection systems (BDSs) in their large-scale mail processing facilities. BDS response plans were formulated by the USPS in conjunction with local responders including fire, police, hospitals, and public health. Employees of these facilities have been educated about anthrax, response actions, and prophylactic medication. Because of the time delay inherent in getting final verification that anthrax has been used, prophylactic antibiotic treatment of possibly exposed personnel must be started as soon as possible.

== Treatment ==

Anthrax cannot be spread from person to person, except in the rare case of skin exudates from cutaneous anthrax. However, a person&#x27;s clothing and body may be contaminated with anthrax spores. Effective decontamination of people can be accomplished by a thorough wash-down with antimicrobial soap and water. Wastewater is treated with bleach or another antimicrobial agent. Effective decontamination of articles can be accomplished by boiling them in water for 30 minutes or longer. Chlorine bleach is ineffective in destroying spores and vegetative cells on surfaces, though formaldehyde is effective. Burning clothing is very effective in destroying spores. After decontamination, there is no need to immunize, treat, or isolate contacts of persons ill with anthrax unless they were also exposed to the same source of infection.

=== Antibiotics ===
Early antibiotic treatment of anthrax is essential; delay significantly lessens chances for survival. Treatment for anthrax infection and other bacterial infections includes large doses of intravenous and oral antibiotics, such as fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin), doxycycline, erythromycin, vancomycin, or penicillin. FDA-approved agents include ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and penicillin. In possible cases of pulmonary anthrax, early antibiotic prophylaxis treatment is crucial to prevent possible death. Many attempts have been made to develop new drugs against anthrax, but existing drugs are effective if treatment is started soon enough.

=== Monoclonal antibodies ===
In May 2009, Human Genome Sciences submitted a biologic license application (BLA, permission to market) for its new drug, raxibacumab (brand name ABthrax) intended for emergency treatment of inhaled anthrax. On 14 December 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved raxibacumab injection to treat inhalational anthrax. Raxibacumab is a monoclonal antibody that neutralizes toxins produced by &quot;B. anthracis&quot;. In March 2016, FDA approved a second anthrax treatment using a monoclonal antibody which neutralizes the toxins produced by &quot;B. anthracis&quot;. Obiltoxaximab is approved to treat inhalational anthrax in conjunction with appropriate antibacterial drugs, and for prevention when alternative therapies are not available or appropriate.

=== Biologic for Drug-, Antibody- or Vaccine-resistant Anthrax ===
Treatment of multi-drug resistant, antibody- or vaccine-resistant Anthrax is also possible. Legler, et al. showed that pegylated CapD (capsule depolymerase) could provide protection against 5 LD50 exposures to lethal Ames spores without the use of antibiotics, monoclonal antibodies, or vaccines. The CapD enzyme removes the poly-D-glutamate (PDGA) capsular material from the bacteria, rendering it susceptible to the innate immune responses. The unencapsulated bacteria can then be cleared YouTube Video.
== Prognosis ==
Cutaneous anthrax is rarely fatal if treated, because the infection area is limited to the skin, preventing the lethal factor, edema factor, and protective antigen from entering and destroying a vital organ. Without treatment, up to 20% of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death.

Before 2001, fatality rates for inhalation anthrax were 90%; since then, they have fallen to 45%. People that progress to the fulminant phase of inhalational anthrax nearly always die, with one case study showing a death rate of 97%. Anthrax meningoencephalitis is also nearly always fatal.

Gastrointestinal anthrax infections can be treated, but usually result in fatality rates of 25% to 60%, depending upon how soon treatment commences.

Injection anthrax is the rarest form of anthrax, and has only been seen to have occurred in a group of heroin injecting drug users.

== Animals ==
Anthrax, a bacterial disease caused by &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot;, can have devastating effects on animals. It primarily affects herbivores such as cattle, sheep, and goats, but a wide range of mammals, birds, and even humans can also be susceptible. Infection typically occurs through the ingestion of spores in contaminated soil or plants. Once inside the host, the spores transform into active bacteria, producing lethal toxins that lead to severe symptoms. Infected animals often exhibit high fever, rapid breathing, and convulsions, and they may succumb to the disease within hours to days. The presence of anthrax can pose significant challenges to livestock management and wildlife conservation efforts, making it a critical concern for both animal health and public health, as it can occasionally be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or contaminated products. Infected animals may stagger, have difficulty breathing, tremble, and finally collapse and die within a few hours.

== Epidemiology ==
Globally, at least 2,000 cases occur a year.

=== United States ===
The last fatal case of natural inhalational anthrax in the United States occurred in California in 1976, when a home weaver died after working with infected wool imported from Pakistan. To minimize the chance of spreading the disease, the body was transported to UCLA in a sealed plastic body bag within a sealed metal container for autopsy.

Gastrointestinal anthrax is exceedingly rare in the United States, with only two cases on record. The first case was reported in 1942, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During December 2009, the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services confirmed a case of gastrointestinal anthrax in an adult female. The CDC investigated the source and the possibility that it was contracted from an African drum recently used by the woman taking part in a drum circle. The woman apparently inhaled anthrax, in spore form, from the hide of the drum. She became critically ill, but with gastrointestinal anthrax rather than inhaled anthrax, which made her unique in American medical history. The building where the infection took place was cleaned and reopened to the public and the woman recovered. The New Hampshire state epidemiologist, Jodie Dionne-Odom, stated &quot;It is a mystery. We really don&#x27;t know why it happened.&quot;

In 2007 two cases of cutaneous anthrax were reported in Danbury, Connecticut. The case involved a maker of traditional African-style drums who was working with a goat hide purchased from a dealer in New York City which had been previously cleared by Customs. While the hide was being scraped, a spider bite led to the spores entering the bloodstream. His son also became infected.

=== Croatia ===

In July 2022, dozens of cattle in a nature park in Lonjsko Polje, a flood plain by the Sava river, died of anthrax and 6 people have been hospitalized with light, skin-related symptoms.

===United Kingdom===
In November 2008, a drum maker in the United Kingdom who worked with untreated animal skins died from anthrax. In December 2009, an outbreak of anthrax occurred among heroin addicts in the Glasgow and Stirling areas of Scotland, resulting in 14 deaths. The source of the anthrax is believed to have been dilution of the heroin with bone meal in Afghanistan.

== History ==
=== Discovery ===
Robert Koch, a German physician and scientist, first identified the bacterium that caused the anthrax disease in 1875 in Wollstein (now Wolsztyn, Poland). His pioneering work in the late 19th century was one of the first demonstrations that diseases could be caused by microbes. In a groundbreaking series of experiments, he uncovered the lifecycle and means of transmission of anthrax. His experiments not only helped create an understanding of anthrax but also helped elucidate the role of microbes in causing illness at a time when debates still took place over spontaneous generation versus cell theory. Koch went on to study the mechanisms of other diseases and won the 1905 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the bacterium causing tuberculosis.

Although Koch arguably made the greatest theoretical contribution to understanding anthrax, other researchers were more concerned with the practical questions of how to prevent the disease. In Britain, where anthrax affected workers in the wool, worsted, hides, and tanning industries, it was viewed with fear. John Henry Bell, a doctor born &amp; based in Bradford, first made the link between the mysterious and deadly &quot;woolsorter&#x27;s disease&quot; and anthrax, showing in 1878 that they were one and the same. In the early 20th century, Friederich Wilhelm Eurich, the German bacteriologist who settled in Bradford with his family as a child, carried out important research for the local Anthrax Investigation Board. Eurich also made valuable contributions to a Home Office Departmental Committee of Inquiry, established in 1913 to address the continuing problem of industrial anthrax. His work in this capacity, much of it collaboration with the factory inspector G. Elmhirst Duckering, led directly to the Anthrax Prevention Act (1919).

=== First vaccination ===

Anthrax posed a major economic challenge in France and elsewhere during the 19th century. Horses, cattle, and sheep were particularly vulnerable, and national funds were set aside to investigate the production of a vaccine. French scientist Louis Pasteur was charged with the production of a vaccine, following his successful work in developing methods that helped to protect the important wine and silk industries.

In May 1881, Pasteur – in collaboration with his assistants Jean-Joseph Henri Toussaint, Émile Roux and others – performed a public experiment at Pouilly-le-Fort to demonstrate his concept of vaccination. He prepared two groups of 25 sheep, one goat, and several cattle. The animals of one group were twice injected with an anthrax vaccine prepared by Pasteur, at an interval of 15 days; the control group was left unvaccinated. Thirty days after the first injection, both groups were injected with a culture of live anthrax bacteria. All the animals in the unvaccinated group died, while all of the animals in the vaccinated group survived.

After this apparent triumph, which was widely reported in the local, national, and international press, Pasteur made strenuous efforts to export the vaccine beyond France. He used his celebrity status to establish Pasteur Institutes across Europe and Asia, and his nephew, Adrien Loir, travelled to Australia in 1888 to try to introduce the vaccine to combat anthrax in New South Wales. Ultimately, the vaccine was unsuccessful in the challenging climate of rural Australia, and it was soon superseded by a more robust version developed by local researchers John Gunn and John McGarvie Smith.

The human vaccine for anthrax became available in 1954. This was a cell-free vaccine instead of the live-cell Pasteur-style vaccine used for veterinary purposes. An improved cell-free vaccine became available in 1970.

=== Engineered strains ===

* The Sterne strain of anthrax, named after the Trieste-born immunologist Max Sterne, is an attenuated strain used as a vaccine, which contains only the anthrax toxin virulence plasmid and not the polyglutamic acid capsule expressing plasmid.
* Strain 836, created by the Soviet bioweapons program in the 1980s, was later called by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; &quot;the most virulent and vicious strain of anthrax known to man&quot;.
* The virulent Ames strain, which was used in the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, has received the most news coverage of any anthrax outbreak. The Ames strain contains two virulence plasmids, which separately encode for a three-protein toxin, called anthrax toxin, and a polyglutamic acid capsule.
* Nonetheless, the Vollum strain, developed but never used as a biological weapon during the Second World War, is much more dangerous. The Vollum (also incorrectly referred to as Vellum) strain was isolated in 1935 from a cow in Oxfordshire. This same strain was used during the Gruinard bioweapons trials. A variation of Vollum, known as &quot;Vollum 1B&quot;, was used during the 1960s in the US and UK bioweapon programs. Vollum 1B is widely believed to have been isolated from William A. Boyles, a 46-year-old scientist at the US Army Biological Warfare Laboratories at Camp (later Fort) Detrick, Maryland, who died in 1951 after being accidentally infected with the Vollum strain.

== Society and culture ==
=== Site cleanup ===
Anthrax spores can survive for very long periods of time in the environment after release. Chemical methods for cleaning anthrax-contaminated sites or materials may use oxidizing agents such as peroxides, ethylene oxide, Sandia Foam, chlorine dioxide (used in the Hart Senate Office Building), peracetic acid, ozone gas, hypochlorous acid, sodium persulfate, and liquid bleach products containing sodium hypochlorite. Nonoxidizing agents shown to be effective for anthrax decontamination include methyl bromide, formaldehyde, and metam sodium. These agents destroy bacterial spores. All of the aforementioned anthrax decontamination technologies have been demonstrated to be effective in laboratory tests conducted by the US EPA or others.

Decontamination techniques for &quot;Bacillus anthracis&quot; spores are affected by the material with which the spores are associated, environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, and microbiological factors such as the spore species, anthracis strain, and test methods used.

A bleach solution for treating hard surfaces has been approved by the EPA. Chlorine dioxide has emerged as the preferred biocide against anthrax-contaminated sites, having been employed in the treatment of numerous government buildings over the past decade. Its chief drawback is the need for &quot;in situ&quot; processes to have the reactant on demand.

To speed the process, trace amounts of a nontoxic catalyst composed of iron and tetroamido macrocyclic ligands are combined with sodium carbonate and bicarbonate and converted into a spray. The spray formula is applied to an infested area and is followed by another spray containing tert-butyl hydroperoxide.

Using the catalyst method, complete destruction of all anthrax spores can be achieved in under 30 minutes. A standard catalyst-free spray destroys fewer than half the spores in the same amount of time.

Cleanups at a Senate Office Building, several contaminated postal facilities, and other US government and private office buildings, a collaborative effort headed by the Environmental Protection Agency showed decontamination to be possible, but time-consuming and costly. Clearing the Senate Office Building of anthrax spores cost $27 million, according to the Government Accountability Office. Cleaning the Brentwood postal facility in Washington cost $130 million and took 26 months. Since then, newer and less costly methods have been developed.

Cleanup of anthrax-contaminated areas on ranches and in the wild is much more problematic. Carcasses may be burned, though often 3 days are needed to burn a large carcass and this is not feasible in areas with little wood. Carcasses may also be buried, though the burying of large animals deeply enough to prevent resurfacing of spores requires much manpower and expensive tools. Carcasses have been soaked in formaldehyde to kill spores, though this has environmental contamination issues. Block burning of vegetation in large areas enclosing an anthrax outbreak has been tried; this, while environmentally destructive, causes healthy animals to move away from an area with carcasses in search of fresh grass. Some wildlife workers have experimented with covering fresh anthrax carcasses with shadecloth and heavy objects. This prevents some scavengers from opening the carcasses, thus allowing the putrefactive bacteria within the carcass to kill the vegetative &quot;B. anthracis&quot; cells and preventing sporulation. This method also has drawbacks, as scavengers such as hyenas are capable of infiltrating almost any exclosure.

The experimental site at Gruinard Island is said to have been decontaminated with a mixture of formaldehyde and seawater by the Ministry of Defence. It is not clear whether similar treatments had been applied to US test sites.

=== Biological warfare ===
Anthrax spores have been used as a biological warfare weapon. Its first modern incidence occurred when Nordic rebels, supplied by the German General Staff, used anthrax with unknown results against the Imperial Russian Army in Finland in 1916. Anthrax was first tested as a biological warfare agent by Unit 731 of the Japanese Kwantung Army in Manchuria during the 1930s; some of this testing involved intentional infection of prisoners of war, thousands of whom died. Anthrax, designated at the time as Agent N, was also investigated by the Allies in the 1940s.

In 1942, British scientists at Porton Down began research on Operation Vegetarian, an ultimately unused biowarfare military operation plan which called for animal feed pellets containing linseed infected with anthrax spores of the Vollum-14578 strain to be dropped by air over the countryside of Nazi Germany. The pellets would be eaten by cattle, which would in turn be eaten by the human population and as such severely disrupt the German war effort. In the same year, bioweapons tests were carried out on the uninhabited Gruinard Island in the Scottish Highlands, with Porton Down scientists studying the effect of anthrax on the island&#x27;s population of sheep. Ultimately, five million pellets were created, though plans to drop them over Germany using Royal Air Force bombers in 1944 were scrapped after the success of Operation Overlord and the subsequent Allied liberation of France. All pellets were destroyed using incinerators in 1945. 
Weaponized anthrax was part of the US stockpile prior to 1972, when the United States signed the Biological Weapons Convention. President Nixon ordered the dismantling of US biowarfare programs in 1969 and the destruction of all existing stockpiles of bioweapons. In 1978–79, the Rhodesian government used anthrax against cattle and humans during its campaign against rebels. The Soviet Union created and stored 100 to 200 tons of anthrax spores at Kantubek on Vozrozhdeniya Island; they were abandoned in 1992 and destroyed in 2002.

American military and British Army personnel are no longer routinely vaccinated against anthrax prior to active service in places where biological attacks are considered a threat.

==== Sverdlovsk incident (2 April 1979) ====

Despite signing the 1972 agreement to end bioweapon production, the government of the Soviet Union had an active bioweapons program that included the production of hundreds of tons of anthrax after this period. On 2 April 1979, some of the over one million people living in Sverdlovsk (now called Ekaterinburg, Russia), about east of Moscow, were exposed to an accidental release of anthrax from a biological weapons complex located near there. At least 94 people were infected, of whom at least 68 died. One victim died four days after the release, 10 over an eight-day period at the peak of the deaths, and the last six weeks later. Extensive cleanup, vaccinations, and medical interventions managed to save about 30 of the victims. Extensive cover-ups and destruction of records by the KGB continued from 1979 until Russian President Boris Yeltsin admitted this anthrax accident in 1992. Jeanne Guillemin reported in 1999 that a combined Russian and United States team investigated the accident in 1992.

Nearly all of the night-shift workers of a ceramics plant directly across the street from the biological facility (compound 19) became infected, and most died. Since most were men, some NATO governments suspected the Soviet Union had developed a sex-specific weapon. The government blamed the outbreak on the consumption of anthrax-tainted meat, and ordered the confiscation of all uninspected meat that entered the city. They also ordered all stray dogs to be shot and people not have contact with sick animals. Also, a voluntary evacuation and anthrax vaccination program was established for people from 18 to 55.

To support the cover-up story, Soviet medical and legal journals published articles about an outbreak in livestock that caused gastrointestinal anthrax in people having consumed infected meat, and cutaneous anthrax in people having come into contact with the animals. All medical and public health records were confiscated by the KGB. In addition to the medical problems the outbreak caused, it also prompted Western countries to be more suspicious of a covert Soviet bioweapons program and to increase their surveillance of suspected sites. In 1986, the US government was allowed to investigate the incident, and concluded the exposure was from aerosol anthrax from a military weapons facility. In 1992, President Yeltsin admitted he was &quot;absolutely certain&quot; that &quot;rumors&quot; about the Soviet Union violating the 1972 Bioweapons Treaty were true. The Soviet Union, like the US and UK, had agreed to submit information to the UN about their bioweapons programs, but omitted known facilities and never acknowledged their weapons program.

==== Anthrax bioterrorism ====
In theory, anthrax spores can be cultivated with minimal special equipment and a first-year collegiate microbiological education.
To make large amounts of an aerosol form of anthrax suitable for biological warfare requires extensive practical knowledge, training, and highly advanced equipment.

Concentrated anthrax spores were used for bioterrorism in the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States, delivered by mailing postal letters containing the spores. The letters were sent to several news media offices and two Democratic senators: Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. As a result, 22 were infected and five died. Only a few grams of material were used in these attacks and in August 2008, the US Department of Justice announced they believed that Bruce Ivins, a senior biodefense researcher employed by the United States government, was responsible. These events also spawned many anthrax hoaxes.

Due to these events, the US Postal Service installed biohazard detection systems at its major distribution centers to actively scan for anthrax being transported through the mail. As of 2020, no positive alerts by these systems have occurred.

==== Decontaminating mail ====
In response to the postal anthrax attacks and hoaxes, the United States Postal Service sterilized some mail using gamma irradiation and treatment with a proprietary enzyme formula supplied by Sipco Industries.

A scientific experiment performed by a high school student, later published in the &quot;Journal of Medical Toxicology&quot;, suggested a domestic electric iron at its hottest setting (at least ) used for at least 5 minutes should destroy all anthrax spores in a common postal envelope.

== Other animals ==
Anthrax is especially rare in dogs and cats, as is evidenced by a single reported case in the United States in 2001. Anthrax outbreaks occur in some wild animal populations with some regularity.

Russian researchers estimate arctic permafrost contains around 1.5 million anthrax-infected reindeer carcasses, and the spores may survive in the permafrost for 105 years. A risk exists that global warming in the Arctic can thaw the permafrost, releasing anthrax spores in the carcasses. In 2016, an anthrax outbreak in reindeer was linked to a 75-year-old carcass that defrosted during a heat wave.

<text>Anthrax is an American thrash metal band from New York City, formed in 1981 by rhythm guitarist Scott Ian and bassist Dan Lilker. The group is considered one of the leaders of the thrash metal scene from the 1980s and is part of the &quot;Big Four&quot; of the genre, along with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer. They were also one of the first thrash metal bands (along with Overkill and Nuclear Assault) to emerge from the East Coast. The band&#x27;s current lineup consists of Scott Ian, drummer Charlie Benante, bassist Frank Bello, vocalist Joey Belladonna and lead guitarist Jonathan Donais. Anthrax&#x27;s lineup has changed numerous times over their career, leaving Ian as the only constant member of the band. Ian and Benante (who replaced one-time drummer Greg D&#x27;Angelo in 1983) are the only two members to appear on all of Anthrax&#x27;s albums, while Bello has been a member of Anthrax since 1984, replacing Lilker.

After cycling through a number of members, Anthrax released their debut album, &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; (1984), with singer Neil Turbin. Turbin was replaced by Joey Belladonna later that year, stabilizing the band&#x27;s lineup. Anthrax&#x27;s third album &quot;Among the Living&quot; (1987), which brought the band mainstream success for the first time, is recognized as one of the greatest thrash metal albums. The band&#x27;s next two outings, &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; (1988) and &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; (1990), further cemented their reputation as one of the most successful thrash metal bands, with the latter giving Anthrax their first Grammy Award nomination. In 1992, Anthrax signed to Elektra Records for $10 million and Belladonna was replaced by John Bush of Armored Saint. Bush&#x27;s first album with Anthrax, &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; (1993), reached number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart (their greatest chart success) and spawned the radio hit &quot;Only&quot;. Anthrax&#x27;s subsequent albums with Bush would experience less critical and commercial success; the band would part ways with Elektra following the release of &quot;Stomp 442&quot; (1995) due to a lack of promotional support, and &quot;Volume 8: The Threat is Real&quot; (1998) suffered from the bankruptcy of their record label.

Bush left Anthrax in 2005, after which the band reunited with Belladonna and lead guitarist Dan Spitz. After Belladonna and Spitz&#x27;s departure in 2007, Anthrax recruited singer Dan Nelson and commenced work on a new album, although Nelson would part ways with the band in 2009. Following a short-lived reunion with Bush, Belladonna rejoined the band for a third time in 2010. Anthrax&#x27;s first album with Belladonna in 21 years, &quot;Worship Music&quot; (2011) was released to critical and commercial success, reaching number twelve on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band&#x27;s most recent album to date, &quot;For All Kings&quot;, was released in 2016.

Anthrax has released 11 studio albums, several other albums, and 26 singles, including collaborating on a single with American hip hop group Public Enemy. Four of the band&#x27;s studio albums (&quot;Among the Living&quot;, &quot;State of Euphoria&quot;, &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; and &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot;) have also achieved gold certifications by the RIAA. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Anthrax sold 2.5 million records in the United States from 1991 to 2004, with total worldwide sales of ten million.

==History==

===Formation (1981–1982)===
Anthrax was formed in Queens, New York City, on July 18, 1981, by guitarists Scott Ian and Dan Lilker, with Ian&#x27;s friend Dave Weiss on drums. The band was named after the disease of the same name which Ian saw in a biology textbook, chosen because it sounded &quot;sufficiently evil&quot;. Lilker originally intended for Scott Setari to play bass in the band, during their early phases as a cover band. Anthrax&#x27;s initial lineup was completed by singer John Connelly, and bassist Paul Kahn. Kahn was briefly replaced by bassist Kenny Kushner before Lilker took over on bass. Future Hittman singer Dirk Kennedy replaced Connelly for a few months and the band brought in lead guitarist Greg Walls. Weiss was then replaced early on by drummer Greg D&#x27;Angelo, who was recommended to the band by Walls. Ian&#x27;s younger brother Jason Rosenfeld had been a temporary vocalist until Ian&#x27;s former schoolmate Neil Turbin joined the band in late August 1982. Turbin joined the band partly because of guitarist Walls, who Turbin later said was &quot;the best guitarist Anthrax ever had&quot;. The band recorded its first demo tape during this time.

===Neil Turbin era and debut album (1982–1984)===
The band&#x27;s first performance with Neil Turbin was at Great Gildersleeves, a New York club, in September 1982. This lineup played regularly in the New York–New Jersey area over the next several months. Anthrax was also on the same bill as then-up-and-coming Metallica for several shows in the spring of 1983. Guitarist Walls left Anthrax that summer because of friction with Ian, and drummer D&#x27;Angelo left a month later. Turbin said he was seriously considering leaving because of the loss of Walls and D&#x27;Angelo, but he stuck it out for another year. Walls was replaced by Bob Berry, who was recommended to Turbin by Rhett Forrester of Riot. Berry was in turn soon replaced by Dan Spitz, who was previously a member of the New Jersey thrash band Overkill.

Drummer Charlie Benante replaced D&#x27;Angelo in September 1983 after a several-month courtship by Ian. By this time, Ian and Lilker had befriended New Jersey record store owner Jon Zazula, to whom they had given their demo tapes to critique. Zazula&#x27;s new record label Megaforce Records had recently released Metallica&#x27;s debut album &quot;Kill &#x27;Em All&quot; to great success. In late 1983, Zazula agreed to sign Anthrax and the band recorded the &quot;Soldiers of Metal&quot; single, which was produced by Ross the Boss of Manowar. The B-side was the song &quot;Howling Furies&quot; which was taken from a previous demo with Greg D&#x27;Angelo on drums (his only Anthrax recording).

Anthrax released their debut album &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; in January 1984. Former guitarist Walls said he was shocked that the album was released without giving credit to Walls as the primary songwriter on &quot;Panic&quot; and &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot;, as well as smaller songwriting contributions throughout the album. Tensions were building between Lilker and Turbin for various reasons, eventually leading to Turbin firing Lilker without informing the rest of the band. He would soon form the band Nuclear Assault with former Anthrax roadie / vocalist John Connelly. Lilker was replaced by Benante&#x27;s nephew and roadie Frank Bello. The band then went on a successful US tour opening for Raven and others to support &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot;.

In August 1984, Turbin and Anthrax went their separate ways after long-standing personal issues. In his book &quot;Eddie Trunk&#x27;s Essential Hard Rock and Heavy Metal&quot;, music journalist Eddie Trunk admits pressuring Jon Zazula, Scott Ian and Anthrax into firing Turbin because of his personal taste in vocals. Singer Matt Fallon was briefly hired in late 1984, but he and the band soon parted ways. The remaining members decided to play live shows as a four-piece billed as &quot;The Diseased&quot; with Scott Ian on vocals, performing hardcore punk covers until a permanent singer could be found.

===Joey Belladonna era (1984–1992)===
In 1984, Joey Belladonna was chosen as the new vocalist. The &quot;Armed and Dangerous&quot; EP marked Belladonna&#x27;s recording debut with Anthrax. The 1992 reissue of the EP included the two songs from the &quot;Soldiers of Metal&quot; single that had Neil Turbin performing on them.

Anthrax&#x27;s second album &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; was released in October 1985. It was well-received as both a technical leap forward from &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot; and as a more original effort, and remains one of the band&#x27;s most highly regarded albums. With leftover studio time from these sessions, Ian, Benante and former bandmate Dan Lilker collaborated with vocalist Billy Milano to form the side project Stormtroopers of Death, and recorded the album &quot;Speak English or Die&quot; in three days. It was released in August 1985 and is now considered a pioneering crossover thrash release, featuring one of the earliest examples of a blast beat on record. Afterwards, the project was put on hold as Ian and Benante turned their focus back on Anthrax.

The US tour to support &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; opening for Black Sabbath was canceled after four dates due to Sabbath singer Glenn Hughes&#x27; voice problems. In April 1986, Anthrax attempted its first tour of Europe beginning in Bochum, Germany, supported by Overkill and Agent Steel. The tour included a show near Chernobyl, Ukraine, immediately after the Chernobyl disaster. Later that year, Anthrax toured Europe with Metallica. The tour began on September 10 at St David&#x27;s Hall and ended on September 26 in Solnahallen, Sweden. The Swedish show was Anthrax&#x27;s last performance before the bus accident the following day, which killed Metallica bassist Cliff Burton.

The band&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Among the Living&quot; was released in March 1987, and is often considered by both the band and critics to be a major breakthrough for Anthrax. Produced by Eddie Kramer, it showcased the band&#x27;s humorous, experimental side and began a lyrical trend focusing on movies, politics, comic books and Stephen King novels. The album was dedicated to Cliff Burton&#x27;s memory. Propelled by the singles &quot;Indians&quot; and &quot;I Am the Law&quot;, the success of &quot;Among the Living&quot; not only turned Anthrax into a household name (along with the remaining &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal–Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer), but eventually earned them one of their first certified-gold records by the RIAA. &quot;I Am the Law&quot;, which was released as the album&#x27;s second single, was backed with a rap-metal hybrid &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot; as its B-side. Anthrax further indulged its appreciation for rap by appearing on the title track of U.T.F.O.&#x27;s album, &quot;Lethal&quot;, and their worship for the genre was also attributed to Ian wearing a t-shirt of Public Enemy both on stage and for publicity photo shoots; in response, Public Enemy name-checked Anthrax in the lyrics to their 1988 single &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;. Anthrax toured for over a year to promote &quot;Among the Living&quot;, touring Europe again with Metallica, the United States with Metal Church, Testament, D.R.I., Exodus and Celtic Frost, and supporting Kiss on their &quot;Crazy Nights&quot; tour.

Anthrax released their fourth album &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; in September 1988, and it was produced by Mark Dodson, who had previously worked with Judas Priest, U.D.O. and Metal Church. While the album was not quite as well-received as &quot;Among the Living&quot;, owing to its &quot;rushed&quot; finish, &quot;State of Euphoria&quot; was certified gold about five months after its release, and one of the singles &quot;Antisocial&quot;, originally by French heavy metal band Trust, became an MTV staple as part of the rotation on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;. By 1989, Anthrax was starting to play at arenas as a headlining or opening act, first supporting Ozzy Osbourne on his &quot;No Rest for the Wicked&quot; tour in North America, and then headlining European tours with Living Colour, Suicidal Tendencies and King&#x27;s X, and the U.S. Headbangers Ball Tour with Exodus and Helloween. Also in 1989, MTV sponsored a contest in which the winner had her home trashed by the band. This would later inspire Anthrax&#x27;s 1992 appearance on the television series &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, in which the Bundys win a similar TV contest.

Anthrax returned to the studio at the end of 1989 to work on their fifth album, again with Dodson as the producer. Released in August 1990, &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; was written and recorded during a period of turmoil for Anthrax, as Ian had recently been divorced from his first wife, and the middle of the recording session was interrupted by a fire that caused the band to lose more than $100,000 worth of gear and their rehearsal studio. The band members also claimed it was during this period that there were talks of potentially working with a different singer, a situation that Belladonna was unaware of at the time. Considered by fans to be their serious effort, &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; was darker, more technical and more progressive than the band&#x27;s previous work, striking a chord with metal fans wary of Anthrax&#x27;s &quot;silly&quot; side. The most successful single from the album was a cover of Joe Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Got the Time&quot;, which Jackson said he enjoyed. &quot;Persistence of Time&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA in early 1991, and the band toured for nearly two years to promote the album, opening for Iron Maiden on their &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; tour in Europe and North America, and appearing on the Clash of the Titans tour with Megadeth, Slayer and opening act Alice in Chains.

In 1991, Anthrax collaborated with Public Enemy on a version of &quot;Bring the Noise&quot;. This was a hit, and a successful tour with Public Enemy followed. &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; has been a live staple for Anthrax since they first played it in concert in 1989. The compilation &quot;Attack of the Killer B&#x27;s&quot; was released in 1991, and featured three tracks from their 1989 EP &quot;Penikufesin&quot;, a new version of &quot;I&#x27;m the Man&quot; and a cover of &quot;Bring the Noise&quot; on which Ian did some vocals.

===John Bush era (1992–2005)===

In early 1992, shortly after signing a $10 million record deal with Elektra Records and following their appearance in &quot;Married... with Children&quot;, Belladonna was fired from Anthrax over creative and stylistic differences. After firing Belladonna, the remaining members of Anthrax auditioned several vocalists including Mark Osegueda of Death Angel and Spike Xavier of Mind Over Four. However, Armored Saint vocalist John Bush was the standout favorite and had in fact been floated as a potential replacement for Belladonna a few years earlier, due to questions about his reliability stemming from drug and alcohol abuse. The band&#x27;s first album with Bush and for Elektra, &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot;, was released in 1993. Produced by Dave Jerden (then-known for his work with Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Alice in Chains), the album marked a change from Anthrax&#x27;s earlier work, with a dark sound influenced by alternative rock, and it received mostly positive reviews. Critic Dave Connolley of AllMusic wrote that Bush &quot;has a lower-register voice than Belladonna, and the result is menacing, premeditated, and sinister.&quot; The song &quot;Only&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s first single. In the liner notes for &quot;Return of the Killer A&#x27;s&quot;, Ian said that James Hetfield told him it was a &quot;perfect song&quot;. In keeping with the band&#x27;s eye for unlikely collaborations, classical composer Angelo Badalamenti provided music for &quot;Black Lodge&quot; (a nod to &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;). This album demonstrated that Anthrax had fully shed its cartoonish persona in favor of mature, thoughtful songwriting, which began with &quot;Persistence of Time&quot;. The success of &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; dissolved any fan worries that the band would not recover from their split with Belladonna; it was certified gold by the RIAA nearly two months after its release, and gave Anthrax their highest chart position to date at number seven on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album also saw Anthrax continuing to headline arenas and theaters or amphitheaters, taking several bands such as Suicidal Tendencies, White Zombie, Quicksand, Fight and Clawfinger out as supporting acts.

After &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; longtime guitarist Dan Spitz left the band to become a watchmaker, leaving Anthrax a quartet temporarily. In 1995, Anthrax released their seventh studio album &quot;Stomp 442&quot;, on which Charlie Benante played most of the lead-guitar parts. Benante was assisted by Paul Crook, who later became the band&#x27;s touring lead guitarist for several years, and Dimebag Darrell of Pantera. The album&#x27;s release followed a shake-up at Elektra the year before, which saw the firing of the label&#x27;s president, Bob Krasnow, who was replaced by Sylvia Rhone. During a meeting with the band, Rhone told Anthrax that she wouldn&#x27;t have signed their record deal. Elektra did not promote &quot;Stomp 442&quot;, and it was less commercially successful than its predecessor. Frustrated by this, Anthrax severed its ties with the label.

In late 1997, Anthrax signed with Ignition Records, an independent label distributed by Tommy Boy Records. The label released &quot;Volume 8: The Threat Is Real&quot; in July 1998. As on &quot;Stomp 442&quot;, Benante performed lead guitar parts along with Crook and Darrell. The album also features Pantera vocalist Phil Anselmo making a guest vocal appearance. Towards the end of 1998, Tommy Boy ended its distribution deal with Ignition, after which the label went bankrupt, disrupting its distribution. Anthrax then signed with Beyond Records, who released the greatest-hits album &quot;Return of the Killer A&#x27;s&quot; (1999), after which Beyond went out of business as well. During this period a two-vocalist tour with Belladonna and Bush was planned, but Belladonna decided not to participate at the last minute; however, on the mentioned &quot;Return of the Killer A&#x27;s&quot; compilation, a cover of The Temptations song &quot;Ball of Confusion&quot; was recorded with the then-current lineup of the band (Ian/Benante/Bello/Bush/Crook), in addition to former vocalist Belladonna and former bassist Lilker. This is the only song to feature both Belladonna and Bush on co-vocals.

Despite hardships and legal entanglements over album rights, Anthrax continued. In 2001, Rob Caggiano joined the band on lead guitar. During the 2001 anthrax attacks in the United States the band changed its website, providing information about the disease after people began searching &quot;anthrax.com&quot; on internet search engines. Amid a potential PR nightmare, Anthrax issued a press release on October 10, 2001, joking that the band&#x27;s name would be changed to &quot;something more friendly, like &#x27;Basket Full of Puppies&#x27;.&quot; Anthrax dispelled any name-change rumors derived from the press release at the November 2001 New York Steel 9/11 benefit concert, when they took the stage in boiler suits with a different word on each one which ultimately read &quot;We&#x27;re not changing our name&quot;. Bello has stated they did so after receiving support from members of the NYPD and FDNY, who believed that changing the name of the band would send the wrong message. A picture of the band in the suits is on the inner tray card of &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot;.
In 2003, the band signed to Sanctuary Records and released their ninth studio album &quot;We&#x27;ve Come for You All&quot;, praised by metal journalists as a return to form. The band then spent the summer of 2003 on tour with Motörhead.

In early 2004, Anthrax released &quot;The Greater of Two Evils&quot;, a &quot;live in the studio&quot; re-recording of the earlier work with the band&#x27;s then-current lineup. Bassist Frank Bello announced shortly afterwards that he was leaving the band to join Helmet, and was replaced by Fates Warning and Armored Saint member Joey Vera.

===Reunions with Belladonna and Bush (2005–2010)===
In April 2005, Anthrax announced that the &quot;classic&quot; lineup of Scott Ian, Charlie Benante, Dan Spitz, Joey Belladonna and Frank Bello would reform. At some shows on the following tour, they played &quot;Among the Living&quot; in its entirety. Although the lineup was expected to record a new album after the tour, in January 2007 Ian said that Belladonna had not agreed to a reunion. John Bush also said he wasn&#x27;t ready to re-commit to Anthrax and said he had been asked to return but had declined. Asked if he wanted to rejoin the band when Belladonna left, Bush said that he &quot;just didn&#x27;t feel right to do that.&quot;

In December 2007, it was announced that the band&#x27;s new vocalist would be Dan Nelson, formerly of Devilsize, and Rob Caggiano would return as lead guitarist. In May 2008, Anthrax played its first show in 19 months at Double Door in Chicago.

In his monthly Food Coma column posted in December 2008, Scott Ian wrote that he had &quot;been in the studio working on the new Anthrax album&quot;, promising to be &quot;giving birth to a really pissed off, loud, fast and heavy child.&quot; He later wrote that the album was being mixed by Dave Fortman, who had worked with Evanescence and Slipknot.

In early 2009, Anthrax began a brief tour opening for Iron Maiden in South America. In July, band manager Izvor Zivkovic confirmed the departure of Dan Nelson due to illness. Nelson denied this, saying that he was fired. All subsequent performances were canceled except the August UK Sonisphere Festival, which featured John Bush on vocals. Fan response after his performance led to a &quot;Bring Back Bush&quot; campaign, which was endorsed by Ian.

Soon afterwards, Benante said that Bush had rejoined the band. In February 2010, Anthrax performed five shows as part of Soundwave in Australia. After the Australian shows, Bush said the band intended to re-record the vocals of several tracks from the upcoming album.

===&quot;Worship Music&quot; and &quot;For All Kings&quot; (2010–2017)===
In late 2009, Anthrax confirmed their participation in several &quot;Big Four&quot; concerts with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer as part of the 2010 Sonisphere Festival dates in Europe. John Bush decided that he did not want to commit to the band full-time, and left Anthrax for the second time. Joey Belladonna returned to the band in early 2010 for the Sonisphere dates as well as committing to record a new studio album with the band. In June 2010 Anthrax, Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer performed on the same bill for the first time ever at seven Sonisphere shows. The Sofia, Bulgaria show was broadcast in cinemas and later released on DVD and Blu-ray. The bands would also play a few shows in the U.S. the following year, including a concert at Yankee Stadium in September 2011.

In April 2011, Anthrax headlined in the Philippines for the first time at the annual Pulp Summer Slam with Death Angel and Hellyeah. The band also headlined the Jägermeister side stage at the Mayhem Festival of 2012, co-headlined by Slayer and Slipknot, and toured with Testament and Death Angel. In June Anthrax released the single &quot;Fight &#x27;Em &#x27;Til You Can&#x27;t&quot; from the then-upcoming new album on their website as a free download to thank fans for their patience in waiting several years for new material. &quot;Worship Music&quot; was released on September 12, 2011, and debuted at #12 on the Billboard Top 200 album charts, their highest chart position since &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; in 1993.

In January 2013, Anthrax announced that lead guitarist Rob Caggiano had left the band to join Volbeat. It was announced shortly afterwards that Jonathan Donais of Shadows Fall had been hired as the band&#x27;s touring lead guitarist. Donais was confirmed as an official member in August of that year. In March, Anthrax released the &quot;Anthems&quot; EP featuring cover versions of 1970s rock songs as well as two new versions of the song &quot;Crawl&quot; from &quot;Worship Music&quot;. According to Ian, the band began working on its next studio album in late 2013. They released a live DVD, &quot;Chile on Hell&quot; in 2014 which featured the band&#x27;s 2013 performance at the Teatro Caupolican in Santiago, Chile. In early 2015, the band confirmed that they had recorded new material and embarked on a tour with Volbeat.
Since Belladonna&#x27;s return to Anthrax, the band has been nominated for three Grammys, in 2012, 2013, and 2014.

The band began 2016 with a short US tour with Lamb of God and released their eleventh studio album &quot;For All Kings&quot; on February 26, 2016. The album debuted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts at number 9, surpassing the number 12 debut of &quot;Worship Music&quot;. In March, they opened for Iron Maiden on the Latin American leg of their The Book of Souls World Tour. Anthrax spent the summer playing festivals in Europe before embarking on a fall US and Canadian tour with Slayer and Death Angel. The band continued to tour within the next two years, embarking on The Killthrax Tour with Killswitch Engage twice (in 2017 and 2018), and along with Lamb of God, Behemoth, Testament, Napalm Death and Obituary, they supported Slayer on their final world tour from May to December 2018.

On February 1, 2017, the band embarked on the 70,000 Tons of Metal cruise. They played two sets and became the first of the &quot;Big Four&quot; to attend the open seas festival. During the theater set, they played a cover of Stormtroopers of Death&#x27;s &quot;March of the S.O.D.&quot; and debuted the song &quot;Blood Eagle Wings&quot;.

===Upcoming twelfth studio album (2017–present)===
Anthrax released the live album and DVD &quot;Kings Among Scotland&quot; in 2018 which was recorded during their Glasgow, Scotland show on the &quot;For All Kings&quot; tour.

In a March 2017 interview, drummer Charlie Benante hinted that Anthrax would begin working on their twelfth studio album that summer. He also revealed that there are a few unreleased tracks from the &quot;For All Kings&quot; sessions that could serve as a genesis for the follow-up album, stating, &quot;I think there are two or three that we could dust off and use as a starting point.&quot; When asked in May 2018 if they were working on the album, guitarist Scott Ian stated, &quot;Very, very, very preliminary stages. There&#x27;s a couple of really great riffs. Charlie&#x27;s sent around some really great ideas. But we haven&#x27;t actually started working on anything. We&#x27;ve just been too busy touring.&quot; A month later, bassist Frank Bello claimed that Anthrax had intended to be back in the studio by mid-2018, but because they agreed to open for Slayer on their farewell tour, they were not expected to start writing their new album until at 2019 at the earliest. In a November 2020 interview with &quot;Full Metal Jackie&quot;, Ian stated that Anthrax would &quot;certainly be ready to make a record next year&quot;, but added that its release date could be pushed back to 2022: &quot;In my brain, I don&#x27;t wanna put a record out until I can play shows.&quot; He later stated that &quot;at some point there should be a [new Anthrax] record&quot; in 2023. In April 2023, Benante said the band would begin recording the new album in two weeks for a 2024 release. Frontman Joey Belladonna began recording his vocals on November 5, 2023.

The band&#x27;s recording of &quot;Antisocial&quot; was prominently featured in the 2017 movie &quot;It&quot; but was not included on its official soundtrack release.

Anthrax – alongside Testament, Corrosion of Conformity, Armored Saint, DevilDriver, John 5, Doro and Metal Church – participated in Megadeth&#x27;s first-ever cruise called &quot;Megacruise&quot;, which took place in October 2019. They resumed live activity during the summer and fall of 2021, with a livestream performance that saw the band celebrate its 40th anniversary, as well as appearances at U.S. festivals such as Aftershock and Welcome to Rockville.

Although 2021 marked the band&#x27;s 40th anniversary, the planned global anniversary tour was delayed due to travel complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic; instead, the band performed a livestream concert on July 16 of that year. The tour was delayed to 2022, with a North American leg beginning on July 16 with Black Label Society and Hatebreed as support, followed by a European tour to begin on September 27 with Municipal Waste, and then they toured North America again in January and February 2023 with Black Label Society and Exodus. The band also released the full livestream setlist as a live album under the title &quot;XL&quot; on July 15, 2022.

On March 28, 2024, it was announced that original Anthrax bassist Dan Lilker would be performing with the band for the first time in 40 years on their spring 2024 tour dates by filling in for Bello, who was unable to perform due to &quot;personal reasons&quot;.

Anthrax co-headlined a European tour with Kreator in November and December 2024, with Testament as the opening act. Along with Metallica, Slayer, Pantera, Alice in Chains and Mastodon, the band will serve as one of the opening acts of Black Sabbath&#x27;s one-off reunion show at Villa Park on July 5, 2025. This gig will mark the first time in nearly fifteen years, since the &quot;Big Four&quot; concert series, that Anthrax has shared the stage together with both Metallica and Slayer.

==Ex-members incidents==
In 2012, Anthrax and former vocalist Dan Nelson reached an undisclosed settlement after the vocalist was fired during a 2009 tour.

In October 2014, ex-vocalist Neil Turbin accused guitarist Scott Ian of &quot;fabricating lies&quot; about his split with the band in 1984 to &quot;draw attention&quot; to Ian&#x27;s autobiography.

In October 2015, former guitarist Dan Spitz took issue with a 2004 Guitar.com article (since offline) which suggested that the band&#x27;s drummer, Charlie Benante, was responsible for laying down lead guitar on many of the group&#x27;s classic songs.

In a 2016 interview with Metal Voice, and again in a video that he uploaded to YouTube in December 2020, former guitarist Greg Walls claimed that he had contributed to the writing of the songs on the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Fistful of Metal&quot;, specifically claiming to have written all the music to &quot;Metal Thrashing Mad&quot; and the majority of &quot;Panic&quot; but the band copyrighted the songs without his credit. In the same videos, Walls also claimed that he told Scott to drop the name &quot;Rosenfeld&quot; and simply go by &quot;Scott Ian&quot;.

==Musical style, influences, and legacy==
Anthrax is one of the bands responsible for the emergence of speed metal and thrash metal. It exhibited a typical thrash metal sound on its early albums and was known for humor and comic book references in the lyrics, distinguishing the band from its contemporaries. According to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Anthrax was one of the few heavy metal bands to receive critical praise and redefine the genre during the 1980s. Original guitarists Scott Ian and Dan Spitz&#x27; styles were described as &quot;aggressive and head pounding&quot;, with power chords and &quot;chugging&quot; pedal points providing the sonic drive. Author Thomas Harrison wrote that Anthrax played metal at a faster tempo because of its punk influences. It is said that many pioneering thrash musicians, such as Anthrax, were influenced equally by heavy metal and punk rock. In 1989, Brad Tolinski of &quot;Guitar World&quot; magazine noted that, &quot;If Exodus is a speed metal equivalent of the Rolling Stones, then New York-based Anthrax must surely be the genre&#x27;s Beatles.&quot; The band&#x27;s sixth album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;Sound of White Noise&quot; (its first with singer John Bush), incorporated grunge and alternative metal influences in a darker vein. Critics consider the band&#x27;s studio releases from the Bush era as having a more alternative metal, grunge and groove metal sound. The album &quot;Worship Music&quot; marked a return to thrash metal and the return of singer Joey Belladonna. Although the songs are credited to the whole band, since &quot;Spreading the Disease&quot; the music has been written almost entirely by Charlie Benante and the lyrics by Scott Ian, although John Bush made some lyrical contributions during his tenure in the band.
Anthrax has been influenced by a variety of music, including classic rock and hard rock acts as Rush, Cheap Trick, AC/DC, Kiss, Queen, Thin Lizzy, Boston and Journey, all of whom the band had covered on its EP &quot;Anthems&quot;. Their other influences include heavy metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Judas Priest, Accept, Motörhead, Exodus, UFO, Saxon, and Raven, as well as hardcore punk bands such as Bad Brains, D.R.I., Suicidal Tendencies, and GBH. Anthrax is a member of the &quot;big four&quot; of thrash metal with Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer, and often credited as one of the first bands of the genre to emerge from the East Coast, along with Overkill and Nuclear Assault. The band has been credited for laying the groundwork for rap metal and nu metal. According to Nielsen SoundScan, Anthrax sold 2.5 million records in the United States from 1991 to 2004, and 10 million worldwide.

Anthrax has influenced multiple bands such as Pantera, Sepultura, Cannibal Corpse, Testament, Slipknot, Death Angel, Korn, Limp Bizkit, 311, Papa Roach, Avenged Sevenfold, Killswitch Engage, Children of Bodom, Sevendust, Terror and Insane Clown Posse.

Anthrax has been known to reference or draw influences from numerous sources in popular culture. &quot;I Am the Law&quot; is about the comic book character Judge Dredd. The title track to the album &quot;Among the Living&quot; is based on the Stephen King novel &quot;The Stand&quot;, in particular the character of villain Randall Flagg, while &quot;A Skeleton in the Closet&quot; is based on King&#x27;s novella Apt Pupil and &quot;Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)&quot; pays tribute to actor and original &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; cast member John Belushi. The song &quot;The Constant&quot; is based on an episode of &quot;Lost&quot;.

The band, for a period of time, used a caricature of a bald man&#x27;s face as a mascot; he was colloquially christened the &quot;Not Man&quot;. The face itself comes from a rubber kids toy called &quot;Magic Monster&quot;.

<text>Pythagorean tuning is a system of musical tuning in which the frequency ratios of all intervals are determined by choosing a sequence of fifths which are &quot;pure&quot; or perfect, with ratio formula_1. This is chosen because it is the next harmonic of a vibrating string, after the octave (which is the ratio formula_2), and hence is the next most consonant &quot;pure&quot; interval, and the easiest to tune by ear. As Novalis put it, &quot;The musical proportions seem to me to be particularly correct natural proportions.&quot; Alternatively, it can be described as the tuning of the syntonic temperament in which the generator is the ratio 3:2 (i.e., the untempered perfect fifth), which is ≈ 702 cents wide.

The system dates back to Ancient Mesopotamia;. (See .) It is named, and has been widely misattributed, to Ancient Greeks, notably Pythagoras (sixth century BC) by modern authors of music theory. Ptolemy, and later Boethius, ascribed the division of the tetrachord by only two intervals, called &quot;semitonium&quot; and &quot;tonus&quot; in Latin (256:243 × 9:8 × 9:8), to Eratosthenes. The so-called &quot;Pythagorean tuning&quot; was used by musicians up to the beginning of the 16th century. &quot;The Pythagorean system would appear to be ideal because of the purity of the fifths, but some consider other intervals, particularly the major third, to be so badly out of tune that major chords [may be considered] a dissonance.&quot;

The Pythagorean scale is any scale which can be constructed from only pure perfect fifths (3:2) and octaves (2:1). In Greek music it was used to tune tetrachords, which were composed into scales spanning an octave. A distinction can be made between extended Pythagorean tuning and a 12-tone Pythagorean temperament. Extended Pythagorean tuning corresponds 1-on-1 with western music notation and there is no limit to the number of fifths. In 12-tone Pythagorean temperament however one is limited by 12-tones per octave and one cannot play most music according to the Pythagorean system corresponding to the enharmonic notation. Instead one finds that for instance the diminished sixth becomes a &quot;wolf fifth&quot;.

==Method==

12-tone Pythagorean temperament is based on a sequence of perfect fifths, each tuned in the ratio 3:2, the next simplest ratio after 2:1 (the octave). Starting from D for example (&quot;D-based&quot; tuning), six other notes are produced by moving six times a ratio 3:2 up, and the remaining ones by moving the same ratio down:

:E♭–B♭–F–C–G–D–A–E–B–F♯–C♯–G♯

This succession of eleven 3:2 intervals spans across a wide range of frequency (on a piano keyboard, it encompasses 77 keys). Since notes differing in frequency by a factor of 2 are perceived as similar and given the same name (octave equivalence), it is customary to divide or multiply the frequencies of some of these notes by 2 or by a power of 2. The purpose of this adjustment is to move the 12 notes within a smaller range of frequency, namely within the interval between the base note D and the D above it (a note with twice its frequency). This interval is typically called the basic octave (on a piano keyboard, an octave has only 12 keys). This dates to antiquity: in Ancient Mesopotamia, rather than stacking fifths, tuning was based on alternating ascending fifths and descending fourths (equal to an ascending fifth followed by a descending octave), resulting in the notes of a pentatonic or heptatonic scale falling within an octave.

In the formulas, the ratios 3:2 or 2:3 represent an ascending or descending perfect fifth (i.e. an increase or decrease in frequency by a perfect fifth, while 2:1 or 1:2 represent a rising or lowering octave). The formulas can also be expressed in terms of powers of the third and the second harmonics.

The major scale based on C, obtained from this tuning is:

In equal temperament, pairs of enharmonic notes such as A and G are thought of as being exactly the same note—however, as the above table indicates, in Pythagorean tuning they have different ratios with respect to D, which means they are at a different frequency. This discrepancy, of about 23.46 cents, or nearly one quarter of a semitone, is known as a &quot;Pythagorean comma&quot;.

To get around this problem, Pythagorean tuning constructs only twelve notes as above, with eleven fifths between them. For example, one may use only the 12 notes from E to G. This, as shown above, implies that only eleven just fifths are used to build the entire chromatic scale. The remaining interval (the diminished sixth from G to E) is left badly out-of-tune, meaning that any music which combines those two notes is unplayable in this tuning. A very out-of-tune interval such as this one is known as a &quot;wolf interval&quot;. In the case of Pythagorean tuning, all the fifths are 701.96 cents wide, in the exact ratio 3:2, except the wolf fifth, which is only 678.49 cents wide, nearly a quarter of a semitone flatter.
If the notes G and E need to be sounded together, the position of the wolf fifth can be changed. For example, a C-based Pythagorean tuning would produce a stack of fifths running from D to F, making F-D the wolf interval. However, there will always be one wolf fifth in Pythagorean tuning, making it impossible to play in all keys in tune.

== Sizes of intervals ==
The tables above only show the frequency ratios of each note with respect to the base note. However, intervals can start from any note and so twelve intervals can be defined for each interval type – twelve unisons, twelve semitones, twelve 2-semitone intervals, etc.

As explained above, one of the twelve fifths (the wolf fifth) has a different size with respect to the other eleven. For a similar reason, each interval type except unisons and octaves has two different sizes. The table on the right shows their frequency ratios, with deviations of a Pythagorean comma coloured. The deviations arise because the notes determine two different semitones:
* The minor second (m2), also called diatonic semitone, with size formula_3 (e.g. between D and E)
* The augmented unison (A1), also called chromatic semitone, with size formula_4 (e.g. between E and E)

By contrast, in an equally tempered chromatic scale, all semitones measure
:formula_5
and intervals of any given type have the same size, but none are justly tuned except unisons and octaves.

By definition, in Pythagorean tuning 11 perfect fifths (P5 in the table) have a size of approximately 701.955 cents (700+ε cents, where &quot;ε&quot; ≈ 1.955 cents). Since the average size of the 12 fifths must equal exactly 700 cents (as in equal temperament), the other one must have a size of 700 − 11&quot;ε&quot; cents, which is about 678.495 cents (the wolf fifth). As shown in the table, the latter interval, although enharmonically equivalent to a fifth, is more properly called a diminished sixth (d6). Similarly,
* 9 minor thirds (m3) are ≈ 294.135 cents (300 − 3&quot;ε&quot;), 3 augmented seconds (A2) are ≈ 317.595 cents (300 + 9&quot;ε&quot;), and their average is 300 cents;
* 8 major thirds (M3) are ≈ 407.820 cents (400 + 4&quot;ε&quot;), 4 diminished fourths (d4) are ≈ 384.360 cents (400 − 8&quot;ε&quot;), and their average is 400 cents;
* 7 diatonic semitones (m2) are ≈ 90.225 cents (100 − 5&quot;ε&quot;), 5 chromatic semitones (A1) are ≈ 113.685 cents (100 + 7&quot;ε&quot;), and their average is 100 cents.

In short, similar differences in width are observed for all interval types, except for unisons and octaves, and they are all multiples of &quot;ε&quot;, the difference between the Pythagorean fifth and the average fifth.

As an obvious consequence, each augmented or diminished interval is exactly 12&quot;ε&quot; (≈ 23.460) cents narrower or wider than its enharmonic equivalent. For instance, the d6 (or wolf fifth) is 12&quot;ε&quot; cents narrower than each P5, and each A2 is 12&quot;ε&quot; cents wider than each m3. This interval of size 12&quot;ε&quot; is known as a Pythagorean comma, exactly equal to the opposite of a diminished second (≈ −23.460 cents). This implies that &quot;ε&quot; can be also defined as one twelfth of a Pythagorean comma.

== Pythagorean intervals ==

Four of the above-mentioned intervals take a specific name in Pythagorean tuning. In the following table, these specific names are provided, together with alternative names used generically for some other intervals. The Pythagorean comma does not coincide with the diminished second, as its size (524288:531441) is the reciprocal of the Pythagorean diminished second (531441:524288). Also &quot;ditone&quot; and &quot;semiditone&quot; are specific for Pythagorean tuning, while &quot;tone&quot; and &quot;tritone&quot; are used generically for all tuning systems. Despite its name, a semiditone (3 semitones, or about 300 cents) can hardly be viewed as half of a ditone (4 semitones, or about 400 cents). All the intervals with prefix &quot;sesqui-&quot; are justly tuned, and their frequency ratio, shown in the table, is a superparticular number (or epimoric ratio). The same is true for the octave.

==History and usage==
The system dates to Ancient Mesopotamia, and consisted of alternating ascending fifths and descending fourths; see . Within Ancient Greek music, the system had been mainly attributed to Pythagoras (who lived around 500 BCE) by modern authors of music theory; Ancient Greeks borrowed much of their music theory from Mesopotamia, including the diatonic scale, Pythagorean tuning, and modes. The Chinese Shí-èr-lǜ scale uses the same intervals as the Pythagorean scale and was invented between 600 BCE and 240 CE.

Because of the wolf interval when using a 12-tone Pythagorean temperament, this tuning is rarely used today, although it is thought to have been widespread. In music which does not change key very often, or which is not very harmonically adventurous, the wolf interval is unlikely to be a problem, as not all the possible fifths will be heard in such pieces. In extended Pythagorean tuning there is no wolf interval, all perfect fifths are exactly 3:2.

Because most fifths in 12-tone Pythagorean temperament are in the simple ratio of 3:2, they sound very &quot;smooth&quot; and consonant. The thirds, by contrast, most of which are in the relatively complex ratios of 81:64 (for major thirds) and 32:27 (for minor thirds), sound less smooth depending on the instrument.

From about 1510 onward, as thirds came to be treated as consonances, meantone temperament, and particularly quarter-comma meantone, which tunes thirds to the relatively simple ratio of 5:4, became the most popular system for tuning keyboards. At the same time, syntonic-diatonic just intonation was posited first by Ramos and then by Zarlino as the normal tuning for singers.

However, meantone presented its own harmonic challenges. Its wolf intervals proved to be even worse than those of the Pythagorean tuning (so much so that it often required 19 keys to the octave as opposed to the 12 in Pythagorean tuning). As a consequence, meantone was not suitable for all music. From around the 18th century, as the desire grew for instruments to change key, and therefore to avoid a wolf interval, this led to the widespread use of well temperaments and eventually equal temperament.

Pythagorean temperament can still be heard in some parts of modern classical music from singers and from instruments with no fixed tuning such as the violin family. Where a performer has an unaccompanied passage based on scales, they will tend towards using Pythagorean intonation as that will make the scale sound best in tune, then reverting to other temperaments for other passages (just intonation for chordal or arpeggiated figures, and equal temperament when accompanied with piano or orchestra). Such changes are never explicitly notated and are scarcely noticeable to the audience, just sounding &#x27;in tune&#x27;.
