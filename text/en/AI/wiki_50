<text>Greater Poland Voivodeship ( ) is a voivodeship, or province, in west-central Poland. The province is named after the region called Greater Poland or &quot;Wielkopolska&quot; . The modern province includes most of this historic region, except for some western and northern parts.

Greater Poland Voivodeship is second in area and third in population among Poland&#x27;s sixteen voivodeships, with an area of and a population of close to 3.5 million. Its capital city is Poznań; other important cities include Kalisz, Konin, Piła, Ostrów Wielkopolski, Gniezno (an early capital of Poland) and Leszno. It is bordered by seven other voivodeships: West Pomeranian to the northwest, Pomeranian to the north, Kuyavian-Pomeranian to the north-east, Łódź to the south-east, Opole to the south, Lower Silesian to the southwest and Lubusz to the west.

==History==
Greater Poland, sometimes called the &quot;cradle of Poland,&quot; formed the heart of the 10th-century early Polish state. Poznań and Gniezno were early centers of royal power, but following the region&#x27;s devastation by pagan rebellion in the 1030s, and an invasion by Bretislaus I of Bohemia in 1038, the capital was moved by Casimir the Restorer from Gniezno to Kraków. The two cities are seats of Poland&#x27;s oldest diocese (Poznań, est. in 968) and archdiocese (Gniezno, est. in 1000), playing a crucial role in the Christianization of Poland.
In the testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth, which initiated the period of fragmentation of Poland (1138–1320), the western part of Greater Poland (including Poznań) was granted to Mieszko III the Old. The eastern part, with Gniezno and Kalisz, was part of the Duchy of Kraków, granted to Władysław II the Exile. However, for most of the period the two parts were under a single ruler, and were known as the Duchy of Greater Poland (although at times there were separately ruled duchies of Poznań, Gniezno, Kalisz and Ujście). It was one of the leading and fastest developing regions of Poland, with municipal rights modeled after Poznań and Kalisz becoming the basis of municipal form of government for several towns in the region, as two of five local Polish variants of medieval town rights. The region came under the control of Władysław I the Elbow-High in 1314, and thus became part of the reunited Poland of which Władysław was crowned king in 1320.

In the reunited kingdom, and later in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, the country came to be divided into administrative units called voivodeships. In the case of the Greater Poland region these were Poznań Voivodeship and Kalisz Voivodeship. The Commonwealth also had larger subdivisions known as &quot;prowincja&quot;, one of which was named Greater Poland. However, this &quot;prowincja&quot; covered a larger area than the Greater Poland region itself, also taking in Kuyavia, Masovia and Royal Prussia. (This division of Crown Poland into two entities called Greater and Lesser Poland had its roots in the Statutes of Casimir the Great of 1346–1362, where the laws of &quot;Greater Poland&quot; – the northern part of the country – were codified in the Piotrków statute, with those of &quot;Lesser Poland&quot; in the separate Wiślica statute.)

In 1768, a new Gniezno Voivodeship was formed out of the northern part of Kalisz Voivodeship. However more far-reaching changes would come with the Partitions of Poland. In the first partition (1772), northern parts of Greater Poland along the Noteć (German &quot;Netze&quot;) were taken over by Prussia, becoming the Netze District. In the second partition (1793) the whole of Greater Poland was absorbed by Prussia, becoming part of the province of South Prussia. It remained so in spite of the first Greater Poland Uprising (1794), part of the unsuccessful Kościuszko Uprising directed chiefly against the Russian Empire.

More successful was the Greater Poland Uprising of 1806, which led to the region&#x27;s becoming part of the Napoleonic Duchy of Warsaw (forming the Poznań Department and parts of the Kalisz and Bydgoszcz Departments). However, following the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Greater Poland was again partitioned, with the western part (including Poznań) going to Prussia. The eastern part joined the Russian-controlled Kingdom of Poland, where it formed the Kalisz Voivodeship until 1837, then the Kalisz Governorate (merged into the Warsaw Governorate between 1844 and 1867).

Within the Prussian empire, western Greater Poland became the Grand Duchy of Posen (Poznań), which theoretically held some autonomy. Following an unrealized uprising in 1846, and the more substantial but still unsuccessful uprising of 1848 (during the Spring of Nations), the Grand Duchy was replaced by the Province of Posen. The authorities made efforts to Germanize the region, particularly after the founding of Germany in 1871, and from 1886 onwards the Prussian Settlement Commission was active in increasing German land ownership in formerly Polish areas.
Following the end of World War I, the Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919) ensured that most of the region became part of the newly independent Polish state, forming most of Poznań Voivodeship (1921–1939). Northern and some western parts of Greater Poland remained in Germany, where they formed much of the province of Posen-West Prussia (1922–1938), whose capital was Schneidemühl (Piła).

Following the German invasion of 1939, Greater Poland was incorporated into Nazi Germany, becoming the province called Reichsgau Posen, later Reichsgau Wartheland (&quot;Warthe&quot; being the German name for the Warta river). The Polish population was oppressed, with many former officials and others considered potential enemies by the Nazis being imprisoned or executed, including at the notorious Fort VII concentration camp in Poznań. The Polish population was also subjected to expulsions, kidnapping of children and forced labour. Germany also operated the Stalag XXI-A, Stalag XXI-C, Stalag XXI-D and other prisoner-of-war camps for Polish, French, British, Moroccan, Algerian, Dutch, Belgian, Serbian, Italian, American, Norwegian, and Soviet POWs. Poznań was declared a stronghold city &quot;(Festung)&quot; in the closing stages of the war, being taken by the Red Army in the Battle of Poznań, which ended on 22 February 1945.

After the war, Greater Poland was fully within the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, as Poznań Voivodeship. With the reforms of 1975 this was divided into smaller provinces (the voivodeships of Kalisz, Konin, Leszno and Piła, and a smaller Poznań Voivodeship). The present-day Greater Poland Voivodeship, again with Poznań as its capital, was created on 1 January 1999 out of the former Poznań, Kalisz, Konin, Piła and Leszno Voivodeships, pursuant to the Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998.

== Cities and towns ==


The voivodeship contains 7 cities and 106 towns. These are listed below in descending order of population (according to official figures for 2019):
==Geography==
===Topography===

The relief of Greater Poland, geological conditions and soil have been shaped by two glaciations:
* The Baltic glaciation in the lowlands of northern and central Europe where there are now numerous lakes of the Pomeranian Lake District, a feature especially common in and around Poznań and Gniezno.
* The Mid-glaciation in the southern part of the province, where there is less terrain diversity and a lack of major lakes.

The highest elevation is Greater Kobyla Mountain () in the Ostrzeszowski Hills, the lowest area is located in the valley of the Warta River at the mouth of its tributary the Noteć () in the north-western part of the region. Agriculturally fertile soils account for around 60% of the province&#x27;s area, while 20%, the rest of the non-forested or urban areas, is mostly wetland soil (muck-peat and alluvial soils).

An area of approximately is covered by forests, this represents around 25.8% of the total surface area of the region.
In the lake districts of the northern and central parts of the province there are about 800 lakes; 58% of which cover an area of at least and 8%, with an area exceeding . The largest reservoir is the natural Greater Powidzkie Lake () in the Gniezno Lake District.

Wielkopolska Region lies within the basin of the Oder River, 88% of the province&#x27;s surface water drains into the Warta river basin, and the remaining 12% is drained by a multitude of other river systems, including the Barycz, Ladislaus Trench and Obrzycy waterways. The quality of river waters is generally poor, but their condition is gradually improving and should soon be classed as &#x27;clean&#x27;.

===Geology===

The main mineral energy resources in Greater Poland are lignite, natural gas, oil and peat.

Brown coal deposits are currently mined in the Konin area, and form the basis for the province&#x27;s power industry (the Pątnów-Adams-Konin coal-fired power stations account for more than 10% of the national electricity production). The region also has significant quantities of peat deposits; it is calculated that there are ca. of land covered with an average thickness of of peat. An abundance of raw materials used in the production of numerous medicines was recently discovered in the muds of Błażejewo, Oderbank and Mechnacz. In addition, very large deposits of brown coal have been discovered in the vicinity of Kościan, these however are not currently being extracted and probably never will be extracted, due to the expense that would be incurred in adapting the site to build a coal mine and the need to resettle thousands of people.

Rock salt is mined intensively at a salt mine in Kłodawa (this mine alone accounts for about 20% of domestic production).

Throughout the province there are significant deposits of aggregates, gypsum, ceramic materials, and lacustrine chalk. In Kościan the largest and most modern, a natural gas production site is in operation. It supplies raw material for Kościańska Zieme, and Zielona Gora CHP. It is estimated that at the rate local gas reserves are being exploited, the reserves in Kościan will be enough for about 20 years of operation, thus practically allowing for local independence against the effects of gas crises.

===Climate===
Wielkopolska is influenced by oceanic air masses that affect the mildness of the climate. The farther east one travels the more distinctly continental the climate becomes. The area is situated in the Silesian Greater Poland agro-climatic region where the average annual temperature is about 8.2 °C, and in the north drops to around 7.6 °C. It is slightly warmer in the south and west where the average temperature is usually about 8.5 °C. The number of days with snow can reach up to 57 days in and around the Kalisz district.

The growing season is one of the longest in Poland. On the province&#x27;s southern plains this season constitutes around 228 days, while north of Gniezno and Szamotuły this gradually declines to 216 days.

Precipitation ranges from 500 to 550 mm. Despite this the region is still faced with a deficit in rainfall, particularly in the eastern part of the province (around Słupcy, Kazimierz Biskupi, Kleczew) where sometimes experience only 450 mm of rainfall per year, this threatens steppization of the region. Throughout the province there is typically a prevailing westerly wind.

==Transportation==

Greater Poland is a major transport hub within Poland; a great deal of traffic from Russia and other states of the former Soviet Union passes through Poznań and Konin to reach Germany and other EU member states. To the south runs the international route from Gdańsk via Poznań and Leszno to Prague and then to the south of Europe. There is also a major highway in the province, the A2 motorway, which when completed will run from the western border of Poland with Germany, through Poznań to Warsaw and then via Belarus to Moscow.

The main railway hubs located in Greater Poland are Poznań, Piła and Ostrów Wielkopolski. PKP Intercity operate a number of trains a day between Warsaw and Berlin which provide a fast connection for the two cities also to Poznań. This route was the first in Poland, adapted for use by the European high-speed transportation system. The Poznań Główny railway station is the second busiest railway station in Poland.
In the near future the government expects to construct a high-speed rail line in the shape of a Y connecting Kalisz and Poznań from Łódź, Warsaw and Wrocław.

Poznań is the port of arrival for most international travellers as it plays host to Ławica International Airport, which has recently seen the second-highest passenger growth rate in the country.

== Economy ==
The Gross domestic product (GDP) of the province was 40.4 billion € in 2018, accounting for 8.1% of Polish economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 19,700 € or 65% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 72% of the EU average.

==Politics==

The Greater Poland voivodeship&#x27;s government is headed by the province&#x27;s voivode &quot;(governor)&quot; who is appointed by the Polish Prime Minister. The voivode is then assisted in performing his duties by the voivodeship&#x27;s marshal, who is the appointed speaker for the voivodeship&#x27;s executive and is elected by the sejmik &quot;(provincial assembly)&quot;. The current voivode of Greater Poland is Łukasz Mikołajczyk, whilst the present marshal is Marek Woźniak.

The Sejmik of Greater Poland consists of 39 members.

<doc id="41507" wikidata="Q2084933" url="?curid=41507" title="Phantom circuit">
<text>In telecommunications and electrical engineering, a phantom circuit is an electrical circuit derived from suitably arranged wires with one or more conductive paths being a circuit in itself and at the same time acting as one conductor of another circuit.

==Phantom group==
A phantom group is composed of three circuits that are derived from two single-channel circuits to form a &quot;phantom circuit&quot;. Here the phantom circuit is a third circuit derived from two suitably arranged pairs of wires, called side circuits, with each pair of wires being a circuit in itself and at the same time acting as one conductor of the third circuit. The &quot;side circuits&quot; within phantom circuits can be coupled to their respective voltage drops by center-tapped transformers, usually called &quot;repeating coils&quot;. The center taps are on the line side of the side circuits. Current from the phantom circuit is split evenly by the center taps. This cancels crosstalk from the phantom circuit to the side circuits. 
Phantom working increased the number of circuits on long-distance routes in the early 20th century without putting up more wires. Phantoming declined with the adoption of carrier systems.

It is theoretically possible to create a phantom circuit from two other phantom circuits and so on up in a pyramid with a maximum 2n-1 circuits being derived from n original circuits. However, more than one level of phantoming is usually impractical. Isolation between the phantom circuit and the side circuits relies on accurate balance of the line and transformers. Imperfect balance results in crosstalk between the phantom and side circuits and this effect accumulates as each level of phantoms is added. Even small levels of crosstalk are unacceptable on analogue telecommunications circuits since speech crosstalk is still intelligible down to quite low levels.
==Phantom microphone powering==
Condenser microphones have impedance converter (current amplifier) circuitry that requires powering; in addition, the capsule of any non-electret, non-RF condenser microphone requires a polarizing voltage to be applied. Since the mid- to late 1960s most balanced, professional condenser microphones for recording and broadcast have used phantom powering. It can be provided by outboard AC or battery supplies, but nowadays is most often built into the mixing console, recorder or microphone preamplifier to which the microphones are connected.

By far the most common circuit uses +48 V DC fed through a matched pair of 6.8 kΩ resistors for each input channel. This arrangement has been standardized by the IEC and ISO, along with a less-commonly-used arrangement with +12 V DC and 680 Ω feed resistors.

As a practical matter, phantom powering allows the same two-conductor shielded cables to be used for both dynamic microphones and condenser microphones, while being harmless to balanced microphones that aren&#x27;t designed to consume it, since the circuit balance prevents any substantial DC from flowing through the output circuit of those microphones.

==DC phantom==

Simple DC signalling can be achieved on a telecommunications line in a similar way to phantom powering of microphones. A switch connected to the transformer centre-tap at one end of the line can operate a similarly connected relay at the other end. The return path is through the ground connection. This arrangement can be used for remotely controlling equipment.

==Carrier circuit phantoms==
From the 1950s to around the 1980s, using phantoms on star-quad trunk carrier circuits was a popular method of deriving a high quality broadcast audio circuit. The multiplexed FDM telecommunications carrier system usually did not use the baseband of the cable because it was inconvenient to separate low frequencies with filters. On the other hand, a one-way audio phantom could be formed from the two pairs (go and return signals) making up the star-quad cable.

==Unloaded phantom==
Unloaded phantom is a phantom configuration of loaded lines (a circuit fitted with loading coils). The idea here is not to create additional circuits. Rather, the purpose is to cancel or greatly reduce the effect of the loading coils fitted to a line. The reason for doing this is that loaded lines have a definite cut-off frequency and it may be desired to equalise the line to a frequency which is higher than this, for example to make a circuit suitable for use by a broadcaster. Ideally, the loading would be removed or reduced for a permanent connection, but this is not feasible for temporary arrangements such as a requirement for outside broadcast. Instead, two circuits in a phantom configuration can be used to greatly reduce the inductance being inserted by the loading coils, and hence the loading effect.
It works because the loading coils used on balanced lines have two windings, one for each leg of the circuit. They are both wound on a common core and the windings are so arranged that the magnetic flux induced by both of them is in the same direction. Both windings induce an emf in each other as well as their own self-induction. This effect greatly increases the inductance of the coil and hence its loading effectiveness. By contrast, when the circuit is in the phantom configuration the currents in the two wires of each pair are in the same direction and the magnetic flux is being cancelled. This has precisely the opposite effect and the inductance is greatly reduced.

This configuration is most commonly used on the two pairs of a star-quad cable. It is not so successful with other pairs of wires. The difference in the path of the two pairs can easily destroy the balance and results in crosstalk and interference.

This configuration can also be called &quot;bunched pairs&quot;. However, &quot;bunched pairs&quot; can also refer to the straightforward connection of two lines in parallel which is not a phantom circuit and will not reduce the loading.

<doc id="41509" wikidata="Q727898" url="?curid=41509" title="Phased array">
<text>In antenna theory, a phased array consists of many small antennas, positioned in an array, next to each other. 

Instead of sending a radio wave with one antenna, a computer system can shift the phase of the original wave by fractions of a wavelength for each individual antenna in the array. The frequency of the signal is not changed, only the phase by precisely delaying the signal for each antenna in the array, resulting in a shift of the wave crest and trough for each antenna.

This allows the radio wave being sent out to be concentrated in a specific direction by creating a constructive interference pattern from the shifted phases of each individual wave. The resulting signal just looks like any other radio wave, being the strongest in the desired direction, where the phase of all individual waves align and constructively interfere.

Phased arrays are mainly used at the high frequency end of the radio spectrum. Smaller wavelengths can be sent with smaller antennas, allowing the total size of the array to be practical.

==Description==

A phased array is an electronically scanned array, a computer-controlled array of antennas which creates a beam of radio waves that can be electronically steered to point in different directions without moving the antennas.
The general theory of an electromagnetic phased array also finds applications in ultrasonic and medical imaging application (&quot;phased array ultrasonics&quot;) and in optics &quot;optical phased array&quot;.

In a simple array antenna, the radio frequency current from the transmitter is fed to multiple individual antenna elements with the proper phase relationship so that the radio waves from the separate elements combine (superpose) to form beams, to increase power radiated in desired directions and suppress radiation in undesired directions. 

In a phased array, the power from the transmitter is fed to the radiating elements through devices called &quot;phase shifters&quot;, controlled by a computer system, which can alter the phase or signal delay electronically, thus steering the beam of radio waves to a different direction. Since the size of an antenna array must extend many wavelengths to achieve the high gain needed for narrow beam-width, phased arrays are mainly practical at the high frequency end of the radio spectrum, in the UHF and microwave bands, in which the operating wavelengths are conveniently small.

Phased arrays were originally conceived for use in military radar systems, to steer a beam of radio waves quickly across the sky to detect planes and missiles. These systems are now widely used and have spread to civilian applications such as 5G MIMO for cell phones. The phased array principle is also used in acoustics, and phased arrays of acoustic transducers are used in medical ultrasound imaging scanners (phased array ultrasonics), oil and gas prospecting (reflection seismology), and military sonar systems.

The term &quot;phased array&quot; is also used to a lesser extent for non steerable array antennas in which the phase of the feed power and thus the radiation pattern of the antenna array is fixed. For example, AM broadcast radio antennas consisting of multiple mast radiators fed so as to create a specific radiation pattern are also called &quot;phased arrays&quot;.

== Types ==
Phased arrays take multiple forms. However, the four most common are the passive electronically scanned array (PESA), active electronically scanned array (AESA), hybrid beam forming phased array, and digital beam forming (DBF) array.

A &quot;passive phased array&quot; or &quot;passive electronically scanned array&quot; (PESA) is a phased array in which the antenna elements are connected to a single transmitter and/or receiver, as shown in the first animation at top. PESAs are the most common type of phased array. Generally speaking, a PESA uses one receiver/exciter for the entire array.

An &quot;active phased array&quot; or &quot;active electronically scanned array&quot; (AESA) is a phased array in which each antenna element has an analog transmitter/receiver (T/R) module which creates the phase shifting required to electronically steer the antenna beam. Active arrays are a more advanced, second-generation phased-array technology that are used in military applications; unlike PESAs they can radiate several beams of radio waves at multiple frequencies in different directions simultaneously. However, the number of simultaneous beams is limited by practical reasons of electronic packaging of the beam formers to approximately three simultaneous beams for an AESA. Each beam former has a receiver/exciter connected to it.

A &quot;digital beam forming (DBF) phased array&quot; has a digital receiver/exciter at each element in the array. The signal at each element is digitized by the receiver/exciter. This means that antenna beams can be formed digitally in a field programmable gate array (FPGA) or the array computer. This approach allows for multiple simultaneous antenna beams to be formed.

A &quot;hybrid beam forming phased array&quot; can be thought of as a combination of an AESA and a digital beam forming phased array. It uses subarrays that are active phased arrays (for instance, a subarray may be 64, 128 or 256 elements and the number of elements depends upon system requirements). The subarrays are combined to form the full array. Each subarray has its own digital receiver/exciter. This approach allows clusters of simultaneous beams to be created.

A &quot;conformal antenna&quot; is a phased array in which the individual antennas, instead of being arranged in a flat plane, are mounted on a curved surface. The phase shifters compensate for the different path lengths of the waves due to the antenna elements&#x27; varying position on the surface, allowing the array to radiate a plane wave. Conformal antennas are used in aircraft and missiles, to integrate the antenna into the curving surface of the aircraft to reduce aerodynamic drag.
== History ==

Phased array transmission was originally shown in 1905 by Nobel laureate Karl Ferdinand Braun who demonstrated enhanced transmission of radio waves in one direction. During World War II, Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez used phased array transmission in a rapidly steerable radar system for &quot;ground-controlled approach&quot;, a system to aid in the landing of aircraft. At the same time, the GEMA in Germany built the Mammut 1. It was later adapted for radio astronomy leading to Nobel Prizes for Physics for Antony Hewish and Martin Ryle after several large phased arrays were developed at the University of Cambridge Interplanetary Scintillation Array. This design is also used for radar, and is generalized in interferometric radio antennas.

In 1966, most phased-array radars use ferrite phase shifters or traveling-wave tubes to dynamically adjust the phase.
The AN/SPS-33 -- installed on the nuclear-powered ships Long Beach and Enterprise around 1961 -- was claimed to be the only operational 3-D phased array in the world in 1966.
The AN/SPG-59 was designed to generate multiple tracking beams from the transmitting array and simultaneously program independent receiving arrays.
The first civilian 3D phased array was built in 1960 at the National Aviation Facilities Experimental Center; but was abandoned in 1961.

In 2004, Caltech researchers demonstrated the first integrated silicon-based phased array receiver at 24 GHz with 8 elements. This was followed by their demonstration of a CMOS 24 GHz phased array transmitter in 2005 and a fully integrated 77 GHz phased array transceiver with integrated antennas in 2006 by the Caltech team. In 2007, DARPA researchers announced a 16-element phased-array radar antenna which was also integrated with all the necessary circuits on a single silicon chip and operated at 30–50 GHz.

The relative amplitudes of—and constructive and destructive interference effects among—the signals radiated by the individual antennas determine the effective radiation pattern of the array. A phased array may be used to point a fixed radiation pattern, or to rapidly in azimuth or elevation. Simultaneous electrical scanning in both azimuth and elevation was first demonstrated in a phased array antenna at Hughes Aircraft Company, California in 1957.

== Applications ==

=== Broadcasting ===
In broadcast engineering, the term &#x27;phased array&#x27; has a meaning different from its normal meaning, it means an ordinary array antenna, an array of multiple mast radiators designed to radiate a directional radiation pattern, as opposed to a single mast which radiates an omnidirectional pattern. Broadcast phased arrays have fixed radiation patterns and are not &#x27;steered&#x27; during operation as are other phased arrays.

Phased arrays are used by many AM broadcast radio stations to enhance signal strength and therefore coverage in the city of license, while minimizing interference to other areas. Due to the differences between daytime and nighttime ionospheric propagation at mediumwave frequencies, it is common for AM broadcast stations to change between day (groundwave) and night (skywave) radiation patterns by switching the phase and power levels supplied to the individual antenna elements (mast radiators) daily at sunrise and sunset. For shortwave broadcasts many stations use arrays of horizontal dipoles. A common arrangement uses 16 dipoles in a 4×4 array. Usually this is in front of a wire grid reflector. The phasing is often switchable to allow beam steering in azimuth and sometimes elevation.

=== Radar ===
Phased arrays were invented for radar tracking of ballistic missiles, and because of their fast tracking abilities phased array radars are widely used in military applications. For example, because of the rapidity with which the beam can be steered, phased array radars allow a warship to use one radar system for surface detection and tracking (finding ships), air detection and tracking (finding aircraft and missiles) and missile uplink capabilities. Before using these systems, each surface-to-air missile in flight required a dedicated fire-control radar, which meant that radar-guided weapons could only engage a small number of simultaneous targets. Phased array systems can be used to control missiles during the mid-course phase of the missile&#x27;s flight. During the terminal portion of the flight, continuous-wave fire control directors provide the final guidance to the target. Because the antenna pattern is electronically steered, phased array systems can direct radar beams fast enough to maintain a fire control quality track on many targets simultaneously while also controlling several in-flight missiles.
The AN/SPY-1 phased array radar, part of the Aegis Combat System deployed on modern U.S. cruisers and destroyers, &quot;is able to perform search, track and missile guidance functions simultaneously with a capability of over 100 targets.&quot; Likewise, the Thales Herakles phased array multi-function radar used in service with France and Singapore has a track capacity of 200 targets and is able to achieve automatic target detection, confirmation and track initiation in a single scan, while simultaneously providing mid-course guidance updates to the MBDA Aster missiles launched from the ship. The German Navy and the Royal Dutch Navy have developed the Active Phased Array Radar System (APAR). The MIM-104 Patriot and other ground-based antiaircraft systems use phased array radar for similar benefits.

Phased arrays are used in naval sonar, in active (transmit and receive) and passive (receive only) and hull-mounted and towed array sonar.

=== Space probe communication ===
The &quot;MESSENGER&quot; spacecraft was a space probe mission to the planet Mercury (2011–2015). This was the first deep-space mission to use a phased-array antenna for communications. The radiating elements are circularly-polarized, slotted waveguides. The antenna, which uses the X band, used 26 radiative elements and can gracefully degrade.

=== Weather research usage ===

The National Severe Storms Laboratory has been using a SPY-1A phased array antenna, provided by the US Navy, for weather research at its Norman, Oklahoma facility since April 23, 2003. It is hoped that research will lead to a better understanding of thunderstorms and tornadoes, eventually leading to increased warning times and enhanced prediction of tornadoes. Current project participants include the National Severe Storms Laboratory and National Weather Service Radar Operations Center, Lockheed Martin, United States Navy, University of Oklahoma School of Meteorology, School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, and Atmospheric Radar Research Center, Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education, the Federal Aviation Administration, and Basic Commerce and Industries. The project includes research and development, future technology transfer and potential deployment of the system throughout the United States. It is expected to take 10 to 15 years to complete and initial construction was approximately $25 million. A team from Japan&#x27;s RIKEN Advanced Institute for Computational Science (AICS) has begun experimental work on using phased-array radar with a new algorithm for instant weather forecasts.

=== Optics ===

Within the visible or infrared spectrum of electromagnetic waves it is possible to construct optical phased arrays. They are used in wavelength multiplexers and filters for telecommunication purposes, laser beam steering, and holography. Synthetic array heterodyne detection is an efficient method for multiplexing an entire phased array onto a single element photodetector. The dynamic beam forming in an optical phased array transmitter can be used to electronically raster or vector scan images without using lenses or mechanically moving parts in a lensless projector. Optical phased array receivers have been demonstrated to be able to act as lensless cameras by selectively looking at different directions.

=== Satellite broadband internet transceivers ===
Starlink is a low Earth orbit satellite constellation that is under construction . It is designed to provide broadband internet connectivity to consumers; the user terminals of the system will use phased array antennas.

=== Radio-frequency identification (RFID) ===
By 2014, phased array antennas were integrated into RFID systems to increase the area of coverage of a single system by 100% to while still using traditional passive UHF tags.

=== Human-machine interfaces (HMI) ===
A phased array of acoustic transducers, denominated airborne ultrasound tactile display (AUTD), was developed in 2008 at the University of Tokyo&#x27;s Shinoda Lab to induce tactile feedback. This system was demonstrated to enable a user to interactively manipulate virtual holographic objects.

=== Radio astronomy ===
Phased Array Feeds (PAF) have recently been used at the focus of radio telescopes to provide many beams, giving the radio telescope a very wide field of view. Three examples are the ASKAP telescope in Australia, the Apertif upgrade to the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope in The Netherlands, and the Florida Space Institute in the United States .

==Critical theory and arithmetic==
=== Array factor ===
The total directivity of a phased array will be a result of the gain of the individual array elements, and the directivity due their positioning in an array. This latter component is closely tied (but not equal to) to the array factor. In a (rectangular) planar phased array, of dimensions formula_1, with inter-element spacing formula_2 and formula_3, respectively, the array factor can be calculated accordingly:formula_4

Here, formula_5 and formula_6 are the directions which we are taking the array factor in, in the coordinate frame depicted to the right. The factors formula_7 and formula_8 are the &quot;progressive phase shift&quot; that is used to steer the beam electronically. The factors formula_9 and formula_10 are the excitation coefficients of the individual elements.

Beam steering is indicated in the same coordinate frame, however the direction of steering is indicated with formula_11 and formula_12, which is used in calculation of progressive phase:

formula_13

formula_14

In all above equations, the value formula_15 describes the wavenumber of the frequency used in transmission.

These equations can be solved to predict the nulls, main lobe, and grating lobes of the array. Referring to the exponents in the array factor equation, we can say that major and grating lobes will occur at integer formula_16 solutions to the following equations:

formula_17

formula_18

=== Worked example ===
It is common in engineering to provide phased array formula_19 values in decibels through formula_20. Recalling the complex exponential in the array factor equation above, often, what is &quot;really&quot; meant by array factor is the magnitude of the summed phasor produced at the end of array factor calculation. With this, we can produce the following equation:formula_21For the ease of visualization, we will analyze array factor given an input &quot;azimuth and elevation&quot;, which we will map to the array frame formula_5 and formula_6 through the following conversion:

formula_24

formula_25

This represents a coordinate frame whose formula_26 axis is aligned with the array formula_27 axis, and whose formula_28 axis is aligned with the array formula_26 axis.

If we consider a formula_30 phased array, this process provides the following values for formula_31, when steering to bore-sight (formula_32,formula_33):

These values have been clipped to have a minimum formula_19 of -50 dB, however, in reality, null points in the array factor pattern will have values significantly smaller than this.

== Different types of phased arrays ==
There are two main types of beamformers. These are time domain beamformers and frequency domain beamformers. From a theoretical point of view, both are in principle the same operation, with just a Fourier transform allowing conversion from one to the other type.

A graduated attenuation window is sometimes applied across the face of the array to improve side-lobe suppression performance, in addition to the phase shift.

Time domain beamformer works by introducing time delays. The basic operation is called &quot;delay and sum&quot;. It delays the incoming signal from each array element by a certain amount of time, and then adds them together. A Butler matrix allows several beams to be formed simultaneously, or one beam to be scanned through an arc. The most common kind of time domain beam former is serpentine waveguide. Active phased array designs use individual delay lines that are switched on and off. Yttrium iron garnet phase shifters vary the phase delay using the strength of a magnetic field.

There are two different types of frequency domain beamformers.

The first type separates the different frequency components that are present in the received signal into multiple frequency bins (using either a Discrete Fourier transform (DFT) or a filterbank). When different delay and sum beamformers are applied to each frequency bin, the result is that the main lobe simultaneously points in multiple different directions at each of the different frequencies. This can be an advantage for communication links, and is used with the SPS-48 radar.

The other type of frequency domain beamformer makes use of Spatial Frequency. Discrete samples are taken from each of the individual array elements. The samples are processed using a DFT. The DFT introduces multiple different discrete phase shifts during processing. The outputs of the DFT are individual channels that correspond with evenly spaced beams formed simultaneously. A 1-dimensional DFT produces a fan of different beams. A 2-dimensional DFT produces beams with a pineapple configuration.

These techniques are used to create two kinds of phased array.
:* Dynamic an array of variable phase shifters are used to move the beam
:* Fixed the beam position is stationary with respect to the array face and the whole antenna is moved

There are two further sub-categories that modify the kind of dynamic array or fixed array.
:* Active amplifiers or processors are in each phase shifter element
:* Passive large central amplifier with attenuating phase shifters

=== Dynamic phased array ===
Each array element incorporates an adjustable phase shifter. These are collectively used to move the beam with respect to the array face.

Dynamic phased arrays require no physical movement to aim the beam. The beam is moved electronically. This can produce antenna motion fast enough to use a small pencil beam to simultaneously track multiple targets while searching for new targets using just one radar set, a capability known as &quot;track while search&quot;.

As an example, an antenna with a 2-degree beam with a pulse rate of 1 kHz will require approximately 8 seconds to cover an entire hemisphere consisting of 8,000 pointing positions. This configuration provides 12 opportunities to detect a vehicle over a range of , which is suitable for military applications.

The position of mechanically steered antennas can be predicted, which can be used to create electronic countermeasures that interfere with radar operation. The flexibility resulting from phased array operation allows beams to be aimed at random locations, which eliminates this vulnerability. This is also desirable for military applications.

=== Fixed phased array ===

Fixed phased array antennas are typically used to create an antenna with a more desirable form factor than the conventional parabolic reflector or cassegrain reflector. Fixed phased arrays incorporate fixed phase shifters. For example, most commercial FM Radio and TV antenna towers use a collinear antenna array, which is a fixed phased array of dipole elements.

In radar applications, this kind of phased array is physically moved during the track and scan process. There are two configurations.
:* Multiple frequencies with a delay-line
:* Multiple adjacent beams

The SPS-48 radar uses multiple transmit frequencies with a serpentine delay line along the left side of the array to produce vertical fan of stacked beams. Each frequency experiences a different phase shift as it propagates down the serpentine delay line, which forms different beams. A filter bank is used to split apart the individual receive beams. The antenna is mechanically rotated.

Semi-active radar homing uses monopulse radar that relies on a fixed phased array to produce multiple adjacent beams that measure angle errors. This form factor is suitable for gimbal mounting in missile seekers.

=== Active phased array ===
Active electronically-scanned arrays (AESA) elements incorporate transmit amplification with phase shift in each antenna element (or group of elements). Each element also includes receive pre-amplification. The phase shifter setting is the same for transmit and receive.

Active phased arrays do not require phase reset after the end of the transmit pulse, which is compatible with Doppler radar and pulse-Doppler radar.

=== Passive phased array ===
Passive phased arrays typically use large amplifiers that produce all of the microwave transmit signal for the antenna. Phase shifters typically consist of waveguide elements controlled by magnetic field, voltage gradient, or equivalent technology.

The phase shift process used with passive phased arrays typically puts the receive beam and transmit beam into diagonally opposite quadrants. The sign of the phase shift must be inverted after the transmit pulse is finished and before the receive period begins to place the receive beam into the same location as the transmit beam. That requires a phase impulse that degrades sub-clutter visibility performance on Doppler radar and Pulse-Doppler radar. As an example, Yttrium iron garnet phase shifters must be changed after transmit pulse quench and before receiver processing starts to align transmit and receive beams. That impulse introduces FM noise that degrades clutter performance.

Passive phased array design is used in the AEGIS Combat System for direction-of-arrival estimation.

<text>In signal processing, phase distortion or phase-frequency distortion is distortion, that is, change in the shape of the waveform, that occurs when (a) a filter&#x27;s phase response is not linear over the frequency range of interest, that is, the phase shift introduced by a circuit or device is not directly proportional to frequency, or (b) the zero-frequency intercept of the phase-frequency characteristic is not 0 or an integral multiple of 2π radians.

==Audibility of phase distortion==
Grossly changed phase relationships, without changing amplitudes, can be audible but the degree of audibility of the type of phase shifts expected from typical sound systems remains debated.

<doc id="41512" wikidata="Q150093" url="?curid=41512" title="Voivodeships of Poland">
<text>A voivodeship ( ; ; plural: ) is the highest-level administrative division of Poland, corresponding to a province in many other countries. The term has been in use since the 14th century and is commonly translated into English as &quot;province&quot;.

The Polish local government reforms adopted in 1998, which went into effect on 1 January 1999, reduced the number of voivodeships to sixteen. These 16 replaced the 49 former voivodeships that had existed from 1 July 1975, and bear a greater resemblance (in territory, but not in name) to the voivodeships that existed between 1950 and 1975.

Today&#x27;s voivodeships are mostly named after historical and geographical regions, while those prior to 1998 generally took their names from the cities on which they were centered. The new units range in area from under (Opole Voivodeship) to over (Masovian Voivodeship), and in population from nearly one million (Opole Voivodeship) to over five million (Masovian Voivodeship).

Administrative authority at the voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed governor called a voivode (), an elected assembly called a , and an executive board () chosen by that assembly, headed by a voivodeship marshal (). Voivodeships are further divided into (&#x27;counties&#x27;) and (&#x27;communes&#x27; or &#x27;municipalities&#x27;), the smallest administrative divisions of Poland.

== Etymology and use ==
Some English-language sources, in historical contexts, speak of &quot;palatinates&quot; rather than &quot;voivodeships&quot;. The term &quot;&quot; traces back to the Latin , which traces back to &quot;palatium&quot; (&quot;palace&quot;).

More commonly used now is &quot;province&quot; or &quot;voivodeship&quot;. The latter is a loanword-calque hybrid formed on the Polish &quot;&quot;.

Some writers argue against rendering in English as &quot;province&quot;, on historical grounds: before the third, last Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, in 1795, each of the main constituent &quot;regions&quot; of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth—Greater Poland, Lesser Poland, Lithuania, and Royal Prussia—was sometimes idiosyncratically referred to as a &quot;province&quot; (). According to the argument, such a &quot;prowincja&quot; (for example, Greater Poland) cannot consist of a number of subdivisions (&quot;, the plural of &quot;) that are likewise called &quot;provinces&quot;. This, however, is an antiquarian consideration, as the word &quot;province&quot; has not been used in Poland in this sense of a &quot;region&quot; for over two centuries; and those former larger political units, all now obsolete, can now be referred to in English as what they actually were: &quot;regions&quot;.

The Polish , designating a second-tier Polish or Polish–Lithuanian administrative unit, derives from , (etymologically, a &#x27;warlord&#x27;, &#x27;war leader&#x27; or &#x27;leader of warriors&#x27;, but now simply the governor of a ) and the suffix (a &quot;state or condition&quot;).

The English &quot;voivodeship&quot;, which is a hybrid of the loanword &quot;voivode&quot; and &quot;-ship&quot; (the latter a suffix that calques the Polish suffix ), has never been much used and is absent from many dictionaries. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, it first appeared in 1792, spelled &quot;woiwodship&quot;, in the sense of &quot;the district or province governed by a voivode.&quot; The word subsequently appeared in 1886 also in the sense of &quot;the office or dignity of a voivode.&quot;

Poland&#x27;s Commission on Standardization of Geographic Names outside the Republic of Poland, prefers the form which omits the &#x27;e&#x27;, recommending the spelling &quot;&quot;, for use in English.

== Current ==
=== Administrative powers ===
Competences and powers at voivodeship level are shared between the voivode (governor), the sejmik (regional assembly) and the marshal. In most cases these institutions are all based in one city, but in Kuyavian-Pomeranian and Lubusz Voivodeship the voivode&#x27;s offices are in a different city from those of the executive and the sejmik. Voivodeship capitals are listed in the table below.

The &quot;voivode&quot; is appointed by the Prime Minister and is the regional representative of the central government. The voivode acts as the head of central government institutions at regional level (such as the police and fire services, passport offices, and various inspectorates), manages central government property in the region, oversees the functioning of local government, coordinates actions in the field of public safety and environment protection, and exercises special powers in emergencies. The voivode&#x27;s offices collectively are known as the .

The is elected every five years. (The first of the five-year terms began in 2018; previous terms lasted four years.)) Elections for the fall at the same time as that of local authorities at and level. The passes by-laws, including the voivodeship&#x27;s development strategies and budget. It also elects the and other members of the executive, and holds them to account.

The &quot;executive&quot; (), headed by the drafts the budget and development strategies, implements the resolutions of the , manages the voivodeship&#x27;s property, and deals with many aspects of regional policy, including management of European Union funding. The marshal&#x27;s offices are collectively known as the .

=== Economies ===
According to 2017 Eurostat data, the GDP per capita of Polish voivodeships varies notably and there is a large gap between the richest per capita voivodeship (being the Masovian Voivodeship at 33,500 EUR) and the poorest per capita (being the Lublin Voivodeship at 14,400 EUR).

=== Second Polish Republic ===
The administrative division of Poland in the interwar period included 16 voivodeships and Warsaw (with voivodeship rights). The voivodeships that remained in Poland after World War II as a result of Polish–Soviet border agreement of August 1945 were very similar to the current voivodeships.


=== Polish People&#x27;s Republic ===
After World War II, the new administrative division of the country within the new national borders was based on the prewar one and included 14 (+2) voivodeships, then 17 (+5). The voivodeships in the east that had not been annexed by the Soviet Union had their borders left almost unchanged. The newly acquired territories in the west and north were organized into the new voivodeships of Szczecin, Wrocław and Olsztyn, and partly joined to Gdańsk, Katowice and Poznań voivodeships. Two cities were granted voivodeship status: Warsaw and Łódź.

In 1950, new voivodeships were created: Koszalin (previously part of Szczecin), Opole (previously part of Katowice), and Zielona Góra (previously part of Poznań, Wrocław and Szczecin voivodeships). In 1957, three more cities were granted voivodeship status: Wrocław, Kraków and Poznań.


Poland&#x27;s voivodeships 1975–1998
Administrative division of Poland between 1979 and 1998 included 49 voivodeships upheld after the establishment of the Third Polish Republic in 1989 for another decade. This reorganization of administrative division of Poland was mainly a result of local government reform acts of 1973–1975. In place of the three-level administrative division (voivodeship, county, commune), a new two-level administrative division was introduced (49 small voivodeships, and communes). The three smallest voivodeships—Warsaw, Kraków and Łódź—had the special status of municipal voivodeship; the city president (mayor) was also provincial governor.

<text>Cod (: cod) is the common name for the demersal fish genus &quot;Gadus&quot;, belonging to the family Gadidae. Cod is also used as part of the common name for a number of other fish species, and one species that belongs to genus &quot;Gadus&quot; is commonly not called cod (Alaska pollock, &quot;Gadus chalcogrammus&quot;).

The two most common species of cod are the Atlantic cod (&quot;Gadus morhua&quot;), which lives in the colder waters and deeper sea regions throughout the North Atlantic, and the Pacific cod (&quot;Gadus macrocephalus&quot;), which is found in both eastern and western regions of the northern Pacific. &quot;Gadus morhua&quot; was named by Linnaeus in 1758. (However, &quot;G. morhua callarias&quot;, a low-salinity, nonmigratory race restricted to parts of the Baltic, was originally described as &quot;Gadus callarias&quot; by Linnaeus.)

Cod as food is popular in several parts of the world. It has a mild flavour and a dense, flaky, white flesh. Cod livers are processed to make cod liver oil, a common source of vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). Young Atlantic cod or haddock prepared in strips for cooking is called scrod. In the United Kingdom, Atlantic cod is one of the most common ingredients in fish and chips, along with haddock and plaice.
==Species==
At various times in the past, taxonomists included many species in the genus &quot;Gadus&quot;. Most of these are now either classified in other genera, or have been recognized as forms of one of three species. All these species have a number of common names, most of them ending with the word &quot;cod&quot;, whereas other species, as closely related, have other common names (such as pollock and haddock). However, many other, unrelated species also have common names ending with cod. The usage often changes with different localities and at different times.

===Cod in the genus &quot;Gadus&quot;/True cod===

Three species in the genus &quot;Gadus&quot; are currently called cod:

The fourth species of genus Gadus, &quot;Gadus chalcogrammus&quot;, is commonly called &quot;Alaska pollock&quot; or &quot;walleye pollock&quot;. But there are also less widespread alternative trade names highlighting the fish&#x27;s belonging to the cod genus, like &quot;snow cod&quot; or &quot;bigeye cod&quot;.

===Related species===
&quot;Cod&quot; forms part of the common name of many other fish no longer classified in the genus &quot;Gadus&quot;. Many are members of the family Gadidae; others are members of three related families within the order Gadiformes whose names include the word &quot;cod&quot;: the morid cods, Moridae (100 or so species); the eel cods, Muraenolepididae (four species); and the Eucla cod, Euclichthyidae (one species). The tadpole cod family (Ranicipitidae) has now been placed in Gadidae.

Some fish have common names derived from &quot;cod&quot;, such as codling, codlet, or tomcod. (&quot;Codling&quot; is also used as a name for a young cod.)

===Other species===
Some fish commonly known as cod are unrelated to &quot;Gadus&quot;. Part of this name confusion is market-driven. Severely shrunken Atlantic cod stocks have led to the marketing of cod replacements using culinary names of the form &quot;&quot;x&quot; cod&quot;, according to culinary rather than phyletic similarity. The common names for the following species have become well established; note that all inhabit the Southern Hemisphere.

==== Perciformes ====
Fish of the order Perciformes that are commonly called &quot;cod&quot; include:
*Blue cod &quot;Parapercis colias&quot;
*Eastern freshwater cod &quot;Maccullochella ikei&quot;
*Mary River cod &quot;Maccullochella mariensis&quot;
*Murray cod &quot;Maccullochella peelii&quot;
*Potato cod &quot;Epinephelus tukula&quot;
*Sleepy cod &quot;Oxyeleotris lineolatus&quot;
*Trout cod &quot;Maccullochella macquariensis&quot;
*The notothen family, Nototheniidae, including:
**Antarctic cod &quot;Dissostichus mawsoni&quot;
***&quot;Dissostichus eliginoides&quot;, the Patagonian toothfish, is also marketed as &quot;cod&quot;
**Black cod &quot;Notothenia microlepidota&quot;
**Maori cod &quot;Paranotothenia magellanica&quot;

==== Rock cod, reef cod, and coral cod ====
Almost all coral cod, reef cod or rock cod are also in order Perciformes. Most are better known as groupers, and belong to the family Serranidae. Others belong to the Nototheniidae. Two exceptions are the Australasian red rock cod, which belongs to a different order (see below), and the fish known simply as the rock cod and as soft cod in New Zealand, &quot;Lotella rhacina&quot;, which as noted above actually is related to the true cod (it is a morid cod).

==== Scorpaeniformes ====
From the order Scorpaeniformes:
*Ling cod &quot;Ophiodon elongatus&quot;
*Red rock cod &quot;Scorpaena papillosa&quot;
*Rock cod &quot;Sebastes&quot;

==== Ophidiiformes ====
The tadpole cod family, Ranicipitidae, and the Eucla cod family, Euclichthyidae, were formerly classified in the order Ophidiiformes, but are now grouped with the Gadiformes.

===Marketed as cod===
Some fish that do not have &quot;cod&quot; in their names are sometimes sold as cod. Haddock and whiting belong to the same family, the Gadidae, as cod.
* Haddock &quot;Melanogrammus aeglefinus&quot;
* Whiting &quot;Merlangius merlangus&quot;

==Characteristics==

Cods of the genus &quot;Gadus&quot; have three rounded dorsal and two anal fins. The pelvic fins are small, with the first ray extended, and are set under the gill cover (i.e. the throat region), in front of the pectoral fins. The upper jaw extends over the lower jaw, which has a well-developed chin barbel. The eyes are medium-sized, approximately the same as the length of the chin barbel. Cod have a distinct white lateral line running from the gill slit above the pectoral fin, to the base of the caudal or tail fin. The back tends to be a greenish to sandy brown, and shows extensive mottling, especially towards the lighter sides and white belly. Dark brown colouration of the back and sides is not uncommon, especially for individuals that have resided in rocky inshore regions.

The Atlantic cod can change colour at certain water depths. It has two distinct colour phases: gray-green and reddish brown. Its average weight is , but specimens weighing up to have been recorded. Pacific cod are smaller than Atlantic cod and are darker in colour.

==Distribution==
Atlantic cod (&quot;Gadus morhua&quot;) live in the colder waters and deeper sea regions throughout the North Atlantic. Pacific cod (&quot;Gadus macrocephalus&quot;) is found in both eastern and western regions of the Pacific.

Atlantic cod could be further divided into several stocks, including the Arcto-Norwegian, North Sea, Baltic Sea, Faroe, Iceland, East Greenland, West Greenland, Newfoundland, and Labrador stocks. There seems to be little interchange between the stocks, although migrations to their individual breeding grounds may involve distances of or more. For instance, eastern Baltic cod shows specific reproductive adaptations to low salinity compared to Western Baltic and Atlantic cod.

Atlantic cod occupy varied habitats, favouring rough ground, especially inshore, and are demersal in depths between , on average, although not uncommonly to depths of . Off the Norwegian and New England coasts and on the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, cod congregate at certain seasons in water of depth. Cod are gregarious and form schools, although shoaling tends to be a feature of the spawning season.

==Life cycle==
Spawning of northeastern Atlantic cod occurs between January and April (March and April are the peak months), at a depth of in specific spawning grounds at water temperatures between . Around the UK, the major spawning grounds are in the middle to southern North Sea, the start of the Bristol Channel (north of Newquay), the Irish Channel (both east and west of the Isle of Man), around Stornoway, and east of Helmsdale.

Prespawning courtship involves fin displays and male grunting, which leads to pairing. The male inverts himself beneath the female, and the pair swim in circles while spawning. The eggs are planktonic and hatch between eight and 23 days, with larva reaching in length. This planktonic phase lasts some ten weeks, enabling the young cod to increase its body weight by 40-fold, and growing to about . The young cod then move to the seabed and change their diet to small benthic crustaceans, such as isopods and small crabs. They increase in size to in the first six months, by the end of their first year, and to by the end of the second. Growth tends to be less at higher latitudes. Cod reach maturity at about at about 3 to 4 years of age. Changes in growth rate over decades of particular stocks have been reported, current eastern Baltic cod shows the lowest growth observed since 1955.

==Ecology==
Adult cod are active hunters, feeding on sand eels, whiting, haddock, small cod, squid, crabs, lobsters, mussels, worms, mackerel, and molluscs.

In the Baltic Sea the most important prey species are herring and sprat. Many studies that analyze the stomach contents of these fish indicate that cod is the top predator, preying on the herring and sprat. Sprat form particularly high concentrations in the Bornholm Basin in the southern Baltic Sea. Although cod feed primarily on adult sprat, sprat tend to prey on the cod eggs and larvae.

Cod and related species are plagued by parasites. For example, the cod worm, &quot;Lernaeocera branchialis&quot;, starts life as a copepod-like larva, a small free-swimming crustacean. The first host used by the larva is a flatfish or lumpsucker, which it captures with grasping hooks at the front of its body. It penetrates the fish with a thin , which it uses to suck the fish&#x27;s blood. The nourished larvae then mate on the fish. The female larva, with her now fertilized eggs, then finds a cod, or a cod-like fish such as a haddock or whiting. There the larva clings to the gills while it metamorphoses into a plump sinusoidal wormlike body with a coiled mass of egg strings at the rear. The front part of the worm&#x27;s body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host&#x27;s heart. There, firmly rooted in the cod&#x27;s circulatory system, the front part of the parasite develops like the branches of a tree, reaching into the main artery. In this way, the worm extracts nutrients from the cod&#x27;s blood, remaining safely tucked beneath the cod&#x27;s gill cover until it releases a new generation of offspring into the water.

==Fisheries==


The 2006 northwest Atlantic cod quota is 23,000 tons, representing half the available stocks, while the northeast Atlantic quota is 473,000 tons. Pacific cod is currently enjoying strong global demand. The 2006 total allowable catch (TAC) for the Gulf of Alaska and Aleutian Islands was 260,000 tons.

==Aquaculture==
Farming of Atlantic cod has received a significant amount of interest due to the overall trend of increasing cod prices alongside reduced wild catches. However, progress in creating large scale farming of cod has been slow, mainly due to bottlenecks in the larval production stage, where survival and growth are often unpredictable. It has been suggested that this bottleneck may be overcome by ensuring cod larvae are fed diets with similar nutritional content as the copepods they feed on in the wild Recent examples have shown that increasing dietary levels of minerals such as selenium, iodine and zinc may improve survival and/or biomarkers for health in aquaculture reared cod larvae.
==As food==

Cod is popular as a food with a mild flavour and a dense, flaky white flesh. Cod livers are processed to make cod liver oil, an important source of vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA).

Young Atlantic cod or haddock prepared in strips for cooking is called scrod. In the United Kingdom, Atlantic cod is one of the most common ingredients in fish and chips, along with haddock and plaice. Cod&#x27;s soft liver can be tinned (canned) and eaten. 
==History==
Cod has been an important economic commodity in international markets since the Viking period (around 800 AD). Norwegians travelled with dried cod and soon a dried cod market developed in southern Europe. This market has lasted for more than 1,000 years, enduring the Black Death, wars and other crises, and is still an important Norwegian fish trade. The Portuguese began fishing cod in the 15th century. Clipfish is widely enjoyed in Portugal. The Basques played an important role in the cod trade, and allegedly found the Canadian fishing banks before Columbus&#x27; discovery of America. The North American east coast developed in part due to the vast cod stocks. Many cities in the New England area are located near cod fishing grounds. The fish was so important to the history and development of Massachusetts, the state&#x27;s House of Representatives hung a wood carving of a codfish, known as the Sacred Cod of Massachusetts, in its chambers.

Apart from the long history, cod differ from most fish because the fishing grounds are far from population centres. The large cod fisheries along the coast of North Norway (and in particular close to the Lofoten islands) have been developed almost uniquely for export, depending on sea transport of stockfish over large distances. Since the introduction of salt, dried and salted cod (clipfish or &#x27;klippfisk&#x27; in Norwegian) has also been exported. By the end of the 14th century, the Hanseatic League dominated trade operations and sea transport, with Bergen as the most important port.

William Pitt the Elder, criticizing the Treaty of Paris in Parliament, claimed cod was &quot;British gold&quot;; and that it was folly to restore Newfoundland fishing rights to the French.

In the 17th and 18th centuries in the New World, especially in Massachusetts and Newfoundland, cod became a major commodity, creating trade networks and cross-cultural exchanges. In 1733, Britain tried to gain control over trade between New England and the British Caribbean by imposing the Molasses Act, which they believed would eliminate the trade by making it unprofitable. The cod trade grew instead, because the &quot;French were eager to work with the New Englanders in a lucrative contraband arrangement&quot;. In addition to increasing trade, the New England settlers organized into a &quot;codfish aristocracy&quot;. The colonists rose up against Britain&#x27;s &quot;tariff on an import&quot;.

In the 20th century, Iceland re-emerged as a fishing power and entered the Cod Wars. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, fishing off the European and American coasts severely depleted stocks and become a major political issue. The necessity of restricting catches to allow stocks to recover upset the fishing industry and politicians who are reluctant to hurt employment.

===Collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery===


On July 2, 1992, the Honourable John Crosbie, Canadian Federal Minister of Fisheries and Oceans, declared a two-year moratorium on the Northern Cod fishery, a designated fishing region off the coast of Newfoundland, after data showed that the total cod biomass had suffered a collapse to less than 1% of its normal value. The minister championed the measure as a temporary solution, allowing the cod population time to recover. The fisheries had long shaped the lives and communities on Canada&#x27;s Atlantic eastern coast for the preceding five centuries. Societies which are dependent on fishing have a strong mutual relationship with them: the act of fishing changes the ecosystems&#x27; balance, which forces the fishery and, in turn, the fishing societies to adapt to new ecological conditions.

The near-complete destruction of the Atlantic northwest cod biomass off the shores devastated coastal communities, which had been overexploiting the same cod population for decades. The fishermen along the Atlantic northwest had employed modern fishing technologies, including the ecologically-devastating practice of trawling, especially in the years leading up to the 1990s, in the misguided belief that fishing stocks are perpetually plentiful and unable to be depleted. After this assumption was empirically and abruptly shown to be incorrect, to the dismay of government officials and rural workers, some 19,000 fishermen and cod processing plant workers in Newfoundland lost their employment. The powerful economic engine of rural Newfoundland coughed, wheezed, and died. Nearly 40,000 workers and harvesters in the provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador applied for the federal relief program TAGS (the Atlantic Groundfish Strategy). Abandoned and rusting fishing boats still litter the coasts of Newfoundland and the Canadian northwest to this day.

The fishery minister, John Crosbie, after delivering a speech on the day before the declaration of the moratorium, or July 1, 1992, was publicly heckled and verbally harassed by disgruntled locals at a fishing village. The moratorium, initially lasting for only two years, was indefinitely extended after it became evident that cod populations had not recovered at all but, instead, had continued to spiral downward in both size and numbers, due to the damage caused by decades of horrible fishing practices, and the fact that the moratorium had permitted exceptions for food fisheries for &quot;personal consumption&quot; purposes to this very day. Some 12,000 tons of Northwest cod are still being caught every year along the Newfoundland coast by local fishermen.

The collapse of the four-million ton biomass, which had persevered through several previous marine extinctions over tens of millions of years, in a timespan of no more than 20 years, is oft-cited by researchers as one of the most visible examples of the phenomenon of the &quot;Tragedy of the Commons.&quot; Factors which had been implicated as contributing to the collapse include: overfishing; government mismanagement; the disregard of scientific uncertainty; warming habitat waters; declining reproduction; and plain human ignorance. The Northern Cod biomass has been recovering slowly since the imposition of the moratorium. However, as of 2021, the growth of the cod population has been stagnant since 2017, and some scientists argue that the population will not rebound unless the Fisheries Department of Canada lower its yearly quota to 5,000 tons.

<doc id="41519" wikidata="Q579649" url="?curid=41519" title="Photic zone">
<text>The photic zone (or euphotic zone, epipelagic zone, or sunlight zone) is the uppermost layer of a body of water that receives sunlight, allowing phytoplankton to perform photosynthesis. It undergoes a series of physical, chemical, and biological processes that supply nutrients into the upper water column. The photic zone is home to the majority of aquatic life due to the activity (primary production) of the phytoplankton. The thicknesses of the photic and euphotic zones vary with the intensity of sunlight as a function of season and latitude and with the degree of water turbidity. The bottommost, or aphotic, zone is the region of perpetual darkness that lies beneath the photic zone and includes most of the ocean waters.

== Photosynthesis in photic zone ==
In the photic zone, the photosynthesis rate exceeds the respiration rate. This is due to the abundant solar energy which is used as an energy source for photosynthesis by primary producers such as phytoplankton. These phytoplankton grow extremely quickly because of sunlight&#x27;s heavy influence, enabling it to be produced at a fast rate. In fact, ninety five percent of photosynthesis in the ocean occurs in the photic zone. Therefore, if we go deeper, beyond the photic zone, such as into the compensation point, there is little to no phytoplankton, because of insufficient sunlight. The zone which extends from the base of the euphotic zone to the aphotic zone is sometimes called the dysphotic zone.

== Life in the photic zone ==


Ninety percent of marine life lives in the photic zone, which is approximately two hundred meters deep. This includes phytoplankton (plants), including dinoflagellates, diatoms, cyanobacteria, coccolithophores, and cryptomonads. It also includes zooplankton, the consumers in the photic zone. There are carnivorous meat eaters and herbivorous plant eaters. Next, copepods are the small crustaceans distributed everywhere in the photic zone. Finally, there are nekton (animals that can propel themselves, like fish, squids, and crabs), which are the largest and the most obvious animals in the photic zone, but their quantity is the smallest among all the groups. Phytoplankton are microscopic plants living suspended in the water column that have little or no means of motility. They are primary producers that use solar energy as a food source.

Detritivores and scavengers are rare in the photic zone. Microbial decomposition of dead organisms begins here and continues once the bodies sink to the aphotic zone where they form the most important source of nutrients for deep sea organisms. The depth of the photic zone depends on the transparency of the water. If the water is very clear, the photic zone can become very deep. If it is very murky, it can be only fifty feet (fifteen meters) deep.

Animals within the photic zone use the cycle of light and dark as an important environmental signal, migration is directly linked to this fact, fishes use the concept of dusk and dawn when its time to migrate, the photic zone resembles this concept providing a sense of time. These animals can be herrings and sardines and other fishes that consistently live within the photic zone.

== Nutrient uptake in the photic zone ==
Due to biological uptake, the photic zone has relatively low levels of nutrient concentrations. As a result, phytoplankton doesn&#x27;t receive enough nutrients when there is high water-column stability. The spatial distribution of organisms can be controlled by a number of factors. Physical factors include: temperature, hydrostatic pressure, turbulent mixing such as the upward turbulent flux of inorganic nitrogen across the nutricline. Chemical factors include oxygen and trace elements. Biological factors include grazing and migrations. Upwelling carries nutrients from the deep waters into the photic zone, strengthening phytoplankton growth. The remixing and upwelling eventually bring nutrient-rich wastes back into the photic zone. The Ekman transport additionally brings more nutrients to the photic zone. Nutrient pulse frequency affects the phytoplankton competition. Photosynthesis produces more of it. Being the first link in the food chain, what happens to phytoplankton creates a rippling effect for other species. Besides phytoplankton, many other animals also live in this zone and utilize these nutrients. The majority of ocean life occurs in the photic zone, the smallest ocean zone by water volume. The photic zone, although small, has a large impact on those who reside in it.

== Photic zone depth ==

The depth is, by definition, where radiation is degraded down to 1% of its surface strength. Accordingly, its thickness depends on the extent of light attenuation in the water column. As incoming light at the surface can vary widely, this says little about the net growth of phytoplankton. Typical euphotic depths vary from only a few centimetres in highly turbid eutrophic lakes, to around 200 meters in the open ocean. It also varies with seasonal changes in turbidity, which can be strongly driven by phytoplankton concentrations, such that the depth of the photic zone often decreases as primary production increases. Moreover, the respiration rate is actually greater than the photosynthesis rate. The reason why phytoplankton production is so important is because it plays a prominent role when interwoven with other food webs.

==Light attenuation==

Most of the solar energy reaching the Earth is in the range of visible light, with wavelengths between about 400-700 nm. Each colour of visible light has a unique wavelength, and together they make up white light. The shortest wavelengths are on the violet and ultraviolet end of the spectrum, while the longest wavelengths are at the red and infrared end. In between, the colours of the visible spectrum comprise the familiar “ROYGBIV”; red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet.

Water is very effective at absorbing incoming light, so the amount of light penetrating the ocean declines rapidly (is attenuated) with depth. At one metre depth only 45% of the solar energy that falls on the ocean surface remains. At 10 metres depth only 16% of the light is still present, and only 1% of the original light is left at 100 metres. No light penetrates beyond 1000 metres.

In addition to overall attenuation, the oceans absorb the different wavelengths of light at different rates. The wavelengths at the extreme ends of the visible spectrum are attenuated faster than those wavelengths in the middle. Longer wavelengths are absorbed first; red is absorbed in the upper 10 metres, orange by about 40 metres, and yellow disappears before 100 metres. Shorter wavelengths penetrate further, with blue and green light reaching the deepest depths.

This is why things appear blue underwater. How colours are perceived by the eye depends on the wavelengths of light that are received by the eye. An object appears red to the eye because it reflects red light and absorbs other colours. So the only colour reaching the eye is red. Blue is the only colour of light available at depth underwater, so it is the only colour that can be reflected back to the eye, and everything has a blue tinge under water. A red object at depth will not appear red to us because there is no red light available to reflect off of the object. Objects in water will only appear as their real colours near the surface where all wavelengths of light are still available, or if the other wavelengths of light are provided artificially, such as by illuminating the object with a dive light.

Water in the open ocean appears clear and blue because it contains much less particulate matter, such as phytoplankton or other suspended particles, and the clearer the water, the deeper the light penetration. Blue light penetrates deeply and is scattered by the water molecules, while all other colours are absorbed; thus the water appears blue. On the other hand, coastal water often appears greenish. Coastal water contains much more suspended silt and algae and microscopic organisms than the open ocean. Many of these organisms, such as phytoplankton, absorb light in the blue and red range through their photosynthetic pigments, leaving green as the dominant wavelength of reflected light. Therefore the higher the phytoplankton concentration in water, the greener it appears. Small silt particles may also absorb blue light, further shifting the colour of water away from blue when there are high concentrations of suspended particles.

The ocean can be divided into depth layers depending on the amount of light penetration, as discussed in pelagic zone. The upper 200 metres is referred to as the photic or euphotic zone. This represents the region where enough light can penetrate to support photosynthesis, and it corresponds to the epipelagic zone. From 200 to 1000 metres lies the dysphotic zone, or the twilight zone (corresponding with the mesopelagic zone). There is still some light at these depths, but not enough to support photosynthesis. Below 1000 metres is the aphotic (or midnight) zone, where no light penetrates. This region includes the majority of the ocean volume, which exists in complete darkness.

== Paleoclimatology ==

Phytoplankton are unicellular microorganisms which form the base of the ocean food chains. They are dominated by diatoms, which grow silicate shells called frustules. When diatoms die their shells can settle on the seafloor and become microfossils. Over time, these microfossils become buried as opal deposits in the marine sediment. Paleoclimatology is the study of past climates. Proxy data is used in order to relate elements collected in modern-day sedimentary samples to climatic and oceanic conditions in the past. Paleoclimate proxies refer to preserved or fossilized physical markers which serve as substitutes for direct meteorological or ocean measurements. An example of proxies is the use of diatom isotope records of δ13C, δ18O, δ30Si (δ13Cdiatom, δ18Odiatom, and δ30Sidiatom). In 2015, Swann and Snelling used these isotope records to document historic changes in the photic zone conditions of the north-west Pacific Ocean, including nutrient supply and the efficiency of the soft-tissue biological pump, from the modern day back to marine isotope stage 5e, which coincides with the last interglacial period. Peaks in opal productivity in the marine isotope stage are associated with the breakdown of the regional halocline stratification and increased nutrient supply to the photic zone.


The initial development of the halocline and stratified water column has been attributed to the onset of major Northern Hemisphere glaciation at 2.73 Ma, which increased the flux of freshwater to the region, via increased monsoonal rainfall and/or glacial meltwater, and sea surface temperatures. The decrease of abyssal water upwelling associated with this may have contributed to the establishment of globally cooler conditions and the expansion of glaciers across the Northern Hemisphere from 2.73 Ma. While the halocline appears to have prevailed through the late Pliocene and early Quaternary glacial–interglacial cycles, other studies have shown that the stratification boundary may have broken down in the late Quaternary at glacial terminations and during the early part of interglacials.

== Phytoplankton side notes. ==

Phytoplankton are restricted to the photo zone only. As its growth is completely dependent upon photosynthesis. This results in the 50–100 m water level inside the ocean. Growth can also come from land factors, for example minerals that are dissolved from rocks, mineral nutrients from generations of plants and animals ,that made its way into the photic zone.
An increase in the amount of phytoplankton also creates an increase in zooplankton, the zooplankton feeds on the phytoplankton as they are at the bottom of the food chain.

== Dimethylsulfide ==
Dimethylsulfide loss within the photic zone is controlled by microbial uptake and photochemical degradation. But what exactly is dimethylsulfide and why is it important? This compound (see the photo) helps regulate sulfur cycle and ecology within the ocean. Marine bacteria, algae, coral and most other organisms within the ocean release this, constituting a range of gene families.

However this compound can be toxic to humans if swallowed, absorbed through the skin and inhaled. Proteins within plants and animals depend on this compound. Making it a significant part of ecology, it&#x27;s good to know that it lives in the photic zone as well.

<text>Masovian Voivodeship or Mazowieckie Province or Mazowieckie Voivodeship or Mazovian Voivodeship or Mazovian Province, etc. (, ) is a voivodeship (province) in east-central Poland, containing Poland&#x27;s capital Warsaw. 

Masovian Voivodeship has an area of and had a 2019 population of 5,411,446, making it Poland&#x27;s largest and most populous province. Its principal cities are Warsaw (1.783 million) in the center of the Warsaw metropolitan area, Radom (212,230) to the south, Płock (119,709) to the west, Siedlce (77,990) to the east, and Ostrołęka (52,071) to the north. It borders six other provinces: Warmian-Masurian to the north, Podlaskie to the northeast, Lublin to the southeast, Świętokrzyskie (Holy Cross) to the south, Łódź to the southwest, and Kuyavian-Pomeranian to the northwest.

The name of the province recalls the region&#x27;s traditional name, Mazovia (in Polish &quot;Mazowsze&quot;, also spelled Masovia), with which it is roughly coterminous. However, the province&#x27;s southern part, including Radom, historically belonged to Lesser Poland; while Łomża with environs, though historically part of Mazovia, is now part of Podlaskie Voivodeship.

Masovian Voivodeship is Poland&#x27;s prime center of science, research, education, industry, and infrastructure. It has Poland&#x27;s lowest unemployment rate and is a very high-income province. It is also popular with tourists due to the many historical monuments and its over 20% forested area of pine and oak. The province&#x27;s Kampinos National Park is a UNESCO biosphere reserve.

==History==

In the Early Middle Ages, the territory was inhabited by the Masovians, an old Polish tribe. It formed part of Poland since its establishment in the 10th century, with the then-regional capital Płock being the capital of Poland from 1079 to 1138. The &quot;Wzgórze Tumskie&quot; (&quot;Cathedral Hill&quot;) in Płock with the Płock Castle and the Catholic Cathedral, seat of one of the oldest Polish dioceses, est. in 1075, which contains the sarcophagi of a number of Polish monarchs, is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland. Later, Płock, Warsaw and Czersk were medieval ducal seats of the Piast dynasty. 

In 1505, Radom hosted the session of the Sejm (Polish Parliament), which enacted the &quot;Nihil novi&quot; act, and in the 16th century, Warsaw hosted several sessions of the Sejm, before King Sigismund III Vasa moved the Polish capital from Kraków to Warsaw in 1596. 

Following the late-18th-century Partitions of Poland, the region witnessed several uprisings against foreign rule: the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794, the November Uprising of 1830–1831, and the January Uprising of 1863–1864. 

In the interbellum, the region was part of reborn independent Poland. In 1920, the region was invaded by Soviet Russia, but Poland secured its freedom in the victorious Battle of Warsaw. The southern part of the current province was rapidly industrialized as part of the Central Industrial Region of Poland.

During World War II, it was occupied by Germany, with the occupiers committing their genocidal policies against Poles and Jews in the region, with expulsions, massacres of civilians and prisoners of war, including at Ciepielów, Śladów, Zakroczym, Ostrów Mazowiecka, Palmiry, Firlej, Skłoby, Nur, Ochota, Wola, and Lipniak-Majorat. Germany operated numerous prisons, forced labour camps, the Treblinka extermination camp, in which some 700,000–900,000 people were murdered, and several prisoner-of-war camps for Polish, Italian, French, Soviet, and Romanian prisoners of war.

Masovian Province was created on 1 January 1999, under the Polish local-government reforms adopted in 1998, out of the former provinces of Warsaw, Płock, Ciechanów, Ostrołęka, Siedlce, and Radom.

==Administrative division==

==Historical==
===Masovian Voivodeship (1526–1795)===
Masovia Voivodeship, 1526–1795 () was an administrative region of the Kingdom of Poland, and of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, from the 15th century until the partitions of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth (1795). Together with Płock and Rawa Voivodeships, it formed the province (prowincja) of Masovia.

===Masovian Voivodeship (1816–1837)===
Masovian Voivodeship was one of the voivodeships of Congress Poland. It was formed from the Warsaw Department and transformed into the Masovia Governorate.

Three major international road routes pass through the voivodeship: Cork–Berlin–Poznań–Warszawa–Minsk–Moscow–Omsk (European route E30), Prague–Wrocław–Warsaw–Białystok–Helsinki (E67) and Pskov–Gdańsk–Warsaw–Kraków–Budapest (E77).

Currently, there are various stretches of highways in the area, with the A2 highway connecting the region, and therefore the capital city, with the rest of Europe. The highway passes directly through the voivodeship from west to east, connecting it with Belarus and Germany. However, the A2 is yet to be built east of Warsaw to connect Poland with Belarus. The S7 expressway runs through Poland from the north to the south passing through Warsaw, the S8 connects Warsaw with Białystok, in the neighboring north-eastern province, also forming part of the Via Baltica which heads on to Lithuania, and to Wrocław in the south-west, and the S17 being built to connect Warsaw with Lublin in the south-east and on to Ukraine.

The two main railway carriers operating in the region are the regional Koleje Mazowieckie and nationwide PKP Intercity. Three of ten busiest railway stations of Poland are located in the voivodeship: Warszawa Centralna, Warszawa Wschodnia, Warszawa Zachodnia.

The main international airport in the region is Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport.

<doc id="41522" wikidata="Q477508" url="?curid=41522" title="Northanger Abbey">
<text>Northanger Abbey ( ) is a coming-of-age novel and a satire of Gothic novels written by the English author Jane Austen. Although the title page is dated 1818 and was published posthumously in 1817 with &quot;Persuasion&quot;, &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; was completed in 1803, making it the first of Austen&#x27;s novels to be completed in full. From a fondness of Gothic novels and an active imagination distorting her worldview, the story follows Catherine Morland, the naïve young protagonist, as she develops to better understand herself and the world around her.

Based on the different styles and different references to Gothic novels, it is apparent that Austen wrote &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; over the span of many years. It took her a long time to get her novel published too. It was not until after her death that her brother was able to get the book published. Once published, Austen received a mix of reviews. The novel covers a wide array of topics such as high society, Gothic fiction, bildungsroman, the value of reading, and the importance of time. This novel is considered to be more juvenile than her others.

Throughout &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, Austen makes references to many different Gothic novels, most notably &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot;. There are also many references to &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; in contemporary novels. Various different adaptations have been made throughout the years.

==Plot summary==
Seventeen-year-old Catherine Morland is one of ten children of a country clergyman. Although a tomboy in her childhood, she is &quot;in training for a heroine&quot; and is fond of reading Gothic novels &quot;provided they [are] all story and no reflection.&quot;The Allens (her wealthier neighbours in Fullerton) invite Catherine to accompany them in their visit to the city of Bath and partake in the winter season of balls, theatre and other social activities. Shortly after their arrival, she is introduced to a young gentleman, Henry Tilney, with whom she dances. Mrs. Allen meets an old school friend, Mrs. Thorpe, whose daughter, Isabella, quickly becomes friends with Catherine. Isabella introduces Catherine to Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s 1794 Gothic novel &quot;Mysteries of Udolpho&quot;. Mrs. Thorpe&#x27;s son, John, is a friend of Catherine&#x27;s older brother, James, at Oxford University where they are both students. The two young men come to Bath, where John is then introduced to Catherine.

The Thorpes are not happy about Catherine&#x27;s friendship with the Tilneys. They correctly perceive Henry as a rival for Catherine&#x27;s affections even though Catherine is not at all interested in John Thorpe. Despite Thorpe continually attempting to sabotage her relationship with the Tilneys, Catherine tries to maintain her friendships with both the Thorpes and the Tilneys. This leads to several misunderstandings, which put Catherine in the awkward position of having to explain herself to the Tilneys.

Isabella and James become engaged. James&#x27; father approves of the match and offers his son a country parson&#x27;s living of a modest sum, £400 annually, but they must wait until he can obtain the benefice in two and a half years. Isabella is dissatisfied, but to Catherine, she misrepresents her distress as being caused solely by the delay, and not by the value of the sum. Isabella immediately begins to flirt with Captain Frederick Tilney, Henry&#x27;s older brother. Innocent Catherine cannot understand her friend&#x27;s behaviour, but Henry understands all too well as he knows his brother&#x27;s character and habits.

The Tilneys invite Catherine to stay with them for a few weeks at their home, Northanger Abbey. Once at Northanger Abbey, Catherine and Eleanor Tilney, Henry&#x27;s and Frederick&#x27;s younger sister, get to know each other better on a personal level. Catherine, in accordance with her novel reading, expects the house to be exotic and frightening. Henry teases her about this as it turns out that Northanger Abbey is pleasant and decidedly not Gothic. However, the house includes a mysterious suite of rooms that no one ever enters; Catherine learns that they were the apartments of Mrs. Tilney, who died nine years earlier due to a serious illness, leaving Mr. Tilney with three children to raise by himself. As General Tilney no longer appears to be affected by her death, Catherine decides that he may have imprisoned her in her chamber, or even murdered her.

Catherine discovers that her over-active imagination has led her astray as nothing is strange or distressing in the apartments. Henry finds and questions her; he surmises and informs her that his father loved his wife in his own way and was truly upset by her death. She leaves the apartments, crying, fearing that she has lost Henry&#x27;s regard entirely. Realising how foolish she has been, Catherine comes to believe that, though novels may be delightful, their content does not relate to everyday life. Henry does not mention this incident to her again.

James writes to inform her that he has broken off his engagement to Isabella and implies that she has become engaged instead to Captain Tilney. Henry and Eleanor Tilney are sceptical that their brother has actually become engaged to Isabella Thorpe. Catherine is terribly disappointed, realising what a dishonest person Isabella is. A subsequent letter from Isabella herself confirms the Tilney siblings&#x27; doubts and shows that Frederick Tilney was merely flirting with Isabella. The General goes off to London, and the atmosphere at Northanger Abbey immediately becomes lighter and more pleasant from his absence. Catherine passes several enjoyable days with Henry and Eleanor until the General returns abruptly in a temper in Henry&#x27;s absence. He forces Catherine to go home early the next morning in a shocking and unsafe mode that forces Catherine to undertake the journey alone.

At home, Catherine is listless and unhappy. Henry pays a sudden unexpected visit and explains what happened. General Tilney (on the misinformation of John Thorpe) had believed her to be exceedingly rich as the Allens&#x27; prospective heiress, and therefore a proper match for Henry. In London, General Tilney ran into Thorpe again, who, angry at Catherine&#x27;s refusal of his earlier half-made proposal of marriage, said instead that she was nearly destitute. Enraged, General Tilney, (again on the misinformation of John Thorpe), returned home to evict Catherine. When Henry returned to Northanger, his father informed him of what had occurred and forbade him to think of Catherine again. When Henry learns how she had been treated, he breaks with his father and tells Catherine he still wants to marry her despite his father&#x27;s disapproval. Catherine is delighted, though when Henry seeks her parents&#x27; approval, they tell the young couple that final approval will only happen when General Tilney consents.

Eventually, General Tilney acquiesces because Eleanor has become engaged to a wealthy and titled man; he discovers that the Morlands, while not extremely rich, are far from destitute.

==Composition==
According to notes written by Austen&#x27;s sister Cassandra after Jane&#x27;s death in 1817, the novel was finished by 1798 or 1799. The close resemblance in style to Austen&#x27;s &quot;juvenilia&quot; of the early 1790s together with several in-jokes that only the Austen family could have appreciated strongly suggests that the book was begun during that period, probably about 1794. However, the references to several Gothic novels published after 1794 would indicate Austen did not finish the book until about 1798 or 1799 as Cassandra Austen remembered. The scholar Cecil Emden argued that differences between the Catherine portrayed in the Bath section of the novel vs. the Catherine at Northanger Abbey were due to Austen finishing the book at a different stage of her life than when she started.

==Publication==

Austen initially sold the novel, then titled &quot;Susan&quot;, for £10 to a London bookseller, Crosby &amp; Co. in 1803. This publisher did not print the work but held on to the manuscript. Austen reportedly threatened to take her work back from them, but Crosby &amp; Co responded that she would face legal consequences for reclaiming her text. In the spring of 1816, the bookseller sold it back to the novelist&#x27;s brother, Henry Austen, for the same sum as they had paid for it. There is evidence that Austen further revised the novel in 1816–1817 with the intention of having it published. She rewrote sections, renaming the main character Catherine and using that as her working title.

After her death, Austen&#x27;s brother Henry gave the novel its final name and arranged for publication of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; in late December 1817 (1818 given on the title page), as the first two volumes of a four-volume set, with a preface for the first time publicly identifying Jane Austen as the author of all her novels. Neither &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; nor &quot;Persuasion&quot; was published under the working title Jane Austen used. Aside from first being published together, the two novels are not connected; later editions were published separately.

== Reputation ==
&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot;, published together posthumously in December 1817, were reviewed in the &quot;British Critic&quot; in March 1818 and in the &quot;Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany&quot; in May 1818. The reviewer for the &quot;British Critic&quot; felt that Austen&#x27;s exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the &quot;Edinburgh Review&quot; disagreed, praising Austen for her &quot;exhaustless invention&quot; and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots.

Austen scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novelsfor example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers, for example, reduced &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; and &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.

==Major themes==
As in all of Austen&#x27;s novels, the subjects of society, status, behavior, and morality are addressed. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, however, being chronologically the first novel completed by Austen (though revised later in her life), is notably considered a &quot;point of departure&quot; from her other work as a result of the &quot;boldness with which it flaunts its ... deceptive air of simplicity with broad, bold humour&quot;.

=== Love, marriage and high society ===
Throughout &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, Austen demonstrates the ways in which women are socially and economically disadvantaged. Beth Lau demonstrates how Austen depicts Isabella wanting to be of higher status by choosing Captain Tilney over James Morland. Isabella tries to shop around in marriage market even though she does not have any choices to make. In doing so, she is turning herself into a commodity with nothing to offer. The washing bill that Catherine finds in the abbey works to highlight the disadvantaged position women hold to men economically. It is because of women that men&#x27;s economic position advances. To contrast the lack of choice women have in the economy, Austen uses the novel to give women a choice. Catherine is able to consume/buy novels rather than be a participant/commodity. Eleanor, however, is trapped within patriarchy through her selection to read masculine history instead of novels.

Both General Tilney and Captain Tilney work as examples of superficiality within the high society. With General Tilney, it is evident throughout the novel, but a specific clue is his obsession with fine China. This obsession showcases his greed and superficiality. For Frederick, known as &quot;The Captain,&quot; he represents Society&#x27;s dual standards for behavior for men and women. Captain Tilney refuses to dance with any of the women as a result of his disregard for them. Because of his higher status, he believes he is better than the women present. He also adds to the mystique of the Tilney family: Like father, Like son. Frederick&#x27;s actions make Henry and Eleanor more sympathetic characters and his ruining of Isabella does the same for her character. Henry makes it clear that Captain Tilney is just using Isabella since he would not marry someone in a lower status. Regina Jeffers notes that many readers perceive Frederick as nothing but selfish, greedy, and conniving.

When Henry tries to dissuade Catherine of her Gothic-inspired notions that General Tilney is a murderer, he cites male authors that were so influential in establishing rules of proper conduct. This is an attempt to try to dismiss one genre that was popular with women with another genre that was popular with men. Austen uses this discourse of the essays as an example of imposing power over women by using a type of language that limits what one may think. Henry&#x27;s speech is that expected of a polite society in Britain at the time. The ingenue Catherine is unfamiliar with the ways of a polite society. Henry establishes himself as worthy of being Catherine&#x27;s husband in his role as a &quot;lover mentor&quot; who teaches Catherine the ways of polite society to allow her to eventually fit in.

=== Life lived as in a Gothic novel ===
By creating a heroine who is an ordinary girl, Austen is upending the traditional role of Gothic heroines. The way for Catherine to find happiness in her life is by having an ordinary one, not one full of Gothic fantasy. When Catherine fears that General Tilney murdered his wife, these ideas stem from her knowledge of Gothic novels. Her fears of fantastical evil prove to be false, but the book ends with her discovery of a realistic evil surrounding economic propositions. Once Catherine faces reality, she is able to find happiness. When General Tilney kicks Catherine out of the abbey, she leaves easily, acting inwardly rather than outwardly. Waldo S. Glock argues that this is a display of her genuineness instead of sentimentality. Catherine&#x27;s internal display of sadness showcases how she is not a typical Gothic heroine. To contrast her, Isabella Thorpe acts more accurately as a Gothic heroine. Because of her insincerity, Isabella is more at danger to Gothic disillusionment and sentimental notions.

Austen uses elements of Gothic fiction as a tool to help showcase portions of the marriage plot. This is evident with the use of the cabinet at the abbey. When Henry comes up with a Gothic story to tease Catherine, he makes a joke about the narrator overlooking a cabinet that is crucial to the made-up story as a way to create tension. The act of overlooking a key detail is similar to the manner that marriage plots conceal information to build suspense. Gothic fiction also helps reveal negative aspects of marriage that are not as obvious in a traditional courtship plot.

&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a parody of Gothic fiction. One way that Austen achieves this is through the washing bill that Catherine finds in the abbey. Catherine thinks that there is an elaborate story behind the washing bills, but it leads to no big discovery. Austen reverses the expectation in Gothic fiction for there to be some sort of depth to a story with the washing bills. It also showcases Catherine as a victim of the economy for believing that the washing bill contained a larger story than it actually did. Susan Zlotnick highlights that it is common for Gothic novels to portray women as victims to the economy. Another way that Austen satirizes Gothic fiction is through the cabinet that Catherine finds the washing bills in. The cabinet is from Japan which plays on the Gothic idea of exoticism. It removes the exaggerated exotic feature to the scope of the room instead. In contrast, Robert Irvine, a British critic, argues that the interpretation of the novel as a complete satire of the Gothic genre is problematic even though parts of the book do satirize the Gothic novels popular in the 18th century. &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; makes fun of the silliness of Gothic fiction but also praises it and depends on it to tell the story.

=== Bildungsroman ===
The story begins with the narrator remarking that the heroine is not really a heroine. The narrator describes Catherine as not especially clever, nor a great beauty, and good without being virtuous. When the narrator has anything positive to say about Catherine, it is attached with the adjective &quot;extraordinary.&quot; Austen uses this term ironically since Catherine&#x27;s traits are actually rather ordinary. Another aspect of Catherine that makes her seem not really like a heroine is that she does not have any ambitions outside of being with Henry. Because she actually has ambitions, Isabella appears more like a heroine, but it is those ambitions that turn her into a comedic villain. By creating a protagonist who does not fit the traditional role of a heroine, Austen is satirizing how women were portrayed in contemporary literature.

At the beginning of the novel, Catherine has a hard time interpreting the actions of the people around her, especially Isabella. She does not understand Isabella&#x27;s contradictory actions because she can not understand that there is a double meaning to what Isabella says. This creates confusion for Catherine which forces her to realize that she should not rely solely on others who are negative influences, such as Isabella. Her inability to understand Isabella&#x27;s contradictory actions has to do with Catherine&#x27;s inability to grasp both the fictional and the real world. However, Catherine develops to realize that she should be an independent thinker.

Though Austen encourages her audience to read novels, Catherine must learn to separate life from fiction and to rein in her very active imagination. By focusing only on Gothic novels, Catherine is not able to interact with others properly. On the other hand, it is her novel reading that transforms her into a heroine and causes her to be an active character. Henry also plays a role in Catherine&#x27;s development from his teachings. By the end of the novel, Catherine understands that people are not completely good nor completely bad. For example, she does not see Henry as without any faults. She recognizes that he has a superior attitude towards those he thinks are inferior to him.

=== The value of reading ===
&quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; is a story about reading novels. Laura Jeanne Baudot highlights this point through the discussion of the washing bill Catherine finds in a cabinet at the abbey. Through the washing bill, Austen draws the audience&#x27;s attention to the clothes that the fantasy man who marries Eleanor wears. Austen is forcing the audience to conjure up a cliché image of what the man looks like. In doing so, Austen is reminding the audience of their current act of reading. The body of the man reminds the audience of the physical act of reading a book. It is clear that Austen is defending novel reading. Specifically, Henry Tilney, the hero of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, is an ideal reader. Jodi L. Wyett classifies Henry as an ideal reader because of his knowledge about different texts from different genres. This flips the gender hierarchy by showing men as novel readers instead of women. An early sign that Henry Tilney is the hero instead of John Thorpe is that the former likes to read books while the latter does not. John Thorpe&#x27;s lack of interest in reading novels, specifically in reading Radcliffe&#x27;s novels, makes him boorish. It is hard for Catherine to connect with him because Catherine uses novels as a conversation starter.

=== The importance of time ===
Various scholars such as the French historian Michel Foucault and the British Marxist E.P. Thompson have argued that the 18th century became the &quot;era of the clock&quot; as availability of mass-produced clocks and watches allowed time to be measured more accurately. From these devices creating a new increased emphasis on time management, Thompson called this era the beginning of &quot;time discipline.&quot; As a result of living in the new era of &quot;time discipline,&quot; Austen frequently uses clocks as symbols of General Tilney&#x27;s authority over Northanger Abbey. General Tilney is always checking his watch and is most insistent that the servants as well as his own family observe the clocks to make sure they are on time. Because of the importance of staying on schedule, even when General Tilney is not around, clocks serve as a symbol of his power as Catherine finds herself always checking the time. After arriving at Northanger Abbey, Catherine discovers that everything at the abbey happens on a strict schedule because of General Tilney. This is a marked difference from Catherine&#x27;s lax attitude that she displays in Bath. Catherine compares General Tilney to a clock, as something inhuman and mechanical that operates with no regard to the human body. When Catherine visits the kitchen at Northanger Abbey, she notes that it is equipped with all manner of &quot;modern&quot; cooking equipment and that the cooks work in an efficient manner like soldiers performing a drill. This is a direct reflection of the General&#x27;s wish to have everything ordered.

== Family entertainment ==

According to Austen biographer Claire Tomalin, &quot;there is very little trace of personal allusion in the book, although it is written more in the style of a family entertainment than any of the others&quot;. Joan Aiken writes: &quot;We can guess that &quot;Susan&quot; [the original title of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;], in its first outline, was written very much for family entertainment, addressed to a family audience, like all Jane Austen&#x27;s juvenile works, with their asides to the reader, and absurd dedications; some of the juvenilia, we know, were specifically addressed to her brothers Charles and Frank; all were designed to be circulated and read by a large network of relations.&quot;

==Allusions to other works==
Several Gothic novels and authors are mentioned in the book, including Fanny Burney and &quot;The Monk&quot;. Isabella Thorpe gives Catherine a list of seven books that are commonly referred to as the &quot;Northanger &#x27;horrid&#x27; novels&quot;. These works were later thought to be of Austen&#x27;s own invention until the British writers Montague Summers and Michael Sadleir re-discovered in the 1920s that the novels actually did exist. The list is as follows:
# &quot;Castle of Wolfenbach&quot; (1793) by Eliza Parsons. London: Minerva Press.
# &quot;Clermont&quot; (1798) by Regina Maria Roche. London: Minerva Press.
# &quot;The Mysterious Warning, a German Tale&quot; (1796) by Eliza Parsons. London: Minerva Press.
# &quot;The Necromancer; or, The Tale of the Black Forest&quot; (1794) by &quot;Lawrence Flammenberg&quot; (pseudonym for Karl Friedrich Kahlert; translated by &quot;Peter Teuthold,&quot; pseudonym for Peter Will). London: Minerva Press.
# &quot;The Midnight Bell&quot; (1798) by Francis Lathom. London: H. D. Symonds.
# &quot;The Orphan of the Rhine&quot; (1798) by Eleanor Sleath. London: Minerva Press. Tenille Nowak has noted that critics and editors of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; often suggest that the names Laurentina and St Aubin appearing in the text are misrememberings of character names from &quot;Udolpho&quot;; Nowak observes that due to there being very few copies of &quot;The Orphan of the Rhine&quot; available these critics did not realise that the names actually appear in their exact form in Sleath&#x27;s novel. Nowak observes other instances where Sleath&#x27;s novel is echoed by Austen, particularly in her descriptions of place.
# &quot;Horrid Mysteries&quot; (1796), which is an abridged translation by Peter Will of Carl Grosse&#x27;s &quot;The Genius&quot;. London: Minerva Press. (Marquis de Grosse&#x27;s &quot;The Genius or the Mysterious Adventures of Don Carlos de Grandez&quot; was later translated by Joseph Trapp in 2 volumes. London: Allen and West, No. 15 Paternoster Row.)

All seven of these were republished by the Folio Society in London in the 1960s, and since 2005 Valancourt Books has released new editions of the &quot;horrids&quot;, the seventh and final being released in 2015.

=== The Mysteries of Udolpho ===
The most significant allusion, however, is to Ann Radcliffe&#x27;s &quot;The Mysteries of Udolpho&quot;, as it is the Gothic novel most frequently mentioned within this text. Notably, Jane Austen sold the manuscript of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; to the same firm that published Radcliffe&#x27;s novel in 1794.

This outside text is first mentioned in Chapter Six, when Isabella and Catherine discuss the mystery &quot;behind the black veil&quot;, and further establish their friendship based on their similar interests in novel genre and their plans to continue reading other Gothic novels together. Austen further satirizes the novel through Catherine&#x27;s stay at Northanger Abbey, believing that General Tilney has taken the role of Gothic novel villain.

Austen&#x27;s discussion of &quot;Udolpho&quot; is also used to clearly separate Catherine and the Tilney siblings from John Thorpe, as when Catherine talks about the novel with him, he crudely responds that he &quot;never reads novels&quot; but qualifies his statement by arguing he would only read a novel by Ann Radcliffe, who is the author of &quot;Udolpho&quot;. Here, Austen humorously categorizes &quot;Northanger Abbey&#x27;s&quot; characters into two spheres: those who read novels, and those who do not. When Catherine and Henry Tilney later discuss reading novels, and Henry earnestly responds that he enjoys reading novels, and was especially titillated by &quot;Udolpho&quot;, the match between Catherine and Henry is implied as both smart and fitting.

==Allusions to &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;==

A passage from the novel appears as the preface of Ian McEwan&#x27;s &quot;Atonement&quot;, thus likening the naive mistakes of Austen&#x27;s Catherine Morland to those of his own character Briony Tallis, who is in a similar position: both characters have very over-active imaginations, which lead to misconceptions that cause distress in the lives of people around them. Both treat their own lives like those of heroines in fantastical works of fiction, with Miss Morland likening herself to a character in a Gothic novel and young Briony Tallis writing her own melodramatic stories and plays with central characters such as &quot;spontaneous Arabella&quot; based on herself.

Richard Adams quotes a portion of the novel&#x27;s last sentence for the epigraph to Chapter 50 in his &quot;Watership Down&quot;; the reference to the General is felicitous as the villain in &quot;Watership Down&quot; is also a General.

Jasper Fforde, in his alternate history comic fantasy novel &quot;First Among Sequels&quot;, refers to &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; as being under maintenance and &quot;should be ready on time as long as Catherine stops attempting to have the book &#x27;Gothicized&#x27;.&quot; It appears again as the prize in a reality program, based on the lives of the Bennets from &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;.

===Literature===
HarperCollins hired Scottish crime writer Val McDermid in 2012 to adapt &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; for a modern audience, as a suspenseful teen thriller, the second rewrite in The Austen Project. McDermid said of the project, &quot;At its heart it&#x27;s a teen novel, and a satire – that&#x27;s something which fits really well with contemporary fiction. And you can really feel a shiver of fear moving through it. I will be keeping the suspense – I know how to keep the reader on the edge of their seat. I think Jane Austen builds suspense well in a couple of places, but she squanders it, and she gets to the endgame too quickly. So I will be working on those things.&quot; The novel was published in 2014.

In 2011, Marvel published a graphic novel version of &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;, adapted by Nancy Butler (writer), Janet K. Lee (artist) and Nick Filardi (colour artist). The book, originally is the last of the Jane Austen adaptations made by Marvel, and contrarily to the other books of the series, is the only one to be released only in paperback, not in hardback.

The same year, author Jenni James published a modern teen version entitled &quot;Northanger Alibi&quot;, published by Inkpress, in which the main character&#x27;s obsession for Stephenie Meyer&#x27;s &quot;Twilight saga&quot; replaces Catherine&#x27;s love for Regency gothic novels.

&quot;Newbury Acres: An Amish Retelling of Northanger Abbey&quot; (2017) by Sarah Price.

<text>Bath ( , ) is a city in Somerset, England, known for and named after its Roman-built baths. At the 2021 census, the population was 94,092. Bath is in the valley of the River Avon, west of London and southeast of Bristol. The city became a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1987, and was later added to the transnational World Heritage Site known as the &quot;Great Spa Towns of Europe&quot; in 2021. Bath is also the largest city and settlement in Somerset.

The city became a spa with the Latin name &quot;&quot; (&quot;the waters of Sulis&quot;) 60 AD when the Romans built baths and a temple in the valley of the River Avon, although hot springs were known even before then. Bath Abbey was founded in the 7th century and became a religious centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties of water from the springs, and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath Stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, Pump Room, and the Assembly Rooms, where Beau Nash presided over the city&#x27;s social life from 1705 until his death in 1761.

Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II. Bath became part of the county of Avon in 1974, and, following Avon&#x27;s abolition in 1996, has been the principal centre of Bath and North East Somerset.

Bath has over 6 million yearly visitors, making it one of the ten English cities visited most by overseas tourists. Attractions include the spas, canal boat tours, Royal Crescent, Bath Skyline, Parade Gardens and Royal Victoria Park which hosts carnivals and seasonal events. Shopping areas include SouthGate shopping centre, the Corridor arcade and artisan shops at Walcot, Milsom, Stall and York Streets. There are theatres, including the Theatre Royal, as well as several museums including the Museum of Bath Architecture, the Victoria Art Gallery, the Museum of East Asian Art, the Herschel Museum of Astronomy, Fashion Museum, and the Holburne Museum. The city has two universities – the University of Bath and Bath Spa University – with Bath College providing further education. Sporting clubs from the city include Bath Rugby and Bath City.

==History==
===Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages===
The hills in the locality such as Bathampton Down saw human activity from the Mesolithic period. Several Bronze Age round barrows were opened by John Skinner in the 18th century. A long barrow site believed to be from the Early Bronze Age Beaker people was flattened to make way for RAF Charmy Down. Solsbury Hill overlooking the current city was an Iron Age hill fort and the adjacent Bathampton Camp may also have been one.

===Roman baths and town===

Archaeological evidence shows that the site of the Roman baths&#x27; main spring may have been treated as a shrine by the Britons, and was dedicated to the goddess Sulis, whom the Romans identified with Minerva; the name Sulis continued to be used after the Roman invasion, appearing in the town&#x27;s Roman name, &quot;&quot; (literally, &quot;the waters of Sulis&quot;). Messages to her scratched onto metal, known as curse tablets, have been recovered from the sacred spring by archaeologists. The tablets were written in Latin, and laid curses on personal enemies. For example, if a citizen had his clothes stolen at the baths, he might write a curse against the suspects on a tablet to be read by the goddess.

A temple was constructed in AD 60–70, and a bathing complex was built up over the next 300 years. Engineers drove oak piles into the mud to provide a stable foundation, and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century, the spring was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted structure that housed the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (warm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath).

The town was later given defensive walls, probably in the 3rd century. After the failure of Roman authority in the first decade of the 5th century, the baths fell into disrepair and were eventually lost as a result of rising water levels and silting.

In March 2012, a hoard of 30,000 silver Roman coins, one of the largest discovered in Britain, was unearthed in an archaeological dig. The coins, believed to date from the 3rd century, were found about from the Roman baths.

===Post-Roman and medieval===
Bath may have been the site of the Battle of Badon ( 500 AD), in which Arthur, the hero of later legends, is said to have defeated the Anglo-Saxons. The town was captured by the West Saxons in 577 after the Battle of Deorham; the Anglo-Saxon poem &quot;The Ruin&quot; may describe the appearance of the Roman site about this time. A monastery was founded at an early date – reputedly by Saint David although more probably in 675 by Osric, King of the Hwicce, perhaps using the walled area as its precinct. Nennius, a 9th-century historian, mentions a &quot;Hot Lake&quot; in the land of the Hwicce along the River Severn, and adds &quot;It is surrounded by a wall, made of brick and stone, and men may go there to bathe at any time, and every man can have the kind of bath he likes. If he wants, it will be a cold bath; and if he wants a hot bath, it will be hot&quot;. Bede described hot baths in the geographical introduction to the &quot;Ecclesiastical History&quot; in terms very similar to those of Nennius. King Offa of Mercia gained control of the monastery in 781 and rebuilt the church, which was dedicated to St. Peter.

According to the Victorian churchman Edward Churton, during the Anglo-Saxon era Bath was known as &quot;Acemannesceastre&quot; (&#x27;Akemanchester&#x27;), or &#x27;aching men&#x27;s city&#x27;, on account of the reputation these springs had for healing the sick.
By the 9th century, the old Roman street pattern was lost and Bath was a royal possession. King Alfred laid out the town afresh, leaving its south-eastern quadrant as the abbey precinct. In the Burghal Hidage, Bath is recorded as a burh (borough) and is described as having walls of and was allocated 1000 men for defence. During the reign of Edward the Elder coins were minted in Bath based on a design from the Winchester mint but with &#x27;BAD&#x27; on the obverse relating to the Anglo-Saxon name for the town, Baðum, Baðan or Baðon, meaning &quot;at the baths&quot;, and this was the source of the present name. Edgar of England was crowned king of England in Bath Abbey in 973, in a ceremony that formed the basis of all future English coronations.

William Rufus granted the town, abbey and mint to a royal physician, John of Tours, who became Bishop of Wells and Abbot of Bath, following the sacking of the town during the Rebellion of 1088. It was papal policy for bishops to move to more urban seats, and John of Tours translated his own from Wells to Bath. The bishop planned and began a much larger church as his cathedral, to which was attached a priory, with the bishop&#x27;s palace beside it. New baths were built around the three springs. Later bishops returned the episcopal seat to Wells while retaining the name Bath in the title, Bishop of Bath and Wells. St John&#x27;s Hospital was founded around 1180 by Bishop Reginald Fitz Jocelin and is among the oldest almshouses in England. The &#x27;hospital of the baths&#x27; was built beside the hot springs of the Cross Bath, for their health-giving properties and to provide shelter for the poor infirm.

Administrative systems fell within the hundreds. The Bath Hundred had various names including the Hundred of Le Buri. The Bath Foreign Hundred or Forinsecum covered the area outside the city and was later combined into the Bath Forum Hundred. Wealthy merchants had no status within the hundred courts and formed guilds to gain influence. They built the first guildhall probably in the 13th century. Around 1200, the first mayor was appointed.

===Early modern===
By the 15th century, Bath&#x27;s abbey church was dilapidated and Oliver King, Bishop of Bath and Wells, decided to rebuild it on a smaller scale in 1500. The new church was completed just a few years before Bath Priory was dissolved in 1539 by Henry VIII. The abbey church became derelict before being restored as the city&#x27;s parish church in the Elizabethan era, when the city experienced a revival as a spa. The baths were improved and the city began to attract the aristocracy. A Royal charter granted by Queen Elizabeth I in 1590 confirmed city status. James Montagu, Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1608, spent considerable sums in restoring Bath Abbey and actively supported the Baths themselves, aware that the &#x27;towne liveth wholly by them&#x27;. In 1613, perhaps at his behest, Queen Anne visited the town to take the waters: the Queen&#x27;s Bath was named after her. The cue for the visit may have been the completion of the restoration work to Bath Abbey, the last instalment of which had been paid for two years previously. Anne of Denmark came to Bath in 1613 and 1615. By the beginning of the English Civil War, the city was a first-class resort. However, it lost much of this trade in 1642; with the outbreak of war, fiddlers, &quot;ladies who are there&quot;, and ale-house guides, lost their customers.

The city was initially garrisoned for Charles I. Seven thousand pounds was spent on fortifications, but on the appearance of parliamentary forces the gates were thrown open and the city surrendered. It became a significant post for the Western Association army under William Waller. Bath was retaken by the royalists in July 1643 following the Battle of Lansdowne and occupied for two years until 1645. The city was spared widespread destruction of property, overcrowding, bubonic plague, or starvation of its inhabitants, etc, unlike nearby Bristol and Gloucester, and it had good water piped in from its surrounding hills. Still, soldiers who were billeted in private houses contributed to disorder and vandalism, though this never caused the general destruction and plundering seen in Marlborough and other towns. Bath remained a health resort, often for wounded soldiers, its markets continued open and well-regulated, and its shopkeepers and craftsmen continued busy. Nevertheless, council spending, rents and grants all decreased and the finances of the Bath City Council were seriously affected. 

Normality to the city quickly recovered after the war when the city council achieved a healthy budget surplus. Thomas Guidott, a student of chemistry and medicine at Wadham College, Oxford, set up a practice in the city in 1668. He was interested in the curative properties of the waters, and he wrote &quot;A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water&quot; in 1676. It brought the health-giving properties of the hot mineral waters to the attention of the country, and the aristocracy arrived to partake in them.


Several areas of the city were developed in the Stuart period, and more building took place during Georgian times in response to the increasing number of visitors who required accommodation. Architects John Wood the Elder and his son laid out the new quarters in streets and squares, the identical façades of which gave an impression of palatial scale and classical decorum. Much of the creamy gold Bath stone, a type of limestone used for construction in the city, was obtained from the Combe Down and Bathampton Down Mines owned by Ralph Allen (1694–1764). Allen, to advertise the quality of his quarried limestone, commissioned the elder John Wood to build a country house on his Prior Park estate between the city and the mines. Allen was responsible for improving and expanding the postal service in western England, for which he held the contract for more than forty years. Although not fond of politics, Allen was a civic-minded man and a member of Bath Corporation for many years. He was elected mayor for a single term in 1742.

In the early 18th century, Bath acquired its first purpose-built theatre, the Old Orchard Street Theatre. It was rebuilt as the Theatre Royal, along with the Grand Pump Room attached to the Roman Baths and assembly rooms. Master of ceremonies Beau Nash, who presided over the city&#x27;s social life from 1704 until his death in 1761, drew up a code of behaviour for public entertainments. Bath had become perhaps the most fashionable of the rapidly developing British spa towns, attracting many notable visitors such as the wealthy London bookseller Andrew Millar and his wife, who both made long visits. In 1816, it was described as &quot;a seat of amusement and dissipation&quot;, where &quot;scenes of extravagance in this receptacle of the wealthy and the idle, the weak and designing&quot; were habitual.
===Late modern===
The population of the city was 40,020 at the 1801 census, making it one of the largest cities in Britain. William Thomas Beckford bought a house in Lansdown Crescent in 1822, and subsequently two adjacent houses to form his residence. Having acquired all the land between his home and the top of Lansdown Hill, he created a garden more than in length and built Beckford&#x27;s Tower at the top.

Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia spent four years in exile, from 1936 to 1940, at Fairfield House in Bath. During World War II, between the evening of 25 April and the early morning of 27 April 1942, Bath suffered three air raids in reprisal for RAF raids on the German cities of Lübeck and Rostock, part of the Luftwaffe campaign popularly known as the Baedeker Blitz. During the Bath Blitz, more than 400 people were killed, and more than 19,000 buildings damaged or destroyed.

Houses in Royal Crescent, Circus and Paragon were burnt out along with the Assembly Rooms. A high explosive bomb landed on the east side of Queen Square, resulting in houses on the south side being damaged and the Francis Hotel losing of its frontage. The buildings have all been restored although there are still signs of the bombing.

A postwar review of inadequate housing led to the clearance and redevelopment of areas of the city in a postwar style, often at variance with the local Georgian style. In the 1950s, the nearby villages of Combe Down, Twerton and Weston were incorporated into the city to enable the development of housing, much of it council housing. In 1965, town planner Colin Buchanan published &quot;Bath: A Planning and Transport Study&quot;, which to a large degree sought to better accommodate the motor car, including the idea of a traffic tunnel underneath the centre of Bath. Though criticised by conservationists, some parts of the plan were implemented.

In the 1970s and 1980s, it was recognised that conservation of historic buildings was inadequate, leading to more care and reuse of buildings and open spaces. In 1987, the city was selected by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site, recognising its international cultural significance.

Between 1991 and 2000, Bath was the scene of a series of rapes committed by an unidentified man dubbed the &quot;Batman rapist&quot;. The attacker remains at large and is the subject of Britain&#x27;s longest-running serial rape investigation. He is said to have a tights fetish, have a scar below his bottom lip and resides in the Bath area or knows it very well. He has also been linked to the unsolved murder of Melanie Hall, which occurred in the city in 1996. Although the offender&#x27;s DNA is known and several thousand men in Bath were DNA tested, the attacker continues to evade police.

Since 2000, major developments have included the Thermae Bath Spa, the SouthGate shopping centre, the residential Western Riverside project on the Stothert &amp; Pitt factory site, and the riverside Bath Quays office and business development. In 2021, Bath become part of a second UNESCO World Heritage Site, a group of spa towns across Europe known as the &quot;Great Spas of Europe&quot;. This makes it one of the only places to be formally recognised twice as a World Heritage site.

==Government==

Since 1996, the city has had a single tier of local government — Bath and North East Somerset Council.

===Historical development===
Bath had long been an ancient borough, having that status since 878 when it became a royal borough (burh) of Alfred the Great, and was reformed into a municipal borough in 1835. It has formed part of the county of Somerset since 878, when ceded to Wessex, having previously been in Mercia (the River Avon had acted as the border between the two kingdoms since 628). However, Bath was made a county borough in 1889, independent of the newly created administrative county and Somerset County Council. Bath became part of Avon when the non-metropolitan county was created in 1974, resulting in its abolition as a county borough, and instead became a non-metropolitan district with borough status.

With the abolition of Avon in 1996, the non-metropolitan district and borough were abolished too, and Bath has since been part of the unitary authority district of Bath and North East Somerset (B&amp;NES). The unitary district included also the Wansdyke district and therefore includes a wider area than the city (the &#x27;North East Somerset&#x27; element) including Keynsham which is home to many of the council&#x27;s offices, though the council meets at the Guildhall in Bath.

Bath was returned to the ceremonial county of Somerset in 1996, though as B&amp;NES is a unitary authority, it is not part of the area covered by Somerset County Council.

===Charter trustees===
Bath City Council was abolished in 1996, along with the district of Bath, and there is no longer a parish council for the city. The City of Bath&#x27;s ceremonial functions, including its formal status as a city, its twinning arrangements, the mayoralty of Bath – which can be traced back to 1230 – and control of the city&#x27;s coat of arms, are maintained by the charter trustees of the City of Bath.

The councillors elected by the electoral wards that cover Bath (see below) are the trustees, and they elect one of their number as their chair and mayor. The mayor holds office for one municipal year and in modern times the mayor begins their term in office on the first Saturday in June, at a ceremony at Bath Abbey with a civic procession from and to the Guildhall. The 794th mayor, who began her office on 6 May 2021, is June Player. A deputy mayor is also elected.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms includes a depiction of the city wall, and two silver stripes representing the River Avon and the hot springs. The sword of St. Paul is a link to Bath Abbey. The supporters, a lion and a bear, stand on a bed of acorns, a link to Bladud, the subject of the Legend of Bath. The knight&#x27;s helmet indicates a municipality and the crown is that of King Edgar (referencing his coronation at the Abbey). A mural crown, indicating a city, is alternatively used instead of the helmet and Edgar&#x27;s crown.

The Arms bear the motto &quot;Aqvae Svlis&quot;, the Roman name for Bath in Latin script; although not on the Arms, the motto &quot;Floreat Bathon&quot; is sometimes used (&quot;may Bath flourish&quot; in Latin).

===Bath Area Forum===
Bath and North East Somerset Council has established the Bath City Forum, comprising B&amp;NES councillors representing wards in Bath and up to 13 co-opted members drawn from the communities of the city. The first meeting of the Forum was held on 13 October 2015, at the Guildhall, where the first chair and vice-chair were elected. In 2021, this was re-launched as the Bath Area Forum.

===Parliamentary elections===

Bath is one of the oldest extant parliamentary constituencies in the United Kingdom, being in continuous existence since the Model Parliament of 1295. Before the Reform Act 1832, Bath elected two members to the unreformed House of Commons, as an ancient parliamentary borough. From 1832 until 1918 it elected two MPs and then was reduced to one.

Historically the constituency covered only the city of Bath; however, it was enlarged into some outlying areas between 1997 and 2010. The constituency since 2010 once again covers exactly the city of Bath and is currently represented by Liberal Democrat Wera Hobhouse who beat Conservative Ben Howlett at the 2017 general election and retained her seat at the 2019 general election. Howlett had replaced the retiring Liberal Democrat Don Foster at the 2015 general election. Foster&#x27;s election was a notable result of the 1992 general election, as Chris Patten, the previous Member (and Cabinet Minister) played a major part, as Chairman of the Conservative Party, in re-electing the government of John Major, but failed to defend his marginal seat.

===Electoral wards===
The fifteen electoral wards of Bath are: Bathwick, Combe Down, Kingsmead, Lambridge, Lansdown, Moorlands, Newbridge, Odd Down, Oldfield Park, Southdown, Twerton, Walcot, Westmoreland, Weston and Widcombe &amp; Lyncombe. These wards are co-extensive with the city, except that Newbridge includes also two parishes beyond the city boundary.

These wards return a total of 28 councillors to Bath and North East Somerset Council; all except two wards return two councillors (Moorlands and Oldfield Park return one each). The most recent elections were held on 4 May 2023 and all wards returned Liberal Democrats except for Lambridge and Westmoreland which returned Green Party and independent councillors respectively.

Boundary changes enacted from 2 May 2019 included the abolition of Abbey ward, the merger of Lyncombe and Widcombe wards, the creation of Moorlands ward, and the replacement of Oldfield with Oldfield Park, as well as considerable changes to boundaries affecting all wards.

==Geography and environment==
===Physical geography===
Bath is in the Avon Valley and is surrounded by limestone hills as it is near the southern edge of the Cotswolds, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, and the Mendip Hills rise around south of the city. The hills that surround and make up the city have a maximum altitude of on the Lansdown plateau. Bath has an area of .
The floodplain of the Avon has an altitude of about above sea level, although the city centre is at an elevation of around above sea level. The river, once an unnavigable series of braided streams broken up by swamps and ponds, has been managed by weirs into a single channel. Periodic flooding, which shortened the life of many buildings in the lowest part of the city, was normal until major flood control works were completed in the 1970s. Kensington Meadows is an area of mixed woodland and open meadow next to the river which has been designated as a local nature reserve.

Water bubbling up from the ground as geothermal springs originates as rain on the Mendip Hills. The rain percolates through limestone aquifers to a depth of between where geothermal energy raises the water&#x27;s temperature to between 64 and 96 °C (approximately 147–205 °F). Under pressure, the heated water rises to the surface along fissures and faults in the limestone. Hot water at a temperature of rises here at the rate of daily, from the Pennyquick geological fault.

In 1983, a new spa-water bore-hole was sunk, providing a clean and safe supply for drinking in the Pump Room. There is no universal definition to distinguish a hot spring from a geothermal spring, although, by several definitions, the Bath springs can be considered the only hot springs in the UK. Three of the springs feed the thermal baths.

===Climate===

Along with the rest of South West England, Bath has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is approximately . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme than most of the United Kingdom because of the adjacent sea temperatures. The summer months of July and August are the warmest, with mean daily maxima of approximately . In winter, mean minimum temperatures of are common. In the summer, the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England bringing fair weather; however, convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the number of hours of sunshine. Annual sunshine rates are slightly less than the regional average of 1,600 hours.

In December 1998 there were 20 days without sun recorded at Yeovilton. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection. In summer, a large proportion of the rainfall is caused by sun heating the ground, leading to convection and to showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is around . About 8–15 days of snowfall is typical. November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, and June to August have the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the southwest.
=== Green belt ===

Bath is fully enclosed by green belt as a part of a wider environmental and planning policy first designated in the late 1950s, and this extends into much of the surrounding district and beyond, helping to maintain local green space, prevent further urban sprawl and unplanned expansion towards Bristol and Bradford-on-Avon, as well as protecting smaller villages in between. Suburbs of the city bordering the green belt include Batheaston, Bathford, Bathampton, the University of Bath campus, Ensleigh, Twerton, Upper Weston, Odd Down, and Combe Down.

Parts of the Cotswolds AONB southern extent overlap the green belt north of the city, with other nearby landscape features and facilities within the green belt including the River Avon, Kennet and Avon Canal, Bath Racecourse, Bath Golf Club, Bathampton Down, Bathampton Meadow Nature Reserve, Bristol and Bath Railway Path, the Cotswold Way, Limestone Link route, Pennyquick Park, Little Solsbury Hill, and Primrose Hill.

==Demography==
===District===

According to the 2021 census, Bath, together with North East Somerset, which includes areas around Bath as far as the Chew Valley, had a population of 193,400 (up 9.9% from 2011).

The district is largely non-religious and Christian at 47.9% and 42.2%, respectively, with no other religion reaching more than 1%. These figures generally compare with the national averages, though the non-religious, at 47.9%, are significantly more prevalent than the national 36.7%. 84.5% of residents rated their health as good or very good, higher than the national level (81.7%). Nationally, 17.7% of people identified as being disabled; in Bath it is 16.2%.

The table below compares the unitary authority district as a whole (including the city) and South West England and contrasts changes since the 2011 census. More detailed updated information, including figures specifically for the city of Bath, appear to be unavailable.


===City===

The 2011 census recorded a population of 94,782 for the Bath built-up area and 88,859 for the city, with the latter exactly corresponding to the boundaries of the parliament constituency. The Bath built-up area extends slightly beyond the boundaries of the city itself, taking in areas to the northeast such as Bathampton and Bathford. The 2001 census figure for the city was 83,992. By 2019, the population was estimated at 90,000.

An inhabitant of Bath is known as a Bathonian.

The table below compares the city of Bath with the unitary authority district as a whole (including the city) and South West England.

==Economy==

===Industry===
Bath once had an important manufacturing sector, particularly in crane manufacture, furniture manufacture, printing, brass foundries, quarries, dye works and Plasticine manufacture, as well as many mills. Significant Bath companies included Stothert &amp; Pitt, Bath Cabinet Makers and Bath &amp; Portland Stone.

During and after World War II Bath was a major location of Ministry of Defence offices, with three major sites on the outskirts of Bath (Ensleigh, Foxhill and Warminster Road) and a number of smaller central offices including the Empire Hotel. After the Cold War staff numbers declined, and from 2010 to 2013 about 2,600 remaining staff were moved to MoD Abbey Wood in Bristol. In 2013 the three major sites were sold for the development of over 1,000 new houses.

Nowadays, manufacturing is in decline, but the city boasts strong software, publishing and service-oriented industries, and the international manufacturing company Rotork has its headquarters in the city. The city&#x27;s attraction to tourists has also led to a significant number of jobs in tourism-related industries. Important economic sectors in Bath include education and health (30,000 jobs), retail, tourism and leisure (14,000 jobs) and business and professional services (10,000 jobs).

Major employers are the National Health Service, Bath Spa University, the University of Bath, and Bath and North East Somerset Council. Growing employment sectors include information and communication technologies and creative and cultural industries where Bath is one of the recognised national centres for publishing, with the magazine and digital publisher Future plc employing around 650 people. Others include Buro Happold (400) and IPL Information Processing Limited (250). The city boasts over 400 retail shops, half of which are run by independent specialist retailers, and around 100 restaurants and cafes primarily supported by tourism.

===Tourism===

One of Bath&#x27;s principal industries is tourism, with annually more than one million staying visitors and 3.8 million day visitors. The visits mainly fall into the categories of heritage tourism and cultural tourism, aided by the city&#x27;s selection in 1987 as a World Heritage Site in recognition of its international cultural importance. All significant stages of the history of England are represented within the city, from the Roman Baths (including their significant Celtic presence), to Bath Abbey and the Royal Crescent, to the more recent Thermae Bath Spa.

The size of the tourist industry is reflected in the almost 300 places of accommodation – including more than 80 hotels, two of which have &#x27;five-star&#x27; ratings, over 180 bed and breakfasts – many of which are located in Georgian buildings, and two campsites located on the western edge of the city. The city also has about 100 restaurants and a similar number of pubs and bars.

Several companies offer open top bus tours around the city, as well as tours on foot and on the river. Since the opening of Thermae Bath Spa in 2006, the city has attempted to recapture its historical position as the only town or city in the United Kingdom offering visitors the opportunity to bathe in naturally heated spring waters.

In the 2010 Google Street View Best Streets Awards, the Royal Crescent took second place in the &quot;Britain&#x27;s Most Picturesque Street&quot; award, first place being given to The Shambles in York. Milsom Street was also awarded &quot;Britain&#x27;s Best Fashion Street&quot; in the 11,000-strong vote.

==Architecture==

There are many Roman archaeological sites throughout the central area of the city. The baths themselves are about below the present city street level. Around the hot springs, Roman foundations, pillar bases, and baths can still be seen; however, all the stonework above the level of the baths is from more recent periods.

Bath Abbey was a Norman church built on earlier foundations. The present building dates from the early 16th century and shows a late Perpendicular style with flying buttresses and crocketed pinnacles decorating a crenellated and pierced parapet. The choir and transepts have a fan vault by Robert and William Vertue. A matching vault was added to the nave in the 19th century. The building is lit by 52 windows.
Most buildings in Bath are made from the local, golden-coloured Bath stone, and many date from the 18th and 19th century. The dominant style of architecture in Central Bath is Georgian; this style evolved from the Palladian revival style that became popular in the early 18th century. Many of the prominent architects of the day were employed in the development of the city. The original purpose of much of Bath&#x27;s architecture is concealed by the honey-coloured classical façades; in an era before the advent of the luxury hotel, these apparently elegant residences were frequently purpose-built lodging houses, where visitors could hire a room, a floor, or (according to their means) an entire house for the duration of their visit, and be waited on by the house&#x27;s communal servants. The masons Reeves of Bath were prominent in the city from the 1770s to 1860s.

The Circus consists of three long, curved terraces designed by the elder John Wood to form a circular space or theatre intended for civic functions and games. The games give a clue to the design, the inspiration behind which was the Colosseum in Rome. Like the Colosseum, the three façades have a different order of architecture on each floor: Doric on the ground level, then Ionic on the piano nobile, and finishing with Corinthian on the upper floor, the style of the building thus becoming progressively more ornate as it rises. Wood never lived to see his unique example of town planning completed as he died five days after personally laying the foundation stone on 18 May 1754.

The most spectacular of Bath&#x27;s terraces is the Royal Crescent, built between 1767 and 1774 and designed by the younger John Wood. Wood designed the great curved façade of what appears to be about 30 houses with Ionic columns on a rusticated ground floor, but that was the extent of his input: each purchaser bought a certain length of the façade, and then employed their own architect to build a house to their own specifications behind it; hence what appears to be two houses is in some cases just one. This system of town planning is betrayed at the rear of the crescent: while the front is completely uniform and symmetrical, the rear is a mixture of differing roof heights, juxtapositions and fenestration. The &quot;Queen Anne fronts and Mary-Anne backs&quot; architecture occurs repeatedly in Bath and was designed to keep hired women at the back of the house. Other fine terraces elsewhere in the city include Lansdown Crescent and Somerset Place on the northern hill.

Around 1770 the neoclassical architect Robert Adam designed Pulteney Bridge, using as the prototype for the three-arched bridge spanning the Avon an original, but unused, design by Andrea Palladio for the Rialto Bridge in Venice. Thus, Pulteney Bridge became not just a means of crossing the river, but also a shopping arcade. Along with the Rialto Bridge and the Ponte Vecchio in Florence, which it resembles, it is one of the very few surviving bridges in Europe to serve this dual purpose. It has been substantially altered since it was built. The bridge was named after Frances and William Pulteney, the owners of the Bathwick estate for which the bridge provided a link to the rest of Bath. 
The Georgian streets in the vicinity of the river tended to be built high above the original ground level to avoid flooding, with the carriageways supported on vaults extending in front of the houses. This can be seen in the multi-storey cellars around Laura Place south of Pulteney Bridge, in the colonnades below Grand Parade, and in the grated coal holes in the pavement of North Parade. In some parts of the city, such as George Street, and London Road near Cleveland Bridge, the developers of the opposite side of the road did not match this pattern, leaving raised pavements with the ends of the vaults exposed to a lower street below.

The heart of the Georgian city was the Pump Room, which, together with its associated Lower Assembly Rooms, was designed by Thomas Baldwin, a local builder responsible for many other buildings in the city, including the terraces in Argyle Street and the Guildhall. Baldwin rose rapidly, becoming a leader in Bath&#x27;s architectural history.

In 1776, he was made the chief City Surveyor, and Bath City Architect. Great Pulteney Street, where he eventually lived, is another of his works: this wide boulevard, constructed around 1789 and over long and wide, is lined on both sides by Georgian terraces.

In the 1960s and early 1970s some parts of Bath were unsympathetically redeveloped, resulting in the loss of some 18th- and 19th-century buildings. This process was largely halted by a popular campaign which drew strength from the publication of Adam Fergusson&#x27;s &quot;The Sack of Bath&quot;. Controversy has revived periodically, most recently with the demolition of the 1930s Churchill House, a neo-Georgian municipal building originally housing the Electricity Board, to make way for a new bus station. This is part of the Southgate redevelopment in which an ill-favoured 1960s shopping precinct, bus station and multi-storey car park were demolished and replaced by a new area of neo-Georgian shopping streets.

As a result of this and other changes, notably plans for abandoned industrial land along the Avon, the city&#x27;s status as a World Heritage Site was reviewed by UNESCO in 2009. The decision was made to let Bath keep its status, but UNESCO asked to be consulted on future phases of the Riverside development, saying that the density and volume of buildings in the second and third phases of the development need to be reconsidered. It also demanded Bath do more to attract world-class architecture in new developments.

In 2021, Bath received its second UNESCO World Heritage inscription, becoming part of a group of 11 spa towns across seven countries that were listed by UNESCO as the &quot;Great Spas of Europe&quot;.

==Culture==

Bath became the centre of fashionable life in England during the 18th century when its Old Orchard Street Theatre and architectural developments such as Lansdown Crescent, the Royal Crescent, The Circus, and Pulteney Bridge were built.

Bath&#x27;s five theatres – Theatre Royal, Ustinov Studio, the Egg, the Rondo Theatre, and the Mission Theatre – attract internationally renowned companies and directors and an annual season by Sir Peter Hall. The city has a long-standing musical tradition; Bath Abbey, home to the Klais Organ and the largest concert venue in the city, stages about 20 concerts and 26 organ recitals each year. Another concert venue, the 1,600-seat art deco The Forum, originated as a cinema. The city holds the annual Bath International Music Festival and Mozartfest, the annual Bath Literature Festival (and its counterpart for children), the Bath Film Festival, the Bath Digital Festival. the Bath Fringe Festival, the Bath Beer Festival and the Bath Chilli Festival. The Bach Festivals occur at two and a half-year intervals. An annual Bard of Bath competition aims to find the best poet, singer or storyteller.

The city is home to the Victoria Art Gallery, the Museum of East Asian Art, and Holburne Museum, numerous commercial art galleries and antique shops, as well as a number of other museums, among them Bath Postal Museum, the Fashion Museum, the Jane Austen Centre, the Herschel Museum of Astronomy and the Roman Baths. The Bath Royal Literary and Scientific Institution (BRLSI) in Queen Square was founded in 1824 from the Society for the encouragement of Agriculture, Planting, Manufactures, Commerce and the Fine Arts founded in 1777. In September 1864, BRLSI hosted the 34th annual meeting of the British Science Association, which was attended by explorers David Livingstone, Sir Richard Francis Burton, and John Hanning Speke. The history of the city is displayed at the Museum of Bath Architecture, which is housed in a building built in 1765 as the Trinity Presbyterian Church. It was also known as the Countess of Huntingdon&#x27;s Chapel, as she lived in the attached house from 1707 to 1791.

===The arts===

During the 18th century Thomas Gainsborough and Sir Thomas Lawrence lived and worked in Bath. John Maggs, a painter best known for coaching scenes, was born and lived in Bath with his artistic family.

Jane Austen lived there from 1801 with her father, mother and sister Cassandra, and the family resided at four different addresses until 1806. Jane Austen never liked the city, and wrote to Cassandra, &quot;It will be two years tomorrow since we left Bath for Clifton, with what happy feelings of escape.&quot; Bath has honoured her name with the Jane Austen Centre and a city walk. Austen&#x27;s &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot; and &quot;Persuasion&quot; are set in the city and describe taking the waters, social life, and music recitals.

William Friese-Greene experimented with celluloid and motion pictures in his studio in the 1870s, developing some of the earliest movie camera technology. He is credited as being one of the inventors of cinematography.

Satirist and political journalist William Hone was born in Bath in 1780.

Taking the waters is described in Charles Dickens&#x27; novel &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; in which Pickwick&#x27;s servant, Sam Weller, comments that the water has &quot;a very strong flavour o&#x27; warm flat irons&quot;. The Royal Crescent is the venue for a chase between two characters, Dowler and Winkle. Moyra Caldecott&#x27;s novel &quot;The Waters of Sul&quot; is set in Roman Bath in AD 72, and &quot;The Regency Detective&quot;, by David Lassman and Terence James, revolves around the exploits of Jack Swann investigating deaths in the city during the early 19th century. Richard Brinsley Sheridan&#x27;s play &quot;The Rivals&quot; takes place in the city, as does Roald Dahl&#x27;s chilling short story, &quot;The Landlady&quot;.

Many films and television programmes have been filmed using its architecture as the backdrop, including the 2004 film of Thackeray&#x27;s &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;The Duchess&quot; (2008), &quot;The Elusive Pimpernel&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1953). In 2012, Pulteney Weir was used as a replacement location during post production of the film adaptation of &quot;Les Misérables&quot;. Stunt shots were filmed in October 2012 after footage acquired during the main filming period was found to have errors. The ITV police drama McDonald &amp; Dodds is set and mostly filmed in Bath using many of the city&#x27;s famous sites.

In August 2003 The Three Tenors sang at a concert to mark the opening of the Thermae Bath Spa, a new hot water spa in the city centre, but delays to the project meant the spa actually opened three years later on 7 August 2006. In 2008, 104 decorated pigs were displayed around the city in a public art event called &quot;King Bladud&#x27;s Pigs in Bath&quot;. It celebrated the city, its origins and artists. Decorated pig sculptures were displayed throughout the summer and were auctioned to raise funds for Two Tunnels Greenway.

===Parks===

Royal Victoria Park, a short walk from the city centre, was opened in 1830 by the 11-year-old Princess Victoria, and was the first park to carry her name. The public park is overlooked by the Royal Crescent and covers . It has a skatepark, tennis courts, a bowling green, a putting green and a 12- and 18-hole golf course, a pond, open-air concerts, an annual travelling funfair at Easter, and a children&#x27;s play area. Much of its area is lawn; a notable feature is a ha-ha that segregates it from the Royal Crescent while giving the impression from the Crescent of uninterrupted grassland across the park to Royal Avenue. It has a &quot;Green Flag Award&quot;, the national standard for parks and green spaces in England and Wales, and is registered by English Heritage as of National Historic Importance. The botanical gardens were formed in 1887 and contain one of the finest collections of plants on limestone in the West Country.

A replica Roman Temple was built at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley in 1924, and, following the exhibition, was dismantled and rebuilt in Victoria Park in Bath. In 1987, the gardens were extended to include the Great Dell, a disused quarry with a collection of conifers.

Other parks include Alexandra Park on a hill overlooking the city; Parade Gardens, along the river near the abbey in the city centre; Sydney Gardens, an 18th-century pleasure garden; Henrietta Park; Hedgemead Park; and Alice Park. Jane Austen wrote &quot;It would be pleasant to be near the Sydney Gardens. We could go into the Labyrinth every day.&quot; Alexandra, Alice and Henrietta parks were built into the growing city among the housing developments. Linear Park is built on the old Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway line, and connects with the Two Tunnels Greenway which contains the longest cycling and walking tunnel in the UK. Cleveland Pools were built around 1815 close to the River Avon, now the oldest surviving public outdoor lido in England. Restoration was completed in 2023, after a 20 year fund-raising campaign, with the lido opening for the first time in 40 years on 10 September.

===Queen Victoria===
Victoria Art Gallery and Royal Victoria Park are named after Queen Victoria, who wrote in her journal in 1837, &quot;The people are really too kind to me.&quot; This feeling seemed to have been reciprocated by the people of Bath: &quot;Lord James O&#x27;Brien brought a drawing of the intended pillar which the people of Bath are so kind as to erect in commemoration of my 18th birthday.&quot;

===Food===

Several foods have an association with the city. &quot;Sally Lunn buns&quot; (a type of teacake) have long been baked in Bath. They were first mentioned by name in verses printed in the Bath Chronicle, in 1772. At that time they were eaten hot at public breakfasts in Spring Gardens. They can be eaten with sweet or savoury toppings and are sometimes confused with &quot;Bath buns&quot;, which are smaller, round, very sweet and very rich. They were associated with the city following The Great Exhibition. Bath buns were originally topped with crushed comfits created by dipping caraway seeds repeatedly in boiling sugar; but today seeds are added to a &#x27;London Bath Bun&#x27; (a reference to the bun&#x27;s promotion and sale at the Great Exhibition). The seeds may be replaced by crushed sugar granules or &#x27;nibs&#x27;.

Bath has lent its name to one other distinctive recipe – &quot;Bath Olivers&quot; – a dry baked biscuit invented by Dr William Oliver, physician to the Mineral Water Hospital in 1740. Oliver was an anti-obesity campaigner and author of a &quot;Practical Essay on the Use and Abuse of warm Bathing in Gluty Cases&quot;. In more recent years, Oliver&#x27;s efforts have been traduced by the introduction of a version of the biscuit with a plain chocolate coating. Bath chaps, the salted and smoked cheek and jawbones of the pig, takes its name from the city and is available from a stall in the daily covered market. Bath Ales brewery is located in Warmley and Abbey Ales are brewed in the city.

===Twinning===
Bath is twinned with four other cities in Europe. Twinning is the responsibility of the Charter Trustees and each twinning arrangement is managed by a Twinning Association.

There is also a historic connection with Manly, New South Wales, Australia, which is referred to as a sister city; a partnership arrangement with Beppu, Ōita Prefecture, Japan; and a friendship agreement with Oleksandriia, Kirovohrad Oblast, Ukraine.

====Formal twinning====
* Aix-en-Provence, France
* Alkmaar, Netherlands
* Braunschweig, Germany
* Kaposvár, Hungary

==Education==
Bath has two universities, the University of Bath and Bath Spa University. Established in 1966, the University of Bath was named University of the Year by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; in 2011. It offers programs in politics, languages, the physical sciences, engineering, mathematics, architecture, management and technology.

Bath Spa University was first granted degree-awarding powers in 1992 as a university college before being granted university status in August 2005. It offers courses leading to a Postgraduate Certificate in Education. It has schools in the following subject areas: Art and Design, Education, English and Creative Studies, Historical and Cultural Studies, Music and the Performing Arts, Science and the Environment and Social Sciences.

Bath College offers further education, and Norland College provides education and training in childcare.

==Sport==
===Rugby===

Bath Rugby is a rugby union team in the Premiership league. It plays in blue, white and black kit at the Recreation Ground in the city, where it has been since the late 19th century, following its establishment in 1865. The team&#x27;s first major honour was winning the John Player Cup, now sponsored as the LV Cup and also known as the Anglo-Welsh Cup, four years consecutively from 1984 until 1987. The team then led the Courage league in six seasons in eight years between 1988 and 1989 and 1995–96, during which time it also won the renamed Pilkington Cup in 1989, 1990, 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1996. It finally won the Heineken Cup in the 1997–98 season, and topped the Zürich Premiership (now Gallagher Premiership) in 2003–04. The team&#x27;s squad includes several members who also play, or have played in the English national team, including Lee Mears, Rob Webber, Dave Attwood, Nick Abendanon and Matt Banahan. Colston&#x27;s School, Bristol, has had a large input in the team over the past decade, providing several current 1st XV squad members. The former England Rugby Team Manager and former Scotland national coach Andy Robinson used to play for Bath Rugby team and was captain and later coach. Both of Robinson&#x27;s predecessors, Clive Woodward and Jack Rowell, as well as his successor Brian Ashton, were also former Bath coaches and managers.

===Football===

Bath City F.C. is the semi-professional football team. Founded in 1889, the club has played their home matches at Twerton Park since 1932. Bath City&#x27;s history is entirely in non-league football, predominantly in the 5th tier. Bath narrowly missed out on election to the Football League by a few votes in 1978 and again in 1985. The club have a good history in the FA Cup, reaching the third round six times. The record attendance, 18,020, at the ground was in 1960 against Brighton. The club&#x27;s colours are black and white and their official nickname is &quot;The Romans&quot;, stemming from Bath&#x27;s Ancient Roman history. The club is sometimes called &quot;The Stripes&quot;, referring to their striped kit.

Until 2009 Team Bath F.C. operated as an affiliate to the University Athletics programme. In 2002, Team Bath became the first university team to enter the FA Cup in 120 years, and advanced through four qualifying rounds to the first round proper. The university&#x27;s team was established in 1999 while the city team has existed since before 1908 (when it entered the Western League). However, in 2009, the Football Conference ruled that Team Bath would not be eligible to gain promotion to a National division, nor were they allowed to participate in Football Association cup competitions. This ruling led to the decision by the club to fold at the end of the 2008–09 Conference South competition. In their final season, Team Bath F.C. finished 11th in the league.

Bath also has Non-League football clubs Odd Down F.C. who play at the Lew Hill Memorial Ground and Larkhall Athletic F.C. who play at Plain Ham.

===Other sports===
Many cricket clubs are based in the city, including Bath Cricket Club, who are based at the North Parade Ground and play in the West of England Premier League. Cricket is also played on the Recreation Ground, just across from the rugby club. The Recreation Ground is also home to Bath Croquet Club, which was re-formed in 1976 and is affiliated with the South West Federation of Croquet Clubs.

The Bath Half Marathon is run annually through the city streets, with over 10,000 runners.

TeamBath is the umbrella name for all of the University of Bath sports teams, including the aforementioned football club. Other sports for which TeamBath is noted are athletics, badminton, basketball, bob skeleton, bobsleigh, hockey, judo, modern pentathlon, netball, rugby union, swimming, tennis, triathlon and volleyball. The City of Bath Triathlon takes place annually at the university.

Bath Roller Derby Girls (BRDG) is a flat track roller derby club, founded in 2012, they compete in the British Roller Derby Championships Tier 3. As of 2015, they are full members of the United Kingdom Roller Derby Association (UKRDA.)

Bath is home to a table tennis League, made up of 3 divisions and a number of clubs based in Bath and the surrounding area.

==Transport==
===Roads===

Bath is approximately south-east of the larger city and port of Bristol, to which it is linked by the A4 road, which runs through Bath, and is a similar distance south of the M4 motorway at junction 18. The potential new junction 18a linking the M4 motorway with the A4174 Avon Ring Road will provide an additional direct route from Bath to the motorway.

In an attempt to reduce the level of car use, park and ride schemes have been introduced, with sites at Odd Down, Lansdown and Newbridge. A very large increase in city centre parking was also provided under the new SouthGate shopping centre development, which necessarily introduces more car traffic. In addition, a bus gate scheme in Northgate aims to reduce private car use in the city centre.

A transportation study (the Bristol/Bath to South Coast Study) was published in 2004 after being initiated by the Government Office for the South West and Bath and North East Somerset Council and undertaken by WSP Global as a result of the de-trunking in 1999 of the A36/A46 trunk road network from Bath to Southampton.

The Bath Clean Air Zone was introduced for central Bath on 15 March 2021. A Class C zone, it charges the most polluting commercial vehicles £9 per day (and up to £100 per day for coaches and HGVs). It is the first UK road pollution charging zone outside London, and reduced nitrogen dioxide levels in the city by 26% over the following two years, meeting legal standards.

====Buses====
National Express operates coach services from Bath bus station to a number of cities. Bath has a network of bus routes run by First West of England, with services to surrounding towns and cities, such as Bristol, Corsham, Chippenham, Devizes, Salisbury, Frome and Wells. Faresaver Buses also operate services to surrounding towns. The Bath Bus Company runs open-top double-decker bus tours around the city, as well as frequent services to Bristol Airport. Stagecoach West also provides services to Tetbury and the South Cotswolds. The suburbs of Bath are also served by the WESTlink on demand service, available Monday to Saturday.

====Cycling====
Bath is on National Cycle Route 4, with one of Britain&#x27;s first cycleways, the Bristol and Bath Railway Path, to the west, and an eastern route toward London on the canal towpath. Bath is about from Bristol Airport. Bath also benefits from several bridleways and byways.

===Rivers and canals===
The city is connected to Bristol and the sea by the River Avon, navigable via locks by small boats. The river was connected to the River Thames and London by the Kennet and Avon Canal in 1810 via Bath Locks; this waterway – closed for many years but restored in the last years of the 20th century – is now popular with narrowboat users.

===Railways===

Bath is served by the Bath Spa railway station (designed by Isambard Kingdom Brunel), which has regular connections to London Paddington, Bristol Temple Meads, Cardiff Central, Cheltenham, Exeter, Plymouth and Penzance (see Great Western Main Line), and also Westbury, Warminster, Weymouth, Salisbury, Southampton, Portsmouth and Brighton (see Wessex Main Line). Services are provided by Great Western Railway. There is a suburban station on the main line, Oldfield Park, which has a limited commuter service to Bristol as well as other destinations.

Green Park Station was once the terminus of the Midland Railway, and junction for the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, whose line, always steam hauled, went through the Devonshire tunnel (under the Wellsway, St Luke&#x27;s Church and the Devonshire Arms), through the Combe Down Tunnel and climbed over the Mendips to serve many towns and villages on its run to Bournemouth. This example of an English rural line was closed by Beeching in March 1966. Its Bath station building, now restored, houses shops, small businesses, the Saturday Bath Farmers Market and parking for a supermarket, while the route of the Somerset and Dorset within Bath has been reused for the Two Tunnels Greenway, a shared use path that extends National Cycle Route 24 into the city.

===Trams===
====Historical====
The Bath Tramways Company was introduced in the late 19th century, opening on 24 December 1880. The gauge cars were horse-drawn along a route from London Road to the Bath Spa railway station, but the system closed in 1902. It was replaced by electric tram cars on a greatly expanded gauge system that opened in 1904. This eventually extended to with routes to Combe Down, Oldfield Park, Twerton, Newton St Loe, Weston and Bathford. There was a fleet of 40 cars, all but 6 being double deck. The first line to close was replaced by a bus service in 1938, and the last went on 6 May 1939.

====Possible re-introduction====
In 2005, a detailed plan was created and presented to the council to re-introduce trams to Bath, but the plan did not proceed, reportedly due to the focus by the council on the government-supported busway planned to run from the Newbridge park and ride into the city centre. Part of the justification for the proposed tram reintroduction plan was the pollution from vehicles within the city, which was twice the legal levels, and the heavy traffic congestion due to high car usage. In 2015 another group, Bath Trams, building on the earlier tram group proposals, created interest in the idea of re-introducing trams with several public meetings and meetings with the council. In 2017, Bath and North East Somerset Council announced a feasibility study, due to be published by March 2018, into implementing a light rail or tram system in the city.

In November 2016, the West of England Local Enterprise Partnership began a consultation process on their Transport Vision Summary Document, outlining potential light rail/tram routes in the region, one of which being a route from Bristol city centre along the A4 road to Bath to relieve pressure on bus and rail services between the two cities.

==Media==

<doc id="41524" wikidata="Q236122" url="?curid=41524" title="Renaissance architecture">
<text>Renaissance architecture is the European architecture of the period between the early 15th and early 16th centuries in different regions, demonstrating a conscious revival and development of certain elements of ancient Greek and Roman thought and material culture. Stylistically, Renaissance architecture followed Gothic architecture and was succeeded by Baroque architecture and neoclassical architecture. Developed first in Florence, with Filippo Brunelleschi as one of its innovators, the Renaissance style quickly spread to other Italian cities. The style was carried to other parts of Europe at different dates and with varying degrees of impact.

Renaissance style places emphasis on symmetry, proportion, geometry and the regularity of parts, as demonstrated in the architecture of classical antiquity and in particular ancient Roman architecture, of which many examples remained. Orderly arrangements of columns, pilasters and lintels, as well as the use of semicircular arches, hemispherical domes, niches and aediculae replaced the more complex proportional systems and irregular profiles of medieval buildings.

==Historiography==
The word &quot;Renaissance&quot; derives from the term &quot;rinascita&quot;, which means rebirth, first appeared in Giorgio Vasari&#x27;s &quot;Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects&quot;, 1550.

Although the term Renaissance was used first by the French historian Jules Michelet, it was given its more lasting definition from the Swiss historian Jacob Burckhardt, whose book &quot;The Civilization of the Renaissance in Italy&quot;, 1860, was influential in the development of the modern interpretation of the Italian Renaissance. The folio of measured drawings &quot;Édifices de Rome moderne; ou, Recueil des palais, maisons, églises, couvents et autres monuments&quot; (The Buildings of Modern Rome), first published in 1840 by Paul Letarouilly, also played an important part in the revival of interest in this period. Erwin Panofsky, &quot;Renaissance and Renascences in Western Art&quot;, (New York: Harper and Row, 1960) The Renaissance style was recognized by contemporaries in the term &quot;all&#x27;antica&quot;, or &quot;in the ancient manner&quot; (of the Romans).

=== Principal phases ===

Historians often divide the Renaissance in Italy into three phases. Whereas art historians might talk of an &quot;Early Renaissance&quot; period, in which they include developments in 14th-century painting and sculpture, this is usually not the case in architectural history. The bleak economic conditions of the late 14th century did not produce buildings that are considered to be part of the Renaissance. As a result, the word &quot;Renaissance&quot; among architectural historians usually applies to the period 1400 to , or later in the case of non-Italian Renaissances.

Historians often use the following designations:
* Quattrocento ()
During the &quot;Quattrocento,&quot; sometimes known as the Early Renaissance, concepts of architectural order were explored and rules were formulated. The study of classical antiquity led in particular to the adoption of Classical detail and ornamentation. Space, as an element of architecture, was used differently than it was in the Middle Ages. Space was organised by proportional logic, its form and rhythm subject to geometry, rather than being created by intuition as in Medieval buildings. The prime example of this is the Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence by Filippo Brunelleschi (1377–1446).

* High Renaissance ()
During the High Renaissance, concepts derived from classical antiquity were developed and used with greater confidence. The most representative architect is Donato Bramante (1444–1514), who expanded the applicability of classical architecture to contemporary buildings. His Tempietto di San Pietro in Montorio (1503) was directly inspired by circular Roman temples. He was, however, hardly a slave to the classical forms and it was his style that was to dominate Italian architecture in the 16th century.

* Mannerism ()

During the Mannerist period, architects experimented with using architectural forms to emphasize solid and spatial relationships. The Renaissance ideal of harmony gave way to freer and more imaginative rhythms. The best known architect associated with the Mannerist style was Michelangelo (1475–1564), who frequently used the giant order in his architecture, a large pilaster that stretches from the bottom to the top of a façade. He used this in his design for the Piazza del Campidoglio in Rome. Prior to the 20th century, the term &quot;Mannerism&quot; had negative connotations, but it is now used to describe the historical period in more general non-judgemental terms.

* From Renaissance to Baroque
As the new style of architecture spread out from Italy, most other European countries developed a sort of Proto-Renaissance style, before the construction of fully formulated Renaissance buildings. Each country in turn then grafted its own architectural traditions to the new style, so that Renaissance buildings across Europe are diversified by region. Within Italy the evolution of Renaissance architecture into Mannerism, with widely diverging tendencies in the work of Michelangelo, Giulio Romano and Andrea Palladio, led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric. Outside Italy, Baroque architecture was more widespread and fully developed than the Renaissance style, with significant buildings as far afield as Mexico and the Philippines.

== History ==

=== Development in Italy ===

Italy of the 15th century, and the city of Florence in particular, was home to the Renaissance. It is in Florence that the new architectural style had its beginning, not slowly evolving in the way that Gothic grew out of Romanesque, but consciously brought to being by particular architects who sought to revive the order of a past &quot;Golden Age&quot;. The scholarly approach to the architecture of the ancient coincided with the general revival of learning. A number of factors were influential in bringing this about.

==== Architectural ====

Italian architects had always preferred forms that were clearly defined and structural members that expressed their purpose. Many Tuscan Romanesque buildings demonstrate these characteristics, as seen in the Florence Baptistery and Pisa Cathedral.

Italy had never fully adopted the Gothic style of architecture. Apart from Milan Cathedral, (influenced by French Rayonnant Gothic), few Italian churches show the emphasis on vertical, the clustered shafts, ornate tracery and complex ribbed vaulting that characterise Gothic in other parts of Europe.

The presence, particularly in Rome, of ancient architectural remains showing the ordered Classical style provided an inspiration to artists at a time when philosophy was also turning towards the Classical.

==== Political ====

In the 15th century, Florence and Venice extended their power through much of the area that surrounded them, making the movement of artists possible. This enabled Florence to have significant artistic influence in Milan, and through Milan, France.

In 1377, the return of the Pope from the Avignon Papacy and the re-establishment of the Papal court in Rome, brought wealth and importance to that city, as well as a renewal in the importance of the Pope in Italy, which was further strengthened by the Council of Constance in 1417. Successive Popes, especially Julius II, 1503–13, sought to extend the Papacy&#x27;s temporal power throughout Italy.

==== Commercial ====

In the early Renaissance, Venice controlled sea trade over goods from the East. The large towns of Northern Italy were prosperous through trade with the rest of Europe, Genoa providing a seaport for the goods of France and Spain; Milan and Turin being centres of overland trade, and maintaining substantial metalworking industries. Trade brought wool from England to Florence, ideally located on the river for the production of fine cloth, the industry on which its wealth was founded. By dominating Pisa, Florence gained a seaport, and became the most powerful state in Tuscany. In this commercial climate, one family in particular turned their attention from trade to the lucrative business of money-lending. The Medici became the chief bankers to the princes of Europe, becoming virtually princes themselves as they did so, by reason of both wealth and influence. Along the trade routes, and thus offered some protection by commercial interest, moved not only goods but also artists, scientists and philosophers. 
==== Religious ====

The return of the Pope Gregory XI from Avignon in September 1377 and the resultant new emphasis on Rome as the center of Christian spirituality, brought about a surge in the building of churches in Rome such as had not taken place for nearly a thousand years. This commenced in the mid 15th century and gained momentum in the 16th century, reaching its peak in the Baroque period. The construction of the Sistine Chapel with its uniquely important decorations and the entire rebuilding of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, one of Christendom&#x27;s most significant churches, were part of this process.

In the wealthy Republic of Florence, the impetus for church-building was more civic than spiritual. The unfinished state of the enormous Florence Cathedral dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary did no honour to the city under her patronage. However, as the technology and finance were found to complete it, the rising dome did credit not only to the Virgin Mary, its architect and the Church but also to the Signoria, the Guilds and the sectors of the city from which the manpower to construct it was drawn. The dome inspired further religious works in Florence.

==== Philosophic ====

The development of printed books, the rediscovery of ancient writings, the expanding of political and trade contacts and the exploration of the world all increased knowledge and the desire for education.

The reading of philosophies that were not based on Christian theology led to the development of humanism through which it was clear that while God had established and maintained order in the Universe, it was the role of Man to establish and maintain order in Society.

==== Civil ====

Through humanism, civic pride and the promotion of civil peace and order were seen as the marks of citizenship. This led to the building of structures such as Brunelleschi&#x27;s Hospital of the Innocents with its elegant colonnade forming a link between the charitable building and the public square, and the Laurentian Library where the collection of books established by the Medici family could be consulted by scholars.

Some major ecclesiastical building works were also commissioned, not by the church, but by guilds representing the wealth and power of the city. Brunelleschi&#x27;s dome at Florence Cathedral, more than any other building, belonged to the populace because the construction of each of the eight segments was achieved by a different quarter of the city.
==== Patronage ====

As in the Platonic Academy of Athens, it was seen by those of Humanist understanding that those people who had the benefit of wealth and education ought to promote the pursuit of learning and the creation of that which was beautiful. To this end, wealthy families—the Medici of Florence, the Gonzaga of Mantua, the Farnese in Rome, the Sforzas in Milan—gathered around them people of learning and ability, promoting the skills and creating employment for the most talented artists and architects of their day.

=== Rise of architectural theory===
During the Renaissance, architecture became not only a question of practice, but also a matter for theoretical discussion. Printing played a large role in the dissemination of ideas.
* The first treatise on architecture was (&quot;On the Subject of Building&quot;) by Leon Battista Alberti in 1450. It was to some degree dependent on Vitruvius&#x27;s &quot;De architectura&quot;, a manuscript of which was discovered in 1414 in a library in Switzerland. &quot;De re aedificatoria&quot; in 1485 became the first printed book on architecture.
* Sebastiano Serlio (1475 – c. 1554) produced the next important text, the first volume of which appeared in Venice in 1537; it was entitled &quot;Regole generali d&#x27;architettura&quot; (&quot;General Rules of Architecture&quot;). It is known as Serlio&#x27;s &quot;Fourth Book&quot; since it was the fourth in Serlio&#x27;s original plan of a treatise in seven books. In all, five books were published.
* In 1570, Andrea Palladio (1508–1580) published &quot;I quattro libri dell&#x27;architettura&quot; (&quot;The Four Books of Architecture&quot;) in Venice. This book was widely printed and responsible to a great degree for spreading the ideas of the Renaissance through Europe. All these books were intended to be read and studied not only by architects, but also by patrons.

=== Spread of the Renaissance in Italy ===

In the 15th century the courts of certain other Italian states became centres for spreading of Renaissance philosophy, art and architecture.

In Mantua at the court of the Gonzaga, Alberti designed two churches, the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Andrea and San Sebastiano.

Urbino was an important centre with the Ducal Palace being constructed for Federico da Montefeltro in the mid 15th century. The Duke employed Luciano Laurana from Dalmatia, renowned for his expertise at fortification. The design incorporates much of the earlier medieval building and includes an unusual turreted three-storeyed façade. Laurana was assisted by Francesco di Giorgio Martini. Later parts of the building are clearly Florentine in style, particularly the inner courtyard, but it is not known who the designer was.

Ferrara, under the Este, was expanded in the late 15th century, with several new palaces being built such as the Palazzo dei Diamanti and Palazzo Schifanoia for Borso d&#x27;Este.

In Milan, under the Visconti, the Certosa di Pavia was completed, and then later under the Sforza, the Castello Sforzesco was built.

Venetian Renaissance architecture developed a particularly distinctive character because of local conditions. San Zaccaria received its Renaissance façade at the hands of Antonio Gambello and Mauro Codussi, begun in the 1480s. Giovanni Maria Falconetto, the Veronese architect-sculptor, introduced Renaissance architecture to Padua with the Loggia and Odeo Cornaro in the garden of Alvise Cornaro.

In southern Italy, Renaissance masters were called to Naples by Alfonso V of Aragon after his conquest of the Kingdom of Naples. The most notable examples of Renaissance architecture in that city are the Cappella Caracciolo, attributed to Bramante, and the Palazzo Orsini di Gravina, built by Gabriele d&#x27;Angelo between 1513 and 1549.
== Characteristics ==
The Classical orders were analysed and reconstructed to serve new purposes. While the obvious distinguishing features of Classical Roman architecture were adopted by Renaissance architects, the forms and purposes of buildings had changed over time, as had the structure of cities. Among the earliest buildings of the reborn Classicism were the type of churches that the Romans had never constructed. Neither were there models for the type of large city dwellings required by wealthy merchants of the 15th century. Conversely, there was no call for enormous sporting fixtures and public bath houses such as the Romans had built.

=== Plan ===
The plans of Renaissance buildings have a square, symmetrical appearance in which proportions are usually based on a module. Within a church, the module is often the width of an aisle. The need to integrate the design of the plan with the façade was introduced as an issue in the work of Filippo Brunelleschi, but he was never able to carry this aspect of his work into fruition. The first building to demonstrate this was Basilica of Sant&#x27;Andrea, Mantua by Leone Battista Alberti. The development of the plan in secular architecture was to take place in the 16th century and culminated with the work of Palladio.

=== Façade ===
Façades are symmetrical around their vertical axis. Church façades are generally surmounted by a pediment and organised by a system of pilasters, arches and entablatures. The columns and windows show a progression towards the centre. One of the first true Renaissance façades was Pienza Cathedral (1459–62), which has been attributed to the Florentine architect Bernardo Gambarelli (known as Rossellino) with Leone Battista Alberti perhaps having some responsibility in its design as well.

Domestic buildings are often surmounted by a cornice. There is a regular repetition of openings on each floor, and the centrally placed door is marked by a feature such as a balcony, or rusticated surround. An early and much copied prototype was the façade for the Palazzo Rucellai (1446 and 1451) in Florence with its three registers of pilasters.

=== Columns and pilasters ===
Roman and Greek orders of columns are used: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian and Composite. The orders can either be structural, supporting an arcade or architrave, or purely decorative, set against a wall in the form of pilasters. During the Renaissance, architects aimed to use columns, pilasters, and entablatures as an integrated system. One of the first buildings to use pilasters as an integrated system was in the Old Sacristy (1421–1440) by Brunelleschi.

=== Arches ===
Arches are semi-circular or (in the Mannerist style) segmental. Arches are often used in arcades, supported on piers or columns with capitals. There may be a section of entablature between the capital and the springing of the arch. Alberti was one of the first to use the arch on a monumental scale at the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Andrea, Mantua.

=== Vaults ===
Vaults do not have ribs. They are semi-circular or segmental and on a square plan, unlike the Gothic vault which is frequently rectangular. The barrel vault is returned to architectural vocabulary as at St. Andrea in Mantua.

=== Domes ===


The dome is used frequently, both as a very large structural feature that is visible from the exterior, and also as a means of roofing smaller spaces where they are only visible internally. After the success of the dome in Brunelleschi&#x27;s design for Florence Cathedral and its use in Bramante&#x27;s plan for St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica (1506) in Rome, the dome became an indispensable element in church architecture and later even for secular architecture, such as Palladio&#x27;s Villa Rotonda.

=== Ceilings ===
Roofs are fitted with flat or coffered ceilings. They are not left open as in Medieval architecture. They are frequently painted or decorated.

=== Doors ===
Doors usually have square lintels. They may be set with in an arch or surmounted by a triangular or segmental pediment. Openings that do not have doors are usually arched and frequently have a large or decorative keystone.

=== Windows ===
Windows may be paired and set within a semi-circular arch. They may have square lintels and triangular or segmental pediments, which are often used alternately. Emblematic in this respect is the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, begun in 1517.

In the Mannerist period the Palladian arch was employed, using a motif of a high semi-circular topped opening flanked with two lower square-topped openings. Windows are used to bring light into the building and in domestic architecture, to give views. Stained glass, although sometimes present, is not a feature.

=== Walls ===
External walls are generally constructed of brick, rendered, or faced with stone in highly finished ashlar masonry, laid in straight courses. The corners of buildings are often emphasized by rusticated quoins. Basements and ground floors were often rusticated, as at the Palazzo Medici Riccardi (1444–1460) in Florence. Internal walls are smoothly plastered and surfaced with lime wash. For more formal spaces, internal surfaces are decorated with frescoes.

=== Details ===
Courses, mouldings and all decorative details are carved with great precision. Studying and mastering the details of the ancient Romans was one of the important aspects of Renaissance theory. The different orders each required different sets of details. Some architects were stricter in their use of classical details than others, but there was also a good deal of innovation in solving problems, especially at corners. Mouldings stand out around doors and windows rather than being recessed, as in Gothic architecture. Sculptured figures may be set in niches or placed on plinths. They are not integral to the building as in Medieval architecture.

==Early Renaissance==

The leading architects of the Early Renaissance or Quattrocento were Filippo Brunelleschi, Michelozzo and Leon Battista Alberti.

===Brunelleschi===

The person generally credited with bringing about the Renaissance view of architecture is Filippo Brunelleschi, (1377–1446). The underlying feature of the work of Brunelleschi was &quot;order&quot;.

In the early 15th century, Brunelleschi began to look at the world to see what the rules were that governed one&#x27;s way of seeing. He observed that the way one sees regular structures such as the Florence Baptistery and the tiled pavement surrounding it follows a mathematical order – linear perspective.

The buildings remaining among the ruins of ancient Rome appeared to respect a simple mathematical order in the way that Gothic buildings did not. One incontrovertible rule governed all Ancient Roman architecture – a semi-circular arch is exactly twice as wide as it is high. A fixed proportion with implications of such magnitude occurred nowhere in Gothic architecture. A Gothic pointed arch could be extended upwards or flattened to any proportion that suited the location. Arches of differing angles frequently occurred within the same structure. No set rules of proportion applied.

From the observation of the architecture of Rome came a desire for symmetry and careful proportion in which the form and composition of the building as a whole and all its subsidiary details have fixed relationships, each section in proportion to the next, and the architectural features serving to define exactly what those rules of proportion are. Brunelleschi gained the support of a number of wealthy Florentine patrons, including the Silk Guild and Cosimo de&#x27; Medici.

====Florence Cathedral====

Brunelleschi&#x27;s first major architectural commission was for the enormous brick dome which covers the central space of Florence&#x27;s cathedral, designed by Arnolfo di Cambio in the 14th century but left unroofed. While often described as the first building of the Renaissance, Brunelleschi&#x27;s daring design utilises the pointed Gothic arch and Gothic ribs that were apparently planned by Arnolfo. It seems certain, however, that while stylistically Gothic, in keeping with the building it surmounts, the dome is in fact structurally influenced by the great dome of Ancient Rome, which Brunelleschi could hardly have ignored in seeking a solution. This is the dome of the Pantheon, a circular temple, now a church.

Inside the Pantheon&#x27;s single-shell concrete dome is coffering which greatly decreases the weight. The vertical partitions of the coffering effectively serve as ribs, although this feature does not dominate visually. At the apex of the Pantheon&#x27;s dome is an opening, 8 meters across. Brunelleschi was aware that a dome of enormous proportion could in fact be engineered without a keystone. The dome in Florence is supported by the eight large ribs and sixteen more internal ones holding a brick shell, with the bricks arranged in a herringbone manner. Although the techniques employed are different, in practice, both domes comprise a thick network of ribs supporting very much lighter and thinner infilling. And both have a large opening at the top.

====San Lorenzo====

The new architectural philosophy of the Renaissance is best demonstrated in the churches of San Lorenzo, and Santo Spirito, Florence. Designed by Brunelleschi in about 1425 and 1428 respectively, both have the shape of the Latin cross. Each has a modular plan, each portion being a multiple of the square bay of the aisle. This same formula controlled also the vertical dimensions. In the case of Santo Spirito, which is entirely regular in plan, transepts and chancel are identical, while the nave is an extended version of these. In 1434 Brunelleschi designed the first Renaissance centrally planned building, Santa Maria degli Angeli, Florence. It is composed of a central octagon surrounded by a circuit of eight smaller chapels. From this date onwards numerous churches were built in variations of these designs.

===Michelozzo===
Michelozzo Michelozzi (1396–1472), was another architect under patronage of the Medici family, his most famous work being the Palazzo Medici Riccardi, which he was commissioned to design for Cosimo de&#x27; Medici in 1444. A decade later he built the Villa Medici, Fiesole. Among his other works for Cosimo are the library at the Convent of San Marco, Florence. He went into exile in Venice for a time with his patron. He was one of the first architects to work in the Renaissance style outside Italy, building a palace at Dubrovnik.

The Palazzo Medici Riccardi is Classical in the details of its pedimented windows and recessed doors, but, unlike the works of Brunelleschi and Alberti, there are no classical orders of columns in evidence. Instead, Michelozzo has respected the Florentine liking for rusticated stone. He has seemingly created three orders out of the three defined rusticated levels, the whole being surmounted by an enormous Roman-style cornice which juts out over the street by 2.5 meters.

===Alberti===
Leon Battista Alberti, born in Genoa (1402–1472), was an important Humanist theoretician and designer whose book on architecture &quot;De re Aedificatoria&quot; was to have lasting effect. An aspect of Renaissance humanism was an emphasis of the anatomy of nature, in particular the human form, a science first studied by the Ancient Greeks. Humanism made man the measure of things. Alberti perceived the architect as a person with great social responsibilities.
He designed a number of buildings, but unlike Brunelleschi, he did not see himself as a builder in a practical sense and so left the supervision of the work to others. Miraculously, one of his greatest designs, that of the Basilica of Sant&#x27;Andrea, Mantua, was brought to completion with its character essentially intact. Not so the Church of San Francesco in Rimini, a rebuilding of a Gothic structure, which, like Sant&#x27;Andrea, was to have a façade reminiscent of a Roman triumphal arch. This was left sadly incomplete.

Sant&#x27;Andrea is an extremely dynamic building both without and within. Its triumphal façade is marked by extreme contrasts. The projection of the order of pilasters that define the architectural elements, but are essentially non-functional, is very shallow. This contrasts with the gaping deeply recessed arch which makes a huge portico before the main door. The size of this arch is in direct contrast to the two low square-topped openings that frame it. The light and shade play dramatically over the surface of the building because of the shallowness of its mouldings and the depth of its porch. In the interior Alberti has dispensed with the traditional nave and aisles. Instead there is a slow and majestic progression of alternating tall arches and low square doorways, repeating the &quot;triumphal arch&quot; motif of the façade.

Two of Alberti&#x27;s best known buildings are in Florence, the Palazzo Rucellai and at Santa Maria Novella. For the palace, Alberti applied the classical orders of columns to the façade on the three levels, 1446–51. At Santa Maria Novella he was commissioned to finish the decoration of the façade. He completed the design in 1456 but the work was not finished until 1470.

The lower section of the building had Gothic niches and typical polychrome marble decoration. There was a large ocular window in the end of the nave which had to be taken into account. Alberti simply respected what was already in place, and the Florentine tradition for polychrome that was well established at the Baptistery of San Giovanni, the most revered building in the city. The decoration, being mainly polychrome marble, is mostly very flat in nature, but a sort of order is established by the regular compartments and the circular motifs which repeat the shape of the round window. For the first time, Alberti linked the lower roofs of the aisles to nave using two large scrolls. These were to become a standard Renaissance device for solving the problem of different roof heights and bridge the space between horizontal and vertical surfaces.

==High Renaissance==
In the late 15th century and early 16th century, architects such as Bramante, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and others showed a mastery of the revived style and ability to apply it to buildings such as churches and city palazzo which were quite different from the structures of ancient times. The style became more decorated and ornamental, statuary, domes and cupolas becoming very evident. The architectural period is known as the &quot;High Renaissance&quot; and coincides with the age of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael.

===Bramante===
Donato Bramante, (1444–1514), was born in Urbino and turned from painting to architecture, finding his first important patronage under Ludovico Sforza, Duke of Milan, for whom he produced a number of buildings over 20 years. After the fall of Milan to the French in 1499, Bramante travelled to Rome where he achieved great success under papal patronage.
Bramante&#x27;s finest architectural achievement in Milan is his addition of crossing and choir to the abbey church of Santa Maria delle Grazie (Milan). This is a brick structure, the form of which owes much to the Northern Italian tradition of square domed baptisteries. The new building is almost centrally planned, except that, because of the site, the chancel extends further than the transept arms. The hemispherical dome, of approximately 20 metres across, rises up hidden inside an octagonal drum pierced at the upper level with arched classical openings. The whole exterior has delineated details decorated with the local terracotta ornamentation. From 1488 to 1492 he worked for Ascanio Sforza on Pavia Cathedral, on which he imposed a central plan scheme and built some apses and the crypt, inspired by the thermal baths of the Roman age.

In Rome Bramante created what has been described as &quot;a perfect architectural gem&quot;, the Tempietto in the Cloister of San Pietro in Montorio. This small circular temple marks the spot where St Peter was martyred and is thus the most sacred site in Rome. The building adapts the style apparent in the remains of the Temple of Vesta, the most sacred site of Ancient Rome. It is enclosed by and in spatial contrast with the cloister which surrounds it. As approached from the cloister, as in the picture above, it is seen framed by an arch and columns, the shape of which are echoed in its free-standing form.

Bramante went on to work on the Apostolic Palace, where he designed the Cortile del Belvedere. In 1506 his design for Pope Julius II&#x27;s rebuilding of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica was selected, and the foundation stone laid. After Bramante&#x27;s death and many changes of plan, Michelangelo, as chief architect, reverted to something closer to Bramante&#x27;s original proposal.

===Sangallo===
Antonio da Sangallo the Younger (1485–1546) was one of a family of military engineers. His uncle, Giuliano da Sangallo was one of those who submitted a plan for the rebuilding of St Peter&#x27;s and was briefly a co-director of the project, with Raphael.

Antonio da Sangallo also submitted a plan for St Peter&#x27;s and became the chief architect after the death of Raphael, to be succeeded himself by Michelangelo.

His fame does not rest upon his association with St Peter&#x27;s but in his building of the Farnese Palace, &quot;the grandest palace of this period&quot;, started in 1530. The impression of grandness lies in part in its sheer size, (56 m long by 29.5 meters high) and in its lofty location overlooking a broad piazza. Unusually for such a large and luxurious house of the time, it was built principally of stuccoed brick, rather than of stone. Against the smooth pink-washed walls the stone quoins of the corners, the massive rusticated portal and the repetition of finely detailed windows produce an elegant effect. The upper of the three equally sized floors was added by Michelangelo. The travertine for its architectural details came not from a quarry, but from the Colosseum.

===Raphael===
Raphael (1483–1520), born in Urbino, trained under Perugino in Perugia before moving to Florence, was for a time the chief architect for St. Peter&#x27;s, working in conjunction with Antonio Sangallo. He also designed a number of buildings, most of which were finished by others. His single most influential work is the Palazzo Pandolfini in Florence with its two stories of strongly articulated windows of a &quot;tabernacle&quot; type, each set around with ordered pilasters, cornice and alternate arched and triangular pediments.
==Mannerism==
Mannerism in architecture was marked by widely diverging tendencies in the work of Michelangelo, Giulio Romano, Baldassare Peruzzi and Andrea Palladio, that led to the Baroque style in which the same architectural vocabulary was used for very different rhetoric.
===Peruzzi===
Baldassare Peruzzi, (1481–1536), was an architect born in Siena, but working in Rome, whose work bridges the High Renaissance and the Mannerist period. His Villa Farnesina of 1509 is a very regular monumental cube of two equal stories, the bays being strongly articulated by orders of pilasters. The building is unusual for its frescoed walls.

Peruzzi&#x27;s most famous work is the Palazzo Massimo alle Colonne in Rome. The unusual features of this building are that its façade curves gently around a curving street. It has in its ground floor a dark central portico running parallel to the street, but as a semi enclosed space, rather than an open loggia. Above this rise three undifferentiated floors, the upper two with identical small horizontal windows in thin flat frames which contrast strangely with the deep porch, which has served, from the time of its construction, as a refuge to the city&#x27;s poor.

===Giulio Romano===
Giulio Romano (1499–1546), was a pupil of Raphael, assisting him on various works for the Vatican. Romano was also a highly inventive designer, working for Federico II Gonzaga at Mantua on the Palazzo Te (1524–1534), a project which combined his skills as architect, sculptor and painter. In this work, incorporating garden grottoes and extensive frescoes, he uses illusionistic effects, surprising combinations of architectural form and texture, and the frequent use of features that seem somewhat disproportionate or out of alignment. The total effect is eerie and disturbing. Ilan Rachum cites Romano as &quot;one of the first promoters of Mannerism&quot;.

===Michelangelo===
Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475–1564) was one of the creative giants whose achievements mark the High Renaissance. He excelled in each of the fields of painting, sculpture and architecture, and his achievements brought about significant changes in each area. His architectural fame lies chiefly in two buildings: the interiors of the Laurentian Library and its lobby at the monastery of San Lorenzo in Florence, and St Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

St. Peter&#x27;s was &quot;the greatest creation of the Renaissance&quot;, and a great number of architects contributed their skills to it. But at its completion, there was more of Michelangelo&#x27;s design than of any other architect, before or after him.

==== St. Peter&#x27;s ====
The plan that was accepted at the laying of the foundation stone in 1506 was that by Bramante. Various changes in plan occurred in the series of architects that succeeded him, but Michelangelo, when he took over the project in 1546, reverted to Bramante&#x27;s Greek-cross plan and redesigned the piers, the walls and the dome, giving the lower weight-bearing members massive proportions and eliminating the encircling aisles from the chancel and identical transept arms. Helen Gardner says: &quot;Michelangelo, with a few strokes of the pen, converted its snowflake complexity into a massive, cohesive unity.&quot;

Michelangelo&#x27;s dome was a masterpiece of design using two masonry shells, one within the other and crowned by a massive roof lantern supported, as at Florence, on ribs. For the exterior of the building he designed a giant order which defines every external bay, the whole lot being held together by a wide cornice which runs unbroken like a rippling ribbon around the entire building.

There is a wooden model of the dome, showing its outer shell as hemispherical. When Michelangelo died in 1564, the building had reached the height of the drum. The architect who succeeded Michelangelo was Giacomo della Porta. The dome, as built, has a much steeper projection than the dome of the model. It is generally presumed that it was della Porta who made this change to the design, to lessen the outward thrust. But, in fact it is unknown who it was that made this change, and it is equally possible and a stylistic likelihood that the person who decided upon the more dynamic outline was Michelangelo himself at some time during the years that he supervised the project.

====Laurentian Library====
Michelangelo was at his most Mannerist in the design of the vestibule of the Laurentian Library, also built by him to house the Medici collection of books at the convent of San Lorenzo, Florence, the same San Lorenzo&#x27;s at which Brunelleschi had recast church architecture into a Classical mold and established clear formula for the use of Classical orders and their various components.

Michelangelo takes all Brunelleschi&#x27;s components and bends them to his will. The Library is upstairs. It is a long low building with an ornate wooden ceiling, a matching floor and crowded with corrals finished by his successors to Michelangelo&#x27;s design. But it is a light room, the natural lighting streaming through a long row of windows that appear positively crammed between the order of pilasters that march along the wall. The vestibule, on the other hand, is tall, taller than it is wide and is crowded by a large staircase that pours out of the library in what Nikolaus Pevsner refers to as a &quot;flow of lava&quot;, and bursts in three directions when it meets the balustrade of the landing. It is an intimidating staircase, made all the more so because the rise of the stairs at the center is steeper than at the two sides, fitting only eight steps into the space of nine.

The space is crowded and it is to be expected that the wall spaces would be divided by pilasters of low projection. But Michelangelo has chosen to use paired columns, which, instead of standing out boldly from the wall, he has sunk deep into recesses within the wall itself. In the Basilica di San Lorenzo nearby, Brunelleschi used little scrolling console brackets to break the strongly horizontal line of the course above the arcade. Michelangelo has borrowed Brunelleschi&#x27;s motifs and stood each pair of sunken columns on a pair of twin console brackets. Pevsner says the &quot;Laurenziana [...] reveals Mannerism in its most sublime architectural form&quot;.
===Giacomo della Porta===
Giacomo della Porta, (–1602), was famous as the architect who made the dome of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica a reality. The change in outline between the dome as it appears in the model and the dome as it was built, has brought about speculation as to whether the changes originated with della Porta or with Michelangelo himself.

Della Porta spent nearly all his working life in Rome, designing villas, palazzi and churches in the Mannerist style. One of his most famous works is the façade of the Church of the Gesù, a project that he inherited from his teacher Jacopo Barozzi da Vignola. Most characteristics of the original design are maintained, subtly transformed to give more weight to the central section, where della Porta uses, among other motifs, a low triangular pediment overlaid on a segmental one above the main door. The upper storey and its pediment give the impression of compressing the lower one. The center section, like that of Sant&#x27;Andrea at Mantua, is based on the triumphal arch, but has two clear horizontal divisions like Santa Maria Novella. See Alberti above. The problem of linking the aisles to the nave is solved using Alberti&#x27;s scrolls, in contrast to Vignola&#x27;s solution which provided much smaller brackets and four statues to stand above the paired pilasters, visually weighing down the corners of the building. The influence of the design may be seen in Baroque churches throughout Europe.

===Andrea Palladio===
Andrea Palladio, (1508–80), &quot;the most influential architect of the whole Renaissance&quot;, was, as a stonemason, introduced to Humanism by the poet Giangiorgio Trissino. His first major architectural commission was the rebuilding of the Basilica Palladiana at Vicenza, in the Veneto where he was to work most of his life.

Palladio was to transform the architectural style of both palaces and churches by taking a different perspective on the notion of Classicism. While the architects of Florence and Rome looked to structures like the Colosseum and the Arch of Constantine to provide formulae, Palladio looked to classical temples with their simple peristyle form. When he used the triumphal arch motif of a large arched opening with lower square-topped opening on either side, he invariably applied it on a small scale, such as windows, rather than on a large scale as Alberti used it at Sant&#x27;Andrea&#x27;s. This Ancient Roman motif is often referred to as the Palladian Arch.

The best known of Palladio&#x27;s domestic buildings is Villa Capra, otherwise known as &quot;La Rotonda&quot;, a centrally planned house with a domed central hall and four identical façades, each with a temple-like portico like that of the Pantheon, Rome. At the Villa Cornaro, the projecting portico of the north façade and recessed loggia of the garden façade are of two ordered stories, the upper forming a balcony.

Like Alberti, della Porta and others, in the designing of a church façade, Palladio was confronted by the problem of visually linking the aisles to the nave while maintaining and defining the structure of the building. Palladio&#x27;s solution was entirely different from that employed by della Porta. At the church of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice he overlays a tall temple, its columns raised on high plinths, over another low wide temple façade, its columns rising from the basements and its narrow lintel and pilasters appearing behind the giant order of the central nave.

== Progression from Early Renaissance through to Baroque ==


In Italy, there appears to be a seamless progression from Early Renaissance architecture through the High Renaissance and Mannerism to the Baroque style. Pevsner comments about the vestibule of the Laurentian Library that it &quot;has often been said that the motifs of the walls show Michelangelo as the father of the Baroque&quot;.

While continuity may be the case in Italy, it was not necessarily the case elsewhere. The adoption of the Renaissance style of architecture was slower in some areas than in others, as may be seen in England, for example. Indeed, as Pope Julius II was having the Old St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica demolished to make way for the new, Henry VII of England was adding a glorious new chapel in the Perpendicular Gothic style to Westminster Abbey.

Likewise, the style that was to become known as Baroque evolved in Italy in the early 17th century, at about the time that the first fully Renaissance buildings were constructed at Greenwich and Whitehall in England, after a prolonged period of experimentation with Classical motifs applied to local architectural forms, or conversely, the adoption of Renaissance structural forms in the broadest sense with an absence of the formulae that governed their use. While the English were just discovering what the rules of Classicism were, the Italians were experimenting with methods of breaking them. In England, following the Restoration of the Monarchy in 1660, the architectural climate changed, and taste moved in the direction of the Baroque. Rather than evolving, as it did in Italy, it arrived fully fledged.

In a similar way, in many parts of Europe that had few purely classical and ordered buildings like Brunelleschi&#x27;s Santo Spirito and Michelozzo&#x27;s Medici Riccardi Palace, Baroque architecture appeared almost unheralded, on the heels of a sort of Proto-Renaissance local style. The spread of the Baroque and its replacement of traditional and more conservative Renaissance architecture was particularly apparent in the building of churches as part of the Counter Reformation.

==Spread in Europe==

The 16th century saw the economic and political ascendancy of France, Spain and Portugal, then later the rise of England, Poland and Russia and the Dutch Republic. The result was that these places began to import the Renaissance style as indicators of their new cultural position. This also meant that it was not until about 1500 and later that signs of Renaissance architectural style began to appear outside Italy.

Though Italian architects were highly sought after, such as Sebastiano Serlio in France, Aristotile Fioravanti in Russia, and Francesco Fiorentino in Poland, soon, non-Italians were studying Italian architecture and translating it into their own idiom. These included Philibert de l&#x27;Orme (1510–1570) in France, Juan Bautista de Toledo (died: 1567) in Spain, Inigo Jones (1573–1652) in England and Elias Holl (1573–1646) in Germany.

Books or ornament prints with engraved illustrations demonstrating plans and ornament were very important in spreading Renaissance styles in Northern Europe, with among the most important authors being Androuet du Cerceau in France, and Hans Vredeman de Vries in the Netherlands, and Wendel Dietterlin, author of &quot;Architectura&quot; (1593–94) in Germany.

===Baltic region===
The Renaissance arrived late in what is today Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, the so-called Baltic States, and did not make a great imprint architecturally. It was a politically tumultuous time, marked by the decline of the State of the Teutonic Order and the Livonian War.

In Estonia, artistic influences came from Dutch, Swedish and Polish sources. The building of the Brotherhood of the Blackheads in Tallinn with a façade designed by Arent Passer, is the only truly Renaissance building in the country that has survived more or less intact. Significantly for these troubled times, the only other examples are purely military buildings, such as the &quot;Fat Margaret&quot; cannon tower, also in Tallinn.

Latvian Renaissance architecture was influenced by Polish-Lithuanian and Dutch style, with Mannerism following from Gothic without intermediaries. St. John&#x27;s Church in the Latvian capital of Riga is an example of an earlier Gothic church which was reconstructed in 1587–89 by the Dutch architect Gert Freze (Joris Phraeze). The prime example of Renaissance architecture in Latvia is the heavily decorated House of the Blackheads, rebuilt from an earlier Medieval structure into its present Mannerist forms as late as 1619–25 by the architects A. and L. Jansen. It was destroyed during World War II and rebuilt during the 1990s.

Lithuania meanwhile formed a large dual state with Poland, known as the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. Renaissance influences grew stronger during the reign of Sigismund I the Old and Sigismund II Augustus. The Palace of the Grand Dukes of Lithuania (destroyed in 1801, a copy built in 2002–2009) show Italian influences. Several architects of Italian origin were active in the country, including Bernardino Zanobi de Gianotis, Giovanni Cini and Giovanni Maria Mosca.

===Bohemia===
The Renaissance style first appeared in the Crown of Bohemia in the 1490s. Bohemia together with its incorporated lands, especially Moravia, thus ranked among the areas of the Holy Roman Empire with the earliest known examples of the Renaissance architecture.

The lands of the Bohemian Crown were never part of the ancient Roman Empire, thus they missed their own ancient classical heritage and had to be dependent on the primarily Italian models. As well as in other Central European countries the Gothic style kept its position especially in the church architecture. The traditional Gothic architecture was considered timeless and therefore able to express the sacredness. The Renaissance architecture coexisted with the Gothic style in Bohemia and Moravia until the late 16th century (e. g. the residential part of a palace was built in the modern Renaissance style but its chapel was designed with Gothic elements). The façades of Czech Renaissance buildings were often decorated with sgraffito (figural or ornamental).

During the reign of Rudolph II, Holy Roman Emperor and Bohemian king, the city of Prague became one of the most important European centers of the late Renaissance art (so-called Mannerism). Nevertheless, not many architecturally significant buildings have been preserved from that time.

===Croatia===
In the 15th century, Croatia was divided into three states: the northern and central part of Croatia and Slavonia were in union with the Kingdom of Hungary, while Dalmatia, with the exception of the independent Republic of Ragusa, was under the rule of the Venetian Republic. The Cathedral of St James in Šibenik, was begun in 1441 in the Gothic style by Giorgio da Sebenico &quot;(Juraj Dalmatinac)&quot;. Its unusual construction does not use mortar, the stone blocks, pilasters and ribs being bonded with joints and slots in the way that was usual in wooden constructions. In 1477 the work was unfinished, and continued under Niccolò di Giovanni Fiorentino, who respected the mode of construction and the plan of the former architect, but continued the work which includes the upper windows, the vaults and the dome, in the Renaissance style. The combination of a high barrel vault with lower half-barrel vaults over the aisles the gives the façade its distinctive trefoil shape, the first of this type in the region. The cathedral was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage List in 2001.

===England===
After some first efforts by kings and courtiers, most now vanished, like Henry VII&#x27;s Richmond Palace (), Henry VIII&#x27;s Nonsuch Palace, and the first Somerset House in London, a local style of Renaissance architecture emerged in England during the reign of Elizabeth I, much influenced by the Low countries where among other features it acquired versions of the Dutch gable, and Flemish strapwork in geometric designs adorning the walls. The new style tended to manifest itself in large square tall prodigy houses such as Longleat House.

The first great exponent of classicizing Italian Renaissance architecture in England was Inigo Jones (1573–1652), who had studied architecture in Italy where the influence of Palladio was very strong. Jones returned to England full of enthusiasm for the new movement and immediately began to design such buildings as the Queen&#x27;s House at Greenwich in 1616 and the Banqueting House, Whitehall three years later. These works, with their clean lines, and symmetry were revolutionary in a country still enamoured with mullion windows, crenellations and turrets.

===France===
During the early years of the 16th century the French were involved in wars in northern Italy, bringing back to France not just the Renaissance art treasures as their war booty, but also stylistic ideas. In the Loire Valley a wave of building was carried and many Renaissance châteaux appeared at this time, the earliest example being the Château d&#x27;Amboise () in which Leonardo da Vinci spent his last years. The style became dominant under Francis I (See Châteaux of the Loire Valley).

===Germany===

The Renaissance in Germany was inspired first by German philosophers and artists such as Albrecht Dürer and Johannes Reuchlin who visited Italy. Important early examples of this period are especially the Landshut Residence, Heidelberg Castle, Johannisburg Palace in Aschaffenburg, Schloss Weilburg, the City Hall and Fugger Houses in Augsburg and St. Michael&#x27;s Church, Munich. A particular form of Renaissance architecture in Germany is the Weser Renaissance, with prominent examples such as Bremen City Hall and the Juleum in Helmstedt.

In July 1567 the city council of Cologne approved a design in the Renaissance style by Wilhelm Vernukken for a two storied loggia for Cologne City Hall. St Michael in Munich is the largest Renaissance church north of the Alps. It was built by William V, Duke of Bavaria between 1583 and 1597 as a spiritual center for the Counter Reformation and was inspired by the Church of the Gesù in Rome. The architect is unknown. Many examples of Brick Renaissance buildings can be found in Hanseatic old towns, such as Stralsund, Wismar, Lübeck, Lüneburg, Friedrichstadt and Stade. Notable German Renaissance architects include Friedrich Sustris, Benedikt Rejt, Abraham van den Blocke, Elias Holl and Hans Krumpper.

===Hungary===

One of the earliest places to be influenced by the Renaissance style of architecture was the Kingdom of Hungary. The style appeared following the marriage of King Matthias Corvinus and Beatrice of Naples in 1476. Many Italian artists, craftsmen and masons arrived at Buda with the new queen. Important remains of the Early Renaissance summer palace of King Matthias can be found in Visegrád. The Ottoman conquest of Hungary after 1526 cut short the development of Renaissance architecture in the country and destroyed its most famous examples. Today, the only completely preserved work of Hungarian Renaissance architecture is the Bakócz Chapel (commissioned by the Hungarian cardinal Tamás Bakócz), now part of the Esztergom Basilica.

===Habsburg Netherlands===
As in painting, Renaissance architecture took some time to reach the Habsburg Netherlands and did not entirely supplant the Gothic elements. An architect directly influenced by the Italian masters was Cornelis Floris de Vriendt, who designed Antwerp City Hall, finished in 1564. The style is sometimes called the Flemish-Italian Renaissance style and is also known as the Floris style. In this style the overall structure was similar to that of late-Gothic buildings, but with larger windows and much florid decoration and detailing in the Renaissance styles. This style became widely influential across Northern Europe, for example in Elizabethan architecture, and is part of the wider movement of Northern Mannerism.

===Dutch Republic===

In the early 17th century Dutch Republic, Hendrick de Keyser played an important role in developing the &quot;Amsterdam Renaissance&quot; style, which has local characteristics including the prevalence of tall narrow town-houses, the &quot;trapgevel&quot; or Dutch gable and the employment of decorative triangular pediments over doors and windows in which the apex rises much more steeply than in most other Renaissance architecture, but in keeping with the profile of the gable. Carved stone details are often of low profile, in strapwork resembling leatherwork, a stylistic feature originating in the School of Fontainebleau. This feature was exported to England.

===Poland===
Polish Renaissance architecture is divided into three periods:
The first period (1500–50) is the so-called &quot;Italian&quot; as most of Renaissance buildings of this time were designed by Italian architects, mainly from Florence, including Francesco Fiorentino and Bartolomeo Berrecci. Renowned architects from Southern Europe became sought-after during the reign of Sigismund I the Old and his Italian-born wife, Queen Bona Sforza. Notable examples from this period include Wawel Castle Courtyard and Sigismund&#x27;s Chapel.

In the second period (1550–1600), Renaissance architecture became more common, with the beginnings of Mannerist and under the influence of the Netherlands, particularly in northern Poland and Pomerania, but also in parts of Lesser Poland. Buildings of this kind include the Cloth Hall in Kraków and city halls of Tarnów and Sandomierz. The most famous example is the 16th-century Poznań Town Hall, designed by Giovanni Battista di Quadro.

In the third period (1600–50), the rising power of sponsored Jesuits and Counter Reformation gave impetus to the development of Mannerist architecture and Baroque. Most notable example of this period is Kalwaria Zebrzydowska park, mannerist architectural and park landscape complex and pilgrimage park, which consists Basilica of St. Mary and 42 chapels modelled and named after the places in Jerusalem and Holy Land. This is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Another great example from this period is Krasiczyn Castle, which is an palazzo in fortezza with a unique sgraffito wall decorations, whose total area is about 7000 square meters.

===Portugal===
The adoption of the Renaissance style in Portugal was gradual. The so-called Manueline style (–1535) married Renaissance elements to Gothic structures with the superficial application of exuberant ornament similar to the Isabelline Gothic of Spain. Examples of Manueline include the Belém Tower, a defensive building of Gothic form decorated with Renaissance-style loggias, and the Jerónimos Monastery, with Renaissance ornaments decorating portals, columns and cloisters.

The first &quot;pure&quot; Renaissance structures appear under King John III, like the Chapel of Nossa Senhora da Conceição in Tomar (1532–40), the &quot;Porta Especiosa&quot; of Coimbra Cathedral and the Church of Nossa Senhora da Graça (Évora) (–1540), as well as the cloisters of Viseu Cathedral (–1534) and Convent of Christ in Tomar (John III Cloisters, 1557–1591). The Lisbon buildings of São Roque Church (1565–87) and the Mannerist Monastery of São Vicente de Fora (1582–1629), strongly influenced religious architecture in both Portugal and its colonies in the next centuries.

===Russia===

Prince Ivan III introduced Renaissance architecture to Russia by inviting a number of architects from Italy, who brought new construction techniques and some Renaissance style elements with them, while in general following the traditional designs of the Russian architecture. In 1475 the Bolognese architect Aristotele Fioravanti came to rebuild the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin, damaged in an earthquake. Fioravanti was given the 12th-century Assumption Cathedral in Vladimir as a model, and produced a design combining traditional Russian style with a Renaissance sense of spaciousness, proportion and symmetry.

In 1485, Ivan III commissioned the building of a royal Terem Palace within the Kremlin, with Aloisio da Milano being the architect of the first three floors. Aloisio da Milano, as well as the other Italian architects, also greatly contributed to the construction of the Kremlin walls and towers. The small banqueting hall of the Russian Tsars, called the Palace of Facets because of its facetted upper story, is the work of two Italians, Marco Ruffo and Pietro Solario, and shows a more Italian style.

In 1505, an Italian known in Russia as Aleviz Novyi built twelve churches for Ivan III, including the Cathedral of the Archangel, a building remarkable for the successful blending of Russian tradition, Orthodox requirements and Renaissance style.

===Scandinavia===
The Renaissance architecture that found its way to Scandinavia was influenced by the Flemish architecture, and included high gables and a castle air as demonstrated in the architecture of Frederiksborg Palace. Consequently, much of the Neo-Renaissance to be found in the Scandinavian countries is derived from this source.

In Denmark, Renaissance architecture thrived during the reigns of Frederick II and especially Christian IV. Inspired by the French castles of the times, Flemish architects designed masterpieces such as Kronborg Castle in Helsingør and Frederiksborg Castle in Hillerød. The Frederiksborg Castle (1602–1620) is the largest Renaissance palace in Scandinavia.

Elsewhere in Sweden, with Gustav Vasa&#x27;s seizure of power and the onset of the Protestant reformation, church construction and aristocratic building projects came to a near standstill. During this time period, several magnificent so-called &quot;Vasa castles&quot; appeared. They were erected at strategic locations to control the country as well as to accommodate the travelling royal court. Gripsholm Castle, Kalmar Castle and Vadstena Castle are known for their fusion of medieval elements with Renaissance architecture.

The architecture of Norway was influenced partly by the occurrence of the plague during the Renaissance era. After the Black Death, monumental construction in Norway came to a standstill. There are few examples of Renaissance architecture in Norway, the most prominent being renovations to the medieval Rosenkrantz Tower in Bergen, Barony Rosendal in Hardanger, and the contemporary Austrat manor near Trondheim, and parts of Akershus Fortress.

There is little evidence of Renaissance influence in Finnish architecture.

===Spain===
In Spain, Renaissance began to be grafted to Gothic forms in the last decades of the 15th century. The new style is called Plateresque, because of the extremely decorated façade, that brought to the mind the decorative motifs of the intricately detailed work of silversmiths, the &quot;Plateros&quot;. Classical orders and candelabra motifs (&quot;a candelieri&quot;) combined freely. As decades passed, the Gothic influence disappeared and the research of an orthodox classicism reached high levels. Although Plateresco is a commonly used term to define most of the architectural production of the late 15th and first half of 16th century, some architects acquired a more sober personal style, like Diego Siloe, and Andrés de Vandelvira in Andalusia, and Alonso de Covarrubias and Rodrigo Gil de Hontañón in Castile. This phase of Spanish Renaissance is called Purism. From the mid-sixteenth century, under such architects as Pedro Machuca, Juan Bautista de Toledo and Juan de Herrera there was a closer adherence to the art of ancient Rome, sometimes anticipating Mannerism, examples of which include the palace of Charles V in Granada and El Escorial. This &quot;Herrerian style&quot; or &quot;arquitectura herreriana&quot; of architecture was developed during the last third of the 16th century under the reign of Philip II (1556–1598), and continued in force in the 17th century, but transformed by the Baroque style of the time. 
==Spread in the Colonial Americas==
;Bolivia:
Renaissance architecture spread to Colonial Bolivia, with examples being the Church of Curahuara de Carangas built between 1587 and 1608 known as the &quot;Sistine Chapel of the Andes&quot; by the Bolivians for its rich Mannerist decoration in its interior; and the Basilica of Our Lady of Copacabana built between 1601 and 1619 designed by the Spanish architect Francisco Jiménez de Siguenza.

;Brazil:
The best-known examples of the Renaissance architecture in Colonial Brazil are the Mannerist Cathedral Basilica of Salvador built between 1657 and 1746 and the Franciscan Convent of Santo Antônio in João Pessoa built between 1634 and 1779.
;Dominican Republic:
The House of the Five Medallions is a historic house built in 1540, located in Santo Domingo, this preserves a Plateresque Renaissance façade.

;Ecuador:
The large Basilica and Convent of San Francisco, Quito, built between 1535 and 1650, is of Mannerist Renaissance style.

;Mexico:
A notable example of Renaissance architecture in New Spain is the Cathedral of Mérida, Yucatán, one of the oldest cathedrals in the Americas, built between 1562 and 1598 and designed by Pedro de Aulestia and Juan Miguel de Agüero.

;Peru:
Several of the churches of the city of Cusco were begun during the Renaissance period, including Cusco Cathedral, (1539). Many others are Baroque in style.

== Legacy ==

Many styles of Late Renaissance and Mannerist architecture transitioned fairly easily in local styles of Baroque architecture; in other areas the change was more abrupt. Baroque and Neoclassical architecture dominated the later 17th and the 18th century in most areas, and persisted well into the 19th century in many places and individual buildings.

During the 19th century there was a conscious revival of the style in Renaissance Revival architecture, that paralleled the Gothic Revival. Whereas the Gothic style was perceived by architectural theorists as being the most appropriate style for Church building, the Renaissance palazzo was a good model for urban secular buildings requiring an appearance of dignity and reliability such as banks, gentlemen&#x27;s clubs and apartment blocks. Buildings that sought to impress, such as the Palais Garnier, were often of a more Mannerist or Baroque style. Architects of factories, office blocks and department stores continued to use the Renaissance palazzo form into the 20th century, in Mediterranean Revival Style architecture with an Italian Renaissance emphasis.

Many of the concepts and forms of Renaissance architecture can be traced through subsequent architectural movements—from Renaissance to High-Renaissance, to Mannerism, to Baroque (or Rococo), to Neo-Classicism, and to Eclecticism. While Renaissance style and motifs were largely purged from Modernism, they have been reasserted in some Postmodern architecture. The influence of Renaissance architecture can still be seen in many of the modern styles and rules of architecture today.

<text>Amadeus is a play by Peter Shaffer which gives a fictional account of the lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri, imagining a rivalry between the two at the court of Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor. First performed in 1979, it was inspired by Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s short 1830 play &quot;Mozart and Salieri&quot;, which Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov used in 1897 as the libretto for an opera of the same name.

The play makes significant use of the music of Mozart, Salieri and other composers of the period. The premieres of Mozart&#x27;s operas &quot;The Abduction from the Seraglio&quot;, &quot;The Marriage of Figaro,&quot; &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, and &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; are the settings for key scenes. It was presented at the Royal National Theatre, London in 1979, then moved to Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in the West End followed by a Broadway production. It won the 1981 Tony Award for Best Play and Shaffer adapted it for the much acclaimed 1984 film of the same name.

==Plot==
&quot;Since the play&#x27;s original run, Shaffer extensively revised his play, including changes to plot details; the following is common to all revisions.&quot;

The composer Salieri is an old man, having long outlived his fame. Speaking directly to the audience, he claims to have used poison to assassinate Mozart and promises to explain himself. The action then flashes back to the eighteenth century, at a time when Salieri, then the court composer of the Austrian emperor, has not met Mozart but has heard of him and his music. He adores Mozart&#x27;s compositions and is thrilled at the chance to meet him, during a salon honouring his patron. But when he finally catches sight of Mozart, he is deeply disappointed to find the composer lacking the grace and charm of his compositions. Mozart is crawling around on his hands and knees, engaging in profane talk with his future bride Constanze Weber.

Salieri cannot reconcile Mozart&#x27;s boorish behaviour with the genius that God has inexplicably bestowed upon him. A devout Catholic all his life, Salieri cannot believe that God would choose Mozart over him for such a gift. Salieri renounces God and vows to do everything in his power to destroy Mozart as a way of retaliating against his Creator. Salieri pretends to be Mozart&#x27;s ally to his face while doing his utmost to destroy his reputation and any success his compositions may have. Mozart&#x27;s own fortunes are not helped due to his vulgar nature. On more than one occasion, only the intervention of Emperor Joseph II allows Mozart to continue (interventions which Salieri opposes and then is all too happy to take credit for when Mozart assumes it was &quot;he&quot; who intervened). Salieri humiliates Constanze by forcing her to strip naked in front of him when she comes to him for help. He smears Mozart&#x27;s character with the Imperial Court, ruining many opportunities for the composer.

A major theme in &quot;Amadeus&quot; is Mozart&#x27;s repeated attempts to win the acceptance of Vienna&#x27;s aristocracy with increasingly brilliant compositions, which are always frustrated either by Salieri&#x27;s machinations or because the aristocrats cannot appreciate Mozart&#x27;s innovations and willingness to challenge the accepted mores of classical music. 

Towards the end of the play, with his life completely ruined, Mozart is visited one last time by Salieri, who reveals he has been Mozart&#x27;s enemy all along. After hearing this, Mozart breaks down and is left totally defeated, singing a nursery tune. He later dies in Constanze&#x27;s arms.

Salieri recounts on how he was praised throughout Europe for more than 30 years, after which audiences began to turn away from his music and toward that of Mozart, as the world finally comes to recognize his true genius. Salieri then reveals that he left a false confession of having murdered Mozart with arsenic in a last attempt to be remembered, and attempts to commit suicide with a razor. He survives and his confession is met with disbelief and eventually rejected. Defeated, Salieri, doomed to live the rest of his life in obscurity and failure, absolves the audience of their mediocrity.

==Background and production==
The play used as incidental music mainly works by Mozart, for which in the first stage production arrangements were made by Harrison Birtwistle; the only piece included of Salieri being a “banal greeting march” on which Mozart extemporises mockingly to produce &quot;Non più andrai&quot; (the aria which closes Act 1 of &quot;Le nozze di Figaro)&quot;. Nicholas Kenyon argues that the play (and film) helped to rekindle interest in Salieri&#x27;s music and increase performances of his operas.

===Historical accuracy===
Shaffer used artistic licence in his portrayals of Mozart and Salieri. Documentary evidence suggests that there may have been some occasional antipathy between the two men but the idea that Salieri was the instigator of Mozart&#x27;s demise is not taken seriously by scholars of the men&#x27;s lives and careers. In fact, there is evidence that they enjoyed a relationship marked by mutual respect. As an example, Salieri later tutored Mozart&#x27;s son Franz in music. He also conducted some of Mozart&#x27;s works, in Mozart&#x27;s lifetime and afterwards.

Writer David Cairns called &quot;Amadeus&quot; &quot;myth-mongering&quot; and argued against Shaffer&#x27;s portrait of Mozart as &quot;two contradictory beings, sublime artist and fool&quot;, positing instead that Mozart was &quot;fundamentally well-integrated&quot;. Cairns also rejects the &quot;romantic legend&quot; that Mozart always wrote out perfect manuscripts of works already completely composed in his head, citing major and prolonged revisions to several manuscripts (see: Mozart&#x27;s compositional method). Mozart scholar H. C. Robbins Landon commented that &quot;it may prove difficult to dissuade the public from the current Schafferian view of the composer as a divinely gifted drunken lout, pursued by a vengeful Salieri. By the same token, Constanze Mozart, she (in the film) of the extraordinary decollete and fatuous giggle, needs to be rescued from Schaffer&#x27;s view of her&quot;.

===Notable productions===
&quot;Amadeus&quot; was first presented at the National Theatre, London in 1979, directed by Sir Peter Hall and starring Paul Scofield as Salieri, Simon Callow as Mozart and Felicity Kendal as Constanze. (Callow appeared in the film version in a different role.) It was later transferred in modified form to Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in the West End, starring Frank Finlay as Salieri. The cast also included Andrew Cruickshank (Rosenberg), Basil Henson (von Strack), Philip Locke (Greybig), John Normington (Joseph II) and Nicholas Selby (van Swieten).

The play premiered on Broadway on 11 December 1980 at the Broadhurst Theatre, with Ian McKellen as Salieri, Tim Curry as Mozart and Jane Seymour as Constanze. It ran for 1,181 performances, closing on 16 October 1983 and was nominated for seven Tony Awards (Best Actor for both McKellen and Curry, Best Director for Peter Hall, Best Play, Best Costume Design, Lighting and Set Design for John Bury), of which it won five (including Best Play and Best Actor for McKellen). In 2015, Curry stated in an interview that the original Broadway production was the favourite stage production that he had ever been in. During the run of the play McKellen was replaced by John Wood, Frank Langella, David Dukes, David Birney, John Horton and Daniel Davis. Curry was replaced by Peter Firth, Peter Crook, Dennis Boutsikaris, John Pankow, Mark Hamill and John Thomas Waite. Also playing Constanze were Amy Irving, Suzanne Lederer, Michele Farr, Caris Corfman and Maureen Moore.

In June 1981, Roman Polanski directed and co-starred (as Mozart) in a stage production of the play, first in Warsaw (with Tadeusz Łomnicki as Salieri), then at the Théâtre Marigny in Paris with François Périer as Salieri. The play was again directed by Polanski, in Milan, in 1999.

In 1982, Richard Wherrett directed a Sydney Theatre Company production at the Theatre Royal, Sydney. It starred John Gaden as Salieri, Drew Forsythe as Mozart and Linda Cropper as Constanze, with Lyn Collingwood as Mrs Salieri and Robert Hughes as Venticello II. It ran from 6 April to 29 May 1982. Adam Redfield (as Mozart) and Terry Finn (as Constanze) appeared in the 1984 Virginia Stage Company production, at the Wells Theatre in Norfolk, Virginia, directed by Charles Towers.

The play was revived in 1998 at the Old Vic Theatre in London, directed again by Peter Hall and produced by Kim Poster. Starring in the play were Michael Sheen as Mozart, David Suchet as Salieri, Cindy Katz as Constanze and David McCallum as Joseph II. The play subsequently transferred to the Music Box Theatre, New York City, where it ran for 173 performances (15 December 1999 until 14 May 2000), and received Tony Award nominations for Best Revival and Best Actor in a Play (for Suchet&#x27;s Salieri).

In July 2006, the Los Angeles Philharmonic presented a production of portions from the latest revision of the play at the Hollywood Bowl. Neil Patrick Harris starred as Mozart, Kimberly Williams-Paisley as Constanze Mozart, and Michael York as Salieri. Leonard Slatkin conducted the Philharmonic Orchestra. Rupert Everett played Salieri in a production at the refurbished Chichester Festival Theatre from 12 July through 2 August 2014. The cast included Joshua McGuire as Mozart, Jessie Buckley as Constanze and John Standing as Count Orsini-Rosenberg. Simon Jones played Joseph II. Peter Shaffer attended the play at the closing performance.

The play was revived at the National Theatre in London in a new production directed by Michael Longhurst, from October 2016 to March 2017. It starred Lucian Msamati as Salieri alongside Adam Gillen as Mozart, Karla Crome as Constanze, Hugh Sachs as Count Orsini-Rosenberg and Tom Edden as Joseph II, accompanied with a live orchestra by the Southbank Sinfonia. The production sold out with rave reviews and returned to the Olivier Theatre at the NT with Msamati and Gillen reprising the roles of Salieri and Mozart from February to 24 April 2018, again with rave reviews.

The play was performed at the Estates Theatre, where &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; made its premier in 1787, and where part of the 1984 film was shot, in 2017 for the first time in English in the Czech Republic, directed by Guy Roberts. &quot;Amadeus&quot; was directed by Javad Molania in Tehran in March 2018 at Hafez Hall. The play was directed by in Turkey in January/February 2020 at Uniq Hall Theatre, Istanbul. A new production, scheduled for December 2022 at the Sydney Opera House, was announced in July 2022 with Michael Sheen as Salieri and Rahel Romahn as Mozart.

Murray Abraham as Salieri. This version was re-broadcast 24 May – 2 June 2010 on BBC Radio 7.

===Film===

The 1984 film adaptation won the Academy Award for Best Picture. In total, the film won eight Academy Awards. It starred F. Murray Abraham as Salieri (winning the Oscar for Best Actor for his performance), Tom Hulce as Mozart (also nominated for Best Actor) and Elizabeth Berridge as Constanze. The play was thoroughly reworked by Shaffer and the film&#x27;s director, Miloš Forman, with scenes and characters not found in the play. While the focus of the play is primarily on Salieri, the film goes further into developing the characters of both composers.

===Television series===
In November 2022, it was announced that Joe Barton would be adapting &quot;Amadeus&quot; into a television series for Sky. It will be directed by Julian Farino and Alice Seabright. On February 20, 2024, it was announced Will Sharpe would play Mozart, with Paul Bettany announced as Salieri, and Gabrielle Creevy as Constanze.

<doc id="41527" wikidata="Q514847" url="?curid=41527" title="Contrapposto">
<text>() is an Italian term that means &quot;counterpoise&quot;. It is used in the visual arts to describe a human figure standing with most of its weight on one foot, so that its shoulders and arms twist off-axis from the hips and legs in the axial plane.

First appearing in Ancient Greece in the early 5th century BCE, &quot;contrapposto&quot; is considered a crucial development in the history of Ancient Greek art (and, by extension, Western art), as it marks the first time in Western art that the human body is used to express a psychological disposition. The style was further developed and popularized by sculptors in the Hellenistic and Imperial Roman periods, fell out of use in the Middle Ages, and was later revived during the Renaissance. Michelangelo&#x27;s statue of &quot;David&quot;, one of the most iconic sculptures in the world, is a famous example of &quot;contrapposto&quot;.

==Definition==
&quot;Contrapposto&quot; was historically an important sculptural development, for its appearance marks the first time in Western art that the human body is used to express a more relaxed psychological disposition. This gives the figure a more dynamic, or alternatively relaxed appearance. In the frontal plane this also results in opposite levels of shoulders and hips, for example: if the right hip is higher than the left; correspondingly the right shoulder will be lower than the left, and vice versa. It can further encompass the tension as a figure changes from resting on a given leg to walking or running upon it (so-called &quot;ponderation&quot;). The leg that carries the weight of the body is known as the &quot;engaged&quot; leg, the relaxed leg is known as the &quot;free&quot; leg. Usually, the &quot;engaged&quot; leg is straight, or very slightly bent, and the &quot;free&quot; leg is slightly bent. &quot;Contrapposto&quot; is less emphasized than the more sinuous S-curve, and creates the illusion of past and future movement. A 2019 eye tracking study, by showing that &quot;contrapposto&quot; acts as supernormal stimulus and increases perceived attractiveness, has provided evidence and insight as to why, in artistic presentation, goddesses of beauty and love are often depicted in &quot;contrapposto&quot; pose. This was later supported in a neuroimaging study. The term &quot;contrapposto&quot; can also be used to refer to multiple figures which are in counter-pose (or opposite pose) to one another.

==History==
===Classical===
The first known statue to use &quot;contrapposto&quot; is &quot;Kritios Boy&quot;, c. 480 BCE, so called because it was once attributed to the sculptor Kritios. It is possible, even likely, that earlier bronze statues had used the technique, but if they did, they have not survived and Kenneth Clark called the statue &quot;the first beautiful nude in art&quot;. The statue is a Greek marble original and not a Roman copy.

Prior to the introduction of &quot;contrapposto&quot;, the statues that dominated ancient Greece were the archaic kouros (male) and the kore (female). &quot;Contrapposto&quot; has been used since the dawn of classical western sculpture. According to the &quot;canon&quot; of the Classical Greek sculptor Polykleitos in the 4th century BCE, it is one of the most important characteristics of his figurative works and those of his successors, Lysippos, Skopas, etc. The Polykletian statues (&quot;Discophoros&quot; (&quot;discus-bearer&quot;) and &quot;Doryphoros&quot; (&quot;spear-bearer&quot;), for example) are idealized athletic young men with the divine sense, and captured in &quot;contrapposto&quot;. In these works, the pelvis is no longer axial with the vertical statue as in the archaic style of earlier Greek sculpture before &quot;Kritios Boy&quot;.

&quot;Contrapposto&quot; can be clearly seen in the Roman copies of the statues of Hermes and Heracles. A famous example is the marble statue of &quot;Hermes and the Infant Dionysus&quot; in Olympia by Praxiteles. It can also be seen in the Roman copies of Polyclitus&#x27;s &quot;Amazon&quot;.

Greek art emphasized humanism along with the human mind and the human body&#x27;s beauty. Greek youths trained and competed in athletic contests in the nude. A great contribution to the &quot;contrapposto&quot; pose was the concept of a canon of proportions, in which mathematical properties are used to create proportions.

===Renaissance===
Classical &quot;contrapposto&quot; was revived in Renaissance art by the Italian artists Donatello and Leonardo da Vinci, followed by Michelangelo, Raphael and other artists of the High Renaissance. One of the achievements of the Italian Renaissance was the re-discovery of &quot;contrapposto&quot;.

===Modern times===
The technique continues to be widely employed in sculpture. Modern psychological research confirms the attractiveness of the pose.

<doc id="41528" wikidata="Q134773" url="?curid=41528" title="Forrest Gump">
<text>Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis. An adaptation of the 1986 novel by Winston Groom, the screenplay of the film is written by Eric Roth. It stars Tom Hanks in the title role, alongside Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson, and Sally Field in lead roles. The film follows the life of an Alabama man named Forrest Gump (Hanks) and his experiences in the 20th-century United States.

Principal photography took place between August and December 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Extensive visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The soundtrack features songs reflecting the different periods seen in the film. Various interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film&#x27;s political symbolism. 

&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was released in the United States on July 6, 1994, and received widespread critical acclaim for Zemeckis&#x27;s direction, performances (particularly those of Hanks and Sinise), visual effects, music, and screenplay. The film was a major success at the box office: it became the top-grossing film in the United States released that year and earned over worldwide during its theatrical run, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1994, behind &quot;The Lion King&quot;. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies. &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; won six Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, and Best Film Editing. It received many award nominations, including Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards, and Screen Actors Guild Awards.

In 2011, the Library of Congress selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;. An authorized Hindi remake, titled &quot;Laal Singh Chaddha&quot;, was released in 2022 in which Aamir Khan played the protagonist.

== Plot ==

In 1981, at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia, a man named Forrest Gump recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench.

In the 1950s, in Greenbow, Alabama, young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine, and cannot walk properly. He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a young Elvis Presley, who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest&#x27;s jerky dance movements into his performances. On his first day of school, Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends.

Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. While fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces break off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a football scholarship at the University of Alabama in 1963, where he is coached by Bear Bryant, and witnesses Governor George Wallace&#x27;s Stand in the Schoolhouse Door, during which he returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone Jones. Forrest becomes a top kick returner, is named on the All-American team, and meets President John F. Kennedy at the White House.

After graduating college in 1966, Forrest enlists in the U.S. Army. During basic training, he befriends a fellow soldier named Benjamin Buford &quot;Bubba&quot; Blue, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him after their service. In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam, serving with the 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta region. After months of routine operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves several wounded platoon matesincluding his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs. Gump is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism by President Lyndon B. Johnson.

At the anti-war March on the Pentagon rally, Forrest meets Abbie Hoffman and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has been living a hippie lifestyle. He also develops a talent for ping-pong, and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against Chinese teams in ping-pong diplomacy, earning him an interview alongside John Lennon on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;, influencing the song &quot;Imagine&quot;. He spends the 1971 New Year&#x27;s Eve in New York City with Dan, who has become deeply embittered. Forrest soon meets President Richard Nixon and is put up in the Watergate complex, where he unwittingly exposes the Watergate scandal.

Discharged from the army, Forrest returns to Greenbow and endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles. He uses the earnings to buy a shrimping boat in Bayou La Batre, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and they initially have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive Hurricane Carmen, they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create the &quot;Bubba Gump Shrimp Company&quot;, after which Dan rediscovers happiness and thanks Forrest for saving his life. Forrest returns home to his mother as she dies of cancer. Dan invests in Apple Inc. and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also shares their earnings with the community and Bubba&#x27;s family.

In 1976, Jenny returns to stay with Forrest, recovering from years of child abuse, drugs, and prostitution. After a while, Forrest proposes to her. She tells Forrest she loves him and the two have sex, but she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country run, becoming famous again before returning to Greenbow.

In 1981, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to visit her. Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, who introduces him to their son, Forrest Gump Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an unknown incurable virus, and the three move back to Greenbow. Jenny and Forrest finally marry, but she dies a year later. Forrest sends his son off on his first day of school as a feather floats in the wind.

== Cast ==

* Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump: At an early age, Forrest is deemed to have a below-average IQ of 75. He has an endearing character and shows devotion to his loved ones and duties, character traits that bring him into many life-changing situations. Along the way, he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life. Hanks also briefly plays Nathan Bedford Forrest in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; scene.
** Michael Conner Humphreys as young Forrest Gump: Hanks revealed in interviews that instead of having Humphreys copy his accent, he incorporated Humphreys&#x27; unique Southern accented drawl into the older character&#x27;s accent. 
* Robin Wright as Jenny Curran: Forrest&#x27;s childhood friend with whom he immediately falls in love, and never stops loving throughout his life. A victim of child sexual abuse at the hands of her bitter, widowed father, Jenny embarks on a different path from Forrest, leading a self-destructive life and becoming part of the hippie movement in California in the 1960s and the following Me Decade&#x27;s sex and drug culture of the 1970s. She re-enters Forrest&#x27;s life at various times in adulthood. Jenny eventually becomes a waitress in Savannah, Georgia, where she lives in an apartment with her (and Forrest&#x27;s) son, Forrest Jr. They eventually get married, but soon afterward she dies from complications due to an unnamed disease. This unknown disease was intended by Winston Groom, the author of the original novel, to be Hepatitis C, itself an &quot;unknown virus&quot; until defined in April 1989, although some of the makers of the film have said that they intended for the unknown disease to have been HIV/AIDS.
** Hanna R. Hall as young Jenny Curran.
* Gary Sinise as Lieutenant Dan Taylor: Forrest and Bubba Blue&#x27;s platoon leader during the Vietnam War, whose ancestors have died in every U.S. war and who regards it as his destiny to do the same. After losing his legs in an ambush and being rescued against his will by Forrest, he is initially bitter and antagonistic toward Forrest for leaving him a &quot;cripple&quot; and denying him his family&#x27;s destiny, falling into a deep depression. He later serves as Forrest&#x27;s first mate at the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, gives most of the orders, becomes wealthy with Forrest, and regains his will to live. He ultimately forgives and thanks Forrest for saving his life. By the end of the film, he is engaged to be married to his fiancée Susan and is sporting &quot;magic legs&quot; – titanium alloy prosthetics that allow him to walk again.
* Mykelti Williamson as Benjamin Buford &quot;Bubba&quot; Blue: Bubba was originally supposed to be the senior partner in the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, but due to his death in Vietnam, their platoon leader, Dan Taylor, took his place. The company posthumously carried his name. Forrest later gave Bubba&#x27;s mother (Marlena Smalls) Bubba&#x27;s share of the business. Throughout filming, Williamson wore a lip attachment to create Bubba&#x27;s protruding lip.
* Sally Field as Mrs. Gump: Forrest&#x27;s mother. Field reflected on the character, &quot;She&#x27;s a woman who loves her son unconditionally. ... A lot of her dialogue sounds like slogans, and that&#x27;s just what she intends.&quot;
* Haley Joel Osment as Forrest Gump Jr.: Osment was cast in the film after the casting director noticed him in a 1993 Pizza Hut commercial. It was his debut feature film role.
* Peter Dobson as Elvis Presley: Although Kurt Russell was uncredited, he provided the voice for Elvis in the scene.
* Dick Cavett as himself: Cavett played a de-aged version of himself in the 1970s, with makeup applied to make him appear younger. Consequently, Cavett is the only well-known figure in the film to play a cameo role rather than be represented through the use of archival footage like John Lennon, Alabama Governor George Wallace, and Presidents John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, and Richard Nixon.
*Sam Anderson as Principal Hancock: Forrest&#x27;s elementary school principal.
*Geoffrey Blake as Wesley: A member of the SDS group and Jenny&#x27;s abusive boyfriend.
*Siobhan Fallon Hogan as Dorothy Harris: The school bus driver who drives Forrest, and later his son, to school.
* Sonny Shroyer as Coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant.
* Grand L. Bush, Michael Jace, Conor Kennelly, and Teddy Lane Jr. as the Black Panthers.
* Richard D&#x27;Alessandro as Abbie Hoffman.
* Tiffany Salerno and Marla Sucharetza as &quot;Cunning&quot; Carla and &quot;Long-Limbs&quot; Lenore: a couple of prostitutes that Forrest and Dan spend a New Year&#x27;s evening with and later turn away.

== Production ==
=== Pre-production and script ===


The film is based on the 1986 novel by Winston Groom. Both center on the character of Forrest Gump. However, the film primarily focuses on the first eleven chapters of the novel before skipping ahead to the end of the novel, with the founding of Bubba Gump Shrimp Co. and the meeting with Forrest Jr. In addition to skipping some parts of the novel, the film adds several aspects to Gump&#x27;s life that do not occur in the novel, such as his needing leg braces as a child and his run across the United States.

Gump&#x27;s core character and personality are also changed from the novel; among other things, his film character is less of a savant – in the novel, while playing football at the university, he fails craft and gym but receives a perfect score in an advanced physics class he is enrolled in by his coach to satisfy his college requirements. The novel also features Gump as an astronaut, a professional wrestler, and a chess player.

The book had a bidding war regarding an adaptation even before publication, with Wendy Finerman and Steve Tisch acquiring them by joining forces with Warner Bros., where Finerman&#x27;s husband Mark Canton was president of production. Groom was paid $500,000 and also wrote the first three first drafts of the screenplay, which leaned closer to the events of the novel. After &quot;Rain Man&quot; told the story of a savant, Warner Bros. lost interest in the picture, and by 1990 the project was in turnaround. Finerman contacted Columbia Pictures, who went on to reject it, while hiring Eric Roth to rewrite the script. Roth and Finerman kept in contact with Groom to ensure the script was historically accurate. Roth delivered a screenplay in 1992, which Paramount Pictures chairwoman Sherry Lansing liked enough to bring the project to her studio, who acquired the rights from Warner Bros. in exchange for the script for &quot;Executive Decision&quot;.

Ivan Reitman, Penny Marshall and Terry Gilliam passed on the project before Robert Zemeckis was hired. Barry Sonnenfeld was attached to the film, but left to direct &quot;Addams Family Values&quot;.

=== Casting ===
John Travolta was the original choice to play the title role and later said that passing on the role was a mistake. Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, and Matthew Broderick were also considered for the role. Sean Penn had stated in an interview that he had been second choice for the role, but would later portray a character with a disability in the 2001 film &quot;I Am Sam&quot;. Hanks revealed that he signed on to the film after an hour and a half of reading the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest&#x27;s pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel. Hanks also said it took him three days producing unusable footage in order to learn how to play the role. Winston Groom, who wrote the original novel, describes the film as having taken the &quot;rough edges&quot; off the character whom he had envisioned being played by John Goodman. Additionally, Tom&#x27;s younger brother Jim Hanks is his acting double in the movie for the scenes whenever Forrest was running. Tom&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as the girl on the school bus who refuses to let young Forrest sit next to her. Joe Pesci and Kevin Bacon were considered for the role of Lieutenant Dan Taylor, which was eventually given to Gary Sinise. Sinise drew inspiration from the struggles that Vietnam veterans, some on his wife&#x27;s side of his family, were going through when returning from serving in Vietnam. David Alan Grier, Ice Cube and Dave Chappelle were offered the role of Benjamin Buford Blue, but all three turned it down. Chappelle, who said he believed the film would be unsuccessful, has been reported as saying that he regrets not taking the role. Hanks was aware of Chappelle&#x27;s disappointment in missing out on the part and agreed to work with him in a future movie, which ended up being &quot;You&#x27;ve Got Mail&quot;. Rapper Tupac Shakur also auditioned.

=== Filming ===

Filming began in August 1993 and ended in December of that year. Although most of the film is set in Alabama, filming took place mainly in and around Beaufort, South Carolina, as well as parts of coastal Virginia and North Carolina, including a running shot on the Blue Ridge Parkway near Grandfather Mountain where a part of the road subsequently became known as &quot;Forrest Gump Curve&quot;. Downtown portions of the fictional town of Greenbow were filmed in Varnville, South Carolina. The scene of Forrest running through Vietnam while under fire was filmed on Hunting Island State Park and Fripp Island, South Carolina. Additional filming took place on the Biltmore Estate in Asheville, North Carolina. 

The Gump family home set was built along the Combahee River near Yemassee, South Carolina, and the nearby land was used to film Curran&#x27;s home as well as some of the Vietnam scenes. Over 20 palmetto trees were planted to improve the Vietnam scenes. Forrest Gump narrated his life&#x27;s story at the northern edge of Chippewa Square in Savannah, Georgia, as he sat at a bus stop bench. There were other scenes filmed in and around the Savannah area as well, including a running shot on the Richard V. Woods Memorial Bridge in Beaufort while he was being interviewed by the press, and on West Bay Street in Savannah. Most of the college campus scenes were filmed in Los Angeles at the University of Southern California. The lighthouse that Forrest runs across to reach the Atlantic Ocean the first time is the Marshall Point Lighthouse in Port Clyde, Maine. Additional scenes were filmed in Arizona, Utah&#x27;s Monument Valley, and Montana&#x27;s Glacier National Park.

=== Visual effects ===
Ken Ralston and his team at Industrial Light &amp; Magic were responsible for the film&#x27;s visual effects. Using CGI techniques, it was possible to depict Gump meeting deceased personages and shaking their hands. Hanks was first shot against a blue screen along with reference markers so that he could line up with the archive footage. To record the voices of the historical figures, voice actors were filmed and special effects were used to alter lip-syncing for the new dialogue. Archival footage was used and with the help of such techniques as chroma key, image warping, morphing, and rotoscoping, Hanks was integrated into it.

In one Vietnam War scene, Gump carries Bubba away from an incoming napalm attack. To create the effect, stunt actors were initially used for compositing purposes. Then, Hanks and Williamson were filmed, with Williamson supported by a cable wire as Hanks ran with him. The explosion was then filmed, and the actors were digitally added to appear just in front of the explosions. The jet fighters and napalm canisters were also added by CGI.

The CGI removal of actor Gary Sinise&#x27;s legs, after his character had them amputated, was achieved by wrapping his legs with a blue fabric, which later facilitated the work of the &quot;roto-paint&quot; team to paint out his legs from every single frame. At one point, while hoisting himself into his wheelchair, his legs are used for support.

The scene where Forrest spots Jenny at a peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial and Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C., required visual effects to create the large crowd of people. Over two days of filming, approximately 1,500 extras were used. At each successive take, the extras were rearranged and moved into a different quadrant away from the camera. With the help of computers, the extras were multiplied to create a crowd of several hundred thousand people.

== Reception ==

=== Box office ===
Produced on a budget of $55 million, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; opened in 1,332 theaters in the United States and Canada on Wednesday, July 6, 1994, and grossed more than $8 million in its first two days before expanding on Friday to 1,595 theaters and grossing $24,450,602 in its opening weekend, Paramount&#x27;s biggest opening non-holiday weekend gross, surpassing the record set by &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. Motion picture business consultant and screenwriter Jeffrey Hilton suggested to producer Wendy Finerman to double the P&amp;A (film marketing budget) based on his viewing of an early print of the film. The budget was immediately increased, in line with his advice. In its opening weekend, the film placed first at the US box office, narrowly beating &quot;The Lion King&quot;, which was in its fourth week of release. For the first twelve weeks of release, the film was in the top 3 at the US box office, topping the list 5 times, including in its tenth week of release, when it surpassed &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; as Paramount&#x27;s highest grossing film in the United States and Canada. Paramount removed the film from release in the United States when its gross hit $300 million in January 1995, and it was the second-highest-grossing film of the year, behind &quot;The Lion King&quot; with $305 million. The film was reissued on February 17, 1995, after the Academy Awards nominations were announced. After the reissue in 1,100 theaters, the film grossed an additional $29 million in the United States and Canada, bringing its total to $329.7 million, making it the third-highest-grossing film at that time behind only &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; and &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold over 78.5 million tickets in the US and Canada in its initial theatrical run.

The film was the fastest grossing Paramount film to pass $100 million (18 days), $200 million (46 days; fourth fastest in history), and $300 million (193 days) in box office receipts (at the time of its release). After reissues, the film has gross receipts of $330,252,182 in the U.S. and Canada and $347,693,217 in international markets for a total of $677,945,399 worldwide. Ultimately, it finished as the fourth highest grossing film of the 1990s in the United States and Canada. 

Even with such revenue, the film was known as a &quot;successful failure&quot;; due to distributors&#x27; and exhibitors&#x27; high fees, Paramount&#x27;s &quot;losses&quot; clocked in at $62 million, leaving executives realizing the necessity of better deals. This has also been associated with Hollywood accounting, where expenses are inflated to minimize profit sharing.

&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; held the record for being the highest-grossing Paramount film until it was overtaken by &quot;Titanic&quot; three years later in 1997. However, it remained the highest-grossing film solely distributed by Paramount until it was surpassed by &quot;Shrek the Third&quot; 13 years later in 2007. 

For 12 years, it remained as the highest-grossing film starring Tom Hanks; it was surpassed in 2006 by &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;.

=== Critical reception ===
 At the website Metacritic, the film earned a rating of 82 out of 100 based on 21 reviews by mainstream critics, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a rare &quot;A+&quot; grade.

The story was commended by several critics. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; wrote, &quot;I&#x27;ve never met anyone like Forrest Gump in a movie before, and for that matter I&#x27;ve never seen a movie quite like &#x27;Forrest Gump.&#x27; Any attempt to describe him will risk making the movie seem more conventional than it is, but let me try. It&#x27;s a comedy, I guess. Or maybe a drama. Or a dream. The screenplay by Eric Roth has the complexity of modern fiction...The performance is a breathtaking balancing act between comedy and sadness, in a story rich in big laughs and quiet truths...What a magical movie.&quot; Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;has been very well worked out on all levels, and manages the difficult feat of being an intimate, even delicate tale played with an appealingly light touch against an epic backdrop.&quot; In contrast, Anthony Lane of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; called the film &quot;Warm, wise, and wearisome as hell.&quot; Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that the film was &quot;glib, shallow, and monotonous&quot; and &quot;reduces the tumult of the last few decades to a virtual-reality theme park: a baby-boomer version of Disney&#x27;s America.&quot;

Gump garnered comparisons to fictional character Huckleberry Finn, as well as U.S. politicians Ronald Reagan, Pat Buchanan and Bill Clinton. Peter Chomo writes that Gump acts as a &quot;social mediator and as an agent of redemption in divided times&quot;. Peter Travers of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Gump &quot;everything we admire in the American character – honest, brave, and loyal with a heart of gold.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Janet Maslin called Gump a &quot;hollow man&quot; who is &quot;self-congratulatory in his blissful ignorance, warmly embraced as the embodiment of absolutely nothing.&quot; Marc Vincenti of &quot;Palo Alto Weekly&quot; called the character &quot;a pitiful stooge taking the pie of life in the face, thoughtfully licking his fingers.&quot; Bruce Kawin and Gerald Mast&#x27;s textbook on film history notes that Forrest Gump&#x27;s dimness was a metaphor for glamorized nostalgia in that he represented a blank slate onto which the Baby Boomer generation projected their memories of those events.

=== Re-evaluation ===

Writing in 2004, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said, &quot;Nearly a decade after it earned gazillions and swept the Oscars, Robert Zemeckis&#x27; ode to 20th-century America still represents one of cinema&#x27;s most clearly drawn lines in the sand. One half of folks see it as an artificial piece of pop melodrama, while everyone else raves that it&#x27;s sweet as a box of chocolates.&quot;

In 2015, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; polled hundreds of academy members, asking them to re-vote on past controversial decisions. Academy members said that, given a second chance, they would award the 1994 Oscar for Best Picture to &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; instead.

=== Author payment controversy ===

Winston Groom was paid $350,000 for the screenplay rights to his novel &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; and was contracted for a 3 percent share of the film&#x27;s &quot;net&quot; profits. However, Paramount and the film&#x27;s producers did not pay him the percentage, using Hollywood accounting to posit that the blockbuster film lost money. Tom Hanks, by contrast, contracted for a percent share of the film&#x27;s &quot;gross&quot; receipts instead of a salary, and he and director Zemeckis each received $40 million. In addition, Groom was not mentioned once in any of the film&#x27;s six Oscar-winner speeches.

Groom&#x27;s dispute with Paramount was later effectively resolved after Groom declared he was satisfied with Paramount&#x27;s explanation of their accounting, this coinciding with Groom receiving a seven-figure contract with Paramount for film rights to another of his books, &quot;Gump &amp; Co.&quot; This film was never made, remaining in development hell for at least a dozen years.

=== Home video ===

&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was first released on VHS on April 27, 1995, and on Laserdisc the following day. The laserdisc was THX certified and released without chapters, requiring the film be watched start to finish. Film magazines of the period stated this was at the request of Zemeckis who wanted viewers to enjoy the film in its entirety. It became the best-selling adult sell-through video with sales of over 12 million. 
A widescreen VHS release debuted a year later on September 10, 1996. It was released in a two-disc DVD set on August 28, 2001. Special features included director and producer commentaries, production featurettes, and screen tests. The film was released on Blu-ray in November 2009. Paramount released the film on Ultra HD Blu-ray in June 2018. On May 7, 2019, Paramount Pictures released a newly remastered two-disc Blu-ray that contains bonus content.

=== Accolades ===
&quot;Forrest Gump&quot; won Best Picture, Best Actor in a Leading Role (Hanks had won the previous year for &quot;Philadelphia&quot;), Best Director, Best Visual Effects, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Film Editing at the 67th Academy Awards. The film was nominated for seven Golden Globe Awards, winning three of them: Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama, Best Director – Motion Picture, and Best Motion Picture – Drama. The film was also nominated for six Saturn Awards and won two for Best Fantasy Film and Best Supporting Actor (Film).

In addition to the film&#x27;s multiple awards and nominations, it has also been recognized by the American Film Institute on several of its lists. The film ranks 37th on &quot;100 Years...100 Cheers&quot;, 71st on &quot;100 Years...100 Movies&quot;, and 76th on &quot;100 Years...100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition)&quot;. In addition, the quote &quot;Mama always said life was like a box of chocolates. You never know what you&#x27;re gonna get,&quot; was ranked 40th on &quot;100 Years...100 Movie Quotes&quot;. The film also ranked at number 61 on &quot;Empire&quot;″s list of the 100 Greatest Movies of All Time.

In December 2011, &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; was selected for preservation in the Library of Congress&#x27; National Film Registry. The Registry said that the film was &quot;honored for its technological innovations (the digital insertion of Gump seamlessly into vintage archival footage), its resonance within the culture that has elevated Gump (and what he represents in terms of American innocence) to the status of folk hero, and its attempt to engage both playfully and seriously with contentious aspects of the era&#x27;s traumatic history.&quot;

== Symbolism ==
=== Feather ===

Various interpretations have been suggested for the feather present at the opening and conclusion of the film. Sarah Lyall of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted several suggestions made about the feather: &quot;Does the white feather symbolize The Unbearable Lightness of Being? Forrest Gump&#x27;s impaired intellect? The randomness of experience?&quot; Hanks interpreted the feather as: &quot;Our destiny is only defined by how we deal with the chance elements to our life and that&#x27;s kind of the embodiment of the feather as it comes in. Here is this thing that can land anywhere and that it lands at your feet. It has theological implications that are really huge.&quot; Sally Field compared the feather to fate, saying: &quot;It blows in the wind and just touches down here or there. Was it planned or was it just perchance?&quot; Visual effects supervisor Ken Ralston compared the feather to an abstract painting: &quot;It can mean so many things to so many different people.&quot;

=== Political interpretations ===

Hanks states that &quot;the film is non-political and thus non-judgmental&quot;. Nevertheless, CNN&#x27;s &quot;Crossfire&quot; debated in 1994 whether the film promoted conservative values or was an indictment of the counterculture of the 1960s. Thomas Byers called it &quot;an aggressively conservative film&quot; in a &quot;Modern Fiction Studies&quot; article.
It has been noted that while Gump follows a very conservative lifestyle, Jenny&#x27;s life is full of countercultural embrace, complete with drug use, promiscuity, and antiwar rallies, and that their eventual marriage might be a kind of reconciliation. Jennifer Hyland Wang argues in a &quot;Cinema Journal&quot; article that Jenny&#x27;s death to an unnamed virus &quot;symbolizes the death of liberal America and the death of the protests that defined a decade&quot; in the 1960s. She also notes that the film&#x27;s screenwriter, Eric Roth, developed the screenplay from the novel and transferred to Jenny &quot;all of Gump&#x27;s flaws and most of the excesses committed by Americans in the 1960s and 1970s&quot;.

Other commentators believe the film forecast the 1994 Republican Revolution and used the image of Forrest Gump to promote movement leader Newt Gingrich&#x27;s traditional, conservative values. Jennifer Hyland Wang observes that the film idealizes the 1950s, as made evident by the lack of &quot;Whites Only&quot;-signs in Gump&#x27;s Southern childhood, and envisions the 1960s as a period of social conflict and confusion. She argues that this sharp contrast between the decades criticizes the counterculture values and reaffirms conservatism. Wang argues that the film was used by Republican politicians to illustrate a &quot;traditional version of recent history&quot; to gear voters toward their ideology for the congressional elections. Presidential candidate Bob Dole stated that the film&#x27;s message was &quot;no matter how great the adversity, the American Dream is within everybody&#x27;s reach&quot;.

In 1995, &quot;National Review&quot; included &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; in its list of the &quot;Best 100 Conservative Movies&quot; of all time, and ranked it number four on its &quot;25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years&quot; list. &quot;National Review&quot;&#x27;s John Miller wrote that &quot;Tom Hanks plays the title-character, an amiable dunce who is far too smart to embrace the lethal values of the 1960s. The love of his life, wonderfully played by Robin Wright Penn, chooses a different path; she becomes a drug-addled hippie, with disastrous results.&quot;

Professor James Burton at Salisbury University argues that conservatives claimed &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; as their own due less to the content of the film and more to the historical and cultural context of 1994. Burton claims that the film&#x27;s content and advertising campaign were affected by the cultural climate of the 1990s, which emphasized family values and American values, epitomized in the book &quot;Hollywood vs. America&quot;. He claims that this climate influenced the apolitical nature of the film, which allowed many different political interpretations.

Some commentators see the conservative readings of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; as indicating the death of irony in American culture. Vivian Sobchack notes that the film&#x27;s humor and irony rely on the assumption of the audience&#x27;s historical knowledge.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack, featuring 32 songs from the film, was released on July 6, 1994. With the exception of a lengthy suite of themes from Alan Silvestri&#x27;s original score, all the songs are previously released. Among the artists featured in the film are Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan, Hank Williams, Creedence Clearwater Revival, Aretha Franklin, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Three Dog Night, The Byrds, The Beach Boys, The Jimi Hendrix Experience, The Doors, Canned Heat, Harry Nilsson, The Mamas &amp; the Papas, The Doobie Brothers, Simon &amp; Garfunkel, Bob Seger, Randy Newman, Willie Nelson, Fleetwood Mac, KC &amp; The Sunshine Band, and Buffalo Springfield. Reflecting on compiling the soundtrack, music producer Joel Sill stated &quot;We wanted to have very recognizable material that would pinpoint time periods, yet we didn&#x27;t want to interfere with what was happening cinematically.&quot; The film and the two-disc album have a variety of music from the 1950s to the 1980s performed by American artists. According to Sill, Zemeckis requested this because he thought that American music was the only kind of music Forrest would buy, further stating &quot;All the material in there is American. Bob (Zemeckis) felt strongly about it. He felt that Forrest wouldn&#x27;t buy anything but American.&quot;

The soundtrack reached a peak of number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. The soundtrack went on to sell twelve million copies, and is one of the top selling albums in the US. The Oscar-nominated score for the film was composed and conducted by Alan Silvestri and released on August 2, 1994.

== Adaptations ==

=== Novel-sequel ===
The screenplay for the sequel was written by Eric Roth in 2001. It is based on the original novel&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Gump and Co.&quot;, written by Winston Groom in 1995. Roth&#x27;s script begins with Forrest sitting on a bench waiting for his son to return from school. After the September 11 attacks, Roth, Zemeckis, and Hanks decided the story was no longer &quot;relevant.&quot; In March 2007, however, it was reported Paramount producers took another look at the screenplay.

On the first page of the sequel novel, Forrest Gump tells readers &quot;Don&#x27;t never let nobody make a movie of your life&#x27;s story,&quot; and &quot;Whether they get it right or wrong, it doesn&#x27;t matter.&quot; The first chapter of the book suggests the real-life events surrounding the film have been incorporated into Forrest&#x27;s storyline, and that Forrest got a lot of media attention as a result of the film. During the course of the sequel novel, Gump runs into Tom Hanks and at the end of the novel in the film&#x27;s release, includes Gump going on &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; and attending the Academy Awards.

=== Indian remake ===
The Indian film &quot;Laal Singh Chaddha&quot;, released in August 2022 and starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor in the title role, is an authorized remake of &quot;Forrest Gump&quot;, set in India between the late 1970s and the 2010s. The film was directed by Advait Chandan and produced by Aamir Khan Productions, Viacom18 Studios and Paramount Pictures.

=== Fake sequel trailers ===
Following the advent of AI video editing, several fake trailers were created and gained attention, some featuring an older Tom Hanks costarring with actors like Tom Holland or Timothée Chalamet. Hanks himself has said that he is glad that a sequel was never made, given the completeness of the original film.

<text>Stanisław Marcin Ulam ( ; 13 April 1909 – 13 May 1984) was a Polish mathematician, nuclear physicist and computer scientist. He participated in the Manhattan Project, originated the Teller–Ulam design of thermonuclear weapons, discovered the concept of the cellular automaton, invented the Monte Carlo method of computation, and suggested nuclear pulse propulsion. In pure and applied mathematics, he proved a number of theorems and proposed several conjectures.

Born into a wealthy Polish Jewish family in Lemberg, Austria-Hungary; Ulam studied mathematics at the Lwów Polytechnic Institute, where he earned his PhD in 1933 under the supervision of Kazimierz Kuratowski and Włodzimierz Stożek. In 1935, John von Neumann, whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, for a few months. From 1936 to 1939, he spent summers in Poland and academic years at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he worked to establish important results regarding ergodic theory. On 20 August 1939, he sailed for the United States for the last time with his 17-year-old brother Adam Ulam. He became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1940, and a United States citizen in 1941.

In October 1943, he received an invitation from Hans Bethe to join the Manhattan Project at the secret Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico. There, he worked on the hydrodynamic calculations to predict the behavior of the explosive lenses that were needed by an implosion-type weapon. He was assigned to Edward Teller&#x27;s group, where he worked on Teller&#x27;s &quot;Super&quot; bomb for Teller and Enrico Fermi. After the war he left to become an associate professor at the University of Southern California, but returned to Los Alamos in 1946 to work on thermonuclear weapons. With the aid of a cadre of female &quot;computers&quot; he found that Teller&#x27;s &quot;Super&quot; design was unworkable. In January 1951, Ulam and Teller came up with the Teller–Ulam design, which became the basis for all thermonuclear weapons.

Ulam considered the problem of nuclear propulsion of rockets, which was pursued by Project Rover, and proposed, as an alternative to Rover&#x27;s nuclear thermal rocket, to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion, which became Project Orion. With Fermi, John Pasta, and Mary Tsingou, Ulam studied the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem, which became the inspiration for the field of nonlinear science. He is probably best known for realizing that electronic computers made it practical to apply statistical methods to functions without known solutions, and as computers have developed, the Monte Carlo method has become a common and standard approach to many problems.

==Poland==
Ulam was born in Lemberg, Galicia, on 13 April 1909. At this time, Galicia was in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which was known to Poles as the Austrian partition. In 1918, it became part of the newly restored Poland, the Second Polish Republic, and the city took its Polish name again, Lwów.

The Ulams were a wealthy Polish Jewish family of bankers, industrialists, and other professionals. Ulam&#x27;s immediate family was &quot;well-to-do but hardly rich&quot;. His father, Józef Ulam, was born in Lwów and was a lawyer, and his mother, Anna (née Auerbach), was born in Stryj. His uncle, Michał Ulam, was an architect, building contractor, and lumber industrialist. From 1916 until 1918, Józef&#x27;s family lived temporarily in Vienna. After they returned, Lwów became the epicenter of the Polish–Ukrainian War, during which the city experienced a Ukrainian siege.
In 1919, Ulam entered Lwów Gymnasium Nr. VII, from which he graduated in 1927. He then studied mathematics at the Lwów Polytechnic Institute. Under the supervision of Kazimierz Kuratowski, he received his Master of Arts degree in 1932, and became a Doctor of Science in 1933. At the age of 20, in 1929, he published his first paper &quot;Concerning Function of Sets&quot; in the journal &quot;Fundamenta Mathematicae&quot;. From 1931 until 1935, he traveled to and studied in Wilno (Vilnius), Vienna, Zürich, Paris, and Cambridge, England, where he met G. H. Hardy and Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar.

Along with Stanisław Mazur, Mark Kac, Włodzimierz Stożek, Kuratowski, and others, Ulam was a member of the Lwów School of Mathematics. Its founders were Hugo Steinhaus and Stefan Banach, who were professors at the Jan Kazimierz University. Mathematicians of this &quot;school&quot; met for long hours at the Scottish Café, where the problems they discussed were collected in the Scottish Book, a thick notebook provided by Banach&#x27;s wife. Ulam was a major contributor to the book. Of the 193 problems recorded between 1935 and 1941, he contributed 40 problems as a single author, another 11 with Banach and Mazur, and an additional 15 with others. In 1957, he received from Steinhaus a copy of the book, which had survived the war, and translated it into English. In 1981, Ulam&#x27;s friend R. Daniel Mauldin published an expanded and annotated version.

==Move to the United States==
In 1935, John von Neumann, whom Ulam had met in Warsaw, invited him to come to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, for a few months. In December of that year, Ulam sailed to the US. At Princeton, he went to lectures and seminars, where he heard Oswald Veblen, James Alexander, and Albert Einstein. During a tea party at von Neumann&#x27;s house, he encountered G. D. Birkhoff, who suggested that he apply for a position with the Harvard Society of Fellows. Following up on Birkhoff&#x27;s suggestion, Ulam spent summers in Poland and academic years at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts from 1936 to 1939, where he worked with John C. Oxtoby to establish results regarding ergodic theory. These appeared in &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; in 1941. In 1938, Stanislaw&#x27;s mother Anna Hanna Ulam (née Auerbach) died of cancer.

On 20 August 1939, in Gdynia, Józef Ulam, along with his brother Szymon, put his two sons, Stanislaw and 17-year-old Adam, on a ship headed for the US. Eleven days later, the Germans invaded Poland. Within two months, the Germans completed their occupation of western Poland, and the Soviets invaded and occupied eastern Poland. Within two years, Józef Ulam and the rest of his family, including Stanislaw&#x27;s sister Stefania Ulam, were victims of the Holocaust, Hugo Steinhaus was in hiding, Kazimierz Kuratowski was lecturing at the underground university in Warsaw, Włodzimierz Stożek and his two sons had been killed in the massacre of Lwów professors, and the last problem had been recorded in the Scottish Book. Stefan Banach survived the Nazi occupation by feeding lice at Rudolf Weigl&#x27;s typhus research institute. In 1963, Adam Ulam, who had become an eminent kremlinologist at Harvard, received a letter from George Volsky, who hid in Józef Ulam&#x27;s house after deserting from the Polish army. This reminiscence gave a chilling account of Lwów&#x27;s chaotic scenes in late 1939. In later life Ulam described himself as &quot;an agnostic. Sometimes I muse deeply on the forces that are for me invisible. When I am almost close to the idea of God, I feel immediately estranged by the horrors of this world, which he seems to tolerate&quot;.

In 1940, after being recommended by Birkhoff, Ulam became an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Here, he became a United States citizen in 1941. That year, he married Françoise Aron. She had been a French exchange student at Mount Holyoke College, whom he met in Cambridge. They had one daughter, Claire. In Madison, Ulam met his friend and colleague C. J. Everett, with whom he collaborated on a number of papers.

==Manhattan Project==

In early 1943, Ulam asked von Neumann to find him a war job. In October, he received an invitation to join an unidentified project near Santa Fe, New Mexico. The letter was signed by Hans Bethe, who had been appointed as leader of the theoretical division of Los Alamos National Laboratory by Robert Oppenheimer, its scientific director. Knowing nothing of the area, he borrowed a New Mexico guide book. On the checkout card, he found the names of his Wisconsin colleagues, Joan Hinton, David Frisch, and Joseph McKibben, all of whom had mysteriously disappeared. This was Ulam&#x27;s introduction to the Manhattan Project, which was the US&#x27;s wartime effort to create the atomic bomb.

===Hydrodynamical calculations of implosion===
A few weeks after Ulam reached Los Alamos in February 1944, the project experienced a crisis. In April, Emilio Segrè discovered that plutonium made in reactors would not work in a gun-type plutonium weapon like the &quot;Thin Man&quot;, which was being developed in parallel with a uranium weapon, the &quot;Little Boy&quot; that was dropped on Hiroshima. This problem threatened to waste an enormous investment in new reactors at the Hanford site and to make slow uranium isotope separation the only way to prepare fissile material suitable for use in bombs. To respond, Oppenheimer implemented, in August, a sweeping reorganization of the laboratory to focus on development of an implosion-type weapon and appointed George Kistiakowsky head of the implosion department. He was a professor at Harvard and an expert on precise use of explosives.

The basic concept of implosion is to use chemical explosives to crush a chunk of fissile material into a critical mass, where neutron multiplication leads to a nuclear chain reaction, releasing a large amount of energy. Cylindrical implosive configurations had been studied by Seth Neddermeyer, but von Neumann, who had experience with shaped charges used in armor-piercing ammunition, was a vocal advocate of spherical implosion driven by explosive lenses. He realized that the symmetry and speed with which implosion compressed the plutonium were critical issues, and enlisted Ulam to help design lens configurations that would provide nearly spherical implosion. Within an implosion, because of enormous pressures and high temperatures, solid materials behave much like fluids. This meant that hydrodynamical calculations were needed to predict and minimize asymmetries that would spoil a nuclear detonation. Of these calculations, Ulam said:

Nevertheless, with the primitive facilities available at the time, Ulam and von Neumann did carry out numerical computations that led to a satisfactory design. This motivated their advocacy of a powerful computational capability at Los Alamos, which began during the war years, continued through the cold war, and still exists. Otto Frisch remembered Ulam as &quot;a brilliant Polish topologist with a charming French wife. At once he told me that he was a pure mathematician who had sunk so low that his latest paper actually contained numbers with decimal points!&quot;

===Statistics of branching and multiplicative processes===
Even the inherent statistical fluctuations of neutron multiplication within a chain reaction have implications with regard to implosion speed and symmetry. In November 1944, David Hawkins and Ulam addressed this problem in a report entitled &quot;Theory of Multiplicative Processes&quot;. This report, which invokes probability-generating functions, is also an early entry in the extensive literature on statistics of branching and multiplicative processes. In 1948, its scope was extended by Ulam and Everett.

Early in the Manhattan project, Enrico Fermi&#x27;s attention was focused on the use of reactors to produce plutonium. In September 1944, he arrived at Los Alamos, shortly after breathing life into the first Hanford reactor, which had been poisoned by a xenon isotope. Soon after Fermi&#x27;s arrival, Teller&#x27;s &quot;Super&quot; bomb group, of which Ulam was a part, was transferred to a new division headed by Fermi. Fermi and Ulam formed a relationship that became very fruitful after the war.

==Post war Los Alamos==
In September 1945, Ulam left Los Alamos to become an associate professor at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. In January 1946, he suffered an acute attack of encephalitis, which put his life in danger, but which was alleviated by emergency brain surgery. During his recuperation, many friends visited, including Nicholas Metropolis from Los Alamos and the famous mathematician Paul Erdős, who remarked: &quot;Stan, you are just like before.&quot; This was encouraging, because Ulam was concerned about the state of his mental faculties, for he had lost the ability to speak during the crisis. Another friend, Gian-Carlo Rota, asserted in a 1987 article that the attack changed Ulam&#x27;s personality: afterwards, he turned from rigorous pure mathematics to more speculative conjectures concerning the application of mathematics to physics and biology; Rota also cites Ulam&#x27;s former collaborator Paul Stein as noting that Ulam was sloppier in his clothing afterwards, and John Oxtoby as noting that Ulam before the encephalitis could work for hours on end doing calculations, while when Rota worked with him, was reluctant to solve even a quadratic equation. This assertion was not accepted by Françoise Aron Ulam.

By late April 1946, Ulam had recovered enough to attend a secret conference at Los Alamos to discuss thermonuclear weapons. Those in attendance included Ulam, von Neumann, Metropolis, Teller, Stan Frankel, and others. Throughout his participation in the Manhattan Project, Teller&#x27;s efforts had been directed toward the development of a &quot;super&quot; weapon based on nuclear fusion, rather than toward development of a practical fission bomb. After extensive discussion, the participants reached a consensus that his ideas were worthy of further exploration. A few weeks later, Ulam received an offer of a position at Los Alamos from Metropolis and Robert D. Richtmyer, the new head of its theoretical division, at a higher salary, and the Ulams returned to Los Alamos.

===Monte Carlo method===

Late in the war, under the sponsorship of von Neumann, Frankel and Metropolis began to carry out calculations on the first general-purpose electronic computer, the ENIAC at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Shortly after returning to Los Alamos, Ulam participated in a review of results from these calculations. Earlier, while playing solitaire during his recovery from surgery, Ulam had thought about playing hundreds of games to estimate statistically the probability of a successful outcome. With ENIAC in mind, he realized that the availability of computers made such statistical methods very practical. John von Neumann immediately saw the significance of this insight. In March 1947 he proposed a statistical approach to the problem of neutron diffusion in fissionable material. Because Ulam had often mentioned his uncle, Michał Ulam, &quot;who just had to go to Monte Carlo&quot; to gamble, Metropolis dubbed the statistical approach &quot;The Monte Carlo method&quot;. Metropolis and Ulam published the first unclassified paper on the Monte Carlo method in 1949.

Fermi, learning of Ulam&#x27;s breakthrough, devised an analog computer known as the Monte Carlo trolley, later dubbed the FERMIAC. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results can be very accurate.

===Teller–Ulam design===
On 29 August 1949, the Soviet Union tested its first fission bomb, the RDS-1. Created under the supervision of Lavrentiy Beria, who sought to duplicate the US effort, this weapon was nearly identical to Fat Man, for its design was based on information provided by spies Klaus Fuchs, Theodore Hall, and David Greenglass. In response, on 31 January 1950, President Harry S. Truman announced a crash program to develop a fusion bomb.

To advocate an aggressive development program, Ernest Lawrence and Luis Alvarez came to Los Alamos, where they conferred with Norris Bradbury, the laboratory director, and with George Gamow, Edward Teller, and Ulam. Soon, these three became members of a short-lived committee appointed by Bradbury to study the problem, with Teller as chairman. At this time, research on the use of a fission weapon to create a fusion reaction had been ongoing since 1942, but the design was still essentially the one originally proposed by Teller. His concept was to put tritium and/or deuterium in close proximity to a fission bomb, with the hope that the heat and intense flux of neutrons released when the bomb exploded, would ignite a self-sustaining fusion reaction. Reactions of these isotopes of hydrogen are of interest because the energy per unit mass of fuel released by their fusion is much larger than that from fission of heavy nuclei.
Because the results of calculations based on Teller&#x27;s concept were discouraging, many scientists believed it could not lead to a successful weapon, while others had moral and economic grounds for not proceeding. Consequently, several senior people of the Manhattan Project opposed development, including Bethe and Oppenheimer. To clarify the situation, Ulam and von Neumann resolved to do new calculations to determine whether Teller&#x27;s approach was feasible. To carry out these studies, von Neumann decided to use electronic computers: ENIAC at Aberdeen, a new computer, MANIAC, at Princeton, and its twin, which was under construction at Los Alamos. Ulam enlisted Everett to follow a completely different approach, one guided by physical intuition. Françoise Ulam was one of a cadre of women &quot;computers&quot; who carried out laborious and extensive computations of thermonuclear scenarios on mechanical calculators, supplemented and confirmed by Everett&#x27;s slide rule. Ulam and Fermi collaborated on further analysis of these scenarios. The results showed that, in workable configurations, a thermonuclear reaction would not ignite, and if ignited, it would not be self-sustaining. Ulam had used his expertise in combinatorics to analyze the chain reaction in deuterium, which was much more complicated than the ones in uranium and plutonium, and he concluded that no self-sustaining chain reaction would take place at the (low) densities that Teller was considering. In late 1950, these conclusions were confirmed by von Neumann&#x27;s results.

In January 1951, Ulam had another idea: to channel the mechanical shock of a nuclear explosion so as to compress the fusion fuel. On the recommendation of his wife, Ulam discussed this idea with Bradbury and Mark before he told Teller about it. Almost immediately, Teller saw its merit, but noted that soft X-rays from the fission bomb would compress the thermonuclear fuel more strongly than mechanical shock and suggested ways to enhance this effect. On 9 March 1951, Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report describing these innovations. A few weeks later, Teller suggested placing a fissile rod or cylinder at the center of the fusion fuel. The detonation of this &quot;spark plug&quot; would help to initiate and enhance the fusion reaction. The design based on these ideas, called staged radiation implosion, has become the standard way to build thermonuclear weapons. It is often described as the &quot;Teller–Ulam design&quot;.
In September 1951, after a series of differences with Bradbury and other scientists, Teller resigned from Los Alamos, and returned to the University of Chicago. At about the same time, Ulam went on leave as a visiting professor at Harvard for a semester. Although Teller and Ulam submitted a joint report on their design and jointly applied for a patent on it, they soon became involved in a dispute over who deserved credit. After the war, Bethe returned to Cornell University, but he was deeply involved in the development of thermonuclear weapons as a consultant. In 1954, he wrote an article on the history of the H-bomb, which presents his opinion that both men contributed very significantly to the breakthrough. This balanced view is shared by others who were involved, including Mark and Fermi, but Teller persistently attempted to downplay Ulam&#x27;s role. &quot;After the H-bomb was made,&quot; Bethe recalled, &quot;reporters started to call Teller the father of the H-bomb. For the sake of history, I think it is more precise to say that Ulam is the father, because he provided the seed, and Teller is the mother, because he remained with the child. As for me, I guess I am the midwife.&quot;

With the basic fusion reactions confirmed, and with a feasible design in hand, there was nothing to prevent Los Alamos from testing a thermonuclear device. On 1 November 1952, the first thermonuclear explosion occurred when Ivy Mike was detonated on Enewetak Atoll, within the US Pacific Proving Grounds. This device, which used liquid deuterium as its fusion fuel, was immense and utterly unusable as a weapon. Nevertheless, its success validated the Teller–Ulam design, and stimulated intensive development of practical weapons.

===Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem===

When Ulam returned to Los Alamos, his attention turned away from weapon design and toward the use of computers to investigate problems in physics and mathematics. With John Pasta, who helped Metropolis to bring MANIAC on line in March 1952, he explored these ideas in a report &quot;Heuristic Studies in Problems of Mathematical Physics on High Speed Computing Machines&quot;, which was submitted on 9 June 1953. It treated several problems that cannot be addressed within the framework of traditional analytic methods: billowing of fluids, rotational motion in gravitating systems, magnetic lines of force, and hydrodynamic instabilities.

Soon, Pasta and Ulam became experienced with electronic computation on MANIAC, and by this time, Enrico Fermi had settled into a routine of spending academic years at the University of Chicago and summers at Los Alamos. During these summer visits, Pasta, Ulam, and Mary Tsingou, a programmer in the MANIAC group, joined him to study a variation of the classic problem of a string of masses held together by springs that exert forces linearly proportional to their displacement from equilibrium. Fermi proposed to add to this force a nonlinear component, which could be chosen to be proportional to either the square or cube of the displacement, or to a more complicated &quot;broken linear&quot; function. This addition is the key element of the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem, which is often designated by the abbreviation FPUT.

A classical spring system can be described in terms of vibrational modes, which are analogous to the harmonics that occur on a stretched violin string. If the system starts in a particular mode, vibrations in other modes do not develop. With the nonlinear component, Fermi expected energy in one mode to transfer gradually to other modes, and eventually, to be distributed equally among all modes. This is roughly what began to happen shortly after the system was initialized with all its energy in the lowest mode, but much later, essentially all the energy periodically reappeared in the lowest mode. This behavior is very different from the expected equipartition of energy. It remained mysterious until 1965, when Kruskal and Zabusky showed that, after appropriate mathematical transformations, the system can be described by the Korteweg–de Vries equation, which is the prototype of nonlinear partial differential equations that have soliton solutions. This means that FPUT behavior can be understood in terms of solitons.

===Nuclear propulsion===

Starting in 1955, Ulam and Frederick Reines considered nuclear propulsion of aircraft and rockets. This is an attractive possibility, because the nuclear energy per unit mass of fuel is a million times greater than that available from chemicals. From 1955 to 1972, their ideas were pursued during Project Rover, which explored the use of nuclear reactors to power rockets. In response to a question by Senator John O. Pastore at a congressional committee hearing on &quot;Outer Space Propulsion by Nuclear Energy&quot;, on January 22, 1958, Ulam replied that &quot;the future as a whole of mankind is to some extent involved inexorably now with going outside the globe.&quot;

Ulam and C. J. Everett also proposed, in contrast to Rover&#x27;s continuous heating of rocket exhaust, to harness small nuclear explosions for propulsion. Project Orion was a study of this idea. It began in 1958 and ended in 1965, after the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty of 1963 banned nuclear weapons tests in the atmosphere and in space. Work on this project was spearheaded by physicist Freeman Dyson, who commented on the decision to end Orion in his article, &quot;Death of a Project&quot;.

Bradbury appointed Ulam and John H. Manley as research advisors to the laboratory director in 1957. These newly created positions were on the same administrative level as division leaders, and Ulam held his until he retired from Los Alamos. In this capacity, he was able to influence and guide programs in many divisions: theoretical, physics, chemistry, metallurgy, weapons, health, Rover, and others.

In addition to these activities, Ulam continued to publish technical reports and research papers. One of these introduced the Fermi–Ulam model, an extension of Fermi&#x27;s theory of the acceleration of cosmic rays. Another, with Paul Stein and Mary Tsingou, titled &quot;Quadratic Transformations&quot;, was an early investigation of chaos theory and is considered the first published use of the phrase &quot;chaotic behavior&quot;.
==Return to academia==

During his years at Los Alamos, Ulam was a visiting professor at Harvard from 1951 to 1952, MIT from 1956 to 1957, the University of California, San Diego, in 1963, and the University of Colorado at Boulder from 1961 to 1962 and 1965 to 1967. In 1967, the last of these positions became permanent, when Ulam was appointed Professor and Chairman of the Department of Mathematics at the University of Colorado. He kept a residence in Santa Fe, which made it convenient to spend summers at Los Alamos as a consultant. He was an elected member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

In Colorado, where he rejoined his friends Gamow, Richtmyer, and Hawkins, Ulam&#x27;s research interests turned toward biology. In 1968, recognizing this emphasis, the University of Colorado School of Medicine appointed Ulam as Professor of Biomathematics, and he held this position until his death. With his Los Alamos colleague Robert Schrandt he published a report, &quot;Some Elementary Attempts at Numerical Modeling of Problems Concerning Rates of Evolutionary Processes&quot;, which applied his earlier ideas on branching processes to evolution. Another, report, with William Beyer, Temple F. Smith, and M. L. Stein, titled &quot;Metrics in Biology&quot;, introduced new ideas about numerical taxonomy and evolutionary distances.

When he retired from Colorado in 1975, Ulam began to spend winter semesters at the University of Florida, where he was a graduate research professor. In 1976, he was awarded the Commander&#x27;s Cross with the Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta by the Polish government-in-exile in London. Except for sabbaticals at the University of California, Davis from 1982 to 1983, and at Rockefeller University from 1980 to 1984, this pattern of spending summers in Colorado and Los Alamos and winters in Florida continued until Ulam died of an apparent heart attack in Santa Fe on 13 May 1984.
Paul Erdős noted that &quot;he died suddenly of heart failure, without fear or pain, while he could still prove and conjecture.&quot; In 1987, Françoise Ulam deposited his papers with the American Philosophical Society Library in Philadelphia. She continued to live in Santa Fe until she died in 2011, at the age of 93. Both Françoise and her husband were buried with her family in Montparnasse Cemetery in Paris.

==Challenge to economics==
Alfred Marshall and his disciples dominated economic theory until the end of WWII. With the Cold War, the theory changed, emphasizing that a market economy was superior and the only sensible way. In Paul Samuelson&#x27;s &quot;Economics: An Introductory Analysis&quot;, 1948, Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;invisible hand&quot; was only a footnote. In later editions, it became the central theme. As Samuelson remembers, all this was challenged by Stanislaw Ulam: [Y]ears ago... I was in the Society of Fellows at Harvard along with the mathematician Stanislaw Ulam. Ulam, who was to become an originator of the Monte Carlo method and co-discoverer of the hydrogen-bomb... used to tease me by saying, &#x27;Name me one proposition in all of the social sciences which is both true and non-trivial.&#x27; This was the test that I always failed. But now, some thirty years later ... an appropriate answer occurs to me: The Ricardian theory of comparative advantage ... That it is logically true need not be argued before a mathematician; that it is not trivial is attested by the thousands of important and intelligent men who have never been able to grasp the doctrine for themselves or to believe it after it was explained to them.
==Coining of the term &quot;singularity&quot;==
Ulam reported in 1958 an earlier discussion with John von Neumann &quot;centered on the accelerating progress of technology and changes in human life, which gives the appearance of approaching some essential singularity in the history of the race beyond which human affairs, as we know them, could not continue&quot;. It is the first recorded use of the term.

==Impact and legacy==
Ulam participated in the creation of a hydrogen bomb as part of the Los Alamos Laboratory nuclear project. From the publication of his first paper as a student in 1929 until his death, Ulam was constantly writing on mathematics. The list of Ulam&#x27;s publications includes more than 150 papers. Topics represented by a significant number of papers are: set theory (including measurable cardinals and abstract measures), topology, functional analysis, transformation theory, ergodic theory, group theory, projective algebra, number theory, combinatorics, and graph theory.

Notable results of this work are:
*Borsuk–Ulam theorem
*Mazur–Ulam theorem
*Kuratowski–Ulam theorem
*Hyers–Ulam–Rassias stability
*Lucky number
*Ulam spiral

*Ulam conjecture (in Number Theory)
*Ulam conjecture (in Graph theory)
*Ulam&#x27;s packing conjecture
*Ulam&#x27;s game
*Ulam matrix
*Ulam numbers
Ulam played pivotal role in the development of thermonuclear weapons. According to Françoise Ulam: &quot;Stan would reassure me that, barring accidents, the H-bomb rendered nuclear war impossible.&quot; In 1980, Ulam and his wife appeared in the television documentary &quot;The Day After Trinity&quot;.
The Monte Carlo method has become a ubiquitous and standard approach to computation, and the method has been applied to a vast number of scientific problems. In addition to problems in physics and mathematics, the method has been applied to finance, social science, environmental risk assessment, linguistics, radiation therapy, and sports.

The Fermi–Pasta–Ulam–Tsingou problem is credited not only as &quot;the birth of experimental mathematics&quot;, but also as inspiration for the vast field of Nonlinear Science. In his Lilienfeld Prize lecture, David K. Campbell noted this relationship and described how FPUT gave rise to ideas in chaos, solitons, and dynamical systems. In 1980, Donald Kerr, laboratory director at Los Alamos, with the strong support of Ulam and Mark Kac, founded the Center for Nonlinear Studies (CNLS). In 1985, CNLS initiated the &quot;Stanislaw M. Ulam Distinguished Scholar&quot; program, which provides an annual award that enables a noted scientist to spend a year carrying out research at Los Alamos.

The fiftieth anniversary of the original FPUT paper was the subject of the March 2005 issue of the journal Chaos, and the topic of the 25th Annual International Conference of CNLS. The University of Southern Mississippi and the University of Florida supported the &quot;Ulam Quarterly&quot;, which was active from 1992 to 1996, and which was one of the first online mathematical journals. Florida&#x27;s Department of Mathematics has sponsored, since 1998, the annual &quot;Ulam Colloquium Lecture&quot;, and in March 2009, the &quot;Ulam Centennial Conference&quot;.

Ulam&#x27;s work on non-Euclidean distance metrics in the context of molecular biology made a significant contribution to sequence analysis and his contributions in theoretical biology are considered watersheds in the development of cellular automata theory, population biology, pattern recognition, and biometrics generally (David Sankoff, however, challenged conclusions of Walter by writing that Ulam had only modest influence on early development of sequence alignment methods.). Colleagues noted that some of his greatest contributions were in clearly identifying problems to be solved and general techniques for solving them.

In 1987, Los Alamos issued a special issue of its &quot;Science&quot; publication, which summarized his accomplishments, and which appeared, in 1989, as the book &quot;From Cardinals to Chaos&quot;. Similarly, in 1990, the University of California Press issued a compilation of mathematical reports by Ulam and his Los Alamos collaborators: &quot;Analogies Between Analogies&quot;. During his career, Ulam was awarded honorary degrees by the Universities of New Mexico, Wisconsin, and Pittsburgh.

In 2021, German film director Thorsten Klein made a film adaptation of the book &quot;Adventures of a Mathematician&quot; about Ulam&#x27;s life.

Ulam is the grandfather of Rebecca Weiner, the New York Police Department’s deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism.

<text>György Dalos (born 23 September 1943) is a Hungarian Jewish writer and historian. He is best known for his novel &quot;1985&quot;, and &quot;The Guest from the Future: Anna Akhmatova and Isaiah Berlin&quot;.

==Life==
Dalos was born in Budapest and spent his childhood with his grandparents, as his father had died in 1945 in a labor camp, where he had been sent to as a Jew during World War II. From 1962 to 1967, he studied history at the Lomonossov University in Moscow. He then returned to his native town Budapest to work as a museologist. In 1968, Dalos was accused of &quot;Maoist activities&quot; and was handed seven months prison on probation and a Berufsverbot (professional disqualification) and a publication ban; due to that, he worked as a translator. In 1977, he was among the founders of the opposition movement against the Communist regime of Hungary. In 1988/89 he was co-editor of the East German underground opposition paper &quot;Ostkreuz&quot;. From 1995 to 1999, Dalos was head of the Institute for Hungarian Culture in Berlin. Since 2009 he is member of the International Council of Austrian Service Abroad.

Dalos lived in Vienna from 1987 to 1995. Since 1995, he has lived in Berlin as a freelance publisher and editor.

<text>Eldred v. Ashcroft, 537 U.S. 186 (2003), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States upholding the constitutionality of the 1998 Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA). The practical result of this was to prevent a number of works from entering the public domain in 1998 and following years, as would have occurred under the Copyright Act of 1976. Materials which the plaintiffs had worked with and were ready to republish were now unavailable due to copyright restrictions.

Internet publisher Eric Eldred was the lead petitioner, and was joined by a group of commercial and non-commercial interests who relied on the public domain for their work (including Dover Publications) and many &quot;amici&quot; including the Free Software Foundation, the American Association of Law Libraries, the Bureau of National Affairs, and the College Art Association. Eldred was represented by Lawrence Lessig and a team at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society.

Supporting the law were United States Attorneys General Janet Reno and John Ashcroft, along with a set of &quot;amici&quot; including the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, ASCAP and Broadcast Music Incorporated.

==Background==

The Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act (or CTEA) extended existing copyright terms by an additional 20 years from the terms set by the Copyright Act of 1976. The law affected both new and existing works (making it both a &quot;prospective&quot; extension as well as a &quot;retroactive&quot; one). Specifically, for works published before January 1, 1978, and still in copyright on October 27, 1998, the term was extended to 95 years. For works authored by &quot;individuals&quot; on or after January 1, 1978 (including new works), the copyright term was extended to equal the life of the author plus 70 years. For works authored by joint authors, the copyright term was extended to the life of the last surviving author plus 70 years. In the case of works-for-hire, anonymous or pseudonymous works, the term was set at 95 years from the date of first publication, or 120 years from creation.

The practical result of this was to prevent a number of works from entering the public domain in 1998 and following years, as would have occurred under the Copyright Law of 1976. Materials which the plaintiffs had worked with and were ready to republish were now unavailable due to copyright restrictions.

The lead petitioner, Eric Eldred, is an Internet publisher. Eldred was joined by a group of commercial and non-commercial interests who relied on the public domain for their work. These included Dover Publications, a commercial publisher of paperback books; Luck&#x27;s Music Library, Inc. and Edwin F. Kalmus &amp; Co., Inc., publishers of orchestral sheet music; and many &quot;amici&quot; including the Free Software Foundation; Tri-Horn International of Boston, Massachusetts, a golf publishing and technology company; the American Association of Law Libraries; the Bureau of National Affairs; and the College Art Association.

Supporting the law were the U.S. government, represented by the Attorney General in an &quot;ex officio&quot; capacity (originally Janet Reno, later replaced by John Ashcroft), along with a set of &quot;amici&quot; including the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, ASCAP, and Broadcast Music Incorporated.

==District court==
The original complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia on January 11, 1999. The plaintiffs&#x27; argument was threefold:

#That by retroactively extending copyright terms, Congress had violated the requirements of the Constitution&#x27;s Copyright Clause, which gives Congress the following power: Plaintiffs argued that by reading this formulation so as to allow for any number of retroactive extensions, Congress could in practice guarantee an unlimited period of copyright protection, thus thwarting the intent of the clause.
#That any copyright law must be subject to scrutiny under the First Amendment, thereby ensuring a balance between freedom of speech and the interests of copyright.
#That the doctrine of public trust requires the government to show a public benefit to any transfer of public property into private hands, and that the CTEA violates this doctrine by withdrawing material from the public domain.

In response, the government argued that Congress does indeed have the latitude to retroactively extend terms, so long as the individual extensions are also for &quot;limited Times&quot;, as required by the Constitution. As an argument for this position, they referred to the Copyright Act of 1790, the first Federal copyright legislation, which applied Federal protection to existing works. Furthermore, they argued, neither the First Amendment nor the doctrine of public trust is applicable to copyright cases.

On October 28, 1999, Judge June Green issued a brief opinion rejecting all three of the petitioners&#x27; arguments. On the first count, she wrote that Congress had the power to extend terms as it wished, as long as the terms themselves were of limited duration. On the second count, she rejected the notion of First Amendment scrutiny in copyright cases, based on her interpretation of &quot;Harper and Row Publishers, Inc., v. Nation Enterprises&quot;, an earlier Supreme Court decision. On the third count, she rejected the notion that public trust doctrine was applicable to copyright law.

==Court of Appeals==
The plaintiffs appealed the decision of the district court to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, filing their initial brief on May 22, 2000, and arguing the case on October 5 of the same year in front of a three-judge panel. Arguments were similar to those made in the district court, except for those regarding the public trust doctrine, which were not included in the appeal.

Instead, the plaintiffs extended their argument on the copyright clause to note that the clause requires Congress to &quot;promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&quot;, and argued that retroactive extensions do not directly serve this purpose in the standard &quot;quid pro quo&quot; previously required by the courts.

The case was decided on February 16, 2001. The appeals court upheld the decision of the district court in a 2–1 opinion. In his dissent, Judge David Sentelle agreed with the plaintiffs that CTEA was indeed unconstitutional based on the &quot;limited Times&quot; requirement. Supreme Court precedent, he argued, held that one must be able to discern an &quot;outer limit&quot; to a limited power; in the case of retrospective copyright extensions, Congress could continue to extend copyright terms indefinitely through a set of limited extensions, thus rendering the &quot;limited times&quot; requirement meaningless.

Following this ruling, plaintiffs petitioned for a rehearing &quot;en banc&quot; (in front of the full panel of nine judges). This petition was rejected, 7–2, with Judges Sentelle and David Tatel dissenting.

==Supreme Court==
On October 11, 2001, the plaintiffs filed a petition for certiorari to the Supreme Court of the United States. On February 19, 2002, the Court granted certiorari, agreeing to hear the case.

Oral arguments were presented on October 9, 2002. Lead counsel for the plaintiff was Lawrence Lessig; the government&#x27;s case was argued by Solicitor General Theodore Olson.

Lessig focused the Plaintiffs&#x27; brief to emphasize the Copyright Clause restriction, as well as the First Amendment argument from the Court of Appeals case. The decision to emphasize the Copyright Clause argument was based on both the minority opinion of Judge Sentelle in the appeals court, and on several recent Supreme Court decisions authored by Chief Justice William Rehnquist: &quot;United States v. Lopez&quot; (1996) and &quot;United States v. Morrison&quot; (2000).

In both of those decisions, Rehnquist, along with four of the Court&#x27;s more conservative justices, held Congressional legislation unconstitutional, because that legislation exceeded the limits of the Constitution&#x27;s Commerce Clause. This profound reversal of precedent, Lessig argued, could not be limited to only one of the enumerated powers. If the court felt that it had the power to review legislation under the Commerce Clause, Lessig argued, then the Copyright clause deserved similar treatment, or at very least a &quot;principled reason&quot; must be stated for according such treatment to only one of the enumerated powers.

On January 15, 2003, the Court held the CTEA constitutional by a 7–2 decision. The majority opinion, written by Justice Ginsburg, relied heavily on the Copyright Acts of 1790, 1831, 1909, and 1976 as precedent for retroactive extensions. One of the arguments supporting the act was that life expectancy has significantly increased among the human population since the 18th century, and therefore copyright law needed extending as well. However, the major argument for the act that carried over into the case was that the Constitution specified that Congress only needed to set time limits for copyright, the length of which was left to their discretion. Thus, as long as the limit is not &quot;forever&quot;, any limit set by Congress can be deemed constitutional.

A key factor in the CTEA&#x27;s passage was a 1993 European Union (EU) directive instructing EU members to establish a baseline copyright term of life plus 70 years and to deny this longer term to the works of any non-EU country whose laws did not secure the same extended term. By extending the baseline United States copyright term, Congress sought to ensure that American authors would receive the same copyright protection in Europe as their European counterparts.

The Supreme Court declined to address Lessig&#x27;s contention that &quot;Lopez&quot; and &quot;Morrison&quot; offered precedent for enforcing the Copyright clause, and instead reiterated the lower court&#x27;s reasoning that a retroactive term extension &quot;can&quot; satisfy the &quot;limited Times&quot; provision in the Copyright Clause, as long as the extension itself is limited instead of perpetual. Furthermore, the Court refused to apply the proportionality standards of the Fourteenth Amendment or the free-speech standards in the First Amendment to limit Congress&#x27;s ability to confer copyrights for limited terms.

Justice Breyer dissented, arguing that the CTEA amounted to a grant of perpetual copyright that undermined public interests. While the constitution grants Congress power to extend copyright terms in order to &quot;promote the progress of science and useful arts&quot;, CTEA granted precedent to continually renew copyright terms making them virtually perpetual. Justice Breyer argued that it is highly unlikely any artist will be more inclined to produce work knowing their great-grandchildren will receive royalties. With regard to retroactive copyright extension, he considered it foolish to apply the government&#x27;s argument that income received from royalties allows artists to produce more work saying, &quot;How will extension help today&#x27;s Noah Webster create new works 50 years after his death?&quot; He also attacked the idea that the fair use defense would efficiently solve the First Amendment issue, as the defense could not help &quot;those who wish to obtain from electronic databases material that is not there&quot;, e.g. teachers searching online for material to be used in the class (and finding that the ideal material has been deleted from the database).

In a separate dissenting opinion, Justice Stevens also challenged the virtue of an individual reward, analyzing it from the perspective of patent law. He argued that the focus on compensation results only in &quot;frustrating the legitimate members of the public who want to make use of it (a completed invention) in a free market&quot;. Further, the compelling need to encourage creation is proportionally diminished once a work is already created. Yet while a formula pairing commercial viability to duration of protection may be said to produce more economically efficient results in respect of high technology inventions with shorter shelf-lives, the same perhaps cannot be said for certain forms of copyrighted works, for which the present value of expenditures relating to creation depend less on scientific equipment and research and development programs and more on unquantifiable creativity.

Lessig expressed surprise that no decision was authored by Chief Justice Rehnquist or by any of the other four justices who supported the &quot;Lopez&quot; or &quot;Morrison&quot; decisions. Lessig later expressed regret that he based his argument on precedent rather than attempting to demonstrate that the weakening of the public domain would cause harm to the economic health of the country.

==Later developments==
Within a year of &quot;Eldred&quot;, it was serving as decisive precedent. Two cases, &quot;Luck’s Music Library, Inc. v. Ashcroft and Peters&quot; and &quot;Golan v. Ashcroft and Peters&quot;, challenged the constitutionality of the Uruguay Round Agreements Act on the grounds that its &quot;restoration amendment,&quot; which provided copyright restriction to foreign works that were in the public domain because foreign works were formerly not copyrightable, violated the First Amendment rights of those who would no longer be able to perform the works without observing copyright. The court cited &quot;Eldred&quot; and dismissed &quot;Luck&#x27;s Music&quot; on the grounds that the First Amendment did not protect the ability to use others&#x27; words as much as it does protect one&#x27;s ability to use their own. &quot;Golan v. Ashcroft and Peters&quot;″s Uruguay Round portion survived a motion to dismiss even though its own challenge to the Sonny Bono Act did not. That case culminated in &quot;Golan v. Holder&quot;, which held that there was nothing in the Constitution preventing the government from taking works out of the public domain.

A 2007 case, &quot;Kahle v. Gonzales&quot;, worked from the &quot;Eldred v. Ashcroft&quot; opinion to argue that a change in copyright law as drastic as the change from opt-in to opt-out required a review in regard to freedom of speech. The plaintiffs, represented by Lawrence Lessig, argued that the limitations placed on speech and expression by copyright were drastically expanded and possibly too limiting. The Ninth Circuit determined that the argument was too similar to the one adjudicated in &quot;Eldred&quot; and dismissed the case.

<text>Leon Bismark &quot;Bix&quot; Beiderbecke ( ; March 10, 1903 – August 6, 1931) was an American jazz cornetist, pianist and composer. Beiderbecke was one of the most influential jazz soloists of the 1920s, a cornet player noted for an inventive lyrical approach and purity of tone, with such clarity of sound that one contemporary famously described it like &quot;shooting bullets at a bell”.

His solos on seminal recordings such as &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Coming, Virginia&quot; (both 1927) demonstrate a gift for extended improvisation that heralded the jazz ballad style, in which jazz solos are an integral part of the composition. Moreover, his use of extended chords and an ability to improvise freely along harmonic as well as melodic lines are echoed in post-WWII developments in jazz. &quot;In a Mist&quot; (1927) is the best known of Beiderbecke&#x27;s published piano compositions and the only one that he recorded. His piano style reflects both jazz and classical (mainly impressionist) influences. All five of his piano compositions were published by Robbins Music during his lifetime.

A native of Davenport, Iowa, Beiderbecke taught himself to play the cornet largely by ear, leading him to adopt a non-standard fingering technique that informed his unique style. He first recorded with Midwestern jazz ensemble The Wolverines in 1924, after which he played briefly for the Detroit-based Jean Goldkette Orchestra before joining Frankie &quot;Tram&quot; Trumbauer for an extended engagement at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis, also under the auspices of Goldkette&#x27;s organisation. Beiderbecke and Trumbauer joined Goldkette&#x27;s main band at the Graystone Ballroom in Detroit in 1926. The band toured widely and famously played a set opposite Fletcher Henderson at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City in . He made his greatest recordings in 1927. The Goldkette band folded in September 1927 and, after briefly joining bass saxophone player Adrian Rollini&#x27;s band in New York, Trumbauer and Beiderbecke joined America&#x27;s most popular dance band: Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra.

Beiderbecke&#x27;s most influential recordings date from his time with Goldkette and Whiteman, although he also recorded under his own name and that of Trumbauer&#x27;s. The Whiteman period marked a precipitous decline in his health due to his increasing use of alcohol. Treatment for alcoholism in rehabilitation centers, with the support of Whiteman and the Beiderbecke family, failed to stop his decline. He left the Whiteman band in 1929 and in the summer of 1931 died aged 28 in his Sunnyside, Queens, New York apartment.

His death, in turn, gave rise to one of the original legends of jazz. In magazine articles, musicians&#x27; memoirs, novels, and Hollywood films, Beiderbecke has been envisaged as a Romantic hero, the &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; (a novel, later made into a movie starring Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, Doris Day, and his friend Hoagy Carmichael). His life has often been portrayed as that of a jazz musician who had to compromise his art for the sake of commercialism. Beiderbecke remains the subject of scholarly controversy regarding his full name, the cause of his death and the importance of his contributions to jazz.

He composed or played on recordings that are jazz classics and standards such as &quot;Davenport Blues&quot;, &quot;In a Mist&quot;, &quot;Copenhagen&quot;, &quot;Riverboat Shuffle&quot;, &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, and &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;.

==Early life==

The son of Bismark Herman Beiderbecke and Agatha Jane Hilton, Bix Beiderbecke was born on March 10, 1903, in Davenport, Iowa. There is disagreement over whether Beiderbecke was christened Leon Bix or Leon Bismark and nicknamed &quot;Bix&quot;. His father was nicknamed &quot;Bix&quot;, as was his older brother, Charles Burnette &quot;Burnie&quot; Beiderbecke. Burnie Beiderbecke claimed that the boy was named Leon Bix and biographers have reproduced birth certificates that agree. More recent research — which takes into account church and school records in addition to the will of a relative — suggests he was named Leon Bismark. Regardless, his parents called him Bix, which seems to have been his preference. In a letter to his mother when he was nine years old, Beiderbecke signed off, &quot;frome your Leon Bix Beiderbecke not Bismark Remeber &quot;.

The son of German immigrants, Beiderbecke&#x27;s father was a well-to-do coal and lumber merchant named after Otto von Bismarck of his native Germany. Beiderbecke&#x27;s mother was the daughter of a Mississippi riverboat captain. She played the organ at Davenport&#x27;s First Presbyterian Church and encouraged young Beiderbecke&#x27;s interest in the piano.

Beiderbecke was the youngest of three children. His brother, Burnie, was born in 1895, and his sister, Mary Louise, in 1898. He began playing piano at age two or three. His sister recalls that he stood on the floor and played it with his hands over his head. Five years later, he was the subject of an admiring article in the &quot;Davenport Daily Democrat&quot; that proclaimed, &quot;Seven-year-old boy musical wonder! Little Bickie Beiderbecke plays any selection he hears.&quot;

Burnie recalled that he stopped coming home for supper to hurry to the riverfront, slip aboard an excursion boat, and play the calliope. A friend remembered that Beiderbecke showed little interest in the Saturday matinees they attended, but as soon as the lights came on he rushed home to duplicate the melodies the accompanist had played.

When Burnie returned to Davenport at the end of 1918 after serving stateside during World War I, he brought with him a Victrola phonograph and several records, including &quot;Tiger Rag&quot; and &quot;Skeleton Jangle&quot; by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band. From these records, Beiderbecke learned to love hot jazz; he taught himself to play cornet by listening to Nick LaRocca&#x27;s horn lines. He also listened to jazz from the riverboats that docked in downtown Davenport. Louis Armstrong and the drummer Baby Dodds claimed to have met Beiderbecke when their excursion boat stopped in Davenport. Historians disagree over whether such an event occurred.

Beiderbecke attended Davenport High School from 1918 to 1921. During this time, he sat in and played professionally with various bands, including those of Wilbur Hatch, Floyd Bean, and Carlisle Evans. In the spring of 1920 he performed for the school&#x27;s Vaudeville Night, singing in a vocal quintet called the Black Jazz Babies and playing his cornet. At the invitation of his friend Fritz Putzier, he subsequently joined Neal Buckley&#x27;s Novelty Orchestra. The group was hired for a gig in December 1920, but a complaint was lodged with the American Federation of Musicians, Local 67, that the boys did not have union cards. In an audition before a union executive, Beiderbecke was forced to sight read and failed. He did not earn his card.

On April 22, 1921, a month after he turned 18, Beiderbecke was arrested by two Davenport police officers on an accusation that he had taken a five-year-old girl named Sarah Ivens into a neighbor&#x27;s garage and committed a lewd and lascivious act with her—a statutory felony in Iowa. According to the police ledger, the girl accused Beiderbecke of &quot;putting his hands on her person outside of her dress.&quot; The ledger went on to state that Beiderbecke and the girl &quot;were in an auto in the garage and he closed the door on the girl and she hollered,&quot; attracting the attention of two young men who were across the street. The young men &quot;went over [to the garage] and the girl went home.&quot; Beiderbecke was released after a $1,500 bail bond was posted. Sarah&#x27;s father, Preston Ivens, requested that the Scott County grand jury drop the charge to avoid &quot;harm that would result to her in going over this case,&quot; and in September 1921, the grand jury returned no indictment, whereupon the County Attorney filed a dismissal of the case. It is not clear from the official documents if Sarah herself had identified Beiderbecke, but the two young men had told her father, when he questioned them a day after the alleged incident, that they had seen Beiderbecke take the girl into the garage. The surviving official documents concerning the arrest and its aftermath – including two police entries and Preston Ivens&#x27; grand jury testimony – were first made available in 2001 by Professor Albert Haim on the Bixography website. Jean Pierre Lion in his 2005 biography discussed the incident briefly and printed the texts of the documents. Earlier biographies had not reported the alleged incident.

In September 1921, Beiderbecke enrolled at the Lake Forest Academy, a boarding school north of Chicago in Lake Forest, Illinois. While historians have traditionally suggested that his parents sent him to Lake Forest to discourage his interest in jazz, others believe that he may have been sent away in response to his arrest. Regardless, Mr. and Mrs. Beiderbecke apparently felt that a boarding school would provide their son with both the faculty attention and discipline required to improve his academic performance, necessitated by the fact that Bix had failed most courses in high school, remaining a junior in 1921 despite turning 18 in March of that year. His interests, however, remained limited to music and sports. In pursuit of the former, Beiderbecke often visited Chicago to listen to jazz bands at night clubs and speakeasies, including the infamous Friar&#x27;s Inn, where he sometimes sat in with the New Orleans Rhythm Kings. He also traveled to the predominantly African-American South Side to listen to classic black jazz bands such as King Oliver&#x27;s Creole Jazz Band, which featured Louis Armstrong on second cornet. &quot;Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m getting hard, Burnie,&quot; he wrote to his brother, &quot;but I&#x27;d go to hell to hear a good band.&quot; On campus, he helped organize the Cy-Bix Orchestra with drummer Walter &quot;Cy&quot; Welge and almost immediately got into trouble with the Lake Forest headmaster for performing indecorously at a school dance.

Beiderbecke often failed to return to his dormitory before curfew, and sometimes stayed off-campus the next day. In the early morning hours of May 20, 1922, he was caught on the fire escape to his dormitory, attempting to climb back into his room. The faculty voted to expel him the next day, due both to his academic failings and his extracurricular activities, which included drinking. The headmaster informed Beiderbecke&#x27;s parents by letter that following his expulsion school officials confirmed that Beiderbecke &quot;was drinking himself and was responsible, in part at least, in having liquor brought into the School.&quot; Soon after, Beiderbecke began pursuing a career in music.

He returned to Davenport briefly in the summer of 1922, then moved to Chicago to join the Cascades Band, working that summer on Lake Michigan excursion boats. He gigged around Chicago until the fall of 1923, at times returning to Davenport to work for his father.

==Career==

===Wolverines===

Beiderbecke joined the Wolverine Orchestra late in 1923, and the seven-man group first played a speakeasy called the Stockton Club near Hamilton, Ohio. Specializing in hot jazz and recoiling from so-called sweet music, the band took its name from one of its most frequent numbers, Jelly Roll Morton&#x27;s &quot;Wolverine Blues.&quot; During this time, Beiderbecke also took piano lessons from a young woman who introduced him to the works of Eastwood Lane. Lane&#x27;s piano suites and orchestral arrangements were self-consciously American whilst also having French Impressionist allusions, and influenced Beiderbecke&#x27;s style, especially on &quot;In a Mist.&quot; A subsequent gig at Doyle&#x27;s Dance Academy in Cincinnati became the occasion for a series of band and individual photographs that resulted in the image of Beiderbecke—sitting fresh-faced, his hair perfectly combed and his cornet resting on his right knee.

On February 18, 1924, the Wolverines made their first recordings. Two sides were waxed that day at the Gennett Records studios in Richmond, Indiana: &quot;Fidgety Feet&quot;, written by Nick LaRocca and Larry Shields from the Original Dixieland Jazz Band, and &quot;Jazz Me Blues&quot;, written by Tom Delaney. Beiderbecke&#x27;s solo on the latter heralded something new and significant in jazz, according to biographers Richard M. Sudhalter and Philip R. Evans:

Both qualities—complementary or &quot;correlated&quot; phrasing and cultivation of the vocal, &quot;singing&quot; middle-range of the cornet—are on display in Bix&#x27;s &quot;Jazz Me Blues&quot; solo, along with an already discernible inclination for unusual accidentals and inner chordal voices. It is a pioneer record, introducing a musician of great originality with a pace-setting band. And it astonished even the Wolverines themselves.

The Wolverines recorded 15 sides for Gennett Records between February and October 1924. The titles revealed a strong and well-formed cornet talent. His lip had strengthened from earlier, more tentative years; on nine of the Wolverines&#x27; recorded titles he proceeds commandingly from lead to opening solo without any need for a respite from playing.

In some respects, Beiderbecke&#x27;s playing was &quot;sui generis&quot;, but he nevertheless listened to, and learned from, the music around him: from the Dixieland jazz as exemplified by the Original Dixieland Jazz Band; to the hotter Chicago style of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings and the south-side bands of King Oliver and other black artists; to the classical compositions of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel.

Louis Armstrong also provided a source of inspiration, though Beiderbecke&#x27;s style was very different from that of Armstrong, according to &quot;The Oxford Companion to Jazz&quot;:Where Armstrong&#x27;s playing was bravura, regularly optimistic, and openly emotional, Beiderbecke&#x27;s conveyed a range of intellectual alternatives. Where Armstrong, at the head of an ensemble, played it hard, straight, and true, Beiderbecke, like a shadowboxer, invented his own way of phrasing &quot;around the lead.&quot; Where Armstrong&#x27;s superior strength delighted in the sheer power of what a cornet could produce, Beiderbecke&#x27;s cool approach invited rather than commanded you to listen.Armstrong tended to accentuate showmanship and virtuosity, whereas Beiderbecke emphasized melody, even when improvising, and rarely strayed into the upper reaches of the register. Mezz Mezzrow recounted in his autobiography driving 53 miles to Hudson Lake, Indiana, with Frank Teschemacher in order to play Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;Heebie Jeebies&quot; for Beiderbecke when it was released. In addition to listening to Armstrong&#x27;s records, Beiderbecke and other white musicians patronized the Sunset Café on Fridays to listen to Armstrong and his band. Paul Mares of the New Orleans Rhythm Kings insisted that Beiderbecke&#x27;s chief influence was the New Orleans cornetist Emmett Hardy, who died in 1925 at the age of 23. Indeed, Beiderbecke had met Hardy and the clarinetist Leon Roppolo in Davenport in 1921 when the two joined a local band and played in town for three months. Beiderbecke apparently spent time with them, but it is difficult to discern the degree to which Hardy&#x27;s style influenced Beiderbecke&#x27;s—especially since there is no publicly known recording of a Hardy performance.

Beiderbecke certainly found a kindred musical spirit in Hoagy Carmichael, whose amusingly unconventional personality he also appreciated. The two became firm friends. A law student and aspiring pianist and songwriter, Carmichael invited the Wolverines to play at the Bloomington campus of Indiana University in the spring of 1924. On May 6, 1924, the Wolverines recorded a tune Carmichael had written especially for Beiderbecke and his colleagues: &quot;Riverboat Shuffle&quot;.

=== Goldkette ===
During an engagement at the Cinderella Ballroom in New York during September–October 1924, Bix tendered his resignation with the Wolverines, leaving to join Jean Goldkette and his Orchestra in Detroit, but Beiderbecke&#x27;s tenure with the band proved to be short-lived. Goldkette recorded for the Victor Talking Machine Company, whose musical director, Eddie King, objected to Beiderbecke&#x27;s modernistic style of jazz playing. Moreover, despite the fact that Beiderbecke&#x27;s position within the Goldkette band was &quot;third trumpet&quot;, a less taxing role than 1st or 2nd trumpet, he struggled with the complex ensemble passages due to his limited reading abilities. After a few weeks, Beiderbecke and Goldkette agreed to part company, but to keep in touch, with Goldkette advising Beiderbecke to brush up on his reading and learn more about music. Some six weeks after leaving the band, Bix arranged a Gennett recording session back in Richmond with some of the Goldkette band members, under the name Bix and His Rhythm Jugglers. On January 26, 1925, they set two tunes to wax: &quot;Toddlin&#x27; Blues&quot;, another number by LaRocca and Shields, and Beiderbecke&#x27;s own composition, &quot;Davenport Blues&quot;, which subsequently became a classic jazz number, recorded by musicians ranging from Bunny Berigan to Ry Cooder and Geoff Muldaur. An arrangement of &quot;Davenport Blues&quot; as a piano solo was published by Robbins Music in 1927.

In February 1925, Beiderbecke enrolled at the University of Iowa in Iowa City. His stint in academia was even briefer than his time in Detroit, however. When he attempted to pack his course schedule with music, his guidance counselor forced him instead to take religion, ethics, physical education, and military training. It was an institutional blunder that Benny Green described as being, in retrospect, &quot;comical,&quot; &quot;fatuous,&quot; and &quot;a parody.&quot; Beiderbecke promptly began to skip classes, and after he participated in a drunken incident in a local bar, he was expelled. According to Lion, he was not expelled, but quit. That summer he played with his friends Don Murray and Howdy Quicksell at a lake resort in Michigan. The band was run by Goldkette, and it put Beiderbecke in touch with another musician he had met before: the C-melody saxophone player Frankie Trumbauer. The two hit it off, both personally and musically, despite Trumbauer having been warned by other musicians: &quot;Look out, he&#x27;s trouble. He drinks and you&#x27;ll have a hard time handling him.&quot; They were inseparable for much of the rest of Beiderbecke&#x27;s career, with Trumbauer acting as something of a guardian to Beiderbecke. When Trumbauer organized a band for an extended run at the Arcadia Ballroom in St. Louis, Beiderbecke joined him. There he also played alongside the clarinetist Pee Wee Russell, who praised Beiderbecke&#x27;s ability to drive the band. &quot;He more or less made you play whether you wanted to or not,&quot; Russell said. &quot;If you had any talent at all he made you play better.&quot;

In the spring of 1926, Bix and Trumbauer joined Goldkette&#x27;s main dance band, splitting the year between playing a Summer season at a Goldkette-owned resort on Lake Hudson, Indiana, and headlining at Detroit&#x27;s Graystone Ballroom, which was also owned by Goldkette. In October 1926, Goldkette&#x27;s &quot;Famous Fourteen&quot;, as they came to be called, opened at the Roseland Ballroom in New York City opposite the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra, one of the East Coast&#x27;s outstanding African American big bands. The Roseland promoted a &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot; in the local press and, on October 12, after a night of furious playing, Goldkette&#x27;s men were declared the winners. &quot;We […] were amazed, angry, morose, and bewildered,&quot; Rex Stewart, Fletcher&#x27;s lead trumpeter, said of listening to Beiderbecke and his colleagues play. He called the experience &quot;most humiliating&quot;. On October 15, 1931, a few months after Beiderbecke&#x27;s death, the Fletcher Henderson Orchestra recorded a version of &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; that included Rex Stewart performing a nearly note-for-note homage to Beiderbecke&#x27;s most famous solo.
Although the Goldkette Orchestra recorded numerous sides for Victor during this period, none of them showcases Beiderbecke&#x27;s most famous solos. The band found itself subjected to the commercial considerations of the popular music sector that Victor deliberately targeted the band&#x27;s recordings at. The few exceptions to the policy include &quot;My Pretty Girl&quot; and &quot;Clementine&quot;, the latter being one of the band&#x27;s final recordings and its effective swan song. In addition to these commercial sessions with Goldkette, Beiderbecke and Trumbauer also recorded under their own names for the OKeh label; Bix waxed some of his best solos as a member of Trumbauer&#x27;s recording band, starting with &quot;Clarinet Marmalade&quot; and &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, recorded on February 4, 1927. Again with Trumbauer, Beiderbecke re-recorded Carmichael&#x27;s &quot;Riverboat Shuffle&quot; in May and delivered two further seminal solos a few days later on &quot;I&#x27;m Coming, Virginia&quot; and &quot;Way Down Yonder in New Orleans&quot;. Beiderbecke earned co-writing credit with Trumbauer on &quot;For No Reason at All in C&quot;, recorded under the name Tram, Bix and Eddie (in their Three Piece Band). Beiderbecke switched between cornet and piano on that number, and then in September played only piano for his recording of &quot;In A Mist&quot;. This was perhaps the most fruitful year of his short career.

Under financial pressure, Goldkette folded his premier band in September 1927 in New York. Paul Whiteman hoped to snatch up Goldkette&#x27;s best musicians for his traveling orchestra, but Beiderbecke, Trumbauer, Murray, Bill Rank, Chauncey Morehouse, and Frank Signorelli instead joined the bass saxophone player Adrian Rollini at the Club New Yorker. The band also included guitarist Eddie Lang and violinist Joe Venuti, who had often recorded on a freelance basis with the Goldkette Orchestra. Another newcomer was Sylvester Ahola, a schooled trumpeter who could play improvised jazz solos and read complex scores. When Ahola introduced himself, Beiderbecke famously stated &quot;Hell, I&#x27;m only a musical degenerate&quot;. When that job ended sooner than expected, in October 1927, Beiderbecke and Trumbauer signed on with Whiteman. They joined his orchestra in Indianapolis on October 27.

===Whiteman===

The Paul Whiteman Orchestra was the most popular and highest paid dance band of the day. In spite of Whiteman&#x27;s appellation &quot;The King of Jazz&quot;, his band was not a jazz ensemble as such, but a popular music outfit that drew from both jazz and classical music repertoires, according to the demands of its record-buying and concert-going audience. Whiteman was perhaps best known for having premiered George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot; in New York in 1924, and the orchestrator of that piece, Ferde Grofé, continued to be an important part of the band throughout the 1920s. Whiteman was large physically and important culturally —&quot;a man flabby, virile, quick, coarse, untidy and sleek, with a hard core of shrewdness in an envelope of sentimentalism&quot;, according to a 1926 &quot;New Yorker&quot; profile. A number of Beiderbecke partisans have criticised Whiteman for not giving Bix the opportunities he deserved as a jazz musician. James complains that, after Beiderbecke joined the band, &quot;Whiteman moved farther and farther away from the easy-going, rhythmically inclined style of his earlier days&quot;, becoming &quot;more subservient to his business sense&quot;. He goes on to suggest that this artistically compromised Beiderbecke, in part causing his death.

Benny Green, in particular, derided Whiteman for being a mere &quot;mediocre vaudeville act&quot;, and suggesting that &quot;today we only tolerate the horrors of Whiteman&#x27;s recordings at all in the hope that here and there a Bixian fragment will redeem the mess.&quot; Richard Sudhalter has responded by suggesting that Beiderbecke saw the Whiteman band as an opportunity to pursue musical ambitions that did not stop at jazz:

Colleagues have testified that, far from feeling bound or stifled by the Whiteman orchestra, as Green and others have suggested, Bix often felt a sense of exhilaration. It was like attending a music school, learning and broadening: formal music, especially the synthesis of the American vernacular idiom with a more classical orientation, so much sought-after in the 1920s, were calling out to him.

Beiderbecke is featured on a number of Whiteman recordings, including &quot;From Monday On&quot;, &quot;Back In Your Own Back Yard&quot;, &quot;You Took Advantage Of Me&quot;, &quot;Sugar&quot;, &quot;Changes&quot; and &quot;When&quot;. These feature specially written arrangements that emphasize Beiderbecke&#x27;s improvisational skills. Bill Challis, an arranger who had also worked in this capacity for Jean Goldkette, was particularly sympathetic in writing scores with Beiderbecke in mind, sometimes arranging entire ensemble passages based on solos that Bix played. Beiderbecke also played on several notable hit records recorded by Whiteman, such as &quot;Together&quot;, &quot;Ramona&quot; and &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot;, the latter featuring Bing Crosby on vocals.

The heavy touring and recording schedule with Whiteman&#x27;s orchestra may have exacerbated Beiderbecke&#x27;s long-term alcoholism, though this is a contentious point. Whiteman&#x27;s violinist Matty Malneck said &quot;The work was so hard, you almost had to drink&quot; adding &quot;He didn&#x27;t get to play the things he loved with the Whiteman band because we were a symphonic band and we played the same thing every night, and it got to be tiresome.&quot;

On November 30, 1928, whilst on tour in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms &quot;a severe nervous crisis&quot; and Sudhalter and Evans suggest &quot;was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens&quot;, presumably triggered by Beiderbecke&#x27;s attempt to curb his alcohol intake. &quot;He cracked up, that&#x27;s all&quot;, trombonist Bill Rank said. &quot;Just went to pieces; broke up a roomful of furniture in the hotel.&quot;

In February 1929, Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as &quot;the world&#x27;s hottest cornetist&quot;. He then spent the summer with Whiteman&#x27;s band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, &quot;The King of Jazz&quot;. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix&#x27;s long-term reliance on alcohol: &quot;Bix admitted to having used liquor &#x27;in excess&#x27; for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of &#x27;whiskey&#x27; and twenty cigarettes...A Hepatic dullness was obvious, &#x27;knee jerk could not be obtained&#x27; – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was &#x27;swaying in Romberg position&#x27; – standing up with his eyes closed&quot;.

While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke&#x27;s honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael&#x27;s new song, &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;, with Carmichael doing the vocals, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto saxophone, Jack Teagarden on trombone, and Bud Freeman on tenor saxophone. The song would go on to become a jazz and popular music standard. In 2014, the 1930 recording of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Beiderbecke&#x27;s playing had an influence on Carmichael as a composer. One of his compositions, &quot;Stardust&quot;, was inspired by Beiderbecke&#x27;s improvisations, with a cornet phrase reworked by Carmichael into the song&#x27;s central theme. Bing Crosby, who sang with Whiteman, also cited Beiderbecke as an important influence. &quot;Bix and all the rest would play and exchange ideas on the piano&quot;, he said.

With all the noise [of a New York pub] going on, I don&#x27;t know how they heard themselves, but they did. I didn&#x27;t contribute anything, but I listened and learned […] I was now being influenced by these musicians, particularly horn men. I could hum and sing all of the jazz choruses from the recordings made by Bix, Phil Napoleon, and the rest.

Following the Wall Street Crash of 1929, the once-booming music industry contracted and work became more difficult to find. For a while, Beiderbecke&#x27;s only regular income came from his work as a member of Nat Shilkret&#x27;s orchestra on &quot;The Camel Pleasure Hour&quot; NBC radio show. However, during a live broadcast on October 8, 1930, Beiderbecke&#x27;s seemingly limitless gift for improvisation finally failed him: &quot;He stood up to take his solo, but his mind went blank and nothing happened&quot;, recalled a fellow musician, Frankie Cush. The cornetist spent the rest of the year at home in Davenport and then, in February 1931, he returned to New York one last time.

==Death==
Beiderbecke died in his apartment, No. 1G, 43–30 46th Street, in Sunnyside, Queens, New York, on August 6, 1931. The week had been stiflingly hot, making sleep difficult. Suffering from insomnia, Beiderbecke played the piano late into the evenings, to both the annoyance and the delight of his neighbors. On the evening of August 6, at about 9:30 pm, his rental agent, George Kraslow, heard noises coming from across the hallway. &quot;His hysterical shouts brought me to his apartment on the run,&quot; Kraslow told Philip Evans in 1959, continuing:

Historians have disagreed over the identity of the doctor who pronounced Beiderbecke dead, with several sources stating that it was Dr. John Haberski (the husband of the woman Kraslow identified) who pronounced Beiderbecke dead in his apartment. The official cause of death, as indicated on the death certificate, was lobar pneumonia. Unofficially, edema of the brain, coupled with the effects of long-term alcoholism, have been cited as contributory factors. Beiderbecke&#x27;s mother and brother took the train to New York and arranged for his body to be taken home to Davenport. He was buried there on August 11, 1931, in the family plot at Oakdale Cemetery.

==Legend and legacy==

Critical analysis of Beiderbecke&#x27;s work during his lifetime was sparse. His innovative playing initially received greater attention and appreciation among European critics than those in the country of his birth. The British music trade magazine &quot;Melody Maker&quot; published a number of reviews of his recordings and assessments of his cornet playing. In the April 1927 issue, bandleader Fred Elizalde stated: &quot;Bix Bidlebeck (sic) is considered by Red Nichols himself and every other trumpet player in the States, for that matter, as the greatest trumpet player of all time&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s editor, Edgar Jackson, was equally fulsome in his praise: &quot;Bix has a heart as big as your head, which shines through his playing with the warmth of the sun&#x27;s rays&quot; (September 1927 issue); &quot;The next sixteen bars are a trumpet solo by Bix, and if this doesn&#x27;t get you right in the heart, you&#x27;d better see a vet….&quot;

At the time of his death, Beiderbecke was still little known by the public at large, though his appreciation among fellow musicians and the collegiate set is indicated by contemporary news reports:To a large circle of those boys and girls of high school and college age whom a staid world likes to label &quot;the jazz-mad generation,&quot; the news that Leon Bix Beiderbecke is dead will mean something, however lacking in significance it might be to their critical elders. &quot;Bixie&quot; was a symbol of that jazz generation, expressing its wistful, restless temperament through the medium of the unconventional dance music which constitutes its theme song. In his mind were conceived the wild, strange contortions of rhythm and harmony which established the basic motif of the popular music of a year ago...To most youngsters in college, however, the weird flourishes that &quot;Bixie&#x27;s&quot; fingers executed on trumpet and piano were expressive. They could hear the lilting melody of youth that formed a smooth background for his fantastic caricatures in sound. Hundreds of young collegians who couldn&#x27;t recall a strain of Beethoven or Wagner could whistle Bix Beiderbecke choruses. In the world of professional popular music, &quot;Bixie&quot; was an artist comparable to Kreisler in the field of conventional music. Paul Whiteman called him &quot;the finest trumpet player in the country&quot;.Perhaps &quot;Bixie&#x27;s&quot; death at the age of twenty-eight also is symbolical of the futility of the &quot;jazz-mad generation&#x27;s&quot; quest for self-expression. However that may be, if it is true, as some critics contend, that &quot;jazz&quot; music is establishing foundations on which a distinctive and thoroughly legitimate American music eventually will be built, Bix Beiderbecke has left his mark on the future culture of the nation.One of the first serious, analytical obituaries to have been published in the months after his death was by the French jazz writer Hugues Panassié. The notice appeared in October 1931.

The &quot;New Republic&quot; critic Otis Ferguson wrote two short articles for the magazine, &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot; and &quot;Young Man with a Horn Again&quot;, that worked to revive interest not only in Beiderbecke&#x27;s music but also in his biography. Beiderbecke &quot;lived very briefly […] in what might be called the servants&#x27; entrance to art&quot;, Ferguson wrote. &quot;His story is a good story, quite humble and right.&quot; The romantic notion of the short-lived, doomed jazz genius can be traced back at least as far as Beiderbecke, and lived on in Glenn Miller, Charlie Parker, Billie Holiday, Jaco Pastorius and many more.

Ferguson&#x27;s sense of what was &quot;right&quot; became the basis for the Beiderbecke Romantic legend, which has traditionally emphasized the musician&#x27;s Iowa roots, his often careless dress, his difficulty sight reading, the purity of his tone, his drinking, and his early death. These themes were repeated by Beiderbecke&#x27;s friends in various memoirs, including &quot;The Stardust Road&quot; (1946) and &quot;Sometimes I Wonder&quot; (1965) by Hoagy Carmichael, &quot;Really the Blues&quot; (1946) by Mezz Mezzrow, and &quot;We Called It Music&quot; (1947) by Eddie Condon. Beiderbecke was portrayed as a tragic genius along the lines of Ludwig van Beethoven. &quot;For his talent there were no conservatories to get stuffy in, no high-trumpet didoes to be learned doggedly, note-perfect as written,&quot; Ferguson wrote, &quot;because in his chosen form the only writing of any account was traced in the close shouting air of Royal Gardens, Grand Pavilions, honkeytonks, etc.&quot; He was &quot;this big overgrown kid, who looked like he&#x27;d been snatched out of a cradle in the cornfields&quot;, Mezzrow wrote. &quot;The guy didn&#x27;t have an enemy in the world,&quot; recalled fellow musician Russ Morgan, &quot;[b]ut he was &quot;out of this world&quot; most of the time.&quot; [Italics in original.] According to Ralph Berton, he was &quot;as usual gazing off into his private astronomy&quot;, but his cornet, Condon famously quipped, sounded &quot;like a girl saying yes&quot;.

In 1938, Dorothy Baker borrowed the title of her friend Otis Ferguson&#x27;s first article and published the novel &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot;. Her story of the doomed trumpet player Rick Martin was inspired, she wrote, by &quot;the music, but not the life&quot; of Beiderbecke, but the image of Martin quickly became the image of Beiderbecke: his story is about &quot;the gap between the man&#x27;s musical ability and his ability to fit it to his own life.&quot; In 1950, Michael Curtiz directed the film &quot;Young Man with a Horn&quot;, starring Kirk Douglas, Lauren Bacall, and Doris Day. In this version, in which Hoagy Carmichael also plays a role, the Rick Martin character lives.

In &quot;Blackboard Jungle&quot;, a 1955 film starring Glenn Ford and Sidney Poitier, Beiderbecke&#x27;s music is briefly featured, but as a symbol of cultural conservatism in a nation on the cusp of the rock and roll revolution.

Brendan Wolfe, the author of &quot;Finding Bix&quot;, spoke of Beiderbecke&#x27;s lasting influence on Davenport, Iowa: &quot;His name and face are still a huge part of the city&#x27;s identity. There&#x27;s an annual Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival, and a Bix 7 road race with tens of thousands of runners, Bix T-shirts, bumper stickers, bobble-head dolls, the whole works.&quot; In 1971, on the 40th anniversary of Beiderbecke&#x27;s death, the Bix Beiderbecke Memorial Jazz Festival was founded in Davenport, Iowa, to honor the musician. In 1974, Sudhalter and Evans published their biography, &quot;Bix: Man and Legend&quot;, which was nominated for a National Book Award. In 1977, the Beiderbecke childhood home at 1934 Grand Avenue in Davenport was added to the National Register of Historic Places.
A dance piece by Twyla Tharp was created in 1971 to music by Bix Biederbecke with The Paul Whiteman Orchestra. Originally entitled &quot;True Confessions&quot;, it was later named &quot;The Bix Pieces.&quot;
&quot;Bix: &#x27;Ain&#x27;t None of Them Play Like Him Yet&quot;, a 1981 film documentary on Beiderbecke&#x27;s life directed and produced by Brigitte Berman, featured interviews with Hoagy Carmichael, Bill Challis and others, who knew and worked with Bix.

Beiderbecke&#x27;s music was featured in three British comedy drama television series, all written by Alan Plater: &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot; (1984), &quot;The Beiderbecke Tapes&quot; (1987), and &quot;The Beiderbecke Connection&quot; (1988). In 1991, the Italian director Pupi Avati released &quot;Bix: An Interpretation of a Legend&quot;. Filmed partially in the Beiderbecke home, which Avati had purchased and renovated, &quot;Bix&quot; was screened at the Cannes Film Festival.

At the beginning of the 21st century, Beiderbecke&#x27;s music continued to reside mostly out of the mainstream and some of the facts of his life are still debated, but scholars largely agree due in part to the influence of Sudhalter and Evans that he was an important innovator in early jazz; jazz cornetists, including Sudhalter (who died in 2008), and Tom Pletcher, closely emulate his style. In 2003, to mark the hundredth anniversary of his birth, the Greater Astoria Historical Society and other community organizations, spearheaded by Paul Maringelli and The Bix Beiderbecke Sunnyside Memorial Committee, erected a plaque in Beiderbecke&#x27;s honor at the apartment building in which he died in Queens. That same year, Frederick Turner published his novel &quot;1929&quot;, which followed the facts of Beiderbecke&#x27;s life fairly closely, focusing on his summer in Hollywood and featuring appearances by Al Capone and Clara Bow. The critic and musician Digby Fairweather sums up Beiderbecke&#x27;s musical legacy, arguing that &quot;with Louis Armstrong, Bix Beiderbecke was the most striking of jazz&#x27;s cornet (and of course, trumpet) fathers; a player who first captivated his 1920s generation and after his premature death, founded a dynasty of distinguished followers beginning with Jimmy McPartland and moving on down from there.&quot;

==Music==

===Style and influence===
In New Orleans, jazz had traditionally been expressed through polyphonic ensemble playing, with the various instruments weaving their parts into a single and coherent aural tapestry. By the early 1920s, developments in jazz saw the rise of the jazz soloist, with solos becoming longer and more complex. Both Beiderbecke and Armstrong were key figures in this evolution, as can be heard on their earliest recordings. According to the critic Terry Teachout, they are &quot;the two most influential figures in the early history of jazz&quot; and &quot;the twin lines of descent from which most of today&#x27;s jazz can be traced.&quot;

Beiderbecke&#x27;s cornet style is often described by contrasting it with Armstrong&#x27;s markedly different approach. Armstrong was a virtuoso on his instrument, and his solos often took advantage of that fact. Beiderbecke was largely, although not completely, self-taught, and the constraints imposed by that fact were evident in his music. While Armstrong often soared into the upper register, Beiderbecke stayed in the middle range, more interested in exploring the melody and harmonies than in dazzling the audience. Armstrong often emphasized the performance aspect of his playing, while Beiderbecke tended to stare at his feet while playing, uninterested in personally engaging his listeners. Armstrong was deeply influenced by the blues, while Beiderbecke was influenced as much by modernist composers such as Debussy and Ravel as by his fellow jazzmen.

Beiderbecke&#x27;s most famous solo was on &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, recorded February 4, 1927. It has been hailed as an important example of the &quot;jazz ballad style&quot;—&quot;a slow or medium-tempo piece played gently and sweetly, but not cloyingly, with no loss of muscle.&quot; The tune&#x27;s laid-back emotions hinted at what would become, in the 1950s, the cool jazz style, personified by Chet Baker and Bill Evans. More than that, though, &quot;Singin&#x27; the Blues&quot; has been noted for the way its improvisations feel less improvised than composed, with each phrase building on the last in a logical fashion. Benny Green describes the solo&#x27;s effect on practiced ears:

When a musician hears Bix&#x27;s solo on &#x27;Singing the Blues&#x27;, he becomes aware after two bars that the soloist knows exactly what he is doing and that he has an exquisite sense of discord and resolution. He knows also that this player is endowed with the rarest jazz gift of all, a sense of form which lends to an improvised performance a coherence which no amount of teaching can produce. The listening musician, whatever his generation or his style, recognizes Bix as a modern, modernism being not a style but an attitude.

Like Green, who made particular mention of Beiderbecke&#x27;s &quot;amount of teaching,&quot; the jazz historian Ted Gioia also has emphasized Beiderbecke&#x27;s lack of formal instruction, suggesting that it caused him to adopt &quot;an unusual, dry embouchure&quot; and &quot;unconventional fingerings,&quot; which he retained for the rest of his life. Gioia points to &quot;a characteristic streak of obstinacy&quot; in Beiderbecke that provokes &quot;this chronic disregard of the tried-and-true.&quot; He argues that this stubbornness was behind Beiderbecke&#x27;s decision not to switch from cornet to trumpet when many other musicians, including Armstrong, did so. In addition, Gioia highlights Beiderbecke&#x27;s precise timing, relaxed delivery, and pure tone, which contrasted with &quot;the dirty, rough-edged sound&quot; of King Oliver and his protégé Armstrong, whose playing was often more energetic and whose style held more sway early in the 1920s than Beiderbecke&#x27;s.

Beiderbecke&#x27;s playing – both as a cornetist and a pianist – had a profound effect on a number of his contemporaries. Eddie Condon, for instance, described Beiderbecke&#x27;s cornet playing as &quot;like a girl saying yes&quot; and also wrote of being amazed by Beiderbecke&#x27;s piano playing: &quot;All my life I had been listening to music […] But I had never heard anything remotely like what Beiderbecke played. For the first time I realized music isn&#x27;t all the same, it had become an entirely new set of sounds&quot; &quot;I tried to explain Bix to the gang,&quot; Hoagy Carmichael wrote, but &quot;[i]t was no good, like the telling of a vivid, personal dream […] the emotion couldn&#x27;t be transmitted.&quot;

Mezz Mezzrow described Beiderbecke&#x27;s tone as being &quot;pickled in alcohol […] I have never heard a tone like he got before or since. He played mostly open horn, every note full, big, rich and round, standing out like a pearl, loud but never irritating or jangling, with a powerful drive that few white musicians had in those days.&quot;

Some critics have highlighted &quot;Jazz Me Blues&quot;, recorded with the Wolverines on February 18, 1924, as being particularly important to understanding Beiderbecke&#x27;s style. Although it was one of his earliest recordings, the hallmarks of his playing are evident. &quot;The overall impression we get from this solo, as in all of Bix at his best,&quot; writes the trumpeter Randy Sandke, &quot;is that every note is spontaneous yet inevitable.&quot; Richard Hadlock describes Beiderbecke&#x27;s contribution to &quot;Jazz Me Blues&quot; as &quot;an ordered solo that seems more inspired by clarinetists Larry Shields of the ODJB and Leon Roppolo of the NORK than by other trumpet players.&quot; He goes on to suggest that clarinetists, by virtue of their not being tied to the melody as much as cornetists and trumpet players, could explore harmonies.

&quot;Jazz Me Blues&quot; was also important because it introduced what has been called the &quot;correlated chorus&quot;, a method of improvising that Beiderbecke&#x27;s Davenport friend Esten Spurrier attributed to both Beiderbecke and Armstrong. &quot;Louis departed greatly from all cornet players in his ability to compose a close-knit individual 32 measures with all phrases compatible with each other&quot;, Spurrier told the biographers Sudhalter and Evans, &quot;so Bix and I always credited Louis as being the father of the correlated chorus: play two measures, then two related, making four measures, on which you played another four measures related to the first four, and so on ad infinitum to the end of the chorus. So the secret was simple—a series of related phrases.&quot;

Beiderbecke plays piano on his recordings &quot;Big Boy&quot; (October 8, 1924), &quot;For No Reason at All in C&quot; (May 13, 1927), &quot;Wringin&#x27; and Twistin&#x27;&quot; (September 17, 1927)—all with ensembles—and his only solo recorded work, &quot;In a Mist&quot; (September 8, 1927). Critic Frank Murphy argues that many of the same characteristics that mark Beiderbecke on the cornet are also reflected in his piano playing: the uncharacteristic fingering, the emphasis on inventive harmonies, and the correlated choruses. Those inventive harmonies, on both cornet and piano, pointed the way to future developments in jazz, particularly bebop.

===Compositions===
Bix Beiderbecke wrote or co-wrote six instrumental compositions during his career:

* &quot;Davenport Blues&quot; (1925)
* &quot;In a Mist (Bixology)&quot; (1927)
* &quot;For No Reason at All in C&quot; (1927) with Frank Trumbauer
* &quot;Candlelights&quot; (1930)
* &quot;Flashes&quot; (1931)
* &quot;In the Dark&quot; (1931)

&quot;Candlelights&quot;, &quot;Flashes&quot;, and &quot;In the Dark&quot; are piano compositions transcribed with the help of Bill Challis but never recorded by Beiderbecke. Two additional compositions were attributed to him by two other jazz composers: &quot;Betcha I Getcha&quot;, attributed to Beiderbecke as a co-composer by Joe Venuti, the composer of the song, and &quot;Cloudy&quot;, attributed to Beiderbecke by composer as a composition from circa 1924.

<doc id="41536" wikidata="Q4030" url="?curid=41536" title="Duke Ellington">
<text>Edward Kennedy &quot;Duke&quot; Ellington (April 29, 1899 – May 24, 1974) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and leader of his eponymous jazz orchestra from 1924 through the rest of his life. 

Born and raised in Washington, D.C., Ellington was based in New York City from the mid-1920s and gained a national profile through his orchestra&#x27;s appearances at the Cotton Club in Harlem. A master at writing miniatures for the three-minute 78 rpm recording format, Ellington wrote or collaborated on more than one thousand compositions; his extensive body of work is the largest recorded personal jazz legacy, and many of his pieces have become standards. He also recorded songs written by his bandsmen, such as Juan Tizol&#x27;s &quot;Caravan&quot;, which brought a Spanish tinge to big band jazz.

At the end of the 1930s, Ellington began a nearly thirty five-year collaboration with composer-arranger-pianist Billy Strayhorn, whom he called his writing and arranging companion. With Strayhorn, he composed multiple extended compositions, or suites, as well as many short pieces. For a few years at the beginning of Strayhorn&#x27;s involvement, Ellington&#x27;s orchestra featured bassist Jimmy Blanton and tenor saxophonist Ben Webster and reached what many claim to be a creative peak for the group. Some years later following a low-profile period, an appearance by Ellington and his orchestra at the Newport Jazz Festival in July 1956 led to a major revival and regular world tours. Ellington recorded for most American record companies of his era, performed in and scored several films, and composed a handful of stage musicals.

Although a pivotal figure in the history of jazz, in the opinion of Gunther Schuller and Barry Kernfeld, &quot;the most significant composer of the genre&quot;, Ellington himself embraced the phrase &quot;beyond category&quot;, considering it a liberating principle, and referring to his music as part of the more general category of American Music. Ellington was known for his inventive use of the orchestra, or big band, as well as for his eloquence and charisma. He was awarded a posthumous Pulitzer Prize Special Award for music in 1999.

==Early life and education==
Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (née Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs, and James preferred operatic arias. They lived with Daisy&#x27;s parents at 2129 Ida Place (now Ward Place) NW, in D.C.&#x27;s West End neighborhood. Duke&#x27;s father was born in Lincolnton, North Carolina, on April 15, 1879, and in 1886, moved to D.C. with his parents. Daisy Kennedy was born in Washington, D.C., on January 4, 1879, the daughter of two former American slaves. James Ellington made s for the United States Navy.

When Ellington was a child, his family showed racial pride and support in their home, as did many other families. African Americans in D.C. worked to protect their children from the era&#x27;s Jim Crow laws.

At the age of seven, Ellington began taking piano lessons from Marietta Clinkscales. Daisy surrounded her son with dignified women to reinforce his manners and teach him elegance. His childhood friends noticed that his casual, offhand manner and dapper dress gave him the bearing of a young nobleman, so they began calling him &quot;Duke&quot;. Ellington credited his friend Edgar McEntee for the nickname: &quot;I think he felt that in order for me to be eligible for his constant companionship, I should have a title. So he called me Duke.&quot;

Though Ellington took piano lessons, he was more interested in baseball. &quot;President [Theodore] Roosevelt would come on his horse sometimes, and &quot;stop and watch us play,&quot; he recalled. Ellington went to Armstrong Technical High School in Washington, D.C. His first job was selling peanuts at Washington Senators baseball games.

Ellington started sneaking into Frank Holiday&#x27;s Poolroom at age fourteen. Hearing the music of the poolroom pianists ignited Ellington&#x27;s love for the instrument, and he began to take his piano studies seriously. Among the many piano players he listened to were Doc Perry, Lester Dishman, Louis Brown, Turner Layton, Gertie Wells, Clarence Bowser, Sticky Mack, Blind Johnny, Cliff Jackson, Claude Hopkins, Phil Wurd, Caroline Thornton, Luckey Roberts, Eubie Blake, Joe Rochester, and Harvey Brooks.

In the summer of 1914, while working as a soda jerk at the Poodle Dog Café, Ellington wrote his first composition, &quot;Soda Fountain Rag&quot; (also known as the &quot;Poodle Dog Rag&quot;). He created the piece by ear, as he had not yet learned to read and write music. &quot;I would play the &#x27;Soda Fountain Rag&#x27; as a one-step, two-step, waltz, tango, and fox trot&quot;, Ellington recalled. &quot;Listeners never knew it was the same piece. I was established as having my own repertoire.&quot; In his autobiography, &quot;Music is my Mistress&quot; (1973), Ellington wrote that he missed more lessons than he attended, feeling at the time that piano was not his talent.

Ellington continued listening to, watching, and imitating ragtime pianists, not only in Washington, D.C. but also in Philadelphia and Atlantic City, where he vacationed with his mother during the summer. He would sometimes hear strange music played by those who could not afford much sheet music, so for variations, they played the sheets upside down. Henry Lee Grant, a Dunbar High School music teacher, gave him private lessons in harmony. With the additional guidance of Washington pianist and band leader Oliver &quot;Doc&quot; Perry, Ellington learned to read sheet music, project a professional style, and improve his technique. Ellington was also inspired by his first encounters with stride pianists James P. Johnson and Luckey Roberts. Later in New York, he took advice from Will Marion Cook, Fats Waller, and Sidney Bechet. He started to play gigs in cafés and clubs in and around Washington, D.C. His attachment to music was so strong that in 1916 he turned down an art scholarship to the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn. Three months before graduating, he dropped out of Armstrong Manual Training School, where he was studying commercial art.

==Career==
===Early career===
Working as a freelance sign painter from 1917, Ellington began assembling groups to play for dances. In 1919, he met drummer Sonny Greer from New Jersey, who encouraged Ellington&#x27;s ambition to become a professional musician. Ellington built his music business through his day job. When a customer asked him to make a sign for a dance or party, he would ask if they had musical entertainment; if not, Ellington would offer to play for the occasion. He also had a messenger job with the U.S. Navy and State departments, where he made a wide range of contacts.

Ellington moved out of his parents&#x27; home and bought his own as he became a successful pianist. At first, he played in other ensembles, and in late 1917 formed his first group, &quot;The Duke&#x27;s Serenaders&quot; (&quot;Colored Syncopators&quot;, his telephone directory advertising proclaimed). He was also the group&#x27;s booking agent. His first play date was at the True Reformer&#x27;s Hall, where he took home 75 cents.

Ellington played throughout the D.C. area and into Virginia for private society balls and embassy parties. The band included childhood friend Otto Hardwick, who began playing the string bass, then moved to C-melody sax and finally settled on alto saxophone; Arthur Whetsel on trumpet; Elmer Snowden on banjo; and Sonny Greer on drums. The band thrived, performing for both African-American and white audiences, rare in the segregated society of the day.

When his drummer Sonny Greer was invited to join the Wilber Sweatman Orchestra in New York City, Ellington left his successful career in D.C. and moved to Harlem, ultimately becoming part of the Harlem Renaissance. New dance crazes such as the Charleston emerged in Harlem, as well as African-American musical theater, including Eubie Blake&#x27;s and Noble Sissle&#x27;s (the latter of whom was his neighbor) &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;. After the young musicians left the Sweatman Orchestra to strike out on their own, they found an emerging jazz scene that was highly competitive with difficult inroad. They hustled pool by day and played whatever gigs they could find. The young band met stride pianist Willie &quot;The Lion&quot; Smith, who introduced them to the scene and gave them some money. They played at rent-house parties for income. After a few months, the young musicians returned to Washington, D.C., feeling discouraged.

In June 1923, they played a gig in Atlantic City, New Jersey and another at the prestigious Exclusive Club in Harlem. This was followed in September 1923 by a move to the Hollywood Club (at 49th and Broadway) and a four-year engagement, which gave Ellington a solid artistic base. He was known to play the bugle at the end of each performance. The group was initially called Elmer Snowden and his Black Sox Orchestra and had seven members, including trumpeter James &quot;Bubber&quot; Miley. They renamed themselves The Washingtonians. Snowden left the group in early 1924, and Ellington took over as bandleader. After a fire, the club was re-opened as the Club Kentucky (often referred to as the Kentucky Club).

Ellington then made eight records in 1924, receiving composing credit on three including &quot;Choo Choo&quot;. In 1925, Ellington contributed four songs to &quot;Chocolate Kiddies&quot; starring Lottie Gee and Adelaide Hall, an all–African-American revue which introduced European audiences to African-American styles and performers. Duke Ellington and his Kentucky Club Orchestra grew to a group of ten players; they developed their own sound via the non-traditional expression of Ellington&#x27;s arrangements, the street rhythms of Harlem, and the exotic-sounding trombone growls and wah-wahs, high-squealing trumpets, and saxophone blues licks of the band members. For a short time, soprano saxophonist and clarinetist Sidney Bechet played with them, reportedly becoming the dominant personality in the group, with Sonny Greer saying Bechet &quot;fitted out the band like a glove&quot;. His presence resulted in friction with Miley and trombonist Charlie Irvis, whose styles differed from Bechet&#x27;s New Orleans-influenced playing. It was mainly Bechet&#x27;s unreliability—he was absent for three days in succession—which made his association with Ellington short-lived.

===Cotton Club engagement===
In October 1926, Ellington made an agreement with agent-publisher Irving Mills, giving Mills a 45% interest in Ellington&#x27;s future. Mills had an eye for new talent and published compositions by Hoagy Carmichael, Dorothy Fields, and Harold Arlen early in their careers. After recording a handful of acoustic sides during 1924–26, Ellington&#x27;s signing with Mills allowed him to record prolifically. However, sometimes he recorded different versions of the same tune. Mills regularly took a co-composer credit. From the beginning of their relationship, Mills arranged recording sessions on nearly every label, including Brunswick, Victor, Columbia, OKeh, Pathé (and its subsidiary, Perfect), the ARC/Plaza group of labels (Oriole, Domino, Jewel, Banner) and their dime-store labels (Cameo, Lincoln, Romeo), Hit of the Week, and Columbia&#x27;s cheaper labels (Harmony, Diva, Velvet Tone, Clarion), labels that gave Ellington popular recognition. On OKeh, his records were usually issued as The Harlem Footwarmers. In contrast, the Brunswicks were usually issued as The Jungle Band. Whoopee Makers and the Ten BlackBerries were other pseudonyms.

In September 1927, King Oliver turned down a regular booking for his group as the house band at Harlem&#x27;s Cotton Club; the offer passed to Ellington after Jimmy McHugh suggested him and Mills arranged an audition. Ellington had to increase from a six to 11-piece group to meet the requirements of the Cotton Club&#x27;s management for the audition, and the engagement finally began on December 4. With a weekly radio broadcast, the Cotton Club&#x27;s exclusively white and wealthy clientele poured in nightly to see them. At the Cotton Club, Ellington&#x27;s group performed all the music for the revues, which mixed comedy, dance numbers, vaudeville, burlesque, music, and illicit alcohol. The musical numbers were composed by Jimmy McHugh and the lyrics were written by Dorothy Fields (later Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler), with some Ellington originals mixed in. (Here, he moved in with a dancer, his second wife Mildred Dixon). Weekly radio broadcasts from the club gave Ellington national exposure. At the same time, Ellington also recorded Fields-JMcHugh and Fats Waller–Andy Razaf songs.

Although trumpeter Bubber Miley was a member of the orchestra for only a short period, he had a major influence on Ellington&#x27;s sound. As an early exponent of growl trumpet, Miley changed the sweet dance band sound of the group to one that was hotter, which contemporaries termed Jungle Style, which can be seen in his feature chorus in &quot;East St. Louis Toodle-Oo&quot; (1926). In October 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra recorded several compositions with Adelaide Hall. One side in particular, &quot;Creole Love Call&quot;, became a worldwide sensation and gave both Ellington and Hall their first hit record. Miley had composed most of &quot;Creole Love Call&quot; and &quot;Black and Tan Fantasy&quot;. An alcoholic, Miley had to leave the band before they gained wider fame. He died in 1932 at the age of 29, but he was an important influence on Cootie Williams, who replaced him.

In 1929, the Cotton Club Orchestra appeared on stage for several months in Florenz Ziegfeld&#x27;s Show Girl, along with vaudeville stars Jimmy Durante, Eddie Foy, Jr., Ruby Keeler, and with music and lyrics by George Gershwin and Gus Kahn. Will Vodery, Ziegfeld&#x27;s musical supervisor, recommended Ellington for the show. According to John Edward Hasse&#x27;s &quot;Beyond Category: The Life and Genius of Duke Ellington&quot;, &quot;Perhaps during the run of &quot;Show Girl&quot;, Ellington received what he later termed &#x27;valuable lessons in orchestration from Will Vody.&quot; In his 1946 biography, &quot;Duke Ellington&quot;, Barry Ulanov wrote:

Ellington&#x27;s film work began with &quot;Black and Tan&quot; (1929), a 19-minute all-African-American RKO short in which he played the hero &quot;Duke&quot;. He also appeared in the Amos &#x27;n&#x27; Andy film &quot;Check and Double Check&quot; released in 1930, which features the orchestra playing &quot;Old Man Blues&quot; in an extended ballroom scene. That year, Ellington and his Orchestra connected with a whole different audience in a concert with Maurice Chevalier and they also performed at the Roseland Ballroom, &quot;America&#x27;s foremost ballroom&quot;. Australian-born composer Percy Grainger was an early admirer and supporter. He wrote, &quot;The three greatest composers who ever lived are Bach, Delius and Duke Ellington. Unfortunately, Bach is dead, Delius is very ill but we are happy to have with us today The Duke&quot;. Ellington&#x27;s first period at the Cotton Club concluded in 1931.

===Early 1930s===
Ellington led the orchestra by conducting from the keyboard using piano cues and visual gestures; very rarely did he conduct using a baton. By 1932 his orchestra consisted of six brass instruments, four reeds, and a rhythm section of four players. As the leader, Ellington was not a strict disciplinarian; he maintained control of his orchestra with a combination of charm, humor, flattery, and astute psychology. A complex, private person, he revealed his feelings to only his closest intimates. He effectively used his public persona to deflect attention away from himself.

Ellington signed exclusively to Brunswick in 1932 and stayed with them through to late 1936 (albeit with a short-lived 1933–34 switch to Victor when Irving Mills temporarily moved his acts from Brunswick).

As the Depression worsened, the recording industry was in crisis, dropping over 90% of its artists by 1933. Ivie Anderson was hired as the Ellington Orchestra&#x27;s featured vocalist in 1931. She is the vocalist on &quot;It Don&#x27;t Mean a Thing (If It Ain&#x27;t Got That Swing)&quot; (1932) among other recordings. Sonny Greer had been providing occasional vocals and continued to do in a cross-talk feature with Anderson. Radio exposure helped maintain Ellington&#x27;s public profile as his orchestra began to tour. The other 78s of this era include: &quot;Mood Indigo&quot; (1930), &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot; (1933), &quot;Solitude&quot; (1934), and &quot;In a Sentimental Mood&quot; (1935).

While Ellington&#x27;s United States audience remained mainly African-American in this period, the orchestra had a significant following overseas. They traveled to England and Scotland in 1933, as well as France (three concerts at the Salle Pleyel in Paris) and the Netherlands before returning to New York. On June 12, 1933, the Duke Ellington Orchestra gave its British debut at the London Palladium; Ellington received an ovation when he walked on stage. They were one of 13 acts on the bill and were restricted to eight short numbers; the booking lasted until June 24. The British visit saw Ellington win praise from members of the serious music community, including composer Constant Lambert, which gave a boost to Ellington&#x27;s interest in composing longer works.
His longer pieces had already begun to appear. Ellington had composed and recorded &quot;Creole Rhapsody&quot; as early as 1931 (issued as both sides of a 12&quot; record for Victor and both sides of a 10&quot; record for Brunswick). A tribute to his mother, &quot;Reminiscing in Tempo&quot;, took four 10&quot; 78rpm record sides to record in 1935 after her death in that year. &quot;Symphony in Black&quot; (also 1935), a short film, featured his extended piece &#x27;A Rhapsody of Negro Life&#x27;. It introduced Billie Holiday, and won the Academy Award for Best Musical Short Subject. Ellington and his Orchestra also appeared in the features &quot;Murder at the Vanities&quot; and &quot;Belle of the Nineties&quot; (both 1934).

For agent Mills, the attention was a publicity triumph, as Ellington was now internationally known. On the band&#x27;s tour through the segregated South in 1934, they avoided some of the traveling difficulties of African Americans by touring in private railcars. These provided accessible accommodations, dining, and storage for equipment while avoiding the indignities of segregated facilities.

However, the competition intensified as swing bands like Benny Goodman&#x27;s began to receive widespread attention. Swing dancing became a youth phenomenon, particularly with white college audiences, and danceability drove record sales and bookings. Jukeboxes proliferated nationwide, spreading the gospel of swing. Ellington&#x27;s band could certainly swing, but their strengths were mood, nuance, and richness of composition, hence his statement &quot;jazz is music, the swing is business&quot;.

===Later 1930s===
From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra. He composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, such as &quot;Jeep&#x27;s Blues&quot; for Johnny Hodges, &quot;Yearning for Love&quot; for Lawrence Brown, &quot;Trumpet in Spades&quot; for Rex Stewart, &quot;Echoes of Harlem&quot; for Cootie Williams and &quot;Clarinet Lament&quot; for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club, which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington&#x27;s finances were tight. However, his situation improved in the following years.

After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills, though, continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels (the small groups had recorded for the latter) collapsed in late 1937. Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well-known sides continued to be recorded, &quot;Caravan&quot; in 1937, and &quot;I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart&quot; the following year.
Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed &quot;Sweet Pea&quot; for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, &quot;my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine&quot;. Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music but also arranged and polished many of Ellington&#x27;s works, becoming a second Ellington or &quot;Duke&#x27;s doppelgänger&quot;. It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The decade ended with a very successful European tour in 1939 just as World War II loomed in Europe.

===Early to mid-1940s===

Two musicians who joined Ellington at this time created a sensation in their own right, Jimmy Blanton and Ben Webster. Blanton was effectively hired on the spot in late October 1939, before Ellington was aware of his name, when he dropped in on a gig of Fate Marable in St Louis. The short-lived Blanton transformed the use of double bass in jazz, allowing it to function as a solo/melodic instrument rather than a rhythm instrument alone.Terminal illness forced him to leave by late 1941 after around two years. Ben Webster&#x27;s principal tenure with Ellington spanned 1939 to 1943. An ambition of his, he told his previous employer, Teddy Wilson, then leading a big band, that Ellington was the only rival he would leave Wilson for. He was the orchestra&#x27;s first regular tenor saxophonist and increased the size of the sax section to five for the first time. Much influenced by Johnny Hodges, he often credited Hodges with showing him &quot;how to play my horn&quot;. The two men sat next to each other in the orchestra.

Trumpeter Ray Nance joined, replacing Cootie Williams who had defected to Benny Goodman. Additionally, Nance added violin to the instrumental colors Ellington had at his disposal. Recordings exist of Nance&#x27;s first concert date on November 7, 1940, at Fargo, North Dakota. Privately made by Jack Towers and Dick Burris, these recordings were first legitimately issued in 1978 as &quot;Duke Ellington at Fargo, 1940 Live&quot;; they are among the earliest of innumerable live performances which survive. Nance was an occasional vocalist as well, although Herb Jeffries was the main male vocalist in this era (until 1943) while Al Hibbler (who replaced Jeffries in 1943) continued until 1951. Ivie Anderson left in 1942 for health reasons after 11 years, the longest term of any of Ellington&#x27;s vocalists.

Once more recording for Victor (from 1940), with the small groups being issued on their Bluebird label, three-minute masterpieces on 78 rpm record sides continued to flow from Ellington, Billy Strayhorn, Ellington&#x27;s son Mercer Ellington, and members of the orchestra. &quot;Cotton Tail&quot;, &quot;Main Stem&quot;, &quot;Harlem Air Shaft&quot;, &quot;Jack the Bear&quot;, and dozens of others date from this period. Strayhorn&#x27;s &quot;Take the &quot;A&quot; Train&quot;, a hit in 1941, became the band&#x27;s theme, replacing &quot;East St. Louis Toodle-Oo&quot;. Ellington and his associates wrote for an orchestra of distinctive voices displaying tremendous creativity. The commercial recordings from this era were re-issued in the three-CD collection, &quot;Never No Lament&quot;, in 2003.

Ellington&#x27;s long-term aim, though, was to extend the jazz form from that three-minute limit, of which he was an acknowledged master. While he had composed and recorded some extended pieces before, such works now became a regular feature of Ellington&#x27;s output. In this, he was helped by Strayhorn, who had enjoyed a more thorough training in the forms associated with classical music than Ellington. The first of these, &quot;Black, Brown, and Beige&quot; (1943), was dedicated to telling the story of African Americans and the place of slavery and the church in their history. &quot;Black, Brown and Beige&quot; debuted at Carnegie Hall on January 23, 1943, beginning an annual series of Ellington concerts at the venue over the next four years. While some jazz musicians had played at Carnegie Hall before, none had performed anything as elaborate as Ellington&#x27;s work. Unfortunately, starting a regular pattern, Ellington&#x27;s longer works were generally not well received.

A partial exception was &quot;Jump for Joy&quot;, a full-length musical based on themes of African-American identity, which debuted on July 10, 1941, at the Mayan Theater in Los Angeles. Hollywood actors John Garfield and Mickey Rooney invested in the production, and Charlie Chaplin and Orson Welles offered to direct. At one performance, Garfield insisted that Herb Jeffries, who was light-skinned, should wear makeup. Ellington objected in the interval and compared Jeffries to Al Jolson. The change was reverted. The singer later commented that the audience must have thought he was an entirely different character in the second half of the show.

Although it had sold-out performances and received positive reviews, it ran for only 122 performances until September 29, 1941, with a brief revival in November of that year. Its subject matter did not make it appealing to Broadway; Ellington had unfulfilled plans to take it there. Despite this disappointment, a Broadway production of Ellington&#x27;s &quot;Beggar&#x27;s Holiday&quot;, his sole book musical, premiered on December 23, 1946, under the direction of Nicholas Ray.

The settlement of the first recording ban of 1942–44, leading to an increase in royalties paid to musicians, had a severe effect on the financial viability of the big bands, including Ellington&#x27;s Orchestra. His income as a songwriter ultimately subsidized it. Although he always spent lavishly and drew a respectable income from the orchestra&#x27;s operations, the band&#x27;s income often just covered expenses. However, in 1943 Ellington asked Webster to leave; the saxophonist&#x27;s personality made his colleagues anxious and the saxophonist was regularly in conflict with the leader.

===Early post-war years===
Musicians enlisting in the military and travel restrictions made touring difficult for the big bands, and dancing became subject to a new tax, which continued for many years, affecting the choices of club owners. By the time World War II ended, the focus of popular music was shifting towards singing crooners such as Frank Sinatra and Jo Stafford. As the cost of hiring big bands had increased, club owners now found smaller jazz groups more cost-effective. Some of Ellington&#x27;s new works, such as the wordless vocal feature &quot;Transblucency&quot; (1946) with Kay Davis, were not going to have a similar reach as the newly emerging stars.
Ellington continued on his own course through these tectonic shifts. While Count Basie, like many other big bands at the time, was forced to disband his whole ensemble and work as an octet for a time, Ellington was able to tour most of Western Europe between April 6 and June 30, 1950, with the orchestra playing 74 dates over 77 days. During the tour, according to Sonny Greer, Ellington did not perform the newer works. However, Ellington&#x27;s extended composition, &quot;Harlem&quot; (1950), was in the process of being completed at this time. Ellington later presented its score to music-loving President Harry Truman. Also during his time in Europe, Ellington would compose the music for a stage production by Orson Welles. Titled &quot;Time Runs&quot; in Paris and &quot;An Evening With Orson Welles&quot; in Frankfurt, the variety show also featured a newly discovered Eartha Kitt, who performed Ellington&#x27;s original song &quot;Hungry Little Trouble&quot; as Helen of Troy.

In 1951, Ellington suffered a significant loss of personnel: Sonny Greer, Lawrence Brown, and, most importantly, Johnny Hodges left to pursue other ventures. However, only Greer was a permanent departee. Drummer Louie Bellson replaced Greer, and his &quot;Skin Deep&quot; was a hit for Ellington. Tenor player Paul Gonsalves had joined in December 1950 after periods with Count Basie and Dizzy Gillespie and stayed for the rest of his life, while Clark Terry joined in November 1951.

André Previn said in 1952: &quot;You know, Stan Kenton can stand in front of a thousand fiddles and a thousand brass and make a dramatic gesture and every studio arranger can nod his head and say, &quot;Oh, yes, that&#x27;s done like this.&quot; But Duke merely lifts his finger, three horns make a sound, and I don&#x27;t know what it is!&quot; However, by 1955, after three years of recording for Capitol, Ellington lacked a regular recording affiliation.

===Career revival===
Ellington&#x27;s appearance at the Newport Jazz Festival on July 7, 1956, returned him to wider prominence. The feature &quot;Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue&quot; comprised two tunes that had been in the band&#x27;s book since 1937. Ellington, who had abruptly ended the band&#x27;s scheduled set because of the late arrival of four key players, called the two tunes as the time was approaching midnight. Announcing that the two pieces would be separated by an interlude played by tenor saxophonist Paul Gonsalves, Ellington proceeded to lead the band through the two pieces, with Gonsalves&#x27; 27-chorus marathon solo whipping the crowd into a frenzy, leading the Maestro to play way beyond the curfew time despite urgent pleas from festival organizer George Wein to bring the program to an end.

The concert made international headlines, and led to one of only five &quot;Time&quot; magazine cover stories dedicated to a jazz musician, and resulted in an album produced by George Avakian that would become the best-selling LP of Ellington&#x27;s career. Much of the music on the LP was, in effect, simulated, with only about 40% actually from the concert itself. According to Avakian, Ellington was dissatisfied with aspects of the performance and felt the musicians had been under-rehearsed. The band assembled the next day to re-record several numbers with the addition of the faked sound of a crowd, none of which was disclosed to purchasers of the album. Not until 1999 was the concert recording properly released for the first time. The revived attention brought about by the Newport appearance should not have surprised anyone, Johnny Hodges had returned the previous year, and Ellington&#x27;s collaboration with Strayhorn was renewed around the same time, under terms more amenable to the younger man.

The original &quot;Ellington at Newport&quot; album was the first release in a new recording contract with Columbia Records which yielded several years of recording stability, mainly under producer Irving Townsend, who coaxed both commercial and artistic productions from Ellington.

In 1957, CBS (Columbia Records&#x27; parent corporation) aired a live television production of &quot;A Drum Is a Woman&quot;, an allegorical suite which received mixed reviews. Festival appearances at the new Monterey Jazz Festival and elsewhere provided venues for live exposure, and a European tour in 1958 was well received. &quot;Such Sweet Thunder&quot; (1957), based on Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and characters, and &quot;The Queen&#x27;s Suite&quot; (1958), dedicated to Britain&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth II, were products of the renewed impetus which the Newport appearance helped to create. However, the latter work was not commercially issued at the time. The late 1950s also saw Ella Fitzgerald record her &quot;Duke Ellington Songbook&quot; (Verve) with Ellington and his orchestra—a recognition that Ellington&#x27;s songs had now become part of the cultural canon known as the &#x27;Great American Songbook&#x27;.
Around this time Ellington and Strayhorn began to work on film scoring. The first of these was &quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; (1959), a courtroom drama directed by Otto Preminger and featuring James Stewart, in which Ellington appeared fronting a roadhouse combo. Film historians have recognized the score &quot;as a landmark—the first significant Hollywood film music by African Americans comprising non-diegetic music, that is, music whose source is not visible or implied by action in the film, like an on-screen band.&quot; The score avoided the cultural stereotypes which previously characterized jazz scores and rejected a strict adherence to visuals in ways that presaged the New Wave cinema of the &#x27;60s&quot;. Ellington and Strayhorn, always looking for new musical territory, produced suites for John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;Sweet Thursday&quot;, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Nutcracker Suite&quot; and Edvard Grieg&#x27;s &quot;Peer Gynt&quot;.

&quot;Anatomy of a Murder&quot; was followed by &quot;Paris Blues&quot; (1961), which featured Paul Newman and Sidney Poitier as jazz musicians. For this work, Ellington was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Score.

In the early 1960s, Ellington embraced recording with artists who had been friendly rivals in the past or were younger musicians who focused on later styles. The Ellington and Count Basie orchestras recorded together with the album &quot;First Time! The Count Meets the Duke&quot; (1961). During a period when Ellington was between recording contracts, he made records with Louis Armstrong (Roulette), Coleman Hawkins, John Coltrane (both for Impulse) and participated in a session with Charles Mingus and Max Roach which produced the &quot;Money Jungle&quot; (United Artists) album. He signed to Frank Sinatra&#x27;s new Reprise label, but the association with the label was short-lived.

Musicians who had previously worked with Ellington returned to the Orchestra as members: Lawrence Brown in 1960 and Cootie Williams in 1962.

The writing and playing of music is a matter of intent... You can&#x27;t just throw a paintbrush against the wall and call whatever happens art. My music fits the tonal personality of the player. I think too strongly in terms of altering my music to fit the performer to be impressed by accidental music. You can&#x27;t take doodling seriously.

He was now performing worldwide and spent a significant part of each year on overseas tours. As a consequence, he formed new working relationships with artists from around the world, including the Swedish vocalist Alice Babs, and the South African musicians Dollar Brand and Sathima Bea Benjamin (&quot;A Morning in Paris&quot;, 1963/1997).

Ellington wrote an original score for director Michael Langham&#x27;s production of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Timon of Athens&quot; at the Stratford Festival in Ontario, Canada, which opened on July 29, 1963. Langham has used it for several subsequent productions, including a much later adaptation by Stanley Silverman which expands the score with some of Ellington&#x27;s best-known works.

===Last years===
Ellington was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 1965. However, no prize was ultimately awarded that year. Then 66 years old, he joked: &quot;Fate is being kind to me. Fate doesn&#x27;t want me to be famous too young.&quot; In 1999, he was posthumously awarded a special Pulitzer Prize &quot;commemorating the centennial year of his birth, in recognition of his musical genius, which evoked aesthetically the principles of democracy through the medium of jazz and thus made an indelible contribution to art and culture.&quot;

In September 1965, he premiered the first of his Sacred Concerts. He created a jazz Christian liturgy. Although the work received mixed reviews, Ellington was proud of the composition and performed it dozens of times. This concert was followed by two others of the same type in 1968 and 1973, known as the Second and Third Sacred Concerts. Many saw the Sacred Music suites as an attempt to reinforce commercial support for organized religion. However, Ellington simply said it was &quot;the most important thing I&#x27;ve done&quot;. The Steinway piano upon which the Sacred Concerts were composed is part of the collection of the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Museum of American History. Like Haydn and Mozart, Ellington conducted his orchestra from the piano—he always played the keyboard parts when the Sacred Concerts were performed.

Duke turned 65 in the spring of 1964 but showed no signs of slowing down as he continued to make recordings of significant works such as &quot;The Far East Suite&quot; (1966), &quot;New Orleans Suite&quot; (1970), &quot;The Afro-Eurasian Eclipse&quot; (1971) and the &quot;Latin American Suite&quot; (1972), much of it inspired by his world tours. It was during this time that he recorded his only album with Frank Sinatra, titled &quot;Francis A. &amp; Edward K.&quot; (1967). In August 1972, he recorded several solo piano tracks at Mediasound Studios in New York, with the then brand-new assistant engineer Bob Clearmountain. The session remained unreleased until 2017, when Storyville Records released it as &quot;An Intimate Piano Session&quot;. 

In 1972–1974 Ellington worked on his only opera, &quot;Queenie Pie&quot;, together with Maurice Peress. Ellington got an idea to write an opera about a black beautician in the 1930s, but did not finish it.

Among the last shows Ellington and his orchestra performed were one on March 21, 1973, at Purdue University&#x27;s Hall of Music, two on March 22, 1973, at the Sturges-Young Auditorium in Sturgis, Michigan and the &quot;Eastbourne Performance&quot; on December 1, 1973, later issued on LP. Ellington performed what is considered his final full concert in a ballroom at Northern Illinois University on March 20, 1974. Since 1980, that ballroom has been dedicated as the &quot;Duke Ellington Ballroom&quot;.

==Personal life==
Ellington married his high school sweetheart, Edna Thompson (d. 1967), on July 2, 1918, when he was 19. The next spring, on March 11, 1919, Edna gave birth to their only child, Mercer Kennedy Ellington.

Ellington was joined in New York City by his wife and son in the late 1920s, but the couple soon permanently separated. According to her obituary in &quot;Jet&quot; magazine, she was &quot;homesick for Washington&quot; and returned. In 1929, Ellington became the companion of Mildred Dixon, who traveled with him, managed Tempo Music, inspired songs, such as &quot;Sophisticated Lady&quot;, at the peak of his career, and raised his son.

In 1938, he left his family (his son was 19) and moved in with Beatrice &quot;Evie&quot; Ellis, a Cotton Club employee. Their relationship, though stormy, continued after Ellington met and formed a relationship with Fernanda de Castro Monte in the early 1960s. Ellington supported both women for the rest of his life.

Ellington&#x27;s sister Ruth (1915–2004) later ran Tempo Music, his music publishing company. Ruth&#x27;s second husband was the bass-baritone McHenry Boatwright, whom she met when he sang at her brother&#x27;s funeral. As an adult, son Mercer Ellington (d. 1996) played trumpet and piano, led his own band, and worked as his father&#x27;s business manager.

Ellington was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha and was a Freemason associated with Prince Hall Freemasonry.

==Death==
Ellington died on May 24, 1974, of complications from lung cancer and pneumonia, a few weeks after his 75th birthday. At his funeral, attended by over 12,000 people at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Ella Fitzgerald summed up the occasion: &quot;It&#x27;s a very sad day. A genius has passed.&quot;

He was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery, the Bronx, New York City.

==Legacy==
===Memorialized===
Numerous memorials have been dedicated to Duke Ellington in cities from New York and Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles.

In Ellington&#x27;s birthplace, Washington, D.C., the Duke Ellington School of the Arts educates talented students who are considering careers in the arts by providing art instruction and academic programs to prepare students for post-secondary education and professional careers. In 1974, the District renamed the Calvert Street Bridge, originally built in 1935, as the Duke Ellington Bridge. Another school is P.S. 004 Duke Ellington in New York.

In 1989, a bronze plaque was attached to the newly named Duke Ellington Building at 2121 Ward Place NW. In 2012, the new owner of the building commissioned a mural by Aniekan Udofia that appears above the lettering &quot;Duke Ellington&quot;. In 2010 the triangular park, across the street from Duke Ellington&#x27;s birth site, at the intersection of New Hampshire and M Streets NW, was named the Duke Ellington Park.

Ellington&#x27;s residence at 2728 Sherman Avenue NW, during the years 1919–1922, is marked by a bronze plaque.

On February 24, 2009, the United States Mint issued a coin with Duke Ellington on it, making him the first African American to appear by himself on a circulating U.S. coin. Ellington appears on the reverse (tails) side of the District of Columbia quarter. The coin is part of the U.S. Mint&#x27;s program honoring the District and the U.S. territories and celebrates Ellington&#x27;s birthplace in the District of Columbia. Ellington is depicted on the quarter seated at a piano, sheet music in hand, along with the inscription &quot;Justice for All&quot;, which is the District&#x27;s motto.

In 1986, a United States commemorative stamp was issued featuring Ellington&#x27;s likeness.

Ellington lived out his final years in Manhattan, in a townhouse at 333 Riverside Drive near West 106th Street. His sister Ruth, who managed his publishing company, also lived there, and his son Mercer lived next door. After his death, West 106th Street was officially renamed Duke Ellington Boulevard.

A large memorial to Ellington, created by sculptor Robert Graham, was dedicated in 1997 in New York&#x27;s Central Park, near Fifth Avenue and 110th Street, an intersection named Duke Ellington Circle.

A statue of Ellington at a piano is featured at the entrance to UCLA&#x27;s Schoenberg Hall. According to &quot;UCLA&quot; magazine:

The Essentially Ellington High School Jazz Band Competition and Festival is a nationally renowned annual competition for prestigious high school bands. Started in 1996 at Jazz at Lincoln Center, the festival is named after Ellington because of the significant focus that the festival places on his works.

===Tributes===
After Duke died, his son Mercer took over leadership of the orchestra, continuing until he died in 1996. Like the Count Basie Orchestra, this &quot;ghost band&quot; continued to release albums for many years. &quot;Digital Duke&quot;, credited to The Duke Ellington Orchestra, won the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album. Mercer Ellington had been handling all administrative aspects of his father&#x27;s business for several decades. Mercer&#x27;s children continue a connection with their grandfather&#x27;s work.

Gunther Schuller wrote in 1989:

Ellington composed incessantly to the very last days of his life. Music was indeed his mistress; it was his total life and his commitment to it was incomparable and unalterable. In jazz he was a giant among giants. And in twentieth century music, he may yet one day be recognized as one of the half-dozen greatest masters of our time.

Martin Williams said: &quot;Duke Ellington lived long enough to hear himself named among our best composers. And since his death in 1974, it has become not at all uncommon to see him named, along with Charles Ives, as the greatest composer we have produced, regardless of category.&quot;

In the opinion of Bob Blumenthal of &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; in 1999: &quot;[i]n the century since his birth, there has been no greater composer, American or otherwise, than Edward Kennedy Ellington.&quot;

In 2002, scholar Molefi Kete Asante listed Duke Ellington on his list of 100 Greatest African Americans.
His compositions have been revisited by artists and musicians worldwide as sources of inspiration and a bedrock of their performing careers:
* Dave Brubeck dedicated &quot;The Duke&quot; (1954) to Ellington and it became a standard covered by others, including Miles Davis on his &quot;Miles Ahead&quot;, 1957. The album &quot;The Real Ambassadors&quot; has a vocal version of this piece, &quot;You Swing Baby (The Duke)&quot;, with lyrics by Iola Brubeck, Dave Brubeck&#x27;s wife. It is performed as a duet between Louis Armstrong and Carmen McRae. It is also dedicated to Duke Ellington.
* Miles Davis created his half-hour dirge &quot;He Loved Him Madly&quot; (on &quot;Get Up with It&quot;) as a tribute to Ellington one month after his death.
* Charles Mingus, who had been fired by Ellington decades earlier, wrote the elegy &quot;Duke Ellington&#x27;s Sound Of Love&quot; in 1974, a few months after Ellington&#x27;s death.
* Stevie Wonder wrote the song &quot;Sir Duke&quot; as a tribute to Ellington, which appeared on his album &quot;Songs in the Key of Life&quot; released in 1976.

There are hundreds of albums dedicated to the music of Duke Ellington and Billy Strayhorn by artists famous and obscure. &quot;Sophisticated Ladies&quot;, an award-winning 1981 musical revue, incorporated many tunes from Ellington&#x27;s repertoire. A second Broadway musical interpolating Ellington&#x27;s music, &quot;Play On!&quot;, debuted in 1997.

<text>Rahsaan Roland Kirk (born Ronald Theodore Kirk; August 7, 1935 – December 5, 1977), known earlier in his career simply as Roland Kirk, was an American jazz multi-instrumentalist who played tenor saxophone, flute, and many other instruments. He was renowned for his onstage vitality, during which virtuoso improvisation was accompanied by comic banter, political ranting, and the ability to play several instruments simultaneously.

== Life ==
Ronald Theodore Kirk was born in Columbus, Ohio, where he lived in a neighborhood known as Flytown. He became blind at two years old, which he said was a result of improper medical treatment. As a teenager, Kirk studied at the Ohio State School for the Blind. By 15, he was on the road playing rhythm and blues on weekends with Boyd Moore&#x27;s band. According to saxophonist Hank Crawford, &quot;He would be like this 14-year-old blind kid playing two horns at once. They would bring him out and he would tear the joint up.&quot; Crawford heard him during this period and said he was unbelievable. He remarked, &quot;Now they had him doing all kinds of goofy stuff but he was playing the two horns and he was playing the shit out of them. He was an original from the beginning.&quot; Kirk felt compelled by a dream to transpose two letters in his first name to make &quot;Roland&quot;. In 1970, Kirk added &quot;Rahsaan&quot; to his name after hearing it in a dream.

Kirk was politically outspoken. During his concerts, between songs he often talked about topical issues, including African-American history and the Civil Rights Movement. His monologues were often laced with satire and absurdist humor. According to comedian Jay Leno, when Leno toured with Kirk as Kirk&#x27;s opening act, Kirk would introduce him by saying: &quot;I want to introduce a young brother who knows the black experience and knows all about the white devils... Please welcome Jay Leno!&quot;

In 1975, Kirk had a major stroke which led to partial paralysis of one side of his body. He continued to perform and record, modifying his instruments to enable him to play with one arm. At a live performance at Ronnie Scott&#x27;s Jazz Club in London he even managed to play two instruments, and carried on to tour internationally and to appear on television.

He died from a second stroke in 1977, aged 42, the morning after performing in the Frangipani Room of the Indiana University Student Union in Bloomington, Indiana.

Columbus Mayor Jack Sensenbrenner had declared Saturday, Dec. 10, 1970, &quot;Rahsaan day,&quot; according to the Columbus Dispatch obituary that appeared on Thursday, Dec. 8, 1977.

Kirk&#x27;s hometown of Columbus was not appreciative of his work for most of his career. He was thrown out of a local nightclub because his music was too difficult to understand, and he left for Los Angeles and further touring. In the 21st century, jazz fans in Columbus have been embracing his legacy.

== Instruments and techniques ==

Kirk&#x27;s musical career spans from 1955 until his death in 1977. He preferred to lead his own bands and rarely performed as a sideman, although he did record with arranger Quincy Jones, drummer Roy Haynes and worked with bassist Charles Mingus. One of his best-known recorded performances is the lead flute and solo on Jones&#x27; &quot;Soul Bossa Nova&quot;, a 1964 hit song repopularized in the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; films.

Kirk&#x27;s multi-instrumentality was credited as having a substantial musical conception. This inclusivity included blues music, a love of stride piano and early jazz, and an appreciation for pop tunes. But his vision was much wider than that of most of his contemporaries. According to producer Joel Dorn, he was also hugely knowledgeable about classical music. Pieces by Saint-Saëns, Hindemith, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak and Villa-Lobos would all feature on his albums over the years, alongside standards, pop songs and original compositions. Rahsaan&#x27;s influences went beyond jazz and consequentially, he preferred the term &quot;Black Classical Music&quot;.

His playing was generally rooted in soul jazz or hard bop, but Kirk&#x27;s knowledge of jazz history allowed him to draw from many elements of the music&#x27;s past, from ragtime to swing and free jazz. Kirk also absorbed classical influences, and his artistry reflected elements of pop music by composers such as Smokey Robinson and Burt Bacharach, as well as Duke Ellington, John Coltrane and other jazz musicians.

Kirk played and collected many musical instruments, mainly multiple saxophones, clarinets and flutes. His primary saxophones were a standard tenor saxophone, stritch (a straight alto sax lacking the instrument&#x27;s conventional upturned bell), and a manzello (a modified saxello soprano sax, with a larger, upturned bell). A number of his instruments were exotic or homemade. Kirk modified instruments himself to accommodate his simultaneous playing technique. Critic Gary Giddins wrote that Kirk&#x27;s tenor playing alone was enough to bring him &quot;renown&quot;.

Usually, he appeared on stage with all three horns hanging around his neck, and at times he would play a number of these horns at once, harmonizing with himself, or sustain a note for lengthy durations by using circular breathing. He used the multiple horns to play true chords, essentially functioning as a one-man saxophone section. Kirk insisted that he was only trying to emulate the sounds he heard in his head. Even while playing two or three saxophones at once, the music was intricate, powerful jazz with a strong feel for the blues. The live album &quot;Bright Moments&quot; (1973) is an example of one of his shows.

Kirk was also an influential flute player, including recorders. According to Giddins, Kirk was the first major jazz innovator on flute after Eric Dolphy (who died in 1964). Kirk employed several techniques, including singing or humming into the flute at the same time as playing. Another was to play the standard transverse flute at the same time as a nose flute.

He played a variety of other instruments, including whistles; often kept a gong within reach; the clarinet, harmonica, English horn, and was a competent trumpeter. He utilized unique approaches, such as playing a trumpet with a saxophone mouthpiece.

He also made use of non-musical devices, such as alarm clocks, sirens, or a section of common garden hose (dubbed &quot;the black mystery pipes&quot;). From the early 1970s, his studio recordings used tape-manipulated &quot;musique concrète&quot; and primitive electronic sounds before such things became commonplace.
&quot;The Case of the 3 Sided Dream in Audio Color&quot; was a unique album in the annals of recorded jazz and popular music. It was a two-LP set, with Side 4 apparently &quot;blank&quot;, the label not indicating any content. However, once word of &quot;the secret message&quot; got around among Rahsaan&#x27;s fans, one would find that about 12 minutes into Side 4 appeared the first of two telephone answering machine messages recorded by Kirk, the second following soon thereafter (but separated by more blank grooves). The surprise impact of these segments appearing on &quot;blank&quot; Side 4 was lost on the initial CD reissue of this album (though restored as track 20 on the CD re-release).

He gleaned information on what was happening in the world via radio and TV. His later recordings often incorporated his spoken commentaries on current events, including Richard Nixon&#x27;s involvement in the Watergate scandal. The &quot;3-Sided Dream&quot; album was a &quot;concept album&quot; which incorporated &quot;found&quot; or environmental sounds and tape loops, tapes being played backwards, etc. Snippets of Billie Holiday singing are also heard briefly. The album even confronts the rise of influence of computers in society, as Rahsaan threatens to pull the plug on the machine trying to tell him what to do.

In the album &quot;Other Folks&#x27; Music&quot; the spoken words of Paul Robeson, another outspoken black artist, can be briefly heard.

== Legacy and influence ==
* Ian Anderson, leader and flautist of Jethro Tull recorded a version of Kirk&#x27;s &quot;Serenade to a Cuckoo&quot; on their first album &quot;This Was&quot; (1968). Roland Kirk was the very reason Anderson thought he could bring a flute into rock music. Anderson learned Kirk&#x27;s vocalizing style on the flute and Anderson&#x27;s flute playing became the signature element of Jethro Tull&#x27;s sound. Kirk and Anderson took the flute&#x27;s refined upper crust classical nature and commonized it. Anderson got to know Kirk at the 1969 Newport Jazz Festival where they both performed the same night. Anderson said of Kirk &quot;There&#x27;s something about these colourful shamans. They can tease us, but we go along with it, because we know they&#x27;re touched by genius, but at the same time there&#x27;s a little bit of the snake oil for sale.&quot;
* Jeff Coffin, the saxophonist in Béla Fleck and the Flecktones was heavily influenced by Kirk&#x27;s music and says he learned through Kirk that it&#x27;s OK to experiment with an instrument. He used Kirk&#x27;s multi-horn inventions with the Flecktones and on his solo album &quot;Mutopia&quot;.
* Guitarist Jimi Hendrix &quot;idolized&quot; Kirk, and even hoped to collaborate with him one day.
* Frank Zappa had been influenced by Kirk&#x27;s music to a considerable extent early in his career. In the liner notes to his 1966 debut album with The Mothers of Invention, &quot;Freak Out!&quot;, Zappa cites Kirk as one of many in a lengthy list of personal musical influences. Kirk and Zappa performed live together at least once, at the 1969 Boston Globe Jazz Festival.
*Derek Trucks, a huge Kirk fan, recorded Kirk&#x27;s composition &quot;Volunteered Slavery&quot; with his namesake group for the 2004 album &quot;Live at Georgia Theatre&quot;, the 2006 studio album &quot;Songlines&quot;, and the DVD &quot;Songlines Live&quot;. He said that hearing Kirk&#x27;s music &quot;felt much the same way those Hendrix records felt, that he was blowing the rules wide open...&quot;
* David Jackson, of Van der Graaf Generator, was also highly influenced by the style and technique of Kirk, and he plays multiple saxophones simultaneously since at least 1969.
* Guitarist Michael Angelo Batio said in a 2008 interview with &quot;Ultimate Guitar Archive&quot; that Kirk&#x27;s playing of two saxophones at once inspired him to create his &quot;double guitar&quot;.
* T.J. Kirk was a band named after the three artists it tributed: Thelonious Monk, James Brown, and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. Formed by eight-string guitarist Charlie Hunter as a side group to his own self-titled band, the band&#x27;s other members include Scott Amendola, Will Bernard, and John Schott.
* Paul Weller cited the Kirk album &quot;I Talk with the Spirits&quot; (1964) as one of his &quot;Most Influential Albums&quot; in an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; in 2009.
* Björk named &quot;The Inflated Tear&quot; as one of her favorite jazz pieces, calling it &quot;primitive and instinctive&quot;, &quot;open to nature&quot;, and &quot;punk&quot;.
* Davey Payne&#x27;s twin saxophone solo on &quot;Hit Me with Your Rhythm Stick&quot; (Ian Dury &amp; the Blockheads, 1978) was inspired by Kirk.
* Terry Edwards&#x27; twin saxophone solo on &quot;The Ministry of Defence&quot; by PJ Harvey (2016) was inspired by Kirk.
* Eric Burdon and War&#x27;s 1970 debut album &quot;Eric Burdon Declares War&quot; features the track &quot;The Vision of Rassan&quot;, which is broken up into two pieces &quot;Dedication&quot; and &quot;Roll on Kirk&quot;.
* The English post-punk group Rip Rig + Panic were named after the album of the same name by Roland Kirk.
* Clutch pay tribute to Roland Kirk in the song &quot;Three Golden Horns&quot; off their 2022 album &quot;Sunrise on Slaughter Beach.&quot;
* Jazz producer berlioz pays homage to Roland Kirk in the track &quot;ode to rahsaan&quot; from berlioz&#x27;s 2024 album &quot;open this wall.&quot;

<text>John McLoughlin, baptized Jean-Baptiste McLoughlin, (October 19, 1784 – September 3, 1857) was a French-Canadian, later American, Chief Factor and Superintendent of the Columbia District of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company at Fort Vancouver from 1824 to 1845. He was later known as the &quot;Father of Oregon&quot; for his role in assisting the American cause in the Oregon Country. In the late 1840s, his general store in Oregon City was famous as the last stop on the Oregon Trail.

==Early days==
McLoughlin was born in October 1784 in Rivière-du-Loup, Quebec, and was of Scottish and French Canadian descent. He lived with his great uncle, Colonel William Fraser, for a while as a child. Though baptized Roman Catholic, he was raised Anglican. In his later life, he returned to the Roman Catholic faith.

In 1798, he began to study medicine under Sir James Fisher of Quebec. McLoughlin was granted a licence to practice medicine in Lower Canada (now Quebec) in 1803. He evidently completed his course, as he is widely referred to as &quot;Dr. John McLoughlin&quot;.

==North West Company==
McLoughlin was hired as a physician at Fort William, the inland headquarters and a fur trade post of the North West Company on Lake Superior. There he became a trader and mastered several Indian languages. In 1814, he became a partner in the company.

In 1816, McLoughlin was charged with complicity in the massacre at the Red River Colony after the Battle of Seven Oaks. He and all the other parties from the North West Company were exonerated. The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company was found culpable by the appointed Royal Commissioner at its trial on October 30, 1818, and in the later prosecutions by Lord Selkirk and the successful counter-suits.

McLoughlin was instrumental in the negotiations leading to the North West Company&#x27;s 1821 merger with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He was promoted to head the Lac la Pluie district temporarily shortly after the merger.

==Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company==


In 1824, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company appointed McLoughlin, already a Chief Factor, as Superintendent of the Columbia Department (roughly parallel to what Americans know as the Oregon Country), and Peter Skene Ogden was appointed to assist him. At the time, the region was under joint occupation of both the United States and Britain pursuant to the Treaty of 1818. Upon his arrival, McLoughlin determined that the headquarters of the company at Fort Astoria (now Astoria, Oregon), at the mouth of the Columbia River, was unfit. The York Factory Express trade route had evolved from an earlier express brigade used by the North West Company between Fort George, founded in 1811 by John Jacob Astor&#x27;s American Fur Company) at the mouth of the Columbia River, to Fort William on Lake Superior.

In the 1821 merger with the North West Company, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company gained control of North West Company trading posts west of the Rocky Mountains. They established headquarters at Fort George (formerly Astoria). George Simpson, Governor of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, visited the Columbia District in 1824–25, journeying from York Factory. He investigated a quicker route than previously used, following the Saskatchewan River and crossing the mountains at Athabasca Pass. This route was thereafter followed by the York Factory Express brigades.

===Fort Vancouver===
McLoughlin built Fort Vancouver as a replacement for Fort George, on the north side of the Columbia River, a few miles upstream from the confluence of the Columbia and Willamette Rivers. The site was chosen by Sir George Simpson. The post was opened for business on March 19, 1825. From his Columbia Department headquarters in Fort Vancouver, McLoughlin supervised trade and kept peace with the Indians, inaugurated salmon and timber trade with Mexican-controlled California and Hawaii, and supplied Russian America with produce.

Fort Vancouver became the center of activity in the Pacific Northwest. Every year ships would come from London to drop off supplies and trade goods in exchange for the furs. It was the nexus for the fur trade on the Pacific Coast; its influence reached from the Rocky Mountains to the Hawaiian Islands, and from Russian Alaska into Mexican-controlled California. From Fort Vancouver, at its pinnacle, McLoughlin watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, six ships, and 600 employees. Under McLoughlin&#x27;s management, the Columbia Department remained highly profitable, in part due to the ongoing high demand for beaver hats in Europe. John McLoughlin was worried Fort Vancouver would be attacked and plundered of its heavy stock of supplies, due to its proximity to the Willamette Valley, in which there was already an American settlement of some size.

===York Factory Express===
By 1825, there were usually two brigades from opposite ends of the route, (Fort Vancouver in the Columbia District on the lower Columbia River and the other from York Factory on Hudson Bay), that set out in spring and passed each other in the middle of the continent. Each brigade consisted of about forty to seventy-five men and two to five specially made boats that traveled at breakneck speed (for the time). These brigades often needed help from Indians, who would help the men portage around falls and unnavigable rapids; in return, the Indians were paid with trade goods. An 1839 report cites the travel time as three months and ten days—almost 26 miles (40 km) per day on average. The brigades used boat, horseback, and backpacks to bring the supplies in and furs out to the forts and trading posts along the route.

===Puget Sound Agricultural Company===
The Hudson Bay Company officially discouraged settlement because it interfered with the lucrative fur trade. Two developments in the late 1830s made a reappraisal of Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company operations in the Columbia Department necessary. Apprehensions about American antagonism rose due to US Senator Lewis F. Linn, who in 1838 called for a naval force to be dispatched to the Columbia River, although the measure never passed. Favorable relations with the Russian-American Company (RAC) were established with the signing of the RAC-HBC Agreement in 1839.

To meet the new commercial obligations and to support British claims in the Oregon Question, the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company formally incorporated the Puget Sound Agricultural Company (PSAC) subsidiary in 1840. The new venture, while nominally independent, was administratively included within the Columbia Department. McLoughlin criticized the idea of a fur trading monopoly maintaining agricultural operations, as he felt independent farmers would be efficient. Nonetheless, he was appointed as the PSAC supervisor.

The fertile plains near the Cowlitz River were selected as a suitable location for Cowlitz Farm, the principal PSAC farm. Fort Nisqually was also assigned to the PSAC, where numerous livestock herds were maintained. Several locations were considered for potential farmers, including among the French Canadian and Métis farmers of the Willamette Valley, Scotland, and the Red River colony.

In November 1839, Sir George Simpson instructed Duncan Finlayson to begin promoting the PSAC among the Red River colonists. James Sinclair was appointed by Finlayson to guide the mostly Métis settler families to Fort Vancouver. In June 1841, the party left Fort Garry with 23 families consisting of 121 people. When they arrived at Fort Vancouver, they numbered 21 families of 116 people. Fourteen families were relocated to Fort Nisqually, while the remaining seven families were sent to Fort Cowlitz.

===Japanese shipwreck===
When three Japanese sailors, among them Otokichi, were shipwrecked on the Olympic Peninsula in 1834, McLoughlin thought they might present an opportunity to open trade with Japan. He sent the three men to London on the &quot;Eagle&quot; to try to convince the Crown of his plan. They reached London in 1835, probably the first Japanese to do so since the 16th-century Christopher and Cosmas. When the British government did not show interest, the castaways were sent to Macau so that they could be returned to Japan. Even that was not possible, as Japan did not allow any outside ships to enter its waters.

==Relations with American settlers==
In 1821, with the merger of HBC and the North West Company, the British Parliament imposed the laws of Upper Canada on British subjects in Rupert’s Land and the Columbia District, and gave the authority to enforce those laws to the newly reconfigured Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. McLoughlin, as Superintendent of Fort Vancouver, applied the law to British subjects, kept peace with the natives and sought to maintain law and order over American settlers as well.

In August 1828, McLoughlin was in charge at Fort Vancouver when American explorer Jedediah Smith, John Turner, Arthur Black, and Richard Leland arrived, the only survivors of the massacre of fifteen members of his exploring party by Umpqua people, who lived to the south in Oregon. McLoughlin sent a party headed by Alexander Roderick McLeod to recover Smith&#x27;s property.

In the early 1840s, with the arrival of the first wagon trains via the Oregon Trail, McLoughlin disobeyed company orders and extended substantial aid to the American settlers. Relations between Britain and the United States had become very strained, and many expected war to break out any time. McLoughlin&#x27;s aid probably prevented an armed attack on his outpost by the numerous American settlers. The settlers understood that his motives were not purely altruistic, and some resented the assistance, working against him for the rest of his life.

===Pressure over the Pacific Northwest===
As tensions mounted in the Oregon boundary dispute; Simpson, realizing that border might ultimately be as far north as the 49th parallel, ordered McLoughlin to relocate their regional headquarters to Vancouver Island. McLoughlin, in turn, directed James Douglas to construct Fort Camosun (now Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) in 1843. But McLoughlin, whose life was increasingly connected to the Willamette River Valley, refused to move there.

McLoughlin was involved with the debate over the future of the Oregon Country. He advocated an independent nation that would be free of the United States during debates at the Oregon Lyceum in 1842 through his lawyer. This view won support at first and a resolution adopted but was later moved away from in favor of a resolution by George Abernethy of the Methodist Mission to wait on forming an independent country.

In 1843, American settlers established their own government, called the Provisional Government of Oregon. A legislative committee drafted a code of laws known as the Organic Law. It included the creation of an executive committee of three, a judiciary, militia, land laws, and four counties. There was vagueness and confusion over the nature of the 1843 Organic Law, in particular, whether it was constitutional or statutory. In 1844, a new legislative committee decided to consider it statutory. The 1845 Organic Law made additional changes, including allowing the participation of British subjects in the government. Although the Oregon Treaty of 1846 settled the boundaries of US jurisdiction upon all lands south of the 49th parallel, the Provisional Government continued to function until 1849, when the first governor of Oregon Territory arrived.

==Personal life==
McLoughlin&#x27;s first child, Joseph, was born in 1809. The name of Joseph&#x27;s mother is unknown, but it is likely that she was Ojibwe. Around 1810, McLoughlin entered into a relationship with Marguerite Waddens McKay. McKay was the daughter of Jean-Étienne Waddens, who was one of the original partners of the North West Company, and an indigenous woman whose name is unknown. She was the widow of Alexander McKay, a trader killed in the &quot;Tonquin&quot; incident. Her son Thomas became McLoughlin&#x27;s stepson. McLoughlin and McKay had four children: John Jr., Elisabeth, Eloisa, and David. They were legally married in 1842 at Fort Vancouver.

McLoughlin&#x27;s appearance, 6 foot 4 inches (193 cm) tall with long, prematurely white hair, brought him respect; but he was also generally known for his fair treatment of the people with whom he dealt, whether they were British subjects, U.S. citizens, or of indigenous origin (notwithstanding for example, his asymmetric use of force against the S&#x27;Klallam tribe after an earlier raid--an HBC ship under his command fired its cannons into an unrelated village near Port Townsend in the early morning, killing twenty-seven people and leveling the village. ) . At the time, the wives of many Hudson&#x27;s Bay field employees were indigenous, including McLoughlin&#x27;s own wife.

John McLoughlin lost one son to a violent death. John McLoughlin, Jr. had been appointed the second Clerk in Charge at Fort Stikine, only to die in April 1842 at the hands of one of the fort employees, Urbain Heroux, who was charged with his murder but acquitted for lack of evidence, which added to the grievances John Sr. held against the company.

==Later life in the Oregon Territory==
After resigning from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1846, McLoughlin moved his family south to Oregon City in the Willamette Valley. The Oregon Treaty had been ratified by that time, and the region, now known as the Oregon Territory, was part of the United States. The valley was the destination of choice for settlers streaming in over the Oregon Trail. At his Oregon City store, he sold food and farming tools to settlers.

In 1847, McLoughlin was given the Knighthood of St. Gregory, bestowed on him by Pope Gregory XVI. He became a U.S. citizen in 1849. McLoughlin&#x27;s opponents succeeded in inserting a clause forfeiting his land claim in the Donation Land Claim Act of 1850 by Samuel R. Thurston. Although it was never enforced, it embittered the elderly McLoughlin. He served as mayor of Oregon City in 1851, winning 44 of 66 votes. He died of natural causes in 1857. His grave is now located beside his home overlooking downtown Oregon City.

==Legacy==
McLoughlin is featured on the 1925 Fort Vancouver Centennial half dollar designed by Laura Gardin Fraser.

In 1953, the state of Oregon donated to the National Statuary Hall Collection a bronze statue of McLoughlin, which is currently displayed at the Capitol Visitor Center. The title &quot;Father of Oregon&quot; was officially bestowed on him by the Oregon Legislative Assembly in 1957, on the centennial of his death. Many landmarks in Oregon are named after him, including:
* Mount McLoughlin
* The John McLoughlin Bridge
* McLoughlin Boulevard, the street name of Oregon Route 99E between Oregon City and Portland
* Numerous schools

McLoughlin&#x27;s former residence in Oregon City, now known as the McLoughlin House, is today a museum; it is part of the Fort Vancouver National Historic Site.

<text>The Avogadro constant, commonly denoted or , is an SI defining constant with an exact value of (reciprocal moles). It defines the number of constituent particles in one mole, where the particles in question can be either molecules, atoms, ions, ion pairs, or any other elementary entities. The number is a dimensionless physical constant known as the Avogadro number, commonly denoted and often confused with the constant. Both are named after the Italian physicist and chemist Amedeo Avogadro.

The Avogadro constant is used as a normalization factor in relating the &quot;amount of substance&quot; formula_1, in a sample of a substance formula_2, to the corresponding number of elementary entities formula_3:

formula_4

The Avogadro constant is also the factor that converts the average mass (formula_5) of one particle, in grams, to the molar mass (formula_6) of the substance, in grams per mole (g/mol). That is, formula_7. Historically, this was precisely true, but since the 2019 revision of the SI, the relation is now merely approximate.

The constant also relates the molar volume (the volume per mole) of a substance to the average volume nominally occupied by one of its particles, when both are expressed in the same units of volume. For example, since the molar volume of water in ordinary conditions is about , the volume occupied by one molecule of water is about , or about (cubic nanometres). For a crystalline substance, relates the volume of a crystal with one mole worth of repeating unit cells, to the volume of a single cell (both in the same units).

== Definition ==
The Avogadro constant was historically derived from the old definition of the mole as the amount of substance in 12 grams of carbon-12 (12C); or, equivalently, the number of daltons in a gram, where the dalton is defined as of the mass of a 12C atom. By this old definition, the numerical value of the Avogadro constant in mol−1 (the Avogadro number) was a physical constant that had to be determined experimentally.

The redefinition of the mole in 2019, as being the amount of substance containing exactly particles, meant that the mass of 1 mole of a substance is now exactly the product of the Avogadro number and the average mass of its particles. The dalton, however, is still defined as of the mass of a 12C atom, which must be determined experimentally and is known only with finite accuracy. The prior experiments that aimed to determine the Avogadro constant are now re-interpreted as measurements of the value in grams of the dalton.

By the old definition of mole, the numerical value of one mole of a substance, expressed in grams, was precisely equal to the average mass of one particle in daltons. With the new definition, this numerical equivalence is no longer exact, as it is affected by the uncertainty of the value of the dalton in SI units. However, it is still applicable for all practical purposes. For example, the average mass of one molecule of water is about 18.0153 daltons, and of one mole of water is about 18.0153 grams. Also, the Avogadro number is the approximate number of nucleons (protons and neutrons) in one gram of ordinary matter. 

In older literature, the Avogadro number was also denoted , although that conflicts with the symbol for number of particles in statistical mechanics.

== History ==

=== Origin of the concept ===

The Avogadro constant is named after the Italian scientist Amedeo Avogadro (1776–1856), who, in 1811, first proposed that the volume of a gas (at a given pressure and temperature) is proportional to the number of atoms or molecules regardless of the nature of the gas.

Avogadro&#x27;s hypothesis was popularized four years after his death by Stanislao Cannizzaro, who advocated Avogadro&#x27;s work at the Karlsruhe Congress in 1860.

The name &quot;Avogadro&#x27;s number&quot; was coined in 1909 by the physicist Jean Perrin, who defined it as the number of molecules in exactly 32 grams of oxygen gas. The goal of this definition was to make the mass of a mole of a substance, in grams, be numerically equal to the mass of one molecule relative to the mass of the hydrogen atom; which, because of the law of definite proportions, was the natural unit of atomic mass, and was assumed to be of the atomic mass of oxygen.

=== First measurements ===

The value of Avogadro&#x27;s number (not yet known by that name) was first obtained indirectly by Josef Loschmidt in 1865, by estimating the number of particles in a given volume of gas. This value, the number density of particles in an ideal gas, is now called the Loschmidt constant in his honor, and is related to the Avogadro constant, , by
: formula_8
where is the pressure, is the gas constant, and is the absolute temperature. Because of this work, the symbol is sometimes used for the Avogadro constant, and, in German literature, that name may be used for both constants, distinguished only by the units of measurement. (However, should not be confused with the entirely different Loschmidt constant in English-language literature.)

Perrin himself determined the Avogadro number, which he called &quot;Avogadro&#x27;s constant&quot; (constante d&#x27;Avogadro), by several different experimental methods. He was awarded the 1926 Nobel Prize in Physics, largely for this work.

The electric charge per mole of electrons is a constant called the Faraday constant and has been known since 1834, when Michael Faraday published his works on electrolysis. In 1910, Robert Millikan with the help of Harvey Fletcher obtained the first measurement of the charge on an electron. Dividing the charge on a mole of electrons by the charge on a single electron provided a more accurate estimate of the Avogadro number.

=== SI definition of 1971 ===
In 1971, in its 14th conference, the International Bureau of Weights and Measures (BIPM) decided to regard the amount of substance as an independent dimension of measurement, with the mole as its base unit in the International System of Units (SI). Specifically, the mole was defined as the amount of a substance that contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in () of carbon-12 (12C). Thus, in particular, an amount of one mole of carbon 12 had a corresponding mass that was &quot;exactly&quot; of that element. 

By this definition, one mole of any substance contained exactly as many elementary entities as one mole of any other substance. However, this number was a physical constant that had to be experimentally determined since it depended on the mass (in grams) of one atom of 12C, and therefore, it was known only to a limited number of decimal digits. The common rule of thumb that &quot;one gram of matter contains nucleons&quot; was exact for carbon-12, but slightly inexact for other elements and isotopes.

In the same conference, the BIPM also named (the factor that related the amount of a substance to the corresponding number of particles) the &quot;Avogadro &quot;constant&quot;&quot;. However, the term &quot;Avogadro number&quot; continued to be used, especially in introductory works. As a consequence of this definition, was not a pure number, but had the metric dimension of reciprocal of amount of substance (mol−1).

=== SI redefinition of 2019 ===

In its 26th Conference, the BIPM adopted a different approach: effective 20 May 2019, it defined the Avogadro constant as the exact value , thus redefining the mole as exactly constituent particles of the substance under consideration. One consequence of this change is that the mass of a mole of 12C atoms is no longer exactly 0.012 kg. On the other hand, the dalton ( universal atomic mass unit) remains unchanged as of the mass of 12C. Thus, the molar mass constant remains very close to but no longer exactly equal to 1 g/mol, although the difference ( in relative terms, as of March 2019) is insignificant for all practical purposes.

== Connection to other constants ==

<text>A phase-locked loop or phase lock loop (PLL) is a control system that generates an output signal whose phase is fixed relative to the phase of an input signal. Keeping the input and output phase in lockstep also implies keeping the input and output frequencies the same, thus a phase-locked loop can also track an input frequency. Furthermore, by incorporating a frequency divider, a PLL can generate a stable frequency that is a multiple of the input frequency.

These properties are used for clock synchronization, demodulation, frequency synthesis, clock multipliers, and signal recovery from a noisy communication channel. Since 1969, a single integrated circuit can provide a complete PLL building block, and nowadays have output frequencies from a fraction of a hertz up to many gigahertz. Thus, PLLs are widely employed in radio, telecommunications, computers (e.g. to distribute precisely timed clock signals in microprocessors), grid-tie inverters (electronic power converters used to integrate DC renewable resources and storage elements such as photovoltaics and batteries with the power grid), and other electronic applications.

== Simple example ==
A simple analog PLL is an electronic circuit consisting of a variable frequency oscillator and a phase detector in a feedback loop (Figure 1). The oscillator generates a periodic signal with frequency proportional to an applied voltage, hence the term voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). The phase detector compares the phase of the VCO&#x27;s output signal with the phase of periodic input reference signal and outputs a voltage (stabilized by the filter) to adjust the oscillator&#x27;s frequency to match the phase of to the phase of .

=== Clock analogy ===
Phase can be proportional to time, so a phase difference can correspond to a time difference.

Left alone, different clocks will mark time at slightly different rates. A mechanical clock, for example, might be fast or slow by a few seconds per hour compared to a reference atomic clock (such as the NIST-F2). That time difference becomes substantial over time. Instead, the owner can synchronize their mechanical clock (with varying degrees of accuracy) by phase-locking it to a reference clock.

An inefficient synchronization method involves the owner resetting their clock to that more accurate clock&#x27;s time every week. But, left alone, their clock will still continue to diverge from the reference clock at the same few seconds per hour rate.

A more efficient synchronization method (analogous to the simple PLL in Figure 1) utilizes the fast-slow timing adjust control (analogous to how the VCO&#x27;s frequency can be adjusted) available on some clocks. Analogously to the phase comparator, the owner could notice their clock&#x27;s misalignment and turn its timing adjust a small proportional amount to make their clock&#x27;s frequency a little slower (if their clock was fast) or faster (if their clock was slow). If they don&#x27;t overcompensate, then their clock will be more accurate than before. Over a series of such weekly adjustments, their clock&#x27;s notion of a second would agree close enough with the reference clock, so they could be said to be locked both in frequency and phase.

An early electromechanical version of a phase-locked loop was used in 1921 in the Shortt-Synchronome clock.

==History==
Spontaneous synchronization of weakly coupled pendulum clocks was noted by the Dutch physicist Christiaan Huygens as early as 1673. Around the turn of the 19th century, Lord Rayleigh observed synchronization of weakly coupled organ pipes and tuning forks. In 1919, W. H. Eccles and J. H. Vincent found that two electronic oscillators that had been tuned to oscillate at slightly different frequencies but that were coupled to a resonant circuit would soon oscillate at the same frequency. Automatic synchronization of electronic oscillators was described in 1923 by Edward Victor Appleton.

In 1925, David Robertson, first professor of electrical engineering at the University of Bristol, introduced phase locking in his clock design to control the striking of the bell Great George in the new Wills Memorial Building. Robertson&#x27;s clock incorporated an electromechanical device that could vary the rate of oscillation of the pendulum, and derived correction signals from a circuit that compared the pendulum phase with that of an incoming telegraph pulse from Greenwich Observatory every morning at 10:00 GMT. Including equivalents of every element of a modern electronic PLL, Robertson&#x27;s system was notably ahead of its time in that its phase detector was a relay logic implementation of the transistor circuits for phase/frequency detectors not seen until the 1970s. 

Robertson&#x27;s work predated research towards what was later named the phase-lock loop in 1932, when British researchers developed an alternative to Edwin Armstrong&#x27;s superheterodyne receiver, the Homodyne or direct-conversion receiver. In the homodyne or synchrodyne system, a local oscillator was tuned to the desired input frequency and multiplied with the input signal. The resulting output signal included the original modulation information. The intent was to develop an alternative receiver circuit that required fewer tuned circuits than the superheterodyne receiver. Since the local oscillator would rapidly drift in frequency, an automatic correction signal was applied to the oscillator, maintaining it in the same phase and frequency of the desired signal. The technique was described in 1932, in a paper by Henri de Bellescize, in the French journal &quot;L&#x27;Onde Électrique&quot;.

In analog television receivers since at least the late 1930s, phase-locked-loop horizontal and vertical sweep circuits are locked to synchronization pulses in the broadcast signal.
In 1969, Signetics introduced a line of low-cost monolithic integrated circuits like the NE565 using bipolar transistors, that were complete phase-locked loop systems on a chip, and applications for the technique multiplied. A few years later, RCA introduced the CD4046 Micropower Phase-Locked Loop using CMOS, which also became a popular integrated circuit building block.

==Structure and function==
Phase-locked loop mechanisms may be implemented as either analog or digital circuits. Both implementations use the same basic structure.
Analog PLL circuits include four basic elements:
* Phase detector
* Low-pass filter
* Voltage controlled oscillator
* Feedback path, which may include a frequency divider

===Variations===
There are several variations of PLLs. Some terms that are used are &quot;analog phase-locked loop&quot; (APLL), also referred to as a linear phase-locked loop&quot; (LPLL), &quot;digital phase-locked loop&quot; (DPLL), &quot;all digital phase-locked loop&quot; (ADPLL), and &quot;software phase-locked loop&quot; (SPLL).

; Analog or linear PLL (APLL):Phase detector is an analog multiplier. Loop filter is active or passive. Uses a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). APLL is said to be a &quot;type II&quot; if its loop filter has transfer function with exactly one pole at the origin (see also Egan&#x27;s conjecture on the pull-in range of type II APLL).
; Digital PLL (DPLL): An analog PLL with a digital phase detector (such as XOR, edge-triggered JK flip flop, phase frequency detector). May have digital divider in the loop.
; All digital PLL (ADPLL): Phase detector, filter and oscillator are digital. Uses a numerically controlled oscillator (NCO).
; Neuronal PLL (NPLL): Phase detector is implemented by neuronal non-linearity, oscillator by rate-controlled oscillating neurons.
; Software PLL (SPLL): Functional blocks are implemented by software rather than specialized hardware.
; Charge-pump PLL (CP-PLL):CP-PLL is a modification of phase-locked loops with phase-frequency detector and square waveform signals. See also Gardner&#x27;s conjecture on CP-PLL.

===Performance parameters===

*Type and order.
*Frequency ranges: hold-in range (tracking range), pull-in range (capture range, acquisition range), lock-in range. See also Gardner&#x27;s problem on the lock-in range, Egan&#x27;s conjecture on the pull-in range of type II APLL, Viterbi&#x27;s problem on the PLL ranges coincidence.
*Loop bandwidth: Defining the speed of the control loop.
*Transient response: Like overshoot and settling time to a certain accuracy (like 50 ppm).
*Steady-state errors: Like remaining phase or timing error.
*Output spectrum purity: Like sidebands generated from a certain VCO tuning voltage ripple.
*Phase-noise: Defined by noise energy in a certain frequency band (like 10 kHz offset from carrier). Highly dependent on VCO phase-noise, PLL bandwidth, etc.
*General parameters: Such as power consumption, supply voltage range, output amplitude, etc.

==Applications==
Phase-locked loops are widely used for synchronization purposes; in space communications for coherent demodulation and threshold extension, bit synchronization, and symbol synchronization. Phase-locked loops can also be used to demodulate frequency-modulated signals. In radio transmitters, a PLL is used to synthesize new frequencies which are a multiple of a reference frequency, with the same stability as the reference frequency.

Other applications include:
* Demodulation of frequency modulation (FM): If PLL is locked to an FM signal, the VCO tracks the instantaneous frequency of the input signal. The filtered error voltage which controls the VCO and maintains lock with the input signal is demodulated FM output. The VCO transfer characteristics determine the linearity of the demodulated out. Since the VCO used in an integrated-circuit PLL is highly linear, it is possible to realize highly linear FM demodulators. 
* Demodulation of frequency-shift keying (FSK): In digital data communication and computer peripherals, binary data is transmitted by means of a carrier frequency which is shifted between two preset frequencies.
* Recovery of small signals that otherwise would be lost in noise (lock-in amplifier to track the reference frequency)
* Recovery of clock timing information from a data stream such as from a disk drive
* Clock multipliers in microprocessors that allow internal processor elements to run faster than external connections, while maintaining precise timing relationships
* Demodulation of modems and other tone signals for telecommunications and remote control.
* DSP of video signals; Phase-locked loops are also used to synchronize phase and frequency to the input analog video signal so it can be sampled and digitally processed
* Atomic force microscopy in frequency modulation mode, to detect changes of the cantilever resonance frequency due to tip–surface interactions
* DC motor drive

===Clock recovery===
Some data streams, especially high-speed serial data streams (such as the raw stream of data from the magnetic head of a disk drive), are sent without an accompanying clock. The receiver generates a clock from an approximate frequency reference, and then uses a PLL to phase-align it to the data stream&#x27;s signal edges. This process is referred to as clock recovery. For this scheme to work, the data stream must have edges frequently-enough to correct any drift in the PLL&#x27;s oscillator. Thus a line code with a hard upper bound on the maximum time between edges (e.g. 8b/10b encoding) is typically used to encode the data.

===Deskewing===
If a clock is sent in parallel with data, that clock can be used to sample the data. Because the clock must be received and amplified before it can drive the flip-flops which sample the data, there will be a finite, and process-, temperature-, and voltage-dependent delay between the detected clock edge and the received data window. This delay limits the frequency at which data can be sent. One way of eliminating this delay is to include a deskew PLL on the receive side, so that the clock at each data flip-flop is phase-matched to the received clock. In that type of application, a special form of a PLL called a delay-locked loop (DLL) is frequently used.

===Clock generation===
Many electronic systems include processors of various sorts that operate at hundreds of megahertz to gigahertz, well above the practical frequencies of crystal oscillators. Typically, the clocks supplied to these processors come from clock generator PLLs, which multiply a lower-frequency reference clock (usually 50 or 100 MHz) up to the operating frequency of the processor. The multiplication factor can be quite large in cases where the operating frequency is multiple gigahertz and the reference crystal is just tens or hundreds of megahertz.

===Spread spectrum===
All electronic systems emit some unwanted radio frequency energy. Various regulatory agencies (such as the FCC in the United States) put limits on the emitted energy and any interference caused by it. The emitted noise generally appears at sharp spectral peaks (usually at the operating frequency of the device, and a few harmonics). A system designer can use a spread-spectrum PLL to reduce interference with high-Q receivers by spreading the energy over a larger portion of the spectrum. For example, by changing the operating frequency up and down by a small amount (about 1%), a device running at hundreds of megahertz can spread its interference evenly over a few megahertz of spectrum, which drastically reduces the amount of noise seen on broadcast FM radio channels, which have a bandwidth of several tens of kilohertz.

===Clock distribution===

Typically, the reference clock enters the chip and drives a phase locked loop (PLL), which then drives the system&#x27;s clock distribution. The clock distribution is usually balanced so that the clock arrives at every endpoint simultaneously. One of those endpoints is the PLL&#x27;s feedback input. The function of the PLL is to compare the distributed clock to the incoming reference clock, and vary the phase and frequency of its output until the reference and feedback clocks are phase and frequency matched.

PLLs are ubiquitous—they tune clocks in systems several feet across, as well as clocks in small portions of individual chips. Sometimes the reference clock may not actually be a pure clock at all, but rather a data stream with enough transitions that the PLL is able to recover a regular clock from that stream. Sometimes the reference clock is the same frequency as the clock driven through the clock distribution, other times the distributed clock may be some rational multiple of the reference.

===AM detection===
A PLL may be used to synchronously demodulate amplitude modulated (AM) signals. The PLL recovers the phase and frequency of the incoming AM signal&#x27;s carrier. The recovered phase at the VCO differs from the carrier&#x27;s by 90°, so it is shifted in phase to match, and then fed to a multiplier. The output of the multiplier contains both the sum and the difference frequency signals, and the demodulated output is obtained by low-pass filtering. Since the PLL responds only to the carrier frequencies which are very close to the VCO output, a PLL AM detector exhibits a high degree of selectivity and noise immunity which is not possible with conventional peak type AM demodulators. However, the loop may lose lock where AM signals have 100% modulation depth.

===Jitter and noise reduction===
One desirable property of all PLLs is that the reference and feedback clock edges be brought into very close alignment. The average difference in time between the phases of the two signals when the PLL has achieved lock is called the static phase offset (also called the steady-state phase error). The variance between these phases is called tracking jitter. Ideally, the static phase offset should be zero, and the tracking jitter should be as low as possible.

Phase noise is another type of jitter observed in PLLs, and is caused by the oscillator itself and by elements used in the oscillator&#x27;s frequency control circuit. Some technologies are known to perform better than others in this regard. The best digital PLLs are constructed with emitter-coupled logic (ECL) elements, at the expense of high power consumption. To keep phase noise low in PLL circuits, it is best to avoid saturating logic families such as transistor-transistor logic (TTL) or CMOS.

Another desirable property of all PLLs is that the phase and frequency of the generated clock be unaffected by rapid changes in the voltages of the power and ground supply lines, as well as the voltage of the substrate on which the PLL circuits are fabricated. This is called substrate and supply noise rejection. The higher the noise rejection, the better.

To further improve the phase noise of the output, an injection locked oscillator can be employed following the VCO in the PLL.

===Frequency synthesis===
In digital wireless communication systems (GSM, CDMA etc.), PLLs are used to provide the local oscillator up-conversion during transmission and down-conversion during reception. In most cellular handsets this function has been largely integrated into a single integrated circuit to reduce the cost and size of the handset. However, due to the high performance required of base station terminals, the transmission and reception circuits are built with discrete components to achieve the levels of performance required. GSM local oscillator modules are typically built with a frequency synthesizer integrated circuit and discrete resonator VCOs.

===Phase angle reference===
Grid-tie inverters based on voltage source inverters source or sink real power into the AC electric grid as a function of the phase angle of the voltage they generate relative to the grid&#x27;s voltage phase angle, which is measured using a PLL. In photovoltaic applications, the more the sine wave produced leads the grid voltage wave, the more power is injected into the grid. For battery applications, the more the sine wave produced lags the grid voltage wave, the more the battery charges from the grid, and the more the sine wave produced leads the grid voltage wave, the more the battery discharges into the grid.

==Block diagram==

The block diagram shown in the figure shows an input signal, &quot;F&quot;&quot;I&quot;, which is used to generate an output, &quot;F&quot;&quot;O&quot;. The input signal is often called the &quot;reference signal&quot; (also abbreviated &quot;F&quot;&quot;REF&quot;).

At the input, a phase detector (shown as the Phase frequency detector and Charge pump blocks in the figure) compares two input signals, producing an error signal which is proportional to their phase difference. The error signal is then low-pass filtered and used to drive a VCO which creates an output phase. The output is fed through an optional divider back to the input of the system, producing a negative feedback loop. If the output phase drifts, the error signal will increase, driving the VCO phase in the opposite direction so as to reduce the error. Thus the output phase is locked to the phase of the input.

Analog phase locked loops are generally built with an analog phase detector, low-pass filter and VCO placed in a negative feedback configuration. A digital phase locked loop uses a digital phase detector; it may also have a divider in the feedback path or in the reference path, or both, in order to make the PLL&#x27;s output signal frequency a rational multiple of the reference frequency. A non-integer multiple of the reference frequency can also be created by replacing the simple divide-by-&quot;N&quot; counter in the feedback path with a programmable pulse swallowing counter. This technique is usually referred to as a fractional-N synthesizer or fractional-N PLL.

The oscillator generates a periodic output signal. Assume that initially the oscillator is at nearly the same frequency as the reference signal. If the phase from the oscillator falls behind that of the reference, the phase detector changes the control voltage of the oscillator so that it speeds up. Likewise, if the phase creeps ahead of the reference, the phase detector changes the control voltage to slow down the oscillator. Since initially the oscillator may be far from the reference frequency, practical phase detectors may also respond to frequency differences, so as to increase the lock-in range of allowable inputs. Depending on the application, either the output of the controlled oscillator, or the control signal to the oscillator, provides the useful output of the PLL system.

==Elements==

===Phase detector===

A phase detector (PD) generates a voltage, which represents the phase difference between two signals. In a PLL, the two inputs of the phase detector are the reference input and the feedback from the VCO. The PD output voltage is used to control the VCO such that the phase difference between the two inputs is held constant, making it a negative feedback system.
Different types of phase detectors have different performance characteristics.

For instance, the frequency mixer produces harmonics that adds complexity in applications where spectral purity of the VCO signal is important. The resulting unwanted (spurious) sidebands, also called &quot;reference spurs&quot; can dominate the filter requirements and reduce the capture range well below or increase the lock time beyond the requirements. In these applications the more complex digital phase detectors are used which do not have as severe a reference spur component on their output. Also, when in lock, the steady-state phase difference at the inputs using this type of phase detector is near 90 degrees.

In PLL applications it is frequently required to know when the loop is out of lock. The more complex digital phase-frequency detectors usually have an output that allows a reliable indication of an out of lock condition.

An XOR gate is often used for digital PLLs as an effective yet simple phase detector. It can also be used in an analog sense with only slight modification to the circuitry.

===Filter===
The block commonly called the PLL loop filter (usually a low-pass filter) generally has two distinct functions.

The primary function is to determine loop dynamics, also called stability. This is how the loop responds to disturbances, such as changes in the reference frequency, changes of the feedback divider, or at startup. Common considerations are the range over which the loop can achieve lock (pull-in range, lock range or capture range), how fast the loop achieves lock (lock time, lock-up time or settling time) and damping behavior. Depending on the application, this may require one or more of the following: a simple proportion (gain or attenuation), an integral (low-pass filter) and/or derivative (high-pass filter). Loop parameters commonly examined for this are the loop&#x27;s gain margin and phase margin. Common concepts in control theory including the PID controller are used to design this function.

The second common consideration is limiting the amount of reference frequency energy (ripple) appearing at the phase detector output that is then applied to the VCO control input. This frequency modulates the VCO and produces FM sidebands commonly called &quot;reference spurs&quot;.

The design of this block can be dominated by either of these considerations, or can be a complex process juggling the interactions of the two. The typical trade-off of increasing the bandwidth is degraded stability. Conversely, the tradeoff of extra damping for better stability is reduced speed and increased settling time. Often the phase-noise is also affected.

===Oscillator===

All phase-locked loops employ an oscillator element with variable frequency capability. This can be an analog VCO either driven by analog circuitry in the case of an APLL or driven digitally through the use of a digital-to-analog converter as is the case for some DPLL designs. Pure digital oscillators such as a numerically controlled oscillator are used in ADPLLs.

===Feedback path and optional divider===

PLLs may include a divider between the oscillator and the feedback input to the phase detector to produce a frequency synthesizer. A programmable divider is particularly useful in radio transmitter applications and for computer clocking, since a large number of frequencies can be produced from a single stable, accurate, quartz crystal–controlled reference oscillator (which were expensive before commercial-scale hydrothermal synthesis provided cheap synthetic quartz).

Some PLLs also include a divider between the reference clock and the reference input to the phase detector. If the divider in the feedback path divides by formula_1 and the reference input divider divides by formula_2, it allows the PLL to multiply the reference frequency by formula_3. It might seem simpler to just feed the PLL a lower frequency, but in some cases the reference frequency may be constrained by other issues, and then the reference divider is useful.

Frequency multiplication can also be attained by locking the VCO output to the &quot;N&quot;th harmonic of the reference signal. Instead of a simple phase detector, the design uses a harmonic mixer (sampling mixer). The harmonic mixer turns the reference signal into an impulse train that is rich in harmonics. The VCO output is coarse tuned to be close to one of those harmonics. Consequently, the desired harmonic mixer output (representing the difference between the &quot;N&quot; harmonic and the VCO output) falls within the loop filter passband.

It should also be noted that the feedback is not limited to a frequency divider. This element can be other elements such as a frequency multiplier, or a mixer. The multiplier will make the VCO output a sub-multiple (rather than a multiple) of the reference frequency. A mixer can translate the VCO frequency by a fixed offset. It may also be a combination of these. For example, a divider following a mixer allows the divider to operate at a much lower frequency than the VCO without a loss in loop gain.

==Modeling==

===Time domain model of APLL===
The equations governing a phase-locked loop with an analog multiplier as the phase detector and linear filter may be derived as follows. Let the input to the phase detector be formula_4 and the output of the VCO is formula_5 with phases formula_6 and formula_7. The functions formula_8 and formula_9 describe waveforms of signals. Then the output of the phase detector formula_10 is given by

:formula_11

The VCO frequency is usually taken as a function of the VCO input
formula_12 as
:formula_13
where formula_14 is the &quot;sensitivity&quot; of the VCO and is expressed in Hz / V;
formula_15 is a free-running frequency of VCO.

The loop filter can be described by a system of linear differential equations
:formula_16

where formula_10 is an input of the filter,
formula_12 is an output of the filter, formula_19 is
formula_20-by-formula_20 matrix,
formula_22. formula_23 represents an initial state of the filter. The star symbol is a conjugate transpose.

Hence the following system describes PLL
:formula_24
where formula_25 is an initial phase shift.

===Phase domain model of APLL===
Consider the input of PLL formula_4 and VCO output
formula_5 are high frequency signals. Then for any piecewise differentiable formula_28-periodic functions
formula_29 and formula_9 there is a function formula_31 such that the output formula_32 of Filter
:formula_33
in phase domain is asymptotically equal (the difference formula_34 is small with respect to the frequencies) to the output of the Filter in time domain model. 
Here function formula_31 is a phase detector characteristic.

Denote by formula_36 the phase difference
:formula_37
Then the following dynamical system describes PLL behavior

:formula_38

Here formula_39; formula_40 is the frequency of a reference oscillator (we assume that formula_15 is constant).

====Example====
Consider sinusoidal signals

:formula_42

and a simple one-pole RC circuit as a filter. The time-domain model takes the form

:formula_43

PD characteristics for this signals is equal to

:formula_44

Hence the phase domain model takes the form

:formula_45

This system of equations is equivalent to the equation of mathematical pendulum

:formula_46

===Linearized phase domain model===
Phase locked loops can also be analyzed as control systems by applying the Laplace transform. The loop response can be written as

:formula_47

Where
* formula_48 is the output phase in radians
* formula_49 is the input phase in radians
* formula_50 is the phase detector gain in volts per radian
* formula_51 is the VCO gain in radians per volt-second
* formula_52 is the loop filter transfer function (dimensionless)

The loop characteristics can be controlled by inserting different types of loop filters. The simplest filter is a one-pole RC circuit. The loop transfer function in this case is

:formula_53

The loop response becomes:

:formula_54

This is the form of a classic harmonic oscillator. The denominator can be related to that of a second order system:

:formula_55

where formula_56 is the damping factor and formula_57 is the natural frequency of the loop.

For the one-pole RC filter,

:formula_58
:formula_59

The loop natural frequency is a measure of the response time of the loop, and the damping factor is a measure of the overshoot and ringing. Ideally, the natural frequency should be high and the damping factor should be near 0.707 (critical damping). With a single pole filter, it is not possible to control the loop frequency and damping factor independently. For the case of critical damping,

:formula_60
:formula_61

A slightly more effective filter, the lag-lead filter includes one pole and one zero. This can be realized with two resistors and one capacitor. The transfer function for this filter is

:formula_62

This filter has two time constants

Real world loop filter design can be much more complex e.g. using higher order filters to reduce various types or source of phase noise. (See the D Banerjee ref below)

===Implementing a digital phase-locked loop in software===
Digital phase locked loops can be implemented in hardware, using integrated circuits such as a CMOS 4046. However, with microcontrollers becoming faster, it may make sense to implement a phase locked loop in software for applications that do not require locking onto signals in the MHz range or faster, such as precisely controlling motor speeds. Software implementation has several advantages including easy customization of the feedback loop including changing the multiplication or division ratio between the signal being tracked and the output oscillator. Furthermore, a software implementation is useful to understand and experiment with. As an example of a phase-locked loop implemented using a phase frequency detector is presented in MATLAB, as this type of phase detector is robust and easy to implement.
% This example is written in MATLAB

% Initialize variables
vcofreq = zeros(1, numiterations);
ervec = zeros(1, numiterations);
% Keep track of last states of reference, signal, and error signal
qsig = 0; qref = 0; lref = 0; lsig = 0; lersig = 0;
phs = 0;
freq = 0;

% Loop filter constants (proportional and derivative)
% Currently powers of two to facilitate multiplication by shifts
prop = 1 / 128;
deriv = 64;

for it = 1:numiterations
 % Simulate a local oscillator using a 16-bit counter
 phs = mod(phs + floor(freq / 2 ^ 16), 2 ^ 16);
 ref = phs &lt; 32768;
 % Get the next digital value (0 or 1) of the signal to track
 sig = tracksig(it);
 % Implement the phase-frequency detector
 rst = ~ (qsig &amp; qref); % Reset the &quot;flip-flop&quot; of the phase-frequency
 % detector when both signal and reference are high
 qsig = (qsig | (sig &amp; ~ lsig)) &amp; rst; % Trigger signal flip-flop and leading edge of signal
 qref = (qref | (ref &amp; ~ lref)) &amp; rst; % Trigger reference flip-flop on leading edge of reference
 lref = ref; lsig = sig; % Store these values for next iteration (for edge detection)
 ersig = qref - qsig; % Compute the error signal (whether frequency should increase or decrease)
 % Error signal is given by one or the other flip flop signal
 % Implement a pole-zero filter by proportional and derivative input to frequency
 filtered_ersig = ersig + (ersig - lersig) * deriv;
 % Keep error signal for proportional output
 lersig = ersig;
 % Integrate VCO frequency using the error signal
 freq = freq - 2 ^ 16 * filtered_ersig * prop;
 % Frequency is tracked as a fixed-point binary fraction
 % Store the current VCO frequency
 vcofreq(1, it) = freq / 2 ^ 16;
 % Store the error signal to show whether signal or reference is higher frequency
 ervec(1, it) = ersig;
end
In this example, an array codice_1 is assumed to contain a reference signal to be tracked. The oscillator is implemented by a counter, with the most significant bit of the counter indicating the on/off status of the oscillator. This code simulates the two D-type flip-flops that comprise a phase-frequency comparator. When either the reference or signal has a positive edge, the corresponding flip-flop switches high. Once both reference and signal is high, both flip-flops are reset. Which flip-flop is high determines at that instant whether the reference or signal leads the other. The error signal is the difference between these two flip-flop values. The pole-zero filter is implemented by adding the error signal and its derivative to the filtered error signal. This in turn is integrated to find the oscillator frequency.

In practice, one would likely insert other operations into the feedback of this phase-locked loop. For example, if the phase locked loop were to implement a frequency multiplier, the oscillator signal could be divided in frequency before it is compared to the reference signal.
